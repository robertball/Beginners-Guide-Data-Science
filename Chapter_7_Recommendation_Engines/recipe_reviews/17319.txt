I've used this recipe many, many times -- we love it. I actually use it so much, I put together a big batch of all the dry ingredients so I don't have to measure out all the spices every time (let alone go searching my pantry to find them every time)... I multiplied all the dry ingredients (onion powder through red pepper flakes) by 8 (eg, 1/4 tsp becomes 2 tsp, 1/8 is 1 tsp, etc), mixed them all up, and store them in a small jar -- every time I want to make the sauce, I just have to measure out 2 tsp of the dry ingredients.

We love this recipe!

Hint: For easy/quick prep, scale this recipe to 40 and combine the dry spices in a spice jar.  Whenever you want fresh sauce, use appx. 1 tablespoon of the mixture in the regular recipe.

This was very good, and I made no changes.  My only comment is that it doesn't make a whole lot, so if you have a large pizza or calzone I would suggest doubling the recipe.

I made this recipe as is the first time, omitting the anchovy paste.  We found it to be much too sweet and a little too oniony.  Made it a second time using 1 tsp of honey rather than 2 tbsp and it was much better.  Also used romano cheese rather than parmesean, and only used 1/2 tsp onion powder.  Instead of adding dried herbs, we mixed the other ingredients together in a sauce pan and submerged a sprig each of fresh basil and oregano in the tomato mixture.  Simmered for just a few minutes and then discarded the herb sprigs.  We ended up with smooth tomato texture with a nice fresh herb taste.  Don't simmer too long or the herb taste will be too overpowering! This sauce also has a kick when you cut back on the honey.  Next time we'll do 1/8 tsp crushed red pepper *or* cayenne, not both.  But we'll definitely make it again!

I added a few tablespoons of white wine to the warm water, which adds a wonderful flavor. Remember that the honey and peppers balance each other out, so if you follow other reviewers' suggestions and reduce the honey, you should also reduce the peppers -- unless you like your sauce very spicy. I use half the honey and use only half the black and cayenne pepper, and omit the red pepper flakes. I also double the oregano for a genuine pizzeria flavor.

This comes about as close to perfection as any pizza sauce i've ever tasted and i'm old school Italian. Please do not variate or omit any ingredients you'll lose the "exquisite" flavor this sauce imparts. I read a review that said they ommited the anchovies and the sauce was to sweet. Anchovies give this a salty balance against the honey sweetness. The odd thing was this was voted a top review, people please! I could eat this with a spoon as is, it's just that good. In my 50 years of life this is the best pizza sauce i've ever tasted. (yep, it's THAT good)

We are a big pizza eating family and this was by far the BEST pizza sauce ever.  I will have to agree with those that said to either completely eliminate the honey or cut it in half.  I used half of it and still thought it was too sweet so I added lots of garlic salt to take away the sweetness.  I will make this recipe for years to come.  Thank you very much Angie for your great recipe!!

I was suspicious of the idea of adding anchovies, but decided to put on my big girl panties and go with it. The recipe really does need them - don't worry about it being fishy, it's not, and it adds the savory character necessary to balance the honey. So many of the reviews saying "too sweet" are leaving out the anchovies, altering the balance of sweet/savory. I do not find it helpful when the reviewer leaves a rating for their "rendition" of the recipe rather than the actual recipe as given on the site.

We found this recipe WAY TOO SWEET and WAY TOO SPICY.  Think it could have been really good with the honey, cayenne pepper, and pepper flakes cut way back or cut out altogether.  I kept adding more tomato paste and sauce and other spices to the recipe to try to mask these flavors and ended up with a ton of sauce that never did taste quite right.  I would, however, make it again and think it would be a good sauce without those sweet and spicy ingredients.

Nice!  I used 8 oz. of tomato sauce and less honey and cheese.  My husband raved and ate the entire pizza!

TOOOO sweet AND TOOOO Spicy and I RARELY say that!  I followed the directions to a "T"… I also rarely do that.  After tasting… I realized I was going to have to doctor it up for my tastes.   Let me comment for a moment… this recipe is probably screaming good for all those reviewers but for me, my tastebuds, ME, it's too much of a good thing (sweet and spicy).  So I spent another 20 minutes adding, tasting, adjusting, tasting, etc… I think I got it right for MY taste buds.  Nothing against the original recipe.  Again, it's just not right for me.   But since I DID make it as written.  I feel I can rate it accordingly.  Dang it!  I REALLY wanted this to be the BOMB SAUCE I needed. Alas,  I ended up with  a sauce I could use for my pizza tonight (after doctoring it up).    I'm still on the hunt for "THE BOMB SAUCE!"

Holy cow!!!  I will never buy pizza sauce again.  This sauce is 10 stars!  The ingredients are easy to find (I had everything but the anchovy paste, which I went out and bought) and I make it exactly as written.  Using Jay's signature pizza crust, this sauce, and lots of fresh veggies, we don't ever order out anymore.  Delivery is just a big disappointment after this!

Awesome!  I go through a lot of pizza sauce...  here's what I do.  1 can (28oz) Tomato sauce & 1 can (6oz) of tomatoe paste.  No water. Triple all other ingredients.  I prefer to cut back the honey, maybe only half.

This sauce is the best pizza sauce I have ever tasted. I used it with Jay's Pizza dough recipe.  I did add 1 t of cumin seed, subbed garlic salt for the fresh garlic and left out the anchovy paste.  Next time I'm going to use anise or fennel seed in place of the cumin.   Didn't need all of it so I used the leftover as a dip for breadsticks..yummy.  My husband does not want another "frozen or restaurant" pizza again.  Our daughters loved it too! Thanks Angie!

I make this sauce over and over, it is incredible and everyone always raves about it.  TO THOSE THAT THINK ITS TOO SWEET:  DO NOT judge the sauce and make changes or "doctor it" based on how it tastes BEFORE its cooked with the pizza!  Any pizza sauce you make changes flavor completely once cooked, trust me I am a pro.  This is the BEST pizza sauce I have ever had.

I'd rate this 10 if I could!  For years, ever since I had found it, I used Cat Cora's pizza sauce recipe which I found on www.foodnetwork.com.  This sauce is much better than hers!  All the ingredients are balanced and are simply perfect for a terrific pizza.  Thank you so much Angie Gorkoff for this exquisite recipe!  ............   When I made it I used Contadina Tomato Paste.  I've used several brands over the years but have found that Contadina brand is the richest tasting of all the brands I've found.

I wish I had read the reviews before making this.  As many others have noted, 2 Tbsp honey made this a little too sweet.  Next time, I'll use only 1 Tbsp.  Other than that, the sauce was very delicious.  I kept tasting the sauce before the pizza dough had finished rising.  Had to stop myself from tasting before there was no sauce left to put on the pizza!  Dinner was punctuated by frequent and enthusiastic "mmm's" and "wow's" from the husband.  I had no idea homemade sauce would be so easy and yummy!

YUCK!!  This is the WORST pizza sauce I have ever tasted!  I didnt even put it on my pizza it was so awful.  I tasted it when it was finished and about cried because of how bad it tasted.  It was way too sweet and just yucky.  I had my husband taste it too see what he thought and he put it all down the sink and made me some different sauce.

This sauce was wonderful. I used brown sugar instead of honey and I did not add anchovy paste as I didn't have any on hand.  My husbands pizza was almost perfect but the sauce just wasn't quite right.  This was the recipe we needed to make it the perfect pizza.

I made this sauce as it  was written and decided to cook it as it tasted raw to me. The honey was way too much  and the sauce was too sweet I was tempted to throw it out but I tried to save it.I  decided to add one more can of tomato paste , 1cup  more water. Much more oregano, basil, garlic and onion powder and some black pepper. I cooked it on low for 15 min and it was very nice tasting. This made enough for 3 party size pizzas. Next time I would omit the honey and the parmeasan  cheese. just adding maybe 1 tablesppon of sugar instead, salt to taste and my extra herbs and spices.

This was easy to make and delicious! I used minced fresh onion in place of the powdered and Worcestershire sauce in place of the anchovy paste. The next time I might cut down the amount of honey a little, but otherwise I and my guests enjoyed the sauce very much.

I cut the honey in half.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe and I wouldn't change a thing.  I used "Jay's Signature Pizza Crust" on this site with this sauce (and provolone, olives, garlic, feta and italian sausage) to make the best pizza I've ever made.  I've tried dozens of recipes from dozens of sources and never had one we liked half as much.  Yum!

I would never have thought I could make a pizza sauce like this. Wonderful flavor, texture was right on target. Family commented on the "extra good pizza tonight". I didn't tell them, until they commented, that I had made the sauce. Well worth the time to make.

I am very picky about my pizza sauce. I cant tell  you how many recipes I have tried or ones I have bought at the store that I disliked. I am happy to say that my search is over. This sauce is excellent! At first I wasnt to sure because I thought the honey flavor was a little sweet but after it sat for awhile and cooked on the pizza it was perfect. I did not use the cayenne pepper because I thought it might be to spicy for my kids but the redpepper flakes add just enough heat.

Absolutely fab!  The only changes I made were to leave out the marjoram, which I didn't have on hand, and to add extra minced garlic (for my taste, though the amount specified would be fine for most). The flavor was just perfect!  I will be using this again and again, it was a huge hit for my family.  Thanks so much for sharing!

This was ok. I would have to tweak it if I made it again. It was too sweet for my tastes and had a pretty 'HOT' after-bite!

I made the sauce this past Friday for pizza night in our house.  What a simple recipe with fantastic results!  I subbed splenda for the honey and grated romano cheese from a wedge I had in the fridge... I did use the anchovies...my store didn't have the paste so I pulverized regular anchovies fillets  with a mortar and pestle to get the required amount.  My daughter complained that it was "too sweet" (but she is a picky pain in the rear and no one pays her much mind at mealtime anyway)... it was sweet for us as we are accustomed to more savory sauces.  This was a nice change though... and being my first attempt at home made pizza sauce, I was THRILLED!  My husband (the pizza snob) actually went on and on about it... and he is very picky about sweet/savory sauces. I will never ruin a homemade pizza with jarred sauce again!  I have filed this one for future pizzas and may decrease sugar/splenda by 1/2 to see  how that comes out.  Thank you for such a wonderful idea!

I tried this sauce many times and found the honey to be too overpowering, even when I halved it. The best kind of sauce should be naturally sweetened in my opinion by the tomatoes. If you like sweet tasting pizza, then this sauce is for you. It just so happens, I don't.

This is a lovely sauce - I sautee the minced garlic in olive oil for a few seconds then add the tomato paste to the sauce. Instead of anchovies I add 1/4 tsp Worcestershire sauce. I cook it on low heat for 30 then let sit - it needs time for flavors to devlop. I find it does become less sweet with time. I also only add crushed pepper, no cayenne.

This sauce is SO incredibly easy, and extremely tasty.  No cooking, and just a little preparation time.   Tip: Naan bread makes an excellent personal pizza crust!

Easy, Easy, great tasting sauce. I did not add the parmesan cheese (didn't have any), and I only used 1 tbl. of honey,  but I did add the achovy paste. It soo makes a difference. It does not taste fishy at all. Please try this recipe, you wont be disappointed! This is a keeper!

Absolutely delicious and easy to make. I had actually made one of the other "easy pizza sauce" recipes on a previous pizza and thought the intense tomato taste was way overwhelming. I even mentioned that I would use brown sugar the next time to tone down the flavor. Well, there isn't going to be a next time for that recipe because this one takes the cake! I love the parmesan flavor and the use of honey to sweeten the sauce up a tad. I didn't use cayenne pepper or anchovy paste because I didn't have any, but I think I would have left both of those out anyway. Anchovies = yuck, in my opinion. Anyway, this sauce was SO good even without it that I would even dip my finger in and eat it plain sometimes. My mother even dipped crackers in it! I made it early in the day because I planned on making pizza later that night, but changed my mind and ended up leaving the sauce in the fridge overnight to make pizza the next day. The sauce was even thicker after being in the fridge so long and had a consistency and taste similar to thick marinara sauce. I didn't mind it, and actually really liked it, because it didn't get my crust all soggy like other sauces do. Anyway, this is the best sauce I've ever made.

I've made this multiple times and it is fabulous! I never seem to have enough honey on hand so I just use sugar and it turns out great. I cut down the Parm cheese to about 2 tablespoons. No anchovy paste either! =) DELICIOUS and EASY!

Not that thia needs another one...but 5 stars all the way. I'm ashamed that I was buying jarred, mediocre pizza sauce for $1.99 when I could have spent about 40 cents and made absolutley delicious sauce! Learned my lesson :)

I followed the recipe exactly, left out the optional anchovy paste ...The honey comes thru so strong, not only is the sauce sweet, it has a honey FLAVOR ... I like honey on cornflakes, in my oatmeal and a touch in my tea, but NOT on my pizza ... I picked this recipe b/c it has so many good ratings, even tho' it seemed a little odd, but I'm wondering how many of those people did this recipe as stated ... I cannot IMAGINE that people really like this sauce with that honey flavor.

Perhaps it is a regional issue, but sadly, the recipe does not live up to its name.  A more fitting title might be "Marginally Platable Pizza Sauce."  The only ingredient I left out was the fish paste (I love anchovies, but wasn't sure if it would go over well with non fish eaters).  The flavor isn't bright enough, though I don't know what would have improved it, either.

I definitely give this all five stars!  It's perfect for a quick supper using french or other artisan bread.  I prefer day-old as it absorbs more of the sauce.  Keep a package of turkey pepperoni or Canadian bacon, some lower fat cheeses (or not) and you've got a supper that even works for surprise guests.  Given time, I sauce the bread in the morning ... or even the evening before and refigerate until time to add meats, cheeses, etc.
Oh!  I've not had lots of luck finding anchovy paste, so I've substituted pesto and decreased the honey to 1 T.  Takes us right to yummy-town!

This is the only pizza sauce we use now. It's so simple to make fresh every time, and so delicious, why use store bought? Seriously, it only takes 5 minutes to throw together. I need to cut the red pepper flakes out for my husband's sake, and I put about 1/2 tsp of salt (it just says "to taste", this happens to be my "taste"), and only 1 Tb of honey. We often have just cheese pizza and can really enjoy the flavor of the sauce. It helps if you have a small whisk when you're mixing the sauce. We always only have shredded Parmesan and it works great.

Really good!  I roasted garlic instead of using the powdered stuff, and doubled the recipe as others suggested.  The leftovers (plenty for a third, and perhaps enough for a fourth pizza) are in the freezer for the next time.

I left out the anchovy paste, traded agave nectar for the honey, and only did 1 Tbsp of it.  I'm glad, because it was sweet enough.  I really liked it, but it was lacking something.  The next time I made it I added twice the oregano it called for, which helped, but I think I'm going to keep tweaking it here and there until it achieves perfection!

I gave it two stars for effort, but sorry, real sauce uses tomatoes--either blanched (fresh) or canned.  I'm Italian and from New York...I'd be shot in the knees if I ever served this one up.

This should be called "Exquisit Pain in the Neck Pizza Sauce."  After I made it and gave it taste my eyes crossed because it was too sweet.  Besides, it was not herby enough.  The red pepper was great.  I did not want to dump it since I had doubled the recipe so I tried to fix it.  I ended up with so much pizza sauce that was still to sweet and tasted wierd that I dumped it.  
I suggest using 1/2 tsp of all the herbs,  double the garlic, and CUT THE HONEY.  The recipe as it is will not get a 5 star rating from me.

This was so tasty, the best pizza sauce I have ever tasted.  I left out the anchovy paste.  I discovered it is too spicy with the red pepper flakes, but without just right.  I didn't think it was too sweet at all.  I used it on Jay's pizza crust.

This sauce was very flavorful, but the recipe did not make enough for a whole pizza.  I stretched the recipe by adding a can of plain diced tomatoes, which worked nicely- but I will double it next time!

This sauce is VERY sweet.  It was a great sauce (I didn't have cayenne pepper or anchovy paste so I omitted them) but quite sweet.  On a pizza the cheese hides the sweetness a bit, but it's way to sweet for dipping breadsticks.  Now I make it with a little bit of brown sugar and no honey and it turns out great.

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe as written and thought it was so bad that after adding more sauce to it and still not being able to stand it, I ended up just dumping it down the drain.  This time I left out the honey, cayenne, and red pepper flakes and it was much, MUCH better.

I grilled my own pizza for father's day yesterday.  With homemade dough and loads of toppings plus this sauce I was told I should open my own pizzeria.  I did roast the garlic beforehand and reduce the honey a bit, but it works well the original way as well.  Instead of anchovy paste I used wortchershire sauce for the savory component

*UPDATE* I made this again tonight omitting the honey and using just 1 teaspoon sugar, doubling the red pepper to 1/4 teaspoon. Pizza Nirvana! In fact, it's so good I couldn't stop sampling it right out of the bowl. This sauce would be fabulous over meatballs, ravioli or any old pasta. I'm going to try it next week with some ground beef as a meat sauce. I may never go back to the long-cooking, made with all fresh vegetables and spices again. This is really good! *ORIGINAL REVIEW*Not horrendous, as some reviewers said. Decent, but far too sweet. I will definitely make again, subbing 1 tsp. sugar instead of the honey. 2 tablespoons is just way too much. This is a good base to tweak, and couldn't be simpler to make.

Good. But used tomato sauce instead of paste which left it watery. Next time I'll reduce the water to compensate or just get the tomato paste.

Wow, this was really exquisite!  I just omitted a few ingredients, just because I didn't have them and it was a Friday night and I didn't want to run to the grocery store! I omitted the anchovy paste and marjoram. Also used a little less honey, I didn't want it to be too sweet.  It really turned out excellent!  Bye bye Ragu! Thanks Angie!

I made this exactly as written.  I will for sure make again with one change.  Next time I'm only adding 1T honey.  It was a little too sweet for our taste.  Other than that, it's great.  Just the right heat level and the spices were perfect.

Very disappointed. Give the positive reviews, I was excited to try this sauce. I felt the sauce was way too sweet. Additionally, the basil and oregano (generally considered the hallmarks of a pizza sauce) were under-represented in the final flavor as they were overwhelmed by the honey and onion powder. This might be a fine recipe if it were titled "sweet onion sauce," but if you are expecting a traditional pizza sauce, you'll be disappointed.

Don't prepare more than a day in advance as it gets a chunky consistency & doesn't taste as good. I substitute fish sauce for the anchovy paste & it's just as good.

My search has ENDED!!!!  I have been looking for a great pizza sauce for years that didn't change taste after baking in the oven, or that turned out too sweet.  This sauce is the GREATEST!!!!  I did follow the recommendation on using less honey than called for (I used about 1 teaspoon or less) but other than that -- this sauce is soooooooo good!!!  My husband and I LOVED it!!!  Thanks so much for your contribution Angie!!

After this sat for a bit I tried it and was not overly impressed, but after I cooked it on the pizza....really, truly, exquisite.  I would not add the honey next time.  A bit too sweet for my liking, but without the honey will be my go-to pizza sauce from now on.

This was a great recipe. With all the negative reviews regarding the sweetness of the sauce I was worried about it. I'm glad I decided to go ahead and make the sauce because It was one of the best that I've made. I didn't have anchovy paste so I just used a pinch of sea salt salt in its place. All the flavors blend it well together. Make sure to use exact amount of ingredients this recipe calls for and please let it simmer for the time allocated. If you do this, it will come out amazing.

This is the 1st time using this recipe, and will use again. This sauce leaves room for interpretation. I didn't have minced garlic, so I used the same amount of garlic salt instead. So far it tastes great. This sauce may be a little spicy for some people. Anchovy paste? It sounds disgusting it even looks disgusting -  USE IT anyway. Make the sauce; it's simple, inexpensive and restaurant quality. Then the next time you make it... play with it; add stuff, omit stuff, use a different measurement it's worth the extra effort. Thank you Angie Gorkoff.  small tip: if you open the can of tomato paste on both ends, it will just slide right out.

I have been trying all kinds of pizza sauce only to fall back on Trader Joes brand in a jar. I just made pizza dough this weekend & I found this recipe. I am an east coast woman & I know what great pizza tastes like. I decided to try this because I already had everything in my pantry. I used Cento tomato paste which has a more tart taste to it so these ingredients really balanced out the paste. I followed it to the letter not leaving anything out. I let it sit for an hr before using. I wish I would have used a little more on the crust but there was plenty left over for another crust. This is really delicious & very authentic. For people who love to eat & make pizza, you just can't go wrong. Don't halve anything in this recipe. The honey & anchovies paste balance each other & it was not overly sweet. My rule in trying a new recipe is to not change a thing even if you're out of an ingredient. It lessens the integrity of the recipe if you do. That said, it's a keeper!

This was a good start, but definitely way too sweet.  I even cut back the honey to 1 Tbs based on other reviews.  Next time I will try 1 tsp of sugar instead of the honey.  I added more oregano, marjoram and basil for more of an Italian taste.  I sauteed fresh garlic and onion in olive oil and then simmered the sauce for about 20 minutes since I do not like the taste of a "raw" sauce.  I allowed it to cool for a few hours before using.  I didn't have the anchovy paste, so I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used 1/4 tsp of Worchesteshire. There's definitely potential in this sauce.  It's just going to need a few more tweeks.  The spicy level was just fine for me.
UPDATE:  I changed the honey to white sugar and cut it down to just a tad less than 2 tsp, and this was perfect with the previous modifications I made.  Great recipe now!!!

Overall it is a great recipe! I would love to taste it as a dip with bread or cheese sticks. On the pizza it came out a little bit to sweet for me. So next time i will skip the honey!

I didn't have marjoram or anchovy paste but I don't think it made a difference.  It did the job!  I've made it twice now and will probably keep it as my go to recipe.

Absolutely delicious and so easy. Who would have thought just tomato paste and water form the base of the sauce?

I skip the anchovy paste and add 1/4 t of salt to account for that. The first time I made this recipe I used the full amount of honey, but now I halve it because it is just too sweet for me otherwise. My hubby likes the sweetness, though. I never have red pepper flakes on hand, so I don't use those, either.

I adore this recipe--so easy and it freezes really well!

I thought this was really good!  I thought the honey would make it sweeter than it was...it was pleasantly spicy.  I didn't use anchovy paste.  Thanks for the recipe!  I'll use this from now on when I make pizza.

This was soooo good!  My hubby has never liked any sauce I've used on homemade pizza so I'd pretty much given up.  He loved this....I will definitely make again!

very good although I only use a very small squirt of honey or agave nectar because the recipe as written was too sweet for my taste.  I make this every Friday for Pizza Friday!

This was decent, but not really "exquisite," IMHO. Wanting to use my recently purchased Boboli pizza crust and 2 remaining chicken sausage links (Chef Bruce Adiells Italian chicken sausage with mozzarella), I was on the lookout for a sophisticated pizza sauce to jazz up a plain 'ol everyday pizza. While this wasn't terrible, I think I prefer my standby  pizza sauce a little better (a TOH recipe, also on this site). I personally think this would be better suited for dipping breadsticks as it reminds me a lot of the "Hut's" famous sauce (I often crave their breadsticks just because of the yummy sauce!). All in all, this was good, but I think I'll use it for dunking rather than spreading on a pizza crust. Thanks for sharing, Angie! :-)

I made the recipe exact, only doubling it BUT I did not double the honey. After taste-testing the sauce, I did add more spices. Next time I make it, I'll increase the garlic from the get-go and use fresh minced onion. We thought this was very good--it just needs more spice. I'll use this recipe again. The honey was a nice touch.

I like my sauce a little sweet, so I made exactly like the recipe and it turned out fantastic.  I made eight 8" pizzas and had plenty of sauce.  Have made twice sofar and will continue to make this recipe.

Like many of the other reviewers this sauce was a bit on the sweet side and I even cut the recommended amount in half.  Will make it again without any honey.  It was my first homemade sauce, so overall, very good.

Great texture.  Just a little to spicy once cooked so I would add one or the other of the peppers.  We didn't have a problem with it being to sweet, I checked on our regular store bought sauce and sugar is the second ingredient which surprised me.

Yum! This is really good. I doubled the recipe and added the honey slowly, I couldn't find anchovy paste so I left it out. Let it sit in the fridge for a few hours  before using and the flavor was really perfect. Thanks!

This was a good starting point for a pizza sauce.  However, it was too sweet for our taste.  The next time, I will add the honey at the end so that I can adjust according to the sweetness of the tomato paste.  I will also add more basil, oregano, marjoram and salt.

Meh. Too sweet, a little too spicy, and the basil to oregano proportions seemed off.  Won't use again.

I just made this recipe today after finally getting tired of paying too much money for canned sauce.  I omitted the cayenne and the anchovy paste.  I used sugar instead of honey.  I made six recipes so I could freeze extra in ice cube trays for a quick sauce for pizzas.  I used 1/2t salt, 1 1/2 T fresh garlic, 1/2t garlic powder, 1/4t red pepper flakes and 3T sugar for the entire 6 recipes I made.  I combined all ingredients except for the cheese in a medium size pot.  I simmered the sauce for about an hour.  I then allowed the sauce to cool quite a bit before adding the cheese.  The sauce was the best sauce I have EVER had for pizza.  It was far superior to sauce I have bought in a car or jar.  It was even better than sauce from restaurants.  This is my new holy grail pizza sauce recipe!  Thanks Angie!

I added extra black pepper, which made it more flavorful.  I also substituted 2 oz of the water for olive oil, and one oz of the water for Vermouth cooking wine.  Made it taste sweet and delicious.  Definitely a keeper, even for those who don't usually enjoy pizza sauce!

Really enjoyed the flavor and this will be my new recipe. I think I would cut back on the honey next time due to personal preference. Same thing with the pepper flakes. I like that kick occasionally but don't prefer it on a regular basis. My husband does but he can add it to the pie :)

I have made this recipe twice now. The honey is a nice addition, but it makes the sauce overly sweet. My kids complained that it was spicey, but they are spice weenies.   For the second batch, I used less honey and much less cayenne. It was good.

Excellent sauce!  I did not have tomato paste so I used tomato sauce instead.  I left out the anchovy paste and cut back on the honey to about 1 t.  It was perfect!  I should add that I doubled this recipe as I was making a large pizza (11" X 17") and knew that 1 batch would not be enough.

I really can't believe how easy this was to make. It was REALLY good, a nice kick to it with the red peeper flakes. The only thing I omitted was the anchovy paste. Next time I make this I will double it and freeze in single-serving portions for when we make pizzas. GREAT recipe! Oh, this does make plenty...I used it to top two pizzas and we still have some left over :)

LOVE IT!  So easy, so simple, yet so yummy!  I make as is, w/out the optional anchovy paste, and w/out marjoram (just don't have it in our spice cabinet).  I will never buy pizza sauce again!

Sorry, but way too sweet and overspiced.  I just wanted a nice normal pizza sauce, not some wacky creation that my teen would have come up with.  Should have known from the ingredient list, but the reviews were so high.  Pass on this one.

My husband and I really enjoy this pizza sauce, but when we took it to a family dinner they weren't impressed. I cut down the cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes by 1/4 and still tasted fine.

This is absolutely amazing. I added everything except the marjoram (because I didnt have it). I doubled the recipe for once of the Jay's Signature Crust pizzas from here and instead of letting it sit. i let the sauce simmer for about 15min. This is sweeter than your typical pizza sauce.

I would probably rate this a 4 and 1/2 if possible. Not the best, but definately the best I've made. I added cooking wine to the water, and added oregano leaves to the top. Will definately make again.

I love this pizza sauce! It's super-easy and the best part is - you don't have to cook it! I make pizza once a week and my family loves the new flavorful pizza sauce! Delicious! As noted by a previous reviewer - i scaled the serving size to 100 - and store it in a spice jar. I taped a note to the jar to use the amount needed for 1x the recipe. I use i can of tomato paste, 6oz. water....and I add 2 tsp. of the spice mixture! i let the mixture "mingle" for atleast an hour. fantastic! I have even used this spice mixture as a "go-to" italian spice. I leave out the anchovy paste. The sweetness from the honey doesn't bother me n the pizza. When i try this sauce on something else - i might make adjustments to the honey.

As some people on here are saying it WAS too sweet but there was also another weird taste about it that I couldn't put my finger on so therefore I can't fix it and I won't be making this again. Waste of pizza and time.

I really like this sauce. It is the best homemade pizza sauce I have made to date. I put in just one teaspoon of honey and still,the sauce was sweet. Next time I am going to forego honey all together. I think that the tomato paste will always keep this sauce sweeter than other sauces. I may try using beer instead of water next time to see if I can cut the sweet that way...For those of you who have found the sauce too runny, I discovered that extra Parmesan cheese will thicken up the sauce really well - so keep this in mind if you like your sauce more on the hearty side. I made this pizza sauce and put in on the Grilled Pizza I recipe from this site and it was terrific!

So easy and professional tasting. I used half the honey as per other reviewers and italian seasoning instead of the basil/marjoram/oregano. Did not have anchovy paste but it was still great tasting.

Great tasting sauce. Very quick & easy to make. I omitted the Parmesan cheese & will use less honey next time. Froze the leftover sauce in ice cube trays for future use.

I make pizza every weekend.I have a pizza stone and I make my own dough and sauce.(I have another sauce recipe that I make often),but I wanted to try this one,because it sounded good.It is excellent,but I'm giving it a 4*, because we like a very spicy sauce and I had to increase all the herbs & garlic. I even added ground up fennel seed, (this  gives pizza sauce a very good flavor, if you haven't tried it yet)& added 1/2 t. italian seasoning,  I decreased the onion pwd to 1/2t, but  added all  the other ingredients and let it set for  1 hr at room temp--I did not find it too hot or sweet. I heat my honey up so its not so thick.Its a great recipe--I  made an italian sausage,pepperoni,onion,peppers, mushrooms and  black olive pizza last night --yuumy! and I had sauce  leftover, so I froze it. I will make this sauce again!

This was really good, though I admit I didn't use it for pizza! Instead, I doubled the recipe, but instead of two cans of tomato paste, I did one paste, one tomato sauce. I was out of honey, so I did a tablespoon of brown sugar instead and added about 1 1/2 tsp. of Italian seasoning. Simmered it on the stove. Served this over penne pasta, and it was spicy and delicious!

I finally found a pizzaria style sauce-thank you!  However, I was fixing 4 pizza's and since this makes 4 servings, I tripled the recipe.  Let me just say I am happy to have enough left over for 2 more pizzas and conclude that this recipe will cover 2 large pizza's liberally.  I left out anchovie paste.  I halved the honey and red pepper (kids) and I added only 1 extra ingredient and it was roasted red peppers that I blended in the sauce.  It was PERFECT!  The only sauce I will ever use from here on out.  THANKS!!!

This was a great sauce - easy to make and very flavorful. Following other reviewer's suggestions, I cut the honey in half the first time I made it, and it was STILL too sweet! Now I put in only 1/4 of the honey, and that's perfect. Enjoy!

Best sauce recipe I've found.  Extremely quick and easy...and even better than the cooked sauces I've made.  Like many others, I reduced the honey to 1 TBSP.  I also added slightly more water and a tsp. of extra virgin olive oil.

5 stars for both taste and ease of preparation.  I've never even thought of making my own pizza sauce before, but last night I wanted pizza for supper and had none so I came to allrecipes for a try.  I am so glad I picked this one as it is delicious and easy.  I didn't have any anchovy paste and I increased the herbs and spices by at least double.  The result was exquisite.  Will never buy pizza sauce again.  It was even better the next day on the left overs.  By the way, 2 tbsp of honey is definitely not too sweet, goes great with the spicy cayenne pepper.  I also finely minced some vidalia onion in the sauce.  I had enough sauce for 2 twelve inch pizzas.  Five stars all the way.

This sauce is the bomb!!  I made pizza bread sticks for the Superbowl and used the sauce for the breadsticks and for dipping the breadsticks!  I doubled the recipe and added one can of Rotel Diced Tomatoes and Green Chiles to it.  I did not use the anchovy.  It was well received by all!!  Great recipe!!

The name of this sauce is certainly appropriate. Using suggestions from other reviewers, I have found the perfect pizza sauce. Since I prefer my sauce chunky, I used a 15oz. can of petite diced tomatoes, 6oz. tomato paste, & 6oz. water. With the exception of using more garlic & omiting the anchovy paste (only because I didn't have any), I did not change anything else. This sauce is sweet...which I like..but also has a bite to it. Thanks for a great recipe; this one's definitely going in my recipe box...it's a keeper.

I doubled all this recipe and took the advice of some of the previous reviews.  I added NO red pepper flakes and used only half the anchovy paste, honey, black and red peppers.  I did add a little extra minced garlic and substituted 4 Tbsp. white wine for part of the water.  I thought this was a very good sauce but still a little sweet even with only half the honey.  My family raved about the pizzas and just yesterday as my husband was having leftovers he remarked, "I think it's the sauce that makes it so good."  Next time I think I'll leave out the honey but an excellent sauce recipe!

This stuff is flat out amazing.  I love it.  The combination of sweet with a very mild kick is just excellent.  I made a double batch which I used for pizzas.  I used "pizza dough" which can be found on this site and loaded it up with ingredients.  The pizza was unreal but I can't wait to try a simpler pizza with fewer ingredients so I can get a better taste of the sauce.  When I tasted the sauce after mixing, it took real discipline to keep from eating the whole stinkin' bowl.  I made a double batch and did not use the anchovy paste.  I don't know what anchovy paste is and I don't wish to find out.
This recipe is a real winner!!

WAY good! As others have mentioned it doesn't make much sauce so I doubled everything but the honey.  In fact, for the double recipe I only used one tablespoon of honey and it was great for us! We like our food a little spicy and it was perfect.  For those with a palate that leans toward the more mild the additional honey would work well.

I used oregano and basil from our herb garden so I had to up those spices quite a bit but the additional green bits floating about are gorgeous! 

I am Italian and have been cooking Italian food for ages and this is one of the best sauces I have ever stumbled across!  Try it!!!

This pizza sauce rivals any take-out/delivery or store-bought sauce. I had all of the ingredients on hand and it turned out perfectly! I didn't find the honey to be to sweet as the anchovy paste balanced it out. I will be using this recipe every time I make pizza!

The best homemade pizza sauce i have  tried so far. I actually mix the spices in bulk and use a tablespoon or two, since finding them all can take some time. Like the recipe says the anchovy paste is optional, i only use half and it tastes just as good. It's good with and without the pepper flakes, but our family tends to like it without.

I love this as written! Now normally I have to double or triple because we have a large family. The last time I tried a can of crushed tomatoes instead of the paste and water. That was awesome too!

My go-to pizza sauce recipe. I omit the honey because my kids think it makes the sauce taste funny and I add fresh herbs when I have them. So easy and yummy.

This is fantastic. The best I've ever made. I followed the recipe exactly and agree with the previous reviewer who said he could eat it out of the bowl with a spoon. Next I'll try some fennel seeds but as-is this recipe is amazing. For folks worried about the anchovy paste, don't be. Your sauce won't taste like a can of anchovies smells. It mainly adds salt and savory flavor. You'd never guess there was anchovy paste in there. It all just works. Hey, no guts no glory! :-)

This pizza sauce is unmistakably sweet, but our family loves it.  We prefer it to store-bought pizza sauce.  I use an 8 oz can of tomato sauce instead of the tomato paste/water combination.  I omit the anchovy paste and chili power and flakes, add 1/4 t. of thyme and double the pepper.  I also cook it in the microwave for 3 minutes instead of letting it sit for 30 minutes.  We use this sauce for pizza sauce and breadstick dipping sauce.  If you are worried about the sweetness, just add the honey last, and to taste.

I follow this recipe to the T and I think it's great. I remember thinking when I made it for the first time that it wouldnt turn out.  The taste is strange in its raw form, but onces it's slathered onto pizza dough and baked into the over its perfect.  Sweet, salty, and spicy.  I too make a double batch and freeze what I dont use for next time.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Delicious sauce, just a tad too sweet.  Reduce the honey by 1 tablespoon and it would be perfect.

I really really REALLY liked all the flavors in this sauce.  It did come out a little sweet, which I was not fond of, but once all the salty toppings and cheese went on top of it, it mostly balanced out.  The sweet was my fault, there was a little mishap with the honey and I think I wound up adding closer to 3tbsp.  I took Northstar's suggestion and added some white wine to the warm water (also sweet).  I will definitely make this again.  I'm interested to see what it tastes like when I don't glob honey everywhere and when I'm prepared with a less-sweet wine.  Portion-wise, I had enough to cover two of those pre-made crusts you get at the grocery store and two personal sized crusts.  I guess I spread the sauce really thin!

I made this from ingredients I had on hand which was everything except the anchovy paste. Other than that & maybe a few extra red pepper flakes since I like spicy this was prepared exactly as directed. It was really good but I could detect a hint of honey in the background which doesn't exactly pair well with pepperoni. If I do this again I'd probably add an equal amount of sugar to the water and make a weak simple syrup instead. I also might consider adding a couple of teaspoons of olive oil.

First time I made this, I followed the recipe to a "T" - incorporating all the ingredients, lab precise measurements, etc. It's still way too sweet and it tastes very much like tomato paste. I may not be Italian but I'm Mediterranean, and I've made pizza that my Italian friends beg me for. (Donatella and Paola, are both on Allrecipes and they can vouch for me). 

I'm guessing this recipe got so many high ratings because it was featured and promoted. I'd not give it five stars as the recipe is stated. Unless you are used to buying ready-made sauces. This recipe needs a lot of doctoring. I refused to throw it out so I added fresh tomatoes. Tomato paste will always have that canned taste, especially a full 6 oz. can. I used fresh Roma tomatoes sautéed in olive oil with garlic, onion and a pinch of sugar and the anchovy paste (if you like it; if not omit). Once this became aromatic, I added the herbs. I use oregano, basil, and marjoram to taste. 

This is not a bad recipe for pizza sauce; it just doesn't deserve the 5 stars. Especially when made "as-is".

Such a wonderful, no fail pizza sauce!  Didn't have anchovy paste, so omitted that, as well as omitting the crushed red pepper & cayenne.  To compensate for the reduced "heat " in this revision, reduced honey to 1 TSP, and subbed extra oregano for marjoram.   Mixed at room temperature and used on flattened Rhodes dinner rolls with string cheese to make mini "Mummy" pizzas. They were soooooo good....everyone enjoyed as part of our 2014 Halloween dinner buffet....so delicious...try it, you will love it!

This sauce was really good! To save time and $ I bought the "italian tomato paste" with basil and oregano. I also only put in a teaspoon of honey (I do not like sweet pizza sauce). And it was wonderful.

I love this sweet & spicy recipe. So easy to make & tasty. I followed directions exactly, also adding the anchovy paste. When I'm using fresh herbs, I double the amount. I don't like a ton of sauce on pizza (this recipe will last for 4-5 of my flatbread-style pizzas). Some reviewers complained about over sweetness or spiciness, but it was just perfect for our taste. It's not a sauce with a heavy herb flavor...if that's your thing then maybe look for a different recipe.

I store the leftover sauce in the fridge, and warm it in the microwave for 20-30 seconds and add a little water as needed before putting it on the pizza dough. I think the sauce is best freshly made, but it stays well in the fridge too (I keep it up to a week).

This is a great recipe for the 'keeper' file! With the exception of the anchovy paste, all of the ingredients are in our pantry at all times, so it is a great quick way to make a meal. 

If you don't care for the slight sweetness, a Tablespoon of the honey could be omitted. Don't forget that the taste will vary depending on which brand of tomato paste is used. Tomato paste, not sauce, and yes, there IS a difference. This recipe made enough sauce to cover a baker's half sheet of crust quite well. At first bite, we realized we would have to find a different crust than we used, one worthy of this sauce. Thank you!

Best pizza sauce thus far. I personalized mine a little but I love the fact I didn't have to cook it over the stove then in the oven with the pizza. Packed with flavor. Also great dipping sauce.

This is so good.   I've made it several times and it's so quick and easy.  It's hot, spicy and I love the sweetness (it's not too sweet at all).   I use it for pizza and pasta.  This is a keeper!  Thanks for sharing.

This is the best pizza sauce I've ever tasted and I use it with all my pizzas, calzones, and also use it as a dipping marinara. I skip the honey altogether because I personally don't enjoy any sweetener in my pizza sauce, but otherwise I follow this recipe precisely and have impressed many a dinner guest it. Many reviewers recommend preparing larger batches of the dry ingredients for later use (which is an excellent idea), but I will usually just mix up a quadruple batch of the full recipe and freeze a few portions in small freezer containers to thaw out before making my pizza. Thank you so much for this excellent, unbeatable recipe!

I'm sorry to say that I tried this recipe and didn't find it to be the greatest even though I made the change that everyone recommended by reducing the honey, and didn't add the cayenne so that it wouldn't be too hot.  I found that it left an aftertaste - probably from the anchovy paste.  So although it was good, it was not a great one.

I read all the comments and the only thing I did differently was to double the paste and water! I loved this and I've been looking for a homemade sauce for a long time. I omitted the anchovy paste because I didn't have any. I will try again and use it.

I made this a is, I didn't have the anchovy paste so I couldn't add it, but everything else is true to the recipe. This sauce has just the right amount of sweetness and spice. Keep the recipe the same and you will be doing yourself a favour. Great Sauce!

I thought this recipe was amazing, my family all gave it a thumbs up! The only thing I did differently was used tomato sauce instead of the water (same amount as water called for in recipe).

Next time I will leave out the cayenne and red pepper. My little ones (2 and 5) were grabbing their tongues because they don't like spicy food.

My wife could tell right away it was pizza sauce and not just another sauce used as a generic sauce.  My whole family enjoyed it.  I left out the sugar as we don't like sweet pizza sauce.

Just made this tonight for the first time and it was a smash hit!! I omitted the anchovy paste, and the red pepper flakes because I didn't want it to be too spicy for the kiddos,although I could see somebody who enjoyed a bit more kick liking the addition of the pepper flakes. It's great for picky kids because there is no "mystery chunks" in it. I'll never buy pizza sauce in a can again.

Just tripled this for a large batch to use tonight and try freezing a little bit and see how that turns out...thought it was great as is.  One thing I'm wondering about some of the "too sweet/spicy" is if they thought that after cooking it on the pizza? I know that fresh garlic is wicked spicy raw....? I didn't have and couldn't find anchovy paste- just fillets, so I threw them in the VitaMix with the water and garlic cloves and puréed it....seemed to work fine so far.

This is GREAT!  I don't know what the fuss about it being "too sweet" or "too spicy"; this was spot-on!  Loved it!  The only thing I didn't do was add anchovy paste, but that was because I didn't have it on hand.  Delicious!

I have wanted to try this recipe for quite some time.  I finally made this along with 'Jay's Signature Pizza Crust' from AR.  I made the sauce up in the morning, using my meat thermometer to reach the warm water temp of 110°.  I then refrigerated the sauce all day and let it come to room temp before topping the pizza crust.  My husband asked what brand of sauce I was using because he really liked it.  I did not use the anchovy paste this time, but I will give it a try next time.  I hear that it really adds a lot to the flavor with making it have a fishy smell/taste (my fear). This was the perfect amount of sauce to cover a large pizza.  Thanks Angie Gorkoff for sharing your recipe.

Wow...this is the best pizza sauce ever.  For a basic pizza with red sauce, this will always be the sauce I use.  It's really good for dipping breadsticks or the pizza crust too.  The pizza I made with this had to be the best pizza I've ever had. The children were sick of pizza and this even had them saying yum.

Not that this recipe needs more reviews but I figured I should leave one since I am always making this pizza sauce. I love it so much! Whenever I make it I always find myself having a few spoonfuls on the side because it is so tasty. Thank you!

Pretty good. A bit too sweet and too thick for my taste. Next time, thin it out a bit and reduce honey by half. Maybe a bit more garlic too.

Based on other's reviews, I added only half the honey (figured I would taste it at that point then add the rest after tasting if I thought it needed it) and that was PLENTY sweet enough.  A matter of personal preference tho.  The sauce was indeed outstanding and I will most certainly make it again.  I did not have anchovy paste on hand but will now make a point to pick some up and try it with that addition.   Everything else as written and my family was very, very pleased with the result!

One sniff and I could tell this sauce rocks. I didn't have marjoram or anchovy paste, and left out the honey because I hate sweet sauces. It was just perfect and will be my go-to recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly.  I felt it was too sweet and didn't have enough zing.  I made a cheese pizza with this.  The crust we made was excellent, but this sauce ruined it for us.  The kids wouldn't even eat it and cheese pizza is one thing they never turn down.

Great sauce and so easy!  I thought it was a bit too sweet, so I reduced the honey.  I also upped the spices because that is often what I do to really get some more flavor.

Sensational Sauce!  With the full amount of honey, it would have been too sweet for me, so I reduced the honey to 1 tsp. and it was perfect!  Thanks Angie!

Perfect for our tastes!  Paired with the Whole Wheat Honey crust from this site.  We are on a low sodium diet but love homemade pizza. This sauce worked great.  Used no salt added paste, omitted the anchovy paste ( didn't have any & too much salt anyway) Added salt substitute to taste.  Made it in the morning, let the flavors medl until dinner time.  It's a keeper in my book!

Very good. Simple to make. Halved the honey and paper. Was still sweet but not overpowering.

In one word DELICIOUS!!!! Omitted the tomato paste and water and just used two cans (6 oz. each) of tomato sauce.  Worked wonderfully!  Thank you for sharing.  : )

Really good. Next time I'll double the basil and oregano, and probably take the honey down to 1.5 tbsp rather than 2; it was just a little bit sweet for my taste. This was excellent on a veggie pizza with a whole wheat crust!

Who knew you didn't have to buy premade sauce??  This was a great option for pizzas.  I only used a very small amount and froze the rest.

Sorry, this was very bitter and something not quite right. Thankfully I tasted it before I put it on the pizza. Not sure why i'm even giving it two starts. Used the Easy Pizza Sauce I recipe instead.

I'm a huge fan! I added more garlic than the recipe calls for however in the future I may not do this since the leftover sauce used a few days later was nearly overwhelming with garlic. Great recipe and really quick!

It was good, but it was too sweet. I love sweet, so for me to say it was too sweet it had to be REALLY sweet.  I'll cut down on the amount of honey next time and then it might be perfect.

Great sauce with a fantastic depth of flavors!  I didn't have marjoram so I increased the basil and oregano and left out the anchovy paste.  This Sauce+Jay's Signature Pizza Crust+Cheese+Toppings=YUMMY!  I will never buy jarred sauce again.  Thanks Angie!

I put the cayenne down just a touch, because it was a pretty definitive flavor the first time. Once I lessened that a little, it was PERFECT. I'll never use another pizza sauce again. Thanks!

I tried this recipe several times now and each time I've had to revise it to my liking. I've omitted Anchovies in sauce. Then I went for using full amount of honey then went less then completely omitted it--WAY too sweet for my liking. Otherwise this recipe is GREAT.

I cut the amount of honey in half, used 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, and did not use any cayenne pepper. The sauce alone tasted too sweet, but when baked into a pizza, the sauce was really good! So, my advice is to give the sauce a chance, even if you think it tastes too sweet. It might end up being just right on a pizza!

I will never again buy pizza sauce. This is sooooo good. I use the anchovy paste even though I detest those little fish. It really adds something. I also omit or 1/2 the honey. Thank you so much for this recipe!

Beyond yummy. The only sauce I've used for years now. Even freezes well if you make a large batch. I always cut the honey in half because I like it a tad less sweet.

We've made this a couple times now. I've always cut back on the honey as it is a bit sweet for our taste. DH made this on his own yesterday not having read the reviews and used the full amount of honey. It was sweet. @ Snack Cake - but when I tasted it at room temp I thought it tasted like a pasta sauce - still I would cut back on the sweetness, which ever way one chooses to sweeten (honey, sugar or substitute). I think this is a great pizza sauce and recipes are meant to be customized to one's preferences/requirements.

LOVE this pizza sauce.  If your kids are sensitive to spice (hot), you may want to reduce the red pepper flakes just a bit.  I use this recipe every time I make pizza.

This sauce is so super easy to make and is so incredibly good you could just eat it with a spoon. Great for a pizza, dipping or over whole wheat pasta. The possibilities are endless... enjoy! =)  Thanks for sharing.

When prepared as written, this gets 4 stars. It tastes great, but it's a little grainy. Modifying the technique creates a much smoother sauce that deserves 5 stars. First, saute garlic in about 1 T olive oil. Add water, then parmesan cheese, then everything else except tomato paste. Simmer about 5 minutes. Add tomato paste, then simmer another 5 minutes. This helps the cheese and spices dissolve.
I recommend reducing water by 1/3-1/2 if using a lot of veggies. That reduces the yield, of course, but prevents a watery pizza. I like to use this for pizza pot pies. I can make 3 individual pies after my modifications.
Enjoy!
Update: Our tastes have changed over the years, and we now feel that it's too sweet with even half the honey. We've started omitting the honey and the cayenne.

Made as directed.  It is very sweet.  If I make this one again, I will cut the honey in half and see if that makes a huge difference on the sweetness.  Will also up the spices.  Did not use the anchovy paste.  Made this with Valentino's pizza crust from this site.

This sauce did not taste like any pizza sauce I have ever had. We did not like it. It was too hot and too sweet. Sometimes you can get both flavors and it works. We didn't think it worked here.  A couple of notes: first, notice that this is for four servings only. The two main ingredients, tomato paste and water, total a cup and a half of liquid. I quadrupled for two big pizzas, partly because I had 12-ounce cans of paste. It yielded more than I needed. Doubling would have probably been enough. (I went for too much rather than too little, figuring I could freeze leftover sauce.) Second, cayenne can very greatly in hotness. If I had put the right amount based on the recipe, it would have been way too hot because we buy the hotter cayenne (Scofield rating). Third point: anyone who used tomato sauce instead of paste really changed the recipe significantly and their rating won't be applicable to someone using paste. Tomato paste is made from tomatoes cooked way down and is very concentrated and sweet. Tomato sauce is from tomatoes cooked for a shorter period of time and usually has salt and spices added. Even puree is different enough to make the rating inaccurate. Fourth: It isn't that hard to chop some onion and saute in a little oil. I would do that rather than use onion powder. Finally, the high ratings mystify me.  This yields such a weird tasting sauce....

We loved it! Used tomato sauce (12 oz) instead of tomato paste (apparently ours was a bit too old! lol), and left out the red pepper flakes. But it was a huge hit with my mother in law and husband! Thanks for a great recipe!

I will definitely make this again - it was so easy to make.  I used one small clove of garlic and left out the cayenne.  I'm going to experiment with fresh herbs when spring gets here, I can only imagine it will be even better!

I made this exactly as written, which involved  pulling out a LOT of ingredients from the pantry.  I may not be an expert cook, but I was curious why the water needed to be 100 degrees?  When making pizza crust with yeast, I get it, but didn't understand why this was important with sauce.  Thought marjoram was kind of a strange spice for pizza sauce, and we did not like the honey flavor.  I ended up having to add a bit more water, as it was way too thick.  This was OK, but I think I'll continue looking for a homemade pizza sauce rather than tweaking this to my satisfaction.

I enjoyed this - it's healthy overall and easy. I didn't use anchovy paste and liked that it was optional. I added a bunch of spices and a little more black pepper than it called for. Very good! We won't use the premade stuff again!

It's the sum of the parts, not the individual ingredients that make this an OUTSTANDING pizza sauce. If you are omitting the anchovy paste, you are tampering with a vital ingredient. IMO the only ones to vary are honey and pepper flakes. I have made this receipe 100+ times and it is always a hit. Whether it's for family or friends. I also DO NOT like anchovies. I love Caesar salad and this sauce, both of which have anchovies.

For a no-cook pizza sauce, this recipe is great!  I am updating my review, because I have made this several times over the years and it has great flavor for something you can whip up real fast and not have to worry about simmering it for hours to get flavor.  Great and easy!  Thank you for the recipe!

This is the best pizza sauce *EVER*. Thanks Angie!!! The only step I added was to simmer the sauce for about 1/2 hour before using. YUM!

This sauce?  Amazing.  Seriously amazing.  We love a bit of heat in our recipes and this sauce serves it up with a subtle hit that is powerful, without being overpowering.    I've made this sauce exactly as stated, minus the anchovy paste--it's a vegetarian thing--and it never fails to garner compliments from my boyfriend and my 9 y/o daughter.  I'd advise keeping the honey to temper out the heat of this sauce.  It's a nice balance.  I've also changed it up by adding a splash or two of red wine.  The only thing I do change is the proportions of the ingredients to make a triple batch each time.  We never seem to eat just one pizza round these parts. :)

Really good.  I took the advice of other posts and doubled the recipe to make my two pizzas -totally unnecessary!  I half half left over and froze it.  We LOADED on the sauce too.  My pizzas were only 12", though. Awesome sauce.  I left out the anchovy paste becasue I couldn't find any, and added a bit more marjoram than called for.  Awesome.

WOW! This sauce is simply wonderful! We make pizza here at least once a week and I am so excited to find this recipe, especially since the ingredients are pantry staples. The dried spices I had weren't as fresh as I like so I substitued an Italian blend I use more frequently and I am very happy with the result. Thanks so much!!

I made my own sauce for years and it was *almost* exactly like yours, but I'd never added honey, anchovy paste or marjoram...just the addition of those few ingredients makes this absolutely exquisite! Thanks...I'll never make another pizza sauce now.

I made this exactly as stated. It tastes great! It made enough for two pizzas. I spread the sauce thin with a frosting spreader which I found works best. Pizza restaurants do not put "globs" of sauce, they spread it thin. Add two cups of Italian mixed shredded cheeses and top with your favorite pizza toppings. Bake according to the instructions for your dough and you will have a perfect restaurant style pizza.

This is a truly exquisite pizza sauce! I left out the red pepper flakes and the anchovy paste and cut the amount of honey just taste it and add what you like. I have never had good luck with red pepper flakes I have ruined several dishes so I just don't use them. Everyone loves this, its so quick and simple, the grandkids beg me to fix it. I just can't find a good pizza dough recipe. I have tried Jay's signature pizza dough several times and must be doing something wrong=taste good but the texture is not good. Any suggestions? Try this taste as you go make it your own and your family will love it! Great cooking to all!

This is my favorite pizza sauce!  I make pizza every week and I always use this sauce.  The only change I make is that I double the amount of tomato paste and water, but keep all other ingredients the same.

This is the absolute best sauce ever.  I actually made it and put it on flour tortillas- flat bread pizza.  My husband was skeptical and afterward he said I had made a believer out of him.  We will continue making this... i used agave (1/2 of what was called for) Amazing!  We also used pizza seasoning in place of the separate herbs.  Yummy!

WOW, this was very tasty with Jay's pizza crust.  I was out of onion powder and fresh garlic, so I used minced onion and garlic powder and didn't add the honey.  Although it tasted good after mixing, let sit for a few hours in the refrigerator and WOW.  Next time I'll add more heat as we like things with a nice kick.  I will not buy the jarred pizza sauce again.

Great recipe, pizza coniseurs in my family loved this. To extend the I tripled it by adding 1 15oz can of drained chunky tomatoes and tripled the rest of the recipe, except the dried red pepper falkes, only added 2 tps and omitted the cayenne and water and only 3 tbs honey. The extra garlic was yummy.

I found this sauce overly sweet. As I had everything all together and just about ready to go I added more parmesan cheese, tomato paste and even a little store bought tomato sauce to tone down the sweetness. To further blend the flavours I simmered it on the stove for an extra 15 minutes as I spread out the dough. Everyone liked it but did mention that the heat from the cayenne was strong. I will probably make this sauce again and only change it to satisfy everyone. (I'm afraid I am the picky one here) Thank you for the recipe.

I had no expectations from this, as I've only used it since I forgot to buy sauce and only had paste on hand. Boy was I wrong! We used about a teaspoon of worcestershire sauce in place of the anchovy paste, to great success. I will never buy pizza sauce again!

This is very good!  No more store bought sauce for us!  I made this exactly as directed except for the anchovies--which I'm sure would have been even better, but it just wasn't worth the trip to the store.  I'll definitely get some for the next batch, though.  Thanks!

Really good.  I made the mistake and used sugar instead of honey and it made the sauce too sweet.  Will make with honey next time.  Also did not use anchovy paste.

This is so good, that from the first night I used it I immediately added hand-made pizza to our weekly meal plan. The flavor is amazing! Definitely not your run-of-the-mill pizza sauce.

This is now my official pizza sauce.  I used this with another recipe from the site, Jay's Signature Pizza Crust, and they work well together.  I followed the recipe exactly even searching out anchovy paste in the grocery store.  I wouldn't change a thing.  I got more sauce than I needed for one pizza, but probably not enough for two.  Although I don't like a whole lot of sauce.  This was great!  Thank you.

I used 15 oz tomato sauce instead of paste (did not add the water), omitted the marjoram, honey and anchovy paste (didn't have and didn't want to buy any) and this recipe was still the best I've tried!

Love this sauce! Alot of flavor, I only used about 1/2 tsp honey so it wasn't very sweet. I used it with Jay's Signature Pizza Crust and it was the best pizza I've made at home.

This has been a great sauce! I make it as is (double to freeze extras) and leave out the anchovy paste and use 1 Tbl of honey. I use it with Jay's Signature Pizza Crust from AR also. SO good!

This sauce is what I have been looking for in a homemade sauce!!  It is cheap and fast to make and very good.  I didn't have any parm or anchovy paste, so I omitted those.  Next time, I might do a little less honey because it was definitely sweet, but I like it like that.  This is my go to sauce.  I let it sit in the fridge for a few hours while I made the dough and the flavors were great.

5/18/09 I didn't have the anchovy paste & I wound up using a 15 oz can of tomato sauce instead of a 6 oz can of paste, but otherwise this recipe was perfect. I did add a little bit extra of everything since I used the 15 oz can of sauce (& no water) which wound up being a bit too spicy for me but perfect for the husband :) The best part is that you're not required to cook it at all. That is such an incredible time saver. 9/15/09 I use this recipe all the time now. I DID buy some anchovy paste, and it's worth putting it in there. Puts that little bit of something missing that turns tomato paste into pizza sauce instead of pasta sauce, IMO.

I gave this 5 stars, although I altered it according to other reviewers.   Didn't have tomato paste so I used puree with just a little water added. Switched the honey for 2-3 tsp. sugar, left out hot seasonings and just added medium chili powder.  This was awesome & will become my go-to pizza sauce!

Ok, I too will never purchase pizza sauce again! This sauce could not be any easier. I used 1/4 tsp of garlic powder instead of fresh garlic as I was out of garlic (go figure!). Also, I don't use marjoram in anything I cook so skipped that ingredient. In place of onion powder I used emeril's essence as I don't use onion powder either... The sauce is great and can totally be adapted to suit your taste. The cheese makes the sauce in my opionion, I was not sold on the sauce till I tasted it with the parm cheese.

I have never written a review before but felt it was necessary for this recipe.  I am the food service director for a large High School district.  We make our own pizza and recently my distributor didn't arrive with our sauce so, as panic set in I searched for a recipe online and luckily picked this site and proceeded to make a veryyyy large batch from this recipe.  It was quick to assemble, and luckily I had all the ingredients (except the honey - used a small amount of sugar instead.  I only used cayenne pepper and no pepper flakes.  I was worried it would be too hot, and must say the sauce is awesome.  The feedback from the students was great.  I am contemplating making this recipe for our pizza from now on, knowing how quick and easy it is verses purchasing ready made.  thank you

Its nearly perfect. I think the honey makes it a bit too sweet, so I only add a tablespoon of it, and up the oregano and cayenne pepper another 1/4 tsp to add a little more zip.

I followed the link to this recipe from the December '08 "Single Servings" column--made a few mini pizzas with the Whole Wheat and Honey Pizza Dough, topped with tons of veggies and then froze them.  They're great to have in the freezer, and the flavor of this sauce worked really well with the rest of the pizza.  I'm not usually a sauce fan, so I'm glad to have found one I like.  Plus, it's really nice to have homemade pizza on demand now!  Next time, I'll make more of them to freeze.

Yea!!!  I finally found a sauce to satisfy my anti-tomato-sauce hubby!  Unbelievable, but true.  I followed the recipe, except I eyeball everything, so I may have added more of some things and less of others - but not by much, so this recipe gets a hearty 5-star.  It's just perfectly spicy enough to make my kids notice, but not so spicy that it turned them off.  Everybody loved it!  Definitely will make again and again and again and...you get the point.  P.S.  I spread it on "Jay's Signature Pizza Crust," which was good, but time consuming for me.

Best tip from others:  make a large batch of the herbs and use just less than 2 tsp per batch. (I used garlic powder in place of fresh) Too much honey though, so I cut that in 1/2.  I used to eyeball all of these ingredients - now I have it all ready for me to just throw together.  Thanks!

FANTASTIC!! I always made out homemade pizza with jar sauce (not so homemade then, huh?!)...this sauce was beautiful!!!! I OMITTED THE HONEY and didn't replace it with sugar, and I didnt think it needed it, but I dont like sweet sauces. If you like it sweet, I would suggest a teaspoon of sugar. I WILL NEVER USE ANOTHER PIZZA SAUCE AGAIN!

Just got done trying this sauce out on a couple pizzas. It is just wonderful! Nice tomato-y flavor, not too strong on the herbs and spices and there was enough in one recipe to easily coat 3 12-inch pizzas with a little left over. Per the suggestions below, I cut the honey down to 1 Tablespoon and I didn't have any anchovy paste (though I'd have used it). I let the sauce sit for about an hour and a half and the flavors had blended very well. I think I'll make up a few batches, let it set overnight in the refrigerator and then divide it up for freezing. Thanks so much for this recipe!

Best Pizza Sauce EVER!!  So good I created a login just to comment on it.  I omitted the Anchovy Sauce and a bit less honey.  Other wise keep it all the same!!

LOOOOVE IT! I made this pizza sauce last night and followed the recipe as written (but portioned it for 12 servings). I was worried that I would run out of sauce, but in hindsight I wasn't thinking logically. LOL I made enough pizza dough ( Jay's Signature Pizza Crust from this website) for 1 large 16 in. pizza. What I was left with was a tub of extra sauce! You live and learn ;) Even with the addition of water stated in the recipe, the sauce re-solidified into a paste after being refridgerated overnight for use this evening. LOL I nuked it covered for a minute and gave it a stir and that's all it needed to get to the right consistency for smoothing it on the crust with the back of a serving spoon. Anyhow, this sauce was SUPER DELISH. I'd give it 6 stars if I could!

Excellent! I added some red wine to the water for a warmer flavor. I make pizza on our gas grill fairly often and this will be the recipe I use from now on. A keeper!

I decided to make this exactly as written, although I was very leery of some of the ingredients - honey, for instance and I usually don't care for basil in my pizza sauce.  I even made a special trip to the grocery store for anchovy paste. My recommendation?  Don't change a thing.  This is a five star recipe.  Do pay attention to the notation to add salt to taste.  I doubled my recipe and believe I added about 1/2 tsp. of salt.  If you double the recipe, I believe it makes enough to generously cover three good sized pizzas.  I felt that the recipe, as written makes a bit too much for just one pie.  Try Jay's Signature Pizza Crust from this site.  It's another winner.

Way too sweet with 2 Tbsp of honey as written. I cut it in half and tried again, but even 1 Tbsp of honey was too much. My husband kept asking, "why does this taste so sweet?"

This is fab! I did cut the honey in half and I left out the red pepper and cayenne, just personal preference. Don't leave out the anchovy paste! It provides a richness and depth, not a fishy taste at all. I love that I'll never have to buy canned pizza sauce again. Why buy second rate (or third rate) when it is so easy to make this wonderful stuff!

Wow, I was suprised by this because it got so many other great reviews. We did not care for this, the honey made it too sweet, and for whatever reason it was just too thick and goopy. Definitely will not make again.

This was as good as some of the unique sauces I've had on specialty pizzas at restaurants. Like others, I omitted the anchovy paste and the dried red pepper flakes and cut the honey in half. I let the flavors infuse together for about 2 hours in the refrigerator and I couldn't keep my tasting spoon out of the bowl while I was making the pizza with Pizza Dough I on this site. The finished product was worth raving about. Thanks for our new pizza sauce. No more store-bought when you can whip this up so quickly!

I followed the recipe as written except reduced the amount of honey to 1 Tbsp. and left out the cayenne pepper.  This is a great pizza sauce.  I had enough for 2 large calzone but would recommend scaling up if you plan to make more than 1 large pizza.

I have used this over and over again.  My husband would rather have this than take out pizza!  Thank you Angie for a simple and tasty pizza sauce.  I only use one tbsp. of honey and don't use anchovy paste.  Everything else stays the same.  We love it!

I didn't use the anchovy paste and I used 1/2 the honey and it came out perfectly.  I think if I would have used all of the honey, it would have been too sweet.  It was delicious, the best sauce I've ever made.

We liked this pizza sauce! I used tomato sauce instead of paste so I didn't add the water. I cut the honey to 1/2 t. and left out the anchovy paste. I put the left over sauce in the freezer for the next yummy pizza!

I made this last night. I thought it was pretty good. I let it sit in the fridge overnite so the flavors could marry.  I didnt use the anchovy paste because i didnt have any. But maybe thats what was missing. Because It was good, but not amazing. I will keep this recipe but will still keep looking

This is by far one of the best pizza sauce recipes!!!  I also use it for spaghetti and meatballs or lasagna.  

The first time I used it to make homeade pizza but I also used it for a dipping sauce with mozzarella sticks.

I didn't have anchovy paste and I cut the honey in half.  Also, I added a little more red pepper.  

I will always use this recipe!!!

What a fantastic recipe!  I will definitely not be buying store bought again.  It's so easy to make up a large batch of the dry ingredients, and throw them all together last minute. Definitely let them sit for half an hour to mix.  I have not bought anchovy paste, but we love it without it.  I might pick some up sometime just to see if it adds any flavor.  But it's fantastic without it!  And so incredibly easy!  It makes the perfect amount for one pizza, and it's also great for dipping the 'Mall Pretzels' recipe in.  A definite 5 stars!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Faaaantabulous! One thing I like about this recipe is that you can cut down on sodium by using no-salt-added tomato paste. The only flaw is it's a little sweet, but cutting the honey in half solves that.  I added extra red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit more, and I skipped the anchovy paste because I didn't have it on hand (but I'll try it next time). This was also great heated up and used as a dipping sauce for toasted cheesy bread.

My husband made this pizza sauce tonight and I must say I was very disappointed.  It was too sweet and also had too many spices, a taste overload.  My daughter and I could only eat 1 slice max, but my son and husband seem to enjoy it.  I'll give it 2 stars, max.  I'm now in search of a new sauce recipe.  Any suggestions?

This pizza sauce was excellent.  I added everything except the anchovy paste as I didn't have it.  I also eyeballed all the ingredients instead of measuring, and it still came out perfectly.  Very easy and good.

This was just awful. I cut the honey in half because a few reviews suggested it was too strong. It was still too strong. I will never make this again.

Really great! I use less honey and a little more red pepper for a spicy preference. It goes well with "Jay's Signature Pizza Crust".

Near perfect recipe.  I backed off a bit on the honey based on other reviews, and I'll back off a bit on the parmesan cheese next time.  If you use fresh grated cheese, it tends to overpower the sauce.

I'm so glad I followed the suggestions and only used half the honey.  It made the sauce plenty sweet enough.  I normally don't like sweeter sauces, but this is a really good recipe.  The sauce was not as thick as I thought it would be, but it turned out to be fine.  I think I've just found my new favorite pizza sauce.

I am VERY picky when it comes to pizza. The sauce was a tad too spicy, but can easily be remedied by reducing the quantity of peppper(s). 
I still haven't found a pizza dough I like, but I'll keep trying. Used 1 T. honey as suggested.

I VERY MUCH ENJOYED THIS SAUCE, EASY TO MAKE. I DID ADD THE ANCHOVY PASTE! THIS IS A SWEET SAUCE, YOU COULD LESSEN THE AMOUNT OF HONEY IF YOU DON'T WANT THE SWEETNESS.

Sauce recipe was very easy, however I was a little freer with the herbs as I love intense sauce.  I used 1/2 Tbs. anchovy sauce instead of the paste and salt.  I love the taste before cooking and wonder how I can intensify it more!  I could even take more pepper heat!  I did cut the honey and add 1 Tbs. white sugar as I like less sweet...you can cut the sugar if you like more savory flavors.

This is a wonderful sauce, and not at all hard to make. I made some more than a week ago and it's still great and hasn't started to separate. The only tip I have is that you substitute tomato sauce for some of the paste, or it might come out too thick and, well, pasty. Do NOT leave out the anchovies or honey - they're crucial! Use light toppings on this, as it is quite salty and flavorful. I used fresh mozzarella, spinach, and eggs. A keeper.

Exquisite sauce indeed!  I've made this recipe many times, it's so easy to do.  I make as is, minus the anhcovy paste and the honey, plus 1/2 tblsp of brown sugar.  I leave the sauce in the fridge overnight and what wonderful flavor it has the next evening!  Thanks for the tasty recipe!

I am sold on this sauce!  I used the Olive & anchovy paste for a little variety.  I think I let the flavors marry a little too long....the longer it sat, the hotter it got.  But it was still very tollerable.

While I thought this was good, but not great, tasting, I give it four stars because it is certainly very easy.  I'll definitely use the recipe, with modifications, again for a quick weeknight pizza.  I left out the honey and the sauce was plenty sweet from the tomato paste alone.  I left out the cayenne, too, because I thought that would be too spicy for kids.

This sauce was good, but not exquisite.  I let it sit overnight and it turned out pretty good.  But this recipe made way too much for a 10 oz pizza.  I used this sauce on a 10 oz bobboli pizza crust and thought it seemed like a bit much sauce, but I used it all anyway, and the pizza was soggy.  This mixture of spices was okay, but I'm going to keep looking for a better recipe.  The thickness was perfect though.

Good sauce...Instead of 6 oz. of water, I used 4 oz. of water + 2 oz of red wine - added a nice flavor.  I also omitted the honey and used 1/2 t. brown sugar, like another reviewer suggested.  Next time I will probably omit the cayenne as well.

I was putting my pizza together when I realized I had forgotten to buy sauce!  I love this site and am soo glad I found this recepie!!  I made this without the parmesean, anchovy stuff, or the red and cayenne pepper.  I substituted the honey for 1T of pure maple syrup and the onion powder for 1/2t minced onion.  (I had to make due with what I had)  And it was great!  And sooo easy!  Much cheaper and better tasting than buying canned sauce.  I wanted to try with the peppers but wasnt sure how hot it would be. Didnt wanna burn the kids' mouth!  They'll never eat my pizza again!  Thanks for a great recepie.

This is the best pizza sauce ever! Everyone loves it as written. I multiply the recipe to 32 servings and freeze it in batches using a vacuum sealer. Making this much at one time allows me to use an entire 2 ounce tube of anchovy paste and a cup of local raw honey. Exquisite!

This is the second time I have made this. The first time I didn't have any red pepper flakes and it was still delicious. This time I added the red pepper flakes and it was maybe a little too spicy for a couple people in my family. I love this recipe though, good to have in a pinch. I love it, thank you for sharing.

A good pizza sauce.  I think next time I may only add 1 Tablespoon of honey, though.  It was a little sweet for our taste.

This is a lightly sweet and slightly spicy pizza sauce! I've been making this recipe for years. It's the best sauce I've found for my preferred taste profile. I always use the anchovy paste. There will be no fishy taste to the pizza but needs to be used to balance the flavor composition. When you taste it you still may think it's too sweet or spicy. By the time you add a crust, cheese and toppings it will be perfect. Don't lick he spoon and then dump it down the sink because you think it's bad before you even try it on pizza. There is only one minor change that I've made over the years...I make a huge batch and I simmer it slowly for a few hours adding water as necessary to compensate for evaporation. The cooking process mellows all the flavors and brings them all together.

Way too sweet.  I read all of the conflicting reviews and decided to trust the author this first time.  The sweetness wasn't evident until after baking the pizzas for some reason.  The sauce was absolutely delicious with this one exception.  Next time I'll halve the honey and I expect it will be PERFECT.  (This is the crust I used - AMAZING!  http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/01/foolproof-pan-pizza-recipe.html)

This sauce is just way too good!  
I  feel bad for my local pizza shop because I think I will be making my own pizzas from now on.  I did not use anchovy paste (didn't have any) or red pepper flakes (didn't have that either). I would say it makes enough for 3 12" pizzas.

Made it the first time a few weeks ago exactly as written.  Hubby thought it was good but a little sweet.  I cut down on the honey and made it slightly hotter with some extra crushed red pepper flakes for tonight.  We may never order pizza for delivery again!  Yummy!  Thanks for the recipe!

Perfect taste - the anchovy paste added the perfect amount of secret flavor.  I added about half of the anchovy paste and honey,    My 9 year old loved it but she doesn't know about the anchovy paste.

This sauce was okay, it is too sweet. I still have the garlic flavor in my mouth because I used a tsp of the jarred kind.

This is my go to pizza sauce. It’s easy, quick, and reliable. I don’t change a thing. I keep a batch in the freezer to thaw and use whenever I want a pizza. Great recipe.

This is a really good recipe, made it exactly like it says to except for the anchovy paste. It wasn't spicy at all, I guess everyone else that said it was is a little more sensitive than us to it. It is on the sweet side. Next time I make this I will at least cut the honey amount in half and add just a little more oregano. Other than that it's pretty good.

This is a very tasty sauce that adults and kids seem to love.  I have made this with and without anchovy paste (merely because I don't always have it on hand.)  Both versions are great!  The sauce tastes better when it has time to sit, so making it ahead is recommended.

1.6.15 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/17319/exquisite-pizza-sauce/ ... While I liked it more than Easy Pizza Sauce I, it didn't grab me. I had high hopes.  'Started with 1T honey then added one more.  'Think the right amount is in between.  'Nice & thick, & not too tomato paste-y.  That was a big surprise.  'Not "the one" for us, but still glad I tried it.  Btw, after making both recipes separately, combined the two & still three star.

I made this recipe the first time using the full amount of honey, cayenne, and crushed red peppers and excluding the anchovy paste.  We found it to be too sweet and too spicy.  Tonight I made it using half the amount of honey (and I actually substituted honey granules in place of regular honey), excluded the cayenne, and included the anchovy paste.  We thought it was much better the second time around.

I made this for another AR recipe because that recipe called for store bought!!!   NO WAY!  lol    I figured I could throw something passable together and call it a day.  This recipe is not only passible, it SURPASSED any pizza sauce I had ever had before!  WONDERFUL AND easy???   OH YEAH!   I had read a lot of the reviews before hand so I did cut back on the honey, but I kept the amount of crushed red pepper as written.  It had a kick, I'm not gonna lie, but it was a GOOD kick and worked perfectly for me even though, normally, I'm not a fan of the heat.   My husband LOVED it!   Thanks for the recipe!  Oh, I have some leftover so I put it in an air tight container and into the freezer.  Hopefully it will still be just as awesome when I go to use it again.

I didn't care for this sauce.  It tasted much more to me like spaghetti sauce than pizza sauce.  Way too sweet and just lacked the tangy taste of pizza sauce.

The BEST pizza sauce! I mean, I have nothing to compare it to other than store bought because it's the first one I've tried. But it was AMAZING! Such a good flavor. 

Not to mention that this is super easy and doesn't even use that much in terms of ingredients. Spices and such but only one can of tomato paste? Can't beat that. 

I will never buy store bought pizza sauce again. What a waste of money when this stuff is easy and tastes amazing.

This will definitely be a regular for us and will make me want to do homemade pizza nights every week hopefully!

By the way, I didn't change anything on the recipe and I don't think I would make any changes either. The only thing I might consider is cutting out the red pepper flakes, but the spice it adds isn't too overpowering and adds a depth of flavor so I might not even do that.

Definitely try this! You will not be disappointed!

Very good and easy! I used 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp salt, and zero anchovy. I eye-balled the honey, looked to be a tad less than 2 tbs.

8/22/14-I used this recipe for homemade French bread pizzas and it was excellent.  I was trying to control my budget by using what I had on hand and I needed to know how to flavor with tomato paste as the base.  I had all of the ingredients and it was a perfect mix of sweet and savory.  I had half a can of leftover tomato paste and another unopened in the cupboard which necessitated 1 & 1/2-ing the recipe.  We always like more sauce.  This gave us plenty to cover 8 french bread pizzas about 6 inches long each.  I will use it again.  Thanks!

loved this.  I did cut the honey in half per other reviews although I think it would have been great as is!  In my opinion, pizza sauce is supposed to be a bit sweet.  Delicious.  This will now be my go to. UPDATE: trying a double recipe tonight with 3tbsp honey.

I followed the recipe almost to the letter (no honey or salt at all at first, anchovy fillets rather than paste, and put all ingredients in a food processor). After letting sauce sit at room temp, I thought it tasted very good, but wanted a lot more kick (and some sweetness/honey). Added a tsp of honey, more oregano, basil, anchovy (not for everybody, I know), and cayenne. Then I cooked it on low for an hour. The flavors really developed (so much that I think it would be delicious over pasta).I give this four stars for a wonderful starter recipe that any cook can then season to taste.

I look forward to making this again, and tweaking with whatever fresh Italian herbs I have on hand. 

(For those who don't like too much heat/spice/sweetness/anchovy and therefore rated this recipe low, I'd suggest cutting down on those ingredients to begin with, let the sauce sit, and then decide whether to add the given quantities. Also, if using anchovies, add any additional salt only after the sauce has been allowed to sit, according to taste).

Excellent pizza sauce, my only complaint is that it is far too sweet for our tastes. We cut the honey in half or less, and it's wonderful. I suggest adding it at the end a little at a time until you get the sweetness you like. A small splash of red wine vinegar in the water also adds a little zing.

We also do a fresh version using garden ingredients -- tomatos, basic, and oregano. Also use fresh onion and garlic, and throw in some more fresh herbs like thyme and rosemary and puree it. It's out of this world!

I left out the honey (since tomato paste already has a sweetness to it and so many reviewers said the honey added made it too sweet), anchovy paste, (didn't have any) and the red and Cayenne peppers (my mom likes nothing the least bit spicy). I did add the Parmesan and also added about a half teaspoon of Franks Red Hot sauce, 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning blend, (it has all the individual herbs in it) minced garlic, onion powder, black pepper and a 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt. My son said it was the best sauce I'd made to date. Just adding the Parmesan and hot sauce made a big difference. I'll have to buy some anchovy paste next time I'm out to the grocery store so I can add that next time too. I won't tell any of my family though or they won't touch it with a 10 foot poll!

Love this sauce.  Skipped the anchovy paste ( 1-didn't have any, 2-don't like it ).  Makes plenty of sauce for two medium sized pizzas.  I don't find it overly sweet or spicy as some people have commented.  Of course, tastes vary so adjust as necessary for your taste.  Have also used the sauce when making pizza for gatherings and everyone really seemed to enjoy it.

This is really good pizza sauce.  I made as written but doubled it based on another review that it wouldn't be enough for a large pizza.  That was unnecessary, it would have been plenty enough.

We love this sauce! The red pepper makes it spicy enough for flavor, but it's not hot enough to leave your mouth on fire. The honey and other spices combine to give it a nice, full flavor. It's so good, you even don't need toppings!

I took the hint of others and omitted the honey.. The sauce was too sweet and bland. So I started dumping more garlic, onion powder, salt, basiil and pizza seasoning. I don't think I improved upon it.

This recipe was too sweet for our tastes.  After reading many reviews, I found most people really thought this recipe was exquisite.  However, for us the sweetness was overwhelming.  Next time I will use much less honey or substitute sugar.  I do believed the anchovy paste is essential to counter balance the honey, but not enough.  I will try another recipe next time.

This is a great pizza sauce recipe.  I multiplied the recipe by 6 and canned it what I didn't use on the pizza I made for dinner.  I didn't have anchovy paste or honey and I left out the cayenne pepper purposely to keep the heat down.  I added sugar to taste, which ended up being about 1 1/2 tablespoons.  You need some sugar to keep the balance of flavors with the spicy peppers and the bitter of the tomato.  I also had to substitute one whole minced onion, and about 4 cloves of fresh garlic for the powder since I didn't have powdered.  I blended everything after cooking to make a smooth velvety sauce.  Overall, this recipe is very easy and it tastes great.  It is easily substituted for what you have on hand or personal taste preferences. My personal tastes:  I added one cup of dry red wine and let everything simmer for an hour before canning.

YUM!!!!  I have never before made a pizza sauce that I didn't have to cook and I admit that I was skeptical, but the lack of time I had to prepare the sauce and the reviews persuaded me to try this recipe.  Wow, I am sure glad I did!  I had to leave the cayenne pepper out because my husband is a spice wuss and I omitted the anchovy paste on principle, but other than that I followed the recipe just the way it is written.  Amazing doesn't begin to cover it.  It is tangy, spicy, sweet and perfect in my book.  I have all ready passed this recipe on to others who love it as much as we do.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!  Pizza night may never be the same again!

made this on May 2 2014 followed recipe exactly as written this is a 5 star recipe and as all of you already know it is much better the following day once the spices and flavors blend the only recipe I will use from now on no more buying jarred pizza sauce from the store
by the way some others said the sauce was to sweet I will admit it seemed to be right after I made this but after sitting in the fridge overnight I feel that it was no longer an issue make this a day ahead first then try it to decide the sweetness

I found it to be a bit on the sweet side so I added a bit more of the spices and then cooked it for a few minutes.  It turned out really well.  I got enough for 2 12" pizzas.

This is so good. I did not use the anchovy paste because I didn't have it, but I'll tell ya, didn't matter! I let this stuff sit out for an hour while I chopped veggies and kept tasting it. Seriously I ate half of it before it even hit the pizza crusts. Also, had only crushed garlic...still the best sauce ever!

I do not change a thing. I just omit the anchovy.  I make my own dough in the bread machine too. THE best pizza sauce. I never buy pizza's anymore. You can adjust the cayenne and chilli flakes to taste. We like it exactly as listed with a tiny bit of heat. Thank you!

Great pizza sauce! I left out the anchovy paste, used garlic powder instead of minced garlic, and left out the onion powder. I doubled the recipe and had TONS left over (we made two cookie sheet sized pizzas - there was probably enough sauce left for at least 3 more). Hopefuly this will freeze okay.

This is my "go to recipe".  Generally I make up the spices in a larger quantity and put them in a jar to have ready at a moments notice, and use 2 tsp per 8 oz. can of tomato paste.  Sometimes I heat it in a small saucepan, sometimes not.  It's not very often that something "quick" is so very good. I don't use the anchovy paste, just a personal choice. PIZZA DOUGH II from this site is my choice for the dough. Thanks to Angie and Stephen for excellent recipes to make fabulous pizza at home.

Tried this last night and it was excellent. I didn't have oregano, marjoram or basil so I subbed 3/4 tsp of italian seasoning which includes all of those items. I did not add anchovy paste and only used about a teaspoon of honey. I ended up using about 1/4 tsp of salt which seemed perfect but because I loaded my pizza w/ tons of onions, mushrooms and peppers (which I didn't season) I found the salt lacking. So keep your toppings in mind and adjust accordingly. Thanks Angie!

I actually went and found anchovy paste just for this recipe and am very glad I did. This is now my go to for pizza sauce. It's good as is, but every time I make it I am tweaking the spices to find the perfect mix for me. I do blend this on the stove on low so I can taste and adjust more accurately than creating it cold. Freezes well. Extra garlic is definitely a suggestion I would make. As well, I would not consider the anchovy paste optional. Its a must people, I swear to you, you will not taste it, you will just taste a better pizza sauce.

Best homemade sauce recipe I've been able to make! I halved the recipe (for mini-tortilla pizzas) and added romano in lieu of parmesan and also added an ice-cube-size of kale pesto that I had from a previous recipe. Delicious! Would next time probably do a bit less honey as I found it a bit on the too-sweet side. Definitely a good base recipe that you can change-up easily depending on your mood. Thanks!

This is a fantastic recipe...every time I make this people love it!. Only change I do is replace a few tablespoons of the water with white wine and use Worcestershire sauce instead of anchovy paste. 
This is makes a awesome pizza.- sam

I used sauce instead of paste and left out the marjoram and the anchovy paste.  I followed the recipe otherwise and it suited our tastes well.  We really liked the honey flavor and appreciated the little bit of heat from the red pepper.  I don't often use a red sauce but when I do this is it.

This made my normally pretty ordinary pizza extra tasty. I like to make a big batch, freeze per pizza in small baggies, thaw, cut a tip and squeeze onto the crust. So easy!

This is the best pizza sauce ever!  I omit the anchovy paste (vegetarians in this household) and halve the honey, but I otherwise make it exactly as the recipe states.  I often double the recipe and freeze it in half-pint canning jars, and each jar gives me just enough for a single 2-3 person pizza.  The sauce does have a spicy kick, but that's one of the things I love most about it.  It's the only pizza sauce we'll use in this house now!

Perfection. I really had to force myself to add the anchovy paste but I'm glad I did. Thanks to those who took the time to say it wouldn't make the sauce fishy tasting. When the sauce was first made I thought it had too much onion powder but it mellowed nicely and the sauce was perfection when baked into a pizza. Great recipe. I'll never buy pizza sauce again. I followed the instructions exactly that included using both tablespoons of honey BUT I also added the anchovy paste for balance. Those complaining about it being too sweet I bet didn't include the anchovy paste. I won't change a thing when I make it again and you can be sure I'll be making this over and over. 5 stars!

This sauce was absolutely amazing, will def be making it again and again. My boyfriend and son loved the spicy sweet zing that this sauce gave the pizza. I'm a diabetic so i love the fact it's made with honey and olive oil so less fat and sugar. I used a whole wheat crust and the sauce made it. Thank you so much for finally giving us a wonderful pizza sauce that my whole family can enjoy :)

Delish!  My kids just tasted the sauce and loved it.  Like many reviewers I found it a bit spicy but you can easily cut down on some of the pepper if you like. I used honey in place of sugar and did cut it down a bit as well. Did not have anchovy paste but substituted Worcestershire sauce (has anchovy in it) and it worked great.  This is my new pizza sauce recipe!

Ok so I figured I'd give this recipe a shot as a great way to let the kids help with dinner. I read all the reviews about what people left in, and what people left out, but decided to go with the recipe as written. Do not make my mistake, this recipe was sweet and tasted strongly of anchovies. The pizza was unedible and ruined. Unless you REALLY like the taste of anchovies, stay clear of this optional ingredient. Unless you like sweet pizza sauce I'd steer clear of the honey as well.

Have been using this recipe for a long time now and we love it. I drop the honey and anchovy paste however. I make  a batch and then freeze half of it for next time, there is plenty for two 12" pizza pies.

This is by far the best pizza sauce I've ever had...... after some minor variations. Cut the honey in half(at least) and cut down both the cayenne and crushed pepper to a pinch.

This sauce will make any pizza awesome in my opinion. I double all the ingredients except the honey and cayenne pepper. It's not to sweet or spicy, way better than store bought or even pizza places. Thank you sooo much for this great and best pizza sauce ever! I also plan on using this as marinara, it's so good I want it on everything.

Added half of the anchovy paste as I have never had it.  Then cut down the cayenne pepper and no red pepper flakes as a member of my family does not like spicy foods.  It turned out perfect and was still a little spicy.  Its a keeper for sure.

I found this too sweet and too spicy and I'm not particularly picky about either flavor. It's just that they didn't meld or balance, even after sitting.

I followed this recipe as written (but did not use the optional anchovy paste) and was kind of disappointed.  The sauce was too sweet for me and needed more spice.  I would perhaps try reducing the honey or maybe using a little white sugar instead, and upping the oregano, marjoram, and basil.  However, I myself would rather just make a different recipe entirely.

Excellent! I love the little bit of zip the cayenne pepper and red pepper give it! Enough for me to enjoy it but the kids to still eat it and not complain.  We doubled the recipe (but not the honey so that it wasn't too sweet) and froze half of it.

I absolutely loved this wonderful recipe, it was delicious. It had such a lovely combination of spices, and it's so sweet. I just made vegetable pizza with this sauce, and it was the most amazing pizza I'd ever eaten; even better than the ones at the restaurants. I will surely use this many more times, and I think it will just be divine when I use this for pasta or spaghetti sauce. If I need sauce, this will most definitely be the only one I'll be using for a millennium.

This sauce is great!! My husband raved over this. Since I didn't have anchovy paste, I reduced the honey by half. Added 1 tsp salt and 1/4 c red wine. Simmered it for 2 minutes. The spices were perfect. I don't understand when people have written that it is too spicy. We live in SoCal so maybe we are more used to spicy food. I will definitely make this again!!!

This is one of those recipes I have had saved in my recipe box forever, and just now finally got around to making it.  We loved, loved, loved it!  I will definitely cut the honey down next time, as it was a tad too sweet, but other than that I do believe this is the perfect pizza sauce!  I will be using this again and again.  Thanks for putting an end to jarred pizza sauce in my house  :)

This recipe was excellent! I cut back the honey, only putting in one tablespoon of it, and I didn't put the red pepper and cayenne pepper, only the cayenne pepper. By doing this, it was not extremely sweet or spicy, just right.

Didn't like this at all..I cut the honey in half as suggested by other reviews and followed the rest of the recipe to the letter. It was still way too sweet and just tasted awful IMO.

What an amazing combination of spices!  I thought the garlic and onion was too strong, would do 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1/4 tsp onion powder.  And I'd do 1 (not 2) Tbsp honey.  Thank you! will use this (with the slight changes) as my permanent pizza sauce!

This was a pretty good sauce but I don't think that it was that great. But then again, we all have different tastes.  Did anyone else find it too fishy (too much anchovy paste) and too runny (too much water)?  If I make this again, I will add less water.

I LOVED this recipe, although only used about 2tsp of honey. I think the magic is the Parmesan, so don't skip it. I used freshly grated and it was divine. I won't bother buying sauce again - this is soooo easy!

This recipe is great! I've made it as-is (sans anchovy paste) and thought it was great, but prefer it w/ no red or cayenne peppers. I add honey and salt to taste, everything else the same. Love it!

I have made this several times with no changes (no anchovy paste) and it comes out great.  I make extra and freeze it, it is always wonderful.  I love the sweet and spicy elements.

Excellent recipe!  It is more the texture of a marinara sauce than a pizza sauce, which is great because I served it with 'Home-Fried Cheese Sticks' from this site.  I was a little reluctant to add the anchovy paste and honey, based upon other reviews.  However, I decided to make it exactly as directed and am I forever GLAD that I did.  It is perfect.  In fact, I mixed it all up without the anchovy paste at first.  I tasted it and it was very bland.  Then, I added the paste and it kicked up the flavor so well that I even added a second teaspoon.  I really like saltiness of the anchovy paste because it adds balance to the tomatoes.  DO NOT leave it out!  I did omit the hot peppers for the sake of the children.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very tasty, I like the spicy and sweet. I used crushed dried cayenne peppers (from garden) in place of red pepper flakes - which may have made it spicer than written. 

The anchovy paste is key for me in pizza sauces to add that saltiness, and that extra kick. I omited any plain salt for this reason.

Fun one for my daughter to measure out, just bring out a 1/8 teaspoon and tell her how many needed!

This sauce was excellent! I omitted the anchovy paste and red pepper flakes, and only used one T honey as others recommended. It still had a bit of heat for my son, but I thought it was so good. I will definitely make it again. Thank you!!

The best pizza sauce recipe I have found.  Quick and easy with the perfect blend of sweet, savory, and spicy flavors.  The only change I make is to leave out the marjoram because I never seem to have it on hand.  Thanks!

Made this sauce 7/22/12.  Our son said it was the best pizza sauce he had ever had!  He said this was the only pizza sauce he ever wanted to have on pizza.  We used it on grilled pizza!

Before serving, I sampled this and realized it's REALLY sweet! I prefer my sauces to be more savory than sweet, so I added more salts and garlics to level it out. Next time I hope to just reduce the amount of honey, and hopefully the rest of it will sort out! Beyond that, it really did taste wonderful once I un-sweetened it a bit ;) We did not do the anchovy paste, either.

Heeeeelllllllooooooo!  This is the BEST sauce + it is a no cook recipe...perfect...and my foodie husband loved it.  I used this on Monday and then went to look for the recipe again on Thursday...and couldn't find it...needless today...not as good without all the ingredients (honey).  EXCELLENT - thank you for sharing this!

Love this recipe.  I usually double it and just replace the marjoram with oregano since I don't typically keep marjoram around.

Great pizza sauce recipe! I used chopped onions instead of Onion Powder, shredded Italian Blend cheese instead of grated parmesan cheese (because that's what I had readily available) and I heated the sauce for a few minutes before letting it sit. The sauce was sweet yet zesty and the blend of basil and marjoram definitley gave it that signiture pizza sauce taste!

I made this twice. The first time as-is except for the anchovy paste which I did not have. It was terribly sweet, but still good. The second time I made as-is (including anchovy paste) and omitted the honey. Superb!

I'd give the recipe as it stands a 4, but it's such an amazing sauce minus the sweetness that disagrees with my expectations of pizza sauce that I have to give it a 5.

I'm only giving this 3 stars because the anchovy paste totally left an unpleasant aftertaste.  I followed the recipe exactly as is but thought that maybe the anchovy paste should be reduced to about 1/2 tsp.

This was my first homemade pizza attempt - and I chose this recipe for the sauce. I chopped up two large tomatoes (deseeded), and omitted the water completely. I decided to use just 2 teaspoons of oregano and 1 spoon of dried basil, doubled the dose of the chilli flakes and added 3 teaspoons of honey. It honey sweetness together with the spicy kick from the chilli really lifted the flavours - coupled with the fresh basil I added to my toppings prior to serving... it really brought up a very sharp, aromatic flavour for my 1st homemade pizza. This sauce was good enough to eat on its own, and my guest who tried the sauce loved it. I can easily tweak this to make it into a bolognese sauce in the future.  Received rave reviews from it.

We use this sauce pretty much every time we make pizza-which is almost weekly.  I couldn't find anchovy paste at first so I pureed anchovies in olive oil but that always seemed a little too fishy.  After finding paste, it was even better!  In my recipe book forever!

Fantastic.  I didn't use the anchovies (I'm a veggie) and used agave nectar instead of honey because that's all I had on hand.  Best sauce I've ever tasted.

Very good as is.  Blew my mind with a a generous 1/4 tsp of red wine vinegar.   I simmered the whole deal for about 30 minutes to bring the flavors together.

I really love this recipe. It is a sweet sauce, but I go for sweet things. It keeps well in the fridge for a couple of weeks when I store it in pyrex and keep it on the bottom shelf.

Wow-won't bother buying pizza sauce ever again!! Could be a tad sweet until it was baked so don't judge to quickly! The spice mixture is wonderful though I didn't have anchovy paste-the only change. Thank you!!

This was very tasty.  I only gave it a four stars because I left out the anchovy paste did not have any (I used Worcestershire sauce instead), cayenne pepper and the marjoram, out of personal preference.   We like a sweet sauce so I did one Tbs of honey and 1 Tbs of Brown sugar. This makes plenty of sauce for two pizza's.  Yum!

This is delicious, but I gave it a 4 because it was too sweet.  1T. of honey is plenty!  As written it's also way TOO HOT for kids.  I cut out the red pepper flakes & cayenne and it was plenty spicy enough even for the adults.

flavor is good, but too sweet, even with only putting 1 1/2 T honey- will cut back next time,  I put in a tomato sauce and more cheese, and it's still too sweet for me!  Nice looking sauce, though.

Didn't have anchovy paste - isn't something I would normally use.  Waaaay too much honey.  It was much sweeter than I would like to have any pizze/pasta sauce.  Would have given one star, but I didn't use anchovy paste (maybe that balances out the honey?) and I think it's a really great base.  I'd definitely make again, maybe omitting the honey altogether...

Really easy, delicious sauce. It takes 30-60 minutes (I like to let it sit for an hour or so before using) and is just perfect.

This is very good but I found it a bit too spicy.  I made it for Xmas gifts and have made it several times since, so I love the flavors and now add less of the pepper.

Loved this sauce!  I forgot to add the salt though and had to add salt to the pizza once it was done.  However, I think the amount of salt in this recipe would be fine, depending on the ingredients you top the pizza with and how salty the crust is.  I used the Quick and Easy Pizza Crust which is not very salty, but we used a lot of cheese.  For reference, I don't usually add salt to food at the table, so if you like things salty I would recommend both the anchovy paste and maybe adding more salt.

This has been my go-to sauce since I found it on here a while ago--absolutely delicious! Even used it this last time (with about an extra cup of water) as the sauce for a pizza casserole dish I found on another blog-site. YUM!

This is my go-to pizza sauce recipe and I now make pizzas weekly!  There are a lot of ingredients but it is worth it!  I follow the recipe except for the anchovy and I usually add a little more honey because I like a sweet sauce. One batch makes two pizzas for me.  I've tried freezing it and it changes the consistency but still tastes good.  I use the pre made pizza dough balls from Trader Joes and top with fresh basil and mozzarella.  For me it's a simple and extremely tasty dinner to make at the end of a long busy day.  We rarely order delivery anymore!

Despite reducing the honey and cayenne (both by half), I thought it was too sweet and my 4 year old thought it was too spicy.  However, my husband loved it.

Excellent sauce. Followed directions as written. My wife found the sauce a little spicy but everything is spicy to her. Although she finds it spicy she is always asking me to make it. She says all other pizzas just can't compare.

Sooo good. I omitted the anchovy paste and didn't have marjoram.  I would cut the honey to 1 T as my husband mentioned the sweetness.  Otherwise, awesome!  Thanks for this I have been making my own pizzas but always was disappointed with sauce, previously can of crushed tomatoes/spices

This was excellent and easy!  I added a little more red pepper flakes for more spice and used Romamo chesse instead of Parmesan.  Used a teaspoon of italian seasoning instead of adding individual oregano, marjoram, and basil.

I did not think my kids would like the anchovy paste but without the saltiness, it was too sweet.  So, I only added 2 tablespoons of honey, and substituted the anchovy paste for about 1 tablespoon of soy sauce and a teaspoon of salt.  It was so good!

Very good! I omitted the honey because sweetness is meant for sweet rolls not an entree. I also omitted the red pepper flakes. Anchovy paste is wonderful and I use it in my Caesar salad dressing. I doubled the recipe and added 1/4 cup white wine also.

This was tasty.  Made because I didn't have any prepared pizza sauce in the pantry.  I like the canned stuff for the ease of prep but when I want to go all out, this will be my recipe of choice.

Wonderful!  I used a large can of crushed tomatoes instead of the paste and added a generous splash of cooking sherry and a dash of season-all.   Wonderful.

I read this recipe and wondered just how this could be so great, but decided there were enough people saying it was that I would give it a try, well, AMAZING! I do you all loose herbs and spices from the local co-op so that helps but i think that even if they were just off the shelf herbs and spices this would be an incredible pizza sauce! I am a New York Style Pizza addict, to me there is no pizza like you can get on the streets of New York City or Northern NJ, no matter where else I have traveled there is no pizza like true NY style pizza, this is a great substitute when you live so far away that you cant jump in your car and go get a slice. The crust also has a huge factor but I found that the Bread Machine Pizza Dough recipe on this site makes a great crust as well as long as you dont try and dry it out by adding too much flour. 
I have read the comments about adding additional items and that is cool for those who want to but if you are looking for something to tweak your senses from the last time you had New York Style pizza in the Big Apple, add a bit more cheese use a bit of sugar to taste, i used both the recommended honey as well as a pinch or two of sugar and it was the best I have ever made, and I cook a lot! I might have to find a friend who has a bakery oven to see how it comes out in a high heat oven!!

This sauce is AMAZING! If I ever were to own a pizzaria - this would be the "house sauce!!" Hubby and I have decided that it's the honey that sets is above and beyond! Lots of ingredients make this looks scary and difficult - it is neither. Easy, and well worth all the little measurements!!

I doubled the recipe, skipped the anchovy and pepper flakes, added fennel seed and fresh basil, and used 2 tsp Italian seasoning instead of the other spices separately. Turned out great.

Made this for the first time, so followed it exactly (including the anchovy paste and waiting at least thirty minutes).  I wouldn't change a thing! I'll be making this again and again! Thanks, Angie!  I'll also be using other rater's advice and making the spice mix up in a big bag so that it's ready anytime I want it!

This was delicious! The only alteration was I used 1 tablespoon of honey instead of 2. Did not use the optional anchovy paste.

WAY too sweet.  I made it without the anchovy paste, but in its current form it's unacceptable and I will be throwing the sauce out.

Prepared it as written including the anchovy paste, and it was too sweet and too much heat to be what I'm looking for in a pizza sauce. Didn't much care for the cheese in it either.

This tasted like spaghetti sauce with cheese, not pizza sauce. Too thick.  I had to add more water to thin it out some. I left out the honey and anchovy paste and pepper flakes. since I didn't have them.   Sorry, just wasn't pizza sauce to me.  Not a complete waste though.  I will use the remaining sauce for my spaghetti.

Initially I thought it would be waaay to much garlic. It was very overpowering when I tasted it after mixing. It mellowed out really nicely in the oven and tasted great. Check out foodiebecomesher.com to see how my whole pizza from scratch turned out.

I disliked the honey taste, and couldn't get it to balance well with the spices. I tried replacing the honey with brown sugar, and had the same problem.

This sauce is amazing! When I doubled the recipe for a whole pizza, (which is essential), the twelve fluid ounces of water was too much. We had water dripping from the dough onto the oven floor. Awesome. Next time, I think I will opt for about 10 ounces. But, the pizza still tasted amazing! I couldn't find anchovy paste (which I was very disappointed about), but it was still very tasty. I think I will follow the tip about bottling up the dry ingredients.

LOVE IT. Skipped the Anchovy paste, used 1/4 of the honey called for and a squirt of srirachi hot chili sauce in place of the cayenne (because it was what I had). Everyone LOVED it. Will definitely use this as my go to pizza sauce recipe in the future. Imagine it will do well with whatever spice/herb tweaks one wants to make to suit your families preferences. Best part is NO COOKING. Thanks so much.

Made this for the first time.  Did not use the anchovy paste.  Don't see the need sauce was excellent without it.   My family is picky about their pizza sauce and we all loved it. Kept all the other ingredients the same.  Wont be buying anymore pizza sauce.

This is the best pizza sauce I have ever done!  It is the only one I do now.
The only thing I change is the herbs, especially in the summer when I have fresh ones growning in the garden.

I used a modified version of this with a greater ratio of paste to water and less honey. It was one of the best sauces I have ever tasted. Definitely worth a repeat!

This was a good pizza sauce, but nothing wowed me about it.  I was hoping to replicate the sauce of my favorite pizza place that has a sweetness to it.  I omitted marjoram & anchovy paste since I did not have.  I would make this again, although I'd be more likely just to buy a store bottle already made.

Best pizza sauce EVER. The only difference I've made is omitting the anchovy paste since I don't have any & always forget to buy it. Other than that, it is my standard sauce recipe & every Friday is pizza night at our house. The money I save using this vs. store-bought sauce alone is worth 5 stars!!

Absolutely wonderful!  Only change I would make (because I have small kids) is to leave out the red pepper and cayenne pepper.  Both of my kiddos complained about the spice.  Other than that, the best pizza sauce I've ever had!

Wow, how easy is this?  No marjoram so I left it out, and also left out the cayenne.  Halved the honey and my kids said it tasted just like the sauce in a "Lunchables" from the grocery store.  That being said, it's not my fave pizza sauce, wayyyy to heavy on the onion.  However, we also used it on some chicken cutlets and made Chicken Parm with it. Amazing!  This is def my new sauce for Chicken Parm!   Thanks for sharing

This was a very good pizza sauce. Not perfect but good - next time, I'll back down on the honey and add a few more spices to it.

I know that Pizza Sauce sauce sounds easy but I always miss up with it so I gave this recipe a try and I'm really happy I did. very tasty better than any canned pizza sauce  I have tried and better than the delivery pizza which is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too salty .the amount of sauce that you get from the recipes is fairly enough for 2 large size pizza . I had to make some changes :1- some one suggested to double the dry ingredients  (onion powder , oregano,basil, marjoram and black pepper ).2- I did't have any marjoram so I used thyme instead .3-I did't add  cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes coz I ran out of them besides I was making the pizza for 3 and 2  years old kids. thanks for sharing the recipe.

I used everything except anchovy paste and marjoram , but i added extra oregano to replace marjoram that i did not have on hand . I tasted the sauce before using it on pizza , thought it was too sweet , but after put them together in a pizza crust and the topping , it turns out very delicious and makes a perfect sauce !! Thanks for the great recipe .

1 word - AWESOME!  I absolutely hate canned or jarred pizza sauce - disgusting.  So, I came here looking for a good sauce to make.  This is it - I won't even try any others.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This sauce is beyond yummy! I wanted to lick the bowl clean it was so good! I have made this with and without the anchovy paste and I couldn't tell the difference (maybe it's just me). I have used this on pizza, with bread sticks and even made this into a pasta sauce, it is great on everything! Thanks for sharing this recipe Angie!

I doubled the recipe for 2 pies.  I didn't have a few of the ingredient...marjoram, cayenne, nor anchovy.  I reduced the honey by half and it was strangly sweet and missing something.  That something is the counter balance so I added in 1/2 tsp of salt.  This is a winner of a recipe.  I'm sure even better would I have had everything on hand to follow it fully.

Very good (and easy) pizza sauce.  I left everything the same except I did not add anchovy paste.  Although it was very good, it needs a little tweaking from me.  Something was off, not sure what.  (My cooking skills are below par for this kind of troubleshooting)

Great Sauce! No need to look any further.  We used this at a pizza party.  Kids and adults loved it, although I did cut back on the cayenne because of the kids.  If you don't have all the specific dried leafy spices (oregano, marjoram, & basil) on hand, you can replace them with an Italian Seasoning blend and it will turn out great too.

A great sauce!  I now substitute the tomato paste with a tomato powder from Shelf Reliance (thrivefoodhomestore).  Then I can make just as much as I need -- we don't usually use all of the 6oz can with two adults and two little kids. We make English Muffin pizzas

This really was very good and easy. DH & I thought the sauce was a bit too sweet so we'll try it with half the honey next time. I also eliminated the dried red pepper flakes because SS doesn't like things too spicy and it's a good thing because even with using half the cayenne it was just right for spicyness :) I doubled it to use with "Quick and Easy Pizza Crust" from this site, but it would have been fine to make as written for that crust.  We'll have this often!

This sauce was fabulous!  It is a bit spicy for kids, so I'd recommend cutting back cayenne or crushed red pepper, as has been suggested by others.  We used the anchovy paste (a first for me), and it was a very authentic flavor and texture!

The basic recipe is great but its made better when you put your own stamp on it. I cut down on the honey to a 1/2 tbsp, 1/2 tsp Anchovy paste and 2 tbsp Parmesan cheese. The Cayenne and Red pepper flake can be overwhelming so I cut that in half as well. I also added a little EVOO for the taste. The Anchovy paste makes this recipe. It gives it an unique flavor but on-point for Pizza. Its got that wow flavor.

Great Sauce- Made a few minor adjustments.
1. Replaced water with tomato sauce
2. To make a chunky sauce I used peeled whole tomato's, drained and crushed then added to the sauce- Make sure to use a little less water or tomato sauce when doing this if you want it to come out thicker.

My husband and I love this pizza sauce. It's yummy, easy, and much cheaper than a jar of store-bought sauce. We do not use the anchovy paste, and we only use about 1/3 of the honey in the recipe since we like a spicier rather than sweeter sauce. We always double it and then freeze the leftovers for the next time we have pizza. Thanks for the great recipe! :)

use garlic powder instead of fresh to make it even easier. also leave out the honey and anchovie, and add a little shake of fennel seeds. So awesome!

I made this 2 ways at once:  as written, and in a different pot, following my instincts with some changes.  (neither used the optional anchovy paste, and both started with 2 fresh roma tomatoes cooked down and added a can of organic tomato sauce instead of the paste & water).  After making both and comparing tastes - I compromised to these changes: double the garlic, and saute it in olive oil to remove bitterness.  omit honey, but add it in at the end if your sauce needs some sweetness as that will depend on your tomatoes and will be different each batch.  omit the marjoram and use a splash of lemon juice instead.  omit cayenne.  no salt unless you use all fresh or no-salt-added tomatoes.  omit cheese and use it on top of pizza so you can appreciate that flavor.  if time allows, fresh grated onion makes a big difference over the onion powder.

I liked the overall flavour but found it way too sweet.  Will definitely ease up on the amount of honey added next time.

I thought this sauce was pretty delicious. It is a touch on the sweet side for me, so I add a little salt. Which is why I give it only 4 stars. I used to make my pizza sauce this way as well (with tomato paste), but got away from it when the garden was producing good.

This is amazing. Do not cut out the anchovy paste. I've tried it with and without and it is soooo much better with. I am not an anchovy lover, but there is something about that flavor you can't easily replicate. Give it enough time to meld before putting it to use for full flavor but I'd be lying if I said I haven't used immediately from time to time with satisfactory results.

I love this sauce!!! I don't tend to use the anchovy paste b/c I dont keep it on hand but everything else is stuff we always have & it is so easy to whip up. I make pizza for my twin toddlers a lot also, and I omit the red pepper flakes & cayenne and then blend up 1 large carrot, 1 red pepper & some frozen chopped spinach in the food processor & add to this sauce for a veggie packed meal for them, we all love it!

Both my husband and I were put off by the aftertaste of the parmesan cheese in this. Not sure why it bothered us.. we like parm cheese on its own. Unfortunately I did not have any more tomato paste on hand to give it a go sans parm cheese. I ended up taking a can of Muir Glen pizza sauce we had in our pantry and adding a few of the spices to it, and it definitely did improve the flavor. I am giving it 3 stars because I think the recipe has potential, and I will most likely try it again with modifications.

Fantastic.  Left out the anchovy paste, kept everything the same.  Was a bit sweet according to my husband, but I loved it!  Taste even better as time past! Definitely my go to pizza sauce.

I quadrupled the recipe after so many rave reviews and wish I hadn't.  While the sauce was very good the first day, it didn't stay very good the next day.  It got way too spicy (and we LOVE spicy food but this just tasted awkward) and was entirely too thick.  Next time I will cut back on all the heated-spices and thin it out some more.

I LOVED this pizza sauce and would keep making it exactly as printed.  But...hubby and the kids thought it was a tad to sweet and spicy. So, I took out 1 T. of the honey and the red pepper flakes. It's still a little sweet and a little spicy and everybody is happy now. This is my all time favorite sauce recipe ever though. Love it!

I'm giving this 5 stars because even though I messed up slightly, I still thought it was good.  And I'm sure it'll be great once I fix it right.  I scaled the recipe to 40 servings and just made a jar of the dry seasoning to make things easier.  Well, I wrote down the cayenne and red pepper flakes wrong and ended up putting in too much of each.  The end result was a real spicey sauce, which was fine with me since I like spicey things.  I was wondering why nobody had warned of this in the reviews.  That's when I discovered my mistake.  So going forward I'll fix things, but in the meantime, I've got an exquisite spicey pizza sauce.

I gave it 5 stars even though I changed it a little.  I did not use anchovy paste or margoram.  First time I made it I used 2 T honey.  It was really good, but my husband said it tasted sweet.  Next time I made it I used 1 T sugar.  I did  not have any tomato paste so I used an 2-8 oz cans of tomato sauce in place of paste and water.  This will definitely be the recipe I use.  We love it.  It has just the right amount of spice to it.  Best I have ever had.

Great taste!  I've made this several times with good results and lots of compliments.  Next time, I think I'll try for a fresher-tasting sauce by using crushed tomatoes instead of the paste/water mixture.

The blend of herbs is spot on. Thank you Angie. I did take the advise of many other cooks and left out the honey completely. I doubled the recipe and tripled the herbs, including the peppers, as we enjoy hearty, savory tastes

I am giving this 5 stars because I had to use sugar (1.5 tbsp) instead of honey and maybe that is what made it too sweet.  Other than that it was great after I got over the sweetness.  Maybe next time I will slowly add a little honey and taste as I go.  I would use this any day over jarred pizza sauce.  We used it for pizza rolls =)  Thank you angie! =)  Edit: lol ok so I just read the reviews from other people and I guess I should have done that more before I tried this. They all say the same, less honey, if any at all.  I will say though that I think the heat in it is fine, I had even added a little more.

Yum!  I made it vegan--left out the honey (plenty sweet, anyway), used nutritional yeast instead of parm, and no fish, of course.  Just what I was hoping for.

This sauce is pretty good.  I cooked it in a small Crockpot on low so the flavors really could mesh together.  The one thing we found about this pizza sauce is that it is VERY SWEET.  If you do not like a sweet sauce, cut down on the honey.  1 tsp. is plenty to take off the tartness.  I also added finely chopped green pepper, about a tablespoon.

I love this sauce, it's so easy and very good. It is on the sweeter side so cut back on the honey if your preference is for a less sweet sauce. I really like it on pizza and meatball subs as well.

Hands down the best pizza sauce recipe I've ever tried! And I've been trying many of them hunting for a good one recently. I think our search will end here! And don't be intimidated...its really not much harder than other recipes! I cooked mine on low for about 15 minutes to help the flavors marry quickly. And I used the anchovy paste which gives it that little something extra. I omitted the cayenne/red pepper to make it kid friendly. It didn't seem to sweet to me and it only needed the smallest pinch of salt. Yum!

I made this as posted except for the anchovy paste (which I didn't have).  It was fabulous!  Will definitely be making again next time we have homemade pizza.

My first pizza sauce ever and after I made the sauce I thought, "this IS more sweet than I like." But after making the pizza, it was delicious.  Definitely a keeper!

The sauce was just ok.  Way too sweet for my taste, the honey was way over-powering.  I would like to try it again, but definitely decreasing the amount of honey.  I didn't find it too spicy at all.

Super yummy! I think the sauce was even better the next day. I didn't find it to be too spicy at all, and think it could be easily tweaked to anyone's taste preferences. I will never buy store bought again!

I used about a t. of agave  instead of the honey.  Love this and add 1 can of tom sauce and 1 can of diced tomatoes and it becomes a delicious pasta sauce as well.

I would give this 5 stars but I did have to make a few changes.  I reduce the honey to 1.5 tsp, omit the anchovy paste, reduce the cayenne pepper to 1/16 tsp, omit the red pepper flakes and add 1/4 tsp salt.  The pepper and anchovy were just my families tastes.  But I do believe there is way too much honey in this recipe.  I never buy canned pizza sauce anymore.  This is my go to recipe.

Very flavorful. May be too spicy for kids. I personally like using tomato sauce better to yield a thinner fresher tasting sauce. My go-to recipe from now on.

Very yummy! I used 3/4 red wine and 1/4 water for the liquid, used sugar instead of honey (only 1 T), no anchovy paste,  and cut back a little on the pepers. Great recipie and fun to play around with!

Delicious!  I used 2 cloves of fresh garlic instead of dried garlic and omitted the anchovy paste, cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes.  I also added 1/2 cup of red bell pepper puree and 1/2 cup of spinach puree (already in my freezer) for extra veggies.  Next time I will only use one garlic clove and add the veggie purees before the water to control water content (probably only will use 4 oz water).  I will also mix the dry ingredients together like previous users to keep some ready for pizza.  Thanks Angie!   In a small jar, combine the following: 6 teaspoon onion powder 2 teaspoon dried oregano 2 teaspoon dried marjoram 2 teaspoon dried basil  2 teaspoon black pepper 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes   Use 2 teaspoons of dry spice mixture to make one recipe of sauce.

This is a great pizza sauce!! I used only 1 T. honey, but all other  ingredients as the recipe stated, and it was not sweet at all!! I was looking at trying other pizza sauce recipes from this site, but why bother when I've found the best?? I used a Boboli crust, added cheese, olives, and mushrooms, and satsified my craving for carry out pizza-and being a bit more healthy at the same time! Thank you so much for this recipe!!

I left out the anchovy paste and this sauce was still wonderful.  Very tasty!  This is my recipe from now on.  I doubles the sauce and had the perfect amount for 2 large pizzas as big as my pizza stone.

This sauce had a great flavour and consistancy. I will never buy my pizza sauce again! If this recipe does have a fault, it's that it is a tad too sweet. I may reduce the honey by 1/2 a tablespoon or so next time I make it. Still 5 stars for me though.

Easy and tasty. I used with "Jay's Signature Pizza Crust" and my husband said it was the best pizza he's ever had. Believe me, he isn't afraid to say something I cooked doesn't taste good. Will make regularly. Cheaper and tastier than delivery. (I left out the cayenne, red pepper, and honey)

So simple and so good. I did cut the crushed pepper in half since I was making a pizza for the kids but next time I will make a spicy batch for the hubby and I since we love heat. I will skip the jar stuff from now on and I love the fact I can control the quality of ingredients.

Really a great flavor, but way to sweet for me the first time.  Second time I left out the honey and it was perfect.

I must have tried 7-8 different recipes, before finding this gem.   I keep the dry ingredients mixed in bulk, then add the 2tb to the wet ingredients, and it's an instant success.

Excellent sauce!!  I did leave out the anchovy paste as it's not something I have ever used, so did not have!  I also realized I had no marjoram...don't recall ever having used it either!  Regardless, this sauce has a great spicy kick and it was very yummy on our pizza!  Not much better than homemade sauce and dough for your weekly pizza!

My family loved it.  It was sweet yet had a bit of a kick.  Unlike a previous reviewer, I thought the recipe made plenty of sauce for a good sized pizza (I made a jellyroll pan sized pizza).

This is the 1st time I am rating an all-time low 1-star recipe at All Recipes and I don't think it really lift up to the high rating! I followed recipe to T. except doubling the serving thinking that I could use it later for more pizzas upon seeing the exceptionally high rating. The sauce was too watery and bland hence it went straight down to the crust upon spreading! I had to make another batch of sauce for 2nd and 3rd pizzas! I definitely will not make it again!

My kids liked it!  I'm always looking for ways to get back to the basics and save money, and this recipe works, and it tastes great, too.  I substituted sugar for the honey but will put honey on my shopping list and try it next time.  I omitted anchovies and used Chef Paul Prudhomme's Pizza Magic seasoning.  I also added a little more water to get the consistence I was looking for. I'm happy to find a recipe I can make for 50-75 cents or less as opposed to $2-$3 for a can of store bought pizza sauce.  Less sodium, too.

I've made this many times, but tonight I made it using 12 fl oz of tomato sauce, and no paste or water.  It was phenomenal.  The overall result was actually better than the local pizzeria!  Tomato sauce has less intense flavour than paste, which balances out the flavours of the crust and mozzarella.  I kept the rest the same, and it was divine.

This recipe was great!!! We used it as a pizza sauce and as a spaghetti sauce. I put a teaspoon of garlic powder in place of onion powder. Also added two cloves of garlic. Added about a quarter teaspoon of thyme. Fresh basil tastes great too, instead of ground basil! I skipped oregano because we ran out, but because of all the other ingredients in it, it tasted great! This is definetely my favorite sauce.

I love this pizza sauce. The only change I make is to leave out the honey. It made the sauce a little too sweet for my family's liking.

If you like sweet pizza sauce, this is a great recipe.  I on the other hand don't care for the sweetness, so next time I would leave out, or decrease the honey, then of course also decrease the spiciness since the honey balances the hot spices.  Other than that, it is still a good recipe.

This is definitely going to be the only pizza sauce I'll ever use.  The only thing I did different was not use as much red pepper and red pepper flakes, because we don't like very spicy food, but otherwise wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks Angie!

This flavorful sauce was a hit! Like some others, I substituted about a teaspoon of sugar instead of the honey and used one clove pressed garlic instead of minced from a bottle. I lightly browned the garlic and kept the burner on low while mixing in the ingredients. Also, I left the red pepper flakes for the side. For two pizzas we doubled the recipe and had about 1 c of dipping sauce leftover. I would recommend this sauce to anyone looking for a reliable pizza sauce. Bravo!

I doubled the recipe and  took others advice and used only 1/8t red pepper flakes omitted the other cayenne completely and also omitted the anchovies (we don't like them at all) and used only 1T honey.  Everything else was doubled and mixed well in a large bowl.  Then poured into a glass jar to combine all the flavors and let it sit overnight.  It filled a 240z jar nearly all the way!  Today I made my first ever pizza from this site: Jays Signature pizza crust! YUM, Yum, Yum!  We loved it and we made 2 sm-med size pizzas today and we still have about 1/3 to 1/2  jar of this pizza sauce left!  Wow, super easy to make and it was perfect tasting!  My picky husband which considers himself a pizza expert says this was awesome and he would take this sauce and the pizza I made from this site over any restaurant one, yahoo!  (Except Uno's, lol)

If I could give it more stars I would.  Skipped the anchovy paste and decreased the honey.  I loved it and my husband thought it was the "best pizza sauce he's ever had" which says a lot.  We'll NEVER use store bought again.  Ever.

I had all of the ingredients on hand apart from the anchovy paste, so I didn't use it, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. It was awesome! I thought that it made just the right amount for 2 nights of pizza for my boyfriend and me.  Will certainly make again!!

Fabulous sauce!  We found it alittle spicy, so next time I will cut out the cayenne pepper.  Made just as written.  As written it was not too sweet for us.

I made this recip to use as a dip for a calzone that I made.  I made the following changes: 1) I used 1 clove of garlic grated with a microplane 2) I used 1 TB of Honey 3) I used italian seasoning in place of the individual herbs 4) I used 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper and no ground red pepper  This came out amazing!  I will definetly use this from now on instead of the jarred pizza sauce.  It's so easy to make and much cheaper than buying a jar that I never use up before tossing out.  Thanks!

I omit the anchovy paste and only a pinch of the cayenne and red peppers. Full amount makes it not unbearably spicy, but some family members don't like spice in their sauce. Use with "Jay's Signature Pizza Crust" for homemade pizzas about once a month. Very yummy!

Its not a bad sauce, but a bit heavy on the Parmesan and Honey.  If you tend to like a more tangy, acidic tomato-tasting sauce (like I do), the parmesan mellows out the flavor too much and the honey makes it a bit too sweet.  I'll try it again with those ingredients reduced next time.

Okay all the 1/4  of this and that...just use Italian Seasoning. I didn't have grated parmesan on hand so I used 1 Tbsp of the shaker parmesan. I followed advice of others and halved the honey, it was a perfect sweet but not too...We LOVE this sauce and will NEVER BUY pizza sauce again!!! UPDATE, made again but with tomato sauce and omitted the water...STILL AWESOME!

This is fabulous!!  I was a little uncertain about the honey, but I went with it and was surprised by how good it made the sauce.  It's a little sweet, but has a kick to it.  Very good and was a big hit with the family.

I was pleasantly suprised when I made this sauce last night.  It was thick and tasty and since we reduced the sweet and hot spices it had just a hint of kick to it.  It went great with our toppings and actually tasted alot like the sauce I love at my parents favorite pizza place which moved very far away.  I am so glad to have this recipe and will make it again and again!

This is good and pretty easy.  I think I will mix a bunch of the spices together as mentioned by a previous reviewer and just mix with the other ingredients everytime I make a pizza.  The only thing I will change is to use tomato sauce instead of paste and water (it tastes watery to me) and maybe cut the honey a bit.  All in all, pretty good though.

I made 40 servings of this spaghetti w/ fresh tomatoes from my garden and froze in 2 cup increments.  The sauce is good and I will definately make again, but there are some changes I am going to make.  The honey is too overpowering - I'd recommend at least cutting in half, if not eliminating all together.  (I have to add red pepper flakes when it put it on the pizza to cut the sweetness).  Also, the sauce has a grainy consistency due to the parmesan cheese - I will add it in slowly next time and stop when it overpowers the texture of the sauce.  Otherwise, I think that the flavor will be good next time.  I'm not sure if the problems I noted are because I made so much or if they would be present in smaller amounts, but I think that it definately needs tweaking.

I have never made my own pizza sauce but I will be from now on. It was a little on the spicy side for me but my husband loved it.  I may omit the caynne pepper next time.

This sauce isn't bad but it certainly isn't something to write home about. Also, mine came out a bit too spicy for my taste. I think having a few less ingredients and a couple hours of simmering could have improved it. It tasted flat at first and then  hot. By the next morning the leftovers were inedible. Not an improvement over canned.

Very good flavor, except a little too sweet for our taste. Next batch (yes, I'll definitely make more) I will try it with 1 Tbls. honey. Also, I did leave out the Anchovy Paste, don't own any and wouldn't use it otherwise. That may be why it's too sweet without it? I think I may try using garlic powder/salt instead of the minced because we prefer no chunks. Thanks for the recipe!

This pizza sauce is delicious!  I am so happy I had all the ingredients (sans the anchovy paste).  This was delicious on our homemade pizza dough.  I also think this sauce would be perfect for dipping some homemade breadsticks into!  Yummy!

This was my first time making homemade pizza sauce, and while I loved the simplicity of the directions the sauce turned out a little too sweet for my liking and needed a little more saltiness to the flavor. I excluded both the anchovy paste and cayenne pepper because I did not have them on hand. I will try this again using only 1Tbsp of honey and swap the minced garlic for garlic salt since I wasn't a huge fan of the seemingly raw bits of garlic in my sauce.

Mmmmm! This was wonderful! I really liked the extra spicy kick to it! I am normally sort of a wimp with spicy foods but I loved it, could have been more spicy! I only used half the honey (1T, I did not have any anchovy paste on hand, so I added a bit of salt. Next time I will add the achovy paste. Thank you!

Too much honey. Use 1 tablespoon or 1/2 tablespoon. Was too sweet, other than that it was mighty tasty. Update* I decided to use no honey and prefer it this way. I use a ton of fresh garlic minced too.

Very good pizza sauce!  I omitted the honey, but added a little bit of white sugar to counter the acidity from the tomatoes.  I also reduced the amount of cayenne and pepper flakes by about half, because my family doesn't like a hot/spicy pizza sauce.  This made just enough to cover a pizza made in my jelly roll pan.  I used the Pizza Crust I recipe from this site as the base and topped it with mozzarella and pepperoni.

This pizza sauce makes the pizza!  I've been making homemade pizza for awhile, but the sauce was never outstanding.  This sauce is WONDERFUL.  Don't be afraid of the long list of ingredients, it's worth the time it takes to gather your spices!  We also like microwaving it in a bowl and using as a dipping sauce.  MMMMM!

After first making the sauce I thought it was just alright, a bit too sweet. I  didn't add anything extra though as the recipe stated it would improve with time. After 2 hours it was still a bit too sweet but I used it anyway. I'm glad I did because it was excellent. The flavors married when heated. It was still sweet but not so that it was overwhelmingly. So don't despair and alter the recipe before cooking it. Angie, thanks so much for the recipe.

I've made it twice now.  I used the anchovy paste and think it does add a layer of flavor.  There's nothing fishy about it.  It has a whole sweet/spicy thing going on too.  Not just the best pizza sauce I've made but the best I've ever had.  Reminded me of a pizza shop in Massachusetts that makes  a sweeter sauce.  I'd always wanted pizza like that but not found it until now.

Exquisite is a perfect word to describe this sauce.  We absolutely loved it.  Didn't add the pepper flakes b/c the cayenne is just the right amount of spice for us.  We don't like things spicy hot.  Also, I heated it on the stove as I didn't have a long time to let it sit as many reviewers suggested.  Worked great.  Will use every time!  Oh and I didn't measure the garlic, just squeezed 2 cloves through the press.  Thanks so much for the wonderful yet simple recipe.

This is a great sauce! VERY easy and fast to  make.  My parents used to own an Italian restaurant and made their own pizza sauce.  I think this was better, a little more sweet.  I didn't have any anchovy paste. I'm sure it was just as good without it.

I love this sauce! I cut out the honey because my husband did NOT like it the first time, I did though. I let my kiddies & husband make their own pizza, what a hit!! I used the The-Best-Pizza-Crust recipe on this site. Great combo!! Thanks for the recipe! It was awesome!!!!

Like previous reviews, I agree this sauce is horrible unless it is cooked.  Once cooked, however, it still turns out very, very, sweet---even when I halved the amount of honey included.  If you like sweet italian this is the sauce for you---I'd use little or no honey in the future to get a good, tangy, pizza sauce.

Good sauce, the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating was because of the many ingredients and the fact that we didn't care for it before it was cooked.  My husband and I both tried to use it for marinara dipping sauce, seriously not that good when its "raw".  If I were to try and use it for dipping sauce, I would cook it first.

Excellent -- the best pizza sauce -PERIOD! Super easy -- I used a bit more red pepper & added a couple of pinches of Chipotle Chile powder to spice it up--it's hard to believe something this quick & easy to make could be this good. Combine this sauce with the pizza dough II recipe on this site, add your favorite toppongs --toss it on the grill & 5 minutes later you'll have the best pizza in town. For me, this is the standard against which all other sauce recipes will be measured. Try it!

This stuff was awesome. Excellent flavor, no cooking involved, easy ingredients. I know I did some changes to the seasonings because I don't like spicy. Didn't use much chili powder and no flakes, just cumin instead. Also, I don't measure my chopped garlic, but I used two small cloves because really, on pizza, you can never have enough minced garlic. Yummy, thanks for this!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was very tasty. I did add the anchovy paste, and the salt as other reviewers had recommended. I thought it tasted like a pizza sauce you would get at a good restaurant.

Nothing was appealing to me at all (and I'm not exactly a pizza snob). The color was muddy, but the flavor was not good. The reason I'm giving it one star is because I couldn't find a high quality anchovy paste and had to settle for an inexpensive brand. Don't know if that's enough to make a huge difference.

This is a DELICIOUS sauce (yet it is pretty thick)...I made this minus the anchovies & used just 1 Tbsp. honey...You may want to add a tad more water, until you can easily spread it. Used this w/ the 'Jay's Signature Pizza Crust' recipe from this site.

This sauce is really good. I did make a few changes...I didn't have any pepper flakes or cayenne pepper so I omitted them. I also used a little less water than called for, but that is just personal preferance. I will definately make this again! Thanks for sharing!

Very good sauce!  The only thing I do different is eliminate the parmasean cheese.  I think the recipe calls for way too much.  But this is definitely a keeper.

I thought this pizza sauce was just OK.  I thought I would try making a sauce instead of buying the premade stuff and I don't think the taste was good enough for me to make the permanent switch.  Too much trouble for just ok results.

wow Very nice! I chose this recipe not only because of the good ratings, but I didn't want to make a Gallon of sauce. It turns out this would be the perfect amount for two 14" pizzas! The sauce tasted alittle sweet, but once baked it was just right!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a great pizza sauce! I think this will surely replace the stuff in the jar!!! Very easy to make too. The ONLY reason it didn't get the fifth star is because it was a little on the sweeter side than what I cared for. Next time I may omit the honey and replace it with a little cinnamon.

Perfect - don't skimp on the anchovy!  I actually used a large can of crushed tomatoes, no water and a bit of concentrated tomato paste out of the tube.  It is spicy and tastes similar to a sauce that used to be used at a pizza place called Red Boys that was the best ever! I love this!

Fabulous! I had no idea it was so easy to make, you won't catch me buying this stuff at the store anymore! I was skeptical about the honey but I truly think it's the key to this recipe. I did skip the anchovy paste, however.

This sauce is absolutely delicious.  It sounded weird because of the tomato paste and water instead of tomatoes or tomato sauce but forget about it.  The sauce is complex, savory and just a hint of sweetness.  It's just perfect.  Definitely make the night before so the flavors meld.

This sauce is much like my own recipe, minus the anchovy flavoring. I like this recipe, but still prefer to use sugar instead of honey. I always start with onions and minced garlic, saute in olive oil. I stead of water I use 6 oz of tomato sauce to keep the tomato flavor rich. Try using a few fennel seeds to add flavor as well. Good recipe.

I was amazed at how easily this came together never having made my own sauce before.  I will always do it this way from now on. I mixed a large batch of the spices together , the next time I do that I will be light of the red pepper, I think this batch got a lot or I measured wrong. Very good!

I had made this recipe with the intentions of it being enough for the two pizza pies that I had already started and realized that this was only about enough sauce for one pizza. So I started looking for another sauce to make with the ingredients that I had left and I came across another sauce. I mixed what I had left of the "Exquisite Pizza Sauce" with the  "Easy Pizza Sauce I" recipe from this site and it happened to be the best pizza sauce ever. I left out the anchovy paste and the marjoram from the Exquisite Pizza Sauce and the rosemary from the Easy Pizza Sauce I, those where the only modifications that I made. My family was personally very pleased with the results.

This recipe has multiple uses. I, like other users only used one table spoon of Honey, but followed the rest of the recipe to the letter and used it on my pizza, and everyone loved it! Mega kudos to the Canadian Inventor in AZ. 

I had a lot left over, so, I added diced tomatos, placed the rest in a sauce pan and placed it on medium heat, and I added two slices of Provalone Cheese. 

I boiled up some angel hair, and added some Italian marinaded chicken (which I baked) and boom, Chicken Carbonara!!! This pizza sauce can be easliy converted to a carbonara sauce. Thank you thank you thank you!

Great recipe.  Everyone loved it, but I think I am going to make a couple of changes next time.  Firstly, decrease Parmesan to 2 tablespoons and honey to 1 tablespoon.  The cheese is simply a personal preference, but the honey is probably a necessity because I thought the sauce too sweet and tasting of honey.  Will make again.  It was good.

We liked this recipe, but I decreased the honey to 1 tablespoon, good thing, because it was almost too sweet at that. Also increased the water to 1 Cup. I didn't have any anchovie paste, but I am sure that would have made it better. We like spicy so I increased the spices down the line with the exception of the peppers. All in all I will use this recipe again, but will use a little less honey about 2 tsp.

This recipe is stuff that legends are made of! I nix the honey, double (or triple) the chili flakes & add 1/4 teaspoon of cumin & it turns out better than almost any sauce I've had any restaurant.

Great overall flavor, but I think I will cut the honey by 2/3rds as it was a bit sweet for me. 

Thanks!

This is a great recipe!  I followed some of the other reviewer's comments and added just a sprinkle of cayenne pepper (I don't really like anything too spicy).  I didn't have honey, so I used 1/2 Tbsp of sugar.  The balance of swwet and spice was just perfect.  Thanks!

Mmmmm! This is some really good sauce. At first taste I thought it seemed too sweet, but it really grew on me. I didn't have any marjoram, but it was great without it. I did add a bit more oregano and cayenne pepper. Yum!

I was not a fan the first time I made this.  I tried it again but sauted chopped onion (omit onion powder) and garlic in olive oil and then added the rest of the ingredients.  I added just a squirt of honey for sweetness.  Much better.

This was very very good.  I never knew what it was that made pizza sauce...pizza sauce!  Now, I not only know, but I can make it!  It was great! Next time I wont put in the cayenne, not because I didn't like it, but it was to spicy for the kids-although they ate it as well.  YUM!

I made a few changes - I added more cayenne and chili flakes (at least a teaspoon)and used fresh basil instead of dried plus a little fresh Italian parsely.  I did not use marjoram and doubled the oregano.   The resulting sauce had a wonderful flavor with a nice kick. I prefer my sauces to have a chunkier texture, so I made it a second time with fresh tomatoes added in...simply delicious.  If you don't want to use fresh tomatoes, I bet canned would work perfectly - I've added them to my other sauces before.

This sauce was very good overall - I did not have red pepper flakes or white pepper on hand though.  I doubled the recipe for the large pizza I used it on and next time I will cut back on the honey a bit (even half it) because the sauce was a bit sweet for my taste.

I love this pizza sauce.  It makes quite a bit, so you will have enough for two pizzas.  It is a bit spicy - but that is what I really like about it.

This did come out very sweet.  I omitted the anchovy paste and used half the amount of onion powder due to preference.  It makes a ton & is better blended the next day. Might want to add a little more water, it comes out pretty thick.

This was flavorful, but also a bit sweet. This sauce definitely stands on it's own and doesn't need much in the way of toppings for taste on a pizza. Lots of taste here. This would be a great dipping sauce for breadsticks or pizza rolls. I didn't have anchovy paste. It made a lot, I made 1 14 inch pizza and there is plenty of sauce in the fridge for another day, another pizza or two. Thanks Angie for sharing this great dipping/pizza sauce with us.

This was a pretty good sauce. I didn't have any marjoram, and I only put about a tbs of honey - I don't like sweet sauces - but besides that, prepared as directed. It made enough for 3 12-inch pizzas, but I am not real heavy on sauce, about 3-4 good spoonfuls per pizza.

This is a great sauce.  Like others, I did double the recipe and cut the honey in half.  I also cut the cayenne pepper in half as well.  This recipe is definitely worth a try!

I have been using this pizza sauce for a couple years now.  My family loves it. My changes: I use tomato sauce with no added water and I skip the peppers (as my kids won't eat it), I add the pepper flakes to the top of my pizza.  I also make a double batch and freeze the other half.  It freezes well.  Very tasty!

I was so excited when I found this recipe. However, it was not appetizing to me.  I could not finish my second piece of pizza.  If you aren't sure about trying this, I would try something else.

Really good pizza sauce!  The best I've tried and I've tried a lot!  A little sweeter than I like so might decrease the honey next time but otherwise perfect!  We don't like our sauce too thick so this actually made enough for 2 pizzas for us.  I just froze the other half to save for next time.

A little too sweet for my taste- will reduce the honey next time.  I had to add about 1 additional cup of water to get it to the right consistency- it was way too thick.  Excellent blend of flavors though.

Excellent sauce, I added one can of kraft pizza sauce  to the mix, cut back the honey to 1 tablespoon and increased the herbs. Kept the anchovy paste, I think it adds a little something. I paired this with  Jay's Signature Pizza Crust and my house smelled like a  real pizzeria and the taste of the pizza was that of a pizzeria style. It's a keeper.

As of right now the sauce is still in the pan, but GREAT flavor! Can't wait for the zaa. I don't like sauces to sweet so I cut the honey in half. And a touch more herbs than instructed. Awesome pizza sauce!

I've been making this sauce for over a year now and felt like I should give it the well deserved 5 stars it already has. My 16 & 18 year old sons would rather eat pizza made with this sauce than any devlivery pizza.

This is the best pizza sauce ever!  It is slightly thick and sweet thanks to the honey.  One recipe can easily make two pizzas.  So delicious!!!

Very good, for me it was missing a slight bit of garlic & salt, but that is easy to fix on the go.  Ohterwise very nice texture & no sign of that spaghetti sauce taste.

A little too sweet and a lot too hot both at the same time.  May improve by halving the honey and cayenne/red pepper.

I'm sorry to rate this recipe so low...but I'm really disappointed in this one after all the rave reviews.  Just a weird mix of flavors...I didn't even put it on my pizza as I didn't want to waste more ingredients than I already had.  Won't be making this again.

Wow. This was great. Unfortunately, I could not get any anchovy paste, but I followed the rest of the recipe exact. It tasted wonderful on the italian sausage and mushroom pizza that I made. On certain pizzas, I might tone the sweetness down just a bit, but on this one, it was perfect.

This is really delicious, but a little bit too sweet.  I will only use half of the honey next time (as suggested by others).  I ommitted the anchovy paste (don't like it) and majorjam (didn't have it) but otherwise made it as described.  This really tasted like a special sauce, so much better than the bland canned sauces!

I liked the sauce and I will surely use it again. It was a little on the sweet side though and next time I will definitely cut the honey down just a little.

This was excellent!  

We did make one change though, and put only 1 Tbsp. of Honey in instead of 2 Tbsp.

Absolutely Delicious!  Thanks!

This was great for our homemade pizza (used "Amazing Whole Wheat Pizza Crust" recipe from this site).  It's so quick and easy to maek and much better than jar sauce.  Next time we're making it for a pizza with Bacon-Cheeseburger toppings.

Sorry - after reading the reviews I expected this to be a lot better than it actually was. Way too spicy - the cayenne AND red pepper flakes were too much. If I make it again I will leave one of them out. However, my boyfriend said he sure wouldn't complain if I made it again.

This is incredible pizza sauce! Only change I made to this recipe is reduced honey to 1T as we don't like it too sweet and other reviewers suggested this.  Don't skip the anchovy paste...I was tempted to, but it definitly adds flavor and not a distinct "fishy" flavor like I expected.  I make this sauce everytime we have home-made pizza (and try the Amazing Whole Wheat pizza crust, as another reviewer suggested....wonderful together!)

This recipe makes a sweeter pizza sauce. That's how I like it.  I absolutely LOVE this recipe.  I have been searching forever to find a sauce like the one that the pizaria in my hometown made.  I've found it.  I used Jay's pizza crust.  I made them ahead of time and put them in the fridge for the day.  The baked up beautifully.

I made a spinach, artichoke & mushroom pizza using this sauce.  It was very good.. but my husband and I thought it was too sweet.  This recipe has 5 star potential.  Next time I will add only a drop of honey and double the garlic.

This pizza sauce has potential.  I would not add honey because it was way too sweet.  It's a good base to create your own sauce though.  Thanks for the recipe.

Not bad....not good, either.  Easy to make with ingredients I had on-hand.  I thought it was a trifle sweet; if I make again I'll most likely cut the honey in half and add more anchovy paste.  But I don't think I'll be making again.

My family LOVED this sauce!  We have been in toronto for three years, and haven't been able to find any pizza places that compare to what we were used to in the States.  This sauce was it!  We tend to like sweeter sauces, so I used what the recipe called for.  I'll definitely make this one again!  Thanks!

We used this for a pizza party and it was great! I used only a couple of teaspoons of honey as suggested and it was plenty sweet. We had all the grandkids and friends so next time I will also cut down on the cayenne because It does have a bit of a bite which I love but did not go over well with  little ones.

This is very good.  So much better than any canned sauces I have purchased!  Made as the side sauce for calzones.  I think that it must be even better as a pizza sauce and I can't wait to try!

Almost perfect, with half the honey, and a 1 tsp addition of garlic salt.  Both my sister and husband agreed they like this sauce over my usual, so I plan to replace my recipe with this one.  This sauce is very flavorful, not for the timid!

I usually use regular pasta sauce for my pizza but this was a nice change. I prefer spicy to sweet though so next time I will cut down the honey and add more red pepper.

IMHO the sauce was just ok, the flavors were to strong and a little sweet vs spicy, I think I'll keep looking for that perfect sauce. Thanks for the recipe anyway.

This is a great sauce. I doubled it but not quite all the ingredients.  I only put 1 tablespoon of honey, no anchovy paste and I did the rest of the spices to our family's taste.  It has a great flavor. Even with cutting back on the honey, I could still taste a hint of sweet - just enough in my opinion.  Doubling the recipe made enough for two BIG pizzas tonight with some left over for cheese sticks this weekend.  My husband said it was good, but still thinks Chef Boyardee is better. I happen to disagree!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This is a fabulous sauce.  I will never buy store bought pizza sauce again.  I left out the anchovy paste and it was still really good.  Tastes great if you make the sauce ahead of time and let it sit in the fridge overnight.  Use this with Jay's Signature Pizza Crust.  YUM!

This was the first time that I've made homemade pizza..unless you can count the box kind. My whole family loved this pizza...they said it was the best they've ever eaten. I made this sauce along with Jay's Signature Pizza crust, and doubled both recipes. I made one pepperoni pizza, and one with "hot" pork sausage and mushrooms. This will definitely be a regular in our house!

I was a little disappointed with this sauce. The honey taste was a bit overpowering and it was a tad too spicy. I also was not crazy about the anchovy paste. I will make this again but next time I will use brown sugar instead of honey, leave out the paste, and add some salt (it needed it. I'll also leave out the red pepper flakes.

Not really what I expected for taste.  But it did the job when it came down to no Pizza sauce and dough waiting to be slathered.  Not bad, but not great either.

This is so good.  I cut back on the amount of honey added, and there is just enough of a kick to make it delish!!  Will definitely use again, and I don't have to wait for it to simmer all day!

I love making anything from scratch that I can and this pizza sauce is great to make in a big batch and freeze for future use.  It beats anything store-bought.  I don't use anchovy paste, though, because I've just never bothered to buy it.  Tastes great without it!  Thank you!

Delicious! I used 1/2 T. sugar instead of honey and cut down on the peppers (two little boys who don't care for spicy), and used half white wine and half water. Hubby raved about it. Quite possibly the easiest *good* pizza sauce I've made.

This was good and my family liked it, but I think the flavors could be a little more subtle.  That is probably why most sauces are cooked over long periods of time - to blend, mellow and richen without overpowering.  But I would use it again in a pinch.

This recipe is okay.  Nothing spectacular, which is what I expect if I'm going to make my own sauce rather than use store-bought.  I halved the honey and omitted the red pepper flakes b/c I didn't want it too hot for the kids, but the flavor just wasn't what I'd expected.  It was good, but nothing special, so I probably won't use it again.

A good recipe, but overall a little sweet.  Also, it began to separate after a while.  Great if you're in the mood for a heavy sauce that has a lot of flavor.  Thanks!

Terrific sauce, and so easy to prepare!  I left out the anchovy paste and added no salt, but followed the rest of the recipe as is.  I was initially worried about the sweetness and the spiciness, but the spiciness is mellowed once the sauce is spread on a pizza, and I balanced the sweetness by using sharp, salty toppings (Gruyere cheese, sauteed spinach, etc.).  I plan to try using the leftover sauce for lasagna.

This was great.  The kids as well as the adults liked this recipe.  I didn't have everything so I had to fudge a little on the spices, but it still came out great.  A little sweet and spicey.  Very good and will make this again for sure.

This sauce surprised me when I tasted it.  First the initial sweet and then the spicy.  It was quite good, however, I made some revisions as others suggested.  I cut the amounts of honey and red pepper flakes in half, added only a pinch of cayenne (my tummy can't handle spicy well), and added two tbsp of white wine, which enhances the flavour!   
I am adding this one to my recipe book.  Thanks!

This is a fantastic pizza sauce!  It has the perfect sweet/spicy combination.  Normally I don't like spicy things...I head straight for the mild section, however, this was great!  I omitted the cayenne pepper and anchovie paste because I didn't have any on hand.  I've used it several times now and each time my husband has raved about it!  This is the recipe we will use from now on!  Thanks! :o)

Best pizza sauce I have ever had, although I made a few changes..........
I substituted 1 tsp sugar for all the honey and used 1/2 the water called for. I didn't use the anchovies, basil, marjoram or parmesan. Instead sprinkle the parmesan on the pizza crust after you spread the sauce; adds more flavour. Came out perfect. Thank you for sharing!

This is the best sauce I had ever tasted! It's so full of flavour and it's just the right level of hotness. I didn't put in the cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes, but I am definitely not buying anymore preserved sauces because this is just THE BEST!! And the best thing is: I DON'T HAVE TO CRY OVER THE ONION!!! I really recommend this.

Easy and delicious.  Why buy sauce in a jar when it's this easy to make your own.  I skipped the cayenne and the red pepper flakes because I made the sauce for kids' pizza.  A keeper.

very good.  A tad sweet, but tasty.  I'm going to add 1/2 the honey next time.  Kept a long time in the refrigerator, too.  Great for dipping breadsticks in, too!

My teenager loved it! I didn't have anchovies to put in it, but it was excellent. I skipped the honey since I don't like honey anywhere but on biscuits. I did add a couple of teaspoons of sugar to round out the tomato paste. I would say this is a winner. Quite spicy!

This is the BEST sauce for pizza my family had ever had. Since starting our family, pizza baking at home has become a ritual and this is the only sauce my family likes now. Tangy with lots of parmesan cheese. We alter a bit by omitting the honey and anchovies, though. Still excellent, and covers a 9x13 bar pan crust perfectly.

I didnt see what the hype was, but there arent a lot of recipes for pizza sauce, so I will be sticking with this one.  Its alright, but its too sweet, and I left half the honey out like everyone recommended.  Hmmmmm not sure what else to do about this one, maybe no honey next time.

I thought this sauce was excellent!  I omitted the anchovy paste and the honey and added a little extra garlic.  Use with Jay's Pizza Crust, it makes a great homemade pizza!

This is REALLY good! I skipped the honey and anchovy paste. I used 1/2 t brown sugar to sweeten a little. We put this on Jay's Signature Pizza Crust. I've been making homemade pizza for years and this is the combo I'm sticking with. Thanks Angie!

Very good, put all the ingredients into a hand blender mixing container and had a very quick sauce with very few dishes. Key ingredient - anchovy paste (a must).

If you love a spicy pizza sauce, this sauce is great!  My family loves it, especially on Jay's Pizza Crust.  I also like adding a little more cayenne pepper and crushed red pepper.  A wonderful find!

I really enjoyed this sauce, and will definitely make it again.  I will use a little less honey next time, as I thought it was just a tad too sweet.  It was so much better than the average pizza sauce.  Those are always too harsh and sour for me, so this one was a refreshing change.

I personally LOVED this pizza sauce. I thought the combination of flavors was divine! My husband, although he liked it, said it was a little on the sweet side for his taste. Perhaps it was because of the honey, but I didn't think it was sweet at all...just plain yummy.

I substituted the tomato paste for 8 oz. of tomato sauce and eliminated the water.  I used about 1 tsp of honey and it was perfect!  I will use it again!

Delicious, easy, no-cook recipe with ingredients that most would probably have on hand. Better than the store-bought stuff, too.  When it comes to sweetening or spices,  I find that you have to start with lesser amounts and add more to what suits your tastes. I saw a review that mentioned too sweet and hot. I cut back by about half on the honey, and it was sweet enough for me. Besides using this on a homemade pizza, I have a little leftover that I plan to try over pasta. Thanks for the recipe Angie!

Very good, doubled it since I was making mini pizzas for the whole family and I wasn’t sure how much it would make. It made way to much, froze the remainder. I may use some chunky stewed tomatoes next time to give some texture.

I'd use half the honey next time - a bit too sweet for me, but then again, I didn't add the anchovie paste so perhaps that's the difference.

Edit: I'm back after my third time making this delicious recipe and after the first time we have started doubling the recipe when we make our standard dough recipe (makes 3 12" pizzas) because it's so delicious everyone wants a small bowl of it on the side to dip their pizza into.  I probably add a bit less honey but that's us.

Just delicious! I didn't have the anchovy on hand, I'll do that next time.  Also had to sub a drizzle of agave instead of the honey and I used a light hand seeing as how I didn't have anchovies.  Did NOT employ a light hand with the garlic! I used my microplane to grate several cloves (lost count) into a paste and added to the sauce.  Otherwise I followed it to a T.  This was a spontaneous dinner after I found some bread dough in the freezer and decided to turn it into a pizza.  From my point of view, this sauce perfected my plan.

As is, the recipe was a little too bland. I ended up putting a lot more garlic and red pepper flakes.

We absolutely love this pizza sauce, it has just the perfect amount of sweetness and spiciness to it! We have made it 3 times already and plan on making this our to go sauce, we even used it once as a substitute for mozzarella sauce one night when we made mozzarella cheese sticks for dinner.

We made this and it was very good!  We left out the red pepper flakes to tone down the spice for our three littles and they ate it up.  We doubled it because of what another reviewer wrote about the recipe not making much and we had more than enough for two pizzas.  We have enough for at least two more but then we don't like a lot of sauce on our pizzas.

It was too watery, too bland for my tastes. I actually cooked it to reduce the moisture content a little or a lot. And added anchovies for a bit of a kick

I really wish I had read the reviews so I knew it would be too sweet. I trusted the rating and added the full 2 tbsp of honey. I did skip the cayenne and chilli flakes because I knew that heat wasn't wanted on my pizza. I wish there weren’t so many 5 stars ratings that are for people’s renditions of the recipe...

I made this on grilled pizza exactly as read. I enjoyed it very much, my son and boyfriend found it a lil too sweet but otherwise was a wonderful blend of spice. I will use again (maybe in theirs use a lil less honey), but again I enjoyed it. I prefer my sauce a lil sweeter. Thank you!!! Made homemade pizza quick and easy to get on the table and much healthier than delivery.

This us the second time I have made this. The first time without anchovy paste and this time with it. It is wonderful! I make my pizzas on naan bread and it will make quite a few of those. I’m going to freeze portions in baggies to use for a quick dinner after Zumba.

Best pizza sauce ever! I make up large batches and freeze it in individual pizza sauce sachets. I also cut the honey down just a bit to 1 1/2 tablespoons rather than 2, but otherwise followed the recipe.

Excellent pizza sauce! I like to enhance the Costco take-n-bake pepperoni pizza with this sauce and some extra mozzarella cheese. For the sauce, I throw everything into the Vitamix, give it a whirl, done!

This pizza sauce is really delicious!! I didn’t have fresh garlic so I use garlic powder. I also didn’t use no anchovy paste as I didn’t have any. I made this sauce the night  before I made the pizza crust (from Allrecipe website) for flavor enhancement. Other than that, I follow the recipe as written and will be making this pizza sauce again. Thanks for sharing!

Not bad sauce. Only change I’d make, is a little less pepper. A tad spicy, but all in all, I’d make it again.

Delish!!!!  Made exactly as written (except didn't have marjoram)  So easy to make.  Made in morning and chilled all day.  Cayenne and red pepper just add a little warmth in the back of throat but not anything really hot.

Made this recipe as written.  Nice thick consistency.  As with other reviewers, found it was too sweet and spicy.  Will try it again following others' recommendations, cutting the honey in half and adding either the cayenne or pepper flakes but not both.  Would also like to try others recommendations of substituting some wine or tomato sauce for some or all of the water.

I was really expecting a spicier sauce based on the reviews, which it was not. The anchovy and honey flavor also was just a smidge too strong. I started with only half of the recipe amount for each of those and it was perfect, but I got too excited and added the second half and it was too much. Next time I'll keep the anchovy and honey to half the amount and hopefully this will bring out the spice a bit more.

I would definitely make this sauce again. No cooking the sauce prior to applying to the pizza. What's not to love about that? We like heat, so I wasn't worried about that portion of the reviewer's comments. I did use the anchovy paste, as I had it, and wanted to see what the addition of that was like for the recipe as written.  I backed off on the honey at the beginning  and then added the full amount as I did use the anchovy paste. We thought the sauce was easy and delicious. Will save this one for sure!

Just blah. Was told "nothing to write home about" and I'd have to agree. Tasted like bottled, just from scratch. Think I'll give up on red sauces for pizza. Kudos for using honey instead of sugar :)

This is now my all time favorite!! Wow! Super easy and flavor! I just used Italian Seasoning because I was lazy and 3x the garlic because...its garlic...I didn't add red pepper flakes and pretty glad I didn't because it was plenty hot...but I did add a bit extra cayenne. I added extra salt to tame the heat and everyone loved the pizzas...done on the grill! Will do again!!

Very easy sauce. It started out a bit too sweet, I might cut back on the amount of sweetener next time. I used maple syrup instead of honey because that is what I had. I did add a bit more garlic. It gets better the longer you let it sit and it gets drier as the herbs rehydrate. I did have to add more water to it to make it spread easy but it didn't comprise the flavor. We will definitely be using this again.

This was incredibly easy. Followed the recipe exactly. Didn’t find it to sweet or spicy. I did have to add more garlic and spices to it to fit our personal taste but wow. I will definitely be using this again many times. Who knew pizza sauce was this easy to make and way cheaper than store bought.

Perfect! I was born and raised in NYC and moved to Ohio when I was 25. I miss good pizza! This sauce with the Master Pizza Dough recipe (also on AR) has given me the closest thing to NY pizza since moving!

This pizza sauce is aptly named, absolutely exquisite! I don’t buy pizza sauce anymore, because this is so very good and well worth the small amount of effort to make! I use local honey and let it sit on the counter for a couple of hours then use some and freeze some.

Is a bit sweet, just used less honey to taste, didn't have anchovies so I used a dash of Thai fish sauce which worked great.  Very flavorful.

I use this sauce for EVERYTHING... pizza, pasta, dipping... everything. It's so flavorful and easy to mix up quickly. As long as you keep it in air-tight container, it'll keep for at least a week. This sauce is the reason I've started making home-made pizza. My friends and family can't get enough of it and I've even jarred some up to give as presents and get more requests every time (I've since started including a little card with the recipe on it because of all the requests)!

This is an original idea on a pizza sauce but not to my taste. The relatively dry consistency could be useful if you have a problem with soggy crust.

This is a keeper and I believe I will make this again rather than buying prepared pizza sauce. I did not have anchovy paste (and quite honestly was nervous about this ingredient) and substituted 1 tsp of Worcestershire sauce instead. I also did not have marjoram in my pantry. Even so, it was delicious. A tad sweet, but I wouldn't change it.

In the place of the green spices, I used Pensey's Tuscan Sunset Italian Blend. I had to add just a touch more water to get the right consistency. This was the first time I have made homemade pizza sauce and will never use store-bought  again. I will change nothing the next time I make it. The sauce is delicious!

This is a great sauce, I agree with the other reviewers that it’s a little on the sweet side. I’ll be cutting the honey down for the next batch but still far better than canned sauce.

Delicious.  Everyone who has had this sauce on pizza asks about it.  I don't use the anchovy paste, pepper flakes, or parmesan as I don't have those around.  And I use half the honey.   I make a double batch and freeze half so it is easier to make pizza next time.  Just make sure to give it time to thaw and maybe drain off the watery bit that has separated or mix it in very well.

This wins my vote for favorite QUICK pizza sauce. Minus one star because it's disgustingly sweet as written -- I always reduce the honey by half. I've never added the optional anchovy paste.

Just made this for the first time. Followed it almost exactly except I used some jalapeno honey that I picked up in Idaho and used a 1/4 teaspoon of finely ground pepper flakes (and completely omitted cayenne). Even used the anchovy paste. I used a good tomato paste (Pastene), fresh garlic, and grated the parmesan. It was so easy to make.

I'm not sure I'll ever buy a jar of sauce from the store again. Friday night pizza night just got a WHOLE LOT better.

Now all I have to do is learn how to perfect a homemade crust...

I agree that the honey could be cut in half, though not eliminated. I added salt to combat the sweetness. I didn't think it was too spicy, but perhaps a bit sweet. But some people like sweet sauce. I doubled the recipe and will freeze what I didn't use.

Followed instructions.   Made two different pizzas, one with very little sauce and one with extra sauce.    Did not really care for either.

I'd entitle this recipe "Exquisite AND Accessible."  The kids enjoyed it as much as the adults, which is a rare feat in this household.  I did not add the optional anchovies, and I don't know if that would have changed my family's appreciation of this or not.  I doubled the recipe and had some left over, but not a ton left over.

This is my standard pizza sauce receipe. It makes enough for two 15” pizzas. I love the taste of the sauce. I like to put alot of sauce on my pizza crust and load the cheese mushrooms bell peppers, etc. Its soooooo good. I usually triple the receipe so that i always have lots of sauce on hand to make pizza whenever I feel the urge. It freezes well too!

Tasted great with half the honey. I used 3/4 teaspoon of Italian seasoning instead of measuring the herbs separately.  It does thicken quite a bit if you make it ahead. You may need to add a bit more water.

Sauce turned out perfect for pizza! I recommend making two servings of this sauce so you have some extra to dip the crust in (or freeze for later). I added 3 oz extra water to make it slightly thinner. Great flavor!

I am only giving it 4 stars because I changed the recipe some.  I added  1/3 C minced onion and 6 slices of minced pepperoni, browning that in 2T butter adding  the dry spices at the end because browning the spices brings out the flavors.  I only added 1tsp of honey, used freshly grated pecorino parmesan cheese.  I added a 2 T of white wine (chardonay).  I left out the  pepper flakes.   Was really good.  I know is it really the same recipe after those additions?

This sauce is perfect and it's incredibly easy to make. The minced garlic and honey give this a nice blend that separates it from other sauces. This sauce is better than most delivery places!

The best sauce I've found so far.  Even my youngest commented on how good it was and he didn't know I'd changed out the normal sauce.  Made as written.  It even works well for thick crust Sicilian style pizza.  When making thick crust add a few extra dabs of anchovy paste randomly on the dough for added flavor.

This is a fantastic pizza sauce! My SO and I love it and we look forward to making it again. I halved the amount of honey and took out the pepper flakes (even did a little less than I was supposed to on the cayenne) as some suggested. I didn’t have anchovy paste on hand but I think this sauce was AMAZING either way!

Love this sauce... but I did not use the anchovies (allergies). It gets 10 stars from my household.

This is a great sauce as is but the second time around I adjusted it to my taste. I prefer a less sweet and more spicy sauce so I only used 1.5 tbsp of honey. I used 1 tsp oregano and added 1 tsp Italian seasoning.

Very nice flavor. I picked fresh oregano and basil from my garden and chopped up fine to add to sauce. Didn’t have anchovy paste on hand but added some extra seasoning to compensate.

I have made this recipe many, many times.  I have made it exactly as given (wonderful) but usually I omit the pepper flakes because they give just a bit more kick than my family likes (although I like them).  Also, since my wife grows it in the back yard I'll use fresh Basil when available.

This is the best pizza sauce we have ever had.  Homemade pizza is now our favorite; better than any delivery or restaurant.  We left out the honey and cayenne.  I think the anchovy paste is the secret.

The sauce turned out a tiny bit too liquidish for me, so if you like your sauce a little thicker consider cutting a little bit on the water...

I really liked it, and agree that the anchovy paste is not optional. The main changes I made are to reduce the honey (1 T rather than 2 T) and to use tomato sauce (8 oz) rather than paste. When I cook for my family, I also reduce the spice (they don't like hot things). I find this recipe to taste amazing and have had many people appreciate it and compliment me for it. I also took up one of the suggestions, which was to multiply everything by 8 and then just use 2 teaspoons of it each time.

Great pizza sauce!  Easy to make.  I didn't add the pepper as my kids think EVERYTHING is spicy, but it still came out fabulous.  Will make again for sure!

Excellent!  Never cooked with anchovy paste, but there has to be a reason it's an Italian staple, right?  I'll be looking up more recipes to use it in.  Made this recipe with listed ingredients with these exceptions: no extra salt as the paste is salty, no red pepper flakes because 1 kid doesn't like too spicy and 1 Tbs honey as I don't like sweet pizza sauce.  So delicious.  Slightly spicy with a smokey taste.  Tons of flavor.  I used it on portabello mushroom caps with turkey pepperoni and mozzeralla cheese.  Used mini bagel halves for the kids.  I would use it as a pasta sauce too.

This pizza sauce is perfect as the recipe stands, but occasionally  I use half the tomato paste and half the water to end up with a very robust sauce that will cover one 12 inch pie perfectly.  It is a very easy sauce to make, and if you make extra it keeps in the refrigerator just fine (just remember to take it out a few hours before using it, this sauce works best at room temperature).

The sauce was good overall, though when I make it again I will probably eliminate the cayenne pepper. Even with just an eighth of a teaspoon, it made it too spicy.

I just finished eating and the taste was very nice.  But it is a tad spicy and I think I would cut back on the cayenne and the honey.  Other than that it was really good.  I will definitely experiment further with this recipe and try and perfect the combination of flavors.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, until now I was lost as to how to go about making pizza sauce.  Now I know how and I will pass this along to my mom.

This sauce is great!  I will be using it from now on for sure!  I didn't have anchovies, so I just bumped up the salt. I also just used Italian Seasoning instead of the Italian herbs listed separately because I was out of a few of them, and it was still awesome!  I did add fennel seeds. Don't skip the cayenne or pepper flakes!  I never thought to add cayenne to Italian sauces, but I certainly will from now on! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was a terrible disappointment considering it has such high ratings.  Reading the reviews after having made it, I realize almost everybody is modifying this recipe and then giving good ratings for their own version, which is misleading.  I always put sugar in my tomato sauces - it brings out the tomato flavor.  But the 2 tbsp of honey in this recipe is way too much.  My sauce tasted like honey.  Generally simple is better with pizza sauce.  This has way to many ingredients and generally way too much of each ingredient.

I cut the honey in half, doubled the red pepper flakes and omitted the cayenne. It's delicious as a pizza sauce; I use it for eggplant parm as well.

This is a great recipe, I didn't have Marjoram, and I only added the chili-flakes, not the cayenne.  I cut the honey some because I didn't have the optional anchovie paste.  I can only imagine how the missing ingredients add to this fantastic base recipe.  Will be stocking the missing ingredients and making a batch of spices to use for the next million times I make pizza!  Thanks!

OMG, this recipe is Fantabulous!!! I substituted 32 oz can of San Mariano peeled tomatoes instead of paste and water. I followed all other ingredients. On accident I used 1/2 teaspoons instead of 1/4 for the seasoning and herbs. I will use this recipe for all future Homemade Pizza nights for sure!! Thank You for sharing.

This is  an awesome pizza sauce.  Perfect texture...I only changed the honey from 2 to 1 tbl., other  than that it's perfect for 1 large or 2 small pizzas

I would make this again, but I did reduce the amount of honey by half, it was too sweet otherwise.

I tried this because everyone seemed to love it. I even doubled the recipe to make two pies! If you are from Jersey and used to the best pizza around - this is a very sweet sauce. Even with salt! I won’t be making it again.

This was the best pizza sauce I have ever tried, and I have tried A LOT!  I don't know why I always thought you had to cook pizza sauce.  The only thing I did differently was too use McCormick Italian spice instead of them all separately.  It was tasty and a very easy base to tweak to your own taste.

This is the best pizza sauce we have ever made.  We follow the recipe to the letter.  We measure out 8 ounce containers for the freezer (we make the 36 servings - love that you can adjust the recipes in here).  We also use this for spaghetti  sauce just  add a little more water to thin it down.

ANCHOVY PASTE!!! WHAT? Calm down, it doesn’t add a fishy taste at all. I stuck with with the original recipe minus  the hot pepper flakes and it was excellent. I beg you to please, please give this sauce a try. The flavor is not to homemade but not at all store bought. It’s a perfect in between of the two. My family and I didn’t find this to be very sweet like other reviewers had mentioned. Maybe it was the brand of honey I used. I love how easy it is to make and requires no cooking. Fast, easy and delicious! My family loves it and I’m certain yours will to.

Only thing I would add is fennel, but this recipe is already very complicated and as with anything in life, you get back what you put into something. The work to make this sauce pays off in a delicious red sauce for pizza. I suggest to use a thick layer of this sauce on your pizza and heat any remaining as a bread stick dipping sauce. The sauce is a very deep red in color from the tomato paste and is more mild in my opinion. My kids really liked it over the more spicy/peppery sauces I have made or that are commonly used on pizza. My family was impressed by the outcome of this recipe.

Awesome pizza sauce that took just a couple minutes to make. Another reviewer said this sauce is too sweet and spicy, but i didnt find any of those things to be the case. I didnt have marjoram, so i substituted it with rosemary. I also used sugar instead of honey for convenience. Perfect

Very good sauce and super easy to make. Too much sugar for me so I added only 1tsp honey. Considering using carrot juice in place of honey next time by subbing it for some or all of the h2o.

Since discovering this pizza sauce long ago, I never use anything else, nor do I buy the jar pizza sauce. This recipe is so good and so  easy. 
I find that the flakes are a bit too spicy for me so I just leave them out. Mmmm so good!

Made it for the second time and left out the anchovy paste. My friend did not care for "the fishy taste" the last time. But will not leave it out next time because it had a much fuller taste which I loved!

We loved this.  I gave it 4 stars because we didn't use anchovy paste and I didn't have marjoram, so it wasn't a true taste test. It  was easy and flavourful.

I loved this sauce, but the family found it a bit too sweet. It covered two home made 12" pizzas. At first we thought it wasn't enough, but the sauce spreads a bit and was a good amount for my family, but a little more would have been nice. If you like lots of sauce or want extra for dipping bread, doubling the recipe should work.

Made it with minced anchovies instead of paste. This is a flavorful pizza sauce that works great with homemade pizza dough. If I make dough, then I make sure I have this sauce ready to go.

First time I made this I used half the honey. It tasted too sweet for me so second go I only used about 2 tsp. Definitely adjust the honey to how sweet you like your pizza sauce. This is my go to sauce unless I have homemade on hand.

Just made this for the first time omitting the anchovy paste and everyone loved it.  I did double the recipe for two large pizzas and had enough left over for one more. I will definitely use this recipe again.

Made this without any changes (and using the Anchovy paste).  My husband loved it.  Said maybe just a tad less pepper.  I liked it a lot too but definitely need to cut down on pepper.  He liked the sweetness of it.  I think the honey could be lowered as well. Overall, very good as this is my first time making pizza from scratch.  A little tweaking and it will be a 5.  Used Pizza dough III for crust.  That is wonderful.

This was really good! So much better than the canned stuff. It was a little sweet for my taste, so I think next time I'll use only 1 T of honey. I use sauteed garlic and onions, and I heat the sauce through before spreading on the pizza. I easily got 2 large pizzas out of this recipe with some to spare for dipping. I intend to make one big batch and freeze it in pizza-sized portions. Thanks so much for sharing!

This is a fantastic pizza sauce recipe.  I just used a little less honey than the 2tbsp.  and it was great.  It does have a great little kick to it, but not too spicy that it's intolerable (I don't like things too spicy and it was perfect for my preference).  

It's a keeper in my opinion and so easy to make, and adds great flavor.  Keep any leftovers to dip your pizza crust in!

This was a very good sauce.  I like a slightly sweet sauce but this was a little too sweet.  Maybe cut back some on the honey.

Neither my wife nor i enjoyed this very much. She thought it was too sweet, and gave it one star. i'm a bit more forgiving... i mean, i didn't spit it out or anything ... so we split the difference. Easy to make, but i don't understand why it's rated so highly.

Fantastic recipe. I followed the recipe exactly but used fresh herbs. I had never used anchovy paste and had to ask where to find it at the grocery. As per other reviews, I recommend not leaving out the anchovy paste. Wonderful blend of flavours and very authentic taste. I froze the remaining sauce in ice cube tray, then bagged, for future use. It yielded enough for 4 medium size pizzas.

It was way too sweet as other reviewers have mentioned.  Somewhat surprised the recipe has not been revised either reducing or eliminating the honey since overwhelming sweetness seems to be the recurring issue with this recipe.

Followed this recipe to the letter and we just love it.  I thought the honey would make the sauce too sweet but this was not the case.  My husband is pretty particular/fussy and he was sold.

When it comes to pizza, everyone has their favorite part.   For many, it is all about the cheese but for me, the sauce is most important followed closely by the crust.  I've been uses this recipe for years.  It's is my favorite pizza sauce and there are times I confess to craving it.

Made it exactly as instructed and found it to be Over the Top too sweet and too mild on the spices. There is a MUCH better sauce recipe on Food.com entitled Ultimate Pizza Sauce which is quite excellent

It was good and pretty creamy, but a bit too sweet. If I were to do it again, I would probably cut back to half or 1/4 the honey added to it.

Awesome pizza sauce. It has taken me a few years to write this review, but everyone that has my pizza loves the sauce. I am not a big pizza fan, but I will eat my fair share when I make my own using this sauce. Thanks for a fantastic recipe. This one is a keeper

This is great and I wanted to share a trick someone else told me. Instead of messing with sugar (or honey) to add the required sweetness, add ketchup. It sort of has proportioned sugar, so you never add too much.

I served this sauce on the side of  a cauliflower (rice) pizza crust  that I had cut into small squares. It was a hit as an afternoon snack! Since I wasn't going to top the pizza with the sauce before it went into the oven, I just warmed the sauce over a low heat until the parm was melted into the sauce.
My family loved it!!!

I've tried so many pizza sauces, and this one is truly my all-time favorite.  Just the right combination of seasonings and sweetness.  It reminds me of the sauce we get at our favorite pizza place!  It makes enough to top four pieces of store bought naan.

I liked the tomato sauce.  It was good with the recipe for the pizza.  I liked it better than the tomato sauce at my school ASD.  It was a little spicy because my Dad dropped a little bit of pepper by accident.  I am going to make it again today!  Thank you for designing the tomato sauce.

After finding Jay's Signature Pizza Dough on this site, the only thing I needed to make the perfect pizza was the perfect sauce.  This recipe is it, and it doesn't have to be cooked (big bonus)!  I made it as written and and wouldn't change a thing.  The batch made enough to generously cover two 14 inch pizzas.    "Salt to taste" meant 1/2 tsp to me and that worked well.   I found the balance of sweet, savory and heat to be spot on. Thank you for a great recipe!!!!

I made this last night with no changes. I also made the dough in my bread machine. This sauce is soooooo good.  My husband loved it. I usually don't write reviews but I had too.  I will do as other day and measure out all of the ingredients and store them in a jar.

This is my go-to sauce recipe. I halve the black pepper and add a pinch of baking soda to reduce heartburn. I also add ground fennel, a splash of wine and a splash of olive oil. This gets such rave reviews from our guests!

Used my Vitamix Bullet and it came out great! Next time I will try using low glycemic unrefined Palm Sugar instead of honey to cut down on the carbs.

This sauce is so flavorful, it puts regular sauce to shame. I did only use half the honey and I didn't see the cayenne in the ingredients, so that was left out. I doubled the sauce for two 14 inch pizzas and there was just a bit left. What a superb  sauce! Although next time I may leave out the honey altogether.

The only thing I changed, as a personal preference, was cut the honey in half.  It still had a spice/sweetness to it.  The anchovy paste added a good dimension to it.....definitely need to add that!

Will definitely make this again!  Loved the sauce on my homemade crust.  Only changes were using 1-tsp of honey because so many stated it was too sweet.  I didn't use anchovy paste or marjoram, choosing to increase the oregano to 3/4 tsp.

Family loved it.  Said better than any of the pizza's we order in.  We have now established a Pizza Night at home since they loved this sauce so much!

Kept the recipe pretty much the same - except less honey and it was perfect!

I made this sauce for dipping cheese sticks in. It was perfect. I followed the advice from other reviews and cut the honey in half. We will be making this over and over again.

This sauce is amazing and I will never buy pizza sauce again. I make it as directed, with the exception of adding slightly less anchovy paste because I find that the sauce tastes a little fishy with the full teaspoon. I use it with Jay's signature pizza crust and it's delicious.

This was pretty good. I did omit the anchovy paste and substituted with 1/4tsp Worcestershire sauce and instead of honey I used 1 tsp of sugar. I also omitted the paprika as others have suggested and I didn't have marjoram on hand.

Amazing!!! 
 I didn't have marjoram. Used two trader joes basil cubes instead of dried.  Doubled it. Have been making pizza all week this sauce is so good. Will never go back to packaged. As others suggested, I cut out the honey and added one tbs white sugar.

This is the best pizza sauce I have ever made and it is now my go-to sauce. There are many different kinds of tomato based pizza sauces and this one is sweet. If you don't like sweet, you won't like this. Do not leave out the anchovy paste, it really adds to this recipe.

I'll have to admit, I made this on short notice, and didn't have all the ingredients. Let me tell you, using just the tomato paste, warm water, garlic, basil, onion powder, parmesan & a dash of cayenne pepper, it still turned out great! We'll definitely use this sauce from now on...

I just made it but with a few changes, didn't need to use any salt since the tomato paste I used had plenty already, used thyme instead of oregano, no red pepper flakes, opted to using only 2 teaspoons of honey. 

It was a bit too runny tho, think I should have reduced the amount of water used but  overall it tasted great, can definitely be used as a dip with grilled chicken and meat as well. I look forward to trying it out on a pizza asap.

After my favorite Pizza place closed and no other pizza place could even touch it, I searched recipes. My search for the perfect crust ended with Jay's crust, also in Allrecipes. I needed a sauce now. What a beautiful combination. It's not the same as the pizza place I loved. My family and I think it's better!  The fam prefers this over any  take-out sauces! Fresh garlic is a great touch!

I loved this pizza sauce recipe! It was just a little spicy and had great flavor and was so simple to make. I don't know how much sauce people are putting on their pizzas or in their calzones, but those who suggested it doesn't make enough for a large pizza must be using a ton! I doubled it for two modest sized pizzas and have a bunch left over. Will be working my way through it this weekend!

The store didn't have anchovy paste or marjoram, and I think those would have helped a lot.  The sauce was very easy to prepare, and the taste was excellent.  As other readers have commented, 2 tbsp. honey is a bit much.  I used 1 tsbp. and it was still very sweet.

This is fantastic! Simple, easy, delicious! The first time I made it, I followed it exactly, I had some left over so I popped it in the fridge, it turned almost solid, so I had to thin it out with water. The second time I made it, I doubled the recipe, and I added a bit of olive oil, and water to the consistency I like. Man is this ever a good recipe. I did use anchovy paste as well, I feel like that is the missing thing in other pizza sauce recipes.

This is an amazing pizza sauce!I didn't use anchovy paste,and it turned out totally awesome!It's definitely not needed,and neither is cayenne pepper.Instead of all of the spices like oregano,and basil,I used Italian Seasoning which is easier to shop for than all of those.All I used in this was Tomato Paste,Water,Parmesan cheese,salt,and Italian Seasoning.

This recipe is really good! i used it before and my husband didn't like it because it was too sweet.  I thought it would try it again because i thought it had a good base.  I made this again last night but i omitted the honey from the recipe and added more garlic. Perfecto!

Please, please taste before adding the honey.  This turned out so sweet I couldn't use any of it for pizza.  Had to start over with a new batch.  Didn't add any honey at all and it was perfect.  Save yourself some ingredients and work and taste the sauce as you cook.

Followed recipe almost exact except I had Italian herb spices which consisted of the individual spices mentioned.  I did not add  the cayenne and did add a teaspoon of sugar.
Anyway it was delicious.  I was leery about using the paste instead of tomatoes but the consistency was just right. I also like that you did not have to cook it. 
This will definitely be my go to pizza sauce.

I'll never buy sauce again. I had an already opened can of anchovies, so chopped them up for the sauce. A bit less honey. Didn't have any marjoram. Lord, it was good! A really great sauce. Thanks!

My husband is fresh-off-the-boat Sicilian, and has some very definite opinions about pizza. He caught me squeezing honey into the sauce and nearly lost his mind, but as soon as he tasted the final product, he heartily approved! Only adjustments I made was to use tomato sauce instead of paste, and let the whole things simmer for a while on the stove (helps to cut the acidity of the tomato). Just make it a couple hours ahead and let it cool before using on pizza!

I made this recipe exactly as specified, except that I skipped the marjoram because I didn't have any on hand.  I was very pleased with the ease of preparation (no simmering required) and with the flavor and consistency of the sauce.  I doubled the recipe and it was more than enough to cover both sides of two french bread loaves for french bread pizza.

I love this sauce!  I made it exactly as written (w/o anchovies).  I like the touch of sweetness with the honey and spicy with the cayenne pepper.  I'm going to use this one a lot.  I'm wondering if it would make a good pasta sauce if I add some water or tomato sauce to the remaining (I doubled it).

Love this sweet and spicy recipe. And it's quick and easy. If you don't like spice cut down on the red pepper flakes and the cayenne. My kids thinks it's too spicy but I love it.

This is a REALLY good sauce, took the advice of others and cut honey and cayenne in half, I did not have anchovie paste but will definitely try next time!! Also stuck mine in the blender for a minute to mix all the flavors together :)

Yum, very tasty!  I omitted the anchovy paste but thought the flavor was really good. Not too sweet or spicy at all, just good-tasting pizza sauce!  It was enough for our pizza dough plus I had some leftover that I froze for next time.

I've made this several times, so good! I mistakenly doubled the cayenne the last  time and really liked it!

Best pizza sauce ever! Whole fam loves it.
I've started subbing out one 15 oz can of tomato sauce, instead of using the paste and water. It works just as good, and for me is a little easier. :)

The tomato paste and water is a great base starting point but this tastes like sloppy Joe sauce if the entire recipe is followed as written. Too sweet.

Please for the sake of the recipe and pizza sauces all over the world do not leave out ingredients. Anchovy paste counters the sweet honey. The two work perfectly together. I have made this a lot and it turns out perfect every time. Making it now and for the first time ever I used fresh garlic and onion instead of jarred spices. AMAZING! Just mince it up as fine as you can if you don't want onion and garlic chunks. I wish i could give it 10 stars! Or 20.

I had some friends over and made mini pizzas with various toppings and made this sauce. It was a hit!!! Everyone loved it!  My personal tastebuds would like to try it by doubling up on the herbs next time to have added flavor yet it is perfect the way it is.

I made a double batch and followed the recipe omitting the anchovy paste and using 2 tablespoons of honey instead of 4. I found that this sauce was perfect for my tastes, a little sweet and just the right amount of heat. I have found my perfect pizza sauce!!

I made this last night after reading the reviews.
I chopped some onion very fine and garlic.
Sautéed them in a small pot. Added all spices ( cut out Anchovies). Then tomato paste and water.
Used fresh basil instead of dry at this point.
I did only use a tiny bit of cayenne.
Didn't use honey , but half a teaspoon of brown sugar instead.
Brought sauce to a small boil and turned off heat.
Added parmasan.
What an amazing pizza sauce. Just thinking about it wants me to dip into my leftover.
Does make enough for 2 12" pizzas. ( must be the added real onion that helps make more sauce).
Next time I'll try adding half red wine and half water for an even more robust flavour.
But is totally delicious as I made it.
Now I'll need to buy a whole case of tomotoe paste because  I'll never buy pizza sauce ever again !

I make this sauce frequently. If I'm out of any of the spices, it's still delicious! I don't use the anchovy paste or the red pepper flakes. I find that it makes enough sauce for several pizzas, so I freeze the excess in an ice cube tray, store them in a freezer bag, and thaw as needed.

Tip - to avoid a soggy crust, oil the dough before spreading the sauce on.

I cut the Parmesan back to 2 tablespoons (my cheese blend has parm, so I didn't want to overload). No Anchovy (bleck). Substituted another portion of Oregano for Majoram (I was out of Majoram. - Also, full serving, not half like they tell you to use when you do this substitution. I like flavor!) No Cayenne Pepper at all; because Red Pepper flakes can bring more than enough heat. Results: It passed the first test; I didn't go blind. It does have a sweet, then tangy flavor. I will make this my base from now on. And start experimenting with different amounts, and types of spices.

5 star reviews are not my thing.  However, if I were going to give one, it'd be for this recipe!  
I've actually made this three times now, over the last month or so.   
The first two times I made it exactly to the recipe.  I got confident today and wanted to mod it.  I used garlic powder instead of minced and added a squirt of BBQ sauce.  This is awesome!  I thought it was going to be "meh" at first, because it didn't involve actual cooking of the sauce.  Nope!  It has been delicious.  There's a little bit of spice in it, but, barley noticeable.  I think it sat for an hour today also, instead of the 30 minutes it said to let it sit.  Make this and love it!  Oh yeah also, it works great as a dipping sauce for your pizza.  AND it makes enough for two pizzas about 14-16".  Make it!  You won't regret it!

Edit:  I didn't use anchovy paste any of the times I made it.  That's just gross!

Excellent! I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. The sweet and spicy and savory all balance each other out so I wouldn't skip any of the ingredients.

I had to make pizza for a crowd and decided to try this recipe.  I tripled it and skipped the anchovy paste since I couldn't find it at the store.  I made it a couple of days in advance and I  put it on the stovetop and simmered it for a couple of hours.  We loved it!  I'll definitely be using this sauce in the future.  I probably will cut back on the sweetener since it was a tad too sweet for us.

The sauce was easy to put together and was pretty decent.  I do agree with most others that it was too sweet from the honey.  Next time I may omit it and see how it comes out.  For that I need to knock off 1 star.

Tastes like Chicho's spicy sauce! (Virginia Beach local chain)
I added a minced cherry pepper for fun. Lol

I scaled to 9 servings as my can of tomato paste was 13 oz. I omitted the salt, reduce water to 1/2 cup and used 1 tbsp honey. Good recipe overall, made from ingredients you have on hand, can be easily altered to suit your personal tastes. Froze leftovers for future pizzas, make in the morning to allow flavours to develop.

This sauce was delicious. I doubled the recipe and used Italian seasoning in place of the dried herbs (due to not having marjoram in the spice cabinet). Opted for 2 Tb of honey and no cayenne. The flavor was sweet but totally balanced. I can't imagine anyone not liking this sauce unless they just don't like red sauces. I do feel that starting with a quality tomato paste likely makes a big difference. I used the Kirkland brand organic paste. This is now my go-to red sauce!!

I took out the anchovie paste and the honey because i was scared of the honey making it too sweet. With some reviews , i saw that the anchovie paste was balancing the sweetness of the honey so i decided to take those two out and it was wonderful!!!! Also , the second time i made it with a tomato paste who already had garlic and basil and it was also good!!!!!!!!!

This sauce is making me a connoisseur of pizza.  The only changes I made were adding a touch of wine, more garlic....I add more garlic to everything... and I sprinkled sea salt and oregano on top before putting in the oven. Yum, yum.

This came together so quickly and liked that there was no need to simmer, just make ahead. I didn't have anchovy paste so skipped it and I cut back on the honey and added it to my taste. We are heat wimps so I skipped the cayenne. Very good pizza sauce!

Best pizza sauce ever. We add wine in place of the water, but it is absolutely amazing. We also double the tomato paste, and cut the honey down a tad. Spectacular.

I was hoping the reviewers were right on this one, but alas I can not agree. My family ate it with no fan fare, but I could not. No one ate seconds. It was a chore to eat this sauce.

Easy sauce but too sweet When made as the recipe minus the red pepper. Next time try it without the honey and only add the honey as needed....don't use what the recipe states. Also add a pinch of baking soda to help control heartburn.

Made it exactly as written - including the anchovy paste. It was good, but not great. A little too spicy for me. And the flavor was just kind of missing something.

This sauce was pretty good.  The herbs smelled fantastic! A little too sweet for my taste though, but that is easily fixed. :) As a side note,  this sauce will be a lot  thinner than the stuff  you'd find in a can.

I had no idea how much better a pizza I could make until I made this sauce!  I made it exactly as written and can honestly say it beats any sauce I've ever had.  It's definitely worth adding the anchovies, too, even if you think anchovies are gross (you won't taste them). With the honey, you need to add the anchovies for the umami part of the flavor profile. Outstanding!!!

Great sauce! I didn't use the anchovy paste because I didn't have it on hand. It was still wonderful without it. Thank you for a great recipe! I did double the recipe as suggested by other reviewers.

We really enjoy this recipe. Quick, easy and tasty. We prefer a sauce with a bit of a kick. I love the subtle flavor that the anchovy paste imparts. We usually double this to have some on hand. As with any recipe, we adjust the spicy or sweet profiles to suit our personal tastes but we generally follow the recipe, so I'm rating the actual recipe and not a version that failed because I changed it. :-)

Delicious! I've tried numerous recipes, usually they taste like bland marinara sauce in the background of the pizza...not this recipe! It actually added something to the pizza and was noticeably tasty!

Ok, so I did double it, but also made a change for the sake of texture.  Instead of tomato paste and water, I added a 14.5 oz can of roasted, diced tomatoes.  Then combined all ingredients and simmered over a medium flame for 10 min to further break down the diced tomatoes (probably should have used crushed tomatoes, but diced it what I had).  This method also further releases the flavor potential of all dry ingredients.

This was very good pizza sauce. I made it as the recipe states, making a double batch. There was so much that I froze the left overs and will use it again when I make pizza again.

The sauce is too sweet for me.  I reduced the honey to 1 T and will likely eliminate it next time.  I also used a full tsp of basil and additional garlic salt.

Fabulous sauce. I did not have marjoram. I used sugar in place of the honey. I put mine on the stove on low just because I felt like it. It reminded me of Pizza Hut sauce but way better.  my favorite sauce yet.

Very good but I omitted the anchovies and put just one good teaspoon of honey.

I also just put all of the ingredients in a small pot and let it simmer over low heat for five minutes.  Easier, I think :)

Thanks for the recipe.  Much better than store bought and cheaper as well!

I have been using this recipe for two years.  It is fantastic.  My only suggestions is to double it...  you will be glad that you did.  Also, I don't think the anchovy paste should be optional...

LOVE this site and can never go wrong with such a well reviewed and well rated recipe.  First review!! OMG, this is so frigging delicious!  Made it for our home made pizza tonight, and we are loving this - used it as the base of our "za", and we are loving it as a topping as we eat.  I didn't have anchovy paste, so I left that out, as well as the red pepper flakes and marjoram.  I didn't have any onion powder, so I finely grated about a tablespoon of fresh onion, including the juices from the grating.  Also added 3 garlic cloves.  Perfection.

I like the flavor and the simplicity.  Does not overpower any flavors on the pizza.  I add some fennel and a bit extra red pepper flakes..  Have made this a lot.  Keep coming back to it .  Do a scratch pizza regularly so am a bit fussy and this works really well.

This is a wonderful pizza sauce! I didn't change a thing. (Don't skip the anchovy paste; it adds a lot of complexity.)  I did use freshly grated Parmesan and let the sauce sit overnight in the fridge. I'll make this again and again!

This pizza sauce is phenomenal - the only sauce we use for our weekly Friday night pizzas!  I've been making it for years now, and I don't add the anchovy paste (didn't like the flavor as much with it) or honey (too sweet with it; we prefer our sauce more on the savory side).  I typically add about 1 tsp. of salt to the batch, which is usually perfect.  Whenever I do make this, I try to double the recipe - that way I can portion it out into individual containers and freeze the rest for future pizzas (a double recipe makes 4 pizzas for us).  YUM.  So easy and so good!

An interesting sauce. We made a couple pizzas with it and couldn't finish them.  I froze the rest of the sauce so it wouldn't go to waste, but I'm not sure what to repurpose it for.

This is FABULOUS. I make it in bulk and freeze it. I put enough for one pizza in each sandwich bag, and then dump them all into a freezer bag. Makes pizza quick and easy.

I found this recipe to be way too sweet and too spicy at the same time. I also thought that it was more like a paste less like a sauce.

Easy and good!  The only criticism is its too sweet. I cut it back to 1T honey and it's just right. Yummy and one to make in batches to freeze ahead. Thanks for a good recipe!

This is great. I make it at least once a week! It's been a challenge to switch my mother to healthier, homemade foods, and pizza was one of her holdouts. But she likes this sauce more than the one from the pizzeria! She even requests it on pasta. I love that I have all the ingredients, all the time. I start with half the amount of honey and adjust to taste, depending on the brand of canned tomato paste I'm using.

Our go-to pizza sauce. I omit the anchovy paste because I taste the fish flavor. My 9 year old loves to make this.

Perfect and easy. Please listen to the reviewer who said not to omit the anchovy paste, honey, or cayenne - you really do need them all for balance. The only change I made was to sub in as bit of sage and thyme for morjoram (I didn't have any marjoram on hand).

Excellent recipe, made this as written (including the anchovy paste).  It was too sweet for our taste, will reduce or eliminate the honey, next time.  This recipe is simple and easily adaptable to your taste.

like many others have said, reduce the honey.  I only used 1 tablespoon and it was still pretty sweet when I tasted the sauce by itself.  but when cooked on the pizza, it tasted less sweet.  I doubled the oregano.  I had a hard time incorporating the parmesan even though I blended the parm first to get it really fine.  The sauce by itself was gross with the raw garlic, but cooked on the pizza the raw garlic flavor was gone.  I might add a bit more sweet and a touch of cayenne next time.  Always a good idea to use corn flour to dust the dough ball.  There's no need to worry about a soggy pizza by adding too much sauce.  This sauce is not thin.  I liked this sauce and I will make it again.

The anchovy really helped bring out a savoriness.

Super easy and very tasty. I used this to make a pan pizza on my BBQ. Wood smoke, cast iron, pizza and beer. Feel a Tim The Toolman grunt coming on! Loved this recipe. Thanks for sharing.

Wow - so simple and delicious!  I let me 4 & 6 year old put all the ingredients in themselves and they were so proud of what the made! We used fresh basil from our garden, but other than that followed the recipe to a T - will use in the future, way better than the store bought stuff and really cost next to nothing as I had everything in my pantry already.

Love this sauce!  It has a little kick which is a nice change to traditional pizza.  Instead of using tomato paste and the water, I use the large can of tomato sauce.

I made it exactly like the recipe called for the first time, minus the optional anchovy paste. Halving the honey makes it 5 stars for me.

I tastes super good and it's nice and thick.  I have never made pizza sauce like this.  I usually use tomato sauce, paste, spices and cook to reduce and it's still on the thin side.  I doubled the recipe, but did  not double the honey.  I did not want it too sweet.  I added 1/4 teaspoon of ground fennel.  But otherwise it tastes good.  It is sitting on my counter just ready to spread on my pizza dough.  Between my husband and me, "two thumbs up".

Perfect, if you cut the honey in half.  I have made this a few times and felt that it was way too sweet.  I reduced the honey to 1 TBSP and it was perfect.  I also omit the anchovy paste.  This is my new go-to pizza sauce recipe!

I love this recipe and so does everyone who I've cooked it for. This has been my favorite for a number of years now. I've served it at a couple of functions at our church with rave reviews. the youth of our church had a treasure hunt and the clue for my house was "where do you get the best pizza in town?"

This is the absolute tastiest and easiest pizza sauce ever!  Made it twice now.  The second time I cut the honey back to half.  Way better!  I love a bit of sweetness in my food so I have no problem with the honey.Spices are perfect and for you folks that cut back the honey, well you better cut back the hot pepper and cayenne too because without the honey, it will be hot!. Lovely recipe and definitely a keeper!

A bit too sweet and the dried herbs were overpowering.  Maybe cooking it would mellow the herbs a bit?  I'm glad I tried it, but I will look around for other recipes to try next time.

My family really enjoys this recipe - it's a keeper!

We do, however, like to add a little bit more cayenne and red pepper flakes.  But, that is for our own personal taste.  The recipe is very good!

Great sauce.  I use it every time.  Kids felt it was too sweet and a bit to hot.  So, I just cut the honey in half and omitted one of the peppers.   Anchovy paste is the best secret ingredient.

This is crazy delicious! I did not add the anchovies and I think it was a bit too sweet. I will decrease the honey next time. Still wonderfully delicious and not at all difficult to make.

The taste is far too tomato pastey for me and seems a little like every 'italian' spice in the drawer was thrown in.

Luckily my husband and I both tasted this before I put it on my pizza.  The honey did not balance well with the other ingredients and created a funky after taste.  When I tried to modify the recipe it made the flavor worse.

I almost didn't have pizza because I had to fight the urge to just eat the bowl of it with a spoon. I will most certainly be making this one many many times.

Happy Mistake: I dragged out all the ingredients to make pizza and realized I had no jarred pizza sauce. I jumped on this site and found this recipe. I wanted to double the sauce due to some reviews saying it didn't make much (when in reality I generously sauced two halves of a Pepperidge Farm garlic bread and still had half a canning jar remaining). Anyway -- the happy mistake part comes in where I was distracted by my little ones while making this sauce and I doubled the paste but not the other ingredients (which I didn't realize until the pizza was in the oven). What I did do was sauté the garlic in a sauce pan before adding the sauce and cooking for 5-10 minutes because I didn't have 30 minutes to let it sit per the instructions. I think by cooking it and toasting the garlic, it made the flavors much stronger (as one other reviewer noted). It came out beautifully even with half of everything. Saves money & time this way and has less honey so it's not so sweet (good for the blood sugar). I'll make this again &try it doubling everything but I think this way works just fine. Great EASY recipe.  Thanks so much.

yum yum yum yum yum! I slightly reduced the amount of crushed red pepper, otherwise true to the recipe. Used for a large get together where we made homemade pizza - our friends couldn't stop raving about the sauce!

Husband loved it first time I made it, but I did not have the marjoram. I thought it was too sweet. Second time I made it with half the honey plus the marjoram and didn't like ti as much. Next I will try it with 3/4 honey and no marjoram.

I made it according to directions and it was too sweet. I made another batch using no sweetener at all and this was perfect for us! It has even replaced our marina sauce!

Love this sauce. I put a tad less cayenne and pepper flakes as my hubby thinks its a bit overkill and I leave off the Anchovy paste as I don't have any handy. I let it rest for at least an hour so all the ingredients marry. Delish!

It was a great sauce, however, I did tweak because I am studying abroad and spices are really expensive and hard to find, with no parmesan, just tomato sauce (not paste and water, no cayenne, and no onion powder as it can't be found where I am staying it was still really good.

Angie, thanks for posting this.  We loved it!  I took other reviewers suggestions and cut the honey; I used 1 tablespoon of clover honey for 2 recipes.  I also simmered the sauce and added the cheese after the sauce cooled for 15 minutes.  I used 1 teaspoon of Kosher salt and ground all dry ingredients in a spice grinder so the salt and pepper flakes had a fine consistency; this also insures the spices are completely blended.  I didn't use anchovy paste but opted for Worcestershire Sauce.  Next time, I may cut back on the cheese a bit.  We smoked our pizzas on the Big Green Egg on a stone at 500-600 degrees. This was the best Pizza night yet!  Thanks again for sharing this recipe.

My husband loves this sauce.  I did not use honey because I am not a fan of sweet sauces.  I did not use cayenne powder but I did use the pepper flakes, I did not want to make it too spicy for the kids. And I did not use anchovies.  I only took out those three things and left the rest of it the same and it was great.  Extremely easy to whip together and could definitely make ahead of time and refrigerate.

Just finished eating the pie. The sauce was awesome. Both my husband and I thought it was too sweet though. We love spicy so I don't think cutting back on the honey will make it too spicy (as one reviewer mentioned). Will definitely make again. ?

This was FABULOUS! It was a little on the sweet side, which I liked, but if that's not up your alley then I'd half the honey. I did cook this on a stovetop for maybe 20-30 minutes just below a simmer to help meld the flavors a little bit. Absolutely loved this!!!

I used about half the honey and did not include the anchovy paste.  My husband and I thought it was very tasty.  I will probably use a bit less cayenne or red pepper flakes next time, though, since the flavor overpowered our toppings.  Nice recipe!

YUM. I made a Hawaiian pizza and used this sauce-perfect for it!! I will definitely use it over and over! I didn't find it too sweet or too spicy and I normally don't do spicy. Didn't have anchovy paste..next time I will try it and see if it's even better!! Give it a try!

This is a great pizza sauce recipe and very versatile.  I've made it on two different occasions, following the recipe nearly as is.  I added in a little white wine the first time and then the other time a little red wine (for kicks and giggles) based off another reviewer.  Great recipe!

Loved the sauce!!! I was afraid to try with a lot of people saying it was to sweet but I think they are wrong. You can't omit the anchovy paste that's what makes it balance out the sweetness. And don't worry it doesn't tast fishy with the paste it makes it exquisite. Thank You

This is my staple weekly pizza sauce recipe. The only changes I made were to add an equal amount of Italian seasoning (1/4) teaspoon and scale back the honey by a 1/4 teaspoon. The Thyme and sage as well as the extra bit of Oregano and Basil reduce the sweetness and give it more of a bold flavor.

I made the recipe exactly as listed.  I was out of dried oregano, so used 3 times as much fresh, chopped fine (my usual fresh/dried conversion).  I believe I would be disowned by my hubby and 4 kids should I EVER suggest frozen again...and I buy gourmet frozen, not the cheap stuff.  Sauce is wonderfully delish.  Thank you so much to the poster!!

Simply amazing. At first I thought it would be too sweet because I didn't add the anchovy paste, but after I cooked the pizza it tasted incredible. I will try the paste next time but I already rate this 5 stars. A+!

Admittedly this is my first attempt at making a good sauce. Usually I go with Italian seasoning, garlic, and tomato sauce. However, THIS is perfect and a thousand times better. I added slightly more Cayenne.. that and mixing in a food processor were my only changes. Absolutely delicious!!!! I've been using this site for years and this is also my fist review on here. I had to share.

As DBF is vegetarian, I followed Average Jane's suggestion and used (vegetarian) Worcestershire sauce in place of the anchovy paste.  Because of this substitution, I will reduce the honey next time, as it was too sweet with the full amount (but I blame my anchovy mod).  Adding salt "to taste" meant a goodly amount over the top of the bowl.

12.18.13 - Made it again with only one Tbs of honey, two tsp of vegetarian Worcestershire sauce, and very generous salt over the top.  This is great and may be the way I make it from now on.

IMO, you are compensating with the expanse of ingredients for the fact that you are using tomato paste instead of real tomatoes.  Use real tomatoes, you won't need to worry about sugar or honey.

This is a simple, delicious pizza sauce.  It makes enough for one large pizza or 2 med pizzas.  I like that the ingredients are usually always in my pantry so I can make pizza whenever I want.

We thought this was very good. I usually use canned or bottled but I was out. I had all the ingredients on hand. I added garlic and used agave. Not sure I would call it 'exquisite'.

Made it last night. I used what we have in the pantry. Thyme instead of marjoram (great substitute). Added 1 tsp of classico basil pesto sauce & spread, and 1 tsp of mrs. dash original. I would suggest using 1 tbsp of honey.. taste and add more if needed. 

1 or 2 topping pizza bake @ 500 for 10 min.
Once pizza is baked drizzle basil pesto spread, sprinkle parmesan cheese & ENJOY!!!

I made this sauce and it was too watery. Fortunately, I improved the situation by stewing meatballs in this sauce and it became thick. I covered pizza with a little bit of ketchup, this thickened sauce with meatballs, pickles, dried tomatoes in oil and cheese. Mmm, the best pizza I've tried!

When I looked at the ingredients for the store bought pizza sauce I was shocked.  After trying this recipe I will never buy pizza sauce again.  I followed the recipe as instructed, only omitted the marjoram because I didn't have any... Yummy... This will be a family favorite.  Thanks

This sauce is sooo good. I never made any kind of sauce before and actually surprised myself not to mention my husband. Delicious and simple what else could you ask for. My only suggestion would be is add the ingredients a little at a time. You can always add more but when it's in, it's in.

This recipe has a spicy hot kick which I am not use to in a pizza sauce.  It was also very sweet almost too sweet.  I  will definitely cut back on the honey next time.  I will also cut back on the Parmesan because it overpowered the recipe and gave it a texture I did not enjoy.  Overall it was tasted pretty good but the kids did not like it so this is not the sauce for us.

Followed this to a T with the exception of using marjoram (didn't have any). This was WAY too "tomatoey" tasting and bitter. I had to doctor this up big time.

I'm rating this a 5 star because it was a good recipe base to go with as long as I could tweak it. I'd read many people say it was WAAAY too sweet and WAAAY too spicy. I made it and it was ABSOLUTELY exquisite, however I changed the recipe to my liking. And because I didn't actually make this recipe to a T, I can't quite rate it. But I can rate what I made and it was super yummy! Here's how I made it:

1 6oz can tomato paste,
1 empty 6oz can tomato paste filled with water,
2 Tbs parmesan cheese,
1/2 tsp onion powder,
1/2 tsp onion flakes,
1/2 tsp oregano,
1/4 tsp basil,
1/2 tsp pepper.

And omg! It was amazing!! Hope it's more to your liking than the recipe above!

Just the right amount of richness, perfect sweet to bitter ratio.

This sauce is horrible! The honey makes it so sweet that you can't taste any of the other ingredients. We won't ever be trying this one again!

Excellent recipe! I used a little less honey and I increased the garlic because I know what my taste buds like, and I didn't dried basil or marjoram, so I subbed Italian seasoning. I'm realize I'm giving this five stars based on my modifications....but I figure readers know what their taste buds like, so what's the harm?  My view is this sauce can have numerous modifications and turn out beautifully. Don't leave out the anchovy paste would be my only strong caution - it doesn't make the sauce "fishy" or weird - it makes it savory. It is the secret ingredient as far as I am concerned. Took the advice of another reviewer to multiply the dry ingredients by eight; very helpful.

Made it exactly as written except I doubled it to put the leftovers in the freezer for another time. This was easy, considerably cheaper than jarred sauce if you have all of the spices, and delicious. You can't get much better than that.

I keep coming back to THIS recipe... excellent.  Even if you tweak it here and there, it still turns out wonderfully.  I do tweak, I use 1/2 white wine and 1/2 water instead of all water and skip the anchovy paste. If I want that flavor, I just stack them on my pizza.  If I have them, I use fresh herbs from my garden too. YUM!

I accidentally omitted the honey when I made this (I forgot to put it in), and it was still delicious. I didn't realize anything was missing! I am not a fan of spicy foods, so I used the red pepper flakes only.  It was delicious and I can't wait to try it again. I might have to have pizza two nights in a row!

Delicious! I omitted the anchovy paste but included everything else. I don't like anything spicy and in reading the reviews felt comfortable trusting fellow reviews' comments that the honey will help cancel the red pepper flakes and cayenne pepper, and it did. Sauce was a nice sweet flavor. I would say the this receipe yielded enough for 3 home-made pies (as other's recommended I didn't used a lot).

Really love this sauce and I don't normally like spicy things. My whole family loves when I make homemade pizza with this and Jay's Signature Pizza Crust (from this website). I used petite diced tomatoes canned with basil, oregano, and garlic in place of those spices and the tomato paste/water. Mashed up the canned tomatoes with a hand mixer, then followed the recipe as is. I've made it with and without the anchovy paste, can't really tell a difference.

This is a lovely and easy to make sauce which I rely on.  As written, it is extremely sweet; I use about a tsp of sugar instead.  I don't use the anchovy paste, just because I don't have it on hand, so I don't know what effect that would have.

My husband, who has a deep loathing for any tomato based sauces, absolutely loved this, as did I.  I used more cayenne and red pepper flakes than it called for and omitted the honey but it is easily our favourite sauce, so much so that he has asked me to make a large batch so we can use it more often~

Exquisite does not do this sauce justice!  It is the BEST pizza sauce I have ever made.  The only change I made was to cut back on the honey a little and also added more garlic.  :-) AMAZING...thank you for sharing!!

Very good, truely no comparison to canned sauce and so easy I can't believe I waited so long to make this. I followed some other reviews and made a big batch of the seasonings and then just a single batch of the sauce. I tried it after 1 TBSP of honey and decided to stick with that. I'm really looking forward to using this as my base for pasta sauce.

Ok, I read approx. 500 reviews before deciding to try this one.  The ONLY change I made was to 1/2 the honey...everything else was as written, even used the anchovy paste and the marjoram...went out and bought them specifically for this recipe.  And I used both the red pepper flakes and the cayenne.  All in all, it was just ok, nothing spectacular, family thought it was ok, but didn't ask for seconds or rave about it.  It did have a bit of a kick/spicy flavor to it and no, it was not fishy tasting from the anchovy paste at all.  We probably will not make it again because no one was overly thrilled by it.  Still searching...

Wow! I mean WOW! This pizza sauce is fantastic. Admittedly, I didn't use the anchovy paste (one of my guests has a seafood allergy so I left it out - I am sure the sauce is even better with the anchovy paste). Thanks for sharing Angie!

I made this for the first time tonight.  It was very flavorful.  The whole family loved it.  Very easy to prepare.  Made exacatly as recipe specified.  Next time I will cut honey to 1TB, 2 TB of honey only gave a slightly sweet flavor, but I prefer less sweetness, great blend of flavors. Will be making again!

This sauce is SO good.  Only used half the honey because of other reviews, not sure what the difference would have been.  It smelled so fantastic as it set aside for the 30 minutes I wanted to eat it with a spoon. I will use this recipe from now on.  Fantastic!!

A delicious pizza sauce. After I learned this one, I got rid of my other sauce that needs to be cooked. Try it, you won't be disappointed. Especially love the chili and honey combination.

My family loved this recipie, I perfer to follow a recipie the first time I make something but had to use what I had on hand. I used a 28oz can of tomato sauce and just doubled all the other indgredients and omitted the anchovy paste all together. This is a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

This is the only sauce I use now, and we have pizza alot! I use tomato sauce instead of the paste and water, and heat it a little to help all the flavors come together.

Fantastic flavor!  The anchovy paste is a must in my opinion.  It is also good to have around for homemade Caesar dressing.  I use half the honey because I like the acidic bite of tomatoes.  When I have toppings, I substitute paprika for the cayenne pepper and just use a dash of red pepper flakes.  Otherwise with just cheese, I love the spiciness.

Excellent pizza sauce - I made it for stromboli and everyone loved it!  I didn't have any parmesan cheese so I made it without and it was still fabulous.  I'm not a fan of hot sauces but the red pepper flakes really added a lot to the recipe without making it too hot. I also did not use the anchovy paste. Will definitely use this as my favorite recipe.

Very good with Valentino's Pizza Crust from this site also. I omitted the honey and everything spicy plus the anchovy paste(yuck!). The sauce still tasted authentic.

This recipe was very good but a little sweet. It might have been my fault because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand so I had to improvise a lil ;0 But all the elements were there that I look for, it had a lot of zing, full bodied and the cheese and honey lent some creaminess. I had enough for two large pies (around 16" I think)
Can't wait to try this recipe again and plan on shopping for it specifically

This was a good recipe for pizza sauce.

The changes I made were:
- increasing the water to 8 oz (we like it not so thick), 
- increasing the pepper flakes to 1/4 tsp (the pepper flakes gave it the right amount of bite without coating the lips),
- decreasing the honey to 1 Tbsp (just enough to take the acidity out),
- left out the anchovy paste, marjoram, and cayenne (I didn't have the first 2).

At first I thought the cheese amount was a little much but after it melded it added a very nice enhancement to the flavor.

I made this sauce this evening, and ended up using a large clove of garlic, minced, and agave syrup but decreased the amount to only one TBS, and added one anchovy fillet, mashed.  My husband thought the sauce was great! Very easy, thick and flavorful with a little kick of heat to spice up left-over turkey! This one's a keeper, for sure!

A pretty decent sauce all in all.  I would use it again.  It is a tad sweet.  I liked the mild spice, the garlic and the cheese.  I did not opt for the anchovy paste but I would have (if I had it on hand--I buy filets).  I will be using this until something comes along that is equally as good.  To be fair the crust we used (homemade) was also VERY sweet so it did not make matters better.

This recipe was great. I didn't have all the dry ingredients so i sub them for fresh ones. First I doubled the recipe. Then I added 3 cloves of garlic minced, minced onion, fresh basil and etc... I proceeded by bring the sauce to a boil and let it simmer for 15 minutes with a lid on top. Without the lid it will bubble splatter out. Used this sauce to to along with Alton Browns pizza dough. Hands down it was a great meal. I double the recipe and did not double the amount of Honey.

It was exquisite! The taste was so flavorful and diverse...the honey and anchovy paste added subtle, but noticible richness. My family has loved it. And it is SO easy. thank you Angie. I skip the marjoram, and only use a few twists of one kind of pepper. I also used refrigerated crushed garlic which is easier and adds some punch. yum.

One of my favourite pizza sauces to make when I feel like "that stuff in a can/bottle" just won't do the trick. This recipie scales up easily as well and keeps in the freezer for quite some time.

I didn't have the anchovy paste, tomato paste, or Parmesan cheese. I did, however, have a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce and a six-cheese blend, instead. I did not use water in this recipe because I used tomato sauce. My family and I love this sauce, therefore, we will no longer use pizza sauce from the store. This is my go-to pizza sauce now.

I'm really rating this recipe 3.5 stars. I was a bit skeptical in adding the parmesan cheese to the sauce, so I waited till the end before mixing it in. I tasted the sauce before I adding the cheese and thought that it tasted phenomenal, but against my better judgement, I added the cheese anyway - and regreted it afterwards. The cheese took away/masked the flavours of the rest of the seasonings. I also thought it tasted too sweet after I baked it on the pizza. My family has been in the pizza business for 20+ years, and they have always made their own pizza sauce. This is similiar with the exception of the Parmesan, honey and anchovy paste. Final verdict: I would make this sauce for dipping bread sticks and pizza crusts (omitting the cheese, of course, and leaving the honey in), but leave out the honey when making the pizza, so it doesn't taste too sweet. PS: I also left out the hot pepper flakes to make it kid friendly. The cayenne pepper gave the sauce the right amount of heat that my kids would like.

This was amazing. However too spicy for my little ones. I will just remove the cayenne and pepper flakes for them next time. Also I omitted the anchovy and halved the honey. I only has tomato sauce and it worked.

My husband and I love this however we made the following changes.  I didn't have any tomato paste and was in a pinch so I used one small can of tomato sauce, omitted the water, anchovy paste marjoram and cayenne pepper since I didn't have those.  But it turned out amazing and it was super simple.  Now we regularly have a homemade pizza night!

Easy, yummy! Can't get much better. I skipped the anchovy paste, too and I don't think I missed much.

This was really good, so much flavor! I doubled this recipe. I made a few changes, split the water in half and used red wine for the other half. I didnt have red pepper flakes so I used siracha, and I only used 1/4 of the honey. I also added some rosemary. It did have a bite to it, but I am a big fan of spicy sauce!

I thought the sauce over-powered the pizza.  It was too spicy and sweet.  I would not reccommend.

Needs a touch of salt and ready to go. Earlier I increased the recipe for dry ingredients and assembled them. Now I just use a T for each single use.

Best pizza sauce I have ever had!!  Doubled recipe for 2 pizzas, had enough for 2 more pizzas.  I only used 3 TBSP of honey as many reviewers said it was too sweet.  I used garlic powder instead of minced garlic. I will never buy premade sauce AGAIN!!!! Thanks for sharing!!

I make this every Friday night for our family pizza night. My kids think it's too spicy, so I leave some of the red pepper out for them, but I think it's great either way. It can easily be adjusted to fit personal preferences, but do try it as written the first time. I've tried many other sauce recipes and this is the one I've used for the last year or so.

This Sauce is great!  After trying it following the recipe, I have added some red wine in place of the water, decreased the honey and used actual anchovies (my store did not have the paste).  Highly can recommend this sauce (with or without the modifications).

amazing sauce. it is sweet and a little spicy, the reviewers who dinged it for this should of noticed the honey, cayenne and red pepper flakes....the honey makes the crust taste great,people thought it was the crust but it was the sauce.

My family is in LOVE with the sauce! I make it as is and I also cut the honey,  dried red pepper flakes, and cayenne pepper in half if I'm wanting a pizza a little less sweet. Great recommendations from some of the reviewers. YumE!

I taught myself how to make pizza over 10 years ago, but I've never been able to get the tomato sauce just right until I came across this recipe.  This sauce is great as is or can be used as a sauce base where the sky is the limit to what you can add to it.  5 stars all the way.

Tomato based sauces provide maximum natural flavor when least cooked. Essences disipate during cooking, especially when tomatoes are concentreated into paste, casusing a perminant loss of the natural flavor. consider using the tomatoes in their most natural state, ground, diced, light puree, etc. Mix the tomato, spices, and cook only enough to being out the flavor, and comingle them. Dry soices take longer to release flavor than fresh. A bit of carrot puree, and a pinch of salt adds sweetness, as does onion. Saute the galic briefly to infuse the garlic flavor throughout the olive oil, if you use fresh onion, put those in the oil until they turn translucet, then add the garlic. The oregano, parmisan, and basel (fresh preferred). You will be surprised at the fresh flavor. The pizza dough is the skeleton, the mozzt is the skin, and the sauce is the bolld. Chow (excuse my spelling, please)

this is definately a kid-friendly sauce.  We love spice, so we added more pepper flakes and the contrast between sweet and spicy was perfect.  We make this in large batches and freeze it in mason jarss.  reheat in microwave for a quick sauce for pizza or calzones or stromboli dipping sauce!  Thanks for the recipe.

Super easy, and so flavorful!  It was just a tad sweeter than I'd like after it was baked up, and that's probably because I eliminated the anchovy paste.  This one was a keeper.

This is a good sauce that is super easy to make.  I cut down the heat because my husband doesn’t like anything spicy.  AlsoI will cut the honey by half because it was a little too sweet for us.  But even still, without the adjustment in this first time preparation, we thought it was very good.

I love, love, love how fast and simple it is to make pizza sauce! The first time I made it, I followed the recipe to a '"t". It was really good, but I was looking for a particular taste, so I eliminated the parmesian cheese, and it was perfect!! Exactly what I was looking for! I use it with the basic pizza crust recipe on this site, and I top the pizza with sausage, pepperoni, olives, and sautee'd mushrooms, onions, and peppers! It's one of the best pizzas that I've had! Thanks Angie!

I was very excited to try this recipe with all of the positive reviews it got.  To me, this sauce tastes like what's on frozen pizzas. I followed the recipe exactly (minus the anchovy paste). It was ok - but I wont be making it again.

wonderful texture and blend of spices. followed recipe almost exactly; i did not use the optional anchovy paste, nor the marjoram because i didnt have any in stock. really fast and easy. im glad that it didnt require cooking! i think honey was the "secret" ingredient that made it special. salt balanced it out so it was not too sweet for my taste. thanks for sharing!

I love this pizza sauce. Once I found it I knew I had found the one. My girlfriend loves it just as much so that's a huge relief. I have had it with anchovy paste and don't like it as much. I also make it the day before because it spices give it a ton more flavor the next day. I make one for dipping homemade breadsticks in as well. Everyone that I have had try my pizzas talk about the flavors in the sauce. Worth the trip to the store for the spices. They will last a while and you can't beat the taste you get. Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

This is my very favorite pizza sauce!  I do not use the anchovies.  I substitute brown sugar for the honey, and I only use 1 Tbsp. of brown sugar.  I also just sprinkle a little of the cayenne and omit the crushed red pepper altogether since my kids don't like too much spice.  Normally I make a double batch and then freeze the extra for a quick meal later on.

This is the best homemade pizza sauce ever. I did however heed other viewers and only put in 1 Tbs. of honey and left out anchovy paste, cayenne pepper, and crushed red pepper. Not a spicy gal. I also took someones advice and only put in 1/2t. of onion powder. My salt to taste was about 1/2t.. I paired this sauce up with Pillsbury Stuffed Crust Pizza. cooked for about 20 minutes total. It was delicious. Will make this again for sure. Makes enough for 2- 12 inch stuffed crust pizzas.

Exquisite! - even without the anchovies or dried red peppers.  We had Barbera wine just by accident with the meal tonight and had a great chuckle at the serendipitous suggestion!  A perfect match.

This is a fantastic pizza sauce!  I omitted the honey and anchovy paste and added more parmesan cheese.  I come from Chicago and live now in Germany.  The pizza here is horrible so I decided to make a real pizza for family and friends.  80% of a good pizza is the sauce and this did the trick.

Absolutely the best pizza sauce I ever had - made it exactly as the recipe stated BUT had no tomato paste - used 15 oz tomato sauce and skipped the water - it came out fantastic - will use it for a dipping sauce for a crusty bread too.  THANK U -

This was the best pizza sauce I've tried so far. My 5 yr old says she gives it a million stars :)
I put in a tiny bit of honey because of other reviews. Maybe 1/2 teaspoon.

Exactly what I wanted. Sweet and a bit spicy. I added 1/8 tsp of citric acid to perk it up a bit because I've always liked acidic tomatoes and Tom paste lacks that zing I like but even without it it would have been a very very nice. Thanks for the recipe! I will be making this again soon!

This sauce was too sweet for my family's taste.  My 7 year old who loves pizza wouldn't eat it.  I thought it was good and I liked the consistency.  I will try again next time without the honey.

I sautéed 1/2 onion, added the fresh garlic (2 cloves) used 1 tsp. honey, doubled Italian spices, added other ingredients to sauce pan but, used only a pinch of cayenne, didn't use anchovy or red pepper flakes....amazing...good thing about pre-cooking is that you can taste it warm and make your personal adjustments...great recipe...Thanks!!

This was delicious! I used only 1 tablespoon of honey, and omitted the anchovy paste, cayenne pepper, and marjoram (didn't have any). The paste I used was already seasoned with Italian herbs, so I don't know if that helped, but the whole thing was d-lish. This will be my go-to recipe.

This is the perfect pizza sauce. Flavors are so good. It freezes well too, so I usually keep some of this and some balls of pizza dough in the freezer for easy meals. We love it. Thanks for sharing!

Instead of honey, we used Mediterranean bay leaves.  It adds a natural sweetness to the sauce without adding any of the sugar.  Did cut back a bit on the red pepper too.  Still a great sauce!

I've made this sauce so often, I pretty much know it by memory.  Now I don't even look up the recipe.  I just throw ingredients together, sometimes substituting fresh herbs.  It's always a hit.  And I can give it to my gluten-free kids.

This is WONDERFUL! I would never have thought to put honey in my sauce (although I know that sugar is often an ingredient), but the honey really added depth to the flavor. The cayenne and the red pepper flakes added a bit of "bite" to the sauce. I WILL be making this again

This is great pizza sauce! It is easy to make because you don't have to cook it, yet still very flavorful. Five stars with half the honey and a little fennel seed. For us this makes enough for about six 12-inch pizzas. I store it in a jar in the fridge.

I found this sauce to be completely inedible.  Not only is it WAY too sweet, the honey in no way complements the other flavors.  Perhaps another sweetener would have resulted in something I could eat, but I won't be revisiting this recipe to find out.

Too sweet for me.  Next time I will substitute 1 teaspoon sugar.  I prefer to leave out the dried red pepper and cayenne because we use crushed red pepper as a topping.

Most amazing pizza sauce ever! It looks like work, but it's not.  I thought it would be too spicy, but instead I find it a wee bit sweet. The sauce is nice and thick and sticks to the pizza. Awesome.  I prefer to make the sauce at least 6 hours prior to making the pizza so the flavors have a chance to combine. The most difficult thing about this is waiting for the pizza to cool before we eat it!  We make it with the Bread Machine Pizza Dough at least 3 times a month and my pizza is my husband's favorite meal!

Sweet fresh and wonderful. Sauce is awesome and I have to say the best I ever tasted.. It was not hard to follow and I think it was the right amount of sauce. I did not add any red pepper flakes or cayenne pepper (personal preference) but followed everything else. Other reviewers suggestions helped a lot. I used all fresh herbs instead of dried which I know enhanced the flavor and made a difference in the sauce overall. I used this pizza sauce for, "Jay's Signature Pizza Dough," also from this website. The two turned out awesome together. Both are a keeper and I would make this again.

This is an excellent sauce. I made one change -- 1 4.5 oz tube of double-concentrated tomato paste instead of the can. It was what I had in the pantry, but I could tell that this would be great in its original form as well. My pizza muffins are gonna rock!

This is the best pizza sauce I have ever eaten! Whatever you do, don't leave out the honey--it's what MAKES this sauce. It's a tad bit spicy, but the honey helps mellow it down.

This sauce was delicious.  Great consistency, great flavor.  The recipe says makes enough for one pizza, and I wasn't sure big that is.  I made a double recipe of the sauce just to be safe, but I made two 12" pizzas, and still have 1/3 to1/2 of the sauce left.

I would consider using a little less water next time and I used Romano instead of parmesan. The sweet/spicy flavor was awesome! Great recipe.

I made two pizzas with this sauce. One with several toppings and one with just pepperoni. The heavily loaded pizza was very good and the sauce had just the right amount of spiciness to it. The pepperoni pizza allowed me to taste the sauce a little better and I felt it was overly sweet. For me though, I prefer lots of toppings and loved how the sauce worked with everything.

This was easy to fix with ingredients I always have on hand. I used 3 oz of white wine and 3 oz of water instead of the 6 oz of water, 1 Tbsp of honey instead of 2, and left out the cayenne pepper and crushed red pepper in deference to tender tummies. It came out delicious.

I tasted this before I put it on the pizza and I thought this was way too sweet.  I did add the anchovies.  After baking this in my pizza I thought it was well balanced with my toppings.  Pretty good and I will prolly make it again.

I couldn't find any anchovy paste, so I had to make the sauce without it - but it turned out VERY well!  I made it exactly as directed with the exception of the anchovy paste.  It actually came out like something you'd get at a pizza joint!  Thank you!

This sauce is Great!  Thanks Angie.  I did double the recipe, 1/2'd the Honey.  This is the perfect home made sauce I have been looking for!
  Thanks so much for sharing

Pretty good!  I was out of honey, so I used white sugar.  I only used 1 tablespoon, based upon other reviews, and it was still too sweet for me.  I also had to add a little more water, the sauce was a little too thick for me.  Good flavor though, will use again, but next time I'll just add a pinch of sugar/honey.

UPDATED: This is our go-to sauce recipe.  I use it every Friday night, with these modifications: 8oz water instead of 6oz, and only 1 scant teaspoon of honey, instead of 2 Tbsp.  It's great, and I usually double it and freeze the extra, it thaws beautifully!

Found this and have made it twice.  Everyone likes it but a little to hot in spice.  So, today after reading a  review her about combining and multiplying I thought about FOODSAVER CANISTERS I own.  So, I doubled it and mixed it leaving the Cayenne Pepper Red Pepper Flakes at 1/8 teaspoon.  Now everyone likes it much more.  This was a great Idea to make more, next time I am doing it by 4.   The FOODSAVER keep it fresh for weeks and then it's going to be even more even in flavor as it marinates.  Thanks for the great recipe to make this sauce.  Sharing is the new old way to make this world a better place.

Zing!  Great flavor with a pop of heat.  I did find however that the left-over sauce I put in the fridge overnight was even better the 2nd night.  My suggestion would be to make this in volume at least one day before you need it & can/freeze it for future use!

Great pizza sauce.  I used it to make a Chicago-style deep dish pizza.  Meal was GREAT!!  I halved the honey and pepper, but doubled the overall recipe.  Also, I brought the sauce to a boil, then simmered for about 30 minutes.

Overall we loved this sauce. However I found it to be a little too sweet while my parents found it to be too spicy. I'll be experimenting in the future to find a happy medium.

I tried to follow the suggestions of other reviews and the sauce was still "too sweet and oniony," as someone else put it. I strongly suggest you use only a quarter of the honey, two thirds of the onion powder, half the cayenne pepper, and just a dash of dried red pepper flakes. Also, if you don't have marjoram, add a little extra basil and oregano. Note: This recipe says it yields 1 pizza, but I made two twelve inch pizzas with it.

Great sauce, I ended up using chopped onions instead of the onion powder and also I didn't use the anchovy paste and it was excellent, I'm using this today again but with a different dough since using pizza dough I did not turn out the way I liked

Yum!! I've been struggling to make great pizza sauce and this recipe is great!! I skipped on the anchovies and honey though, and used 2 cloves of garlic mashed and a tablespoon onions mashed (both using a mortar and pestle) instead of the minced garlic and onion powder. I also added some chopped onions and salt. Wonderful taste

Wonderful! I followed the recipe, except for red pepper flakes and onion powder, neither of which I had. Used a bit more cayenne instead, and some very finely diced red onion. I found the two tbsp. of honey to be a bit much when tasting the sauce on its own, but on the actual pizza it was just fine. Put this on Jay's Signature Pizza Crust (also on this site) and topped with cheese and veggies. Delicious! Thanks!

I used fresh basil and cooked it on the stove for 5-7 min. It was great. i used the original amount of cayenne pepper (doubled it since I had not pepper flakes) and it had a very nice spicy kick to it. I reduced the amount of honey, but ended adding some more. So as a conclusion, I wouldn't change a thing (aside of adding fresh herbs if you have these). It is spicy, s take it into account.

Our absolutely FAVORITE pizza sauce!  The only thing we change when making it, is reducing the honey to 1 tablespoon.

I prepared this recipe as is the first time, with the exception of omitting the anchovy paste and dried marjoram as I didn't have either.  I did not care for the honey; it added a strange sweet bouquet to the sauce that made it taste slightly artificial.  I made a few changes the second time and the results were almost perfect.  Reductions: 6 fl oz of warm water to 4 fl oz for a meatier and heartier tomato flavor.  A pinch of red pepper flakes, especially if you are using a creamier softer cheese, such as chèvre, as too much pepper will overpower it.  Omissions: Anchovy paste and marjoram.  Substitutions: 1 tsp of brown sugar for the honey.  Helps offset the tartness without making the sauce too sweet.  With these changes, I'd rate the new version a 4.5.  Almost perfect.

Great sauce! The only thing I did differently was to add corn syrup because I didn't have any honey. This is a keeper!

Overall, good sauce. I thought it was too sweet as written. Next time I'll cut the honey by half. I like that this recipe makes enough sauce for more than one pizza.

I recommend this recipe to all my family and friends. It really is exquisite!   We reduce the sauce down (simmering on the stove) for awhile to concentrate and blend the flavors before using.   It makes quite a bit so we end up freezing half for another time.

WOW!! Great!!  Made exact except no marjoram, subbed pinch of sugar for the honey, and couldn't find anchovy paste at store. I mixed everything and let it set for a few hours in the fridge to fuse flavors together.  I have used this about 8 times in past 2 weeks on a homemade pizza crust. It was just what i've been needin for that perfect homemade sauce. A little spicy(for some maybe. not me!!) but even my 3 yr old eats it up.  Great!!! Thanks for sharing!!

Great sauce! Instead of water, I used the juice from a can of tomatoes (which was exactly the right amount), and I swapped cayenne pepper for ancho, but my wife still thought the sauce had a bit too much kick. I thought it was perfect.

Update: I didn't realize I had used this sauce before, but it still worked like a charm. I think cayenne is a garbage pepper to work with, so I used chipotle and the same tomato juice method I did last time. For some reason, I had no complaints about the heat this time even though chipotle is hotter than ancho. All said and done, I made this about 3 hours ahead of the pizza and let the flavors all soak together. I may try to add a splash of vodka or red wine and cook the sauce down a bit, since tomatoes have some alcohol soluble flavors that I'd love to bring out in the sauce.

I was making for kids so I left out anchovy, cayenne and red pepper. Didn't use honey but did use 1 teaspoon white sugar. Only had Italian Seasoning (not separate spices) so used 3/4 teaspoon of that. Was lazy so used garlic powder instead of fresh. Easy to make and tastes good. Was way too much sauce for our amount of crust so will freeze the remaining for next time.

What a fabulous recipe! This was absolutely EXQUISITE! This is our new go to pizza sauce now. My seven year and 4 year old loved it. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe. It couldn't be easier to make and I'll be freezing many batches to have on hand.

I reduced the honey to one tablespoon, and it still dominated the flavor. I would definitely reduce it to one teaspoon next time if I made it again. I used only 1/2 teas. anchovy paste, and used all the remaining ingredients listed. The sauce was just okay.  I liked the "heat", but it certainly wasn't the greatest pizza sauce I've ever tasted!!

I haven't quite figured out how to make this perfect to our liking yet.  It was too sweet and too hot.  It also made up much more than we needed for our pizzas on the grill.

This was very good. I especially liked that it was quick and easy. I cut the honey in half and it was still just a tad too sweet for me, but I also added more garlic to give a little more kick. A great recipe all around. Thanks!

This was phenomenal.  I did what a lot of other reviewers suggested and I did half the amount of honey because we don't like our pizza sauce too sweet.  I might have had a tad more garlic too but those were the only changes.  I used this on grilled personal pizzas and I used the Pizza Dough II from this site as well.  I used Emeril's recipe for white pizza sauce on one of the pizzas and got rave reviews.  This pizza sauce truly is exquisit and could not be easier to prepare and it stores well.

Super easy and most certainly lives up to its name! We did what other users have said and toned down the honey and spices just a tad. I have a two year old and didn't want to overwhelm her with spiciness! We used about 1/2 each of cayenne and pepper flakes. Everyone loved it!

This is the BEST sauce I've ever had! I've made four pizzas in the last two weeks! I go heavy on the cayenne, black pepper, and red pepper. My boyfriend and I love the spiciness.

EXQUISITE! I omitted the marjoram (didn't have any), and cut the honey back to 1 tablespoon. I had plenty to cover two 14" pizzas. I will be using this recipe from now on! Thanks for sharing. :)

Delicious! I doubled the recipe because there didn't look like enough to cover a large pizza. I made the recipe as is, but next time I would only use a pinch of cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes - it had a little too much zing for my liking! A great staple recipe!

LOVE This sauce there is none better!  We make it every time we have pizza or cheese bread for dip.  Even my kids love it.  I have not been using the anchovy paste.  Everything else we have followed to the letter.  It also works great with any can of tomato product, we have started with diced or sauce, or even a spaghetti what ever we have on hand.  Then blended or simmered until desirable.

Fantastic pizza sauce.  I only had tomato sauce on hand so I converted it to paste by pouring it into a pan, and heating until It reduced by half.  While it was heating I put all of the other ingrediants to simmer with the sauce.  It turned out really great.  I used the "Pizza Dough I" recipe from this site and it complimented the sauce very well.  I will be making this again and again.  Thank you, Angie for your recipe.

Simply omitting the honey raises this to a 5* recipe.  My husband is Italian (ye gods) and he's VERY particular about his pizza - - - anchovy paste is an absolute MUST.  All in all, we're quite pleased and thank you so much for recipe.

We thought this was yummy!  I only put in 1 tsp of honey and omitted anchovy paste, cayenne pepper and red flakes.  We don't care for spicy,  this was perfect!

Haven't bought pizza sauce since I found this recipe. And the best part, I finally found something to do with all the marjoram I bought awhile ago! LOL!  This sauce is fantastic!

I love this sauce. Sometimes I add a little more or less cayenne and red pepper depending on who is going to be eating the pizza. This is great for a pizza or for dipping breadsticks in.

I have to say I'm confused about this recipe's ratings.  This sauce has a very unique flavor that we did not like at all... it has quite a kick for pizza sauce and found that honey sweetening did not mix well with the other flavors.  It also takes quite a bit of time to make in comparison to other sauces.    I made pizza for my daughter's birthday party (using Easy Pizza Sauce III and Pizza Dough III from this site... both EXCELLENT recipes!) and my sister said she had tried a pizza sauce that received amazing ratings and just tasted bizarre and it turned out it was THIS recipe!  We have no clue why this is rated so well, but if you're looking for a great NORMAL pizza sauce, try Easy Pizza Sauce III!    The 2 stars are because it was edible... not gross but not good either.

So yummy! This was the perfect blend of spices, not too spicy and not too bland. I took the advice of another reviewer and put in cayenne and left out the red pepper flakes.  Next time I will try red pepper flakes and leave out the cayenne!

I love this sauce.  I've used it multiple times.  I like to add a little bit more cayenne pepper just to spice it up more.  But it doesn't need it, unless you like spicy food like I do.

This pizza sauce ROCKS.  It's incredibly flavorful, and I like the kick added by the red pepper flakes and cayenne pepper.  I didn't have any anchovy paste or marjoram, so I had to leave them out.  The sauce still tasted fantastic, and was very easy to make.

This sauce really is exquisite! It makes anything taste good. It has a spicy kick to it, yet the honey evens it out to make a complex tasty flavor. I'll always use this for my pizzas. Definite 5 stars!

This was exquisite! I doubled the recipe and I cut the honey back to half, but otherwise made as is because I didn't want it too sweet as others had suggested. Fabulous! Thanks for sharing!

Very good pizza sauce,i didn't use the anchovy paste, marjoram, dried basil or cayenne. Mostly because i didn't have them handy and it was simply amazing!

I loooove this! I don't change a thing except i make it over the stove top and let it saute before putting in the fridge This is my boyfriends fave. We have pizza Fridays.  I love throwing sauce, some mozz cheese and pepporoni onto some pieces of bread and throwing it into the sandwich maker.  like a pizza hot pocket but muuuch better!

I've made a few pizzas recently and have been looking for a great sauce since I've never been really impressed with store bought. I must say I didn't have any marjoram and I added chili powder instead of cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes just because it was what I had. And this was still amazing. It has a little extra kick with the perfect amount of sweetness. And basically just costs the amount of a can of tomato paste! Mine generously topped a small (10") and medium pizza (about a 15" diameter) so think twice before making a huge batch. I love the idea of having the spices ready!

This sauce is fantastic! Easy to make and tastes better than any pizza sauce that I've purchased.  I did omit the honey and did not use any anchovy paste.  This sauce paired with Jay's Signature Pizza Crust from this site makes the best pizza.  I used my pizza stone for one pie and a regular pizza pan for the other and both were fantastic. Super easy and tastes way better than any delivery pizza!

Made without anchovy paste & marjoram (only because I didn't have any), only 1 Tbsp honey (because so many reviews complained about it being too sweet) & 4 Tbsps parmesan cheese (because I love it).  I let it sit in the fridge all day before I used it and wow!  It's about ten thousand times better than store bought sauce.  It has a little spice which I absolutely love (but still nothing my 2 and 3 year old couldn't handle).  Next time I'll add a little more spice for the adults.  Excellent!  Thank you Angie!

I followed this recipe exactly except for one thing.  For fear of ending up with a sweet sauce, I cut back the honey to just 1 tablespoon. I also left out the anchovy paste, only because I couldn't find it in the store.  I simmered this sauce for a few to really get the flavors going.  At first taste I was scared, because it tasted rather bland with just heat it in.  However, when actually eaten on the pizza, it was great! Nice flavor with a small kick of heat.

Perfect, absolutely perfect. I cannot have pizza any longer as it has so much sodium in it. Having high blood pressure and having to be on a restricted diet of only 1,400 mg of sodium a day, pizza just was not an option any longer. Until now, canned tomatoes have so much sodium that I could not even make homemade sauce. Never thought about tomato past. Looked at the can, no sodium. Love it! Not only does this sauce serve as a low-sodium option, it also tasted wonderful. MY wife thought I was crazy for trying this recipe, but when she ate it, she only had wonderful things to say about it and how great it tasted, not too sweet, not an overpowering tomato flavor, just the right amount of everything. The only thing I would change next time would be to add a little more honey as I tend to like more a of a sweeter sauce.

Delicious.  I don't care much for sweet food (unless it's dessert) so I waited until the end to add the honey.  After tasting I decided to add only 1/2 Tbsp of honey, and I thought that was perfect. This recipe was enough for one large pizza - it was more than I needed for an 11" Boboli thin crust.  I plan to pre-mix some of the dry spices for future use, as suggested by other reviewers.  For vegetarians, I think this would be very good even without the anchovy paste.

This recipe has become our house recipe for pizza sauce.  I skip the anchovy paste, and after reading the other reviews changed the 2T honey to 1T granulated sugar.  The honey had too distinct of a taste for our preference.  I took the advice of another reviewer and make a large batch of the spices which makes prep time even faster.  I find the recipe yields enough sauce that I am usuallly able to freeze at least one pizza's worth of sauce.

This is the best pizza sauce!  I don't add the anchovy paste because its not something I keep on hand.  I do add about 1/2 teaspoon of fennel seed which makes it even better.

I don't like a sweet sauce/didn't like the honey in it and thought it is better with the honey left out. Since the 2 red peppers is too spicy for "kid food" I subsituted  powdered garlic for the cayenne. I wasn't sure I would like a "paste" tasting sauce and used pureed tomatoes for the water for more texture. It was a hit with a couple minor changes. I do like that it is not a cooked pizza sauce. Next time I will make it even more in advance than 30 minutes (like a day ahead) and I bet the flavors will be even better. Today I make the sauce when I made the dough so it sat around while the dough was rising. I use the dough from Real Italian Calzones from this site....it makes a good pizza dough too!!

Great sauce!!!  This will replace the long-standing standard sauce we used to make when we had pizza night.  I think I might cut the honey in half next time I make it.

I would say the only drawback to this sauce is that it makes me want to eat about 5 pizzas on my own.  I accidentally added about thrice the garlic (which was OK since we love garlic), and I used Italian seasoning in place of all of the spices. Still totally delish.  Thanks!

Very good sauce- I followed the recommendations of other reviewers and lessened the amt of honey. We like it hot and spicy, so we didn't lessen the amount of peppers. We happened to have just today bought a can of anchovies- we crushed enough to make two teaspoons (I doubled the amount to freeze some) and added that- it does add another very delicate layer of flavor- however, I am sure it would be almost as good without! I did use a 12 oz can of tomato sauce and let it reduce it down to thicken it some. Definitely a keeper.

Super delicious! I left out the red pepper, marjoram and anchovy paste because I had none.  My 3 year old really liked it but my 8 year old said it was too spicy.  Thank you! Much cheaper than ordering out!

The sauce was a huge hit. I gave it 4 stars because I did change the spice amounts. I added more of all the spices, especially the hot stuff because I like spicy, and reduced the honey. It's easy to adjust to your liking, and it's really easy to make.

This sauce was amazing! I made it for my dad, and he doesn't like things very herby, so I cut down on everything a little bit - but he loved it! I did leave out the anchovy paste, because honestly it just grosses me out.

The best recipe for pizza sauce I've tried! The second time I made it I only added 1 tbs of honey and omitted the red and black pepper since it was a bit too sweet and hot for my taste. I ended up using 1-1/2 tbs of honey and it's perfect for me and the family. My search for the perfect pizza sauce is over. Thanks Angie!

This was excellent. I made it with a homemade crust ( try the Jay's signature Pizza crust-- awesome) My company asked me about the sauce. They loved it! I did add a couple teaspoons of italian seasoning also.  I did like some suggested and took the dry ingredients and timzed it by 10 and made extra dry ingredients, put it in a jar so when I make more sauce all I need to do is add the liquids. Then Use about 1 large TBSP of the seasoning from the jar with the liquids.   What a time savings then.  One recipe makes enough for 1 pizza. I let it sit at room temperature at least 1 hour to have the flavors become enhanced.

Very nice sauce.  I didn't have anchovy or marjoram but otherwise followed the recipe.  Very tasty but light.  I liked the texture on my ciabatta bread pizzas.  Not over powering like some other sauces can be.

Unique blend.  My family liked it.  It had both a touch of sweet and spicey.  I did not add the crushed red pepper as I didn't want to be too spicy for my kids, but will probably throw in  a dash next time.

FANTASTIC SAUCE!! Hubby and I LOVED this sauce - kids are 3 and >2...so not sure they have opinions yet!!  Definite keeper - didn't use anchovy paste and added a dash of garlic salt..For those who thought it was too runny - just don't use the full amount of water...think I still had a little left in cup. Thanks for sharing!

This is a great sauce recipe!  I omitted the anchovy paste, marjoram and cayenne pepper (didn't have these ingredients on hand) and added 1/2 tsp kosher salt to the mix.  One batch of this is more than enough for one pizza.

I'm only rating this a 4 star right now since I've not tried any others. But I found this one and it's amazing even before we start tweaking it.  We found it a little too sweet, but think that might have been because we used Contadina tomato sauce. We're trying it with Hunts tonight to see if it's mellower on the sweet. Then to tweaking!

Fantastic recipe! I 4x the recipe and freeze the extra for quick fixing in 2 pizza increments. I use less honey and skip the anchovy paste. Has a nice little kick.

This sauce is easy and delicious.  I like to measure things out, but I found I can guesstimate with the amount of seasoning and still get a great result! I usually don't have every single ingredient, so I use "Italian Seasoning" and omit the anchovy paste.  Still scrumptious every time.  I pair this with "Jay's Signature Pizza Crust" also found on allrecipes.com

I omitted the honey and anchovy paste because I didn't have any.  The overall result was good.  I will try again with some modifications to suit our tastes.  Next time I might use tomato sauce vs. the paste and water as another reviewer mentioned.

Exquisite!!!I was looking for a Fajita recipe to satisfy a craving and stumbled across this. Two things I changed: added only 1 Tbs of honey instead of 2 thinking it would be too sweet for our taste and I did not add the Anchovies.  I made the pizza's on whole wheat pita's; using up all 6 and still had sauce left over :) My man LOVED them!!! For toppings I used, mushrooms, cajun chicken (purchased a ready roasted chicken shredded the breast and seasoned with Cajun), onion, red peppers, spinach and goat cheese. Amazing, Thanks Angie :)

This was delicious.   I made a few modifications and I think that next time I will try it with just 1 Tbsp. honey.   I used 1/2 tsp. garlic powder because I was feeling lazy and didn't want to mince the fresh.  I added an extra 1/8 tsp. basil and oregano.  (I also put fresh basil on the pizza)  I didn't have anchovy paste.  Left out the red pepper flakes and salt.    I will save this as my standard pizza sauce!

I am planning to make pizza this weekend and decided to make this ahead of time. I made it, let it sit for about 30 minutes and I was totally impressed. I did change the recipe a bit as I like garlic and used canned parmesan cheese. It's still delicious. Now I'm even more excited about making pizza

Very good and easy.  Be sure to let it marry the flavors. I did not and i think it would've been better had i done that.  I agree with the sweetness factor... too much.  Next time i will either omit completely or reduce.  I definitely make again. Thanks!

A bit sweet but I figured the pizza sauce would even out with the anchovy sauce.

I will never buy pizza sauce again. My family loved this. I did leave out the crushed red pepper as I do not like anything hot. I used this on homemade french bread pizzas and it was absolutely wonderful!

Amazing! I opted out of the anchovi paste (more because I didn't want to go out and buy it than flavor issues) and halved the honey amount and it was perfect. I also like really flavorful sauce, so I added a little extra basil and oregano and it turned out amazing. It was easy and my friends and family were stunned by how good it was!

Very good sauce if you use quality ingredients.  I made 2 batches, one with name brand tomato paste and the other with a store brand.  Name brand was excellent, Store brand was very bitter. As always, I guess you get what you pay for!

The best ever sauce I have tasted on a pizza, This will be our family favourite for a long time.  The kids absolutely loved it including my 2 year old.  I omitted the marjoram, anchovy, red pepper flakes and cayenne pepper.  I also used 1 tsp of honey and instead of tomato paste I used tomato puree and opted for a finely diced onion.

This sauce is excellent!  I followed this recipe almost to the T;  I omitted the anchovy paste (I did not have on hand) and reduced the amount of cayenne and red pepper by half...just because I know that as the sauce would sit, it might get too hot for my taste.    Not only is the recipe tasty, it's easy.  It's almost as easy opening a jar of sauce from my cupboard.  A good thing about this recipe is that you can make it as sweet or as spicy as you want.  I don't think that the honey was too much, but, I do prefer a sweeter sauce.  Also, if you like to make your pizza dough from scratch, this recipe is good because it gives you a half hour to make it while your sauce ingredients marry.    If you're looking for a easy, tasty pizza sauce, this is definitely it!

I didn't like this at all. Way too much garlic and I couldn't get it sweet enough. My husband liked it though so he got to eat the whole pizza.

This was GREAT!! I didn't have any honey, so I just used a little sugar. We didn't use the anchovy paste and added just a touch more of the paprika and red pepper flakes because we like the extra kick!

I have made this sauce a couple of times now.  It is very easy and it smells delicious.  I like how it is sweetened with honey instead of suger, but it is a little too sweet.  I may only use half the honey next time.

This will work in a pinch, but it's far from five stars! Much too sweet, and still retained that tinny taste from the tomato paste.

I halved the honey and left out the cayenne as suggested. If left cold it's still rather sweet. But if you cook it, some of the sweetness seems to go away and the heat of the pepper takes over. I liked it, but it was still too spicy for my kids. I'll halve the red pepper flakes next time.

Awesome awesome awesome. I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe. I find it funny that other reviewers find it too spicy. I am very sensitive to spicy food, and have no problem with this sauce. I didn't use anchovy paste, nor marjoram. I doubled the oregano since I didn't use the marjoram (wouldn't even know where to look for this spice). This is enough to make 3-4 medium size pizza's, depending on how much sauce you like. This is my new go-to pizza sauce recipe. Delish!

Oooh it's really good and so easy... I didn't quite believe I didn't have to cook it - but it tasted so good. I used Italian mixed herbs, and left out the spice and anchovy as my little girl is so fussy and she loved it! She never eats pizza usually. Will try it with anchovy next time.

Love it!!  Easily adaptable to taste, although I love it the way it is, for my family the three kinds of pepper are way too much.  I make two batches, one for them minus all pepper and still add honey, it is not too sweet and one batch for me as it is written.  I also have left out the cheese on more than one occasion, it is perfectly fine without.  For me I think the anchovy paste is a must, it adds a depth of flavor without you ever knowing it is anchovy paste.

This is good but needs some tweaking.  I decreased the Parmesan to 1 tablespoon, decreased the honey to 3/4 teaspoon, and decreased the cayenne pepper to 1/16 teaspoon.  I replaced the anchovy paste  with 1/4 teaspoon of salt because I'm a vegetarian.  I really like spicy food but even with the decreased cayenne pepper, this would probably be too spicy for kids and others who can't handle the heat.

Spicy and sweet, this pizza sauce was definitely easy and exceptional.  I really could not believe just how good it was.  I didn't include the Parmesan, anchovy or majoram because I was out...it didn't matter.  I made a pizza for a dinner party and it was a big hit.  Don't hesitate to try this!

This recipe was sooo awesome!  I did leave out the following items:parmesan cheese, honey, anchovy paste, and the cayenne and red pepper flakes.  That may seem like alot of ingredients to leave out--but my kids don't like it spicy- I don't like fish and I did not want to make it too sweet--  I did double the recipe for two of the "brick-oven pizza" on this site-- The two together were AMAZING-TRY IT!

So awesome and so budget-friendly.  Worth combining all the spices ahead of time in a larger batch if you like this recipe and think you'll be making your own pizzas from scratch more often...

very tasty!  it's spicy and sweet at the same time.  based on someone else's review that the recipe didn't yield much, i made a double batch for my pizza.  i only used half of what i made and will freeze the rest.  i would say that a single batch is the perfect amount to cover a large pizza.

My fiance enjoyed this sauce, but I thought it was too sweet.  I might make it again with less honey, but use it for a gourmet-type pizza that a sweeter sauce would go well with (just in case it is still too sweet).

This is now a staple in our household! When I was a kid, my family always made homemade pizza on Fridays.  Now my husband and I make it and shared this pizza sauce recipe with my parents.  I love the honey instead of the sugar and the sauce is better when it sits longer for the flavor to mix. THANK YOU!!

The first time I made this recipe I liked it, but just found it to be ok.  Something was missing, I kept adding salt thinking that was the case and in the end I was just a little underwhelmed.  I have since discovered that it was missing Olive Oil.  I felt it needed something to neutralize the acidity from the tomato paste.  So now I just dice my garlic up and saute it in oil- 1/4 c or so -  for a few minutes prior to adding the other ingredients.  I now find this to be a great recipe.    (Just an FYI for anyone else, I tend to double the spices, half the honey, and change the liquid from 6 oz water, to 4 oz water and 2 oz red wine - but I like bold flavor)

This is really good pizza sauce, I will definitely be using it again in the near future. The only change that I made was to use 1/2 of the honey that was called for and it was still plenty sweet for us.

Excellent! I will definitely be making this again... still without the anchovy business and I would cut back on the honey, for sure. It is INSANELY sweet for me (but then again, so is root beer)... a teaspoon of honey would probably do it. Very quick (especially when waiting for the pizza dough to rise anyway) and easy!

Well, the first time we made this, we were out of honey, so we substituted brown sugar.  We also did not have anchovy paste..despite these changes, this was WONDERFUL sauce!  We used a can of plum tomatoes, which added to the sweetness of the sauce.  The pepper gave it a nice burst of heat, but didn't overpower it.  We made enough to have extra and used it as a dipping sauce for garlic bread when we had company.  It was a huge hit!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Super easy and great flavor makes for a 5 star rating.  Only change I'll make next time is to reduce the amount of honey as it was just a touch too sweet.  Thank you for posting this recipe!

I made a pizza from scratch for the first time last night, I'm so proud of myself! :) This sauce was GREAT, the honey adds the hint of sweetness and the red pepper and cayenne add the extra kick. Followed the recipe exactly as written and plan on taking other reviewers advise on making a bunch of the seasoning to have on hand.

Great pizza sauce. I made the sauce in the morning and kept in the refrigerator all day, so all the flavors blended well. I omitted the anchovy paste and used fresh basil, which gave a nice flavor to this sauce.

We found it a bit sweet.  We cut the honey to 1TBLS and we did not have any anchovy paste...and my BF doesn't like it...so we left it out.  This has been added to our list of must have's...we make Jays Pizza crust and we don't order out anymore...this freezes very well too.  We mix it up and let it blend together for at least 30min before putting into the freezer. Thank you!!! VERY GOOD!!!

They say that this sauce is so full of flavor but honestly I didn't taste much flavor. I had to add extra spices and to me it kind of tasted like a jarred spaghetti sauce. Next time i will probably use a different recipe.

I found this sauce not thick enough. It ended up spilling over the sides of my pizza making a big mess in the oven. We even put the sauce not too close to the edges of the pizza dough and it still ran over. I omitted the anchovy paste and found the flavor okay.

This didn't turn out well for me... it was too liquidy, and soaked into the pizza dough. The flavor was good.

I made this for pan pizzas this week, doubling the recipe.  When I sampled the sauce before it had "blended," it tasted acidic and somewhat bland.  It definitely needed salt, more pepper flakes, and I increased the herbs, because I like spicy pizzas.  After blending and baking, it was just good, but I'll try something else next time.

A-ma-zing! Make it as stated, but with only 1 Tbsp honey. The anchovy paste adds an extra dimension that I highly recommend. It's suttle and not fishy at all. You can buy it in a tube at any grocery store and it lasts forever. We made triple the recipe and used the left overs (plus water) the next day to put over pasta.

I think this is a very flavorful sauce.  It really had excellent flavor.  However, if you do not like  a pizza with a sweet sauce this is not the recipe for you.

Wonderful recipe!  I did however use a short cut.  I had Italian Tomato Sauce in my pantry, so then I added the Cheese, some more garlic, Marjoram,and Oregano - perfect Pizza sauce.  Never buying any pizza sauce again!

Sure beats the heck out of jar pizza sauce:) I didn't have any marjoram so I just used italian seasoning instead. Wonderful for dipping bread sticks and of course great on our homemade pizzas.

I made this recipe as is, and it was WAY too sweet.  I added a ton of garlic salt after reading a couple or reviews & it was much better.  Next time I will only add 1/2 the honey.

WOW!  This recipe is the perfect pizza sauce.  Even with minor tweaks depending on what is in our pantry, it always comes out delicious.  We don't always have anchovy paste, but I always make sure to add the honey and crushed red pepper.

Thursday night is pizza night so I made this with Jay's Pizza Crust.  The sauce was very good.  However, I found it too spicy.  I am going to make this again, however, I am going to cut back on the spices.

I have made this several times and I am going to keep looking. This is not a kid friendly recipe with all the spice. I too think that that it is a little sweet and spicy, but do believe that at least a 1/4 tsp of brown sugar should be added to counteract the acidity in the tomato paste and pepper omitted. Will try slow cooking  for a few hours next time. Afterall spaghetti is always better in the crockpot.

My husband and I love the bold flavors of the pizza sauce.  However, my three year old and one year old aren't the biggest fans.  The three year old won't eat it at all and my one year old eats very little.  we cut back the red pepper and then it's too sweet.  We've cut back on both and then it's a little too dull for us.  We're going to keep making it as written in hopes the girls will change their minds eventually.

This was our first experiment with homemade pizza from scratch. Made the crust dough in our breadmaker and tried out this recipe for the sauce. Per other reviewers, we cut the honey and red pepper in half (and then doubled everything to make more sauce overall). It made 2 medium pizzas with a bit of sauce leftover to dip crusts in.  I wasn't as pleased with the sauce alone just dipping the crusts into it, but on the actual pizza itself it was WONDERFUL! I divided one into thirds (Hawaiian, sausage/bacon, and cheese) and each part was sooo good. Much cheaper than buying 2 medium pizzas and we had a lot of fun making them! Thank you for a great sauce recipe! We will definitely use this again!

So GOOD! The best ever. I used 1 tsp. garlic powder instead of fresh. Only because I was lazy :) This is the best sauce. Even if you don't have time to let it sit. It is so flavorful! Great for breadstick sauce too! A+++  Thanks!   Jennifer

I love this pizza sauce!!!  It is on the sweet side, but that's the way I like it.  I have made it with and without the anchovy paste--both ways are good, but I think the paste makes it taste the best.  I sometimes use an 8 ounce can of tomato sauce in place of the tomato paste and water. Also, I usually omit the marjoram. This recipe freezes really well, so make a bunch and freeze it in individual containers. Thaw one out when you need it for great tasting pizza!!!

Did not use anchovy paste, cut down amount of honey and red pepper.  Excellent flavor, will use again and again.

This was a great recipe! I loved the flavor of it; all of the spices blend well for a really sweet and spicy sauce. I added a little more crushed red peppers for my boyfriend and ended up suffering! Next time I use the recommended measurement!

Followed directions exactly - absolutely fantastic!  We loved the sweetness of the honey and the warm kick.  We use a thin later of sauce on our pizzas and were able to easily top (2) large crusts.  Love the idea of storing the dry ingredients together for next time.  Thanks!

Before I found this recipe, I bought 2 brands of pizza sauce from the store.  This was sooo much better than either one of the bought ones!  I make this exactly as given and I usually double or triple the amount in order to have plenty in the fridge.  I use this for dipping the Pizza Pinwheels from this site in.  I make pizza with this using Jay's Signature Pizza Crust, again, from this site.  An all around awesome recipe.  You can play around with the ingredient amounts but it is, indeed, exquisite as so aptly named, exactly as written. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

If you like your red sauces on the sweet side as I do, this recipe is for you! The cayenne and black peppers also add the perfect amount of spice to make this truly exquisite.

Yum!  This was my favorite part of my pizza.  Taking others advise, I only added half of the honey and I also added a bit more of the pepper flakes (personal preference).  It turned out great!  Will make again.

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly, except I omitted the anchovy paste and used a thin sliver of finely minced onion instead of onion powder. It turned out FAR too sweet for my tastes - but, aside from that, pretty good.

The second time, I omitted the honey as well, and used about twice as much oregano. That turned out much better - but I reserve five-star recipes for truly transcendent culinary experiences, so this gets four stars. Next time I might add some finely chopped Kalamata olives.

This sauce didn't taste like much by itself, but slathered on the crust with salami, roasted red peppers and cheese, it truly was exquisite. My husband said it was the best pizza he has ever had!

This was really good.  I didn't add the anchove paste because I didn't have any and I thought the sauce was a tad too sweet.  Next time I will decrease the honey to 1tbsp.  All in all, pretty good.

Made as directed, with 1 T honey.  Let sit overnight in fridge.  It was...meh.  Not awful but a bit too sweet and tasted like something was missing.  I wouldn't make it again.

I was kind of disappointed in this. It was edible, but I wouldn't make it again for pizza. It may not be bad as marinara for mozzarella sticks or as a sauce for chicken, but it was just way too sweet for pizza.

This is a wonderful pizza sauce with lots of flavor! It will definately be our sauce of choice from now on. The only thing I did not add was anchovy paste, because I couldn't see ever needing it for anything else and I don't make pizza very often.

OMG!!!  I was hungry for pizza and didn't want to get out tonight (we live too far out in the country for delivery), so I thought, I'll just make some home-made pizza using crescent rolls and other ingred's I had on hand.  This is WAY better than ANY pizza I could have bought!  I had to come back and review it tonight.  Definately one for the keeper pile!  Thanks so much for the recipe and ditto to the others who advised to make this in large batches.  Never again will I buy the quick pizza sauce in a jar!

I felt that this recipe was more than just "okay" but however I did double it, and omitted the anchovy paste. Also I thought it was rather thick, so I added a 1/4 cup of water. I wasn't big on the honey taste and I will probably make this again but use sugar instead of the honey.

I did not use the onion powder, marjoram, or red pepper flakes (because I didn't have them) - and it still turned out great! My husband loved it. It definitely has a sweet taste, but if you like that, you will love this!

WOW -- a real jewel of a pizza sauce.  I didn't have any tomato paste so I used tomato sauce and a couple of tablespoons of water.  I didn't have any anchovy paste, either.  Can't wait to try it with that.  I zapped the whole concoction in the microwave for about 40 seconds to help the flavors blend and did let the sauce sit. I made a large pizza and had sauce left over.  We like our pizza with a thin layer of sauce.

Very good.  I made with only 1 T honey and a few other tweaks based on what I had on hand and the sauce was awesome.  Very good base recipe.

This is my standard pizza sauce recipe.  I only omit the anchovy paste.  I ususally have enough sauce for two pizzas using the Trader Joe pizza doughs.

This was very good.  I doubled the recipe and follwed it as written except I didn't add any cayenne pepper or anchovy paste.  I made a pizza tonight for dinner and had my two grandbabies and didn't think I wanted it very hot.  Our 16 month old grand daughter just loved the pizza.  We had to stop her from eating it.  Her 3 year old brother who is very picky...did what he always does and picked at it. I had a lot of sauce left over.  The recipe said it served "4" and I made my pizza in a 13x9 cookie sheet so didn't think it would be enough. I was wrong.  I'll freeze the leftover sauce for another time.

What a good sauce!  Used with the Basil Goat Cheese Pizza...yummy combo!  I didn't have anchovy paste or marjoram so I didn't add it.  Also didn't have honey so used brown sugar instead.  Next time I'll half the sugar.

The best! I use it with Jay's Signature Pizza Crust from this site and my family says my pizzas are better than any we get locally. I don't use the anchovy paste but that's the only change.

Great sauce!!! I did, however, make quite a few changes based on previous reviews; here's what I did. (BTW tripled the recipe) used brown sugar for honey and used 1/4 cup, for the anchovy paste (which I didn't have) I used Worcestershire sauce in the same amount, omitted the onion powder and added 1/4 cup dried minced onion cooked in a skillet with a can of drained (with liquid reserved) diced tomatoes in 1 T olive oil until soft, for herbs I used 2 tsp. each of oregano and crushed roasemary and basil (didn't have the marjoram), for the peppers I used 2 pinches of each. I also made the sauce the day before using a refrigerated until ready to use. It turned out great; nice and thick. Not runny at all. I'll be using for all my homemade pizzas from now on.

I would leave out the honey, red pepper flakes, and cayenne next time. I will probably try doubling the oregano as sometone suggested, too. It just didn't taste quite right, but I'm not sure why.

I liked this quite a bit and it was so easy! I did make it in the morning and used it that evening, so the flavors had time to combine well. When I had first made it I didn't care for it, but by the time I used it on my pizza it was great! I didn't add quite as much honey but I do think that it is an important element in cutting the acidity of the tomato paste, and heat. I often use anchovy fillets/paste in my pasta sauce---they don't taste "fishy" they just add a layer of flavor. To all those reluctant, I encourage you to try!
I made mini pizzas with my kids with this  sauce and they (ages 2 and 4) ate it all up :)
when I make it again I may add some chopped tomatoes into the sauce, just because I miss that "chunky" element---other than that, thought it was very good!

Such an easy sauce to make!  Very flavorful.  It was a bit too sweet for my taste, so next time I will probably try 1 Tbsp. honey instead of 2.  Other than that, the sauce will surely be a favorite around our house.

I admit to being a little disappointed after all the rave reviews.  The sauce is good but didn't live up to my expectations.  To me, the pepper overpowered all the other spices.  I think I would double the basil and oregano next time, or possibly use fresh instead of dry.

Fabulous! I hate to admit, I was a bit skeptical at first after reading some of the recent reviews, but this is GREAT! The honey absolutely doesn't over-sweeten the sauce. I used fresh basil and oregano from my herb garden and even added a splash of cabernet sauvignon left from last night! :-) This is definitely a keeper and for those who are skeptical, you must at least give it a try!

Also, I made mini pizzas with this sauce using mini pita breads. Just cut them in half, fill with the sauce and top with the cheese. My 17-month old toddler loved them!

Much too sweet and not enough spices for me.  I added more spices and would use almost no honey (or sugar) next time.  I prefer a much more savory pizza sauce than this turned out to be.

This was soooo good.  I did not add anchovy paste b/c I don't like it.  Also, I did not have any cayenne pepper or dried red pepper flakes on hand.  I thought the sauce was a little too sweet, so I will reduce the honey to 1 T. next time.  I made this with the Pizza Dough I recipe on this site.  I used all of the sauce for it, but I think 1/2 is enough.  I am giving this 5 stars b/c the taste was absolutely superb.  Thank you!!!

Pretty good, but not 5-star good. I'd definitely make it again, though. I couldn't find any anchovy paste at the grocery store across the street, so I didn't put that in, and I halved the honey. Honestly, I think all the people who are whining about the sweetness or spiciness are forgetting the part at the end of the recipe where it says "salt to taste." I thought the same thing of mine--both too sweet and too spicy--until I added the salt, and as I did, it morphed into perfect pizza sauce. Well done.

This has the potential to be a great pizza sauce but was just unbearably sweet.  I was planning on using it with a Hawaaiian pizza but once I tasted the finished sauce, I felt it would be way too sweet with pineapple so I made Easy Pizza Sauce III instead to go with the ham & pineapple.  I saved what I had made in hopes that someone can tell me how to undo the damage of the honey - tried to add more pepper but the taste is unbelievably sweet and then has a peppery kick at the end.  Not a keeper in my book.

Pretty good, but slightly too sweet for my taste. I think next time i'll do half of the honey and a little less water (i like my sauce a little thicker too) However the sweetness didn't keep me from having two large slices, Ugh so full!

We have been using this recipe for a few years now, thank you! We double it, keep a cup for today's sauce, and put 1 cup into each of 2 ziplocs to freeze for later.

DING DING DING WE HAVE A WINNER!
Next time I'm going to double it and divide it into thirds, because half of the recipe was too little for my pizza but all of it was too much. Or I could have just saved the excess for dipping the crusts in.

Excellent sauce, perfect as-is.  The anchovey paste is important as a flavor, and sauce does not taste fishy with the paste included.

YOWZA - I'll never buy the jarred pizza sauce again.  I've been eating this sauce by the spoonful and hope there's enough left over for the pizza that we'll make on the grill tonight.  The anchovy paste adds a nice subtle after-taste that anchovy-lovers will enjoy and anchovy-haters won't notice (don't mention there's anchovy paste in the recipe!!).  Pairing this with Jay's pizza crust recipe from this site.  Looking forward to a great Friday night pizza night!

I did not find this particular sauce to be that great. I would only try again if adding additional flavors. I didn't get any complaints from the kids so maybe it is just personal taste. It was not terrible though.

Good sauce.  I eliminated the red pepper flakes and cayenne because it was for the kids but the overall flavor was good. Next time, I'd add a little more salt to round out the flavor.  YUM!

Love this sauce! I like a spicy sauce so I love to bump up the spice with extra crushed red pepper.  If I don't want the sauce to be as sweet, I will cut back the honey.  It is so quick & easy! We use this everytime we make pizza at home.

Tonight I made homemade pizzas for the family.  I was looking for a new sauce to make a Hawaii tasting pizza.  And let me tell you, with nothing more than cubed ham, pineapples, and mozzarella cheese, this sauce worked flawlessly!  I doubled the recipe as I was making 2 pizzas.
As a normal everyday pizza sauce this is a little sweet (cut down on the amount of honey as others suggest) but for a pineapple pizza it simply can't be beat!

Very good sauce.  I am picky about my pizza sauce and this is really good.  I too, had only tomato sauce, so I used that and it made enough for two pizzas.  Very tasty, tangy sauce.  I'll be using this recipe again...thank you!

Oh, my god. Pizza sauce has always been sort of "meh" to me, but this was truly divine. I didn't have anchovy paste, so I substituted fish sauce, and I used fresh basil because I had some. Freakin' awesome. Really. Try this.

This is a great, and very easy sauce.  I made a double batch because we were doing "personal" pizzas for the first time and I had no idea how much to make.  Now I have a batch in the freezer for next weekend!!! I didn't change anything, I even bought anchovy paste for the first time ever. No fishy taste at all, so I will always use it.  After it was made, I did seperate a small amount and add some diced tomatoes to make a "marinara" style sauce to dip my calzone in.  FABULOUS!!!!

This recipes is absolutely amazing.  The anchovy paste is a must and shouldn't be opptional.  I added a teaspoon of Balsalmic Vinegar and it was perfect.  Everyone loved it.  My search for the best pizza sauce is over!

This was delish!  I used tomato sauce instead of water and paste since that was what I had on hand.  I used garlic powder, not minced garlic, and rosemary instead of marjoram.  I also used about a tsp for each seasoning, except for the peppers.  Other than that, kept it the same.  It was EXTREMLY good - so good that I don't think I'll be buying my pizza sauce again!

This is a great sauce!  I forgot to review it the first time I made it... but I remember thinking it was worth making again.  And after a couple taste tests I learned that it really is important to let it sit and blend.  Exquisite!

USE SAUCE not paste and water! I have made it both ways and it is far better with sauce. This is a great mix of seasonings even though I haven’t made it with the anchovy paste (double cayenne pepper for a hot and spicy sauce).  I recommend cooking over low heat to help the sauce blend together and you can cook down to desired thickness.

We made this sauce with only a couple of minor changes.  We doubled the recipe and I used crushed garlic that you find in a small jar.  I didn't have any minced garlic.  The other thing I did was I did not double the honey.  This recipe is a keeper!

Wow, great sauce!  I doubled it (everything except the honey, if not doubling the recipe I would 1/2 it) and it came out really great.
I had a jar of anchovies, rather than anchovy paste, so put a tsp of minced garlic in a pan, added 5-6 anchovies and cooked it over low heat, smashing the anchovies with a wooden spoon.  The anchovies don't make the sauce taste "fishy" at all, but add a lovely nutty undertone that's really great.

Very good sauce.  I didn't have any tomoato paste on hand, so I used a 15 oz. jar of sauce and omitted the water.  Otherwise, followed the recipe as stated, but did not just the anchovie paste.  This made enough for at least 2 large pizzas.

This is now my staple pizza sauce.  I also love it with Terri McCarell's Focaccia Bread. They might even both work hand in glove together as pizza crust and sauce.  Just add toppings and no more take out pizza!  Thanks for posting this recipe.  I also decreased the honey to 1 Tablespoon.  Just a bit too sweet for me. Otherwise perfect!

We thought this sauce was awesome!  We made it twice.  We are giving it a four simply because we reduced the honey to 2 tbs, the first time we made it it was waaayyyy to sweet.  We're Chicagoans so great pizza is everywhere - this is a keeper!

This is a very tasty and easy sauce to make.  I think it may be a little sweet for some people but I like it that way.  It definately doesn't taste like any sauce from a pizza delivery restaurant.  I have made this several times and I only wish I could find a good crust to put it on.  I think I would enjoy it so much more!

VERY good!  I would either cut back or omit the anchovy paste, personal taste...if you're unsure, add a bit at a time & taste.

This was good but not exquisite...it was too spicy and I only used maybe a teaspoon of honey and that was sweet enough, couldn't imagine using what the recipe states, unless you like really sweet pizza sauce.

I chose 2 different pizza sauces to make for this weekends pizza.  My family like this one quite well.  I didn't have anchovy paste so I didn't use it.  No need by but jarred sauce anymore!

This sauce was unbelievable.  Extremely easy, and great depth of flavor, and healthy too.  I omitted the anchovies, used a pinch of sage and time in lieu of the marjoram, and added a bit of red wine, it was perfect!  Never thought I'd make a pizza where the sauce was the star ingredient, but that should just teach me never to say never...

This pizza sauce was a hit on New Years Eve!!!  My husband and his family gave it raving reviews saying it was the best homemade pizza they had ever tasted!!  It was a bit on the sweet side (which is what I like)so next time I will tone it down just a bit.

This is a great recipe!  I will never buy pizza sauce again - and will probably make pizza at home versus ordering out more often now too!  I didn't have time to make my own crust - I will do that next time, but this sauce was so easy to make and tasted delicious.

Really great pizza sauce. I made this with Jay's signature pizza crust and they went really well together. I halved the honey and it was the perfect amount of sweetness. I also doubled the recipe because the pizza crust recipe makes enough for 2 pizza's so I wanted enough. Well, doubling the sauce gave me enough to make 2 large pizza's, and 2 large stomboli's the next night w/ a small amount of sauce still left over.

I didn't find this 'exquisite' at all, in fact it tasted like a somewhat bland pasta sauce. I even made this recipe twice because I thought I did something wrong the first time. I think I'll keep looking for a pizza sauce recipe, sorry.  :(

This is pretty good pizza sauce.  I omitted the anchovy paste and cut the honey down to 1 tbs, and I still thought it was still too sweet and had a definite honey flavor.  Next time I'll try just a teaspoon or substitute sugar.

Yum! I loved this recipe. Next time I'll double it as it didn't make quite enough sauce for my crust recipe. I like a lot of sauce on my pizza, especially when it's this good.

This is fantastic sauce!  I took the advice of other reviewers and cut the amount of honey in half.  This might be a little spicy for children, but I liked the little kick that the cayenne gave. I substituted 5 anchovies, finely chopped, for the anchovy paste.

I made this recipes a week ago for the first time and I've already made it 2x. I used it for lasagna tonight with ground beef and it was great. I reduce the honey to 1 tbsp. and it's still a little too sweet for my taste but my family thinks it's perfect. If you don't like sweet sauce I would do without the honey.

Our family has a love/hate relationship with this recipe.  I think it's a great base recipe, but we've tweaked the ingredients to suit our family's taste, so that's why I give it four stars.  We didn't care for it 'as is', but I've made this many, many times and only recently found the right balance to suit my family's taste buds.  I still use all the ingredients, I've just tweaked the amount of everything.  I also make this in the morning and let it sit all day in the fridge to allow more time for the flavors to blend.  We make this along with Jay's Signature Crust (delicious).

I followed other reviewers suggestions and only used half the honey and it was still a bit sweet for my taste.  It was a bit spicy too, but not overly.

This recipe made enough for 3 x pizzas, so I packaged the remaining sauce into  two ziplock bags and  froze it for another day.  Delicious!

The sauce wasn't bad.  I omitted the anchovy paste and the honey.  It still came out very sweet, I had to add a bit more salt to cut the sweetness.  It was pretty thick because of the cheese, but wasn't bad.  I am going to keep looking for another recipe, but in the meantime I'll continue to play with the ingredients on this one to try and get it more to my liking.

Good sauce. I do agree with others that the honey needs to be reduced, maybe halved. I also doubled the red pepper flakes and the garlic just out of love for both.

I should have read the reviews first.  The sauce was way too sweet.  I'll make it again and cut back on the honey and cayenne pepper as the reviewers suggested.

Sweet and chock full of herbs.  The sauce did come out a little runny, but I may have added too much water.

The only thing keeping this recipe from five stars, is that it is too much honey. I cut it in half, but next time I'll probably quarter it. Otherwise, it's a great recipe and a good base for any tweaking you may like to do. A Keeper!

Exquisite indeed!  I used tomato paste w/ tomato pesto, left out the anchovy and substituted brown sugar for honey.  This was incredible!  The red pepper really gives it a nice kick (if you don't like that "zing", definitely reduce to just a pinch.)  I will never buy bottled pizza sauce again.. goes perfectly with Jay's Signature Crust!

Yummy & easy!!! My kind of recipe. I think I will omit the cayenne next time, as my little one could detect the slight heat! I did not think the 2 T. honey was too much. Also, omitted the anchovy. Used a pizza crust from Central Market's bakery, mozzarella, & Grana Padano. Used about half the sauce for one pizza. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is as great sauce to use with Jay's Signature Pizza Crust from this site. I cut back on the honey and added only 1 Tbsp. and omitted the cayenne pepper.

This sauce was easy to make.  I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand, like marjoram, anchovy paste, and cayenne pepper, but it still tasted good.  The crushed red pepper gave it a nice little spice.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

SO SO Good!  We live in the chicago suburbs so we like our pizza and this did not disappoint us.  I made it with the Pizza Dough III and it turned out great. My husband likes extra sauce so it was important that the sauce wasn't bland, and the first words after his first bite was "Wow, this is good."
Thanks for sharing!

I didn't use the anchovy paste or add salt. I fried up a little red pepper and red onion in olive oil and added to the sauce.

The recipe is a good start, but I can see that there are several things that need to be changed.  I made stromboli with it and felt like I was eating spaghetti sauce rather than pizza sauce.  Will probably drastically reduce, if not omit, both the parmesan and the cayenne.

I made this last night and my boyfriend absolutely loved it. He said he liked it better than jar sauce. I ommited the anchovy paste and cayenne pepper as i didn't have either. I also used Jay's Signature Pizza Crust to go along with this sauce. Yum.

There is so much happening in each bite with this sauce! The peppers add a great kick, while the honey keeps it sweet. You'll be tempted to forget about the other toppings on your pizza, and just eat it with this sauce!

Fabulous!  I made enough for 8 pizzas - used some on the pizza for dinner that night, gave one away, and froze the remaining 6 *servings* in individual freezer bags for a quick fix on hectic nights!  Our kids (9 and 6) LOVED the pizza!

If I make it again I will cut down on the spices, I have never had a hot pizza sauce… I used corn syrup because I had no honey and I added more then called for, until the bitterness from the tomato paste was gone.

I've never made homemade pizza sauce before, but this was the best one I ever made, lol!  I don't have anything to compare it to, but I know we loved it and plan on using it again.

I didnt have any anchovy paste, so i omitted that. It was really good, kind of spicy. I would leave out all the spices, except for a 1/8 of ground black pepper. Overall, very nice. I will use this again

I doubled the recipe as it didn't make a whole lot of sauce; figured I could freeze it if I had too much.  Reduced the honey to 2tsp (for the double recipe), per other reviewers' comments on sauce being too sweet.  Used all of the cayenne, but no pepper flakes in an effort to help balance the heat a bit.  Added 2tsp Italian seasoning.  Thanks for the great recipe, Angie!

Overall, a good recipe. It was quick, easy, and delicious. Not too overwhelming, but still flavorful. I didn't give it five stars because it didn't keep very long in the fridge.It's not a recipe that you could can or freeze. Thanks for the recipe.

I was making my first attempt at Calzones and I needed some sauce. I used this because it was tomato paste based instead of tomato sauce based and I only had paste. This was good but I have another (sauce based) recipe that I use for pizza sauce. I actually like that better. Mine is easier to make and is more like traditional “Pizza Hut” or “Pizza Quick” in the jar.  This recipe was different tasting but I was making Calzones and not really pizza. I made it (sans anchovy paste)  to a tee except I didn’t have any marjoram. I deducted one star because even after I let it set the flavors didn't blend as seamlessly as I had hoped. Since I made it and knew what was in it I could distinctly taste the honey and the hot pepper. If you let it chill in the fridge it is also very thick. Nice for spereading on the pizza or Calzone crust but I added additional water to thin it for dipping sauce for my Calzones. I will probably make this again but from now on (if my Calzones become a regular) I’ll file this under Calzone Sauce.

This sauce was really easy and very flavourful, even without the anchovy paste and onion powder (didn't have any). The recipe makes way more than enough sauce for one pizza -- I ended up using about half the sauce to fill two large calzones. 
I often freeze whatever sauce is left over in zip-top bags. The sauce freezes well, and defrosts in just a few minutes under warm running water.

Very good recipe! I left out the anchovy paste and red pepper flakes, also used garlic powder insted of minced garlic. Tasted before putting on pizza dough and thought it was a bit too sweet. After the pizza was cooked, and with all of the flavors together it was perfect!

We use this all the time... I cut down on the honey and don't use anchovies.  I printed this out on magnetic sheets and keep it on my fridge door so it's handy when we make pizza.  I use it along with Jay's signature pizza crust.

This is truly EXQUISITE!  Great name for a great sauce.  I love it and so does my family...even my 2 and 3 year olds.  Everyone I have served pizza to with this sauce on it tells me how great it is.  Thanks for an EXCELLENT recipe!  I haven't tried it with the anchovie paste but that's only because I haven't found it yet in any of my local supermarkets.  I always add a lot more garlic since we LOVE garlic!  You'll not be disappointed with this sauce!

Very good pizza sauce.  I did make just a few changes.  I did not have any honey on hand so I used 1 tablespoon of sugar instead.  I also used garlic poweder instead of minced garlic and I used dried minced onions instead of onion powder.  I also did not use the anchovy paste.  Overall, the sauce was very good.  I will definelty be making this pizza sauce often.

This was too sweet for us, and WAY too peppery for me.  I didn't even use all the pepper called for.  Every bite had a pepper afterbite.  I loved the fact that it was all pantry ingredients and that I didn't have to cook it.  A great place to start.

Really good!  I didn't have paste so I used an 8 oz can of tomato sauce instead of paste and water, which was fine.  I used a T of splenda instead of the honey.  Used a spice mixture instead of all the individual ones plus a few healthy pinches of cayenne.  Excellent on the whole wheat crust that many others used.

This sauce is wonderful!  Couldn't believe how flavorful it was.  I will definitely reduce the honey next time though.  For those of you who don't like spicy, I eliminated the red pepper and cayenne pepper (and also those anchovies!) and it was still incredible.  Thanks Angie!

This is a very good sauce, but not the best I have ever had.  Might cut down on the cyanne next time.

I use this sauce a lot. I reduced honey to 1/4 teaspoon.
Very good pizza sauce.

I made this along with the Amazing Whole Wheat Pizza Crust, and it was terrific!  I am not much of a baker but am trying to learn, and my pizza turned out great -- 1st time!  This sauce couldn't have been easier to make, and it was very flavorful.  I made it exactly according to the recipe.  Will make again!

This pizza sauce is full of flavor.  The only thing I changed (as others suggested) was adding less honey.  I actually will just eliminate it completely next time I make it.  A little spicy for the little ones (ages 3&4) but over all it was a great recipe.  I will make it again.

I've tried several pizza sauces and didn't care for any of them. Then I ran across this recipe and we loved it! I cut the Parmesan cheese to 1T and left out the anchovy paste and it turned out delicious. It is easy to make and makes enough for two good size pizzas. I can stop looking for a good pizza sauce recipe. Thanks Angie!

My family uses this recipe all the time and it is great.  I do only add 1 table spoon of honey, as we like it better that way.  Other than that...it is perfect!  I usually double the recipe and freeze whatever is leftover so our next "pizza night" is even simpler!

This was really, really good!  I left out the cheese (hubby doesn't like it), but otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  It was one of the best and easiest pizza sauces I've ever made.

This is a great sauce!  The only thing I will do differently next time is a little less parm or I'll try using fresh instead.  I found it to be a bit much, other than that...AWESOME!!!

Good, but I prefer a more simple sauce. My husband and I lived in northern Italy for several years and the pizza sauces in that region are very simple with very few ingredients. Not bad if you like a spicy sauce.

Not a bad sauce, but I only used the cayenne with no red pepper and it was still a little too spicy. I just don't care for spicy pizza.
Also I cut the honey in half, but next time I might try sugar and no anchovy paste. I love anchovies, but this had a sort of fishy after taste.
I think I used a little too much sauce on the pizza, I prefer less and that might make a bit of difference in taste too.
Overall, it was still pretty good.

It lives up to its name.  I made exactly like the recipe.  The italian seasoning I had included oregano, basil and marjoram, so that saved a little time.  I used this on flour tortillas and baked on a pizza stone, so it turned out like a super-thin crust pizza.

My friends and I decided to make pizza instead of calling for delivery, and we used this sauce.  Several of my friends liked it, but I found it to be too spicy.  In fact, I could barely enjoy our pizza because this sauce was so spicy.

This recipe is getting closer to the restuarant style I am looking for, but it was a little "tomato-ee" for me.  Maybe I just spread it too thick.

Very good pizza sauce and very simple to make. It has a bit of a 'zing' to it.  The hubby really liked it. I added all of the honey called for but I would definitely reduce the amount next time, as recommended by other reviewers.

This sauce is better then any pizzaria! I did take the recommendation of others and only used 1 tbsp of honey.  It's sweet and spicy! Have made this twice with the Jay's signature pizza crust. Everyone should try this sauce.

So many people can't be wrong.  This was fantastic.  I added 1/2 the honey (as suggested by many reviews) and it turned out perfect.  Honestly, this is the best pizza sauce I've ever tasted.

Made this last night with the Bread Machine Calzone and it was fabulous! This sauce is definitely on the sweet side which is what we like but if you like spicy don't add the honey.I will be making this often.

Very Good "from Scratch" sauce - I used brown sugar as I had no honey, and it was a tad too sweet for us, but very good taste and made more than enough for one pizza.

this sauce is excellent!  hubby raved about it.  also used it to make barbecue chicken pizza, mixing this sauce with an almost equal part barbecue sauce as the base for the pizza.

Excellent pizza sauce!!  I exclude the cayenne and red pepper flakes for my 2 year old.  I've been using this for about a year now.  It's our favorite Friday night dinner.

Pretty good sauce and easy to make. I added more cayenne and red pepper for a little extra kick, cut back on the honey and sprinkled on a little garlic salt for good measure. It was great.

What a good recipe!  I'd been looking for a pizza sauce that didn't have the oil and sugar in it, but still tasted good: this is it.  And it's so easy to make - I'll be using it again and again.

What terrific sauce! We didn't have the time to let the flavors stew together and we left out the anchovies, but it was still just amazing. No need to buy Ragu anymore! Thanks for the great recipe--I'm not one to want my pizza "heavy on the sauce," but this mix changes my mind!

I left out the honey because I don't care for a sweet sauce and used an italian seasoning blend that had nearly all the spices required in it. This was much better than a bottled or canned sauce. I'll use this as my recipe or pizza sauce from now on.

Good, easy to make pizza sauce. I halved the honey because I don't like my sauce too sweet, and left out the anchovy paste.

I only gave this three stars because my ten year old liked it.  I hated it.  It was sweet, where I prefer a tangy sauce.  I made it a couple hours ahead to let the spices blend and used it on a ready made crust.  I will try it once more this time with a little more spice and no honey.

This was great - made it for dinner with Jay's Signature Pizza Crust recipe from this site. don't like anchovies, so left them out, and only had oregano so used extra instead of the other herbs. also only had black pepper so just used that and it was still amazing! i had a little left over which i used a dip for doughballs made from the leftover dough. my only complaint was that i had no idea how much salt to add - i used about a teaspoon, which seemed fine. otherwise, great recipe that i will definitely use again!

This is wonderfull!!  I have never liked any of the pizza sauce recipes I have tried in the past but this one will ensure I never use pre-made again.  I did use a 15 oz can of tomato sauce rather than the paste and water, decreased the honey and cayenne a bit and omitted the anchovy paste to our taste.  This is the first recipe I have tried from this site and am trying another tonight!

I loved this recipe because I used it with 
"Amazing Whole Wheat Pizza Dough" (on this site) which made it healthier than normal crust; but this sauce added that extra flavor so it wasn't bland. I revised this recipe by halving the honey, omitting the anchovy paste, and doubling the oregano and basil to make up for the fact that I do not have majoram on hand. I also let it sit overnight, though one pizza was made a few hours after I made the sauce and it was also fantastic. This recipe made enough for two 12 inch pizzas, and I like a fair amount of sauce. I just layered the sauce, some fresh baby spinach leaves and mozzarella and parmesan cheeses on top and shook some more dried oregano before baking as I usually do. One final difference is that I didn't use red pepper flakes in the sauce because I like to shake them on my pizza once it comes out of the oven. Impressed everyone, thanks for the great recipe!

There is no reason for me to learn how to make any other tomato pizza sauce, because this one's perfect. I threw a few anchovy filets in the food processor rather than buying anchovy paste, which isn't as good anyway.

Very tasty, but way too sweet.  I wish I had read the reviews prior to making the sauce.  I will make this again, but will use only 1/2 of the honey.  You could actually taste the honey in the sauce after the pizza was baked, and this way overpowering.  Easy to prepare, and fun for kids to help measure all of the ingredients.  I would have rated this 4 stars, but my husband won't eat the leftovers because it is too sweet!

Great - easy recipe. Thanks.
I did skip the red pepper and anchovy paste - for the kids...and it was still great. One thing this can't live without is the cheese, don't skip that!

This is the best pizza sauce recipe I have ever made.  It's not sweet and it has a little kick to it.  My four children like it better than carry out pizza.  It's great on top of "Jay's Signature Pizza Crust".

This is fabulous - my husband makes it (minus the anchovy paste) and uses it on "Jay's Signature Pizza Crust."  It's very easy, an no matter how pressed for time I would never use store-bought pizza sauce again.

This sauce was very simple to make, once I had all the ingredients.  It had a very good flavor to it.  The only thing I didn't add to it was the anchovy paste.  I'm not sure if that would have made it better.  But, this sauce was very good otherwise.

Very good. I tried using the diced tomato (others suggestion) since we don't like an overpowering tomato taste. Next time I'll drain the liquid as it was runny or use tomato paste.

This is definitely exquisite pizza sauce!!!  I did only half of the honey and it turned out perfect!!  Will absolutely use again!  Just be careful not to burn your pizza crust so that the burned taste doesn't overpower your sauce!!  Made that mistake first time.  Best pizza sauce ever!!

I used 12 ounces of crushed tomatoes in place of the tomato paste and water. I also used only half of the honey. It was a fantastic sauce.

Very good, but a little sweet.  It has a wonderful taste and the mixture of the herbs makes it taste authentic.  We used Jay's Signature Crust with it which also has honey in it, so we left out half of the honey in this recipe the 2nd time and we liked it better that way.   THANKS ANGIE!

This is better than store bought pizza sauce. The flavors go great together. It's a little too sweet as is. We like better with a little less honey. I would suggest starting out with part of the honey and tasting it. You always add more if you like your sauce sweet.

Yum!  This was a very good sauce with a "bite". The sweetness put me off a little, so next time I will use 1/2 the honey, but the cayenne and red pepper flakes give the sauce a nice kick that my husband really liked.  Definitely give the flavors time to mix - overnight in the fridge is probably best.  I will definitely use this again!

This sauce was really good. I didn't add the anchovy paste or salt, and I cut the honey down to 1T. I also used 2/3 c minced onion instead of the onion powder and simmered it for 20 min. This is definately my new favorite pizza sauce. Wont be buying the jar stuff anymore!

My husband and I were not too impressed by this recipe.  He thought that this sauce was too sweet, while I like sweet sauces and thought it was too spicy.  He gave it one star and I gave it three, so that's why it's a two.  Anyway, I did not add the anchovy paste (I'm a vegetarian) and we did not have any red peper flakes (thank goodness or I probably wouldn't have been able to eat this at all).  I also tasted this right after I made it and thought it was way too strong, so mine sat and simmered for a good five hours (and some salt was added) before going on the pizza. That didn't help us with the flavor.  I'll keep looking for that perfect homemade pizza sauce.

This is the absolute best pizza sauce I have ever had, anywhere.  And I should know, being an incessantly-hungry college student :o)Changes: no anchovy paste or marjoram (didn't have 'em on hand), used roasted garlic flavored Italian paste, used  about 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes.  This is THE BEST if you put it atop fresh, store-bought pizza dough, then add a nice sprinkling of minced garlic (I used 5 cloves!), and a combination of Mozzarella and sharp Cheddar cheese.  YUM!

This sauce had an odd flavor.  I never tasted
a take out pizza with this flavor.  Scratched

I replaced the tomatoe paste and water with 12 oz of canned tomatoes. I chopped the tomatoes, mix the ingredients and then simmered it for 30 mins. I also reduced the honey to only 1 tbl. spoon because I thought 2 tbs was too much for canned tomatoes. The result was fantastic, I've used the same recipe a 3rd time today.

This is a great sauce.  I really enjoy the combination of sweet and hot.  I make this sauce, then pair it with the Deep Dish Pizza Dough recipe, spread out on a large cookie sheet.  Very good recipe that I will continue to make over and over.

This sauce is unlike anything I've had before. I didn't add anchovie paste and I didn't use honey, I couldn't imagine honey in sauce for pizza, so I used 1 1/2 tsp. sugar. I let sit for about 2 hrs. before using. It had a good flavor but a different consistancy than most sauces.Rather thick. If you like thick spicey sauces,try this one. I think you'll enjoy it. Thanks Angie!

I used everything but the onion powder,cayenne pepper, dried red pepper flakes and only used half the honey.  Me, my husband, and my son thought it was good. It is still sweet but that is good news for us we like our sauce a little sweet.  I will use this recipe again.

I followed the recipe with the exception of the anchovy paste, and was not pleased with it.  I thought the sauce overwhelmed the pizza - too many flavors.

Good and easy. I used bottled hot sauce and mixed Italian herbs. 1/2 the honey. Nobody went wild over it, but nobody complained either, so I know it was good.

I liked it at first: it was a change from my usual (canned) sauce. However, I froze the remaining sauce (as I always do with the canned) and it just became horrendously garlicy and thick. Will not make it again.

I think this recipe is fine as is. I wouldn't change the amount of honey. Once you bake it onto a pizza and it combines with the other flavors, I think it's great. I use pita bread as crusts.

I loved it!  This is the easiest sauce I've ever made, and tastes even better than fresh.  I think it's because the paste is concentrated, so you get a more potent tomato flavor.

This sauce is the best I've found. I loved the taste combination of sweet and spicy. To me, both were slight, but added a great taste combination. Was perfect on Jay's pizza crust.

I trippled this recipe and made 3 pizza's.  I didn't add any cayenne and only 1/8 tsp. red pepper flakes to the entire batch.  Everyone loved this!  I used this with 'Joe's' pizza crust and also as a pizza using 'Italian Herbed Bread'.  Both recipes are found on this website.  There is no need for me to search for a better pizza sauce.  This is it!

THIS IS THE BEST SAUCE! We don't like overly sweet sauce so I only use about 3/4 of a TBL. of the honey. Sometimes it turns out thicker than others, so I might add a little more water to thin it out which in turn stretches it out more. But I've looked long & hard for a good pizza sauce & want to thank you so much for submitting this!

I was excited about this after reading the reviews.  It smelled wonderful.  It wasn't bad, but I'm going to keep looking for a better recipe.

Wonderful!!  It had just the taste I was looking for.  I omitted the anchovy paste and red pepper flakes but did add a pinch of cayenne to liven it up a bit.  I mixed it up then realized I didn't have enough yeast to make a pizza crust so the sauce sat in the fridge overnight...but I think that just made the flavors blend even more.  I might add a bit of water to thin it just a bit, but other than that, I thing it's terrific.  Thanks for sharing!

The sauce was very good and very easy!  Husband loved it and so did my son and his friend.  Next time I will puree it and make it smoother.  Not too spicy for us, but I can see how some kids would think it too spicy...just reduce or omit pepper and cayenne.  Not too sweet.

I agree that it was a little too sweet.  I made it twice with the second time using a little less than 1 Tablespoon and it turned out great.  Wonderful recipe!!!

This, topping Jay's Signature Pizza Crust, has become a favorite with my family.  My husband found it to be a bit spicy but he adjusted.  Everyone else raves about it.

I LOVE this sauce recipe.  It is super cheap and easy to make and it tastes great.  I really like that you don't have to simmer it down at all.  I did alter the recipe by cutting the honey down to one TBSP and since I have little ones, I also did NOT add the cayenne & red pepper flakes at all and cut the black pepper to 1/8 tsp.  I actually easily make one X-large pizza and one small pizza with this recipe.  It's the best one I've ever come across - I doubt I'll ever try another.

VERY Good!  This was the easiest and tastiest Pizza Sauce I have ever tried.  In fact it is the only recipe I will use in the future .... with one slight change.  I only used 1/2 of the honey and I added 1/2 cup water and let simmer on the stove for 30 minutes!  Make sure to stir while simmering.

Great pizza sauce.  I make homemade pizza every Friday night for our family and I will use this sauce from now on.  It's inexpensive to make and I love the fact that you have so many flavors without having to simmer it!  It's easy to tweak the spices, too!

Delicious! But... I did not use the anchovie paste. I used only one tablespoon of honey, and my husband still thought it was sweet. Next time I will use half a tablespoon. I used "Jay's Signature Pizza Crust" recipe. Be careful with the measurement of pepper. I think mine was a little bit too spicy, next time I will cut down on the pepper too. This recipe was enough to cover Jay's crust.

This is a great sauce but is too sweet.  I used 1 Tbl spoon of honey and may use even less next time.  I added more garlic because we love garlic.  This sauce is yummy!

I didn't add the anchovy paste, and I used garlic powder instead of garlic(didn't have any). It tasted great to me!

This sauce was okay - but - it was way to sweet for my taste - If I were to use this recipe again I would cut way down on the honey.  I am sure some people like the sweetness but it didnt work for my family.  RR

This is a fantastic pizza sauce. I did alter the ingredients alittle to our tastes though. It is the only pizza sauce our family uses now. Thanks for the great recipe. Very flavorful.

Wow!!!  I made this on a whim, I had all the ingrediants and I could not believe how quick it took to put together and that I didn't have to pre-cook it.  To top it off it is absolutely phenominal, much better than the stuff I usually buy.  This will definately be a repeat!  Thank you!!!  *omitted the anchovy paste, didn't have it*

What a wonderful find, this sauce is the best!! I will never get store bought again! I doubled the recipe and froze some for future use! I did omit the anchovy paste, kept the honey as in the recipe, I was a little leary after reading other reviews! However, the sweetness level was perfect! Made with Jay's signature crust, this pizza was to die for!! Thank you for a great find!

wouldn't use the honey next time, because it was too sweet.  I halved the honey, and I thought it was still too sweet, but still a very good pizza sauce recipe.  Thanks!

This sauce was so delicious!  I used it with Jay's Signature Pizza Crust and everyone loved it!  I only used 1 tablespoon of honey as others suggested.  This was so quick and easy.  I made it Friday night after work.  I will be making this again and again.  Thanks!

The texture was very good but it was too sweet for my taste.  I'll have to adjust that in the future.  The red pepper flakes give it a kick that I really liked.  My fourteen year old sister helped me make it, so it wasn't too difficult, but she didn't care for it much.  She thought it was too hot (spicy).
