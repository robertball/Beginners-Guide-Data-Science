A nice way to use up turkey leftovers.  I made one pot pie.  I admit that I didn't measure everything precisely but I don't think there would be enough filling here for 2 pot pies.  I used fresh carrots, instead of canned.  I suggest having extra gravy to serve with the pot pie.  A bit of cranberry sauce on the side was really nice.

This is a very good recipe for leftovers.  I found that this recipe only makes one 9 inch pie.  I had 2 tablespoons of mashed potatoes, 1 quarter cup of stuffing, 1 quarter cup of green bean casserole  that I  added to the other ingredients instead of throwing them away. The bacon adds a delicious flavor!  We enjoyed this!

Absolutely amazing! The only thing I found was that it was only enough filling for one full pot pie rather than two smaller ones.. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing! Great use for leftovers!

Good and easy! I only had one double pie shell, and most of the reviewers said it wasn’t enough for two pies, so I put it all in one without reducing the recipe. I was worried it would leak out as it was heaped up pretty high, but I put some turkey stuffing inside around the edges in the hopes it would help prevent leaks. Can’t say for sure if it worked, but it turned out leak-free and beautiful. I added an additional 1/2 cup gravy according to reviewers. Also I don’t think it needed as much extra seasoning, maybe half the amount would have been perfect.

I doubled this recipe as I had quite a lot of leftover turkey. Followed recipe as is except I used 1 pack of real bacon fried crispy and crumbled in place of the faken bits. I used raw carrots and frozen vegetables which I cooked in the microwave for about 5 minutes first. Good flavour however it seems pretty runny.

This recipe works very well with rottiserie chicken leftovers, also. I use a can of veg-all and instead of piecrust, I lay pillsbury buttermilk bisquits on top of casserole. Rediculously easy to make and very tasty.

Next time I will use a 1/2 cup more gravy. Little dry but still very tasty. Also good thing I always watch my stuff cooking. I checked on them and at 25 min they were done. If I left it in there for the required time it would have been burnt.

I will definitely make this again.  It was easy and fast to prepare. The only complaint is that when I cut it to serve, it fell apart.  I did wait 10 minutes after taking it out of the oven before cutting into it, but that didn't seem to help.  The taste was good, I might try adding some fresh garlic next time.

I made some modifications.  Did not have bacon so used a small amount of Campbells Bacon soup (undiluted) instead. Added a can of cream of chicken soup, undiluted. Did not add additional spices listed in the  recipe because my turkey already had some spice.  Added peas & carrots mixture from T-day dinner that was leftover.  Other than these modifications, followed the rest of the recipe. Husband raved about this. To be honest, he LOVES pot pies. I might try adding more spice the next time.

This is super easy.  The ingredients are just the right amount for ONE pie, deep dish.  I was generous with the gravy.  This will be a fun recipe to play with.  I think chicken gravy would be better instead of turkey gravy.

I made this with leftover cooked turkey that had been in the freezer for a year and it turned out incredible! Several guests who tried it came back for seconds with plenty of compliments. I'm going to make it again soon!
