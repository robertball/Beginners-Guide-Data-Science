I didn't bother to add ice (the berries were frozen which eliminated the need for ice) and I did not add the honey. My banana was plenty ripe which made the smoothie naturally sweet without having to add honey or extra sugar. DELICIOUS and very filling. The boys and I really enjoyed this smoothie. I might try to freeze this during the summer to make quick yogurt pops. I think this would make a great cool summer treat.

I enjoyed this smoothie. The only things I did not add was the ice cubes and honey. I added a little pineapple to make it sweeter. I thought it was a little bitter. I did think it was a little seedy, but it also could of been my blender. I think its about to give out on me. I will make this smoothie again and soon!

I made this with a friend, minus the cherries, and it was delicious! We each had 2 cups. Drank them out of fun wine glasses & had a great time. Thanks!

So refreshing and delicious! I used fresh squeezed orange juice, fat free plain yogurt instead of vanilla and protein supplement instead of honey. Also, I didn't have cherries, so I used frozen raspberries instead.

Great flavor and very refreshing!  I used frozen banana, blueberries and cherries, and fresh strawberries, plain yogurt and added about 1/2 tsp vanilla extract.  I probably used less orange juice, as I was leery of the citrus flavor, but then added a splash of skim milk to get the right texture.  I also skipped the ice, as most of my fruit was frozen so I didn't think I needed it, and sweetened to taste with agave nectar.  I had frozen fresh cherries specifically to try in a smoothie, and this recipe is a perfect example of how to use them that way!  Thanks for sharing!

It was good. I used blackberries and strawberries instead of blueberries and cherries. I may add a little splenda next time or maybe more honey because it was a little bitter.

This had a good flavor, but a couple of points.  One, it was a bit on the tart side, and therefore I don't really consider the honey optional.  I'm not sure more honey would help.  It seems to need more or less of... something else, don't know what.  I notice many leaving out the cherries.  The bigger problem is that it's hard to mix.  The ice is needed since there's very little liquid.  As to the person with the old blender - not sure it's the blender - there just isn't a lot of liquid to mix the fruit smooth.  I managed, and the ice was pure liquid by time I was done, but it's definitely easy getting it smooth with more liquid.

Wow - this definitely is "Simple" and has all the flavors of Summer! I cut the recipe in half and froze my banana along with the strawberries and blueberries and used didn't bother freezing my fresh cherries. I used a little less OJ and some fat free vanilla yogurt. I cut back a bit on the ice adding a little skim milk and a bit of sugar. Overall, great for breakfast.

I'd say unless you can find really sweet berries, the orange juice and the berries make it too sour. the second time i used less strawberries and used latte instead of orange juice, and it came out a lot better! ice is indispensible in this recipe cuz it really counts as water in this, or else the smoothie is too dry.

OMG these were amazing! I changed the recipe a bit because I didn't have cherries and I didn't have any OJ made. For the berries I had a bag of frozen mixed berries, strawberries, raspberries, black berries and blue berries I just used that, it equaled 2 cups. Then in stead of OJ I just peeled and sectioned an orange. I also added about 1/2 cup of heavy cream to add a little liquid. It came out exquisitely! Next time I make this recipe I will add some protein powder for additional nutrition, I'd like to see how it tastes with the Honey and probably some juice instead of the heavy cream. I just happened to have that and not juice in my fridge so I used it.

I modified this recipe to what I had on hand. I used 1 C Light Vanilla Yogurt, 1 banana, 1 clementine, a few marachino cherries, frozen strawberries (from the garden thawed)& added some of the juice, sugar free honey, and about 8 ice cubes. Blended until smooth. This tasted great, not too sweet and not bitter.  Can't wait to get some fresh blueberries to try with it. CareBear

This is one I've been wanting to make for quite awhile, always waiting until I had fresh or frozen cherries at hand.  I still didn't, but I made this anyway, cherry juice and cherry yogurt fillling in for the always absent real thing.  Also, this time, while I did have frozen bananas in the freezer,  the strawberries and blueberries I used were fresh and cold, but not frozen.  The result was interesting and we both approved - the smoothie was lighter, not nearly as thick.  Very refreshing!  With this big mix of fruits compared to the smaller amounts of orange juice and yogurt, this was intensely fruity too.  Great as is, I'm sure, but I added a little extra honey.  This is one of the better smoothies I've made.

I thought this tasted good, but I had a couple issues with it. I cut the recipe in half. The cherry taste, I thought was pronounced, which I liked. The only change I made was using a small splash of agave syrup for the honey. However, with the little amount of liquid, my strong mixer with all of that frozen fruit was not going to budge. To get it to blend, I ended up using milk for the additional liquid. I added about 3/4 of a cup for half the recipe. I am glad I used milk instead of additional oj, because I found this to be quite a bit too sweet. I did like that it used a variety of fruit though. I may try it again and modify it to taste, possibly reducing the vanilla yogurt, to see if that makes it a little less sweet tasting.

It came out really good! But I used plain tillamook yogert instead of the vanilla yogert and I also didn’t use cherries but I used strawberries, blueberries, and bannanas! And added ALOT of ice to it so it becomes like how I imagine smoothies to be like!

My banana was also frozen, so there was no need to add ice. I didn'use the cherries but added frozen raspberries, 1 scoop of protein powder and used plain Greek yogurt. This came out VERY thick (blender worked extra hard), so I added additional orange juice and some milk thin it out a bit. (I'm actually eating the first serving  with a spoon right now!) Plenty sweet - no addt'l sweetener needed. It's delicious, refreshing and healthy. Will make again. UPDATE 5/9/16: Today I added a 3.5 oz bottle of vanilla Kefir probiotic to the remaining smoothie.  Yum and even healthier!

Forgot to add the honey but didn't miss it. I used frozen raspberries instead of cherries and low fat vanilla yogurt. No ice required since all the fruit, including the banana, were already frozen.  Excellent. Perfect for hot summer afternoon.
