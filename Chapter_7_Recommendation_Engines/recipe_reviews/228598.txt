Tried this recipe tonight. Had to sub the Italian panko with lemon pepper panko and the parm cheese with cheddar - all we had on hand. Everyone loved it. The pasta however...bombed. After originally tasting it (no flavor, just straight up basil in my opinion), we added some cheddar cheese, salt and pepper to it. Helped it some but I would not eat it again (my boys liked it alright but the hubby and I said no.) I'd cook the chicken again. The spare sauce will be stored, not put on pasta.

I used butter buds instead of butter to dredge the chicken but otherwise followed the recipe. The sauce is quite tasty. I did find the chicken to be very anemic looking after the stated baking time so I broiled it for a few minutes to get it browned.. since we eat with our eyes first

My family loved this recipe! We marinated the chicken in the sauce for 30 minutes before cooking and used cooking spray on the panko crumbs to increase crunch. This recipe was eaten well my my kids, indulged by me and in-hailed by my husband. Thank you for a great recipe. Will make again.

This was made tonight with one package of Costco's chicken and half the other ingredients.  I had some Progresso Lemon Pepper Panko crumbs from a while back, and since they are VERY salty, I mixed them with Progresso's regular Italian bread crumbs and no parmesan.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as stated.  To my pasta I added a whole bunch of the Starter and a lot of parmesan.  This is a very easy very tasty meal.  The recipe didn't really use very much of the can of the Starter, so I'll have to see how it freezes for another meal another time.  Thanks, Progresso, for a wonderful meal!

We Really, REALLY wanted to like this, but the sauce itself was really bland.  Before coating the chicken I added the garlic powder and tasted the coating--then added black pepper, onion powder, paprika AND parsley.  Then coated and baked as normal.  I realized after I had coated with the panko that I had forgotten the melted butter mixed in with the Progresso mixture.  My chicken didn't crisp up, so I had to put it under the broiler to prevent a soggy mess.  The remaining soup for the sauce was WAY too bland to be used as sauce for pasta, so I sauteed some onion and garlic cloves and once that soup was warm used my hand blender to mix it all together.  The taste was still off--very much tasted like something from a box or a can, even after increasing spices.  It didn't do anything for the family--there was no 'wow' factor...the kids and hubby told me they honestly prefer oven 'fried' chicken fingers over this.  I'm willing to agree--so much less work involved in those.  I'm 90% certain we won't be having this again.

My first Progresso Recipe Starters cooking sauce recipe … Crispy Garlic Parmesan Chicken.  The Chicken was delicious.  Pasta??? Not so much. I made the recipe exactly as written. As far as speed and ease goes dinner was on the table within 35 minutes and I plan to add this to my Fast Night Meals Pinterest board.  If I were to use this canned sauce on pasta again I would add some fresh herbs and more seasoning. I felt it didn’t have a fresh taste and almost crossed the line to a “Canned” taste. Chicken 5 stars… Pasta, 2 ½ stars.

I liked the chicken part of this dish. It was delicious! I served the remaining sauce over penne pasta but didn't particularly care for it.  Fast and easy though.

I did not care for this recipe. I baked the chicken for almost 30 minutes and the breading still wouldn't brown. Even the broiler was little help.

Quick and Easy!  After working around the house, this dish made for a welcomed meal.  It was so easy to put together.  I set the timer for 12 minutes then turned the oven to broil for the last couple minutes for browning.  Very tasty and enjoyable!  Thank you Progresso Recipe Starters for another tasty easy meal!

My family really raved about this dish. It was juicy, tasty and not at all difficult to make. The only reason I'm giving it four stars is I was disappointed it did not get crispy brown like in the picture. I cooked it for 8 minutes on one side, then flipped it for 10 on the other. I think for our oven, 400 may not have been hot enough. Will have to experiment with this in the future. The starter sauce really added alot of flavor!!

I enjoyed this but had to make many changes. I used three cheese starter sauce(because that's what they had at the store) and marinated the chicken in it. I did not use the butter. I seasoned the chicken I used italian blend shredded cheese with the panko bread crumbs. I did not fry it I baked it on 450 for about 15 mins. Family loved it I will definitely make this again.

I made this recipe last night. After reading the reviews, I decided to skip the pasta and make the chicken with other sides. I did not have italian panko crumbs so I mixed Italian bread crumbs with plain panko bread crumbs. I thought the chicken came out delicious! I baked it according to the directions but after flipping the chicken some of my breading was coming off. I broiled it at the end to brown it but it was still not crispy. Crispy or not, it tasted great! I will make them again, maybe fry them next time to keep crispy. I froze the rest of the can for next time.

This was outstanding! I followed the recipe just like it said and it came out great. My roommate loved it so much he kept eating more. I have never heard him  rave so much over a dish before. The chicken was so full of flavor. The sauce for the pasta was excellent. Thank you.

My changes:
Butterflied the chicken breasts (would have been better without this alteration - I think  it ended up too dry because of this),

Made a rue for the sauce before making

Added herbs/spices to sauce to taste

Over all a good recipe.

DON'T FORGET TO SPRAY THE FOIL!!  Breading stuck to the foil because of this.

Likes:
Had a great balance of cheesiness in the breading.

Dislikes:
Did not brown very much.

While it certainly wasn't soggy, the coating wasn't crispy enough to earn 'crispy' as the first word of the title.  This dish was lacking some major flavor too.  I think maybe seasoning the chicken with salt and pepper may have helped.  The pasta came out OK with lots of extra Parmesan on it.  This recipe just didn't tickle our taste buds.

My family enjoyed the chicken.  I had to kick the oven temp up to 450 and then just ended up broiling at the end to crisp it up.  The sauce I did not care for.

This wasn't for us. I tried to doctor up the sauce to our liking, but we still didn't care for it. I cooked the chicken as specified and it did not crisp up on the outside.

This is so easy to make, great for those busy days.  I sliced the chicken into medallions, pounding them about ¼ inch thick, slightly less cooking time, which is why they may not have browned as much as I would have liked.  I served this over strozzapreti for an enjoyable, tasty dish.

Mmmm!  This was a winner in my house.  Everyone loved it - me, my hubby, my 18 month old and my picky 7 year old!!  That almost never happens! I followed the recipe as written and the chicken came out crispy on the outside, moist on the inside and very flavorful...and super easy too. It was a nice change from my normal bread crumb/egg batter for chicken breast.

This was wonderful. I made it exactly as written, except I made my own creamy parmesan basil sauce, but it came out great. On the table in 30 minutes too. This will be made regularly!

I am a Very picky eater,  but I figured I would try this. It was one of the best dinners I have had. I did substitute a few things, I used Campbell's Creamy Parmesan Chicken skillet sauce instead of the Progressive one. I fried it in a pan with a little bit of extra virgin olive oil. It came out very crispy and amazing. Thanks for this recipe.

Family liked this I thought it was a little on the bland side.  It was a nice change from typical marinara sauce but nothing special.

Quick and easy to make and was a nice change from the usual Saturday night fare. I omitted the parmesan from the breading, but opted to sprinkle some ontop after chicken finished baking. Added peas/carrots to the remaining sauce to heat through before adding to pasta (egg noodles). I left out any additional salt the recipe asked for, kept the pepper about the same and just added a light dash of salt at the end before eating.
