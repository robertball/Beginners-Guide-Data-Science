DELICIOUS!  I used fresh blueberries from my garden, added 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg, used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white.  Before adding my blueberries, I coated them in a small amount of flour to keep their shape when adding to the batter.  I hand stirred in the berries.  My batter was very thick!  This bread rises high due to the amount of baking powder used, so make sure your oven racks are spaced apart well.  I made 3 mini loaf pans and baked for 25-35 minutes.  Very moist and flavorful!!! Will make again.

This is a great recipe! I made 4 loaves in 2 days because it disappeared so fast. I left out the nuts and increased the berries to 2 cups. I also added an extra 1/2 cup of sugar as the b. berries I had were tart. I used standard loaf pans(2) and baked 45mins Delicious!!!!!!

This bread is pretty good.  Pretty mild in flavor though so next time I think I'll add cinnamon and/or vanilla.  To save on fat and calories I cut sugar to 3/4 c.; used 1 c. whole wheat pastry flour + 2 c. all-purpose flour; used 2T applesauce + 1T vege. oil; used 2 c. blueberries and omitted nuts.  Baked in a 9x5 pan and it took forever to bake--about 1 1/2 hours.

Because of the reviews of this being a bland bread, I used orange juice instead of the milk, added a teaspoon each of vanilla and cinnamon and added maybe 1/2 cup more blueberries. It definitely wasn't bland then, but rather moist and flavorful, with a good texture that was somewhere inbetween a bread and cake. The crust got really crunchy (which I liked) but I ended up baking it for nearly 90 minutes before it was done.

I left out the nuts because I didn't have any and I topped the bread with a bit of cin. sugar.  This is like a muffin in bread form and not too sweet.  Recommended

This bread went over great at the daycare center where I work. I made a few modifications by adding more blueberries and using 25% less flour per serving. I also added larger amount of cinnamon into batter. I made a topping with butter, cinnamon, and sugar and sprinkled on bread right after I pulled from oven. Great bread recipe. I will make this again

I tried this bread with a 9" loaf pan and it was a disaster. It burned on top but was still batter in the center. Then I tried it with the 12" as recommended and it was perfect!  Tastes just like muffins but in a loaf.  I sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on top.  As others have suggested, it is also good toasted and with butter.  My kids love it too.  I would suggest adding cinnamon or other flavorings if you prefer more flavorful breads, although we like it as it is.

This bread is so good!  It has a good flavor and tastes like a blueberry muffin, but in a loaf. Just put a little butter on it and it is delicious!  Thanks for the recipe.

I omitted the walnuts from my recipe.  I found this recipe to be very basic and nothing special.  I probably won't make it again.  The taste was o.k. but nothing to write home about.  A good recipe if you want a basic and plain bread with blueberries.

I took the suggestion and added OJ instead of milk and it turned out great ! I also added vanilla and a crunchy topping before baking and I am glad that I did. I am not sure that it would have been as good without it. Here's the topping: Crumb together 1/3 cup flour, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 cup butter and 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon.

This was very good and quite moist.  Don't forget to coat the blueberries with flour so they don't sink to the bottom of the loaf.

i'm sorry to say this but i'm afraid the two loaves sitting in my kitchen will have to go to the birds, I really dont know what everyone is talking about, this bread turned out terrible, it tasted aweful too... I followed the recipe but since I didnt have a large loaf pan I made two 9x5 loaves. the loaves themselves turned out very flat, despite having so much baking soda, which i could taste! Although i'm not a fan of very sweet breads, this recipe could have used a little more. the one mistake i did make was not reading the reviews like i usually do before trying out any recipe. Maybe adding vanilla or cinnamon would have maded it taste better but i don't think i'll be wasting my time trying this one out again.

This bread is very good, I did put 2 tsp of vanilla extract and I doubled the berries so it was full of blueberries!!  This is a great base to start with!! Swap out blueberries for raspberries or chocolate chips, add cinnamon and raisins for raisin bread, maybe lemon extract and poppyseeds, or orange juice and dried cranberries!! it's limitless and a great starting point for many breads!!

In making this bread, I added orange zest with the blueberries and topped it with an orange sugar glaze ... and it was delicious.  It took a little extra time to bake because my pan was a nit smaller than it called for in the recipe.  My family loved it.

Read reviews before trying out and decided to adjusted as follows:   1 C sugar replaced with 3/4 C packed dark brown sugar + 1/2 C granulate sugar.  Replaced veg. oil with melted butter. And added 1 tsp vanilla extract.   And increased blueberries to 1.5 C.  And saved 1 tbl flour from batter and used to flour blueberries prior to adding to batter.   Turned out moist and flavorful.   Not too sweet, but sweet enough.   Would definately make again.

Really good, but I wanted it to be a little sweeter.  I'll definitely make it again, but will add some extra sugar as others have suggested and also some vanilla.  I added about 1/2 more blueberries because I had them on hand.  I also topped it with a very basic crumb recipe that gave it that little extra something special.  Crumb recipe:  1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 flour and @ 1/8 - 1/4 cup softened butter (should be kinda moist after mixed).  Mixed it in my mixer until consistency of large pieces of sand.  Delicious!

Hmm...guess I was a little disappointed with this one. It wasn't sweet enough for me. Tasted more like dry blueberry cornbread. Would do a few things differently. Gave it 3 stars because well, if I'd been expecting blueberry cornbread,....it was great!

I thought this bread was going to be amazing after reading some of the other reviews. But it was very bland, and all I could smell is flour, or maybe the baking soda? Its not very flavorful, I added 2 teaspoons of vanilla and 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/3 cup of brown sugar and it was still very tasteless. My search continues for a great blueberry bread.

This bread came out so good. I love blueberries and here in Maine I'm lucky enough to go out and pick my own. I had made french toast for my love ones and boy did i get BRAGGED up over that dish.  I rate this a 5 :)

Good basic recipe to use with items in your pantry.  I did find that the normal loaf pan was NOT big enough, took too long to bake and the top was brown before the middle was close to being done.  I lowered the temp on the oven and had to leave in for an additional 40 min.  I suggest 2 pans in the future.

I loved this bread.  It is a very simple recipe so I understand why some thought it was 'bland.'  I liked it simple but I did add some vanilla.  I made it in a traditional bread loaf pan so I used the serving option to convert to 9 servings instead of 12 and the bread came out great.

I made this for Christmas gifts....I had to doctor this up.  I added twice the amount of blueberries, vanilla and topped it with brown sugar while cooking.   I have never made this type of bread before....I was really tasty!!!

This a great recipe for a "not to sweet" bread. I would increase the amount of blueberries next time to 2 cups. I also thought this bread would make great french toast but it was gone before I could try it.

This is a great recipe, I made it in 4 small aluminum loaf pans. It baked at the same temp but for only 45 minutes.All 4 loaf pans bake on one cookie sheet and therefore can bake all at once.

The bread was pretty good.  Beware though that this is a bread-like recipe and not cake-like (like banana bread sometimes is).  My family agreed the bread came out a little dry and the youngest didn't think it was sweet enough.  I did slightly change the recipe.  I used apple sauce instead of oil, added 1/2 tsp vanilla and sprinkled cinnamon into the batter.  I may or may not make this again.  If I do I will probably adjust it more to try and find a more moist of bread.

I made six loaves of this during Christmas time (I had an over abundance of frozen blueberries!).  Five loaves turned out wonderfully, especially when warm with butter.  One loaf came out very dry and crumbly.  I am not sure what happened with that one!  I did sprinkle cinnamon and sugar over the top before placing them in the oven, and I also left out the walnuts. Over all, a good recipe!

I made one small loaf of this recipe for my family, to test out, before making the other loaf to give to my sister in law as a thank you gift. I knew I would be making the second loaf before the first one was out of the oven! It smelled good, it looked good and it came as no surprise that it tasted good too. I used half all purpose flour and half bread flour, on the chance that it might make it better. I also used the suggestions of others: doubling the blueberries and skipping the walnuts. I sprinkled a light struesel topping of flour, sugar, brown sugar and cinnamon on top of the batter before baking. It gave it a sweet crunchy crust. I even managed this terrific loaf of bread using frozen blueberries! It turned out so well, Im afraid to do anything different next time. This one is definately worth trying, not too dry, but not overly moist either. I already have it printed up and put in my recipe binder for future use!

I can't understand why this has received even 4 stars.  I should have read the reviews before wasting the blueberries.  It was bland and dry without much flavor even after I added a streusel topping to it.  It definitely needs more sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon.  I should have just used the excellent "To Die for Blueberry Muffins" recipe at Allrecipes instead and put the batter in a loaf pan instead of making muffins.

Really good blueberry bread...I did add a half cup more of blueberrys, a teaspoon of vanilla, a teaspoon of cinnamon, and a dash of nutmeg and cloves.  I then topped it with a little bit of brown sugar and a cinnamon sugar mix.  The bread was good as is too...we just like a little more flavor.  Thank you for a good recipe!

This is a very good recipe for fresh blueberries or frozen. If you use frozen be sure to drain them after they thaw. I had a problem getting the center to bake completely so I always make this is the mini loaf pans. VERY GOOD!

This was good right out of the oven. After a couple of hours it started to crumble. My husband said it reminded him of a corn bread. I won't be making this again.

This is exactly what I was looking for!!  It is definitely NOT a cake type bread, which is why I chose it.  I used butter instead of oil and replaced 1/3 of the flour with whole wheat.  I upped the berries to 1 1/2 cups and didn't use nuts.  It did take an extra 15 minutes to back (75 mins total) but was totally worth the wait!  Awesome on its own but great toasted with butter, cream cheese or even peanut butter.  Thanks!  I'll will definitely make this again!!

Not quite what I was expecting, but not bad at all.  I used applesauce in place of the oil, a few more blueberries than what was called for and some mango flavored rum in place of the milk.  Baked in mini loaf pans thought this had really good flavor.  Different and interesting, thanks!

Very good bread.  I tasted the batter and was a little concerned about the "plain" taste.  I added some brown sugar to the top for a little bit more flavor.  In the end, I didn't need it.  The bread was great!

Very "clean" taste - the blueberry flavor is very well emphasized, not too sweet.  Great hot off the oven, but even better the following day.

Like all the recipes I come across I use them as base recipes and tweak them based off of my families taste buds.  With this recipe I use 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar.  I also add 1 tsp of vanilla, 1 tsp of nutmeg and 1 tsp of cinnamon.  Today was my 3rd time making this in a month and made them into muffins instead of bread.  Thank you!!!

Two words for this recipe: di-vine!

As I prefer a slightly less sweet taste, I've cut the sugar to just above 3/4 cup.
I bake the batter into 2 pans for 40 min.

I had a large amount of blueberries that needed to be used. First I made To Die For Blueberry Muffins on AR that I had made previously and added an additional cup of blueberries. That is a really fabulous recipe. I still had quite a few loose berries and a plastic bag full that had been beat-up some and were sitting in alot of blueberry juice.  I decided to double this recipe and used one 9 x 5 loaf pan and one 8 x 4 loaf pan. I subbed some applesauce for most of the oil and stirred some greek yogurt into the applesauce/oil mixture, as well. Because of other reviews I decided to dump both the smushed-up blueberries and the loose ones into the batter at the end. With all the extra juice the batter was not stiff or hard to stir. It did make the batter blue, but once baked the color wasn't noticeable. I didn't have nuts, so didn't add, but did add a couple of teaspoons vanilla. This came out really moist and sweet and super delicious with the large amount of blueberries. Because of the unsweetened applesauce it was sweeter than it would have been without. It was probably an additional 1 and a half cups of blueberries. I froze the large loaf and the smaller one is quickly disappearing. :-)

I thought this would be more of a dessert bread, but it is much drier than I'd hoped. The other reviews about it being like a muffin but in bread form were true, but it's even drier than that in my opinion. If I make this again, I'm going to experiment with other ideas.

very simple and delicious recipe. read it at 7am, started making it soon after and trying a sample right out of the oven as I am reviewing this. Thank you Barbabara. One modification I did make was to cut down on the sugar a little bit (little less than 1 cup), but I think I will cut it down a little more next time. Can't wait for the kids to wake up to try it.

I thought this recipe was awesome and easy to make especially looking at the suggestions.  Although when I tasted the bread after it cooled it had a serious aftertaste , surely from the Baking Powder.

A little too sweet, maybe use 3/4 cup sugar instead. Could use more blueberries, maybe 1 1/2 cups.  Not really moist, kinda crumbly like coffee cake.  Won't make again.

This was the first bread I have ever made.  It was very easy to make and the consistency was nice.  I was able to use my 9X5 loaf pan.  I put in 1 and a half cups of blueberries and that turned out fine too.  However, like other reviewers, I found it was not sweet enough.  I expected it to taste like a blueberry muffin, but it didn't.  I probably wouldn't make this again, but I will try with other breads.

I used your recipe in my bread machine using it's "Batter Breads" setting. It came out beautifully! I waited until right before the bake cycle to fold in the blueberries so they stayed intact. Not only is it moist and flavorful, it looks pretty, too!

I was looking for something to do with blueberries that wasn't a cobbler or pie - specifically, I wanted banana-blueberry bread. This recipe, with a couple tweaks, came out well. I used brown sugar in place of the white and replaced half the flour with whole wheat (and added another half tsp of baking powder to balance it). I completely omitted the oil, and added a lot more fruit - 3/4 cup of mashed banana and another half cup of berries. (The first time I made this, the berries sunk; the second time, I coated them with flour and they floated nicely.) I also added 1 tsp vanilla, although the blueberries have a very strong flavor.  Replacing the oil with such a different amount of banana, I was a little worried about the consistency, but the bread rose properly and was neither too wet nor dry. A bit chewier than most breads, but especially after a day or so, it seemed perfectly normal. Very nice taste.

Very good!  I added extra sugar as the batter wasn't as sweet as I thought it should be.  Hubbie said it was good, but he wanted it sweeter so I may try to the OJ instead next time.  I thought it was a great texture, not dry!  The blueberries were very good in it!

This was a good recipe, I liked it.  Good flavor and texture.  I did make a few changes.  I reduced sugar to 3/4 cup (or slightly less) and used turbinado (raw) sugar.  It was still plenty sweet.  I used 2 tbsp. applesauce and 1 tbsp. butter in place of vegetable oil.  I used spelt flour instead of white/wheat and reduced the amount slightly since it is heavier (about 3.5 cups).  I used almond milk instead of regular milk.  I added a tsp. or so of vanilla and a tiny bit of cinnamon.  I wish I had had more or better blueberries for it!  Will make again with more blueberries.  The whole family liked it and it came out nice and crispy/chewy outside and soft inside.

This was a yummy quick bread recipe. I used 2 cups of fresh blueberries (I had a bunch), 2 tsp vanilla, a pinch of cinnamon, a pinch of fresh ground nutmeg, and added a streusel topping. I have to have streusel on my muffins and quick breads ;)

Meh. I made this bread exactly as the recipe indicated, except I used almond milk instead of real milk.  This bread was rather dry and boring.  I wouldn't bother to make it again without some modifications, such as adding some applesauce or something to make it more moist, and adding a bit more flavor - lemon zest and vanilla extract, perhaps?

The recipe is excellent; however, I believe that the next time I make it, I'll add a teaspoon of vanilla extract. I would like to receive any comments on this thought.

I left out the nuts and added 1 tsp. of vanilla and it was fabulous!  My family loved it because it wasn't overly sweet and the blueberry taste was so prominent.  I'll be making this one in the future!

This was my first attempt at any kind of bread, and WOW it turned out great! I followed the recipe exactly except I added a little more blueberries (I had about a half a cup more than called for) and I sprinkled the top of the loaf with sugar before baking. Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

This was a good, basic recipe.  It was very easy to throw together. It wasn't as tasty as my Nana's blueberry bread, but she didn't have a recipe...she just threw a pinch of this and a handful of that together. The only changes I made were to increase the blueberries to 2 cups, and omit the nuts.  I baked it in a 1.5 quart glass loaf pan for 60 minutes and it came out perfectly.  It was gone in one day, so I would say it was a hit with my family!

This recipe made a very stiff batter that I found difficult to work with. I added more blueberries and omitted the nuts. It smelled wonderful baking in the oven, but I found it rather bland.  Husband and kids enjoyed it.

Wonderful!! Made a few changes that others had suggested and it didn't last the day. Doubled the blueberries, added vanilla and cinnamon. Also added some brown sugar on top before baking. The walnuts are a must. They added so much flavor! Made in 2 loaf pans and baked 50 minutes. They were outstanding - gone before the next morning.

Would recommend making two smaller loaves.  Had to bake a long time.  Sprinkled sugar on top and used more blueberries.  Family enjoyed it.

we liked this bread.  it isn't sweet like a muffin. I left out the nuts and doubled the blueberries.  I think the extra blueberries helped.  would be real bland without them.   I will make this again.

With the bit of "doctoring" I did, we'd give it 4.5 stars.  I used 1.5 cups of Splenda instead of 1 cup of white sugar.  The mixture was VERY thick and dough like... I continued adding milk until it thinned out a bit.  Then added a 1 lb bag of thawed- frozen blueberries.  I sprinkled/poured dark brown sugar on top... it carmelized a bit... yum!  I cooked it for 50 minutes in a 9" loaf pan and a little extra batter in an individual size baking dish... that was the "test loaf."  It was delicious... and I'll make it many times in the future.  (With all the brown sugar on top... I'm glad I used splenda in the recipe- cut down on at least a bit of the calories.)

Not bad!  It was a little dry, but that problem was solved quickly with a smear of butter.  It did stick to the bottom of the pan, though.  I did as instructed and tried to take the bread out of the pan before it cooled, but it nonetheless broke apart.  I quickly placed the part stuck on the bottom of the pan back on the loaf and it sliced pretty well after sitting with my "repairs" a few minutes.  The taste was decent enough, but a little bland.  I think it could use a little more depth of flavor, not necessarily spice, but perhaps a fruit addition?  I have seen several recipes combining the berries with lemon, perhaps that would be something to try...

For a 5x9 loaf pan, 72 minutes seems to work. Like the write up says, it's good warm or toasted.  I added a little margarine to the top and it gave it the sweetness it was missing.  (I am a sweets lover.)  I thought the bread would be more like muffin mix tasting, but it is not.

perfect quick bread for holiday gifts. Stayed soft on the inside even after

This is delicious!  I substituted honey for the vegetable oil, which made it a little sweeter and lower in fat.  My friend loved it.  It's not too sugary to have for breakfast, but it's sweet enough for a nice dessert!  I will definitely make it again!

This recipe couldn't have been easier.  I used 1/4 C sour cream and 3/4 C milk when the recipe called for 1 C milk as well as 1/2 tsp orange extract.  I also omitted the nuts but doubled up the blueberries.  Yeilded two 5x9 loaves.  Yummy thanks!

I followed GodivaGirls recommendations and my husband loved it.  Said it was the best I have ever made.
I am sure I will make it again and again and again.

I loved this bread!!! When I make blueberry bread I don’t want to taste anything but a moist and tasty blueberry bread not oranges and avocados.  I doubled the fresh blueberries and omitted the nuts.  I also added 1 tsp of vanilla. Scrumptious!

Perfect!! I loved it! Family loved it! I’ve now made it once a week for the past month. I hope the family doesn’t burn out on it because it’s hard to find great snack foods that are at least decent for them and that keeps them from reaching for a bag of chips especially with 8 people in the family.

Excellent bread!! Would make it again. Great base for making other combo such as raisins/orange bread. Would recommend 1) increasing blueberries to 2 cups; coat blueberries w/ flour first before adding. 2) 1 tsp liquid stevia extract instead of 1c sugar if you’d like. 3) add 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/8 tsp nutmeg, 2tsp vanilla, and consider adding lemon juice as well. 4) Bake 1.5hrs if using one 9-inch baking loaf pan.

I wanted a bread that was just like a Blueberry Muffin.  I noticed it didn't have any vanilla and I almost put some in.  I like to make a recipe just like it's suppose to be and then make changes later.  I'm glad I didn't change a thing.  It is bland, but it's good, just like a muffin.  I'm not a big fan of nuts so I didn't put any in.  If I wanted an orange, lemon or cinnamon flavor, then I would have used one of my other recipes.  I was looking for the flavors of the blueberries only and this did.  I doubled the recipe and it made three loaves.  Great recipe!!

While it does turn out well, the timing is based on an unknown pan size. Using a glass standard sized pan, it was 75 minutes.

This recepie was easy and the bread came out good. I did let the bread double in size after I placed it in the pan so there was no need to add more flour to it. I mixed the blueberries with flour  and added 1tsp of cinnamon.  the flour did help for the blueberries not to sink on the bottom.

It was an easy recipe to follow.  I read other reviews and made the following changes...added 1T vanilla, 1T cinnamon, 1t nutmeg, 2T brown sugar to the dry mix.  When I was mixing my ingredients, I added the berries to the last bit of dry mixture to coat them in flour and retain their shape.  I also cooked it in a greased/sugared 10x10 cake pan.   After filling the pan I added an additional 3/4 cup berries to the top and pushed them into the batter.   At the 1 hour mark I covered the top with foil because the center was still soupy.  I cooked it another 30 min covered and it turned out great.  Very dense and bursting with berries.

This recipe is "okay", but I did follow others' suggestions and added vanilla and extra sugar.  I also wish I had gone with my gut and added more melted butter (used this instead of oil).  This bread is very dense/heavy.  Coated blueberries in flour as others suggested and they were evenly distributed throughout the bread.  Oh, added lemon zest too.  I guess I didn't really make this recipe at all but some version of it.  I made it for my dad to give with a jar of lemon curd, which will probably work nicely together since the bread is heavy (and a little dry.)  I used two 9" loaf pans as a suggested alternative and cooked for 50 minutes and that part worked just fine.  Probably won't make it again.

I made some changes to this recipe, I reduced the sugar and only used 1/2 cup, I also used extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I  added a cup and half of blueberries as well as 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. Next time I make this I will add 1/2 Greek honey and 1/2 applesauce.

Its delicious, but just a bit dry to me, would be perfect if it can be more moist. Don't know if it was the time of baking takes too long or was it actually should turns out just to be like that?

This was good, though definitely needed vanilla and a bit more sugar to make it less bread-like.

I also added 1/2 cup of cherries that I had. Delicious recipe. It was very dense since I was too lazy to sift the flour. I would recommend putting aluminum foil on as soon as the top is light brown so the insides can cook longer without the top getting too crispy. Will make again!

Added cinnamon (1/2 tsp), vanilla (1 tsp), nutmeg (1/8 tsp), 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar.   Left out walnuts and used 2 cups blue berries (coating in flour).

Really good, just what I was looking for.  Could have probably upped the blue berries to 2.5-3 cups.

Living on a large farm and ranch, I have access to some of the ingredients in organic, fresh form, so I used 3 medium-large free range eggs from my chicken coop, 1 1/2 thawed organic blueberries from last season's harvest since mine aren't ready yet, fresh unsalted butter for the fat (4 tbsp). I did use store bought granulated sugar, sea salt, flour, baking powder and used 3/4 cup whole milk and 1/3 cup heavy cream. 
The family liked it as is, but requested it for french toast in the morning!

Very Good, indeed!  Used Bundt pan, as all I had for size of recipe ... Worked well.  Sprinkled cinnamon on top just before baking... added little spice.  Interesting that recipe only called for 3 TBs oil... Quite moist!  Baked at 350 for 50 minutes... perfect.

I have lots of fresh-picked frozen blueberries & was looking for bread recipes to use them in.  This is a very easy recipe, but it is also very bland. The bread isn't bad-tasting, it just doesn't have much flavor...and I doubled the amount of blueberries. Disappointing.

This is okay.  It is more like a loaf of bread than a sweet bread like I was hoping it would be.  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup to save some calories and substituted applesauce for the oil.  I also added some cinnamon and almond extract as I had read others say it was sort of bland.  I do not think I would make this again as it wasn't what I wanted.  My husband thought it was delicious though and he usually does not touch my breads (pumpkin, banana nut, etc.)

Not much flavor and didn't like the texture.  It needs more oil/fat and more blueberries.

This recipe is yummy! I did make some adjustments though to make it perfect! 3/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, and 2 teaspoons cinnamon! I used 1/2 cup walnuts like the recipe but next time I'll probably use 1 cup chopped pecans. The whole family loved it though!

I'm glad I read the reviews before making this! I followed the suggestion and added vanilla and cinnamon. I also used one extra egg, and replaced the milk with apple juice. Before I put it in the oven I sprinkled brown sugar and cinnamon on top. It came out with a nice crispy crust and really moist inside. My husband loved it! He brought some to work with him and his co workers ate it right up! I will definitely be making this again!

I made 4 mini loaves with this recipe. I also Added real maple syrup in the batter (and reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup)and drizzled some on the top before baking it. It was fantastic. **Oh, I used almond milk to make it dairy free and it came out great**

I found this recipe to be easy and fun, the bread tastes good, I added a bit of vanilla extract and left out the nuts, can also be baked in a muffin pan easily for individual bread loafs.

Made this bread for the Sunday school class at church without the walnuts.  People went back for second helpings. Had no left overs at all!  Made some more recently for my husband, son, and I!  The Blueberry bread deserves a thumbs up, and five stars for sure!

I usually make a recipe as is the first time, but this time I used a few of the hints in the other reviews and I'm so glad I did!  I used 1 c. white sugar and  1/2 c. of brown sugar (next time will use a bit less), added some vanilla and cinnamon.  Baked it in a 12 in. loaf pan for about 55 min.  No walnuts...didn't have any, but it's fine without.  Tastes like a zucchini bread, but with blueberries and not quite as dense...just as I hoped it would!

Really good recipe!  I used 2 tbsp of homemade applesauce, 1 tbsp of oil.  I also cut the sugar down to 3/4 of a cup since I there is a little sugar in the applesauce.  I used 2 cups of blueberries and left the walnuts out and threw in a tsp of vanilla and cinnamon.  I split it into to normal pans and it came out great!

I thought this was very good. I increased the sugar to 1.5 cups based on other reviews, and added 2 tsp vanilla. Didn't have OJ to substitute for milk but it still turned out well. I split the batter into 2 loaf pans.

This bread is delicious. I served slices of it this morning with a nice hot bowl of oatmeal. Perfect for those winter mornings when your children have to walk to school in the cold. I substituted the oil with apple sauce to cut down on the fat and calories.

This was a good recipe overall.  I made some changes to it as did most everyone else.  First I used 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and 1/2 white flour.  I also used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  A dash of cinnamon and a splash of vanilla.  I also used 1/2 milk and 1/2 vanilla stonyfield  yogurt.  Next time I'll add more milk and yogurt, because the batter was very stiff.  I have a picky toddler who doesn't eat anything unless it is in bread form.  So the healthier I can make it for him the better I feel.  I will make again!

I just had a piece fresh out of the oven w/ a little butter, mmmmm perfection.
I took another reviewer's tip and baked this in 2 standard 9x5 loaf pans for 45 min. Came out beautiful! Thank you for a great recipe.

This recipe was ok.  The bread came out more like a dense cake.  I was hoping for a consistency along the lines of banana bread, but the flavor was good.  My kids really liked it and that is who I made it for!

This is a nice bread, but it is a tad dry.  Thanks to the reviewers who suggested adding 1 tsp each of cinnamon and vanilla.  I think that really saved it from being bland.  The cinnamon blends beautifully with the blueberries.  I added about 1/2 a cup more berries and baked this for 40 minutes in two smaller bread pans.  It raises nicely but will need to be warmed up to eat due to the dryness.

I loved this recipe!!! I made a few modifications and it came out great.  I added the zest of 1 orange, and about 3 tbsp of juice as well as 2 tbsp of brown sugar.  I also used pecans instead of walnuts (i toasted them slightly before using them).  It came out light and bursting with great blueberry flavor with a hint of orange.

It tasted very good. I warmed the milk a little bit in the microwave so that it took less time to bake in Colorado.

Followed the recipe exactly.  Next time I'll add more sugar, vanilla extract, maybe a dash of cinnamon.  It's pretty bland, but its ok with some butter.

The only change that I made in the recipe was to add about 1/2 cup of extra blueberries...just because I love them.  I used frozen blueberries (which it says you can use in the instruction part of the recipe).  My husband was a little thrown with his first bite because he was expecting blueberry muffin sweetness, but after his initial surprise, he was pleased with the taste.  It is a great blueberry bread and I would recommend it.  I made them for guests at our church in mini-loaves cooked for 30 mins at recommended temperature.  Worked out nicely.

Meh. It was just okay. It didn't have much flavor, and the texture wasn't what I wanted. I even added lemon zest and vanilla just to be safe. I would go with a different recipe.

The outside of the bread was brown, but the inside still wasn't done.  Next time, I would make 2 smaller loaves or 4 mini loaves for better baking.

A very easy and tasty way to use some of the wild blueberries that grow around our home!  The loaves came out nicely shaped and came out of the pans in a snap when lined with greased parchment paper.  I'll be freezing some for the winter!

I modified this recipe tremendously (added wheat germ, sourcream, and honey and substituted oil with applesauce) and it stil turned out great. But for an even better treat...dip day old bread in fat-free egg nog and cook like french toast!! Yummy!!!

good bread.  i was a little nervous about the recomended amount of flour and baking soda but everyone's reviews said it was great and not too sweet so i went ahead and left it in.  i added more blueberries and that is a good tip as well.  this is more like a blueberry soda bread, and less of a blueberry muffin kind of thing, but it sure was great.  thanks again.

I made this to freeze for a later date. But I can tell you that it was very easy to make,and I used frozen blueberries. Cooking time was a bit longer as well, probally about 1/2hr longer. Came out looking beautiful. I used a regular loaf pan.

I baked this for a large family get together and everyone loved it.  I doubled the blueberries as  suggested, a good tip.  I would also add a bit more sugar next time, though some people liked it better because it wasn't too sweet.

This bread was easy to make, however the texture seems slightly off.  I will try it again, but will definitely increase the amount of blueberries into the recipe next time.  My husband and I enjoyed this much more than the children did.
