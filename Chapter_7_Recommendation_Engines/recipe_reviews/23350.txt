This is my recipe and they made some slight changes when posting.  I use a small box of Mexican-style processed cheese food (e.g. Velveeta) and a can of Mexican Style Tomatoes.  I receive rave reviews wherever I take it.

I make a similar recipe with spicy ground pork instead of beef.  Gives the dip a little more kick!

This recipe was fabulous.  I served it on Super Bowl Sunday and my guests loved it.  I had to make 3 batches of it!  Thanks Kristle for the grand recipe.

I was looking for something to cook for 4-H the other day and I found this nacho recipe.  We tried and our whole family loved it. It can be served with some veggies to make a full meal or can be used as a snack! THis is a very good recipe! Five stars! :)

Every time we have a Mexican night at our house with tacos or enchiladas...we make this.  It is such an easy and tasty treat that we can't help it.  This is very good.  Thanks for the post.

A substantial and satisfying appetizer. I used halved grape tomatoes with a shot of hot sauce for added freshness.

I love the recipe, I however added 1 can of drained black beans to add a little more veggies. My family loves this dip, serve with sour cream and doritos, or any kind of corn chips. I prefer Rotel brand tomatoes and jalepenos

I love this stuff.  We make it for every family get-together.  I usually kick it up with a few drops of hot sauce.

We thought this was OK, but prefer chili to the ground beef and adding some extra green chili peppers.

My kids loved this and coupled with a big salad it made a great and quick "fun food" dinner for them. Instead of the canned tomatoes, I used a spicey salsa. Good one Kristle!

This was good with some tweaking.  I used 12 oz cheese as I needed to use it up and I'm glad I did.  Even with using the additional 4 oz of cheese I still didn't use the full amount of ground beef.  For our preferences this recipe needs either half the amount of ground beef called for or twice the amount of cheese.  With these adjustments, the recipe was well received.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I added some extra cheese because I had a little more than a pound of beef.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  My family and friends absolutely loved this dip!

Loved it, I added 1T ground chili paste (personal favorite to get a spicy kick) and about 1/2 C sour cream.
