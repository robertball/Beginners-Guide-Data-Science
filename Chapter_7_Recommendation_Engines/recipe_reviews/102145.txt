Yummy!
I love the traditional crostini, but my husband, the quintessential meataholic, loves this one as much as I do!
Easy to prepare, this crostini fills the bill for my entire family!
Our only problem was eating too much of it!
Thanks for posting!!

This was actually pretty good.  I made it for Super Bowl '11.  I used Bob Evans 'Hot and zesty' sausage being that our grocer was out of Jimmy Dean's sausage and my BF doesn't really care for raw onions, so I used the Chive & Onion cream cheese.  Also, I just bought pre-sliced french bread and cut them in 1/2.  I modified this recipe some, but this is a great base recipe.

Used Jimmy Dean crumbles..skipped the fresh basil (didnt have any) but added some dried Italian seasoning instead. Want to make it again w/ the fresh basil, and with the hot sausage like another reviewer mentioned.
