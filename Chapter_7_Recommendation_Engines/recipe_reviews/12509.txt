I had been looking for an egg custard pie & this one looked simple.  I made it in a very short time and it was WONDERFUL. Tastes just like my Grandmother used to make.  So easy and so good.

i usally make the Mississippi egg custard pie (which is the most tasty thing in the world), but i only had 100g of sugar (i needed 350g), so i thought "what i'm i going to do?" so i decied to look for 1 which needed less sugar, i found this 1. now i don't know which 1 to make any more they are both 5/5 and both the best. try the Mississippi egg custard too, see what you think is best

This was pretty good. It's a very mild tasting custard pie. It seemed a bit watery when I took a bite, but the taste is good and it was a really simple pie to make. The next time I think I'll add some coconut to make coconut custard pie :)

I love this recipe, there was only one change that I made... to use evaporated milk which made it even better than the recipe itself

The easiest and best custard pie I ever made!  I used Splendra instead of sugar and it was wonderful.

So very simple but soooo good!  It is a little on the sweet side but I don't know it I would change the amount of sugar or not.  I made the recipe exactly as written except for putting a sprinkle of nutmeg on top before baking since that is the way I am use to custard pie.

This is the only recipe that I use. I do add 1 T of flour for a little firmer custard and add nutmeg and sugar combo to the top. It’s the best. Sometimes I use 1/2 sugar and 1/2 Splenda. ??

So easy.  Cook it up in a jiffy and it is delicious.  This is especially good for people who do not care for a lot of silly seasonings.  It is inexpensive and tasty.

Turned out perfect. I found it hard to tell if it was done and pulled it when a toothpick in the center was almost clean hoping carryover would take care of the rest. It did and it was a hit.

HORRIBLE! I should have known it was too simple to work. I cooked it the required time and when I took it out of the oven it was still completely liquid and it sloshed into my oven and then the burning liquid set off my smoke alarm and woke up my whole apartment building. This is an awful recipe.

Exactly a recipe I was looking for...sprinkled freshly ground nutmeg on top.  Cooked 5 additional minutes than what was directed.   No other changes.   If you can use farm fresh eggs at room temp, I would recommend.

The only change I made was to use evaporated milk vs regular milk

This is an easy recipe for sure.  I think it calls for a little too much sugar and vanilla.  It also doesn't make enough to fill a 9" pie... 8" would work well, or double the recipe for 9".  Other than that, I think the texture is good.  I sprinkled some nutmeg on top when it was done.  That made it look pretty. It isn't a bad recipe. I'll make it again using the changes I wrote above.
