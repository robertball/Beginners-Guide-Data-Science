Literally the BEST cranberry sauce EVER. You will never again buy the canned  kind. I followed the recipe to a T, except that I substituted one small can of mandarine orange slices instead of one orange. It made prep super easy. For the dried fruit, I used the Sunmaid bits of fruit that include raisins, prunes, cherries and  apricots. Everyone at our Thanksgiving dinner loved this sauce. My mother asked for seconds and thirds! The recipe makes a TON, but it lasts in the fridge and only gets better as the flavors blend. I found myself craving it by the spoonful the days following Thanksgiving, so I would heat a few spoonfulls in the microwave until it was warm and ate it right out of the bowl. I am still eating it with cream cheese on bagels for breakfast every morning! This one will be a staple at my holiday table every year! The best way to describe it is that it tastes like "fall." The yummy fall spices make this dish.

Doesn't look like the picture at all....just fyi.  I liked the recipe, it was more like a fruity dessert than a cranberry sauce, which was actually nice since some people don't like Cranberry sauce.  I would recommend that you half the sugar, cook the cranberries in a different pot, put the remaining pot of fruit in a food processor after cooked and then add the cranberries after processing.  This would give it more of a "cranberry dish" feel.  It is very tasty, but make sure to half the sugar....the fruit was more than enough sweet.

FANTASTIC.  I substituted Splenda for all but a tablespoon of the sugar for my diabetic guest, a former chef.  He thought this was the most incredible cranberry sauce/chutney ever, and is now requested for all future thanksgivings.  I don't care for regular cranberry sauce, but this was quite nice.  I used about 1/2 the nuts called for, dried cranberries, cherries, and apricots, a whole (small) pear with a 1/2 an apple, and added a pinch of ginger and some allspice in addition to the cinnamon.  The house smelled wonderful, and it tasted just as good.

Use Food Processor!  So much easier!!! I put fruits and nuts one at a time in food processor then after cooking processed again to get that pretty red color back.  I added an extra orange and used dried apricots which threw off the color but cut the tart flavor and were FABULOUS!  The pecans make this absolutely irresistable.  Serving suggestion: on bagel, toast or crackers with cream cheese!  Its awesome!

I used to hate cranberry sauce but not any more.  I've been making this for thanksgiving and Christmas for 2 years now and I "ALWAYS" get compliments on this dish.  I leave out the nuts, used a can of mandarin orange instead of orange and been trying different kinds of dried fruit like tropical fruit mixes (coconut, mango, pineapple, etc.)  It always turns out good.

This was a good cranberry sauce.  I used the same recipe, except using splenda instead of sugar and left out the dried fruit.  I also did not peel the fruit (except the orange of course!) and did not find that to affect the final product except the time it saved me.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a wonderful change from traditional cranberry sauces. It also was easy to make. I froze some for later and that worked well too.

Very good.  My pear was not quite ripe, and I used dried cranberries as fruit bits so I added a bit more sugar.  Next time I will add a mix of dried diced apples, currants, cranberries, and blueberries - and make sure my pear is RIPE!  I also left the pecans in halves in case the diner wanted to pick them out.  Leftovers were spooned into pre-baked shortbread tart shells and eaten with ice cream!

Fantastic!  I made this twice over the Thanksgiving holiday and it was well received both times. I used 1/2 cup dried cherries and 1/2 cup dried apricots for the dried fruit.  The second time I made the sauce I added slightly more than 1 cup sugar, and I thought it tasted even better.  This will be our new cranberry sauce tradition.  Thank you for this delicious sauce recipe!

Part 2 of 2 Parts!!    [CHEF'S NOTE:  The second time, on my commercial range, I chose not to simmer, but to use a low boil instead once the syrup was ready.  The cranberries began to burst almost as soon as they were immersed, and my doubled recipe was cooked in about 15 minutes, contributing to the apples and pears retaining their consistency.  I recommend the higher heat instead of the longer simmer.]      A double recipe yields a little more than 3 quarts.  And I can tell you it won't be enough!  The finished product is very jam-like in texture, and reducing the sugar helps to not overwhelm the tartness of the cranberries.    You will not want to pass on this recipe.  It is a genuine crowd pleaser!  You may find that doubling again (to 4x) will provide the leftovers you'll be sorry you didn't have more of.  We have used this on toast and even as an ice cream topping!! (Try it, you'll love it.)      It will make an excellent gift when packed in 1/2 pint mason jars using a standard jam hot-pack method.  Just tell the recipients to use it as soon as possible so they can ask you for the recipe before all the cranberries are gone from the market until next year.

I introduced this to my "Intro to Cooking Class" this morning 3 out of the 12 students declared they hate Cranberry Sauce and would never think of even trying this dish during the taste portion of our class....  All three did tried Cranberry Sauce Extraordinaire and all 12 students left the class today saying when they have to bring a dish to the family gathering this year, this is the one!  I did change one thing... left uncovered and reduced the whole lot until it became thick, rich, sweet and wonderful.

As a professional chef, I knew this was a winning recipe when I saw it "on screen".  You will NOT be disappointed by this recipe which is easy enough for your child to do with supervision.      I made this for the first time -- twice in the same week.  First in a crockpot overnight, then on the stovetop.  Both times doubling the recipe and omitting the nuts and salt (no reason for salt in this recipe at all).  Also reduced the sugar to 1-3/4 cups instead of 2 cups.      Used smaller-sized navel oranges pureed to juice and pulp in a food processor, and golden raisins, mediterranean apricots, mango slices, and dark cherries as the dried fruit (all but the raisins chopped in the food processor with steel knife blade), and Granny Smith apples and Bosc pears cut by hand.      In a 6-quart crockpot overnight, the apples and pears broke down and became indistinguishable in the sauce.  And the lower heat of the crockpot means having to "help" the cranberries to burst.

This was 5 star recipe and after I cooked it down I put it in pint jars and hot bathed for 20 min. and am giving them out for Thanksgiving and Christmas gifts in my goody baskets.

This is really exceptional!  I made a double batch of this.   I took the advice of another reviewer and added dried cranberries instead of other dried fruit as I wanted a true cranberry taste.  It turned out a nice deep red.  We have some diabetics in the family so I only used 2/3 cup of Splenda in place of sugar for the double batch and it was nice and tangy!  I made a mistake though and as odd as it sounds, it worked out for the best!  Even though I had doubled the recipe, I accidentally only added one cup of water!  It turned out nice and thick (not runny) but watch the temp if you do that so it doesn't burn.  Got rave reviews and requests for the recipe which is the greatest compliment! Going to make more for Christmas next week!  I only rated four stars since I used the Splenda and only 1/2 the water for the double recipe, otherwise I would have rated it five stars!  **Edited** to add that the second time I made this, I used around 3/4 cup of Splenda, great taste but think everyone prefers it made with 2/3 cup of Splenda, more tang to the taste with 2/3 cup.

I just finished my first batch ever, only having been sampled by my wife and I but our two party jury has deliberated...this recipe is GUILTY of being the best cranberry sauce either of us has ever had! Some changes of note: I used half a cup of orange mango juice instead of water. Partly because of previous reviews stating the sauce tended to be a bit watery, but also because I substituted a cup of fresh raspberries and a cup of fresh blackberries for dried fruit. Also the reason I used a quarter of the suggested sugar. Instead of a fresh orange I used canned mandarin orange. I added a quarter cup of cognac and cut back on the spices by half while adding a 1/4 tsp of Chinese five spice. Cooking temp was a little higher to boil off some extra liquid. Turned out magnificent!

This was so good.  The only thing I'll change next time I make it (and there will be a next time; I'll never look for another cranberry sauce recipe again!) will be to soak the dried fruit in brandy before adding it.  That's the only thing I missed from my previous cranberry sauce.

Last year I used a different recipe and I was the only one who liked it. This time even people who don't like cranberry sauce liked this.   To accommodated their picky tastes I did leave out the pecans and dried fruit (though I think the pecans would be wonderful). I also used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar. And only 1/2 cup of water (because my cranberries were frozen for a week before I used them and were juicy). I didn't puree the orange, I just chopped it into small pieces and cooked it like that.

We really liked this cranberry sauce. I pureed some of it and served it as an appetizer over cream cheese. Every one gobbled it up! I had some on my bagel w/ cream cheese too. It was very good.

This is a wonderful dressing for turkey, chicken, hen or pork (including ham). I follow the recipe exactly when I'm home (except that sometimes I substitute 1/4 cup Splenda and 1/2 cup light brown sugar for the granulated sugar -- just for variety) but I substitute Pecan extract when I "travel" with this because some members at our holiday dinners can't handle the nuts. I've frozen double batches in plastic air-tight containers and it reconstitutes very well when left to defrost in the refrigerator overnight. Prefer it warm? 1-1/2 minutes in the microwave (stirring once, half-way thru) will take care of that. Enjoy.

Ok, this is absolutely THE VERY BEST AND MOST AMAZING cranberry sauce I have ever tasted, bar none.  My DD has been making this (by popular demand) for special occasions for family gatherings over the last year, and I finally got the recipe from her so that I can make it, too.  I have used this in and on everything from roast chicken/turkey, fish, filet mignon, and chicken stew (yes - added in just before serving!), all the way to sneaking into the refrigerator to snack on it like a leftover dessert (ooo la la - so very yummy!).   I promise, this won't disappoint and rivals the best of the best.  Pookie, I'm still going to be asking you to bring along this favorite, any time your precious hands are willing to make it!  (And I love your special touch with what you do with the pecans!)  Love you for having found this gem!  xoxo

AMAZING!! I made this for Thanksgiving last year and everyone loved it! There were many requests for me to bring it again to Christmas. I make two batches and there are never any leftovers. Great with cream cheese and crackers. It couldnt have been easier to make, just put all the ingredients in a pan and simmer! I loved the texture of the pecans, and the dried fruit is a must!

Followed the recipe mostly, however I used 13.5 oz (3 cups) of fresh picked low-bush cranberries, 1 granny smith apple, 1 bosch pear, 1 purreed navel orange, no nuts (lethal allergies in the family), and currants for the dried fruit (since that's all we had).  The cinnamon was a little overpowering, and I added 2 pinches of ground cloves, a pinch of ground ginger, and a pinch of mace to even out the flavour.  At first I was scared that the sauce was too sweet, but after the cranberries burst it turned into a perfect tart-sweet combination and a beautiful deep red-burgandy colour. Bonus: The currants plumped up and looked like little cranberries.   

Everyone loved it!  Even the anti-cranberry sauce folks!  The bf covered a third of his plate with a helping of this on it's own.  The recipe yielded so much that we are using the rest for a cheesecake topping later this week.

Love the versatility of the recipe!  Next time will omit salt (not needed), maybe try some orange zest, play around with maple syrup instead of sugar, try using anjou pear, and only use a pinch of cinnamon, nutmeg and the spices used above.  I'll also try some batches with nuts when my mom isn't around, and one without spices at all for comparison. This will be a year-round recipe. Thanks!

I noticed a lot of comments regarding too sweet or too tart, which does come from the type of dried fruit used as mentioned, but can also be affected by the fresh fruit.

This is a totally fabulous cranberry sauce, but I make it without the pecans.  I love pecans, but I don't care for them in this dish.  They create a bit of a weird texture for me.  I have used several different types of dried fruit - dried cherries, cranberries, raisins, blueberries, apricots, etc.  I've made this sauce many times and always get rave reviews!

Extraordinaire is appropriate.  I have been making cranberry sauce for years but was looking for something different. Followed the recipe to a T except I added 1/2 the pecans during cooking and 1/2 I toasted and put in at the end. This won't replace the old cranberry sauce, but will definitely be sitting next to it.

This year I volunteered to bring the cranberries to Thanksgiving dinner, and I wanted them to be really special. I chose this recipe since it had so many good reviews, but... gross. SALT in cranberry sauce?!! Also I thought the spices were overpowering. I had to run to the store to buy more cranberries & started over with the traditional cranberries/orange juice/sugar recipe & they turned out great. Might be ok if you leave out the salt & tone down the amount of cinnamon & nutmeg.

This was really good.  It made a perfect side dish.  I used trail mix and only a quarter of the sugar.  In place of water I used apple cider.  With that and the dried fruit all the sugar wasn't needed.

I have been making recipes from this website for years, but have never rated or reviewed anything.  I had to rate this.  This recipe is AMAZING!!!!  I decided that I wanted homemade cranberry sauce this year.  I had never tried to make it before.  We are a family that likes our can shaped sauce full of ridges (plus it's just one less item to have to prepare).  For my dried mixed fruit, I used a combination of blueberries, cherries and apricots.  I did not use an orange, but substitued a small can of drained mandarin oranges that I smashed up.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  It was very easy to make.  My 3 year old loved it too!  It was her favorite part of dinner!!!!  Will definitely be making this again in the future (and probably extra to have on hand for baked chicken dishes through the winter).

Wow...this recipe was great! Even better the next day. I will actually make this the day before because the flavor is not as bitter and just wonderful the day after. I used mandarin oranges from in the can. I did not have a pear around or dried fruit but did add a mango and it was just delicious. I plan on making this every year or also for Easter dinner. Next time I will add an extra apple and more of the oranges. It was just fine without the dried fruit. Thank you for this great recipe.

Ever since I found this recipe, I have been making it at Thanksgiving and Christmas. I now have to double the recipe, as people always want to take some home with them. This is also great to put over baked Brie when you need a fancy looking and delicious appetizer. Can be make ahead of time, and holds up well in the fridge.  I usually use a small can of mandarin oranges instead of the fresh orange, and is fabulous. You will never go back to the canned stuff!

I made this for this past Thanksgiving to bring to someone else's dinner.  It was a big hit.  My husband usually will only eat the strained jelly but he loved this.  Said there's no reason for the jelly if I have this.  I've made it again since Thanksgiving and had it with chicken and turkey meals.  Also put it in a burrito wrapper with chicken and rice dressing, heated in my pannini maker - delish!

Before I made it, I read the top 100 helpful reviews and incorporated their suggestions into the recipe by cutting the sugar in half and using mandarin oranges which I broke up with my fingers.

The second time I made it, I cooked the berries with the liquids and spices until the berries burst.  It was much easier to help them burst without the other fruits in the mix.  Once the berries burst, I added the other fruit and cooked until it was thick.  

Since we have nut allergies in the family, I toasted the pecans but didn't add them until I was able to take some plain sauce out first.

I can't imagine being without this and plan to always have some in the fridge.  Next time. I'll double the recipe and freeze it in smaller quantities that would be used within a couple of weeks.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!

Absolutely wonderful! This cranberry sauce is so easy to make. I omit the dried mixed fruit as I prefer all fresh fruit in my sauce, also I don't always add chopped pecans due to food allergies. I have also added pineapple to this sauce in years past and it adds a nice tropical twist. My family requests this side dish annually for Thanksgiving and Christmas. This past year we tried putting some warmed cranberry sauce over vanilla ice cream for dessert and found it heavenly! Thanks for sharing your recipe with us :)

This was far too tart for my sweet tooth.  I added another 1/2c. of sugar, a 1/4c. of orange juice and a 1/4 c. of sherry.  I didn't put in the dried fruit, either because I'm not a fan.  I let it simmer for about 15 minutes more uncovered to reduce the sauce down because my additions made it soupy.  I customized it to fit my sweet needs and it was fabulous.

I tried this recipe for Thanksgiving and Christmas and everyone absolutely loved it.  For the dried fruit I used dried cranberries, cherries and 2 prunes. I also pureed the pear and apple.  This will definitely be a staple at our holiday table and likely throughout the year!

WOW!  I am from New Zealand where we couldn't tell the difference between a cranberry and a loganberry (and who's heard of kiwifruit sauce with turkey....LOL!!) so I needed a recipe to get me through Christmas dinner in North America.  This recipe was easy and by far the most delicious thing on the table.  December 29th and we are still raving about it and eating it with anything we can.  Bravo!!

This recipe is as good as everyone said it was.  I added dried cherries instead of the mixture and they were perfect in this very flexible recipe.  I wish I could give it 6 stars.  Thanks for sharing this with us.  I'll be making this again.

I just made this and the next time I will cook cranberries for 15 minutes and then add the rest of fruit and nuts because I like it to be a little less mushy. It only needs to cook about 20 minuts. I also added a little red food color to make it a deeper color. The I put it in 3 pint canning jars and let them seal so I could store in refridgerator and usa for Thanksgiving and Xmas. It makes alot. I also had about a half a cup more and I'm going to see how it freezes. I will also grate thr orange peel and add that.

This is a great recipe and adds personality to something most people are used to getting out of a can.  I did have a bunch leftover (a little goes a long way), but I rubbed it over a pork roast and put it in my slow cooker for 8-10 hours.  Made a nice dinner, and I used up the cranberry sauce!  Thanks!

This is the 2nd year I will be making this sauce.  I used 1 small can of manderine oranges including the liquid instead of the pureed orange.  I used 1/4 less water at the start to compensate for the liquid added from the can.  My husband even had some and he hates cranberry sauce.

I made this for Christmas and thought it turned out great! It looked like the picture and tasted wonderful, however the large group I made it for didn't like it. Guess they are still stuck on the Canned Cranberry tradition. Maybe a good idea to introduce this to the traditional types by providing both styles! I give it 5 stars for thinking outside the box or in this case....the can!!!!

This is by far the best cranberry sauce I've had!  The only change I made to the recipe is to lightly toast the nuts and sprinkle them on top rather than boiling them with the other ingredients.  This small change gives it much better texture.

I do not like cranberry sauce but my husband does.  I started making this recipe 2 thanksgivings ago and every time I make it he says it is the best stuff I make!! Now I make it every year for Thanksgiving AND Christmas and even my family and my in-laws love it and ask for it.  I like it the 2nd day warmed up on a bagel or english muffin for breakfast.  Try this recipe--you won't regret it!

This is by far the best cranberry mixture I have ever had the pleasure of making and eating. The difference in this recipe is that there are all kinds of things. The "purist" cranberries (ie. cranberries, orange juice and sugar) are still wonderful, don't get me wrong! But to have such a decadent and surprising change will thrill your guests (if you are cooking for a party)! There are those who will always hate cranberries, but those who just "didn't care for them" before fall in love with them after this recipe. Try it out, and don;t be afraid to mix it up a bit with this recipe!

Absolutely delish!  I followed the recipe exactly, poured finished sauce over a block of cream cheese and served with crackers. The cream chz and sweet sauce really balanced each other well.  My husband nor I are cranberry sauce fans, but we're both a fan of this dish.

This is the best cranberry sauce recipe ever! If I only made one dish for the holidays, this would be it. It smells and tastes like Christmas.

this really is some great cranberry sauce! but it does make A LOT!! i used just a bag of trail mix from the dollar store, it didnt have nuts just dried fruit and that way it was a lot cheaper than going to the bulk bins. i got a lot of different dried fruits in the one bag and it was only $1!  i didnt peel the apple or pear, i just cut them into chunks, i didnt have any skins clinging to the back of my throat and it saved a lot of time. also instead of using a pureed orange, i just dumped the whole can of mandorin orange slices in with the juice and halved the sugar. i had to add about 3 tsp of flour to thicken it up though because of the added juice! like most of the other reviewers, i have been eating it on everything, and by the BOWL FULL!

This recipe is so DELICIOUS! I noticed some of the reviews said it was more fruity than a traditional cranberry sauce. Might I suggest that instead of dried mixed fruit you add dried cranberries! It gives it an extra cranberry kick and the dried cranberries plump up while cooking to give the sauce a nice texture!

I rated this recipe years ago and had to submit an update. I am asked to make this every Thanksgiving and Christmas. Here are the revisions I've made...I add fresh ginger and cloves along with the cinnamon and nutmeg. I omit the dried fruit and salt because I don't think they're necessary. Also I use walnuts instead of pecans and only use about 3/4 cup of organic pure cane sugar. A hit every time I make this!! Also found if there ARE leftovers this tastes great spread on toast! :-)

I didn't have dried fruit or use the pecans.  And I added about 1/2 of triple sec as it cooked.  Everyone absolutely loved it...even people who said they normally don't like cranberry sauce thought it was great.  Thanks Leeza!

Seems odd to me that people will significantly change a 5-star recipe and then give it fewer stars!  I've been making this for years and *every* time I serve it -- whether at home or at a potluck -- it's gone, gone, gone within mere minutes because it's an utterly delightful version!!!

I'm not sure why anyone would call this a trade secret as this is the recipe we all grew up eating in northern Minnesota. My grandmother who lived to be 97 passed this recipe on to me and I use this "fruit" sauce recipe one year and the next year I make my Mom's cranberry sauce and back and forth.My Iowa side of the family also uses the recipe. It's good but we like all cranberry and fruit sauces from many different sources. Happy Thanksgiving everyone-)

This is my Thanksgiving staple cranberry sauce recipe. The taste and texture are perfect and it makes enought that I follow Leeza's recommendation of serving it over a block of cream cheese with crackers for a appetizer and its OH-SO-YUMMY!!  Thank you for sharing!

Perfect!  Sweet like a dessert, many people who didn't like cranberry sauce said they thought this was great.  It is rich though, so most people only ate a few bites of it.  I made a single batch for 15 people and had about half leftover.

Family members who don't usually care for cranberries have had second helpings of this dish. I've made this as per the recipe, and it is great. 

The second time I made it, I added finely zested orange peel and substituted 1 teaspoon of Chinese 5-spice (cinnamon, cloves, anise, ginger, pepper) for the cinnamon. Both added interesting flavors.

This is a very good cranberry sauce.  I made it for Thanksgiving and several people that don't like cranberry sauce said this was outstanding. The recipe makes quite a bit though so if you're not actually feeding 12, you may want to scale it down a bit.  I had leftovers that did not get eaten.

This will be the 3rd holiday I make a 4x batch of this and give as gifts to teachers, daycare workers and co-workers.  And family.  And for me.  I save empty jelly & salsa jars all year long!  Very good warmed up on waffles.

This was delicious, and even people who said they didn't like cranberry sauce ate this at our dinner!  I took the advice of another reviewer and put the final product in the food processor on low pulse to blend everything together and to achieve a deep red color.  It was perfect, and the leftovers were great!

Made exactly as directed and thought it was good but my husband said it tasted 'weird'. I honestly don't know what to think of this, it is quite a bit of work and is definately not a 'sauce' but more of a chutney. I guess I will serve it on Thanksgivng anyway because it is different. One more thing, the appearance is not pretty, it is mushy and an odd color. And...there seems to be debate as to wether it is too sweet or too tart. That just depends on your particular taste. I thought it was just fine.

OH MY GOSH this is amazing.  The smell is intoxicating and the taste is to die for.  Seriously.  I made this to take to a Thanksgiving dinner and it almost didn't make it out of the house.  My husband and I were just eating it warm right out of the pot!  
I did take the advice of other raters and used the food processor - wouldn't do it any other way.  
This is so good I plan to make some every month this winter just to eat with my breakfast!  This is THE BEST cranberry sauce I have EVER, EVER had.

When I said to my husband, "Should I make cranberry sauce for Thanksgiving this year?" he just rolled his eyes and shook his head.  Luckily for us, I didn't listen to him -  I found this recipe!

Since I didn't have the dried fruit on hand, I used chopped dates and raisins instead.  I also didn't puree the oranges - I chopped them up coarsely along with the canned pears I had.

Cooking this makes the whole house smell wonderful!

We tried it right away on cream cheese - delish!  This is also fantastic in a roll-up sandwich with deli turkey, swiss, fresh spinach, cashews and dab of spicy brown mustard!

This is a keeper!

My wife likes to cook in a hurry, but I like to take my time and sample things along the way.

I just made this for the first time, but after reading the reviews I made sure that all of my fresh fruits were ripe.  The end result was great, everyone loved it, and we even served the remaining sauce over vanilla ice cream after dinner was over!  It was a great way to welcome autumn.

We love this so much that we've made it three  times since Christmas. Today I changed the recipe a little because I had apples and oranges that needed to  be  eaten.  I added four small oranges and three  small apples. Cut the sugar back to 2/3 cup.  Still delicious. Thank you for sharing!

This is the 2nd year I've used this recipe at Thanksgiving. The recipe is simple and the results are delish. Any leftovers can easily go on a bagel for a yummy breakfast or healthy snack.

Have used this preparation for many years now and always get amazing accolades. It is a staple at our Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners. Lately, I've noticed it is getting harder and harder to find dried mixed fruit bits on the grocery store counter.  For those of you that have Aldi in your area, there is an item called "dried fruit medley" which works great, but you have to take the dried banana chips out first.

Great sauce according to my guests. Doesn't look like the picture but still lovely. It does make a ton! Leftovers would be good over ice cream or spread on toast.

Very different and tangy with flavor.  I used orange juice instead of the whole orange; and powdered ginger instead of the nutmeg.  I decided to follow the advice of a previous reviewer to add the toasted nuts to the cooked sauce.  Really yummy!  Will make again.

I had this last year at my sister's house for Christmas.  I normally despise cranberry sauce, but had seconds of this!  I'm making it this year for Thanksgiving.  She had offered some tips for me, just one really.  She had made it with the full cup of sugar (splenda actually) and found that it was too sweet.  When she made it the second time, the one that we all ate, she only used 1/2 cup splenda.  It tasted awesome!  I can't even describe how good it was!

This really is phenomenal.  I made this for my husband's Thanksgiving pot luck lunch at work.  The only downside is that it is very sweet, so there were a lot of leftovers (which I was able to freeze and reuse later).

I made this for the first time for Thanksgiving this year. My family loved it and kept going back for more! I followed the recipe exactly as written. It turned out a little tart. The tartness could have just been the fresh cranberries. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing it.

made this sauce twice and both times a little different. It turned out just great both times. I always took 1/2 the sugar asked and added double the amount of cranberries (makes a beautiful color). I used rasins instead of dry fruit mix. Great recipe, my in-laws loved it too!!!

Delicious!  We all loved this Cranberry dish.  DH was scooping this up with dinner rolls after the meal.  I added the zest of the orange after the sauce was cooked.  I toasted the pecans and added them about 20 minutes before serving.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  This is a new favorite!  Thank you!!

It was good. I made it for my son, but he prefers my apple cranberry sauce. We had a lot of this leftover since cranberries are not everyone's favorite and the color of it is an ugly brown lol.

I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I used a Fuji apple, a large navel orange (CA), and a bartlett pear.  The dried fruit mix had cranberries, raisins, peaches and apple.  The result???? Too much nutmeg? Tatsed too much like apple sauce? I don't know what it is but it is not as good as I expected it to be.  My favorite recipe continues to be from a restaurant in Austin;they make their cranberry sauce to complement their wild game menu and it includes black pepper and jalapeños and sugar.

The perfect balance of sweet and tart. I've never had a cranberry sauce quite like this before; usually they're a little too tart for me. However, I used only about 3/4 cup of sugar, added orange zest, pureed a lemon alongside the orange and for a more autumn flavour 1/2 a teaspoon of allspice. Omitted the nuts. The end result also has a beautiful burgundy colour. I've prepared this in advance for Thanksgiving (which is tomorrow, here) as a few reviewers mentioned the flavours meld much more after refrigeration.

I skipped the dried fruit because I didn't think my group would go for that.  I only used 1/2 c. sugar and 1/2 c. Splenda because we have diabetics in the family.  I added the nuts after everything cooked to keep them crunchy.  I reduced the spices by half.  Everyone loved this.  I have never had all the cranberry sauce eaten before, but this dish was cleaned!

OH MAN!  THIS IS GOOD!!  I made it as written except that I used Splenda for all but one tablespoon of the sugar.  It's the night before Thanksgiving and if I had another pear I would make a double batch. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

I like this recipe b/c there are so many ways to make it your own. You can use different dried fruits and other combos of stuff to individualize it. 

From the basic recipe I only altered a little. I used 1 cup OJ instead of water. I didn't measure the cinnamon or nutmeg, just sprinkled till it looked like enough. I used 1/2 cu brwn and 1/2 cu white sugar (only b/c I really like brown sugar). I used 1/2 cu dried apricots b/c it seemed to get the best reviews and then 1/2 cu Welch's mixed dried fruit. I used canned pears and canned mandarin oranges and a fresh apple, all chopped really small. I did not put it in the processor as I like the chunky texture and don't want it soupy or creamy. Tastes great right out of the pot and can't wait to try it after it has been in fridge over night. Would not add coloring b/c it is still quite red and tastes very much of cranberries. Definitely worth trying!!

Great recipe.  I made a quadruple batch for a large party.  I cut down the apple and pear by 1/4, and substituted orange juice for the water and oranges.  Also left out the nuts in case of an allergy.  Honestly I wish I'd cut the apple, pear, orange flavor, and cinnamon in half, in order to maintain a stronger cranberry flavor.  Also, I cooked it uncovered for 10 minutes after bringing it to a boil just like a "traditional" cranberry recipe and it set-up great.

A big WOW!  My entire family loved this recipe.  I used dried mango and apricots for the dried fruit...Loved the consistency...this sauce was the star of what can be a rather mundane turkey dinner....will probably bring it to mom's again this Thanksgiving...

Not your traditional cranberry sauce from the can.  If that's what you're looking for, try a different recipe.  This is for those that want a fruit sauce to complement meats, or to top ice cream, waffles, biscuits, etc.  It's absolutely the BEST!!!

I'll have to try this as an appetizer over cream cheese, 'cause I have LOTS of leftovers.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The flavor was good, but it didn't complement the turkey.  (You know, like mint jelly is to lamb or wasabi is to sushi)  The mix of flavors & textures was too complicated to be a 'sauce'.  When eating I kept thinking, "this would make a good pie filling."  Hopefully, it freezes well & I can use it for New Year's with crackers...

I made this last night for today's Thanksgiving feast.  I have always made my own cranberry sauce, usually with walnuts, red wine, etc.  I really liked this as did my 12 guests.  I doubled the recipe and made a tubful!  I bought dried apricots, mangos, and pineapples in the bulk section of the product dept.  Dicing them small enough took some time.  The spices were perfect.  The color was fine.  I simmered it for at least 3 hours, stirring often. I froze the leftovers.  I'm sure they'll come in handy in the weeks to come!  Yes, I will make this again.  Thanks for sharing Leeza.

Overall a great recipe that was enjoyed by all.  While preparing be sure not to be stingy with the sugar.  You may want to omit the pecans altogether or at least make sure they are finely chopped.  I found that the crunch of the pecans didn't match the smooth texture of the sauce.

People went CRAZY over this dish. I served it for Thanksgiving. My mom said she could not believe how good this was - the best she has ever had (she stressed that over and over and over again). Everybody LOVED this dish. I was surprised to see such a big fuss made over one dish of all the really good dishes I had for Thanksgiving.

This was the best-tasting cranberry sauce I've ever had in my life!  It's crunchy with nuts and has a wonderful texture and flavor -- and everyone wanted seconds, including my husband (who has always says he "hates" cranberry sauce!)

I made this for Thanksgiving '14 and it was good, but didn't measure up to expectations based on the rave reviews.  Mine was kinda tart. I realize that is most likely a function of the ingredients, namely the cranberries I used, but nonetheless...  

METHOD: I doubled the recipe and used fresh cranberries, bosc pears, gala apples and 1 small can of mandarin oranges and 1 fresh orange. The dried fruits came from the Whole Foods bulk section - a mix of blueberries, currants, raisins, cherries and a tiny smidge of sweetened cranberries. I chose not to add nuts. I did reduce it down longer than the recipe called for, as my preference was for a thicker consistency, but other than the mandarin oranges and reducing down part, kept true to the recipe.  

SERVING: poured it over cream cheese (yum!) for an appetizer and served the sauce on the table for our meal.  

TASTE: While it was tasty, it didn't wow me, so I'd give it a 3.5 - 4 star rating. Probably closer to a 3.5 as a stand-alone side and a 4.5 on top of cream cheese, after all, doesn't cream cheese make anything taste good? ;-) I will try this again because I have confidence it the recipe, but will monitor and adjust sugar up or down according to my taste. Still...a heck of a lot better than canned stuff!

Instead of dried mixed fruit, I used dried cranberries only.  I served this at Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.   It was good on leftover turkey and ham sandwiches, too.  Beautiful color.  Easy to make.

This was the best! So simple. I put everything in the crock pot on low overnight, used my hand blender/immersion blender for a few quick pulses to break up the big chunks in the morning and let it cool. Great by itself and over cream cheese with crackers. Could easily be transferred into canning jars from the crock pot and then processed in a hot water bath if you wanted to can.

This was fantastic. I did make a few modifications based on what I had lying around: used a grapefruit instead of an orange, added a tablespoon of orange juice concentrate to get the orangey flavour back in there, used a cup of mixed berry applesauce in place of the apple and pear, and the dried fruits were all dried apricots. All other ingredients were as shown in the recipe.
I used a hand blender to puree the dried apricots, applesauce, grapefruit, orange juice concentrate, and pecans, stirred that in with the boiling sugar water (used xylitol instead of sugar because I'm diabetic), let that simmer for a while and then stirred in the remaining ingredients to simmer again for about 40 minutes. It smelled lovely and tasted amazing.
If I were to make it again, I think the only things I would modify are to add a bit more sugar (xylitol in my case) to cut the tartness of the cranberries and citrus a bit more, maybe toss a few prunes into the dried fruit for smoothness, and I'd probably leave the nuts in pieces like the recipe says instead of blending them since they added a grittiness that wasn't entirely pleasant.
You'll note that I'm still giving it 5 stars though! Try this recipe, you won't regret it!

instead of using water I used orange juice and instead of fresh fruit I used canned  diced pears, pineapple and peaches. The apples were frozen along with the cranberries. Everyone loved the recipe and had seconds, was really fantastic.

This stuff is the bomb! Have made it for several years now and just reviewing it. I double the recipe, which makes a lot, but always better to have extra for all the leftover holiday turkey.  No need to dirty the blender/food processor to puree an orange. Just use canned mandarin orange with the juice. The small orange segments break down just fine during the long cooking process.  I stick with dried apricots instead of dried mixed fruit as a personal preference. Have had many people ask for the recipe when taking to holiday dinners.

If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would! So delicious. Tried making it with half the sugar as suggested in some of the reviews, but it was way too tart, so I ended up adding the rest that the recipe calls for, and it was perfect. Not too sweet. I used a tropical fruit mix and it was great. The pecans make it!

This is absolutely delicious!!! I made it exactly as written minus the pecans because I'm allergic. I made it tonight because Thanksgiving is in the morning, and I could not believe it was so delicious I was sneaking bites by the spoonful. It makes a big bowl full so there will be plenty, but I NEVER eat cranberry sauce, so me eating it by the spoonful says a lot!!!! This will be my recipe from now on. Thank You so much.

I made this tonight for Thanksgiving tomorrow. I have never written a review on here, but signed up to comment on this. I do not even like cranberries...at all. By themselves, sauce, juice... but I knew there had to be a way to make them delicious. I literally googled "cranberry sauce for people that don't like cranberry sauce" and stumbled on this recipe. The 400+ reviews told me this was it. SO easy and SO delicious! I decided it did sound like something that would be better the next day after the flavors merry, so that's what I am doing. It was WONDERFUL tonight, so it can only get better for tomorrow. I followed the recipe except I added about 1/4 cup brown sugar in addition to the cup of white sugar, and I did not add any dried fruit because I was so puzzled at the store about which dried fruit to buy. I also used 1 small can of mandarin oranges instead of a whole orange. I blended the oranges to a pulp. None of the combinations of packaged dried fruits sounded good in this, and let me tell ya, this is NOT lacking. So cinnamon-y... I read on here some people used less sugar, there is no way I would use less sugar next time. Its perfect. Still a little tart, but more sweet than tart. The side by side picture I posted is when I first put it in the pan on the left (beautiful that way too...) and on the right is the completed sauce. I did need to cook it a little more than 30 minutes because it needed to cook down some. This will definitely be a new holiday staple!

Good but on the orangey tangy tasting side.  Will try with just water next time.

I omitted the nuts and added some allspice because we like it in cranberry sauce. I always serve this warm over a brick of cold cream cheese, with crackers, and it's a huge hit. Thanks for sharing!

I gave this 4 stars because had I followed the recipe exactly, the sweetness would've been overwhelming! I used only 1/4 cup of sugar and it was perfectly tangy and sweet! I also used orange juice instead of water for a bit more punch, and walnuts rather than pecans simply because that is what I had on hand. But everyone who tried it liked it! It wasn't very appetizing-looking, but I talked a lot of people into it and they really liked it. Great with the Thanksgiving turkey :)

Holiday Hit!  I came home with an empty bowl.  I added a little extra triple sec to help boost the orange flavor and finish off a bottle.  I also did not use as much sugar and added a few extra truvia packets at the end.  It was great!

Everyone at the Thanksgiving table loved this sauce.  Only thing I omitted was the nuts, as I have some relatives who are not fond of nuts in their food.  Still amazing without them.  Will make this again!

I have made this recipe for the last two Thanksgiving dinners and everyone loves it. Every year everyone requests that I make this special cranberry sauce. For the chopped dry fruit I use dried apricots and raisins. Also, I will put half the mixture in the food processor, pulse it a few times and add the finely chopped to the cooked portion. All the family says that my sauce makes the whole holiday feast so much better. I might try the crock pot method but I not sure if I should make any changes as it is great as it is.

I tried this for this year's Thanksgiving dinner, and it didn't really go over all that well.  Hardly anyone tried it, I guess because it looked different from the usual cranberry sauce.  I thought it tasted very good, though, and my husband liked it too.  I couldn't find diced dried fruit, and so substituted golden raisins.  I didn't add the nuts, as I didn't want it to be too much like a chutney.  I don't think using the dried fruit would have made the looks much more appealing.  But I was sorry that no one tried it, as it really tasted pretty good.  Think I'll probably make just the regular cranberry sauce next time, but it was fun to try this different recipe.

I made this much like the recipe, though omitting the pear. Plus, because I didn't have the mixed fruit, I used raisins and chopped apricots as a substitute. And, I diced the peeled orange instead of pureeing it. However, I thought it turned out nasty - much too mushy. I was hoping for a Cranberry Sauce I had made in the past that was chunky and very tasty. No one took any of mine, at a family Thanksgiving Dinner, so I brought it home, probably to eventually dump. Guess I'll keep looking for the one I really want. Thanks anyway. I'm sure many will enjoy this version of a holiday Cranberry Sauce.

This sauce was great. I made to for Christmas dinner and it was simple to make and it was so yummy. For the dried fruit I had dried strawberries and blueberries. I know they are not the fruits you think of at Christmas time, but I was late getting to the store and it was all the had. Anyway, the blueberries were SO good. They complimented the cranberries so well. I thought that I wouldn't be able to taste them, but they were the second thing people tasted. It was very good and went very well with turkey.

This is the best I've had.  I've been cooking over 40 years years and replaced canned strawberry sauce as a teenager.  I've tried many recipes and just tossed my 'keepers' for this one!

The texture of all the various fruits and nuts combined made this a wonderful recipe!  It was easy to make and delicious to eat.  Had to let mine simmer about 40 minutes for all the cranberries to burst.

I really liked it, but most people didn't eat it. My husband's family's not very adventurous so I should've known better. More left overs for me! I also liked it on a bagel with cream cheese.

My cousin who doesn't even like cranberry sauce enjoyed this. For the mixed fruit I bought a bag that had a bunch of different kinds so it just wasn't one type.

Good but not tart as one would expect a cranberry dish to be. I imagine the dried fruit added a lot of sweetness. I added a half can of store-bought cranberry sauce to bring back a little tartness to the dish.

This was amazing! Made for Thanksgiving and even those who don't like cranberries like it. I used a can of drained madarin oranges instead of an orange. Other than that, I followed the recipe. By the way, the colors were beautiful. This is a very attractive dish as well as spectacular!

This recipe always puts me in a holiday mood! Consider adding some dried mango cut into small pieces and/or some halved frozen strawberries for a slightly different effect. The recipe is very adaptable to whatever fruit you have in the house. Warm the leftovers up a little and put over ice cream or cut up some fresh apples in it to thin it out and bake up a fruit crisp. TUVM and Happy Holidays.

I have been using this recipe for about 3 years now.  It is by far the best cranberry sauce I have ever tasted.  It has such a delicious, fresh flavor.  I could eat this all by itself but it is the perfect complement to my Thanksgiving (and Christmas) menus.  I have given the recipe to friends who also love it and who have also passed it on.  Guaranteed to please!

I made this for the first time at Thanksgiving this year and EVERYONE raved!  This was especially good for people that don't like the super-tang of straight cranberries.  I also love the texture that the nuts gave to it.  I've already been asked to make this again for Christmas this year!

This is the best cranberry sauce I've had. I made this for my first Thanksgiving dinner & even my husband who is a meat & potatoes only guy loved it. It was so incredibly easy. I just put everything in one pot & let it cook down for 30 minutes. I thought about pulsing it in a food processor like other suggestions but the color came out so beautiful that I didn't want to mess with it. Next time I will probably dice the fruit a little smaller. Using dried fruit mix with apricots gave it a great sweet & tangy taste. This is definitely my recipe for cranberry sauce from now on.

Upon seeing my children shovel this sauce into their mouths like jello, it was clear that this is new cranberry sauce tradition for our family.  

Instead of water, I used orange juice.  Also added orange zest and omitted nuts.  Next time I will cut down on cinnamon just a bit.  Wonderful recipe.

Wonderful flavor, especially after it sits for a few days.  I left out the nuts because some guests don't like nuts, but it was wonderful.  I cut the oranges in chunks and used raisins and dried cherries. I gave the recipe to several people after great compliments.  Thanks very much.

Good! All of the fresh fruit in this is what separates the taste from the canned kind. It's not as fast to make, but I made mine a day in advance and it was great. I served it cold, so next time, I'll try it nice and warm!

A bunch of Canadians enjoyed an American Thanksgiving dinner tonight... we quite enjoyed this cranberry sauce.  I left out the pecans (didn't seem quite right to me to have nuts in a cranberry sauce) and I also omitted the dried fruit -- it was FANTASTIC!

Fantastic recipe.  Easily doubles.  You can leave out the dried fruit or nuts if desired and it is still great!  I have also made with 1/2 Splenda and 1/2 sugar with great results.

I just made this recipe and it is SO DELISH!  It isn’t very sauce-like though, but who cares!  It is unlike any other.   I did add twice the amount of cranberries though.  Halfway through cooking, I noticed the cranberry flavor was being drowned out by all the other fruit.  I am very interested to see how it goes over at the thanksgiving table.  If you are a huge fan of the canned stuff, know that this isn’t anything like it, but doesn’t mean you won’t like this!

I made this for a couple of years now. I love it as it's written. This year I zapped it a few seconds in my food processor to blend the flavors just a bit. I mean just a FEW seconds. It can smooth out really quickly and the great thing about this is the texture of it. I really liked it this way....just slightly less chunky. I suppose you could skip this if you were careful when you dice the apples and pear, and make sure that the pecans are little bits. Thanks for this great recipe.

I don't bother pureeing the orange or adding the salt. I also have used canned pears and added a little bit of cloves. Also, some red wine and a little butter adds a bit of richness. Very good recipe.

Outstanding recipe! I made this when I had to host my first family Thanksgiving. Several of my family members who claimed not to like cranberry sauce loved it! Will use this recipe again (and certainly never buy that canned jelly stuff ever again). Leftovers even freeze well. Thanks!

this was excellent!! i'm a college student and my mom has always made the same things for xmas dinner including canned cranberries so this year i took over dinner and wanted real cranberries on the table. i followed this recipe exactly using raisins as my dried fruit and it was amazing. just the smell of the kitchen after cooking this was worth it. i got rave review for my dinner and this cranberry sauce definitely was a hit. i will make this again and again in many different ways as it is very versatile as well...would be great with apples in a pie!!

Absolutely outstanding recipe! I made this just prior to Thanksgiving intending to bring some to SIL's house and hubby and I finished it off over a few days instead. I just made another batch for my Christmas Day meal tomorrow and it tastes just as wonderful. I used 2 apples the first time (didn't have a pear) and this morning I didn't have any apples but had a can of apple pie filling on hand. I diced up those canned apples and reduced the sugar called for to 1/2 cup. I juiced the orange and grated the rind instead doing the pureeing. For the 1 cup mixed dried fruit I used what I used the first time: 1/2 cup diced dried figs (

I am not a big cranberry sauce lover, but I was eating this all on its own.  I only had dried cranberries and raisins on hand, and they tasted wonderful.  Next time I'd like to try different dried fruits, just to see how the taste can vary.  It was tart, but the sweetness of the pear and apple really balanced it out. I omitted the pecans due to a nut allergy, and it was still very tasty.  I usually have leftovers with the canned stuff, but people were asking to take what little was left, home with them in containers.  We all loved it.

This was my first experience actually cooking cranberries. I had an unexpected houseful and was worried, but no fear, this recipe is absolutely wonderful!! The instructions are simple and easy to follow. I didn't change a thing. Everybody thought the recipe was great and my mother-in-law asked for the recipe. This is a definitely going to be used again and again! Thank you!!

This recipe was a big hit at the Thanksgiving table and was also a hit at a post-Thanksgiving party.  In that case, I served it over cream cheese (with crackers on the side).

Like many others, I didn't like cranberry sauce when growing up, because it came out of a can.  But THIS recipe is SUPERB!  I absolutely love its textures and tastes, and also the crunchiness of the nuts.  I am planning on serving it with a pork roast tonight and expect rave reviews from my guests.

I brought this to an office potluck lunch today, served on a block of cream cheese.  It was very good, and many good comments.  I did not use the dried fruit bits either, and didn't miss them.  Could use walnuts or even slivered almonds I think, in place of pecans.  I thought it might be good served over a round of Brie too.  The color was drab - not brilliant red like I would have liked.  I don't know what caused that - looked more like the color of cooked rhubarb.  But still - an excellent and unusual way to serve cranberries.

I enjoyed the mixture of the tastes and textures in this sauce!  I actually strained it to make a smooth sauce by picking out the chunks of apples and pears after they cooked, then straining the berries.  My kids don't typically like cranberry sauce, but this has gone over very well!

This is not the quickest cranberry sauce out there but it sure is good. Everyone who tasted it had seconds. It even won over canned sauce lovers. Suggestion: try it over pancakes or waffles as an alternative to syrup. It's delicious!

I have made this for years.  It's such an easy recipe and everyone always asks for the recipe.  This will be the 9th year I've made it...always amazing.  It's easy to change too as a base recipe - add more fruit of your choice or less, more or less cinnamon to your liking, some brown with the white sugar, etc.  
Delicious on all meats, toast or just out of the refrigerator.  Stores well - and blends as it stores.  Even if you don't like cranberries...I think you'll like this one!

This is addictive and so easy to make. You will be scraping the bottom of your cooking dish. I followed directions with a few changes. 

Threw all ingredients in the  slow cooker & cooked on low for five hours. Do leave in for full five hours as it takes a long time for nutmeg flavor to diffuse - tried the sauce half way through and did not like strong nutmeg flavor, however at the end of five hours it was imperceptible.

1) Instead of cup of water: 1/4 cup #Cheribundi Tart cherry juice (cold) + 3/4 c boiling water. I think any fruit juice would work.
2) 1/2 cup of sugar instead of a cup as recommended by others.  Dissolved the sugar in the hot liquid before adding to slow cooker. 
3) Used dried Cherry Fruit Medley bits from a local produce store which included equal amounts of chopped cherries, peaches, pears, golden raisins, apricots
4) For my pear, used a ripe Bosc

The best ever!! I have never had cranberry sauce before, honestly the sight of the canned cranberry was never appealing to me. So when I saw this recipe I thought, it's just to beautiful not to give it a try and I am so glad I did. My husband is an exceptional cook and he couldn't get enough of it.

I've been a member of this site for several years and this is my first rating because this is an amazing recipe. I followed it to the 'T' the first time, which is why I gave it the five stars; however, I have adapted it multiple times and the base recipe has been found to be extremely flexible. Canned mandarin oranges is a must substitute. I increase the cinnamon and add allspice, ginger, and any other 'Fall' type seasonings on hand - all of which I measure by sight and smell. I've also begun to use cranberry dried fruit and then toss in some frozen blackberries, bing cherries and blueberries depending on what I have on hand that I froze during the summer. The recipe is amazing standing on its own as a side dish and/or also smothering cream cheese for a cracker dip. It freezes excellent and we make a few batches to freeze in single serving for throughout the year. Last, I am all about making life easier so I throw everything in the pot in large chunks, cook, cool and take a mixer to it to blend flavors and chop fruit chunks further - no need to puree anything :)

This drew rave praises from my mother and mother-in-law. They loved the crunch of the pecans. Saves very well!  I have also substituted 1/2 cup apple juice (and hve used o.j as well)for 1/2 of the water. KIDS LOVED IT!

This is similar to what I do. The spices change as to what I have on hand. (ground cloves, allspice, Chinese 5 spice ect) I don't add the nuts to the simmer, I chop them and add as a topping once done. Also, I use straight orange juice, 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of 1 cup white. The brown gives depth, and using the orange juice you don't need as much sugar. In fact I forgot the sugar once and the orange juice had enough that it was just fine.

Going to have to give this one another try seeing as I confused dried mixed fruit with candied fruit. Just a note though, if your even thinking of using candied fruit….. even by mistake, DON'T! Feel free to laugh amongst yourselves.

This one was a Thanksgiving surprise!  So simple to make and all of our guests, even the kids, raved and raved!  Personally, I am accustomed to cranberry sauce being a tad tart; whereas this recipe turned out so sweet that it had a "candied" taste to it.  It is definitely a keeper, but I'll try less sugar next time.

Excellent, I had to add a little more water as it cooked. I had to use a spoon to pop about 10 of the berries. But this is excellent!!! I'll never by store prepared again...This is a winner!!!

Love this recipe-  Make it every year!  I am however, very bad about measuring.  I did measure the sugar and water(my son has Type 1 Diabetes and we need to keep track of carbs!)  This year I used a bag of cranberries I have thrown in the freezer a couple months ago, as well as a handful of frozen blueberries we had picked this summer.  Dried fruit was mostly apricots and prunes that I diced up.  That's the GREAT thing about this, you can play with what fruit you put in, and how much and it ALWAYS turns out GREAT!

I have been making this cranberry sauce since 2004!  It's that good!  My guests loved that it had more texture than traditional cranberry sauce.  Everytime I make it I receive tons of compliments!

I used a mix of cherries, cranberries, blueberries and golden raisins for the dried fruit, which was great. The blueberries added a nice bit of color. This was delicious, and even better the next day. I thought there was a bit too much cinnamon when I tried it before it had completely cooled, but by the next morning was perfectly spiced. I had it for breakfast! Update: Very adaptable to what you've got on hand. For my second batch, I was out of pears, so I used fresh pineapple and rather than peeling and processing an orange, I used mandarin oranges. Turned out great! I topped a bagel with cream cheese and this cranberry sauce, which made an incredibly good breakfast!

After making this I am no longer allowed to buy canned cranberry sauce every again. 

I did make it the night before and had to reheat and smash it with a potato masher the next day because it was way too chunky, so probably something I did wrong, but it still tasted oh so good!!!

Up until 2011, my family grumbled about our boring cranberry sauce (from a can, usually), so before Thanksgiving I found this recipe and decided to make it. My entire family loves this recipe, which is saying something when most of them aren't too fond of cranberry sauce to begin with! It's also excellent on toast for breakfast if you happen to have any leftovers.

This is the best cranberry sauce!   Everyone loved this sauce.  I had people asking to take some home with them.  They ate this with dinner and I put some on neufchatel cheese and they ate it with crackers.

This was a huge hit!

One of the best cranberry sauce recipes I've found! This is so delicious. It tastes like the filling of a pie, and it's just the right texture. Being that it was a recipe I grabbed at the last moment, I used none of the fruit other than the cranberries themselves, and it was still amazing. Next time I make it, I'll be adding the apple and the pear, for certain. Also, I used slightly less sugar. This dish not only is yummy and pretty on your Thanksgiving table, but it also makes great preserves on English muffins for breakfast!

I made this at thanksgiving and it is very awesome. Sweet tangy..good enough to eat with a spoon. I just mashed up with a fork rather than puree it though. We liked it chunky ourselves..very very good.

Wonderful!  Made night before Thanksgiving.  Turned out delicious.  The only thing I did differently was to use a small can of mandarin oranges (pureed per recipe) instead of an orange.  Love the spices.  I bought one cup of dried friuit from the bulk section.  It had pineapple, apple, mango, apricots and cranberries in it.  This is a great recipe.  If you are thinking of trying it, do it! You wont be sorry.  I could see how this would also be good over cream cheese on crackers.

Years ago I made this cranberry sauce recipe - it was for a Thanksgiving Luncheon at work.  Many dishes were entered into "The Best of . . . " contest - and I won for the best cranberry sauce.  So, I always say that I am going to make may award winning cranberry sauce.  BTW, it was the first time I ever made cranberry sauce - it's fabulous.  It freezes beautifully, so that you can enjoy it year round.  I put it in a pretty container, and I give it as a gift during the holidays too.  K

Way better than traditional sauce.  I diced the apples and pears a little too big so they were a bit chunky so keep your preference in mind for this.  Also, if you use tart dried fruit - you probably shouldn't reduce sugar like other reviewers mentioned unless you like really tart.

Was the highlight of our thanksgiving.  A lot of people didnt like the tradidtional Canned cranberry suce but they loved this dish.  It is a sweet dish and people even suggested it as a topping with vanila ice cream.  Wouldnt change a thing because I liked the sweetness but just be aware.

This recipe came the closest to my Mom's which was delicious.  I tripled the recipe and made it last night for my office Thanksgiving luncheon today (50+).  I won the contest for best cranberry sauce!  I am passing along the recipe to my co-workers.

I'm rating the "idea" of this recipe. I had to work with what I had which was - 1/2 a 12 oz bag of fresh crans, 1 can of whole cran sauce. I sm can of mandarin oranges & sm can of pears.  I drained the mandarin juice into the fresh cranberries (with a splash of water) and added my peeled diced apple. Used fresh grated nutmeg & cinammon. After that cooked I pureed with a stick blender. I cut the mandarin oranges in half, diced up the drained canned pears and added that along with more cinnamon and a tsp of fresh ginger and ground coriander. Added the can of whole cranberries. Mixed all that up on the stovetop and let it simmer for 10 minutes. I think using the juice from mandarin oranges along with the canned pears & the apple; gave it plenty sweet. Oh...I added  1/4 C of golden raisins during initial cooking before pureed. No other dried fruit was used in my rendition.  Anyway, was a great starting point that you can toy with. Love the spices in it! I found it tasted even better sitting it the fridge overnight. I gotta try this on some cream cheese with a bagel, that sounds really good.

At first taste I wasn't convinced since this sauce doesn't have a strong cranberry flavor.  However, it won rave reviews at Thanksgiving and the leftovers made the yummiest topping for French pancakes.  I plan to keep this for future Thanksgivings.  For dried fruit I used apricots, cherries and golden raisins.

This was the first from scratch cranberry sauce I ever made, and I will make it from now on.  My whole family loved it, even my husband, who usually can't stand cranberry sauce.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, except that I left out the nuts and used orange juice instead of lemon.  It was perfect, not to sweet and not to sour.

OUTSTANDING. This has become a tradition in our home. I also use a food processor, as many of the reviewers have recommended.

I used to hate whole berry cranberry sauce, the sauce that came in a can.  This is absolutely superb, and I will never buy cranberry sauce again unless I get in a pinch and can't find fresh berries!  I made this for Thanksgiving, and doubled the recipe.  I froze what was left in a quart-size zipper freezer bag and used it for Christmas dinner.  It was as good as fresh!  The only thing I changed was to add some allspice to the recipe. The next time I make it, I plan to cut the sugar by half, because it was too sweet for my taste.  I like the tartness of the berries to contrast a bit with the sweetness.  This was so outstanding!  Thanks for submitting the recipe!

made this for thanksgiving 2009 & will make it again for x'mas.  I didn't change a thing and it was a huge hit!  It's a little more work then just adding fresh cranberries to boiled water /sugar....but totally worth it.

Awesome, first time ever making cranberry sauce and everyone loved it. I did use double the liquid, omitted the dried fruit and next time would cut down the sugar. This recipe is a keeper!

This was very good.  The only change I made was to add about 1/2 c of orange juice instead of the pureed orange.  We mixed some of the left overs with oatmeal - yum!  Excellent on a cold morning.

Made at Thanksgiving and 2 guys who never really like cranberry sauce loved it. I'm a cranberry purist, so I was skeptical, but this is how I will always make it. I used a hand chopper on the other fruits, used 1 c. of mixed dried fruits (minus the bananas) - the raisins came out delicious, and halved the sugar. Will probably use a few more cranberries next time, but I like it tart.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and could not believe how fabulous it tasted!  It got rave reviews from the family.  I initially forgot to add the dried mixed fruit and realized that was why it seemed like it needed a little more sugar.  Adding the dried fruit balanced the sweet with the tart of the cranberries.  When I make again I'll probably just add a little more sugar if I don't have the dried fruit.  JUST YUMMY!!

I just tasted this and it is indeed an extraordinary sauce.  I did give it a few pulses with my immersion blender to blend in the fruit just a little more, but other than that went right be the recipe.  If you're looking for a last minute dish for the big day this is it!

This is a delicious and simple cranberry sauce.  Following another review, I used a can of orange segments (drained) in place of the orange.  I also used orange Craisins for the dried fruit to emphasize the orange and cranberry flavors.  It is so good, I couldn't stop eating it as it cooled!

Thank you for this recipe!  This was my first attempt at homemade cranberry sauce, and I'm very happy with the results!  If the flavors taste this good right now, I can only imagine how this is going to taste for Thanksgiving dinner in two days!  I'm hungry for Thursday!!  :)

I have been making this dish for the past three years for Christmas and Thanksgiving.  It is by far better than ANY cranberry sauce my family and friends ever had.  MANY people asked me for the recipe, I refused.  I need a signature dish to bring to holiday parties.  You must try it!

This is by far the best cranberry sauce I have ever tasted. My brother asks for a double batch of it every year. It's a total hit! It is also great for those leftover turkey sandwhiches the day after Thanksgiving or even just on some toast in the morning with your coffee.

I made this for Thanksgiving. I added slightly less sugar (3/4 cup), 1/8 tsp nutmeg (because a little bit goes a long way!), an apple, a pear, 2 Satsumas, nd crystallized ginger, and it was fabulous! Even people who don't like cranberry sauce loved it! It's the best cranberry sauce I've ever tasted.

This would make an excellent pie filling!

Did a double batch, some for work and some for Turkey day and still had over half leftover.  Froze the remainder for Christmas.

THIS IS SOOOOOO GOOD!!!!  I made this for my family for Thanksgiving who normally does not like anything out of the "ordinary" and who does not like cranberry sauce but serves the canned cranberry jelly stuff just to have it.  My sister had given me a bag of fresh cranberries and I wanted to make fresh cranberry sauce but something different not the same old thing.  I came upon this recipe and decided to give it a try based on the other reviews and let me tell you I am so happy I did.  Not only did I love it but my husband who does not like any cranberry sauces of any kind love it too and my picky family raved about it!  I made a few changes though I left out the pear, dried fruit and nutmeg since I did not have any on hand and it was still WONDERFUL!!  I highly recommend this cranberry sauce you will not regret it.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe with the rest of us!

Mine looked just like the pic. Made it a week before T'giving and canned it in a mason jar, warmed some and poured over cream cheese for an appetizer.  It was a HUGE hit!!!

I made this last year and just noticed it again on my way to find a different recipe for this year.  I thought it was fantastic, but I was in the minority, since I was about the only one out of at least a dozen people who even ate it.  If you make this, be prepared for picky eaters, because it doesn't look like traditional cranberry sauce.  It does taste really good, in my opinion, but more apple-ish than cranberry.  As I said, I liked it, but ended up having to freeze most of it and share with someone else later, who also thought it was really good.  Since no one else agreed with me enough to eat it, I have to give it less stars, because it took so many ingredients only to sit all Thanksgiving dinner.

My family and I can't get enough of this cranberry sauce!  I personally hated the canned cranberry sauce, and was hesitant to try this, but for someone who dislikes cranberries, this sauce was incredible! We very much enjoy this over cream cheese with Ritz crackers, a great treat!

I really liked this recipe. I used dried apricots for the "dried fruit," and put it in my food processor. Turned out great.

I have to say I was a bit nerveous about trying this recipe because I knew I wouldn't have time to make a test run before Thanksgiving day and I come from a family of gifted cooks so I really wanted it to truly be "extraordinaire".  This recipe was veryyyy GOOD!.... Everyone kept asking how I made it and when I described the recipe it sounded as though I took time to make it this good... but it really wasn't that bad.  I would probebly put a little less nutmeg.  VERY GOOD!! I would tell everyone to make this.... it's my new Holiday dish!!!

This recipe was a huge hit at thanksgiving, BUT I don't know who decided how many servings this was. Making the recipe to use an entire bag of cranberries (12 oz) made sense, but it was about 5 times as much cranberry sauce than 12 people needed. We're now looking for some creative ways to reuse/resurrect the rest of this sauce...maybe some sorbet? or something similar and frozen.

This was great!  A huge hit on Thanksgiving and something a bit different from the regular cranberry sauces I have made in the past.  Everyone loved it.  I would definitely make it again.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Did not change a thing.

This is a yummy holiday recipe. It makes your house smell so good! My brother in law requests it every year now, so it's fast becoming a holiday tradition to have this cranberry sauce on top of a block of cream cheese with various crackers all around for appetizers before the big meal. We love it!

This is indeed a wonderful recipe. I got sick and tired of being served the infamous can of sauce, so I gave this recipe a try tonight for Thanksgiving. I can't believe the recipe states it serves 12 ppl! Noone I know has more than a few tbs. per serving to go with their turkey dinner. That said, I would half the recipe next time around. There was so much left over! That's okay, I will spread this cranberry sauce on my breakfast bagel with cream cheese. I taste as I go, and I added a little more sugar, some brown sugar, and a hint of cinnamon. This will be my modified standard recipe for all holidays to come!

WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This was so great.  I knew from the minute I was cooking this that I was making something special.  My entire family raved about the taste.  I added a bit more chopped pecans and pulsed the finished product in the food processor a couple times to create a slightly smoother finish.  This was the hit of the dinner.  We now have a new family "must-have" for our holiday dinners.  Thank you for this recipe.

If you are looking for a cranberry recipe for your holiday table look no further.  I just finished putting this cranberry sauce together for tomorrow's thanksgiving dinner and it was so easy and the results are amazing.  I followed with recipe exactly with two exceptions - I did not add the pecans (as my husband doesn't care for them) and instead of a mixture of dried fruit I used a 6oz package of dried Apricots.  Delicious!

This was good but I will play with it a little to get it to our taste.Followed some other sugg and it was still pretty tart...the apple and fruit totally made it though.Also a little strong on the cinnamon we thought maybe 1/2 cinn and 1/4 nutmeg next time(and I love nutmeg)Good though and worth the try if you havent made before.

Loved it. It may take an extra 15 minutes to get the apples soft. I plan to use walnuts instead of pecans next time.

I used walnuts instead of pecans and it turned out wonderfully.

Next time I will tone down the sugar a bit, this was much too sweet but still yummy!

This was fantastic!  I took advice from other people to make a few changes.  I added a can of mandarin oranges, a pinch of allspice and ginger, and ran it through a food processor when it was finished cooking.  Rave reviews from entire family!  (Including people who don't normally eat cranberries.)  Loved it, loved it, loved it.

I've made this recipe for the last three Thanksgivings.  I think I'm going to have to make it for the rest of my life because everyone loves it.  I change the amounts and dried fruit I put in it and it always turns out great.  Very different from anything I've had before.

This is THE BEST cranberry sauce EVER!
A new staple in our home every Thanksgiving...

Also, tastes even better after a day or so when all the flavors have a chance to meld with one another.

I never liked cranberry sauce until now!
TRY THIS!!!(it's also a very pretty and festive looking dish--garnish with mint or parsley--the green compliments the deep cranberry red color)

I just made this for tomorrow's Thanksgiving dinner and I am very impressed!  This was my first time making a cranberry sauce and it was easy to make and cooked up beautifully like a nice chutney.  I did make a few alterations.  Instead of pureeing the oranges I simply chopped them up into approx. 1" sections and removed about half of the membranes.  I also grated 1/2 tsp. of orange zest for an additional zing.  I wanted my fruit to retain some crispness so I cooked the water, sugar, zest, spices, cranberries, dried fruit and pecans for the full 30 minutes but didn't add the oranges, apples and pears until the last 15 minutes.  For the dried fruit bits I used Sunmaid's Fruit Bits with raisins, apples, apricots, peaches, plums and cherries.  And finally I added 10 drops of red food coloring to make the color really pop.  I know this will be a big hit tomorrow, I can barely keep from eating it all myself!

Wonderful recipe.  Substitute Splenda for the sugar.  Would love a candle that has the aroma of this stuff cooking.  Yummy!!! Is more like a chutney, but a good chutney. Is definitely a keeper recipe.

My family loves this cranberry sauce! Even those of us who don't use the usual sauce use this on our turkey. My dad has been known to eat it with a spoon! I make a crisp out of any leftovers, since the recipe makes quite a bit more than our family can eat.

Very tasty, very easy.  It made way too much though, so I'd recommend cutting the recipe in half.

My family hates cranberry sauce, but they ate this up.  It is great on pork chops and pork tenderloin as well as the traditional thanksgiving fare.

You have to try this.  You will not be dissappointed.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and it turned out perfect!  Everyone loved it and came back for seconds.  Great dish for turkey, chicken, pork, or even a Sunday brunch.

My mother has always made Cranberry-Orange Relish for Thanksgiving and Christmas. So that's what I did for my first Thanksgiving as a newlywed. Right after dinner, my hubby told me he'd rather have what he grew up with...the canned jellied cranberry stuff. So that's what we've had for the past 15 years. Finally, this past Thanksgiving, I decided I wanted something that was more gourmet tasting. I tried this and it was a big hit! Even my canned-cranberry-loving husband ate it, had seconds, and commented that it was very good. I made it again for Christmas and it will be my recipe forever more.

Absolutely the best. Everyone I have served this too has loved it. After we ate it with turkey on Thanksgiving, we threw the leftovers onto vanilla soy ice cream wich is now what I primarily make it for. It makes a perfect dessert, like pie with out the crust.

GREAT!!! Everyone liked it.  I added an extra 1/2 cup of water & 1/4 cup of sugar.  It made alot & the leftovers were great mixed in with nonfat vanilla yogurt or nonfat cottage chesse & on top of cream cheese served with crackers.  I also made the blueberry cranberry recipe on this website & it was really good too.

Pretty good!  It only took 22 minutes of simmering before it was finished.  For the 1 cup of dried fruit, I used mariani dried fruit (chopped up) and omitted the prunes.  The pecans add a great touch, it really wouldn't hurt to add a little more pecans if you're a fan.

Even my husband--who hates cranberries and pecan--liked this one.  I love it, too.  The pears soften the bitter taste up a bit, but it's not too sugary.  It's just tart enough.  Great recipe!

This is truly a cranberry sauce extraordinare!  A great blend of flavors and not over powering.  My family likes the fact that it is not overly sweet--just a hint of tartness which is perfect for an accompaniment for turkey.  Thanks for a great recipes.  We will be making it for years to come.

This recipe is delicious!  I've made it over and over, and we really liked it.  It's far better than store-boughten cranberry sauce!  I recommend this recipe.  It's delicious over cream cheese with Ritz crackers!!!

Delicious. I didn't have pecans and so they were omitted and I used raisins for the dried fruit, and I used two clementines (which I didn't peel, only removed a few seeds) and the recipe was still a big hit. Everyone at the Thanksgiving dinner loved this one.

This recipe was fantastic! This year was the first time I ever made a complete Thanksgiving meal. I really wanted every recipe to be special and this one really was.   This is a big deal because most everyone in my family hates cranberry sauce (including me!).  After they tasted it, they were eating it by the bowl full!  I ommitted the nuts based on another person's review and the consistency came out nicely.  I will definately be making this for Christmas dinner.

This is fantabulous! Great color, taste, smell...I could go on and on! I used one large can of mandarin oranges and reserved the juice for required liquid. This was my first time ever making cranberry sauce and it turned out great even though I accidentaly doubled the salt.

This sauce is wonderful - the smell while cooking makes it even better!  It is quite tart, so if you like sweet sauce, I would add more sugar.  I also left out the pecans.  Leeza mentions 'trade secret' - my mom thinks it tastes just like the cranberry dessert in a healthy choice microwave dinner (her favorite part!) :-)

This is so wonderful. I followed another reviewers advice and added mandarin oranges and used the liquid in the can and added enough water to make 1 cup.  This is so much better than the canned stuff-I'll never go back.  The house smelled so good while this was simmering.  I'm so glad I tried this.  Thanks Leeza for sharing the awesome recipe.

Five Star beyond a shadow of a doubt.  My husband was really giving me grief about spending the time making this when I could buy a can and cut along the "cool little ridges".  But he ate more of this than he did the turkey at Christmas dinner.  When I was reading the recipe I was thinking chutney, and it definitely can double as chutney.  I poured it over the cream cheese block while still warm and it was incredible.  Note:  I did not have an orange so I doubled the apple, and as a result I had to increase the water and sugar.

Finally I have found an outstanding cranberry sauce.  I enjoyed this and so did my family at Thanksgiving.  It was very easy to make.  My grocery store didn't have pears so I used 2 apples and walnuts instead of pecans because that's all I had.  I'll definitely be making this every Thanksgiving.  The servings are accurate and then some.

Excellent. However, next time I will puree it for smooth sauce and maybe take out the nuts or put it after the sauce is pureed.

Even my family who only liked jellied cranberry sauce in a can loved this full berry recipe.  I plan to make it a new Thanksgiving tradition.

I have made this every Thanksgiving for the last few years and I love it more each year. It's perfectly balanced with tart and sweet, crunchy and fruity.  It's great as a side with stuffing and turkey - but it's also wonderful on top of vanilla ice cream.

By far the BEST cranberry sauce I have ever made! I ran out of cinnamon and used allspice in it's place and it was amazing! Have someone who hates cranberry sauce? Have them try this one. I turned non-believers into believers at work with this one.

Came out very good, but not my favorite cranberry sauce recipe. Still, to be fair, I made tons of changes without knowing the outcome so that may not be a fair judgment of the original. I just utilized the ideas that attracted me to this recipe. Next time I’d use les salt, though. I like my sauce more tangy than sweet, and I like it chunky. I didn’t want to drown out the cranberry flavor with pureeing everything so I kept the additions chopped.

I love this recipe.  I pretty much followed the recipe. I cut back on the sugar.  And as another reviewer posted, I added the cranberries to the boiling sugar water and let them boil for a few minutes.   For the dried fruit I used dates and a few prunes,  (it was all I had in the house.).   These are the best cranberries I have made in years.  I might have to make them every year.  I hope the others eat the canned cranberry sauce.

the yellow apricot made the color lighter, I had to add dark dried cranberry. 
1 cup pecan is too much , the consistency is too grainy and not smooth  like a traditional sauce.
I used squeezed orange instead of water but I had to keeps adding water.I think I need to simmer it longer but I could barely see the cranberries .

One of my favorite winter side dishes is a cranberry relish/sauce and this one hit it out of the park. My house smells amazing while it cooks on the stove and the flavor is to die for.

Amazing!!! It's sweet with a touch of tart. Just the way I like it! The family loved it also. I used dried cranberries, apricots, and pineapple for my dried fruit.  I would highly recommend this recipe.

The flavors in this were phenomenal and I wouldn't change anything about the way it tasted. And though my dad really liked the nuts in it, the rest of us didn't. Next time, no nuts for us. :)

This is excellent recipe! I have made it the past two yrs and my family loves it. 3 things I do differently. I doubled the recipe, omitted the dried fruit, and instead instead of water I replaced it with 1 cup orange per bag of cranberries. It helps to sweeten the Cranberries and soften some of the tartness.

Yum! I thought this would be very sweet, but it wasn’t at all. It is sweet and tart. Delicious. I did not add the dried fruit because that is to rough on the stomach, well it is for me. I added about 3/4 cup sugar in the raw not white so maybe that’s why it wasn’t too sweet. I actually added a few droppers full of liquid stevia to sweeten it up. I hope my guests like it because I do.

More of a chutney than a sauce but VERY good.  Made as directed. Would not change a thing except one could add about 3/4 tsp red pepper flakes to make it a little spicy. This would be good with pork also.

I have been making this for 15 years - leftover become part of a brie pastry shell appetizer. Use it to replace the cranberry part of Wolfgang Puck's Savory Squash Soup. In other words, one batch of this goes a looong way! The best!

Since we are diabetic,  I make homemade.  It comes out great every time and no one can tell the difference.  I like the idea of using various dry fruit.  I have some black currants to use this year not zante.  I can't wait.  We have loads of pecans so they will be included.  I don't puree the orange, but I dice it and add juice left over from cutting.

This is the first time I've ever made homemade cranberry sauce, and I am so glad I picked this recipe! I had to make a few exceptions, because I didn't have the stuff. I only added 1 medium sized apple, and I only had dried cranberries for the fruit. Other than that, all was the same. This cranberry sauce is even better the 2nd and 3rd days. I was eating it on biscuits! It's like a cranberry preserve and so so delicious! I will never go back to the canned stuff again! Thanks for the recipe!

I've been making this extraordinary sauce for about 6 or 7 years, but this is the first time my family has gotten to try it.  They want it for other times as well, "Not just Thanksgiving!"
I already knew it was going to be a treat, because I have tried different recipes from different people, grandmothers included, and none of them ever matched up to this really simple delicious cranberry dish.  Do not change a thing, unless you're just going to double the recipe and freeze some!

This cranberry sauce was awesome! I halfed the amount of sugar because I still wanted it to retain some good cranberry flavor. With all of the sweet fruit in the recipe I didn't want it to be overly sweet. It came out so perfect

This was a hit at my house for Thanksgiving. I used orange juice instead of water and just 1/2 cup of sugar. My daughter put some in her oatmeal the next day for breakfast.

Everyone loved this.  I didn’t have any apples left, and I didn’t use the nuts or dried mix fruit.  I’m sure it would have added more to the flavor if I did.  I doubled the recipe and I have plenty leftover.

Very easy. Very good! used one granny smith apple, one orange plus zest, craisins. Didn't have any raisins and pecans would be a great addition... yummy chutney.  Great also over cream cheese for appetizer." Reminds me of Hobby Lobby":

I didn't have a pear.   Used dried cherries, blueberries and raisins.  I used the whole orange including the peel .  Put  all fruit except cranberries in the Vitamix for a few pulses and then added to cranberries.    This is much better and more interesting than plain cranberry sauce.

This stuff is addictive! We eat it by the spoonful, ok bowlful. I've made it twice and the family's requesting it again. Following another reviewer's tip, I use a can of mandarin oranges. I use the juice from the can as part of the cup of water. Also, I can't ever seem to get a pear ripe when I need it, so I just use two different varieties of apple. And we're kind of traditional, so I use dried cranberries instead of the mixed fruit. It's amazing. Try it. You will LOVE it! Thanks so much for the original post.

I make this every year for Thanksgiving. I double the recipe so I can send some home with the leftovers. The only things I do differently is I omit the cinnamon. I made it one year with the cinnamon and didn’t really like the difference it made to the flavor. I also omit the nuts because my granddaughter has a severe nut allergy.

I've made this a number of times now, and I've finally settled on "my version". I use about 1/4 c of sugar instead of a full cup, use a small can of mandarin oranges in place of the fresh orange, add a small can of crushed pineapple, and if  I can't find good pears, I use 2 apples instead. Once everything has cooked and completely cooled, and I add a pint of fresh blueberries. I try to cook at least the day before to give all the flavors time to meld, but I don't add the pecans until just before serving so they don't get mushy. Terrific recipe as is - all of my little modifications are just personal preferences.

This is one of the best cranberry sauces I have ever made. It is very simple, yet extremely good tasting. I did use less sugar, as we are watching our sugar intake. And, I did omit the dried fruit. My family loved the mixture of flavors and even asked for seconds. I will be making this again and again for many years to come.

I exchanged the sugar with 1/2 cup of honey, the second time I made it.
I just find honey to be a more natural flavor that doesn't cover the taste of the individual fruits.  Either way, it is delicious and will be a traditional holiday sauce in my house.

I added cloves. This recipe is one of my favorite Thanksgiving dishes. I always receive rave reviews and recipe requests when I bring it to share. More of a chutney than traditional sauce but it really is extraordinarily delicious! Easy to make a day ahead and then reheat. One less thing to make day of! I also add extra pecans.

Sensational recipe--I've had people who claim they don't like cranberry sauce enjoy this.   As written, the cinnamon and nutmeg are almost overpowering, so I cut those in half and the finished dish is much more nicely balanced.  Otherwise I follow the recipe exactly.  The leftovers make a great breakfast or snack when mixed with some plain yogurt.

I made this for Thanksgiving for my entire, extended family.  Everyone raved about it.  It was so tasty that I found myself sneaking spoonfuls straight out of the bowl .  The second time I made it I sub'd out half of the sugar for Splenda.  Tasted exactly the same.  I will never make any other cranberry recipe.  This one is just that good.

PHENOMENAL!!  I have never like cranberries, but for whatever reason got the desire to make for Christmas dinner. Read many recipes and reviews and settled on this one. Made exactly as it is written and I'm now addicted!!  This was outstanding and received many compliments from my guests. This will become a yearly Christmas standard. As other reviews have said, if you don't like cranberries, try this recipe and you'll be hooked!!

GOOD EASY  This is really good and fairly fast to make.
I used can of drained mandarins , no pear and mixed
dried fruit, and cherries.  This is going to be good over 
Brie or cream cheese and bagels,,can't wait.

This was an excellent recipe! I made this almost exactly as written. I used dried apricots, cranberries and orange cranberries as my dried fruit. I also omitted the salt. I didn't feel like it needed it at all. This takes cranberry sauce to a whole new level. Well done and thanks for sharing!!!

Crazy delicious!  The recipe lends itself to customization: I used half the sugar, left the skin on the apple, and skipped the nuts.  It is the best cranberry sauce we've ever had and may very well have been the best dish on our Thanksgiving table.  Well worth the minimal effort that it requires.

I will definitely make this cranberry sauce again. I omitted the nuts and next time I would go easy on the nutmeg. It didn't firm up as much as I was hoping while it was cooling so I let it sit in a tight sieve for a minute so some of the juice leaked out and then the consistency was perfect.

This is the best cranberry sauce ever.  I make it every year for thanksgiving no matter where we go.  Everyone agrees its the best they have ever had.  It goes so well with the rest of dinner.  I like to MASH everything with a potato masher at the end.  This gives it a smoother texture and dark cranberry color.

This cranberry sauce is the best ever. My 22 year old son has been making this for the last 3 years now. Before this, neithor he or my daughter would touch cranberry sauce. Growing up on canned or jarred food, who thought homemade could be so heavenly. It's so good its like eating a special treat. It's wonderful warm or cold. I hope I don't get into it before tomorrow:)

Although it was tasty, it was not to my taste. Some of my guests loved It and ate it with celery, which gave it quite an unusual but good flavor. It was way too swe, but that it was a beautiful holiday red. My only substitution was four clementines instead of one orange.

WOW!  WOW!  WOW!
I just made this for Thanksgiving tomorrow. 
I followed the recipe except used canned pear.  
The apple I had was huge so I only added half.
I puréed the orange in my nutribullet.
My kitchen smells heavenly. 
It looks exactly like the picture!  
It's very tasty warm, I may serve it that way, if there is any left (I can't stop eating it!)

Followed the recipe as written. Used a golden apple, red pear, naval orange and for dried fruit 1/2 apricot and 1/2 craisens and just used pumpkin pie spice and a pinch of salt. Third or 4th year making it and always a hit. I did add a touch of honey when it was finished as the berries were a bit tart this year. This is a must try, esp for those that say they don't like cranberry sauce.

I had to use a canned jellied cranberry sauce (Mexico ) but, I  added 1 pear, 2 mandarines off my tree, 1 small apple, dried cranberries, handful of walnuts & pecans.  Put in blender, added to canned jellied cb.  No sugar, no o.j.   Is delish!

As some reviewers suggested, I halved the sugar. By doing this though, I found it too tart for me (even with the sweet fruits) so I did add the full amount later. When dissolving it, I used half water and half orange juice. I also used a can of drained mandarin oranges to make it easier, coarsely chopping so they wouldn't be in whole pieces. For fruits, I used dried cherries, cranberries and apricots. I'd chop my pecans a little finer the next time; I would prefer that over the larger pieces I had. I also added about a tblsp of brandy to the mixture. It's cooling now but will be great for Thanksgiving this week, and I'm thinking even to gift for Christmas. Nice recipe!

Have been making this recipe for the past 5 years. Always a hit with a double purpose. First we eat it as a spread on top of cream cheese with crackers and then we eat it with our holiday meal.

I make this every year! I use the SunMaid fruit bits and I think it adds a little more flavor and texture. I serve it at room temp at Holidays and everyone loves it as leftovers straight from the fridge.

I've been searching for years for a really good cranberry sauce from scratch. One that is not to bitter. This is it! this was a huge hit at our Thanksgiving this year! It does make quite a lot, but I pre-froze portions and then put in vacuum sealed freezer bags. My pear unfortunately went bad so had to improvise and used 2 single serving sized cups of strawberry applesauce. This was the only change I made. Excellent recipe!

This was excellent. The key to getting it to look like the picture is cook it until ALL the cranberries burst, simmer for a while, it takes longer than 30 minutes to get it exactly. Also the fresh orange was not juicy and sweet so I added a can of 15oz mandarin oranges and I added CANDIED/GLAZED pecans instead of plain pecans.

So I have never tried making cranberry sauce from scratch before, not only was this easy it was amazing. I forgot to get the dried fruit, so i put in dried cranberries, adjusted the sugar to taste. It was amazing and my best friend said I should make a new batch every week just because its so good, we used it as our sauce and over cream cheese.

A simple and easy recipe, this is a great change from the traditional boiled sauce.  Like several other reviewers, I used Splenda instead of sugar, as so many Thanksgiving dishes are candied or sweetened -- sugar overload! -- and the artificial sweetener worked out perfectly. This recipe is a keeper for the holidays!

I served this cranberry sauce this Thanksgiving and I served it over goat cheese and then served the sauce along with dinner and it was a hit. Everyone wanted the recipe. I was already ask to bring this to New Years Eve served on the goat cheese. Those 2 are a great combination.

I cut the sugar in half on the mention of other reviews that this is very sweet.  Even with cutting the sugar it was very very sweet. I was hoping for a sweet but tangy cranberry taste and this did not deliver. I'm saving it to spread on toast. My guests said they enjoyed it but I hav most of it left over.

This Thanksgiving I'm thankful this recipe made enough so I have leftovers for me. To eat right out of the bowl with a spoon. After reading many reviews this is what I changed: left out the pear (didn't have one), 2 cuties instead of orange (no oranges either), 3/4 c sugar, halved the cinnamon and nutmeg (figuring I could add the rest toward the end if it needed more), and added a dash if ginger. SO DELICIOUS! My husband and I both "licked" the pan like you would with cookie dough or cake batter!

This is by far, the best recipe for cranberries I have ever made. DELICIOUS! I followed the recipe exactly as written- except I couldn't find mixed dried fruits so I used a bag of chopped dried plums. Fantastic combination and I will happily make this again.

This is absolutely delish!! I used dried pineapple, apricots and white raisins for my dried fruit. I also used mandarin oranges -draining most of the juice. I made it a few days ahead and it is even better so makes this a great time saver rather than making it on the holiday.  I will be making this every year.

I've made cranberry sauce like this each year for special occasions. Used frozen pineapple and mixed berries instead of Apple and Pear. Also added a little ground clove and special ingredient (Rum)!

I have used this recipe for the past 4 years at Thanksgiving.  I made the following changes:  Reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup.  Reduce the Cinnamon to 1/2 tsp.  Reduce the nutmeg to a Dash.  This lets you taste more of the cranberry flavor.

An apple, and orange and a pear? It didn’t sound appealing to me but this is our family favorite cranberry sauce. It is delicious. I make it as listed except maybe a tiny bit less nutmeg only a half cup of nuts. For the fried fruit I use all craisins. I think it does need to cook a little longer than it says though. Try this recipe. It is amazing. We’ve been having it for years and everyone who’s tried it, loves it too.

This cranberry sauce is excellent. It was a big hit at dinner last night and will surely become one of our new traditions with turkey.

This is a great recipe and my family loved it!  If I had to change one thing to adjust the recipe to my palette it would be to use ground cloves instead of ground nutmeg.
Otherwise a fantastic sauce.

I made this, except with only one chopped orange and one chopped apple, plus the cranberry sauce, water, and sugar. I left out the dried apricots to keep it from being too sweet. It was great!

I'm not really a fan of cranberries, so when I was asked to bring a cranberry dish I went to allrecipes.  This recipe is off the charts.   Soooo delicious.  I doubled the recipe but only added 11/2 cups of sugar, used dried apricots and strawberries and simmered with the lid off.  It still has chunks of fruit and the texture is great.  A must try recipe.

I made this recipe last Thanksgiving, and I am making it again this year because everyone loved it.  I have never liked cranberry sauce (mostly because the only kind that was ever served to me was the jelly kind out of the can...ew). When I spent a Thanksgiving in China a couple of years ago, I ate Thanksgiving dinner at an American restaurant called Grandma's Kitchen. They served a traditional Thanksgiving meal, complete with cranberry sauce. It was more like a cranberry sauce salad, and it was delicious. I wanted to try to replicate it because it was the first time I liked a cranberry sauce. I found this recipe and it's pretty close, and actually, a million times better (and that is saying a lot). This recipe will be a staple for me for every Thanksgiving. Some members of my family will still have the canned jelly cranberry sauce, but I will still make this.

FABULOUS! I actually became a member of this site just so I can tell the world how extraordinarily good this recipe is. The pureed orange is a fabulous ingredient! The pecans are a must as the nutty flavor is a fabulous compliment to the cranberry. Dried fruit, apples, and pears, can be modified without altering the overall deliciousness of this cranberry sauce. I like the spices just as they are!

This is truely great.  So after reading the reviews I decided to double the recipe.  I have a lot of people who come in all week and so I wanted 
extra for bagels and cream cheese one morning and for waffles mixed with maple surup another morning.  I wanted enough to put on top of the block of cream cheese at the cheese board and I wanted enough for the top of a cheesecake a few days this week.  Then of course I needed some for the
thanksgiving table.  I even had some to fill two canning jars and pot in the refrigerator for take home left overs for my sister and brother.
So here is how I changed the recipe after reading all the reviews.  I used black currents to make the sauce dark red.  I also through in a cup
of big black blackberries that are in season and that also helped with a rich color.  I used the juice of a can of mandarin oranges with blue berry juice from trader joes instead of the water to also make a beautiful dark syrup because I had read that people were putting food coloring in the sauce to darken it.  Mine turned out dark purple red.  
and it tastes fabulous.  I cut the sugar a bit and the cinnamon to a dash.  And I through in a pinch of nutmeg, mace and cloves and ground ginger.  Yum.

I used the mandarin oranges, dried cranberries, dried apricots and replaced 2/3rd's the sugar with baking Splenda.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe. I doubled the recipe and frozen the excess for upcoming Thanksgiving potlucks.

Great combination of flavors and textures. Like the sweet and tangy contrasts, paired with the softened crunch of the pecans.

Very yummy.  I omitted the nuts because I didn't have any on hand.  I made it the night before eating it and the flavors had time to marry.  I froze the remainder so we'll see how it is at Christmas.

I really like this cranberry!  The cinnamon and pecans added quite a special touch!  So delicious and easy to make.  I will serve this again at Christmas!

Delicious and so easy to make! Although, I would classify it more as a cranberry chutney instead of a sauce. I made it for a Thanksgiving family gathering and everyone LOVED it and requested it for next year.  I altered it only slightly (did not add nutmeg because i didnt have any, added lots more cinnamon, and instead of the dried mixed fruit i just used dried apricots and prunes)

This sauce was so different and so good. Normally I just make plain cranberry sauce and thought it would be fun to change.  It was so good, I'm excited for Christmas as an starter I'm going to spread the sauce over a brick of cream cheese.  Yum

I've made this recipe the last three years to rave reviews.  I've used combinations of apricots, raisins, berries, and currants for the dried fruit, and it always comes out delicious.  I've even made this to pour over a block of cream cheese and served with crackers for a potluck at work.  Try it - it's really good!

I did this recipe last year for Thanksgiving, and it was a BIG hit!  I did omit the pecans because of my husband, but it still was amazing.  I guess we are heavy dippers because I found that we needed MORE than it said it served (i know others are saying it's too much).  But this year, everyone is asking if I am doing it again this year.  I will double the recipe this time and put extras on whatever I can find!  This is the best cranberry recipe!  I will be doing it EVERY year from now on. :^)

I made this today to serve with Thanksgiving dinner in a few days, (I like to do as much in advance as I can). I followed the recipe exactly except that I used 1/2 cup honey and 1/2 cup brown sugar, and for the dried mixed fruit I used a mixture of dried mango, papaya and pineapple. After simmering for 30 minutes and cooling, I ran it through the food processor. It smelled divine while cooking, and tasted even better! I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is so good. I was unsure about it because we had not ever eaten cranberry sauce.  I made it for Thanksgiving and it was perfect.  My Mother-in-Law even asked me to bring it for Christmas dinner.  It has a nice mix of sweet and a bit sour.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  This has become a holiday staple.

I made this despite the fact that most of my family either dislikes any kind of sauce or likes the canned jellied sauce-- but my mother, who is getting senile, always liked home-made, and I wanted to make something special.  Turns out, everyone who confessed a dislike for cranberry sauce in general had seconds, and my mother had thirds. And my sisters who like the canned stuff said it was pretty tasty. What little was left over was spread on turkey and stuffing sandwiches that evening.

LOVED this recipe!!  I made some minor changes...didn't use any dried fruit simply because I forgot it and don't regret it at all!!  Got so many compliments on this cranberry sauce.  Usually it is just made because its tradition to have it with the turkey but always gets thrown out.  Not THIS time!!  It was being eaten by the spoonful before the day was done.  It even got put in the refrigerator for later use.  Days after Thanksgiving my dad suggested we make a pie out of it!  I guess we've got a winner and will now be at EVERY holiday dinner I am sure!

Excellent take on cranberry sause. Everyone loved it even people who dont usually like cranberry sause. I was piling it on my turkey! I also want to try it on a turky sandwitch. I recomend cutting up the apple and pair up in pretty small dices. I've already given the recipe to 2 people.

Fantastic!  I'd never actually tasted a homemade cranberry sauce that resembled what you get from the can (too tart, too bitter, too etc).  The flavor to this is similar to the creamy cylinder most are accustomed to, but the use of real cranberries and nuts gives it a soft, crunchy texture that is to die for.  Everyone I know has asked for the recipe.  Well worth it!

I made this last year for Thanksgiving and even my sister, who HATES cranberries, LOVED this.  I followed the notes of the person who posted the recipe, since I too am diabetic, although I used the whole pear and whole apple, and all the nuts.  YUMMY!  This year I'm making a double batch - my sister thought this would make an excellent topping for ice cream! I think I will add some fresh blueberries,  some fresh ginger and a bit of allspice.   Great,  flexible recipe!

I left out the dried fruit, so that may have changed the result, but I thought that this tasted similiar to the simple, 2 ingredient cranberry sauce that I make every year. It was quite a bit of extra work and just didn't seem worth the effort to me. Maybe the dried fruit really makes the difference? It was good cranberry sauce, just nothing special.

I also made this for Thanksgiving this year and got rave reviews. This was the most popular left-over too. 
People will definately be impressed by this side dish, and you WILL get asked for the recipe.

Ladies and gentlemen... we have a winner. Made this for Thanksgiving this year and my guests are still talking about it (first time they've requested to take leftover cranberry sauce home with the turkey!).

I really like simple cooked cranberries with a bit of orange zest and a cup of sugar in a cup of water but this was a nice change.  My mom was visiting and I knew that she prefers nuts and other fruit in her cranberries.  She loved this and I really like it too.  My DH would prefer the plain berries I usually fix.  Perhaps next year I will make a half recipe of each!

This sauce was excellent! I substituted the pear for a second apple since I'm allergic and left out the nuts, again, due to allergies. I thought it may affect how it turned out but it didn't - it was fantastic.

This had a really great flavor, I understand why everyone has said it would make a good pie filling, because you could really smell the fruity, cinnamon flavor when it was cooking! I'm not a fan of cranberry sauce, (I never understood what you do with it, really... sauce on turkey... weird) but I thought that this was really tasty. I didn't give it 5 because it didn't really get eaten at the table, so I'm not sure it was appreciated fully. I halved the recipe, beware that it makes a LOT, more than would probably get eaten just as a side with dinner. I also used Ritz crackers with cream cheese on them with a dab of the cranberry sauce on top, and that was tasty!

the mix in of dried fruit really does something to the recipe. i used a cup of diced dried apricots, and the result was just so delicious. it added a chewy texture that my family just loved.

WOW! definitely worth the effort... which wasn't actuallly much.  If you are looking for more than the "canned" food holiday this will add tons of delight to your festive feast.  The mixture of fresh cranberries and pecans is great. and i love the hint of cinamon!

This is a creative recipe.  A bit time-consuming.  Good flavor until the spices were added.  I might try again without the spices.  We didn't care for it, but it was certainly unique.

WOW, who needs turkey!  Awesome cranberry sauce. We'll never ever eat canned again. I followed the recipe almost exactly, used 1/2 cup dried figs and 1/2 cup dried appricots for the dried mixed fruit.  Also added a pinch or 2 of ground clove.  Everyone loved it. 5 stars all the way!

Everyone LOVES this recipe, and we playfully fight over who gets to bring it to Thanksgiving and take all the credit!  I highly reccomend the cream cheese and cracker serving suggestion.  We love it with Ritz crackers.

This was a perfect complement to my Thanksgiving turkey.  It had the bite of the cranberries but also hinted at a stewed apples taste.  Very good!

What a great cranberry recipe!  I prepared this at Thanksgiving and it was wonderful.  I am not a great lover of cranberry sauce, but I could not get enough of this one. My husband felt the same way.  It was easy to make, very aromatic, and the taste was out of this world.  We will be making this all year round.

Decided to try this recipe even though I never really liked cranberry sauce.  It is really delicious and will make again. I left out the pecans,though, and cooked it a little longer than what it calls for.  Thanks for the great recipe!

It didn't taste much like cranberries to me, but it was delicious nonetheless!  It seems almost like a jam, and I imagine would go well on your morning toast. Kids and hubby liked it, we just didn't have enough room with turkey to eat hardly any of it. Makes PLENTY for a big meal with guests.

My good friend is a wonderful southern cook and this recipe received her high marks. I thought I was buying oranges and instead bought small grapefuit and used it anyway. It would be great canned and given as Christmas gifts. More of a chutney than plain old cranberry sauce. I added Amaretto to give it a little kick.

Fantastic and delicious recipe!  This will be the 3rd year that I'm making this Cranberry Sauce for Thanksgiving with my in-laws.  They all love it so much that they ask me to make more to bring some home with them.

This is my third year making this.  It's easy and smells wonderful while cooking.  No one wants cranberry sauce out of a can anymore!

My sister, who doesn't really care for cranberries, actually asked for this recipe.  It is the best cranberry sauce I have ever eaten, and served to company!

Yum!  I always look for good recipes for fresh cranberries whenever they come into season; I'll add this one to my list.  Maybe not good to use on those who desire a very TRADITIONAL (i.e. BORING!) Thanksgiving meal, but for any who are a little more open-minded, they'll love this stuff!

I made this in the crockpot and did not like it at all. Maybe I am too used to the stuff that comes out of a can. Also one reviewer wrote that she did not like the color, it wasnt a pretty red color when it was done cooking. same here. Martha made a Chutney on her show and it retained the pretty red color---dont know what the problem is with this?:(

Wasn't extraordinary, but not bad.
