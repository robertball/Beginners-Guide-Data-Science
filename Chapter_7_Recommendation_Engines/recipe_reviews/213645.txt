I loved it!! Absolutely wonderful!! And you know I 
Completely disagree with the person before me
Who doesn't like hearing how people tweaked the
Recipe!! Before I make any recipe anymore I go through the reviews and it's so helpful to see what ideas people had. I think part of being a good cook is not always following the recipe as written but adding your own ideas and tastes to it!!

You get alot of "Wow" factor for a pretty simple dish to make. I'd recommend putting some of the sauce in the middle of the roll up for more flavor.

This was quite delicious, considering how easy it was to prepare.  I made a few additions and changes:  For the sauce, I used light mayo, omitted the lemon zest and salt, and added a little cayenne pepper to spice it up a little.  I used a slice of proscuitto and shredded swiss cheese instead of a slice of provolone, and used 6-7 pieces of asparagus.  Yummy!!  Will definitely make this impressive dish again!

I would like honest ratings on the recipe as it is posted.  That is much more helpful when deciding which recipes to use.  Not when those reviews are not even for the same recipe that is posted.  Why do people do that?  Post your own version of the recipe, separately somewhere, please.  That said, this recipe AS IS is fantastic. We have chicken at least twice per week and this will be in the recipe rotation.  Thank you so much.

I followed the recipe without any changes aside from doubling the amount of asparagus.  My husband commented that it was "gourmet".  I will definitely make this again when asparagus is in season!

Made this for dinner. The sauce is quite good; the lemon/tarragon combination is excellent.  I made rice as a side dish but  think garlic mashed potatoes would work better.  This dish could easily impress invited dinner guests.  Monica, thank you for sharing.

Fabulous dish.  Made it for hubby & I for dinner tonight.  It's a keeper recipe.  Fancy enough to serve for company.  I made the following adjustments: I added a tablespoon of the sauce between the chicken and provolone before rolling.  Also discovered that I didn't have any tarragon.  So I substituted marjoram.

really yummy!  I spread some of the mayonnaise mixture on the chicken breast before putting the cheese and asparagus down and rolling it up.  Really added lots of nice flavor and helped to keep the chicken from drying out.  Easy recipe that's good enough for company!

I thought this was excellent, easy to make and seemed like something you would get at a nice restaurant.   I did tweak the sauce a bit, because I did not have tarragon and don't know what it tastes like.  After reading other reviews, I wasn't afraid to try something different.  Instead of the tarragon, I used Essence of Emeril.  Instead of the dijon mustard, I used Koop's Spicy Brown, and used some bottled lemon juice since I didn't have a fresh lemon.  I did use 5 pieces of asparagus as one other person suggested adding add'l stalks.  I used a little thicker coating on the top of the chicken and did also add a little inside the roll up as another reviewer suggested.   I thought it was excellent!   Tender chicken, great flavor, very eas to make - my husband loved it too!

Very good recipe.  Nice a quick and easy.  I decided to add prosciutto ham, but I'm sure it would be great without it too.

This was so delicious!  I was a little hesitant while putting them together but the finished product was amazing!  The changes I made are as follows:  I had no tarragon, so I used marjoram.  I added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce in the sauce.  I didn't have provolone so I used muenster cheese.  Following other reviewers' advice I coated the inside of the chicken with the sauce before rolling it up, and I used five pieces of asparagus.  On the outside of the rolls, I smeared sauce all over with my hands and rolled them in panko rather than just topping them.  Like I said, they were so awesome, and I will definitely be making them again, probably to impress someone!

Excellent recipe!  I microwaved the asparagus in a pie plate covered with a moist paper towel till tender. I used two chicken breasts (only two of us) and butterflied them.  I spooned and spread the mayo mixture over the breast before adding the provolone cheese and, then, added the asparagus and rolled/folded over the the chicken breasts. I used pound or so of asparagus in this recipe so I took the remaining asparagus and placed them around and between the roll-ups. I spread the remaining mayo mixture over the roll-ups and the asparagus and covered all with the panko bread crumbs (didn't have plain panko so used Italian Style Panko).  ABSOLUTELY A MAKE OVER!  THANK YOU!

So delicious! I toss the panko crumbs in 2teaspoons melted butter before topping the mayo-covered breast.  It ensures they will get crisp.  Also, subbing par-boiled large broccoli spears for the asparagus along with adding 1/2teaspoon of curry powder to the mayo mixture, makes a Divan-type flavor that my family loves.

This was great except I think the lemon was over- whelming.  I would cut down to 1/2 lemon, but hte sauce was really great.  I did add a slice pf proscuitto with the cheese inside and a little sauce as did other reivewers.  This is a great do-a-ahead recipe which I will servie for company.  Thanks!!!

Very impressive dish, best part is it's so quick and easy to make. Next time I make this though I'll half the sauce recipe, I had a ton left over. I subbed lite sour cream and plain yogurt for the mayo (cause I don't like mayo). I also replaced one tbsp of the mustard for white wine, I'll probably try replacing all of it with wine next time and see how that turns out. I can't wait to make this one again for company!

Awesome! Modified to my liking. Instead of provolone I put lots of crumbled blue-cheese inside. 1/2 tsp lemon juice, no zest. 1 tsp dijon mustard (didn't need much with all the blue cheese flavoring). Used 1/4 cup mayo and 1/4 cup sour cream, added 1/4 tsp garlic salt and some chopped green onion to sauce. Did not pre-cook asparagus. Spread some sauce inside and on top.  Sprinkled crushed corn flakes on top.  Baked at 425 for about 40 minutes.  ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!  My picky teenage daughter even liked it.  Will make again and again!!

Very nice! I REALLY loved the cheese wrapped around the aspargus in this recipe...and the sauce is definitely a winner! (as other reviewer's had said they put the sauce on the inside and outside, I too did the same),  I also was a little skimpy with the sauce as I didn't want it ooozing everywhere but next time I will put more on, I used 1/4 cup mayo, 1/4 cup fat-free sour cream and decreased the Dijon by half as Dijon tends to overpower a dish pretty quickly and it suited our tastes fine. Hubs and I really enjoyed this dish and it will definitely make it into the regular rotation :) Thanks for the great recipe Monica! :)

Fantastic!!!! I didn't have Provolone, so I used some parmesan. Didn't have tarragon so I used a few shakes of parsley. Used 2 tbsp. of lemon juice in place of fresh and zest. I also put a few tablespoons of the sauce inside the chicken with the asparagus. Used the recipe as written and had  just enough sauce for the three very large chicken breast halves I had...and the sauce was so delicious, I might go ahead and double it next time because this was wonderful as it was, and more would be even better! The first roll, I forgot to put the sauce on before the bread crumbs, so I just put some sauce right over the bread crumbs, and then more bread crumbs on top of that, and the coating on that one came out with deeper and more even coloring on it than the other two I did in the correct order. Super delicious either way, my friends raved, thank you thank you thank you!!!!

Amazing Chicken!  I was looking for something new and different, as we eat alot of chicken, and this has such a unique and great taste.  The only change I make is, like others, to add a little sauce on top of the cheese.  My husband and all 5 of my kids love this.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a very good recipe. Putting a dallop of the mayo mixture into the center before rolling is a must. Be careful not to over cook as it will dry out. I cook a 400 for about 20-25 min. checkin after 20.

Wonderful!  Followed the recipe, except used a little less black pepper.  Family loved this one.  I particularly liked the lemon flavor.  Not too strong, not to subtle.  Will make again!

This just did not work for us.  I was worried about the tarragon, but I couldn't even taste it for all the lemon.  The asparagus looked like it had been beaten up, too.  We'll be lucky to get the leftovers eaten.

I had this in my recipe box for a while, but just made it last night.  It was amazing! My husband and son are not big asparagus fans...but they really liked this!  The only thing I did was put some of the sauce on the inside, too.  Thanks!!

I made this tonight for dinner.  I asked my husband what he thought,  he replied "yummy" in between bites.  I had to make 2 substitutions, tyme instead of tarragon and swiss cheese instead of provolone.  I only used juice and zest of half the lemon.  I spread a thin layer of seasoned bread crumbs on cutting board, brushed sauce on and laid sauce side down into crumbs.  Brushed inside with sauce before adding cheese and asparagus.  I baked at 350 for 30 minutes.  My oven is touchy so I rarely set it above 350.  Turned out moiste, tender and flavorful.  I only used 3 pieces of chicken and had about a 1/4 cup sauce left over.  Edit-  I made this for a second time tonight using strained greek yogurt instead of mayonnaise.  I thought it was a great way to save calories(greek yogurt 130 cal per cup, mayonnaise 640 cal per cup, light mayo 320 cal cup).  Didn't work out as planned because the yogurt lost a lot of water and made the bottom of my chicken soggy.   It was still good, but I will stick to light mayo from now on.

Turned out just perfectly! The hubs loved it!! I should have made 3 servings because he wanted more (of course I should have known!)
Instead of tarragon I used fresh basil and it was delicious!
I also put the mixture in the wrap before wrapping and if i didn't it would not have been as tasty because you wouldn't really taste the sauce. Will make again for guest most definitely!

My dad said this was one of his favorites, but I would have given this a four and a half if possible. My two daughters felt the same as me. I guess after reading the comparison to Hollandaise sauce, I was a little disappointed that the sauce got lost in this a bit. I even put some on the chicken before adding the cheese and asparagus. The lemon flavor was powerful, but that was fine. This would have truly been wonderful with Hollandaise drizzled over the top of it before serving. I also used 5 asparagus spears for each breast and I'm glad that I did. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I will be making this again, but I will probably reserve some of the sauce to drizzle over the tops of the breasts as there was plenty. Thank you for this recipe.

I really like this recipe.  Wife gave it 4 stars.  Both kids loved it.  I don't trust my oven at 475 so I went 375 for 35 minutes.  I'll add more Provolone next time.  I sauced the inside also.

This was soooo good!!  We all loved it!  I doubled the sauce recipe so that I could make 6 pieces of chicken and even did 2 pieces of fish with the same sauce  and panko breading to try it out and both were excellent!  Idid put some sauce between the chicken and cheese as some others had suggested aswell as on the outside before rolling in the panko crumbs and used 5 pieces of asparagus in each chicken.  I did not put any cheese on the fish and just placed the asparagus on top of it on the plate.  I also used fresh basil instead of terragon since we had that on hand.  I served the chicken/fish with  roasted red & yellow peppers and broccoli cheese rice, garlic toast & a few extra pieces of asparagus on the plate. Everything tasted great together! Iwill definitely make  thisagain!!  Thank you forsharing!

This was really almost a 5, but I just felt that it could use a little less lemon - next time will use half a lemon (juice/zest). Instead of spooning the sauce on at the end, I rolled the chicken in it so it was thoroughly coated. The flavor overall was excellent.

This was so yummy and so easy! I made a few changes. I used half a lemon instead of a whole with no zest, used italian spices instead of tarragon, added garlic powder. I didn't cook the asparagus at all and the baking time was enough to cook it to our liking. I used monterey jack on one of the breasts for variation (since my husband likes it best) and he like the MJ better than the provolone. I made some with asparagus and some without. Cheese spilled out a bit but the crunchiness and flavor it created was really yummy. This is a wonderful recipe that I look foward to making again and again for my husband and myself, as well as for guests!

I did not like this recipe at all.  475 degrees is definitely too hot an oven.  I followed recipe precisely, but cooked at only 425 -- still, the panko burned and chicken was extremely dry.  No flavor noticeable either.  Possibly at a 350 degree oven would have been better.

this was just delicious and so moist.  i made a little more sauce than the recipe called for so i could put a little inside the chicken.  i also would not put my stove on 475 as the panko crumbs would burn early before the chicken was done.   i cooked it in my convection oven at 425 for about 40 minutes.  it was moist and delightful and my husband loved it.  i also added more spears of asparagus than called for.  oh i also would use less lemon juice as another reviewer mentioned.  i only used one and 1/2 lemons juiced and it was almost too much.

This was DELICIOUS! I used my meat tenderizer and it made a HUGE difference.. I sliced a thick chicken breast in half and that was perfect for this dish. I added about 5 slim pieces of asparagus. You can use any kind of white cheese. I use shredded mozzarella.  I did spread some of the mustard mix on the chicken before i rolled it with the asparagus.  Will definitly make this again!

This dish was fantastic!  The only thing I did differently is that I didn't microwave the asparagus.  I like mine tender crisp.  The chicken was moist and tender.  I've paid a lot of money at restaurants for dishes that didn't even compare to this one.  Fabulous and easy!!!!  A definite keeper!  Thanks for sharing :)

I coat both sides of each piece of chicken with panko.  I have used used all different types of cheese as well. Pepper jack is our fav.  This works great with broccoli too. Dont skimp on the veggies. Make it a nice meal in itself. Happy Eating!!!

I made this tonight and it was EXCEPTIONAL!!! Just the right amount of varying flavors. I changed a couple of things and one is: Sautéing the asparagus. I'm not a huge fan of microwaving much and especially fresh veggies, so I just sautéed them in some olive oil and a little salt and pepper, but I didn't let them cook all the way because I knew it was going in the oven, just enough to soften a bit. The second modification was the timing of cooking. I did cook at the suggested temperature for 25 minutes, but I then recooked for an additional 10 mins at 350, cam out perfect. I always look for texture rather than "color." Color can throw you off as hemoglobins can stain the chicken. I also used THIN cut sliced chicken breasts, much easier to work with and in my opinion, taste better than thick gobs of chicken (thick cut). It was great and I certainly recommend this recipe. I also salt and peppered the chicken, just a bit as well.

Absolutely wonderful - and easy!  I substituted parsley herb blend (fresh herbs in a tube) for the tarragon.  It was delicious and several of my friends now make this, too.  Thanks.

Woow...Amazing!  My family was talking about this dish days after I made it.  The only two things I omitted were the lemon zest and dried tarragon. I also used Italian bread crumbs instead of panko.  Very delish!  Oh and yes put some of the sauce in the middle!!!  Great suggestion :)

I have prepared this dish a few times and have found that not using as much panko bread crumbs was better and made the chicken seem a little lighter and not so breaded. Overall, REALLY good dish, it is a staple now in our house.

This was pretty good altho I think it was alittle heavy on the lemon juice.  My lemon was pretty big but I will only use 1/2 lemon next time.  Enjoyed it and will try it again.  Thanks.

My family and I just loved this receipe.  Followed the previous reviewers suggestions; cut the lemon juice in 1/2, adding a clove of garlic, spread the mayo mixture inside the chicken and added an additional piece of cheese.  The cheese did ooze out some but that was ok.  Definately a keeper.

I did adjust the quanity of 1 lemon to half lemon. I did put some of the sauce inside over the asparagus and secured the chicken breast with a toothpick. It turned out very well and delicious! My daughter loved the sauce and the chicken. She's not a fan of asparagus like I am. My hubby said it was the best and he doesn't like sauces on meats. I will make this again

This was very good.  The fresh lemon juice and lemon zest adds a nice bright flavor.  The chicken was moist and tender, although a bit bland.  I think it could use a bit more seasoning directly on the chicken.  I didn't have provolone, but used swiss instead.  I will make this one again.  Thank you Monica!

This was really good.  Only changed two things- and that was out of necessity/ lack of having the original ingredient.  I left out the bread crumbs and used sliced brie instead of provolone.  It was delicious.  Even one person- who doesn't like asparagus usually- liked this dish.

Prepared as directed but setting the oven at 475 is too extreme, 425 would have no dried out the chicken.

These were quite good! My toddlers at them up! I followed the recipe exactly, only I didn't have chicken breast halves (never been able to find them anywhere), so pounding them still didn't make them very thin, and they took nearly an hour to bake. But they were still delicious and perfectly tender!

Great recipe, simple, not a lot of ingredients and great flavor. Only a few adjustments: I added the sauce on the inside and melted butter on top the last 5 minutes to brown the bread crumbs (other reviewers suggested) and I used less mustard. I think next time, I will use the recommended amount of mustard. However, I will also use less salt. This recipe is a good substitute for a fine gourmet meal. Thanks

Not your ordinary, boring chicken dinner, that's for certain! I attempted to follow the recipe as is but I forgot to add the lemon zest and realized as we were eating. The juice was more than enough for us. Fascinating flavors with the dijon mustard and lemon- my honey loved the sauce and was figuring our what else he could use it on. I served it with mashed potatoes and more asparagus. The market didn't have thin, so I used medium-large 2 spears in the chicken. Turned out fabuous! Recipe didn't need any other meat, it stands on it's own.

Tender, delicious, elegant and my favorite - easy! I didn't have a lemon and substituted juice of 1/2 an orange. I also omitted the cheese and spread some of the mayonnaise mixture on the chicken before wrapping up. Lovely served with a fragrant rice rice such as jasmine or basmati.

Great recipe!! Followed it exactly with exception of tarragon because I was out subbed winter savoury spice I had in my pantry.  Both hubby and I loved!! For sure will make again and will make it with tarragon.  Thanks for this gem ;)

I loved this recipe. I'm not a huge mustard fan so i used a pesto mix instead as the topping. Also, I added a little bit of home made spinach artichoke dip inside the roll. It was absolutely delicious!

Have made this 2 times for parents and in-laws.  It is amazing every time!  I skip the panko because of a gluten allergy.  I also skipped the dried tarragon because I didn't have any and subbed parsley.  It is really yummy.  Need to make this one more often!

The first thing out of my husband's mouth was "WOW!". This recipe is good enough to serve company and the presentation is beautiful.  It is very rich and a little goes a long way. I would say you could halve the breasts after you flatten them and that would be enough to serve one person. A keeper recipe!

This is a quick, easy and elegant dish, worthy of being served to guests. I used Havarti cheese because that is what I  had available and it was delicious. I think the provolone  recommended or Swiss cheese would work as well. Next time, I might try adding a slice of good deli ham for another layer of flavor. Great recipe...I will be making this again.

I love this recipe.  The only change I made (after making the dish several times), was to adjust the oven temp to 410 and bake 20 min. It seemed to burn when at 475.  I also put sauce in the middle as others have suggested.

I followed recipe as written with the addition of sauce on the cheese before rolling up. It was very good, but I felt that the mustard flavor overpowered the other flavors. Next time I will use less mustard; may also experiment with rosemary. Thanks for a very good and simple to make dish. This is "guests-for-dinner-worthy".

I haven't made this yet, but I'm very intrigued as it sounds yummy.  The fat content is terribly high but a little less cheese and a light mayo will likely take care of that. I would NOT omit the tarragon as it has a wonderful light, lemony, herb-y flavor that can't be beat!

I added an extra slice of cheese and brushed the sauce on each cheese slice to give it more flavor.  I had plenty of sauce to brush onto the breasts and then coat with the bread crumbs still.  Delicious dish; next time I'll add prosciutto ham :D

I didn't make any adjustments and it was okay. I like the idea of the chicken around the asparagus, but didn't care for the lemon/mustard taste. There was too much mustard. It's worth trying something like this again, but I'll use a different cheese & sauce. The chicken was tender and the asparagus was cooked perfect, it still had a light crunch and wasn't soggy. So, the basic idea was good, but I won't be making this same recipe again.

Excellent dish, easy to make and you can easily make adjustments.  I did not have tarragon so I just ommited. Also used lemon juice instead of fresh lemon.

Excellent!!  I only used 1 1/2 tbl of lemon juice & no zest because I'm not a fan of lemon in savory dishes. We'll be having this again soon!!

Loved this recipe for it's presentation and ease.  I used chicken tender filets because it's what I had on hand and will now likely make any type of chicken roll the same way as it was much easier to pound a tender than a split breast.  Great flavor, suitable for company but easy enough for a family dinner.

These were ok but I was not as impressed as I was thinking I would be. I wasn't crazy about the tanginess of the lemon in the dish and I usually like the lemon/asparagus combination. I thought they were rather bland. Probably won't make again.

I made recipe as written & we thought there was too much pepper & lemon. Second time, I made the following changes which made it 5 star:  Doubled recipe for 8 breasts but used only 1 teaspoon pepper, 2 tablespoons "bottled" lemon juice, 1 teaspoon lemon zest & 2 teaspoons dried tarragon. Pound each breast in a large freezer bag, using back of saucepan, for evenness. Use only 3 asparagus per roll-up, unless they're thin. Snap ends of asparagus & peel bottom 2 inches, to ensure tenderness (I freeze ends for soup). Add 1 tablespoon of sauce between chicken & cheese, before rolling. Use thick coatings of sauce & panko crumbs on top of roll-ups. I used Provolone on some & Ementhaler on others. Both were good but Ementhaler has more flavour, which we prefer. I also used part-skim cheese & light Miracle Whip. Put roll-ups lengthwise in 9" x 13" baking pan with high sides, lined with parchment paper, for easy clean-up. Can assemble day before (unbaked) as it's a time consuming recipe. Very elegant presentation for company. My 10 year old doesn't like asparagus so I put frozen broccoli spears in hers that were par-cooked in the microwave. Serve with garlic mashed potatoes.

This was great!  I didn't have any tarragon so I used basil instead (similar taste in my opinion).  I will cook the asparagus  for longer in the microwave next time as it was still crunchy, even after being baked with the chicken in the oven.  Other than that, perfect!

This dish was easy and good.  The hubby and kids liked it even more than I did, which surprised me.  They all cleaned their plates.  I added a few more asparagus to the roll ups and the extra spears in the bottom of dish before the roll ups.

We loved this recipe! My husband and I are both lemon lovers so we thought the amount of lemon flavor was great! However, if your not you may want to cut back a bit on the lemon.

This was great! I really liked the asparagus, and it was just the right texture in the finished dish. This was really easy to make, and the cheese melted beautifully.

This was the best oven chicken I've ever made.  Go ahead - impress your friends! I was generous with the cheese.  Glass baking dish is best.  Have the smooth side of the chicken facing you when pounding it.  (It's good to watch the video).

Love the lemon in this recipe! I let the pounded chicken sit in the sauce, then roll the chicken around the cheese and asparagus and then roll in the bread crumbs. I feel like you get more sauce that way. Wonderfully juicy and tasty!

So much easier than I anticipated! Delicious and simple. Didn't have tarragon, and it still turned out great! I poured the extra sauce on top because the recipe calls for a bit too much.

This recipe provided an easy to prepare, tasty Sunday night dinner.  I added baked potatoes and everything was ready in an hour. I did not have any provolone cheese, so I used Harvarti instead. I also omitted the salt, the mustard and lemon added sufficient flavor.

Great presentation and flavor. I think next time I will substitute dill for tarragon and like another reviewer said I might put some sauce in the middle.  I may even add a clove or two of chopped fresh garlic. Will update of I try these!

These chicken roll-ups were delicious!  A bit extra work, but so worth it. As other reviewers recommended, I added a little sauce with the asparagus and it was great.  Don't add too much sauce inside as it makes the asparagus and chicken too slippery to roll up.  I may try butterflying the chicken breast the next time, as another reviewer suggested. This is definitely a recipe for company.  it looks so beautiful on the plate. I served it with a rice pilaf.  Thank you for sharing, Monica.

This was a great recipe, one I will definitely use again.  The flavors were so good together and so easy to make.  My boyfriend is not one to say much on food, just eats what is made for him and he said he really liked it and went back for seconds.  That is huge compliment coming from him.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

It was very good and not too hard to make. I took some the advice of some other reviews, though, and cooked it at 425 for 40 minutes instead of the 475 for 25 minutes. This way the panko doesn't have a chance to burn and the chicken is juicier. I also doubled the cheese and asparagus, and did about half the lemon zest. I also put some of the sauce inside as well, which I'm sure added to the flavor and juiciness. Make sure you do a good job hammering the chicken (I don't have a meat pounder so I used a hammer sideways haha) to ensure that you have enough room to roll everything up in it.

The sauce had too much lemon for chicken to my taste.  I'm going to try this yummy sauce on salmon.  I think that will be great.
The chicken breasts we had were pretty big so we used two pieces of cheese and 6 or 7 pieces of asparagus each.  When I make this again I will use less lemon.  We had some left over Alfredo sauce and I used that on my son's chicken.  He hates to try anything new but hey, he likes asparagus.  It was fabulous.  So I guess I got two new recipes from this one.

I just followed the recipe...like a reviewer, I put some of the sauce inside the chicken breast, then placed smoked provolone, and smoked julienne dried tomato slices on top of the asparagus; and then rolled it up as recipe recommends. It is awesome. Even my granddaughter, who can be picky, loved it and had two portions. 
Ps: I added a little chicken broth, as the cheese will melt out. This gives you additional sauce, and makes it easy to remove the portions from the baking dish/pan.

Tried it for the first time last night and we loved it. Following other comments, I basted the sauce on the inside of the chicken before adding the cheese (swiss) and asparagus. Notes: it is gooey putting it together! Since it is winter, I had very thin asparagus (used 6 pieces per chick piece) and the ends were really overcooked. I recommend using thicker asparagus. I had some wasabi-saki mustard and used that & it gave it a little zing that otherwise seemed to be missing. I served it over some egg noodles, which went well with the creamy sauce. Success - but with fatter asparagus next time.

Loved this recipe! I followed it exactly and it turned out great. I made it for company which is always a little scary but they loved it too. The only thing I'd change would be to add a bit more of the mayo/mustard sauce to the chicken so it's a little juicier. Will definitely make again.

They were fantastic aside from the fact that the high temperature BROKE my dish.  I will reduce the temperature next time to 425.  At 475, they were done in about 18 minutes (and broke the dish).  We didn't have tarragon or lemon zest, but I can't say they were missed.  Flavor was amazing and the panko made for a nice texture and crunch. Will make again (in a different dish) :)

Followed the recipe with only one change and that was the suggestion to put the mayo recipe on the inside as well as the outside of the chicken.. I found this bland. My panko crumbs were seasoned thank god .. or I probably would have found this completely tasteless. My suggestion would be to add parmesan to the crumbs and maybe pan fry it and finish in the oven. I will try this again with my suggested changes. Btw I had the oven at 425.

I loved it! I normally don't do the lemon zest, due to not having fresh lemons handy but I'm so happy I made it a point to grab one for the recipe, the juice and the zest made this dish complete. I'm a spicy girl so I added red pepper, tabasco, fire roasted sesame oil and a splash of lite soy sauce before microwaving the asparagus for 1 min.  I also made extra sauce and added italian bread crumbs to the Panko crumbs, oh and used Miracle Whip instaed of mayo.

Made the dish last night.  It was terrible.  I think the cooking temperature of 475 degrees is wrong.  I made the dish according to the recipe and baked it for 25 minutes at 475.  All the cheese was gone,melted beyond recognition, the chicken was tough and dry, the asparagus was tough.  I would try it again.  The photo accompanying the recipe looks delicious.  Mine did not turn out like that.  HORRIBLE.

Made this this evening and loved it! I didn't have the exact ingredients - and it would probably be even better if made just as it calls for in the recipe - but it came out fine with my "minor" adjustments. I didn't have provolone cheese so I used Velveeta shreds (a white shredded cheese that is relatively low fat)and I didn't have the panko bread crumbs so I used Progresso Italian style bread crumbs. I also used lowfat mayonaise. It was easy, flavorful, and different from what we usually have. I may fix this next time we have guests for dinner - it also looked really nice!

Made this recipe a few times. Loved it. Only thing is I agree with some other reviews to add some sauce to the center before rolling up. Theres always extra sauce anyways. Great meal to entertain with too since a lot goes a long way. I also used 2 pieces of provolone.

I made these the other night and the comment my husband made was "Wow, these are the best ever!"  I made it exactly as written except I did use lite mayo just because I wanted a little less fat, but I did everything else exact and it was truly delicious.  He has already requested it again for this weeks menu!

Sauce is excellent!  I used Key Lime instead of lemon and it was wonderful.  A good recipe is one that can be altered to accommodate what you have at home and still turns out yummy!  I'm glad to have such a simple option for company!  Served with roasted potatoes and Orange Glazed Carrots from this site.   Also my grocery store will tenderize chicken breast for me and I had them do this when I purchased them, thus cutting out the time and mess of pounding.

Easy yet elegant!  Great flavor--really enjoyed the kick of the lemon zest!  I used chicken tenderloins instead of chicken breasts so I wouldn't have to pound the chicken down so much.  Healthy and flavorful--I felt like a professional chef!

Delicious.  I would slightly lessen the amount of mustard so as not to overpower the dish. 
I substitute any hard/medium cheese my family likes.

I made this for my Mother in Law's Birthday dinner party. A little time consuming but well worth it as everyone loved it.  
I tripled the recipe to have enough for the crowd and had way way more sauce left over than needed. (Doubling the sauce would have been plenty)
I also ran out of asparagus so improvised by adding sliced black forest ham before rolling up the last few chicken breasts.  YUMMM! My husband liked those with the ham the best. I thought they were both delicious.  
Great recipe, would not hesitate to recommend this for a special meal.

The way this recipe is currently I would never fix it again. The asparagus isn't eye appealing at all and it is way over cooked. I would cut up asparagus and use diced or shreaded cheese and cut pockets in the chicken and put asparaguse and cheese in the pockets.

Made these for dinner tonight. I made a few changes. I used some shredded Monterey-Jack instead of Provolone since I had it on hand. I also used some butcher's twine to keep the chicken rolled shut. This dish was AMAZING. It looks impressive and it's very filling. We ate it with a simple salad and everyone loved it. This is definitely in my permanent rotation.

I have made this several times and they are fun to make and look impressive (We still call it pretty chicken).  Changes: Light mayo, no zest, 1 bunch asparagus, 6 breast halves (3 breasts) and Swiss cheese- sauce brushed on both sides of the chicken (lots of suace), oven at 350 for 20 mins. Perfect!

This was absolutely wonderful!  The only things I did different is I used frozen asparagus spears (thawed and drained) and used a toothpick to keep it closed. I can't wait to make this dish for guests!

we loved this! The sauce is soo yummy! Did everything the same except put some of the sauce inside the chicken like some other reviewers said. Chicken was very moist and tender...everything was a perfect blend. Will for sure be making this again! Seasoned chicken a bit too.

Delicious! Took advice of others and spread some of the sauce on top of the chicken before adding the cheese. Used 5 stalks of asparagus as they were thin. Otherwise followed instructions. Will make again!

This recipe is AMAZING! I used chicken thighs, since that is what I had on hand. Also did not use lemon zest and used low fat olive oil mayo. I could only fit 2 pieces of asparagus per rolled thigh, but cooked the rest on the side with olive oil and a little bit of leftover sauce. Also cooked the thighs at 450 for 40 minutes and they were perfect. Next time I will probably do 2 slices of provolone per piece of chicken. This is being added to the rotation, and will be cooked often! Hubs loved it.

I agree w/the others who enjoy reading how people tweak the recipes.  This is my favorite part and I always read the reviews before trying it.  I can't have dairy, so I substituted soy, mozzarella cheese.   Great recipe - thanks.

This was very good, but I didn't use the Tarragon, just didn't have any. I used Italian spices instead. I would make it again, but not for my kids- they're too picky.

I prepared and served this dish for a Christmas Party we had for 34 people.  Everyone raved about it!  What I really liked about it is that I was able to prepare them the day before (easy).  I split large checken breasts lengthwise which I think was ample. I was able to get 18 on a jelly roll pan, placing them side by side, two rows.  Very easy to prepare, cook and serve and looked elegant on the plate!  a great entertaining dish!

This tasted pretty good. I used 5 asparagus as suggested, and they had to cook about 5 minutes in the microwave to get to the bright green and slightly tender stage. I subtituted the tarragon for parsley the swiss cheese for havarti and used plain bread crumbs for personal taste and what I had on hand. I used the lemon juice, but did not notice the zest on the recipe, so I did not use that and I only needed less than half of the bread crumbs. Both the chicken and asparagus were tender and delicious. They displayed attractively on the plate, but with the steps I would save this again for a special night.

These were really good. I did not add the lemon, and I did add prosciutto. I also added some sauce on the inside of the chicken prior to adding the cheese. Very good, will make again.

Excellent dish. I cut back on the lemon and have made with and without mustard. Both versions are tasty. I added ham once and proscuitto another time. I also use whatever cheese I have but provolone slices work best. I also put some of the sauce in the center for extra flavor. I have even made it without the asparagas and it doesn't look as pretty but still tasted great. The asparagas cooks fast so if you can cover it with foil you may be aable to protect them a bit from overcooking.

I forgot the dijon mustard!  I followed the recipe, with the exception of the mustard.  I did add the sauce to the center.  Excellent idea! This dish was outstanding. I can't wait to make it again but with the mustard!

I loved, loved, loved this. So did my asparagus hating family. Okay, so my bf picked the asparagus out but my kids ate it. It was so good, I made it two days in a row. Definitely yummy, although I couldn't find tarragon so just left it out. This would be great to serve to someone you wanted to impress.

very tasty.  I used smaller chicken breasts and had more than enough sauce to coat the inside and out side of the chicken breasts very generously.  Next time if I use smaller chicken breast again I will cut down on the amount of sauce I make.

We really enjoyed these.  I didn't have any cheese but other than that followed the recipe.  Next time I make them I am going to freeze a few of them before cooking......just to see how they turn out.  I think they would make a great quick freezer meal.

This was so tasty. I made it for our gourmet cook friends and they raved about it. I, too, put some sauce in the middle before rolling and I think it added flavor throughout. This would also be great without the bread crumbs. I wouldn't nuke the asparagas first. It gets a bit overcooked. Just put it in raw and let it cook.

Yep, this one was a keeper.  Did it as written.  Just grated the cheese as I was a bit low on  it and that made it go farther. Next time I will make it in smaller proportions, maybe cut the breasts in half. Really tasted allthe elements in the mayo.  A definate do ahead thing for entertainting.

It was only 3 stars as I made it , but I made two mistakes, so I'm giving in 4 stars because I think I could have made it better.  One, I bought but forgot to use the provolone.  And two, I only put the sauce and breadcrumbs on top.  Definitely try to do it all the way around, and don't overcook (I thought mine was a little dry at 22 minutes).  I'll try it again!

Easy and delicious!  I used thinly sliced chicken and layered it rather than rolling it.  (Late night dinner and hungry people.)   Served it with roasted vegetables and rice.

our favorite baked chicken recipe. As others had suggested, I cut the oven to 375.  I used the rest of recipe much as the original one .
 We have tried similar recipes with spinach and broccoli but enjoyed the crunch from the asparagus. We love garlic so I added garlic to the mayo mix and ,as others suggested, I spread the mixture inside and out of the breasts before rolling in the panko.

This is my first review in over a year on this website!  My husband and I loved this chicken dish!!  Only tweaking was to put some sauce inside the chicken before rolling.  I also recommend at least doubling the sauce for dipping.  The sauce was amazing!!

This dish was excellent!  My husband and I really enjoyed it. It looks very nice when done and is much easier to prepare than it looks like. The taste was a very smooth, slightly rich creamy melt in your mouth combo with just a touch of lemon but not enough to be overwhelming. I did not have tarragon so used Basil and a sprinkle of oregano. Also, I have a milk allergy so used “Follow Your Heart Vegan Mozzarella shreds” instead. It melts and taste better than other vegan cheese. Also, no fresh lemon so I used 2 1/2 tablespoons of Real Lemon juice. Also, no Panko crumbs so I crushed cornflakes and used that instead. I know I’m using subs but they are so comparable to the recipe and I can’t imagine it would turn out any better. It was delicious. I served it with a brown rice quinoa mix seasoned with garlic. Will add this to the “make it again” list.

Can't wait to make this again, but will cut both the mustard and lemon in half. I also don't think we needed all that Pablo, maybe 1/2-3/4 cup. Thanks for all the suggestions in the reviews!!!

I've made this several times! This time I used fresh spinach instead of asparagus (currently in the oven). Hoping it tastes just as good. And I put sauce inside the roll up and brush the rest on the outside. Such a yummy dish!

Yummy! I followed the recipe exactly except I had no lemon rind  and panko so i used just lemon juice and crumbled croutons and I cooked at 400F  for 40 minutes because I avoid cooking at high heat.   My family of five really enjoyed. The tarragon and lemon flavors were amazing. The crunchy topping added another level of  yum.  Lastly, there was ample tasty drippings to enjoy with the meat or soak up with side dish.

Made it for my girlfriend last night and both of us loved this! 

I'm used to new recipes having to go through several iterations before they're 'fine-tuned' and tasty, not so with this one.  This was excellent and I will be making this again.  Thank you for this recipe!

This was easy, tasty, and allowed me to use what I had on hand. The chicken was moist and flavorful.  I followed otners suggestions and put some of  the dijon mixture in with the cheese. So good.

WOW FACTOR! This dish is so easy and flavorful! I used what I had on hand. Thin sliced chicken breasts, Jarlsberg lite Swiss, light mayo, and oregano instead of Tarragon (don't have any!) followed everything else as instructed. This is actually the second time I've made this for my Husband. He freaks out over it!! He is so impressed! Although my Husband eats chicken, I do not. I am Vegetarian, but was able to re create this exact recipe using "faux chicken" by Quorn. I used their "naked" chicken breasts. So now that I actually got to taste it for myself, I can totally see why my Husband goes bonkers for it!!

Delicious with fat free mayo and reduced fat cheddar cheese!  Recipe ended up being 4 weight watchers smart points per serving that way. 

Great way to use the fresh asparagus out of our garden. The kids loved it. Will make again!

made as directed with a few slight changes that were made out of ingredient necessity.  Added a super thin slice of prosciutto to each breast. I did not have tarragon so I added basil and crushed fennel seed. My dish was crowded so I baked for 32.5 minutes and then broiled for 60 seconds to brown the panko crumbs. Also blanched the asparagus for 90 seconds as some others recommended. This was very good. My girlfriend said it might be one of the best ever.

I love this! I've made it a few times now, sometimes exactly as written and sometimes I just put in what I have - but I always use panko and the dish always is tasty and very impressive in appearance.  Thank you so very much for sharing!

Very good chicken entree! Used 2 tbs. of Dijon mustard and skipped the lemon zest but did use the lemon juice which seemed like the perfect amount.  The bake time was perfect .

This recipe I have made over and over again.  It is always enjoyed by everyone.  It is very easy, looks lovely, and gets rave reviews by all. To be fair,  the first time I generally stick to a recipe pretty close, as written, but I do consider reviews I have read from other persons who have tested it already.  I think a good cook is able to tell what works and what doesn't prior to even choosing which recipes to try.  
What's the point to completely change up everything before giving it a chance? 
This recipe can make a mediocre cook look great!

This was simply delicious! So easy that even my husband made it. ;) The only different thing in our version was to add a bit of the sauce into the middle of the chicken before baking.

I have made this dish twice and both times the family has loved it.  We are not big fans of mustard flavoring so I mixed the mayo with some dry ranch dressing mix and just a spot of honey mustard.  A wonderful dish!

Turned out great. I followed the directions exactly, except for adding crumbled bacon to each roll-up. I feel that the bacon added that additional zip to what otherwise might have been a bit bland.

Wonderful!  Didn't have Panko so I used crushed potato chips.  Also, did not have a lemon so used a Key lime and only half the zest suggested.  Delicious! Will make it again.  Served with a salad and baked potato.
Lovely meal.

I made this to try for a 40th wedding anniversary I'm catering this weekend.  I tried this along with another chicken rollup recipe I had.  This was the Favorite!  I'm sure I'll get rave reviews from my customers this Sunday!

Made this today for dinner it was very tasty but I did modify it a little bit. I used sharp provolone cheese. I also added 1 clove of garlic minced and about a tsp of olive oil to the sauce. I didn't have tarragon so I used ground dried thyme instead. I also put some of the sauce on the inside of the roll up as well as the outside. I used about 6 asparagus spears per chicken breast. This was the first time we tried it and my husband and I really liked it. I would make it again.

OMG!! LOVE this recipe!! Rarely rate anything but this one really  deserves one !! I have made this about 5 times now &  everyone LOVES IT!!  Tweak a bit each time, EG-- use different cheeses (usually Lacey & provolone ) , put  A LOT of extra sauce between chicken &  cheese, always more asparagus ,  as well as toothpicks to hold it together, but otherwise stick to the recipe as written!! A GREAT "make ahead" recipe as I am NOT a big fan of cooking EXCEPT when I get such awesome compliments (such as with this recipe!!) -- also, I find the changes I do make are much messier than the original so it takes a bit longer to prep!! (Could just be I am NOT a"cooking type" !!) That's okay though!! What a FANTASTIC recipe!! It's ALWAYS in the weekly rotation now!! BF LOVES IT!! Me Too!! THANK YOU!! Much Appreciated!!

Wow, this was amazing, definitely company-worthy. So delicious. Will definitely make this again. Oh, also I forgot to precook the asparagus before putting the roll-ups in the oven and they were cooked through just fine, so I don't think it's necessary to precook them first.

Wondered when making this recipe if the lemon and tarragon would over power the delicate flavour of asparagus and chicken. It did! IF I make it again, would eliminate the tarragon, lemon zest and reduce the amount of mustard.

I loved this recipe.  I'm a beginner at cooking so I was nervous when first attempting this dish. I used marjoram instead of tarragon like suggested because of lack of ingredient.  Everything else I kept the same.  It turned out perfect!!! It really gave me confidence to try other dishes.

I had such high hopes for this. I followed the recipe to a tee with the exception that I brushed some of the sauce inside the roll. It was so overpoweringly lemon-y. I doubt I will make it again. :(

This was excellent!!!  The sauce is the bomb!!!!

I agree with others about putting some of the sauce in the breast before rolling it up in addition to brushing it on. 

I used three slices of provolone in each breast vs. one (all sorts of gooey goodness).  

Toothpicks to hold things together were my friend when making this.  Of course, just don't forget to take them out.  :)

Without a doubt, coming back to this one.

I thought it was very good.  Definitely a keeper.  Two things I would do differently: (1) Buy thin-sliced chicken cutlets. I did pound the chicken breasts but it would have been easier and I think thin-sliced cutlets would have been easier to roll.  (2)  Pre-cooked the asparagus a bit longer, maybe just a minute.  I used fresh tarragon because I had some on hand.  The sauce turned out great.  I served it with a frozen Bird's Eye rice blend - multigrain with tomatoes, onions and spinach spiced up with Italian seasoning, garlic and olive oil.

Very good recipe.  Almost gave it 5 stars.  Easy, tasty and a nice presentation.  It was a touch lemonier than I would  
have liked even after cutting back to 1/2 a lemon  (it was a very juicy one).  Also more mayo mixture than needed.  The mayo mixture mignt also be good on fish.  Thank you this one is a keeper!.

Wow! Love this dish. I made it at friends house to give them a treat and it was very well received.
Then again treated my whole family the next week with help from our 6 year old grand daughters.
What fun and a great recipe.
Thanks.

I have zero cooking skills! None! This was super easy. It turned out delicious. I didn't have a whole lemon, so I only used lemon juice. And I put a little sauce on the inside as well before I rolled it up. Otherwise, that is it. I had to use a toothpick to get it to stay closed also. Will definitely make this again. My 3 year old even ate it!

Delicious recipe.  I added an extra slice of provolone and some of the tarragon sauce inside the chicken before rolling.

My family loved this recipe! My 3 year old had fun snapping the asparagus and helping me roll them up, my 17 year old loved the chicken. We will make it again!

Thanks for the great recipe.  I tweaked it to give it a little kick.  I used jalapeno sliced cheese and used garlic pepper onion straws (Target brand) crumbled fine on top of the chicken breast instead of panko bread crumbs.  Whole family loved it.

Fantastic!! Wow! I used the same ingredients in the sauce (subbing basil for tarragon), but just eyeballed amounts. I added a few more stalks of asparagus since mine were so thin. I baked it at 425 for 25 minutes and it came out great! Thanks for sharing this great recipe, Monica!

Hi This was a great basic recipe...I made exactly from the recipe the first time and it was good...The second time I made it better. 
Used an alfredo  packet with added cream cheese instead of the sauce.
didn't need to add spices and had enough  sauce for topping when serving. I pounded the heck out of the chicken breasts to make them very thin ( they fell apart a bit but I didn't care)If the breasts are too thick there is just too much chicken for a serving. Anyway..
when I assembled them I put them back in the fridge for a while...
I like this recipe because it can be made ahead and taken out about
a half hour before adding the final sauce and panko. I baked it all at 375 for about 30 to 40 minutes.  The chicken was moist and the sauce was a big bonus. Everybody loved it and you will too.
ps: I didn't pre-cook the asparagus...just used five thin stalks.

Excellent!  Here are my modifications:

1) Steamed asparagus instead of nuking it
2) Light mayo instead of regular mayo
3) Mayo mix inside and outside of roll

Everything else I followed as directed!

The Djon mustard was overwhelming as was the pepper. The asparagus was overcooked, short of cremated.

This was pretty good. I did as someone suggested and put a little of the sauce in the middle. I don't mind if some one tweaks a recipe what bothers me is if they don't like it after they tweaked it a lot. Maybe the original recipe would of tasted better to them. Another words if you tweak it and make it your own and you don't like it, them your kinda to blame.

This is dinner party worthy and fairly simple to prepare.  I have make this dish several times and everyone enjoys and the recipe is always requested.  I always try to brine my chicken before using in any recipe; just a quick water, salt, lemon juice, honey brine for a few hours in the fridge gives lots of moisture to the chicken.

Excellent. I loved this recipe.  I followed the recipe with only minor substitutions like bottled lemon juice; plain crumbs instead of panko.  I also added a bit of sauce to the inside.  I omitted the salt in the sauce, thinking that the cheese has a lot of sodium.  (This recipe has 1,170 g ...47% daily allowance.) I didn't miss the salt in the sauce, but next time I would season the chicken itself before assembling the rollups.  I had problems with proportions, not related to this recipe, so sharing them in case they help anyone else. I had two chicken breasts at 23 ounces, or almost 12 ounces each. For recipes that state a number of chicken breasts, I look at the serving size in combination with the number of chicken breasts called for, and calculate how much chicken to use, going more by ounces, not number because sizes are so inconsistent.  I ended up with four roll ups, about 6 ounces of chicken each.  I would have made 6 but would have probably ruined the chicken pounding that thin.  I also added as much asparagus as the rollup would hold just because I had some to use and I like it. I used a shredded Italian blend cheese, lightly sprinkled.  I will definitely make these again.  Delicious.

Excellent recipe that would be great just as it is but I thought that some of the review suggestions sounded yummy and we were not disappointed!  My only changes were to add a bit of the "sauce" to the inside of the chicken and a slice of prosciutto over that, then I added the provolone and asparagus, rolled them up and followed the rest of the recipe.  Very good!  And I am so happy to have a new chicken breast dish!

I made this as written.   The Panko crumbs didn't get as brown as I would have liked but it was a  5 star for sure.  I served it with Mushroom Orzo (from this site)  and that made the dish a ten star!  I also  served it with mixed greens, strawberries, sugared pecan salad on the plate also.  Just a little salad  to make it look pretty.  MY DH has not stopped talking about it.

This was amazing. Like others suggested I put some of the sauce inside as well, and I also poured the leftover to bake in the pan with the chicken. It turned out wonderfully.

If this tasted as good as it looked, it would have been 5 star. I followed the recipe pretty much as written. Took some other reviews suggestions-put some sauce inside-if I had not, it would have been really dry. Cooked at 400 for 40 minutes. Buts lets face it, you can't cook asparagus even 25 minutes and expect it to be good.Cheese all melted out. If I make again, I will make asparagus on the side and cook less and put cheese on top 5 minutes before done. But, then it would not be roll ups. I will make again,  but play with it. Thank you for the great idea!

Excellent and easy main dish. I know tarragon is not an herb I like, so I used an Italian herb mix. Will definitely be cooking this frequently and plan to occasionally use smoked Gouda for the provolone. I think the sauce and crumb topping would be great on fish. Thanks Monica for a fabulous recipe!

Absolutely loved this recipe!!!  This was the best thing I have ever personally made!  I followed the advice of some of the others and only used half a lemon, and maybe not quite all of the tarragon it asked for.  Very vibrant, bright flavor!  
On the inside of a butterflied, tenderized chicken breast:
   I spread some of the mixture, 
   Laid a piece of prosciutto, 
   5 or 6 slim asparagus heads, 
   Added a slice of provolone cheese  
   I folded the breast over, used about 4 toothpicks to secure it
   Spread some more of the mixture on top and 
   Sprinkled Panko on top.  
I baked it at 425 degrees for about 45 minutes.  

WONDERFUL!

My husband is a VERY picky eater and when he says it's "all right", I know I've got a winner - even though I used a substitute cheese and the asparagus I used was a little past its prime.  I'll make this again - with the right ingredients!

Easy to make this entree EVERYONE will LOVE ! Delicious and tastes like a restaurant quality dish.  The sauce makes a wonderful almost hollandaise quality addition, and the panko makes a crunchy wonderful crust.  WOW !  Thank you !

This is a great foundation for an exceptional entrée. I followed the recipe verbatim the first time and saw dozens of options to modify to my own taste.
The presentation is great and suggests much more expertise than is the reality for a very simple prep.
Later versions I butterflied the breasts, added Portobello mushrooms and a slice of cooked bacon (or you can wrap it around the outside and secure with a toothpick) and added garlic powder (to the mix)
I omitted the tarragon and lemon zest, decreased lemon juice to 1 tbsp.
I think this gives the chicken a more robust and less acidic tone and a lack of leftovers confirms the positive reception.

Ok, so this was fantastic! I followed the recipe pretty closely with the exception of two things. I thought I had lemon but did not.. so.. I used lime and then used cilantro in place of the tarragon.  Also, i microwaved my asparagus in a bowl with a little water for 4 minutes (steamed). My husband declared this the best chicken ever!

I've made this several times.  First time I followed the recipe - excellent!  The next time I had button mushrooms I needed to use, so I sautéed them in a bit of red wine & put them between the chicken & the cheese, then added the asparagus.  I used tyme instead of tarragon in the mayo mix and put a bit of that on each breast before adding the other ingredients.  I wish you offered 6 stars this deserves it.

We loved this dish. We took it camping and cooked it in a dutch oven over the campfire. I assembled the chicken, cheese, and asparagus before we left home, holding them together with toothpicks and mixed up the sauce to put on just before I cooked it. It turned out to be a great hit with everyone.

Great recipe!  I made it for Mother's Day and received rave reviews!  I changed nothing except cooking at 375 for 40 minutes.

I made this recipe & followed it exactly! Yes, it had a wonderful lemon flavour which always goes well with chicken. I will definitely make it again and will double the sauce so that I can serve over rice - a nice side for this dish.

My family found that there was too much lemon.  Just back off to 1/2 a lemon perhaps.

Although I didn't have all the ingredients, this is a versatile recipe and the results were delicious anyways.  Sub'd mozzarella for the provolone, and mayo only with Dijon and salt and pepper.  Topped with panko.  Baked as directed.  My husband loved it.  So easy.  Will make it again.  Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe and so easy. I took the previous advice and added cayenne pepper and used pepper jack cheese as we like spicy!  I put the mayo/Dijon mixture on the inside as well - delicious!  Served with wild rice for a quick weekday dinner that would hold up for a dinner party as well.

OK, I have to admit that I changed a couple of things, but not by design but by necessity.  I didn't have tarragon so I substituted thyme instead.  I didn't put any lemon zest in, but I did add about 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder.  Following someone's recommendation, I put some sauce on the chicken  and asparagus before adding the cheese and rolling it.  I AM POSITIVE that it would be good as written, but it was also excellent with my changes.  This is a definite "Keeper".  

I liked it so much that I wrote this review, only the second one that I have ever done.  So if you are thinking about it, just try it!  It is a great dish for entertaining too.

I loved this recipe. I made it just as the recipe said-except that I did add a little of the sauce to the inside of the chicken.  I did think 475 degrees was way too hot an oven however. The sauce burned in the bottom of the pan.

This was truly an amazing dish.I did however make a few modifications. The beauty with this recipe is it's very adaptable. I did not add lemon zest to my sauce, and I used meyer lemons because it's what I had and it was fabulous. I used half the amount of tarragon because I only had a little bit left, half the amount of pepper, and I used not one, but 2 slices of havarti cheese for each roll-up. I baked as directed, then broiled a few minutes.It was THE BEST chicken I've made in awhile, and I am an avid cook.

This recipe is a keeper! My boyfriend is an especially picky eater and he loved this. I added some minced garlic to the mixture and put a layer of it inside the chicken, as others suggested. Next time I'll add an extra slice of cheese!

This was pretty tasty, didn't have tarragon, so substituted rosemary.It reflected well against the mustard and lemon. Good tip to put some sauce in the middle.

My boyfriend begs me to make this. Sometimes I substitute green beans for the asparagus & it works just as well. I also pour a little chicken broth in the baking dish to keep it nice and moist. Great go to weekday dinner.

We really enjoyed this! The only thing I did was follow others advice and added the mixture to the inside before I put the cheese on. I also recommend watching the cooking time. Mine was done after 20 minutes.  Otherwise I thought the flavor was delicious. The lemon makes it.

This is our new favorite dish on allrecipes.com. I was a little reluctant to cook chicken and mayo at 475, but the rollups came out moist and flavorful. I didn't have dijon musturd so I used half spicy brown mustard and half habanero mustard, which added a nice kick. The dish is extremely easy and will be apart of our weekly rotation from now on. Thanks for sharing!

Really yummy stuff!  It's even faster and easier than it looks.  I cut a lot of fat and calories by substituting nonfat Greek yogurt for the mayo and fat free mozzarella for the provolone.  This will be a regular on our dinner table.

I did not have Dijon mustard so I used a Horseradish/Garlic mustard and it worked well.  I wished that I had used more cheese but overall they had good flavor and were very easy and fast to make.

I agree that is you consider a good cook you should be open to being creative in your recipe and not just following what is listed--let your own creative juices flow.  I just recently discovered the fresh herb "cilantro" which brings so much flavor to dishes.  Everyone--happy cooking.

This is my second time making this wonderful dish! I made for dinner party last night and everyone loved it! The only change I made was I added some horseradish to mayo mixture. Thank you for a wonderful recipe.. It's a Keeper!!!

Simple, easy and perfect!!  This is very good, have some aspararus growing our garden and this was a perfect use for it.  And drumroll please, the dreaded "I didnt have this so I substited that" routine.  Well, I personally do not like the taste of tarragon, so the only sub I did was to use some crushed fennel sead in place of the tarragon.  Actually, I think they are the same plant just different stages right?  Anyhow, so good I made it last week and making it again tomorrow.  Have fun and be creative in the kitchen and make it yours!

This is a very versatile sauce.  I have followed this  receipe but have substituted the chicken with salmon and boneless pork chops.  My guests have been impressed with all three choices.  Love it!  Thanks, Monica.

So simple even I could do it.  Delicious.  Since it's only me, I made three and one was plenty.  I also put 5 asparagus in each roll.  My breasts were pretty uniform....4 oz ea.  Will make this for family some night.  I now have left overs for two nights or feed a friend.

The sauce is great even before putting it on the chicken.  I added a little tarragon to the panko, as well to add a little more depth of flavor.  I also doubled the asparagus just because we like it.  This recipe is a keeper!

I baked made this recipe pretty much as written, save reducing the lemon and the cooking temperature, and lengthening the oven time (I did put in more asparagus-- but I think that really depends on the product.  I use the thin "gourmet" variety because I do not like the large stocks).  I thought it was a very pretty, presentable dish, but unlike the others, I was not wowed by the sauce.  The second time I made it, I changed it up to a cooked variation of a hollandaise  sauce with a bit of mustard . I thought this sauce, along with the  provolone was a bit more sophisticated in flavor.  But everyone has their favorite sauces and tastes.  The basic recipe is great and it can be switched up with various vegetables and sauces.

I just tried this tonight and we really liked it.  The panko crumbs browned beautifully for a great presentation.  The flavors blended very well.   I followed others' suggestions and added some sauce in the middle.  Juice from a whole lemon seemed a bit much for my taste so I only used  juice from 1/2 lemon.  I can't say I missed it.  This is definitely a keeper.

Hubby and I agree - BEST chicken ever!!  I forgot to buy the tarragon, used light mayo and added garlic powder and poultry seasoning to the mayo mix.  Mine was done in 40 minutes at 475.  The asparagus cooked perfectly and the panko crumbs crisped up too.  Definitely going into my rotation :)

We've made this several times and love it.  It's a very easy recipe to fix for company, and it's got lots of rave reviews.  I do add a little sauce inside, but follow the rest of the recipe to the letter.  Well Done!

Very good. I just divided a bunch of asparagus between the four breasts. Also, make sure you use all the sauce on the breast when you are brushing it on. I also put a piece of prosciutto on it. I will make it again. Thank you!

I used two TBS Dijon and that was more than adequate.  I also used less salt.  I had never cooked with tarragon before and really enjoyed it!  The more I think about it, I think this would be just as good without rolling up the chicken.  Adding the sauce,  asparagus and cheese on top of the breast would prevent the cheese from coming out of the ends (which happened with mine), and then it could be served with more sauce drizzled over the baked breasts.  I can't wait to try this again soon.

Wonderfully tasty as written. Next time I will try a small amount of the sauce on the chicken before rolling.  Baked at 475 for the 20 minutes- not dried out at all!  Thanks for the great recipe!!!!

I thought this was ok, not alot of flavor. The aspargus gets really charred on the ends it might
be better not cooking the aspargas at all. I put the sauce on the inside too, but still alittle bland for my taste.

This is amazing! I actually put the delicious mustard sauce inside the chicken before the cheese and asparagus, outside the chicken before the Panko, and under the already cooked chicken when serving, making sure to not contaminate the sauce with the raw chicken. It gives it different flavors of the sauce. This dish also freezes well. Thank you for the great recipe!

I made this with grainy mustard instead of dijon, topped with paprika and baked 10 minutes longer (35 instead of 25). Delicious, will make this for company!

I read the recipe earlier today, had all the ingredients on hand, so I whipped it up.  So simple and it made a beautiful presentation, besides tasting delightful.  It's going to be on the menu for sure next time I have company!

Big Hit, Easy to do - I used fresh rosemary instead of dried tarragon, because that's what I had handy.  Also, skipped the zest, but used the lemon juice.  Kids and Dad loved it.  Will definitely keep this recipe handy

I have to make my recipes as gluten free as possible.  I omitted the Dijon mustard and instead of the Panko Bread Crumbs, I crushed Pecan Nut Thin crackers.  I also used all natural Farmers Cheese instead of the Provolone.  I believe I was able to achieve as close to gluten free as possible.  The Nut Thins made a wonderfully crunchy crust, no sogginess at all.  Enjoy!

This recipe is AWESOME! I add some seasoned bread crumbs in with the panko, and also use more dijon mustard than called for. This has become a regular request in my house. I even made it for my picky grandparents, and they both enjoyed it so much that my Grandma requested the recipe.

This dish was delicious! The only change I made was to add a slice of ham to the cheese and asparagus. I also tried what someone else had written about adding a little of the sauce before you roll up the packet and it definitely made the chicken nice and moist. I will for sure be making this dish again!

I slathered the inside of the breast with the sauce before laying down the cheese and then a healthy covering for the panko.  I still had enough for 2 more breast so I know I didn't over do it.   Too much tarragon taste for me.  There are better recipes out there.

Amazing! I omitted the mayo and replaced it with 1T honey and added the sauce to the inside as well.  Baked at 350 instead of the high temperature recommended.  Turned out fantastic. A keeper!

I thought the concept for this recipe sounded delicious, especially since I love asparagus.  I used appx. 2 T. of lemon juice, next time I think I will use 1 1/2 T.  I thought the lemon was strong and overpowered the dish, but overall my husband and I really enjoyed the meal.

This recipe is awesome!  Quick and easy.  I put some parmesan cheese on top, couldn't find the panko bread crumbs so I used progresso instead.  I've made it twice now and everyone loves it!

I am giving this dish just shy of 5 stars because I decided to add bacon around my cutlets for added flavor and moisture!!!  Great base recipe though ...it was a hit with my Latin family that aren't used to American dishes ....they absolutely LOVED it!!!  I've never used Tarragon before so I simply substituted it with an Italian seasoning mix and instead of Provolone, I used a package of shredded Italian cheeses and there was no need to coat with bread crumbs cause the bacon gave the outside enough crunch!!! Definitely making this again ...Im very happy with how my dish came out!!!

This is excellent. I used light mayo, and didn't have tarragon, so I used fresh basil and garlic salt in the sauce. I also used cayenne to spice as one reviewer suggested.  I had 3 medium potatoes to use up, so I cube them and then coated them in the leftover sauce and tossed them in the baking dish with the chicken. Really delish! The timing and temp I think are good! I needed 5 more mins, maybe due to taters. Hubby, Me and Friend Enjoyed!!! Thank You!

This recipe is a keeper.  Thank you.  One of my pet peeves is when someone rates a recipe and changes it inside and out.  I did some modifying but it really did not detract from the original flavours or principal of the recipe.  That mayo-dijon is a great combo!!! Just trying to cut back on the calories so the modifications were to: Use light mayonnaise and doubled the amount of mayo and dijon Omit the cheese and the panko crumbs.   No tarragon as I did not have any on hand. Halved the lemon and zest Added chopped basil-green onions and parsely to mayo/dijon mixture and marinated the flattened chicken breasts in it for the day. Put the asparagus spears in boiling water for 30 seconds then plunged them into a cold bath so they would cool off quickly and keep their colour. Put the rolled breasts on foil on my BBQ sheet.  Cooked them on the closed BBQ off the medium heat for about 20 minutes and they turned out so well.  Sprinkled the rolls with grated parmesan during the last few minutes of cooking...The picture I attached was from the left overs the next day as they were easy to slice up once they had rested in the fridge.  Going to make this again for sure.

This was really good. I drizzled butter over the chicken about 5 minutes before it was done. It browned up/crisped nicely. The chicken stayed moist. Wasn't too hard to put together, and presented well.

Very yummy! I used fresh tarragon and think that the aroma and taste is so much better than dried that it is worth the expense! I agree that the juice of one lemon is WAY too much.  I used a teaspoon of lemon juice and that was plenty.  The only problem I had was the cheese melting out of the chicken packets into the bottom of the casserole dish.  The next time I make this I will make sure that I use a good quality cheese and cut a chunk, rather than a slice. One more thing--I did follow the advice of another reviewer and used the mayo mixture inside the chicken packet as well. Very moist and delicious!

I wasn't sure that I would like this since mustard and lemon aren't 2 of my favorite ingredients, but my fiance is a fan so I decided to give it a try.  I did cut the lemon by a little and added some roasted red pepper dressing to the mix.  I did spread some of the sauce on the chicken before rolling it up.  I baked at 425 as that was the temp for the sweet potato fries I served on the side, and cooked them for 45-50 minutes.  I was so pleasantly surprised by how much we both loved this and how pretty it was.  The cooking time was perfect, the asparagus had just the right amount of crunch, and the chicken was so moist and flavorful.  Thank you.

This was very good I did half the recipe since I had only 2 chickens so I may have been a bit off in my measurements.    My aspagus was very thick so I could only add 3 in the chicken breast.  Also the lemon and mustard was a little strong, I 'd maybe add less next time.    I didn't have tarragon so I added oregano, but I know tarragon would have made it much better, so I will make sure I have it on hand next time.  I also put some sauce on top of the chicken about 15 minutes after I put it in the oven.  It was very good and I would definitely make it again.

I made this last night. Overall it was very easy and delicious. My lemon was very juicy and there was a bit too much lemon for my liking. Also I would suggest 2 slices of cheese for each, nice cheesy filling. The asparagus was superb.

Deeeeelicious!  The recipe makes quite a bit of sauce so I did put some in the middle as suggested.  This is very flavorful--you can really taste the lemon in this, but it's not overpowering, it's just right.  An impressive dish to serve company!

Delicious and easy.  I also used just one half of a lemon because my lemon was particularly juicy and I put some of the mayo-mustard mix inside the rolls as well.

Made this last night as I had chicken escolopes & asparagus both in the fridge. Subbed the taragon for chives as that's all I had & used fresh breadcrumbs as you can't get panko ones in Germany. Was great - it's a keeper! Would also be great with tarragon I am sure - the recipe works really well & looks great!

Very tasty chicken dish, and easy to prepare. I stuffed the chicken with prosciutto, swiss cheese, and asparagus along with some of the sauce. My 9 year old daughter loved it and I will definitely make it again. Thanks Monica.

We loved this. I like tarragon but not a lot so I did half tarragon and half marjoram. I also don’t care for a lot of mayo so I did 2 tablespoons of mayo and the rest Greek yogurt.  I also had large lemons so only used 1/2. I followed other reviewers advice and slathered the chicken with some sauce before rolling up.  If I am not mistaken, the video showed Parmesan being sprinkled on top so I did that after spraying the bread crumbs on the chicken with a little spray oil.  Finally I sprinkled it with a little paprika to aid in the browning process.  Covered it with foil for the first 15 minutes. My chicken breasts were large so they needed a little extra cook time. I cooked to 160 degrees and by the time they sat for a few minutes before serving the temperature was a perfect 165. Delicious!

This chicken was amazing! I took the advice of others and baked it in convection oven at 425 for 40 minutes. Tender and moist and delicious! Will definitely make again.

Really good and elegant presentation. I took the suggestion and doubled  the sauce, and added it inside the roll up. I also did not par  boil the asparagus because I wanted it to be tender crisp. I had very tiny fresh asparagus and I just rolled it up raw  and it cooked just fine. Everyone loved it!

Thought we had asparagus but didn't so used broccoli. (We always have asparagus) Thought we had provolone cheese but we didn't so I used some slim wedges of mozzarella. So with those two main ingredients having to be changed, it turned out pretty good !  My wife loved it ! So will try again with proper ingredients. Then will probably give it 5 stars

This recipe was very good, and easily modifiable.  I was able to use left over asparagus and broccoli from another recipe.  I used pepper jack cheese instead of provolone, to give it a little spicy kick.  Overall this was really tasty and easy to make.

I certainly will make again, my whole family loved it as did I.  The only thing I did differently is put the asparagus in a pan of salted water and simmered about 5 minutes on the stove instead of using the microwave.  Super easy recipe and I liked the fact that I did not have to fry the chicken with the crumbs prior to putting in the oven.

Great recipe.  Light tasty and easy.  I always thought the purpose of the reviews was to be honest and make suggestions so I don’t see a problem with posting variations of this core recipe.  I love asparagus but sometime I like to switch it up.  Today I added sautéed button mushrooms to the filling.  I marinated the chicken breast in a homemade Italian vinaigrette before stuffing. Just butterflied and stuffed it.  No pounding or rolling.  Then wrapped it in one slice of thick cut bacon and baked it covered for 20 minutes. Uncovered for 15 to crisp the bacon.  Served with a tomato salad.  Fancy Sunday dinner for Italian guests on KETO.  Yummy!!!  Same recipe but with variation for special guests.  The core recipe gets my cooking imagination going.  Isn’t that what this is about

This was incredible! However, since I didn't like the mess of rolling them up, next time I'll layer it in my dish. I didn't have panko but cracker crumbs worked well.

We loved this recipe--easy to make and delicious! The sauce really made the dish. We ended up adding another slice of provolone cheese because we couldn't detect the one slice all that well. Definitely a keeper!

I made this for my husband tonight, I am a vegetarian.  it was fun to make it with our fresh picked WI asparagus.  I skipped the tarragon and used an all purpose chicken seasoning I get at Piggly Wiggle. I made sure to season both sides of the chicken & also seasoned the Panko . I used 1/2 whole wheat Panko. He said its a keeper.

We made this on a weeknight when we are always pressed for (prep) time. It is relatively simple and easy to put together. We baked while working on other parts of dinner. Baked according to directions and the rolls turned out cooked thoroughly and the entree was tasty!  Recommended for weeknight dinners...

Very good! My 19 year old son LOVED it.  I only used 1/2 the lemon because the lemon I had was large and I could tell half of it was enough juice.  Other than that, no changes and it was perfect.  I will half the recipe for the sauce next time. I had a lot of that left over.  And I think I will put some of the sauce inside the chicken as well as others have suggested.  Great recipe.

I thought the sauce was very good but it wasn’t thick enough to stay on the chicken while it baked.  Definitely more mayo next time.  Also, if you divide the sauce you can use the half that isn’t used to sauce the chicken as dipping sauce for after the roll-ups are cooked or if you make extra asparagus.

This is really good as written. I think next time, I will decrease the amount of dijon mustard. The flavor stuck out to me more than I would have liked. Otherwise, really good, and made a beautiful presentation!

Great flavor and fairly easy. I took several reviewer suggestions and and added the sauce before the provolone and added some prosciutto. This is a do over!

Great recipe!  I used mayo made with olive oil, 6 asparagus spears per roll up and smeared some of the sauce on the chicken before laying out the cheese and asparagus.   A keeper recipe!

The best part was that my husband loves it. I’ll be making this again.
This is a great go to recipe. I left out the provolone cheese and used crumbled feta cheese this time. Both choices are delicious.

We loved this.  I had fresh asparagus just picked.  The only change I made was I used Jarlsberg cheese because I had that and I didn't have provolone.  This recipe is a keeper.

Another delish recipe! I substituted cheddar because I didn't have provolone.  Don't leave it in too long, or the chicken dries out.

This was a very easy and tasty recipe. I did put some sauce inside the roll ups as others suggested. Next time I make it I will curb the mustard by 1/3 and add Moreno tarragon. Overall very good!

A delicious dish that was easy to make!  I didn't have tarragon so just omitted the spice, but the dish was still full of flavor.  My husband is a hunter so instead of chicken I used wild pheasant.  The Dijon mustard/mayonnaise mixture gives moisture to the meat and the asparagus add a delightful crunch.  I will definitely make this dish again!

Delicious! I will be making this again. Because I’m an extra cheese lover,  I added another piece of cheese on top for Less than a minute at the end of baking time. And I made a little extra mayo mixture for dipping sauce!

Absolutely excellent!  added an extra asparagus and used extra sharp white cheddar instead because that was all I had.  Also used light miracle dressing instead of mayo and it was fantastic.  Good for a Mediterranean diet and a favorite of ours for the future.

Excellent, will make it again. The only change was the cheese, used the Swiss cheese we had. Also took the recommendation to add some sauce inside with the asparagus.

Amazing!  We loved it.  Will try it with broccoli next time or roll more asparagus int the chicken roll.  The lemon flavor was very strong, but then we used a big lemon.  We will use this one for company chicken for sure!

Very flavorful. Did lose a lot of the cheese from melting. Had the wife help me put it together which made for a fun time.

Made it nearly exactOnly 1 tsp of tarragonI wasn’t sure I’d like it but it was fineAnd I did use near all of the zest from a pretty large lemon. Seemed like a lot but it was fine. I did run a scoop of the sauce on the inside of the chicken roll with the asparagus as another suggested. Other than that it was identical. It really was delicious and will make again.

I will definitely make this again, the tangy flavor is great. Will double the cheese as one slice seems to disappear.

Delicious!! Super easy and fun to make. I added prosciutto, red peppers and onion, to the asparagus. Definitely slathered as much of the sauce as I could (and served it as a side sauce dish with dinner), it’s delicious. Highly recommend.

I only gave it 4 stars, only because I did not tasted myself, since I
 a vegetarian so it was only my son who ate it.. HE ATE TWO! alf Breasts and I froze the remaining  for another meal. He realy loved it.  The only change or addition  I made was a glaze after they were cooked. He said it was superb!

Turned out very well.  I made a few substitutions, since i didn't have all the ingredients.  Swiss cheese  instead of Provolone,  lime  juice  and zest  instead of lemon. There was way too much sauce, so I'll cut it in half next time, there seemed to be a little too much dijon as far as flavor goes. We liked it and would make it again!

Next time I will make sure to pound the chicken breasts better: thin, uniform, and big enough to roll!  Flavor was good. For company or prettier presentation remove each from baking dish and serve on a hot platter or such (lots of water from the chicken in bottom of pan)

This is great!  So easy and fast, but "company" quality.  The only change I made was that I only used 1/2 lemon for juice and did not  zest as my husband is not crazy about lemon.  Can't wait to use the same recipe only with ham, Swiss and asparagus!

This is one of my all time favorites. I made it again last week and I'm never disappointed. The only thing I do different (it was suggested by other reviewers) was to put to mayo mixture on the inside of the chicken as well as the outside. This makes for areally moist, fantastic dish. I also use whole grain mustard. I'd give it 10 stars if I could.

I made this exactly as written, although I didn't have tarragon on hand, so substituted another herbed chicken seasoning, which was great.  It was so quick to make, and turned out beautifully--looked and tasted like I spent all day on it.  My family loved it, and I'm keeping this recipe!

Great recipe!  I won't even tell you how many substitutions I made, because I didn't check the pantry / refrigerator  for ingredients.  I did have chicken and asparagus.  So even with all my substitutions, it was still a quick dish that was tasty.  I hope to make it again, and stick more closely to the recipe this time.

Wish I could give more than five stars. I followed this recipe exactly, and I  did put a little of the sauce on the inside, too. This was absolutely delicious!!! Thank you, Monica, for the latest addition to my recipe box.

This was great.  Followed directions and added a layer of prosciutto between the chicken and cheese.  Also, Purdue thin sliced chicken breast cut out the pounding step.  Will make again and again!

I cut the amount of lemon in 1/2.  I put around a Tbsp of sauce inside chicken with cheese and asparagus.  I boiled asparagus for 1 1/2 min. before putting in chicken.  My asparagus was pencil thin so I put in around 7-8 pieces in each chix breast.  I made in FL for 7 people.  reviewers said to double the sauce so I did, but it made a lot, maybe only 1 1/2 times the sauce.  Because making for 7 people I doubled everything including panko, but I had a lot of panko left over.  I added 2 Tbsp melted butter to panko as a reviewer suggested.  Not sure if that did it, but the panko did brown nicely.  I poured sauce over top of chix breast and then patted panko on top.  I baked at 400 for around 30 min.  Check maybe a little before that time, they could have been done a little earlier.

Delish!!!  I made some very minor changes - substituted thyme and dill for the tarragon,  and I don't buy panko breadcrumbs so I just used dry bread crumbs from the crusts that I save for stuffing.  I would use the juice of 1/2 a lemon next time but otherwise, this recipe is a Real Keeper .  Planning to make it again soon.

Made pretty much as directed. Used thin sliced chicken breast to avoid the need for pounding. Added extra asparagus around roll ups in baking dish used leftover sauce on them. Great easy to make recipe.

I love this dish, but I make it a bit differently. I later the asparagus in the bottom of a pan, then put the chicken on the asparagus, then the cheese and sauce (I double the recipe) and then the bread crumbs.

Second time I’ve made this dish. My entire family loves it. Will definitely continue to make this dish. May try different cheeses/meats.  Paired the roll ups with Wilted Arugula salad, another recipe we really enjoy that we found on here. Would highly recommend both of these dishes

We loved this! I left out the lemon, and rolled the chicken in the panko after I put the mustard mix on it.  I also added goat cheese inside the provolone wrapped asparagus.  My husband loved it and thought that it looks very professional!!

This is a great recipe, but you have to like tarragon.  We're not big on tarragon, but wanted to try it.  Only change I made was to add a pinch of cayenne pepper to mix and I did add the mixture inside the chicken. There was plenty of mixture for inside and out.  Next time I will replace tarragon with something else.  Also, I used progresso Italian style panko breadcrumbs.

Everyone LOVED it!!!  Super easy to make.  I read multiple reviews so cut the lemon juice and zest in half.  Did the same with the Tarragon, substituting parsley.   Used chicken breast cutlets as they are thinner and still had to pound them a bit. 
 My buddy who was at dinner said I could have sliced regular breasts in half to make them thinner.  Will have to try that next time.  The wife was worried as this was the first time to make this at a dinner party.  All went well.  Will certainly make again.

I liked it. However I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I think the lemon juice amount should be in a more specific measurement as I used "1 lemon" for the juice and it was very sour. I had to adjust with some more mayo, salt, and pepper, so I'd advise to add the lemon juice bit by bit to avoid this. I also took the advice of other reviewers and added the sauce to the inner part of the roll before adding the other ingredients. The meat was very moist.

It was good, but a bit heavy on the lemon. When I make it again it will be with half the juice and no zest.

I made a variation of this. Thin cut chicken breasts wrapped around the asparagus seasoned with Montreal chicken seasoning. I added jalapeño jack cheese on top. A keeper!

Excellent dish! It turned out great for me even though I had to improvise a bit with regular bread crumbs and freshly grated Parmesan cheese that I wanted to use up. I had even mixed some of the grated cheese with bread crumbs for topping. I wish I thought to photo it at time though because it was picture perfect. Luckily the local food store here sells the chicken breast meat already thinly sliced and freshly packaged.

My family loved this!  I had to bake it a little longer so I turned it down to 400 and added 7 min.  The tangy taste of the sauce made them ask for seconds.

Didn't use lemon zest as many reviewers said it was too lemony, used about 1 tsp of lemon juice.  Makes way too much sauce, and I put it on the inside too, next time I'll cut sauce ingredients in half. Used panko. Will definitely make again.

Oh my goodness, this was delicious! My husband raved over this recipe. He does not like lemon, so I used the zest, but omitted the juice, which enhanced the overall flavors   w/o screaming lemon. I used Penzey’s black and red pepper, which added a touch of heat. I also spread a little sauce on the chicken breast before layering and sprinkled a little smoked paprika over the bread crumbs before baking. Thank-you for this recipe!

Made as directed and it turned out great. Loved the lemon and tarragon flavors together. I too like to read others take on a recipe and often follow other cooks sugestiones. I added some of the mayonnaise sauce to the center of the chicken breast and also a little on top after baking. Will be making this again very soon.

I really liked this recipe. I did have to alter as well since I didn’t have tarragon. I used Herbs de Provence instead and the flavoring was outstanding. I would add a few more asparagus next time.

I'll admit, I wasn't expecting this to be as good as it was. The sauce is very flavorful and the presentation is definitely a wow factor. 

Notes:
 - I made this with chicken breast tenderloin instead
 - Put more asparagus in than recipe states
 - Could potentially add more sauce in the middle

Surprisingly easy to make. I did as stated on other reviews and simply dip the chicken in the sauce,  place one side of the chicken in the panko crumbs, add the cheese and asparagus, and then roll the chicken breasts into a tight roll. 

I also have reduced the dijon mustard to 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons. 

Yum!.

I only made one addition to this recipe and that was adding prosciutto.  I will definitely make again with one change and that was the amount of Dijon.  For us, it was way too over powering but still very good!

So delicious! Can’t wait to make it again.... I am lactose intolerant so I did use vegan dairy free mayo, Dijon, planko crumbs,  grease and even vegan provolone cheese and my family has no idea about it and raved all night about how delicious this dish is!

Great recipe.  The only changes I made were to put some sauce on the inside of the chicken prior to rolling and did not pre-cook the asparagus, as we like a bit of crunch.  I also added a slice of prosciutto to each and rolled them in the panko after coating the outside with the sauce.  Also, 425 degrees is waaaay too hot.  Bake at 350 degrees for 25-30 mins. and it's fine.

I added chopped green onions and used pepper jack cheese instead of cheese called for in the recipe; I also brushed Southwestern Egg Beaters on top of the roll-ups instead of using mayonnaise.

Very tasty & easy to cook.  I added pancetta on top of the chicken and omitted the tarragon because I didn’t have any!  Salt & pepper was fine on the chicken.  I was going to add green onions but chopped them & forgot them on the counter.  I might try just filleting the breast to avoid pounding them. Overall, very nice dish.

My somewhat picky kids crushed this! I used thin sliced chicken breast cutlets to save time, put about a tablespoon of the sauce inside as others recommended, and just evenly divided a bunch of asparagus between the four pieces of chicken - about 6-7 stalks per breast. It actually made my 7-year-old decide she likes asparagus! Definitely going into the regular rotation!

As has been said, put some sauce in the middle of it.  Also, I haven't seen this said, so I'll say it - use more cheese!

I adjusted this recipe to 2 chicken breasts and still had enough of the mayo/dijon spread to add to the inside of the chicken breasts. Coating the chicken before rolling carries the flavor throughout every bite. Added more asparagus as mine were small and tender. I don't think you'd need to pre-cook the asparagus if you're using smaller diameter veggies. Coating was perfect - and the finished dish looked as appetizing as it actually was.

I have made this a few times the last time I did not have asparagus so I pan fried some onion/broccoli/red peppers and some fresh spices from my garden. You can use whatever you like and it will always be great

Great recipe.  The only changes I made is that I did NOT pre cook the asparagus as we prefer it to still have a bit of crunch.  This was just as good as leftovers the second day.  Served it with a quinoa, wild rice mixture. I used gluten free panko crumbs for my wheat alergic son in law

We loved this recipe but the next time I will not pre-cook the asparagus. I used broccoli in one for my daughter that doesn't care for asparagus. I will also add the mayo mixture to the veggie before rolling. Easy recipe, incredibly delicious and fabulous leftovers!!

Made according to directions except that I put the mayo inside and outside the rolls and I sprinkled a little more cheese on top the last 5 minutes of baking. The chicken was tender and moist. The asparagus, which was slender, was cooked through. Next time I'll add more seasonings. Still it was quick to assemble and tasty.

This is a great recipe.  Serve to my guest tonight and was greeted with the exclamation, "Wow! This looks great!" I added chopped pecans as a topping along with the panko crumbs - - great compatible taste.  Great presentation.

Really quick and easy and looks like you've gone to a lot of trouble.  I didn't have the tarragon so I just added some rosemary and thyme and it was delicious.  I've made it a couple times now using different sharp cheeses and next time I will add some ham - very good!

My family loved this dish. Intended to follow the recipe to the letter but came home with mozzarella instead of provolone. Also ran out of panko crumbs and used some Italian bread crumbs. Tangy, crispy and fresh. Served with scalloped potatoes and wowed my family for Easter dinner. Thanks Monica!

I substituted oregano for the tarragon for personal preference.  I could barely taste it over the lemon and dijon. I love lemon and dijon, just not together in this recipe.  They were both competing for flavor and it just didn't work for me.

I made this recipe with the exact ingredients in the original recipe.  After reading other reviews, I made a couple of changes to the method, not to the ingredients.  I added 2 asparagus spears to each breast.  Although I was making 2 servings and only used 2 breasts, I made the full sauce recipe.  I spooned some of the sauce onto the breast before adding the cheese and asparagus and before rolling so the chicken would remain moist and then followed the spooned on sauce and Panko crumbs as directed.   I baked it at 450F for 25 min and served it with the remaining sauce as a dip. My husband said it was the best chicken he has ever eaten! I loved it as well but think it would be even better with some garlic and perhaps some Thyme added- will try it next time as this is a definite winter.

Thumbs up on this one! I for some reason forgot to get a lemon so I used a splash of red wine vinegar and a drop of lemon extract I had in the cupboard. I think the acidity and  lemon taste came through, but won't forget next time. The zest will be a good addition. A lot of the other reviews suggested more asparagus or the addition of ham and think those would both be great. I thought it could also use more cheese (and maybe swiss or gruyere next time...).  The only other change I made was fresh tarragon and I definitely recommend that. This is a for sure easy and fancy dinner at the same time!

I used season salt and coarse ground black pepper , and substituted mozzarella cheese because that's what I had on hand . Overall it's a good recipe , I have also grilled them over low to medium coals .

It was great except I would change the cheese from provolone to some cheese  with less after taste; that was not great.  The rest of recipe very good. Thank you.

I forgot to buy a lemon and panko crumbs so I used lemon juice and Italian bread crumbs that I had.  Still came out great.  This is one of those recipes that you can use your imagination with.  I used 5 asparagus spears nuked for 2 min in a little water and added a little extra cheese.  Next time, I'll also put a little of the mayo mixture in the inside like others suggested - there's enough to do that.  I think I'll also add some garlic and sun dried tomatoes the next time... and remember the panko crumbs!

First I doubled the sauce recipe so I could some sauce to each breast before adding the cheese which I used both Swiss and provolone Yummy!!! I also added a few strips of red pepper with the asparagus which my husband loved. I will be making this again!!

It was a little heavy on the lemon, may use less zest or less juice next time.  I spread a little sauce on the inside as other reviewers recommended and the only other change I made was adding a strip of Prosciutto prior to rolling up.  Great Recipe, will definitely make again.!

Great tasting chicken.
I found I needed to bake the chicken longer than 25 minutes. next time would bake at a lower temp longer so the outer crust doesn't get too crispy

Went back to my recipe. I use boneless, skinless thighs and wrap them around 2 or 3 asparugus spears. Secure with toothpicks and grill outdoors until done. Around 15 mins or until juices are clear. Easy and fabulous. Serve with salad of your choice, rice and fresh peaches as a side.

Made it exactly as written. I used aged provolone which was wonderful.  Just make sure your chicken breasts  are pounded very , very thin. It makes them much easier to roll!

I used a spicy barbecue mustard. Other than that I followed the recipe. It was a nice light meal. I served it with  small roasted  red-skin potatoes and carrots. It was a nice addition.
This is one meal that will be repeated.

Wonderful alternative to weeknight baked chicken. I would definitely make it again however next time I'm only going to juice half a lemon. I also used leftover roasted asparagus which turned out great.

Family loved it! I changed it up just a bit by adding a slice of prosciutto to each breast and using Pepperidge Farm herb stuffing instead of  the panko crumbs for the topping.  I used 1 cup of dry stuffing mixed with 2 Tablespoons of melted butter. The recipe was spot on.  Flavor was delicious,

Great recipe. I had chicken tenders and couldn't wrap the asparagus so just coated chicken and asparagus in the sauce, sprinkled with bread crumbs and covered with cheese and baked.

I doubled up on the asparagus since mine was a little thin.  I followed another commenter's advice and put the dressing inside as well as outside the chicken.  I didn't change any of the ingredients except to sprinkle some parsley, paprika (for color) and a touch more tarragon on top before baking.  The flavors were subtle but melded together nicely.  My fiance' thought honey mustard might go well.  We'll definitely make it again!

This is truly a great recipe, have shared it many times and always get raves! Best recipe to make for someone you want to impress (mother-in-law, new love interest, boss,etc). Can be made ahead for a few hours and refrigerated until cooking time works for guests arrival, may have to add 10 to 15 minutes to baking time to compensate for chilled temp. I love to serve with buttery small new potatoes.

Very good recipe as is.  Make sure that you pound the chicken to the recommended thickness. I added a lot more asparagus as well just because my wife and I happen to love asparagus not because there was anything wrong with the original recipe.  Will make again soon!

These where great! Yummy! I was very impressed with this recipe.  I did put some sauce on the inside of the rolls as suggested by many others.  Only change was that I added some freshly grated Parmesan to the panko and then topped with that. I have 2 suggestions. 1: The oven temperature of 475 is way too hot. I cooked mine at 400. 2: Would  be to cut the lemon juice and zest in half.  I love lemon... but I found it almost overpowered the other flavors. Next time I make it... and there will be a next time very soon, I will just cut back a bit on the lemon. Other than that... perfection!

Super good! I did salt and pepper the chicken before rolling. Next time I'll add a bit of the mustard mixture or olive oil to the center of the chicken because some pieces were a tiny bit dry in the middle. And of course, I added more cheese! Other than that, absolutely delicious!!

It was so delicious and I am not a cook by any means. My husband does all the cooking but I thought I'd make him a nice dinner for New Years eve. 

I didn't have tarragon, so I used Oregano. I used shredded mozzarella instead and it worked out great. I also put the mayo sauce in the rolls to add extra flavor and I added 5 stalks of asparagus.

I'll definitely make it again. My husband really enjoyed it!

I made it for a dinner party. Everyone loved it! Added sauce to the inside as recommended by so many others. It's a great party recipe because I could prepare it several hours in advance, leave it in the refrigerator until it was time to go in the oven. Lots of leftover sauce. I put it out if anyone wanted extra but it didn't need it at all!

Great recipe! I follow the ingredients/directions  except for cooking the asparagus, and I add a slice of ham to the cheese and asparagus. I also spread some of the sauce  on the chicken before the cheese/asparagus. Easy to make but has a beautiful presentation that is company worthy. Thank you god sharing this!

Absolutely will make it again. Will go a little heavier with the sauce next time for more flavor and sauce for the asparagus, and touch of garlic on the asparagus !

So good I couldn't stop eating!  I did change a few ingredients simply because my daughter likes other cheeses better, but pretty much stuck to the recipe!  I did, however, put some of the yummy sauce on the inside of the chicken.  It is easier than it sounds and totally worth the short wait!  This is a keeper!

This was really good. 475 degrees seemed a little high for the chicken. Baked at 400 for 25 minutes, then broiled for another 5 minutes till breadcrumbs browned. I also salt and peppered chicken before and put a little bit of butter in the roll so it wouldn't dry out. Might do with a little less zest next time but overall, very tasty.

Very good recipe. My lemon must have been extra juicy as I thought my topping was a little too runny so I'll cut back on that next time. I also put a little of the topping inside the 'roll' with the cheese & asparagus, and it was really nice. Even my 3 & 8 yr olds liked it - must have been good!

This chicken was delicious!  That being said, it was over-cooked.  Perhaps next time I will cook it for a shorter time or at a lower temperature.  I doubled the recipe but found (sauce too) and had way to much sauce left over so single sauce enough for 8 breasts.  I also put about 7 asparagus in each. Can't wait to make this again.

I made this recipe as written (against my better judgement).  The salt should be eliminated entirely.  There is enough salt in the mayonnaise and provolone.  My husband asked to please not make this again.  I think this could be a good recipe with some tweaks but I'm not going to bother.

My picky husband and I absolutely enjoyed this dish. I followed the recipe and its ingredients exactly as stated, but did layer some sauce inside the roll as some recommended.  I will definitely make again, maybe next time I will use a smaller lemon to lessen the tartness. Delicious!!

We Love this dish.  After reading reviews, I elected to skip the lemon, spread some of the mayo mixture inside, and use Swiss cheese.  Make ahead and refrigerate to allow flavors and crumbs to set up.

used this as a guideline, as I had bought some chicken scallopini. I only had three pieces, so I put 4 spears of asparagus in each, but eyeballed the sauce ingredients to scale it down. Omitted the salt & pepper, and otherwise followed directions. I was skeptical that it would need 475 for 25 minutes, and it's a good thing I was! 7 minutes in, the smoke detectors were flaring up, so I took it down to 375, and still only kept the chicken in the oven for a total of 15 minutes. It was fantastic, definitely a keeper!

Alright! This is a great basic chicken breast recipe that I've now cooked three or four times. The crunch created by the Panko crumbs  and the cook on the chicken are perfect. I followed the recipe exactly, and didn't think the sauce was anything special, so I mixed low fat mayo with siracha sauce instead. Next I'll try with non fat Greek yogurt to try to be more healthy. Regardless of what sauce you use, definitely spread it on both the outside and inside of the wrap.

I made this following the recipe and had to make some changes in order to love it. I read many of the suggestions, didn't zest the lemon, used a small lemon for the juice, used spicy brown mustard instead of dijon, added more asparagus and did not cook it ahead of time. I also put extra sauce inside. With ALL the changes I made, it was delicious.

Because my husband likes thighs, I use that instead of the breast.  I also used Swiss cheese.  Depending on the size of the thighs you might not use all the asparagus.  Made  all the mayonnaise, but didn't use all of it.  Great dish.

Absolutely loved it! This was something new and different for my family and they all loved it. I did everything by the recipe except that I added sauce to the middle of the roll with the asparagus and cheese. This was suggested in previous reviews. The second time I made it, I doubled the sauce and instead of going through the trouble of "rolling" the chicken, I cut the chicken breasts in half. I put the bottom halves into the baking dish and then put a layer of sauce followed by the cheese and 6-8 asparagus stalks. Then I put the other half of the chicken on top and put the rest of the sauce on top of that which was followed by the panko crumbs. This will be added to our family recipe book. Thanks

So tasty! I did not make any changes. I had extra sauce left over, which was great for dipping pretzels in! Served with sweet and nutty Moroccan cous cous. 6 sgs = 4-6 individual meals for our family (2 adults).

This was so easy to prepare! I cut the recipe down for 2 chicken breasts, and instead of Mozzarella I used Horseradish cheese to compliment the Grey Poupon Deli Horseradish Mustard that I substituted as well. I also made a substitution for the Tarragon utilizing Thyme. If I had had all of the suggested ingredients on hand I most likely would have followed this recipe to a T. DELICIEUX!!!!

I have to state that if you have a heavy skillet such as cast  iron (Ihave a small cast iron  skillet) it makes it simple to use the bottom of skillet to pound out breast I have a regular meat mallet but skillet works better

This was super-easy and quite tasty. Followed the recipe for the most part. I don't really measure unless I think it absolutely necessary (I didn't think it absolutely necessary for the sauce), I substituted dill for tarragon (hubby isn't wild about some herbs, and I know he likes dill), used lemon juice from the bottle instead of fresh lemon (therefore no zest), I spread a bit of the sauce on the chicken before rolling up the cheese and asparagus, and I didn't cook the asparagus at all before rolling it up in the chicken. I also was a bit gunshy of the high temp in the oven, so mine ended up cooking for about 33 minutes at 400°F. Hubby and I were both fans.

I think it's a lovely, versatile preparation method for chicken and veggies, and I can see myself playing with this a lot in the future (the best recipes to me are really just a great starting point for making a meal my own). I may try substituting Greek yogurt for mayo, and perhaps low-fat mozza for provolone to try to get the saturated fat down into a more reasonable range. Also thinking about a quick pan-fry of the outside of the roll before baking, as crunchier panko would have been nice.

I made it exactly as directed and it was very good. However, I will omit the cheese next time because the mayo topping is rich enough without it and only 1/2 cup of bread crumbs are necessary (in my opinion). The flavors were delicious though and I will definitely make this again - thanks for sharing this recipe!

This recipe is amazing. I didn't change anything, other than slathering the sauce on the inside and outside of the chicken. The family went nuts for it, there were no leftovers or complaints! We will definitely be making this again, it has so much potential with other fillings as well.

Excellent...followed as written. But for those who don't like tweaks..thats part of making it your own and lots of times you have to substitute vs running to the store to get another ingredient. I highly recommend using Tarragon...it is such a delightful tasting herb...many thanks..great way to use Spring Asparagus.

Great recipe! Wonderful every time. The lemon zest in the sauce is amazing. I always stuff as many asparagus spears in it as I can and use whatever cheese handy. Last time I didn't have tarragon so I used thyme and a little oregano. It was great. I generally have to cook it a little longer as well.

Family loved it!  Cooking the asparagus ahead of time wasn't necessary because mine were thin.  Because I didn't have any tarragon I used Marjoram and it was awesome!  I also put some of the sauce on the inside and that worked great.  I experimented with blue cheese crumbles in addition and I liked it (hubby not so much).  I kept the bread crumbs off mine and it was equally delectable...and impressive!

My family and I didn't like this recipe at all.  First of all, way too much lemon and more overkill with the zest.  The spice didn't do justice to the flavor of the "hollandaise-like" sauce.  This is one recipe I will not be making again. It doesn't taste good.  Maybe it can be tweaked, but I really don't want to waste more chicken and asparagus on this recipe-sorry.

Didn't add the lemon zest, but did everything else according to the directions and my wife and I both loved it. Very easy to prepare and even looked presentable (I'm an intermediate cook at best and my first attempts at a new recipe don't always look like the pictures).  I will definitely do this one again!

I always read through some comments before preparing a new recipe. And I am glad I did with this one. I didn't have tarragon on hand so I used dill. I subbed the provolone for mozzarella. And I measured the lemon by taste. When a recipe calls for something in whole, and not a measurement, it's always good to do this. The size of your lemon will definitely affect the outcome. So go by personal preference. I also roasted my asparagus for a few minutes instead of flash cooking in the microwave. A bit more time consuming, but adds so much more flavor. I did change the temp as well to 425° for 35/40 minutes. I definitely recommend this dish. Accompanied by penne pasta with cherry tomato sauce and caesar salad. Delish.

I made this and it was soooooo good! I followed the directions and purchased the tarragon. Only thing I did different was leave it In the oven for 35 minutes ( I like things a little extra well) lol !! Great easy recipe!! The lemon and other ingredients meshed very well and I would suggest leaving nothing out! The flavors will leave a party in your mouth! I served with a vinegarette  onion & cucumber salad and Dominican rice & peas

I loved this recipe. Followed the recipe exactly except the time I had to go an extra 15 in the oven. They were still very moist and juicy. I would love to try this with different stuff too. This is definitely a new recipe my family all loves. Thank you for sharing

Wonderful flavor, and one of the simplest stuffed meat recipes I have made. I did paint the inside with sauce prior to stuffing, otherwise cooked as written.
If you are worried about the lemon, use about half the amount then taste as you add. If you like the flavor by itself (it should taste a bit strong but not overwhelming), then you will like the result.
Also, your dried herbs MUST be fresh! If your tarragon is several years old, then it will taste like green dust.

A little heavy on the lemon with both the juice and zest...but I did use a large one.  I really liked the sauce, asparagus and pan ko but might use 2 pieces of provolone per breast next time.  Very pretty entree!

This was excellent and easy to make.  Only thing I would change is omit the lemon juice-too strong.

Delicious!   I omitted the tarragon because I didn't have any.  I also used Gluten free bread crumbs because of a diet restriction.  The family loved it!

Absolutely fantastic. Like other reviewers suggested, I spooned a little bit of the sauce onto the chicken before I put the cheese on. I was still left with about half the sauce, which I ended up throwing away - so definitely don't make so much sauce! All in all, this was a simple, delicious, impressive recipe that I will most definitely be making again!

Tasted great! Took the advice of some other reviews: added some cayenne to the sauce, and double the sauce so I could spread it on the inside of the chicken before adding the cheese and asparagus. I also sprinkled fresh Parmesan on the very top of the chicken crusting.

Easy and tasty recipe. I didn't have any tarragon and used chives. The tarragon would provide a really nice addition. Even so, very good!!

I made this last night.  It was really good; my husband loved it.  I found that it made about twice as much "sauce" as we needed for 4 chicken breast, so I saved 1/2 of it and we're going to try it with pork this evening.  I also found the tarragon to be a little too strong.  I'll cut back on the tarragon next time.

asparagus & provolone were lost under the strong flavor of the sauce. this is an attractive looking dish but the star was the panko breading. If you like asparagus use it as a side & omit the cheese. The family all liked it but all I could taste was the chicken and the mustard

I subbed in smoked gouda for provolone and greek yogurt for mayo. Very quick prep for a tasty product. I would make again. Easy to see variations (broccoli instead of asparagus, spinach and feta instead of asparagus and provolone...)

We loved this recipe!  I made it for dinner and it was easy to put together, tasted like fancy dining, and not a drop left over.  It was wonderful.  The only change I made, was I added some of the sauce to the asparagus before I rolled the chicken up.  If you are looking for something different and delicious, this is your recipe.-Holly Doyle

I served this to my extended family last week. Comments were that it was moist, but that the lemon overpowered the other flavors. I must have used too much zest, but the recipe called for the zest of a lemon which is what I did, but doubled the recipe for the group of 7 to feed. I left the zest as if for the normal recipe and it still was too lemony. I'll do some adjusting when I try it again. I also noticed that much of the cheese runs out into the baking dish. Maybe toothpicks through the ends to seal would help. Thanks

I fixed this last night for supper and thought it was quite flavorful with the tarragon sauce. However, I was very concerned about the 475 degree temp and rightly so. I don't know if it makes a difference, but I didn't have provolone and used mozzarella.  There was basically no evidence of cheese (as in the picture) since it all melted out and burned to the casserole dish. Wasn't very pretty, but still tasty. Next time, I'll likely back it down to 425.

This recipe was simple, quick, and delicious! We eat a lot of chicken so I'm always looking for new ideas. I actually assembled the dish ahead of time, except the bread crumbs, and put it in the fridge. When it was time for dinner I put the crumbs on top and baked. This dish is excellent for company.

Delicious!  The variations I made were minimal....didn't zest the lemon, just juiced it.  I didn't have bread crumbs so I crushed some butter crackers and mixed it with mayo mixture to put on top.  Before I mixed crackers in, I did put some of the mixture in center too and I think this prevents it from being dry.  I cooked at 425 for 30 minutes, uncovered, and it was delicious.  I think next time I would cover last five minutes or so as it was starting to burn on top.  After microwaving asparagus for 1:30 minutes, they were perfect consistency coming out of oven.  Great and easy!!!

This is a hit!  I can't wait to make it again!  The only change I made was that I didn't have dijon so I used honey mustard with a drop of yellow mixed in.  For the panko crumbs I used 4C Seasoned Panko.  I took the advice of another reviewer and added sauce to the middle with the asparagus and cheese.  As a side dish I made noodles in a thai sweet chili sauce (it was all I had on hand but it worked well). My husband is still raving about it this morning.  Very easy to prepare and absolutely delicious!

I've made this twice and really like this dish.  I did find it a little difficult to flatten the breasts to 1/4".  Maybe next time I'll split them horizontally before flattening them. It was hard to roll when they were too thick.  Loved the flavor, and the chicken was very juicy.  There was a great deal of sauce in the recipe, and I ended up throwing some away.  When serving I sliced the breasts on the bias and it looked so pretty to see the asparagus and cheese in the middle.  Delicious! I'll definitely make this again.  It's so easy and pretty enough for company.  Thanks!

Wonderful recipe! Surprisingly easy to prepare.! It's a very elegant looking  dish. When I make this again I will  put some of the sauce over the asparagus also before rolling them up. My adult daughters were over for dinner along with my two grandkids. They loved it.. Along with my husband. I will be making this again!

Stir-fry asparagus with butter, garlic to give the surprise center a little more pizzazz.  Pounding hint helpful, cut in half, using quarter breast is nice size.

I made this last night and was pleasantly surprised at the flavors melding together.  The Dijon mustard flavor with the lemon and tarragon!  Delish!  I substituted green beans in my husbands as he is not an asparagus fan, but for me, nothing could be better!!

I read the recipe yesterday and decided to try it. I had to shop first and find all the ingredients.I cooked it for supper to surprise my wife. I didn't change anything except cutting back the salt and adding a garlic butter combination on the tops 1/2 way through the cooking. It turned out wonderfully saving me from elimination in the latest master chef.

I baked mine at 450 for 25 mins. I think I should have taken out after 20, it was bit dry. Thankfully I had extra hollandaise sauce that save them.

Tried it with spinach too. Very good! Has anyone trid freezing these? I wonder if you could prepare a bunch if them at once and then freeze it? I would be curious if that would work.

I made this tonight and we could hardly eat it. The Dijon and lemon were overpowering and there was so much sauce that we had to scape it off. Still, there are some good ideas in this recipe and IF I took the time to try this again, I would cut the mustard by 2/3 (as it was, I had cut it in half), cut the amount of lemon juice in half and use only a little touch of zest. Cut the entire amount of sauce by at least a half. The aroma of this dish was so pungent that I'll be airing out the kitchen for a while. Disappointed with this one. But the fresh asparagus was good!

This was ok. I think a little less Dijon mustard for me next time. I also think I would like my asparagus cooked outside the chicken for full flavor. It gets lost in the chicken and sauce mix. I  couldn't taste the cheese at all. I read the reviews first and cut back to 1/2 cup of bread crumbs and that maybe was still a tad much. I'm not saying I disliked this recipe, just need to change it up a bit for personal preferences.

Yum, Yum, Yum! I did what others suggested by spreading sauce between the chicken and cheese then coating the roll-ups with more sauce before rolling them in the Panko. I personally don't care for anise flavored anything and almost used parsley instead of the tarragon but decided to be bold in thinking that cilantro would taste wonderful in the Dijon lemon sauce and I was not disappointed :-) If anyone else out there is like me and is not a lover of breasts please know that using boneless skinless thighs works wonderfully too! Thank you for a great tasting simple recipe, Monica!

This is a great recipe - the lemon and lemon zest really add a zip to the sauce.  Great base recipe - I added a thin slice of ham, than cheese and asparagus - great!  Easy enough but looks and tastes like you spent hours.

Next time I will use smaller breasts and pound them flatter.  I cooked as directed and the chicken did not get done all the way through.  The taste was good in spite of the dryness.  Will try again.  They look so nice!

this recipe was great! so easy to make. i did make some adjustments. i'm gluten free, so used gluten free panko breadcrumbs. Also, i used swiss cheese and the asparagus/mushroom/onion saute from trader joe's for the filling. As others suggested, i put some of the sauce in the middle. helped to keep the chicken nice and moist. will definitely make again!!!

I would have given this recipe 5 stars but the lemon flavor was over powering. Now I love the taste of fresh lemon and lemon zest so I was excited when I read the recipe but even I thought that the juice of one whole lemon sounded like a lot and I should have trusted my instincts. Everything else about this recipe was wonderful and I will definitely make it again but I will use 1 tbls of lemon only. I did substitute Swiss cheese for provolone and rosemary for Tarragon because this is what I had on hand. I will also follow the advice of other reviewers to make extra sauce and put a tablespoon of it inside the chicken before I roll it. This is a great recipe to serve to company and is sure to impress.

Wow!!!  This was so good. I didn't have any tarragon so I replaced it with thyme and rosemary. I also added some fresh garlic. Other than that, I followed the recipe. This was quick, easy, and good.

Delicious.  I followed directions almost exactly, used thin sliced chicken breast, and as others suggested spread mayo mix on inside and out.  Baking at 475 scared me, though I started to cook at that temp against my better judgement and eventually reduced to 400 and kept an eye on it.  Cooked for closer to 20 mins.  Very very good and easy to make.

Thank you for this recipe! My family has enjoyed this twice now and I never would have thought to combine those flavors without you! Sadly, I was not faithful to the recipe, sorry. I used sour cream instead of mayo and marjoram instead of tarragon (I didn't have those items and wanted to try it so I looked for replacements....) Also, the second time I made it I used boneless skinless thighs because they are already so flat and long. Delicious with the dark meat!

This was REALLY delicious.  I added prosciutto, used 1/2 juice of lemon (no zest) and I did cook it at a lower temp (375) for a longer period of time (about 30-35 minutes).  I also put the mayo mixture on the inside of the chicken as well as the outside.  it was packed full of flavor!

Wow, this is definitely a new favorite!  I typically steer away from recipes which require flattening the chicken, but this one kept the chicken surprisingly moist and juicy.

I made a few changes:
(1) I replaced the 1/2 cup of mayo with 1 1/2 TBSP brummel & brown (made with yogurt) to cut down on the fat.
(2) I didn't have dijon, so I replaced with 50% brown mustard/50% regular mustard mixed with honey.
(3) Replaced panko with regular Italian breadcrumbs.
(4) Replaced the provolone w/ parmesan.
(5) No tarragon, so used an Italian spice blend.
(6) Added toasted almonds on top before serving. 

When I make in the future, I would continue with the brummel & brown, Italian breadcrumbs, and almonds.  However, I do think that provolone would much better complement the flavors, as well as the dijon mustard. And I agree with the other comments - I would double the asparagus.

Soo good. I didn't want to dry out the chicken so lowered temp to 425 and cooked it for 35 minutes.  I did put the sauce inside and extra asparagus.  Very tasty and even smelled delicious when cooking.

This is an easy dish to make and very tasty.  I don't care for Dijon Mustard, so added 1/2 tsp. yellow, just enough to spice up the mayo.  Looks great coming out of the oven.  I will make this again.

This relatively easy recipe exceeded expectations.  I would suggest that, if you aren't watching your calories very closely, to add a second slice of provolone cheese.

These were yummy!  I debated between giving it 4 stars or 5, only because I followed others' suggestions and added some of the sauce to the asparagus/cheese middle.  But I decided on the 5 stars just because the flavors are great together (the sauce melted together with the cheese, and was yummy on top of rice!).  I started baking it at a lower temp because some said it was too high, but ended up turning up the temperature so the panko would brown.

Instead of making the coating/sauce the recipe calls for, I breaded the chicken breast with Shake and Bake parmesan coating. It was simple, quick and tasted great.

I made this last night.  I have never used tarragon and didn't like the smell when I opened and sniffed the bottle, but when it all came together it was awesome.  I did cut back a little on the lemon and doubled the asparagus but that was the only change I made.  Yum, yum, yum!

I made this as told only to add sauce to the inside of the chicken with cheese and asparagus My husband thought it was very good. I thought it was easy and good. Next time I will add thin sliced ham inside also. Thanks again.

This recipe was a hit for mother's day supper. I didn't have tarragon so I used marjoram as some other reviewers had done. I also used swiss since provolone is not all that easy to find. Next time will definitely  try with provolone as some were saying they barely tasted the cheese.  I do not think that the asparagus needs to be cooked beforehand and next time won't cook them. This recipe is definitely a keeper and will be making an appearance in my kitchen often.

Love it!  Will fix it for my family, again!  Next time, I may add sauce with the cheese and asparagus.  Didn't have tarragon, so I skipped it and added Johnny's Seasoning Salt.  It's a northwest thang!

Wow!  Very delicious!  Even the kids ate the asparagus.  Not a fan of tarragon, so I used lemon pepper.  My husband commented on the very professional presentation...looks like restaurant food!

This was excellent! My family really enjoyed it. Even the neighbor boy liked it but I did add some chili powder to spice it up a bit and I think it was a bit too spicy for him. My son wouldn't eat the asparagus but that's because he's 9 and has decided he 'does NOT' eat vegetables... :(  I didn't have any tarragon so I put some Old Bay and lemon pepper (also didn't have an actual lemon, so used lemon juice). It was super easy to make except I didn't have a meat mallet... Also used light mayo, next time I might try to lessen the fat more with some of the other suggestions. 

BTW, I LOVE the reviews and alterations people make that make the recipe better!! Keep those cards and letters coming!

I grow asparagus and raise chickens so we'll be trying Monica's recipe-it has my mouth watering.  DawnTrinty needs to see the bigger picture.  Reviews with hints of improvement can be very helpful.

I was in a hurry, so I layered roasted deli chicken with the cheese and asparagus, and spread the sauce on top. Then I baked it until the sauce was hot and beginning to brown. It was a very good fast dinner. I'm sure the full recipe is delicious.

I found the sauce was too lemony so I think next time, I'll use less. But my boyfriend loved it. He was finished his chicken before I even sat down to eat. And he had to fend off his coworkers. All in all, it wasn't bad. I'll make it again.

Hubby loved it!  I think the lemon was a little strong, but still very very good alternative to the average chicken breast dish.  Good one to make for company as it looks impressive too!

The recipe is simple.  I did lighten it up a bit with using a reduced calorie mayo, and was really light on the bread crumbs. I loved the full flavor of the tarragon and provolone.  Also, I love asparagus, but my husband doesn't, so for him, I used broccoli. That worked out surprisingly well. We both enjoyed the flavor.

I've made this recipe 3 times and will make again many times.  I made it just as it's written but left out tarragon as I didn't have any and it was delicious without.  Everyone including the men like it.

Made these the other night and they turned out really good. Next time I'm going to reduce the amount of lemon in sauce as it was a bit too strong for us. A great recipe that we'll use again.

This was awful!  Why two stars?  Because it has great potential.  The lemon was overpowering and we couldn't enjoy the meal. However, my husband and I both agree that the recipe would be so good without the lemon.  I will be making it again...with only a tablespoon of lemon.

This recipe is a keeper!  I didn't have asparagus, tarragon or provolone so I used carrots, fennel seed and muenster cheese instead.  I love the mayo sauce.  Will try it with asparagus next time.  But it was delicious regardless. Made it with a side of quinoa.

This was a restuarant quality dish!  I used extra asparagus by personal preference, and from other comments spread the sauce on the inside as well as the outside of the chicken breasts.  I substituted plain greek yogurt for the mayo with prefect results - this was an amazing entree!  Wish I could give it 10 stars!

Made this for my family & everyone loved it!!! Even my nephew who is one of the most picky eaters I know thought it was good.  For my sister who is a vegetarian, of course all I did was put the asparagus in a baking dish, top with shredded cheese, the sauce & sprinkled bread crumbs on it. My sister's little 3 year old granddaughter loved it as well!!! Can't wait to make it again!!!!!! Thanks!!!

This is a great recipe!  I just made it for my husband and will make it again and again and again!  I'm even going to volunteer to have a Christmas party, because this recipe will be so easy, pretty, and tasty.  I added a little of the sauce inside the roll up and put in a couple extra spears of asparagus.  I paired it with a salad with homemade balsamic dressing---a lovely, elegant dinner!!  White wine goes nicely, also.  Try it!

This came out so good. I made no changes at all. Everyone loved it. The only thing I think I'd do different is double the recipe and add more asparagus. My husband would have liked another piece, and I'd of liked to have some left over for lunch. Also, I think I'd take the others advice and add some of the sauce to the inside. The chicken was tender and it was delicious!

Out of necessity I used regular bread crumbs and brown horseradish mustard (that's what I had in the house) will stick with the same mustard next time but will add more. Did put some sauce on the chicken before adding cheese and asparagus. Cooked at 375 for about 50mins just to accommodate the side dish I made (Au Gratin potatoes). This is a keeper!!!

Loved the idea but only had chicken and asparagus so had to get a little creative. Used an egg white with a splash of half and half and sprinkle of thyme instead of the mayo mix to help the bread crumbs stick and a mozz/feta combo for the cheese inside the roll. Turned out pretty tasty, but I think next time I'll try sour cream for the chicken wash to give a little more flavor.

Easy to make but don't think it had enough flavor and moisture.  I used one slice of provolone and it probably could have used 2.  I followed the directions closely, only adding a thin layer of mustard sauce to the chicken prior to adding cheese and asparagus to roll up.  Looked great, however, I wish they had tasted as good as they looked.  Probably won't make again.

Terrific! Easy to prepare. We only had chicken tenders so we made it "sandwich" style instead of rolling. Cheese held it all together nicely. Delicious.

I baked everything at 375 for about half an hour and it worked out well.

Considering how easy this was to make, it was DELICIOUS!!  I only substituted the dijon with honey dijon.  Other than that made as is.  I may go a little liter on the spices and lemon zest next time, but I will definitely be making this again.

Loved this! As other reviewers mentioned, I put 1T of sauce in middle, a slice of proscuitto, swiss cheese, 7 asparagus & used marjoram instead of tarragon. Did not have panko bread crumbs, so I crumbled a roll & mixed it with stovetop & regular bread crumbs.

Easy to make and extremely tasty.  Took advice and added sauce to inside before laying the cheese. It added extra flavor to inside.  I made 1/3 the batch leaving out the Dijon for my picky 10 Y.O. daughter. She loved her version. We loved the extra flavor of the Dijon. (including the 2 Y.O.) My husband rated it as "Governor Approved." (That would be a 10/10) Oh, and definately need to precook the asparagus as directed if you want it tender. You may want to omit the salt if you don't like things too salty.

Cooking time was a little off.  I had to cook about 20 minutes more, with the time listed, the chicken was still pink, but a good dish.  Thank you

Even my nine year old who normally doesn't like asparagus gobbled this up.  I did use mozzarella because that is what I had on hand but I think any white cheese would be good.  I also used miracle whip instead of mayonnaise because that is what I had and less lemon juice.  It was awesome and my husband said excellent!

Great recipe! I cooked this for my friend and her two grown sons and they loved it!  I did modify the sauce just a tad and didn't use the panko crumbs on her piece since she's on a diet. Came out great and we agreed we definitely need to make this again soon!

I thought this was out of this world! I did replace the provolone with swiss because I like a little more bite. And that worked great for us.

I used swiss cheese and topped with sesame seeds. Served with scalloped potatoes and roasted brussel sprouts with figs and walnuts. Finished with strawberry rhubarb pie. This was a fabulous meal!

I love this recipe and it pairs great with mashed potatoes, veggies or a salad. I used only half a lemon though and a bit more of the spices. Also cut some green onions and sprinkled on top. I will make this again for sure!

Made this for Mother's Day lunch!  Delicious!!  I didn't have a fresh lemon, so I used 2 T. of bottled lemon juice.  Also, put a layer of sauce on the "inside" of the chicken before adding the slice of provolone & 5 asparagus spears.  Plenty of sauce left to top all 6 chicken "bundles."  I had to cover with foil & keep warm while the dinner rolls baked, so by the time I served this, there was an unsavory water-y looking "broth" in the bottom of the pan, but that was my fault for not timing everything just right!  Was still delicious & the Moms were so-o-o impressed!  Thanks for the recipe, Monica!

Very tasty!  I doubled the sauce since I was cooking for 5 but found it was not necessary.  The tarragon/lemon/asparagus tasted very bright and fresh.  A keeper!

It was so good!! I used low-fat mayo and used less than the recipe called for. I also substituted a different mustard and added cayenne pepper. It was absolutely delicious.

I really wanted to try this recipe for supper, and had all the ingredients on hand except the asparagus.  Intended to go to the grocery store to pick it up, but the day (and my 2 toddlers) got wild and I never made it there.  But this is a great recipe, even without the asparagus! I served it with rice pilaf and green beans, and everyone loved it.  I used thin sliced chicken breast, and the juice and zest of only 1/2 a lemon.  I highly recommend this recipe!  Thanks for sharing.

I made this EXACTLY as written (that's rare for me!!). I gave it a strong "OK" but not one I would repeat. I could envision a pesto based sauce or even a cream / lemon/cilantro based sauce but the one in this recipe was just OK. But, as for presentation it was really attractive.

How did everyone else's turn out perfect?  My asparagus was all dried out.  And the sauce was so clumpy on the chicken - maybe I used too much, but I used the exact amount in the recipe.  Help??
