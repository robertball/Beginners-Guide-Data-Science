This was absolutely delicious! And so so easy to make. Not too rich, just the right amount of sweetness and the texture is airy and divine! Just make sure you beat the cream to very stiff peaks before folding into the other ingredients. Next time I make this I think I will use it as a frosting on an angel food cake...I will definitely be making this again!

This was my first mousse and it was seriously easy and insanely addictive. I did make 2 changes to the recipe though. I used marscarpone instead of the cream cheese.  Same texture, just better flavor. I'd eat a spoonful of marscarpone, but not cream cheese, and with so few ingredients, you definitely taste them all. Also added a little lemon juice for an extra lemony kick.

Love, Love, and My Husband Loves this. I prefer fruit to chocolate for most candy and desserts. This was easy, and I immediately added it to my recipe box. I did not alter the recipe in any way except for I had just juiced an entire bag of lemons and made homemade lemonade, and a giant bowl of Lemon Curd.  Can't wait to try the No-bake Lemony Cheesecake next.

Made it for a family supper. Used mascarpone instead of cream cheese. Added 1 tablespoon of sugar and 1/4 teaspoon of lemon extract to the whipped cream. Juiced 1 Meyer lemon and added that to the final mixture. Rave reviews from the family. A very big hit with the family.

I made this with my own homemade curd and it turned out perfectly.  Tart, fluffy, creamy, so lemony. A keeper for sure.

Everything was great except for the Almond Extract. I'm just not a fan of it. I substituted Lemon Extract instead, just two drops. Tasted great. I imagine Vanilla Extract would also work, or none at all

This is the second time making this. It is one of our favorites. It is light, lemony and the perfect bite.

Iâ€™ve made this recipe time and time again!! Gets better every time I make it. To save some time, buy lemon curd at the store :) To use this mousse a different way, add it to the top of a tres leches cake! Out of this word!!

This was delicious.  I did not add the Almond Extract as I did not want it to  fight the lemon taste.  I did use the Neufchatel (Light Cream Cheese) and served it with strawberries at Easter lunch and everyone loved it.  For those of you who can't find Lemon Curd in your grocery store, at least with Kroger, it is on the baking isle, not in with the rest of Dickinson's Jams & Jellies.  Also, Trader Joes makes an excellent Lemon Curd.

So refreshing and easy!
I used vanilla extract instead of almond, and 5 to 6 packets of  True Lemon to pump up the lemon flavor.  My friends LOVED it, and have requested the recipe and that I make it again.  I served in 4 oz Ball jars.  So cute!

Because one of my guests has allergies, I switched the almond extract to vanilla extract and the finished product is delicious.

OMGosh! the family loved it. We made a crust from 55 vanilla wafers, 6 T butter, and approx. 20 crushed lemondrop candies from another lemon mousse recipe here.  It was even better the next day.

I made this for a small family dinner that my mom and I hosted for a few out of town relatives. It was perfect. We had made a lasagna and this light, fluffy mousse was the perfect finishing dish. It had an exquisite pairing of sweet and tart flavor. Like another reviewer I used marscarpone cheese rather than cream cheese so as to not over power the flavor of the lemon. In addition, I chilled it over night so that the dish would have time to set like a regular mousse; however, four hours or so should suffice to do the same. Everyone loved this simple dish, and I will DEFINITELY make this again!

I make this with a vanilla wafer crust and use the smallest size mason jar. They make a refreshing summer dessert and the leftovers stay nice in the mason jars.

Loved it! Very light and airy. Perfect for summer!  Made it for my husband on Father's Day and there was none left!! Will definitely make again and maybe use more lemon curd or add some lemon extract for a more pronounced lemon flavor.

This is fabulous. Very simple to make. I used homemade lemon curd, and I don't consider than an alteration of the recipe. I had mine with blueberries, and others my family had blackberries in theirs. My daughter ate hers with white chocolate chips.
