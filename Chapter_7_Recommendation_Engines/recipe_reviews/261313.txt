I give this recipe no stars, because it is the worst waste of expensive ingredients and precious time I have ever experienced.  It tasted horrible when I scraped the globby mess out of the pan.  The word I would use to describe this awful stuff is “Pesh”.  Dont waste your time or ingredients on this ...its was not salvageable.

This is thee worst recipe for pancakes. 
Im not sure who proofed this.
Waste of time, money and ingredients. 
Fyi, you need a starch in there to hold the batter together eg tapioca. 
Would give it a 0, however i need to rate it.

This was delicious! But the recipe calls for way too much baking powder. I halved the baking powder right away, doubled the banana, and added a touch of vanilla extract and a couple sprinkles of ground allspice. I also used regular all-purpose flour. They turned out super fluffy, the amount of banana was perfect for me, and the texture is very nice. Definitely one of my new favorite recipes!

I made mine with regular flour and oat milk and they turned out nice and fluffy. I personally would’ve like more banana, but that’s just me. I really liked this recipe

This recipe is terrible. Do not make this. The pancakes burned immediately even at the lowest heat and fell apart when I tried to flip them.
