Yum! These biscuits come out very light and fluffy with a rich (but not too rich) taste and mouthfeel. If you don't have self-rising flour (like me), use 2 cups less 4 tsp. sifted flour, 3 tsp. baking powder, and 1 tsp. salt.

Very Delicious!  This is more the texture of a  light roll, than a biscuit.  I did not have self rising flour, so I put 2 cups all purpose flour in a bowl, then took out 4 tsp. and then added 3 tsp. baking powder and 1 tsp salt.  You must use real mayo, not Miracle Whip.  Don't even rate the recipe if you use miracle whip, because the roll will not have much flavor. The batter will be sticky, so just use a dash of flour to help if need be. I used about 2 tbsp. of the mixture and just dropped it on the baking sheet.  They cooked in exactly 12 minutes.  So good!!!!   Thanks!

So simple, SOOOO GOOOOOD! Made 4 batches in 3 days. Great as is. Added 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, 1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh chives and 1 teaspoon dried parsley to one batch. In another batch, I put a base amount on the baking sheet then added a spoonful of raspberry jam and covered it with another layer of biscuit dough and sealed the edges = Fresh Hot Scones. This recipe is too good. Thanks.

I've been making Mayonnaise Biscuits my whole life and absolutely love them.  The only thing I do differently is I drop the dough in muffin tins instead of on a baking sheet.

Just what I was looking for.  Quick & easy to make. Great with jam and butter.  
-------------------
Helpful hint: mix mayonnaise and flour(& baking powder and salt, if needed) together first.  I always use my hands and knead together until coarse/crumbly.  Then add milk (little by little) and with a large spoon fold liquid into mixture.  Leave lumpy - I know, I know, but it works best this way!!!  Will turn out better than the corner bakery :)

All done with mixing and baking in under 20 minutes (15, depending on oven, etc.) 
--------------
Funny story: first time I tried this, it was for a special added touch to our normal eggs and ham.  I always make a mini "tester" batch to share with my husband before I try anything new for us & the kids.  Well, these were so good and done so fast, by the time he got downstairs to share... well, they were all gone!  Luckily I had already had a few more mini ones going so he really never knew (Shhh...) Haha!  

Well, needless to say we made them for the kids too & our breakfast was WONDERFUL!  It's like biscuits made our usual that much more like a little cafe :)    Recipe makes perfect amount but is easy to half/double too. 

Anywho, hopefully this lets you know just how great and fast they really are :)
Super great recipe.  Will use again often & will pass along to friends and family.

These biscuits are great! I needed something besides the standard cornbread to serve with ribs and coleslaw and I came upon these. I followed the recipe exactly and they came out light and fluffy.  Don't be afaid of the mayo, you can't taste it!  These biscuits look like you spent a lot of time kneading and cutting dough - these take no time at all.  I can't wait to experiment with them by adding some herbs and cheddar or parmesan cheese!

Best biscutis I ever made! I used 3 Tbl light mayo and 3 Tbl canola oil, 1 cup of buttermilk. I think a biscuit has to have buttermilk in it ;) These were the most tender, moist biscuits ever! I cooked them in my lightly oiled cast iron skillet, 425 degrees for 13 min. then broiled the tops for a minute. This will be my "go to" biscuit recipe from now on ;)

These are the best tasting, fluffiest biscuits I have ever made.  Adding the mayonnaise sounded a little strange, but this recipe is a keeper!  The family loved them.  None left over either!

In my opinion, it should be better than 5 stars.  This recipe was DELICIOUS ~ I couldn't stop eating them!!!  I didn't have self-rising flour so instead I used: 2 cups of regular flour minus 2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt.  Excellent recipe - Thanks a lot.  I will definitely be making these again!!!!!

Wasn't too sure about these, but thought "What the hey". Made them and my dh and I ate them all with one dinner. These have re-placed my favorite drop biscuit recipe and will be all I make from now on. Can add cheese and garlic and what have you to change them a little. Thanks. Myrna

O.....M......Goodness! I have officially thrown out all of my other biscuit recipes! These came out so light and the taste was amazing! My kids LOVED them! I also used the substitution that other reviewers suggested because I didn't have self-rising flour and it worked perfectly! (2 C -4tsp flour, 3tsp Baking Powder, 1 tsp Salt) Thank you Georgie!!!

Since I can somehow manage to make even boxed mix biscuits look and taste like hockey pucks, I thought I'd give this recipe a whirl considering the short list of ingredients (and plenty of rave reviews).  Used skim milk and f/f mayo and was pleased they turned out so moist and light.  Now I am no longer biscuit-ly challenged.... Thanks!

I'm an old Southern gal and, back when I was a little girl, my Granny made these when she couldn't afford buttermilk. At times she wouldn't even use the milk! Just hot water and mayo! But she would still dump the dough out onto a floured counter, roll them out and cut them with an old jelly jar! Lay them side by side in a baking pan,  lightly spread a little mayo on top of them to help them brown. Of course, she could also make them with just hot water and self rising flour! Eat them with cane syrup for desert or breakfast!

Sad to say, these were not good.  I followed the recipe exactly, and the batter was the consistency  of pancake batter...not good for biscuits.  The texture was mealy and the flavor was thin.  My husband took one bite and no more.  very disappoint...is the recipe correct?

Crazy how easy these are! Used tip from someone else... Use 2 cups all purpose flour - 4 tsp, + 3 tsp baking powder, +1 tsp salt instead of self-rising flour. Also, add about 1/4 tsp thyme & rosemary for herbal touch.

Fantastic! I used low fat mayo, swapped out 1/2 cup of wholemeal self-rising flour and added a dollop of honey to the batter and it was awesome. Very versatile.

Wow, so delicious! The first time I made this, I didn't have self-rising flour, so I made my own by adding 3 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp salt to the 2 cups of flour.  My boyfriend loved it; he said they had a little saltiness that tasted really good with the biscuits, as compared to the second time I made a batch, when I used store-bought self-rising flour.  That second time, I couldn't taste any saltiness at all, it made the biscuits rather bland.  So, I definitely recommend making the self-rising flour by yourself for a little flavor!  Happy baking!

Love this Recipe! I have kept this recipe for over a year, since I always do  traditional biscuits with the shortening/butter .  I needed biscuits quick one morning, so I figured the best time to try this recipe!  I did add a salt though to taste, and some dill in the flour.   I did it as a rolled/cut biscuit, and it rose beautifully:)  I did this same recipe again one dinner adding sharp cheddar cheese & jalapeno's! It was Da BOMB Digigty! Going to try it with a chipotle mayo and spicy mayo to see those would taste!  All you need is some imagination to make it yummy!  Thanks for the easy recipe!

Quick, easy and delicious. Be sure to blend together the mayo and the milk before adding to the self-rising flour to avoid having to overmix the dough. That way, it comes together quickly. Drop nice, equal but generous amounts of dough! Very good. Thanks!

Very good!  I made them in muffin tins instead of dropping them onto a cookie sheet because the batter seemed kind of thin for that, and they turned out wonderful - big & fluffy :)

I make these regularly.  They are so easy and you can play with the recipe.  I usually add 2 tsp of thyme and about 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar.  Delicious!

These were light but didn't raise very much.  Could have been because my flour wasn't real fresh but they were good.

These are awesome!! I've never ever had a drop biscuit recipe turn out so light and flakey their always hard or flat. I took the tip from redneck girl on here and cooked them in muffin tins, I think that really makes a huge difference with them rising up compared to just dropping them on a cookie sheet. I have no idea what the other reviewers were saying the biscuit tasted like flour, Tasting the biscuit plain even licking some of the dough off the spoon was the best tasting dough/biscuit i've had! I'm guessing they've never made biscuit dough before and kept adding flower till the dough was non sticky and they kneaded it which made it hard. you wanna BARELY mix the ingredients together then spoon the mix into muffin tins, that's the key to the soft flakey biscuit! Also people don't have self rising flour, and try adding baking soda and stuff and it still doesn't work. Just go buy the self rising flour, it's 2.99 for a huge bag, and it worked PERFECT! And trust me you'll use it alot after  you tastes these biscuits. I made these with biscuits and gravy. YUM! I'll make this for a side too with dinner the biscuit was great, I'll try the other suggestions and add cheese and butter and other ideas, I'm gonna make this alot! WOW what a wonderful tasty biscuit!!!

These were great!  I needed something that was quick to make and chose this recipe.  I remembered making a similar recipe, so I knew this would be good.  It produces a light, delicate little muffin that is great warm from the oven with a slathering of butter.  Who knew mayonnaise would make biscuits taste so good?

5 stars for ease and tastiness. I made these twice, the first time i used half whole wheat flour but didn't add enough baking powder ( i think a good amount is 4 tsp of baking powder for 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup all purpose. Not if you're using all white.. Whole wheat just takes more i guess to rise.) .. so they were somewhat dense ( only used 3 tsp baking powder )... still good with gravy but could be a ton better.  So the second time around I used 4 tsp baking powder with around 3/4 tsp of salt, and i let the cup of  2% milk sit with 1 tbsp of lemon juice ( I wanted to try buttermilk, this combo is a good substitute ) for 5 minutes... and then I used 5 tbsp mayo, 1 tbsp butter... then mixed and put em in the oven for about 15-20 minutes ( Probably varies depending on your oven. Til they were lightly golden brown on the top ) and they turned out perfect and fluffy. They went great with a white gravy recipe I had on hand.. so good. Thanks for the recipe! I'll be sure to make these again.

A family fave!  Perfect! *Try dropping them on top of chicken or beef & vegetables with gravy and bake for a casserole.  Perfect consistency for this.  mmm creamed chicken and veggies with biscuits!

I made these to go with our Father's Day breakfast. They were super easy and very tasty! I didn't have self-rising flour, so I made my own. Just mix 7/8 cup of regular flour and 1 tsp of baking powder per cup needed for the recipe. They were even better warmed up and topped with butter and honey the next morning! Thanks!

This reciepe makes a great quick pizza crust too.  I add in some Italian seasonings, garlic powder and flatten out the dough onto a cookie sheet.  It is delicious.

I used the self-rising flour as called for and per other reviewers' suggestions, added 1 tsp. of sugar. Once they were taken from the oven, I brushed melted butter on the tops of them. All in all, the biscuits were quite dense and lacked every bit of flavor. While this may sound like a complaint, I think it could be taken either way. If you're eating one along with a meal, I think it works great because you never want a piece of bread to be more appealing than the main course; this biscuit recipe gives you that basic dinner bread without taking away from the dinner itself. Along with being a nice compliment to a dinner, they're also great served with jam (I'm a strawberry fan). So don't let the fact that this recipe lacks "pizazz" keep you from trying it. This has definitely got to be the most time and money  saving recipe out there. Give it a go... just keep some jam on hand! =)

I've made these since I was young, the recipe is exactly the same, and if you dont have self-rising flour, then just add 1 teaspoon of salt and 2 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder...you dont need to take anything out. The mayo takes the place of the shortening and eggs and such, I think. It also adds flavor. It wouldnt taste right with 'salad dressing', only mayo, imo. It is supposed to turn out like a drop biscuit.

I started making biscuits this way about 10 years ago.  My SIL worked in a country restaurant that had great biscuits and when I asked her what they used, she gave me recipe--basically the same as this one.  They dribbled a bit of bacon grease in the batter as well.  I've done it, but am not really sure you can taste it...  Just adds fat, so I stopped doing it.  They are great biscuits!

Extremely simple to make, I wanted a bit more flavour so I added in some grated cheddar cheese, and garlic powder.  I used an ice cream scoop to "drop" them on the baking sheets.  Once baked I brushed the tops w/ a parsley & garlic butter

It doesn't get any easier than this, folks! I've never been so impressed with a biscuit recipe. It has it all, ease, frugalness, quickness, and the yummy factor. I've made them several times, and they just get better each time. I have used them as a dinner roll, with sausage gravy for breakfast, and with homemade jam, it compliments any meal!

I have never made biscuits before, so I didn't really know what to expect.  That being said, this was probably the easiest thing I've ever made.  They were delicious fresh out of the oven, and they only required ingredients that you would already have on hand.  I guess that's probably true with all biscuits.  Anyway, I like how fluffy they were.  I'll make these again.

I LOVED THIS RECIPE! I was a little bit worried about the fact that it has mayo in it, but looked at the other reviews and took their suggestions, and decided to try it. I don't have self-rise flour, and someone suggested to add 3 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp salt, so I did. And someone else mentioned how these are impossible to roll out and to put them in a muffin tray, so I did. Just besure to lightly butter the edges of the muffin tin, and what I did I brushed the tops with milk to just help lightly brown them. They turned out amazing! Will use again! I cooked mine for about 15mins...just a little longer to make sure they cooked thoroughly. Very light and fluffy...would not even try to make them on a cookie sheet...they will not roll out (too sticky). Hope that helps!

When I saw this recipe, I thought it had to be too good to be true. But they really are that good and that easy! I didn't have self-rising flour so I added 1 Tbs. baking powder and 1/2 tsp. salt to the flour. They are really yummy with butter and honey.

Thank You George!

I was out of shortening and had already begun the process of making plum dumplings.  The plums were simmering and I couldn't make my usual drop biscuit recipe which is what I usually use for dumplings.

Your recipe lent itself to healthier substitutions.  I made my own self-rising flour with 1 and 1/2 cups whole wheat pastry flour, 1/2 cup unbleached white flour, 1 TBSP baking powder and 3/4 tsp salt.  I also added 2 TBSP of sugar to the recipe due to using it for a dessert dish.

The dumplings turned out beautifully! I will be using this recipe for my dumplings from now on, it was so easy!

A classic mayonnaise biscuit with a great texture. I've also made these with regular flour -- just add three teaspoons of baking powder and about a teaspoon of salt to the flour before mixing with the other ingredients.

I tried this recipe while snowed in and unable to get to the store. I did not have my usually ingredients for biscuits, so I went searching for a new recipe. I had tried the bisquik in the cupboard, only to make some hockey puck biscuits - the bisquik had expired 9 months previously. 

When I found this recipe - simple as it was - the only ingredient I had was mayonnaise. I used dry milk and all-purpose flour and baking powder. I used less liquid and rolled the biscuits instead of dropping them. Since I had had the earlier bad bisquik experience, I baked a couple before dinner. They were absolutely fabulous biscuits! I couldn't believe that mayonnaise could possible make good biscuits. A few hours later, I baked the rest of them. They still tasted good, but the texture was not as good. Moral of the story? Cook them quickly. For whatever reason, they do not "sit" well. 

I would also recommend making sure you use Mayonnaise and not salad dressing or Miracle Whip.

I should probably give these 5 stars for how very easy they are, but they were VERY good.  Fluffy and light.  5 stars for me is "best ever."  I'll probably add a dash of sugar next time just to enhance flavor a bit, but not enough to make them sweet.  I thought they might need a dash of salt and I'm very glad I didn't add that- didn't need it.  I used Martha White self rising flour and it had plenty of salt.  For those who said that their biscuits didn't rise, check the expiration date on your flour.  If they were too tough, you might have overmixed the dough.  To keep the biscuits tender, mix the milk and mayo well first, then add the flour so you can minimize the mixing after the flour is added.  The batter will be somewhat lumpy.  I doubled the recipe and also dropped the dough into greased muffin tins to keep the biscuits more shaped.  Let the dough rest for about 15 mins once it was in the tins, and that allowed the biscuits to rise even more.  Yum!  I'll try some of the variations (cheddar jalapeno, rosemary/thyme etc) next time!

I'm vegan, so I made them with almond milk and Vegenaise.  I was afraid they wouldn't turn out, but they were light, fluffy and delicious.

My family enjoyed these very much. I liked how easy they were to throw together-- and I love using only three ingredients!! Next time I may add some chives or cheddar cheese.

Oh, yum...My mother passed away a few years ago and her biscuits were sooo good. These are so similar in taste that I thought of her the first bite I took. My daughter and her husband loved them too. So easy to make and they were all gone that one meal. I am making them tonight and making them in my mothers "biscuit pan" that I have kept but never used it for biscuits since I always had disasterous results when I tried. So I used her pan for cornbread. Sorry cornbread you will never grace my mothers biscuit pan again. Thanks so much for the recipe. I gave it to my son because they are so easy and he loves homemade biscuits!

The texture was perfectly flaky and moist.  They didn't taste like mayonnaise, but the mayo perfumed the air as they were baking, which was a turn off.

I didnt have self-rising flour on hand, so I used the suggestion of another and made it by adding baking powder and salt.  These biscuits would have been great, but they were too salty.  I give them 2 stars for ease of assembly, and one more star for fluffiness.  Next time I will use only about 1/4 tsp of salt.

I first thought this recipe was way too easy to be good, but I found it is way too good to be overlooked. I made them on my lunch break yesterday in a muffin tin and was surprised by how great they were. Today I dropped them on a cookie sheet and made them larger and they were incredible.  They fluffed up perfectly and looked better than the biscuits you would find at a number of local fast food places.  I took some back to the office and people marveled at the possibility of making delicious homemade biscuits in under an hour.

These are very good. Very light and fluffy. If the batter is runny or they don't rise, the batter has been mixed too much! I used a rubber spatula and gently folded ingredients till just combined.

These were delicious and super easy.  I didn't have any self rising flour, so I added a tablespoon of baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon of salt to my two cups of all purpose flour.  I also added 1 tsp. of sugar and used reduced fat mayo.  My husband, who ate his plain, said they needed more salt.  I had jam on mine, so I thought they were fine.

Fab recipe!  I used regular flour (ad 2 1/2 t baking powder and 1/2 t salt).  I also added ( on a lark) 1/2 black pepper, 1/2 t. onion powder, 1 t dried parsley and 1/2 C grated parm/romano blend.  Nice and light, very fluffy -- My guys loved them!

These biscuits are good.  Instead of spooning out the dough onto the pan I dropped the dough onto a floured board and rolled out, then cut out for nice round biscuits.

After reading some of the reviews that said the dough was too wet I used a little less milk than called for, also I didn't have self rising flour so I converted by adding 2-1/2 teasp of baking powder & 1/2 tsp salt to AP flour. Otherwise I made this recipe exactly as written. The dough was still too wet so I had to add flour to get it to drop biscuit consistency. It made a nice, light, fluffy biscuit with very little flavor. I'll try it again but next time I think I'll try using 3/4 C buttermilk or 1/2 sour cream & 1/2 milk in place of the plain milk & cut the liquid to 3/4 C.

I had never heard of using mayonnaise as an ingredient in bisquits, but oh my how good! I was looking for a quick and easy bisquit recipe on a time crunch and hit the jackpot with this.  Thinking about it after, it makes sense -- mayonnaise is just eggs and oil. This went straight into my recipe box.

I did not have self rising flour, so I followed the advise of lovestocook and put 2 cups all purpose flour in a bowl, then took out 4 tsp. and then added 3 tsp. baking powder and 1 tsp salt.  

I heated my over to 395 F as it runs a little warm and used a cupcake scoop to make 9 biscuts and cooked them for 15 minutes rather than the 12 minutes called for.

So flakey that they are hard to put butter and jelly on.
Very light and flakey.

My only change was using the new mayo with olive oil and cracked black pepper (what I had on hand). Amazing taste, gave them an extra zing.

This recipe was a big disappointment for me.  They tasted like flour and salt and had a really odd texture.  Very disappointing after so many good reviews.

Easy, quick, and tasty biscuit!  We added 1 tsp salt for flavor and next time I might try adding a little garlic powder and shredded cheese for something a little different!

Wow, I can't believe how delicious these came out for such an effortless labor biscuit!! I've been wanting to try this recipe for years, but was a little skeptical because of the ingredient "mayonnaise?"in a biscuit??  The two I just never thought would pair up, but they do and wonderfully.  They went perfect with my sausage gravy, mmmm.  Also never thought that I would be eating mayonnaise and grape jelly at the same time, but I have!! And will be quite often!!!  This recipe is a keeper, try it for yourself.

Wonderful in so many ways!

 I grew up with biscuits as a staple on the table.  However the family I married into did not.  So I am always trying to find the right balance between a biscuit and a yeast roll.  This recipe does just that.  

I make my own self-rising flour (2 cups of flour, 1 tablespoon of baking powder and 1 teaspoon of salt) sift it well and then add the mayo all at once - mixing it in with a fork until crumb like (as you would do for pastry) then add just enough milk to hold it together, pat it out and cut into wedges.  This yields a very fluffy bit of bread that goes down very well with both families.  WHATS NOT TO LOVE ABOUT THAT?

I used baking mix because I didn't have self-rising flour.  Four stars for the simple & quick preparation.  Not nearly as good as a biscuit that would take more effort but hits the spot if you're in a pinch.  My batter was thinner than I think it should have been - I halved the recipe because it's only me & my husband so maybe something was off on that... though baked texture was good they just spread a bit & were thinner than you'd think a biscuit would be.

I wasn't too sure about this... but I was on the potluck list for biscuits and gravy and didn't want to go the frozen or Bisquick route. Whipped up a quadruple batch (had a lot of mouths to feed) using all purpose flour (added baking powder and salt for leavening) and OMG!  I'll never make boxed biscuits again!  Super easy and TASTY - Got a lot of requests for the recipe!!  Thank you for sharing!!

Made as is, these are terrible...there is NO flavor what-so-ever.  2 stars for the time it takes to throw together.  I pulled them out after 12 minutes and ended up sprinkling some garlic powder & shredded cheese on top each biscuit and then baking for an additional 5 minutes.  There are so many better drop biscuit recipes on this site, I will not attempt this one again.  Sorry :(

I've been looking for a good/easy biscuit recipe after having some bad luck with other recipes on this site and I finally found it!! Also I remember my Dad making mayonnaise biscuits as a kid in WV, so I wanted a recipe for them. I used self-rising flour,substituted buttermilk for the milk and lightly greased 12 muffin cups(as some others suggested). I had to cook them a bit longer to get them browned. The tops didn't brown to much, but i forgot to brush them with more buttermilk before baking. These biscuits turned out maybe not "picture perfect", but they rose nicely, the inside was nice and fluffy. I tried one right after I pulled then out and thought they tasted a little floury and bland, but not that bad cause I could still taste the buttermilk, after they cooled a little, I tried another and it was fabulous!! Even more so with butter! I ended up going back and eating 6 of them. I will be keeping this recipe and making them more often.Thanks for a simple and easy recipe that has only a few ingredients that I always have on hand.

These were nice for a quick and easy biscuit. I went ahead and used other reviewer tips for making my own self-rising flour since I had none on hand by removing 4 tsp of flour for the 2 cups of flour and using 3 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp salt - though they were a bit salty for my taste. Next time I'll cut the salt a little bit. These are not a dense biscuit but they are easy and accompany a meal well.

Great recipe.  I made them as written first and they were good.  Then I tried them using whole wheat flour.  I added 4 tsp of baking powder and 1/2 tsp of salt to each cup of flour.  They were still nice and light.  Thanks for the idea.

What a wonderful recipe! So easy and quick to make. I made these this morning but I didn't have self-rising flour, so I used the substitute suggested by Evelyn in KC (2 cups less 4 tsp sifted flour, 3 tsp baking powder, and 1 tsp salt), and it worked like a charm. The only thing I would probably recommend is using a scant teaspoon of salt, otherwise, these are very tasty little biscuits. UPDATE: For a milder taste, try substituting sour cream for the mayo. Also works well.

GREAT!!!  I just found out my daughter has a milk allergy and wanted a recipe with out butter or shortening.  I used soy milk and these came out great.  My husband said he couldn't even tell the difference.  I used bread flour with 2 tsp baking soda and 1 1/2 tsp salt.  Then added soy milk until just workable.  Rolled out and baked at 375 F baked on Pampered Chef stone for 15 min.  Lightly browned and wonderful!

Very tasty, quick & simple. Just the way I like my recipes. I'm not a big fan of self-rising flour (it seems too salty) but I like throwing together breakfast for a big family quickly. I used homemade peach preserves & they are great! Thanks!

These are the best biscuits I have ever made. I normally produce hockey pucks, but these were light and very tasty. I did add the prescribed sugar, 1 tbl baking soda and 1 tsp salt. They did not get as brown as I would have liked nor as bake as high as I like (never made but have eaten ) I am anxious try try these again and I may add buttermilk and increase the baking powder a snall amount.

My boyfriend and I were looking for a biscuit recipe without a lot of butter or lard since we are trying to eat healthy. We used reduced fat mayonnaise (only 40 calories) and 2% milk for this recipe and it turned out perfect. So delicious and very low fat and low calorie. We will definetly make these again.

I found this recipe because I was out of shortening.  These were great for biscuits and gravy this morning. I dont think I would serve them as dinner biscuits, because they were a bit crumbly and it would be difficult to spread butter or jam on them, but the flavor and texture  was great.  Thanks@!

Super easy, super fast and super-available ingredients! These are great, quick drop biscuits.  They were light, fluffy and superfast to make.  I have also substituted buttermilk for the milk and it turned out super moist and slightly tangy.  No need for salt, since there's salt in the mayo.  These don't have a dense, old fashioned bisuit texture, but if you need bread with dinner, this is perfect and much tastier than Bisquick.  Have also brushed the top with melted buter before baking for nice color/flavor.  And DO NOT overmix.  If it looks like 4-5 strokes away from being done, then it IS done.  I usually mix it 5-7 strokes total, no more, or else you'll get a heavy, flat biscuit.  Try this- great to make with kids too!

These were very easy and quick. I was short on time, so tried this recipe. They turned out fine, served with honey and jam. The kids loved them. I found them to be light and airy. I mixed them until just combined. Do not over beat.

These were so moist, so easy, and so delicious!  They don't taste so great with honey and they don't have the best presentation, but yummy nonetheless.  At first I thought I had measured something incorrectly because the dough wasn't as stiff as I was expecting but it turned out great once out of the oven.  I used lite mayonaise and I wish I had baked them for maybe 15 minutes instead of 12 minutes.  Next time I'll try the butter/garlic mixture from "Cheddar Bay Biscuits."

wow!  simple recipe with good results.  great when you're in a jam or just want something easy, but freshly baked.  they did come out a bit sharp and edgy the first time, so i followed the suggestion of patting the tops down a bit.  when time allows and to make it feel more like baking, i add a bit of butter, sugar,salt and baking powder (to make it fluffier).  i'm serving it with the creamy veg chowder (also on all recipes) tonight and will try adding some flavour to it (the biscuits) - maybe basil, dill or cheese...

My family loves these biscuits!  And they are awesomely easy to mix up and drop.  I have found that if I pat the tops down (with floured hands) after dropping them, they look much nicer.  No little spikes on top!

I came home late tonight to a starving family. I pulled out some soup and whipped up these biscuits. In 15 minutes, dinner was on the table. Maybe there are some biscuit recipes that taste a very little bit better, but when you factor in ease of preparation, these biscuits are the best I've come across.

I usually use the J.P. Big Daddy Biscuits from this site.  I tried this recipe beccause I am always looking for something new.  The taste was very good with melted butter on top; better than that of J.P's .  That said I have to say I like the heighth that I get from J.P's biscuits better than these.  I would really like to be able to blend the two recipes somehow.

very good. light and fluffy. The batter was nice and thick like a biscuit batter should be. Much better than the southern mayonnaise biscuits also found on this site.  Very plain tasting.  I like it just the way it is, but next time I might use the new, lowfat, flavored,  mayo's out there eg. tomato bacon flavor.  Will make again, so quick and easy.

Great recipe.I've made these several times and they always turn out great. Didn't have mayo in the fridge one day and used melted butter instead. Same great taste, the hubby didn't even notice a difference, and they are his favorite.

I thought these were great.  I used garlic salt and added onion powder.  I drizzled a little butter over the top and let then rest about 10 minutes before I baked them.  They came out fluffy and delicious.  Forget that rolling and cutting nonsense,!  I did use muffin tins to give them a shape.

These were really good, to me, but my partner, who's not a fan of mayo, claimed he could taste it.  Possibly, but I've often found that when he doesn't know about the mayo, he likes things better :)!  (He caught me, that time!) I really liked them, and they were easy.  I made them a bit too small, I think; they didn't spread out much from the size of the mouth of the glass I usually use to cut biscuits.  I'll make them bigger next time.  One trick I use for biscuits that worked well with these is to roll out two layers, each half the depth specified, and place them one on top of the other before cutting the dough.  The finished biscuits break apart easily to fill them.  That worked well with this recipe.

These turned out great! Best biscuits I've made. I used 2 cups all purpose flour, then added 3 tsp baking powder n 1 tsp salt. Delicious! Next time I want to try adding some shredded cheese to the mix :) these reminded me of the biscuits from red lobster. My new favorite.

This is now my go to recipe for biscuits! I have shared with everyone I know! They are quick, easy, and tasty! I sometimes add a pinch of sugar. You do not taste the mayo and it taste like you spend a while lot longer making "made from scratch" biscuits than you actually did. I highly recommend trying.

I was looking for a quick biscuit recipe to go along side chili and came across this one. The mayonnaise seemed a bit odd to me but I thought I would give it a try. Boy am I glad I did! These were so easy and absolutely delicious!  Other reviewers have said they had no self rising flour, I found myself in the same predicament..so I reduced the flour by 4 teaspoons and added 1 teaspoon of salt and 3 teaspoons of baking powder. I also added about a cup of shredded cheddar cheese. they came out fluffy and delicious...so easy and so good! I will definitely be making these again, and often!

You don't expect something this easy to be this good.  I've had self-rising flour on hand from a previous recipe and this gives me a chance to use it up. I made these exactly as written and they were wonderful.

Super fast and easy, which is a huge bonus to me. I used the sub flour and was very careful to not overmix it. Texture and fluffiness was right on. Flavor lacked a little, probably could've used some salt or a little butter or something else? Will make again.

I have made this recipe once and about to make it again right now for breakfast. I see many comments about how good it is and how the biscuits turned out so nice. I even read the comment from flowersandcandy4me, and I can't understand how one person out of so many didn't like it. I used this recipe and it works fine. If I did anything different, I cut back on the milk to 3/4 cup instead of 1 cup, that will keep dough at a thicker consistency to use as drop biscuits. I did sprinkle some rosemary on top before placing them in oven. A little tweaking to your own likes will take this simple recipe and enhance it to everyone's liking.

I can get 12 medium sized biscuits out of this recipe. And they're all gone within 5 minutes of coming out of the oven. Super easy but so good!  Butter and strawberry preserves are my fave with these but my family loves them with butter and honey, yummy! Light, fluffy and moist.

For not being a mayonnaise fan I was hesitant about making these but they were very good. Light and crusty and no mayo taste. Will be making them again.

This was a quick and easy recipe. The biscuits rolled out easily, rose well and tasted great. I will definitely use this one again.

I have one word for you: "AWESOME"! I didn't have self rising flour so I followed other user suggestions of taking out 4 tsp of flour from the 2 cups and adding 4 tsp of baking powder and 1 tsp of salt and sifted it all together. I also added some grated Parmesan cheese (what I had on hand)and sprinkle of garlic powder. Once all my dry were combined I threw in the mayo and about a tablespoon of bacon lard I had left over from breakfast. Mixed it dry until crumbly and then slowly mixed in milk. Baked for about 13 mins... INSANELY GOOD!! Thanks for this fabulous recipe!

These were just ok.  The texture was good, but they were just a little bland.  They were better with lots of butter and jelly.

Decided to try these to go with sausage gravy for Sunday morning breakfast...cut dough into square biscuits and they baked up like perfect little pillows.  Lucky we got any by the time the two teens were done hovering over the pan!  A keeper for sure.

I feel that I should start this review off with the fact that I don't like mayonnaise. I really wanted to like this recipe, but all I could taste was mayo. I loved the consistency, they were really light and fluffy (probably because I used a muffin tin), but I coudn't get past the aftertaste.

Nice, but rather like the ones on the Bisquick box.  Will keep in the recipe file though.  Using for biscuits and gravy in the morning so should be lovely.

Just tried these and honestly they came out much more compact than I would have liked. They are very heavy. The mix is gluey, and I would suggest some serious stirring to make them airier than they are. I'll try the recipe again in a couple of days and see if that makes all the difference. They taste fine otherwise, just really thick.

LOVE the simplicity. Quick biscuit fix that doesn't taste bad. I recommend Kraft over Duke (Mayonnaise).  Easily varied with cinnamon, raisins, cranberries, etc.  Thanks for sharing!

We really enjoyed these biscuits.  The method of mixing and dropping went quickly and we had fresh, hot biscuits in less than 20 minutes.  I prefer a rolled, buttermilk biscuit, (Chef John has a GREAT recipe) but these are very good when you are in a hurry.

These were amazing.  The batter is super sticky a it is, like very think pancake dough.  But just go with it and drop them onto parchment paper and they fluff up and are amazing.  Don't change a thing!!

This is a great quick recipe.  I added garlic powder and onion powder for additional flavor.  Needed just a small amount of extra milk.  Thanks for sharing.  Will definitely make these again.

To be honest, as an ardent hater of mayonnaise, I thought these were going to be horrible when I made. But they turned out delicious! You can't taste the mayo at all. So easy and delicious.

I am a challenged baker, I never have the right ingredients since I don't do much baking. I used AP Flour, milk, and mayo and a sprinkle of kosher salt, no baking powder because I don't have any. My biscuits were boring(but thats because of the flour, I am going to get some self rising and try again), but it made delicious little donut holes. Moist and delicious! I just dropped small amounts in to low-medium high hot oil and fried for about 30 seconds each side. They were loved by all!!

Delicious!  I'm a "Miracle Whip" girl myself, so I used that instead of actual mayo.  They were perfect this way.  I don't have self-rising flour, so used the flour, salt, and baking powder that others have mentioned.  They even got the seal of approval from little miss picky pants.

*Let me preface my review by saying that I cut back a bit on calories by using light mayo and 1% milk, so I wasn't sure what the end result would be.*  They were very easy to toss together and in spite of my slight adjustments, were still delicious and fluffy.  The texture was different than most biscuits, more like a cross between a dinner roll and a biscuit.  I will definitely make these again.

I stuck to the ingredients listed with the exception of needing to use the standard substitute for 'self-rising' flour -- b.powder, flour, salt -- and I added just a bit of honey.  But even with that, these were terribly bland and blah tasting.  Just a 'normal' run of the mill biscuit has some sort of flavor... these just did not.  You had to have some sort of flavored butter or jam on them to make them edible.  Even my non-picky husband needed more than plain butter.  Disappointing.

So good! So easy. I did add 1 tsp. baking powder, used buttermilk, and baked at 435. I also heated 1 TBSP butter and a couple of swirls of corn oil in pan the second time before I added the dough. Made a crispy crust, which hub and I preferred.

Maybe I did something wrong but it was a little too moist for a "biscuit" and didnt rise as much either. It did taste rich though. I guess personal preference after all

On the upside, these were quick and easy.  On the downside, the taste and texture weren't great.  They tasted like they were made from a Bisquick mix to me.  Thank you for the novel recipe!

This is mor like 3.5 stars.  They were not bad.. not specatular, but not bad either.  It seems they were just missing something.. not sure what.. but they were a little on the bland side.  Next time maybe i'll mix some grated cheese in them.  It just missed something but i'm not sure what it was missing.. overall not bad..

I have never been able to make great biscuits no matter what recipe I use..this one was different!  I can finally cook a biscuit LOL!  I followed recommendation from a famiy member to use a muffin tin (as another reviewer had suggested).  I was so happy with this recipe that I "shared" it on my facebook account!!  Good Stuff!

Thank you for this recipe!  I'm no baker.  Never will be.  But figured I couldn't screw this one up.  I did exactly as you said and was thrilled with the outcome!!  So simple but they taste and look like you slaved.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks!

No, you cannot just substitue all-purpose flour.  It does not contain the levening agent that self-rising flour does (hence its name).  You will need to use 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1-1/2 teaspoons baking powder and 1/4 teaspoon salt for each cup of self-rising flour called for in the recipe.

This was so easy to put together in a hurry. It's better to have made form scratch over canned or box mix biscuits any day. Indeed these were moist and tender inside and they held together without crumbling when splitting. The sure didn't have much flavor though. No, you can't taste the mayonnaise and I was skeptical. I baked mine for almost 15 minutes and they still were really pale in color although they were brown on the bottoms and looked done at 12 minutes. These were okay and better than processed food, but not my favorite.

This recipe is sooo easy so it's great if you're looking for a quick dinner add on. Def more of a roll consistency than a biscuit. I didn't have 3TBS of mayo so I had to sub 1 TBS butter but my husband and I enjoyed them. It certainly isn't the best roll I have ever had but for the amount of ingredients and little time it takes, I will be making these again.

An excellent and easy last minute biscuit.  It's more like a roll than most biscuits I've known.  I added 1/2 cup fresh grated parmesan and some parsley and served it with spaghetti.  There were no leftovers!  My family loved them.

I grew up eating these almost every Sunday after church.  My mom always used Dukes mayo, and now so do I.  Since I don't live in the south, she ships Dukes to me!  Great, easy recipe.

I made these because I was out of a lot of ingredients but still wanted something to go with dinner...WOW. These are rich and moist and unlike any other kind of biscuit I've ever had. Certainly more of a roll...my family is calling is a "Riscuit" (Risk It) and it was certainly worth the risk of trying! I'll be making these at least once a week from now on...

Too salty for me, next time I'll cut back on the salt, but these are tasty for sure. I used light Miracle Whip and added some garlic because I wanted garlic biscuits with dinner (but was out of both butter AND shortening!). This recipe sure was a lifesaver :-) Thanks!

Wow, that was easy.  Its the middle of the night and I wanted biscuits to have with my brisket & gravy that I had made earlier and put away.  Wanted an easy recipe, and this could not be easier...I had to take the gravy out and dip one of the biscuits.  Will definitely make this again.  (I used fat free mayonnaise)

These are the easiest and most versatile biscuits I've ever made. The ingredients are usually in everyone's pantry and it only takes a few minutes to make them. I make them with light mayo and always top them with spices or herbs before I pop them into the oven. I've tried sprinkling black pepper, red chili flakes, thyme, and even mozzarella on them. They always turn out fluffy and delicious. It's the only biscuits I make!

I had tried a few of the top rated biscuit recipes on this site and was not satisfied with the results. This recipe is the BEST! While some say the end result comes out more like a roll, mine had the taste and texture of a light and fluffy biscuit. Not to mention they are super easy to make. Thanks for posting!

Easy and awesome! I've made full batches I've made this recipe for years and 100's of times, but just now getting around to rating it. I've made full batches as called for by the recipe and also cut the recipe in half. But I always make either 4 instead or 6 (half recipe) or 8 instead of 12 (full recipe) when make into larger biscuits. I cook for 12 mins and they come out perfect every time. They are large and soooo fluffy. Everyone always raves whenever I make these biscuits, and you can't screw them up unless you burn them.

Easy, quick and good.  I halved the recipe bc it's just the two of us, and bf had three of them.  I'm not a mayo fan but you really can't taste it.  I baked longer than stated, actually baked about 18-20 minutes to get them golden brown.  I think bc of the mayo they crisped up on the bottom too.  Thanks for the recipe!  Easy to whip up on a weeknight!

Amazingly good for the amount of effort required!  While they don't replace the real thing, they are an excellent substitute when you want/need something quick.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Thank you for a biscuit recipe that uses ingredients I already have on hand. The end result was really good biscuits. I did not tweak at all made as is.

i'm rating this a three.five-four only because it requires so little ingredients.  the taste, however, was left to be desired.  it got worse when they cooled - it was like eating thick flour and water batter.  i made four dozens; i'm not sure how i made so much and i didn't even double the recipe.  i'd probably make this again only to rule out that i didn't make a mistake.  ONLY SERVE WARM.

These are bland.  Fresh out of the oven, they just tasted like flour.  After storing them in a ziplock bag overnight, they now taste like plastic.  They're so bland that they absorbed the flavor of the bag!  I will say, however, that the texture was nice.  Because of the ease of preparation, I would make these again if I were serving them with a flavorful gravy or something.  But they're not worth eating alone.

Light fluffy and very easy. You do not taste the mayo @ all. My husband and I both loved them. It may have been my oven but it took about 18 minutes. Just fyi.

Quick and easy.  Made for Strawberry Shortcake.  Very good! Did what others recommended for self-rising flour.  Added 1TBSP baking powder and 1 tsp salt. Threw in a dash of sugar as well!

these are hands down the best biscuits we have ever made.  I used Hellman's light mayo, 2% milk, and a pinch of sugar.  So easy, and so, so good.

These were easy, tasty, and quick!  I scaled the recipe to make 18 servings and I dropped half of the dough onto my chicken and bicuit casserole and dropped the other half into an 8x8 pan that had about 1/4 (probably more!) inch of maple syrup in the bottom and baked it for dessert.  Both ways the biscuits were yummy and enjoyed by the whole family.  I used Miracle Whip because that is what I had and the results were still great!

Very yummy!  I did like the last person did, as I didn't have self rising flour either, added 1 Tbsp baking powder, 1 tsp salt, and I added 1 1/2 tsp sugar.  These are so good with strawberry jam spread all over....mmmm, now I want more!!!

This is a GREAT recipe! I always think twice about the hassle of making biscuits. This was SO easy, who would have thought about mayo in the biscuits?? Turned out great. I had mine with honey and my honey had his with gravy, both DELISH!!! I did add baking powder and salt and two teaspoons of white sugar.

Prior to this recipe, I had only been successful at making hockey pucks! The only change I made was to use buttermilk instead of regular milk. All I can say is WOW! Even my southern mother in law (who makes perfect biscuits) thought these were excellent. Thanks for sharing. This is DEFINITELY a keeper!

I didn't have self-rising flour, so I took the advice of others and added baking powder and salt.  The biscuits were a little dense, but next time I will try not using fat-free mayo and will use self-rising flour.  The density was perfect, however, for our homemade hamburgers.  I'm happy about how healthy these biscuits are compared to other recipes using biscuit mix, eggs, etc.  Definitely worth making again!

After trying numerous buscuit recipes, I finally found one that my husband loves! Dough even feels lighter and fluffier when working with it. I made them with less milk as suggested for cut- out biscuits and they were wonderful!

Not bad! I didn't have the self-rising flour, so I used 2 cups flour less about 2 TBS, and I added maybe ½ tsp salt and 2 tsp baking powder. I didn't want drop biscuits so I kneaded the dough a couple times on a floured board and then rolled it to about 3/4" thick. I used a 2" round cutter and placed the biscuits on a parchment-lined sheet. I cut the heat down to 375 as they were browning too fast on the bottom.. They were pretty good! The leftovers DID get really hard really fast, so they got chucked, but this is a great recipe in a pinch. Thanks, Georgie!

These were actually....good!  I was skeptical, but figured I would try since it was such a short and easy process.  I used all-purpose flour and as a result, threw in 1.5t of baking powder and .5t of salt (I halved the recipe).  These paired well with my Hungarian Mushroom Soup (also from AR) and you really couldn't taste the mayo!  Thanks for the recipe.

EASY!!  I used whole milk the first time, cut the recipe in 1/2 and used non fat milk this time.  Both times they turned out great.  Perfect for my husband and I.  I don't think I'll ever buy refrigerated biscuits again, these are toooo simple and all the ingredients are sitting in the cupboard!

These are delicious and TOO EASY!  Have soup simmering on the stove and trying to decide what to serve with it.  I've eaten two already and my family isn't even home for dinner!   Think I'll make another batch to be on the safe side.  Thanks for this terrific recipe.  It'll be a tradition around here, I'm sure.

These get a 5 for ease..and taste too!  I was out of shortening and too lazy to go to the store, found this recipe.  So easy to make, I only would have like them more if they became more of a golden brown, but nonetheless, they were tasty.  I ate two before I presented them to my husband!  Will make again --great for breakfast too.

I made these because I was out of shortening and did not have time to go to the store.  They were very good.  They probably will not replace my old recipe but this recipe is quick and good.  I did substitute buttermilk for the regular milk.

I was so dissapointed in these biscuits. Very bland. No flavor. I used Duke's mayonnaise and still no flavor. Did I miss something? I have had much better drop biscuits.

The biscuits came out light and fluffy.I didn't care much for the flavor. I used a no fat mayo dressing, hence little flavor. Actually, it had a bad after taste. My family enjoyed them completely. I will definetly try again but next time I will use real mayo. I might even add some seasonings: basil, onion bits, pepper... I think they would also be good topped with some parmasean or asiago cheese. These biscuits have potential!

I have made these twice since finding the recipe, the first time using mayo, the second time using Miracle Whip. They were equally very good, just a tad less flavor with the MW. Either way, no more being the butt of the biscuit-baking jokes! Thanks!

These were quite good, and easy!  Instead of dropping the biscuits, I shaped them in my hands with a little dusting flour.  Not as much work as rolling them out, but came out close to that.  Will definitely keep this recipe!

So fluffy!   I was hesitant to try this recipe but with so many great reviews I couldn't resist. Like others I used 2 cups flour - 3tsp, added 2 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt. I also added shredded cheddar and some freeze-dried garlic. The texture reminds me of the biscuits you get with gravy at McDonalds. Sooooooo yummy!

These biscuits were very good. There was a slight salty flavor though and no buttery taste. Other than that...awesome. They were my first batch of biscuits EVER and turned out perfectly!

These were super easy to make. The consistency was a little weird before baking them, but they turned out just fine. I also added a little salt to the mixture and when they were finished baking I brushed them with melted butter. I had sausage and eggs and gravy with them one night for dinner. My husband must have enjoyed them, he had 4 in one sitting.

Delicious! I am not blessed with biscuit making skills. So the fact that my husband and father loved these speaks volumes. They are soft and tasty and go with any meal. And since I tend to "pop open" my biscuts, these were just as easy to make.

I wanted to try this recipe, but only had skim milk and fat free mayo on hand.  I didn't think they would turn out without fat, but they were excellent.  Now I have an extremely simple fat free biscuit recipe!  This recipe is also an excellent base to which you could add any seasoning like cheese, garlic, etc.

Made it exactly as written and it was great! Will be my go-to biscuit recipe from now on because I don’t like canned biscuits nor do I have time to make traditional biscuits with the ‘frozen butter’ and kneeding all that these days.

This was my first attempt at making the biscuits. I usually don’t make substitutions when making a recipe the first time but I did not have self rising flour so I followed what other reviews said to do using all purpose flour, baking powder and salt. I rated this a 3 because it was too salty for me. I even used less than recommended.

I had never had biscuits with mayo and no buttermilk, but wow-oh-wow these were good! Very fluffy and moist inside, nice crust on the outside. I did cheat a little and added about 1/2 cheddar cheese and 2 Tbsp of parsley, but they didn't add that much flavor to what is already a really good biscuit! Family loved it!

With a family on a budget these biscuits saved the day.  These are the easiest biscuits and they come out perfect and soft everytime.  I spread butter on top when they come hot out of the oven. Yum!  I think they will be a great base recipe for cheddar bay biscuits too.  Will have to try that soon.  Thanks for the recipe.  I never buy store bought anymore!

I was wary of this recipe, I don't have much luck with biscuits.  I didn't have self rising flour so did as other reviewers suggested and also put vinegar in my milk to make it "buttermilk". Put them in a muffin tin and got RAVE reviews from my family.

I LOVE these biscuits! Made my first batch yesterday, and I am back at it today. I didn't have self rising flour so I used all purpose with the usual adjustments and also had only 1% milk so I used 1/2 a cup of it and 1/2 a cup of heavy cream.  They were perfectly done in the 12 minutes the recipe stated. I know these will be a part of any meal I make where I need biscuits.

I made a double batch, and they are the best biscuits that I have ever made. I don't recommend using these biscuits for breakfast sandwiches though, because they are very soft and crumble easily, however they are perfect for biscuits and gravy. I will definitely be using this recipe again and again and again...

I use this recipe as a base. These biscuits pair well with jam or with mixed in herbs and cheese. They aren't the rich standalone biscuits that you would eat without any toppings so I often pair them with meat or eggs.  If you like rolled biscuits opt for a more standard buttermilk recipe. The drop version never disappoints.

Great biscuit recipe! I found these took near double the time to cook however I used a stone pan so it could account for extra time.

These are good, and we all like them. They go great with stew. I added 3 tsp. of baking powder and 1 tsp. of salt as the one review recommended if you don't have self-rising flour. They are very easy to burn though, so be careful.

These biscuits were delicious! I never have success making biscuits but these were super easy and came out perfectly. Make sure to use real mayonnaise, not miracle whip. I cut the mayo into the flour then added the milk. I ended up rolling out the dough, folding a couple times and patted it out with my hands before cutting out the biscuits. Then, I baked in a cast iron skillet. Thanks for sharing this recipe. It will definitely be my go-to biscuit recipe from now on!

My SIL had bags and bags of self-rising flour in her cupboard so I wanted to used them up.  This was awesome.  The only thing is they are a bit salty for my taste.  But I gave 5 stars because it was absolutely quick and easy to make and my family gobbled them up.

There are many biscuit recipes, and I've tried several that I like.  So far, for taste, this one's the best.  I did add about 1/3 cup finely shredded cheddar cheese, and curdled my milk with a couple teaspoons of vinegar.  Used my hands, per one reviewer's suggestion, to lightly blend. Also brushed tops with melted butter and very light sprinkling of sesame seeds before baking. Baking time about right, turned out fluffy and delicious.  Made 6 large biscuits. Thanks for posting.

These were delicious and extremely easy to make! They were very light and fluffy. The texture was just perfect. I put a little bit of cold butter in my mixture. My only tip is to make sure to not OVERMIX. My husband and son absolutely loved these biscuits. I will be using this recipe again!

made 1/2 a batch (gave me 14 biscuits), using the self-rising flour conversion from other reviewers.  excellent.  light and fluffy.  not sure about a few reviews saying it was  runny  similar to pancake batter.  mine certainly wasn't.  very versatile.  next time i might do cheddar, thyme and rosemary or cheddar and dill.  great with the soups i make - hot and sour, clam chowder, tomato, won ton, french onion and beef/ barley.

Added 1/4 c Parmesan cheese, 1/4 tsp garlic paste, 1 1/2 tsp dried parsley and 1 tbsp baking powder as I don't have access to self rising flour in the Dominican Republic.  As I live at sea level and high humidity, I had to bake an extra couple of minutes but the basic recipe is excellent.

Following the recipe exactly the batter was almost as wet as pancake batter. Still, I tried. I dropped a spoonful onto my parchment-lined baking sheet whereupon it immediately spread out into a flat disk. I had to add 4 more heaping TBS of flour into the bowl to get a nice wet drop biscuit consistency. Then they were perfect. Rose up high and fluffy, with a creamy, tender crumb. Biscuit perfection, although I felt they'd benefit from a little sugar and salt to round out the flavor. I used White Lilly Self-Rising flour, it really DOES make the best biscuits. If it wasn't so easy (and obvious) that the simple addition of extra flour will fix them, I'd give 1 star. But with more flour and my additions, I'd give 5 stars, so I'm settling on 4.

Created self-rising flour using the suggestion in comments which stated: 2 cups less 4 tsp. sifted flour, 3 tsp. baking powder, and 1 tsp. salt. Baked them in muffin tins instead of a baking sheet for 15 minutes. Nice results.

These turned out very well, concidering it was my first time ever making biscuits.  I had to use all purpose flour because that's all I had on hand,  2 cups less 4 tsp. sifted flour, 3 tsp. baking powder, and 1 tsp. salt.  I'm going to make these again.

These are some of the best biscuits I've ever made!  The only modification I'd suggest is adding 1/2 tsp. sugar to the mixture, especially if serving them to the younger set.

I've been making these for years and it's never fail. The best easiest biscuits you can make. I should add, I still roll the dough into large balls and slightly flatten them before cooking. I hate the way drop biscuits look. It doesn't change the flavor obviously, but they look much nicer.

Just made this for breakfast and it was a hit, and in my family there is a lot of down south soul food cookers and this stood the test. Only thing different is I combined all dry ingredients and knead with hands and fold in milk slowly. Cooked them in a muffin pan also.

I was intrigued by the ingredients of these biscuits so I had to try them. I liked the soft, dinner roll-like texture but they had a bitter aftertaste. Perhaps the brand of mayo used was the culprit, Aldi's.  I may try again with another mayo to see if it makes a difference.

I had previously saved this in my recipe box and tonight I needed a little something extra to go with dinner and thought about the mayonnaise biscuits recipe. So I whipped these up while everything else was cooking. 

I didn't have any self-rising flour, but I knew the recipe for making two cups of self rising flour, since I've done that many times before; simply combine 2 cups less 4 tsp. sifted flour, 3 tsp. baking powder, 1 tsp. salt.  (Because I'm watching my salt intake, I only used 1/2 tsp. of salt.)

Since they're done in only 12 minutes, they were ready at the same time as everything else and they were delicious!  Yes, I will definitely make this again!!

With just three ingredients and ready in only 12 minutes, these great tasting biscuits are great on their own and anytime. Tonight we ate them with just a pat of butter. Unfortunately we didn't have any leftovers. Think I'll make some for breakfast Sunday; they will be great with jam! (6/2/15)


UPDATE:

Well, I've made these a few more time.  I consider these my "emergency biscuis" because they are quick and easy in a pinch or as a last minute add on to meal. 

I have also shared it with three or four people that say  they "can't cook" or "don't know how make biscuits" and were surprised how easy the biscuits were to make and one lady's family couldn't believe she made homemade biscuits either. ?? (6/5/16)

I've been baking biscuits for over 50 years and this is now my go to recipe. I mix the mayo into the flour with my fingers, add just enough milk till the dough sticks together and roll it out. The mayo creates a biscuit chemically similar to buttermilk biscuits - it provides the shortening and the  vinegar in the mayo reacts with the milk.

Amazing so easy to make and delicious!!!! Thank you for sharing this, I just made them for the 2nd time they are the best tasting biscuits I didn't change a thing, in answer to the Person that said the batter has a bad consistency, it sits up stiffer by the time you get them on the baking sheet. I almost didn't make them but so happy I did!

Not a big fan. Very bland. Needed salt. Also boosted the temp to 425 and the cook time to 15 minutes. Texture was alright- flavor was meh. Not inedible, mind you- slather it in butter or jam and it wasnt bad. But as a biscuit- Ive definitely had better.

Maybe I did something wrong, but I wasn't delighted with these biscuits. I followed the directions exactly, and this is my 1st time making mayo biscuits so maybe they're just not to my taste. I was low on butter and had no buttermilk, so I thought I'd try it. As a southern girl growing up on Bojangle's and Hardee's biscuits that are moist on the inside and crisp and salty on the outside, these were a little too sweet and tangy. Won't make again.

I make these all the time! Good for breakfast or dinner, you can add stuff to take them up a notch, and it only takes a couple mins to whip some up, really, I have made these first thing in the morning, and before the coffee was done these were in the oven and smelling good. 
These are drop biscuits. The bad reviews, probably didnt realize that. Or they may have used miracle whip instead of mayo maybe. I have added more flour to these, and actually rolled, fold, and cut these as well, and that worked fine too. But as written, it makes a good quick biscuit.

I've looked for years for an easy, quick, delicious biscuit recipe and FINALLY!!! This biscuit checked all the boxes and then some. Family gave it double thumbs up. I didn't have self rising flour, so used the baking soda/salt alternative and didn't have any problems. I did have to increase the baking time to 14 mins as I made 8 instead of 12.

Very good quick recipe.  They're a little bland plain (I'll find a way to fix that) but delicious with cinnamon butter.

These are fantastic! I was skeptical at first with the mayo but omg they are delicious! I don't have self rising flour either so I used the baking soda, salt trick as others posted. I cut the batch in half and make 2 big biscuits for hubby and I and pour some kind of chowder over top! Dinner served! So easy!!

Perfect, perfect, perfect! I was forced to use almond milk and Vegenaise (vegetarian mayo) and "make" my own self-rising flour (3 t baking powder/1 t salt added to the mix), and it STILL worked! Can't wait to try this recipe with some Hellman's & milk! Took another reviewer's advice to not over mix the dough, so I mixed the dry ingredients with each other first, then mixed the mayo and milk in a separate bowl before mixing the whole thing together. Fluffy, soft and delicious. Will become my go-to biscuit recipe!

I made these biscuits for dinner tonight and although they weren't the absolute best I've ever had, they were pretty good.  The family liked them.  Out of 12, 2 are left.  I think the mistake that's easy to make is to use all purpose flour when the recipe calls for "self-rising flour".  I had to look up how to make self-rising.  Basically you add 1 1/4tsp. baking powder & 1/4tsp. salt to every 1 cup of all purpose flour. So that was easy. Also 12 mins. baking time was not enough for me, I baked them for about 17.  Great biscuits with stew.

I was a little iffy at first when I saw Mayonnaise Biscuits, but I figured I would give it a try since I wanted to have biscuits with our dinner and we ran out of frozen ones we usually buy at the store.

Oh my goodness, I can't believe I ever doubted this recipe, they came out so well. Light, fluffy, melt in your mouth good.

I only made half a batch, because I wasn't sure how they would come out, so (un)fortunately, I had to make some more, because I ate all six biscuits before dinner was done.

I really enjoy that it only takes three ingredients. I've made these biscuits more than several times and have really liked them. I put in a little more milk and I like to bake them in a muffin tin. They are especially good with shredded cheese, garlic powder, and butter on top.

This recipe is dangerous!! OMG everyone in my house loves these and they are so easy to make we eat them all the time. Two tips: 1. Use a self scraping scooper to form the biscuits and plop them out onto the baking surface. 2. Bake them on a baking stone. They come out perfect every time!

My second batch was thicker and fluffier because it had time to rise. Keep in mind that these DO need some time to thicken. I thought I could just drop them on the cookie sheet and put them directly in the oven, but they turned out like pancakes. It's worth it to let them sit for ten to fifteen min if you have the time!

These were awesome! Mine took about 15 minutes in a 400 degree oven. I also broiled them for a couple of minutes to brown the tops. Perfect! My hubby loved them too! They cut easily and don't fall apart so you can add butter or jam. A+ and easiest recipe ever.

I just had to give these a 5 even tho I'd probably rate the texture as a 4 .... but the killer taste just demands a higher rating.  Seriously, these puppies rocked!  Mine came out a tad too crumbly for my own personal preference, but then again I had to make my own SRF and I didn't do the drop thing ... I patted down then cut out with smallish cutter.  I could definitely see these as mini biscuits as someone else mentioned using a mini-tin pan.  I did as submitted instructed and only added as much milk as necessary to bring it all together - probably about half of what she suggested.  Will definitely make again.

This is usually my go to recipe on biscuits.they can be a little bland when you just follow the recipe but it is a great base for savory biscuits. I usually top mine with any cheese I have lying around and they come out great every time.

Was looking for a good, quick and easy recipe for breakfast and I sure found it.. I followed the recipe to the tea but just added 1Tbl. of Baking Powder and 2Tbl. of Sugar.. Mmmmm These were perfect.. Be sure to not mix to much.. Batter seemed to be a little dry so added 1 Tbl. of Water.. =) =)

Absolutely horrid! Taste like paste. I thought they might turn out like a Bisquick drop biscuit,oh no way!I could only choke down about 3 bites.
Next time I will take a little extra time and make biscuits like normal.

this is a very easy and versatile recipe. I've added grated parmesan and Old Bay garlic and herb seasoning for savory biscuits and have enclosed dollops of jam in them for a sweet treat.

My husband called these "the best biscuits [he] has ever had". Really good and really easy; i like to add shredded cheese on top too and they make really nice cheese biscuits.

They are awesome, every time I make them. And so easy. If you don't have SR flour then you need to remove 4 tsp. of the flour and add 3 tsp. baking powder and 1 tsp. of salt. And use REAL mayo and not the kind with olive oil or low fat. A little fat isn't going to kill you! YUMMY for biscuits and gravy.

Loved this recipe.  At first, the batter was too thin, as mentioned in another review.  I just added a little more flour to the right consistency.  perfect.  will use this as a great base biscuit recipe and maybe add some cheese, and garlic to it next time for something a little different.

I tried twice, once with the user recommended AP flour mix and once with SR flour, and both times they ended up like dense pancakes.  Maybe it was the type of mayonnaise I was using (Kraft Mayo made with olive oil).  The flavor wasn't spectacular, but again, maybe it was because they didn't come out fluffy.

Loved these!  We call them Angel biscuits because they are so light and fluffy.  I wanted them somewhat symmetrical so I put them in muffin tins and they worked out awesome.  I also did not have self rising flour and accidentally made a double so I did 4 cups of flour minus 4tsp added 4 tsp baking powder and 1 1/2 tsp salt and for a mistake it was yummy!

Made these in a pinch.  They were fast, easy, and good!  Tasted even better after they had set for an hour; sort of remind me of KFC's biscuits.

Made them this morning. 7 stars, I was quite surprised I actually made biscuits that wasn't rocks! As others quoted, the use of a muffin pan will make them look more like biscuits. Mine look like scones, very fluffy in the inside. They resemble the biscuits at Red Lobster! Only had generic miracle whip, and they came out fine. Followed recipe as instructed, buttered the tops when done and broiled for about 2 minutes to lightly brown. No mayo taste, no flour, salt or bland taste. Thanks so much can't wait to surprise the hubby! This will be my go to recipe for now on.

SO simple and quick!  Only three ingredients listed.  However, I added 2 tablespoons baking powder extra, a little onion powder, garlic powder, shredded cheddar, BAY seasoning, and butter flavoring.  Yummy!  A favorite in our family for sure.

It's an excellent basic recipe. It worked out for me even though I used rice milk. The biscuits never turned golden brown, probably due to the change I've made, but they were baked through and fluffy. We all enjoyed them. Now I want to experiment a bit with adding different extras.

I LOVE this recipe! it uses little ingredients and is quick and easy to make!
I personally have an adversion to yeast (I cannot ,for the life of me, get it to work in any way shape or form) so I was super psyched when I saw how easy this was ;although, admittingly, the mayonnaise did wierd me out a litttle at first, but its nearly undetectable in taste.
Thanks!

These could not be any better considering there are 3 ingredients.  Very moist and tasty.  They took around 15 minutes to bake, just a little longer than the 12 recommended.  I used the olive oil mayo just because that is what I buy, and they were great.  I will turn to these anytime I am in a pinch!

If these biscuits were any easier they would make themselves!  I can't believe such a wonderful, moist, flavorful biscuit came from only three ingredients!  I will definitely make these again and you should give it a try!

These biscuits were super easy with only three ingredients but they looked awful.  They were smooth and looked more like a dinner roll.  I thought they had a nice flavor although I could taste the mayo.  They were good the next day too.

I found this recipe unimpressive; all I can taste is flour and salt, and the texture leaves something to be desired. My rating leaves room for the possibility that there was a mistake on my part, but I won't be using this recipe again.

I've never understood the appeal of homemade biscuits until I tried these.  These are flaky, yet they don't crumble apart when you split them.  I used Miracle Whip, which I could smell but not taste in the biscuits.  Even family members who gag at the mention of mayo loved these biscuits.

I have found my new favorite biscuit recipe.  These were quick and easy and delicious.  I have often made biscuits that were way too dense, but I was happily surprised with this recipe.  The biscuits were light and fluffy and cooked in exactly 12 minutes.  They remind me of the biscuits you can get at KFC or Popeye's.  I used skim milk and they still turned out wonderfully.  I did still use real mayo.  A definite keeper!  Thanks!

My mom used to make these ALL the time. A quick simple biscuit to go with just about any meal. The one difference (nothing major) Mom used to spoon drop these into a greased muffin tin, which works out just as well if not better than on a cookie sheet!

Very light and fluffy.  I was using a different drop biscuit recipe, but this has since replaced it.  It is so easy to make and has great flavor.  I use reduced fat mayo when I make this and they biscuits are never dry, so I don't believe this makes too much of a difference.

I needed something to go with soup tonight and although skeptical about how they'd turn out with only three ingredients, we loved these! I used skim milk and reduced fat mayo and they turned out great.

Very good for a 3 ingredient recipe. A little bland for my taste so I'll need to experiment to add flavor. Will be making these again.

These are so easy!  I remember my mother making these years ago, but hers seemed to have more tang from the mayo.  I may increase it next time to recreate her results.  I will use this recipe repeatedly.  Thanks!

Easy, fast and fantastically moist!   I added a handful of Mexican shredded cheese and some garlic powder and they were very similar to the ones from a famous pricey seafood restaurant chain.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made these with spoonfuls on the cookie sheet.  I didn't like the appearance, so I am going to try the muffin cup idea to see what happens.  They tasted great and I am going to give my newlywed son the recipe so they can enjoy them for breakfast!  He can cook these because they are so simple!

These were quite good and very easy. I only had garlic mayonnaise on hand, so they had a very subtle hint of garlicy-ness. Next time I'll make them with normal mayonnaise and see if it makes a difference.

I probably overmixed these- but they turned out AMAZING!  So soft, moist and yummy!  I made the full recipe into 6 Very Large biscuits, with pepperoni and cheese sandwiched in the middle, and a sprinkle of cheese on top...  I WILL be making these again!! UPDATE** I made these again, sub'd 1/2 the milk for marinara, added a handful of shredded cheese, a handful of sliced/diced pepperoni, and a few diced up sundried tomato pieces and mixed it all lightly together with my stand mixer.  It made 12 drop biscuits, They turned out good, texture was fantastic but flavor was "eh".  I will continue to use this recipe and experiment- it is PERFECT for trying new things as long as you keep the ratio amounts the same! Thank you so much!

These are not biscuits in my opinion but rather dinner rolls.  You want a more authentic biscuit, just cut the milk down to 3/4 cup.

Hmm, alright. Did the baking powder, no self-rising flour. Weren't wowed, but they didn't have that weird baking powrder taste, which is plus. Wish they had risen more, but before we knew it, we had eaten a lot of these.

These were surprising very good.  When I first read the recipe I though, yuck, mayonnaise??  In a biscuit?? But you cannot taste the mayonnaise and it renders a tasty, light biscuit. Followed the recipe exactly with no modifications.

These came out soft and fluffy with a melt-in-your-mouth texture. I'm quite sure they're supposed to turn out plain and not taste like mayonnaise. They're proably named so because mayo is used and not because of the taste. I do admit they tasted a little of flour but they tasted wonderful warm from the oven. For such an easy to make recipe with tasty results I will definitely be making more of these. Thanks for the recipe!

Followed the recipe to the T only I did have buttermilk on hand, so used that in place of milk. Got exactly 12 biscuits out of it. Mine took about 16 minutes to brown and look done, though they were a little crunchy on the outside so something was weird with the temperature there...
I thought these were good as a base or just if you want something really plain. Mine weren't very light/fluffy but they did rise, did have a good texture. But they really don't have much taste at all, so if you want that you need to add to it. 
Should say my parents enjoyed them a lot more than I did. Very quick and easy recipe, in any case!

I followed the recipe as written and I thought they were OK. My husband thought they tasted like flour and he usually will eat ANYthing but would not eat these.  Probably will not make again, thanks anyway.

Interesting.  I thought they tasted almost more like a pastry than a biscuit.  They were good though, and my husband liked them even though he's not a mayo fan.

Super EASY!  Very good. I made adjustments since I don't have self-rising flour and sprinkled garlic powder on top to go with my soup. My husband (not a biscuit eater) said they were better than Red Lobster's--Yum!

This recipe sure came in handy when my boys wanted biscuits and I was out of the 'usual' ingredients.  Although the idea of putting mayo in a biscuit recipe sounded odd, they turned out pretty darn tasty.  I will make them again!

I cannot get these biscuits light and fluffy! I've tried over and over. I've used ff ingredients, whole fat ingredients, recommended substitutions. Not over mixing, blah, blah, blah..lol.
Nothing works for me. They come out rather "flat", and dense. Still taste ok though. They have gone well with my meals. And I love them with honey dripping off as a midnight snack! I'll keep trying.

These were certainly easy enough.  I was a little worried about how soft the dough was but they turned out fine.  I used low fat mayo, nonfat milk and added about 1T of Splenda.  Hubby liked the cake-like texture; I would have prefered a flakier biscuit--so the rating is a compromise of his 5 and my 3.

This rating is a compromise.  My family rated them average, 3 stars.  I would rate them a 5.  So I averaged - 4 stars.  They are definately more like a roll than a biscuit, which is why I liked them.  Also, the dough is not as firm as most biscuits, but they turned out great.  Follow the recipe - don't add more flour.  I did use the substitutions for self rising flour since I didn't have any.

These biscuits went over great.  They are so quick to make and they are versatile for other dishes.  The only thing it lacks is diversity.  They are just biscuits(quality).

I recommend honey or jelly on these things after they are heated up in the microwave.

Sorry. I hated this recipe. My batter was so thin, like pancake batter. I added more flour, but still, yucky. They had a smooth finish, not lumpy and bumpy like a biscuit. THey were sour tasting. I just left mine in the oven, turned off the oven and ate our dinner. Came back later to clean up the mess.

This was on OKAY recipe.  I've tried making them twice, and while they are very fluffy, I find them very lacking in flavor.  Maybe dill and a little cheese would spice these up, but I don't see myself making them again any time soon.

These are awesome!  I love these biscuits.  My mom and I have been looking for a biscuit recipe that doesnt call for lard and still light and fluffy.  Found it!! Super quick & easy to make and cooks in just about 12 minutes.  Look no further and make these biscuits!

Fantastic! I've never had luck making biscuits from scratch, but this one is foolproof. My preschooler helped me out and we were both so proud. I used regular flour with the addition of 1 Tbsp baking powder and 1 tsp salt. We served it with a chicken stew and it was just right, with a few left over for breakfast.

Well I had no self rising flour so I followed others' opinions and made the correct adjustments, and I only had Miracle Whip so added some garlic powder and Mrs. Dash for the said lack of flavor.  I was scared to over-stir these so stopped at the 7th stir, which left me with one hell of an ugly looking mess in the bowl. Much of the flour stayed dry, so since I couldn't actually spoon up anything I just used my hands and tried to stick together as much of the dry dough as I could, and plopped them on the baking sheet.  They were ugly and never really browned at all, and I was so certain this recipe sucked that I threw it out.  My son and I had a good laugh at my feeble attempt and then we each took a bite just for the heck of it.  Turns out they tasted FABULOUS and went perfectly with the beef stew I had made for supper!  As well, the two that were left overnight on the counter tasted great this morning!  I am truly amazed and will definately make these again!

The first time I made these for my husband he was wowed that I made something so good in such little time.  These are a keeper!  Keep your eye on them, I have had them get a little dry on me because I made them smaller than usual and they cooked a bit too long.  They are great to add different ingredients too for a dinner biscuit!

Thanks, "oz heelee," for the suggestion to add parm cheese and chives - great flavor.  Would probably be even better with asiago cheese!  However, rated this 3 stars because texture was heavier than I would like, not light & fluffy like others said.  I may have overmixed it, though, and I didn't have self-rising flour.  (I used the suggestion to take out 1TB of the 2 c. of all-purpose flour and add 3 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp salt).  Maybe the flour makes a difference?  Decent recipe but I was not impressed.

I can't believe how light and fluffy these biscuits came out!  To top that off - I can't believe mayo makes these biscuits so good and you can't even taste it!!  I bet my hubby and sister $100 bucks if they could tell me the "odd" ingredient in the biscuits after they ate them all!  I still have my $100 dollars!

Really good biscuits. I was working frantically in the kitchen, behind schedule for dinner, with only 20 minutes left. I dumped the ingredients for these biscuits into a bowl, added some garlic powder and dried parsley and dropped them onto a cookie sheet. 14 minutes later, they were done - a soft, warm, flavorful biscuit that went really well with the Cheesy Chicken and Chive Sauce pasta recipe on this site and earned me a lot of praise. Will definitely make these again. Thanks for the recipe!

The batter was quite runny. It seemed better after letting half of it sit through the baking of the first batch. Will add more flour or less milk & mayo next time or let the batter sit for 15 minutes. Taste was excellent though!

I love these!  We use to make them growing up and I had completely forgotten about them until I saw this recipe.  They are super easy and turn out well even when using fat free mayo.  When you need biscuits fast, this is the recipe to go to.

These are bland dense lumps of flour with no "airyness" whatsoever. Made because I was short on time, next time I'll MAKE time.

Super easy and fast - I used these as part of a casserole, and they worked very well.  The flavor is much better than a canned biscuit and they are a healthier option if you use lowfat mayo.  Definitely a keeper, thanks!

This is a really good recipe.  The biscuits were very good and it was  quick and easy.  It is similar to my roll recipe except I add a little sugar and cook them in muffin pans.

I was very pleased with these light fluffy biscuits.  I had reservations about the mayonnaise but it turned out great. I did add 1/4 teaspoon of salt to the batter.

Quite simple and good.  Perhaps I have a sensitive nose, but I could smell the mayo.  That might've been cos I used Miracle Whip Light instead of mayo.  They were still good!!

These biscuits are very easy and quick to make and they look very nice coming out of the oven.  The only issue I had was that they weren't that flavorful and tasted a tad bit like flour.  I will definitely make again but may add a little sugar or butter flavored shortening.

I've used this simple and delicious recipe for years, but I put the dough in a greased muffin pan.  I've found that whole milk adds more flavor, but 1% works as well.

This is such an easy recipe! Seriously could not be easier. They rose beautifully for me & were not too dry. I served them with sausage gravy & the teenagers I had over said it made for the best breakfast they had ever had.

The first time I made these, I was sure I must have done something wrong.  The consistancy was off, and the flavor was rather bland.  They didn't taste bad, but they just didn't seem like biscuits to me or my family.

These are so quick and easy to make.  They have a unique taste and went great with the awesome pot roast slow cooker pot roast recipe from this site.
