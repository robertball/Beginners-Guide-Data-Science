Excellent!!!!! I wished I could give this recipe more stars.  LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!  I marinated 3 porterhouse steaks for 2-3 hours.  Scaled recipe down to 6, but had to double it so that it covered all 3 steaks.  This will be my #1 marinade for whatever beef.  Thanx a bunch.

This is a great marinade! I would agree with the previous reviewer, that this recipe produces a lot left as is. When I used it, I halved everything. The only exception is that I didn't have any cloved garlic, so I used 2 tablespoons of dried/minced garlic. It was magnificent.   I used this marinade with 2 8oz steaks, and it was more than enough.   Thank you JimChicago and Tennessee for your recipe and input!

This is a really simple, yet amazing, marinade.  I thought it was good on the rib steaks, but it was even better on the sirloins.  I admit it didn't taste the way I expected it to taste, but that's rather a good thing, because I was afraid it would taste too much like soy sauce or teryaki.:-)  Half the recipe was enough for 3lbs of steaks.  I used the ziplock method.

I tried this and liked it very much.  I let the  steaks marinate almost 24 hrs.  Great flavor. BUT NOTE : This recipe makes 34 servings, 4 1/4 cups.  That's a lotta marinade.  I cut the recipe in half and still had more than enough.   Also, next time I'm going to add some liquid smoke.  Fine recipe, JimChicago52, many thanks.

This marinade was really good and very easy. I substituted red wine vinegar, and it was still really flavorful.

This is a great marinade by itself. I add about 1/2 tsp sesame oil and usually grated onion. Sometimes I use wine or Mirin instead of the cider vinegar and add a tsp of Coriander. I cut down the amount needed a lot when I started using a zippered bag. I just add all the ingredients and shake the bag up well then add the steaks and evacuate all the air. it keeps the liquid in contact with every inch of the meat. Thanks for sharing this!

This marinade is fine and will do the job, but there are plenty of others on this website that are much better. It's better than no marinade, but not in the top tier.

I love this recipe, lots of volume so you can use it with a shorter marinating period.  I used prime rib steaks and the results were awesome.  Dusted them with Chicago rub before I smoked them and the combo was fantastic.

Very tasty! I marinated porterhouse 2 hours, turning it occasionally. The hub loved it and would give it 5 stars. The East Asian flair was a nice change from my typical more traditional flavors. I suspect this would be awesome on pork.

I've used this several times now since first trying it and have to say, I'm not sure I'll ever use any other marinade recipe since I like this one so much.   I do reduce it to about 1/8th.

This was really good and added some nice flavor to a cheaper cut of beef.  I cut the recipe in half because it seemed like way to much for what I was going to be marinating and there was still plenty.  I used 1 Tbsp each of cider vinegar, minced garlic and ground ginger.  I think the only change I will make next time is to cut the ginger down a little bit.  It seemed a little overpowering to me.

I thought this marinade turned out really well. I read other comments regarding the soy sauce. I cut it back to 1-1/2 cup and it was excellent. The meat was nice and tender. So good and worth using again and again.
