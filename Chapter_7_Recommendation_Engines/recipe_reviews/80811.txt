I gave this only 3 stars because I had to really kick it up several notches to make it something we would eat.  First, I added a tablespoon of crushed garlic to the butter and diced onions.  I then added a pint of thickend cream and 1/4 cup of dry sherry to the pan along with the feta cheese.  I simmered that until it was reduced, then added a pound of shrimp and some minced chives.  This made it substantially a different recipe, but one I could serve to company.  The basic recipe was a good start, just needed some major tweaking. My changes, served over the pasta, made 4 very generous servings for my company.  Thanks for the basics though....great springboard!

This was a great recipe.  I just put a little bit of personal touch to it.  I doubled the amount of sauce beause when cooking the dish I decided that for me, I needed more sauce.  Also I used light butter to cut the fat, add a touch of garlic, a bit of lemon juice, and some asparagus, it makes a yummy dish I can eat even on my diet.

This is exactly the kind of recipe I've been looking for, for years - simple flavors, and interesting at the same time.  The flavors are subtle but compelling.  I doubled the amount of shrimp and feta (since I like a significant amount of protein), and cut the pasta in half, to make 4 servings.  Since I will be the only one eating it, I added about 2 tablespoons of butter to the pasta to keep it from becoming a nasty, congealed lump before my next meal.  The ease of preparation is an added bonus.  I am grateful for this recipe and will definitely be making it often.

Something is wrong, 2 tbl. butter and 4 oz. shrimp  doesn't cover 16 oz pasta at my house. I doctored up the recipe in great detail. Search ingredients for shrimp and feta cheese for several recipes that warrant using expensive ingredients. This is not a do-again recipe.

Was a good base but added extra feta used oil & garlic instead of butter. added onions & zucchini while pasta boiled. then added shrimp to onions with extra feta & dab of butter to cream sauce. added chives before serving. Definitely needed extra sauce but good start.

Nice quick and easy recipe. I used wholemeal pasta(40g penne pasta instead), and 2 tsp low fat margarine instead of butter. I also used spring onions ( scallons in the US) in place of onions. I used precooked prawns from the freezer and just defrosted them in minutes. It is a very easy recipe to make when in a rush ( I used 42g of feta as well as 113g of prawns). The liquid from the prawns helps to make the sauce which is great as an alternative to red sauce. Even my 3 year old loved it. This was just enough for 1 person as I wasn't feeding many. Next time I will add from chopped garlic and maybe a bit of fresh parsley.

Excellent flavor.  Quick and easy recipe.  Will either double the amount of sauce I make or cut back on the amount of pasta next time, as there was too much pasta for the amount of sauce made by the recipe.

This was so simple, and amazing how the feta cheese blended immediately with the liquid from the shrimp, to make a tasty, creamy rich sauce. I plan to have this as a regular thing.

As written this recipe was too dry. As other reviewer mentioned, there definitely wasn't enough sauce for the amount of pasta used. What I did to combat that problem was after I cooked the onion and shrimp, I transferred them to a bowl and added white wine to the skillet. I reduced the wine and used that for my sauce. I also added sun-dried tomatoes and fresh parsley for extra flavor.

Five stars with a lot of revisions.  Added chopped zucchini to the shrimp saute.  Used Italian dressing instead of butter for added flavor.  Used green onion instead of white.  Squeezed half a lemon into the mixture.  Also added about 1/2 cup to 1 cup of milk for extra creaminess.  also added old bay seasoning to the shrimp.  OH - used bowtied pasta.  I was told that I MUST make this meal tomorrow.  WONDERFUL AND QUICK TO MAKE!!!!!!    Added note:  I have been making this for several months now.  Have subbed chicken, added sauteed frozen veggies, and have yet to complain about the meal.

I call this recipe a good  "jumping off" recipe for me.  To kick up the flavor a bit more for my family, I sauteed minced garlic and diced red bell pepper with the shrimp.  The red bell pepper was mainly to add more color to the dish, as I tend to shy away from serving monochromatic dishes.  I also added 1/2 cup of dry white wine to the sauce and then freshly chopped parsley, for more color. Loved it!

This dish was excellent! But I did have to make changes. The amount of pasta is really way too much for half a pound of shrimp. I used one pound of frozen shrimp which I defrosted by boiling some water and turning off the heat then placing the shrimp inside and covering the top for about 3 minutes-then I continued by sauteing the shrimp with the onions and garlic as the recipe calls for. I also used about half a brown onion rather than the two tablespoons the recipe calls for. In addition, I doubled the amount of feta cheese-this made the amount of sauce plentiful. I also made sure to add garlic as some of the other reviewers suggested. When adding the sauce to the pasta I had a seperate bowl where I added both the sauce and the pasta as I went along mixing to make sure I didn't have too much of either. I did end up throwing away a bit of the pasta because it was still too much for the sauce! But when I was done, I had a restaraunt quality dish! It made about 5 servings.

Need to add 3/4 cup of milk and more cheese as it needs lots more sauce. I added Bay spice and spinnach like others to make it 5 star. Cut pasta to 8 oz.

This is one of those recipes where I thought I didn't have anything to make for dinner and bam! here it was! Quick and easy and really delicious. 

Made 4 serving size with 2tbs of butter and added some leftover broccoli a little bit of orange bell pepper and seasoned the shrimp with pepper flakes for a little zest. Also added some 2 cloves of garlic to the onions. Topped it off with frozen parsley I always have in the fridge. 

Great recipe.

I viewed this recipe about an hour ago, and I tried it.  I substituted the feta cheese for velveeta cheese because I'm saving the feta for something else.  I also added a little bit of pesto sauce from a jar.  Needless to say, I enjoyed it.  Very simple recipe, and I WILL try it again.

Recipe was great but called for too much pasta that the sauce wasn't evenly spread to taste.

This was quite tasty - simple, light and delicious. I made it exactly as written, except that I had a little more than a half-pound of shrimp on hand, and used it all. Like some previous reviewers, I also have a slight problem with the proportions - a full pound of pasta is way too much for the "other stuff", in myh book. If i were to make this again, I'd cut the pasta down to a half-pound, or double everything else. One other minor quibble is that, as is, there are really no added herbs or spices. The feta adds some nice flavoring to the simple butter/shrimp/onion flavors, but this recipe is a little noticeable for the lack of a little basil? thyme? or something like those. But overall, this is a very nice recipe, which I just might make again, with my suggested changes.

The flavours in this recipe are an excellent combination, and I think it's a great start. Based on other reviewers' suggestions, I cut the amount of pasta in half (kept the other proportions the same), and added a clove of garlic in with the onion. I used a combination of olive oil and butter, and used some shrimp I had seasoned with garlic salt a few days prior, so they were VERY flavourful and delicious :) Even using 1/2 of the pasta, I still felt it could have used more sauce. But like I said, it's an excellent base recipe that is easy to customize and quick to prepare. Thanks for sharing!

I thought this was great!!  I did substitute olive oil for the butter and threw in some garlic and I used less than 1/2 the pasta.  I can see why some may think it's a bit dry...it is not really a sauce, but more a topping, but I would double everything but leave the pasta the same.  Thanks!

I read the reviews and doubled the sauce and I would  suggest even tripling it. It is a very good base as many said, I did add garlic and a little Old Bay seasoning but other than that..This will definately be on our monthly menu again.

As written this is just average, but, I added spinach, swiss chard, and diced tomatoes to it and it was a 5 star meal after that! I served it with WW pasta. I picked this recipe because I have tons of feta cheese that I needed to use. This was a great way to use it with ingredients that I always have on hand.

I thought this dish was very good, yes it did need some garlic, but as I am on a lowfat diet this was perfect for me. I also added steamed brocoli and snowpeas and grape tomatoes. Not everyone can eat food smothered in cream sauces. Keep the low fat food recipes coming

This was fantastic. I added basil pesto to the pasta before I poured the shrimp/feta in and stirred it all together. Definately will make again.

Loved the flavor of the feta and the shrimp.  Based on other reviews, I added garlic and also increased the amount of shrimp to 1/4 pound per person.  I replaced the butter with olive oil and used whole wheat pasta.  I had some black olives in oil in the frig and added a few of those to the finished sauce and they blended well with the feta.  Will definitely make this again, very quick and good.

I thought this was amazing!  I did add about 1 1/2 tsp. minced garlic and about 1 cup marinated artichoke hearts.  Because of other reviews saying that there wasn't enough sauce, I used half of the noodles. this was plenty for my family. I couldn't stop eating!

I gave this 4 stars because of its texture, the shrimp and the pasta with this feta cheese sauce needs more liquid...for my liking. I think the key I will try next time will be a tablespoon of lemon juice. This time I used the olive oil and the feta cheese I chose already had the garlic and herb in it. Along with adding about a 1/4 cup of heavy whipping cream to 7 oz of feta cheese and 1 lb of shrimp and 13oz of Angel hair pasta.  Over all a good taste, just texture issues to my family.

I really thought this was going to be delicious but to my surprise it was very dry. The Feta gave it some flavor but I think it would of tasted better with some kind of sauce. My husband decided to put some Italian dressing on it and it did taste better then.

I followed this recipe exactly and it was extremely dry and lacked flavor. I made this again changing the recipe a great deal and it turned out fantastic. The pasta and shrimp remained the same but here are the changes I made: 4 Tbls. butter, 1/4 cup diced yellow onion, 1/4 cup diced green onion, 6 oz. Feta cheese, 8 oz. heavy cream, 8 oz. Alfredo sauce and 2 cloves garlic.

My husband and children absolutely loved this recipe.  My husband said it's a keeper.  I did however make some minor changes.  I used half the amount of pasta as other reviewers suggested and I used olive oil and garlic instead of the butter and onion and used a lot of feta cheese and it made a nice creamy sauce.  I don't eat shrimp so I didn't taste it but my five and 9 year old cleaned their plates so you know it was good.

This was so delicious!  Exactly what I wanted. This recipe was great to build on.  I added: a few splashes of heavy cream, cherry tomatoes, dried basil, and red pepper flakes.  Yummy!!  Will definitely make this again and again.

I had to make a substantial amount of changes to make this edible- gimme a break- 16 oz. of pasta with 2 Tbsp of butter and 4 oz. of feta? Not in my kitchen. I halved the pasta, used nearly a pound of shrimp and added garlic, and lots of parmesan cheese, plus a generous amount of olive oil to keep the noodles from sticking. A friendly alfredo sauce would have been nice if I would have had the cream on hand.

Lick the plate good with some added changes. Doubled the butter, added a tablespoon of chopped garlic and some spinach. Next time we make we will add a hint of fresh lemon juice to see what it adds.

So easy and so good..... light but creamy.

I followed the recipe to a T, except it was very dry at the end, so I doubled the butter.

I recommend doubling the butter, shrimp, and adding a bit more feta. Also, put some oil in the water then you are boiling the noodles so they don't stick (mine were in a big clump when I tried to mix the shrimp in). Still, a delicious recipe that I'll definitely make again.

Minced garlic with the butter might have been better.  I added garlic powder, used at least double the amount of onions, more shrimp, more cheese, and half the amount of pasta.

I read the reviews and listened. Boiled some spinach. Sauteed green onions, tomatoes, added chopped spinach about 5 cloves of sliced garlic, salt pepper, added shrimp and when shrimp was ready added feta cheese. Mix well. Do not over cook the shrimp. Serve over pasta and top off with parmesan. NOW THAT WAS DELICIOUS.

Everyone absolutely loves this dish and it's so simple. I use a pound of shrimp and only 12 ounces of pasta instead of the whole package. I also wilt a bag of spinach with the shrimp and feta before adding the angel hair.

The only thing seasoned with this pasta is the shrimp so it would be better to add alfredo sauce to the pasta then add the shrimp; otherwise there would be a few seasoned shrimp here and there and dry pasta. Also, you may want to add the entire 1lb of shrimp instead of 1/2 lb. Depends if the person is more of a pasta or meat eater. But easy and great weekly recipe!!!

It was an easy recipe,there for I gave it three stars for that reason. I did not like the feta cheese though.  That is just my taste.  I think we would have liked it better with parmasan cheese instead.
