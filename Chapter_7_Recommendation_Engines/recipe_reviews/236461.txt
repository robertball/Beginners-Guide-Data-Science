Super.  Used extra T of flour, added 2 T butter to olive oil, fresh corn, 1 carrot with the onion and celery, no peas.  Came out great and nice and sweet.  Delicious.

After adding some blackened shrimp,  roasted Hatch  chiles, and mini tri-color chiles + about 1/4 C cream cheese, this became 5 stars easily.

Very good chowder. I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I only veered when it came to peas, of which I had none, so I added a couple of Brussels Sprouts for colour.  What an excellent way to use left over cooked salmon.  Thanks to the recipe submitter.
