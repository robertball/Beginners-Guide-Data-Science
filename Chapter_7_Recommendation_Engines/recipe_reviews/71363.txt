I had some red peppers in the fridge that were a few days old, and I went looking for recipes to use them up. This one really fit the bill! I roasted the peppers under the broiler and after letting them "steam" in a small paper bag for several minutes, the charred skins slipped right off; seeding and deveining is slippery but quick. I used only olive oil and I sub'd skim milk for the h&h (to save a few fat grams, of course!). I also pureed the soup -- I adore cream soups because they seem so decadent. The flavor was complex, and the color was lovely!

This is one of my families favorites soups!! I actually add 2 jars of roasted red peppers and simmer the soup all day. It lets the potatoes cook down and the broth becomes thicker and adds flavor.

This was very good... I made it for a crowd and didn't feel like dicing everything, so I roughly chopped everything, cooked as directed and pureed it in the end.  That gave it a nice chowder-like consistency.  And I will say, the flavor is wonderful the next day!

my boyfriend and i both enjoyed this one! i had white potatoes in the cupboard at the time, so used 5 small/medium of those instead of red. i also had a couple of fresh red peppers, so i just peeled and roasted them myself with a little olive oil. also used a veggie boullion cube with about 1 L of water to make the broth since we don't eat meat. came out great, and there was just enough red pepper to enhance the flavour without overpowering the other ingredients. i know i didn't follow the recipe exactly, but i don't see how this recipe will make 6 servings unless it's as a starter (the pot was completely emptied between the two of us eating it as a meal with bread and we still had room for dessert). i will definitely make this one again, but if i were cooking for more than 2 people, i would increase the portions considerably. either way, great soup!

Love this soup! I roast my own peppers, and add a touch of cumin, curry and red pepper flakes for a bit of heat and more complex flavor.  I also prefer arrowroot (Asian groceries often have it) as a thickening agent instead of flour, but you can also get potato starch at the Asian market, too which works. No "floury" taste.

I'm a huge fan of soups, and this is one of the best according to guests...pretty color, too.

This turned out well!  I used whole milk instead of half and half, and next time I would put chopped spinach in it, but it was a nice soup for winter... tasted even better and a little thicker as leftovers. yum!

WOW!  I used three fat garlic cloves, cream and dried dill instead of thyme.   I Roasted the peppers myself before hand with a little olive oil, balsamic vineger and chopped garlic glaze.  Gotta peel the skins off the peppers this way but MAN is it worth it.   Best soup I made this year. Thanks!

I love soup and this is a tasty one! It tastes like something you'd find in a fancy-pants restaurant ;) I had about 10 fresh peppers from the market that needed to be used, so I cut them in half and seeded them, and roasted them open side down on a greased baking sheet for about 15 minutes at 450*. They peeled easily once cooled. I also used only vegetable oil to saute the veggies as I had no butter (the 1/2and1/2 cream in the recipe gives the soup a very buttery taste in the end anyway!). Didn't have fresh thyme, but for spices I used 1 teaspoon thyme, 1 teaspoon curry, 1/8 teaspoon cayenne, and a dash of crushed chili peppers. It really turned out beautifully, with a bright orange color and a tasty aroma that filled the house! This is a recipe I will make again :oP Yum!

Wow, this soup is wonderful, thick and creamy and very tasty. I followed the recipe almost completely. I left out celery (didn't have any), used a teaspoon dried thyme in stead of fresh, and added an extra potato, but those were the only modifications (well, I did use fresh peppers. I just followed the directions from other reviews and it was very easy to do) Based on other reviews I was not sure if it would turn out thin (I like soups that are creamy and of thicker consistence), but decided I could always thicken it up with more flour later if needed. It turned out very thick and creamy, almost a bit too thick, when I went back for seconds I had to add some milk and heat up again. It was so thick from sitting one the stove for 30 minutes that I could have eaten it with a fork. So next time I will cut down on the flour. Next time I will also leave out the extra potato. Three is plenty even though I love potatoes. I might try to make it with half the potatoes and cauliflower instead of carrots. I think that will be a good match. Thanks for a  wonderful recipe.

I really enjoyed this recipe and I am not a big potato soup fan. I made it with grilled ham and cheeses and my family loved it. My picky four year old even told me that I made a really great dinner tonight. ya! score! I used 2% milk instead of the half and half, celery flakes instead of the celery, I also omitted the butter and used olive oil to saute the veggies. Delish! Thank you for a great recipe.

This soup was wonderful. We grow are own potatoes and my boyfriend told me to find different potato soup recipes. I found this one and he wanted to try it. I added a little more flour because we like it thicker and since we had alot of Banana Peppers I added a couple of them with the onions. With them and the Red Roasted Peppers it has a great flavor. We plan on making this soup again. My boyfriend fell in love with it. Thank you for sharing it.

Yum.  Had 1 red, 2 orange, and 1 yellow bell pepper needing to be used up.  Roasted in the oven, paper bag, etc.  Upped the carrots and celery to 2 stalks each. used 6 cups vegetarian "chicken broth". Used 5 med-lg red potatoes.  Didn't have cream on hand, and was intending to add milk at the end, but completely forgot about. Really didn't need it w/the extra 2 cups broth anyway. Added cumin, curry, dill, dash cayenne & red pepper flakes.  Used immersion blender directly in the bowls for those who wanted it pureed (me + 2 kids) and left the rest unpureed for hubbie and son.  It's good both ways.  Also, threw some baby spinanch in near the end that needed to be used up (1-2 cups).  Delicious!

Loved this! This soup was better than I had expected. I did make a couple of modifications as suggested by other reviewers: pinch of cumin, curry powder and cayenne. It has a great slightly sweet yet subdued flavour that makes it great as a meal. Thanks for sharing! :)

I liked this, but it wasn't what I was expecting.  I expected a thicker soup.  Still, it was a nice change of pace.  I used fat free half and half

Excellent recipe!!  I needed a lighter version of potato soup b/c mine is VERY high in fat and cal.  This was wonderful...we scaled it down to 2 servings and had a cup of soup with a sandwich and side salad.  I was out of half & half so I subbed skim milk instead and it worked.  I used my immersion blender to cream some of the potatoes, but it still had really good texture.

The recipe as it stands needs work.  My largest complaint is that it's way too thin. Additionally, the red peppers aren't that noticeable.  (It looks nothing like the picture that's up, by the way - it's not pink at all.) I'm going to try it again, but in the future, I'll use two potatoes, double the roasted red peppers, and cut the chicken broth by a third or maybe even a half.

This soup was good but we needed to add a little more in the seasoning department.  I did use two jars of red peppers and heavy whipping cream because I was out of half and half.  I will make this again with some more tweaking.  It was great with grilled cheese!  My 1 year old loved it also and that says a lot.  I did blend the whole batch for a smoother soup.

This soup rocks! I, too added, double the peppers, and strained the soup through a colander after blending with my immersion blender. Also, didn't add the thyme. We all enjoyed it.

Pretty good, although too potato-ey and not enough red peppery for my taste.  I put this in the blender to make a creamy soup (since, unlike the picture would lead you to believe, the directions do not say to do!).  I served in sourdough bread bowls, which made a really easy meal look elegant.  Next time I think I'll cut down on the potatoes and do more peppers.  The husband loved it.

This was soooo good! I've been on a roasted red pepper kick lately (they've been on sale at the grocery store a lot!) and so I wanted to find good recipes to use them up. I omitted the celery and thyme, used about half the chicken broth and added an extra 6 oz of purred peppers along with the chopped ones, and some salt and pepper. I think using less broth helps it to be thicker without pureeing the entire soup at the end. I had one bowl of it before pureeing, and another after, and both are sooo good. I will definately be making this again! Thank you!

This was interesting and good.  I added 2 extra heaping tablespoons of flour to thicken the base, and would add even more in the future to make it a creamier soup.  I would also add 2 more red potatoes, and let them really cook down some more to add substance to the base.  Overall, it was good and I would try it again.

I did not enjoy this potato soup at all - and I love roasted red peppers.  Not sure what I didn't like about it other than I prefer a creamier, thicker potato soup.  Will not be making this again.

This is my new favorite! I did follow advice from some others...I roasted my own red peppers in olive oil and garlic, and I left out the carrot and celery(I didn't have any on hand) I did however use a dash of celery seed. Amazing!

I overdid it with the broth and my soup came out to thin. So in a seperate pan, I mixed butter, cream, and flour until I got a good creamy consistency and then i stirred it in real good with my soup..........it turned out great. This is a great soup to warm the soul in the cold winter months. Thanks!

We liked this. I'd make it again if I had roasted red peppers to use up (as I did tonight). I would add more of them, if I had more, as 6 oz was not really enough to even taste the red peppers. I used my immersion blender to liquefy my vegetable medley, then pre-baked & skinned my potatoes from the microwave to the pot (because I used Yukons, they would have taken forever to just cook in the soup). I added extra potatoes, also, & mashed them in the pot with a potato masher. Served with Cheddar cheese & real bacon bits on the side. Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe as is and this soup was okay.  Tastes like what it is - butter, milk and chicken broth, very thin.  I think it would be better pureed with red pepper flakes and maybe some instant baby reds mashed potatoes added.

This is one of the best soup recipes ever.  I would have liked it to have been a bit more thicker but the taste made up for it.  I did not have half and half but i did have heavy cream which may have been a little more fattening but it did the job.  I used idaho brown potatoes and added chopped fresh parsley and added a pinch of nutmeg for an added layer of flavoring.  My 3 and 4 yr old couldnt get enough of it so that says alot in its self.

A definite keeper!  I did roast my own peppers and also added a generous dash of habanero sauce.  The soup has a great texture and light yet rich flavor.  When blending, remember to do so in small batches.

This soup was great.  I make a lot of soup, because it's easy, but this recipe was much better than average.  I used Yukon Gold potatoes instead of the Red.

This one  excellent soup!  Each of the veggies plays a subtle but distinctive role.  I prefer a thicker base so I used more flour, but either way this recipe is a winner.  My hubby isn't a big fan of soups but he took a BIG second helping.   A pot of this  comfort food would be great to take to a new neighbor or an ailing friend.

I made this for the first time tonight and my husband and I thought it was very good. My husband prefers soups with meat so next time I might add chicken to the soup, or serve grilled ham & cheese sandwiches instead of crusty bread. I've added the recipe to my favorites and will make it again.

Delicious! I followed the ingredients to a tee except used yellow flesh potatoes. Like most of the other reviews, blending was necessary, but I blended before adding the peppers, then partly blended the peppers in which gave more texture and flavor to the soup.

Took the advice of others, and roasted my own peppers (and will never buy the bottled ones again). Followed the recipe as is just added some red pepper flakes, a bit of rosemary. Pureed half, and delicous!

Yummy! This one is going to be a keeper. Had potatoes to use up. Being vegetarian I used veg broth and used the whole 12 oz jar of peppers. Got to the end and puréed most of it. It is so rich and delicious I'm not sure if I will be adding cream (almond milk) or not. Either way, I will be smiling. Thanks for sharing your great recipe!

Really good!  Great recipe.  I do think using a hand immersion blender works great for this at the end - makes it smoother.  My husband doesnt care for red pepper so I didnt tell him they were in there and he didnt know.  He loved this!  Also, I do question the timing of putting in the flour.  I did it but it immediately got chunky with the vegies.  Later, I added a bit of flour with some melted butter (didnt use butter at beginning) and then whisked in some milk.  I then poured that into the soup instead of the cream.  It was plenty rich doing it this way and next time I will wait to add the flour.  Really good idea and great use of jarred peppers (the one I used was from Trader Joes - mixed yellow and red).

I roasted my own red peppers.  A bit time consuming so next time I might just use the bottled peppers.  Substituted milk for cream and added hot pepper flakes to give it some bite.  Forgot to add the thyme but still tasted great.

I loved it!  I had enough to share w friends as well.  I can't wait to make it for the girls @ work!  I doubled the peppers (put 'em in the blender before adding), used celery seed, dash of nutmeg, and left out the salt.  Gracious, it was Heavenly.  Thank you for sharing.

This soup is good.  I used more red peppers and also added about 1/2 cup fennel bulb.  It is a very light colored soup, so not as attractive as I thought it would be.

I give this 4 stars as written but 5 stars with a slight change. I used 6 cups of water and 6 beef bullion cubes and left out the thyme and it was very, very good.

This was not the most attractive soup I've ever made (mine looked more white than red), but the flavors were great.  We're big soup eaters and I will definitely do this one again.  However, I think I'll puree as others did to improve the appearance.

Pretty good! I thought the thyme was too much, so I added some parsley as well to cover the thyme flavor. Next time I'll try to make it thicker, though.

Great soup.  Not as thick as some potato soups, but that is good- not as fattening.  I made it for 8 servings instead of the listed 6.  We served it for Christmas lunch, and it was enough for 8 people, with some having seconds and some left over.  I increased the red pepper slightly, otherwise made it as directed.

What a wonderful recipe. I convienced my husband to try this new soup, who is a very fussy eater. Well,he went crazy for it and so did my staff at work.Everyone want's this recipe.
