I loved this cocktail with the peach schnapps in it. I did not just pour the shots over ice. I wanted it really cold, what I did was pour the shots over ice in my cocktail shaker and shook the contents until ice cold. Delicious!

So, I have to admit, I made this simply because I had all (ok, ok, most) of the ingredients on hand and the recipe needed a "face".  I was fully prepared not to even really like it (I'm a beer girl).  However, it works.  It really works.  In the spirit of full disclosure, we do not stock gin (one bad night in college.  Enough said.) so I left that out.  Per personal preference, I did up the cola a bit (Coke Zero here, and it said "to taste").  The peach really works.  I kind of dig this.  THANKS for the change of pace, CA Momma!

I'm a long Island Iced tea drinker who loves to try new things.  This was very smooth and delicious.  I've frequently asked bartenders to add peach schnapps, especially in the summer.

I'm not a cola drinker so I replace it with orange juice.  I also play with flavored vodka (peach) , rum and gin (both pineapple).
