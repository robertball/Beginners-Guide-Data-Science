Oh my gosh, regretfully did not get a picture. I was frying them as an app as my dinner guests showed up, they were going so fast and were so tasty I completely forgot to snap a pic! Definitely a huge hit, It was funny watching everyone to try and be polite but also anxious to grab them up as they came out of the fryer. there was 6 of us and everyone loved them. 

1.  I will say these are a bit on the fishy side, we loved it BUT If you despise the kick of a fishy taste skip the fish sauce and maybe half or exclude the anchovies, that will really tone it down. 
2. I bought extra large Mrs. Baird's white bread. The recipe went a lot further than 4 pieces of bread, the paste coated more like 9-11 pieces. and I really put it on thick. 
3. I forgot to toast the bread ahead of time and everything was perfect so don't worry if you forget that step. 
4. The suggested Fry time is on point, 2-3 minutes
5. keep your windows open or a air purifier handy, this will fish up your house. 

Definitely a repeat, I really can't wait to make these again and am already trying to think of the next opportunity I can dish theses out and watch my guests eyes light up with delight. I may just simply make some for lunch and invite my dad over. They are the bomb.

I will definitely make this again, but I am thinking of a few changes, which is rare for me when I make anything of Chef John's. I'm a huge fan of him, I've loved everything I have tried just as he's written it. I'm also a huge fan of shrimp toast, always ordering it when it is on the menu, so I was excited to find his version. I had 10 oz. of shrimp and wanted to use it all, so I adjusted the recipe on here to get the right amount of seasonings and flavorings. I'm not sure what to change, but it was a bit "strong" to me. Perhaps next time I will try to make using his amount of shrimp so I don't adjust other items and see what that gets me. It was a bit salty for me, so I'll wait to add salt after tasting. Also, I think I might put shrimp in last and pulse a little less to have a few larger bits of shrimp. I'll let you know how that turns out. I still have some paste, so I'd like to try a few baked just to see if it will still have that awesome crunch. Keep 'me coming, Chef John, I love your art!

Very good! I didn't have water chestnuts, so I used chopped mushrooms in the paste. I never have store white bread as I make our bread, and used it instead. Made sure to make the shrimp paste the same thickness as the bread; worked perfectly. My husband really liked  this; I will definitely make again!

i looked at this recipe so many times but never seemed to have any shrimp at the time, so i used canned clams! it was delicious!  i didnt have water chestnuts, sesame seeds, anchovies or fish sauce either, but it still tasted great and it plated so pretty with the green onion garnish! if you have a good imagination, you can make anything from a good basic recipe. i never have to change Chef Johns recipes, but i was dying to try this one-so i did the best with what i had. glad i tried it and i cant wait to make it with shrimp! (or maybe crab!!) Thanks Chef John!

Be Careful - Written recipe is misleading - watch the video.  To those who felt this is too salty, or overly fishy, I think the problem is that the written recipe misleads one into thinking they should add an entire can of anchovy fillets.  Watching the video, however, you realize Chef John only adds one filet, not the entire can.  Hope this helps. :)

This Shrimp Toast was thoroughly disappointing. Followed recipe to the letter and was dissatisfied with over aggressive flavor balance -- far too salty,  1 tbsp of fresh ginger excessively presented.  Tsp of Fish Sauce was probably contributing to unkind flavor balance. Find a simpler recipe, you'll be more satisfied with outcome.

Very good. Next time I will add half the amount of coriander. I baked it in in the oven after defrosting the loaf baked initially up and down and last few minutes just up.

Oh my !! Chef John hit it out of the ballpark...again !! This is the best shrimp toast I’ve ever tasted, including all restaurants !! Such a wonderful flavor, not dripping in grease and makes a beautiful appetizer when plated with a ramekin of sweet & sour sauce !! I’ve gotten rave reviews twice ( I’ve made it twice, SO FAR !! ) Try it, you’ll love it !! Thank you Chef John !!

I made this shrimp toast for a party I was having and it was a big hit. It was a little work but well worth the time it took.

Nope.
Not even close to the creamy decadant shrimp toast from the local Pinoy hut in either Colorado or Wisconsin. I’m thinking pre cooking the shrimps and the addition of cream cheese.?

I left the crust on some of the bread and preferred it that way. I tried cutting into different sizes, smaller is better. They were a little oily and we preferred them heated up the next day as they had time for the oil to leach out. I will definitely trying blogging them more with paper towel next time.
I didn't have anchovies so I added some MSG.
They were a little on the salty side.
Overall they were delicious.
