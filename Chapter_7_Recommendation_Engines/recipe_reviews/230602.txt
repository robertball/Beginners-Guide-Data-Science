Definitely use ony about half of the vinegar! I also added an additional tablespoon of peanut butter and a litle bit of brown sugar to the sauce. This recipe is a good basis for any stir-fry and works well with any type of meat and/or vegetables. I will make this again!

My husband and I made this last night.  We used coconut oil in place of peanut oil as that is what we had and we cooked the garlic with the beef to flavour it.  We initially doubled the sauce with the exception of the rice vinegar (thanks to the other reviews) and the soy sauce (only added an extra tablespoon) and ended up adding about an extra tablespoon of peanut butter and about the same of the chili sauce.  The cornstarch and water were left out completely as we felt they were not necessary.  We ate this with jasmine rice and sprinkled chopped peanuts on top. We enjoyed it and will make it again but will reduce the rice vinegar further next time.  I would like to try this with chicken as well.

The peanut butter thickens the sauce. Really don't need the cornstarch

Followed this recipe exactly and had to throw my dinner away. We couldn't eat it. Should have listened to the reviews to cut vinegar in half.

Yummy! I halved the vinegar and cornstarch mix and I had to add about 1/2 a cup of veg broth because the sauce was way too thick.  My husband and I ate it up with a quickness and will definitely make again.  Very pleased, thx for the submission!  Next time I will add a couple of dashes of fish sauce to make it perfect.

I had to add some sugar, as the rice vinegar was overpowering. Next time I will use half as much of it.

This recipe is simple and it really could be made with any fresh vegetables and meat. I thought the sauce ended up just a bit tangy, so next time I would add a little bit of something sweet like sugar or even honey to it.

I used half the vinegar like everyone else had posted. And the only thing else different that I did from the recipe is add Siracha oil instead of the peanut oil. It was perfectly spicy.

Read the reviews before you make it! Way to much vinegar I'm going to sprinkle sugar on mine to combat the vinegar. Awe, it did the trick!

This was very good and I will make it again.  Like many others, I reduced the vinegar and also used only 1/2 the chili paste as I don't like things overly spicy.  I did not add additional peanut butter and felt there was plenty.  Agree that the cornstarch is not necessary as the peanut butter thickens the sauce on it's on.

Delicious peanuty-thai flavour!  I just used what I had in the fridge - beef, peppers, garlic, onion, cabbage, and carrots.  I also used vegetable oil instead of peanut oil, apple cider vinegar instead of rice vinegar, and Frank's red hot instead of Sriracha since I didn't have those ingredients.  I also used a bit extra peanut butter because that's my favourite part.  It turned out delicious, not too vinegary, but I think I could've made it even spicier by adding a chopped jalopeno pepper and it would've been perfect.

My whole family really liked this one! I substituted the vegetables listed here for fresh oyster mushrooms 1/2 a sliced onion. I also added about 1/2 tlb sugar to the sauce. I liked the peanutty sweet, sour heat it added.

This was well received at my table.  Took the reviews to heart and reduced the vinegar by half, reduced the cornstarch.  Can't imagine if it had had full vinegar.  Will make this again.

I'm with everyone else -there was too much vinegar and I will reduce it next time.  I also used coconut oil (didn't have peanut) and zucchini instead of bell pepper.  It was still very good despite too much vinegar, and I will make it again.

Thanks for the recipe. The blend of flavors in the sauce was perfect for my tastes. It's an easy recipe to adjust what veggies you use to accommodate what you have on hand.

I really liked this sauce! I only used olive oil (that's all I had). I followed it pretty loosely, but it helped me to get the proportions right for the ingredients I had on hand. Thanks.

Turned out very well!  Doubled sauce(cut vinegar in half) and served over basmati rice.  I did change up veggies a little- left out bell peppers and mushrooms, julienned carrots.  Added cauliflower and sliced anaheim pepper.  Seasoned beef with garlic powder and ground black pepper while cooking.

very good-I always adapt a bit to what I have in the fridge-used cauliflower, arrowroot instead of broccoli, cornstarch. Yum!
