I made this recipe for Thanksgiving for my family of 15, it was very easy to make and smelled delicious, however, the final product got poor reviews, very bland compared to everything else on the table.  Sorry, but it was a unanimous vote not to make this again.

This was a very good recipe.  I tried making it a few times a couple different ways and the best way is as follows.  First cook the oil, sugar, and onion on LOW heat.  Get it started on med-high, but once the onions start sizzling turn it down to low and stir every once in a while.  Second I added a splash of balsamic vinegar (maybe a teaspoon at most).  Third I cooked the beans in the microwave first, then threw them in the onion mix and cooked for an additional 5 minutes or so.  Hope this helps!

I made this instead of the traditional green bean casserrole on Thanksgiving.  They were pretty good, but not terrific.

It was really really hard for me to not throw some garlic in as I was cooking, but I stayed true to the recipe and it is an excellent side dish.  A nice change of pace from my usual garlic & EVOO roasted green beans. Def worth trying!  TY!

I absolutely love this recipe and have made it many times, especially for parties.  I use 2 or 3 sliced fresh onions in place of the frozen pearl onions and whole frozen green beans in place of the cut ones, and it looks beautiful.  I carmelize the onions with the oil and sugar for about 10 - 15 minutes on low heat (check every couple minutes and give it a stir), then add the green beans until it stops "smoking" (from the ice) and is heated through.  After I take it off, I add the fresh dill (I made it once with dried dill weed and it was awful), salt and pepper.  It has a beautiful presentation, tastes great, and is easy to put together.  Thanks!

i really like the concept of this dish.  it may have been my fault, but the sugar and olive oil turned brown pretty quickly and made it taste a little "burnt".  i cooked on med-high heat as instructed, but i think next time i'll cook on lower temp.  i don't think sugar can handle being sauteed for 10 mins.

I've made this recipe several times, and even without the dill weed (I forgot it the first time until after I had emptied the skillet), it got rave reviews. I think I added a little freshly ground black pepper at the end. I also put the green beans in at the end until they are just heated and very bright green. This keeps them still a bit crunchy, which my husband and our guy friends like.

I usually will cook a bit of bacon first, and sautee the pearl onions in the bacon drippings with a Tb of sugar. then add the greenbeans and crumbled bacon.  This is very tasty.

I thought this was "just okay".  It was missing a little zip or pizzazz, probably a spice I can't put my name to at the moment.

Very very good! I love the slight sweetness. So much better than plain salt and pepper. I've also tried this with fresh snap peas. Thanks!

My daughter brought this for Thanksgiving.  Delicious.  She didn't have dill weed so didn't use it.  Used fresh pearl onions.  Cooked great beans longer than 3 min. Will make again next year.

So. Low-med heat for the onions. Sauté for a good 8 mins till they start to brown. Use fresh onions and green beans. Add green beans, stir and Sauté for 15 mins, depending on how soft you want the beans. Add butter, salt, pepper and dill while still on heat. And stir for a good 5 mins to let the flavors settle.

Loved this.  I cooked this way down and added some Parmesan cheese.  I'm sure it's fabulous without it, too!

I thought this recipe was wonderful!  My only change was not to cook the green beans quite as long initially, leaving them tender-crisp.  Never thought of carmelizing pearl onions, but they add such a great flavor to this dish, as does the dill.  Will be making this again & again.  Thank you for a great recipe!

It was excellent and was the first empty bowl at Thanksgiving dinner.  The only thing I did differntly was used fresh beans and fresh pearl onions.  My pearl onions were large, so I cut them in half.  Will make this again!
