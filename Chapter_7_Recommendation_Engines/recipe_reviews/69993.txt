This recipe was awesome!  I doubled the amount of sauce and just used a mayan onion I had in the house.  I cooked the scallops write in the pan with the sauce, then added linguine, a package of baby spinache, and feta cheese.  I covered it for a few minutes to wilt down the spinache, added a little crushed red pepper, gave it a toss, and it was to die for!  My husband says best thing I've ever made, so will definitely make it again.  Thanks so much!

This was very good and I suspect not only for scallops but for any seafood.    I doubled the sauce and will use it again.  Very happy with the amount of tartness for the sauce.  Did not have any shallots on hand and it was too  cold to go get one, so I used red onion and some extra garlic instead.  Well done recipe.  I used some blackening seasoning on the scallops with some garlic pepper and pan seared mine in a bit of olive oil and butter. This will be made again in my home w/o question.

This sauce was totally delectable.  I literally licked the pan when done!  I used Chardonnay wine and added an extra garlic glove to the sauce.  My scallops were huge, so I had to broil them about 4 minutes per side.  I served them alongside crabcakes, green beans and a cucumber and tomato salad tossed with olive oil and red wine vinegar.  Awesome dinner!

excellent recipe!  i read through the other reviews before trying it, and found good advice re:  doubling the sauce, cooking the scallops in the skillet with the sauce, and reducing the white wine before adding the other ingredients.  i used a very dry white Italian table wine which gave the sauce a lovely, subtle, piquant flavour.

Thanx to the many great reviews/suggestions, mine came out perfect.  I doubled the recipe, I used onion instead of shallots, I used Chardonnay (reducing it first before adding the rest of the ingredients), and did not broil the scallops - I cooked them in the sauce.  PERFECT!  It was very very good.  Served with angel hair pasta.

I just started cooking and I tried this on Valentine's day of 2006 and it was the biggest hit I've had so far. Since then I make it every couple weeks. It is our favorite way to make scallops and you won't find a better sauce in any restaurant. Plus, I use the sauce for other fish recipes too. If you're conscious of calories and fat- Once, I accidentally forgot to add the butter and it was still great. I use margarine anyway. Haven't tried it with real butter yet but I bet it's even better!! You have to try this!

This is a great recipe.  My wife and I were looking for a new way to prepare some scallops we purchased, and this worked great.  Not too rich, but flavorful enough to spark us to add it to our regular rotation.  We served them over a bed of angel hair pasta, and with a fresh mixed greens salad w/ balsamic vinagrette.  A great combination.  Thanks!

We enjoyed this, but for me it was just too much wine, overpowering.  Next time I will adjust this more to our taste, more butter, less wine, more shallots.  Thanks for the great idea!

This was excellent. We made if for our New Year's Eve dinner and weren't disappointed. We ate it over fettucine noodles. Thanks so much for the excellent recipe!

This was a very good recipe after making alterations per others' reviews--sear scallops in the pan, remove, build the sauce (reduce wine first, then add other ingredients), then throw the scallops back in to finish.  Nice, fast dish.  I served it with shrimp risotto, but I think doubling the sauce and using pasta would be great.

I was looking for a great light sauce to mix with pasta and this recipe was great!  I just used the sauce recipe, but am going to try it with scallops next time!

EXCELLENT RECIPE! Altho I did not use the broiler, it is just too hot here in Tucson. I doubled the sauce, used a high-quality dry chardonnay, added MUCH more minced garlic, added the butter immediately, but no olive oil and simmered it for about 5 minutes...THEN put my giant scallops right into the large iron skillet! They took about 3 minutes per side to gently poach them. I served them with pasta, placing the scallops on top with a sprig of parsley and poured the sauce on top. It was delicious with a very delicate wine flavor, as I simmered it long enough for the alcohol to dissipate. I also used my own roasted chicken broth flavored with only onion and garlic (no carrots, celery, etc.) I would use this sauce with shrimp too, but take my advice and have some crusty toasted bread on hand to get every delicious drop in your mouth or you will be literally licking the plate! Thanks to Debi for the great recipe, this is my go-to sauce for scallops and shrimp when I can wrangle them away from my husband and his grill! Also, freshly ground black pepper and freshly ground sea salt were added at table rather than in the sauce, as the salt tends to toughen delicate seafood cooked in sauces. You could also provide a lemon-quarter on the plate.

It was ok.  Not great...not bad...just ok.  I did this recipe twice...once using small scallops and once using big scallops...USE THE BIG SCALLOPS.  It is much better and I used a Riesling originally but use a Chardonnay it has a better flavor.  There was wayyyy too much "lemon" taste so I would really suggest using less.  That's it.

My favorite way to make scallops. I do step 2 of the recipe, cook the scallops in the sauce, put them aside. Add spinach and cooked pasta, toss. Serve with scallops on top! Love it!

I simmered the scallops in the sauce. It is fantastic! Make sure you check your scallops. Sometimes the scallops come with a little flap on the side that needs to be taken off before you start cooking. It is the piece that connected the scallop to the shell and it tastes really bitter if you bite into it. If you had a bad tasting scallop- give it another shot. This could be the reason and it is easy to fix!! The flap just tears right off!

I doubled the sauce recipe like others had recommended and then added a half a can of clams plus fresh raw shrimp and cook that in there. I seared the scallops in a hot pan separately and topped my angel hair pasta and sauce with the scallops!! It was to die for, definitely going to make it again!

While on vacation in Washington..we wanted to make our favorite McCormick and Schmicks garlic scallops...but we didn't feel like buying all the ingredients. So, we looked up this one and had everything we needed. We doubled the recipe for everything except the lemon and the butter. We stuck with the normal amount of lemon and used about 2/3 of a stick of butter. It came out perfect. We went through a whole loaf of crusty rosemary bread in the process. We had plain old steamed green beans with it, which worked out perfect as well. This recipe is terrific. It's got the perfect amount of richness and the nice tang from the lemon. We got 14 good sized scallops and wished we had more. This is a perfect holiday meal. We may make this again X-mas eve as we always have seafood that night. Really easy to make..the most time consuming part is chopping the garlic and shallots. Oh...we did use about 4 cloves of garlic..so we put in 4x the amount of that...and more wouldn't have hurt...heck..more shallots  or even some chipolini onions wouldnt hurt either. World class recipe here...restaurant quality.

We double the sauce, then use it over angel hair pasta with salmon. I saute the salmon with lemon pepper, then flake it onto the pasta. I also add sauted sliced mushrooms and halved grape tomatoes. Wonderful, simple sauce, thank you!

Excellent recipe.  I doubled the sauce except for the lemon.  I did not want it to overpower the dish.  Served with angel hair pasta and baked asparagus.

These scallops are incredible!  My son asked for scallops as part of his birthday dinner, so I gave this recipe a try.  I had a pound and a half of scallops so doubled the recipe.  Like others suggested, I cooked the scallops in the sauce.  We had several family members over for dinner, and they all went a little nuts over the scallops.  It was a good thing we had bread for mopping up the sauce or people would have been licking their plates.  This is something I will certainly make again.

This recipe is definitely good, but very, very lemony.  I doubled it and actually thickened it with a bit of cornstarch in the end, then served over basmati.  I would definitely make this again, just with half the amount of lemon suggested.

Excellent recipe!  I usually double the ingredients of the sauce.  The broiling time may not be enough due to the size of the scallops.  I broil them for the time indicated, then drop them into the sauce as it simmers to finish cooking the scallops.  They tend to absorb some of the sauce as they simmer!

I thought this recipe was good but would be best served over pasta and by doubling the sauce. I have had better scallop dishes but this was good. I would personally add some extra garlic to it as well.

Great recipe! I also double the sauce as many reviewers have suggested plus I add fresh parsley & crushed red pepper. I have served over whole wheat angel hair as well as long grain brown rice & prefer the rice since it absorbs more of this great sauce! This sauce has become a staple & works well with any type of seafood.

The flavor of this sauce was really good, and probably would've been perfect had I just served it over scallops as was intended. However, I tried doubling the recipe and serving over pasta as well, as some suggested, and was not pleased. Too thin as a pasta sauce, I think, but great on scallops!

One of my new fave recipes. I added crushed red pepper, doubled the sauce and actually cooked the scallops in the sauce, removed them, then finished the pasta in the sauce.  Husband loved it!

This was fantastic! Just delicious. I made it the second time "lite" substituting a lower-calorie butter spread called "Balade" (get it at Trader Joe's)and using fat free half-n-half (also at TJoe's.) It was still delicious and far fewer calories. Though if I was serving it to guests (and I will) I'd make it the full-calorie version.

I am sure it is amazing as posted, though I followed other reviewers by doubling the sauce ingredients and by reducing the Chardonnay alone before adding other sauce components.  I also had on hand fresh sliced mushrooms that I added to the sauce. The reduction took a little longer due to the liquid from the mushrooms but it was worth it in the end.  I chose to pan sear the sea scallops 2 minutes per side, removing then returning them back to sauce immediately after adding the butter to complete their cooking. I let them stand about 5 minutes before serving over pasta with mini baguettes and roasted asparagus. LOVE THIS RECIPE * THANKS FOR SHARING!!

LOVED the sauce, I was licking the plate afterward.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone and will try the sauce with other types of seafood.

Delicious! My only comment is that I had to broil the scallops a bit longer to get them slightly browned, maybe 3-4 minutes on each side. I served it with asparagus and fettuccine, and just poured the sauce all over everything. It was perfect!

This sauce is DIVINE!  Quite zesty with the lemon.  I doubled the sauce for one lb of scallops, thank goodness, or we would not have had enough.  I also used a 50/50 percentage of wine to broth for more intense flavor.  Have made it twice and family loves it!

Fantastic! I also doubled the sauce (better to have too much) and used chardonnay but only used 1/2 the butter called for and it was plenty.  I used cod, shrimp, and scallops brushed lightly with olive oil, then lightly seasoned with salt, pepper, and old bay.  Definitely a great sauce for any whitefish and shellfish.  Will be making again soon!  Served this with baked potato and steamed vegetable medley, but will try it with pasta next time.

OMG!  This was delicious.  I wanted to make a surf and turf dinner so I decided to try this recipe and I was not disappointed.  My husband loved it also.  I followed the recipe to a "T".  Next time I may add some additional ingredients, but it is fantastic as is.

I used a savignon blanc for this recipe, and it turned out great. My husband raved about how tender the scallops were! I used frozen raw scallops from Costco, and let them defrost. They were delicious. I will use this recipe again.

Really good.  After scallops cook in the oven, add the juices left in the baking sheet to the sauce for added flavor.

These were an absolute hit at my party. I'm giving it a four because I added romano cheese over the top with breadcrumbs, and the flavour of the cheese really combined well with the sauce. I also used this recipe over haddock, and it was delicious as well.

A good dish. I made with shrimp and scallops. I had dredged them in bread crumbs and pan seared them. The shrimp tasted better with this dish! Next time, I will use only shrimp!

It was too lemony for my taste. Next time I'd cut the lemon juice by half and maybe add a bit more wine. Otherwise it was a nice sauce.

This is a  easy, Wonderful sauce! I substituted fresh lime juice for the lemon, which makes it more tangy.  Also sweet onions work in place of the scallions.  This is a keeper.

Excellent! I didn't have wine, so used more chix broth instead. Same with scallions, so more garlic. I thought the sauce could still have been just as delicious with less butter.  Served on veggie pasta. YUM.

Delicious sauce!!! I used a White Zin so my shallots came out pink and the sauce had a nice sweet touch which complimented the scallops well! I doubled this recipe because I had double the scallops, but ended up with a lot of leftover sauce. I didn't make rice or pasta, so it definitely would have been better if I could have had something to soak up that delicious sauce so it didn't go to waste! Delicious recipe! :-)

This was my first time cooking scallops and this dish turned out great!  Love the rich yet light buttery sauce - served over linguine with a side of green beans - perfect dinner!  I did double the sauce and used 1.5 pounds of scallops and thought that was a good ratio.  Will definitely make this again - simple yet elegant!

Followed exactly...overwhelmed by butter taste.  I didn't like it at all.  Maybe it was my lack of cooking skills but I followed everything exactly...the taste was just completely off for me.  I used fresh scallops bought at the deli and I served it with white rice.

I actually was just looking for a good sauce base I could use for various dishes.  I haven't even tried this with scallops yet but it sounds delish!!!!  I also just used an onion and doubled the ingredients.  Quick and yummy!  I served with chicken and pasta.

This was amazing!  My family ate every last bit.  I had to double the recipe the second time I made it.  I made more wine sauce and added brocolli crowns and put it on top of linguine with some parmesan cheese.  Is a new favorite in my household!

Light and delicious.  We used bay scallops instead of sea scallops and broiled for 1.5 minutes on each side. We served them on a bed of baby lettuce and added freshly shredded parmesan cheese on top.

Five stars for the wine sauce ..totally delicious.  I didn't broil my scallops I did bake them with a crumb topping (recipe from this site "awesome baked sea scallops")but this sauce intrigued me so I used it and followed the baking and crumb directions from the other recipe.  Very delicious combo.  Will keep this sauce in the recipe bank!

Love it!  Really really good.  Reduce the wine first before adding the rest of the ingredients, then further reduce.  Other than that, and omitting the shallots I followed the recipe to a tee. YUM!  I'm sure this would taste great with fish too.

Loved this sauce, light and perfect with angel hair pasta.  I did use less butter and I pan seared the scallops.  Will use again for seafood and pasta.

I liked it but my husband thought it lacked in taste.  The one thing I wanted to note was the first picture shown for this recipe.  It must not have been this recipe (or incredibly altered) because it looked nothing like it.  I did like that it wasn't a heavy sauce.  I would make again for myself and my husband can eat spaghettios.

we loved this.. maybe because we tend to love strong foods with acidic components.. used the recipe only for the sauce to go with some salmon and pasta.. doubled the sauce recipe but halved the butter.. substituted caramelized onion for the shallots and thickened up the sauce with some cornstarch.. ty so much for this recipe.. UPDATE: this was absolutely amazing with scallops!  we doubled the sauce like we did the first time and added some cauliflower and mushrooms that we cooked in the sauce.. served with thin spaghetti.. didn't add the cornstarch this time and enjoyed it.. so delicious

I have never given a bad review, but this recipe called for way too much lemon.  Made it exactly according to instructions, and all I could taste was lemon.  Scrapped that sauce, made it again with 1/2 the lemon it calls for and was still to acidic.  Going back to my usual white wine sauce.

Amazing recipe but I did make a few changes. I added capers to the sauce and added less lemon because I ran out. I also sautéed the scallops since I was using my oven for the stuffed mushrooms I made from this site. I made this for a NYE dinner, and my boyfriend said it was his favorite dish I've made yet. Thanks for another amazing recipe

Fantastic Recipe!  I read the reviews before I started and I too cooked the scallops in the wine, chicken broth,scallions and garlic.  I added a stick of butter and 2 8oz containers of Marscapone Cheese!  Delicious-creamy with fantastic flavor.  Served over fettucine with parmesean.  White wine chilled to perfection and brownies for dessert.  This is a keeper.

I would rate this a 5 but I changed it somewhatl WhatI made was delicious.  I tripled the sauce when making dinner for my husband only.  I added juice of 1/2 lemon and it was tart.  Next time will eliminate the lemon.  I cooked the scallops in the sauce before cooking the sauce down.  I then took out scallops, added the butter and cooked til somewhat thick.  I used regular onions and cut up some tomatoes to put on top as well as cheese.

Excellent! One of our favorite meals now. I did not use chicken broth (why do you need chicken flavor with seafood) and seasoned the scallops with Old Bay ; otherwise, I followed the recipe closely.

Love, love, love this recipe. I used salmon instead of scallops and added a can of chopped clams to the sauce. I also pan seared the salmon first before adding it back to the sauce to simmer.  Once the salmon was done I flaked it and served it over linguine.  For those concerned about  the intensity of the lemon, add half the amount and adjust at the end of the cooking process if needed.  I also added a little dill to enhance the flavor.

I just made this for dinner, but used shrimp instead of scallops since that was what I had on hand. I also left out the lemon juice since I didn't have any in the house. I served it over rotini and it was absolutely delicious! Next time I might add more garlic just because I LOVE garlic!

I gotta say, that was kinda bland for me. I was surprised given all the rave reviews. I followed the recipe exactly except that I doubled the sauce like people suggested, then pan seared the scallops before cooking them in the sauce. Maybe I didn't reduce it enough, but it just didn't have a lot of flavor for me. I'll try it again, though.

I used shrimp, rather than scallops, which worked well.  I did  add a little Old Bay to the shrimp and cooked them right in the sauce.  Served over bow tie pasta.  This was good and hubby liked it, but I thought it was lacking some pizzazz.

I loved adding the Spinach to the sauce, which I also reduced. I omitted the butter and added a bit more Chicken Broth ad used Olive Oil which is healthier. It was wonderful!!

This was excellent! Made double the sauce and used a heaping T of shallots and 4 cloves of garlic. Instead of scallops I put a pound of lobster meat in to the pan of sauce for about 5 minutes. I'm tucking this one away as a recipe for company!

Delicious, but if you cook the scallops in the sauce you end up with the garlic being on the burner too long and getting burnt. Next time I'll wait to add the garlic till closer to the end.

i followed some reviews and added a few more changes. doubled the sauce ingredients, but minced one whole shallot and kept the butter the same (1/4 cup). used chicken bouillon cube and 1 cup of water as a sub for the broth. also cooked the scallops right in the liquid. so easy. sprinkled with a tablespoon of parmesean and then flipped them and sprinkled with another tablespoon of parmesean.  threw in a half a bunch of fresh chopped parsley for the last two minutes and served with pasta!  had to get bread to soak up the rest of the sauce because it was sooo good!  thanks!

We just had this for dinner tonight. Like other reviewers, I also made more sauce for pasta. Maybe I put in too much lemon juice. My sauce came out to be very tart. I needed to add sugar to balance it off. Next time, I will try to use clam juice instead of chicken broth to make it more flavorful.

As it was Good Friday last week, I decided to be brave and try to make scallops myself instead of buying something from a restaurant. This recipe looked good and I made a few modifications to it. I added sliced portabella mushrooms, and used a red onion instead (as my store didn't have the proper onions called for in the recipe). I also took someone else's advice and cooked the scallops in the pan with the sauce and put it over linguine. Well although the recipe looked and smelled great, it was way too sweet for me. And I used a dry chardonnay for my wine. Don't think that I will use this again. But if you like sweet, this recipe might be for you.

This got rave reviews from my boyfriend. I made it as part of a meal for his birthday this weekend, and since I was only cooking for two I halved the amount of scallops - same as doubling the sauce.
I thought the sauce was a bit tart, so I'll use less garlic and a bit more green onion next time (my substitution for shallots). I used a sauvignon blanc because it was on hand. Will also not totally double the sauce since there was so much left. I had no problem sauteeing the scallops in sauce instead of baking. I served it over linguini with parsley flakes and pepper.
Quite delicious, and we're both looking forward to the next time I make it.

This recipe is absolutely delish! I added a few things that took it over the top. I used large scallops, not the teeny bay kind. I also doubled the sauce & added a whole bag of fresh spinach and some sliced mushrooms then served it all over fettuccine. AWESOME!

The sauce is wonderful!!!  Quick and easy to make.  To really dress up the dish, I used large bay scallops.  I then seared them with a blackening seasonong, in a pan rather than putting them in the oven.  I served over a bed of spinach linguine and it was a restaurant quality dish for sure!  Will make again and try with some other types of seafood and variations.

Very easy to make, so easy that you can't go wrong... (plus anything with this much butter tastes good!)  Have it with dinner rolls to sop up the extra sauce.

this recipe was great, I decrease the wine and seared the scallops in butter first before the broiler then deglazed the pan and added this to the sauce. My husband is not a gravey/sauce man but did enjoy this.

This is a really good recipe. I have never made scallops but I made them better than a good resturant....so thats what they tell me. I put them in the oven for about 2-3 min and then added 1lb of raw shrimp and put it all back in the oven for about 4-5 min. it was perfect! the butter sauce was really good. I actually might have put more butter on....i like it greasy and tasty..mmmmm  butter...!!!!

My husband was so impressed! My very first time making scallops - I got frozen/defrosted because that's all the grocery store had and it was still perfect. We did 4min 45 seconds total but the scallops were a bit on the large side.  Wouldn't change a thing except next time I will go easier on the pepper (they really just don't need it).

WOW!  This was easy and just incredible!  The wine really makes the flavor pop.  I only had cooking sherry and that came out great. Also I used onion instead of shallots.  I added cooked pasta to the pot and mixed everything together.  Awesome and much more filling.  My only suggestion is to make a lot extra.  I made enough for 2 meals, but my family downed it all in ONE!

I thought this was good but not great.  The sauce didn't give the scallops that much flavor.  However I would take this any day over a sauce that overpowers the taste of the scallops.  I will try making this again though and marinating them in the sauce first.  I think that might help.

I don't care for scallops but the eight other people in our vacation home went wild over this. After broiling, I poured the sauce into the same pan and baked for another two minutes. I used sea scallops for this recipe which worked out nicely. Thanks Debi!

Exceptional! So good my husband drank the extra sauce. I used two lbs. of bay scallops and doubled the recipe. Used some left over asti spumoni instead of white wine. This gave the dish a nice contrast of sweet and sour. Next time I'll make more sauce and serve over pasta.

I pan fried the scallops in oil with salt and pepper, then added the wine sauce to the pan and simmered for a few minutes.  Delicious.

We really enjoy this easy dinner. We double the sauce and cook shellfish (have used scallops and shrimp) right in the sauce. Then we toss linguine or angel hair with it.

It was easy fast and really tasty. I had to use cooking wine, good wine would have made it even better. I’d also do more than one half lemon. I didn’t have shallots, used red onion. With all my “next times” it was still great!

I subbed low sodium veggie broth for the chicken broth. I also pan seared the scallops rather than using the oven. I spray the pan with olive oil, then brush the scallops with olive oil & add a few shakes of salt & pepper. I sear for 2 mins at medium high heat, then flip them & brush with oil again & salt & pepper. After another 2 mins., they're done. I then added them to the broth, which I had kept on the back burner at low heat.

I doubled the recipe and only had little bay scallops so I cooked them in the sauce instead of under the broiler. I cooked some fettuccine and added it to the pan for a few minutes before I served it. Delicious. I would make this again and again.

Delicious, easy, and mostly on hand once we had the scallops. I substituted sweet onion for scallions, and as I had 2 lbs of scallops I made the sauce x 4 as suggested by others.  Found the sauce a little too strong with lemon, fixed the problem by adding 1/4 teaspoon baking soda/cup of sauce to tone it down to taste... will use add less lemon next time.  Very large scallops took a couple extra minutes to cook through.  Great recipe, Thank You!!

If I could give more stars, I would!  Only changes, used a whole bulb of garlic, fresh chopped chives and beef stock since that’s all I had on hand. Doubled the recipe and threw in a pound of shrimp as well.  Cooked seafood right in the pan. Served over spaghetti noodles. Happy family. Beautiful!

4.1.18  I used a chardonnay for the white wine, but all I could taste in the sauce was the lemon.  If I make this again, I think I’d try using sherry instead of the white wine. If you’re planning to serve this over pasta like I did, by all means double the sauce.  By the time most of the liquid has reduced and thickened, you just don’t have much sauce.  Broiling works O.K., but searing the scallops in a screaming hot skillet so you get that brown crust gives them a lot more eye appeal.  It was a quick and easy dish, and tasted O.K., but  still a bit of a disappointment  considering how much I paid for the sea scallops.  Just didn’t measure up to my expectations.

This recipe is great! I changed it up a little by adding jalapeños into the garlic and onions. Be careful because it adds heat to  the dish. Taste before you're done and if it's too spicy, add chicken stock and reduce until the heat is just right. I also added asparagus to the sauce and covered for a few minutes at the end of the recipe. Keep an eye on your scallops when broiling because I had to turn them again after 4 minutes and broil another 2 minutes per side. Add the scallops when done to your sauce and toss to coat. Serve over linguine and top with parmesan cheese and parsley. Enjoy!

I made the scallops just like directed with one exception. I added chopped ginger to the sauce for additional flavor. The scallops had to cook 2 minutes longer, but they tasted delicious.

I think I would cook the scallops a little longer than I did, 3 minutes just wasn't long enough for me.  The flavor was amazing though.

As recommended by another cook, I doubled the liquid ingredients, and added fresh spinach to the reduced liquid to wilt it.  I also sauteed fresh, sliced button mushrooms in olive oil separately, and added the remainder of the can of chicken broth to simmer them. This was tossed with the sauce and spinach, and topped with the scallops.   One comment, I thought the sauce was a little tart, but my picky husband loved it.  Very elegant dish.  You want to buy "dry" fresh scallops.

I don't think that I cooked down the liquid long enough. It was very thin liquid and not flavorful. I think that the scallops would be better seasoned and cooked on their own and just topping the scallops with the sauce.  The scallops were bland that way.  To each's own I guess.

This was such an excellent recipe!  It was SO easy and SO delicious !  I did add 2 extra minutes of broiling time and I also recommend using a baking sheet with "sides".  It gets juicy as the scallops broil.  I will make this again and again.

I like to use alot of recipes as a starting point. I made some changes to the original recipe. Guess I made my own recipe in the end. :-)
I heated a little olive oil in the frypan,  added crushed garlic and chopped onions. Cooked them until slightly cooked. Deglazed with some white wine, I used Chenin Blanc just because that's what I had open. 
I added the chicken broth and lemon juice (from a bottle).
Let that reduce to about half. And because I like cream, I added cream,  basil and oregano.
I added the butter just before serving it over Tortillini.
Husband, who is a chef, raved about it.
I at least doubled this to cover the Tortillini.
I would recommend either version as it is easy and fast for a weeknight dinner

I used shrimp instead of Scallops and served it over spaghetti. ... turned out fine. I cut the extra large shrimp in half (length wise)... I like the texture of the shrimp that way... they tend to curl a bit when cut length wise. I doubled the recipe. It made about 1 cup of sauce. It has a nice mild flavor you could enhance with different herbs. Using  stingy portions of sauce, it fed 4.  I will probably make a  quadruple batch next time as I like a bit more sauce. I also put some peas and sautéed mushrooms on the plate just before I served. It was pretty good.

I didn't stray from the original and doubt that I would make any changes when I make this again. Served with pasta and steamed spinach. The sauce complimented the pasta and spinach nicely. Might even make the sauce just to eat it on pasta sometime. Very good!

Phenomenal!  Used jumbo scallops, started in the broiler to lightly brown for two min ea side, finished in the doubled, reduced sauce to get darker brown same length of time! Served over steamed broccoli, spinach sautéed with al dente broken angel hair noodles sautéed in butter and mashed garlic and added to the reduced sauce. Yummmmmm!

Went easy on the lemon, but don't forget that a sauce will always taste too strong when you test it by itself. I thought the sauce was overly lemony, despite adding only a tbsp of juice, but it tasted great over pasta and sautéed veg. Nice and light and easy!

I tripled this for Christmas and everyone loved it!  I pan-seared the scallops on the outside and then cooked them in the sauce for a few minutes.I stirred in some angel hair pasta, threw some fresh parsley on top for color, and served it with roasted butternut squash.

This turned out great. I added lemon zest but probably a bit too much. Also used onion instead of shallot but would definitely try with the shallot next time.

Double the sauce to go with pasta.  Also, it needs something... basil?  Tomatoes?

This is one of my new favs! I changed a little-- I use half scallops and half bay shrimp and cook in the pan with the sauce as well as add some spinach and feta cheese at the end. My boyfriend and I love it so much!

Delicious! Though I didn't follow the measurements (just eyeballed everything and kept trying it), I did use the ingredients mentioned. I did this based on what I had available so I used green onion instead of shallots, extra garlic cloves, added red bell peppers, used margarine instead of butter, and thickened with cornstarch. I also used shrimp instead of scallops (which I cooked in the sauce).I then put this on pasta. Very good recipe and will use again, thanks!

This was amazingly tasty! I loved the subtle taste of the wine in the sauce. Scallops were delicious with the sauce. I don't care for butter on my seafood but this sauce was sooo good. I will make again and again this way!

My husband loves scallops and I do not.  I made this for him and subsequently fell in love with scallops.  Fantastic recipe-easy and delicious.  Forgot the lemon juice but didn't seem to take away from the dish.  Will remember it next time.  Thanks for sharing.

Made scallop recipe last week; DELICIOUS!! My husband loved it, even the kids loved it. Doubled the sauce and served over creamy parmesan risotto. This week I made it using shrimp; Cooked shrimp in the pan with sauce. Served over Bow-Tie macaroni m/w peas. Just as good as the scallops! Next time I make the sauce I'm going to try cooking the scallops in the same pan.

This turned out to not be a sauce I was looking for, however, my dad really enjoyed it. I doubled the recipe except for the lemon as most reviewers suggested. Otherwise, I do believe it would have been too tangy. I used this sauce over a seafood casserole of a sole fillet, shrimp and crab with a few small scallops. He really enjoyed it.

I was too lazy to go to the store for a lemon, so I tossed in a small splash of distilled vinegar for acidity. Also, I pan seared the scallops. This dish was great and went over wonderfully with my wife. I always try to cook something nice when we watch Monday cooking shows. I can't wait to do it again with the lemon juice.

I thought this recipe was really tasty.  I doubled the recipe, added oregano and red pepper. I substituted an onion for a shallot.  I fried the scallops and seasoned them with salt, pepper, and a little Old Bay.  My sauce didn't thicken up as I'd hoped even after letting it simmer.  It was still very good though.

A really nice, light sauce. I had it over pasta the first night & it was wonderful. The next day I used my leftover scallops and sauce to make a salad over spinach with some cold penne and mozzarella as additional toppings. Excellent - I will definitely make this again.

Wowee this is a great recipe. SO good with pasta! I substituted the chicken broth for veggie broth and tossed it with angel hair pasta and shrimp (that i sauteed in the sauce.) My husband & i were slurping it out of our bowls by the end of the meal! I think I will try it next time as the base for a pasta primavera.

I add an entire sliced shallot and 6 sliced garlic cloves and half the amount of butter.  4 tbls made the sauce too buttery in my opinion.   Other then that it is delicious!

This was great! The only change I made was to put papkrika on the scallops when broiling and use pam instead of olive oil. This is a very good franchaise-style sauce too.

This is a great light meal.  I followed the recipe but them got a little creative and added a bottle of clam juice to the "broth" mixture.  I served it on ngel hair pasta.  It came out nicely.  I will try it again without the clam juice just to taste the differnce.

I doubled the recipe and serve over angle hair pasta as others suggested. I made this for dinner tonight with a combo of shrimp and scallops, onion instead of shallot, and I used lemon juice (3 tbs from my little yellow plastic lemon) instead of juice from a fresh lemon. This was out of this world! Yes, the wine sauce was thin but the flavor sure wasn't. You just need to be sure you use enough sauce to get the full flavor of it. I am going to make this again only I am going to adjust one more time so I have more sauce. I think 4x would do a lb. of angel hair pasta nicely. I may cut the butter down as some suggested due to diet restrictions. I just hope it doesn't ruin the taste of it as it is perfect just the way it is.

I doubled all of the ingredients except for the butter. I think that the butter could even be reduced further to reduce the fat content without compromising the taste.  I didn't want to open a fresh bottle of wine, so I used champagne instead and added the scallops to the sauce after if was boiling.  Then I poured the sauce and scallops over angel hair pasta and served with steamed asparagus- perfection!!  Oh and I also sprinkled crushed chilies on top for color, parsley would have been nice as well.

The sauce was excellent with few minor changes.  Only thing I modified was the amount of butter and lemon.  I also tripled the sauce and served it with linguini pasta and it was delicious!  Thanks.

Wonderful!  We used merlot in place of white wine and it worked very well. We didn't use shallot or onion and it was still very good. Served the scallops on a bed of macaroni.

This is by far one of the best sauce recipes EVER!  I followed the directions and cooked the scallops (large sea scallops) as it said and it came out perfect.  I have done it with smaller bay scallops as well, if you do that just keep an eye on them so they dont over cook.

My family loved!!!! it! The kids ate scallops and they don't really like them!  We also put the sauce on the broccoli and that was a hit.  Next time I might try a bit less butter, but excellent!!!!

Very good. I used Brummel & Brown, and I think simmered the sauce down a little too much and had less than I think I was supposed to. But it was very, very tasty!

This recipe is very precise. I prepared it last night and i am satisfied with the results.  My husband really enjoyed it; besides it's a good substitute of the meat.
I served it with steamed vegetables and homemade mashed potatoes and white wine as drinks. It was delicious.
Thank you for posting it.

This was good...it didn't make enough sauce for my liking and I only cooked for two so I will cook more next time. I served with angel hair pasta and a veggie. This was the first time that my son tried scallops and he liked them so I will make it again for sure.

This was an easy recipe. I did not have any shallots though. The sauce was not overpowering. I did have to cook the scallops longer than 2 minutes because mine were very large. I will make these again!

Was very good, a little too much lemon for my family's taste (my lemon was average size)but was a quick and easy meal. Nice over pasta.
