OK, Ms Missy...I made a double batch, sticking half in freezer.  First batch disappeared in record time. I was told I was seen sticking extra in freezer but couldn't I go ahead and cook those too?  24 for 6 people was not enough.  Went remarkably well with a big pitcher of lemonade!  Kids and adults raved over them.  BIG keeper!  Thanks Melissa.  Everyone is looking forward to a repeat!

I originally tried and reviewed this recipe before it was published. I will share my review from then. March 5, 2012 -  Awesome! I made these for Super Bowl Sunday this year and they turned out great! I coated twice per the instructions but I still had a slight problem with the cheese oozing out. Make sure you coat the cheese well with the breadcrumbs. Just as good as store bought but I had the satisfaction of making them myself! Thanks Melissa for the inspiration!

I actually made this on a whim after I'd made marinara in the crockpot. What goes better with homemade marinara than fried cheese sticks? I cut this recipe back by half (I didn't want to use 2 1/2 eggs--I went ahead and just used three). I don't normally keep bread crumbs on hand, what I DID have was a couple bags of those Texas Toast croutons (free due to couponing!!!)--I ground them down to crumbs using my food processor. Other than that small change, I kept to the recipe. I did fry them in hot oil in my cast iron skillet. I made sure to watch the sticks and turn them just slightly with my tongs to make sure they browned evenly. Very simple. The boys thought this was the BEST. I swear, they had all of them gone in ten minutes. If that. Great recipe--it may not be an everyday indulgence but every now and then, it's nice to have some cheesy deep fried goodness.

yum! these were crispy and delicious. I only used 6 sticks, which reduced the bread crumbs to 3/4 cup.  If you're trying to save your crumbs, I'd go with 1/2 cup to start with, since I had some left over.  they also crisped up pretty quickly, so keep an eye on them!

These are SOOO GOOD!  I had the pleasure of making them when they were a "personal recipe".  They are a favorite at our house.  My review was as follows:  YUMMY!  Such a nice coating and they froze so well.  I took them out of the hot oil as soon as they browned so as not to burn.  I followed that up with a few seconds in the microwave to be sure they were done inside.  I served them with "Clone of a pretzel dip" and they were so YUMMY!  They made a great addition to our "dippers".  Thank you mis7up for sharing your YUMMY recipe!  I added it to my cookbook and it has definitely found a home at our house.

This would be a perfect low carb recipe if you substitute crushed pork rinds for the bread crumbs.  Tastes great too!

Made a double batch for movie night(10 w/company included).  Fried half in Canola Oil, bqaked half accoding to directions on store bought box.  Served with marinara & pizza sauce.  Everything gone.  Oven just as good, sprayed them with Pam first to assure crispy.  This isn't a staple, it's a treat just like strawberry shaorcake.  Thank you mis7up.

This is a very good recipe. For those that are health conscious or are avoid fried foods. Prepare the cheese in the same manner but wrap with a wonton wrapper, brush with egg white wash and place in oven at 400 for about 10 min. Keep an eye on them so they don't over brown or explode. Very good and kid friendly.

These sound yummy.  We love cheese sticks but don't usually order them out because they have gotten so expensive, this would be a great way to have them on occasion.  Thanks for sharing, can't wait to try them.

These are good......yet I did try panko and put them in the oven and they came out cripy and also melted just as well. Also instead of using whole eggs I used egg substitute.

With permission from Mis7up, I'm reviewing this recipe even though I used panko crumbs instead of bread crumbs. I normally steer from rating recipes I've made significant changes in; however I did let the cook know ahead of time. We simply prefer panko over Italiain bread crumbs and use them in every dish bread crumbs are called for.  With that exception, I followed the recipe to a T and these turned out FANTASTIC. The freezing step is key- my batter hung on beautifully and fried up perfectly.  The Italian bread crumbs have seasoning in them which the panko does not so if you use panko, consider adding some seasonings for punch. Either way, these are amazing. Thanks, Mis7up!

This is an excellent recipe and in fact, we made the exact same one in my culinary class a few weeks ago and got rave reviews from our customers.  I agree with all the reviews here.  This is a high fat and gluten-loaded recipe though.  Eat with extreme caution!  This can be curbed to a low fat/gluten recipe using gluten free cheese and breading and still be consumed in MODERATION with no dire consequences.  This is definitely not something you would want to eat all the time.  I love eating cheese sticks, but I am on a major weight loss diet, and are minus 65 pounds in four months and counting and I am under a strict dietary regime that I have put myself under to achieve my goal of around 170-175lbs. on a frame of 5'11" to achieve a healthy BMI and good overall health in general.  I may try this in my home when my boyfriend's son is over for his weekend visits in the future as a treat but using gluten free cheese and flour.  I am also lactose myself so I try to stay away from as much dairy as possible as my boyfriend and his son is not.  But that is just me.  This is most definitely a treat and again, to be consumed in MODERATION.  Excellent recipe though and definitely a crowd pleasure!  Thank you for sharing, mis7up!  This recipe is going to make it my cookbook with a few minor adjustments.  :))

Subbed corn crumbs because I was out of breadcrumbs, but otherwise followed recipe exactly. Dip, coat, rest, dip, coat, freeze. The resting time is crucial, do not skip it. After freezing, I heated about 2 cups oil in a medium pan. It just missed covering the tops of the sticks. I turned them about 2 times each, and when the cheese was just beginning to ooze out (about 2-3 minutes), pulled them out and served right away. The cheese was just gooey, the crust stayed on tight and was really crispy, they behaved like good restaurant cheese sticks. The corn coating wasn't a perfect fit, flavor-wise, but the recipe is spot-on perfection. Used Exquisite Pizza Sauce from Allrecipes for dipping sauce. Thanks for a winner!

Great recipe & simple to make!  I double-coated and then froze them earlier in the day.  When ready to cook them I only had to heat the oil in the fryer and they were ready in no time--about 2-3 minutes.  I did add Lawry's Seasoned Salt to the bread crumbs to insure a good, rich flavor in the breading.  Served them alongside 'Exquisite Pizza Sauce' from this site.  The whole family gobbled them up.  I am glad that I thought ahead and made extra which are now waiting for me in the freezer for next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

The recipe is simple and is easy to make but I had two problems with this one even though I followed it exactly. Firstly the cheese used is string cheese which in my mind is quite a chewy cheese, I used mozzarella string cheese and secondly the sticks, cooking at five minutes in deep oil at 350 is too long, I lifted them out after some cheese started oozing out of the coating in just 2 minutes even though I had previously frozen them for 2 hours, but this was not a major problem just that they were quite chewy and not tasty enough and no body had more than one stick. I prefer the store bought frozen varieties to satisfy our taste buds.

These were delicious!  The cheese stayed inside, mostly, and the breading was wonderful.  Made some, froze some for next time.  I'll be making this again for some house guests in a few days.  Love it!

Perfect cheese sticks. My family loves them real crispy and the cheese really stringy so I cooked the a little longer and they exploded, I tried the recipe again as written but coated them a third time and they we PERFECT!  No explosion.  Have request for them the all the time now. Definitely a keeper recipe.

Make sure you get the oil temp right, and fry only one the first time around.

These were WONDERFUL! I did add a few more spices to by bread crumbs just based on personal preference(salt, garlic powder, gen season blend, and a bit of parm cheese). I was confused if I was supposed to cut them in half to make them shorter or to make them thinner...so I cut to make them thinner, was the perfect ratio of cheese to breading! They were all gone in record time, the kids couldn't get enough...glad I made 48 sticks!!

Love the idea of freezing them.  It is an essential step!  However, even with the seasoned bread crumbs, I felt the coating was a little bland.  I may need to add some garlic powder and other spices to the breadcrumbs next time I make them.  And I will make them again!

Super yummy as written, but I can't help but laugh while reading some of the reviews complaining about fat content. it is fried cheese after all.

Very easy and good! Prep time was way longer than the 20 minutes it says but so worth it. Only change we made was only deep frying them for about 1 - 1 1/2 min. instead and that was plenty. Any longer and the breading was coming off.

This is a great treat.  I did not use string cheese, there was a sale on block cheese, so all that was needed was to slice it up.  I would have added a photo but by the time I found the camera there was not much left.  This is a KEEPER.

Very similar to restaurant mozzarella sticks! I only suggest to add some more seasonings to the breadcrumbs like garlic powder/salt. Big hit in my house!

I tried it and it just tasted like something was missing... Next time I'm going to add flour and milk to the eggs and try that. I also don't think the freezing was necessary because I fry stuff all the time without waiting for it to freeze.

Amazing in taste and simplicity. I used a mini Fry Daddy and cooked 4-5 at a time. The oil did foam so I just kept an eye on it. The cooking time was much shorter than the recipe stated. I only had to fry them for 1-2 minutes. Absolutely delicious!

When it comes to following some recipes, if I think something needs added or changed that's what I'll do, the cheese sticks needed an extra boost of flavor so I added some hot pepper flakes, also with the pizza dipping sauce, I added extra virgin olive oil, hot pepper flakes, garlic powder or crushed garlic, just put my on twist to the recipe and made it my own.

I may have done something wrong, but I found these to be seriously lacking in flavor. If I hadn't made a super tasty marinara sauce, these would have been a waste. With that said, they were a beautiful color and texture, and were perfect otherwise.

I got a little frustrated preparing these because the egg accumulated in the bread crumbs and made them clumpy which made them not stick to the cheese well, I ran out of egg , and I ended up with way more bread crumbs than I needed (I'll probably half them next time.) However, the finished product was absolutely delicious. I used plain bread crumbs and added salt, pepper, garlic, basil and oregano to my liking. I didn't know how to measure the temperature of the oil, so I just set the burner to medium heat and cooked them til they browned and the cheese started to ooze out. Everyone raved about how good they were and came back for seconds, thirds and fourths!

Subbed crushed Ritz crackers for bread crumbs and deep fried in olive oil. They were great. This recipe is a keeper. They're really good dipped in homemade honey mustard.

They're delicious but time consuming to make.  Next time I make them I will probably do a large quantity and freeze them after I cook them so I can warm them in the oven when we want munchies!

I will never buy these pre-made again!! Part 2 of 2 of my review. I fried them while they were frozen so they browned faster than the cheese melted so I put them in the oven with the stuffed mushrooms I was making. I made a lot and put the rest in the freezer for the next time craving strikes you know later tonight. ;) thank you for this fantastic recipe.

This is how it's done, and I've got good news - you can use cheddar, mozzarella, colby, or any similar cheese cut into strips about the same size as string cheese.  Pay attention while they are cooking and when you see cheese starting to seep from the crust on any of the sticks, they're done.

The bread crumbs didn't always evenly stick, so I rolled them in a little flour before the second dredging.  My husband and I loved them.  Yummy. Thanks for the recipe

I made these for a cookout and they were gone in minutes. I suggest adding salt and pepper to the breadcrumbs, though.

I knew these would turn out awesome when I was still breaking them! Now they are all done and we are trying not to eat them all while we wait for our son's birthday party guest to show up. :)

Fantastic! I would recommend dividing the bread crumbs into two bowls so the second round of dipping isn't so clumpy and the coating looks more even.

I used Italian seasoned great value panko bread crumbs and cheddar cheese curds from the Philadelphia cheese factory up the road from us, skipped the garlic and fried in peanut oil... This is my favorite.

Have not tried this yet but I'm sure it's gonna be a hit! And for my parents who don't eat wheat or fried foods I'll use a wheatless panko and bake them! Its perfect!

It was awesome!  I added oregano, basil and onion.  I'm going to try it next time with some rosemary.  According to my thermometer though, 375 was way too hot.  They fried up perfectly at 300.

These tasted just like the mozzarella sticks you would order in a resturant as an appetizer. I didn't use the same bread crumbs to coat the entire time because the egg made it clump up.

Easy to make and are delicious. Made half and froze half for later. I will never order these again in a resturant. Just as good and cost friendly to make at home.
