This recipe was so easy. I did add garlic,whole canned tomatoes,onion powder. It was a nice change from regular spaghetti. also my father showed me trick years ago, after cooking the pasta melt a little butter in the pan and just a hint of cinnamon,mix with the pasta then put the sauce on and parmesan. This would be $25.00 plate in a fancy resturant.

First let me start off by saying that I have always loved cream cheese and thought it would be interesting to add it to a family stand-by of spaghetti.  No one in my family knew I was making it this way and even my "I eat everything" teenager wouldn't finish his first bite.  Thank goodness I had some frozen pizza and could salvage something for dinner.  I still love cream cheese but NOT with spaghetti dinner.

This is surprisingly tasty for just a few ingredients. I did not use ground beef in this, and honestly I don't think we would like this with that addition. Very nice way to doctor up a jar of sauce for sure, but the flavor could be enhanced with the addition of fresh herbs or crushed red pepper. I enjoyed this, my boyfriend not so much but he prefers a garlic & oil pasta anyway. I added some grated parmesan & basil when served also. Not bad considering the simplicity. Very similar to a rose sauce or vodka sauce without the vodka (if that makes sense). This seems to thicken also, so it's not very loose. I would make this again and try adding some herbs. :)

We love this! I haven't made it in a few years, I totally forgot about it. Made this out of necessity one time when I ran out of heavy cream and we just loved the tang that cream cheese adds, though it is easy for the tang of the cream cheese + any overly acid sauce to wind up being sour, so you need to taste the sauce before you serve it & adjust with sugar or baking soda :) Thanks for the recipe!

I really liked this recipe. The cream cheese was a nice added touch. I did make some changes though. I used bow tie pasta instead of regular spaghetti noodles and I did not add ground beef. I just combine the prego sauce, cream cheese, added basil, a Tbs of minced garlic, garlic pepper, and salt to taste. I topped it off with some parmesan cheese on top. It was really easy and very tasty. I will be making this again in the future.

Fabulous recipe!  I have been looking for a Rose pasta recipe and this exceeds expectations.  I did add a few of my own spices (pepper, salt, oregano, basil) and fresh garlic, but it would have been good even without the additions.  Loved the recommendation for the cinnamon butter to toss the noodles in.  Great meal!

I thought this was wonderful.  I, however, do like cream cheese a lot and I do think this was very cream cheesy.  Sauce was perfect amount for 4 servings.  We used two servings of sauce now and froze the rest for a second meal.  I used a jar of pasta sauce I had on hand.  It wasn't Prego Traditional, though.  I really did enjoy this!  And, my 18 month old ate it all up, as well!

This recipe has a lot of potential but it really needs a lot of seasoning to get there. Every other Saturday Rob and I have his two young grandchildren and I try and make "kid friendly" dinners for them. Since Philly came out with their cooking cream, I subbed with the Italian version. I browned ground turkey and added diced onions, garlic and green peppers until semi soft. Then came the spaghetti sauce, Philly cooking cream and seasonings.  Garlic and onion powders, black pepper, oregano, basil and parsley. Placed everything into a casserole dish, topped with parm and mozzarella and then baked until it was all bubbly and melty. The kids loved it and so did we!!

i absolutely LOVE cream cheese, was a very good meal, but my old school style spaghetti definitely tops this one. Will make again, but not as often.

Great, easy recipe. I add some cheese (to taste) and let it simmer for at least an hour - I find the longer it cooks, the better it tastes!

I make my own sauce and decided to add cream cheese to it.  It was horrible!  It lightened my red sauce and made it watery.  Love cream cheese in my desserts!

I tried this tonight as my first recipe from this site. It was really good, as I had become tired of the normal, tomatoey spaghetti long ago. The sauce was mild and creamy, lighter than its usual color. Cheese made a nice touch with well-cooked pasta.  Although people who like herby or more vegetarian spaghetti won't like this...

Really tasty. For those who dont have cream cheese handy a substitute would be a splash or two of cream or evaporated milk. That will also make the sauce creamy. You could just  add some parm to get a cheesier taste if you like.

This was really good.  We made with  ground turkey. We double the noodles and added more sauce by half. We kept the cheese the same.  Very hearty.

I made this a few weeks ago exactly as written and loved it. I made it again today and added a few things. I added 1 mild Italian sausage left over from  a cookout and removed the casing and cooked with the meat. Also added a can of diced tomatoes with garlic and basil. The only cream cheese I had was with chives and onions and used 3/4 of a tub. Also to cut the acid of the tomatoes I added 1 teaspoon of sugar. My first generation Italian Mother in law taught me that trick. This is now my go to spaghetti sauce. Thank you so much.

We really enjoy this. I like adding extra seasonings to it as jarred spaghetti sauce never has enough in it for our family (salt, pepper, garlic powder & dried basil.) Sometimes I'll change it up and make meatballs instead of grounding the meat up in the sauce. I make them with the ground beef, seasonings listed above, onion & an egg. Very quick and easy!
