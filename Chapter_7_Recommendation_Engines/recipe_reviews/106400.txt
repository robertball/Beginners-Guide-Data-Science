This was exceptional.  I am a new diabetic and have missed having a small sweet snack.  This hit the spot and my family and friends loved the recipe as well.  Thanks for this great recipe.

These are fantastic!  Very flavorful, yet not too rich.  A simple pleasure for a bridal shower or an afternoon tea.

These pack an almond wallop!  I think theyâ€™d be better with regular cream cheese though.

This recipe was amazing.  I used fat free cream cheese and fat free sour cream, and I was still very happy with the outcome.  Brought them to a Memorial Day cookout and they were gone before I even got one...Will definately be making again.

These had an odd flavor.  Maybe the combination of the sour cream and almond extract mixed with the splenda after-taste was a bit too overbearing for me.

Very delicious, the texture was creamy but firm and the taste very good.  Splenda held up fine in this one.

This was not good.  I agree with another reviewer that the extracts were strange together.  Maybe if only vanilla were used.  My husband smelled it and wouldn't even try it.
