This is my go to recipe for fruit dip.  I worked for a catering company for a long time and we always used this recipe, and everyone loved it.  Just the right amount of sweetness.  Delicious! If you add a little orange zest it gives it a very fresh fruit taste.

Needed a quick easy recipe for Bunco. They all LOVED it! Love the nutmeg in it. Takes the "too sweet" off.

This is my favorite - I didn't add the orange juice or the nutmeg though and it was still really good.

This was a hit at our Christmas Eve dinner.  I served it with a variety of fresh fruit and everyone raved about it!  The nutmeg mixed with the orange gives it a delicious flavor.
