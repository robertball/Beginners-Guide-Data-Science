Lighter version: Easy, delicious, economical and lower calories...what's not to love!!! Skip the oil and carefully toast 2 c. oatmeal on cookie sheet under broiler.  Melt 2 Tbsp. butter in skillet; add 1 Tbsp. honey, 2 Tbsp. brown sugar, 1/2 tsp. vanilla and dash of salt.  Cook and stir for about 1 min. then add toasted oats and 1/2 c. sliced almonds.  Stir and cook for about 3-4 min. (oats will be coated and continue to toast).  Then add 1/3 c. dried cranberries (or raisins) and stir 1 more min.  Spread mixture back on cookie sheet (lightly coated w/ cooking spray) and return to warm oven (broiler is off) for about 15-30 min. This allows granola to continue drying out.  So yummy and much cheaper than store bought!!!  Can't wait to try other nuts and maybe dried blueberries (for hubby).  Have fun making this recipe your own...

I tried this recipe, but with the suggestions of others. I scaled it down, using 2 c. oats, 1 T honey, 2T brown sugar, and only about 1 T butter. It came out so much better, like actual granola instead of over-sweet goo... I also spread it onto a cookie sheet and put in under the broiler on the middle rack to dry it out and make it crunchy. Also, a little cinnomon on top is really nice.

Very easy and tasty. Four stars b/c i doubled the oats,added cinnamon,vanilla, and a titch of salt. Did not change the butter, oil sugar or honey. Had the oven heating while cooking, spread on cookie sheet and put in oven then turned it off and left it. Turned out crisp and toasty. nibbled all day!

I love this recipe. It is quick and easy, but I gave it four stars, because it would have been less perfect had I not made some changes. As other reviewers suggested I added the rest of the ingredients,(almonds, cranberries...) in the last five minutes of cooking. At that same time, I also added coconut flakes, pecan pieces, raisins and cinnamon to the mix(~handful of each). I would have added more stuff had I had any more leftover dried fruits or anything! I did not increase the amount of the base ingredients though, and it still came out fabulous! Also a very easy trick to transfer the oats back to the skillet is to lay them on a tray lined with parchmint paper. All you need to do, is carry the oats while securely holing both sides of the length of the paper up, while carriying the oats inside. Make sure one hand is holding the back side of the paper closed so that nothing falls out, and the other hand holding near the front at the top. It is now a breeze to pour the oats back into the skillet sliding them down the parchmint "tube". Use the exact same method when pouring the whole thing into container after cooled. Easy transfer, and easy cleanup! Thanks for the recipe, great base for delicious granola, and can be very similar to quaker oat cereal, yet much healthier and cheaper!

This recipe came out great for me. The only change I made was to add the nuts and fruit before taking the oats out of the pan with the sugar and butter mixture and mixing them in then instead of after the granola had cooled. This caused the oats to form clusters with fruit and nuts inside.

Excellent!  I followed the advice in a few of the reviews, such as adding more oats, some cinnamon and adding the nuts and fruit at the end of the last cooking phase.  I also put the cookie sheet into a moderate oven, turned off after 5 minutes and let it sit... Nice and crunchy and very light... 
Granola costs a fortune in the market.  This is far better, less additives and a fraction of the cost. Thanks a million!

This tastes a lot better to me than most granolas.  My kids really like it, and one of them is really not thrilled with oats generally.  It is also easy to make.  

I added a little bit of vanilla to the honey and brown sugar...  Also, just an FYI - it is a bit oily.  But I think that is why the kids really liked it; it is rich and tasty because of that oil.  I am going to try substituting coconut oil for the olive oil and adding a little coconut to the mixture.

(Did the coconut thing!  MMMMMN - GOOD!)

Great recipe!  Definitely worth making it yourself vs eating store-bought.  Like others, I have some changes to really make it a 5, and they are: added 1/2 c wheat germ to the oats and nearly doubled the honey and butter (to compensate for additional dry ingredients).  Also when cooking the syrup I added vanilla, cinnamon, and a pinch of salt.  When I added the oats/germ back into the pan with the syrup, I added the other ingredients then too, to evenly coat them all simultaneously.  I also added coconut flakes and sunflower seeds.  I cooked all of the ingredients together for a few minutes on the stove, stirring constantly, then baked on a cookies sheet at 400 for 8 minutes.  I then let it set out for 30 minutes, scored with a knife, let finish hardening, then broke apart into pieces.  Even though I initially almost burned the oats/germ by not stirring constantly, it still turned out great!

After reading the reviews, this is what I settled on... 3 c of organic slow cook oatmeal, 1 T olive oil, a pinch of course salt, 1/3 c unsalted butter, 2 - 3 T honey, 1/3 c br sugar, 2 - 3 T flax seed, a handful of coconut, chopped walnuts. After mixing it all together per instructions, I put it under the broiler (on low) for 2 minutes, stir and then 1 minute at a time until it's golden brown, stirring after each minute. I love this recipe because of the flexibility. You can add whatever you want and adjust the honey, br sugar, salt to get the flavor you're looking for. I'm not a dried fruit fan so I leave that out. I eat this stuff like candy. Addictive. Many thanks for sharing!

Oh dear. With the suggestion to halve the butter-sugar-honey coating, this granola turns out delicious, but as written I'm afraid it's nearly inedible. Far too sweet, more like an oat brittle candy than a granola.  One thing I never did have trouble with was sogginess. You really do need the full 5 minutes and it really does need to be over medium heat at least. If you skip this step you will have soggy granola, because its purpose is to raise the temperatures of the butter and sugars, changing them into candy.  I like to use virgin coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, and add unsweetened dried coconut and a lot of flaxseed meal. Add the flaxseed meal at the end of cooking, just before you spread the granola out to cool, so the flax oils aren't damaged by the heat. Poppy seeds are nice too.

Yum.  I was a bit nervous trying this since every review had changes in the recipe.  I kind of consolidated what everyone did to try the first time and BRAVO-great stuff.  3 1/2 cups oats, dash cinnamon, vanilla and salt.  Easy and fabulous, that's what she said.

Great recipe but if you like granola double it. I did delete the olive oil. I toasted the almonds lightly and set them aside to cool. Then I toasted the oats dry very lightly. I mixed the brown sugar, honey and butter together and heated tll everything was melted, not long. Mixed it all together, spread on cookie sheet, put in a 250 preheated oven and turned it off to dry the granola.

I used this recipe as a starting point and loosely followed it for some of the best granola I've made yet.  I've been trying different recipes and I think I'll stick with this one.  I used a little less than a TBSP of oil, since I don't like the oily taste at all.  I added 1/8c each of wheat germ and flax seed to the oats when I toasted them.  Spread them on a cookie sheet covered with parchment paper while I melted the butter, honey and brown sugar.  I added a total of 1.5c of dry ingredients about a minute before I took the granola off the stove (1/2c cherries, 1/4c golden raisins, 1/4 dates, 1/4 sunflower seeds, 1/4 slivered almonds).  Then I spread the entire mixture back out on the parchment paper and put it in a 275 degree oven for a few minutes.  Turned the oven off and left it in there for about 10 more minutes.  Left to cool and it dried in nice clusters.  This is a great recipe and I can't wait to make it with other dried fruit/nut combos.

I thought this was a very simple and yummy recipe for home-made granola. After reading some reviews, I added an extra cup of oats to the recipe, and it was the perfect sweetness. My 3 year old helped me make it, and she couldn't stop eating it!

Great base recipe!  I made another granola recipe from this site using the microwave - followed instructions exactly and burned the batch.  Plus, the flavors weren't quite right.  This recipe, however, is great!  Here are the changes I made to suit my tastes:
Omit olive oil.  Used 1 c oats and 1 c corn flakes.  Reduced butter to 1 T., used 1 T honey and 1 T maple syrup.  Used full amount of brown sugar.  Subbed coconut flakes for cranberries.
Melted butter, honey, syrup, sugar til bubbly, added all other ingredients plus pinch of salt, teaspoon of cinnamon and tablespoon of flaxseed.  Stirred on medium heat for about 3 minutes.  That's it!  Great flavor.  I know, "she made a totally new recipe", you're saying.  Well, I was inspired by my failure and this stovetop version.  Thanks for a successful granola recipe Mamiscookin!

This isn't gooey and doesn't need to be put in the oven if you just make sure to cook the sugar/butter/honey concoction until it starts bubbling AND if you keep cooking it for 5 minutes after you add the oats. Totally easier that way than to add more work by adding more steps. LOVE THIS!

I have never made granola before, so I thought I would start with an easy recipe. I wanted to try something "healthy" tonight, so I used whipped butter instead of the stick. As it has 1/2 the fat & saturated fat. I found that at the first full 5 minutes it started to burn bits of the oatmeal, so it really has to be monitored. The brown sugar mixture cooked very quick to, and by the time I added the oatmeal back I could only cook it about 1 minute to avoid it from burning. I poured it onto a parchment paper lined sheet. I decided to not add the nuts and I do not like dried cranberries. However, the granola mix tasted just like a chewy granola bar exploded, and it was delicious! If I made again I would make less as I prefer it chewy. It does turn to the harder cereal type as it cools. This would be perfect for someone who buys a lot of boxed granola cereal. I did try it though next day with some Greek vanilla yogurt and it went together well.

Very good and easy. I quadrupled the recipe for a huge Christmas breakfast to go on yogurt parfaits. It was delicious. My hubby said it was better than anything he's had out of a box! A Keeper!

I was entirely misled by the reviews...  even after minor adjustments - this was mediocre granola at best.  I'd strongly recommend searching for another recipe.

This is a GREAT recipe, namely for how easy and quick it was to make when I was hungry in the morning.  BUT, i personally found it way too sugary - as is, it would make a great candy recipe, like poppycock.  For granola, i would easily add 1.5x - 2x the amount of oats specified in the recipe.

ao good! I made this & gave some to my almost-3-year-old daughter in a bag as a snack. After about 10 seconds of monching on it she says "Mommy, it's not a snack, it's a treat"! We all loved it!

This granola is flavorful.  Of course, I did the tweaks recommended by other users--broiling to toast the oats, adding some other fruits, cutting the oil, etc.

I think I was expecting something more like store-bought granola, and this is more oat-y.  That is 100% evident from the recipe, just, don't expect this to taste like a box of granola.  Expect it to taste like buttery oats with fruit and nuts.

This is a great granola recipe.  It is hard to find granola recipes that do not have peanut butter in them..and this one does not.  i needed a granola to take to my daughters preschool for snack...and i just omitted the almonds.    i did add some vanilla flavoring and some cinnamon and nutmeg to the sugar mixture.....i also added a handful of coconut.  as i was making the granola i preheated my oven to 400 degrees, and when the granola was all mixed i put it on parchment paper, and popped it into the oven while i was cleaning up....this made it nice and crunchy.  then because of time restraints i put it in the freezer to cool. great recipe....and not to sweet at all!!

This is the best recipe EVER! I've been making it for several months and I can't make it wrong no matter what I do! It's fabulous. I've switched out the sugar for Xylitol and the honey for agave and it still tastes great. I've added everything you can think of, but my favorites are coconut, chocolate chips and dried cranberries. And pecans! YUM. I'm addicted.

Absolutely delicious and really easy.  Amazing over yogurt.  I stuck to the recipe exactly this first time, but will definately modify to reduce the fat as recommended by other reviewers.  Foolishly thought I would just eat a half serving, but this is so addictive that strategy proved to be impossible to execute.  May as well make it "lite" and enjoy it guilt-free.

This was very easy to make and tasty, too!  I took the advice of another reviewer and used parchment paper for easy pouring and easy clean-up.  The perfect quick and easy healthy snack.

This is an amazing recipe!! I did a few things to make this recipe "my own," flavor-wise, but the most important thing is to let the honey mixture start to bubble rapidly, and then continue to cook (still stirring) for about a minute... that will eliminate the need to bake the granola.

Cooking granola in a pan on the stovetop changes everything! This is my new favorite recipe. I added pecans, walnuts & almonds when toasting the oats. I also added some wheat germ & coarse sea salt right at the end before I removed it from the stove. Delicious!

I'm looking at the Nutritional Information...529 calories and 30.3 g of fat per serving!  Needs some serious adjustment on amount of butter and the brown sugar.  Wouldn't use all those calories and grams of fat on about 3/4 cup of granola!

I cut the sugar in half and still it didn't need to be quite as sweet. Also, I think I could have added another cup of oatmeal to stretch it a bit more and still be yummy. The flavor and method were great, however, so I will be making this again and playing with it until it's perfect.

My family loves this recipe.  We use less sugar and butter.  I often add raisins and/or cinnamon.  Sometimes we leave the almonds out.  Delicious.

Quick, easy, and yummy!  Very much like the granola on McDonald's fruit and yogurt parfaits--which was exactly what I was going for so I was really pleased with the recipe.  I have to go buy more yogurt now to finish off all this granola!!

I used coconut oil instead of olive oil and butter. Instead of butter to melt my sugar and honey, I used 1/3 cup of apple juice (got this idea from Vegan Granola on AR). And of coarse granola has to have vanilla (2 tsp)and cinnamon (1 tbsp). I added sunflower seeds & raisins. I thought it was a little sweet so I added a pinch of salt and a handful more of oats. Really easy concept & fast. I will definatly play around with this one some more.

Quick and easy. We tried it with dates since they were on hand and it turned out great. Could easily substitute other nuts and dried fruits in this recipe... I'm even thinking a maple-praline curnch idea!

I made the suggested adjustments and it turned out great!  I think 3- 3 1/2 cups of rolled oats is probably better, if you want your granola to stick together better.  Very flavorful.  I added dried cranberries and chopped dates.  Yum!

Really easy to make and tastes delicious. I cut down on the brown sugar a bit. Also, I add almonds to it before putting it in the oven - this gives the almonds a nice toasted flavor. Tastes wonderful over low-fat strawberry yogurt. Yum!

THIS IS THE BEST GRANOLA EVERRRRRRRRRR. I HAVE MADE GRANOLA IN THE OVEN MANY TIMES BUT IT TAKES SOOOOOOO LONG. THEN I found this by a fluke and thought why didnt I think of making this on top of stove. I used this recipe using coc oil and dry coconut-cherries--salted cashewsand pecans. Was a little wet when cooled and put in 250degr oven 15 min and let it sit. Im calling it CRACK GRANOLA TKS for this recipe. It is now my secret and its soo versatile. I cant stop eating it.

I love all of the wonderful suggestions for this recipe.  It took me longer to decide which version to make as to prepare it. I stuck with the totally stovetop method because it's July and too hot for turning on the oven! I used all ingredients listed, also added a quarter cup each of wheat germ, flax meal- at the end, and chia seeds - love the crunch! Also threw in coconut, walnuts and extra dried fruit by the handful, vanilla and almond flavorings, and finally an extra cup of oatmeal because I knew it would be too sweet for us. The result after five minutes of stirring was heavenly! Thanks for the inspiration, this recipe is a keeper.

I too cut the butter, brown sugar, and honey down. Excellent concept making it on the stovetop. Love to be able to have granola in 30 minutes or less. Can add just about anything, coconut, pecans, whatever!

Just finished making this recipe.  We substituted molasses for the honey.  I give this one thumbs up, it is a simple, delicious, easy to make recipe.  I recommend it, especially for anyone who is gluten sensitive, as it does not have any wheat product in it.

Wow! I ate this for breakfast and then lunch and as a snack all day long. We used oat groats, organic sucanat sugar instead of brown sugar and dried apricot pieces instead of cranberries. The groats provide a crunch and the flavor is more than amazing. You may also want to experiment with toasted flax and sunflower seeds. All are great additions to this simple recipe. I'm eating the remains of my granola as we speak. Thanks!!

Easy, but to moist. I may bake it next time. I did reduce the brown sugar & butter as recommended by others so I can't imagaine how wet it'd been otherwise. I added raisins for more dried fruit. If made into bars the ingredients should stick together well.

This was excellent and very easy. I burned it a little but it was still yummy. I reduced the butter and brown sugar in an attempt to make it healthier but it was a little dry and not as clumpy as I wanted. I will keep experimenting until it's perfect. I used it to make yogurt and berry parfait and they were yummy. I added ground flax seed and pumpkin seeds.

Wow!  Awesome recipe!  My family love this recipe.  Thank you for sharing.  I took a previous reviewer's advice and baked the granola at 275 degrees for 10 minutes, turned the oven off and opened the door for another 10 minutes.  The finished product was amazing!

I rated this 4 stars because I did change it a bit. I basically followed what another reviewer (Emma p) suggested. I actually forgot to use a little cinnamon, but it turned out great! I heated the oven to 400 and then turned it off and put the cookie sheet in the oven for an hour or so and it turned out fantastic. Nice and crunchy! Thanks, Emma!

this is a wonderful recipe!    My family will grab a chunk of this Granola over  a cookie =)     Make sure you continue to cook it long enough after adding the oat mixture to the  cooked sugars.  this will ensure that the  sugar mixture "candies" enough to make the oats crunchy as opposed to a gooey mess. =)  (my sister adds that it's ALSO wonderful with Milk on top for breakfast ;-)

I made granola but only with what i had on hand. so i did not follow the recipe to the fullest....i cooked the oats for about 15 minutes because they didnt seem to get as toasty as i needed them until than.  I than took a nice piece of peanut butter/chocolate fudge id recently gotten from the board walk and melted it down and poured it over the oats and added dried cranberry and cinnamon! I ate it over plan life cereal and i loved the taste! I also saved some for a snack n it was very good cold/dry for snacking during the day! Thanks for the start I love having fun with oats!

FANTABULOUS!  I add 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon, about 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, and about 1/8 teaspoon sea salt. When using coconut, I mix it with the oatmeal before coating with the syrup.  To make bars, use quick cooking oats and press into a 7x12 pan. I use old fashioned oats for loose granola.  I wait to add the fruit and nuts until I'm going to use a particular serving of granola.  Chopped dates are great!

Outstanding granola recipe! A very healthy snack that my family keeps asking me to make.  I purchase the seven blend of dried fruit from Sams Club and add sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, almonds, walnuts, and banana chips.  Incredible!

The granola tasted great but I couldn't get the right consistency. I wanted something that would stick in clumps.

This was the only recipe I found that I had all the ingredients on hand. I didn't change anything, and it is excellent. You do not have to put it in the oven unless you want it super duper crunchy. It turns out crunchy enough on the stovetop, and isn't that the point of this recipe? If you have other grains like flax or wheatgerm, I'm sure those would also be great in it.

Mmm mmm mmm.  This receipe is great, we use it with our vanilla yogurt everyday and can't get enough.  I used maple syrup in place of the honey because as I was making it I realized I had no honey but with either one this is great.  Thanks for sharing.

I use about triple the oats but only double the sweeteners (honey and brown sugar). It's not as mushy and not as sweet. I also preheat the oven to 350 and then when finished, just tuck the granola in and shut it off, leaving for 45 minutes - hour.  My favorite toss ins (added to the butter and sugar mix right before the oats) are dried cherries, dried bananas and pecans. Like Banana Split granola.

This is a great chewy, yummy granola recipe!  I made it AS IS - I find it confusing when there are many reviews with variations, so I start with the basic recipe.  This is easy, tasty, and a great base granola recipe.

I think this is great, and I followed all the recommendations - HOWEVER make sure that you don't leave it on too long when you are first cooking the oats some little oat crumbs got burned and then made the rest of the granola taste burned when it was all done.

FABULOUS. :) I used around 1 TBS veg oil (I didn't measure, just approximated), 3 cups of quick oats, 2½ TBS butter, 1½ TBS honey, 3 TBS brown sugar, no nuts, around 1/3 cup of sesame seeds, and around 1/3 cup of Craisins. I put the sesame seeds in after the oats had browned for around 3 minutes (I cooked the oats/sesame seeds for maybe another two minutes), and it was great! I also added the Craisins into the hot pan for about two minutes before allowing the granola to cool. A great recipe that will replace the granola recipe I've been using! Oh, and I found that I didn't need to bake this in the oven at ALL. Thanks for sharing, MamaIsCooking!

I followed the direction except for I added about 3/4 a cup toasted coconut. Upped the amount of oats to three cups instead of two and added cinnamon and vamilla. Next time I make this I will on;y add an extra 1/2 cup oats because with the addition of that and the coconut and not changing the liquids it came out a little dry. I will add more cinnamon next time and at least double the cranberries. I also turned on the oven to 450 degrees and then turned it off and let the granola bake on the cookie sheet for a couple of minutes. I recommend doing this because it dries it out a little and makes it more like granola.

It was pretty good. I accidentally burned it a little, and then I ate too much trying to decide if I really liked it or not.  It seemed to be missing something.  I'll give it another try, though.

This is a delicious granola recipe.  It is chewy, but not too soft.  I added an extra cup of oats after reading the previous reviews and thought it was perfect.  It is great to snack on, and great with milk.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

I doubled this recipe and added rice crispies and a box of bran flakes cereal with dried fruit and almonds already in it in step #3 and put in an airtight container and shook it all together and it is soooo delicious. Most other granola recipes have you bake it for over an hour, this one is so simple and so good!

This granola is easy and yummy!  I was looking for something simple that I could use for fruit & yogurt parfaits and this fit the bill.  I made it without nuts due to my son's food allergies, so I was glad to find a recipe that wasn't highly nut dependant.  It's good even without nuts and dried fruit, but adding the cranberries or raisins is yummy, too!  The only thing I don't like is that it probably isn't as healthy as other granola recipes due to the relatively large amount of butter, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.

I looked at several recipes for granola and chose this one because it was cooked on a stove top. I am so very glad I did!!! Yes, it's sweet but I don't think it's off-putting. Yes, I will add more oats, nuts and fruit to it.  I will be making it again within this week! Awesome recipe-- thanks for sharing!!!

Yummy! As a novice cook using a recipe I made this recipe for 75 servings, trusting that it would be easy and flexible for ingredients. I chose 75 servings to give me several breakfasts while on a sailing trip by myself so I could grab a bag and eat. I ended up with about 40 to 50 pounds (I didn't weigh anything), filling 55 one-quart ziplock bags half way, with two generous cups each. I mixed everything in a huge contractor garbage bag.

I used 3 pounds almonds, two pounds walnuts, two pounds sunflower seeds, about 5 pounds raisins, a pound of dried blueberries, craisins, and a pound of dried apricots and mixed fruit. It is gooey and buttery, but it is so wonderful I cannot wait to get underway!  Have fun with it.

I made this today and it was amazing! Like others I made a few variations: added a tablespoon of peanut butter, cinnamon, used grape seed oil, added coconut, and vanilla.

I made the recipe, having high hopes for a quick and crunchy granola because of the ratings. This came out soft and soggy for me. I will visit this recipe again because the method has potential; success may lay in the exact temperature of the cooked butter-sugar mix, and perhaps I didn't cook it long enough or high enough, which would affect the degree of crunch.

This is five stars all the way! I made this as written with the exception that I used sugar in the raw instead of brown sugar. The granola wasn't as sweet, so to make up for the sweetness I just added a bit of white sugar to the jogurt. A lot of reviews that I read reduced the butter to a couple of tablespoons but I decided to use the entire amount instead. The granola wasn't gooey at all. It had a wonderful butter flavour, and after the granola dried, you could make the clusters as big or as small as you would like. The granola was crispy the day I made it, but after I stored it tightly in a glass jar, it turned out wonderfully chewy. My kids aren't really into granola, but they enjoyed snacking on this one. Will definitely be making this again! Thanks for sharing, mamaiscooking!

This was the easiest granola I've ever made. It's so much easier to achieve a toasty flavor without crossing that razor-thin threshold into burnt when you're using a skillet instead of the oven.

For added nutrition, I stirred 1/2 cup of flax meal in with the oats, and it's not even perceptible!

I will definitely make this over and over again!!!

So easy on the stovetop!! Just make sure to cook it long enough so it won't be sticky when it cools. I added 3 different kinds of nuts, cranberries and cinnamon...and more oats! Great recipe!

It was quick and definitely easy.  The only part that was kind of weird was that the sugar caramelized on the stove top and the granola had a caramelly flavor.  It wasn't bad but my husband asked if I had burned it.

This is a good base.  I've been making granola bars for a very long time and wanted some broken up granola for my greek yogurt.  I toasted the oats in the oven (accidentally burned them, oops!).  I substituted applesauce for the butter, raisins for cranberries, and flaxseed for almonds.  I also added in some peanut butter.  This turned out very very sweet, which was not a bad balance for the tanginess of greek yogurt.  But still, I would cut the sugar either in half or maybe even leave out completely the next time.  I think the honey and dried fruit alone would sweeten it up just fine.

Even after baking in warmed oven for 20 minutes, it was still a little soft for my liking. I recommend making it a day ahead of when you plan to use it. Once stored in a container, it hardened up to a nice texture the next day. Other than this, it was tasty!

Yum! Didn't have honey, so substituted 1 tbs corn syrup and added vanilla and almonds. Used a little more than 2 cups oats based on other reviews. Also, put cookie sheet of granola in a warm oven (turned off) for about 20 minutes. Tasty and easy peasy-thanks!!

Tasty! I did take certain liberties with this recipe. Without the addition, the recipe was great for my Yogurt Parfait. Since we are moving and I'm trying to use up everything in the house, I added raisnins, dates, hazelnuts, oat bran, and wheat bran, some more honey, and some more brown sugar for the "doubled" amount of extra.

Delicious and easy.  A great base recipe to add any specific ingredient to change the flavor, my 4 and 6 year old love it.  I just need to remember to double or triple the recipe next time cause my kids ate it all.

Wonderful quick, easy and delicious. Perfect on top of yogurt, pudding, cold cereal or just by the handful!

I too brown in the oven for a few minutes, not too long as the almonds will burn and affect the taste of granola!

We love homemade granola.  This didn't last long in my house, so I made another batch the next day.  This time, I looked at other's suggestions and tried some wheat germ and semi-sweet chocolate chips.  This one was gobbled up immediately also.

Simple recipe however watch cooking time after adding oats as this will "catch on" and burn easily. Do try again ...Your second batch will be better than your first!

VERY YUMMY!  I live overseas and unfortunately our oven doesn't go below 350F...so I needed to find something I could cook on the stove.  This turned out wonderful.  I added the chopped almonds (left out cranberries), some dried banana chips, sunflower seeds and a few walnuts.  SOOOO GOOD!  Even my picky 2 year old can't keep his hands out of the bowl!

I make a similar Granola in a toaster oven, less of coarse, to sprinkle on my yogurt & fruit (chopped apple or pineapple).  Just a little olive oil drizzled over the oats and chopped almonds.  After toasting, cool and  transfer to an air tight container, sprinkle in a packet of Truvia, to keep the sugar levels lower.  A couple of heaping tablespoons over yogurt makes a healthy, yummy breakfast.  Would have given 5 stars but for the amount of sugar and fat.

We love this granola, but I made a few modifications: used canola oil instead of oo - mistakenly used 2 T of oil early in the recipe when toasting the oats; instead of butter, I used only 1 T of oil; added a few tsps of cinnimon to the honey mixture; added 1/4 c flax meal; added 1/4 c pumpkin seeds. Easy and delicious. The kids love it!

Deliciously addictive! Tried it cooled, and dried in the oven - both great. Didn't try the vanilla or cinnamon. Personal preference: Too buttery. Although, it might be the olive oil-I'll toast the oats in the oven next time, and cut the butter. Too sweet-I'll cut down on the brown sugar too. Great as a 'base' recipe! I threw everything but the kitchen sink in mine (cashews, almonds, walnuts, sunflower, sesame & pumpkin seeds, dried cranberries, raisins, flax seed, wheat germ, coconut and extra oatmeal. Wonderful-a must try recipe!

My kids LOVED! this recipe.  We have started eating it for breakfast instead of the homemade stuff.  Since honey is expensive and I have been making it a lot I use Karo syrup instead. Sometimes adding some molasses in with it.  I have even added ground flax seed to it to make it a tiny bite healthier.  We buy the dried fruit at Walgreen's and change it every time we make it.  Any how this is a winner in our family.

I made a few changes but I'm still going to give this recipe a well-deserved 5 stars.  I used 3 cups of oats, light margarine instead of butter, a tablespoon of blackstrap molasses instead of the 2nd tablespoon of honey and added vanilla, nutmeg, cinnamon, a pinch of salt. I preheated the oven and turned it off when adding the cookie sheet covered with aluminum foil and letting it sit there til cool.  When I took it out I crumbled it a little and added almonds, coconut, raisins and some semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Oh yeah, it's yummy.  I'm munching some right now.  Awesome recipe! Thanks!

Loved this quick and easy granola recipe! I used a little less butter and substituted craisins for the dried cranberries and apples.  We also threw in some mixed nuts.  This is a good recipe to add what you want....my kids love it (they and I say it tastes like a certain "warehouse" brand that is made there and carried no longer :-()Very good....would really recommend!!  Yum!

Love this recipe. I used it as a base recipe and changed some things. But you can pretty much add what you want to granola. I added coconut and craisins and pecans.

The granola has a great texture. It isn't hard - it breaks apart easily at the bite. The recipe is very versatile - you can mix and match your favorite flavorings, dried fruits and nuts. My only complaint is that it's so good (and butter-laden), I can't keep it in the house very long.

This recipe is great!  The first few times I made granola I followed the ingredients and directions as said.  Now I've made this at least once a week for the last year.  I give it five stars because it can be very versatile.  It's quick and simple and you can adjust the ingredients for your and your family's personal taste.  I usually reduce the amount of sugar, honey, and butter and often times make it without any add-ins.  An easy and inexpensive breakfast or snack!

I absolutely love this cereal. My kids gobble it up every time I make it. The only changes in the recipe I made (as per my friend Mandi's suggestions)were 3c. of oats instead of 2. I added 1 1/2 tsp. of vanilla to the brown sugar, and honey mixture and add a tsp or Tbsp. of flax along with different kinds of nuts like sunflower seeds.

This recipe is so yummy.  I followed the directions exactly, including the 5 minutes of cooking at the end.  I thought I was burning it, but turns out that if you let the honey/sugar/butter mixture come to a complete bubble and then cook the oats for 5 more minutes you don't need to dry it in the oven.  Its clustery, perfectly dry, and so good.  There is only one thing I'd like to know.  How long will it keep in an airtight container?  Next time I'd like to make a double or even a triple batch in the hopes it lasts longer than the afternoon.

amazing! I all of a sudden had this urge to have granola cause I wanted a snack and all I have is popcorn but it's too late to go out and buy any so I decided to make it. So to tell you the truth, I didn't measure anything but here's what I did. I used oats, coconut, puffed cereal (Kashi which tastes horrible on it's own so I am thankful i have a use for it), and as other people did, I used maple syrup instead of honey, and added cinnamon and vanilla. I also cut back on the butter and sugar like other people said. I am putting it in the oven to dry out a little but I couldn't help myself from eating it off the pan. I am making this again!!

I made this a second time and I forgot to let my butter/sugar/syrup mixture bubble a bit (as the above poster after me said to do) and it didn't clump as well so make sure you do it!

Very good recipe.  I use a wok for plenty of room.  I use 3 cups oats instead of 2.  Also added a tsp of vanilla to the bubbly mixture.  I used Old-fashioned oats because my batch with quick oats didn't turn out as well.  Very nice granola and much cheaper than store-bought!

delicious and easy granola.  I substituted 1/2 cup of the oats for rice crispies cereal.  I also added a 1/4 cup of wheat germ and a cinnamon stick. I'll be making this often.

I made this as suggesed by others - 2 c. oats, 1 TBS honey, 2 TBS brown sugar, 1 TBS butter and a little vanilla and cinnamon. It was chewy, not dry, but came out in mostly flakes of oats, without the clumps I like in granola, especially homemade.  Next time, I will either increase the butter-honey-sugar mix, or cut back on the oats so it's just a little stickier and I'll add bigger nuts for more crunch (I used sliced almonds, which got a little lost in the mix).  I might try maple sugar instead of honey next time, for a different flavor.

Divine. On the suggestion of other reviewers, I doubled the oats, added some vanilla and cinnamon, added the almonds, cranberries and some dried apples for the last five minutes on the stove, and baked for about 10 minutes at the end. Next time I may cut the brown sugar a little bit, but it's really good.  I also may use agave nectar instead of honey/sugar and add coconut and other fruits. I'm excited about all the possibilities and can't believe I never thought to make my own granola before. It's easy, delicious, inexpensive and free of chemicals/preservatives/etc.

My hubby can't wait for the next batch! This recipe is a great base to work with, and quick! I increased the oats to 3 cups, added 1 tblspn cinnamon and 1 tblspn vanilla. Also added 3/4 cup coconut, and 1/4 each of other nuts and fruits on hand. I also increased the honey by another 1/2 tblspn and decreased the butter a bit. Yummy. We're never buying granola again!

This really is a great recipe.  I took the suggestions of some of the other cooks and doubled the oats and added cinnamon, vanilla, and salt.  This recipe makes me wonder why I haven't been making my own granola all along.  I don't think I will be buying it at the store any more!

I'm only giving it four stars because this recipe needs a little extra TLC to make it 5 stars. I used three cups oats, added vanilla and cinnamon, and baked it in the oven at 250 for 5 minutes to crisp it up.  It won't seem crispy when you remove it from the oven, but it hardens as it cools.

Variations: No sugar using an extra tsp of honey; substitute molasses for the honey.

You can skip the step where you brown the oats, but that does give the granola a deeper, darker flavor.

Fantastic recipe. I also changed a few things in the recipe to cater to my taste. Instead of cinnamon alone like everyone suggested, I used pumpkin pie spice. I used the oven the second time because the product the first time was so chewy and delicious (like a granola bar) it was gone in 24 hours. Next time I am going to try to replace the butter with olive oil to make a lactose-free granola. So easy and addictive!

If you are looking for a fast and simple granola recipe this is it.  It was extremely good for the amount of time and ingredients it took.  It got better after a day--It dried out some more, and got more of the typical granola crunch. Reminded me of a carmel corn taste, with oats, which I liked. I have made it with toasted pecans which was really delicious.  I also added a 1/2 cup of golden flax seeds with the oats which added to the healthy factor, gave great crunch, and added a extra nutty flavor.

Great foundation! I'd recommended, as others have, doubling the oats. Then get creative with the additives, or even leave them out. It tastes wonderful either way and saves you a bundle.

I thought this was just ok.  I added extra oats and toasted the nuts and some coconut too.  After I did put it in the oven to dry out a little faster. It's good for a quick granola.  Not sure if I will make it again.

A quick and easy granola recipe that is delicious.  I also added toasted coconut.  If you like a drier granola, this is not the recipe you're looking for.

I always knew I was spending WAY too much money on store bought granola, but I never imagined that it was this easy to make!  I'm all for simple and this recipe fits the bill.  I did up the oats and added a little pumpkin pie spice.  Man, this does taste good, and it makes the kitchen smell wonderful.
Hubby says I can make this for him anytime.  Think we'll take a big batch skiing with us next year!
Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is great because it is very quick to make and tastes great too.  I leave out the nuts and craisins to use it as a topping for yogurt.  Like others, I upped the quantity of oats to 3 cups.

Loved this quick and easy granola recipe!  I used vegetable oil instead of olive oil.  Also, substituted craisins for the dried cranberries and pecans for the almonds.  Added golden raisins as well.  Yum!

This recipe is really, really good.  My only tip is to not take your eyes off of it after it goes back into the pan a second time!  Mine burnt a little bit, but, that was my fault.  Very fast too!

This is the fastest granola recipe I have ever made.  Having said that, one might think that it wouldn't be all that good, but nothing could be further from the truth.  I think the addition of additional dried fruits would be good, but not necessary.  Will definately be making again and again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

So easy. I made a triple batch for a Scout outing. I served cranberries and almonds on the side because of some allergies. It was gone quickly. Next time I might add vanilla.

i made it 3 times already. a really good, easy recipe. thank you! for less sugar I deviated slightly everytime and it turned out good. I used 2 tbsp honey with 2 tbsp brown sugar for two cups of oats. second time I used 1/3 cup + 2tbsp butter +1/3 cup canola oil + 1 cup honey with no sugar for 5 cups of oats. turned out great. I also added cardamom to the oil before roasting the oats to give it some aroma. thank you for the recipe

Thanks to all for your suggestions.  I blended them all together and came out with a 4 star batch of granola.  The next batch I make will be better.  My biggest problem was toasting the oats.  A few burned and it is noticeable to me.  Five minutes on medium-high temps with my cheap pan was too much.  I used cashews for my nut and craisins, dried apple and dried peach.  Vanilla and cinnamon are two of my favorites so they also went into the mix.

For my purposes, this granola was perfect!  I substituted a plain (no cranberries or other additions)  version for a graham cracker crust in a brunch lemon mousse.  Delicious! It was quick and easy in my cast iron skillet. It would probably be too sweet for a breakfast cereal, but was just right for a topping, or in this case, "bottoming," a dessert.

This is an awesome easy recipe. The only thing I would change would be to add nuts and dried cranberries before granola cools too much. I waited too long and the nuts and cranberries separated from the granola. I will also add sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds to increase protein.

This is my standard basic granola recipe. I change out the almonds and cranberries for any nuts, seeds, or dried fruit I have on hand. I sometimes add cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg, or other spices to the syrup, depending on my mood.

Really good. I did scale down the honey-brown sugar-butter coating just because it seemed rather excessive (I used two tablespoons of each). I also used raisins and dried cranberries as my fruits. Overall I will definitely be making this again one day.

This is the most delicious granola recipe Iver ever made.  Its also really fast and easy.  You can customize it however you want too.  I used walnuts instead of almonds.  I also added two cups of rice crispies just before I set the granola to cool.  It gives it more crunch and more volume.

This turned out like a chewy bar...nothing like granola. It is currently in a just warm oven in the hopes that it will dry out more and achieve a crumbly granola texture. I would not make this again as is, but would try one of the revised recipes because it whips up in a jiffy.

Like others, I reduced the sweetness by using 2 Tbs honey, 2 Tbs brown sugar, 1 tsp vanilla extract, and 1 tsp of cinnamon. Very yummy as a snack or in yogurt!

I was drawn to this recipe because it didn't require the oven. . . I read all reviews, but decided to follow it exactly. It was easy to make in my iron skillet. It really reminds me of a recipe I used to make in the 1990's from a Quaker Oats pamphlet (same cooking technique and taste). This is not so much a healthy food, but is very good over yogurt or ice cream. . . Tastes like a crispy oatmeal cookie

I bake my oats at 350*, instead of the stovetop. I also add coconut, cinnamon and dried orange peel. I add ALL the dry ingredients together before I pour in the candy, and then stir it till it's well blended. I also let it dry before putting it in my container. I put this in my greek yogurt with honey (only way I will eat greek yogurt)!

I made this with my eldest stepdaughter last night to ease our Friday night munchies, and though (after reading popular reviews) I was a little worried about the proportions...BUT I did it exactly by the recipe and I think it turned out great!! instead of spreading it to cool I dropped tablespoonfuls to cool and try were like little granola bites. after letting them completely cool they got nice and soft yet crispy even without baking. the proportions of granola goo to oats was good I don't know how anyone could've mixed it with less. Wonderful, going in the vault! Thanks from all the nibbly tummies in my house.

I followed some of the other reviews for modifications, but I'm going to try the recipe as written next time (except with coconut oil instead of butter) just to see what the consistency is like.
I used coconut oil instead of butter. I melted 2 tbsp coconut oil then cooked the oats in that. I laid it out on a parchment lined cookie sheet. 
Then for the coating, I halved the ingredients - 2 tbsp coconut oil, 2 tbsp brown sugar, and 1 tbsp honey (just because I'm not a huge fan of honey). 
Be careful with the coating!I burnt the first batch, because I was waiting for it to bubble consistently, but you want to catch it as it first starts to bubble, otherwise it will burn quickly after that.

Easy, quick and makes the house smell great.  Very versatile, you can change it up with different add ins. I used coconut oil and a little more honey. I have to hide it to keep the hubby from chowing down on it all day!

Cut the sweet as others suggested and substituted dried cherries for the dried cranberries.  Sometimes add coconut or stir in a little cinnamon.  Good basic recipe to vary as suits your taste.

I'd really give this a 4.5 rating as it was very quick, easy and delicious.  The only reason it wasn't a five was because some of the granola was a bit chewy.  (And maybe a little of that was preparer's error! IDK)

I made a couple of very small changes. While cooking the sugar and honey mix, I added about a 1/2 tsp. of almond flavoring.  I think it enhanced the flavor a bunch!  I'm sure one could use a little vanilla too.  The other change I made was I put the dried fruit and nuts in the liquid mixture together with the browned oats.  That nice coating then covered everything.

Loved this!  I did halve the oil and added a bit of cinnamon to the mix, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I stirred in the almonds during cooking, and didn't add the dried fruit as I find it too sugary.  Really good flavor, and hubby liked it too. Thanks!

Amazing!! I literally make this once a week (or more) for yogurt parfait & oatmeal. My husband and kids circle around the kitchen like sharks to eat the granola as soon as it is finished! I have made this recipe exactly as written and I have also made it a healthier version using only  half of the butter. Both are excellent!!I usually add 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of cinnamon. After the granola is on the cookie sheet I broil it for 3-4 minutes for a crunchier granola. Only a personal preference. Excellent recipe, thank you:)

I love this recipe but I tweak it just a little bit....I add dried cherries and pomegranate in addition to the dried cranberries.  I also add chopped pecans in addition to the almonds. For an extra twist I added in unsweetened coconut.  I like to add the dried fruits and nuts to the honey, butter, and brown sugar mixture and then add it all to the toasted oats.

It's a great base I cut the butter 1T, honey 1T, and brown sugar to 1T then add 1T molasses melt on stove with 1/2t salt 1t vanilla. Meanwhile I baked the oats and almonds at 350 keep CLOSE EYE or they'll burn. Once oats/almonds done add to sugar mix coat thoroughly then return to cookie sheet sprinkle with cinnamon bake 5 min turn add cranberry bake 5 min. Then cool 10 min add semisweet chips while still warm. Then finish cooling and store.

I made this recipe basically as-is {just added a bit of extra oats} and it was a HUGE HIT!  I made a batch and had my husband, 6-yr-old and 4-yr-old try it out while I made a second batch.  I thought they were going to finish the entire first batch before I finished making the second!  This will definitely become a staple for us to use on yogurt, ice cream, as a school snack, breakfast, etc.  Love it!

My family loves this recipe.  We use the base mixture than also add flax, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, crasins, Whatever nuts we have in our cupboard, and etc.  It is addicting.  Great for snacking or for cereal.  You can't buy cereal this tasty and healthy.

If I could give this recipes more than 5 stars I would. I made as written, except for adding dried fuit and almonds in last 2 minutes of final cooking phase. The consistency, texture, and taste were EXACTLY what I expected.  I loved that it is stove top and no-bake.  Very easy to throw together in the morning for quick breakfast.  Serve over yogurt and garnish with fresh fruit for a light and flavorful parfait.

I wanted to give this recipe 5 stars because I do like it, but I gave it 4 instead because I'm glad I made the modifications I did, at the suggestions of others.  The biggest modification I made was that I doubled the amount of oats to 4 cups but left the remaining ingredients the same (especially the sweeteners--this must taste like candy if you don't). For a bit of extra flavor, I also added a splash of vanilla extract and a sprinkle of cinnamon, but I imagine it would still be good without this.  It was still a bit sweet for my tastes, but I was looking for an easy, healthy recipe (I have a baked granola I also like). This one is close if you leave everything the same and double the oats. And, of course, you're free to mix in whatever extras you do or don't want--I didn't have almonds, for example, and it's still delicious. Perhaps because of my doubling the recipe, I also had to increase the cooking time by a few minutes at the beginning and end.

This was very easy to make, and easy to customize. I'll definitely make it again and maybe add more oats. (If anything, it was a little sweeter than I thought  it would be.)

this was really great! my first attempt at making granola and i am really pleased!  the only part that confused me was knowing when the oats were beginning to cook.  i feel like i could use this as a good base recipe for all different types of granola! Thanks!

This is a delicious and simply recipe! I took the advice of some of the reviews and doubled the oats. I also cut down the butter to 1/4 cup. The second batch I put 1 Tbs. honey, 2 Tbs. blackstrap molasses, cut down on the sugar, and added sweetened coconut. After combining everything in the pot and mixing for a couple of minutes I put it back on the cookie sheet and let it toast in the oven. Don't forget to stir frequently! Thanks for this tasty recipe!

This is a great recipe and easy to make.  I tried a granola recipe on Quaker's website and it wasn't nearly as good as this one.  Just be sure to keep close watch when browning the oats.  I had to throw my first batch out because I let the oats get too brown and consequently, they had a burnt taste.  I used some leftover brazil nuts and dried peaches and cherries.  It was awesome with Greek yogurt!

The taste was perfect, but the granola itself didn't stay together to well. But still very enjoyable.

Good recipe, made a few times on stove top, too labor intensive.  Toast the oiled oats in oven for about 15 minutes at 375, stirring them around on the sheet pan occasionally.   Very customize-able, I leave out the fruit, add peanut butter and molassas.  have also made the sauce with white chocolate, which coats nicely but limit bake time after mixing.

I've made this twice now. It makes a chewy granola that is quite sweet. I use olive oil in place of the butter, next time I will try cutting back on the sugar. I double the recipe but I will try it without doubling the sugar.

So yummy and easy.  I took the suggestions of others and increased the amount of oats to 3c instead of 2.  I didn't let my pan cool enough between toasting the oats and adding the butter, so the butter browned too quickly.   Next time I will try adding some vanilla.

I found this addicting. I doubled up on the cranberries, just to add a little more sweet.  It goes great with Greek Yogart or as a snack.

I loved this! I've never made granola before, but this sounded so easy. I followed directions, but was a little short on butter, so  I used less there. I also took suggestions from others and added the fruit/nuts at the end of cooking (used chopped almonds, dried apricots, cranberries and raisins), sprinkled cinnamon on top and stuck the pan in the oven for less than 5 minutes. WOW! It just finished cooling and I broke it up to put in the container and it is very, very tasty. My kids love it and it is less fattening than store brand. Thanks for the recipe... it's a keeper!

Thank you so much for this quick, delicious, versatile recipe. I find it very hard to find tasty granola in stores that doesn't have any nuts in it (which I'm allergic to), so it's such a relief to be able to make my own at home and know exactly what's in it. I look forward to creating different combinations to suit my cravings. Thanks again for such a treat! :D
UPDATE: I literally make this every morning for breakfast. I like to add cinnamon and peanut butter, and sometimes coconut. I'm in love with this recipe :P

I've never made granola before and this recipe was exceptionally easy. I bought unsweetened granola from Bulk Barn and followed all of the steps above (adding more granola to the recipe). I added about 1.5 tsp of vanilla and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon to the butter/brown sugar mixture. I also added shredded coconut and chopped walnuts to the pan when the oats were added to the brown sugar/butter combo. To finish, I put in the oven @ 350 for 8 mins. The result was a delicately crunchy granola. The only downside is how oily it was (only noted when I removed it from the cooling pan - left an oily residue all over my hands). But the taste was perfect. I'll be enjoying tomorrow morning with fresh farm fruits.

This granola is great! Per reviewers suggestions I added cinnamon and vanilla. It did come out a little greasy so I mixed in three handfuls of coconut flour. Will definitely make again, just cut back on the butter. I love the fact that you can make these on the stovetop and don't have to heat up the entire house baking them in the oven.

Really great simple recipe! I made this one morning for my husband for breakfast and since then we have been eating it almost every morning with yogurt. I use 3 cups of oatmeal because we like it a little less sweet, but it works great with either 2 or 4 also.  I toast my almonds with the oats, and never really take the time to bake it...I just let the trays sit out on my counter for awhile to dry out (saves energy and doesn't make the kitchen so hot!) Thanks for the great recipe!

This turned out really well.  I didn't have any olive oil, so I substituted about 1 1/2 tablespoons butter.  I also didn't have any honey, so I left that out entirely, and it ended up being really crispy, so this is a suggestion if you made this recipe and it was too gooey.  Besides this little dilemma, I had to kick my little brother out of the kitchen while it was cooling, it was that tasty.

Very tasty stuff.  I followed other review suggestions.  My only complaint is that the granola all sticks together when cool, so the nuts and cranberries just sink to the bottom.  Next time, I will definitely follow the suggestion of stirring the remaining ingredients in before spreading it out to cool.

We like this.  I cut back on the brown sugar and butter to 1/4 cup, I know, not much difference, but every little bit helps!  I sprinkle some cinnamon on the oats after adding them back to the pan.  I have used Smart Balance in place of the butter, and pecans instead of almonds.  It always turns out nice and chewy, with a hint of honey and cinnamon flavor.

Very good! I liked this a lot - I added 2 cups of coconut flakes to the oats and used smart balance - non-hydrogenated margarine in place of the butter for the syrup. I found the granola stayed soft and chewy and did not crunch up - so I put it in a huge roasting pan lined with parchment paper and put it into a 300 degree oven for about 20 minutes. I let it sit on the counter for about 1/2 hour and then it crunched up. Next time - I will follow the ingredients listed, but I will make the syrup on the stove top - or even in the microwave and toast the oats in the oven. - This will save the extra fat and calories from the oil used in the beginning. Used to top "lemon Blueberry Dessert" from this website!

i followed a suggestion to double the oats. it was not clumpy enough for my personal taste.  i made it again and only added an extra cup of oats.  i found it to be slightly more clumpy, but not a gooey mess.  a perfect addition to a half of cup of low-fat yogurt for lunch.

I can't keep my husband out of the granola! Holy cow! This was so easy and is absolutely delicious. I think next time I would cut back a bit on the butter but for eating it by the handful? Delicious!!!!! I added dried cranberries, sliced almonds, coconut and sunflower seeds. Will definitely make again -- well, I'll have to and hubby will have eaten it nearly all by himself. Oh, and I doubled it. Worked out well.

I just have to add that it cracks me up when I read, "I only gave this 3 stars because of the changes I made to it." It's a shame the overall rating gets lowered because someone changes it and then gives it a bad rating.

awesome granola.  i've always wanted to make my own and now i'm definitely never buying that expensive stuff from the store AGAIN!  i used 2c oats and 1c puffy brown rice, and 1/2c brown sugar, then cooked according to the recipe (added in nuts, raisins, etc before i took it off the heat) and then popped in the oven for a few mins to make it cluster a bit.  truly amazing!

WOW!  I just made granola!  What a fantastic recipe, and a great way to save big bucks at the grocery store.  I doubled the recipe and like other reviewers didn't change the amount of butter or sugar per extra 2 c oats.  However, I thought it needed a little more sweet and added extra brown sugar at the end.  I put about a cup of dried bananas, a cup and a half of cranberries, 4 tbsp honey, a cup of chopped walnuts and about a cup and a half of dried coconut.  If you like your granola to stick together more, leave the recipe the way it is.  I like using less butter and the granola came out fantastic!  You could add just about anything you have on hand to this and make it great, cinnamon, almonds, raisins and a little allspice would make a really great fall mix.  Tons of variations are possible and they'll all come out scrum-diddly-umptious I am sure! ENJOY!  If you love granola, truly you cannot afford not to try this recipe.  Literally -- this is going to save us SO much money :)  And it's SO EASY!  I just made this again and it's not as crispy as I'd like it, so I baked it for a while (on the cookie sheet) at 200 (about an hour - 1 1/2 hrs) and then let it cool on the countertop in the cookie sheet for the rest of the afternoon.  It is crispy and perfect.  Love making my own granola!

This recipe is great because I don't have to worry about heating the house up with the oven.  It takes minimal time and is so easy to throw together.  The amounts can easily be adjusted, as can ingredients.  For instance, I can't eat almonds so I use chopped walnuts.  I do add the nuts when browning the oats, to toast the nuts too.  This granola is great!  Even my friend's picky kids loved it.

I really liked the flavor of this granola - I also added vanilla and cinnamon as some others suggested.  I wish it had clumped better though - at the end it fell apart instead of sticking in small clumps like store-bought.

My husband loves this recipe.  I make it a lot to supplement the other boxes of cereal in our cupboard.  I wish I had a bigger skillet to make more!  Only a four because I have to alter the recipe as written--double the oats and add the cinnamon, vanilla and titch of salt.

I make this granola weekly.  We eat it most mornings for breakfast.  It is also a great snack.  I do add cinnamon and vanilla sometimes as some other reviews have also suggested also nutmeg sometimes as well.  I have tried it with lots of different fruit and nuts.  I have also shared the recipe with many of my friends.  Everyone who tries it wants the recipe.  It is so quick and easy to make, giving it the advantage over many other granola recipes.

Excellent, easy and tasty! I did not make the recipe as is, but the base and cooking directions helped make this a wonderful addition to my recipe collection! My additions/substitutions:

1. 3 c oats
2. 1/4 t of vanilla extract, salt & cinnamon
3. 1/4 c packed brown sugar, slightly rounded 
4. 2 1/2 T honey
5. 1 T ground flax seed
6. Used raisins instead of cranberries
7. Browned finished mixture @ 350 degrees for 3 1/2 minutes - made a bit more crunchy

Will make this over and over again!

Wonderful!  I followed some reviews' suggestions and added the tiniest bit of vanilla, cinnamon, and salt as well as decreasing the butter to 2 tbsp.  Also, I didn't have any cranberries, so I increased the almond slivers to 3/4 cup. Hands down, the best granola I've had in my life!

Yes, finally a tasty and easy granola!! Very good, I added some vanilla and cinnamon to it. I also heated up some jam to form a liquid, and drizzled a little over the finished product--so good!

I love this recipe!! It is so easy, and my family loves it. I have taken the advice of others and have increased the oats to 3 cups, and added a pinch of salt, cinnamon, and vanilla. I also add 1 cup of crisp rice, it adds a little something to the granola. My husband likes me to make up a double batch for him to take with him when he goes out to sea. I have tried many other recipes, and this one is the best. It is so versatile. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This actually was really good granola; however, I wished I'd taken the advice of some earlier posters. I think the addition of both vanilla and cinnamon would have been really great. As-is, it's just a little bit bland. I don't find it oily in the slightest, and it's plenty sweet. I don't measure anything, so I'm sure I over-did the honey, but I'll for sure make this again. I also made a batch with toasted coconut - really really like that. Will for sure try this one again - saves big $ over buying it at the store!

So good - and so easy to change! Our best variation yet was a decrease on the sugar with dried banana (already sweet) and sunflower seeds. My roommate and I make it atleast once a week - so much better than store bought (and more afforable too).

very simple and quick. I like the flavor and how easy it is. I added cinnamon and pieces of pecans. I also used part maple syrup for the honey. It was chewy and delish. Very addictive. I used half the amount of butter and it was still plenty.

I was a little concerned because it seemed a bit sticky after it was all together. I spread it out on a cookie sheet and put it in the oven @ 400' for about 3 minutes - watching it to make sure it didn't burn. I took it out, let it cool and broke it up into small chunks. It was perfect! I am looking forward to experimenting with different nuts and fruits!!! Yummy!!!

This granola was very good and very easy to make.  Like alot of the other reviewers, I added vanilla and cinnamon and toasted the granola in a 400 degree oven for about 10 minutes.  It made a great topping for vanilla yogurt.

My friends absolutely LOVE this! I usually add another fistful of brown sugar, and a couple of dollops of honey...well, I'm pretty liberal with everything, so it evens out. It's even better the next day; more granola-y after it's had time to settle, or something. Anyway, this is fantastic!

I love this recipe!  I made a few small changes.  I added salted almonds and raisins in addition to the cranberries.  It turned out fantastic! I agree with the other reviews that it needs a few mins under the broiler.

Tasted good. I was just missing the crunch you usually get from granola. I folowed the recipe exactly except for adding a little cinnamon and substituted pecans for almonds. For me it came out more chewy, more like candy than granola.

This was really delicious and very easy. I left it on the counter to cool, and my husband nearly made himself sick--he just couldn't stop eating it because it was so good. I think next time I might stick it in the oven for a few minutes. Even after it cooled, it was a little sticky, but it dried out after a few days. A little bit of baking might speed up the drying process. But otherwise, this was great. We liked it so much, we're thinking about making a big batch and giving it out instead of Christmas cookies this year.
