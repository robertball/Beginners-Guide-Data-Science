the soup came out amazing. the issue I have is the fact that there are ingredients in the recipe that aren't on the list and there is no measurement for it such as buttermilk and parsley. there were 4 items not listed in the ingredients. I had to guess on the buttermilk and I made my own since I wasn't aware I needed any. i used about 1/4 cup of milk with a small splash of vinegar to sour the milk.

I made this again for dinner last night—perfect comfort food for wintry weather. The vegetables don't need to be finely diced; I just do a rough chop, since the pressure cooker ensures they'll be tender. I also added chunks of potatoes because I had a couple to use up. The flour-butter paste at the end is to thicken the broth and to add richness. Oh, and if you don't have buttermilk, regular milk is fine for the dumplings. I made this last batch using my stovetop pressure cooker, which is big enough for a 1.5x amount of dumplings. For the bigger batch, I just added more flour and buttermilk but kept the salt, baking powder, and butter amounts the same.

This recipe showed up on my feed and of course I had to make it.  My husband and I adjusted a few of the ingredients.  We use the instant pot all the time and I’m always impressed by how easy and tasteful things are in it.  We didn’t have buttermilk so I used regular milk.  Substituted edemame for the green beans and peas, used a can of cream of chicken soup and a cup less chicken broth.  Love it, we’ll  make this again.

Very delicious sauce And the chicken was amazingly tender.  I didn’t  use all of the buttermilk because the dumpling would have been more sloppy than for  my taste.

The flavor is amazing! The dumplings melted out flat in the last step- not sure why, my fault I’m sure! But the flavor is perfect and I’d totally make it again.

A big hit at my house last night! Did not have marjoram or green beans, so they were excluded. Added 1/2 tsp of poultry seasoning because we like the flavor it gives. Used my own dumpling recipe, which is basically the same except for milk instead of buttermilk. Loving the fact that there are more and more instant pot recipes that I can try on the site. Thanks Doughgirl8!

It is a new family fav. We ate it all with no leftovers.  I did use Bisquick instead of making them from scratch and I left out the butter with flour mixture.  It was still so good.

As mentioned by other reviewers, the broth is tasty!  I probably would've given this recipe a 5 star if the dumplings came out a little more solid. My daughter thought they were very soft potatoes. They did have a very good flavor though! I will make it again, but might experiment with different dumpling recipes.
