This is a hearty soup with just enough kick.  I had chorizo in the freezer so thought this would be a good way to use it up.  Only difference for me is I had a can of kidney beans so I threw it in.  Will make again for sure.

I bought all of the ingredients to make as written with one exception and that is beans. Beans are a must for me and chili. I started preparing as is but ended up leaving one of the 28oz. cans of tomato sauce out and replacing them with 2 small cans of chili beans and one small can of pinto beans. At that point there was plenty of tomato product going on and I ended up leaving out the tomato paste as well. Not sure if it was the Rotel or what but this had a very vinegar-y flavor going on in the end. I loved that aspect and the reason is because I grew up in Kansas City and both sides of my family added a splash of vinegar to their bowls so this was right up my alley. Mom always said it helped neutralize the grease but who knows? All I know is that I got used to having that vinegar splash and have a hard time eating chili without it. The chorizo did make this pretty oily but it added nice flavor too.

Good flavor, but I accidentally cut the tomato sauce in half, and I'm glad I did.
