Instead of drizzling melted chips over marshmallows, try melting chips with a small amount of cooking paraffin.  Keep this mixture on low heat after melted, jab each marshmallow with a fork, and hold over pan.  Drizzle this mixture over marshmallows, drop onto wax paper & fill in
tong marks on top of marshmallow with small amount of mixture. This way you have more control
over how the chocolate covers the marshmallows.

These treats were great.  I didn't use the bag or the butter.  Instead I used shortening with semi-sweet & butterscotch chips, which gave a great finish to the spiders.  Definitely enjoyed by all.

My (almost)4-year old daughter and I made these last night to take to an Assisted Living facility where the kids were going to visit for Halloween - she helped me "stuff" the legs on (great chance to practice counting!)while I did the chocolate part. I had a difficult time with the chocolate not being easy to spread/squirt out of the bag - it got thick, despite my adding more butter and even some milk. I ended up patting it on top, joking that it looked like a toupee. Used peanut butter chips for the eyes (the color matched the legs!)and they really did look cute! Lots of "oohs and aahs" from the children and residents : )

I made these for my twin 5 year olds' Kindergarten Party at school.  The kids all loved them!  Of course, I did make some changes to the recipe. . .
I used 1 bag of milk chocolate morsels and one bag on butterscotch morsels melted together in the microwave, 1/2 a pretzel stick for each leg, mini M&Ms for the eyes, and only about 1/2 of a large marshmallow for the body.
I put a dallop of chocolate on waxed paper, added the pretzel legs (so they stuck out of the chocolate), and added the candy eyes, then transferred to the freezer for a couple of minutes to harden (it doesn't take long).  After they were set (they looked like smooshed spiders-reminded me of the spiders in the Garfield comic strip after he smacks them with a newspaper!) I dipped a 1/2 a marshmallow in chocolate and set it on top of the "smashed spider" (not covering up the eyes, though!) which then gave it a "puffy spider" look.  It was rather time consuming, but it was worth it because the kids really enjoyed it!

I made this for my Cub Scout pack meeting for Oct.  They were a huge hit.  They turned out so cute.  They did take a long time to make.  I started to use the chocolate chips in the bag but it did not work good at all.  Luckly I had Almond Bark.  I turned it on low and it worked beautifully.  I poked the marshmallows with a toothpick and dipped.  I did take the extra chocolate off with the second toothpick. I just smoothed the chocolate over the hole and it looked great.

I only give this 2 stars because while it was a cute little idea, it didn't work out quite like it claimed it would.  After melting the amount of chocolate chips and butter that it called for, the chocolate was thick like frosting and would definately NOT drizzle.  I had to add much more butter and a little creamer to make it drizzle better. And putting the chocolate in the bag to be drizzled was NOT a simple task either.  It got all over the zip seal and the bag didn't close properly and ended up exploding. I think the ingredients need to be altered and maybe a gallon ziploc bag should be suggested so that it is large enough that if it won't seal, it's not going to shoot chocolate everywhere when you try to use it as a squeeze bag.  However, I do want to say that I made these for my toddler's daycare class and I was the only mother who actually made something for the party instead of buying a bag of candy to pass... the toddlers LOVED them!  So, in the long run, it was worth the hassle ;0)

This was time-consuming, very messy,  but fun treat when preparing for Halloween.  I used a couple TBLS of butter and using a knife, dipped each marshmellow into the melted choc./butter mix.  Luckily, I had a whole "assembly line" of hands ready - my boyfriend attached pretzel sticks for the legs and my daughter added the M&M eyes.  I might take the butterscotch chip suggestion into review if I ever decide to make these treats again.

My husband made these for our sons school Halloween party yesterday (while I was making the black cat cookies off of this site). These tasted awesome and looked terrific. He squished the marshmallow a bit for a more realistic body. I didnt pick up any mini m&m's thinking I could use frosting at the end. It would have worked. Instead of running out my husband hand rolled little bits of taffy into 48 little eyeballs. I figured trying to drizzle the chocolate would make a complete mess so I put the chips in a double boiler along with some candy wax and dipped them with . It went rather quickly that way. They were awesome.

Easy to make, but the first few came out ugly. Once I got the hang of it they looked nice. I had a hard time getting the balance of chocolate and butter right so that they weren't sticky - so I ended up serving them with toothpicks. I also used pretzels for legs. I ended up making the spiders, dumping the whole spider in the chocolate mix, then turning it over with a fork, and then fishing it out with the fork. The I stuck them in the freezer to harden.

I used the pretzels for the legs and it was delicious! I only gave it 2 stars because it was really cumbersome to make. I used medium sized marshmallows, and ran out of room in the middle after squishing it to insert the legs. Covering it with chocolate proved to be difficult as well because it was hard to cover the entire spider, and then I had to make sure there was not chocolate between the legs so you could tell they were legs. It may have been easier with large marshmallows, and may get easier with practice, but I do not have the time or patience to make several spiders as I had intended. It took me 15 minutes to make 3 spiders.

I burnt half a bag of chocolate before I realized this recipe wasn't going to work. Ended up having to cover the spiders with the chocolate with my fingers. I used reeses peices for eyes. They turned out really cute but the kids werent that interested in them and the legs didn't taste very good. But there are plenty of other good recipes for halloween here!

These were delicious. We used coconut crusted marshmallows. The chocolate in the bag thing didn't work for me, though. I added a little extra butter and a teaspoon of milk and drizzled it out of the measuring cup.

Cute, very sweet (!!), and extremely messy.  But, the kids LOVED making these and adding them to their spooky edible graveyard (more recipes from this site).  Great for Halloween, but I wouldn't make them at any other time.

While it is an interesting concept, I followed the recipe to every letter and it did not come out looking anything like the picture. My children have a party every year and I won't be doing these again.

The idea of this Halloween treat fascinated me. But after actually making these spiders, I will do my best to stcking to cupcakes and cookies. This recipe is difficult to make. You have to put either milk or cream to have the chocolate melt enough to drizzle. The m&m's tend to slide down on the chocolate covered marshmellow being as it is still hot. And it would probably be easier to dip the marshmellow in the chocolate instead of drizzling it on top. My advice: dont go by this recipe.

These turned out very cute.  However, I had to temper the chocolate in a double boiler and add way more butter than recipe indicated.  I just added enough until I got the desired consistency.  We also used M&Ms for the eyes!  Very easy and quick treat!!

Cute concept, but I should have read the reviews prior to starting. I had the same problem with the chocolate in the microwave as others did. I finally melted it on the stove with more butter and milk. They are currently in the fridge, hopefully they will harden! I also dropped them in the pan of melted chocolate with the help of 2 forks. That seemed to work well. Thanks for the cute idea!

I didn't really make these to eat, I wanted something fun to do with kids. The picture looked so cute but mine didn't turn out anything like it. I guess you have to be somewhat a perfectionist. The kids had fun though and I guess thats all that matters!

I didn't get to try one of these.  I didn't exactly make them like they were supposed to be decorated.  I forgot the eyes and the chocolate didn't look like the picture.  But, this was for a Halloween party and by the time I thought of trying one they were all gone.  So, apparently they were a big hit!!

I made these tonight as a snack for my boyfriend and I because I just love attempting to be festive. They were very cute, and I made about 7 of them. I ended up using the rest of the chocolate for chocolate haystack spiders. The ones I made tasted alright, but I preferred the haystacks. However, they are adorable. Thanks!

We loved these and they had the best taste. I used hersheys semi sweet chocolate morsels and it made it taste more like dark chocolate. Instead of m&m's because I didnt have any I made sugar cookie icing and put it in a sandwhich bag cut the corner a very tiny bit and put eyes on the spiders that way. It was cheaper and I had the stuff on hand. If you have trouble with the chocolate covering it all dont get discouraged because they are sooo yummy and they still look like spiders even if some of the marshmallow is showing. Enjoy

My son and my nieces made these a few weeks ago and they had a blast! The end result didn't really look like spiders but they didn't care. As soon as they were made they were gobbled up! Thanks for the fun "food project".

Agree with the microwaving the chocolate thing - it wouldn't melt right for me. Ended up just putting chocolate chips, butter and some milk in a saucepan over low heat to get right consisitancy. Once chocolate was melted everything else was smooth sailing. The kids loved the looks of them for their holloween party!

These were very time consuming, but my husband and I had fun making them for our son's class. We did make changes. The bag thing didn't work at all. So we just melted the chocolate on the stove and coated them in the pan using a fork and spoon. I won't know until tomorrow (Halloween) whether or not they are a hit, but they are very cute.

The kids had fun making these, but very messy.  They never really did look like spiders, but that didn't stop us from eating them up! We used melting chocalate, couldn't find parafin.

Used large marshmallows so we could put in 8 legs (boys are sticklers) and used skinny pretzel sticks. Red hots for eyes. Easy is a bit messy but would definitely try again. Using for Cub Scout Halloween bake sale!

I suggest using pretzel rods for legs instead of chow mein noodles.

THIS RECIPE IS A LIE!!! I made these for my 8 year old son, since his current fixation on spiders is based on his age of eight. These lies only have 6 legs. Following the recipe exactly, I made these for his school show-and-tell and when he saw them, he cried in front of the whole class. This recipe made me feel like a bad parent!!!

I gave this a 4 because it's a great recipe and there are cute. I did make some changes. As other reviewers mentioned, my chocolate took a good 2-3 mins using 45s intervals and mixing in between to melt, I did add 2 tbls butter. In the end it was super thick so while I was mixing it at the end of 3 mins time I added a little water to thin it out just a bit. I premade the marshmallow and used pretzels for the legs for the spiders on the cookie sheet covered with wax paper and piped the chocolate out of my ziplock bag over them. It was very hot so wear gloves to handle bag of chocolate. I also cut the mellows in half and used it that way instead. The picture I posted was actually a different way I tried like another reviewer posted. I just made the legs and plopped the chocolate in the center of them then placed in frig to set. Finished. No mellows. Next time I think I'll just add peanuts to the chocolate, mix it well and plop a little over the center of pretzels to look like the shape of a spider.  so it's more like peanut cluster edible spiders. Added plain m&m candies for eyes. It can b messy but that's the fun part, especially with the youngsters. Thanks for a great idea. The kids loved making them then eating them.

Meh...it was okay.  My kids think these are pretty neat to look but not super delicious.  I found this to be very messy and extremely time consuming.
