We made this for New Years Eve and thought it was excellent, however, I did change up the recipe some.  I thought that just the cream cheese and lemon juice sounded a bit bland so I instead mixed together the cream cheese, lemon juice, worcestershire, hot sauce and some cracked black pepper. Then instead of salad shrimp I used large shrimp cut into thirds.  I then made the cocktail sauce as directed.  We served with fritos scoops because it is a pretty thick dip and the crackers wanted to break.

This was a fun dish to prepare.  We used a large glass mixing bowl upside down and a smaller bowl on top to hold the shrimp dip.  We frosted both bowls, lined the bottom with large shrimp, and dotted the volcano with the canned shrimp.  Guests used the larger shrimp or crackers to get the dip.  This was a good recipe to use as inspiration to add great presentation to our luau table!

Excellent! As with any recipe the right presentation goes a long way. A beautiful platter with the dip in the middle surrounded by crackers.

Put a whole can of little shrimp in and it will be 5 stars! That's what I did and everybody loved it. Easy! Way too much sauce left over tho'and there was plenty dripping down the sides. Next time I'll halve the sauce.

I gave it a four because in South Frica we don't use cream cheese. We use mayonaise in it's placem and serve it in a halved advocdo pear. Thats what gives it the extra kick
