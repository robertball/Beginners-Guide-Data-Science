Very good! I omitted the orange in the frosting and substituted 2 tsp. vanilla extract. It worked great. One thing I would change,though. Instead of calling for "1 pound of carrots" I would just put "3 cups grated carrots" instead. I like to simplify whenever possible.

We thought this cake was fabulous.  I made these alterations:  I used two cups all purpose flour and one cup whole wheat flour, and this seemed to make the cake more dense--something I really liked.  Also, I used low-fat cream cheese for the icing.  Since this made the icing rather thin, I refrigerated the cake after frosting it, and it was fine.

I'm stingy with 5 star ratings, but this cake deserves it!  I made the batter exactly as listed except for the pumpkin pie spice.  Didn't have any, and based off of a recipe for pumpkin pie spice on this site (seriously!), I mixed into a small container 3/4 tsp each of ginger, cloves, nutmeg and about 2 tsp cinnamon.  Mixed together and it was just about perfect for 1.5 tbl of pumpkin pie spice.  PLEASE NOTE I baked this carrot cake in TWO 9" WILTON ROUND PANS, not a Bundt pan. If you choose to do this too, the baking time will be *approximately* 30 minutes.  ALSO NOTE that there is too much batter for two standard 9" pans.  I placed 3 cups of batter into each pan, spread evenly and it was about 3/4 full.  It turned out to be the perfect amount as the cake doesn't rise much.  There was enough batter left over for 4 cupcakes, which I baked for about 20-22 minutes.  Before baking in the pans and the paper cup liners, I sprayed with cooking spray, but didn't bother with flouring.  I had no problems getting my cakes out of the pans after they had cooled on racks.  I had my doubts over the coconut and pineapple in carrot cake, but I couldn't even taste the pineapple and the coconut seemed to give it that decadent bakery flavor.  This was a dense cake, moist, and just delish.  It could definitely pass for a professional bakery cake.  I paired it with the cream cheese frosting II from this site.  I made this on Saturday for Easter dinner.  Not sure if making it a day before helped i

I loved the combination of the walnuts, raisins, pineapple, and coconut. However, I thought that the cake itself was a little dry and not sweet enough for my liking. All in all, it was a good cake.

Yum!  I made this recipe for Thanksgiving at the in-laws.  I made a few substitutions based on what I like.  Such as pumpkin for applesauce and pecans for walnuts.  It turned out great!  Very moist. I have to admit I like it better with butter than frosting, but I made the Cream Cheese Frosting II (half the sugar) and so far everyone loves it.

I brought this cake to my family reunion and got a ton of compliments! I didn't have any raisins, so I left those out, and I used peach-mango applesauce, because that's what I had.  I also used Pilsbury Cream Cheese icing because I was afraid I'd screw up the icing.  It was so very moist.  Probably the best carrot cake I've ever had.  My grandmother is a baker and was saying that this should be my specialty!  My husbands family reunion is next week-end and I'll be makeing this again.

Just an average carrot cake, the icing was much better than average.  One of my 4 yr. olds liked it and the other didn't.

This is fantastic! I made it for Christmas day. I changed the raisins to golden raisins and left out the nuts, everything else was as directed. It was so moist and delicious. The frosting was superb. It tastes even better the next day.       a note; when working with baking soda as an ingredient you must mix only enough to moisten the dry ingredients, fold in the remaining raisins, coconut, and walnuts then quickly fill your cake pans. Mixing to long will result in less rise in the oven and a dense cake. Thank you Anra Lee this is heavenly good.

Do not ommit the orange in the frosting!  This was the best carrot cake frosting ever due to the amazing flavour of the orange.  This cake was delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I did turn it into a layer cake however.  I baked both cakes in a round 9inch pan for about 35 minutes each at 350 degrees.  I made 2 batches of icing just so there was a thick layer of icing between layers.  This was a beautiful cake.  Very moist.

Loved it! I halved this recipe, and made cupcakes, baked for 20 minutes. My husband won't touch nuts or raisins, so I omitted those and added a little extra coconut. Turned out perfect. Thanks

A simple and delicious carrot cake that got rave reviews by my coworkers.  It was moist, flavourful and not overly dense. Chock full of raisins, walnuts, coconut and the delicious orange cream cheese frosting, it is a fabulous cake! 

I made it exactly as written in the recipe, other than baking it a little longer, about 78 minutes total.

This cake recipe is great as it is, however; I modified it to accomedate another garden veggie, zucchini. I substituted half the carrots with zucchini. It worked very well. The frosting recipe is one of the best cream cheese frostings I have used in a while. The orange zest and juice balanced the sweetness just perfectly.

Huge hit for Christmas!  I used whole wheat pastry flour and the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe on this site.  Fabulously dense, moist and got raves from the family and made a nice presentation in the bundt format. Thanks!

The cake is very good, with loads of everything. I like to work with raw ingredients.  I think the only flaw is that the recipe omits to mention one should sift the flour. Nobody really does anymore, but air is as important an ingredient to a good cake as anything, just as adding water to anything should include filtering the water first.  A recipe is only is as good as the ingredients and this cake has many good ingredients. Add air and it's perfect.

My husband really enjoyed this recipe.  I like it as well, although it was very time consuming to make. (Hand grating the carrots, etc.)  When I'm in the mood to bake and have the time to take to make this, I will definitely make again.  I loved the frosting too!

What a great carrot cake! I made this cake for a wedding aniversary for a couple who had carrot cake for their wedding. They loved the texture with all of the extra ingredients (coconut, pineapple, raisins, walnuts). I too used a mix of whole wheat and white flour, as well as ground flax seed. I needed to thicken the frosting as I made a pan cake rather than a bundt.

Well you see I've been cooking for many years... but this recipe led me astray. I vigorously followed the indgrediants and did not come out with carrot, instead I came out with a carrot soup. I am very disappointed.

I made it, but it doesn't taste like carrot, it tastes to anything, less to carrot!  I'd like to make a carrot cake, puffy and not like a block of concrete! it seems made from left over bread. Not good to be recommended.

This was fantastic!! My family loved this! I left out the coconut because I wasn't sure about coconut in my carrot cake, and also my mom isn't a big fan of coconut. The cake was moist and the icing was great-different than the norm, a nice change! I also baked this in a 13x9 pyrex. Baking time was approximately 50 minutes. It came out perfect!! Definitely recommend this!

This is the best carrot cake I've ever had, and family and friends agree.  I made no changes to the basic recipe, however I bake it in a 9x13 cake pan for 30 minutes.  LOVE the hint of orange in the icing - however, the icing recipe isn't sufficient for this size cake so I supplement with part of a can of cream cheese frosting.  (This should be Carrot Cake Number ONE, not VIII!)

This is a great carrot cake with lots of texture, just how I like it! I used 1/2 tbs cinnamon and 1 tbs of pumpkin pie spice. I used coconut oil in place of the vegetable oil and amped up the frosting using 1 stick of salted butter and 8 oz. cream cheese and 3 cups of 10x sugar. Skipped the orange altogether. Baked in a 9x13.

Carrot flavor was too strong.  LOVED the frosting. The orange zest and juice added just the slightest hint of flavor. Very refreshing.

Very good! I did not have walnuts so I did not bother, but stuck to the rest of the recipe. I also did not bother with the icing, I thought it would be moist and sweet enough and it was. Sometimes the icing can be overpowering.  Very moist & full of flavour!

The only change I made is I candied the walnuts.  Other than that the cake came out really moist and delicious which is saying a lot for a carrot cake aficionado.  

With that said, I found the frosting to be just right!  It wasn't too sweet nor too thick.  That frosting is what a butter creme frosting is supposed to be.

Don't ruin this cake by frosting with a commercial product.  Take the time and make the frosting!

I made this for my daughter-in-law's birthday and at her request omitted the coconut.  I increased all ingredient amounts by 50% as I wanted to bake a large 3-layer, 9" cake. I had to triple the frosting ingredient amounts to make enough frosting for a triple layer cake.  The result was incredible -- moist, flavorful, dense as a carrot cake should be.  The orange zest in the frosting gave it a wonderful citrus note.  This will be a go-to recipe when I need a "WOW" dessert.

This cake is delicious and I will definitely make it again.  I made two changes.  First I made my own pumpkin pie spice using a recipe that I googled.  Second, I split the batter into two 9 x 2" round cake pans, prepared with vegetable oil and flour.  Baked at 350 degrees until a skewer came out clean.  To make a layer cake required doubling the frosting recipe.

Delicious!  Skipped the nuts and doubled the raisins.  I didn't make the frosting but opted for store bought and sprinkled it with sweetened shredded coconut.
