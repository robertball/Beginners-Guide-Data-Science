I had to laugh when I read the title of this recipe, because that is exactly what I was doing tonight . . . scavenging in my fridge for what to make for dinner tonight! I had a bowl of cauliflower that I had roasted with garlic and olive oil the other night - so I went ahead and used that in this recipe. I also used only a 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes with the juice, as that is what I had on hand. We had a busy night tonight with both of our kids winter band concerts, and I had this on the table in about 20 minutes. Our tummies were full, and we were out the door by 6:00 p.m. A nice, quick pasta dish.

It had a lot of cauliflower and the sage got kind of lost. With less cauliflower, some more seasoning and maybe some chicken thrown in would be better.

This serves way more than 4 people. I love cauliflower, but it does not belong in this dish.
