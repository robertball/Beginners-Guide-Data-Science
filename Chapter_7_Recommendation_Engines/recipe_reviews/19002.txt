I like this recipe a lot. I always use this recipe as it does not go icy and it tastes just like it's from the supermarket. I have made Lavender (use less vanilla and add 1 drop of pure lavender oil), Raspberry, and Chocolate chip cookie dough (which you cannot get in my country) all with success. be sure to fold the whipped cream in very carefully as you do not want to crush all the air out of it. Some people have complained that you get a greasy film on the top of your mouth, this is because of the fat in the cream. It can be remedied by adding other ingredients such as berries which break up the cream. Make sure to use good quality vanilla or don't be surprised that it tastes like cream and condensed milk (duh.) This ice cream freezes rock hard so be sure to take it out a bit before serving.

I made this with homemade condensed milk (made with sweetener insted of sugar), light cream and non-fat milk. I added a bit of coffee instant powder and made it in my ice-cream maker. It was just perfect! So creamy, like the italian gelatos, great taste and i don't think this could have been any better if i had used fat and sugar.

What an AWESOME recipe!  Thank you for sharing this wonderfully easy recipe.  I always wanted to make homemade ice cream, but never had an ice cream maker.  My husband is an ice creamaholic, and he said "it's so creamy"!  He wants me to make some with berries.  I would like to try making chocolate, do you have any suggestions?  I don't know if the chocolate syrup would make the consistency to soft.  Thanks again!      
PS. I have since made another batch and split it up.  One batch I used fresh blueberries (not good, they were like little pellets) it would probably be much better if they had been cooked.  Good news though...I put some Chocolate flavored Ovaltine in the other batch and it turned out FANTASTIC!   YUMMMMMMMMM!  :o)

This recipe is so easy yet so delicious! I wanted to switch it up a bit and try mint chocolate chip ice cream, so I used peppermint extract instead of vanilla, added 2/3 cup miniature chocolate chips, and a few drops of green food coloring. It was fantastic!

Wow!! Great recipe! The kids and I made it this afternoon and it was a real treat as well as a welcome activity on a hot day. I used all half-and-half instead of the cream and milk, and it turned out just fine. The texture was wonderful, and the condensed milk made it plenty sweet enough. We will certainly make this again!

I thought this was excellent. Keeping my fingers crossed it would turn out ok, I used light condensed milk, one carton of full fat heavy cream and one of half fat heavy cream. It worked and I didn't think it was too sweet. At the 2 hour stirring point I added in cookie dough for ice cream also from this site.As other reviewers have mentioned it does freeze very hard so it does need to sit out for a while before serving. Many Thanks.

The Best. The best. The best!!!!!  I would give this 100 stars if this site had that many stars as an option!  Please try this.  It rivals the best restaurant or ice cream stand custards that you can find.  Believe me; I'm from Rochester NY, the home of the famous Abbotts Ice Cream Custard.  This is just as good.  Easy.  No heavy machinery needed.  Economical.  Delicious.

It may be personal preference, but I was disappointed. The taste was ok; however, I grew up making homemade ice cream in the old hand-churned makers and this just did not compare.  Tasted alot like frozen whipped cream, which probably shouldn't have been a surprise to me since in essence that's what the recipe is.  Worth a shot I guess if you don't own an ice cream maker, but if you're a true ice cream lover I suggest just buying one and making the real deal.

I used an ice cream maker for this.., mine holds 1 & 1/2 quarts & this recipe filled it to capacity. I was out of heavy cream so I subbed some evaporated milk instead. The can wasn't quite 2 cups so I added additional milk (2% organic). This ice cream was good but too sweet. I thought it tasted just like frozen sweetened condensed milk. Now, I have been known to eat a spoonful or two but a whole bowl is a bit much, even for me. ;o) I crushed up some M&M's & topped my hubby & grandson's bowl w/ that...I chose to go w/ mini-chocolate chips & toffee bits on mine. As easy as this was, w/ so few ingredients, I am sure I will make this again but I will cut back on the sweetened condensed milk....thanks Alisha!

I used evaporated milk instead of ordinary milk. Really rich and creamy. States better than some of the store bought stuff. Instant hit.

Awesome recipe. I omitted the vanilla, added peppermint extract, crashed semi-sweet baking chocolate and a couple dashes of green food coloring. Silky smooth and not icy at all!

This was my first time at ice-cream making and I must admit without using an ice cream maker I couldn't tell the difference. It was the perfect consistency, flavor (which I added fresh strawberries chopped up and also marinated strawberries that had sat in a tbsp of sugar for a few hours). This was a extremely easy and fun to make with my two girls.

Quick, easy, and delicious.  My daughter said you could taste all the ingredients and that she liked it much better than store bought ice cream - that says much considering she is super picky.

I followed the recipe as stated.  It made a wonderful dessert and was very easy to put together.  Try to eat it all the day you make it as I found that the ice cream consistancy wasn't as creamy after being frozen for several days.

Very good!  I followed the recipe ingredients exactly but used my ice ceram maker.  I just bought an ice cream attachment for my KitchenAid stand mixer and was dying to use it but wanted to try something simple at first.  This is a wonderful base ice cream that could be made into so much more...or just left at vanilla.

This is the BEST ice cream I've ever had.  It's easy to make and tastes great.  We sometimes add freeze-dried strawberries or crumbled Oreos for a different flavor.

I can't believe how absolutely delicious this ice cream is!!  I did substitute 1/2 and 1/2 for the heavy cream and the milk (I guess that makes it a 4 ingredient ice cream) like another reviewer suggested but it was still fabulous.  I also used my small ice cream maker.  I will make this again and again.  I'm so happy to have this recipe.  Thanks!

Taste was very good.  My only recomendation to possibly make it better is to check it long before 2hrs. to see if the edges are hardening to stir.  If I would have done that I believe the texture would have been better.  Regardless though I will definatly be making this again and again.

I made this with 4% fat soy milk instead of the 1/2 cup of milk and 1 pint of heavy cream.  I only wisked all the ingredients together well, and didn't bother beating at all.  After I put the mixture into my ice cream machine and turned it on, I then peeled 3 ripe bananas and mushed them up with the juice of 1/2 a lemon.  When the ice cream began to harden, I added the banana mixture.  Shortly before removing the ice cream from the machine, I added 1/2 cup toasted coconut.  This is/was delicious.  I will make this recipe often.  It was sooooo creamy and tasty!!!  I may never use cream or milk again!

Excellent recipe. Ice cream was very tasty. I used the recipe to make ice cream in coffee cans while camping. A great recipe for making ice cream while camping. Also great because the ingredients are so simple and it's so easy to throw together. Will definitely make again. I even had to pass the recipe along to family members!

Very quick and easy.  I took another reviewer's advice and added peppermint extract, green food coloring, and mini chocolate chips to make a mint-chip flavor.  I HAVLED the peppermint extract to 1/2 tsp. - and it was still a strange taste.  I will make this again with this variation - but will use pure MINT extract next time.  The peppermint would have been good - but with red food coloring and crushed peppermint!  I served the mint variation I made on top of warm brownies....but would have been much better with MINT extract.  Thanks for the base idea!!!!  Will use when I need a special topping for those special desserts - as well as a true peppermint variety around Christmastime!

Delicious! I doubled the recipe & split it into to containers to freeze -- added choc chips to one. Took much longer than 4 hrs to freeze to a good "ice cream" consistency...but it was fantastic. Great flavor! So incredibly easy!

This was pretty good. I added a little more vanilla. I'd make this again, but would add something to it (maybe crushed sandwich cookies).

Perfect and easy vanilla base to which you can add anything you want! I love adding candied pecans or almonds, Skor bits and toasted coconut. You could add cocoa or any flavored extract to change the base flavor, aswell. What a wonderful and versatile recipe! I've done this both with and without a machine. Without a machine I found it froze up a tad bit icy (texture was a bit off) but in the machine it was smooth and creamy. I've also made this using light cream to cut calories and noticed no textural difference when made in the machine, however, it didn't quite turn out when I tied it without the machine. Either way, it always tastes great!

This was delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly & the results were great. Super easy, too. Next time, I will use vanilla bean paste instead of extract & will also experiment with batches of chocolate, strawberry, crushed cookies, and mint chocolate chip. This reciped made 3 pints for under $5, which is cheaper than the brand name premium pints that include mystery ingredients such as "natural flavor", whatever that is!

Awesome! I added about a tsp of Almond Extract and finished the required T with vanilla. Also added fresh peaches for summer peach ice cream. Tastes better than Cold Stone Creamery or Marble Slab ice cream stores! Can't wait to try more flavor ideas. Maybe some Dates and chopped maraschino cherries!

This ice cream was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!  I couldn't believe how simple and fast it was to make and yet tasted SO good!  I went strictly by the recipe except for using 1 tbsp vanilla bean paste instead of extract and I also added in crumbled Oreo cookies, which was great because they still stayed crunchy, unlike store bought ice cream.  I took this ice cream to a party and everyone loved it!  I will definitely make it again, in different variations.

Really creamy and smooth.  My husband said it reminded him of Ben & Jerry's vanilla.  I stirred it every hour and a half, until it got too firm to stir.  Loved it!

This is very easy and a great recipe. I added a shot or two of Bailey's Salted Caramel liquor and WOW it is good! Keeps it from freezing rock hard too. Taste the mix before you freeze it and add more or less for what you like. The stirring step after 2 hours is important for the texture.
I only whipped the cream until it was a bit thick and not stiff peaks so the other ingredients would blend in easier.

First time, easy, cheaper than buying ice cream. Tastes delicious. I added a powdered white chocolate raspberry daquiri mix to this when I folded in the milk. I also added some chopped up raspberries. Will make again and again and I will experiment with flavors. It is great.

We added mint extract (less than 1 tbsp and it was a little heavy) and choc chips.  Was more of a shake, even in our ice cream maker, but good.  Used Whole milk, but fat free half and half

Just put my 3rd batch in the freezer. 1st I left plain and was yummie. 2nd split it and added GS Thin Mint cookies crumbled. To die for. I might try crumbled Reese's Peanutbutter Cups in 1/2 of this batch. It is so easy and you can add just about anything to it for flavor and texture. A hit with my husband.

Best & easiest ice-cream EVER!! My partner is an ice-cream person, and loves this recipe. I made half with chopped strawberries and honey (instead of vanilla extract), and the other half with chopped chocolate, mint extract (instead of vanilla) and a few drops of green food coloring (although it wasn't necessary). The strawberry got rock hard I think because of the strawberries, but I just had to remember to take it out of the freezer 20 minutes before eating it. I used low fat milk, and didn't think it had too much fat.  DELICIOUS, can't wait to keep trying different flavors. This is a great basic recipe, go wild! :)

This was an interesting experiment...after four hours in a 9x13 2-quart dish, it wasn't near an ice cream consistency. After 6+ hours, it was a bit better, but wasn't close to what I think of as ice cream. My husband and daughter ate some anyway and said it tasted like the soft-serve at Sonic and suggested that we add things to it to make it like their Sonic Blasts. I'm not sure if it's worth the effort to try again...I feel like I'd be better served to buy an ice cream maker.

First time I made homemade ice cream, I used this recipe. Easy and fun to make. I made it exactly as stated. Better than store bought, especially since you control what goes in. Like some reviewers said it was too sweet for me, however, what is too sweet for me may not be so to another person.

Tastes great, easy to make, and flexible!  Winning combination!!  I added 1 T hot cocoa mix to make it slightly chocolate.  The kids had fun helping me make it and helping me eat it.

This is a wonderful alternative to an ice cream maker.  I did not deviate from the recipe and it turned out delicious.  The recipe is looking for stiff peaks to form when beating ingredients together; when I made this recipe, I never saw the stiff peaks, but it still turned out great.  I used frozen blueberries and strawberries.  I may never buy ice cream again.

Absolutely delicious!  I agree with the previous review:  it reminds me of gelato, the Italian ice cream.  It took about 10 minutes to prepare, too!  What a treat.  It does leave a film on the top of your mouth, but, the main ingredient is HEAVY whipping cream!  What would you expect?

The colour was right. The texture perfect. But unfortunately it didn't taste so good. I could taste the condensed milk and the cream. It was hard to eat cause it was soo sweet, too sweet. And not at all that nice. It left a scratchy feeling at the back of my throat. Won't make it again.

It is was my first time making ice cream and my daughter said it was the best she ever tasted.  After eating a bowlful, it left a greasey taste on the roof of my mouth, it was still the best ice cream I ever had.

We didn't think this was as smooth as ice cream, but it was pretty good! I added "cookie dough for ice cream (eggless)" from this site. Very delicious together! I like the fact that I don't have to use an ice cream maker! Thanks for the recipe!

Mine didn't set anywhere nearly as firmly as regular ice cream, but the flavor was absolutely out of this world. I followed the recipe as written, then divided the ice cream into 3 storage containers. I made one into mint choc chip, another into choc choc chip, and the third I left plain. Delicious! Thank you, Alisha!

Excellent recipe.  I have been looking for an easy but delicious vanilla base ice cream, and couldn't be happier with the results.  So simple to make, and the results were so creamy and not as sweet as custard based ones.  

I made the refridgeration version, and it seemed to be fool-proof.  I will be trying this with strawberries and cookies next....try it for yourself.  Makes the perfect amount to share and even my husband thought it was from the Supermarket! 

Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

I made this recipe while camping w/ one of those new camping roller ball ice cream makers. It worked great. I used half and half instead of the milk and heavy cream. Added some cookies that had been crushed on the way to the campsite. Turned out great and was a fun treat on a very hot day on the beach.

Disappointing.  I regularly make custard style, so maybe I'm used to that.  The texture was good, but the flavor of condensed milk was overpowering.  I'd suggest making this chocolate flavored instead of vanilla to cover the condensed milk flavor.

The BEST ice cream recipe!!! I have tried a lot of them, and this is the best. So easy, I loved not having to heat anything in a saucepan. Worked great in my ice cream maker. Most recipes I've tried turn icy after being in the freezer a while- this did not- stayed light and creamy. My husband couldn't believe it was home made! Thanks!!

I used a little less of the condensed milk (the containers available were smaller than the recipe called for, & I refuse to leave a partial container of something that won't get used right away), and it turned out great.  We split the batch and threw in some whole strawberries, then swirled the 2 flavours together for freezing....which turned out divine!

The flavor was not bad. It did taste like vanilla ice cream. But I had a hard time with it because I couldn't mix the whipped cream and condensed milk mixture very well. It ended up being the condensed milk on the bottom with a layer of whipped cream.

I followed the directions exactly, and this came out really wonderful.  I paired it with an apple pie cake (yes, you read that correctly), and it very nice.  Some of the other posters noted the ice cream came out hard, but it didn't turn out that way for me.  It was smooth and creamy.  I suspect it's a matter of how well you whip the cream and fold in the milk mixture.  Folding can be difficult.  As others have said, use real vanilla and not imitation.  This will give you full flavor.  I'm going to try to some other flavorings next, including one made with chocolate ganache.

I love this recipe because it doesn't have ingredients that I can't spell like the ice cream containers at the store do, and it was delicious and easy to make.
Just be care full not to over whip the cream or you will have butter.

Excellent!  The only change I made was adding a tsp of Cinnamon which made it extra special.

Impressive! I must say. I add'd the juice of one lemon, as well 1tsp of lemon flavoring extract. Guess that doesn't make it vanilla anymore..lol..Also, I add'd a few drops of yellow food coloring. It was awesome! The color was perfect. So perfect, my family didn't not believe it was really homemade. LOVE IT!

The first time, I followed the recipe exactly. It turned out great, but you could really taste the sweetened condensed milk. The second time, I used half&half instead of the cream, 1/4 tsp salt, and just wisked everything together before adding it to my ice cream maker. After about 20 minutes, I added 8 chopped up Oreos-- and WOW! It was AMAZING! Better than the store bought cookies and cream by far,  and soooo easy!

just made this ice cream. very creamy and easy! I put mine in my ice cream maker which made it especially easy. One I left without adding anything (which I should have added more vanilla to it) the second one I put mint flavoring and chocolate chips in. very good.

Wonderful recipe! I had to beat the cream by hand, but it was easier than I thought.  I divided the batch into one half to which I added a cup of chopped strawberries and a touch of honey, and one half to which I added two tbs of instant coffee dissolved in a tablespoon of water... both are incredibly delicious, and it's so easy to make! One of the best recipes I've found in this site, I'll be making this all summer!

AWESOME!! AWESOME!! My 5yr old has asked for this eversince I made it the first time. I crushed up mini oreos and added it to the cream mixture and we ate the cream mixture before it was frozen and then when it froze up, ate it right out of the bowl!! I'm going to have so much fun finding different flavors!!

Delicious and super easy!  I took it to a church dinner and everyone raved about how creamy and perfect it was.  Not too sweet and not grainy at all.  Easy to make different flavors, too.

Wow! What a treat and so easy.  I added 2 cups crushed frozen strawberries, otherwise made as written.  I'll be making this many times this summer since I stocked up on Eagle Brand Condensed Milk that was "close dated" 4/$1.00 today.  Think I'll make it for the block party!  Will plan to try adding other fruits as they come in season and other ingredients, too.  thanks, so much for sharing this great recipe.

I had a similar recipe 20 years ago for Oreo Ice Cream, but lost it when we moved. I made the "Mint Chocolate Chip" version of this ice cream today. The result was perfect! Creamy, not at all whipped cream tasting, and not at all hard! I scraped it up after two hours (it was almost set at that point) and put it back in the freezer. Two hours later I scopped it into 2 plastic quart containers with tight lids. I can't wait to experiment-the possibilities are endless, just by changing the flavor of extracts and adding whatever you crave! Thanks for a great recipe!

This really was good.  Made for a birthday party since we don't buy icecream. My icecream freezer bowl doesn't fit in the stocked freezer so I needed something that didn't need the icecream maker. All the kids and adults loved it,followed the recipe and the texture was good, certainly sweet- but tasty. Yum, will make again.

This was a very fun and easy dish! I am a nanny and made it with a 18 month old and a 4 year old and it was fun for everyone. We added coconut cream and chopped chocolate chips and called it " Dirty Snow"   Now we make it every snow day!

DELICIOUS!!!  I am not a big ice cream fan, but this is absolutely divine.  My husband agrees wholeheartedly and told me I can never get store-bought ice cream again.  I did not have the problem some others noted about it freezing rock solid.  Mine was in the freezer overnight and this morning it was the perfect ice cream consistency.  Maybe something to do with how long the cream is whipped???  I am looking forward to experimenting with other flavors.  Thanks!

Everyone should try out this recipe, this ice cream will be the best you have ever had, and it was so easy to make.  The only this i did different was, i used the vanilla extract, and a whole vanilla bean.  This ice cream is to die for, it's so creamy and easy!!  Yummy!!

Incredibly easy to make, but a bit too creamy for my taste.  Perhaps using light cream or skim milk would better suit me?  I'm not sure.  It also froze so hard to the point where I had to microwave it a little to get a scoop in.

I usually don't think of homemade ice cream as tasting as good as the store bought kind (too icy and runny) but this is fantastic!!! I think I'll try other reviewers ideas for different flavors next time I make this. (And I will make it again)

A really good ice cream recipe. The base was really easy to make. 

I followed another reviewer and added peppermint extract and mini chocolate chips to mine. However, the chips sink to the bottom, so you'll have to stir it after a few hours when the mixture is softened to really disperse the chips fully. So, if you add anything like chips, nuts, or fruit, be sure to stir the mixture again before it completely hardens.

When it comes to freezing, it really depends on your own freezer. If store-brought ice cream hardens in your freezer, then this will to. I have a second standalone freezer that freezes ice cream rock solid, whereas the freezer with my fridge keeps ice cream a little on the soft side.

Too much preparation time. Very sweet and I think you could cut down on the vanilla.

It was my first time making ice cream at home. I followed this recipe, almost the same, except I used a bit more cream, and I am so happy with the results!! I divided the mixture into four containers and added chocolate powder, green tea powder, melted peanut butter, and granulated coffee, respectively. I love all of them!! Thank you for the recipe!

Doubled the ingredients and......Simple and DELICIOUS! We added peanuts, crushed cookies, peanut butter chips for some crunch :-) 
Only recommendation I can make is if you add all the extra heavy ingredients then you'll have to stir more than once passed the 2hr mark otherwise everything sinks to the bottom.

We recommend after 2hr stir, 3rd hr stir again, 4-6th hr stir again but flip over this time and let it set for the night.

My family and coworkers really like this recipe. It's very creamy and has a wonderful flavor. We've made this and served it with cobblers that our scouts make, and there's never any left over. Sometimes I will add 2 cups of pureed fruit to it before freezing. We've tried mango, peaches, and strawberries, and my coworkers like the mango best. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Delicious! Stirred every hour and it didn't freeze super hard. Now I need to make a whole bunch of different flavors! :)
