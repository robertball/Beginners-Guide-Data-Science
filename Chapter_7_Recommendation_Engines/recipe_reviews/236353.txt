This is a perfect dish for summer! I added a little bit more of the tarragon and the lemon juice and used coconut oil instead of olive and it all helped add such lovely flavors to this.

We used leftover cold cubed salmon and it worked. Tarragon & Lemon brought freshness but maybe some lemon Pepper next time to punch it up a bit. Will make a great cold leftover salad today for lunch

Love the Barilla Plus Rotini in this! Always looking for a great salmon recipe and this will now be added to my regular mix. Added more lemon for flavor and was a big hit with the family.

Very good and tasty. I made it for dinner and had leftovers for lunch today, even better today. The tarragon works real well with the Salmon. I will make it again. I also like the Barilla Plus Rotini which helped to make this a bit healthier and tasted great. This is a keeper!

This recipe wasn't horrible, but nobody in my family enjoyed it. Honestly, it didn't have much taste. We've been trying low-sodium recipes for the past week, and this was the least liked so far.

There are a couple of things that I would try next time. The little sauce that we were able to create tasted amazing, but it just didn't go very far. Next time, I would deglaze the pan with a little white wine, and might let the tomatoes stew down for 5-6 minutes instead. Definitely add a little more lemon to help accent the taste of the salmon, and this would end up being a 4-5 star recipe.

We really enjoyed this one!  The lemon is of course perfect with the salmon.  Do be careful with cooking times on the gluten-free pasta (we used the Barilla gluten-free rotini);  too long or too short a cooking time leaves an unpleasant texture.  I discovered I'm not a fresh tarragon fan and next time I'll try this recipe with dill!

I loved this recipe but I think it is an acquired taste due to the flavor of the tarragon.  As tarragon has a black licorice flavor there are many people that do not like it.  Next time I would substitute thyme in its place.  I used salmon steaks with the skin on and did not crumble it up in the pasta.  I thought that the presentation was much nicer this way and it allowed people that were not crazy about salmon to eat it without.  I thought it had great flavor and will definitely make it again.

Like the other reviewers, I felt that this needed a little more flavor.  I might try adding garlic or lemon-pepper next time.

I was dissapointed. I may try again with modification, and serve chilled as I did not like it hot.
