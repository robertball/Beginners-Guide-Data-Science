Make a batch of this for a real time (and money) saver! I use it on fish, but I'll bet it's great on potatoes and lentils too!

I love this! I am out of thyme...have lots of fresh, but no dried, but even without it, it's great. The smoked paprika is the key, I think. Next time I shop, I'll pick up some dried thyme and add it to the mix.

This is a great blend! I put it on potatoes and they were fantastic, can't wait to try it on other things. I used regular paprika but I'm sure smoked would be better. Nice not having to waste money and a trip to the store on something that would be less tasty and full of MSG anyway!

I don't know what I did wrong here, but I didn't really love this seasoned salt. It kind of just tasted like salt, but with a bitter bite. The large pieces of thyme seemed odd in it, so I ran it in the blender about 10 seconds or so. That did help with appearance. I tried using it in a recipe, but the flavor was not there like with the store bought kind. I almost wonder what they add differently. I made 1/2 recipe and it was enough to fill a standard sized spice jar.

This is tasty enough, as is. I haven't actually used it in a recipe yet. My usual use of seasoned salt is on grilled potatoes, and this should work well. It's certainly much less expensive to mix this up with spices I generally have on hand.

This was very good and nice that it had no MSG.  I was looking for it because I wanted to make Chex Mix and didn't the right salt.  Tasted great!

This is a great mixture!  The smoked Paprika is a really nice touch.  I've used it in hamburger steaks, saut√©ed onions and mashed potatoes.  I can't wait to try it on more foods!

I substituted Stevia for the sugar and this is much better than the well known seasoned salt.

Great seasoning recipe! It's better than any store bought seasoning salt. I use this on breakfast eggs and baked chicken routinely. I cut the recipe to a third so that I can fit the batch into a regular sized salt shaker.

remember folks, seasoned salt is going to be basically as salty as pure salt. this is a great alternative for us that love Lawreys classic recipe but want to control the quality of our ingredients. great tasting stuff!

Seasoning Salt has many forms. Smoked Paprika takes the place of Cayenne Pepper or  Ground Red Pepper...which could be added here if desired. I reduce the salt by about 40% by choice.

I read the reviews before I made it & disregarded the "too salty" reviews. In hindsight I shouldn't have. I just dipped my finger in it for a taste & immediately knew it was too much & I'm still tasting it 30 minutes later. Flavor itself was marginal for me, but that's personal preference.

It tasted a bit different, but in a good way!
