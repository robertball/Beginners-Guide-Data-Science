I thought the recipe looked delicious, so I read some of the reviews. I can understand that recipes can be very subjective to individual tastes, so an alteration or a variation expressed here can be very helpful. However, every recipe I try on here for the first time, I make exactly as the recipe calls for. I feel that gives the recipe and the cook a fair shake at what they are tasting. It also gives me a starting point after that, to try some of the alternative variations. So I'm perplexed at rude or negative comments that usually come from trying this recipe other than "as called for", then the reviewer says it's a terrible or less than desirable recipe, that they will never try again. However, if you hadn't made the recipe "as called for", it was then really your own recipe, and therefore should not reflect negatively on the author . That said, I found this recipe to be very delicious, but just a little to moist. My oven is a bit dated, so it could have been just not baked evenly. The next time I made this, I baked it for 40 minutes with the foil on. Then I took the foil off, and then let it bake for another 10 minute with the foil off. That seemed to  make the texture a little more crisp, which was more to my liking.  Great share. I will definitely be making this again!!!

I've tried other tater tot casseroles and felt they were really bland!  Not this one tough!!!  Loved the extra added touches of Montreal seasoning and Worcheshire sauce.  I added fresh sautéed mushrooms and it was a hit!  Thanks!

Excellent I did not change a thing. Leave in the milk.  The bottom layer of tots, what a grand slam, I layered the bottom of my round baking dish, maybe adding a few more then the recipe.  All summer I feed baseball players from Latin countries. The decision to go way back 25+ years when I was a single Mom with boys making affordable meals, I was not sure how my meat and rice hearty eaters would like such a foreign dish. The added cheese put it over the wall. This dish was a homerun! How ya like my baseball references? I think it describes food just right!

My family loves this recipe. The only thing that I changed was cooking the whole bag of tater tots for about fifteen minutes. I mashed all of them in the bottom of the casserole dish and then took out about half maybe a little more of the mashed tots. Left just enough to form a layer on the bottom. After my beef was cooked and drained I added the soup mixture, poured it over the bottom later of tots and then spread the remain tots on top. I had some extra tots so I put a few whole tots along the edges and middle. I cook it on 400 for 40 minutes and then put the cheese on and cook for about 10 or 15 more minutes. For me, this made the tots crispier and not as soggy with the cheese cooking on them the whole time.

I made this tonight and there is none left.  Followed the recipe exactly and it was not soupy.  My daughter popped in about an hour after we ate and had two helpings plus took what little there was left for her lunch the next day.  This will be a staple in our household and definitely going in the recipe box!!

Made this tonight and looks as though it's going to be a family regular as it was a big hit. Made it as stated except added sour cream instead of milk. Fantastic but I think I'll throw some french cut green beans in next time.

Excellent! Instead of a layer of tator tots on the bottom, I used frozen hash brown patties.

Excellent recipe! There is very little left after just my husband and I eat dinner. I make this in large batches and put three to four in the freezer for later, just thaw in the refrigerator and bake as directed. It makes for wonderful meals when we are to busy to cook.

This is the best Tater Tot casserole recipe on AR. Having said that, of course I tweaked in true AR fashion. My changes included adding soy sauce to the soup mixture, and stirring the meat in as well rather than layering it. I also added some canned French fried onions to the soup mixture and sprinkled some on top.  I live alone and though this was a big pan of food, I polished it off by myself in three days!!

Need to use 30 instead of 20 tater tots on the bottom to fully cover it. Great taste.

I make this recipe with Campbells golden mushroom soup and the French's fried onions. It's much tastier with the golden. The fried onions give it a lot more flavor.

I followed this recipe exact, except I didn't use frozen tots . I substituted frozen southern style hash browns with onion and bell peppers ( I already had them on hand).  This recipe was a Home-run hit with my family. Most  tator tot  casseroles are bland and just subpar. The Montreal steak seasoning  and Worcestershire  sauce is what sets this recipe apart from other casseroles.  We will continue making this recipe for years to come.

Excellent recipe! I did substitute sour cream for the milk to make it less soupy, my hard to please family loved it. The neighbors even poked their noses over the porch to ask what I was making because it smelled so good. A definite hit!

Really tasty and really simple to make.  The one thing that I didn't care for was how "wet or soupy" (no pun intended) the mushroom soup layer was even after baking for 45 minutes.  In the future, I will just eliminate the added milk (or at least cut it back), and I think that may be the answer to the issue.  Just some good old-fashioned  comfort food that should make everybody in the family  happy!  Kristy, thanks for sharing your recipe.  We all need to have a few casseroles like this stashed away in our recipe boxes.

I changed a few things. I had to use cream of chicken because I didn't have mushroom.  Omitted the Worcestershire sauce only because I don't like the taste of it. And then I added precooked bacon under the cheese. The kids loved it! I'm sure they will ask for it again! Great recipe and so easy to make!

The techniques in the recipe make the difference.  Parbaking the tots, layering the ingredients, and a generous amount of spices take this from dreary cafeteria food to lovely comfort food.   I did use Mrs. Dash garlic and herbs instead of Montreal seasoning, and dried onions bc I was out of fresh. I probably upped the milk to a little over a cup as well.  Delicious and enthusiastically endorsed by picky kids and adults.

We like this very much. I had to change the cheese to mozzarella as that's what I had. Almost better. One time I only had ground turkey& that was great, too. I was out of Worcestershire so I subbed in chili sauce one time. Thank you! Family favorite. Here in MN it's 'hotdish' not casserole but a tasty dish either way.

After making this several times I've found ways to make it more delicious and easier to make! While the meat is browning I add 1-2 cloves of minced garlic plus the onion. Then I mix the meat, herbs, etc and throw in a large container of fresh cut mushrooms and stir together. Once the meat is done, strain the grease and throw that into the bowl. Then add the extra things (you would add to the meat in OG recipe), mix and pour over bottom tots. Then top with remaining tots and we put lots of cheese on top (because we LOVE cheese!). It takes steps out of the recipe and saves your sanity (and dishwashing). It's such a great recipe when it's fresh and even better when it's eaten for leftovers! If you haven't yet made this, you need to :)

Shame on me. I replaced the milk with heavy cream. Me, "What do you think of it." (Very picky) husband, "I love it." I suggest he refer to it as 'That Awesome Tater Tot Stuff' when he wants it again. So easy. Fool proof.

This came out amazing, and I was actually surprised. I have 7 kids still at home and they all cleaned their plates. I had to make a few substitutions, but I'm glad I did. First I was a little short on the pound of hamburger so I added in about a cup of frozen carrots when I browned the meat. Second, I didn't have any cream of mushroom soup on hand so I used the same amount of Alfredo sauce with bacon added. Last of all I used onion tater tots instead. I'm not really fond of mushroom soup in recipes because of the lack of flavor and the unappetizing color anyway, so the substitution turned out to be delicious. You can really use any type of cheese you love for shredding on top and also I would recommend using a liittle more than 20 tots for the bottom in order to cover the bottom well. This recipe is definately a keeper with the substitutions and next time I think I'll double the recipe so I'll have enough for our large family.

This only received so-so reviews at the table.  I followed the recipe as written without the Montreal Seasoning because we didn't have any.  Prep time was quick and easy.  I didn't like that the sauce was gray.   It just looked unappetizing.  I mistakenly mixed the meat and sauce together before putting it in the pan and actually felt it could have used a little more sauce.  

Overall between the color and the really heavy Worcestershire taste I just wasn't fond if it.  My teen son, on the other hand, though it was excellent and finished off the leftovers the next day.  I don't think I'll make this version again.

My gluten free version was soupy due to the soup not being condensed; not the recipe's fault.  I did use some sour cream to try to thicken the soup.  The flavor was delicious.  I had to use mashed potatoes on the bottom to avoid going to the store, so my advice there is to make them much drier than you normally would.  I would make this again.

Comfort food. I never have steak seasoning so I didn’t use it. I’m a salt and pepper and garlic powder guy. Added some A1 and canned green beans with fresh cracked pepper. Turns out great.

I used bbq sauce instead if w-sauce(didn't have any) And I mashed the bottom of the tots with some butter and one egg, pressed it down and broiled it for five minutes and then layered the meat, sauce and cheese.  Sprinkles some chili pepper on top for colour.

I made this casserole for my son and hubby this past weekend. I normally add my own touches to recipes but this one sounded like it didn't need any changes. To my complete surprise, it is absolutely perfect as written. I would not change a thing. The guys loved it and requested that I make this again soon. Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

The only thing I did was add some mushrooms to it. The flavor of this dish is so good.

I made the recipe as it reads minus the steak seasoning since I didn't have any on hand.  I also added a bag of mixed veggies on top of the meat before adding the sauce. My family loved it!

Great dish! My husband loved it. I made it with chorizo instead of the ground beef. It was absolutely great and I will continue to use chorizo since it gives it a tasty kick for those who like things a little spicy as my husband does!

The version I make has sautéed celery also and no Worcestershire. You can also use cream of chicken or celery soup. Our favorite is cream of chicken. We love this casserole!  So easy and versatile!  Try it?

it was ok...deep-frying the tots might make them better then just melt the cheese in the oven....the steak seasoning and garlic were too much if which is a big if i make it again ill cut the spices in half...instinct tells me some spurn cream could be a good addition too...may try it with leftovers to kill some of the steak seasoning taste....kids only picked off the cheese n tots

I have made this a few times. The first time seemed dry, so I started using two cans of the cream of mushroom and covering the whole top in cheese. Simple and delicious.

For maybe the first time ever, I made a recipe exactly as written..... Well, I did add some fresh parsley to the seasonings.... But that hardly counts.  Either way, this is an excellent dish as written and will take modifications like fresh mushrooms or green beans easily.  I don't understand the negative reviews, at all.   They either didn't follow the recipe (as many admitted, they used substitute seasoning) or they simply have a mouth full of faulty taste buds.  Easy and delicious and the Mister went back for thirds!  Thanks!

I followed the recipe the only thing I changed was A1 sauce for steak seasoning. It’s delicious reminds me of hash brown casserole. I also added a tablespoon of sour cream.

Love it. Only thing I did different was put in all the cheese and all the Worcestershire sauce together instead of splitting it like the instructions said. It turned out just fine without splitting the Worcestershire sauce into two different parts and the cheese too. Mix it all up less fuss and going back to direction over and over.

This is my favorite recipe I've made in ages.  I try new recipes all the time (mostly from Allrecipes), but  rarely do I rate them
but this one I had to.  I followed  the recipe exactly, changing
nothing.  I can't wait to make it again the same way.  Perfect

This is a classic. The Montreal Seasoning and worchester add a great flavor. I omit the black pepper because I feel there is enough pepper in the Montreal Seasoning. The best part is the crunchy tator tot crust on the bottom.  Mmmmm!

I have been playing with cooking, as it’s new for me. I’ve made dishes with ribeye, shrimp, and salmon and this is the one my husband raved about the most! Lol

The family LOVED it! I added a package of sliced mushrooms and cooked it with the meat mixture. Also, I just mixed the soup mixture with the meat mixture instead of layering it. I used 96/4 ground beef and 98% fat free condensed mushroom soup only because I'm cooking healthier, which worked out great! I will definitely be making this again-yum! Thanks for sharing

I was looking through all of the tater tot casserole recipes and came across this one.  It was different from all the others and I decided to give it a try.  It is very flavorful and delicious!  I added more tater tots to the bottom of the dish (probably 30-33 tots).  I also added more cheddar cheese on top.  I used an 8 oz  block for the whole recipe.  1/2 cup in the meat mixture and the rest on top 15 minutes before the dish was done.  The steak seasoning made it really tasty.  This recipe is a keeper!

EVERYONE loved it, and for a picky family, that says a lot!  The only thing I changed was the amount of tots that I placed on the bottom (about 35), and then plenty on top to cover the dish.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as written.  A keeper for sure!

20 smashed tater tots is insufficient amount to cover the bottom of the 13x9 dish called for in the recipe. As a result the 800 g bag of tater tots I purchased, was insufficient to cover the top of the casserole sufficiently. (In Canada food is sold in grams not ounces so I have no idea if the bags are the same size). Also, I would recommend heating the mushroom soup mixture slightly to make it easier to "pour" over the beef mixture.  And, I added mixed vegetables to the beef mixture to make it a more rounded meal. 

I would make this again, making certain to buy enough tater tots to get the desired coverage.

I love this recipe because everything in it is always available in my kitchen and it's an easy pleaser. I've made it several times and it tastes yummy as written. I've also left out the onions (since they sometimes don't agree with me)  and it still tasted great. I serve it on a plate with some mixed veggies and it's a great meal. The other thing I've done is substitute the ground beef with breakfast sausage and added sausage pan gravy instead of mushroom soup & milk, which makes a great brunch casserole to serve with eggs.

Very delicious casserole.  Decided it needed 2 cans of soup to add more moisture.  Used cream of mushroom and cream of celery.  Great combination.  Also, added some green beans.  great flavor and added texture.  Tater tots on bottom of dish was a great idea.  I doubled the amount in the recipe to cover a 13x9.  probably 1/3 of the 30 oz bag.

Being from MN, where the Tater Tot Hotdish (Non-Minnesotans call it Casserole)  was invented.  I have slight problem with this Recipe,  My Mom, and all my Friends here, We put frozen or fresh Veggies in this Recipe.  Some just do Corn, but most of Us put a bag of frozen Mixed Veggies in this.  Oh! Also some of Us either Do Cream of Chicken and Cream of Mushroom, or some Friends do just Cream of Chicken and No Cream of Mushroom.
I Love Tater Tot Hotdish (Non Minnesotans call it Casserole), been making it forever, and My Mom made this Several times  when I was growing up

I used cream of chicken instead and had mini tots so I used way more than 20 for the bottom. Also I'm a cheese lover so the top got....3 lbs...of...cheese... It wasnt soupy like others are saying. KEEP THE SPICES you will NOT regret it. As for cooking, it was in for 34 minutes and was done perfectly.

I substituted Grilled London Broil with Montreal Steak Seasoniong for the meat and added 1 Tbsp Yellow Curry. It was fantastic! There are a lot of options to dress this up - next time I'm thinking maybe fajita seasoned skirt steak and some peppers.

Good basic comfort food.  When I was assembling the casserole, I didn't think there was enough soup mixture, but after baking it was perfect.  Nothing fancy.  Easy to make.  Didn't change a thing. Gave a 5 star rating based on what it is...just a good basic recipe for comfort food.

YUM!  Easy and tasty. I left the onions out because of  a few family members not liking them, it was still great.

I added a bit of cayenne pepper, Italian herbs, and Worcestershire sauce to the ground beef mixture. Also, I did bake the tator tots an additional 10 minutes to make it crispy then sprinkled the cheddar cheese over them and bake again until melted. Very delicious, many compliments. Thanks for the great recipe.

Pretty good, although I feel the Montreal seasoning was a little strong. I'd definitely make it again, but probably halve or even omit the Montreal seasoning. Other than that- great recipe, thanks!

Not sure why, since I added no salt, but came out a bit salty.  Did add a layer of french cut green beans between the meat and topping to give it a little veggies.

I’ve made this a few times. Great dish when nothing else is planned for dinner. I always have the ingredients on hand. Always yummy and easy. Tonight I made it with refrigerated shredded potatoes on the bottom because I had some I needed to use up. I bake it in an 8x8 dish instead of 9x13 and bake for 40 minutes. This keeps it creamy, not dry or soupy. I only gave 4 stars because it definitely takes more than 10 minutes to warm the potatoes in the bottom. Also, it could use a veggie addition. Next time I’m going to try adding sautéed mushrooms and using broccoli tots on top.

This was a huge hit and super easy to make a few of for a recent large gathering we had. I substituted taco seasoning for the meat seasonings, and added more tater tots and cheese overall, but people were begging for the recipe!

Two out of 3 of us liked it but the third is a picky teenager so he doesn't really count!  I added salt and pepper at the table for personal preference but thought this was pretty good.   I would probably make this again but I won't put in the meal rotation.

I fried the tater tots first and used sour cream instead of milk since so many reviews of theirs being soggy. Turned out great.  Everyone loved it.

I made this following the recipe to the letter.  It was so easy to make.  But this is one of those great recipes that you can change up,  it can pretty much be done with what you have on hand,  try cream of celery soup instead of the mushroom.  And use what ever kind of spices you have.   I served this with some fresh corn on the cob, and some garlic Texas toast.  Yummy!

First time around I made it exactly the way the recipe said, and it was a keeper! The second time, I tweaked it a little too much, this simple recipe needs to be kept pretty much the way it's written. However, I did mix a little of the soup mix with the cooked ground beef to keep it moist and have switched from tater tots to the frozen potatoes O'Brian with the bell peppers. Both ways are great! Thanks for a new staple in our dinner rotation.

This wasn't anything special for our family.  I guess we are not a tater tot casserole kind of family b/c I think the texture and flavor came out as expected it just isn't our thing.  I will say it was very salty and I did use 1 tsp. of the Montreal steak seasoning.  I also used more than 20 tots on the bottom b/c it really needed more than that to smash and cover the bottom.

We tried this tonight for the first time and it was a big hit in our house!  I enjoyed this too and I don't usually like Tater Tots.  We didn't change anything except the cooking spray.  I don't like to use cooking spray so I spread oil lightly on the pan to grease it.

Made exactly as directed.  I felt the steak seasoning really overpowered this recipe so next time I will cut it to one teaspoon.  Otherwise, love the idea of the smash tots at the bottom layer!

I made this as per the recipe except I couldn't find the steak seasoning so I left that out. I thought it was a little too garlic-y. Overall just something I wouldn't make again. Just personal preference.

This is heavenly comfort food!! Beware... it will be hard to NOT go back for seconds. Followed the recipe with very good results. I made it when I needed to feed a house full of teens unexpectedly. I am not a casserole fan, but this was delicious! Next time, I will need to double the recipe. I also will try to do a mixture of ground turkey and ground beef, to make it a little healthier... Otherwise, the kids are full and happy, I'm full and happy. No complaints here??.

I was excited to try this recipe based on the many outstanding reviews.  Needless to say, it didn't meet my expectations or anyone else's at the table.  Very bland!  Won't be making this again.

Others had suggested about 30 tater tots for the bottom layer but I found this was still not enough to fully cover the bottom of my 13x9-inch casserole dish.  I used a total of 50 and this was perfect because once I smashed them up all the spaces were filled in evenly.  Some reviewers had mentioned a problem with too much liquid and I did not encounter this issue probably because I had enough tater tots to soak it up.  The family enjoyed the taste of this dish and I would make it again with one other alteration.  We are not high salt users and found 2 teaspoons of Montreal-style steak seasoning way too much – I will use 1 teaspoon next time.

I thought it was worthy of 3 stars, but my picky son loved it and it was pretty easy to make so 4 stars it is!  The only change I made to the recipe is I substituted ground turkey for the ground beef.

Made this for dinner last night it was very tasty the only problem was 10 min was not enough time for the first batch of potatoes  I couldn't flatten them they were still frozen it would be  easier to just put half the bag on bottom and half on top that's what I ended up doing and it came out fine

This was a hit!  We used the smaller potato crowns, and it probably added even more crunch.  Really liked the ease of preparation and the flavors.

Great, cheap and easy dinner. Recommend using low sodium cream of mushroom and cutting salt where possible but other than that it was quick and easy and kid friendly.

Not our favorite. To be honest, our grocery store didn't have Montreal steak seasoning, so we used Wolfgang Pucks general seasoning, which had similar ingredients. BIG MISTAKE. It had all of the ingredients of Montreal BUT it also had rosemary. Not friendly with beef! And why use tots if you smash them anyway. It took at least ten minutes to thaw them. So will not make again.

Kids ate it up.
My only complaint is that it seemed saltier than I like. I found myself craving water after eating it.
This was an easy, fast meal to put together which is great after a long work day/school day and a family of 6 to feed by 6:30.

Mine took almost 50 minutes to bake hot enough.  But it was worth the wait.  Next time I might up the temperature.    I didn't have Montreal seasoning but looked up a recipe for it.  I had all the ingredients except the dill.  Made my own batch minus the dill.  Also added frozen peas (might be why baking time was longer) and mushrooms.  Very savory!  Hubby thought it would be boring, but before we even finished dinner he said I better be keeping this recipe!  Thank you Kristy!

I've tried different recipes for this and this one is our favorite so far.  I precook my hamburger and freeze it, so I mixed everything together excluding tots and cooked that soup mixture in the microwave.  Worked like a charm.

I made this with very few changes. I used a can of cream of mushroom, a can of cream of chicken, sour cream and a splash of milk. Thickness was really good. The only thing I did not like was the flavor of the Montreal seasoning. Will not use again.

Most of it was good, except the golden mushroom soup gave it an odd flavor.  I would definitely make it again but would substitute some other soup in its place, maybe cream of mushroom.

I really enjoyed this dish. Really easy to make too, which is nice! Things that I would do differently next time: I used way too big of an onion- a small yellow or sweet onion would have been better. There was something missing and I couldn't exactly put my finger on it. It definitely needed more salt so definitely add salt to taste but that wasn't it. I ended up adding some Cajun seasoning and that helped a lot. I know it sounds like I'm just complaining but it actually was really good. LOL!

I REALLY LOVED THE RECIPE. IT WAS A CHANGE FOR US. I NEVER THINK OF USING TATOR TOTS IN A RECIPE.

I seriously dislike cream of mushroom soup, so I used a can of Campbell's cheddar soup. The result was fine, not "soupy" at all. Otherwise, I changed nothing and followed the recipe as written. This casserole is yummy and really fits the bill for comfort-food cravings.  I took off one star because it's pretty fattening, but it isn't supposed to be diet food. :)

Made this last night. I love the ingredients-- tater tots? I'm  in. Ground beef -- how can you go wrong?  One of the most disappointing recipes I've ever made.  So bland and blah, that my husband left it on his plate. While I was eating it, I was thinking that I would not be making this again.  I"m an experienced cook, and I followed the recipe exactly. I suspect that it's all about our tastes. This is something that could be shoveled in because it is inoffensive. But it is not good.  I think it falls into the category of any fast food you would buy.  Since I'm cooking, I want something that tastes great and is not too bad for you!  Empty calories to fill a hole -- not so much.

This recipe was alright, it was too dry for our taste. I think if i made it again i would at least double the milk and soup. Also instead of layering the beef and then the soup mixture, i think it would be better all mixed together. And adding something more like corn would add much needed flavor

This was just DELICIOUS!  I had another recipe for Tater Tot Casserole, but the worcestershire and Monterrey Steak seasonings really make Kristy's version unique and yummy!  This is comfort food at its best.  The only thing I did differently was to cook 30 tater tots in the initial bake (instead of 20).  I didn't think 20 would be enough.  Using 30 in the bottom of the pan still leaves plenty to go on top.  Thanks, Kristy, for a great recipe!  I have ditched my old recipe!

My 9 year old refuses to eat onion and mushrooms.  God  forbid he see the can labeled "Cream of Mushroom soup" or see me chopping onion.  Of course,  in true style, he pops in the kitchen just as I am cooking the meat and onion  and the can of soup is out on the counter. As I try to hide the evidence he says,  "Is there onion in there".  Craaap!  I made a few excuses, like every other red blooded mom out there about how he won't taste them and to try it, thinking to myself that I just made this in vain.  I gave him his first serving.  He seemed to be eating it.  Next thing I knew, he walks his plate into the kitchen (I'm thinking for the sink) and over to the stove and scoops out more! He said to me, and I quote, "Mom, this is sooo  good! I can't even tell there are onions or mushrooms in it because it feels like the inside of the tater tots."   

THIS is the point in which I exhaled...

(The only thing I changed was the Montreal seasoning. I used another  steak and burger seasoning that I had on hand. Running to the store for that specific seasoning, was not an option!)

For a creation titled a "Tater Tot Casserole", my inner comfort food lover paused, read it, saved it, and then decided to make it for dinner the same day!   It helped that I knew I had the ingredients at the ready.   I actually used Trader Joe's breakfast hash brown patties to layer the pan since they are basically bigger/flatter tater tots.    Used regular tater tots on the tops as directed.  Followed the recipe to a "T" and it  came out really good,  it's super simple, and I didn't find it to be another bland casserole drowning in a non-descript cream sauce.      Those usually end up in the recycling bin.  Not this recipe.   It's a keeper for a quick weeknight meal!

Didn't have Worcestershire or steak sauce, but substituted fish sauce and barbecue instead. Seems like anything salty and tangy works great. Best tater tot casserole I've ever had!

My family really liked this casserole. I found it a little dry, I think  when I make it again I will double the soup and cheese mixture and add it to the top layer of the tater tops before adding the final layer of cheese. Over all very good and filling meal.

Made the dish based mainly off the recipe here.  I did add a bowl of frozen peas to the sauce/cheese mixture, which added some color and texture to the finished dish.  Really liked the step of crushing some tots for a bottom layer, added another dimension to it.  No complaints about this one, even from a few finicky eaters that usually nitpick everything.  Good recipe.

It's a great dish. I had to change it from cream of mushroom soup because not a lot of people in my family like that so we use cream of chicken and it still is good.

I love this recipe. I use my own homemade soup recipe but also add a can of green beans to have a veg with it.  Great recipe.
Thanks for sharing.

Very good and super easy to make.  My daughter is allergic to mushrooms so I just added beef gravy everything else was the same as written.  It was creamy and a little spicy but everyone was really happy with the dish.  We will be making this again.

Great simply Recipe!  Followed the map just as written and it turned out great, I loved it.  1 thing I did was look up a recipe for homemade tator tots.  It cuts the cost and I know whats in it...haha.  I will definately make it again.  Next time I might add chopped green chile's.

Yours was yummy more adults liked yours. My mom made this for dinner in the late 60's and 70's .  She puts ground beef, cream mushroom soup, tater tots, grated cheese to top it and seasons with garlic and onion powder.

I made a double batch.  My kids love this.  I put in one can of cream of mushroom soup & one can of cheddar cheese soup.  I also use the tator rounds because they seem to cook faster.

Made this tonight for dinner and it was a huge hit!  The only changes I made was to use cream of mushroom soup with garlic, pressed fresh garlic into the beef mixture because it is what I had on hand, and I threw in some mixed vegetables to be healthy.   I also used the low sodium version of the Montreal Steak spices .  My daughter loved this hotdish and kept going back for more and in fact dubbed it "the best meal in a long time"  Will make again for sure!

This recipe is a keeper.  It has great flavor. My family loved it. I substituted soy sauce for the Worcestershire, because I was out. I also reduced the Montreal seasoning a little to cut the salt.

I tried this recipe instead of my go to tater tot casserole with only a few ingredients.  This one is definitely worth the extra effort.  I cooked for a full 60 minutes to make sure the tots were fully cooked.  The whole family really liked it.

I’ve made this recipe about a dozen times, just the way it is listed and I’ve loved it. But, one of my pickier kids, doesn’t like the taste of the mushroom soup in the casserole. So, I tried something a little different: I substituted a 15 oz. jar of Alfredo sauce for the soup and milk, and mozzarella cheese for the cheddar cheese. Still absolutely delicious! My family liked it better than the original!

As compared to other TT casseroles I've tried I found this recipe dry even with extra milk.  My hamburger is very lean (custom butchered) so that may be why mine was dry while others find it too soupy.  I also added extra cheese on top.  If I try this again, I will increase hamburger, add sour cream to the soup with milk and remember to add my Italian blend mixed vegetables to up the flavor & the moisture.  This was too much TT flavor and not enough other flavors.

I just made this casserole last night.  It is the first time I have tried a Tator Tot Casserole, so I was not sure if I (or the family/kids) would like it.  It was a huge hit!!  Even our 6yr old, who is a very picky eater, loved it!  This recipe is definitely a keeper, and will probably become a regular. :) Thanks for sharing Kristy!

This recipe is great as written.. but I made a few additions the second time I made it and it is even better.  I added an extra can of soup (I used the original amount of milk), added a bag of frozen mixed vegetables, and a can of mushrooms.  This allowed me to stretch the meal out for my hungry crew and the taste was amazing. What makes this recipe stand apart from others of its kind is the seasonings.. I did not change those at all and the flavor is wonderful.  This will be a regular at our house for sure!

This recipe was amazing followed it to the letter. My son is so finicky about casseroles but every bit was devoured by him and my boyfriend.  Super big hit in my house and in the recipe box as a staple.

WOW!! Found this recipe today to make after work since I had all the ingredients it called for. I only had Cream of Mushroom with Garlic soup, which turned out amazing. I will keep this recipe in my favorite list for sure. I am going to make it again Saturday night for a family get together. Thank you Kristy!
