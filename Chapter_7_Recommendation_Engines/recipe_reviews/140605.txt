I live in Ohio and visit Amish country often. This stuff is sold at just about every authentic Amish restaurant and many roadside markets etc. You put it on bread folks -- just like you would peanut butter or butter. They serve it with white and wheat dinner rolls before your meal comes. It's a sweet spread you put on a roll, bagel, English muffin, whatever -- instead of jam. It's sweet; the Amish have a major sweet tooth. If you love peanut butter and you aren't allergic to something that isn't so good for you every now and again, this is going to ring your bell. Kids love it. My 42 year-old husband loves it. My 67 year-old mother loves it. It's just a nice treat and interesting change from your basic jam/butter/PB and we never leave Amish country without a tub of it. Now we can make it every once in a while at home! I have asked the Amish women how this is made and they told me it has marshmallow cream and corn syrup so I know this recipe is right on.

This is more like a peanut butter topping for ice cream.  It goes well on toast, too, though.  Heck, peanut butter goes great on anything in my opinion.  I also made a batch where I added carmel ice cream topping and mixed it together.  Of course, that was certainly used for ice cream sundaes.

This is exactly like a spread that is served at an Amish restaurant in Southern Indiana.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is really good. My Mom has made it for years. We use it as a "dip" and serve it with Granny Smith apple slices and pretzel rods. It stays perfectly soft and creamy and is great for large gatherings!

I don't know what to think of this stuff? But, I may also be the only person who has never tried it, that rated it on here. It really is good. The consistency if very different then I expected. It is super gooey yet sticky. I am not sure what to put it on either? It seems like it would be like putting a peanut butter dessert on toast? But, then again people eat honey and chocolate spreads for breakfast on bread. I did scale the recipe way down though, to about 1/4 cup, to try it. I bet kids would go crazy over this though!

I have bought similar 'Peanut Butter Cream' from many different Amish stores, and this one rates right up there too.  We love this stuff, either on something or as a dip for apples, or even by itself on a spoon.  I also enjoy the similar one made with molasses, though it has a slightly different name, peanut butter schmeare.

Could not be easier and makes delicious sandwiches. My kids LOVE this although I don't make it all that often for health reasons. It's a very nice treat once in awhile though.

I LOVE this recipe! I generally add a little more peanut butter, and use the extra crunchy Jif. It's awesome!

I found a heck of a deal on marshmallow creme at Grocery Outlet this weekend, so I was looking for a way to use it.

I made a smaller batch for my two boys and I, just for a change from the normal peanut butter sandwiches we'd had lately. This was a hit with them, not so much for me.

This is a decent recipe. Simple, easy and quick. While I didn't think it was too sweet and the marshmallow creme didn't stand out, but the peanut butter was also very light. It's a total go back and dip your finger in it again type of recipe, that you should totally watch ;-) But it spreads very quickly and all over the place if your not watching. And you'll have a mess everywhere. I can see me making again and tweaking a bit to get it from being super runny to a more spreadable fashion. I think the amount of corn syrup is a bit overwhelming on the runny-ness factor. I did like the flavor but felt it needed to be increased on the peanut butter flavor. I think the corn syrup needs to be decreased and the peanut butter and marshmallow creme needs to be increased.

Quite tasty and easy to spread.  I tried this recipe on home-made "white Amish bread", a recipe that I obtained from this Allrecipes site by searching on "Amish". Both are excellent recipes.

Delicious. But I blew the motor of my food processor on this because it's so thick. We're in Amish country too and this is a lot heavier on the corn syrup than what I've seen. I would add more peanut butter but I'm out. We're putting it on crackers but I'm not letting anybody dip because the crackers will break.

Mmmm supper yummy! I just made this and it turned out great. At first when I threw all of the ingredients in the bowl I thought "How am I going to stir this? They're all different consistency's." Honestly, I thought I was going to make a mess but everything folded in just fine.  It's very creamy. I wouldn't say sticky. Would I make this again? Ummm yeah!

I visited my Sister in Wisconsin.   We went to Door County and Amish Peanut Butter was sold there. I had never heard of Amish Peanut Butter before  I bought a few jars and had them shipped home.  I found this recipe when I got home to California.  While this recipe is good, I find that there is just a little too much corn syrup called out.  I cut back on the amount of Corn Syrup and added just a little more Peanut Butter.
Overall my family really enjoyed this recipe and I will make again with my little variation of Corn Syrup and Peanut Butter.

A farmer's market in Door County sells this, but it contains maple flavoring and has a texture that doesn't appeal to me.  I much prefer this smooth, sweet spread.  My son loves it on toast, but it would also be great with fruit.

this was delicious! i didn't have corn syrup so substituted 1 cup sugar and 1/4 cup water.
