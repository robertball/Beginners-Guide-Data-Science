Very tasty recipe with a little bit of a zing from the cayenne pepper.  I added chopped onions, used fresh garlic instead of powder and olive oil instead of vegetable.

I had some really nasty freezer-burnt pollack in my freezer and was looking for a recipe that 'rescue' it...or at least make it edible...and this was the one.  I didn't have condensed tomato soup so I used Wolfgang Puck's Organic Tomato soup and skipped the water.  My fish was really bad news so I cooked it twice as long, and since I was usually regular soup instead of condensed and all the fish was submerged, I cooked it uncovered for the rest of the time.  Didn't have cayenne so I used red pepper flakes.  Also tossed in a bay leaf.  Served it with a mountain of brown rice in the middle of the dish with the fish in a 'moat' surrounding it.  Was really great, especially considering the poor quality of fish I was using.  I'm not a big fan of cooked green peppers but in this dish they were wonderful.  This would also be a good recipe for shrimp or a medley of fish.  I thought that it would need onions, but it didn't.  Making it with regular soup instead of condensed gave me more of a 'fish stew' consistency, but that was really nice for the rice too.

This was a simple to fix, fast to the table dish. The sauce was a bigger hit than the fish was. Definitely it needs the rice to sop up some of the wonderful sauce. I served this with some leftover fried rice and it made a quick hot meal for lunch. My son ate two pieces. He is a fish lover any way it is prepared. He said it needed something, maybe a dash of tabasco or a squeeze of lemon to brighten it up some.

There's no way this can be considered "Cajun", but it definitely was fast and good. I did add some chopped onions with the green peppers and, since the sauce seemed a bit bland, next time will try some extra seasonings. We used tilapia and it worked out well, but in the future I will use a thicker fish as suggested in the recipe.

This is another one I'm only giving 4 stars. I liked it. It was a little different. My husband didn't care for it to much though. I think the only thing I really did different was added chopped tomatoes to it. I also baked it.

An easy, nice, quick, little spicy (the red peppers) fish dinner. Nothing fancy about it, but a good taste. Wife had hers with white rice and I did the brown rice.

Simple and tasty. I omitted green peppers due to personal preference and used half an onion in its stead.  I also threw in a bit of white pepper. Not 5 stars simply because it's very simple and not an experience played out on the tastebuds.

i LOVED this recipe!  i used swai filets for this dish.  i was so fearful that this was going to taste like fish with tomato soup poured on top but the seasonings are spot on. i did add some red pepper flakes and cajun seasoning, as well as increase the garlic.  simmering it with the fish blended the flavors nicely, and it really tasted phenomenal.  i served over rice as suggestested and it did go well together.

I have made this twice for my boyfriend and I and both times it has been a hit, I ate mine with couscous and he mixed his into pasta (he eats pasta with every meal) and we were both happy. I wouldn't make this for company but is a great family dinner that scales perfectly for only two people.

In addition to the sweet onion, we added a dash of sugar to cut the acidity of the tomato soup. Quick dinner to make yet with enough spices. Will definitely make again

This was so easy to make and so good! My husband isn't a big fan of fish and loved it.  The spice with the fish is a good change to have! Will make again.  Followed recipe exactly.  Thanks for sharing!

Did not use the green pepper, but added dill.  Served fish over a bed of white rice and steamed spinach.  I am not a fish person but it made for a good meal and is very simple to make =)

This was good, but not fantastic. My husband called it "tasty", which is not a rave review from him. I didn't have green pepper, so added onion instead, which I prefer over green pepper anyway.  Will keep it in my recipe box, but know there are better spicy fish recipes out there

Sorry....just not impressed.  I added onion and fresh garlic (instead of powder) and was liberal with other spices.  It still tasted bland.  Will I make it again?  No.
