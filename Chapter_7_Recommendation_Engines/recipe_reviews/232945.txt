These muffins were pretty good, not very sweet. I used one egg in place of the egg beaters. Also, the paper cups really aren't necessary. Good for a quick breakfast or late snack, will bake again.

Very good recipe. I made a couple changes do to lack of ingredients on hand. I used cashew milk instead of almond milk, because that was what was in my fridge. Also used a real egg instead of the egg substitute. Added a few dashes of nutmeg and ginger. 
The recipe said to slice the strawberries, but chopped into smaller pieces seemed to work better. 
Also, I poured it into a loaf pan instead of a muffin tin, turned out beautifully. I am concerned about my sugar intake, but the boys in my house are not, so I drizzled a powdered sugar glaze over top of their slices, and they LOVED it.

4.13.19  I used white whole wheat flour (what I had on hand).  Also, I didn’t quite have a cup of sliced strawberries, so I threw in some fresh blueberries to reach that amount.   Other than the sweetness you get from a bite of the juicy fruit, the muffin itself is weak in flavor.   Egg Beaters® are always in my fridge and I use Truvia®, so I had no adjustment to those two ingredients,  I just think this needs more flavor.  Maybe some cinnamon, Truvia® brown sugar, or almond extract instead of vanilla might help?  Little high in carbs to be called “healthy” by my standards, but as far as overall nutrition, it does break down pretty well.

Made this only made mini muffins and used olive oil instead of applesauce. So delicious!
