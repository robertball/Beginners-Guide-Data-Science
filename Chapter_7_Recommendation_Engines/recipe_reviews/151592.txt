I substituted canned Italian spiced tomatoes for the V8 and added red pepper flakes and mustard for more flavor.

I cooked the pasta in 1litre of vegetable stock.
Instead of celery soup, I used mushroom soup. 
I added a splash worcester sauce and dark soya sauce, added crush black pepper and used 1 tin of chopped tomatoes rather than the V8 juice. 
But it still felt like it was missing something.

Could use a little bit more flavor, so get creative with the spices and the vegetables. But great base for a perfect vegetarian alternative

loved this! it gets 4 stars only because as written, the recipe is a little bland. Our trick to fix it up was to add about a tablespoon of prepared mustard-- gives the sauce just the zing it needs. my husband claims it tastes like ravioli sauce from a certain italian restaurant & everyone ate the veggies without complaint. This is a keeper!

This was okay. I had to use tomato juice instead of V8 because I do not drink it and did not want to buy a case or a big bottle of it. I do not know if this made a difference. It was also a little bland.  I might try again with more spices and because it was easy to make.

It was ok. Next time I think I would add some more spices and some hot sauce. On the bright side my kids loved it! If I make it again for them I will add more veggies and keep it bland
