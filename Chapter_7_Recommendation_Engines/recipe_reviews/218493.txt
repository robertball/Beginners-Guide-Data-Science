Only 4 stars, as is.... But I modified to our family's taste and they became a 5 star. I think there was a tad too much water... the mixture was too loose. So I added an egg. I also added some worcesteshire to the meat mixture and eliminated the celery salt. I used 2 packages of dried onion soup mix to make a gravy. I make patties , not balls and once the patties (6 generous ones) were browned, I added the soup mixture (dry soup mix, water and flour) to the pan and let it cook 30-45 minutes. Served it with mashed potatoes and watched my family devour it. No leftovers. We like the brown gravy better than the tomato sauce. This is how my mom made it when we were kids in the 50's. Only no onion soup mix ...she made the gravy from scratch...

I've made this recipe for 35 years and it's one of my family's favorites. I think I got it from my Betty Crocker cook book. My kids all requested the recipe when they moved out and now make it for their families. I do agree with some other reviewers that, if the recipe is followed exactly, it can be a little bland. I've learned to spice it up some over the years. I add extra seasoning (italian, more garlic and onion powder) to the meatballs as well as some of the worcestershire sauce. And I also add more seasoning to the sauce...more worcestershire (because we like the flavor), garlic, onion powder and some ketchup, or sugar or even brown sugar. We serve it on toasted french rolls, like a meatball sandwich but it's also good alone with side dishes. Great as leftovers too. I didn't know it could be cooked in the oven though. That's good to know.

I don't know what everyone else is tasting, but I did not care for this recipe at all. 

Some very simple changes give it 4 stars for me: Instead of tomato sauce, use tomato soup. Instead of W sauce, use vinegar. And instead of regular rice, use instant rice.

This exact recipe was in a cookbook my mother gave me when I moved out on my own, and I've been making it for nearly 30 years (sans the celery salt, which I'm not fond of). It has always been a family favorite. 
My husband adores stuffed cabbage, but I'm a lazy cook and hate the work involved. Solution---I cook a layer of chunks or small wedges of cabbage on top of the meatballs (I've even used a bag of shredded cabbage for cole slaw in a pinch). We call it "Unstuffed Cabbage". :-)

I wanted to add my two cents for the base recipe, and also a couple options that make for interesting changes if so desired.

As a base, this recipe is fantastic - it's simple, it's just flavorful enough to pass, but not too exotic to get kids introduced to meat dishes. It's quick, and it's quite easy.

Now, to add on to this base, there's a couple things I've done:
I use instant rice instead of any long-grain/etc types - this makes the rice softer, fluffier, and cook quicker.
I add a small amount of brown sugar to the sauce at the end - just enough to sweeten it slightly, but not make it too sweet.

Other options: I've used Tabasco (or Frank's Red Hot) to add a kick to the sauce. It's subtle, it's flavorful, and it's only a small amount to give it that tiny heat edge.

I will also serve it on a bed of rice (lightly seasoned with chicken bullion or even curry and butter).

So thanks for sharing! This is a lot like my mother's recipe (which I couldn't get one night because she was at work when I called, so I got this one), but this one is more flexible than hers.

Great kid-friendly recipe!  I made this for dinner for my 3 boys and it was a hit with them all - including my picky two year old who only eats salad!  

I made it just as directed, however, I didn't have celery salt so I doubled the garlic powder and added a bit of worchestershire sauce.  I also browned the meatballs in the oven for 15 minutes at 425 before transferring them to the slow cooker where they cooked in the sauce on high for about 2.5-3 hours.  I was afraid the sauce would be bland but it was not.  An easy meal perfect with a salad and garlic bread.  Definitely a keeper.

The recipe I remember growing up, had used tomato soup. My family isn't a big fan of tomato-based sauces except on spaghetti or pizza. I took inspiration from suchaprincess' review to make it more beefy, and used 1 can of tomato soup, 1 packet of mushroom gravy mix, 3/4 soup can of water, a dash of worcestershire sauce, and two beef bouillon cubes, as the gravy. I also used Minute Rice, and cut the water in the meat mixture to 1/4 cup. I omitted the celery salt and added a dash of worcestershire sauce instead, and added one beaten egg. It's in the oven right now, and smells amazing!

So good! I used ground turkey (97/7) instead of beef, they seemed a little loose when I was forming them, maybe because there's less fat (?) but they held together really well during cooking.  I thought with the salt, celery salt, and tomato sauce that it would be too salty, but it wasn't at all. We served them over mashed potatoes-YUM!

Definitely a 5 star recipe!  Easy to throw together, ingredients I always have on hand, and super tasty!  Made as written, was tempted to throw an egg in the meat mixture because it seemed wet but stuck with directions.  Served with salad and garlic bread (a must to soak up all the yummy sauce).  Thanks for sharing, brought back good memories from family dinners growing up.

After many years of making porcupine meatballs I finally discovered where they got their name.  I pulled the lid off the pan and discovered little balls of meat with quills coming straight out.  It was cute.  These balls are great!

OMG!!! soo good! my kids devoured these and asked if i would make this every night.. I used 3 cheese pasta sauce and i pre-cooked my rice only because i read on another site that it may take quite a while for the rice to cook and I'm not one for crunchy rice. I'm making them again to night. :)

I've been making this recipe since I was a kid!  (many years) I've tweaked it over the years with more seasonings, a bit of hot sauce, etc. but this is the basic recipe I have been using.  It's always popular with my family even though it is very basic home cooking.  I don't always brown the meatballs first if I don't have time, if you get the sauce boiling in the pan, you can just drop the balls in gently and they will hold together.  Or, you can brown them in the oven as others have done to cut back on time.  I love the nostalgia of this dish.  Sometimes we serve them with baked potatoes, or spaghetti squash or on toasted french sandwich rolls.

Delicious ! Similar to recipe given by dear friend. Made it with 1/2 lb lean ground meat (2 in family), added more oregano & 1/4 c instant rice. Great meal in about 30 minutes, son & a close friend truly enjoyed it, served with lots of sauce, Yummy!
Next time I'll use 1 lb for some leftover sandwiches.

My whole family loved these meatballs!  I used brown rice instead of rice, baked them, and served them over rice, which was great with the tomato sauce.   I will definitely be making these a lot.

Made this for my family tonight, after a 30+ year old recipe disappeared.   This was even better than my  old Good Housekeeping recipe.   But I did add more rice.   Thank you so much for sharing.

YUMMY!  I even left out onion and celery salt because I didn't have them .. going to try it with and I'm sure they will be even more delicious!!  Make sure to cover when cooking in the oven or the rice won't cook ;)

MADE AS DIRECTED BY THE RECIPE.  We liked them but it wasn't out of this world good.  My changes for the future would be maybe a little more rice, a little more garlic (real, not powdered), a little more pepper.  As for the sauce, I think using 80/20 beef allowed more flavor to transfer to the sauce.  I'd probably use a little less water too.  I'll make again.

We baked them in the oven and used a mixture of dried onion soup and a can of mushroom soup in place of tomato sauce.  We also sauteed onions, carrots, and celery before adding to hamburger.  Added sauteed mushrooms before serving over mashed potatoes.  DELISH!!

Really good, and a big hit with my family.  We ended up eating them with spaghetti, and my husband even commented it was better than the jar sauce he usually likes.  Definitely a keeper.

I don't eat much beef so I used ground turkey and totally loved this. Quick, easy and is so open for a different variety of ideas. Gravy instead of tomato sauce or add hot peppers for spice. I can see using this recipe based off of what I have in my cupboard.

Delicious! Changed: tomato soup for cream of mushroom.  Added: chipotle (pepper and hot sauce), cumin, cilantro, red pepper since we live on spicy.
I'm excited that the recipe was a success since meatballs and I don't get along yet.  All went well, right down to the rice being cooked perfectly!

I too thought this was the best porcupine meatball recipe I have ever used.  I made no changes and let them simmer until the sauce was thickened and clung to the meatballs.  The rice was cooked tender but not mushy and I loved that this recipe was not too salty, although I guess I did make one change.  I only used one-half teaspoon of salt instead of a whole teaspoonful

This is my Mom's recipe as well! I sometimes make it with a can of Campbell's condensed tomato soup, which was actually I think the original recipe on the back of the soup can. This was the most requested item when I was a kid in the 1970s, for school functions, church functions and at home it was a big fave as well, with all 3 kids and Dad. It's now requested by my church group and friends and husband as well.

I made these but did some altering as suggested by another cook.  Most of the recipes called for instant rice and I didn't want to use that so was glad to find this recipe.  Mixed the ground beef with worchestershire sauce, onion, garlic salt, pepper and an egg along with the 1/2 cup of water.  For the gravy I used 2 packages of onion soup with 2 cups of water.  Whoa...way to salty so I added about 1/2 cup of half and half.  Then I mixed about 1/3 cup of water with two tablespoons of cornstarch...and cooked the gravy in a pan on top the stove.  I then poured that over the meatballs after they cooked for about 15 minutes in a 350 degree oven.  I added the gravy onto of the meatballs, covered and continued to bake for another 30 minutes.  My husband said, "you can make this one again!"  Clean plates by all!!!  Yum!!

They were pretty good, but I would reduce the salt next time. I used vegetable stock in place of water, family enjoyed them.

I don't know how this got such a high rating... very bland. I had to add a ton of ketchup to it so that it had some flavour. Wouldn't make it again.

Super easy and super good.  Of you don't have celery salt just chop celery very fine and moderate the salt.  I used bet broth as a substitute for the water.  Great choice.  I also added a pinch of sugar to the sauce.  it was absolutely delicious and super cheap

I'll make it again.  This is the same recipe that I used to make years ago.  I looked it up.  My daughter loved it and rice was suddenly a good thing.  The best part is that this recipe used tomato sauce instead of tomato soup.  It's a big difference in any recipe.

Followed recipe as listed ( did add a pinch, literally, of minced garlic).  Meatballs came out delicious. I did let them simmer for almost 2 hours … longer the better. Even my fiances apprehensive 7 year old son ate not just one, but TWO (even though he said he wasn’t hungry, and maybe isn’t the biggest fan of rice). Only change I will make when I make this again is to make the meatballs themselves half the size, so I get 24 … but that is a personal preference. Great recipe, looking forward to making this one AS IS again, and again, and again!

I followed this recipe exactly and loved it! Only reason I could not give it 5 stars was because my rice was a little on the crunch side after cooking for the recommended time. Some of the rice on the outside of them looked done, but definitely not on the inside. Not sure what I did wrong, but I will definitely try this recipe again, maybe cook the rice first? I'm not sure, but that's the only thing I need to work on. Other than that, I loved the overall flavor of this dish! I served them with a side of mashed potatoes and buttered cooked cabbage!

These were ok, but i am going to experiment with other recipes. Also, dont forget what one of the steps says---- keep adding water to the sauce if it seems dry. i barely had any sauce :( but as for the meatball itself, it tasted a little plain. also, it was hard to keep together. maybe ill add egg next time?

You know, this is just the best recipe ever for porcupine meatballs, and it is so easy and simple.  Porcupine meatballs were a favorite of mine growing up in Iowa.  I cooked them for years for my own children.  But, I never really had Mom's recipe, and with old age things fade.  So, I went to Allrecipes, and was so happy I did!   The first time I made them, I ate all 12 by myself, 4 for dinner, 2 for breakfast, 3 for lunch and, 3 for dinner.  I didn't intend to alter the recipe, but used home canned tomato juice, because I didn't have sauce and it is 70 miles round  trip to a grocery store, added a pinch of sugar and Italian spices.  Otherwise, I wouldn't mess with this recipe one bit!  Pure perfection!

I was babysitting my "Pasta Pickups" - - only - - 3 year old. I remembered that his daddy loved this when he was that age. His parents are in the middle of moving into a new home so all we had was the rice, beef and tomato sauce. He LOVED it! He ate four!!!! WOW! Thank you for this recipe! You should post this to a parents of toddlers page!

This recipe was okay. The sauce is very unflavorful, as well as the meatballs. I like bland foods, and this was too plain for me. I added a lot of other spices to the sauce. The meatballs were fine. We wrapped ours in cabbage leaves and baked them, and the meatballs themselves came out fully cooked and they tasted fine, but completely non-exciting. Won't bother making this one again.

I really enjoyed the Porcupine Meatballs, I do however have that feeling it's missing something as far as seasonings.  But they are still very yummy.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Love this recipe!  I often add an extra 8 oz. can of tomato sauce (and adjust the seasonings to match) to give it that extra sauce that everyone loves!

Very good recipe. I tweeked it by sautéing the onions before adding to the gb and I added 1 Tablespoon vinegar to the sauce to brighten it. I used the oven method and it came out great.

I wish I had read the reviews before making. I used regular long grain white rice, not instant.  Did them in the oven, and now am simmering them on the stove.  The meatballs were done, but the rice was still somewhat crunchy.  Hoping this works!  Tastes good with the exception of the crunchy rice!

Loved this meal as a kid and fix it for my family now. I melt shredded cheese over the top of it when it is done. I also cook corn as a side dish, so that those of us who want to, can mix in the corn with the meatballs.

This recipe is great just the way it is. Thank you,  It is the way my mom used to make porcupine meatballs except she used a pressure cooker. The review from "suchaprincess" who said they made this into patties and made a gravy and onion mix...well that's Salsbury steak not porcupine meatballs. completely different recipe....

I made this exact recipe literally 100% as directed and they turned out dry with not enough salt or flavor. I would definitely add more seasonings next time and cook for less time. Or use a crockpot.

Good. Did the oven option and minute rice. I think oven needs to be hotter. When I thought it was done after an hour it was over done. Think I prefer my mom’s version that is done stovetop with canned tomato soup! (And no browning of meatballs.)

Okay I had to add. I made more meatballs to add to the leftovers I made the other day. I did exactly how I made them the other day but I added the celery salt I omitted the other day and my husband and kids loved it. They want me to make it with the celery salt every time. I personally like it without so I guess it’s personal preference.

Very tasty!  I didn't have tomato sauce in the pantry so I used 15 ounces of a roasted red pepper pasta sauce I had, which adds other flavors too.  I read in some other reviews that they wanted more flavor, so I increased the garlic powder to half a teaspoon as well as the black pepper and substituted half a teaspoon of dried basil for the celery salt.  Some thought that the fluids were too much but it is actually perfect and results in a moist, large meatball with a nice texture.  The rice I used was a long grain white rice and it cooked to fluffy and soft and all in all, my hubby gave the meatballs an 11 out of 10!  Texture, flavors, cooking time in the oven was all perfect.  I just removed the meatballs from the pan once browned to my pyrex dish with the lid and the cooking time @ 350F was perfect with 45 minutes covered and another 15 uncovered.  I would say, use the spices/herbs that you enjoy!

Sorry but I had to give this 1 star. I followed recipe, w exception of different spices. The meat was so loose I decided to add an egg. The meatballs fell apart and I ended up just frying the meat and adding sauce and rice. Tasted good but not what I expected. Will do it differently next time.

I made these using the baking method and they come out perfectly. My mother and husband both love them and have requested that I make them again a few times over. 

Add a side vegetable to go with it and you can easily feed three adults.

Good basic recipe.  Have made it several time.  Out of tomato sauce so used boxed chicken broth (a few cups)  whisked in tomato paste small can.  Threw in some Italian seasoning and garlic and baked for 30-45 minutes. Removed and put some mozzarella cheese on top.,

I make this at least every other week.  This is one of the best comfort food recipes I have, including the ones that came from my mom and grandmas!  I usually double the recipe and serve with creamy garlic mashed potatoes and a steamed veggie.  The meatballs reheat in the microwave really well (just be sure to cover as the red sauce likes to spatter).

I don't know they did different in that video but my meat balls were way to loose and wouldn't hardly bind, I added an egg but they still fell apart in the pan. I wouldn't add the water if I made them again and would keep the egg.

I made this as directed, except for seasonings.  I added 1 tablespoon of brown sugar, omitted celery salt, because I don't like it, added some Italian seasoning, thyme, granulated garlic ,  and a little more worcestershire sauce.  I found this recipe as written to be bland; and the rice did not cook completely.  If I make this again, I will use instant rice as others did.  Why not try this with a favorite jarred marinara?

Wish I'd used instant rice. Although a little crunch can be a good thing.

Didn’t have Worcestershire sauce but love it and wish I had. Regardless, my 3 teenage boys & Husband (and I) LOVED it! They claim to love everything I make, but for this meal, I rec’d so many positive reviews I have to adjust my grading curve for everything else! Thank you!

I liked it. Unfortunately, I managed to burn it, but even in a slightly...crispier...state it was enjoyable. After reading the comments saying it was too watery, I added less water and more rice, and I think this was why it was also quite dry. I'm keen to make this again in the future :)

I agree there is too much water in the original recipe and prevents the meatballs from holding together nicely.  Otherwise, good flavor.

Everyone loved these. I did change something's. I used Italian bread crumbs instead of fresh and I took a half of cup warm water and let the rice soak for 10 minutes (helps with it being not crunchy.

I baked instead of fried and the rice was not done. Baked for another 25 minutes and turned out great. I mistakenly used Tomato soup instead of sauce and still was delicious.

I've made this several times. The first time I made it exactly to the recipe. After the first time I started adding a tablespoon more Worcestershire sauce for more flavor, and a handful of mixed cheese (cheddar and monterey jack) to dial down the strong tomato flavor.

I didn’t have garlic powder so I used garlic salt and I added a little brown sugar in the tomato sauce. It’s a good recipe to try.

The only change I made is to add a little extra garlic powder because we love garlic.  I only had 3/4 lb. of hamburger so I adjusted for th and used the same amount of sauce. I served this with mashed potatoes and green beans.  We thoroughly enjoyed this and I will surely be making it again.  Thank you for the recipe.  I have made these before with a recipe calling for tomato soup but didn't care for it so haven't tried again for years.

I made these according to the recipe except for the celery salt. I didn’t have any so I used a bit of celery seed. The meatballs were pretty good but I didn’t care much for the sauce. I decided to use this recipe over the others because it didn’t call for tomato soup—I’m not a big fan of tomato soup. It’s probably just me but I think I would like these better I’m a marina type sauce.

I made it just the way it says and they turned out great! I was a little skeptical because it was wasn't even close to the recipe my mom used to make but they were a big hit. Even my boyfriend who can be quite picky loved them.

This is almost like mine but mix the, onions seasonings and rice together and in your crock pot make tomato soup put the meatballs in and it tastes a lot better than using water and the meatballs stick together better.

Do use brown gravy instead of tomato sauce/soup, do to allergies but my children beg for this. I sometime add different spices to change it up, my husband has added some cinnamon and sugar at times to give it a sweeter flavor. He has said these are the closest to his grandmother’s southern recipe that he can find.

I'll give it four stars because we enjoyed it. My husband loved them. I thought they were just a bit on the salty side, and the sauce was a bit thin. I cooked them using the oven method. I will make these again, but reduce the amount of salt and probably serve over rice to soak up the sauce.

I've looked high and low for my old recipe for porcupine meatballs and with no success so I was happy to find it here.  When my kids were still at home, I made it often.  We all liked it .  
I prefer to bake it so I use lean ground beef and add a couple of teaspoons of brown sugar to the sauce.   We also like it with chopped green peppers.  I put some of the sauce into the bottom of the pan, add the peppers, the meatballs, the sauce and more peppers.  It's nice with a side of  fresh corn off the cob. So good.

Easy and tasty.  I did make a couple of slight changes - I cooked the onion in a small amount of olive oil until very soft.  The amount of water added to the meat mixture looked like too much, so I cut back on that.  Next time, will probably add an egg, and maybe a clove of real garlic.

I had a recipe from my Mom very similar to this, but when I went to make it I couldn't find it. Thanks so much for sharing! I remembered my Mom's recipe had diced celery which I didn't have, so I used celery flakes instead of the celery salt. I also added a few shakes of Tabasco for my hubby.

I'm not making this again...I followed the recipe.  But the meat wouldn't hold together...needed that egg someone mentioned. The family wouldn't eat any more of it than they had to--the remainder got tossed out.

Great recipe, was a hit in our family. Only comment is you will struggle to get 12 decent sized meatballs out of a pound of ground beef.  I up the recipe by 1.5x, or 2x for leftovers. Also makes extra sauce to pour over the meatballs when you serve.

Excellent recipe!  For the rice, I used  ready made brown rice in the microwavable pouch & did not add the water to beef mixture.  Plus, I added a little brown sugar to the tomato sauce.  Kept everything else the same.  These are fantastic.  Thank you for the recipe!!   Oh yeah, I used the oven method, too.

I didn't like this recipe, but then again it was my husbands turn for dinner and this was his recipe to make! He totally did everything possible to make a simple thing, ten times worse! It was a funny moment and yes i ate it! but it did have a bitter/sour taste to it. I will make this again myself, but i will omit some of the water and the celery salt, cause it was entirely too loose, it couldn't be formed! Plus he made them nearly tennis ball, I exaggerate not! They of course came out loose. My kitchen was a mess! Will update when I try it next time!

I added a small can of tomato sauce to thicken it up. Made it even better!

It was good. I'd make it again, however, next time I'll adjust the tartness of the sauce; probably add a bit of sugar. It was an easy recipe to make. I also would add a small amount of garlic. The overall recipe was tasty.

Our family enjoyed this recipe. It could use a little more flavor & salt, but other than that we liked it.

It was delicious! I had some leftover cooked white rice. I used that instead of uncooked. I used a little under a cup of the cooked white rice because any more and the meatballs were falling apart. Do NOT add the 1/2c water to the meat mixture if you are using precooked rice. It isn't necessary. Other than that I did the recipe as written and it was great. My meatballs did break a smidge while cooking for 30 minutes but not bad. I know people say this is bland but it isn't.  It's made to be a very subtle dish. I don't like bland food and this was just right. I will add a couple tablespoons of brown sugar to the sauce next time to give it almost a meatloaf topping flavor.

Made this recipe exactly as called for, except instead of a cup of water in the sauce I reduced the water to a half cup and added a half cup of beef broth.  Flavor was ok, but generally way too salty for me.  My rice didnt cook completely, so I recommend instant rice.  I made roughly 20 meatballs and simmered them for 45 minutes.

Not a fan. The meatball itself was pretty good but the sauce was too sweet and we did not enjoy it.

Overall, a great meal.  The rice is my only complaint.  It was underdone. Next time I will either cook it before hand or use instant.  I merely tweaked the spices to our liking. ( we like our food spicy).  Makes a great meatball, and yummy leftovers.

I added hot pepper flakes ( we like things spicy). I substituted celery seeds and used more garlic powder.
The flavor was fantastic but my balls fell apart so I added some bread crumbs but they fell apart as they cooked. I will probably not use the water next time. 
I will try this again with more tweeking. My family loved the flavor.

As far as the meatballs went, this was really good tasting.  My husband likes gravy so I left out the ingredients to make the tomato sauce.  I was in a hurry and was afraid the rice wouldn't soften, so I cooked the water and minute rice and then mixed into the meat mixture.  Also, because of my family's taste, I cut kosher salt by half.  I will definitely make again.

I give it 4 stars, as is.  I had to modify it because of my family's taste and allergies.  I did not use the celery salt nor the garlic powder.  Other than this I went strictly by the recipe.  It would probably have been better if I could have used the celery salt and garlic powder.  Anyway, it was very good and my husband really liked it.  He said it was much better than the last recipe I used to make meatballs.  I will make this again, and again.

I remember porcupine meatballs being a favorite of mine while growing up.  I made a couple minor changes due to "diet restrictions" in the house - I subbed onion powder for onions and cut back on salt. I added just a little brown sugar as I do with most tomato based sauces to help with the acidity. These helped bring back memories and did not disappoint. Delicious!

Delicious and so easy.... I used a can of my favorite spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce then added a little ricotta cheese in the last 10 minutes, baked in the oven. Delicious, I will make this dish often.

My husband had never had these.  They were a staple meal in the1950's at our house..  This meal was a big success with my husband and adult grandkids.  I didn't make any changes.but we gilded the lily and had mashed potatoes with them.  Delicious meal!  All recipes is my go to site for recipes. This one is a keeper.  Thanks!

This was a hit. My picky boyfriend loved this.  I made it exactly as said above except no onions on hand. Next time may add some  Worcestershire  to the meat mix for a bit flavor. 

Instant rice is a must though.

Having on 'off day' made this harder than it really is....the recipe is good although I did not measure anything.   The only thing I did different was brushing the meatballs with butter before the tomato sauce-ing, and instead of water I used chicken broth. 
The family loved it!

Why would I brush it with butter you ask? That's part of the 'off day'. Sent my brother to the store and I forgot to add the tomato sauce to his list.  Butter sounded like a good way to keep me busy and maybe keep the meat from drying while my husband stopped by the store on his way home from work...and then! 
If you forget to cover this the rice won't cook (a duh moment for me).  ~2 hours in the oven (was watching a movie so I was extra patient) and it clicked.  You only need 20 minutes covered at that point if you too, have an off day and forget to cover it before baking in the oven. 
Still turned out delicious!  My husband rolls his meatballs in tortillas if you want to save silverware. ;)

Made the meatballs as directed, but without the sauce. Instead, boiled with a half-cup of vegetable broth in the frying pan (covered).

I have had this recipe for 40+ years & it is a family favorite!  Our adult son & both grandsons ask for this for their birthday dinner nearly every year!  I have only made it in the oven - & with 4 lbs of ground beef, increasing all other ingredients to match. (I told you they love it!!)  If baking in the oven, cover with foil for the first 45 min., removing for the last 15-20 min to get a good browning.

In the past I tried a recipe identical to this one several times and didn't like it because the rice wouldn't fully cook. This time I put the rice and half cup of water in my rice cooker for 20 minutes so it was only half cooked and still crunchy, let it cool and then added it to the hamburger. Turned out perfect. An easy way to cook this is to put the meatballs in a sprayed baking dish and bake for 10 minutes in a 350* oven. Pour the sauce over the meatballs and bake covered for 30 minutes, uncover & bake for 20 minutes more.

The flavor was good but needed to extend the baking time by about 30 minutes to get the rice even semi-soft. I would suggest either pre-cooking the rice or using instant rice.

Am I missing something? These were bland and the rice was uncooked. My 6 year old made these for us (with my help) for dinner. I can't understand why people add things to a recipe and then rate it. I made the recipe as written.

For best flavor must use ground beef. Don't substitute ground  turkey. Simmer closer to medium, not low to get rice cooked. Add 1/2 c more water when sauce thickens to finish rice.

Because my kids are grown I had forgotten about these fun meatballs.  Home-style comfort food.  Adults love them, too!

I found it bland and I added more spice, etc than the recipe called for.   My husband loved it, reminded him of a childhood recipe his Mom made.  Glad I added an egg, but the meatballs still wanted to break apart.

I made this. It's the recipe my mom used years ago. You HAVE to use Minute Rice....for those of you whose rice was not cooked. I also use sauté onions in mine and a lot more tomato sauce. I also use more Worcestershire sauce.

I made it as is, just doubled the sauce.  While the meat seemed to loose at first (watery), they ended up being very moist and delicious. They are a little loose when browning so care is needed when turning, but even though I made a note to adjust next time, I ended up scratching that out.  Yummy.  My husband was a fan as was my 2 yr old granddaughter.

I just took these out of the oven!! OMG!!!! is all I can say! They are so good I can't stop eating them! But..... they will be put on top of red kidney beans then smothered in tomato/ spaghetti sauce and diced tomato's.. in my Le Cruet cast iron, favorite baking dish.. and slow cooked in the oven for 2-3 hours!!! I bet it's going to be Yummo!! One of the reviews said the recipe was a bit liquidy and hard to form into balls.... another said it was perfect! Mine had a bit to much liquid also, I added a few crushed up crackers. I almost think it wasn't the recipe but the fact that I used pork that I had frozen and thawed before making this!!

This was so good, it's definitely staying on the menu. The only thing I did different was add a little Worcestershire to the meat & a little extra garlic powder. I had left overs, added a little water to the sauce when warming & I swear they were better the next day.

Really liked this recipe. Instead of tomato sauce I used half a jar of spaghetti sauce because that's what I had on hand. I used the oven method. After the hour of baking I flipped each meatball over and baked an additional 12 minutes. Oh yeah and if you forget to add the 1/2 cup of water to the meat mixture it's ok to just add it to the liquid sauce mix at the end. It will cook the rice fine. 
This is a great basic recipe that I can modify many different ways for variety.

I wanted to make stuffed peppers for dinner tonight, but didn't want to use the oven, so I decided to incorporate bell peppers into this recipe and simmer on the stove top. I changed every single thing about this recipe and it was horrible!...Just kidding. Why does everyone do that!?  Anyway, I did leave out the celery salt (only because my guys don't like it) and used instant brown rice instead of white. I cut red and yellow bell peppers into large pieces, tossed that into the sauce and simmered until everything was cooked through and rice was tender. Served with mashed potatoes. My husband, son and I enjoyed it, so it's a winner in my book. Thanks for the recipe!

Both DH & I loved these porcupines.  I used brown rice & boiled it for 10 minutes, then drained & cooled before mixing with meat.  I substituted an egg for the water.  I added diced onion, peppers & celery & garlic, but wish I would have stuck with those being powdered, because as I browned the meatballs some didn't stick together.  I'm guessing that happened because the veggies released water as they cooked.  I was inspired by DeAnna to use some Bloody Mary Mix that was left-over.  After browning the meatballs, I poured the Mix in to not quite cover them.  Added some Worchestershire & horseradish.  Simmered 45 minutes.  Very pleased with how they turned out, but no fresh veggies the next time.

I double the recipe, substitute 1/2 pound country sausage for some of the burger, and bake it at 325 for 30 min, flip them over, cover with sauce and bake another 30 min.  I also use some delicious Amy's organic tomato soup and the Campbell's tomato soup.  We love the leftovers!!

Definitely use instant rice or precooked. Even after an extra 45 min in the oven, every other bite still had crunchy rice. I didn't use any salt, and I added cheese cubes in the center of the meatballs. I was also going to add finely chopped spinach, but I forgot. I put these on french baguette style bread for meatball subs. I liked it, and I may try again sometime in the future. Not bad for a quick meal, but wasn't a huge hit in my house.

You must use egg or the meatballs will fall apart.  The celery salt is too much, next I will reduce by half. I used instant rice.  This recipe is a great starter but I needs a few changes to be 5 stars.

very very good.  I had never had porcupine meatballs before.  I left out the tomato sauce and made a brown-gravy version only because my son refuses to eat anything with tomato sauce.  The whole pan was gone in a matter of minutes.  I only had medium grain rice, and was concerned that it might not cook all the way through, so I parcooked it in boiling water for about 4 minutes before adding it to the meat mixture (cooled)...it came out perfect!  Thanks for a keeper!

This recipe was pretty good, the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I had to cook it an extra 1/2 hour to have the regular rice be cooked.  I did make a couple changes, I used tomato soup in place of half of the tomato sauce, I also added, about 3 tbs of Hickory BBQ sauce and some liquid smoke to the sauce, the rest of the ingredients were the same.  I did double the recipe.  Also when doing the oven method as I did I suggest broiling on high so the tops of the meatballs get browned before adding the sauce.  Overall though it came out very well ty!

I actually was kind of disappointed with this. The meatballs were actually perfect- it was the sauce that didn't impress me at all. I found it very bland and missing some zip. I had read one of the reviews before making it and someone had suggested using vinegar in the sauce which I think I will try that next time in hopes it gives it the zing that I felt it lacked. My guy loved it though so I will definitely give it another go.

I liked the base of this recipe.  I substituted ground chicken for ground beef and used a dash of celery seed in place of celery salt.  I also used instant rice, cut the salt back to 3/4 t, and doubled the garlic powder.  I chose to bake the meatballs according to the alternate directions.   Our meatballs were a bit larger and needed to bake for an extra 15 minutes, uncovered.  This will be a regular on our dinner menu.
