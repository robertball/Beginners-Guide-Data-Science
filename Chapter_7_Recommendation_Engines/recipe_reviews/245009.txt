This borscht turned out really good. We made a few tweaks. Instead of water and boullion we used both a box of veggie broth and a box of chicken broth. And the flour and butter ratios seemed off so we used more butter and less flour and that seemed to work well. At the end we added chopped dill. I definitely recommend this recipe!

the flavour of this was awesome however adding the flour makes it extremely thick and that is the reason for the 4 stars. 
my husband said that it was extremely good but just too thick I will make this again however next time I will leave out the flour for thickening

Made a mistake and cubed the beets like the potatoes, but still turned out great. Added 1/2 a red onion, then served with crumbled bacon.
