Very good! I used butter instead of oil and margarine. Added garlic and unpeeled potato slices. Substituted evaporated milk and cream for the gorgonzola. And the best was a pinch of anise at the end.

This soup is phantastic!  I omitted the margarine and used only olive oil and used chicken stock instead of the water and bouillon powder. I also used light cream instead of the creamer.  I made a larger batch and froze several portions, and they came out great when thawed and heated. Tastes also great with chunks of ham and potatoes in it, for a light lunch, perhaps topped with croutons or toasted almonds.  This soup can also be made with Dolcelatte cheese instead of the Gorgonzola, but I prefer the spicier taste of the Gorgonzola.

This was very easy and quick to make.  Next time I would put a little less gorgonzola in, I found it a little bit too rich.  Maybe 2/3 the quantity just to let the flavour of the zucchini come through.  A great flavour base though, I'll make it again for sure!

I made this as written except I used whole milk and chicken bouillon.  Very cheap and easy to make.  Thank you.

This is wonderful for those that love their Blue Cheese. I did half the recipe, since it is just me right now. As far as changes really none, just a couple of subs., butter for the margarine and half-half for the non-dairy creamer.  They worked well.  I will say, it is very easy and tasty.  The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 is that I thought the Blue Cheese over powered the zucchini just a bit(even though I love my Blue Cheese) I just wanted a touch more zucchini flavor to come through.***Made a 2nd time and this time I used less Blue Cheese and I was disappointed, didn't taste it enough...oh, well. I think I'll stick to the recipe next time.

OMG!!!  This is the best soup I've ever had, hands down!  I used butter instead of margarine, used Silk brand creamer and added a good amount of pepper.  
I thought I'd have enough for lunch tomorrow, but my family gobbled it right up, no leftovers!  Thank you Alexy!
