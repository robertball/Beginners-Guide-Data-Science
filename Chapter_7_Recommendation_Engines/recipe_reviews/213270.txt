This Recipe was really good.  The pork was so tender.  I did not care for the sauce, however it may have cooked for too long.  I reduced the serving size to 4 and if sure did not need 8 hrs to cook.  Would have been ready within 4 hrs.

Definitely Different! i went with the apples and a yellow onion cause that's what i had on hand. I didn't have apple sauce but i had a can of pears i emulsified and poured over like apple sauce. after everything was cooked i used a hand emulsifier to blend the "sauce" together and then shredded the pork. the apples and pears made the sauce pretty sweet so I also added a can of cream of mushroom and about a tablespoon of yellow mustard to the mix. served it with a side of spaghetti squash with Parmesan cheese! yum!

Tried this recipe last night using Honey Crisp Apples and butterflying the roast, it was fantastic, the flavor of the fruit infuses the meat with a sweet and succulent accent of apple and the meat was soo tender that I literally could not pull it out of the crock pot without it falling to pieces (wound up using a large spoon, which worked out well because it let me get the right amount of sauce with each serving). This one is definitely one you should try for your family.

One thing to note though. I used a 6-quart crock pot and cut the recipe in half (on account of my only having a 3.5lb roast) and it filled the crock pot perfectly, I highly doubt the full recipe would have even come close to fitting in my crock pot. If you are going to make this recipe then pay attention to the amount of ingredients that you rack up, you may need to cut this in half to make it fit your cookware.

I had high hopes on this recipe and I cooked it as per the instructions and yes, it smelled wonderful but I was not at all happy with the results. It was bland and just did not live up to the authors hype on this recipe. Sorry, did not like it and probably will not prepare it again.

This turned out nicely.  We used pork tenderloin instead of roast because that was all the grocery store had at the time.  I also used onion powder instead of onions.  The flavor was good and a nice change of pace from other recipes I have made.

I made this for my parents when they came to visit.  Dad's a picky eater and we all loved it! I couldn't get as large a pork shoulder roast, so I sub with two smaller pork shoulder roasts, which altered cook time a lot.  Very excellent, will certainly be making again. Thanks for Sharing!

This was tender and flavorful, but it just wasn't my family's favorite.  Just a bit too sweet & cinnamon-y I suppose.  We generally love those flavors, but something about this was just over-powering.  The Allrecipes recipe for "Tangy Pork Roast" is a much better bet!

This was very easy and the aroma while cooking was wonderful.  The meat was very juicy and had a great flavor.  DH ate the cooked apples, which I didn't care for, but the meat was very very good.  I cut the recipe in half, just incase we didn't like it, but I think it is a keeper.

I was really disappointed in the end result of this since I had been looking forward to it. I'm not sure if I did something wrong but the pork wasn't tender at all and the sauce didn't have a special taste to it. Had tons of leftovers and was even worse re-heated. I really wish it had turned out like I had wanted! :0(

So VERY disappointed in this and went strictly on the authors rating instead of the other ppl on the site....I wont do that again. 
It was VERY bland and the apples and sauce did nothing for me. The only thing good about this was how tender it was but it left alot to be desired. I followed the recipe perfectly so know that it turned out the way it was supposed to

My husband HATES applesauce and he had seconds. The meat was perfect and the flavors worked so well together. I used a cinnamon stick instead of ground cinnamon. I also cut the recipe in half,lowered the temperature 4hrs into the cooking time and shortened the cooking time to 6 hrs. perfect dinner.

This was delish and so easy to make.  For the sauce, I had two pears and three plumcots that were getting a little overripe so I mushed them in with two small containers of plain applesauce and a little pumpkin pie spice since I couldn't find my cinnamon and it worked out well.  I also found reading the reviews very helpful and they inspired to improvise and use up what I had on hand.

I loved this. I added regular vinegar and cooked on low instead of high. I then used a recipe from here for quick easy dinner rolls (no yeast) and made it into one layer. When it was done cooking, I put the pork and apple mixture on top. Delicious! And I used regular applesauce and no cinnamon.

The meat turned out very tender. I cooked it on low for 8 hours, and it turned out perfect. DH loved it! This was something different than we normally have, and it is always fun to try new things. I will definitely make it again. Like other reviews, it was missing a little "something". Next time I will skip the apple sauce, or at least GREATLY reduce it to maybe 1/3-1/2 cup. I will add an extra onion and some garlic. The sweet and warm flavor of the apples and cinnamon need a back-bone.

I need to remember to read reviews and not count on the stars. This recipe is actually pretty bland. I did cut it down as I only had a 2lb roast, so it took more like 4.5 hrs to cook on high. 3 hrs in, I realized how bland it was going to be, so I opened a can of frozen orange juice, mixed about 1/3 cup frozen OJ with 1/3 cup warm water and poured it over the roast. It did help the flavor, but I won't use this recipe again.

I have made this several times and shared it with friends and LOVE it. Very, very tender meat. I do use more sliced apples and onions and less apple sauce than called for.
My favorite way to eat this is shredded in a bowl, with a sprinkling of sharp cheddar and a generous dollop of hot or sriracha sauce.

I seared the pork with an all seasoning before putting it in the slow cooker. I like a little salty with sweet. I also used Apple pie spice instead of just cinnamon, because I was out of cinnamon. It was GREAT!I will definitely make this again!

We made this as per the recipe; however, with the juice from the pork and the applesauce it became quite wet and the roast poached rather than roasted with inconsistent cook throughout the meat.   Because of this it is unlikely we willmake this again.

I made this last night and I loved it!! I grew up with a "pork chops & applesauce" mentality. I love that with this recipe I did not have to dip my pork into cold applesauce. Also because of using fresh apples, it was not as sweet. The pork was tender and juicy! I did add red peppers to the seasonings on the porch because I love the sweet and savory with a little spice. Thank you for posting this recipe!

This is a good base recipie. I used Apple Pie spice after reading several reviews. I also put a dry onion soup mix on the pork like a rub. We don't care for mushy apples, so I will make some kind of change there. Overall a easy good recipe.

While not divine it was incredibly easy and good. Nice for fall or if you have apples about to go bad. I'd like to find a way to keep the apples a little firmer.

I rubbed the pork loin with dijon mustard which added a nice extra flavor

This is so good. I made this to serve 6 and won't make that mistake again. Kids and hubby wanted more for the next  3 days. Didn't have applesauce so skipped it  but i did mix a jar of Bavarian kraut with onions and apples and it was out of this world!!!!!  We just poured the broth over our mashed potatoes no need to make gravy.  Thanks for the recipe. Will keep it.

This turned out really well, but I can definitely see others viewpoints.  It was really sweet and the meat kind of lost its own flavor making it all a little bland.  I think I may add some crushed red pepper or thai pepper to it next time to give it a little kick.

Absolutely loved this! My roast was smaller so I had to adjust the cooking time and other ingredients, but it beat expectations (and the disappointing smell while it cooked). I used cinnamon applesauce instead of adding cinnamon and it was just the right amount of flavor. The sauce was so good, I could have made a meal out of that  :)

It was fall apart tender but not quite what I expected. I thought it would be sweeter.

I made this last night and it was very tender and tasty-- my family enjoyed it! a nice alternative to BBQ sauce.  I had an 8.5lb pork roast, and I cooked it for 8.5 hours on high and 1 hour on low; just because I had a big piece of meat and wanted to be sure it cooked all the way thru. Pork fell off the bone!! I did not use cinnamon applesauce, I used plain and used less cinnamon. I will make this again but next time will use less applesauce and less apples, there was a lot of liquid. but it was very good! thank you for sharing!!
