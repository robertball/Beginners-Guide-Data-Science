I made this cake for a birthday this week and it was ok as is but I think a couple of changes would make it better. Next time I will use all peanut butter chips in the cake and spread on too but swap out some of the flour with unsweetened cocoa. In my opinion it needed a bigger peanut butter flavor but the base recipe was very moist and a good starting place. Thank you for posting!!
