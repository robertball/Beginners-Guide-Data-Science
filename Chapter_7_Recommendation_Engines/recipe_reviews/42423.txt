This is a pretty quick, easy, comfort food.  I did add garlic powder, white pepper, and also finely diced red and green bell pepper.  It really needed some color!  I added parsely & paprika to the top to also give the top some color.

This was surprisingly good!  Better than I expected.  It didn't really taste like macaroni and cheese.  The cheese sauce made it very smooth and creamy though.  I left out the milk because it was plenty creamy without it (my box of mac and cheese was only 12 ounces, I may have used it if I'd had the extra 2 ounces of noodles).  I used about 2 cups of leftover baked salmon, and left off the bread crumb topping because we don't care for it.  Next time I'm going to try adding some french fried onions to the top.

Would not change a thing!  I have a family of 5 that include 2 teenage boys and while they pretty much eat anything, I was initally a bit worried they wouldn't like this- they were mad I didn't make a larger batch- it went quick!  Very easy to put together- easy enough for them to learn how to make it!

I made this a couple of days ago and although my DH & DS were skeptical, they loved it! DS ate exactly half of the 9x13" casserole. I did make a couple of changes to suit our taste. First, I used a family-size pan of Stouffer's mac & cheese that I nuked for 18 minutes. Since DH won't eat mushrooms, I used cream of chicken with herbs soup. Instead of the milk, I added a can of Ro-Tel tomatoes. I also used more onions than called for. Also, for this size dish, I used 3 6-oz. cans of salmon. I topped it with panko bread crumbs and no more cheese  - it was cheesy enough. It will definitely become a staple in our house.

Delicious. But I changed a few things. I used whole grain pasta shells instead of mac&cheese. A little less fattening. And I layered the bottom of the baking dish with broccoli. I didn't use bread crumbs or butter either. Turned out so good.

This was pretty good. I always try to include some vegetables so I used green onions and also added 1/2 green and red pepper. Broccoli would work too. Also used 2 cans of salmon and some ground pepper. I would definitely make again.

It's very good.  My husband was very weary at first, but then he requested that I make it for Thanksgiving.  I only added some seasoned salt and black pepper to taste.

This was really yummy and really easy. I was at home sick with two kids the first time i made it. We were totally out of milk and cheddar cheese. I substituted Monterrey Jack and just left a tiny bit of the salmon juice in. Turned out creamy and delicious. I also used a whole 15oz can of salmon, skin and bones, and it definitely wasn't too much or too fishy. Will make again!

Wonderful recipe! I used Kraft Dinner for the macaroni and cheese,  and leftover salmon rather than canned salmon. I'll be making this again. Thanks for the recipe!

I'll admit I was a little leery at first, but I was pleasantly surprised. Both my husband and I really enjoyed this dish. I did make two changes though, I used smoked salmon instead of the canned stuff, and I didn't add any onion. If you do use smoked salmon do NOT add any salt.

Fine. Edible. But boring and pretty much just Tuna Noodle Casserole with a different fish.

Great recipe! Next time I will try to use salmon that is NOT smoked, because the smoky flavor was a little overpowering.

Quick & easy to throw together.  Had to use up an 18oz. boneless raw salmon in my fridge & had 2 boxes of Kraft white cheddar mac&cheese lying around.  I just doubled the recipe, except 18oz salmon, not 12oz. (only for those who like salmon, this was a good amount & I think less would've been not enough seafood.)  I also thought 1tbsp of onion was not enough (how can you even taste that little?) so added 1/2 an onion to the original recipe list.  As an added touch, I put a thin layer of sliced cheddar on top while it baked so it would melt over the whole dish. Looked yummy! Dad and the 2 girls (10&7) went for thirds  At least 2 of them will usually think I need more salt in things I make, but I didn't need to put any in! It tasted great the way it was.  You can look at my submitted photo for my first try at this recipe.

Very easy to make and was all gone.  I'll have to double the recipe next time since it was devoured by my husband and son so quickly.  I added some chopped spinach for some extra veggies, but otherwise made it according to recipe.

This was quick and easy to make.  My husband loved it so much he was back for more a few hours after dinner.  If you are lucky to have any leftover it makes a great lunch.

I doubled the recipe and added approximately 1/2 cup diced onion, 1 diced red pepper, approximately 1/2 cup diced mushrooms, approximately 1 cup diced cauliflower (would have used broccoli if I had it instead) about a tsp of dill and 1/2 tsp ground coriander seed.  Very easy to make ahead of time, I'm sure the family will love finding this one waiting for them tonight.  Serving with a tossed salad.

I used a few substitutions due to current stock in kitchen and the dish was very tasty as well.  Used monterey jack instead of cheddar cheese, a substitute for the soup, canned tuna instead of salmon, and added some bacon bits for a bit of a smoky flavor.  Peas would be good in this as well.  I would rate this about 4.25-4.5.  Very nice and easy recipe!

For anyone needing Gluten Free, this works with two boxes of Annies mac and cheese.  Don't add the milk/butter in the Annies instructions, just put the cheese powder in with the mushroom soup.  Otherwise it's too watery and not enough cheese flavor.  Then Gluten free cafe mushroom soup, and ground up two slices of Udi's GF bread made this recipe work for Gluten free. One can of tuna also is just as good as the salmon.  To make sure my family got veggies I also threw in spinach.

I changed mine up...i used alfredo sauce instead of regular mac n cheese and used onion powder instead of actual onions because my husband "says" he doesnt like them...this way he never knows =) I added some sliced mushrooms and topped it with cheese and crispy onions and it was SUPER DELICIOUS...will totally make again.

I was pleasantly surprised. I really don't like the taste of fish. I was hoping that this dish would hide it. It did pretty well but I probably will try something else next time.

This turned out really good. My boyfriend, who I didn't really expect to be crazy about this, wanted to know if we had any leftovers for tonight. It was a good way to cook salmon without being fishy. Next time I am going to skip the bread crumbs and sprinkle some cheese on top and I am going to try to mix in some fat free cottage cheese to add some more protein. Hopefully that will work out, if not, there is always pizza hut.
