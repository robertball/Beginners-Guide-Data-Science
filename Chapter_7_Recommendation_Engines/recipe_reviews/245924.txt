I read the reviews before I made this and decided to cut the peppers length way so I had two peppers to fill.  I made 6 halves with three peppers.  I blanched the peppers in boiling water for about 10 min. then plunged in cold water.  I did not add cinnamon as this seemed odd to me.   I added about a half a cup of white wine with the vinegar as I felt it needed it. Next time I will use diced tomatoes as was suggested by hubby which I think would have given the dish some extra layers.  It was a great  inexpensive dinner by all with a tossed salad.

A very nice stuffed pepper recipe using smoked sausage and orzo instead of the usual ground beef and rice. The Italian seasoning is also an unexpected flavor. I like that a typical stuffed pepper is no longer typical and what is usually expected. My only almost complaint is that the pepper is not quite cooked through and is still too crisp. Next time, perhaps I can cover the peppers with a tent of foil for only 5-8 minutes in order to let the pepper cook just a little more but not allow the cheese to become too brown.

I will definitely make this again but without the peppers. The Chorizo and Orzo were delicious on their own.

I probably will not make this recipe again.  My husband did not care for it either.

I used ground spicy sausage (cooked until brown and crumbly) and omitted the cinnamon.  I also used the Trader Joe's Rice Orzo Pilaf Mix for my pasta element.  Otherwise, I didn't change a thing and the dish was a success!

The reviews were mixed with the family.  For our personal taste, I would add a little more garlic.  The peppers didn’t cook thoroughly, but I don’t like mushiness so it worked for me.  I thought they were a nice twist on a stuffed pepper.

Fantastic and relatively easy to make.  The prepping of the peppers was the worst part.  My wife's son actually ate it and he hasn't eaten a vegetable in the 8 years I've known him!!!  I added mushrooms and bacon crumbles as well.  I WILL make this again!!!

Great recipe!
I didn't have the same ingredients, or need to make as many.  So, I used 3 red peppers cut boat-wise, used medium sized shell noodles, ring sausage instead, small sliced and halved both zucchini and yellow squash, onion, and topped with cheese.  Came out Great!
I love to see what I can make with what I have on hand.
Thank You for another great recipe!

This was relatively easy for a weeknight dinner, and delicious as well! The bonus is that the meat, veggie, and starch are all in one "pot" and dinner is served!!

My husband made this with chicken sausage.  Added fresh oregano toward the end.  Absolutely delicious!
