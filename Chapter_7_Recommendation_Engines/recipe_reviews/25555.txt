Delicious, light and moist tasting.  I modified it a bit to make it easier to prepare.  Used McCormick's poppyseed in a jar and once I did soak to soften, but then the second time I made it I used the poppyseeds without soaking. Either way is delicious.  Also used lemon pie filling to save on prep time, although it would be just as delicious made in a bundt pan with a lemon glaze (lemon juice & powdered sugar). Co-workers  were very impressed when I brought it to the office.

This was delicious, held together well and perfect for frosting. I am terrible at following recipes to the "T" and I wanted a lemon poppy seed cake (plus I am at high altitude), so I also made a few adjustments to flour & leavening of the cake. I followed the filling recipe perfectly, as it is too risky to mess with "puddings" in my opinion!
•	1/2 cup poppy seeds
•	4 eggs
•	1 1/2 cups white sugar
•	1 1/2 cups sour cream
•	4 tbsp butter (room temp)
•	1 tsp vanilla extract
•	1 tsp almond extract
•	2 tbsp fresh lemon zest
•	2 3/4 cups cake flour
•	2 teaspoons baking powder
•	1/2 teaspoon baking soda
•	1/2 teaspoon salt

Too many poppy seeds for my taste, others also commented on the excessive quantity. While I didn’t care much for the cake (seemed like giant muffin to me due to density) but others liked it. I’m a sucker for short cuts so for the filling I did 1 sm package of instant lemon pudding and 1 cup whipping cream, ¼ cup milk. I’ll probably try this again with less poppy seeds and maybe a little bit of lemon extract in the cake batter. I was short on time so I didnt soak the seeds, no one seemed to mind.

I followed the recipe almost exactly with the following exceptions: I used light sour cream, and I also didn't rinse the poppy seeds, because ordinary culinary poppy seeds are normally free of any opioids that need to be rinsed off.  I did make one mistake, which is that I greased AND floured the pan.  I don't recommend flouring the pan as it makes the sides of the cake look dull.   I had not baked a cake from scratch in close to 20 years, and this cake turned out GORGEOUS -- too pretty to frost, really.  I baked it in a bundt pan, so it took just under 45 minutes to be done.  I drizzled the lemon-orange filling over the top as a glaze, so it was a bit sticky since it wasn't meant to be a glaze, but the flavor was amazing and really complements the cake.  I served it at a brunch for friends and it got rave reviews.  This is definitely a repeat for me!

The  first time I made this I didn't make any changes, and it tasted amazing, the second time I had to substitute regular sugar for powdered sugar (sugar + corn starch), I ran out of Sour Cream so I added some Almond Milk, and I forgot to put Baking Soda in the Batter before I put it into the oven. I hope it will come out just as great! I am serving this delicious desert for my church, because we are doing a Missions Fair, and my Mission is the Rue Family to Ukraine. I could not ask for a better desert to top my research on the Rue Family.

My daughter made this to take to school, because she was doing a report on Ukraine. It was moist, and the only thing we changed...we only used 1/4 cup of poppy seeds. I would change a couple of things, if I made this for myself or to take anywhere. I would add the juice from a fresh lemon to the cake batter. I would omit the orange juice and just increase the lemon juice in the filling. I wouldn't frost it, but just put a lemon glaze on it.
