The recipe is good the way it is; I happen to like some extra feta. Like one other reviewer, I had enough filling for both sheets of dough, but I was using a big bunch of fresh spinach and it would be tough to tell the volume of filling until after it cooked down. I would suggest that the authors of the recipe may call it anything they like. Sure, it could be spanakopita had they chosen to use phyllo dough. The one thing I would never suggest is using crescent dough. Reviewing a recipe makes absolutely no sense if you are rating your own changes.

I made this "spanakopita" as the previous reviewer called it.  I added a whole bunch of other stuff and found it to be way too rich with my ingredients.  I used Pilsbury butterflake crescent rolls.  I sauted red onion, fresh spinach, garlic, sliced black olives, parmesane cheese and feta cheese in extra vergin olive oil before spooning the mix into the center of the crescent dough and sealing them in to little pods.  Baked for 15 minutes and it was yum yum yum but very heavy/rich. I would make again but next time I might not be so heavy handed with the ingredients.

I like this recipe and use it pretty frequently, but it isn't a calzone- it's spanakopita.  Calzones mainly have mozzarella cheese and maybe a little vegetables.  This is mainly spinach and a little feta- spanakopita.  I would give it five stars if it was named properly!

This was recipe was pretty good. Everyone seemed to really enjoy them. However, I used Rhodes frozen dinner rolls instead of the puff pastry.

Fantastic. We added salt/chile & some lemon juice to take it up a notch.  We made pinwheels out of these instead of triangle pockets.  Well received & delicious!!!

i think this is a very good recipe. it may not be a calzone but it's definitely not spanakopita either (which is super futzy and is made with layers and layers of phylo dough). anyway, who cares?! it's yummy!

it was very good, except next time I will use a little less spinach and add a little more feta.. Also, me and my friend took the leftovers out the next day to snack on and found they taste even better cold!

These are delicious and loved by everyone!  Great for parties.  I had enough filling for 2 sheets of puff pastry.  Maybe I didn't roll out the dough enough.  It was awesome anyway!
