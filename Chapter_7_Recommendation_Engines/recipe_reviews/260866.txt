Made as written and this turned out great! I wouldn't really call it a bark but still good. Hindsight I could have spread the mixture out thinner to get more of a bark thickness instead of a rice crispie treat thickness but it was hard to judge based on how thick it was. Live and learn. Hubs said it tasted very similar to a Reese's. I don't eat sweets so he took this to work with him to share and it was all gone in less than 5 minutes. With only 3 ingredients, you really can't go wrong with this.

This makes a very rich peanut butter bark. I like the crunch the Rice Krispies give it. This is not something I would want as a dessert, but it would be nice for a party dessert buffet or as part of a cookie/treat basket to give away.
