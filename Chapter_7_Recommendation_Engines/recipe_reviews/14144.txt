i thought this recipe was awesome. the only thing i did different was instead of frying them,(seemed too time consuming)i put the mixture on top of little tortillas, sprinkled it with cheese, and baked them in the oven for 10 minutes at 350. then i topped them with sour cream and guacamole. its sooooooooooo good, and the tortillas get nice and crispy. yum!

Pretty good.  I found an answer to the flipping problem. I mashed the beans with a fork. I did saute ALL the veggies. Then added cumin, chili powder, chili flakes, and some chopped jalepeno. And salt and pepper. Added the beans and cooked a little longer. You now have a sort of paste that spreads on the tortillas. Push down a little and it flips perfectly. For those of us who can't use a whole can of beans at once. I cook up a big pot of black beans till just done but firm. Drain. Put them on a cookie sheet and cover with plastic. Freeze. In the morning put them in a big freezer bag a freeze till you need some. You can just grab a handful anytime you need them.

To me this recipe is a good start. The flavors work well together but some items were a little out of proportion. For instance, 1 cup of cheese (if you're making 6) is way too little. Also, you'll note that many other reviewers were adding other things. That's because on it's own it lacks character. Next time I'm going to add some jalepenos or crushed red pepper. As far as the frying, I don't see why it was necessary. I spritzed the pan with some olive oil before putting the tortilla in the pan and it worked phenomenally well. Nice, golden and crunchy. Forget a quarter cup and just squirt some olive oil into the pan before each quesadilla goes in. Like I said, a very good start and I will make this again with a number of revisions.

This is a great recipe! The canned black beans I found also had jalapeno, which I picked out when rinsing, but the flavor remaining still gave the mix quite a 'kick'.  Instead of frying, I brushed the tortillas with olive oil (and also topped with more of the cheese) and baked at 400 degrees for about 5 minutes (could go longer if you like them crunchy).

DELISH!!! I used the big tortillas and brushed it with extra virgin olive oil and baked it in the oven at 400 for a couple min. My husband who is extremly picky and always insists on meat for dinner loved it as well, Thanks for sharing this recipe I will  definetley be making this for dinner agian.

While this isn't gourmet in any way, it certaintly is yummy.  I folded the tortillas in half, and then filled them, much less dangerous than flipping a full tortilla.  I'd urge you to try this if you're looking for something simple that people are guaranteed to like.

This is an okay start.  I made this a lot more streamlined by using salsa in place of the tomatoes, onions, etc, and just mixed it with the black beans. Also, I love refried beans and salsa, so I added that also, and had a chunky paste to spread on.  Instead of taking the time to assemble these then try to move them, I just assembled them in the pan. I put the tortilla in the heated pan, carefully spread on the filling, sprinkled with cheese, then flipped. Not a bad start, but I think it would be pretty plain without the refried beans.  Also, I is more than enough for four servings IMO.

I wanted to update this since we've made changes since the first time.  We omitted the corn and tomato and added mushrooms, which I sautee in butter, garlic and a bit of wine, then we add the chopped onion and the juice from one lime and sautee a bit more, then add chopped red pepper and a bit of lime zest.  Sautee a bit more then add 1/8 cup water and the rinsed beans.  Cook until heated through, make the quesadillas and cook in the over (350) until crisp and melty.  I recently served this for dinner with a 12 year old and he LOVED it.  Didn't even care that there was no meat!

This is a great recipe. Just the filling is so versatile. I've made the delicious quesadillas many times, and I use the leftover bean filling to make fantastic omelets. You can spread it over tortilla chips with some cheese and pop in the microwave for instant nachos. I've even tossed the leftover filling in vegetable broth with a little cooked rice and made a great soup! Delicious, cheap, no meat, what more could you ask for???

Made a great lunch for us this afternoon.  I used garlic powder and sprinkled some cumin and chili powder in the mix.  I baked my tortillas at 400 for about 15 minutes and they were perfect. Will make again.

This was FANTASTIC!  I was missing a few items, but it was still amazing.  That's what's so great about this recipe.  It doesn't matter if you don't have all the ingredients--in fact, you can add several that aren't even listed and it will still turn out great!  I've had this 3 times already in the past week.  The first time I made it, I was missing tomatoes and garlic (and I just didn't want to add corn), and I added some taco seasoning to the veggies.  The 2nd & 3rd time I made it, I added some chopped olives and sliced jalapenos.    Thanks so much for a yummy new staple!

The concept of these was great, but even though I don't usually modify recipes the first time I try them, I couldn't serve them with no spice added. I added salt, pepper, chile powder and cumin, and they were delicious. I also baked them rather than frying to save calories. 400 oven, for about 20 minutes made them nice and crispy. You don't need to flip them this way, so you can pile on the delicious filling. Served with low fat sour cream and salsa, chicken wings on the side for the meat eaters. Thanks!

I truly dislike beans and never eat them.  After cooking these for vegetarian guests, I tasted them.  And they could not stop eating.  Delish, even for a 'bean hater'.

These are awesome! I did use a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles instead of the tomatoes. I also added more garlic and a little chili powder. We put them on a cookie sheet in the oven at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes and didn't even need to flip them.

This was good, but needed a little more flavor. I added lots of lemon and cumin, but next time I will also add jalapeno, and cilantro. I used corn tortillas instead of flour and added some chicken. It also works good just eating it like a taco with melted cheese on top. Thanks for sharing!!

Very good. I substituted a can of rotell for the fresh tomatoes and green peppers and added some cumin. Didn't fry in oil, just sprayed a nonstick pan with olive oil spray and cooked for a minute on each side.

This recipe is a good starter to what could be made into a great dish.  You really need to spice it up a little to make it good though.  I put about 2tbls. of chili powder in, a dash or two of saffron, and some salt.  My husband can't wait for me to warm up some more for lunch tomorrow.

I made these for me and a friend, and we both loved them. I had some leftover filling, and they are just as good (maybe even better!) the next day. To avoid the mess I also found it easier to use one tortilla folded in half. Also, after my disaster frying them in a skillet, I tried brushing a indoor grill with oil, and cooking them on there (which also avoided the hassel of flipping!)- it worked perfectly!

Great recipe. One additional - 1 tablespoon of cumin and 1 teaspoon of salt. It gives this dish some much needed favor. This is a great recipe.

I baked these, which was easier and healthier than frying them. Due to a tomato snafu, I replaced the tomato with spinach and tomato paste (long story). They turned out well, if a little messy! I added some spices (chili powder and red pepper) too.

This was a really great recipe! I'm a bit of a picky person so I made a few small changes. I mashed half of the beans before heating them in the pan, used a mix of cheddar and monterey jack cheese, and I baked the finished product (no flipping in the pan) to crisp the tortilla. I think next time I would also add a dash of cumin for a little extra flavor.

These were easy and turned out awesome. I used another reviewer's suggestion and instead of onions, tomatoes, and green peppers, I just used chunky salsa with the black bean and corn mixture. Turned out really tasty. I also substituted a little olive oil instead of the vegetable oil to cook the tortillas.

This recipe is very good and easy to make.  I used more cheese and did the filled tortillas in the oven, brushing the outsides with the oil (400 degrees for 10 minutes flipping halfway through).  We used sour cream for topping at the table.  I will definitely make these again!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It's a great meatless alternative!  I did add some salt and pepper, though.

If you're having trouble flipping the quesadilla, try this: instead of frying your dish, spray a round pizza pan or a metal cookie dish with cooking spray, and coat the outside of your quesadilla, too.  Bake in the oven for four to five minutes.  To flip, place a plate on top of the tortillas, and using a potholder, quicky flip the entire thing onto the plate.  Then, simply slide it back onto the baking pan and cook for another four to five minutes.  Perfect, crispy quesadilla with no mess on your stove!

This was the first time I have fried anything in my life, and these turned out so good!! Even my picky brothers liked them. Instead of stacking the tortillas, I just put folded each one in half at frying time. A easy, tasty recipe.

Too Bland as written.  Next time I will add some fresh cilantro and cumin at a minimum.  Chili powder may be necessary too.  An entire tortilla is difficult to flip so fill up half of the tortilla and fold it in half.  Makes it much easier to flip in the skillet.

Great recipe! Was planning on making quesadillas tonight and thought this would be a great way to enjoy summer veggies as well. 
Had leftover corn on the cob so I used that and some of my sister's garden Roma tomatoes. I did add some cumin as other readers suggested and a little chili powder. Instead of using the stove or oven, I thought I'd put the quesadilla maker to use. By using that, I didn't need to use any additional oil. Absolutely delicious!

Loved these!! Will probably add some jalapeños next time for a little flair. The flavors worked well together. Also I will bake them next time because although they were delicious fried, they will be healthier baked. I saved the veggies and beans in the fridge overnight and it was even better in the morning! Thanks for sharing, I really enjoyed these!!!!

It was good. I didn't really measure because I calculated the servings to 4 and the measurements were all hooey. Added cumin and cayenne to the bean/veggie mixture. Served with guacamole.

This tastes great and is super easy with just a little tweaking. I added a little can of jalapeno salsa, and used the George Foreman grill instead of frying. I didn't measure the chedder, but we try to eat as little dairy as possible and with just a little in each one it still tasted really great!

I love quesadillas and I didn't like these much.  If I were to do it again, I would use roasted peppers and omit the corn.  The super-chunky/crunchy texture was a little too much for my taste.  They could use some spice as well, so I added cumin.

These were very yummy, but I did need to spice it up a little with salt and cumin. I added about 1/2 tsp. salt and 1 tsp. of cumin. I also used extra sweet corn, and the flavor was wonderful. This has become one of my regular recipes.

Easy and fun to make. I used the smaller 6" tortillas. I placed the tortilla in my pan, added toppings to one side, and folded the tortilla in half. This is much easier than the traditional method and less messy. This recipe is not spicy at all, so if you like some heat, add hot peppers or dip into spicy salsa. I'll definitely make these again!

I accidently openned a can of black beans (thought I had a can of black olives), I got on allrecipe.com and typed in the word black beans and came across this recipe, I had all the ingredients so I made them, it was the best mistake I ever made.  I added some taco sauce to hold the ingredients together and they turned out great. Husband and son both loved them. Will definetly be making these again.

This is a wonderful tasty dish, however, I think it makes 6-8 servings, instead of just four. It is great to have the leftovers though. One important observation, use a griddle instead of a skillet. I started using a large skillet as in the directions and when I attempted to flip the quesadilla, I started a small fire!! All the filling and oil went everywhere. I quickly started using a griddle and didn't have a problem.

I really liked how simple this recipe was and that there wasn't a ton of ingredients.  But even so, the taste was really good.  And not unhealthy!  Easy, quick and ideal for one person or many.

What a great meal we had for dinner tonight! I followed the recipe until the very end. I tasted it and like some others have noted, it was rather bland, hence the 4 stars instead of 5 I would give for the final product. I added sea salt, cumin, and chili powder, a little at a time until I liked it. I served it with Mexican Rice I by Michele O'Sullivan (made with brown and wild rice) and guacamole by Bob Cody. Back to the quesadillas, I folded each one in half and spread a little butter on one side of the outside. I put on a big spoonful of beans and topped with shredded cheese (much more than the recipe called for). I cooked them on the electric grill until browned on each side. Topped with sour cream. Delicious! Thank you!

Yum, these were good!  I halved the recipe and lightened it up by not using the vegetable oil but just spraying my skillet lightly with cooking spray and using reduced fat cheese.  I also added in a little italian seasoning and cumin and simmered the bean mixture with a lid on for about 15 minutes to let everything marry together.  This is almost the same exact ingredients that I use to top my potato skins with for taco skins.  Thanks for this great vegetarian quesadilla idea!

These were really good. I used butter instead of oil for cooking them. And I left out the corn, not a fan. Also added some Monterrey Jack Cheese.

My family loves this recipe. We do a vegetarian meal at least one night a week and this is a favorite. I usually use less of the vegetables it suggests though and still have some of the mixture left over. Today, for my daugther's after school snack , I made nachos and used the veggy leftovers as the toppings. It was delicious! A great way to make the grocery budget go further and an easy way to sneak in an extra veggy serving for the day!

My husband loves these veggies. I serve them a little differently though, I just make the veggies as directed, doubling the garlic and leaving out the tortillas, and serve them to my hubby with cheese melted on top whenever I need a quick and yummy side dish/

It's good and filling, but needs some spices in my opinion - wasn't as flavorful as I'd hoped. Next time I'm going to add some black pepper, salt and maybe chili powder.

Very yummy!  A great way to turn a boring cheese quesadilla into something full of flavor that is also pretty healthy!

It's a good quick meal. I added one adobo pepper, chopped to the onion mixture. It added good flavor & heat.

Pretty good but a little bland as written. I added a jalapeno, salt, pepper, cumin and more cheese. This is a very easy and flexible recipe and I usually have all of the ingredients in my pantry so it's perfect for those nights when I'm scrambling to figure out what we're going to eat for dinner.

I made this for dinner for just myself and loved it.  I put the remaining bean mixture in the fridge and my husband didn't know it was for quesadillas so he just ate it by itself.  He thought it was great =)  It also made a great burrito filling.

You know, this came out really well for bean quesadillas, but the next time I wanted to make these, I forgot the tortillas, green pepper, and cheese.  I panicked for a minute and then remembered I had Fritos scoop chips.  I decided to turn the bean quesadilla filling into a dip base. I used a 4 oz can of chopped chili peppers stirred while heating the vegetables.  I also added a 1/4 cup of lime juice and sprinkled in about a tablespoon of dried cilantro for an extra kick.  YUM YUM YUM!

As other reviewers have said, these are very difficult to flip.  I never fry quesadillas, but instead brown in a skillet with cooking spray.  I used the leftover filling on nachos and it was heavenly.  I covered chips with the filling, sprinkled with cheese, and heated to melt.  Then I topped with salsa, sour cream, and jalapenos.  In the future, I will make the filling specifically to use as a nacho topping.  Thanks.

I don't know that Ive ever been so excited about a Quesadilla recipe before!!  I absolutely loved this, it was quick and easy and tasted so much better than expected!  As a rule of thumb for this site I always double the spices, so when I saw there were none in this I added some chili powder, paprika, and cumin to the mix as well as some Jalapenos (leaving out the corn).  Then baked for 10 minutes, HEAVEN!

This was really good but like a lot of people I did modify the recipe because it was a little bit simple.  I added diced jalapeno peppers to the mixture and tossed in a bit of seasoning: cayenne pepper, paprika, and cumin added quite a bit of flavor.  It was hard to flip the flour tortilla, though.

This is a good start...could use a little fajita seasoning and/or garlic salt.  Also, works well to smash the black beans a little so that they act as more of a binder and your filling isn't rolling all over the place.  Plus, it's so hard to flip quesadillas that are assembled with one tortilla on top and one on the bottom.  I like to put filling on one half of tortilla and fold it over to make a half-moon shape.  Much easier.

I made a few changes, but the main thing I wanted to comment on was the cooking method I used...a panini press. It works great for these and doesn't dry out the tortilla like baking them in the oven and you'll avoid the potential mess that could ensue from trying to flip them in a frying pan.

My entire family just ate these. I repeat. My husband and two children ate beans and vegetables! Awesome recipe. I used homemade beans; green, red and yellow peppers because thats what I had; added salsa instead of the tomatoes and used someone else's recommendation to bake in the oven for 10 mins on 350. Quick, easy, healthy and delicious! Thanks!!!

Good basic recipe, but it needs much more flavor. I added homemade taco seasoning, cilantro and instead of black beans I used pinto beans just because I prefer this way. Baked at 350 degrees for 10 minutes.

This was a very easy, tasty recipe.  I added some red peppers to it and it made a very colorful dish.  I also folded the tortilla in half  instead of putting a second on top.  This made it easier to flip.  This is definitely a recipe to make again.

This is delicious! Frying it is a great idea - the crispy tortilla is to die for. When I made this, instead of chopping up tomatoes, I just poured in some Newman's Own salsa into the pan. This added a bit more flavor.

My advice is to invest $20.00 at Target for a quesadilla maker.  It makes perfect 10" quesadillas in 3 minutes without the mess.  This is the first recipe that we tried and we loved it.  It was a little soupy from the tomatoes, so we drained it. The entire family loved it and came back for more.  I doubled the recipe and froze some for a 5 minute dinner in the near future.

Made these for my meat eating family and they couldn't get enough.  I like to use my George Foreman grill to brown the tortillas instead of a skillet.  It goes faster since you can do both sides at once, and its healthier since you don't need oil.

As written I would only give this four stars, but with some modifications I think they would go to five stars.  I had most of a red pepper, so I used it instead of green.  I had to use a lot more cheese to hold them togeter, and I used a mixture of cheddar and pepper jack that gave them more of a kick.  I think with just cheddar they would be too bland.  I always cook my quesadillas on a griddle without any oil and they crisp up nicely.

These are great quesadillas...even good cold.  They make a great snack or a nice dinner with the addition of some rice, lettuce, tomato and sour cream on the side.

REALLY good. Be careful when flipping the quesadillas, and make sure the oil is not too hot (as mine was- burned myself). My kids loved this and we will add it to our regular rotation!

After making this recipe a few more times, I had to change my previous 4 star rating to 5 stars.  It's so delicious and it has become one of my favorite recipes.  I have to make it at least once every two weeks. 

The only change that I make is that I double the amount of cheese.  I usually bake it, as other reviewers suggested to brush both sides with oil and bake at 400 for 15 minutes, because it's easier and it tastes just as good as frying.  They're also delicious cold, right out of the refrigerator.

This was really yummy!  It seemed like nothing special as I was making it, but the flavors worked really well together.  The corn added a nice sweet taste and sour cream is a must!  We also added mushrooms and I just sprayed my skillet with cooking spray, rather than frying in the oil.  Will make again.

This recipes is awesome! These are by far the best quesadillas i've ever had. I've made this countless times over the past couple years, and i now just add my extra vegetables laying around(like red peppers, spuash, zucchini). I also use wheat tortillas and buy the 4 mexican cheese packages. A friend of mine who is a very picky eater said it was the best quesadilla he has ever had, even without cheese! I also dip them in light sour cream and medium salsa... BON APPETIT!

I made a few changes to this one.  Only about 1/4 cup chopped onion, no tomatoes, chopped roasted red peppers and only six tortillas instead of 12.  Delicious.  The kids loved them.  I will definitely make these again.

These were fabulous!  Recipe a little confusing in talking about stacking on a plate. Not necessary if you are cooking right then, but if you are cooking later (a great prepare ahead recipe) and want to "stack" on a plate, make sure to go shell, filling, shell, new shell, filling etc. I cooked in my electric skillet which worked great becuase the shells were bigger than any skillet I had.  The filling makes a lot and 1 or 2 is enough for 2 people so it could be cut in half or save filling for a treat later in the week!

Philly LIKED it! I have a picky hubby with lots of health considerations. It isn't easy feeding Philly and keeping him healthy. This recipe is one that will help. We used whole wheat tortillas and it was satisfying and fun to eat. No scrunchy faces on this one! I will be keeping this recipe in my menus, and that is saying a LOT!

I used big flavored tortillas and put one down on a cookie sheet then put the sauteed ingredients on it, then sprinkled cheese on top of that and pressed another tortilla on top of all that then slid it into a preheated oven!  Easy!  Served with salsa, sour cream, and sliced avocado.  So many things you can do with this and so many ways to make it yours.

Loved it! My fiance is always asking me to find some meals with less meat in them and I'm always resistant because I love me some meat. But I gave this one a shot and it was fantastic! I added some sweet corn and dropped the onion, maybe put in a bit more cheese than I was supposed to but this recipe is definitely a keeper :D

Wow these are great! I added a little salt, pepper & cumin and also a can of pinto beans. I didn't fry anything and I folded the tortilla in half instead of laying one on top of the other. Makes for easier flipping

I made this recipe twice. I love it! The 1st time a made it I used just a can of black beans, chili powder, thyme, extra sharp cheddar cheese, onions, and olive oil. The 2nd time (I actually just made 10 minutes ago) was a wee bit different. I used dark red kidney beans cuz I couldn't find my can of black beans anywhere. So I just had to make do. I did what the recipe said just different ingredients (which I used before, except this time I used hot pepper which I finely cut up and used kidney beans. I also cooked this in the oven for 10 minutes @350 F). I think the kidney bean one tasted better than the black! It's divine!! So if you don't have black beans on hand, excperiment and see what you come up with! I know I did and loved it! :D

Great taste. Nice and easy to make.
Use single tortillas and fold in half, 2 fit on large flat grill.
Add Cumin and some chilli powder, Salsa sauce and lots of cheddar cheese to the tortilla.

I followed the recipe but thought this was EXTREMELY boring (consider the ingredients ... they are all pretty basic. I did bake in the oven, lightly brushing the tortillas with light olive oil. Also, to reduce the carbs, I only used one tortilla at a time (like an open face sandwich) and then ate it like a soft taco. Tomorrow I'm going to buy a rotisserie chicken and shred some over the top before placing in the oven, in an effort to add some kick to the dish.

Why would you use 1/4 c oil for frying in this recipe? It's under "healthy dinners", and besides the oil is completely unnecessary.... A great basic idea, and hey I used it, but not really any kind of healthy with the oil, full fat cheese, and flour tortillas. If you slightly mash your beans (to help the two sides stick together), and add something spicy (jalapenos, even cilantro would work), then just fill and cook them in a dry pan (doesn't even have to be non-stick-- just wait for them to get nice and brown before trying to move them and they'll slide around neatly with minimal coaxing), you'll have a much healthier version. Also try it with corn tortillas if you can, they're better for you (less fat including saturated, less calories, less additives/ingredients).

I am only thirteen years old and tried making quesadillas for the first time. Though it involved a lot of cuting it was worth it in the end. These vegetarian quesadillas were a complete success. My entire meat eating family enjoyed them greatly and i would definently make them again. My only problem was that the amount of ingredients that were said to be used, were not enough to cover the number quesadillas that it should have. Regardless, they were wonderful.

This was an ok recipe. It was quick, easy, and cheap. Those are all pluses in my book! I did think that it lacked flavor. If some sort of seasoning was added, it would be much improved! A decent base recipe.

This Recipe was so good. I didn't even miss the chicken. I didn't use corn although I'm sure that would be good, and I added black olives. Even my husband liked it! I will surely make this again!

Another delicious way to have a quesadilla!  I made the recipe exactly as written and I wouldn't change a thing about it.  We enjoyed ours with olives, pico de gallo and sour cream.  Thanks for the awesome recipe.

Makes a great lunch.  I like that it's super easy!  I did make a few changes.  I used a can of corn and a can of petite diced tomatoes.  I also seasoned the mixture with cumin, chili powder, cayenne pepper, and season salt.  I made it for a group of meat eaters and everyone agreed we should add to our rotation of meals.

Excellent - First time I have made a quesadilla and am impressed by how good this tasted. Will make again for sure - but try baking as flipping on the frying pan was a bit too difficult for me.

Great recipe!  My husband is not a black bean fan but enjoyed it in this dish.  I chose to double the veggie/bean mix and fold the 12 in. tortillas in half, toasting them in the oven with double cheese.  Very good and economical for our large family of 6 costing about $10 for the entire meal.

Made this EXACTLY per the recipe, but I found it to be lacking in taste and very dry.  Next time (if there is a next time), I think I'd substitute salsa for the chopped tomatoes (needs that moisture) and add 1 t. cumin & at least 1 t. chili powder.  Also, I might try baking these in the oven (as several other reviewers suggested), because they were very hard to flip in the frying pan (as the filling kept falling out) --- oh yeah, they need LOTS more cheese, to make them cheesy, yummy quesadillas!!  Also, 12 servings???  Are you kidding?  Since you only use 12 tortillas and each one has a bottom & top tortilla, it only makes 6 quesadillas --- so each person only gets a half?  That's not enough for an entree; maybe meant to be 12 servings of an appetizer (?)

I used corn tortillas instead of flour to give the quesadilla a deeper flavor and they turned out awesome!  Also changed up the cheeses by sprinkling mild cheddar on the bottom tortilla before adding the bean mixture, and topping it with white Mexican cheese mix.  Will definitely make these again, yum!

Very good and easy.  Made alot of filling....  I only used one tortilla per quesadilla (folded it in half) and cooked on the griddle with no flipping problems.  Very filling.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These turned out awesome! I made them one night when I felt like Mexican, but didn't want anything too heavy. Made a couple changes: used canned corn instead of frozen, and substituted Rotel for the tomatoes for an extra kick. Also added some ground red pepper, but we tend to like really spicy foods, so I wouldn't recommend that unless you like the same.

This is delicious!  I also added about 1/4 c. fresh cilantro (chopped) and sometimes I add some cooked shredded chicken.  I use large whole grain tortillas, put topping/cheese on half, fold, and and "fry" them in a lvery lightly oiled iron skillet, flipping once.  Excellent with sour cream and salsa!

Very easy to make and change as you like. As usual I doubled the garlic because it's yummy and tossed in some chilil powder and salt to add some flavor. Great & fast. I'll make this again.

Good, but trying to flip the quesadillas was a real pain. Alot of the filling spilled out. Tasted good could use a little more spice.

Good recipe, but could use some cumin and/or red pepper.  Also, our tortillas turned out soggy from all of the oil and the heavy filling.  Next time we will omit the oil or use Pam.

Yummy! The only thing I changed was not adding tomatoes, throwing some cumin in there, and I wrapped it up into two whole-wheat tortillas instead of a quesadilla. I also reduced the amount of onions, but that's just me.

Anyway, it's really good, and I'll probably make it for my family some night.

These were better than any I've had in restaurants. I added some spices to make it a bit hotter, and I baked the quesadillas instead of frying. Quick to make and easy to clean up.

I loved this recipe.  I was really eager to try it but missed some of the ingidients.  Instead of green peppers, I put red ones (it gave it a sweeter kick!) and I didn't have corn - Still,  it turned out super, my family loved it.  I even made them the next day for breakfast, putting eggs instead of the beans.  Yum!

This was great and super easy. I am not a master in the kitchen but I managed this meal just fine. I pretty much followed the recipe but we used whole wheat tortillas and we baked it in the oven at the end (400 degrees for 5 minutes on a cookie sheet). I also splashed in some basil for flavor. We spread a nice fresh pico de gallo on the top of it after it came out of the oven. We halved the ingredients and only got 4 servings instead of 6, which was fine.

This was great! New stapel in our household. I dont follow the recipe exactly, because Im lazy :) I take the beans and cook them with 1/4 cup of tomato paste, a bit of honey, and lots of chili and taco seasoning. Mash slightly to break up the beans and then spread into tortillas and top with some cheese. I bake these in the oven until the tortilla browns a bit. Yum!

These were great- but a little boring. So I cooked the beans separately- added 1/4 cup water, 1/3 cup salsa and 2 teaspoons chili pepper. They turned out great!

These were so good.  I didn't have corn, but will add it next time.  Like other reviewers, I added some taco seasoning and made these in the oven.  I will make these again.

Excellent recipe!  I also took the advice of other posters and popped the quesadillas in the oven instead of frying them.  Highly recommended!

Great lunch. I followed the recipe as is for the most part, except I baked the quesadillas for 10 mins in the oven instead. Also used partly skimmed mozzarella instead of cheddar. I think buying a flavored wrap enhanced the flavor, I used "jalapeño whole wheat". Served them with some salsa and sour cream. I would definitley make these again!

These were great!  I used pico degio because I already had some left over.  The fresh jalepenos in it added a nice heat.  I added cilantro and topped with sour cream and a sliced avacado.  Perfect.  I also didn't cook the filling first; it was a lot quicker and came out just fine.  Even my finace who usually asks "where's the meat?" loved them.  He asked for them again and didn't even ask me to add any beef/chicken :)  This is deff a keeper :)

I love this recipe!  I often use leftovers from tacos to make it.  I also bake it instead of frying.  It saves the fat and calories.

Really delicious! I added shrimp to the mix, and nicked the bell peppers. I also used vintage cheddar directly from the Cheddar Gorge in the UK. Excellent dinner.

Very easy and delicious!  My husband didnt want to try it (said Im not hungry)but I pouted and he tried it.  Needless to say he asked for seconds!!! I decreased the corn (as others suggested) and added salt an pepper. Great idea to mix up and keep in the fridge!!

Nice easy idea, but I think more cheese is required and less corn. Why fry with all that oil? Lightly spray pan with olive oil or pam and it works just fine. Basic recipe lacked zip. I added peppers of different kinds and it helped bring recipe to life. That 1/4 C oil is way too much!

Excellent, easy recipe, and if you watch the amount of oil and use wheat tortillas, this is an incredibly healthy dish! My kids loved it, even the picky ones! I've made it four or five times and it's always a hit.

I made this recipe on a Friday during Lent, when we abstain from meat. My husband and I were both a bit leery of a meatless quesadilla, but I gave it a try and I'm so glad I did! This turned out to be absolutely delicious. My preschooler loved it, too. Instead of sandwiching the filling between two tortillas, I did as other reviewers did and spread the filling over 1/2 a tortilla, then folded it over to make a half circle. After they were cooked, we cut them into triangles, and served with sour cream, salsa, and shredded cheddar cheese. We'll DEFINITELY make this again and recommend it to friends, too.

My family liked them alot, but I wasn't that impressed.  There wasn't enough seasoning in them so I added some cumin, chili powder and cayenne pepper.  I also mashed the bean mixture so that it would stay in the quesadilla better. I also added a lot more cheese too it and that helped out with flavor and holding the tortillas together.

I tried this recipe because of a meal idea posted by Melissa it’s called Easy meatless Mexican night. We loved it, it’s soooooo good. I must confess I did put a bit of chicken in mine; I cooked my chicken breast with a bit of taco seasoning mix. We had with these superb Quesadillas the Spicy Mexican Salad that was in Melissa’s meal idea. What a wonderful supper we had. Thank you Jennifer Orriss for the Superb Quesadillas.

Thanks for the good recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and was pleasantly surprised how great they were.  The flavors all melted together!  My husband and I didn't even need the salsa or sour cream I had ready on the table.  I brushed the tortilla with olive oil and cooked them on a grilled.  It worked great!

I'm giving this four stars because I thought the flavors melded really well together, it was really colorful, and pretty healthy, but next time I will be making some changes as this was somewhat bland.  It would be perfect with some salsa on top or on the side as I thought it was a bit dry.  Also, if you're looking for some kick, I added half a jalepeno (no seeds) and it wasn't anywhere near enough.  Next time I'll keep the seeds in or use the whole thing instead of half.  And it needs more salt - I just put in a pinch.  A sharper cheddar could do the trick as well.

A good meatless recipe, I agree with other reviewers, this needs spices, I added cumin, I skipped chopped tomatoes and used PC arribiata sauce instead to hold the filling together, it is also spicy for extra flavor. Baked at 350 for 15 min. Meat loving husband even liked this. Leftovers for lunch today!

surprisingly good. it needs some spices however. i added a little bit of chili powder and cumin but i didn't add enough and will add more next time.
i will also bake it instead of frying, just because it's healthier.
good recipe though.

This was even yummier than I thought it would be.  Soooo good!  I followed the recipe exactly and we really enjoyed it.  Both my husband and I probably would have liked it a little spicier, but I wanted to give little bites to our 10 month olds (they loved it as well!) so I didn't substitute anything spicy.  I found this recipe just to use up a large can of black beans that I opened yesterday and didn't use much of, and I expected to like it but not love it.  Well, we were pleasantly surprised...this is certainly a recipe where the whole is more than the sum of the parts!  I garnished with additional tomato, green onions, sour cream, and some extra filling.  Quite delicious, thanks!

My family LOVES this recipe. I make it even easier by using Rotel tomatoes which also add some spice. I usually add a combo of beans, black and pintos. Sometimes add refried beans. I assemble the quesadillas and just microwave them to melt the cheese. Very easy and great meal to get some  healthy food into a picky eater.

Really good.  I only fried the first batch. My daughter wanted hers "zapped " in the microwave and not fried.  This was equally good...so I did the rest without the added calories from the frying.  I loved it both ways!  I rolled a few for my husbands lunch the next day even....and they were a hit as well!  Terrific entry!  Fast and simple!

Easy to make and tasted great!  My variations: Used Ro-tel 10 oz canned tomatoes w/chiles (medium heat) and whole grain, whole wheat tortillas.  The tomatoes added just enouh heat, but if you don't want the extra kick you can purhase the mild tomatoes. For another time saver I used the frozen diced onions and green peppers that most grocery stores sell. I also baked as previously suggested.  Both my husband and I loved them.  I will definately make this again and am sharing the recipe with my friends.

If you find this too oily/greasy, try doing it on the grill! it gives a great flavor and a nice crunchiness to the tortillas.   We use red pepper instead of green, omit the corn, mix mozzarella cheese with the cheddar and add green chiles to the mix.  yum!! thanks for a great recipe!

I used canned refried beans, added fresh jalapeno slices, subbed green onions for white and left out the corn.  Baked them in the oven too.  It was fun to eat your own 'creation'!

So easy to make and super tasty. Instead of frying my quesadillas, I baked them in the oven at 400 for about 15 minutes. This is good for adding more veggies to your diet. I made this with some mexican rice and it was great.

Nice alternative to my regular refried bean quesadillas I make. I did not have bell pepper so I threw in some spinach instead. Used whole wheat tortillas, sprinkle of cayenne pepper and cooked on a comal instead of frying. Really Good!!

fantastic! i used a combination of cooked (not canned) black beans and kidney beans, which worked great, and fresh corn, cut from the cob, and added some chicken as well. since i tend to throw extra vegetables into everything, i would say you can safely do that with these, just keep in mind the flavor you're going for and make sure you have enough cheese to adhere them together. i used 8" tortillas, which fit nicely in my 10" pan, and fried them in canola oil, which is high in unsaturated fat and therefore not too unhealthful. served with fat-free sour cream. it made alot, we ate them for days-- but no complaints!! awesome recipe!

I'm always on the lookout for ways to prepare vegetables for my very picky family.  Both my husband and 3-year old boy gobbled these down and asked for more.  Couldn't have been easier to make and allows for inclusion of all different vegetables depending on the season.  This is a winner that I'll make repeatedly!

I did add salt, cumin and my own fajita seasoning mix I make, it was so very good. BUT everything came flying out trying to flip them so I started just putting the goodies on half, and folding them on the skillet  and then flipping with the folded side down and that worked much better!

The recipe is very filling for the quesadillas.  However, the next time, I would just use one tortilla and fold it over instead of trying to put two together.  The filling tends to fall out in that case which is no bueno!  Much better with a folded quesadilla.

I fried these in just a smear of olive oil in a non-stick pan to reduce the fat content.  Otherwise, I followed the directions given.  These are really bland.  I have kept the recipe and made a note to add cumin, chili flakes or powder, and oregano next time.  Also, I will double the amount of cheese.  To keep the filling from falling out while cooking, I recommend sprinkling most of the cheese along the outside rim to seal the two tortillas together.

Lovely fresh recipe.   Gave me the opportunity to use up stuff in my garden.  I try to never change recipes prior to a first make but this one required a few just based on experience.  I put salsa verde in the mixture while it was simmering.  I did this because people mentioned the challenge of flipping the quesadilla (ingredients falling out on flip).  It makes the mixture  stick together and it gives it some seasoning.  You could also use a little water and taco seasoning or regular salsa (as long as it's more liquid than chunky).  I think people are afraid salsa verde will turn their food green and it does not...anyhoo, the only other feedback I have is that there was no seasoning.  I added a bit of salt and pepper, a small jalapeño (had it in the garden - otherwise wouldn't have) and of course the salsa verde.  The key to quesadillas when flipping is be patient.  I use low heat, let it sit, check regularly.  Good luck!

The filling was very good but there was too much of it. Besides that my family enjoyed it tho it was difficult to flip in the pan. next time i make it I will probably just make the filling and add meat.

We enjoyed these very much! I added chicken, and it was very good. I think I might try the baking method as another reviewer suggested. When I flip them some filling falls out and the cheese burns in the pan. Oops. Still delicious though. A great, easy meal for any day!

Very tasty!  After reading numerous reviews, I made the following changes:  while sautéing onions and garlic I added 1 tsp. Chili powder and cumin, 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. Chili flakes, 1/2 tsp. salt and pepper.  I then added chopped pepper and sautéed a few minutes before adding other ingredients.   My personal preference there wasn't enough cheese.  I used 2 1/2 cups of shredded cheddar and placed a bit on the tortilla before the vegetable mixture then added the rest on top.  Lightly brushed with olive oil and baked at 400 for 15 minutes on baking sheets.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was good.  My husband liked it better than I did, but I enjoyed it too.  Left out the green pepper.  I think it needs a little something, chopped chilies maybe.  I put taco sauce on mine and you need to  use a lot of cheese.

Quick and delicious supper. I only gave it four stars since it desperately needs spices. I used salt, pepper, cumin, and chili powder, and that combo worked well. I doubled the recipe, and, like others, I used one can black beans and one can of refried beans. Great move - the paste helps hold everything together. This will be joining our supper rotation.

I can't get enough of these. I made them as directed, substituting olive oil for the vegetable oil. Also cooked then on my panini press and topped with salsa when done. Will be keeping the mixture in the fridge for any time I feel like throwing one together for a quick meal.

I made these last night for dinner with this sites Mexican Rice II recipe. I used wheat tortillas instead of white, fresh beans instead of canned, and baked them in the oven instead of in the skillet. The flavor was really good, and with some cooking spray on the baking sheet, they still came out nice and crisp.

My only complaint was in trying to flip the quesadillas. They were challenging to flip without loosing some of the filling. I don't think this would have been improved by skillet-cooking.

Whole family liked them.

I like it, but I had to make some changes. I added cilantro, cumin, chili powder, and lime juice. I don't know why people have a hard time flipping these over. I just put some cheese down first then the veggies and more cheese. When the cheese melts at the bottom the veggies stick to it. Hardly anything comes out. I also put the tomatoes on a paper towel to get rid of the juice. It reminds me of the black bean burritos I make.

These were amazing! Even my toddler devoured them, which is a rarity to be eating the same dinner as her. The only tweak I made was just adding extras spice and throwing in extra veggies I had around that needed to be used.

I agree with other readers that it is a little bland as it stands BUT it is so versatile so do what you want. Kids love it and it is filling. I put it on a griddle pan but like to see that some have put it in the oven. I think I'd like it that way, too.

I can't think of another meal I've made without meat, so this was a risk, especially for my boyfriend...and we loved it! Followed the recipe exactly and was yummy. We had some leftovers and I was so excited to re-heat it the next day. It's been a week and we're having it again.

This was great! I found the veggie mixture a little bland, so added 1 tbsp chili powder and 1 tsp ground cumin. I covered half of the tortillas with filling, topped with cheese and cilantro, then folded them in half and broiled them for a few minutes per side, without olive oil. I served them with sour cream, guacamole and salsa. They received rave reviews from adults and kids alike! An easy, tasty, satisfying and nutritious vegetarian weeknight meal. Thanks for a keeper!

These were easy, easy, easy. Instead of frying in oil, I heated on a nonstick skillet until the cheese was melted and tortillas were crisp. I served mine with salsa.

My husband and I really liked the versatile mixture. We are going to try the leftovers in breakfast burritos tomorrow morning. I also baked the quesadilla's in the oven and they came out perfect. Super quick and easy for the nights your just not in the mood to be in the kitchen for a long time. Will defiantly be making this one again...LOVED IT!

I think this is a great recipe.   It is missing a little something, so i added some taco seasoning.  i did use canned tomatoes, drained.  I also used monterey jack.  Instead of making into quesadillas i put the mixture into the flour tortillas, topped with the mj cheese and rolled into enchilada/burrito style.  put in a 9x13 pan and topped with both mj and ch cheese.  baked at 350 for 30 minutes or until warm.  Yum!

These are good with the addition of chili powder and cumin.  Without I think they would be lacking in flavor.  Also for the tomatoes, I added a 15 oz can of diced tomatoes with green chili's.  Didn't fry them--seemed like an unnecessary step since the tortilla crisp nicely in a 400 oven when brushed lightly with some olive oil.

Very delicious!  My husband even ate them, who doesn't care for quesadillas.  Note:  don't make the veggies in the same pan as the quesadillas, unless you clean it first.

Easy and everyone ate it. I didn't have any green peppers or tomatoes but threw in a little salsa instead. I put a little cheese on the bottom, then some of the bean mixture and then some more cheese to seal it; hence less spillage when flipping. Baked 350 on non-stick cookie sheet for 10 min, flipped and then baked for 5min more.

Overall this was a HUGE hit with my party. Everyone loved it and it was great for even my vegetarian friends. It was cheap to feed a large amount of people and it was so delicious! =) I coated the outsides of each tortilla with vegetable oil and baked it at 400 deg. for 3-6 minutes.  This recipe is a great base that you can make so many variations with. I omitted the green pepper and added re-fried beans and salsa. The salsa adds flavor and spice and the re-fried beans makes a nice creamy spread without crushing the black beans.

I thought this was really good.  I followed the ingredients except for the cheddar. I substituted a bag of Mexican cheese because that's what I had on hand.  I also baked them in the oven at 350 for 8 or 9 minutes, flipping them halfway because they were curling.  Next time I think I'll get my big electric griddle out and cook them with some olive oil.  I was skeptical at first because I don't normally like black beans, but this surprised me. My husband liked it, and he's usually a big meat eater. He said it reminded him of Southwest Eggrolls.  All we needed was some avocado ranch dip.  We both agreed that it needed some seasoning, maybe taco seasoning.  I'll definitely be fixing this one again.  It's pretty cheap meal too!

I think this recipe is just great and the quesadillas were totally yummmmm. I added some salt and 2 tsps of "Mexican seasoning" from my supermarket which gave it a lovely lovely flavour.  Highly recommended.  Thanks for sharing!

This is quite a meaty meatless quesadilla! Overall, the 'dillas were good--the filling was hearty and tasty athough a bit bland. I sprinkled cumin, salt, pepper, and chili powder over the veggies while I was sauteeing, but still on the bland side. The flavor kind of reminded me of an omelette. I served with heaps of gaucamole on top of the quesadillas, which gave them a nice flavor. This dish would benefit from salsa and sour cream as garnishes as well.

I really enjoyed these.  For my tastes, it did not need any extra flavor or spice.  The vegetables and cheese were very flavorful.  My two year old also enjoyed them and he does not like anything right now!  Easy to make, ingredients on hand, and followed recipe as written.  Oh, the one thing I found a little helpful was when I was frying the tortilla with the veggies and cheese, I did  not put the second tortilla on top.  Then when it was time to flip it over, I picked the tortilla with veggies up with a spatula, placed the second tortilla in the pan and then put the first tortilla on top.  I found that I lost less veggies and it was less cumbersome than trying to flip the whole quesadilla over.

this was a good recipe.  i didn't follow the measurements exactly...i just eyeballed it for the most part.  i added a touch of cumin, and did not have any corn. 

turned out quite good.

It was a good recipe, but a little bland.  Next time, we need to add seasoning to it to give it some flavor.  Otherwise, it was a great recipe.  Needs some tweaking.

So good my husband forgot he was eating veggies. He said it tasted just like the ones we get at his favorite restaurant. 
I found the filling did not come even close to making 12 quesadillas. I was only able to make four. But I made them with a whole tortilla on top and bottom instead of folded in half. 
Next time I will make it with a little more cheese to help hold it together better; a pepper jack would be good. I'd also add some chopped green chilies or jalapenos (we like our food spicy.) We dipped in salsa and zesty ranch sauce (Old El Paso makes a great one). My  21 month old liked them too.

These are great!  1 recipe made 5 quesadillas, using the 8" tortillas for me, I guess I like them stuffed a little more.  Very easy and my husband loves the corn in them.  I brush them with olive oil and bake on our stone in oven on 425 for about 7 minutes and they turn out crispy and good!

i loved this recipe but my kids and husband ask me not to make again. i added shredded chicken and red pepper.  i also baked quesadillas instead of frying as suggested from other reviews.  i will not be making again because family did not like.

Awesome recipe!! The only change I made was we put LOTS of cheese on them and added chicken.  Perfect and delicious recipe.  My husband also LOVED it!  What a fun Saturday night recipe while watching movies at home.  Thanks for passing the recipe on!

I made just as written (minus one tomato and green peppers for kid sake) and they were consumed and enjoyed by all.  A great new lunch option. I can see why adults may want a little more "spice" to this, but still good.

I used a panani press instead of in the frying pan with all that oil.  I sprayed both sides with olive oil spray, so it wasn't as fatty.  We thought it tasted yummy!  Also to the bean mixture I added 1 tsp of crushed red pepper, some salt and pepper.  It tasted a little plain without those.

I think this is a good recipe. But i thought it was a little bit bland, so i added chilli powder, salt, a little pepper. Also i love sweet corn so i put much more in it. i also chopped portobello mushrooms and sauted them with th eonions and garlic. i added more tomatoes for the juicyness. i added a little bit of lemon as well. when it came time to fry them, i added lots of shredded mozarella and cheddar cheese. and i added and put a good amount of crumbled feta cheese as well.  this was a good dish-  i just tweaked it for my own tasting. i should make guacamole- i think this would go good with it. my husband loved it and so did i. i have been eating it for the past two days!

These were so yummy!!  I assembled them and then cooked them on the BBQ for a few minutes on each side.  I can't stop eating the leftovers.  The only change I made was to use fresh corn instead of frozen.  So good!!  I'll make them again for sure.

Good and easy to make, but it needs some seasoning.  I added salt but would also suggest adding a little taco seasoning or red pepper flakes.

Great recipe.  I was looking for something other than putting cheese and salsa inside a tortilla.  Very flavorful and filling.  I added chicken, but I think it would be just as yummy without it!

My foods and nutrition students loved this!  I have since made it for lunch several times.  It's quick and easy to put together.  I would recommend using much less oil in order to fry the quesadillas.

I made this according to the recipe except that I microwaved the filled quesadillas for 15 sec, flipped, 15 sec.  I think that was not enough!  Next time I will brown in the oven for 10 mins as other reviewers did.  The problem was that the inside was too runny so you couldn't pick them up like regular  quesadillas.  I'll try again with the leftover filling tonight and this time I'll bake instead of taking the shortcut!

Fantastic recipe!!! My grandmother is Catholic, so we don't eat red meat on friday. I cooked this quesadilla recipe for her, and she LOVED it!!! I added spinach and mushrooms, with more garlic for an extra kick. Great paired with authentic spanish rice! Kudos!

These were awesome! I did change them up a bit though.  I substituted red bell pepper for the green, mozzarella for the cheddar, omitted the corn, and added mushrooms and a little cumin.  I had leftover meat mixture from the chicken cottage cheese enchilada recipe from this site, so I threw that in also.

My husband and I agreed they didn't have much taste. I even added some fresh cilantro in there to help. Probably won't make these again.

Surprisingly great!  I was a little worried about how these would turn out, but they exceeded my expectations!  We even ate them again the next day.  I baked them in the oven, and then microwaved them. I also left out the green pepper.  Kids thought they were the best "tacos" ever. :)

i just made this for my bf and he raved about them--really good alternative to the simple cheese quesadilla...i used reduced fat cheese and made fresh salsa to accompany it on the side.  Delicious!

This was delicious!  My family absolutely loved this and I will be making this again and again!  Next time, I will try it in the oven as others have suggested to cut down the fat content.  Thank you so much for sharing Jennifer!

I made this for dinner last night and it was great.  Even my 17 month old daughter liked it (without the corn)and she is extremely picky.  I need to work on flipping the quesadillas though because I had big mess on the stove when I was finished.

Absolutely loved this recipe.  I made 2 large quesadillas with all the stuffings and my husband, 3 year old and I only finished 1/2 of 1 of them.  Lots of leftovers.  It was surprisingly filling.  Thanks for the great ideas.  The vegetables were delicious.

This is SUCH a good idea! Who would have put these two together!? We make it ALL the timenow, my husband LOVES these, its a meal too! Like a bean burrito and a cheese quesadilla. SO SO SO good, definitely try this one. I did it a little different, mainly using the idea, i just make a quesadilla cheese and smear refried beans in it. Fry it in a little butter on the skillet and put sour cream and salt and pepper all over it. Thats how we do it, its yummy!

This was really great, my kids liked it to. I changed the tomatoes to 1/4 cup of spaghetti sauce just because that is what I had on hand and we used butter for the frying of the tortillas rather than vegetable oil. I also did not use the bell pepper, didn't have one...will try it next time with the pepper.  This is a keeper...Thanks for the recipe!
