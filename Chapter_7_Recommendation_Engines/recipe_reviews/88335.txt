I made this for appetizers at Thanksgiving, and served with butter crackers. It was a hit! I even mixed some with a little cream cheese and sour cream as a sort of cheese ball and it's great that way too!

Excellent.  It's a great combo of sweet and spicy.  I used different kinds of peppers and put in only a little bit of ground ginger.  It is still delicious after almost a week in the fridge.  Later note - this salsa won 3rd place in a salsa competition last night!

I don't think this recipe is going to please everybody, but we liked it. Admittedly, a tomatillo-based salsa is our absolute favorite, but this was good for a change. I used a very green Granny Smith apple. The flavors worked well. Thanks!

I didn't use the fresh peppers - instead I used about 1/2 tsp of Cheyenne pepper.  You really need to let this salsa sit for about 2 hours for the mixture to blend properly.  Also - one can reduce the amount of onion.  It went well with a grilled chiken kabobs that were seasoned with salt and pepper.  This really added the flavor to the meal.  I agree with a previous reviewer - its not for everyone, but I really enjoyed the unique combinations of flavors.

I just made this salsa and I think it is absolutely fabulous. The sweetness in the apples contrasting with the hot peppers is an amazing sensation! The fresh ginger definitely gives this salsa a different twist. I had a couple of tomatoes which I diced up as well to add color and I used 4 chili peppers instead of the 2 suggested. Delightful!

Wow, 5 stars for taste, originality, and especially =YUM= the use of cilantro!

I've had all kinds of mango or pineapple salsas before, but this was a first.   :o)

Best ever.  I was hesitant about this because I wasn't sure if it was going to be good, but it was amazing, and a perfect side to serve to guests with dinner.  I loved the range of flavours.  I used red onion because you didn't specify.  This is going to be a favorite.  Thanks for sharing!

Very tasty.  If I make it again I'll decrease the amount of ginger-- probably halve it.  And I felt that a splash of agave nectar (maybe because my apples were very tart) was a nice addition.

excellent! so different and unique. Although, i did not use 2 apples, I used just 1 and kept all other quantities the same. Goes great with tostitos scoops.

I loved it. Next time I think I might try to make it a little spicier.

Holy !!! A delightful contrast of heat with the tartness of apple....(and I mean heat!!!) I had to use dry cilantro (not to my desire) but it worked out just as well. For my friends who love all varieties of salsa, this was a hit!!

What an amazing flavor combo salsa, totally outside the box of your ordinary salsas. Thank you so much for this recipe. I was making the roasted cauliflower soup from this site and thought what about a special grilled cheese sandwich to go with it. I typed in apple & onion and presto this popped up. I reviewed all the ingredients, PERFECT... I was off and ready to rock and roll. When testing it all the flavor high notes I was looking for. I used a sprouted bread with a goat cheese. Totally amazing. My only ingredients difference was hubs had some fresh pickled onions that I used vs. raw onion. I forgot the salt which was ok by me since the cheese and bread supplied enough and when eating it by the spoonful I didnâ€™t miss it at all. Thank you again for such a great recipe.

I subbed green onions and pecans instead of walnuts. Fantastic with tacos and fish.

So delicious!  We used two jalapenos and omitted the Anaheim chile, and also left out the walnuts, and served with barbecued pork chops.  I can't wait to make it for guests.
