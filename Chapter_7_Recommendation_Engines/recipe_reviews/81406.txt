I love pepperoni and eggs, but never thought to combine the two. This was great! I just placed the filling in tortillas instead of the sub roll.

I combined this recipe with another one. 

I had some leftover garlic spread from the Garlic Bread Fanastique that I wanted to use up. I spread that on some 
wheat bread and cooked it in the oven to brown the bread. I also had some excess
pepperoni from a really great sale at Grocery Outlet that I wanted to use. I subbed a mozzerella/provolone blend for the American cheese called for. I only used two eggs and omitted the salt and garlic, as the bread had enough. I also added Frank's Hot Sauce, as I like my food to jump in my mouth.

Really good sandwich for a mom who
not only needed something quick but also
wanted to use ingredients on hand. 

Nommy!

Absolutely delicious. I made this for a ravenous just-home-from-work Husband, and he wolfed one down in no time. It would be great with bacon too. Thanks!

many sub shops serve this
it is great
also as a breakfast just on a plate is great
also try regular salami chunked up in place of the pepperoni
i have done this both ways for about 45yrs

Yes, it's bad for you, but it's a good alternative to when you're out of bacon or just want something different. If you want a bacon-y taste..crisp up the pepperoni in toaster oven or pan..

Absolutely delicious! I had a package of big, round pepperoni slices, so I used them whole on a toasted hamburger bun instead of a roll. I fried 2 slices of pepperoni and sprinkled garlic powder on them,( just a little), instead of the clove, while they were frying. I will deffinately be having this again!

I used garlic and herb sub buns. I did toast them in the pan before frying the pepperoni and eggs. I used medium cheddar cheese instead of American. I thought this sandwich was all right, but felt it was missing something..

This is a very good recipe, though not great, but different.  It is great to experiment with, especially the type of cheese you use and would work good with fried red peppers.  Will make again just with minor changes.

Yummy!!! I will be making this often. I love pepperoni and garlic and to mix with eggs, so tasty. I didn't have sub buns so I put between bread and grilled it like a grilled cheese. Again, Yummy!!!

Heart attack on a roll! I could feel my arteries clogging as I ate it but it was so worth it. This sandwich is so so good. I would eat these every day if I knew that wouldn't kill me.

This was oddly good! I don't know how often I would make or want to eat this, but it was good for something different. My little guy, on the other hand, could not get enough of it and he usually doesn't even like scrambled eggs, but LOVES pepperoni, so that's a winner in my book! Thanks for sharing. :)

Was okay, but the pepperoni made it too greasy, and I didn't even use as much as the recipe said. REALLY good with sliced fresh garlic, though!

Pretty yummy sandwich (don't eat if on a diet!) I toasted the bun in toaster and cut butter down to 1 T. 12 slices of pepperoni seemed like a lot so I only used 6 slices of pepperoni and cut them in half and that was definitely plenty.

Like FOODGU1, I love pepperoni and eggs as well, but never thought about combining them. This was delicious. So quick and simple, this recipe is a keeper.

Absolutely Delicious. I love the garlic and pepproni mixture. I added green peppers, tomatoes and oninos to make  a heartier sandwich. I could have used just two scrambled eggs because the sub bread  was brimming over with ingredients. I definitely making this one again!

This was yummy. I never had pepperoni and egg before. I added garic powder to the bread instead of the eggs.

I do a similar recipe, but I use whatever I have on hand. That usually ends up being sandwich bread,eggs, butter, American cheese, bacon, or a slice of deli salami. Tastes great, and a very fast meal!
