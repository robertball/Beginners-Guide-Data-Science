While I modified the recipe a bit (used pepperoni instead of ham and canned beans instead of dry) this is the best Pasta e Fagioli I've ever made.  I have a salon in an older Italian neighborhood.  Many tried it and the oohs and ahhs were unbelievable.  Several asked for the receipe... what a compliment!

I used pancetta because I had some on hand (I started it in w/ the celery, carrot & onion)...I also added about a lb. of ground round (cooked, of course). I used a can of cannellini & also a can of red kidney beans. I used half chicken broth & half beef broth as I didn't want too "beefy" a taste & I probably had to increase the liquids by double since I added additional ingredents. I did simmer the rind from the parmesan cheese in the soup...thanks for the tip! I went w/ macaroni instead of seashell pasta (Gosh I made a lot of changes...sorry) & I separated enough soup to have for dinner & then added about half a cup of pasta to it. The rest I froze & will add the pasta when I cook it. That way my macaroni doesn't turn to mush. Served it w/ garlic breadsticks & a ceasar salad. Thansk Marian!

This was soooooo good!  My husband and I loved it!  Easy to make, cheap, and delicious!  The ultimate comfort food.
I did use canned beans, and I used half chicken stock/ half beef stock.  Other than that, I made it just as called for.  Wonderful!

this recipe is amazing. its the closest thing ive ever got to the smell in my grandmas kitchen. The second time i did use more stock, because the first time it had more the consistency of chili and i wanted it a little soupier, I used half chicken and half beef stock! awesome soup!

I added ground beef, forgot the salt and added a few crushed red pepper flakes, then added a touch of salt. This made the soup a sweet, hardy, delicious soup. I also cut the ham chunks small after reading one review that the ham was tough. I learned in culinary school that it is important to keep the vegatables and meats cut uniformly, so that they will cook uniformly. My wife and I went back for thirds, my 14 years old seconds.

Delicious!!!   A great and filling recipe.  Added 1 can of kidney beans and 1 can of garbanzo beans.  My family loved it and we will make it again.  One word of caution, it will thicken up, so if you want it more "soupy" add extra broth.

Absolutely wonderful! Followed reciped except used dried thyme and a little Italian seasoning too, plus doubled the garlic.  I also added red pepper flake as the soup we had at our favorite restaurant had it and it was delish.  So glad I tried this- going into our growing soup rotation!

Impressive, quick, and easy.  I used the ham luncheon meat only because my wife isn't much of a ham fan and it wouldn't make sense to buy anything larger than that.  This dish is great when garnished with 2/3 parts grated parmesian and 1/3 part grated romano.  Maybe next time I'll add some ground beef to it to give it more texture.

I'm not sure what pasta e fagioli is supposed to taske like since I've never had it before, but this was excellent! My husband wasn't thrilled when I said we were having soup for dinner, but he thought it was very good. I will most definately make this again.

This soup was suprisingly good. I was looking to make a vegetable pasta soup, and I used the recipe ingredients and added a couple of other things. I added some peas, a zucchini, doubled the beans (which I used from a can), doubled the garlic, carrots, and celery, substituted rice pasta shells instead of regular pasta and used 1/2 chicken stock and 1/2 beef stock instead of all beef stock. It was really flavorful, and incredibly easy and quick to make with the canned beans. My husband loved it, and you can make a lot and have leftovers. This is a real keeper in my house.

I personally leave out the ham & use chicken broth. I do not bother with the food processing, as some the beans will discinergrate thickening up the broth. Top it with fresh grated cheese. YUM!

I was in the mood for Pasta e Fagioli tonight, so I came home and made this and was very pleased.  I didn't use dried beans, since I didn't have time to soak any, so I used a 16 oz. can of white beans, which turned out to be exactly right, and I didn't have fresh thyme, so I used a teaspoon of crushed dried.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as written, and it was exactly the thickness and texture I was looking for. I also threw in some zucchini at the end with the pasta, as I had some that needed to be used up, and I think it would also be great with some spinach thrown in at the end.  It'll probably be even better tomorrow.  Next time I may try topping it with some pesto too!

This is a delicious way to use leftover ham. I used 2 C chicken stock and 2 C beef stock instead of all beef stock. My only issue was with soaking the beans. I have never cooked with dried bean so I wasn't sure about the appropriate amount of time. Eight hours soaking was enough, next time I will try overnight or I will used canned beans. Otherwise, I loved this soup. I will make again.

This soup turned out very well.  I didn't measure the ingredients exactly but it turned out great.  The only downside was the ham cubes got a little tough from simmering but it was still good.

Very good soup.  I used canned great northern beans for this recipe and used Gemilli pasta.  It went over very well at our soup supper at church.

This was the perfect soup for my leftover Easter ham.  I used half chicken broth, half beef stock.  I had some chicken broth already in the fridge that I needed to use.  And I used pinto beans.  Didn't smash any of them, just left them whole.  And if I had a zucchini on hand I would have chopped that up and thrown that in too!  Sprinkled a little parmesan on top when I served.  Hubs sprinkled some red pepper on top  of his.  Loved this soup!

Delicious! Used a 16 oz can of cannellini beans (rinsed) instead of dried, 1t dried vs fresh thyme, and (2) 14oz cans of diced tomatoes vs crushed. Skipped the part about pureeing the beans.  After simmering a while the soup seemed a little thick, so I ended up adding 1 more cup of beef broth.  Turned out great!  Quick, delicious, satisfying meal for a cold winter night.  Even my 6 year old who was initially put off by the sight of all the tomatoes asked for more.  Will be making again!

I made the recipe as written except I swapped out the ham, as I'm not a fan, with ground beef in the same ratio.  Quite tasty! Will definitely make again.

The flavors in the soup blended well.  I would have liked more texture.  Once the pasta & beans cooked down, it had the same feel in my mouth.

This was a hit with my Italian family. The only changes I made were that I used canned beans, not dry; I used pancetta for the ham; and I used ditali pasta. A great recipe! I'll be making this again.

I made this almost exact to the recipe. I was out of a couple of things so I got creative with the herbs. I was out of celery so I ground up celery seed and a little fennel seed sprinkling it in. This recipe reminded me soooo much like my grandmother's pasta fagioli that I grew up with. I did like using sausage instead of bacon or panceta. Next time, I'll try it with beef stock instead of chicken. Talk about a wonderful Italian comfort food... If you've never experienced pasta fagioli, try it! :)

This was delicious. I used canned beans, but otherwise made it per the recipe. My husband loved it, too.

The soup had great flavor.  I found that the pasta made the soup very thick.  So I would either make the pasta and add it to each bowl of soup separately or make sure I had extra broth when reheating soup.

This is now my go to soup, it's soooooo delicious!  I do what some others suggested and add more beef/chicken stock, for a more "soup" consistency.  I also use whatever beans I have on hand, usually soy beans.

If you've never done a soup before, start with this one!

This was fine. A little bland with ham and I think I will use Italian sausage and more red pepper flakes next time along with fennel seeds.

This was great! I added red kidney beans, more garlic and did 1/2 beef and 1/2 chic broth. I will definitely make this again.

I was skeptical to try this at first but now I have to say this was delicious. However I added too much pasta so I needed to add more broth. I used one container of beef stock and the rest I used bouillon cubes and water. I didn't have fresh thyme so I just used the dry kind  and this still tasted really good.  I definitely will be making this again!

Great recipe! I agree with others that say it needs more stock or crushed tomatoes. Turned very thick and more of a chilli than a soup.

This was REALLY good...I used leeks instead of onion, and bok choy instead of the celery but just bc that's what I had on hand.  Despite an unfortunate incident while cooking (I taught myself how NOT to use a pressure cooker lol)what was left of the soup was very flavorful and definitely something I will make again!
