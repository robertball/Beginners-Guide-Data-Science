This recipe was easy to prepare and tasted fine. However, my loaf was swimming in fat when done. It was way too greasy, so I will DEFINITELY leave out the butter if I make this recipe again!

Recipe was good.  I did leave out the butter, tomato and lemon zest.  I also used ground beef instead of lamb.  The best way to prepare this is on the grill.  Shape the meat into sausages and grill. MMMMM!  We serve with a garlic sauce, hummus and pita.

I added paprika and LOVED it! Also loved the lemon zest - I made this on a cookie sheet rolled into meatballs and flattened.  I agree with other posters, lots of excess fat in the runoff (also why I liked the cookie sheet - drained the excess liquid) so I'll leave out the butter next time, but will definitely make again.

I think the amount of allspice was a bit too overpowering and would suggest adding about 1/8 tsp instead. I omitted the parsley as I am not a big parsley fan, but think it would be fine with it included. The onion would be better sauteed first so it would not be crunchy in the final baked dish. Also as for the grease another reviewer mentioned, just remove the meat from the pan and set on a cooling rack to cool and to drain any grease. I would make again with the above modifications and maybe add some bread crumbs to keep the meat from being so dense.

I like how simple it was to make!  I would omit the butter but other than that I love it!  Set the meat loaf on a cooling rack with paper towels under it and it was perfect.  

I like my food spicy so the next time I make it I will add some hot peppers.

Thanks for sharing this recipe on line for all of us to try.

I've cooked this kefta recipe many times with great success! Like other cooks, I do omit the butter, but everything else should remain the same.  It's terrific grilled too. My husband and I think it is better than restaurant kefta. Thank you so much for sharing your delicious recipe.
