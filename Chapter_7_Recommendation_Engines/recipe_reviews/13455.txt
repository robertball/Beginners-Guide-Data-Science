Delicious! The best scalloped corn I've ever made. I used 2 cans of creamed corn and 1 can of whole corn. I made this for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it!  I used crushed Ritz crackers instead of saltines and it had a more flavorful taste plus added 1/4 cup of finely chopped red onions which added more flavor too. I also added 1/4 cup parmesan cheese to the cracker crumb mixture for the topping. I will make this over and over again! Thanks for the great recipe.

I made this for Christmas dinner, and everyone liked it very much.  I made it with 2 cans of cream corn, and 1 can of whole corn, and I added a pinch of sugar.  I think maybe next time I might try 2 whole, and 1 can of cream corn.  Thanks for a good recipe!

Comfort food night(or also known as broke-as-heck and using what's in the cupboards). I cut this back by half. Instead of using half a can of creamed corn, I used two full cans. I threw in some Frank's Hot Sauce into the creamed corn mixture. I used Ritz crackers because that was what I had on hand. I tossed a couple tablespoons of Kraft parmesan cheese (in the green canister) in with the cracker mixture before I sprinkled it over the creamed corn. My boys LOVED this--my oldest boy had two big helpings and asked for a third but my husband had already finished it off. NO leftovers.

This is an old, family recipe.  I have been eating this for Thanksgiving since I was a baby!  While it is not fancy or in any way wow-inducing compared to some of the recipes on this site, it is my idea of comfort food.  It is a lovely side for a meal, easy to prepare, and just about everyone likes it.  what more do you want?  Tradition at its finest!

I have always made scalloped corn very similar to this recipe,  but adding the paprika, butter and crackers to make a crumb topping really made an improvement. Everyone I served it to at our Thanksgiving gathering really loved it.   I did add diced onions to the corn mixture,  my family loves them in their scalloped corn,  but otherwise I followed the recipe to a tee and it came out wonderful!  Thanks for the recipe Cali!

It's not much different than opening three cans of creamed corn and putting it in a pot on the stove and heating it up, and it's not worth the extra effort.

I added a can of diced green chilies and a smidgen of cayenne. For the cracker topping I added some Parmesan cheese - it was really good, will be making this again.

This is basically my favorite scalloped corn recipe.   Mine came from BH&G)  I use 1 can of creamed corn, 1 egg, and 1 cup of milk, 1 cup of crushed saltines (22 crackers) reserving 1/c to mix with 1 tblspoon of butter for topping.  I also add some instant minced onion (my recipe calls for 1/4 cup of finely chopped onion) instead of fresh onion as fresh onion doesn't seem to get done.  I don't usually use paprika.  May try this version with extra corn and no milk next time.

I used 2 cans creamed corn and 1 can regular corn.  I made it on Thanksgiving.  I'm not sure that it could hold it's own as an everyday side dish, it's rather bland. But with the combination of all the other sides that we served that day, it was a fine addition.

My mom always made something similar.  She substituted frozen buttery corn, for one of the cans of cream corn.  It cut out adding the butter.  We never used eggs though.  Maybe someone could tell me what the egg is for?

The recipe was easy to make, but tasted like plain corn .... kinda bland. I even read the reviews and added bread crumbs  and some grated parmesan cheese on top. If i try it again i will add some spices of some kind,to give it some flavor. I'll stick with baked corn for now. Thanks.
