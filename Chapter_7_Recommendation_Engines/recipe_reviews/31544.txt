This recipe has great flavor - the chili sauce really perks it up. Sadly, though, it was a bit too dry. I also enjoy the various beans, each having a different consistancy, even the lima beans were good (and I don't eat limas). Overall, it was a good change from the usual baked bean recipes.  A great way to add legume nutrition to the dinner table.

I use this recipe all the time when I want a quick side dish. To speed things up I put it in the microwave until nice and hot then put in the oven. Cuts the baking time in 1/2. I don't use as much chili sauce as it says and I still get a nice spicy baked bean dish. Last time I added some ham and a little liquid smoke. YUM!

I love this recipe.  Not only is it quick & easy, but the chili sauce gives the beans a great taste.  They are not to spicy nor are they too sweet.  Just perfect.  One thing I do differently, is I dice the bacon & fry it first, then mix it into the beans.  Excellent!

I have served this dish repeatedly at cattle events and have gotten rave reviews! These are what beans are meant to be.

I am personally not too fond of baked beans but I decided to make these anyway.  They turned out okay for me but my husband and kids loved them.  There weren't any left overs at all.  Any time I make something with beans in it and the kids and hubby eat it all, it gets five stars from me.  It was very simple to make and will definitely make again soon.  Thanks

At first, I was going to give it a 4 because I baked mine for less time than the recipe says, but it came out dry.  I added liquid (water) and stirred it.  The taste, however, is delicious and deserves a 5.  I've made this kind of beans many times and have never thought to add chili sauce.  Knowing to bake for less time than it says, though, is really a plus so I'm rating it a 5!

These are a wonderful alternative to the usual baked beans. I use Thai chili sauce and cut it
to six ounces.  Mine are quit spicey and my guests love them. I also dice the bacon, but I don't fry it first as some do. Be sure to drain the beans completely, or they will be too moist.

Great baked beans recipe. No need to buy the canned stuff anymore! I substituted maple syrup for the molasses and added an extra spoon of brown sugar. I also omitted the bacon. Still yummy!

I drained all of the beans, but after cooking 1 hr @ 325 degrees F, they were still way too soupy.  I bumped up the temperature to 350 and cooked for another 20 minutes, and then browned up the bacon a little for a couple minutes under the broiler.  The consistency still is pretty "liquid-y" but that's fine for us, since we like our baked beans cold better than hot.  Next time, I would add some minced onion and cook at 350 rather than 325.  I really do like the chili sauce tang as well as the combination of beans.   I have a number of baked bean recipes that we enjoy, and this one will be added to the collection.  Thanks, SHARONHOWARD, for sharing your recipe.

This is now my standard and oft-requested bake bean recipe. I tend to play with it a bit. I rarely keep chili sauce in the house so I use ketchup and a spoonful of relish instead. I usually add some BBQ sauce if I have some, as well as some minced onion. The bacon is what makes it really great. I usually cook some ahead of time which I crumble and toss in. Oh and I always make this in the crockpot!

This is great and looks very unique when baked.  I added turkey bacon instead of pork bacon and maple syrup (real maple syrup, Grade B) instead of molasses.  I'll make this again.

Didn't love this recipe.  The mixture of beans was quite interesting and good...but the flavor of the sauce seemed to be lacking.

I thought these were good, but will probably be even better the next day. I didn't drain all of the beans and had no problems with them being dry. I didn't have much time, so I took the advice from a previous posting and microwaved the beans until warm and then put in the oven for a half hour. Also used Real Bacon Bits instead of bacon. All in all, a great recipe.

Good recipe to try - depending on your tastes.  The chili sauce made these a bit too "zingy" for us.

I liked this recipe, but will stick to my regular baked beans.  It's probably a regional thing, but the taste wasn't right for this midwesterner's idea of baked beans.  Worth a try though.

Like the others I added a little more brown sugar, and I found that I had no molasses, so I substituted maple syrup instead.  My husband loved it.  Will amke it again for sure

Very good recipe. I like the different types of beans. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out very nice. I drained the beans and the dish was not too dry at all.  Next time I will preheat in the microwave and dice the bacon.  Thanks for submitting Sharon!

I was looking for a good bean dish that was easy to make to serve as a side dish for a party with sloppy joes, potato salad, chips, etc. This turned out good. I liked it so much I had 4 servings. I left out the bacon just because I don't like the added fat, but I am sure it would be good with it too. Next time I may dice some onions and toss them in. Yummy!

These were good but came out dry and the beans were a little firm.  The recipe might need some playing with depending on the brands you use, ect.

This is a awesome recipe. Never had anyone say a bad word about it and I never have any left over. To give it a nice little smoke flavor add a couple drops of liquid smoke.

I didn't drain the beans. I used one large cans of baked beans I had.I think I might use less liquid next time.Too runny for me. I loved this recipe ! I think the chili sauce really made the difference ! I'll keep bottles of it on hand now! I also doubled the brown sugar. Excellent recipe!!

I made this for my son's school open house barbeque/picnic. There were lots of bean dishes there, but mine didn't look as pretty or as appetizing as most of the others. Taste-wise it was OK, but that's it. I won't make it again.

Very good--however, the bacon didn't get crispy for me.  I would cook it before adding it to the top of the beans.

This was great; although I made a few substitution. We didn't have any molasses, so I used a little less of honey and Erythrilnol brown sugar.  I love brown beans but I am a type 2  diabetic. The dish turned out well. I'll have to use a little less of the substitute sugar next time.

Made no changes and this will be a go-to for years to come.  It couldn't be easier and was a total hit with the dozen people at our July 4th picnic.  Even my vegetarian husband lifted off the bacon, donated it to an eager grandkid, and loved the beans.

Swapped Black Beans for Fava and used a sweet/spicy chili sauce as well as maple syrup instead of molasses.  Took it to a Fourth of July Barbecue where there were three other pots of beans and people bragging about using dry beans instead of canned beans.  At the end of the BBQ mine were all gone and those other pots remained full.  This is now a family favorite.

It turned really well.  Both me and my wife loved it. I had some minor modifications to the recipe. The three types of beans I used was pinto, kidney, and black.

I made this recipe in my instant pot. I  started with dried beans and plenty of water, setting them to high-pressure cook for 20 minutes, then let the steam release for 10 minutes. Drained the beans then added the bacon to my pot and cooked it up to crisp (keeping the bacon drippings). I then added the beans and remaining ingredients to my pot and set it to slow cook for about 40 minutes. I double the recipe because I was feeding a crowd, there was nothing left at the end of the meal! Delicious!

We didn't like this. No flavor, really, except the chili sauce. The sauce was super thin and not enough to cover the beans. There are a lot of beans here.

 I made it because I knew it would be a great protein replacement with no sugar. While I did like the tartness, there definitely needed to be other flavors here. 

 We both ate just a little and the rest went into the compost bin. Won't be making this again.

First time I made this dish so I stayed right with the recipe except for the Lima beans. We don't care for Lima beans so I replaced them with two cans of pinto beans with jalapeños. Everybody loved them. So easy.

It was very dry.  Next time, I will increase the sauce.  Also, even though I used canned beans, the beans themselves were very hard.  Maybe because there isn't enough sauce.  I thought it would be a bit spicier, too, since it has chili sauce.  I would use more chili sauce the next time.  I cooked the bacon beforehand, and I think that was a good call.  I will make this again doubling the sauce.  If that works, I'd give the recipe more stars.

Delicious.  Mine turned out a bit on the dryer side so next time I might try making 1.5x the amount of the recipe.

These were fantastic!! I put them in for a hour with the ribs that I was smoking to give them some smoke flavor then fininshed them off in the oven per instructions. What a great taste.
