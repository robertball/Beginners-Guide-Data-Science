I liked this recipe, but made a few changes.  I cooked the rice in advance and refrigerated it for a few hours before starting to prepare the fried rice.  Instead of cooking the egg in advance, I just added the beaten uncooked eggs (just 2 eggs)to the rice mixture at the end, stir-frying it until the egg was completely cooked.  You can tell when the egg is cooked because it isn't shiny anymore.  A Chinese friend taught me how to do this.

Everyone loves this fried rice.  It is very important that you use cold white rice so the rice doesn't get mushy when you fry it. Also, I add some rice vinegar and sesame oil to the side of the pan when frying the rice. You can add cooked chicken, shrimp, or pork also at the end.  Great for using up leftovers.

Sorry, there was an error in Tip 2. Please refer to this one instead:

Tip: 2. Remember NOT to use veges that release too much water when frying, like shittake mushrooms. Even if you have the perfect rice grain, it'll just get soggy as the rice soaks up the water. HAPPY COOKING~~~

This is a really good fried rice. I change a couple things is all.  First I cook the rice ahead of time and chill it because I think it fries up better cold.  And I skip the bacon and use chicken or pork.  This is a family favorite that I never have to worry about leftobers with because they eat every bite.

I use this recipe as a base for the fried rice I make.  As other reviewers have noted, rice cooked in advance seems to be preferrable but fresh rice is fine too.  I don't put bacon in ours but do use 2 TBLS of bacon grease in addition to the oil.  I also add the raw eggs on top of all my ingredients and cook until everything is shiny and the egg is done.  We like this recipe best with chopped shrimp but I have also used chicken.  I use frozen peas but this is a very versatile dish and you could use almost anything you like in it.  We have it about once a month as a main dish and then use the leftovers as a side with other meals.  It's a favorite in our house.

I had one of those frozen Beef and Broccoli bags for dinner, but thought it wouldn't be enough to feed a family of five so I thought I would make this fried rice and add to it.  I did not have bacon so I just fried up 2 pieces of bologna and cut it up  (it worked fine).  I cooked the rice in chicken broth to give it flavor.  I used three eggs as suggested and it turned out fine for me.  I added a few drops of sesame oil, a 1/2 teaspoon of fish sauce, shredded carrots, about a cup of peas, 3 green onions, a little more soy sauce than stated and a little more salt and pepper.  I also added white pepper as well. After frying everything until heated through, I gave it a taste and it was to die for.  I ended up eating this fried rice instead of the bagged broccoli and beef!  My husband and three kids thought it was way better.  I won't buy those bags anymore.  This was so easy and tasted much better!  Many thanks.

Good basic recipe.  Great way to use up leftover meat and vegetables of any kind.  I use 2 eggs and season them with a little soy sauce instead of salt & pepper.  I only use 3 strips bacon, diced and cooked until they are just brown not too crispy.  I add a large clove of GARLIC pressed or minced to the fat and cook it a few seconds just before adding the rice.  I add frozen baby shrimp or any kind of leftover meat I have, like diced chicken, leftover barbecued meats, pot roast, ham, I have even used leftover cheeseburger patties crumbled up (my kids loved this). Careful not to put in too much soy sauce.

We disagree with most other reviewers -- we didn't like this at all.  We did omit the bacon, but I don't think it would've helped much to keep it.  The soy sauce flavor was too strong, and there was no other flavor coming through.  We added mushrooms and shredded carrots, which helped a little, but all in all the texture and flavor were just "blah" for us.

This is a great recipe for fried rice. The only one I've ever made using hot rice that doesn't get mushy. Also I usually play with recipes, but I made this as stated and wouldn't change a thing. I've made it twice this week alone. Thanks for sharing. Jeneen

Follow up 5/28/10,I have made this recipe several times  since first reviewing it. Again, comes out perfect every time. I think the secret to it NOT coming out mushy with the hot rice is that when you add the rice to the hot oil/bacon grease and stir, you are coating each rice grain and protecting it from becoming mushy. When adding the rice to the pan make sure there is only oil/bacon grease and rice. Make sure you stir this well and coat every grain.  Anything with a water base, i.e. onions, meat veggies etc. will make your rice come out mushy.

VERY, VERY GOOD! I will definately make this again! I read all the reviews before I made this and did make a few changes. I used 2 eggs instead of 3, a handful of peas instead of the whole package (I'm not crazy about peas), and did NOT add the 2 tsps of oil to the pan (there was plenty of bacon grease). I made this with 'Asian Beef Skewers' recipe from this site and it was delicious.

The first time I made this I followed the ingredients faithfully (except the bacon which I didn't have on hand) but I did use leftover cold rice.  (That was actually the reason for the recipe, looking for something to use up the rice!)  It was good.  The second time, I made a few changes which made the recipe better.  First, I again used the leftover rice which I think is a good choice.  Then, I sauteed the onion (used red this time, though prefer the original green) along with carrot cut in matchsticks and celery, because they were the things I had in the fridge, but which we ended up liking better than the peas (it's a texture thing.)  I cooked the egg differently this time, simply doing a scramble until they were soft and still pretty wet.  That was a much better technique for the egg.  The first time I found the egg to be kind of tough by the time the recipe was finished.  This time I added the veggies and the egg into the rice after thoroughly heating it in the oil until it was just a tiny bit crispy in spots so that neither was overdone.  The other minor changes were a bit of sesame oil in place of some of the vegetable oil as well as the addition of red pepper flakes to give it a bit of heat.  This time I forgot the bacon (oops!) but I can't imagine it wouldn't be a good addition - it is bacon, after all.  The basic recipe is good, but I think with these tweaks it was even better for us.  Definitely a repeat!

I liked this recipe. I left out the bacon. But in the future I would add pork, shrimp or chicken if I had it. It was great just with vegetables. I followed others suggestions and used cooked cold rice and it was not mushy at all.

Boiled rice in chicken broth & used leftover chicken instead of bacon. I also added chunks of zucchini, yellow squash, and mushrooms. Family enjoyed it as a main dish with hot & sour soup on the side, and there were enough leftovers for 2 large servings.

This was really good, even though I forgot the eggs like a freaking idiot. As suggested by others, I cooked the rice ahead of time and let it cool, also substituted diced white onion instead of green. I will make again and again (with eggs).

I think this is excellent as is, but whenever I cook rice, I use my rice cooker and cook quite a bit of rice. So the second time I made it, I used leftover rice. Although rice from the rice cooker is soft and fluffy, once it's leftover, it cools off in big clumps. I rinse it out in a colander with cool water, let in drain while I proceed with the recipe as follows. It's easy to throw in a few leftover veggies or meat to your rice and it's all good.

This is a good fried rice recipe that can be adapted to fit whatever you've got in the fridge.  It can be made in smaller quantities using leftover Chinese takeout rice.  It works best with cold rice so that the grains stay separate and the rice doesn't turn mushy.   I've made this using bacon (our favorite), as well as leftover Easter ham, sliced deli ham, leftover chicken, leftover pork and mini salad shrimp. (Spam would work, too.) You can use any kind of onion, although green onion adds some nice color.  Leftover cooked carrots are also a nice colorful addition. I don't measure the soy sauce -- I just sprinkle enough in to turn the rice a light brown color, maybe a tablespoon of soy sauce to 3 cups of rice.  Be sure to use low-sodium soy sauce so it doesn't make the rice too salty.

After slicing and putting up my homemade hickory smoked bacon, I had plenty of "bits" leftover and this was the perfect go-to recipe.  I made this as stated with the following exceptions since I didn't have some stuff.  I substituted 1/4 C finely diced white onion for the green onion and sauteed it after the bacon along with 1 clove of minced garlic.  I also cooked the rice in beef broth instead of water and then chilled it for 6 hours.  Other than those minor tweaks, I made as directed.  This was a lovely recipe, and a great jump off point for other variations.  I cannot wait to experiment :)

Not a fan of this recipe. It was very bland and tasted like plain bacon and rice. Even adding onions and extra soy sauce did not help much.

I love to tweak things in healthy direction so I used brown basmati rice, green peppers instead of frozen peas and uncured bacon, but it was still phenomonal, my kids scarfed it down and asked me to make it again.  Also, evoo instead of veg oil.

I read the reviews and I knew this dish was 5 stars, and yet I was still surprised at how good it was.  I added garlic salt instead of regular, and only 1 C of peas, but this recipe didn't need any changes! It is really good. My husband said he liked it better than any take out we've had lately! The bacon adds a subtle rich flavoring. I would have never thought to add it. Very Very Good!  I served it with Chicken Lo Mein (which was also very good)and some egg rolls. Yum.  A great Asian Meal. It will be a regular on our meal rotation!

My husband and I really enjoy this recipe--the bacon is a delicious addition to fried rice.  I make this several times a month;  I frequently use frozen mixed vegetables instead of just peas.  Thanks for the great recipe!

THIS RICE WAS JUST AS GOOD AS OUR LOCAL CHINESE RESTAURANT.  I WAS A BIT SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE BACON AT FIRST, BUT IT WAS THE KEY INGREDIENT.  VERY GOOD.  I WILL MAKE THIS AT LEAST ONCE A MONTH.  MY PICKY 5 YEAR OLD ACTUALLY ASKED FOR SECONDS.

VERY good fried rice recipe. I didn't have bacon so I used center cut pork chops, which I cut in cubes, seasoned & fried. The rice was very moist and tasty! Husband said it's a keeper :)

I didn't add the bacon to this recipe, since I didn't have any lying around.  But both my husband and I really enjoyed it anyway.  Very simple and really yummy.

easy to make and good way to use up leftover rice.  I tried a couple of modifications.  I added frozen brocoli and some sliced fresh carrots.  Also added a few shakes to taste of crushed red pepper seasoning.  Also tried it with sesame oil instead of vegetable oil.  Does give a slightly different flavor.

This recipe is so quick, easy and tasty, I don't see how anyone can rate it anything less than a 5! I didn't know what to cook one evening for dinner so I decided to search All Recipes and found this one. It turned out great even without the peas and green onions (which I didn't have on hand). I'll definitely be making this again! Thanks for sharing!

This was good tasting but the rice came out mushy.  1 2/3 cup of water was not enough to cook the rice in, even when covered the water all boiled away before the rice was cooked and I had to add more water.  I might try this again but using a precooked rice like Uncle Ben's or something.

This is so good.  It will become my staple recipe.  I've made it with peas and it was good and made it again when I didn't have peas.  Substituted carrots and green peppers instead and cooked them a few min before adding the rice.  This was really good too!

An easy recipe for fried rice!! Pre-cooking and chilling the rice helps it from getting mushy. I used coconut oil in place of veg oil and bacon grease. And a surprising {easy} alternative.... I substituted crumbled (real) bacon bits! It's not my cooking style to use anything like this, but I had them left over from a school fundraiser and found myself out of bacon when I went to make this recipe.... so I took a chance and WOW!!

This was delicious! Our family of 5 loved it and gobbled it right up! Right down to our 18 month old! Definitely worth keeping. An excellent base recipe that can be changed up very easily! We used pork bits instead of bacon, and I'm sure the options are endless.

Pretty good!  Make sure your rice is cold though, otherwise it will be sticky/gummy.  I only used 2 eggs and omitted the bacon because I was serving it with my own Sweet and Sour Chicken.  I also used frozen corn - about 3/4c and a frozen mixture of peas and carrots.  I thought it was a tad bit bland and added about 1t. fish sauce, which helped.  I really like the option of cooking the egg seperately as we have allergies in our family.  Making it this way still gives the egg lovers their 'eggy' fried rice.

Excellent!  This recipe was so simple to make, and it tasted great.  I added a few additional vegetables to it, slightly increased the soy sauce, and cut out the bacon, and I was very happy with the results.  Maybe not as good as restaurant Chinese, but I will definitely be making this again.

I was happy with how this turned out, but I thought that the bacon grease affected the taste a little too much.  I used a bag of mixed veggies and that helped to make the dish more lively and colorful.  I think in the future, I might try a different (and cheaper) meat with this recipe (and just add oil, if need be).  Fried Rice should be cost effective!

Made this more of a main course by adding cooked chicken breast.  Next time I will use fewer peas, otherwise it was excellent!!!

Very Good, quick and easy.  My favorite kind of recipe.  This recipe is great for those nights when you just want to get something on the table in a hurry.  To make it even quicker, I used all ready cooked frozen rice I had on hand.

I really liked this recipe.  Tasted as good as at my favorite Chinese take-out restaurant. The only difference I made was adding peas.  Yummy!

I left the bacon out, but added some Chinese style pork I made for that dinner.  My husband loved it and asked me to make it again.  It took awhile to make because I though that when I put the rice in the pan, it would of browned on it's own. It didn't do so until I put the soy sauce in and that 'browned' it.  Next time it won't take me as long.

I made this recipe according to directions.  It was so very good.  It's a versatile recipe.  I'd consider changing the peas to Chinese cabbage and add a little garlic powder.

I can only give this 4 stars because I messed up.  I don't always use measuring cups and spoons. So when I was cooking I went into the fridge to grab the soy sauce bottle and started pouring it directly into the rice only to realize I smelled bbq.  Holy smokes I poured Liquid Hickory Smoke into my fried rice.  What was I thinking?  Anyway, I had some grilled pork left over from a couple days ago.  I chopped that up, added it to the rice, along with the soy sauce too.  And guess what?  It actually turned out great.  I'm sure it was all due to the bacon.  LOL.  I guess it's like other say... this is a great base recipe and you really can add just about anything to it, even Liquid Smoke.

It was OK. It wasn't salty enough so next time I'll try adding some more flavor. I added chicken so it made a great main meal!

I have been making this recipe for years and finally decided I should review it.  It is so easy to make with leftover rice.  My family prefers I use carrots instead of peas so I will saute the carrots in the bacon grease.  You can easily make changes to this recipe and use whatever leftovers you have.

Great recipe... I used some leftover whole grain brown rice I had in the fridge. Also, I didnt have any scallions on hand and I dont like peas... (lol I know... a little picky)... but I used a leftover bag of spinach and arugula mix, sauteed it after the eggs and added it all together.. used soy sauce to taste... and voila!! it was great

This is the best fried rice recipe I've tried and will stick with it.  I made rice as I usually do, 1 c rice to 1 3/4 c water, and put it in the fridge to cool before frying.  I used ham instead of bacon and increased the oil a little to make up for no bacon fat.  Followed the recipe as written other than that.

I used leftover white rice from the night. I also didn't have any frozen peas (it's a texture thing), but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  I liked that the egg is cooked after the bacon, and not when all the other ingredients are added.  I will probably use more soy sauce and/or green onions next time, but there will be a next time, this was so good.  Thank you!

This is a good recipe, and the possibilities for variation are almost endless... But what's up with the 1/8 cup soy sauce? Wouldn't it have been easier to just say 2 tablespoons?

Made this with some minor changes.  I used about 6oz of peas and only used two eggs.  This may be the best fried rice I have ever had.

Really good! I like the instructions for the egg, and also liked the amount of soy sauce. My only complaint is the texture of the rice.  I'm still going to search for the perfect recipe that teaches me the perfect technique for properly frying the rice.

This was flat-out excellent.  I left out the bacon and just made up some steam-in-the-bag peas.  I also think it could use a little bit more green onions.  But it's a great recipe!

This came out really good and was very simple to make. I didn't have frozen peas so I used some chopped cabbage and fresh green beans. I also didnt have green onion so I used a yellow onion. I sauteed the onion, cabbage, and green beans in a little oil and then added it to the rice, egg, bacon. I also added a little seame seeds.

This was a great recipe for the end of the month out of money pantry. We always have rice so all i had to buy was 3 strips of bacon and one thick slice of ham. Added half a bag of frozen stir fry veggies and doubled the amount of rice, soy, and eggs. Was a great cheap dinner. I think I spent $6 on meat and frozen veg, had rice, eggs and soy on hand, had plenty left over for two lunches the next day so I got 6 servings out of this. Will definatly be adding this the the end of month list.

Hmm, I am not sure what to think of this one. I did tweak it some, but mainly to save time. I used 1 oz of pre-cooked bacon instead of 4 oz of regular bacon. I had some rice already cooked from the rice cooker. I didn't have 10 oz of peas, but had about 5 oz. I am kind of glad I was short on the bacon and peas, because it already seemed like there was barely any rice by the time everything was added. I had made it for lunch because I knew I could throw it together quickly, as I had most of the ingredients handy in the fridge, and I thought it was healthy to at first glance. However, with 3 eggs, 1/4 lb of bacon, the bacon grease, and all the sodium from the salt, bacon, and soy sauce I don't think I looked too well. Putting that aside, it was actually quite flavorful compared to other fried rice recipes I have tried, more likely because of the bacon. I just really wished the end product had more rice as that is what I was craving!

I definitely agree- make the rice in advance and refrigerate it uncovered for at least a day. It helps it to not get mushy. Also it helps if you have the heat up really really hot and let the rice sit a moment when you first put it in so pieces can get a little crisp.  All in all this came out perfect and delicious! The only ingredients I added were a pinch of ginger and few cloves of garlic. Very similar to my favorite teppan yaki place.

I paired this recipe with the Honey-Garlic Glazed Meatballs from this site.
http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Honey-Garlic-Glazed-Meatballs/Detail.aspx
Pretty easy to make. I made the rice
that night, and cooled it in the freezer to make it easier to work with. Went well
with the meatballs. I omitted the peas in
exchange for matchstick carrots. Good recipe, will make again.

Not bad, but not great either. I did not have any green onions so I omitted those. Also I may possibly have used too much rice, but still I would not make it again. I made this with Candied Garlic Chicken Wings and unfortunately neither turned out for me, so it was pizza for us!

This was pretty good. I used evoo instead of vegetable oil and 4 pieces of thick cut bacon.  Wasnt too greasy at all. I gave it 4 stars because it could use a little more flavor. I will add some ginger next time.

This was delicious. I didn't use bacon, I used three slices of ham julienned. I used sesame oil instead of veg oil. I cooked Calrose rice with a cube of chicken boullion and cooled to room temp. I sauteed 1/2 chopped sweet onion in about 2 Tbl of sesame oil til tender, then added the rice and rest. I subbed a tablespoon of freeze dried chives for the green onion, and only used two small handfuls of frozen baby peas. This was better than most restaurants' and I know we'll have this again. Thanks homemaker, we really enjoyed this.

This was fabulous!  I would recommend halving the amount of bacon (although you might still want to cook up the full amount and eat half as an appetizer so that you have the right amount of grease).

A good recipe, very close to what you would get in a Chinese restaurant. The only changes I made were using canned peas instead of frozen ones and adding fresh cilantro. A nice and quick fix for weekdays!

This is very close to the "local" style fried rice I use to get in Hawaii.  To get it closer to that version, try adding either some spam, or portugese sausage, or both.  And just a bit of oyster sauce.  Ono!

I really liked this fried rice. The bacon is what gives it flavor, so I wouldn't leave it out. I added a frozen peas and carrots mix. I also refrigerated the rice first before frying it as another reviewer suggested.

I tried this recipe and didn't like the results.
The rice was too soggy and it tasted more like a breakfast dish than traditional fried rice.
So I cooked my rice the day before (a bit undercooked is best) and used diced ham, onions, carrots, peas and scrambled the eggs in the pan.
Guess I made a new recipe.
Anyway it was good. I make a ton as my family loves it and it is great leftover!

I served this for my sister's birthday because Chinese food is her favorite and everyone raved about this recipe. It was better than our local Chinese restaurant that we have been going to for years. The bacon added a great smokey flavor to it. Next time I might try shrimp or chicken too.

This was an easy and tasty fried rice recipe.  I had more peas than the recipe called for, and despite the overload of peas, it was still good. I followed other reviewer's suggestions and made the rice ahead of time and actually scrambling the egg in the pan.

My family really loved this recipe.  I was skeptical about using bacon, but it added alot of flavor to the dish.  Next time I make it I will use less eggs, and I will also use fresh vegetables instead of frozen.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

My husband and I enjoyed this with Sweet Teriyaki Marinated London Broil (used marinade from Sweet Teriyaki Beef Skewer recipe) and WOW! Sweet and Sour Sauce. I needed to add a bit more soy sauce than the recipe called for but other than that, followed it to the letter. My husband said "it's a keeper!"

Delicious and easy fried rice recipe. I used ham instead of bacon, but still used bacon grease (from our breakfast that morning) to fry the rice. Great that day and great heated up as leftovers! Can't wait to try it with other meat.

this is a really good recipe my boyfriend loves it and I do as well. Instead of using just peas i used mixed vegetables. Also when your cooking the bacon to give it a really nice flavour put a few garlic cloves in the oil and put the bacon it in and cook, look out as it does like to splash a bit. Then mix the rice etc in it. It came out amazing will differently be making this again.

thank you.

Very easy to make. I use pans that don't require oil, so I cut that way down, and did not add the bacon.

Yummy!  I used rice that I had made in the morning and let sit out for a while so it would dry out a little.  This worked out well because then the rice didn't get mushy.  Also I didn't use bacon but I can imagine that it would have been delicious.  I will probably use more soy sauce next time but all in all I liked it!

This was soooo good.  I added a little extra garlic because I always do, and it was fantastic.  I appreciate other reviewers that recommended to cool the cooked rice before frying.  I've attempted fried rice without knowing that and it was clumpy.  When I made this, two of us ate almost all of it.

This definitely works better with cold rice- I am not sure how it would turn out otherwise!  If you are like me, and need to cool the rice in a hurry, spread it on a cookie sheet and pop it in the fridge- it cools down quickly that way.  I pulled out my wok for this, and it worked very well.  I tried to make a well in the middle of the rice to scramble the eggs, but it ended up just coating the rice.  That turned out to be a happy accident, as a subtle eggy flavor was tasted throughout.  My second attempt at scrambling the eggs worked like a charm, so I ended up with a total of 4 eggs in the rice, which was lovely.  I didn't measure the soy sauce or the seasonings- I just tasted as I went until I got what I was looking for.  This was very easy, and incredibly delicious!  I can totally see playing around with this- maybe add some chicken and more veggies to make it a main dish.  As is, it went perfectly with the pork lo mein I served tonight.  Thanks homemaker- this will be a regular on my dinner table  :)

Soooo good. I got to use my wok which I rarely get to whip out. I added more soy sauce to mine because I also added more vegetables. A green and red pepper, carrots, onion and celery.  My hair smells like a Chinese restaurant but I don't mind.  I cooked the rice and refrigerated it for a few hours before and had no problems with sticky rice.

I had extra quinoa to use and had to find a way to use the leftovers.  Simply using what i had (no bacon, cooked asaparagus, chopped turkey ham, green onions), and using olive oil instead of vegetable oil for a healthier meal.  I scrambled the eggs instead of cutting them up in strips. Worth trying and so easy to improvise based on what you have around the kitchen.

This fried rice is a total hit in my house!!! Like the other reviewers said I added cold rice, but instead of using plain rice I added a chinese garlic chicken and rice that we had for dinner last week. IT WAS AMAZING!! Truely a perfect recipe for any leftovers, I also added leftover BBQ chicken, it just added to the layers of flavor! One other TIP i would give is dont add the egg until the end cooking it in the fried rice and letting the heat scramble the eggs makes it tastes authentic. I recomend this recipe and will be using it again in the near future!!

This was delicious!  I cooked it for my boyfriend and he swore up and down that I bought it from a chinese restaurant and just put the bacon in myself and claimed that I made it, lol.  He loved it.  I did take another reviewers advice and add the raw egg to the rice, it cooked/ tasted great!

I have been making this for years, (and many, many times) however I had never used an exact recipe but this is actually very close and it really is good...sometimes I use mixed veggies (frozen or canned) sometimes no onion at all, just a shake of onion powder. The bacon is essential in the flavor though, very rich and just very tasty, its inexpensive and I will always be making this for myself and my family. Thank you for sharing

Finally a recipe close to my recipe...  We love this for camping breakfast (we take a rice cooker with us).  I use 1-2 rice cookers FULL of rice, 1 lb bacon, 6-10 eggs, 1 bun gr onions.  Cook rice; set aside (overnight if possible).  Dice bacon; fry until crisp, drain, set aside. Save some grease if needed.  Scramble eggs; season w/ soysauce and/or blk pepper.  Set aside.  Dice gr onions.  Lightly grease your skillet, add 1/3 rice (ensure it's not clumped), 1/3 bacon, 1/3 eggs, 1/3 gr onion. Stir/season w/ soy sauce.  Continue until all ingredients used.  Season to taste w/ soy sauce/fish sauce/blkpepper.  Fry 2 eggs easy over and put on top of ea service.  Serve w/pork sausage links, toast, coffee on side.  GREAT way to start your fishing day! (You can also adjust ingredients to just make at home, plus add whatever leftovers).  I solely use bacon (Spam isn't as tasty/leftover link sausage was too 'sagey') and just eggs/gr onions.  Simple easy and tasty!

I really liked this recipe, I would have given it 4 1/2 stars but wasn't an option.  I haven't made stir fry since I was a teenager, which has been awhile.  I used turkey bacon, olive oil, white onion (that was all I had), I only used a cup of pees (which was plenty), 1/2 cup of chopped carrots, low sodium soy sauce, organic eggs and brown rice.  It really turned out well.  I suggest using a wok.  I don't have one so I used my iron skillet and made quite a mess because even though I set it to 4 servings, there was a lot.  It was a great recipe and I will try it again, after I buy a wok.

Eh, this was average. I liked the addition of bacon, thought 10oz bag of peas was way to much, and i missed my usual diced carrots and onions in my fried rice. Average rating for an average recipe.

Perfect!!!! My first attempt at fried rice. It was delicious, I did have to use more water though, and I used a low sodium soy sauce. The bacon and egg makes all the difference!! I will make this over and over. I used a Terriyaki chicken recipe from this site too, and it was a perfect dinner for my family =)

This was awesome!  Both my husband and I loved this.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and microwaved the bacon and then crumbled it.  A little healthier w/o the bacon fat.  Great recipe.  Thank you!

I've had this recipe for yrs and LOVE it! My recipe called for leftover cold rice and it works better than fresh(to me). You can add almost anything u wish and get good results. I love leftover grilled/bbq'd pork or chicken added in strips, the smoky flavor meets the bacon and parties in your mouth. Leftover or fresh veggies work, too. I like crisp-cooked frozen mixed veg. added last. This is one of those "bomb proof" recipes, make it your own. A dash of toasted sesame oil, chili flakes or oil. I'm so glad I saw this, it's time to make it again.

Very Good and very easy!  I used brown rice and followed recipe exactly except that the brown rice needed to simmer longer.  I used a large pot and covered it tightly and simmered on a low heat.

This was good. I would recommend using a 2:1 water to rice ratio as opposed to the listed amounts.  There was definitely not enough water to cook the rice. I kept having to add water and the rice came out kind of gooey.  I opted not to cook in bacon grease because who needs all that fat?  So I cooked some bacon in the microwave and crumbled it in.  Oh, and I took the advice of another reviewer and just mixed the beaten eggs in with everything.  I won't do that next time.  It added to the sticky, mushy quality of the rice, I'd rather have the cooked egg pieces or strips mixed in.  The only other thing I might suggest is adding a bit more soy sauce.  This had a great taste, but the consistency was kind of off for me.  I will definitely try it again though.

Very good recipe that I've used numerous times and always get rave reviews.  I never add the peas since I don't eat them and I generally substitute white onion for the green onion since I normally do not have the green on hand.  Even with these changes, the dish is still delicious.  If I want to make it a complete meal, I'll saute some cubed, boneless chicken breast and toss them in after finishing the rice recipe.

Ohmigosh!!!   Soooooo good!  I can't wait for my daughters to come home from college so I can make this for them!  They are fried rice afficionados and luv luv luv bacon in anything!  I didn't use quite the amount of peas called for, the dish needed NO salt OR pepper, used a bit more soy than was called for and added in some bean sprouts.  This is definitely a big, huge keeper!!!!

I made a few minor, minor changes...I used 2 "boil in bags" of white rice and after boiling them, I refrigerated them for a few hours before making this.  I didn't do the whole egg flippy thing.  Instead, I just scrambled the eggs in a wok and took them out while they were still just a bit runny.

I made this easier by using leftover rice from the fridge (I always cook too much anyway), a cup of frozen vegetables mix (thawed in the micro for 10s) and frozen precooked bacon from the freezer. I used sesame oil for a more Asian flavor, and added a red bell pepper. Cooked the pepper and green onions in the oil, added soy and teriaki sauce (about 2T each), then the rice, bacon and veggies. At the end I added two beaten eggs (uncooked), and cooked for another 2-3 mins. It was so easy and fast. Eating it right now, very tasty.

Excellent dish. I'll try some other suggestions and add shredded chicken. Omitted the bacon, but DID use bacon drippings as specified - great flavor. Added diced carrots.

I'm a terrible rice cook so I guess my review is a little biased. I tried this recipe in a wok and it came out okay. It wasn't the fried rice flavor I was looking for, but it wasn't too bad.

Good, basic recipe.  I actually add 1/4 cup soy sauce and an extra egg.  I have also substituted ham for bacon and it is still great!

I made this recipe into a main course.  I omitted the bacon altogether but added: mushrooms, garlic powder and onion powder, broccoli, diced boneless and skinless chicken breast and more soy sauce - I used reduced salt soy sauce.  A very tasty and filling meal.  Thanks!

A very good fried rice recipe.  I don't use all of the bacon grease or oil (just a nonstick pan) and it's absolutely yummy.

This had a really good flavor to it and the bacon was a nice touch.  The company ate it all up.  I didn't use the whole package of peas and it was fine.  I kept a little of the bacon grease and only added a small amount of oil.  Thanks -- we will make this again.

This was excellent. I followed the recipe as is except I didn't have the viniger and I cooked the breasts in oven at 325. It tasted great. As a side I tossed up some fried rice with what was left in my fridge- some peppers, onions, and an egg. I put soy sauce over it and mixed in some of the extra tariyaki sauce and it came out great for a quick side!

I can not make fried rice! It just never turned out great until I tried this recipe. I did cook my rice a day a head so I started out with cold rice.  It was so perfect and beautiful! I was so excited on the turn out.  My husband really likes fried rice, but I could never make it taste good or look good for that matter!  This was so great! Thank you for posting!

This was a good recipe but not my favorite fried rice recipe. It is better to make the rice before hand, as said by other reviewers (which I should have read before I made the rice and not afterwards). The second time I made this, I had some cooked rice from another meal in my fridge and I used that. It was much better than the first time. I of course added some ingrediants and left others out, mostly due to what I had. I found that chicken was very good with this.

Loved this!!! It was a little time consuming, but well worth it. I made it exactly as the recipe stated, but I ended up adding a little more soy sauce on my plate. Next time I would probably increase the soy to 1/4 cup. Will definitely make again!

My family loved it!  I did not use bacon or eggs as I didn't have any but I added chopped ham and sauteed it with the vegetables.  I used brown rice and did not add any salt whatsoever because I knew that the low sodium soy sauce would be enough and it was.  Also added chopped garlic

UPDATE: MY HUBS AND I HAD LEFTOVER RICE FOR LUNCH TODAY. I'M NOT A "LEFTOVER" ANYTHING FAN, BUT I HAVE TO SAY, THIS IS MUCH BETTER THE NEXT DAY! WHO KNEW? :) Not bad! Although my hubs enjoyed this more than I did, I wouldn't hesitate to make this again in the future. The addition of bacon really adds a LOT of flavor and is what makes this dish so unique. Add a protein and you've got a filling main dish (I added ~ 1/2 lb. pre-cooked salad shrimp to ours)! Besides bulking this up a bit, I made a few more (minor) changes. Because I already had a bag of frozen peas / carrots handy, I used that instead of peas only. I added quite a bit more soy sauce than called for, maybe even double the amount (personal preference) and substituted equal amounts of sesame / wok oil for the vegetable oil called for. I also chopped my egg rather than slicing it into thin strips and prepared my rice in advance (and refrigerated it). To make a proper fried rice, you should ALWAYS start with COLD, leftover rice. Served with egg rolls on the side, this was a fun meal. I still prefer CJ's fried rice, but this was decent nonetheless. My hubs liked this SO much that he told ALL of his co-workers about our meal lol! That along makes this a winner in my book! :-) Thanks again, homemaker!

This recipe was a hit in my house!  Very easy to make and versatile, too.  I followed other suggestions and used cold, cooked rice, added sesame oil, carrots, mushrooms and chicken.  Did not add bacon but did have some bacon grease to fry it in.  I will definitely be making this again and using different meat/veggie combos.

Really good and easy.  I added some sauteed cabbage and bean sprouts since I had them!  I also used beef instead of bacon since that is also what we.

This was very good. I did not use the additional vegetable oil but instead just used the bacon grease to fry it up. I also used leftover refrigerated "Onion Rice" from this site. It was a keeper for us! Thanks fr sharing!

I'm giving this 4 stars only because I altered it some, otherwise it would be 5. I pre-cooked the rice in my steamer and refrigerated it per other reviewers suggestions. I only had canned peas, so drained them well but would definitely use frozen next time. Had bacon already made, so I just used 3 Tbsps olive oil. I cut the bacon into small pieces, would love to try with leftover ham or chicken. Added 2 beaten eggs and just a little sesame oil at the end. Yum! Going in the regular rotation at my house.

Absolutely Delishious.  Followed the directions exactly except for two things. LIke others I used chilled rice.  Also since I eat almost everything all-natural and/or organic, i used turkey bacon.  Once in my bowl I also added a little Siracha, which i put on just about everything.  Next time going to add red peppers and carrots....not because this receipe needs fixing..i just think it will make it so pretty and even more nutritious.  Don't hesitate one minute to make this..its Da Bomb!!

This was good, but I prefer ham instead of bacon. and I wasn't too fond of the bacon grease flavor. I like how the egg was prepared though.

Very good, I microwaved the bacon (b/c I hate grease splatter) and probably should have cooked it in the pan for the fat and a bit more flavor - will try that next time.  Even so, very tasty.

Outstanding!! I cooked the rice the night before, adding chicken boullion to the boiling water. Used red onion instead of green and sauteed it in the bacon fat after frying the bacon. Added water chestnuts and shredded carrot in addition to the peas. This dish was just wonderful. My son doesn't eat pork. I'm going to try making it with salami instead of bacon next time. I think it will be delicious!! This is a keeper!

This recipe went well for me but I felt it could have been more flavorful.  When I reheated some for my lunch the next day, I added a dash of onion powder and garlic powder and a little more soy sauce.  Seemed to perk it up a bit.  I'll more than likely try this recipe again with a couple additions.  Was certainly easy and quick!

Absolutely awesome rice...I did omit the last 2 tsp of oil as the bacon fat was enough.  Plus I let my rice cool first so it wasn't mushy!  This is the best rice dish ever...my husband hates peas but loves this!

The bacon makes this really good even though at first I was skeptical.  Loved by kids and adults :)

So easy and flavorful!  Even my fussy children loved it!  I cooked the bacon the day before to save time.  Goes well with many meats - I served with the slow cooker pork chops.  Great side dish!

I was leary about taste because of a few other raters. I cooked the rice with one cube of chicken bouillon, added one teaspoon of toasted seasme oil to the bacon grease, added two finely chopped pieces of garlic to the rice when it was frying and added a teaspoon or two of ginger powder. I also added a shredded carrot. I like it! I'll make it again.

Awesome Rice!  I added more soya sauce and used frozen peas, carrots and corn.  I also added mushrooms.  And added a little bit of chicken bullion for flavor.

Excellent!! I would not recommend skipping the green onion.  I only had one, and the few bites with the onion in it made it so much better! This recipe was a hit with the family! I even got the kids (and hubby) to eat peas! I also added chicken seasoned with ginger and soy sauce.  Thank you for this recipe!

I made this for the second time tonite.  Both times it was great, but I changed a couple things to make it a complete meal.  I added strips of pepper steak to it at the end, and used frozen carrots and peas together.  Also, instead of using bacon, I used Hormel real bacon bits (next to the fake bacon bits at the store).  It made it really easy and I didnt have the bacon mess.  Fabulous recipe!!! All 5 kids and hubby love it!

I tried to make this into a healthy recipe. I really liked it, but I turned it into a different recipe almost. I did not use any oil, I used Jennie-o turkey bacon, and egg whites only. I really liked it!

I made this last night and it was the best.  I was the only one to eat it last night, b/c husband on night so I am waiting on him to tell me what he thinks when he wakes up.  I use white onion instead of green and I put soy sauce in by taste, I just kept adding the soy until I thought it was right. I also used peas and carrots.  This is very good and I will make it often.

To hjk458, I think it's simply to make the pieces bite-sized. Personally, I find it easier to just scramble the eggs and break them up with a spatula in the wok, then remove them to a small plate. When I add them back to the rice at the end and mix them in, they break up some more, so I don't see a need to slice them up. Just a personal preference, though :).

This was a great recipe. The bacon made a great addition. I loved the crunch it added. I made this with grilled asian chicken and used some of the sauce over the rice. Everyone in our family loved it!

Excellent!  The family loved it!  I cooked the rice the day before and kept it in a freezer bag in the 'fridge.  Really made it easy to work with.  Didn't use the bacon, but I did use the bacon grease... my kids ate the bacon while waiting for dinner.  Absolutely a keeper!

The first word that comes to mind is WOW!
This is so simple and easy.  The only change I made was instead of just frozen peas I used a mixture of peas and carrots.  
I will make again soon. A+

This was amazing! 
I did however, do some alterations. I used a "fattier" turkey bacon, instead of pork bacon. Make sure you use a turkey bacon that has SOME fat. I also added carrots and celery. This dish is AMAZING! I will make again!

This was very good!  I used what I had on hand which were the basics; rice, soy sauce, bacon, oil, and egg.  I drained some of the bacon grease before I added the oil and when I did I added 1 tbsp veggie oil and 1 tbsp sesame oil.  Excellent recipe thank you!

Great, easy recipe. Tasted very similar to what you would get in a restaurant. I added fresh white mushrooms to the recipe, because I love mushrooms with rice. The only change I would make next time is to use only 1 or 2 eggs instead of 3.

I give this 5 stars because the addition of the bacon makes this rice extra special!  I used rice that I had cooked previously with chicken broth and had frozen, and bacon grease because that's what I had on hand (no bacon, just grease)---the whole family loved it!  Thank you for the recipe.

This is a very good recipe.  I liked the bacon.  The only thing I changed was to use sesame oil for the last two tsp. of oil used.  I think that gives it a more authentic asian flavor.  I also cooked the rice the night before and refrigerated it, based on previous reviews.  This would also be good with chicken and mushrooms!

My husband and I have made this recipe several times.  We always cook the rice the day before and refidgerate it over night.  Next day we cook it up.  The bacon grease really flavors the rice. We love it!

The fried rice was decent, but not as good as I had hoped. I didn't like that the egg was in "chunks" in my rice. Next time I'll try cooking it like they do at Japanese steakhouses-put the egg in raw and cook until it's not shiny; then you can't see it.

I've made this recipe several times and my family always enjoys it. It's about as close as possible, IMO, that you can get to the actual flavor of the chinese restaurants. Definately a must-try recipe!

WOW, thanks for the great recipe.  I've been trying for years to make a great fried rice and the family says this is it.  Second time I added chopped celery and sliced mushrooms and it was even better, if possible.

This rice was great! Very easy and I modified a it a little bit- I used a fresh stir fry mix that I steamed and cut up and some little bay shrimp- and I passed on the bacon. This recipe was wonderful and the best part is that you can use anything you really have around to make it!! Thanks a lot!

Wow. I really didn’t expect this to turn out as flavorful and the right kind of flavor for fried rice as it did. I didn’t have peas so had to do without but followed the rest exactly and it was just so darn good! A little soy on top when serving and this was perfect. Light, not heavy or greasy and good flavor.

This was EXCELLENT!  Only recommendation....Ive seen other recipes that call for rice to be cooked ahead of time so it is cold when added to pan. I had some on hand and it was perfect. Rice was not clumpy and sticky. Family gobbled this up.

The only reason I did not give it five stars, I made suggested changes that other reviewers recommended. 
1. Add the eggs (only two) toward the end, mixing till they were no longer clear.
2. I substituted Jasmine rice for the white. AWESOME! 
My husband's request, make the bacon pieces larger.

Really good basic fried rice. The bacon adds really nice flavor. Added chicken so it could be a main dish, which worked well with the bacon. Think I didn’t cook on high enough heat, wish my rice got a little more “fried”. Added eggs at the end like one reviewer suggested, but then it just mixed in and coated the rice, you couldn’t see that any egg was in there. I prefer to have the pieces of egg. Next time will cook eggs first then add in as recipe calls for. Really easy to add or subtract ingredients as you like.

We like the recipe but I follow the instruction on the package of rice for cooking which requires about a cup more of water.  Can't imagine cooking rice with only one third cup more water than the amount of rice?!  Less soy sauce that others also mentioned and I cook the egg right in with the rice.  Turned out good

This is a good recipe for fried rice. I've made it multiple time. I do cook the rice ahead of time and cool it, because it makes it easier to mix while frying. I've made lots of variations of ingredients, based on what I have in the house at the time, and it comes out great every time.

Quick, easy, and delicious. I made my rice ahead of time and put it all together when it was time to make dinner. I didn’t have peas or the onion, but the rice still came out tasting amazing! I served this with a slow cooker sesame chicken and my husband and 5 year old son gobbled it down.

i love this recipe! I am vegetarian and my husband is Celiac so going out for Chinese food is difficult. i naturally skip the bacon and use gluten free soya sauce. i prefer this method of cooking the egg separately from the rice so you get nice chunks. i use frozen mixed vegetables instead of just peas. tastes just like takeout but i know what's in it.

In all fairness, I didn't make this recipe as stated.  I hate it when people change the recipe all up then rate it on one end of the scale or the other.  That being said, this was a great reference recipe and I'm so thankful I found it :)  To start, I thought I had rice in the pantry but that was a big ol fail... so the only rice I had was a Knorr Chicken and Broccoli rice packet, so I thought what the heck.  I cooked that first then let it cool down/dry out while I sauteed my veggies.  I did onion, carrot, water chestnuts, and peas... then crumbled bacon, then added 3 eggs to it and scrambled them instead of how the directions state, added the rice, then the rest of the ingredients and it turned out really really well.  The flavors melded together great and it was perfect under the baked chicken teriyaki recipe on here.  I will definitely make this again, and might even follow the recipe :)  I was really after a white rice base, but need to pay more attention to my pantry supplies first I guess...  Thanks!

I really liked it. Cooked the rice the night before. I  didn't use bacon but added 2 eggs per person. I replaced the green onion by leeks. Very good taste. Should optimize the amount of soy sauce next time as I ended adding a little too much.

I made this three times in 2 weeks! I about doubled the soy sauce (we use low sodium) and it's absolutely addictive!

Made this for my husband and son. They said it's good! Both said they really liked the bacon in it. One of them said it was too heavy on the soy sauce. The other said the eggs should have been stirred in and cooked that way. Also they would have preferred shrimp or chicken in it. The rice really should be pre-cooked and refrigerated ahead of time so it's not mushy by the time everything is added and fried. Will make again with changes.

This turned out pretty good. I didn't put the bacon in it, instead I cut up some steak in its place. Once I did that, I did have to add more soy sauce to mix it up. Overall good!

I paired this with a recipe called "teriyaki drumettes" and used that sauce to flavor the rice. EXCELLENT, and easier than I expected.

As written, I give it 4 stars. With some tweaking (including fewer peas & adding other ingredients), it ended up being a family favorite.

I didn't use bacon, but did use some leftover bacon grease instead of oil, that was yummy! I made a well in the center of the fried rice mixture near the end & cooked the eggs that way, then reincorporated them back into the fried rice. I sautéed green onions plus some yellow onions for the very first step, then added cold, leftover rice next.  I saved some fresh green onions to sprinkle on top. Great recipe that can be modified easily to your own personal tastes!

I made the recipe but doubled the soy sauce and added 1 whole carrot chopped. I also skipped the bacon altogether. Also, accidentally used 13oz of peas instead of 10oz, which was a bit much; still, it came out delicious!

I'll definitely make it again!  Kids and husband loved it!  I made a few changes, because I couldn't find the exact recipe I wanted.... only added 1/4 bag of peas, used fresh ginger, one peeled and chopped carrot and had only one cup of uncooked rice.  Instead of bacon I used a left over pork chop.  Definitely a great recipe to have fun with!

I didn't have any squash, so I used broccoli, also I used wild rice.
An amazingly tasty dish!!  I loved the addition of bacon!!
Although I believe that when a dish is served, it should be tasted first before adding anything, the same with recipes.   We'll, ya' gotta use what's on hand.
Thanks Allrecipes.com and contributing cooks.  
The reviews and additions or subtraction are so helpful and makes this site amazing, especially for someone like me who can cook simple recipes, yet strives to expand my horizons.

This was a very good meal.  Only difference I made was steaming peas separately and adding them at the end.  Next time I will also add more green onion, but that just might be me.

My boys loves this! Be sure to completely cool the rice before using. It taste like authentic hibachi rice.

Enjoyed it, but substituted celery for peas. Sauteed onions and celery while cooking turkey bacon, yum!

This really is a wonderful fried rice, and bacon for protein means that this dish goes with absolutely everything. This dish can also stand on its own for lunch. Made as directed with no substitutions.

I omitted the bacon and made it vegetarian.  I added some butter while frying the rice and some minced garlic to add more flavor.
We didn't miss the bacon at all. Husband and children liked it.

I made this tonight and it was awesome, although I have to admit, I did tweek it a bit. I used way more rice, family of 4 (3 of which are men), way less soy sauce, added oyster sauce for added flavor, shredded carrots, sesame oil instead of vegetable oil and I added cooked chicken to mine. SUPERB!!! Oh, I also fried my eggs in the rice instead of egg strips. The bacon was an added yummy :)  I will be making this on a more regular basis!

I loved it but I made a few change to my liking. I sautéed onions and carrots in the bacon fat before cooking my egg instead of using green onions. I didn't have the patience to let my rice get cold like others reviews said and just mixed it in hot. It turned out great! For those who said they didn't use bacon, that's what makes it taste so good!!

I made as directed, except I cooked the rice ahead of time and use cold rice. I also added the eggs at the end, moved the rice to one half of the skillet and the other half I scrambled the eggs. When the eggs were done I mixed together. It just needed something flavor-wise so I added ground ginger that I had and that made it much better. It's a great recipe.

This is a great, quick recipe. I cooked the bacon, then cracked an egg into the pan and stirred in pre-cooked & frozen rice. Then I added olive oil, soy sauce, yellow pepper, steamed carrots, peas, shallots, green onion, samba sauce, cinnamon & pepper. Flavors mixed nicely and everything was evenly coated in oil. Yum!!

This was wonderful! I eyeball everything when I cook but I stayed pretty close to the recipe. I cooked fresh rice and added the oil and the soy sauce and fried the rice in that. I added a bag of mixed frozen veggies (that I cooked in the microwave first) and added diced cooked chicken (omitted the bacon) Then I sauteed mushrooms in a separate pan and added it at the end with the eggs. Not mushy at all and everyone loved it!

I wish I would have known about this recipe a long time ago. It is amazingly delicious! My kids don't like pass so the veggies I use are carrots, celery and corn. I use fresh ingredients so it is best to saute them a bit before mixing them into the rice. I also put a little more soy sauce than the recipe calls for. I use low sodium soy though so I'm not sure if that makes a difference. I have made this for pot lucks and everyone raved about it. I definitely recommend making this.

The recipe was an easy one to follow. As a tip though, I made everything separate (the eggs, veggies, and the chicken- I added chicken, all separated). Then I made took the cold cooked white rice and fried it up. I then mixed it all in a bowl. It came out wonderful!

I used chicken instead of bacon and added extra carrots, peas and pea pods. Chilling the rice beforehand and using a teaspoon of rice vinegar, sesame oil and veg. Oil to sauté is a game changer. This is the first time I tried this recipe and my husband said it was restaurant quality. Score one for mom!

I've been making this recipe for a couple of years now.. kids love it! make it with the teryaki chicken thighs from this app too.. followed the recipe to the letter to start but have found some ways to short cut. I use the ten minute boil in rice bags, I microwave the bacon (I keep a stash of bacon grease in my fridge for eggs, so I make sure to use that!) and I use coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. saves a lot of time and mess! love this recipe!

Excellent base recipe, but here is how to make it DELICIOUS!!! So I followed the original recipe for the most part.But did make these few awesome changes IMO! heehee. I  decided to not use the bacon( just trying to cut back on the fat protein for the day) I cooked my white rice, (rice bowl from ALDI) and also used the JUMBO shrimp from  ALDI. while the rice cooked I fried up the egg, set it aside then used sesame oil about (3 teaspoons) and tossed in the onion, and a bag of steam-fresh "California style " Protein Blends grains,lentils,peas, broccoli and edamame. Then tossed in the 1/2 bag of  thawed  Jumbo shrimp and let cook until it kind of thickened.  Now that teh rice is done, add rice and toss together. Then here is where it went from Good to DELICIOUS! I thought it needed something more, once I added the soy sauce. So I decided to make a little mixture- 2 tablespoons of honey and 1-2 of soy sauce and whisk it together taste it! ( it depends on your own idea of "perfect" as to the  ratio) to make a sweet & sour sauce. I pored that over all the ingredients and  stirred it together - DELICIOUS!! Bon Appetit ya'll :)

My only substitute was to use brown basmati rice. Otherwise, I followed this recipe exactly including refrigerating the rice before frying. It was mushy and flavorless.  Most of it was thrown out as none of my family was interested in eating it after trying it at dinner.

This was a very easy dish to make considering it was my first time making fried rice. My wife and son absolutely loved it. The only thing I would omit is the soy sauce. It was a bit salty (even for my palate, and I love salt). Each person can add their own soy sauce as needed. I used chopped chicken in mine. Would definitely make this again and might even consider using quinoa instead of rice for a different twist. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this tonight for the first time, I used veggies that I already had, fresh green beans, ( cut small), sweet peppers mixed color, and onions. I made the beacon but I did not use it just the grease because I pared it with chicken stir fry and thought it might be to much. The beacon grease did give it a unique taste. Great way to hide veggies from the kids, my 3 yr old loved it.

Great base recipe to start with and good instruction with the egg.  I used to add the egg uncooked to the rice and it didn't turn out as well.  Everyone loved it in my house.  I did not, and likely won't, use the bacon.  I prefer diced ham.  I plan to make this again and again.  Thank you!

Great recipe. I substituted  brown rice and cooked my veggies apart( didnt have bacon). Great recipe especially if it's your first time cooking fried rice. Thank you so much! Two thumbs up!!!

Ps. Refrigerated rice is a must so rice doesn't get mushy!

I doubled the soy sauce and then shook in a couple extra drops!  With 1/8 the rice was practically still white, i would be anxious to see other peoples thoughts regarding the soy sauce amount.

This dish came out so good that leftovers were non existent. There is a technical mistake in the recipe and the rice should be cooked in advanced and chilled so it's not mushy. A few changes were made such as leaving the peas out since we don't like peas and adding fresh chopped garlic, brown onion, carrot, and Roma tomato. I cooked the garlic, carrot and brown onion in the soy sauce and oils before adding the rice and tomato.   
I also cooked the eggs at the very end by putting the raw eggs with the rice and mixed until the dish was no longer shiny.

Really Good!! I didn't use bacon and made a couple of changes.  Instead of using vegetable oil, I used peanut oil. I added red pepper and a can of sliced carrots.  The recipe is easy to make and is full of flavor.  Will try it next time with bacon but the peanut oil was a good trade off too.  It complimented the Campbell's Skillet - Sweet and Sour Chicken nicely.  Thank you.

Pretty awesome.  Made as recipe calls for, just made more of it at once.  In retrospect, probably not a great idea for the first time.  Also, my egg burned due to 1year old wanting to monopolize my time.  However I am convinced that if these circumstances not been present then my results would have been even better.  As it was they were great. Will be using this again repeatedly.  Two thumbs up!!

First this is sooo easy to make.  I had it completed in no time.  Served it with teriyaki chicken and it was a quick, decent meal.  My boys ate every bit of it and one son went back for more.  I thought it was just okay.  I tasted it while still in the pan and thought it was very bland.  I added some ground ginger and garlic powder before serving which sparked it up a little bit.  Next time, I'll add carrots and peas.  It lacked color too.  I think it's worth keeping with some tweaking.

This Fried Rice is really good.
I also put some broccoli inside and it tasted really good.
A salad as a sidedish is also good with it.

I had forgotten to take meat out of the freezer for dinner today, but had bacon in the fridge.  I found this recipe via ingredient search using bacon and rice.  

Since I am a lacto-ovo vegetarian, and the rest of my family isn't, I try to make recipes that I can make without the meat, and just add it in after my portion is removed.  This one worked perfectly in that respect!  What I did different: Used ~5tb EVOO in place of the bacon drippings, used a pack of peas and pearl onions I had in the freezer, omitted the green onions as I didn't have them on hand, and lastly, waited until I had mine out to stir in the cooked bacon.  It came out pretty good.  My husband loved it, and wants it again soon.  It worked out nicely for my vegetarian needs, and tasted better than so-so, but not amazing.  Because of the 2 main factors (husband, and veg accomodating) I give it a 5 star rating.

Thanks for getting me out of my dinner bind tonight!!!

This was fabulous!  I've never made fried rice before but per reviews, I used cold rice I'd made earlier in the day and added some leftover steak cut in thin slices.  I did not however, cook in bacon grease which I know would've been excellent, but just used a couple tablespoons of peanut oil instead to save calories.  Very flavorful and I thought it was the perfect amount of soy sauce, thanks!

This was good. I omitted the bacon, and took other reviewers suggestions on cooking the rice, and refrigerating it for a few hours. I agree with others that it's much easier when the rice is cold. Thanx for sharing!

I just made it and it came out really good. I used 7 bacons, added in 1/4 C of cooked shredded chicken (leftovers) and didn't need to add the extra 2 tsp of oil. I also drizzled in a tsp of worchestershire sauce, and 2 TBSP of chopped celery and hmmm... it's really nummy.

The bacon in this recipe was awesome - I just added a frozen veggie mix instead of peas, and shredded the eggs after scrambling them.   I think this is better than take-out!

I liked this recipe, but I have to give it four stars because it seemed too salty for me.  I'll make it again, but this time I'll cut the peas in half and maybe add in some corn.  I'll also leave out the salt and pepper in the eggs because the soy sauce and bacon have plenty of salt to make up for it.

I thought that this was a really good recipe. The bacon added great flavor and crunch. I served it last night for dinner and there was none left at the end, to me that means the recipe is a keeper! Thankyou very much for the recipe.

This is a good way to use up leftover rice, but I wouldn't go out of my way to make this again.  I subsituted chicken for the bacon and I added some fried rice seasoning, but it was still missing something.  Boyfriend loved it.
