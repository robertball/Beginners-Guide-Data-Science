These tasted exactly as they should - sweet and sour... perfect.  In order for the sauce to thicken you need to make sure that the liquid comes to a boil; then reduce and simmer for a few minutes.  Cornstarch requires the boiling point to activate as a thickener.

Thanks for this!

Very good recipe. To use fresh beets, leave whole with 1-2" of top stems attached. Cover with water and simmer until tender (30-40min for 2" beets). Drain and cover with cold water until cool enough to handle; then simply rub the skins off. If skins are stubborn, scrape off with blunt edge of plastic knife. Then proceed with recipe, adding water as needed to adjust taste. May add 1-2 tbsp. butter after completion if desired.

Have been looking for a beet recipe that tasted like my grandmother's and mother's.  Bingo!  This was just wonderful and brought back many wonderful memories.  Because I've been watching the carbs I used Splenda instead of sugar and added about 1 T. of butter to make the sauce glossy.  It still tasted great without using real sugar. Thank you so much.

I like beets almost any way they're made, but I'd never heard of this - I get the feeling it's a classic recipe. I measured out the exact quantity of beets, since I didn't have cans of the given size. My sauce didn't thicken either (well, maybe a tiny bit). From the reviews, I gather that maybe the sauce should be quite a bit thicker than I obtained. I noted one reviewer's tips on this, and I'll follow them if/when I make this again. That said, the sauce was very tasty - a mildly sweet/sour syrup that accompanied the beets very nicely - a kind of new-and-improved beet juice. Thanks for a nice side dish - I'll put it into my recipe box.

I used more cornstarch than listed - I think the sauce should be very thick and cling to the beets - almost like a thick cheese sauce would to pasta. I also will use a bit less vinegar next time - the ratio to sugar seemed a bit off - the sweet should be the primary taste, then the vinegar - not the other way around.  When it is done - but before it cools - I add some butter - gives it more depth.  Thanks for listing this recipe - my old early 80's Montgomery Ward Microwave cookbook that I always fixed Harvard Beets from is packed away!  Also - I hated to throw away all the extra sauce from this dish - so I combined it with a bunch of other ingredients and made a bbq sauce to bake my country style ribs in!

It is very rare that I see fresh beets in my area. so when I do, I snatch them up for borscht and harvard style beets.  I will not used canned -- they are anemic and have no flavour.  I use two parts sugar to one part apple cider vinegar, a teaspoon of salt and a 1/2 teaspoon of dillweed, and cook until the roots are tender.  I cool, add 2 tsp of cornstarch, mix in without lumps, and then reheat until the brilliant red sauce is as thick as Mamma's strawberry pie filling.

Tasted fine, but nothing out of this world.  Thought syrup would be somewhat thick, but didn't turn out that way.  May try again using a little more thickening.

This recipe was good, but too much vinegar for me.  The harvard beets I remember from childhood were a little less tart than these.  Having said that, I will say that my husband really liked them and I liked how easy they were to fix.  Next time, though, I'm going to cut the vinegar down to 1/3 or even 1/4 cup.  Thank you for this recipe!

Perfect seasoning. I used 1/4 cup of sugar and 6 Tablespoons of cider vinegar and about half of the beet juice with the tablespoon of cornstarch and no salt, it came out just as my family likes it.  Thanks for sharing.

Pretty good. 
Second round ...  Used fresh beets simmered in orange juice. 
Cider vinegar, a touch of mustard and thickened at the end with starch.  
Served topped with caramelized onions and goat cheese - pretty good turned fantastic.

I had some fresh beets to use and no idea what to do. I subbed apple cider vinegar for the white as another reviewer suggested, and tossed ingredients in without measuring b/c I only had a small amount of beets. And it was actually really good! I think it's important to use small baby beets though, with large beets there's no covering up that dirt-beet flavor.

I've never made Harvard Beets before, just heated them out of a jar.  These are very easy to make and taste great.  I would suggest two tablespoons of corn starch to make the sauce thicker so it clings to the beets.  I cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup because I like some zing to my Harvard Beets.  These are a really good change from "ordinary" vegetables.

My Papa has made these for years and this is my favorite way to eats beets.  The sweet with the tang is incredible. Husband doesn't eat beets so I freeze the leftovers in a container in a  single layer then use as needed. Yummy yummy!

This was great.  I needed a simple side dish for salmon, and found a can of beets in the cupboard.  A quick search on allrecipes, and voila!  Even picky husband enjoyed them.  I did reduce the sugar by just a tad.  Can't wait to try this recipe with fresh beets, which are a favorite.  Thanks!

This is a great recipe for beets. Nice sweet and sour sauce. I used fresh beets and "Grandma G" recommendation to cook fresh beets until tender then follow this recipe was very helpful. So was Reciplu suggestion to boil sauce to get the cornstarch to activate. Mine came out perfect. Love it when a recipe comes together.

Recipe is ok, but a bit sweet.  An easier method is to use bottled or home prepared pickled beets.  Use the juice, add two tbsp of cornstarch and I add a 1/4 cup of orange juice to add a bit of flavor.  Boil the above until thickened then add the beets and continue cooking until beets are at desired temperature.

Not bad for a basic recipe but needs some tweaking.  Needs a bit more cornstarch and a bit of butter.  I love Harvard beets and this recipe was ok ... just not the best I've ever made.

Mom made these when i was a kid! And that was more than 50 years ago . . . .
i added a little orange juice concentrate and a little butter.  Also increased cornstarch, per others' reviews. Wonderful!

7.5.18  For our tastes, I knew 3/4 cup white sugar would be too much, so I reduced that to 1/3 cup which worked out fine..  Beets are not my husband's favorite,  although he loves golden beets (go figure?), but I like them, so it's a compromise he can occasionally make.  Pretty standard flavor for this side dish, and that's not a bad thing.

Very good beet recipe, I will use it again and again. I did however use two tablespoons of cornstarch. As 1 reviewer stated, you need the beet juice to boil in order for the cornstarch to thicken and it does not thicken right away it takes a few minutes and stir frequently. The amount of cornstarch you use depends on the desired thickness.

Loved it!  Did use melted butter to made a cream out of the corn starch then stirred in the other liquids, be sure to let it come to a boil while stirring to get the corn starch to thicken.  Delicious!

Made it for my 90 year old mother, she also loved it!  Thanks for posting!

Great recipe!  I wasn't sure if I even liked beets when I bought a bunch at the farmer's market...I thought I would give them a try.  I do like them when prepared this way!  Other beet lovers raved over this.  I couldn't get the sauce to thicken up. I even let it boil for a bit and that didn't help.  I thought maybe once it cooled it would thicken up, but not so.

I chose this recipe as the one to use for fixing beets for the first time and introducing them to my 3 year old daughter.  I thought they were wonderful, but they were a bit too sour for her so I'll reduce the vinegar a bit from now on.

My mother's recipe was simple and delicious.  She made the best Harvard beets.  I use the recipe to can a whole garden of beets.  She used equal parts beet juice, vinegar, and sugar.  The beets were cleaned and cooked and the peelings removed.  The juice from the beets, plus  sugar, and vinegar were measured equally and mixed.  Beets were sliced and popped into jars with juice poured leaving 1" room at the top.  Save juice in case you need more.  Can as directed.  These are THE BEST.  Someone once gave my mother $20 to can a bunch of beets from the store.  Worth every penny!

Very good!  The only change I made was to use splenda (actually it was the sugar blend) in place of the sugar.  This is a super simple and quick side dish.  I will make this again.

I really did not like this. I am not much of a beet fan so my opinion is probably not the best. My husband said that he "kind of liked it". My toddler let it touch his tongue and spit it out. I am giving it three stars since one liked it and because it was easy. My sauce did not thicken very much.

Yummy!  This is exactly what I was looking for.  I've always loved beets anyway, but these were just the right sweet/sour combination.  My sauce didn't thicken either, a little more cornstarch would take care of that.  I also used the little tiny whole beets instead of the slices and added about 1 Tbsp. of butter right before I put the beets in the sauce.  They were so good, Thanks for this recipe!

This was excellent!  My father asked for more the moment he tried it and he isn't a veggie kind of guy.  I did heed the other reviewers re: boiling before simmering.  It took a little longer than recommended timeto have the consistency I wanted, but delicious and easy anyway.

Tastes just like my mom makes but it didn't thicken up at all.  Maybe my can of beets had more juice than average...I had to add extra cornstarch.

Bought a package of cleaned ready-to-go beets from Trader Joe’s (in their refrigerated section) and followed this recipe, adding a little butter right before serving them.  So good! Hubby loved them.

So simple and quick!  I used fresh beets.  I had bought a bag of beets (about 12 - 14 in the bag) pre-cooked them in my Instant Pot using the pressure (it took 45 mins. to cook them) and then made the sauce and added about 6 beets cut up to the thickened  sauce.

I've made this recipe several times and today, used arrowroot instead of cornstarch. Delish. The sauce seems to be a bit smoother and richer, warm. Can't wait to taste after refrigeration.

I roast beets whole skin, root and 1/2" of greens still on. Wash em good, wrap tight in foil and roast 50 minutes at 400. Rets in foil for 45 minutes, cut off top and root. Use paper towel to wipe skin off. Then slice a you want for the recipe. A roasted beet has much more sweet flavor, nutrients and it's own juice.

I also added a pinch of Chipolte Powder for a little spice

My grandma used to make these a lot for us for the holidays, and now my family's addicted! 
My edits: I ended up baking them, as opposed to boiling them, for 1 hour at 400 degrees, covered, before peeling. For 6 beets, I found that I needed to triple the recipe so make of that what you will. I also used brown sugar for one-third of the sugar I needed, and it had a wonderful homestyle flavor!

My mom requested Harvard beets for Thanksgiving so I found this recipe and this was delicious!  I will certainly make it again. So very easy to put together and simply simmer until everything else is ready. We loved it!  Thanks for a great recipe-Don't change a thing (except to maybe double or triple it) !!

Pretty good. Used brown sugar instead, as well as balsamic vinegar as I didn't have any white handy, same with flour for the corn starch (ratio of 3 TBS of flour for every 1 TBS of cornstarch).

This is a fabulous recipe - BUT - I did NOT use near the vinegar in my recipe!!!  I put in 1 - 1/2 Tblsp apple cider vinegar, and the sugar and it was absolutely wonderful!  I wanted a vegetable  "side dish" and not pickles, so much less vinegar!  But - YES - loved the dish!!!

This was so yummy, I felt guilty eating it because surely, this dish could not be good for us!  I used  Apple Cider Vinegar and Splenda for the vinegar and sugar.  I mixed the corn starch with water to the consistency I liked (thick) and added that to the cooking beets.  I also added a tablespoon of butter, as another reviewer suggested, and I omitted the salt.  One note:  Although this dish was amazing, I will add less sweetener the next time I make it.  I think it will be just as amazing with less sweetener.

Quick, easy and delicious.  I like that it uses the liquid from the canned beets.  I used 1/3 cup sugar - I like things tart and have to watch the sugar intake.

Use fresh beets. 8 beets. Cook covered in boiling water for 40-50 minutes. Drain reserving 1/3 cup liquid. Cool beets slightly. Slip skins off and slice. Stir in beets after recipe above done using reserved beet juice

I was searching for something new to do with beets and stumbled across this old Betty Crocker recipe!  It is delicious.  My mother had it in her "New Dinner for Two" cookbook (wedding gift).  She increased the recipe for more as the family grew, and now I make it for my family.  Maybe I will just stick to the classic.  Thank you!

Love em! Thank you. Just the right amount of vinegar & sugar.
I started out using 1/2 of the amounts of vinegar and sugar just for taste test. I ended up using this exact recipe, wonderful!
I added about 1/2 teaspoon more of corn starch.
We love this as a side dish with beef stew  or hash.
Thanks  again!

Perfect! Very simple to make. I boiled fresh beets from my garden, so the liquid was hot when adding in the other ingredients. Just a reminder to dissolve the cornstarch in a little bit of water before adding it to hot liquids. It gets clumpy if you don't.

I used fresh beets and had a little more juice than a 16 oz can would have had so I had to adjust the recipe.  I'm  very pleased with the results.

Almost exactly like the jar of Harvard beets I've bought at the store but much cheaper. I've made this several times as written. Absolutely delicious!

I made this recipe for the first time last evening.  I used roasted, fresh beets, to which I followed the recipe with the exception that I used Agave to sweeten.  We don't use white sugar.  And, as a reviewer suggested, I added a tablespoon of butter prior to serving.  My husband told me they were the best beets that he has ever had.  Needless to say, this recipe is written in ink for future use!

I used fresh beets, and it was the first time I ever cooked with them. Mine were fairly large, so I simmered them for just over an hour, then placed them in cold water; the skin peeled off easily with a dull knife. I wasn't sure if I should save the liquid they boiled in; I didn't and it all worked out in the end. I just added the rest of the ingredients to a saucepan (dissolving the cornstarch in a little water) and then added the beets that I sliced. Let it cook a minute or two. It produced a nice, thick sauce, and the beets absorbed it. Just what I was hoping for. I already made the Honey Beet Salad from this site, which I highly recommend. Thanks for the great recipe,  Shearyah!

I love beets and they are so good for you. This was so quick and easy. The only change I made, since I'm off sugar, is that I substituted about 1/3  cup honey instead of sugar. At the end I did add a pat of butter. Sooo good!! Thanks for sharing.

Delicious, even my 1 & 2 year old boys eat these.  No modifications needed.  I plan to attempt to make these with fresh beets this coming summer.

I used fresh roasted beets and added a cup of water to make up for the juice from the can. Some others commented that they thought this should be sweeter, but I loved the sharp hit of vinegar that hits your nose as you bring the beets close to your face. This tasted just like my mom's. Following another reviewer's suggestion, I brought the sauce to a full boil and let it thicken up. It stuck to the beets well. Using cider vinegar seem like it would be yummy, too! I might try that next.

was looking for a recipe for canned beets because that was all I had in the pantry.  Was very yummy!  Never had beets as a side for dinner but will from now on! Would cut down on the sugar just a little bit.

I had a microwave Harvard Beets recipe, but I thought I would give this one a go...easy, and delicious...I used some fresh frozen beets, simmered in about a half cup of water till thawed....added the remaining ingredients, and threw in a tablespoon of butter to make them glossy, and they were exactly as I had hoped they would be....so delish....Im having the rest for a before-bed snack tonight!

This was a favorite dish of mine when I was a kid -- one of the few ways I would eat my vegetables. This recipe is very similar, except that it uses sugar where the old family recipe used corn starch. The flavor is great, but I've had trouble getting the sauce to thicken; I'll keep practicing until I get it right!
