Delicious!  I love this kind of pasta sauce--I love the bold flavors of the tomato, capers and olives, and I haven't found a puttanesca recipe I didn't like.  You have to like all of those flavors, though, or you'll end up with a dish you don't like.  And, it just wouldn't be the same without all of the flavors.  I will admit I didn't use the anchovies--I never have them; in fact, I've never bought them in my life and only tried them once.  I don't have any dislike of anchovies; just don't have them.  I used green olives with pimento since that is what I had, and didn't chop the capers. Yum!  My only comments are that you could put in the tomatoes undrained--you'd just have to cook longer--and you don't need that much oil.  I used just enough to coat the pan.  Thanks for the recipe!

Thank you for a wonderful recipe that is quick and easy to prepare, as well as bursting with flavor.  The only change I made was to serve this over fresh linguini pasta. This one is going into my recipe box!

I have made puttanesca for many many years and this is the first time I decided to look it up and go with a recipe. This was an incredible recipe.  Although I did add a seafood medley of shrimp, prawns and calamari. I also put the whole can of anchovies in and it was delicious. I love seafood so one last thing, after I added noodles and I was cooking the whole dish together, I put a small fillet of salmon over the top of the entire dish, just have something to munch on later, and wow did that add some great flavors to that fillet. I didn't eat the salmon with the pasta.

Superb as written! I had to separate out a portion prior to adding the anchovies as I am allergic to fish, but add them if you possibly can. They don't taste fishy. They just add a savory nuance that perks up the rest of the flavors in the dish. And that's the beauty of puttanesca! Because the sauce is so easy and comes together so fast, it's no trouble to set a portion aside before adding an ingredient that give some eaters trouble. I served it with whole wheat spaghetti and crushed red pepper on the side for those who like more heat. Keep the salad simple - sliced cucumbers are nice - and you can have dinner on the table within 20 min of walking through the door.

Loved this recipe!  I made it just as written, with whole grain linguini.  My husband had seconds and ate the leftovers before I had a chance.

Quick, easy, and full of flavor! And it just so happens it used things I commonly have in my pantry, minus the anchovies which I left out completely. You can easily adjust this to suit your tastes. I cut back on the oil and used Italian seasoned diced tomatoes and didn't bother draining them. I also added just a little tomato paste concentrate. I topped it with a little shredded Parmesan cheese before serving. This was so simple and went great with Baked Garlic Parmesan Chicken from this site, garlic bread, and of course a nice glass of wine!

Prepared basically as written -- added more garlic (I'm fearful of vampires), used 2 tins of diced tomatoes spiced with garlic, basil & oregano (undrained and cooked down).  But overall....wow...this is fantastic.  I'm single, so made the recipe as written and saved the leftovers for later (freezes well).  Oh yea...I did add some chopped fresh basil.  Great recipe if you're vegan (I'm not)...but is a great sauce for whatever pasta you desire (I did use lobster ravioli).  This is one recipe that uses basic "pantry-ready" items (other than anchovies (most will have to agree).  If you don't try this recipe, you're missing out on a fantastically easy pasta sauce that will pique your pallate.

This was good! I think it could definitely use more than 1/4 teaspoon of pepper flakes... and maybe more olives :)

I followed the recipe but didn't put in oregano.  It didn't need it. Put in a little extra garlic, anchovies, capers and olives. I also used linguini Easy to make and delicious. PS Of course a little "Reggiano" to finish it

I didn't have anchovies on hand, so I substituted about 1 tablespoon of fish sauce, and I didn't use capers because I HATE them. I used a mixture of green and kalamata olives, as well.  My husband (who frequently complains when I make pasta) LOVED it, and said the only thing he would change would be to add more olives.  I served it with spaghetti and baked chicken breasts, dredged in flour, egg, then a mixture of panko and parmesan cheese.  Super simple, and absolutely delicious!  This one is definitely going into the rotation.

I had puttanesca (linguini) at a nice italian restaurant in Miami!!! I wasn't in the mood for lasagna or spaghetti or even chicken Parmesan, I might not of been in the mood for italian cuisine that evening, but we went. I decided I wasn't in the mood, so I might as well try something different! I ordered linguini alla puttanesca. I got home and had to find a recipe and that I did!!!! This recipe is as close as you can get to the restaurant in Miami. They used black olives so I used them instead of kalamara olives! Love love it!!!!! It's a keepah!!!!!!!

This is a superb recipe!  Very easy. I did not have anchovies, so I substituted a tablespoon of Asian fish sauce for each anchovy, since that's what fish sauce is made from. Delicious! Adds that depth of flavor.

I always follow a recipe exactly the first time, otherwise I don’t believe a proper review can be made. I love Puttanesca and have made it many times over the years and the ingredient that makes this recipe stand out from the others, is the oregano!  It’s an addition that rounds out the Tuscan earthiness of the taste as a beautiful balance with the tartness created by the anchovies, capers and olives.

Made precisely the first time and it was very good and easy but  only 4 stars for me, had too many capers and not enough anchovies. Made again replacing the capers with sliced green olives and using the whole can of anchovies, I also used the oil in the can as part of the recipe oil called for. Excellent.  Thanks for the recipe!

This version is absolutely fantastic! The one tweak I did was to add a shallot, and to make it more of a main meal I added 1/2 lb of mild Italian sausage for the proportions stated in the base recipe.

this recipe is absolutely amazing......I added 1/2 diced each of red and yellow pepper and 12 cremini sliced mushrooms which were sautéed on their own and held back until the olives and the capers were added...also aded about 12 grape tomates sliced in half lengthwise when I added the diced tomatoes.     I  served this with poached pacific salmon and the two together were amazing. all the flavours together  play beautifully in our mouth...a glass of white wine adds the final touch..will definitely make again and again and again.

This was delicious, quick and easy! What's not to like? I followed the recipe almost exactly with a few minor tweaks. First, I used an immersion blender to blend one can of the tomatoes. This gave a bit more "substance" to the sauce. Also, we're anchovy fans, so I doubled the amount suggested. The extra anchovy did not impart a fishy taste at all. 

Thanks Julie, this one is going in my regular rotation!

Make it again and again. I am definitely doubling the recipe when I make it from now on.
I'm curious to know about any nutritional information. A lady named Linda, commented that she used whole grain pasta and her husband loved it.

I made it as is. I thought it was a little heavy on the oil, but OMG the flavor was intense and delicious. A decent spaghetti and a good red wine and we're good to go. Will make it again.

This was very good as is. I love capers and green olives. My son came for dinner and picked them all out. There is a lot of room for additions and/or substitutions. Will try pepperoni in it next time and eliminate the son. Not sure I can still call it Puttanesca.

It was really good flavor and so easy to make.  I did not have olives or capers so I didn't use them.  I also used less olive oil.  To increase protein and reduce carbs, I substituted spaghetti squash for the spaghetti and added a can of flaked tuna.  It was delicious.

Yum!  So much flavor!  We eat this often, even the kids like it.  I like to use a combination of kalamata, black olives, and green olives.

I added chicken because I like chicken. It didn't enhance the flavor or anything. It tasted amazing and it was really easy to make! I will definitely make it again!

Delicious dish! I halved this and used two tomatoes that I recently got at a farmer's market that needed to be used up soon. During the sauce simmer, I also added a splash of white wine and a tblsp of tomato paste. I would have added a little anchovy paste, but mine was outdated. To make this more saucy, I added about 1/2 cup of the pasta water which worked great. Nice bite with the red pepper flakes. If you like briny/salty, you'll like this.

This was so freaking delicious!!  My husband LOVED it!!!  I added italian sausage to make it more of a main dish.  I doubled the recipe and used two-28oz San Marzano whole peeled tomatoes and broke them up while cooking...the flavoring of these canned tomatoes can't be beat!   My husband can't stand anchovies...I snuck em in and he didn't even notice!!  Don't omit them, they really add a special kick to this dish!

This has become a family favorite.  I don't use anchovies or capers, so I add a bit more garlic and olives to make up for it. It's so yummy!

We were looking for a break from the Thanksgiving turkey & decided to give this a try. I didn't have anchovies, instead we added zucchini, yellow squash, & carrots. Next time I'll give it a try with the anchovies. But we thought it was great with just vegetables. The basic recipe lends itself to adding whatever you like.

This was a wonderful Puttanesca recipe! The only changes I made were 1) I added some sauteed shallots, onions and mushrooms, 2) I used three cans of diced tomatoes rather than two, 3) I used red wine instead of pasta water to adjust the thickness. In any case it was great and I'll make it again.

I'm not sure what others may have experienced, but when cooked the tomatoes and oil never really combined. A taste after 10 minutes of simmering revealed that the tomatoes were still really acidic. Simmered longer in the hopes that tomato flavor would mellow (it did) but the oil stayed on top. Every bite was just... oil. This either needs less oil or different directions. I'd just as soon toss some olives, capers, and pepper flakes into jarred pasta sauce.

I made this recipe this evening exactly as described. It was very easy to prepare and only took about an hour from start to finished plate.
The result was an absolutely scrumptious  Puttanesca worthy of a fine Italian restaurant menu. 
Pantry Puttanesca is a keeper. I look forward to making it again.

I love this recipe. I usually add extra diced tomatoes, basil, and a whole can of anchovies. Other than that exactly like the recipe. Add a tossed salad and bread and dinner is ready

I made this yesterday for lunch with a couple of friends. Left out anchovies as one of my friends is a vegetarian. It was so delicious! Topped with Parmesan.

Absolutely delicious!  Didn't change a thing about it.  Did forget to drain the tomatoes though, but just let it simmer longer.  I've never knowingly eaten anchovies before (other than in Worcestershire sauce), so wasn't sure how I'd like them.  Will start using them more.

This sauce is soooo good. I doubled the recipe and forgot to drain three of the four cans of tomatoes so I just let it simmer for several hours. This is my new favorite sauce!  I'll be making it again in double batches so I can freeze some.  If you are trying avoid the pasta try using spaghetti squash instead.

I made this recipe with friends and it worked great! We took out the anchovies because there was a vegetarian among us and it was still flavorful and delicious, so it's not just the anchovies that provide flavor. We also used fresh tomatoes, which made the whole thing feel and taste really fresh and homemade, so I'd definitely recommend that if you can. A great dish for a great evening!

A wonderful use of pantry staples.  Followed as written, other than increasing the hot pepper flakes to half a teaspoon.  Topped with Parmigiano-Reggiano and served with a tomato bocconcini salad.  Great.  Best of all, we have leftovers for tomorrow.

This absolutely delicious! I made it exactly as written and it was perfect. The amazing thing is how all the flavors come together. You don't specifically taste any of the ingredients (except maybe the olives depending on how small they're chopped), so to really get this right, you have to make it as written. My family (who normally turn their noses up to anchovies and capers) loved this!
