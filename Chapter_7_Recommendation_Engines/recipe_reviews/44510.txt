Finally I found a recipe that is similar to my mom's and not icky corn syrup in the ingredients.  A trick I learned over the years is not to mix the raisins & walnuts into the filling but to put a rounded tsp of raisins and 1/2 tsp of chopped walnuts directly into the tart shells.  Then I pour in the filling.  That way each tart has the same amount of fruit/nuts.

Oh...my....goodness!! Best buttertarts ever! I used 1/2 cup chopped pecans and 1/2 cup milk chocolate chips and they tasted just like the chocolate Turtles you buy at Christmas! Wow! Thanks for my new favorite buttertart recipe!

Just made these today and they are fabulous!  I didn't have pecans, so used some chopped up hazelnuts that I had around.  I also added a bit more raisins (about 1/4 cup).  They are VERY tasty and I'm super happy with them :D  I'll definitely be making more before Christmas :D

These butter tarts were outstanding!  I used some pre-made pie crust and molded it into muffin tins.  I replaced the pecans with chopped toasted coconut chips and I doubled the raisins.  The recipe made 24 mini tart-lettes and 8 bigger ones, with the tiniest bit of leftover 'batter'.  I was a little concerned that the bigger tarts weren't cooked enough, so next time I would cook them at 350 for about 25 minutes.  Even after sitting for 24hrs, the bigger tarts are quite runny when you bite into them.  Of course, some people might say that adds to their appeal!  Overall, a great recipe!  I might add a few mini chocolate chips to the next batch!
Update: I made a second (1/2) batch of these, adding a few chocolate chips, and using Tenderflake tart shells.  Baked at 350 for 20 minutes.  They could have used 2 extra minutes, but I kinda love the gooey middle :)

Haven't eaten them yet. I don't know how they are supposed to cook in 16 minutes. I had to put them back in. I think 400F for 20 minutes would be better. Also I had to increase the amount of raisins by half to get enough and then there was too much filling. This recipe needs some tweeking.

Found them to be a little too sweet, next time I will lower the amount of brown sugar.  Otherwise a very creamy buttertart.  I will make them again.

First time making butter tarts and these turned out great. What an easy receipe. I added chocolate chips and pecans to make turtle tarts and they were a hit at my Christmas party. I was asked to make another batch for a travel package. These are easy and taste great.
