Made this.  Used Trader Joe's White Pomegranate tea, it gave it a lovely red color.  Followed the recipe exactly except that I did not have a family sized tea bag so I just used four single-serve tea bags per family bag.

I am absolutely in love with this recipe. I got this recipe two days ago and I am already on my third batch. My husband and I love it so much! 

One thing that I think should be tweaked is the amount of sugar. I found that it was tasty without that whole cup of sugar! :) Feel free to add some additional cloves or cinnamon to give it some extra spiciness!

I had a different version (Tang) of this tea years ago and it was delicious. I had a few ingredients left after the holiday so I decided to try this version. Typically I like to make new recipes as written but it is altered as I use what I had on hand. I had a lot of instant green teas on hand so I used three different types: 4 Tazo green ginger tea, 4 Bigalow green tea with lemon, and 2 Lipton Mandarin orange green tea.  I used 12 ounces of orange juice concentrate and omitted the lemonade concentrate.  I did not have cinnamon sticks so I used ground cinnamon. I used a half a cup of sugar instead of one cup and still found it to be very sweet. I actually liked how it tastes prior to adding the sugar.  I also added extra cloves, allspice and cinnamon because I really love those flavors together. :). I garnished with a bit of lemon slice.  This was very tasty, it did not have the tart taste as I remembered from the Tang version, but I found this version more "fresh" in a sense. I loved it! It filled up 3 mason jars (gifts for family) after it cooled and I had a bit left over to pour into my blueberry lemonade in the fridge! yum!  I would surely make this again, using 1/4 c of sugar or none at all.

Loved it! I always squeeze fresh orange and lemon in my tea but the addition of the cloves and Allspice really added a lot to this tea. I'll be making this one again and again. Thank you Grandma!

Fixed this last night. Is great! One question.  Is it supposed to be 1 1/2 cups of water or 1 1/2 quarts of water?

I found this recipe when I had a cold and wanted something with juice and spices and I loved it! I made it again when I was having a cookie decorating party. And I’ve made it twice since. The only changes I made were using ground cloves since I didn’t have whole cloves and using a half a cup of sugar instead of a whole cup of sugar.?? I cook it in the instant pot on slow cooker to keep it warm because I like it best after the spices have had time to meld with the juice flavors. Thanks for sharing it! It is super Yum!

It’s so much like the recipe I fell in love with as a teen.

I used 1cup lemon flavored ice tea, instead of part plain tea. After I tasted a cup, the cloves were overpowering (it was a new bottle and pungent). So I added 1 extra teaspoon cinnamon and almost 50% more lemon tea, sugar and Tang. It’s sooo good!

I have made this a couple times and it is very good. One time I didn't have lemonade so I doubled up the oj concentrate, but that batch did not come out very good. So make sure you have both oj and lemonade.

It is wonderful. I used 3 family tea bags and 2 single green tea bags and 1 3/4 sugar.  It was perfect!  Will definitely make it again.

This tastes just like the one I remember from my teens. (I'm now a grandmother.) This was served at an afternoon "tea" for an organizational meeting I attended. The powdered form is good, but this is just so much better. Plus, your home will smell wonderful!

I love this version.  I usually make my own orange juice and lemon juice but the frozen juices work well. I am making this again today.  First  time I did use a total of 2 1/2 quarts of water.

I had this same one when I was a kid and sick. Warm  I just remember it as soothing and making me feel better.
