I (82 year old male) followed this recipe as printed, and turned out exactly as pictured.
My first time at biscuits and the flavor is sooo good.  PERFECT
I split the first one and place a chunk of cheddar cheese in between that melted.  OMG. 
Thanks for this easy & flavorful recipe.

Loved the recipe. Followed it almost exactly the first time except at 425 which works better at our altitude of 5000' and it was delicious. Wanted to see how it would be in a cast iron frying pan, 10" with butter melted on stove top and pan warmed up. It was terrific with a great crusty bottom. Again at 425 rather than the 450 called for. 
5 stars both times.

We loved these. They couldn't have been any easier to make and very short time from start to finish. Can't wait to try these with sausage gravy.

Awesome, pared with country sausage gravy! 1st time making biscuits. It was an easy recipe to following. Couple notes to remember....1. Its sticky dough so it won't pour out of the bowl, scrape and spread...I used a spatula. 2. When taken out of oven, let the biscuits rest 5 minutes after to allow butter to absorb. Deliciously buttery!

WOW!!!! These biscuits were amazing.  I need to double the recipe net time. I had a thought and I drizzled a little honey over the top. I swear to goodness they taste just like the biscuits  from Willie's Chicken in NOLA. Yummmy!!

I do not want to be rude but these were awful. 
I will not make these again. They were gooey and tasted “undone” after 30 minutes in a 450* oven.

These biscuits are so quick and delicious! I'm not one to take the time to roll out biscuits. These are a wonderful alternative! I have made them exactly as stated in the recipe and have also added garlic salt and shredded cheddar cheese for a variation of those cheddar biscuits at a popular seafood chain restaurant.  They are swimming in butter before you bake them and when they come out, but all of that deliciousness is absorbed into the biscuits within a few minutes. Yum! (garlic cheddar pictured)

It's really yummy!  Even though it seems like a lot of butter at first, the butterness in the end result is perfect.  Add your favorite jam or topping and you have a wonderful breakfast or dinner treat.  I Used gluten free flour and it turned out great.  Worth baking!!

This recipe is super easy and the biscuits were definitely buttery! I added shredded cheese to my first batch - next time around, I may add chives and/or garlic to make these a bit more interesting. CAUTION - be sure these are fully cooked. I pulled mine out of the oven at the given time because they "looked" done, but the center was uncooked and was just nasty when I went to cut the center piece!

I made this gluten free and it turned out great!  Most biscuit recipes end up dry and flat when using GF flour, but not this one.  I used a GF All-purpose blend with Xanthan gum included.  Since the pandemic started, I've made these at least three times.  They also freeze well, so I can eat what I want now and freeze the rest for later.

One note of caution - don't wait to bake them once the flour mix has been put into the butter.  If you do, the butter seeps through and makes the whole thing soggy.  If you can't bake right away, wait to put the dough in the melted butter bath until just before baking.

I followed the recipe almost exactly, and they came out alright. There’s none of the layered flakiness that I really love about biscuits where you painstakingly mix in slivers of cold butter. These biscuits are pretty cake-like and fluffy in texture. Also there’s a delicious butter flavor around the edges, but not so much in the middle of the biscuit! But they are quick and easy and the result is definitely a biscuit, so if you’re in a pinch for time, it’s not bad. I’m glad I tried out this recipe, but I think I’ll stick to traditional recipes going forward.

I have made these biscuits but the recipe I had used biscuit mix. They are truly delicious, but they are incredibly greasy--swimming in grease greasy. I cut back the 1/2 cup of butter to 1/4 cup. They are still delicious, and I may cut the butter back  a little again next time I make them.

I made this today.  Like some others, I reduced the butter and they came out just fine.  For the reviewer having problems with the ingredient amounts, Allrecipes will tell you that, even though you change the servings, and the ingredients adjust accordingly, the directions do not change.  You have to figure that out for yourself.

Because you don't have to work the dough except to mix the ingredients, these Butter Swim Biscuits come out very light and fluffy.  Can't wait to  make biscuits and gravy.

I have made this recipe for over 2 years for church pot luck, just to have at home,  for several weddings,  e.t.c.   They are delicious!  Eat hot or cold,  plain or with ANY topping (jelly, peanut butter, etc.)  Everyone asks for the recipe.  With a little less bearing and a very little less cook time I have been able to make them"falling apart tender".  LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!!

I made the recipe as is. I liked it, no doubt. However, this recipe does not uses the traditional biscuit dough technique so do not expect it to be so in texture in the final result. I found them dense and a bit on the gummy especially as they cooled off. They were fluffy though. The flavor was OK too. The outer layer browned nicely at the 25 minute mark. This recipe is good if you are in a pinch. Is not bad. Just if you like a true biscuit texture then go with the traditional method/recipe if you have mastered the mixing and the kneading part. I used dehydrated buttermilk which is a life savior. I baked my biscuits in a rectangular pan and I got 8 nice portions. Will be my go to recipe in a pinch!

I made these biscuits last night to have with dinner.  I changed AP flour to SR, so I skipped all other ingredients except the buttermilk and butter.   I used salted butter instead of unsalted.  They were wonderful.  I will definitely make these biscuits again, and again.  ??

This recipe was easy to execute and came out well. i will say that the biscuits came out a bit heavy but were soft and had good flavor.  I think 4tsp of baking powder is a bit much i will try again and decrease the baking powder. I will also try in a cast iron skillet. overall a good biscuit

I don't know why the recipe called for "no salt butter?" I made it with the salted butter and you cant tell the difference. I think they came out very well and I will do it again. Very fluffy and light and they dont stick to the bottom of the dish.

Not a review, but a question.  Is this recipe intended to be baked as one giant biscuit it and then cut in to squares or am I missing something?  I’m sure it would work all right, I have just never seen it done like this.

These were amazing! I used a #7 cast iron skillet, put the butter in the skillet (sliced but cold), and preheated the oven with the skillet/butter inside. When the oven came up to temp, I took the skillet out then continued the instructions. They weren't greasy, but were very tender with a slight crust on the top. YUM!!!

I followed the recipe exactly. It’s very easy! I was a bit worried when my “dough” was more on the batter side than doughy. I wanted to add more flour, but I didn’t since it’s the first time to make this. They didn’t need more flour after all! They aren’t “pretty” but I was using them as a base to pour gravy over, so appearance didn’t matter. They taste good and were relatively quick, so I am happy!

Yes I had to use powdered milk and 1 tsp. lemon juice to make buttermilk. Because I was out of regular milk,  but the biscuits turned out delicious.  I will definitely make the biscuits again. Shared the receipe with my daughter.

I cooked mine in a cast iron skillet.I put the butter in the skillet and the skillet in the oven while the oven preheated.  I didn’t have enough buttermilk so I used sour cream for the remainder of the buttermilk.  The bottom crust was very crunchy which I liked.  The only thing that was missing was sausage gravy!!   The person who said the dough was crumbly must not have used the correct amount of buttermilk it used too much flour.  The dough was perfect!

They were not as good as I expected. I did cut the butter in half. I also didn’t have buttermilk so I used regular milk with a little vinegar. They were kind of dense and tasted underdone after 35 minutes in a 425 degree oven. My oven tends to cook hotter so I adjusted the heat. I probably won’t make them again.

I rarely write reviews, but I just had to with this one. I wish I read the reviews before I made it. I would have NOT put in the 4 tsp of baking powder. People are right - it's too much! It leaves this distinct bitter taste in your mouth even after drowning it in jam. I tried to love it. It's really not a biscuit - cakey. Followed the recipe exactly as is.

I made these a few weeks ago and followed the recipe exactly. They were delicious! Today, I made them again, but in a cast iron pan and I added some Old Bay seasoning and cheddar cheese. Came out great again and so yummy.

I didn’t realize I had to put the butter in the bottom of the pan and instead mixed it in. It only took 14 minutes to bake and tasted amazing. I didn’t have buttermilk so used 1/8 cup vinegar and the ready

These were absolutely fabulous!!!  I made two batches because I needed to use my buttermilk.  They are sticky but do not be afraid to get your hands right in there. I stayed with recipe as written.  You will not be disappointed!!!

These were so good and super easy to make. They had more flavor than I expected they would based on the few ingredients. Based on other reviews, I did cut the butter in half, which was perfect.

I thought it was excellent - had to cook longer than called for but waited for toothpick to come out clean and tops browned - maybe additional 10 or 15 mins - not insubstantial! It isn’t much different in butter than normal biscuits anyway so didn’t feel overly buttery. I don’t see the need to divide them with scraper because the dough just runs together anyway. Taste is very much like KFC biscuits but moister and more fluffy. Going to add more sugar and try with strawberry topping next.

These baked up so pretty, with a flaky golden-brown crust, nice depth, and cooked within the expected 25 minutes. That said, in spite of how pretty they were I just didn't like them. There's no flavor other than butter, and given they floated on top of 1/4 pound of melted butter, I thought that was just way too much. They're missing something: adding more sugar might be good, as a dessert shortcake or bread pudding(?). Maybe fresh dill, as a savory or garlic for pull apart knots(?). I don't know what's missing, but I doubt I will make them again as instructed. As an aside, being an inexperienced cook, necessity made me  brave enough to experiment and create my own buttermilk from whipping cream and white vinegar. I was rather happy with the way THAT turned out- I mean really, how hard could that part be?  But all in all, I didn't really care for them. Too greasy, heavy, and bland.

I made this recipe in an iron skillet, following the suggestions of other reviews. Otherwise, made as instructed. The biscuits came out great! The only adjustment I made was to cover the skillet with aluminum foil, about 15 minutes in, because it was browning too fast. I baked it for 25 minutes, tested with toothpicks in a couple spots, it was perfectly done, crispy outside, light & fluffy inside. This is a keeper.

I made this twice, once with unsalted butter per the way it is written, the second time with salted butter.  My family and I all enjoyed it better with the salted butter.

I was taken by the title! As one who loves to bake (and who doesn’t love a biscuit) it was a “must try.” My husband and I just had a taste as they were warm from the oven...a recipe I will enjoy finding ways to use and elaborate on...and so easy...thank you!

the first time I made them I made them like the recipe said they were alright nice on the outside a little spongy on the inside could you use a half a teaspoon more of salt, so the next batch I took half the melted butter and mixed the flower and added half teaspoon of salt baked at 20 minutes they came out great

Great recipe, the biscuits had a nice crust and were soft on the inside.  I followed the recipe exactly on the first round and for the second I used self-rising flour in lieu of the all purpose, baking powder, salt &sugar.  The family liked the second batch much better.
