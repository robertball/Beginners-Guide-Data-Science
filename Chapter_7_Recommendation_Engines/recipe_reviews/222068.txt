I thought the combination of raspberry liquer (I used Chambord) and beer sounded strange and outside the box, but I thought let’s give it a try.  Neither dominated in this cocktail, and the traditional lime margarita flavor definitely came through.  It does look a little “unmargarita-like” because of its pinkish color, and the guys first said they didn’t care for it,  BUT, I saw them go back for a second round.  This is a good margarita!
