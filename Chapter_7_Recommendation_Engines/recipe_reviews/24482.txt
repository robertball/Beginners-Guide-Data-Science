If you're looking for a very strong rum taste this is good, however the exact recipe is way too strong, rum is all you taste.

The recipe is good, however, if the evaporated milk is substituted by a 14oz can of condensed milk, the result will be much better.

I agree with some of the others. This would really be great with less rum. I'll try it with less rum next time.

My mother made this with Spanish Hard Cider, I use Champagne instead of Rum and it's much smoother!!!  Great after a holiday dinner.

This turned out rich and creamy!  I made it for my husband who doesn't drink alcohol, so I didn't add the rum. I'm not sure if that changed the  recipe too much, but it was really, really sweet. I will try it again, but may use evaporated milk instead of sweetened condensed.

Just a little less rum would make this recipe almost perfect

OMG! This cr√®me de vie was so delicious.  It reminded me of Mami's and it was so easy to make. It will be on my table every "Noche Buena"!!  I highly recommend it.

I scaled the recipe to 1 serving and got exactly 3 shots. It was so good I drank one before I took a picture and before I chilled it. I used Captain Morgan Rum because that's what I had and it was sooo yummy! It did remind me of eggnog. I will be making this again. Thank you for the recipe.
