This is such an outstanding recipe, thanks so much to the cook who shared it. Over the past 45 years I have probably made hundreds of apple pies but this one is just a treat! I made it as written. The process and the iron Skillet is the key to the finished product being so good. I like cooking with Iron cookware so I was delighted to find this recipe.  You may want to adjust the amount of white sugar you put on the apples between the layers. I cut it in half because I just know how we like things. It is super sweet no matter how much you put between the layers because of the butter and brown sugar on the bottom. Just adjust to your own families taste but do make it. It is a wonderful pie.

For the life of me I cant understand why someone would rate a recipe and go on to say they havent made it yet. That defeats the entire purpose of the system. However, I DID actually make this apple pie exactly as written and it was fabulous! I wouldnt change a thing. Thank you!

OMG...didn't think this would be good since there is no flour to thicken but it's totally awesome.  Might spray the skillet with nonstick spray before melting butter.  bottom crust sticks really bad unless you serve it hot.

Awesome pie!  I took it to a construction day out at my cousin's place and the guys just gobbled it up!  I cut the sugar back (3/4 c. brown sugar on the bottom, and a scant 1/2 c. for the filling).  I also tossed my filling together rather than just sprinkling the sugar on top.  In the filling I added 2 T. flour and a sprinkle of nutmeg.  I was unable to serve this right away since I was taking out to the guys, so my pan was one sticky caked-on rock-hard mess!  To clean the cast iron, fill 3/4 with water, add a couple of squirts of DISHWASHER soap (not dish soap), and boil on the stove for 10-20 min.  Turn off and let sit overnight.  The gunk will slide right off the pan in the morning.

Super Easy to make and the taste is just Heaven.  I have a really good Apple Pie recipe and I really did not want to try this because my other recipe is so good I did not feel the need to change it.  Curiousty got the best of me after reading all the reviews and I figured why not?!?!  Well needless to say my son claims this apple pie is 10 times better than my usual apple pie...I did not even think it was possible to top my old recipe.  My husband was speechless after he tried it and later admitted it was the best pie he had ever tasted.  I finally gave in and tasted it myself and only one word can describe this....WOW!!!!  I will definetly be making this again.  Thanks for posting.  Word to the wise.  DON'T CHANGE A THING!  It's PERFECT as is :-)

I had problems with this recipe.  For starters, the bottom crust on mine welded itself to the bottom of the cast iron (all of my cast iron is seasoned VERY well!).  Also, the middle layer of crust did not cook all the way through and turned out mushy.  Lastly, this recipe could have used more apples easily.  In all fairness, I will say that the flavor of the apple filling was incredible!  To those considering this recipe, I would make the following changes just based upon my experience:  when melting the butter and topping with the brown sugar, do this cooktop and not in the oven.  When you lay down the bottom crust, push down well.   Otherwise, just omit the brown sugar.  Lastly, I would prepare the filling with the seasonings and refrigerate overnight.

I have made this twice since finding it a month ago!! To it makes it easier…  mix the sugar spice(they make an “apple pie” spice that is excellent)and add ½ cup flour. Coat the apple slices in this before starting to layer your pie.  The first time I made this I used the recommended amount of spice and brown sugar, the second time I cut the brown sugar in half and doubled the spice, it was much better not syrupy, which my family prefers. I also doubled the recipe using 4 crusts and turned this into a cobbler, of course you have to double the baking time as well! EASY and is the best apple pie ever! Thanks TL Dixon, I love it! I took photos if you want to see the process on my facebook page.   http://www.facebook.com/KatrinaRadia?v=photos&sb=4#!/photo.php?pid=30715263&id=1120429019

I used this recipe more as a guide. I did, for the first time, use a cast iron skillet. I put a stuck of butter in it and let it melt in the oven. Then added a cup of brown sugar and continue to let it sit in the oven no longer than 15 mins. 
I made my own butter crust and after putting the first crust over the butter and brown sugar, I poked it with a fork and put it back into the oven for 10 mins. I then added the apples that I gently mixed with sugar and cinnamon. I left out the center crust and topped it off with my own butter crust. Cut some slits, dotted with butter and sprinkled with sugar. After about 50-55 mins in the oven it was golden beautiful and delicious.

2017 edit: This is still my go-to apple pie!  It's demanded every Thanksgiving.  I actually didn't bring it one year and there were some bummed relatives.  Oops.  Currently I use the double pie crust from King Arthur as that's my go-to baking site, and I triple the recipe to make two pies.  The French Pastry Pie Crust I mentioned, and have used many times, is very tasty but difficult to roll out.

Original 2011 review: Oh wow this was amazing...best apple pie I have ever had!  But how could it not be, with melted butter and brown sugar at the bottom!  Also, since no one says it anywhere but I guess it's obvious, use a 9 inch skillet. I think I used almost six apples, too.  Make sure you REALLY fill it as apples cook down quite a bit.  I used the French Pastry Pie Crust from this site for the crust (that is the BEST crust!!)

Absolutely the best apple pie my family and I have ever had.  The only changes made were, we made our own crust, used 100% whole wheat flour, and used unrefined turbinado sugar in place of the white.  I rolled the crusts out very thin.  This worked perfectly.  Baked the pie 45 minutes,  then turned off the oven and let it sit in there while we had our dinner.  What a rich delight that pie was!  Thank you so much, T. L.,  for a recipe that thrilled the whole family!  We just loved it!!

OMG! This came out wonderfully....I made the  crust fron scratch(hello Jiffy)the sliced apples were tossed with the sugar and cinnamon so they were totally coated. Very important not to overcook it and the top sparkles like sunshine hitting snow. Tiny chunks of butter on top more like 3TBLS

I sending this review from a man's perspective. My in-college daughter and I made this together. It was excellent! The recipe was easy to read and easy to follow. No unusual (have to shop around for and will only use once per year) ingredients. Two suggestions: add another 2 apples and less sugar. Other than that, to repeat, it was excellent. BPM & PHM

A recipe as perfect as they come. Some other posters have said it could use less sugar and I agree that it would be delicious even with considerably less, but it's delectable with them too. I'd never even thought of making apple pie in a skillet before I moved to Korea, but suddenly I was confronted with the fact that you can't find pie pans in this country, so this recipe was a godsend on Thanksgiving. Thank you so much from both me and my little expat community! We all enjoyed it very much!

My family love it...I do not do 3 pie crusts I only use 2 and cut the butter to 1/4 a cup and 1/2 cup brown sugar...I skipped the 1/4 cup white sugar on top and the dotted butter just sprinkle some sugar on the top crust. I also add 1/4 tsp nutmeg with the cinn.... I use the basic of the recipe for peach pies too only I add 1/4  cup tapioca to the peaches to make them less runny...using fresh peaches ...it's requested all the time

I made a few tweaks and it came out amazing. I used a 12" iron skillet. I did the full stick of butter in the bottom which was probably not necessary and next time I would use half. I also did just half a cup of brown sugar which was PLENTY. I didn't quite get how this melted puddle of butter and brown sugar was gonna work underneath the pie crust, but it didn't stick and baked a delicious sticky buttery layer onto the bottom. Most of the brown sugar stayed stuck in the pan after the pie was gone. I only used 2 crusts and skipped the middle layer because I was already running out of room for the apples. I think this recipe calls for way too many apples and I had a lot of extra, but it may be designed for a bigger skillet. My apples were bulging out of the top but baked down nicely. It really impressed at thanksgiving and was devoured before the pumpkin pie was even touched.

DEFINITELY brush the top crust with egg whites and then sprinkle with sugar, it makes it beautiful!

I had only made apple pie once, I don't make pies...not my favorite.  I have made this one at least 6 times.  So easy, soooooooo good.  Sometimes I add carmel candy in the layers.  Sometimes I use a skillet, sometimes a pan.  And I usually mix all of the apples with all of the sugar and cinnamon.  My son wants me to try it with peaches...hmmmmmm.

I have to rate this even though I haven't made it because I do a rhubarb pie that is done very much like this. All the ingredients make it so good and a dip of vanilla ice cream is just the thing to top it.

This was AWESOME!!! I made this Skillet Apple Pie for desert lastnight, I was a little leary of the size because there is only my husband and myself and we really don't eat much in the way of deserts. But boy am I glad I went ahead and made it because it was so good and NOW we have left overs!!! I think it is probably the best and easiest apple pie I have made in our 42 years of marrage. Thank you for sharring!

This is the first pie I have ever made and it was fantastic.  Make it as directed, bake it for 45 minutes and turn off the oven.   Leave the pie in for another 15 minutes and it will rock your world!   Serving it with vanilla ice cream is simply one of life's simple pleasures.

This was so yummy!  As another reviewer suggested, I did cut the brown sugar and butter in half, doubled the spices and premixed with sugar and 1/2 cup flour.  This step makes it so simple to prep the apples.  I think my favorite part of the dish was the "caramelly" treat found at the bottom of each bite! Delicious!!

I would however add a little freshly ground nutmeg. I wasn't crazy about the middle crust as It is unbrowned crust.

Wow! The caramel that forms in the bottom of the skillet takes this apple pie to the next level. I used Rome apples from the tree in our yard & they worked very well. The pie could have used at least one more apple than indicated, though. I left the brown sugar amount the same but cut all white sugar applications by half. Still plenty sweet enough for anyone, I think! WORD TO THE WISE: (1) even though you cut slits, this can boil over - so be sure to place the skillet on a cookie sheet in the oven and (2) if this pie isn't going to be completely eaten up while warm, be sure to remove it from the skillet to keep the caramel from forming  a shellac on the cast iron that you practically have to chisel out.

This pie was hands down, the best we've ever had but these were my revisions:  I didn't bother with the third (middle) crust, I melted the butter in a 12" iron skillet, put down the crust, THEN the brown sugar,  I cut back on the white sugar, tossed the apple slices (I used 6 Granny Smith) with a few squirts of lemon juice, sugar & spices before putting them in the crust, then the top crust where I put 1/2 stick of butter & a little more sugar, then baked it for 1 hour @ 350.  I let it sit in the turned-off oven while eating dinner. YUM YUM YUM....BEST Apple Pie EVER!!!

This was the best apple pie I ever made.  I would not ever go back to apple pie in a pie dish.  I did make a few changes  to it.  I added maybe 1 to 2 tsp of lemon juice to the apples while cutting them so they won't turn brown. I can't really say the exact amount because I did not measure.  I just sprinkled a little bit of lemon juice to each apple after I cut it up. I also added 1/4 cup of flour to the apples as well as an 1/8 tsp of nutmeg. I did coat the apples in the sugar and spices before I put it in the skillet.  It helps to get the apples well coated and it's easier.  You will not regret making this apple pie.  Enjoy!

Wow-this was so good. Probably the best apple pie I ever had.  I only bought one package of pie crust as I didn't realize I would need 3, but it worked just fine without the middle one. One other thing I did different was I added a little nutmeg. This was the best!! Thanks for such a great recipe.

Great pie, everybody loved it! I made it for Thanksgiving and sprayed the skillet with veg spray. After baking it, the pie got cool but I stuck it in my very warm oven 350 degrees until we finished eating (15 minutes). The pie came out of the pan without any problems. I took the rest of the leftover pie and stored it. With alot of soapy water, I boiled the water in the skillet, scrapping bits with a spatchula (spelling). Great!  This pie is so yummy--a new holiday tradition is born!

I was skeptical as I was putting it together but it was delicious! I didn't have anough brown sugar on hand so had to substitute 1C white sugar mixed with  1 1/2tbls molasses. Next time I will premix the sugar and cinnamon that goes in the middle layers to be sure its an even distribution. Overall, it was super easy to make and came out perfect. Even my brother wanted a piece to take home and he's not a big dessert fan.

I made this pie, and I’m sure glad I did!  It is scrumptious!  I followed the recipe exactly as written with one small exception.  I pre-baked the middle pie crust for seven minutes, then cooled it a bit before placing it between the Apple layers.  I had read many previous reviews stating the middle crust was mushy, which is understandable given the moisture from the apples.  The pre-baked crust held together perfectly and was not mushy.  I will definitely make this again!

This apple pie was amazing!!! I never knew it could be so easy to make at home! I followed everything except cut down a little on the white sugar between layers. Next time I may use cane sugar instead of white. I would also spray skillet first also, it sticks pretty bad after cooled. Topped with vanilla ice cream it's amazing!! My husband agreed! Will be making for Thanksgiving! :-D

I made this apple pie as the dessert to a Halloween dinner I put on for a few friends. It was PERFECT! Honestly, I'm not a huge apple pie fan, I hate soggy pastry and normally find apple to be lackluster and uninteresting. However, I wanted to do something with seasonal flavor, and this was delicious.

I made a couple adjustments that I would recommend- I added clove, nutmeg, and ground ginger to taste to the sugar & apple mixture. I would recommend around 1/2 tsp of clove and nutmeg, and just a tiny pinch of ginger. I also would suggest using brown sugar for sprinkling on the top of the pie instead of white sugar as the recipe suggests. The white sugar didn't caramelize as well as I would have liked it to.

That being said, this is pretty much as easy as dessert gets, and it does not disappoint. Tonight I'm making it with some added blackberries and raspberries, I'll update if it works out!

I normally don’t bother writing reviews but I had to. This is the best Apple Pie I have ever tasted! I did add a little nutmeg and flour to the filling...but it may have not even been needed. I told my husband that it was “slap your mama” good-the best apple pie that I had ever tasted. He didn’t believe me and tried a piece. He now wants me to make it for Thanksgiving with the in-laws. He’s calling them right now to brag! Lol

My mom used to make a mean apple cobbler that everyone loved. She did not use a recipe, and she made her crust from scratch. I never thought I could get anything close to her apple cobbler. I read this recipe, and said to myself, “this sounds good—almost like Mom's. Well, it is delicious! I rate it 5 even though I used store bought crust. Like others, I reduced the amount of sugar. Next time I’ll reduce it even more because I like a little tartness to the apples. Good job to whoever wrote the recipe!

This pie, as the recipe was written, in my opinion is WAY TOO SWEET!!  I'm still on the fence regarding the layer of pie crust in the middle since it just kind of turned to mush and was more like a dumpling filling, BUT the flavor was very good and I loved the idea of making it in the cast iron pan.  I will make this again BUT I will cut the sugar in half and the butter that you put in the pan to start off with to 1/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup because I think that was overkill.

This is a great skillet apple pie recipe, and I've been using this for years!! It uses a LOT of sugar, though, and I tend to reduce it greatly. I also mix the spices and sugar with the apples before adding to the pie.

This is the BEST apple pie recipe I've ever used.  I made it twice in 24 hours! You must slice and serve while warm because the brown sugar bottom will harden as it cools. To eat at a later time, put the skillet on the stove for a few minutes and slice.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Came out yummy!!!! I used a mixture of Cortland and Granny Smith apples.  I made it the night before for a party at work.  Next time I will add more apples since it went down a bit after resting overnight.  Taste and texture was perfect!

YUMMY! YUMMY!  Since I don't have a cast iron skillet I made this in stoneware csserole dish, which worked just fine.  Other changes I made was to use Honey Crisp apples and homemade pie crust from scratch.  Topped with vanilla ice cream and this proved to be a perfect recipe!!

I'd give this apple pie ten stars if that was possible! This pie is to die for! Didn't change a thing and it was the best pie I've ever made or had. Flaky, delicious, flavorful, easy to make, but the goodness dripped onto my oven floor (just a little).

WOW, probably the best apple pie you will ever have.  I followed the recipe to a tee and it turned out perfect.  My only mistake was thinking that my wife and I could eat it all  which was a big mistake.  This was a huge pie and one I should have saved until when we had company .  The crust was to die for but better than that was the flavor or the cooked apples.  I'm wondering now if I can find a way to make it in a smaller cast iron pan because we would both like to do this again.  It's best to eat this pie all at one sitting because once the bottom of the pie cools it has a tendency to harden and is a bit difficult to get out of the pan.  Just can't tell you how darn good this thing was.

Great pie! Everyone loved it. I mixed all the apples together with the sugar cinnamon before putting them in the pie. Didn’t use as much brown sugar in pan bottom maybe 1/3 cup. Also sprayed bottom of my cast iron with baking spray first.

Few minor changes: I used 6 granny smith apples. They weren't very big and could have used one more. I also stirred in the brown sugar after melting the butter. Maybe it was implied. Then I evenly spread the brown sugar/butter mixture in bottom on pan. I read a lot of comments about sticking to the pan. They are absolutely right but I discovered once it cooled  if you heat the pan on the stove, it scoops right out. Awesome recipe very sweet and lots of dense crust, which I freaking love!

I did like the taste. But I found the bottom to be very soggy. And with the amount of butter that was melted in the pan I really don't see how the pie bottom could not be anything but soggy.

Instead of white sugar I used a much smaller amount of Truvia.  I found the pie to be sweet enough for me. I also put apples in the bottom and cherry on top.

This is a great and easy recipe! I am a novice to cooking in a cast iron skillet, and I found the recipe to be very easy to follow. Next time I will cut my apples into thicker slices, as mine were complete mush by the time the crust was golden. I will also use a little more brown sugar and less white sugar. Overall, I definitely recommend!

Truly an outstanding pie.  I made my own crust (Never,Never Fail Pastry from this site).  I gave a piece to my neighbour who declared it superb.  That sugary/syrupy layer on the bottom really helps make it, though I cut back the brown sugar by half.  One caveat, I couldn't go the middle layer of pastry - just the top and bottom crusts, and I will make this again the same way. Mmm mm good.

Amazing recipe!, but needs some tweaks. Like others said it could use a few more apples. But above all, the amount of sugar suggested for sprinkling on the top crust is WAY too much. 1/4 cup or less at best is just fine. Made this for a rustic cabin weekend, perfect with vanilla ice cream! Comes together easily with pre-made crusts - Making it again for another cabin trip this weekend!

I've made this a few times, and have made the following changes to make it perfect over time. I used half the sugar recommended (white and brown) and it turns out better, you can taste the apples more. I melt and butter and combine with brown sugar on the stove top. Then I pour 1/2 of the butter-sugar mixer into the bowl of apples and mix well, adding the white sugar as well. I omit the middle crust, it's really not needed, and often won't cook well. Using a real CAST iron skillet I think is key, they really cook differently than the others.

This came out perfect and SO delicious! I only used 1/3 cup of sugar between each layer, instead of the 1/2 cup.  Other recommendation is when you melt the butter and add the brown sugar, allow enough time and heat for sugar to completely dissolve/melt/caramelize — before adding first layer of the pie crust.

I got this recipe from my mom years ago and it's the only apple pie I like.   My mom's recipe does not call for the third pie shell  which may explain why hers is slightly soupy, however wonderfully tasty.

A-Mazing!  5 Stars is not enough for this pie!  Like other reviewers, I reduced the brown sugar to 1/4 cup and it was a perfect combination of sweet base crust and tart apples.  I used turbinado sugar in place of the white sugar for a richer flavor.  I used the Ruth's Grandma's pie crust recipe from this site.  It makes more than enough crust and I used butter-flavored shortening for a flaky, buttery crust.

O-M-G! This pie is the bomb! Really, the best apple pie that I've ever made without a doubt. The only change I made was to use 6 granny smith apples. Other than that - followed the recipe to a "T". It turned out fantastic! I will be making this one again and again! Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!

I have made this recipe twice and both were delicious. I made 3 minor changes.  I used 4 large Granny Smith apples.  There was no way I could get all those apples and 3 pie crusts  in an iron skillet so I used my cast iron Dutch oven.  I followed the recipe as written except I added more cinnamon. It was heavenly and it didn't overflow into my oven.   Others said that theirs got rock hard after it cooled.  Mine didn't - probably because I had more apples, thus more juice.  It was just perfect in every way except for the calories.  This recipe will work for fresh pears or a pear and apple mix.  A real husband pleaser.

I must tell truth, I was really lazy and used store bought crust and canned pie filling. I also cut the brown sugar in half  and used a 9 inch skillet. I was worried because the bottom crust kept sliding down the side of the pan, but it came out fine and both my husband and I loved it!

As is by far the best apple pie I've ever made!  Made it in other variations as well like Blueberry and Cherry - with those you must use some cornstarch mixed in with the sugar to thicken because of the juiciness of the berries otherwise it will be too runny!  If I could give this a 10 I would thank you T L!

5 stars for the brilliant idea to make pie in a cast iron skillet! I'm content with skipping the middle crust and using Trader Joe's pie crusts that fit my 12" skillet perfectly. After you've enjoyed this delicious apple pie, try other fillings and serve this no-fuss, homey dessert anytime.

This is by far my most favorite recipe for apple pie ever. I have learned that you should use Light Brown sugar rather than Dark Brown sugar. The dark brown is heavier tasting. If you don't want the pie to stick to the bottom of the skillet, take it out before it cools. I don't measure my sugar, I just pour it all in a bowl together. A mandolin helps tremendously to slice your apples thin and evenly. My friends LOVE when I make this pie, which is often because it is AMAZING!

Wow! this pie is delicious and I'm not a traditional apple pie fan! Don't understand why some reviewers want to add flour to this recipe...It's perfect just the way it's written! I love its gooey deliciousness..I have made this 2 times now, and only used 2 pie crusts because that's all I had at the time...Highly recommend this recipe. Great topped with vanilla ice cream!

I made this pie following the recipe exactly.  It was really amazing, and I actually already have an apple pie recipe that I love.  This is now going in my apple pie rotation because it is truly delicious!  A few notes--it *is* sweet, but my husband and I like it this way.  Usually I up the amount of cinnamon (I like my pies to be really spicy) but I think the 2 tsp of cinnamon is just right for this pie.  We did not have any trouble with the pie sticking to the bottom of our cast iron skillet.

Believe this would be better made with a sweeter apple and more of them and less sugar.

Made this over the weekend and it was great!  My family couldn't get enough of it.  Super easy to make but it tastes like you slaved in the kitchen for hours to create this treat.  The only thing I did different was cut the sugar to 1/3 cup that I sprinkled over the apples of each layer.  Wonderful served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream..yum!!

Made this today following directions except that I did add a little allspice with the cinnamon; otherwise exactly like the recipe.  Must admit I was a little skeptical about that middle crust getting done but it was absolutely delicious and that crust was done!  My granddaughter came in just as it came out of the oven and she gave it an A+.  Will definitely keep it in my recipe file and have no doubt I will make it many more times!!

This was delicious!   I almost left out one of the crusts but went ahead and did all three and was glad I did.  It definitely was best the first day but it was still good the following day.  I also followed the ‘hint’ and used aluminum foil on the s bottom of the pan, which I would recommend.   Very easy to get out of Pan.    I will make it again!

This is a holiday standard for us now.  So tasty and my husband loves the extra crust.  I put the putter in the bottom and put a pie crust on top of it and then the brown sugar for a bit less of a mess but other wise I stay pretty close to the recipe.  It's a hit wherever it goes!

OhhhMmmmGeeee!!! This was amazing!!! By far the best apple pie I’ve ever had! I made a few (very) minor changes. Used gala apples instead of Granny Smith (personal preference). Replaced cinnamon with apple pie spice. And finally, I mixed the apples with sugar and spices prior to layering to ensure even coating.  I can’t say enough about this recipe. Everyone raved about it! And if you can eat it warm from the oven topped with vanilla ice cream...... Heaven on earth.

Decided to give this recipe a test drive before taking to our Thanksgiving pot luck. I used an 8" well seasoned iron skillet, and it was super simple easy to make, everyone loved it! I like it better than regular apple pie. Haven given out the recipe twice already. For my taste,  I will reduce the sugar in the layers to 1/4 cup  per layer and just a dusting on top next time as it really doesn't need the extra sweetness, especially if serving with ice cream. Will be making this for the Turkey Day dinner.   Oh, and it did bake over my iron skillet a bit leaving a sweet oven mess to clean up.

Wow. We just tore this cake up. Yes there is a lot of sugar, but I decided to follow the recipe as Is the first time and lemme tell ya, my husband said this is my best pie yet! I definitely used Pam on the edges of the cast iron for easy clean up and once it semi cooled, I removed the pie to a new dish and cleaned the cast iron relatively easily. 10 stars!

It was ok.  Problem with all the crust.  No one liked the mushy crust in the middle, so that was a problem, lol.  They ate around it.  Second time I used "most" of the recipe was to eliminate the bottom and middle layer of dough.  Healthier and still has the same great flavor.

Sooo yummy! I love crust and this recipe is definately the best for it amount wise. However, it was not too much like some pie recipes can be with a home made dough. I only have a square cast iron skillet, not a round. Worked the same degree and cook time wise but I may need to get larger pie crusts to help keep the sides pinched together

used 6 honey crisp apples, and only ¾ cup brown sugar on bottom of skillet. tossed apple slices with white sugar (only ½ cup) + cinnamon (extra) and a pinch of nutmeg before layering in skillet. apples turned out perfectly baked and excellent flavor, and top crust beautiful - flakey and tasty with sparkling sugar crystals sprinkled on top. HOWEVER - the bottom crust was limp and the middle crust not even close to being done - just soggy dough; don't see how it could bake completely sandwiched between layers of wet apples. the brown sugar/butter on bottom of skillet was like peanut brittle. would like to make again if i knew how to avoid these problems... i baked it longer than recipe, about 55 minutes. any longer and the top crust would have been burned.

This was very tasty, and relatively simple.  I also love the ability to bake something this special while camping in cast iron.  Only complaint was that there was LOTS of syrup.  I may cut down on the sugar slightly next time and see if that helps.

This WAS very good.  I have to make diabetic pie, used Splenda brown sugar and Splenda baking sugar.  Wonderful. This is a two hand pie coming out of the oven.

This skillet apple pie was very tart in my opinion it needs more sugar and cinnamon . I remade this with 3/4 cup sugar and cinnamon and apple pie spice per layer with dots of butter in each layer and it came out syrupy and sweet and tasty.

The recipe is delicious.  I made a few changes to the recipe by making my own crust, and substituting a mixture of nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice and ginger for the cinnamon.  I also baked the pie on a wood pellet grill, using apple wood pellets.   The pie turned out great and I will definitely be making it again.

Hands down my favorite apple recipe ever and I make it almost as written, just add about 2 more apples.  When I first read it I thought there was NO WAY this much sugar would work.  I was wrong.  This is a must try.  You won’t be disappointed!  Thank you for this amazing recipe!

Being a Minnesotan, I've never tried an iron skillet pie before. This was absolutely delicious! I made it exactly as written and wouldn't change I thing. I'll be replacing my old apple pie recipe with this moving forward.

For my first time trying to make an apple pie that was not out of a box, this was amazing!  Didn't change a thing on the recipe. Thank you so much for helping a new cook, like myself, be the most awesome wife ever (according to my husband! LOL)!!!!

Cannot believe this comes from old skillet or how ingredients rise from bottom throughout the pie. Cuddos.

Wow Wow Wow, I made this for the first time. Apple pie on steroids. I have eaten  this two other times from friends and made it myself this time. Used a n 8 inch cast iron pan. I blended sugar and cinnamon in a bowl before spreading over apples. I personal don't like regular apple pie but prefer Dutch apple crumb type. Not too sweet for me but I eat with Ice cream. Also had a small slice for breakfast. This is the benchmark of apple pies. Glad to add to my playlist.

Made it as directed first time and was too sweet for me.   I liked the concept ,the texture, and the ease of making....so I made it a second time this time with half the sugar and used peaches instead of apples.  My family’s new favorite desert!!!

This pie is incredible - & I’m not even a fan of apple pie!!  I made it exactly as the recipe states, with one exception:  I substituted red delicious apples since that’s what I had.  I did also use a little less sugar to adjust for the sweeter apples. Next time I will definitely use a more sour green apple variety, since I feel the sweet/sour combo would make the flavor pop, in which case I think the amount of sugar the recipe calls for is perfect.  I will make this again and again.  Thank you!!!

I made the pie just as recipe is written,  I did spray my cast iron skillet with spray. Wonderful pie, best apple pie I’ve ever made. Taste so good hot with ice cream, but taste just as good cold. This is a great pie. Thank you!

I thought it had a lot of sugar in the recipe,  so I deleated a little.  This was a mistake (not a big one).  I would use amount in the recipe nest time.  Great taste - I used Fuji apples.

This was a GREAT pie. I read the reviews before making this; and then slightly modified the original accordingly.
I made my own pie crusts...store bought cannot compare with homemade, and 3 crusts mean 3 x the deliciousness. I did pierce each bottom crust with a fork.  I combined the apple slices (from 6 large apples) with the sugar, cinnamon filling along with 1/4 cup flour before I put them on top of each crust. I baked the pie for 50 minutes at 350 degrees, but turned up the oven to 375 degrees and baked another 15 minutes until the filling was bubbling through the openings and the top crust was a nice golden brown. Everyone loved it. I had no difficulty slicing this, whether warm or cool.

I had planned on making this thanksgiving, so I cut and seasoned the apples earlier in the day.  Time got away from me and I didn’t make the pie until the next day.  Heavens, the apples were perfect.  Followed directions and made one of the very best skillet pies ever!  Thank you for posting this recipe, it’s a keeper.

I may never make another regular apple pie! This was delicious and very easy (mainly because I used prepared pie crusts).  The entire family loved it and cooking it in the iron skillet made it a novelty. I will make it again but would probably prepare the apples before starting the butter and brown sugar process. I felt the butter/brown sugar was a little too grainy because it may have cooked just a bit too long (just my observation no one else seemed to notice).  I might try cherry or peach as well.

This pie is a crowd pleaser, and I have used fuji apples and reduced the sugar and it is still delicious! When I make it, I have to prepare a 2nd dessert because it won't last. Guest want to come back 2-3 times for seconds! Love, love it!

It was delicious!!  I Harv some extra crust , apples, and a small 6” cast iron pan so I made a mini one too. I didn’t not add the 3rd crust on the mini version.  
I put the pie back in the oven to warm it (unglue it ) from the bottom of the pan.

Not only does it look beautiful, the taste was amazing!  Also, I liked the "homey" feel of the cast-iron skillet instead of a pie pan. 
Hands down, my new apply pie favorite!

This is better than any traditional apple pie I have ever eaten!  I followed the recipe as written and will continue to do so.  If I had watched the video first, I would have realized that it required a 9-inch skillet.  Although my skillet is larger, and the crusts didn't fill the pan, the result still was heavenly.  I might have to buy a new 9-inch skillet just for this recipe!  For those who are worried that there's too much sugar, I say that you need all of the sugar because Granny Smith apples are pretty tart.

This is ohhh sooo good! I made as directed but did not add the cup of white sugar that goes in between layers. Mine was plenty plenty sweet without it! I also added a tablespoon or two of flour with the apples to help them not be too watery. This was very good and enjoyed by all but next time I am going to see what its like to leave out the middle crust. The top and bottom crust were just the right crunch for me but not a big fan of soft crust (which middle one is). If it doesn't work I will come back to the original because it is great. With all that butter the pan cleaned up super easy.

When I make it again, I'm cutting down the sugar by about 1/2 (brown and white). There was too much. The brown sugar and butter at the bottom was great.

The crust did stick to the bottom of the pan, so a lot of people missed out on the crust.

It was a hit at the work potluck. I made it the night before and heated it up on the oven the next morning taking it in to work in an insulated container. It was still a bit warm at lunch.

I made with the only cast iron skillet I available, which was 15-16 inch diameter. Used 9 Apple's(all I had). Could have used more. I also used Courtland Apple's which were what was available. 
No issues with the bottom being stuck. It was crispy and good. 
Like many, I didn't bother with the middle crust. Next time will make it with a 12 inch skillet. Overall, quite good, very easy pie. Better than deep dish.

This was so easy and a huge hit in our house!  I changed it up a bit by melting butter and brushing the pie crust and I mixed the apples with butter and sugar before filling. We will definitely be making it again!

This pie is wonderful.  I did add a pinch of nutmeg.  It came out perfect.  Thank you so much for this recipe.

I made this pie and it is easy and delicious.  I’ve two suggestions.  Spray your pan with Pam, it was sticky on the side and difficult to loosen.  Use more apples.  I used six and eight would have been better.  There is no need to change anything else.  If you think you can’t make apple pie, you can make this one!

Haven't made it yet, but I had a friend who use to make a similar pie, but it had another layer and crust and they called it a Four Horse Apple Pie.

This is so delicious! Made it with just a small amount less of sugar; maybe 1/8 cup, just because we try to cut down on a little white sugar when we can. It was perfect for our taste. We will be making this again for Thanksgiving in three weeks!

although my husband isn't a great fan of sweetness I am so for me this worked out amazingly. The simplest, easiest, fastest, best tasting apple pie ever. Only thing I added was cinnamon and a tad of lemon juice to cut back on the sugar. Everyone loved it and now it's my go-to pie wherever I go.

My family loved it.  I found it too sweet, so I cut down the white sugar.  I used dark brown sugar instead.  It gave it a nice glaze on the bottom of the skillet.

This is my very first apple pie ever. I am a very beginner level Baker. I followed recipe exactly and it was amazing! I can't believe how easy it was to make! My only note to self is to make sure I put something under the rack to catch drippings as it did overflow a bit and make a mess. I can't wait to make again!!!

This pie recipe is amazing. I bought a cast iron skillet and I made it for potluck at church and everyone raved about it. Including my pastor from the pulpit. I had many request to please make two next time. This will be my go to pie.

Only change I made was I used 8 apples. I really thought it would be too sweet but to everyone that ate it they are said it was perfect! After it was done I turned off the oven and left it in there until after we ate dinner. Did not stick to the skillet and was still so warm and topped with ice cream. I also sprayed the skillet with Pam before I started! I will be making again.

Excellent. Only change was less sugar as others said and more apples- it was great! I was worried about it sticking to pan so we just moved it to a plate after we were done.

Now, I have always had compliments on my apple dumplings, apple pie and apple cobbler, but this recipe tops them all. I have never had so many rave reviews on my apple desserts like this one. Truly amazing! And I normally tweak recipes but I went exactly by the directions. Since I was a bit slow in preparing the apples, I did take it out of the oven with the brown sugar for awhile and put it back in there before adding the apples. I cut my apples thin like it said and they were still slightly crisp, which was wonderful and a surprise to me. Just a great, great recipe. Thank you for sharing it with us. Sorry I didn't take a picture to add, it was very beautiful, too.

YUMMY!!!! 
I love love love your Grandma!!
I didn't follow the recipe to a T ...But I did follow the technique. The brown sugar and butter in the bottom is  super yummy. If you do not have a cast iron skillet, don't even try to make this, it will not work.

I used 9 applies, reduced the brown sugar to 1/4 cup and heated the butter on the stove.  I also doubled the cinnamon and cut the apples very thin.  It was the most amazing apple pie we have ever had, and it came out looking so beautiful.  I cut the butter paper thing that I laid on the top crust .

Very forgiving recipe! Didn't weight apples and guessed. Used a coconut oil vegan butter substitute no problem. Forgot to use about half of the white sugar and sprinkle the top. Opened the oven a bunch of times to put in or take out other dinner items. Still, the pie was delicious! I heeded others when they said the crust welds to the pan- my new awesome Stargazer pan had no problems at all, but i did transfer leftovers to a disposable pan to be safe. Fun pie to make- would be a great mom and kid project too!

I usually make my own crusts but not this time. I made it exactly like the recipe called for. It was easy and my husband (who is very picky) and son loved it.  I used Granny Smith apples and my 9 inch cast iron skillet.

This is sickeningly sweet. Way too much sugar. Less crust, less sugar, more apple.

I rarely rate recipes, but this one was delicious. I'm not a big lover of apple pie, but this is now my go-to recipe. I don't own a cast iron skillet, but I used a copper chef type pan. It wasn't as crispy on the bottom as it would likely have been in an iron skillet, but it was still awesome. This will be my apple pie recipe from now on.

I cut the amount of sugar on the top crust by a 1/3. I will make this again and try cutting the white sugar amount that layers with the apples by 1/4. This was the easiest pie I have made.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and received rave reviews! I have never made a pie before but this recipe was very easy to make. However, I did make three changes. First, I reduced the amount of sugar sprinkled on each layer by half. Everyone said it was just the right amount of sweetness and couldn't imagine more sugar. Second, I used half Honey Crisp apples and half Granny Smith apples. The combination of the two types of apples made for a less tart flavor. Lastly, I added cinnamon with the nutmeg. Friends and family also really liked the caramelization of the brown sugar on the bottom; that set it apart from other apple pies. My family has requested this be a regular for our holiday gatherings. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

Absolutely wonderful.  I couldn’t believe that middle crust baked so perfectly.  Took longer than the recipe stated by almost 1/2 hour but I waited until the juices bubbled up and began to carmelize a bit.  I did cut the sugar in half using half the called for brown and half the white.  It was plenty sweet. I also made my own old recipe crust with two cups flour, one cup crisco cut together thoroughly adding 1/4 cup ice water and working lightly, refrigerate before rolling out.  Makes three thinner crusts.

I doubled the apples  and put it  on a cookie sheet lined with foil because I knew the juices would overflow.    Because of the extra apples, it was mounded really high, but fabulous looking when it came out of the oven..

Hello !!! The BEST recipe I have come across! I did bake it at 350 for 2 hours though. I found after 45 minutes my apples were still crunchy , so I put it back in at 350 for another hour . PERFECT PIE !!!

This is my first review I have ever written.  This apple pie is the bomb!  I made exactly as it said, I just sprinkled left over cinnamon on the top. My husband said this was one of the best things I’ve ever made.  This turned out so good.  And I’m not a great cook.

This is an excellent pie and easy to make.  My family loved it.  I reduced the brown sugar to 3/4 cup and mixed the apples with the sugar and cinnamon as some others did.  I reduced the white sugar that is sprinkled on top of the last crust to about 1/8 cup.  I also placed the skillet in the oven for 5 minutes after the second crust layer was applied, just to make sure that layer didn’t become under cooked.  My daughter in law who is a professional cook asked for the recipe.  I know that I will make this recipe again.

WOWEE!!! I made this  in our cabin in the woods on a 'camping trip' and we all thought it was amazing!! Everything seems to taste better when eaten on a picnic table in the great outdoors, but I think it was the apple pie in that iron skillet and not the surroundings! Vanilla ice cream melting on top....just killer good!! My husband is insisting I make it for Thanksgiving this week. He says "best pie I've ever had"!! No changes to recipe; it is perfect! Love finding a real keeper.

This is fabulous!!!??i don't plan to make an old fashion apple pie unless I am taking it somewhere. But this version is decadent! 
Only change first time I made it exactly as written. Too sweet for us...so second time I reduced the white sugar to 1/3 cup in each layer instead of a 1/2 cup. Apple flavor was so good. Same apples as the first pie. Reduced sugar helped overall flavor!  Total hit!!!
Thanks so much!!!

Absolutely the tastiest (and most unhealthy) thing I’ve ever made! It is incredibly easy to make, fairly cheap, and just downright delicious. I read another reviewer say cut down the sugar, and I agree. I believe if you only used half of the white sugar recommended, it’ll actually taste better. At times I was crunching on sugar crystals and missed out on the cinnamon apple flavor. Still the best apple pie I’ve ever had, and will be making again!

I followed the recipe as written except I may have used more apples.  I was told by my husband Bob & our friends that it was absolutely delicious.  I did not eat any because I am gluten intolerant.

Those that said "best apple pie EVER" . . .are spot on!  Super simple to make, but absolutely outstanding.  Even my husband who could take or leave apple pie said it is the best he's ever had!

This is absolutely fabulous. I will never bake an apple pie any other way. The butter-sugar on the bottom was magic. I used only 1/3 cup sugar over each layer of apples as i was nervous about how much brown sugar was already in the pan. Served with ice cream, it was just perfect for us. I think i will try this with fresh peaches too. Thank you!!!

Put 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon on each layer.  Think I'll combine cinnamon & sugar, easier to sprinkle on the apples.  Husband said not to change anything else.  Will be making again, it's in my cookbook.

This pie is delicious! I might not put the sugar on the top crust next time but that's just out of personal taste. It is the perfect combination of sweet and tart. I plan to make it again.

I was tempted to cut back on the sugar and/or butter but decided to make as is and make adjustments in the future if necessary. I made it exactly as directed EXCEPT I didn’t use Granny Smith apples - I used fresh picked Cortland, Gala and Mac. It was delicious. I didn’t think it would be as good (or easy) as my Swedish Apple Pie Recipe but it was. My family gobbled it up. Make it! YUM!

This pie was amazing and so easy to make. I also had a big caked on mess that was difficult to clean so I soaked the pan for 10-15 minuets in warm water. It cleaned right up and I just reseasoned it again with oil. Don’t let your pan set in water. It will rust.

Very good and easy to making . Although, when I read to serve it warm, I thought that was just a suggestion, it wasn’t. I served it room temperature and it was almost impossible to get it out of the skillet. I warned it in the oven for about 15 minutes and the slices were removed easily.

I used about 10 apples. 5 on each of the first and second crust.  On top of the pie I cut the sugar in half. It was delicious. I've never been able to bake a pie but this turned out great. Yum!!! I'll definitely make this again.

It was by far the best apple pie I've ever made and I make Apple pie a couple times a month for my husband.  I'm a fan of Apple Slab Pie and will continue to make that but this was AMAZING!  I used Truvia Blend for the sugar which uses half as much and even cut down on that.  Worked perfect in the cast iron skillet.  LOVED IT!  Making one for Thanksgiving.

This is a delicious pie! I think this one is our new favorite go-to apple pie. I used 3 different tart, firm apples including Granny Smith & squeezed one fresh lime over the slices in a bowl & added one teaspoon of vanilla & tossed to mix. I also mixed the cinnamon & sugar together. Very pretty pie too!

This tasted great!! The only thing I added was a little nutmeg. I thought it felt a little flat and my apples were mushy but I may have cut them too small.

I was skeptical because of the three pie crust and no flour to thicken but this pie was awesome.  I used refrigerated pie crust and did not have high expectations but it was chewy on the bottom and the top crust is crispy and sweet.   I will definitelymake again.

This pie was very delicious and easy to make.  The only thing I changed was to make my own pie crusts rather than buying them.  Being in the skillet made it very easy to pop it in the oven to warm before serving again the next day.  I will definitely make this pie again and again!

Actually I've made this pie twice!  I love it.  The only tweaks I made were that I made my own pie crusts, did not use a center crust, and cut the sugar back on it.  The one problem I have is the bottom crust is not done and a bit soggy.  I am going to follow another persons suggestion the next time and upon melting the butter in the pan and adding the brown sugar, I am going to throw in the bottom crust and bake it for about 10 mins then add the apples and top crust to see if that helps.  Otherwise this is a real gem.

I have to say that it was fun making this pie and it turned out really pretty but was absolutely way too sweet. I will probably cut all the sugar and butter in half the next time and add a couple more apples. I had no trouble with it cooking except I added 5 minutes to the time for it to brown. All the layers were done with the extra time. Thanks for the recipe!

My whole family loved this & raved for more. I did make a few changes. Omitted the middle crust. Mixed the apples, sugar, cinnamon &  a 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg together. The bottom was a little crunchy which made it even better. I will definitely make this again. It was so worth buying a cast iron skillet for.

This pie was easy to make and I finally made good use of the wrought iron skillet I bought a couple years ago. The pie is delicious. The only thing I added to the recipe was 2 Tbsp. of flour. I mixed the apples, sugar, cinnamon and flour together in a big bowl and then divided it between the 2 layers. When eating I can barely tell that the middle crust is there. I live alone most of the time as my boyfriend is a truck driver, but I am going to freeze some for when he comes home. I baked mine for 45 minutes and the crust was just barely beginning to turn golden. It probably could have baked another 5 or more minutes but I still think it is great as is and the apples were well cooked. Thanks for a great, easy pie recipe!

This is truly  a TERRIFIC recipe! I made it as written with the only exception being that I made my own pie crusts (just can't get myself to purchase something so easy and inexpensive to make).  One important step is to put the melted butter and brown sugar back in the oven to "caramelize" for  no more than 4-5 minutes before laying the first crust in the pan, it makes the finished pie amazing!  Also, do not pat the first crust down,  gently lay it on the butter/brown sugar mixture.  I was not sure if I should try to pinch the middle and top crusts together and I chose not to.  I didn't seem to make a difference whatsoever.  This is an outstanding recipe that I will surely make again!

It turned out soooo good. My husband and I ate it in 2 days! I did add a dash of Nutmeg to the 2nd pie crust layer. I will make it many more times. I think I might even do a Peach Cobbler the same way. Thanks for all the great recipes!

My husband & I just loved this apple pie...I am a new diabetic so I had to switch to Splenda Brown & Splenda White for the sugars called for in the recipe...but it didn't take away from this recipe at all..the only other change I had to make because I have to watch carbs is to eliminate the center crust...it wasn't missed.  I don't think I will ever bake an apple pie in a pie plate again...I have already passed this on to some friends.  I think it would be an impressive pie for anyone's Thanksgiving Dinner...Thanks for Sharing...It really was DELISH !!!

Absolutely unbelievable. This pie stands above all others!

I did make some tweaks as per some of the other comments. I used 3 teaspoons of cinnamon, a half cup of flour (I'd probably decrease it to 1/3 cup), and 1/4 cup of white sugar. I mixed those together, tossed the apples with the mixture, then put it in the bottom crust. I didn't use a center crust (what's the point?), and I followed the rest of the instructions to the letter.

This pie tastes a lot like an apple cinnamon roll. It's pretty darned sweet, so be prepared. However, the cast iron pan makes the crust wonderfully crispy, which is where my pies are always lacking. This pie is perfectly done after 45 minutes, and the crust isn't soggy nor overdone. 

You absolutely cannot go wrong with this pie.

I'm not a fan of apple pie yet I made knowing others would enjoy it.  I enjoyed it as well and would make it again.   I followed directions as close as I could, I like to alter things but I try not to at least not the first time.  My apples were small so that is the only thing I changed I needed to use more.

Well this is my first ever review. I've never before been inclined to write one.   But I made this pie , straight by the recipe except I added a pinch of nutmeg.  I made it in a No. 7 iron skillet, 10 1/8" across the top, and I had to cook it about an hour. I may have been able to take it out a few min. earlier as well. Anyway some of the brown sugar carmelized slightly. Ever now and then a bite would be a little granular.  I don't know if it was supposed to or not, but the pie was exceptional.  I may try reducing the sugar a little next time...not sure. I could also try using one size larger skillet. But it's hard to improve on perfection.  Thanks so much for the recipe

WOW!  This was amazing!!!  I made a few changes:  cut the white sugar by half; added 1/8 tsp each of ginger, cloves, and nutmeg; added 1/4 c. bourbon (1/8th to the brown sugar/butter mixture) and 1/8th to the last layer of apples; added an extra pie crust and an extra apple.  Make sure you place a cookie sheet underneath while baking as the extra filling will boil over a bit.

I was really excited to try this, but I won't make it again. The second I put the bottom crust into the pan over the butter/brown sugar mixture, it melted into a mess.  I ended up having to scoop out a gross pie crust/brown sugar pile of hot goo out of the bottom of the pan, and I turned this into a bottomless apple pie in the skillet. The flavor of the apples is fine, but no different than any other apple pie I've made. I'll stick to my usual recipe!

My entire family LOVED this pie! I cut the sugar by about 2/3 because my son is diabetic and only used two pie crusts. One on the bottom trim and one on top. This is a def keeper! Thanks for sharing!

My family insists I make this each year for our Thanksgiving feast. I make it the day before and slightly undercook. The day of, while cleaning up dinner, I put the pie back in the oven for Twenty minutes and serve hot and a la mode.  Fantastic every time!

My first  home made apple pie ever  and it was delicious ! Not to mention super easy. Everyone loved it !! Followed the recipe exactly, but like many other reviewers mentioned, it's really sweet. Next time I will reduce the brown sugar and the white sugar .

On the sweet side but delicious. I substituted 2 tablespoons of  raw coarse granulated sugar sprinkled over the top of the pie instead of the 1/4 cup of regular sugar.

I cut down the sugar as I'd seen others recommend that.   I used a bit over 1/2 cup probably. Also, I added some rum soaked raisins.  Other than that...made it just as it was written.  Served this to my hubby, our son and his family and my aunt.  They were astounded.  Really!  Best apple pie they'd ever had.  Sprinkled the top with cinnamon sugar and butter.  Wowzer.

I absolutely love this recipe!  I kept all measurements the same.  After reading the other reviews of how the pie stuck to the pan, I decided to cook in a glass pie dish.  I melted the butter in the dish as directed, but instead of placing the brown sugar on top of it, I first placed the crust then coated the bottom in brown sugar.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly as written.  I had no issues with Sticking and the pie turned out to be amazing!  It was my first time baking an Apple pie and I will always continue to follow this recipe.  My boyfriend said it was the best apple pie he has ever had!

This was really easy and turned out so well!  The only thing I did differently was after it baked for 45 minutes, I turned on the broiler for about 3-4 minutes to get the top nice and crispy.

This was the best pie! Very easy to make. I actually made my own crust using Betty Crocker mix. Followed recipe and also added a dash of nutmeg. This was the hit of the meal. Topped it off with Vanilla ice cream. Will make it again.

Used directions of a reviewer... Tasted great with the changes! I cut the sugar back (3/4 c. brown sugar on the bottom, and a 1/2 c. for the filling). I also tossed my filling together rather than just sprinkling the sugar on top. In the filling I added 2 Tbsp. flour & a sprinkle of nutmeg. I was unable to serve this right away, so my pan was one sticky caked-on rock-hard mess! TO CLEAN the cast iron, fill 3/4 with water, add a couple of squirts of DISHWASHER soap (not dish soap), & boil on the stove for 10-20 min. Turn off & let sit overnight. The gunk will slide right off the pan in the morning.

Great recipe!  It was delicious my family loved it..I will however next time preheat the skillet and melt the brown sugar and butter together then pour it in..The carmel was a little grainy for me but I just think I should have cooked it longer.

No one in the family has ever liked apple pie, till we tried this one.  Now it's our favorite.  Try using homemade pie crusts and Baeburn apples for an even better pie.

I followed the recipe and took into account other reviewers suggestions to mix the apples with the sugar all in one large bowl and added cinnamon to that along with 2 tbs flour. I sprayed the skillet well and melted butter and brown sugar on stove top rather then the oven.

This is the only one I make and have done it for 
many years now.  When my brown sugar and butter
get really hot in my iron skillet, I just take the pie
crust  and mix it until it melts all together.  Then
just add the apple mixture and start with the new
layer.  It is so easy and everyone loves this one!
Thanks hope you enjoy.

No changes. Took it to a potluck and got rave reviews from those who loved it! Will definitely make again! Also, after it was gone, the cast iron skillet scraped out, then washed easily. Can't quite understand why others had problems with that....update...have made 3 times now and husband liked the first time the best because I actually forgot the pan in the oven with the butter and brown sugar got crunchy before I put my first pie crust in the pan. He liked it that way best even tho I was worried that I had wrecked it.

in a word - it was awesome!  It is very rich!!!  I made my own crusts, and used about 1/2 of the sugar.  I also baked it a tad longer.  I tossed the apples in the sugar and cinnamon per someone's recommendation.  I didn't have any problems with sticking but decided to 'decant' it to a pie dish before it completely cooled.  Will definitely make again.

I am not an Apple Pie person.  However, this pie is absolutely wonderful!!!!  

I made a slight change.  I hand picked my apples from my tree in my backyard.  I gave a great deal of attention to the apples all year with hopes they would be sweet Granny Apples.  And that they were!  The apples were very sweet, which meant I did not need as much sugar as the recipe called for.  I cut both the brown sugar and white sugar in half.  The natural flavor of the apples came through.

I will make this again.  The middle crust simply rocks and reminds me of the pies my great-grandmother once made.

Highly Recommended!!!!!

Delicious! I made the apple mixture and refrigerated overnight; which, allowed the apples to set to perfection! I then put the pie together as instructed, packing the brown sugar down and only using 1/8 sugar on top crust. Brushed egg white onto top crust to make golden brown. It was a hit at Thanksgiving

Amazing!  Family favorite! Have cut some calories by replacing white sugar with sugar substitute and omitted middle crust. Almost as good (not quite) but one way to cut back a little.

Soooo delicious!  I left out the middle crust but followed the exact recipe.  Next time I will use less sugar.  Wonder if I can substitute with sugar-free brown and white sugar?

SO GOOD! I followed directions exactly, EXCEPT for adding some non stick cooking spray to the pan before the butter, as well as just leaving the skin on apples. 
Delicious. Will be making again.

I only had one box of pre-made pie crust containing two crusts; therefore, I eliminated the middle crust layer.  Other than that, I prepared the pie exactly as per the recipe.  The melted buttery brown sugar under the bottom layer made the pie taste spectacular.  Great recipe!  I will definitely make this recipe again.  For health reasons, I may use less butter and sugar next time.  If it lessens the taste, I will go back to the original recipe.  Thanks again!

This was my first apple pie!  I am not much of a baker but this turned out awesome!  Followed the receipt as written.  When I make it again I will add one apple and do away with the middle crust.  I did add just a large pinch of nutmeg between layers.  Also added maybe 20 min. to the cook time.  We live at 4500 feet and that may be the reason for longer cook time.

I made this in my college apartment with a 8" cast iron skillet. The recipe doesn't specify the size pan, but it is definitely a big one. I just cut all the portions down and cooked for the same amount of time. It is absolutely amazing and my apartment smells great.

I wasn't able to do the three layers because my skillet wasn't deep enough.  Also, I make my own pie crust using the 1:1/2: 1/4 ratio method.  It was the best pie, EVER! My family raved about it and said this was the only kind I needed to make.  I heartily agree.

After reading the reviews, I had to give this apple pie a try... and I will NEVER make any other apple pie again!!!  This is the BEST PIE RECIPE!!!  I did follow one helpful suggestion, and thoroughly spray my skillet with a nonstick spray... absolutely no problems with crust adhering to bottom or sides of skillet. I also added 1/2 cup of white flour, 1 tsp cinnamon, & 2 tsp apple pie spice with the 1 cup of white sugar to coat all of the apple slices before placing them on the crusts. The buttery brown sugar on the bottom is just mouthwatering deliciousness!!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  :-)

I'm not a pie maker, I can't do piecrust, but I thought I'd try it anyway since it was rated so high. It's wonderful!!! I took it to our family Fourth Of July Fest and it was gone in nothing flat. Like some of the others, I mixed the cinnamon and sugar together before adding. When served hot, there wasn't trouble with it sticking. This is now my favorite recipe to take to gatherings.

I made this last night. I followed the recipe with a few changes. I have a porcelain cast iron skillet, so I used that the help with sticking. I had gala apples so I just reduced the amount of sugar. I had 4 pie crusts so I just used them all and made kind of a cobbler. Instead of layering the apples, sugar & cinnamon separately, I just mixed them all in a big bowl, then layered in the pre sugared apples. I let it bake about 1.5 hours due to the extra dough. Perfection!

Best & easiest pie ever!  I only use about half the sugar called for because the first one was wayyy too sweet.  I also added a dash of nutmeg because I like it.

Made this skillet apple pie today. Followed recipe except I used about 1/4 less of white sugar. I used Marie Calendar pie crusts. came out flaky, buttery, goodness. Definitely one of the more richer apple pies that i'm used to. Maybe next time I'll slice the apples a tad larger and use less sugar to suit my taste. Enjoy!

This recipe was fantastic! We picked wine sap apples today and I used them in the pie! However, I somewhat changed a lot! First, I added a bit of nutmeg, allspice, and clove to the apples, and I added all the sugar at once--which I do NOT recommend doing and I won't do this again. The reason being that I found that adding the sugar and cinnamon made the apples start releasing all their juice. I had all the apples in a bowl and they stayed mostly dry for a while until I added the sugar and then a puddle of juice collected on the bottom. Either add the sugar on top, or do it right before adding it to the pan. Also, I used pie crust made with cold vodka and water. The vodka adds moisture but the ethanol inhibits gluten formation. Then instead of a third pastry dough on top, I swapped it for a pecan brown sugar crumb (recipe here http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Cranberry-Apple-Crumble-Pie-355964) and it turned out amazing!!! Except, make sure (and maybe this was because I used a 12-inch skillet) to cook the pie longer. I took it out and realized the middle layer was not near done. I'd say add 10-15 minutes. That also could have been due to the puddle of juice that collected on the bottom. Can't say for sure. Other than that it was super tasty!!!

I do not have a cast iron skillet, so I made this in a 10 inch oven safe non-stick skillet and it worked fine.  If I make this again, I would go with a 12 inch skillet.  I followed the recipe exactly and my pie was very high and a little unwieldy to cut and serve.  Also, depending in the size of your skillet you will want to roll out the pie crusts a bit--I did not and wish I had so I could seal the edges better.  One final tip--I think next time I will try melting the butter and brushing it on the top of the crust before baking so it is evenly distributed.  I served it with whipped cream with a little sugar and cinnamon added.  Overall, the pie was easy to make and delicious, would definitely try making it again.

BEST PIE! ANd MY old pie won first place at the fair! This is way better! The ONLY change is as I slice my apples into a bowl, I put sugar a pinch if salt, the cinnamon and a little flour in with the apples and mix. It keeps apples from getting brown and is just overall easier.

I have made this dessert twice and my family LOVES it!!!!! I may try to tweak it a bit since the brown sugar and butter in the bottom causes the bottom crust to stick.

OMG!!  It is an easy recipe and oh, so good!  I had never made a pie such as this before and it came out perfect!  I love cooking in my cast iron, so this was the recipe for me.  I feel that it is foolproof!  I highly recomend it to anyone...

Unbelievably good. I made a few tweaks though and will add another tweak, even though it is good as is! Made it in one layer. And I cut the sugar down...used 1/3 of the recipe. Also added some nutmeg and a splash of vanilla. Next time I will use 1/2 the butter.  But the crust of caramelized sugar really made the recipe. A keeper!

Marvelous!-The only thing I added was a tablespoon or cornstach to the sugar mixture that was sprinkled onto the apples. Next time I will sift the cornstarch, sugar & cinnamon together.

Very, very good.  Made exactly as directed and hubby said, "this is the best pie you have ever made"  I agree.  Do however spray your skillet with cooking spray or you will not get the pie out.

I always thought I made a KILLER apple pie, but this one is easily as good!  It has winner stamped all over it!  The pie crusts I bought were 2 to a pkg. so I used all four in an 8" skillet.  At first I thought I would have a mess in the oven since this torte was pretty tall.....but it was contained in the skillet without spillage.  Bet this one would be good for the Dutch Oven Groups cook-offs.  My skillet was well-seasoned so all the brown sugar on the bottom came off with the servings.

This was absolutely delicious!  It was very easy to make with a different method than any pie I'd ever made.   Great!
