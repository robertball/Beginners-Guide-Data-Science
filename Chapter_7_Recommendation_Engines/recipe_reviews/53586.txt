I have had and made a very similar recipe which I like better AND is easier.It uses a Boboli crust,carmelized red onions(I've never needed the sugar),about half the cheese,then is sprinkled with toasted walnuts,drizzled w/olive oil and baked according to the crust instructions.I've never had leftovers!

This receipe is awesome! I love the contrast between the flavorful gorgonzola, and sweet carmelized onions! Every time I make it, people rave like you wouldn't believe! No offense to the person who mentioned that they would use a Boboli crust, but yuck! And feta cheese, while delicious, would not be good with carmelized onions, at least in my opinion. I would recommend to anyone who hasn't made this yet, stick to the recipe!

Such a wonderful and versatile base recipe to serve as is or customize to your own preferences.  Try adding VERY thin sliced pears and coarsley chopped walnuts, or mushrooms and baked garlic to the base recipe for a unique presentation.  Definitely a great appetizer for a wine tasting or a backyard bbq!  Enjoy!!!

This was a real hit with the family. However the second time I made it, it was even better when I reduced the gorgonzola by half and substituted the other half with cheddar and mozzarella. I also brushed the crust with a little olive oil about 5 minutes before taking it out of the oven and kept it under the broiler until the cheese and crust were golden brown.

Spectacular!  What a delightful recipe!  I used just over a half pound of cheese and still thought it was a little much.  I think next time I'll just go with 1/4 lb of cheese.  Gargonzola is a strong flavor so I think I can save some calories by decreasing the amount without sacrificing taste.  In fact, I bet the delicious onion flavor would shine through even more if there was less cheese.  Besides decreasing the cheese, I followed the recipe exactly.  It was quite tasty; both my husband and I loved it!  Thanks!

This was a hit at a birthday party I threw for a couple of friends. I had never had Gorgonzola cheese but found that I love it! It's a milder type of blue cheese and it went very well with the caramelized onions. It does take a while to caramelize the onions so make sure you start it in plenty of time to pop in the oven when your guests arrive. Also, I made a homemade pizza crust because it's easy and so much better than the refrigerated type.

I have searched long and hard for a great gourmet style pizza.  This is a wonderful alternative to the daily grind of classic reds.  I am a big fan of white pizza.  I’ve tried ye old classic whites which are usually a variation of olio de olive, ricotta, and  roasted garlic.  I served this pizza to my in-laws and they loved it.  We just could not stop eating this great culinary delicacy.  Everyone needs to try this.  The only thing we did different was use mozzarella in place of the gorgonzola, and didn’t not use onions………  Just kidding.  We followed the recipe to the T and it was great.  We did add a head of roasted garlic to the crust prior to adding the toppings.

This was good, but not something I could eat a whole lot of. If I could I'd probably give it more like 3 1/2 stars. I was a little pressed for time today so I bought a pizza dough from the local pizzeria. I carmelized the onions which were wonderful, then I put together the pie. I made 1/2 with just the gorgonzola and onions, (and we liked it this way )but we made the other half as another reviewer suggested with the onions, not as much gorgonzola, some mozzerella and cheddar, we liked it A LOT better this way. It was still very flavorful but not as rich.

Wow, that's some tasty pizza. I'd go a bit lighter on the cheese - it overpowered the onions a little - but otherwise it was excellent! This was enough for two 12" pizzas, one batch of pizza dough in the bread maker.  Next time I might try adding some thinly sliced pears just for kicks.

Really good, different and E-Z!  I used a Whole Wheat Pizza dough from Trader Joes and it was very good.  I only used less then half of the amount of gorgonzola cheese called for and we thought that was all it needed.  I added a few diced sun dried tomatoes because I had some I wanted to use up and like the addition to the pizza.  This would also make a great appetizer.

This was pretty good.  Served it with a green salad.  I thought about adding a sauce, thinking the pizza would need it.  It doesn't, the gorgonzola becomes like a sauce.  Oh, and I only used an 8oz chunk of gorgonzola and it was perfect.  I think much more gorgonzola would have been overpowering.

I have a variation of this recipe that is MUCH better.  You use a Boboli crust and feta cheese instead of the gorgonzola. you also sprinkle fresh tyme on the top.  I added sauteed mushrooms on my own.  I use it as an appetizer and people can't get enough.

This made a wonderful appetizer.  I followed the advice of lots of reviewers and added a layer or mozzarella cheese and only used 1/2 of the recommended Gorgonzola.  I liked the mozzarella, but I think I will add all of the Gorgonzola on top of the mozzarella next tiem.

I thought this pizza was delicious!  Following the lead of previous reviewers, I did cut the amount of cheese in half, and it was great.  I also drizzled a bit of olive oil over the pizza before baking.  I love carmelized onions but had never made them at home before.  This is so easy; it just takes awhile on the stove for the onions.  I will definitely make this again--the flavor combo is great!

Fantastic! What a gourmet pizza! A couple of things..I, too, used about 3/4 the amount of gorgonzola and actually made a larger pizza; using about 14 oz. of dough.  We used half the amount of sugar for the onions.  I would advise NOT to omit it..just use less; it creates quite a nice taste.  We also used 7 cloves of roasted garlic.  I wouldn't use fresh..the roasted (because of the sweet,caramlized taste) goes hand in hand with the onions.  A really nice addition! This is going in my recipe rotation for sure! Thanks for sharing!

I've made this several times now and I think it's one of the best pizza recipes ever. I also cut the amount of gorgonzola in half (just to not overpower guests with this, not everyone is a fan of blue cheese flavor) and add mozzarella first, then the onions and top with the gorgonzola. I just french cut the onion, no need to cut super thin or dice, they shrink down a lot and I use half olive oil and butter when sauteing onions and whole wheat dough from fresh & easy and it's just as good!! A hit everytime

This is very good. Next time I will put a thin layer of BBQ sauce on the crust before cooking. I tried dipping, and it was delicious.

Awesome! I took the advice of others and put down a layer of mozzarella first and then the onions and topped with the gorgonzola. For the crust I used Trader Joes' Middle Eastern Flatbread and less than the suggested lb of Gorgonzola for 10 flatbreads. I made this for a party last week and again last night and everyone raved about it!  Will definitely be making this one again!  Thanks, Julie!

This. Is. Heavenly. I made pita pizzas with it. I did as other reviewers and used mozzarella as a base and when the bf asked what I was making he looked very concerned but then ate it in seconds...and then ate the rest of mine. Absolutely delicious. I also added garlic and sun dried tomatoes. YUM.

We have made this several times and it's been so tasty each time! Sometimes we add asparagus on top--I know asparagus on pizza sounds weird, but it's actually delicious on this particular pizza. It looks pretty too.

This was a very good recipe! I followed other reviewers advice and used about 5 oz of gorgonzola along with some mozzarella, and honestly, I felt like it needed more gorgonzola, so next time I will use more. To those who noted that it seemed too sweet, you do not have to add the sugar to the onions, they are sweet enough w/o it. The only drawback was that it did seem to need some kind of sauce.I think next time I will make a a gorgonzola cream sauce and use that as a base. Can't wait to try it again!

This pizza was okay. The flavors are very strong, so unless you're eating it with something else (which I wasn't) then it may be a little too intense. I may make it again as an appetizer for a party or something, but not as a meal for me and the hubby because I don't think I can handle the strong flavors.

Used this recipe as a basis for my own version.  Used Boboli (whole wheat thin), dab of olive oil on top, chopped garlic, then chopped walnuts, then the onions, about 1/4 pound of gogonzola and a handful of Italian blend.  In the oven now and smells/looks wonderful!

This is AWESOME! I followed the recipe as written except with larger amounts of onions (Bermudas) and cheese. The first time I used a premade crust. The second time I made the Quick and Easy Pizza Crust recipe from this site and browned it in the oven for 10 minutes @400 (we like crispier pizza crust) before loading it up with the toppings. The whole thing took a little longer with making the crust from scratch (just over 1 hour from start to finish) but it was soooo worth it...DELISH!!

Yummy!  I made a similar type of pizza as an appetizer for last years's Christmas party, but added kalamata olives to it.  I LOVE gorgonzola!

This recipe is so delicious. It can be a meal or as an appetiser. I use a thin Boboli crust. It is easier and so good.  I make it with a garlic and vidalia onion jelly and then cheese.  Really good!

A great pizza for sure. I prefer a thinner crust so I spread mine a little more thinly. I also dipped this pizza in HONEY!!! It was delicious!

I, too, followed reviewers advice and used the quick and easy pizza crust from this site.  I reduced the gorgonzola to 5 oz. (the size of the tub in my local store) and added about 5 oz. shredded mozzarella.  Be sure to use 2 BIG onions.  Yummy!

This was wonderful!! I used 8 oz. of gorgonzola and everyone said I should have used half that and it would have been perfect.  I substituted the other 8 oz. with a pre-shredded artisan cheese blend (mozerella and provolone) and added sauteed mushrooms (8oz) to the pizza as well.  Will definitely make again, using 4 oz. of gorgonzola.

Sooo good! With such little work and quite cheap too. I made two pizzas and a quarter of the cheese recommended was enough for both, so you definitely don't need a pound, it's potent stuff. I caramelised the onions without the sugar, the added some chopped wallnuts. They were ready in a jiffy and so tasty we mmmm-ed all through dinner. Mental note: perfect party finger food.

Don't get me wrong... I LOVE gorgonzola.  However, this recipe used WAY too much!  It would have been much better with 1/4 Lb. instead of a full Lb.

I used whole wheat pizza dough from Trader Joe's.  Reduced the gorgonzola to 1/2 lb, as others suggested and also added a bit of mozzarella.  I also added chopped walnuts.  The flavor was absolutely delicious-- my guests loved it.  However, I think that the pizza needs to cook at a higher temperature because my dough was still a little raw after 15 minutes at 425.  I upped it to 500 for the second pizza and 12 minutes at that temp. worked well.  Leftovers tasted great but didn't look as good.  Will probably make again, with some variations.

Reduce the cheese to 1/2 or 3/4 lb.  I also added mushrooms and several cloves of roasted garlic.  Sliced grilled chicken might not be too bad and maybe fontina instead...I guess the possibilites are endless!  Very good.

An absolutely wonderful combination - used 3/4 of the amount of Gorgonzola suggested and it tasted heavenly. In fact, have had several requests from friends to make it for their parties. Thanks!

I am a huge cheese lover but this was waaaaaay too much cheese. I made it 2 weeks ago and I still can't stomach the taste of garganzola after making this. I will say had I used 1/2 LB cheese it would have been pretty great, but for an appetizer or finger-food at a party.  I do not recommend this for the main dish for dinner, it's just way too heavy.

This is very similar to a recipe I got years ago from, I think, Cooking Light.  It is one of my favorites.  I love the combination of sweet, caramelized onions and the heady pungency of the Gorgonzola.  I too sometimes substitute a Boboli.  But I would not use a refrigerated pizza dough.  (Because I've never found one that was very good.)  So either make your own from scratch, or use a Boboli.  Also, the original used, as I recall, a thin layer of ricotta over the dough, and some fresh thyme mixed in with the onions while they're cooking.  Scratch the sugar, and add salt and fresh-ground black pepper to taste.

I used a mixture of butter and olive oil to caramelize the onions and let them cool before putting them on the dough. I get my dough from our local Italian market. I only had Danish blue cheese and I also added fresh rosemary. It was out of this world and will be made again in our house.

very good! my onions took a lot longer to carmelize than stated, but I suspected they would. I used much less Gorgonzola (about 6oz I think), I prebaked crust as package directed, removed from oven and brushed with garlic and herb basting oil. then put my onions and cheese on.  Like the flavor combo, and actually inspired me to get creative with pizza.

Totally delish, but did make it on sheets of puff pastry. When I pulled it out of the oven I cut it up into little squares and served it as finger food at parties in our flat in Berlin. Yum, brings back memories. Thanks for the recipe.

A-freaking-MAZING!  Absolutely delicious!  The first time I made it, I didn't put as much Gorgonzola because I didn't have enough and it came out awesome.  The second time I made it, I put 10oz (less than the pound that is called for) and it was way too much.  Definitely use less and it will be perfect. :)

I thought the flavors were way too strong and didn't have much complexity. It was very sweet, and there was too much gorgonzola; it didn't do justice to the cheese. (I love gorgonzola by itself.) Maybe this pizza is just an acquired taste.

I agree with a lot of the other posts in that the gorgonzola needs to be decreased for our tastes. I also added chicken and some mozzarella cheese to mine. Amazing!!

This recipe was delicious with a few modifications: I used about half the gorgonzola cheese (and even that was a bit strong but I guess it depends on your taste) and like some other reviewers suggested combined the gorgonzola with a mix of shredded cheddar and mozzarella.  It made it much more delicious and didn't taste like it had cheddar or mozz in it at all - just created a nice background for the gorgonzola.    I used store bought whole wheat pizza dough from Trader Joe's and seasoned it with salt, pepper and olive oil before adding the toppings.  I used a mandolin to get paper thin, almost shredded, onion slices.  This made it more like an onion jam at the bottom.  Overall this was delicious - the leftovers made a perfect lunch the next day when heated up in the toaster oven.  Would also like to try this as tartlets, perhaps on puff pastry shells for an appetizer.

Strong cheeses (such as gorgonzola) are an acquired taste for many. You will not like this recipe if you don't care for them. That said, this is probably not something I would make for guests or take to a party just out of fear that too many people would not care for it.  I thought this pizza was delicious. I reduced the gorgonzola to 12 oz. and I can't imagine using any more than that. Even at 12 oz. the taste was still pretty overpowering. Next time I make this I will probably use 2 1/2 onions and about 3-4 oz. of gorgonzola cheese. I may even try making this with a different crumbled cheese such as feta (my favorite). I brushed olive oil over the crust, but next time I think I'll brush olive oil over the entire top since the pizza does not call for an actual sauce. I might add some garlic powder as well. I'll top it with the onions, another cheese (probably mozzarella), and I'll use the crumbled cheese sparingly.  I used homemade crust (Jay's Signature Pizza Crust from this website) and added extra sugar to the dough to make a sweet crust. I wish I had rolled my edges out a little thicker. Otherwise, this pizza would have been perfect. I can't wait to try it again with the above alterations.

Too much butter, and FAR too much Gorgonzola as written! I cut way back on both, added a little diced prosciutto, and was mostly ok with the outcome. I used between 2 and 3 oz. of Gorgonzola. Thanks for the recipe, this was fun to try out :-)

I absolutely agree that a little gorgonzola cheese goes a long way!  The next time I make this I'll probably only use 1/4 lb cheese.  Other then that, I thought it was really good.  I sliced some tomatoes and put them on the pizza to add something extra, and really liked it.

I really really liked the idea of this pizza - and I think that if you make modifications, it could be great!  But, since I don't think that this recipe is great as is, I'm only giving it 2 stars - which is how it should work!  Next time, I'll add olive oil and garlic powder to the crust as a sauce, and I'll cover the pizza in the onions, with mozz cheese, and then just sprinkle the gorgonzola cheese over that.  The flavors go really well together, but the gorgonzola over the entire pizza, and in the amount specified was WAY too much for our tastes!

I listened to what everyone said in the other reviews and I reduced the amount of gorgonzola chesse to about 1/3 cup (this is a very strong chesse) and then used about 1 to 1 1/2 cup of mozzarella and only one large vidalia onion. I also added turkey pepperoni on top of the carmelized onions and toppped it off with the cheese. I used a already made crust brushed with olive oil. My kids and hubby ate this pizza up quick. Thanks for the recipe.

This was absolutely amazing!  We subbed mozzarella for about 1/3 of the gorgonzola.  This recipe is a keeper!

Yum! I made this with the "quick and easy pizza crust" from this site. I'll agree with past reviewers though- I only had about half of the cheese the recipe called for (which was perfect) and I do believe that the whole amount would be wayyyyyy too much cheese!

Good recipe, good idea. Incidentally, the toppings work well on a good bread, too, if you don't have time to make a crust. A new twist on grilled cheese sandwiches!

This is a very good pizza but definitely reduce the amount of gorgonzola. I reduce it by about half and substitute mozzarella for the other half. I also use the Quick and Easy Pizza Crust recipe from this site. Turns out amazing.

I really want to be positive about this recipe. But, this is by far, the worst recipe I have gotten from this website. I followed the recipe and maybe should have consulted other reviews beforehand because you shouldn't use even a quarter of the cheese it calls for. It absolutely ruins it. My advice is to use all the suggestions you can when making this recipe.

I messed up the pizza dough on this, but that was my fault, not the recipe.  Even still, it was very good (so, I'm going to guess if I had not messed up the crust, it would have been great).   The caramelized onion and gorgonzola are a great combination.

NEW EDIT:  I tried it again, didn't mess up the crust this time, and yes it was great.

I love this, in fact I made it so much that I am sick of it right now, but I know I will be craving it again soon!  The bad part is that I am the only one in my house that will touch the gorgonzola cheese so I usually wait until I have a friend over to make it, otherwise I will eat the whole thing!

very nice! i used 1/2 lb of gorgonzola cheese, i can't even imagine using a whole pound and i like my cheese! made my own dough for the first time which was very easy and delicious! i though 1 onion would be enough for 1 pizza, but caramelizing really shrinks them down and 2 onions is necessary!

We really enjoyed this. I used a Boboli crust because I needed to make this quickly and it turned out quite nicely, actually. I used less than half the amount of gorgonzola and used mozzarella as a filler cheese. I love blue cheeses, but what I used was more than enough. My young kids made a face at it, but tried it and liked it just fine.

I really liked this recipe. I wasn't sure about it, but I did make some changes. I used Jay's Signature Pizza Crust (from allrecipes.com) instead of frozen dough. I cut down a but on the onions (probably shouldn't have), I used crumbled blue cheese, added sliced greek olives, and used brown sugar instead of white. I loved how the cheese complimented the sweet onions!!!

Incredible.  I've cooked this so many times and it gets gobbled up by adults and preteens alike.  Depending on availability in the grocery store, I substitute gorgonzola with another blue cheese like Roquefort with the same outstanding results.

As gorgonzola lovers we expected to enjoy this pizza, but even for us it was too much.  Way too overpowering for the delicate onion flavor.  I would use a blend of cheese, and use gorgonzola more as a "topping" rather than the main flavor.  It could use some other flavors, perhaps some roasted tomato or fresh basil.

Really good, tho I made some changes. I used pizza dough from trader joe's, sprinkled parmesan cheese on the dough and baked for about 10 mins. Carmelized my onions with pinenuts, butter and fresh garlic. Added that with gorgonzola cheese and mozzarella cheese and cooked for about 15 mins. It was awesome!

I used pita bread vs. the pizza crust!  Break apart the pita bread to 4" pieces and cook only 5-7 minutes until the cheese is melted and the edges of the pita bread is crusty!!

I absolutely love this recipe. I find that it's fine without adding any sugar, if you cook it long enough. It naturally becomes very sweet while being caramelized.
Thank you for this recipe!

This pizza came out great. I used one of those Kraft crumbles packets that contains feta, parmesan, and provolone cheeses.  It was delicious, and it was nice and easy.  Next time I will try it with the gorgonzola. This is an excellent recipe! Thanks!

I thought the gorgonzola was very overpowering.   I would probably try again but cut way back on the cheese, maybe adding some mozzarella or parmesan as well.  I also added some Italian seasoning and a drizzle of olive oil.

Really good!  I love the contrast of the sweet onion and salty gorgonzola.  I used red onion because Vidalia's were unavailable.  I made a personal pizza for myself using this recipe, and the Amazing Whole Wheat Pizza Crust from this site.  I divided the crust into 4 to make 4 small pizzas because the rest of the fam doesn't like gorgonzola (put other toppings on theirs).  I only used one onion (but it was huge) and had some leftover which I will save for something else.  Used about 4 oz. of gorgonzola.  I've been wanting to try this recipe for a long time and I'm glad I finally did!

Following the advice of other reviewers, I cut WAY back on the cheese. I used 4 oz. (which is one of those plastic tubs they often sell the cheese in) and it was just right. The crust was a bit soggy. I think perhaps my pizza pan was on the small side so I'll use a cookie sheet next time.

The onions were great, and I enjoyed the pieces that had very little cheese on them. Easy prep, was able to make as guests were arriving.Gave it 3 stars because my guests really enjoyed it, but I won't be making it again.

I was so disappointed....  maybe my expectation was too high...  The cheese overpowered the whole pizza and everyone thought it was waaay too much of gongonzola cheese...  I'll make it with the half of cheese next time..

The onions were delicious. Half the pizza I did as is. It was good, but the gorgonzola was a little strong for my taste. On the other half, I cut the gorgonzola down to about 75%. I then sprinkled a mixture of gouda/cheddar and then some thin apple slices on top. I preferred the side with my modifications.

LOVED THIS! I used 'ricardo's pizza crust' from this site for the crust and prebaked it slightly. I brushed the crust w/ olive oil before taking some reviewers' advice and topping that with some shredded mozzarella before putting on the onions and gorgonzola cheese. I am a gorgonzola cheese lover, but even I knew that was gonna be too much for us. I used almost a whole 4oz. container and that was perfect, IMO. The sweetness of the onions with the sharp flavor from the cheese, just made this wonderful. I will definately be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I baked to dough before putting everything on for 10 minutes to get it extra crispy.  I also added grilled chicken.  I thought the recipe was delish but the hubs didn't think so.  I hate when that happens.

My husband and I were not fans of this pizza.  Having only the Gorgonzola cheese was an over powering taste.  If I were to ever make this again, I would sparingly use the gorgonzola cheese with another more mild cheese.

I used whole wheat pitas instead of the pizza dough just because I had them already, splenda instead of reg. sugar, and i added chopped sun dried tomatoes. Would definitely make again.

This was very tasty!  I halfed the gorgonzola per some suggestions and brushed the crust with a little bit of olive oil before adding the onions and cheese.  Next time, instead of eating this pizza for dinner (because there will definitely be a NEXT TIME), I think I will cut it into small squares and serve it as an appetizer or snack for a party!  Really Good!

Ugh! I had such high hopes for this recipe, but it did not taste good at all!  I followed the recipe very closely, only adding walnuts and combining mozzarella and gorgonzola, like many reviewers suggested.  It seemed like it had potential, but something was just not right.  That being said, I left the basically-untouched pizza out and tried some the next day before tossing, and the taste seemed to have marginally improved.

I make a pizza very simular to this but I saute bacon and put on top with the cheese and onions. The taste holds up well but does not over power the other flavors.

The Gorgonzola cheese is really strong, so you only need a few ounces.  It might be nice to dilute it with some Parmesan or other complementary cheese.  The caramelized onions were a big hit (though time consuming).

I only used about 5 oz. of gorgonzola and it was still WAY too much. I would recommend just a sprinkle of gorgonzola, or forget it completely and use parmesean. I also sprinkled some walnuts on top which was good. Probably a better appetizer than a main entree.

I am amazed that something so simple could be this good.  I was worried the gorgonzola would be too rich, but the sweet onions really balanced it.  I added chicken to make it a full meal in itself.  Fancy enough to serve to guests, but easy!

Holy Deliciousness!!  This was soooo good I've come to crave it.  I actually hate gorgonzola and blue cheese, so I used smoked mozzerella and it's an amazing combo.  Don't forget toasted walnuts.  You should definantly try it

A four only because we added chicken ,mushrooms and potato along with Mozzarella. It would have been very dry otherwise.

Followed the recipe exactly.  We were not really care for this.  I love blue cheese but this was overkill for us.  Plus it seemed to be missing something.  Maybe some sort of sauce would be better for us.  Thanks anyway.

I've been wanting to try this for months and finally decided to give it a go tonight. Wow!  This is such a wonderful combination of flavors - I agree with others... there's no way you'd end up using a whole pound of gorgonzola. That'd ruin the beauty of this recipe.  I think I'll add more onions next time (mine weren't very big) and forego adding the sugar as they're sweet enough on their own.  I used a whole wheat pita. I also like the idea of adding sauteed mushrooms and toasted walnuts.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I love gorgonzola and I love caramelized onions and I really wanted to love this... but I only used half the gorgonzola and the cheese was still WAY TOO OVERPOWERING.  The first piece was good but by the second it tasted almost bitter (and yes, the cheese was fresh).  When I got a bite of pizza crust with just a little cheese and onion it was really delicious though.  I'm going to try again with some other reviewer suggestions such as thinning the cheese with mozzarella because I know this could taste good...

Delicious and easy dinner! I made my own whole wheat pizza crust, which was a nice complement to the flavors. 

I doubt I used a whole pound of gorgonzola- I just sprinkled a thin covering on top of the onions.

My husband and I ate this and we really enjoyed it. The cheese is really strong so you have to enjoy the flavor.  I'm sure I'll make it again in the future.

I thought this pizza was really good although I did change a few things from the original.  I took others suggestions and decreased the gorgonzola by half and substitued mozzarella, but felt maybe I shouldn't have cut back that much.  I also added diced chicken and toasted walnuts to the pizza.  The chicken I could have done with out becuase it didn't add much to the flavor, but the toasted walnuts were a perfect addition and complemented the flavors well.  I also used a homemade pizza crust which was very easy.  I followed "Valentino's" which is on this website.  This pizza would make a great appetizer if you cut the pizza into little squares.

I used only 1/4 pound of the Gorgonzola and 1/4 mozzarella.  I think next time, I will use slightly less Gorgonzola.  I threw in some minced garlic with the onions.  Very very yummy!
