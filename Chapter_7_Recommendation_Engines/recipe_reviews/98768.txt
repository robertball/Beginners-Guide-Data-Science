Excellent recipe! My oldest got his first deer this year. The first recipe we tried was this one. The one modification I made was to shake the venison cubes in a mixture of flour, salt, pepper, garlic and onion powders and quickly fry them in canola oil before adding to the pot. Then I deglazed the pan with beef stock and added that to the stew. Delicious!

I am very impressed with this simple recipe. I didn't have venison or the browning sauce so I used beef and added in some spices and hot sauce. It is delicious!  I think next time I will brown the beef separately to try and separate out the fat easier. 
I started this at night and put it on low overnight and waking up to these delicious aromas was heaven! I couldn't wait to dive in!

This was excellent and very easy to put together. I used parsley instead of the browning and seasoning sauce and omitted the peas. I served it with warm bread. The meat was very tender and flavorful. I'll make this again.

I had to find a food to make that my husband who hates venison would enjoy. We ate it, and i said wow, you would never know this was venison. He said it is... Then scarfed down a huge amount of seconds. The only thing i did differently was that i added the juice from two cans of corn in the beggining, then the corn last with the peas and mushrooms.. This is a keeper

This was edible but not impressive.  First off it was WAY too big to even come close to fitting in my crock pot, so unless you have a huge crock pot you need to halve the recipe.  I had to transfer everything to a dutch oven and cook it in the oven.  The "sauce" also didn't have much flavor, it definitely needs some more spices in there, and I think it would work better with a roux than the corn starch as a thickener.  I'm going to keep looking for a good stew recipe, sorry but this didn't cut it.

I only made a 1/2 recipe and it filled my crockpot, glad I didn't try to fit the whole thing in it. This is a good start for a stew but the taste was just very bland. Needs.... something, I just haven't figured out what yet.

Cut some venison round steak and used that. Family raved about how it was the best stew ever!! DH ate 3 helpings and the teen who only tolerates my cooking ate 2 helpings. Will definately make again. Be sure that you have a LARGE crock pot or it will not fit.

This was wonderful stew!  It made more than my crock pot could hold, so I had to transfer some to a pot on the stove before adding peas and mushrooms.  That's not a problem, though, and I was very pleased with it overall.

OK so I haven't tried this recipe yet but plan on it, however I do frequently make stew in the crockpot with our venison.  I've taken recently to adding a package of dried brown gravy mix to the crock pot and it somehow thickens up the liquid nicely.

It cracks me up when I see someone deduct a star because the "venison" was tough.  I could cook rubber in my crock-pot and it would be falling apart it would be so tender.  I suggest anyone who has "tough" meat come out of their crock-pot...to get a new crock-pot.  I have 4 crocks and I use the cheapest one the most...got it when they first came out.  My meat is always fall-apart tender.

I personally did not like this dish. I am apparantley not a fan of venison. However, my Husband and his Dad & Uncles loved it. Followed the recipe exactly except for mushrooms. The meat was tender and moist. The sauce had plenty of flavor for my simple husband. (I did not eat anything but the carrots.) If we are ever given venison again, I will likely make this for the guys again, I'll eat other leftovers!

I used elk meat diced very small by the butcher. As for the veggies, I only used potatoes, onions, and carrots because I was in a hurry.  I used chicken bullion dissolved in water as I did not have beef broth. It turned out great! I really liked the parts of this recipe that I did use, and if I have the opportunity to cook with venison or elk meat again, I'll definitely try to follow this recipe more closely as it already provided me with the basis for a really tasty stew.

This was wonderful!! Will definitely make again. I make a seafood dip that has canned clams in it I always drain the liquid and freeze it for future use, this was the perfect recipe to use all that clam juice in my freezer, time to start collecting it again!!

It was my first time making venison stew (actually my first time cooking venison) and the stew tasted good. We added turnips, and left the peas and mushrooms out. We thought it could be fun to add more spices next time but overall tasted great. Venison didn't have a gamey flavor and was very tender. We cooked it on high for 5 hours.

Loved this recipe! I am not a huge venison fan but my husband is an avid hunter and loves it, I will definitly be cooking this again. I used McCormick slow cooker beef stew seasoning instead of browning seasoning. I also left out the extra water. Great recipe.

A good solid start.  There was too much volume for my slow cooker so I divided it into two batches.  I added garlic and a small dried red chili to first batch but it still needs something more for spices and flavour....going to experiment more with second batch...

A very good stew. I didn't have mushrooms on hand but will add them next time. I did not add the salt as we shouldn't have it, but a good amount of pepper. I think I will try a little less cornstarch next time and perhaps some fresh herbs. Other veggies in refrig. would be good to add - parsnips for instance. My husband was happy to have this tasty stew made using his venison.
