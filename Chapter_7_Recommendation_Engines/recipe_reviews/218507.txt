I've been making mixed greens for years and have never come across a recipe that calls for sugar. I honestly planned to add the sugar, but when push came to shove, I couldn't do it. Instead, I sweetened greens the way I always have: caramelized onions. I diced one large onion and cooked it in olive oil (I didn't have vegetable oil, but olives are veggies, right?). Anyway, I sauteed them over low heat for 25 minutes... until the onions turned lightly brown. Caramelized onions will sweeten anything with a depth that can make you swoon. So okay... I couldn't bring myself to resort to sugar. My tried and true worked just fine. The end result was tasty indeed.

I washed and rinsed the greens in broth, as directed but I'm not sure the broth made any difference. I didn't add 2 c. of broth to the pot because covered greens will steam — using the pot's heat — making for denser vitamins and minerals. And the cooking time is a little less without added water or brother (closer to 40 minutes than an hour. I added the garlic toward the end of the cooking to avoid burning it. The bacon bits were a nice addition to my usual recipe (I normally add a small amount of red pepper flakes), so that made for a nice change. I can give it a recommendation to try it (ideally with caramelized onions): mixed greens are so very good for you!

So-so recipe, but I never add sugar. I use smoked turkey wings ( normally just one) for seasoning instead of ham hocks or salt pork. Boil the wings until the meat falls off the bone and all them to the greens to cook. I will add seasoning salt & pepper, some red pepper flakes, and a dash of garlic powder.

Made thee for New Years dinner and they were TERRIFIC - would highly recommend this recipe to all my friends. I only used collards and turnip greens though since I'm not a fan of mustard greens. Also used ham hock instead of bacon bits. My daughter who isn't a fan of greens ate them like crazy and even ate somemore the next day. Even told me to make sure I save this recipe for futue use. And my almost 2 year old grandson couldn't get enough of them. Far cry from the 'mess' I attempted last year - will definetly be making these again.

I agree.  I'd never add 1/2 cup sugar.  I don't need
sweet greens.  If I want to bring out the flavor of veggies with sugar, I usually add a very small amount.  If I needed it any sweeter than a couple of tsp. would add, then I'd certainly caramalize the onions rather than use sugar.  I don't care for bacon bits, but if I needed pork flavor, I'd fry out 2 - 3" slices of salt pork, fry it,
and then put the cooked pieces in my pot of greens; just don't over do the added salt.

I also omitted the sugar in favor of onions that I carmelized in the bacon grease. Instead of boiling, I sautéed using less liquid in a covered pan. All I had was turnip greens and kale, but it worked just fine. Delish, thanks for the recipie and the review comments!

I was unable to cook exactly to the recipe. I didn't have all the ingredients available. But this recipe was the perfect inspiration for my very first attempt. I do not like greens. Never have, but after this recipe, I have changed my mind. The changes I made were: did not soak greens (only had collards and turnip greens from CSA box), used caramelized onions (used butter in lieu of oil) instead of sugar, used 2 tsp mined garlic, used two cans chicken broth, and finally, cooked everything in a cast iron pan/Dutch oven that I inherited from my late grandmother. Cooking time itself was about the same as recipe. I didn't really pay it that much attention. Oh, added salt to taste but no pepper (my palate is weird and doesn't react well to pepper). My husband gives it two thumbs up and I ate all but the portion my husband had. It was even good cold the next day! Thank you!

This is my first time to ever fix greens. I received 10 oz. mustard greens, 10 oz. turnip greens, and not quite 16 oz. collards in my CSA box. I cut this recipe in half and followed the directions...all except for the amount of sugar. I added only 1 T. and it was perfect.

I actually added the sugar and it was a good touch. Halfway through the cooking I took a taste and thought to add the sugar it was a good decision. This recipe was a success for my Sunday dinner

I loved these. I only had turnip greens, other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I served them with grilled lamb chops for Easter dinner.  My friend who is very picky and an excellent cook said they were the best greens she ever ate. My husband couldn't get enough . Thank you for submitting this. I had never cooked greens before and the directions were easy.

My recipe is very simular. I add turnips and bacon grease. Only 1 cup of chicken broth. The greens and turnips make their own juices and we love the taste just like that. Sometimes I add a dash of vinegar to my serving. Good ole southern eating with some brown beans, homemade cornbread and fried potatoes. Yum! This is a regular staple at our house.

I might use less sugar next time. Very easy to make. Used a chicken bullion paste. Kids loved it. Used with mustard greens and beet green tops. Yummy!

It's been such a long time since I last made a pot of greens using my grandmother's tried and true methodology that I sought out a 5-star recipe that matched up close enough to her word of mouth recipe that it caught my attention.  Yes, indeed, this recipe is perfect, minus the sugar.  I too use caramelized onions, and the final result made all taste buds do a happy dance!  Excellent recipe and it's good to have one in writing since my recollection is mental recipes is diminishing with age!  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe truly is the most "Perfect Greens" I have ever eaten.  I did reduce the amount of sugar to two sugar packets and they were still wonderful.

I added a bit based on another rewiewer's comments.  I added the carmelized onions and  red pepper flakes.  It had just a bit of heat which worked wonderfully with the sweet onions.  Served with sweet Brioche toast, fabulous!

First time ever cooking greens. I will make this recipe again with changes. No broth soak, but i did use about 2 cups of mushroom stock - added great flavor. I added 1 lb chopped bacon - let it render down and brown the bacon. I removed about 1/3 cup of bacon grease and left rest for the recipe. No oil used. I also added about 3/4 cup leftover pulled pork. Chopped and added 2 small sweet onions, about 1/4  cup of apple cider vinegar, reduced sugar to 2 heaping tablespoons. I got my greens from a client, so I'm not sure if my greens volume was in keeping with the recipe. The results were awesome!

For the love of Southern style or soul  food, DO NOT put 1/2 cup of sugar in greens.  Ever! You can add a little vinegar or I like rice wine vinegar, depending on your taste try Apple Cider Vinegar. A pinch of red pepper flakes.

This recipe was delicious. Based on what I had on hand, I made some changes. First, I used only turnip greens because I just thinned the turnips in my garden. I did not have enough to make a full recipe, so I ended up reducing everything down to 1/4 the full recipe. I used beef broth instead of chicken broth. Instead of oil and bacon bits, I just used some diced bacon. I cooked up the bacon with the garlic and then added the turnip greens that had been soaked and continued as the recipe said. Fantastic and so easy!  I will definitely make this again.

I chose make my own bacon bits. Used the bacon drippings instead of veg. oil. Reduced the amount of salt sugar. Out of this world.
