I made two minor changes. I used a whole chicken instead of a turkey and smoked it with an oak/hickory blend instead of the pecan. The apple juice and wine combo kept this super moist and one I highly recommend. The one thing I will mention is that the rub on the outside of the bird makes the skin look burnt in the end but it isn't really. Not pretty to look out but super tasty. Excellent recipe!
