I was excited to try this different method of cooking chicken.  I have to say I'm disappointed with the results.  The skin ended up really soggy, so we took it off (and therefore lost all the seasoning as well).  I have to imagine that the salt and pepper amounts were a typo...I used far less than 2 tablespoons.  The onion was ok, but it didn't particularly add anything to the chicken, nor was it anything special by itself.  If you're looking for yummy baked onion, try Vidalia Heaven on this site.  This recipe wasn't bad, it just wasn't special.  On the plus side, this was a quick and easy recipe, both in prep and cleanup.  If I make this again, I'll make the following changes:  use skinless chicken, add some paprika for color, and add some carrots and green beans along with the onion for additional color/flavor.  Thanks for the recipe.

Easily a 5 star recipe because it's soooo easy and good. I've been trying lots of different recipes for drumsticks lately and none of them have done anything for me. This one is awesome. I'll make this all the time for sure.

You really have to be hungry to eat the chicken. It can taste better if you add a DASH of salt and pepper.

This was a very delicious recipe with some nice kick to it! I only used half the called for amount for the salt and pepper. I put the S/P and allspice into a bag and shook the chicken in it, to coat. I also sauteed the onions and garlic for a few minutes before adding it to the chicken.

I added a few more spices to the chicken (dash of ground sage and paprika), and used onion and garlic powders instead of fresh. The chicken turned out AMAZING! This is by far the most delicious way I've baked chicken. The aluminum foil is a great idea, as it really allows the spices to infuse into the drumsticks. I would probably take the foil off the chicken 5-10 minutes earlier in the future because I like my drumsticks a little crispier, but they were still fabulous. Also, I used kosher drumsticks, which I have found to be juicier. Great recipe, and I will definitely be making this again soon!!

This simple recipe makes fantastic drumsticks. I couldn't help but to tamper with the seasonings by using salt, pepper, poultry seasoning, garlic powder, and paprika after removing the skin. Next time I will sauté the onions and garlic a bit before adding them.

This was so much fun to make!! I just used drum sticks and cooked them for 40 min. The taste was to die for and I can't wait to make it again. Adding the onions and garlic at the last 10 min. made the Chicken taste so very good.

Yum! I will probably add the onion and garlic earlier next time, only because I am used to 'saucy' dishes which are very spicy and flavoursome. This was a lovely and welcomed change for me!

We love this recipe!!! But instead of using just plain pepper we use Garlic Pepper. Mmm it comes out so good. It also is not very hard at all. The recipe is quick and good for those days that I do not have a lot of time to spend in the Kitchen

The chicken itself was very moist & tender but it was wayyyy too much pepper & salt - and I used less than called for. My husband loves pepper but it was too much even for him.  I may try a variation next time using different spices.

The chicken was tender and juicy, but there was way too much salt and pepper. I would decrease the salt/pepper by half. I also included some asparagus in with the chicken during the last 5 minutes, and it turned out great. Cleanup was a breeze.

This chicken dish is tasty.  I removed the skin and then seasoned it by sprinkling with salt and pepper.  Then I also added some tyme, margarom, rosemary.  The pouch keeps the chicken moist and tender.  In order to brown the chicken I baked it longer without the foil, and camelize the onion, i would saute it, like mentioned in other reviews.

3.5! Very easy. I think using slightly less onion would suffice. It overwhelms a bit. I did take advice of others and saute the onions and garlic a little first and I think that really helped!

Just delicious and really fast to prepare. A life saver when you are press for time. The chicken comes juicy and with great flavor. This will be a weekly treat for us. My husband loved it. Can't wait to try it with different spices and some vegies.

I gave this a three, because I had to do so many other things to it.  I added white wine and butter and basted the drumsticks with it.  Also near the end of the cooking time the chicken wasn't crunchy in fact it looked kind of gross, so I turned the oven up and broiled the chicken for about 5 minutes.  The flavor was ok.  One good thing was that hubby liked it, which is amazing because he hates dark meat.

Never would have thought of using allspice in a chicken recipe, but wow, does it add an extra kick. I've made it with both leg quarters and with thighs, and it's turned out great both ways. I don't measure the salt, pepper, or allspice; rather I liberally sprinkle the spices onto each piece of chicken from the shaker. I also add garlic powder at the start then add the minced garlic later. 

The result is tender, juicy, tasty chicken, and using the foil to line the pan means easy cleanup too.  This has become my go-to chicken recipe when I want something quick and easy.

I didn't care for this.  Maybe I did something wrong?  The only change I made was that I used chicken tenderloins instead of the chicken the recipe calls for.  It turned out very dry and my family didn't care for it too much.  Maybe it works better with the chicken with bone in it.  Might try it that way again but not with tenderloins.

This was really a tasty, healthy chicken dish. I made a few changes... slicing the onion into half rings instead. (purely for looks) Also, I added fresh spinach at the same time I added the onions... I tossed them on the chicken- delicious!!!!

I will not make this again. The taste was just ok but the appearance was not at all appealing.  I cut the s/p to 1 tsp each.  After 40 min at 390 degrees, the chicken was still very red.  Same thing after another 20 min.  I turned the heat to 425 and baked another 30 minutes. My husband said he would not want it again and he loves chicken.

I gave this three stars. Needs to cook longer than suggested.  I used less salt and pepper than called for and I sauted the onions and garlic before adding it to the chicken.  I like the allspice flavor with the chicken.  It's good, but needs more flavor.  I will make some changes if I cook this again.

I made a few changes in the specific spices, but I found the bake underwhelming and had to finish the chicken on the stovetop.

This receipe has become a hit with my home. I love it!!!! The first time I used a mixture of chicken parts and it was good. But I mostly use chicken wings/drumettes, where they are awesome. I also at place cut onions on the bottom of pan before I place the chicken and add onions as receipe calls at the end. Cut up green peppers is good added to it. One other things I am going to try is use the seasoning with turkey wings and see how it goes, think it will be great. Will let all know :)

I was disappointed with this recipe. The chicken tasted like nothing but pepper, LOTS OF PEPPER. I was going by the measurements provided and I think you need to use less salt and pepper. I couldn't really eat the chicken and enjoy it like I thought I would. Will use less spices next time.
