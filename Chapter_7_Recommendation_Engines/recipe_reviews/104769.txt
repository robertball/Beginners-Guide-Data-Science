This was wonderful - but I changed it a bit.  I added onions, and used Italian salad dressing and substituted sour cream for the feta.  Was delish!

This recipe was very easyand very delicous! I didn't have greek dressing on hand but i did have roasted red pepper and garlic vinegarette and pre-made pesto. I used 1/2 cup dressing, 1 tbsp pesto and 1 tablespoon garlic and herb spreadable cheese (to thicken it up). I also only used 3 oz of black olives and it was more than enough! it turned out great, a new weekly meal!

Not only was this dish delicious, but it's sooooo easy to prepare are caveman could it. Frying the frozen breasts was fine, so long as you don't crowd the frypan. I also used the italian dressing and I happened to have a jar of artichokes on hand so I drained and threw them in too. The artichokes added another nice dimension to the dish.

This recipe was FABULOUS!!!  I'm only giving it 4 stars because I changed some of the ingredients, so I don't know how many stars it would be if you followed the recipe exactly.  The way I prepared it was definitely 5 stars and my hubby asked me to put it on weekly rotation!  While browning the chicken in the skillet, I added garlic and fresh cut onions.  I also added oregano along with the salt,pepper and greek seasonings while browning.  I couldn't get the chicken to cook all the way through without the outside getting too brown, so I cooked it most the way through and let it finish cooking while it was simmering with the tomatoes and green beans.  I used the canned tomatoes that have oregano and stuff in them (more italian).  And instead of using the greek salad dressing, I used fat free italian (low cal and delish).  I also added marinated mushrooms and omitted the olives (didn't have those on hand, plus the hubby doesn't like them).  I can't say it was the most visually appealing meal, but it was definitely one of the most tasty!

The directions were a little confusing on this one to me. I wasn't really comfortable leaving frozen chicken over medium high heat but it didn't say to turn it down or cover until the very end. Also, I had no idea what Greek seasoning was, so I looked for it in the grocery store, and no luck. I ended up making my own from a recipe I found on line(which has salt and pepper in it so I skipped that in the recipe). Not difficult, just one more step the first time you make this recipe. It turned out great though. I would add an extra can of green beans next time. Oh, and I melted Feta cheese over all at the end. Great flavor.

This recipe was GREAT!! I did a few variations, I added Greek kalamata olives instead of black. I also added some cumin, great flavor. I did find Greek seasoning at the Piggy wiggly, yellow container with red lettering, called Cavender's all purpose Greek Seasoning. Also found at the Pig Good Seasons Greek Vinaigrette dressing with feta cheese. Make this at least once a week!! Delicious!!

I just made this tonight and I'll be honest, the ingredients made me skeptical but it was YUMMY and super easy to make.  I cleaned my plate and my 3 year old is still sopping her's up as I type.  My husband wasn't hungry but after he tasted it he requested a whole plate!  I followed the advice of throwing in a jar of artichokes and really liked it.  I didn't use any black olives.

I followed the recipe almost exactly but I didn't have greek dressing so I used balsamic vinaigrette and added some feta cheese.  I also added a can of white beans to add a little more fiber.  Soooooo good.

I made it by the recipe(couldn't find Greek seasoning, used garlic powder & oregano instead)and served it over brown rice with extra feta on top.  Next time I'll use chicken tenderloins instead of breasts to speed the cooking process. My guys loved this! It's definitely a keeper.

Yummy and very quick!  I replaced the olives with black beans, omitted the Greek seasoning, and used stewed tomatoes (garlic and herb variety), as that's what I had on hand.  This recipes definitely lends itself to wonderful modifications.

This recipe needs help, badly.  I followed the recipe but added the artichokes as someone suggested.  DO NOT add canned green beans.  It added a strange flavor to the dish because they’re packed in brine/sugar and that was even with draining it.  I think the idea is good, but I’d add onions, wine and use a different olive than black.  My family turned their noses up at this one and asked that they not see it again.

Went with a generous sprinkling of greek seasoning, salt, and pepper and drained some oil oil off before adding the vegetables. The chicken was moist and nicely seasoned. The vinegar in the sauce brought out great flavor in the beans and olives.

I don't usually make so many changes, but I used this recipe as a base for leftover roast chicken and had to use what I had on hand. It was delicious! We love Costco garlic/jalapeno olives so I used those, cut into slices and actual tomatoes that needed to be cooked. And I used oregano, since I didn't have Greek seasonings. And a little onion and chicken broth. Sorry to make so many changes but it really provided a great reference for me to use what I had. Thanks for the recipe!

We had this last night. I hate olives and not a fan of tomatoes, but this was WONDERFUL. The vinaigrette was amazing and added so much flavor. It was a huge hit. I would make it again but maybe substitute cucumbers for the olives and maybe use a tomato paste.

This was delicious!  I made the Greek seasoning blend from a recipe on this site, which was really easy.  Also I didn't have any Greek-style vinaigrette with feta so I just used Greek dressing in it's place.  This is a great recipe!

I loved this!  I made it in the crockpot and added white beans with only a handful of olives.  Served it over rice with a side salad and it felt so healthy.

I thawed the chicken in the microwave while getting all the other ingredients together, and used about 2/3 the amount of olives.  Since I didn't have any Greek seasoning, I used Italian seasoning, and substituted balsamic vinegar for the Greek-style vinaigrette, adding some crumbled feta along with the veggies.  I may have had a bit too much oil in the pan, but there definitely was a "splatter factor" to deal with when adding the chicken to the pan.  A screen or lid makes a good shield.  All-in-all, a good recipe.  Whether it would be better as published, or with my changes is unknown at this time.
