This recipe can be wonderful with a little imagination.I have made this recipe 3 times.
The first time, I followed the recipe accordingly.(except I did use a bigger cake pan).The chocolate in the middle want all over the pan, after it was cut.No one was really impressed.But it was good.
The second time I made the cake,I did it my way(wink).I used the bigger baking pan.I changed the Chocolate to chips.(16 oz.melted),instead of a hole in the middle of the cake.I want and poked several holes thoughout the cake with the end of a wooden spoon.Then I spread the chocolate all over the cake.
Then I poured the cream cheese mixture of the chocolate.It turned out wonderful.Everyone bragged about how good it was.
Then this last time I made it for Valentines day dinner party. I used the second method, but I topped it with canned cherries.Drizzled Chocolate also around the cherry topping.Everyone want crazy over it.
My forth attempt will chocolate cake bottom, with melted Peanut butter chips as the muddy part.
I hope this has helped some of u with this recipe.

In all honesty I find it difficult to recommend this recipe. It tasted fine I suppose but a week later with three kids in the house there is still half of the cake still in the fridge. The instructions say to put the batter in a 9 cake pan and then later to put the cheese on top of it. I had serious doubts about that when I saw the amount of batter for the bottom. Against my better instincts I did as I was told. Once baked there was no way to fit the cheese top in the pan. I transferred the baked bottom to a 9 springform pan which of course has higher sides. It worked out ok. Make sure the pan is put together properly and use aluminum foil to wrap to outside to prevent leaks. Philadelphia Cream Cheese no longer tells you how many cups are in an eight oz. package So beware it takes two. If you want the center to be soft when serving timing is important. Whether for family or guests perhaps you have other things to do rather than fuss over this timing issue.

My daughter and her friend chose this recipe and proceeded to make it without reading the reviews. All I can say is: USE A BIGGER PAN! We followed the directions and tried to make it work with the 9" pan called for in the recipe. Much too small - it overflowed there was not enough room for the cheesecake mixture or the extra chocolate. We had to throw the mess away - waste of money! We should have read the reviews first:)

I followed the others' reviews and put it in a bigger pan; also made several holes in the cake instead of a big one in the centre. And served it cold because there was nobody around when it was warm... I cut it into squares and my kid's friends (they are 11) liked it a lot.

It was really good it lookes nothing like the picture but it went well. I would add a teaspoon of salt to balance it and add a little bit of oil to moisten it up.
