This is a really good salsa.  I made it this past weekend and it was delicious.  Things I did differently were :  I used Fresh tomatoes not canned.  About 2 medium ones that I chopped and took the pulp out of.  I also added 2 tablespoons of TACO seasoning mix. This gave it a nice flavor. You can also substitute with cumin if you'd like.  I omitted the oil and the avocado.  I added about 1/4 cup of chopped jalapeno in.  I let it sit over night so the flavors could marinate really well.  With the leftovers I made black bean quesadillas the next day adding cheddar cheese to the tortillas.   Will make again !!

Very VERY tasty! However, I cut the recipe back by half. ommited the olive oil, added the full quarter cup of lime juice, and used all the cilantro. I also found that using fresh corn right off the corn is WONDERFUL and very cost effective during the summer months.

I love black bean and corn salsa! For this recipe, I used fresh tomato instead of canned, left out the onion (I don't care for them raw) and the avocado (did'nt have one), and I added some cumin. I served it over enchiladas, but could have eaten it with a spoon (and still might, there is some left over). Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is similar to my original corn & black bean salsa, except I used fresh tomatoes. HOWEVER, I finally wisened up and found a short cut - fresh pico de gallo from the grocery store produce section, canned corn & black beans drained. The only things you have to cut are the avocado and slice the lime in half. Cuts prep time tremendiously!

Incredible!  The only thing I would probably change is to use real diced tomatoes and another avocado.  The canned tomatoes were just weird.  I found myself trying to avoid them.  Other than that, it is a really filling dip and great for parties!  It's easy, cheap, awesome, and different from the usual party dips (cheese dip, guacamole, etc.)

I really like this recipe. I've been making something similar for years. Instead of the canned tomatoes, I use fresh. Then I also add in a can of garbanzos, a teaspoon of cumin, and salt and red pepper flakes.

This was really yummy. Instead of the oil I added a little lime juice. I also used regular diced tomatoes because the Italian style was too much like a sauce.

Couldn't get canned white and yellow corn seperately, so I bought two cans of niblets and threw 'em in, also had to omit the pepper due to an allergy. This was pretty good though, a refreshing summer salsa that goes great with tortilla chips, we've even put it in tacos! Increase the amount of cilantro.

Fabulous recipe! I made it for a recent barbecue and everyone raved. It's light, fresh, and absolutely delicious. I like things a bit spicy so I added a teaspoon of red pepper flakes. Thanks for sharing!

My neighbor actually told me how to make this salsa but when I forgot what some of the ingredients were, I had to search and came across this almost identical one.  The only difference--and it's a major one--is that we use Red Wine Vinegar in ours.  My neighbor puts in enough to make it a little on the "soupier" side (probably at least 1/2c with these ingredients).  When I'm pressed for time, I usually omit the red bell pepper to save chopping time.  I stopped using olive oil but I don't miss it.  I also dice tomatoes unless I'm short on time and I always have minced garlic on hand anyway.  Really I keep most of these ingredients on hand just to make this salsa because I can eat it by the spoon as well as with tortilla chips.  Try a spoonful of this salsa with a little red wine vinegar mixed in--if you love it, throw more in the whole bowl!  It does taste amazing with this added in and I don't know if anyone else has mentioned it (but I'm not going through all the reviews).

This is SOOO good.  I've used as an appetizer (makes a lot) or as a side dish.  Everyone raves and it's just as good two days later!

This was a deliciously refreshing salsa, to which I added a tsp. of cumin, a can of garbanzo beans, a couple tsp. diced jalapeno and a defrosted package of cocktail shrimp. I left out the avocado only because I knew it would turn brown, and served chips and guacamole on the side. The fresh cilantro really made this dish outstanding in flavor! Great light meal on a 115 degree day here in Palm Springs. Will definitely make again. Thanks so much for sharing, hvoeltner!

Oh WOW! My husband and I really loved this salsa. The recipe makes enough for a party but we ate the WHOLE THING! ( Over a few days lol.) I didn't have all the ingredients so I used lemon juice instead of lime and skipped the green onions all together. We ate them with lime flavored chips. Love this recipe!

I took the advice of earlier reviewers and used fresh tomatoes (3), some chili powder and cumin (to taste), and extra lime juice (about 1/2 cup total).  The salsa was simple to prepare and very delicious!  It's also very festive looking- great to bring to a party.

DO NOT USE italian tomatos! It makes it taste weird! The first time I made this I used fresh, which made a world of difference. Tonight, I used italian tomatos and I felt like I was eating spaghetti salsa.  Also plan on adding spices- cumin, garlic salt, cayene pepper, etc.

This is a great recipe for a party to go along with tortilla chips. I did add some spices(cumin, pepper, salt, chili powder)otherise it would have been very bland which is why I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars. I omitted the onions since I had a few people who do not like raw onions. I will definitely make this again, thanks.

I could eat this with a spoon, as a matter of fact I did with crushed chips on top! I have to add the heat though, 2 diced jalapenos, 1/2 tablespoon cumin, a sprinkle of Cayenne, and an extra 1/2 of a lime.I also omitted the avocado and olive oil. DELISH!

I made this salsa for a huge BBQ with 125 people.  I used the 72 servings and had more than enough.  I love love love this recipe although the red onion was a bit overpowering so next time I will reduce or omit it from the recipe.  I am planning to make another big batch of it and can it so I have some in the winter, too! :)

My husband gave this rave reviews and I love it as well.  However, I did make modifications for personal taste.  I used 1/4 cup finely chopped red onion in place of green onion, petite diced tomatoes with chilies (don't know why you would use Italian ones), a jalapeno finely chopped, and no avocado (didn't want it turning brown and ruining the salsa).  I also added a couple dashes of cumin.  Make it the day before you want to it it and all of the flavors meld well together.

I really combined this recipe with the recipe Summer Corn Salsa.  I used one can of golden corn, one can of rotel (b/c that is what I had on hand) and one can of black beans both drained.  I diced some onion (I only had white) and sprinkled with cilantro and minced garlic and a little olive oil.  Tasted great!

Delicious recipe, but be warned it makes a LOT! I think we ended up with about 8 cups of salsa....and at our party of 35 people only 1 cup was eaten. We did eat some the next day just as a side dish. Fresh taste, beautiful colors, looked great on the food table.

My Super Bowl Hit- After reading reviews, I used 1 can of original Rotel tomatoes instead of tomatoes in directions, plus 1 heaping teaspoon of Penzey's Arizona Dreaming spice blend (salt free taco seasoning). I let salsa sit overnight in the refrigerator and then I added the avocado right before serving. People ate as a salsa dip, as a side salad, and luckily for me they even enjoyed with the slow cooker chicken tortilla soup (also from this website). Will make again soon and thanks for the great recipe! Oh- Used Bush’s black beans: 1 can seasoned black beans and 1 can regular black beans. Couldn’t tell a difference but had to see, right?

I crave this, and when i make it is my lunch every day until it is gone (which isnt long) however I do have a few tips watch the onions, i use shallots which are more mild then reg or red onions and it is still very powerful. also do not use can corn, i feel can corn never has the vibrant taste i am looking for, i use frozen sweet corn (trader joes has the best frozen corn you will ever find it will change your world), also spend the extra few minutes to cut up fresh tomatoes. and do not skip the lime juice or cilantro. I use this in quesadillas and it is amazing!

Great recipe.....Remember that Italian tomatoes don't mean Italian "seasoned" tomatoes - it refers to Roma tomatoes which are less juicy and seedy.

Love it and it is addicting. Equally good scooped up on a tortilla chip, or just eat it as a salad. Also try it hot. Great hot or cold! My DH was in heaven. My only adjustment was to use fresh corn cut off the cob. I did do a quick pan fry with to corn, though I think that is optional. Next time I will use fresh tomatoes. Very refreshing.

This was excellent and a real hit when I served it to friends and family at our last gathering.  I made a slight add in, which was to only use half of the Italian style diced tomatoes, and add half a can of fire roasted tomatoes.  The char from the roasted tomatoes gave it a little something extra.  Everyone gobbled it up, so I will be sure to make this again!

Great but a little too runny. Also use fresh tomatoes not canned.

Delish!  Made it exactly as written, got rave reviews from party goers, and quite a few requests for the recipe.

Very Very Good. I cut the recipe in half, I didnt really measure anything but just put things as they looked right. I used corn off the cob, uncooked. I used a roma tomato instead of a can. and I made my own chips to go with it. We also ate this on Fish Tacos. Easy Fish Tacos with Mango Pineapple. It was very good together

I made this to use some fresh produce I had been given. I didn't expect to enjoy it very much as I'm not a huge fan of raw tomatoes, raw onion, and cilantro. However, this was a huge hit and I even enjoyed it a lot myself! I made some changes just based on what I had, I just used yellow corn, fresh tomatoes, white onion and added a jalapeno and left out the avocado. I used lemon juice instead of lime and added the oil while I was blending a bit of jalapeno together with the lemon juice to add more of a dressing of sorts to it. It was lovely. Everyone really enjoyed it and it was very easy to put together!

Halved the recipe and used 1 small can Rotel with chilis and one small can of "summer crisp" corn. One can of black beans instead of two. Did not add avocado, green onion or olive oil. Used all the juice of one lime. Added a little salt, pepper, cumin, and red pepper. Took one bite and said "Wow!" Everyone loved it! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!

Very tasty and a party hit.  I used 2 cans of yellow corn instead of white.  I used a couple fresh romas because I had them.  I went very light on the onion and didn't have any bell pepper.  Used fresh lime juice, no olive oil, and left avocado on the side to accomodate a few guests.  It was gobbled up and the next day we used leftovers to make burritos.

This was great! Served this with tortilla scoop chips and it was very addictive. I used only one can of corn, and one can of beans. I also subbed green bell pepper for red since that what I had on hand. I did use the Italian-style tomatoes, but I didn't notice the salsa tasting Italian-ish, like other reviewers have said. It has great flavor and textures and I highly recommend!

This is a good recipe. I did not use the olive oil because it is great without it so why add the calories and fat? I also used fresh tomatoes and added 4 seeded jalapenos, lots of cumin and a smidge of red pepper.

Awesome fresh salsa! As always, I made a few adjustments to the recipe...instead of using canned corn, I cut raw white corn strait off the husk.  I also added cumin and red pepper flakes for added flavor.  I made pulled pork tacos with this salsa on top and it was a big hit...it also was great on our eggs the next morning:)

I just made this tonight and my husband who was "full" just had to have a bowl full of chips and salsa.  I did not use avocado because I wanted it to last longer.  I also added a jalapeno and used extra lime.  Great recipes to start with and adjust to your taste preferences.  I would half the recipes...this made quite a bit!

How do you figure this makes 72 servings???  As a result, the nutritional information is very inaccurate for those of us who must watch our sodium, fat and/or caloric intake.

This is yummy! I made some changes though, just because I read the recipe, but didn't print it out, and I was going by memory, so I forgot the avacado, (which I didn't have anyway),the can of tomatoes and the red onion but not scallions...i used some fresh chopped garlic, and some dashes of hot sauce, salt and lemon and lime juices...I also omitted the oil to keep it even lower fat...this is good as soon as it's done, but even better the next day once the flavors meld together...thanks for the great recipe!

This is great but makes a huge amount.  A half batch is usually more than enough.  I also add two jalapeno peppers for a little kick.

This is a fantastic recipe! I have made it for several occasions and it disappears in minutes! I did make a few modifications but have made it as is also - I used frozen corn, rather than canned corn and I used fresh tomatoes in the summer instead of canned tomatoes. Hope your family enjoys this as much as mine!

We ate this up. Pretty good.  Not much of a fan of an Italian corn salsa.  I probably will not make  this again.  I would have to change the tomatoes to plain tomatoes and add some kind of mexican spice to it, like cumin or something.

I made this recipe for a party and not one person had a good thing to say about it.  I used all fresh ingredients (even cut corn off the cob) and the feedback from my guests was that it was bland and lacking flavor.  I would not make this again.

Loved, loved, loved it! I have been looking for a recipes for this and this is the one. The only change I made was left out the pepper and used green chiles, only used red onion and sprinkled in some sugar. Took it to a luncheon at work and there was nothing left.

I looked this up because my aunt used to make this when we went to the beach. This is a great salad / salsa. It is healthy and refreshing. Perfect for lunch or snack. I love avocado so I added two.

Been waiting a long time to make this and I finally had a party I could take it to today.  It makes a massive amount, so plan for a crowd!  It's very good, although not as flavorful as I would have hoped.  Everyone really enjoyed it though.  Next time I'd add more garlic and onion.

I took this to a party and it got rave reviews. I did not add the tomatoes, green onions, olive oil. I also didn't put the avacado in because it was going to be sitting out and it still had really great flavors.

I think this is a great alternative to traditional salsa.  I can serve it at a party with chips or use it as a salad  topping.   Very cool and refreshing.

I made this yesterday at work and everyone loved it!  Well, at least the ones that I was willing to share it with!  It was so great that we ended up being kind of selfish.  Great flavor, would like to add some jalapenos next time for some heat.

This recipe remains a favorite not only in our hours but when we visit friends as well. I also use fresh tomatoes instead of canned and I buy Trader Joe's frozen corn, one bag yellow roasted, and one bag white ......it is great on it's own or with tortilla chips, can't say enough about this simple recipe

Love this recipe!  Crisp,fresh and loaded with colour.  Make sure you coat the avacado well with the lime or lemon juice just in case there are any leftovers.  This will prevent them from browning too much.

I served this at a party with chips and everyone loved it. I used cherry tomatoes, which were really good in there and made it a unique salsa. I also did not include avacado because I made guacamole as well. I put the leftovers in the fridge and made tostadas with them the next day.

Alterations: 
Fresh tomatoes; Fresh squeezed lime juice; Garlic pressed myself; Frozen bag super sweet corn; No olive oil; Canned black beans with jalapenos.

Public Reaction:
I brought this to a family get together. Everyone always makes fun of me that I can't cook but they were so impressed by this! They kept saying how good it was and that the couldn't believe that I made it! It makes a huge batch, and it was nearly gone. I left early but people insisted I leave the bowl with what little was left of the salsa.

This is a very good recipe, sans the cans...  Have made numerous versions of this and it's Always delicious, but I Alwyas use fresh corn on the cob boiled in sugar water on the stove, then cut from the cob.  Also use fresh Romas instead of canned.  Black beans are the only canned part I use, but rinsed as the recipe does.  Only two differences I do is to use a jalapeno or two(like mine a bit spicy), and 2 favorite dry ingredients I use in Every salsa that wakes it up Immensely...   Feel free to contact me here if you'd like them..  ;~>

Avocados are a very nice touch as well...  Very good recipe!

I get so many compliments with this recipe!  I left off the avocado and added 1 mango instead.  A big hit at the office!  Tastes great as a dip for veges, too.

The only changes I made were the same suggestions others made.  Use a can of petite diced tomatoes and two avacados.

When I taught as a Nutrition Educator this was one of our office's favorite recipe.  Two differences are we did not add Avocado and we used Balsamic Vinegar in addition to the oil; other than that this is an absolutely DELICIOUS recipe!  
As a matter of fact, I was just talking to my husband about this recipe two days ago and wallah- here it is!!!

Beautiful, tasty recipe!
Did a few substitutions and adjustments: one can black beans instead of two.  Fresh tomato, diced, instead of canned.  Skipped the red onion.  Added approximately 1/2 diced Hatch green chilies (mild.)
Recipe was delicious and stayed fresh for several days.

AMAZING! Love this stuff! this is my requested dish at work pot lucks and get togethers. So refreshing! Never have canned corn on hand or white for that matter, so I just toss in frozen corn.  Am wondering if anyone has tried freezing this?  Thanks for the delicious recipe!

Left out the avocado and red onion. Added only  1 T oil, added 1 tsp cumin, one tsp salt and a few good shakes of cayenne, plus a finely diced jalapeno. Will leave out the yellow corn next time. Love this!

I did not follow this recipe, but instead did my own thing after looking at multiple corn salsa recipes on AllRecipes.  Turns out, I almost followed this one on accident.  I used proportionately more tomatoes because I had homegrown ones that I wanted to use.  I did not use avocado, or olive oil.  Oh, and I used about 3/4 of a small jalapeno pepper so there would actually be some kick.  My salsa was yummy, and felt very healthy and refreshing, so I'm sure any close variety of this one will be also.  Use this as a guideline and just adjust to your liking.

Refreshing and addictive!  Served with tortilla chips and everyone couldn't get enough of it.  Definitely use the entire amount of fresh lime juice and cilantro and, fresh tomatoes instead of canned.  Also would add an additional avocado next time.  Be sure to refrigerate overnight.  Thanks for the great recipe Heather!

This recipes is always a favorite I've taken to many events.  It always gets rave reviews.  I do however use 2 Medium Fresh tomatoes instead of canned and an extra avacado.  For a finishing touch I serve this salsa with lime flavored tortilla chips.

Not a huge fan of beans, but this is great!  And healthy!  I did follow some of the other reviews and added 2 packets of taco seasoning and garbanzo beans.  I had tomatoes on hand, so I used them instead of canned (took me about 2 1/2 to make it the consistency I like).  I also skipped the onion due to personal preference.  I planned on adding jalapeno for spice but decided to add sriracha (my weakness) instead, and it took quite a bit, to get it to my spicy level, but its good.  I wish I had another avocado to add, and I did add 2/3 c lime juice and a little extra olive oil.  Bringing it to a work potluck tomorrow, but I don't care if no one likes it, because I have no guilt eating this very healthy snack!

OMG! This is great! It was much better than I expected and all that I hoped for.  Also very fresh and filling. We added a tablespoon of tobasco hot sauce to give it a little kick which was great and not at all over powering. This was supposed to be the appetizer but it was so good it became the main focus at dinner time. My family loved it.

My family does not like onions, so I left them out. Other then that I followed the recipe exactly as written. It turned out amazing. We ate it with mexican food the first night then threw it on top of a salad the next night.

Added Rotel and fresh tomatoes instead of Italian-style tomatoes.  Left out the bell pepper, garlic, green onions & avocado, and it was still fantastic.  I love salsa, and this is by far my favorite!  Had it w/ tortilla scoops...awesome!

YUM! Very good recipe, dont like avacado so we didnt add that and we were missing the onion...added seeded jalapeno though (which I would have left some of the seeds, not nearly as hot as was hoping.

Heather's Cilantro, Black Bean & Corn Salsa Haiku: "So super yummy. (I forgot avocado.) Colorful & great!" I halved the recipe, but now wish that I hadn't b/c I'm sure this is one of those salsas that just gets better over time as the flavors mingle. I didn't intend to omit the avocado; just completely spaced on buying one, but I'm sure this would be even better w/ it. It's perfect in those tortilla chip "scoops", but just as tasty gobbled w/ a spoon. Just a fantastic summery recipe that I know I'll make again.

This is amazing with fresh tomatoes instead of the canned, even without the avocado (which I didn't have available).

Tried this a couple weeks ago to take to a cook out. Everyone seemed to like it. It seemed to be missing something for me. Perhaps the cilantro as I didn't have any and used parsley flakes instead. Will make again!

This was a huge hit at our Luau.  I made a few modifications in that I found tomatoes in lime juice with ciliantro in one can at our local grocery store which has a lot of ethnic varieties of food and I also used 1 can of yellow and white corn mixed since I was cutting the recipe in half.  It tasted great and I've been told the recipe's a keeper.

Pretty good salsa with some modifcations! I added a couple shakes cumin & red pepper to give it that extra kick. While I liked this recipe, I think it's best you play around with some spices in order to give it that personal kick it needs. I also used 1 can of store brand Mexican diced tomatoes in place of the Italian-style called for in the recipe. Everyone seemed to enjoy it. Thanks for the good base for a salsa you can either have mild or fire it up!

This recipe was just ok for me. There was definitely something missing. More spices need to be added. I added some crushed red pepper and a mixture of seasonings from the cupboard. Cumin would be a good addition for next time.

My family loves this recipe, it makes a good size bowl, but we still have to double it because we all love it. However, I never use the avocado or olive oil; we just like it simply without it.

Very good! I made some modifications just based on what I had on hand- I used a bag of frozen corn that I cooked in the micro. I only used one can of black beans and the diced tomatoes I had were roasted garlic and onion. I didn't have any green onions and I only used 1/2 my red onion because it was very pungent. Also, had green bell pepper on hand so used that instead of the red. Really delicious- you don't even need the chips! I may take a big bowl of this for lunch tomorrow...it's that good. Thanks for sharing!

I made this up and then we used it on lettuce with sour cream and taco chips as a "mexi-salad" it is amazing all by itself too, or in a lettuce wrap.

I followed the veggies to my favorite proportions, and got a hold of a dried ghost pepper.  Oh my yummy!  Just a 1/4 of it was enough heat, but not enough flavor, so I added a taco seasoning packet.  That did the trick! I'm taking it camping this weekend.

This is an extremely good salsa. I could eat it just from a spoon! EDIT: I absolutely adore this salsa. I make it so much. It keeps well, and it is way better the next day after all of the flavors mix together. So delicious!

This is AWESOME Salsa, the only thing I think it's lacking is a little spice so I added some of my Pampered Chef Chipotle rub and it made it perfect!  I think adding a little Tabasco would work too for those of us who like a little spice.  We put this over some lettuce, added some cheese and seasoned ground beef and tortilla chips for a nice taco salad. Thanks for the great recipe that I know will get much use in our kitchen.

This salsa was awesome!  Most corn salsa's I've ever had were very bland - not so with this recipe.  I added a little garlic salt but this salsa would've been awesome either way!  I love lime so the next time I might up the lime juice a tad, but this recipe is great regardless.  We finished an entire recipe the first night between four of us girls.  I made it as an addition to fish tacos; everyone loved it.

This was absolutely delicious! I just grabbed whatever I had left to use: 2 large diced tomatoes, 1 can rinsed/drained beans, 1 cup frozen corn (thawed), 1/4 yellow onion (partially sauteed in butter) since I don't like the strong onion flavor, cumin (this definitely topped it), dash salt, 2 tsp minced garlic, couple splash of lime juice (otherwise too tart). I enjoy mine more earthy. Mmm, enjoy! I think next time I'll vary it by opening a can of tropical fruit and dice some into the already flavorful salsa.

I made this in a pinch with little ingredients and it still tasted amazing! I had to scratch a couple ingredients and I accidentally put white beans instead of white corn and the final result was still delicious.

This is absolutely the best bean & corn salsa I have ever come across!  It is truly a hit at all my summer gatherings.  The only adjustment I made was to add about a 1/2 packet of Good Seasons Zesty Italian dressing mix to spice it up a little for my own personal taste. Also, to keep the avocado from getting too slimy, I don't add it until just prior to serving.

I'm a huge fan of all the ingredients in this salsa, so it should have been great. Right? It's good, but it's not likely I'll make it again.

It does make a lot.  I made 2 batches and took them to a potluck, and I would have been better off splitting 1 batch.  Everyone asked for recipe because everyone liked how refreshing it was and it was actually healthy.

Soooo light & refreshing! I used fresh corn cut off the cob (which was AMAZING) didn't add the avocado, didn't have one and don't really care for it that much. Forgot to add the olive oil, and it was so great without it, that I may skip it in the future!  had some vegans over so this was a perfect treat for them. LOVED this recipe!!!

Everyone loves this salsa!  Here are my modifications: I use no salt added canned corn, beans, and tomatoes, so I really do control the sodium content.  I also used low-fat mayonnaise to lower the fat.

VERY good! This recipe made me the hit of the bbq party :)  I thought this was going to make way too much, but it was gone in a flash! We ate it with tortilla chips, but I know it would be excellent with fish or chicken, or even just as a side dish.

This was SO good!  We loved this and even though it really made a ton, the two of us ate every bite!  Only changes I made were using Rotel diced tomatoes with chilis, and one fresh diced jalapeno.  It was good just out of the bowl!  Thanks Heather!!

Very light and refreshing. The flavors blended very well. I omitted the olive oil. Use fresh tomatoes instead of canned. Delicious with corn tortilla chips.

I used a bag of thawed frozen corn instead of the canned and I omitted the avacado so it would last longer in the fridge.  I also used fresh grape tomatoes, I think that they taste great all year round.  Everyone loved it!

WOW this was so good! I couldn't stop eating it! I made this using what I had on hand so I had to leave a few ingredients out. I didn't use the avocado, red bell pepper or garlic and I used 2 cans of white corn instead of 1 yellow 1 white. I can't wait to make again. Thanks!

loved it! ate it as a side dish. made the following changes: used 1 can of fiesta corn. 1 can black beans, 1 can pinto beans, 2 green onions, no red onions, no olive oil, 1 can of diced tomatoes with chilis then the rest of the ingredients. Super healthy, especially if following weight watchers. lots of fiber.

I love this recipe!  I live in El Paso TX where fresh salsa is the norm, and this goes over very well!  It is simple to make and I add jalapeños for some heat and do not use the olive oil.

I made this twice this summer while we had plenty of fresh corn. It is delicious! The second time, I doubled the recipe and it still disappeared quickly. It is a really nice change from regular red salsa. YUMMY!!

Made it tonight and stuck to the recipe pretty much but didn't put in avocado since  it's for tomorrow. I did use fresh tomatoes but didn't do anything to them except finely chop them, added a half can of diced tomatoes to juice it up a little, chopped four slices fresh jalapeños. I only used one garlic clove but it was big and almost too much. It's still deeelishous!! Best salsa!!!

i essentially follow this to the T but throw in a litle ground red pepper and chop the cabbage really fine. i then dump in some globs of miracle whip to essentially create a creamy cabbage, black bean and corn slaw side dish that also serves aa a good salsa.

recently had this 'slaw' with tri-tip and pepper-jack potato hash.  delicious!

Tasty! I think that the result of this dip depends on the freshness of the ingredients, like the cilantro. Will make again, wouldn't skip the oil.

I made this almost exactly as written except I didn't have a can of white corn so omitted the extra can. This is really good. Thank you for submitting it.

A very filling recipe.  Tastes better if more tomatoes are added.

Made this exactly as recipe says and it was delicious and makes about 5 lbs of salsa! We used it for quesadillas, burritos, tacos and just as a dip with chips! Delicious and so versatile!

Wow - had no black beans on hand -- made it with white navy beans (canned and rinsed) and it was delicious -- world class.  Didn't add the garlic either.  Used alot of fresh cilantro -- a key ingredient in my opinion.  Also, avocado added so much flavor.  Try it!

Great salsa!  Make a batch every week now.  Best to use fresh tomato, freshly squeezed lime juice is a must, canned corn is good frozen corn doesn't work as it becomes mushy and tasteless.  Placed diced avocado in the lime juice to coat before combining to maintin color.  Used an orange pepper to add more color, added a jalepeno as someone suggested.  This salsa is delicioius, thanks Heather.

This salsa is terrific, I added more avocado, I just hope it won't go brown before my event tonight. I did cover the avocado with the lime juice before adding to the rest of the salsa.

This black bean and corn salsa recipe was really good and it makes a lot! The only change I made was throwing in a second avocado into the salsa because I love avocado! So delicious!

This recipe is quite bland as is, but it's a good base. Unfortunately, I had to omit the avocado because my boyfriend hates it. (I'm sure it would be delicious with it added!) However, instead of using canned tomatoes (I really dislike canned tomatoes in salsa), I used about 4 small/medium fresh tomatoes, diced. Since it was a bit lacking in flavor, I added about 2 teaspoons of cumin, salt to taste (maybe around 1-1 1/2 teaspoons), and pepper (around 1/2-1 teaspoon). I also used an orange bell pepper instead of red because it was all I had on hand. It still needed a little kick so I added 2 partially seeded jalapenos and 1 tablespoon of white vinegar. This brought it to life! With these changes, I would definitely rate it a solid five stars. My friends and I can't stop eating it! Thanks for the recipe!

Love this recipe.  My aunt made it for my birthday party two years ago.  I've been making it ever since.  I love to make it for summer parties.  I use fresh tomatoes instead of canned.  During the summer when I have fresh tomatoes and fresh herbs from my garden, I make it every other week.

I don't give  many 5 stars but this is a fantastic recipe.  This is more of a salad vs a salsa.  We served this as a salad and just added some cumin and red pepper flakes for a little kick and it was AWESOME.  So refreshing and light.  Try this you won't be disappointed.

This recipe got rave reviews at our bbq...from picky eaters! I omitted olive oil and avocado based on other reviews and used a jalapeno pepper per batch. Light refreshing flavor. I served this with tortilla chips as is. when eating without the chips and their saltiness, I added some seasoned salt to taste and/or cumin.

I have made this dozens of times. It has become my go-to recipe for summer potlucks and picnics. It makes a TON, so plan to share. Everyone always loves it, so I have shared this recipes many times. Even my kids (who do not like tomatoes, onion, and peppers) love this recipe (go figure!) This is one of the few recipes that I make exactly as written. Dee-lish.

Fantastic recipe as is!

Sure, it's better if you use fresh corn cut right off the cob and freshly diced ripe tomatoes but the recipe is also delicious as written.  I just recommend adding the step of leaving it in the fridge overnight before serving to let the flavors mix, and then adding the avocado right before serving.  

I like this stuff so much I eat with a spoon as a side dish!

Excellent salsa! I made a few modifications. I only used 1 can of black beans (seasoned), and 1 can of sweet corn. I added a fresh diced tomato instead of canned, and a jalapeño pepper for some kick. I omitted the onions, and bell peppers, olive oil and since my boys don't like avocado I served the avocado on the sided sliced with a pinch of cayenne pepper and fresh lime juice. YUM!

This was good, but it desperately needed salt.  I ended up cutting the recipe in half because the original made a huge amount and I also substituted the red pepper for a jalapeno pepper....gave it the perfect amount of heat.  
This is a good base recipe, you can tweak it to just about anything to suite your own tastes.

This is delicious! I've been getting requests for the recipe ever since the first time that I made it! I added one 4oz can of green chilies, a couple fresh roma tomatoes. Omitted the avacado and pepper. Reduced the garlic only for parties. YUMMY!!

I made this and it was WONDERFUL!!!  Took it on vacation and my entire family, including the kids loved it.  It only lasted 2 days.   I made some changes to it though.  Not so much cilantro and I added chile seasone tomatoes (that you would use for a Mexican dish) in a can...2 to be exact.  I also added yellow and orange bell peppers for added color.  Did not add the avacado either.   This is a recipe I will continue to use.  LOVE IT!

This is a great, great recipe.  Always a big hit!  I think the recipe is fine just how it is, but I may play with it a bit more in the future.  Canned tomatoes, drained and rinsed like the black beans, look and taste just fine but fresh would probably be better.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful!! I followed this recipe as is and ate it with some hint of lime tortilla chips. Looks great in a clear bowl...big hit at the barbeque!

Heather:  this recipe ROCKS!  It is very easy to "customize" it to whatever you have on hand.  I used fresh tomatoes, fresh jalapenos and a seasoning spice available here in Texas called Pico de Gallo con limon (Fiesta Brand).  I didn't have canned corn so I flash cooked some frozen corn.  The lime juice is a must have for that South-of-the-border taste.  We totally love this stuff and it's pretty to boot!
The last time I made this I added 1 cup of cooked and cooled Bulgar cracked wheat.  It made a Mexicanized verson of Tabouli.  Quite good!

Excellent Salsa!!!  My friends request this everytime we have a BBQ.  I use the Rotel diced tomatoes that includes lime juice and cilantro for even extra kick.  Love it :)

Great salsa! I have made it several times now. I have made some changes, tailored to my family's tastes. I don't mix the avocado in it and it keeps longer, just have sliced avocado on the side. I use Rotel original (instead of Italian tomatoes), double the lime juice OR add 1/4 cup vinegar, and add hot sauce. I dump everything in a 1 gallon jar, shake it well, and let it sit in the fridge until the next day. I then shake it and dip out what we will use with a slotted spoon--that helps with the additional liquid without compromising the taste. This makes it almost as easy to keep on hand as the store-bought.

This is really a very good salsa.  I added a little salt and more jalapenos (including the juice) to kick it up a notch.  We have eaten it with chips or just as a side dish.  I used fresh cherry tomatoes and fresh cracked pepper for a very fresh, authentic taste.  Will definitely make again...perhaps this weekend!

This recipe has a really fresh taste to it.  You can really taste all of the ingredients.  Great for summer!!  I think I'll add jalapenos to it next time to give it a little more taste and kick.

Absolutely wonderful!  This was so refreshing, even though I only used black beans, all white corn, cilantro, red onion.. and then the "dressing".  I could have eaten the entire bowl! :-)

So good! I was looking for a healthy snack for a gathering and I made this (minus the avacado) and served with Wheat Thins as well as tortilla chips. It was a hit. Very flavorful- and nutritionally packed for a snack.

This salsa was a huge hit at my sister's baby shower. It's sweet, not hot so it adds a nice alternative for those who don't like "hot" although, everyone loved it. We used fresh tomatoes instead of canned and didn't add the avocado. It's SO easy to make. Perfect for parties!

This is so good and it's actually healthy!! We just changed the red onion to yellow onion and leave out the avocado. Otherwise, it's perfect.

This makes a lot even when cut in half, make sure you're serving a large crowd when making the entire recipe.  It has strong flavors and I added more heat with a couple chopped jalapenos.  I really liked this dip because I love mexican flavors.  Worked really well for a meal in chicken tortilla wraps with refried beans, lettuce and cheese.

Yum! This had many of my favorite ingredients and sounded easy to throw together quickly (it is), so I made it for a party recently.  I had forgotten to buy avocado, but everyone still loved it.  And instead of two cans of corn, I just added one can of Mexican corn.

I took this to a get together and everyone seemed to like it.  I made it less than an hour before serving therefore I didn't refrigerate.  I used much less red pepper and added cumin, salt and pepper.  Served with corn chips.

This is very good, and a nice change from traditional salsa.  I've made it several times, and the only changes I make are to replace the Italian tomatoes with a Mexican version (with green chiles or jalapenos) and add a couple of fresh tomatoes, finely chopped and maybe a little salt.  I also omit the oil.  It doesn't seem like it needs it, and it cuts down on the calories/fat.  It tastes even better the next day, so it's a great make-ahead dish, just put it together without the avocado, and then add that right before serving.

I halved the amount of corn and black beans but put everything else in it (I substituted sweet onion for red) and this was a huge hit at our "mexican night" dinner party.  Plus it added nice color to the plate!

This salsa sounds sooo good, but it was too bland for me and I do agree with the person who thought the Italian stewed tomatoes made it a bit pasty tasting. I will definately use fresh tomatoes the next time! I put in half of a jalapeno pepper and about 1 tsp. dried oregano and some lemon juice and a splash of white vinegar. This doctored it up a bit, but I was surprised it took so much doctoring. I was very disappointed because I make other salsas similar to this and they are always a hit even if I don't always put the exact same amounts in each time. I still think if I had used fresh tomatoes, it would have been fine. I will try it again with that change.

Just OK. I thought it needed some more spice. Maybe substitute the italian tomatoes for tomatoes with green chiles or else add a diced jalapeno. I did not add the avocado either.

ABSOLUTELY GREAT with fish tacos where the fish is spicy.
I omitted the tomatoes as they give me indigestion, and it still turned out lovely!
I made the whole recipe and am feeding it to friends tomorrow night!

If you are looking for a healthy appetizer that tastes great then this is it!  Made it tonight for the Super Bowl and it was awesome.  Will absolutely make it again!  (The leftovers were also great eaten as a salad with chicken and feta cheese on top.)

Liked it, but not quite what I'm searching for.  Was a hit at work and at another party, but it makes a LOT, which I don't like, since there are only two people in my house and we couldn't handle the amount of leftovers it entailed. I like salsa with a bit more liquid, so I wouldn't drain the tomatoes, but that's a personal preference.

This salsa was a huge hit!  It looks as good as it tastes.  I didn't add the olive oil because it was healthier and with all of the juices from the canned beans and corn (even after draining) there was plenty of moisture.  I also added a little salt.

Great recipe. I used regular frozen corn, not the canned corn, used fresh jalapenos, & didn't use the scallions. It turned out great. The beautiful thing about cooking is that you can tailor the recipe to how you like it. Would make again.

I have loved this for years, I use it as a vegan main dish at a barbecue! Very healthy and just delicious! I always use frozen corn and fresh tomatoes, and omit the onion. I'd probably sub a second red pepper for the avocados, too.

Excellent! I added 2 Tbsp. taco seasoning mix. I served it as salsa with tortilla chips and as a topping on chicken nachos. No leftovers!

Loved this!  Made it exactly as per the recipe.  Definitely a favorite and I plan to to take to lunch this week.  

Thanks for sharing this on.  :)

EDIT:  I left out the red pepper because I'm not a fan of raw red peppers.  Still great.

From a lot of the reviews it looks like they opted out of using avocado d/t it turning brown.  Kitchen Tip: if you squeeze lemon juice or lime juice over the diced avocado (coating all sides) it slows the oxidation time incredibly so you can still enjoy adding this healthful and delicious fruit/veg without it going brown!  Enjoy!

I made this recipe a few times now, always using fresh corn on the cob instead of the canned.  I would also suggest using fresh tomatoes instead of the canned, diced tomatoes.  GREAT summer salad for parties or with chicken or fish. It's become my go-to salad/side dish!

Incredibly easy to make. I prepared it the night before to bring to the office.  Added the avocados and a splash of lime at the end and it was a success.  Served it with tortilla chips.  Will definitely prepare it again.

I made this but left out the oil and pepper. I used real tomatoes instead of canned and added a little cumin and a dash of salt.  I also threw in some shredded chicken and served it on tostadas with cotija cheese crumbled on top!! So Yummy!!

Big hit for New Years party. Really good. 
Only changes were I used Rotel’s diced green chili and tomatoes, instead of plain tomatoes, and pan roasted 
Frozen corn instead of using canned.

Will definitely make this one again! The only difference I made was to leave out the 5 green onions (too many onions for me). This is a refreshing salsa perfect to have with tortilla chips.

Made it with only 2 small changes. Had no green onions, so used sweet onion, (I def think green would be better), and put in about 1/4 of the juice drained from the tomatoes.

We started eating it right away, but I expect it will be even better after a day or two in the frig, allowing flavors to marry.

A KEEPER!  Would be pretty for a party.

I made this for a BBQ get-together and it was a big hit! I followed the recipe, adjusting the amount of cilantro as some people do not enjoy its taste. We added some salt and pepper to taste. Already planning to make it again!

Great basic recipe. I had to use cilantro flakes b/c I was in a pinch. Also used straight yellow corn and had to omit the red bell pepper b/c I and none. . Used one can black and one can kidney b/c I was also out. Haha with all the omissions and substitutions it Still turned out great. I also used extra lime juice.

Delicious!! I do use fresh corn when in season (3 ears) and only one can of beans. Subbed a can of original rotel for the tomatoes for a little kick, used 1 tbsp fajita seasoning and 1 tbsp cumin and about 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes. Left out cilantro (don’t like it) but used fresh parsley instead. Very yummy!!!

This was great!  It says 72 servings which threw me. I only wanted for four so I had to re-figure the portions. I guess 72 is for dip at a party. I did about 1/4 of each ingredient. But it turned out very well as a side dish for steak tortillas. I added some cumin,  jalapano and chili peppers.

I substituted guacamole pico de gallo in place of avocado and used two cans of fire roasted diced tomatoes instead of one. Based on personal preference I left out the pepper. Since the guacamole made it so creamy I didn't need the oil and it was really easy to scoop with a chip. This is one of those great recipes where it is good on its own, but allows you to tweak as you like. It makes a very large amount which makes it great for parties.

Fantastic recipe, the only tweak I would make is that I would add a second can of tomatoes and wait to put the avocado on as the absolute last step. We mixed it all together and the avocado got pulverized, next time I may leave them on the side. This recipe goes PERFECT with burritos, definitely a favorite!

Used a combination of canned tomatoes and fresh.  Canned tomatoes were slime-y. Added packet of taco seasoning, extra cumin, oregano, red pepper and still no taste.  Left to marinate overnight in hopes of saving... still no taste.  Glad I had a backup for guests.

We made this for New Year's Eve, served it with chips and  all of us loved it.   I will use leftovers to top salads this week.

 I used a   10-ounce can of Ro*Tell tomatoes instead of diced tomatoes. I used red and green bell pepper to make it pretty. 
For good luck purposes for New Year's tradition in the South, I threw in a ladle or two of black-eyed peas from a pot of them I already had simmering on the stove for the next day.

I used fire roasted yellow corn and fire roasted tomatoes. I also added roasted red peppers in addition to the red bell pepper. I wanted to keep some crisp,  fresh crunch to the salad. So l didn't omit the bell pepper. The salsa was more smoky. Still, very delicious.

So I took this recipe, as I do with all my recipes I find online, and changed it just slightly.

So I don't like using canned things so I used fresh corn (2 ears) and fresh beans (1.5 cups, dry). I also used fresh garlic (your recipe didn't specify) and fresh tomatoes (two Roma and a handful of cherry). I added other seasonings to taste ( garlic salt, paprika, chili powered, pinch of cumin, and Tony's creole seasoning). 

I kept everything else the same. Since I cooked dry beans the recipe time was much longer however if you have the beans pre cooked the time is about the same. (An additional 2-3 hours if dry beans are pre cooked).

This recipe was so good. I made it for a barbecue at my sister's house. I admitted the Purple Onion and added mango a little sugar and some white vinegar within the first 15 minutes the entire Bowl was gone. I served it with the line corn chips and they paired together perfectly. Thank you so much for this recipe.

This salsa was delicious. The only thing I did differently was use fresh tomatoes rather than canned tomatoes and added some salt. I made this for a potluck & it received rave reviews. Will definitely be making this again & again!

I have made something similar, there are a million variations. I will say that when sweet corn is in season, next time you fire up the grill, roast a few extra ears of corn just for this. It is SOOOO much better than canned.

My family and I love this recipe! I have always made salsa, but when I saw this version, I could not resist. The only changes that I made were: I slightly heat the black beans and corn for a minute with the garlic. This gives it more texture when it comes to the blending process.  I also used fresh tomatoes instead of canned, a small jalapeño pepper seeded for a little kick and a teaspoon of distilled vinegar. I omitted the avocado. I will definitely make it again! Great recipe! Thanks!!!

Great recipe used it a couple times now. Everyone raves about it. I add a couple extra things like jalapeños. Black pepper. Basil. Chili powder. Salt.

I followed this recipe exactly and ended up making it twice in one week! The only thing I did was roast the red pepper on my gas stove.  I will make this at home and in my food classes! Great with chips, on enchiladas, in a taco, or on a burger... extremely versatile!

We loved this salsa.  We used fresh tomato instead of canned, added Italian dressing mix (per other recipes), salt and pepper.  We omitted the red bell pepper and green onion due to preference.

Definitely will make again. Next time going to add jalapeños. It needed a little more kick, but very flavorful and colorful.

Love it but use it a bit differently, I make it and fill flour or corn tortillas with it adding cheddar cheese and sour cream to make dinner wraps on crazy busy nights for a quick dinner on the go!
A couple of things I do different: I use leftover cooked corn on the cob instead of canned, substitute a can of Rotel for the tomatoes, or use fresh depulped.

This is a good salsa and you can adjust it according to your taste.  I did not have cilantro, so I didn't add it, but I added a little jarred salsa for extra zest and omitted the oil. It was a hit!

Gave out recipe at our outing! Used basil instead of cilantro  and no avacado  due to hubby. Used fresh cooked corn and fresh tomatoes, cumin, garlic and a few other spices, it really is good.

Came out wonderfully! I added extra avocado just because, and a little salt. Except for the beans, everything was freshly chopped instead of a can.

I LOVE this recipe! I make it ever year for our tailgates, and it's a hit! The only thing I omit is the avocado because I'm allergic, but it's still fantastic without it.

I'm actually canning this, but I don't know how that will turn out since I have to pressure can this because of the fresh corn and uncooked beans.  I didn't do the avocado and oil since I'm canning it.  Instead of bell peppers, I used Chilaco's that were charred (they are similar to Anaheims I think).  I used canning salt and I added some cumin and fresh tomatoes instead of canned Italian tomatoes.  Uncanned it tasted awesome (without tasting the hard beans of course), but I think it will be awesome canned.  I'll update later.  But, as it stands, it's awesome.  I also used fresh corn instead of canned.

This is always a hit - I bring it to cookouts as an alternative to jarred salsa. I have trouble finding nice avocados, so I go without if needed and it's still great. I use frozen instead of canned corn as well.

Very good! I took this to a pool party and got rave reviews!  I took advice of some other reviews and added some cumin and red pepper flakes.  I did not use green onion or avocado (afraid it would turn brown).  Great recipe!

Thanks for an interesting recipe.  It was really beautiful and fragrant.  I understand now why the original recipe says it makes enough for 72!  I halved the recipe and we have LOTS left over... Not because there is anything wrong with it but because I only had 6 people at dinner.  Looking forward to using this in many other meals in the near future, and will make a 1/4 batch when I make it again.

I've actually made this salsa at least a dozen times and every time I make it I get rave reviews.  I'm never able to get away without at least two people asking for the recipe.  I had a friend of mine tell me that her mom was upset with me because I made the salsa.  Then she proceeded to take the leftover before the party was completely over.  ****bit of advice the recipe makes a lot.

Love.  I used just a little onion out of taste preference.  This is one recipe I know I'll get hungry for again soon.  (Tastes just as good without the avacado too.)

I love that this recipe had so much flavor with no salt or pepper . I omitted the avocado and will use it to make guacamole for a dip.  Im serving this as a side dish....You could eat this with chips but I use a spoon ;)

Amazing! Everyone loved it! I could eat it by itself it was that good. I didn't use the avocado because I was out, and it still tasted amazing. Next, time I'll leave out the red onion just because I'm not a huge fan.

This makes a lot and it still went fast at our family gathering!  I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned, a little extra lime (juice of 3 limes total), and 2 hatch peppers instead of the rekd bell for a little heat.  Also added a bit of cumin and salt.  Fantastic.  I'll make it again!

Fabulous! Even my Texan in-laws liked it. I let it marinate for about 3 hours in the fridge before I served it.

This is a great recipes for gatherings. When ever I go to a mexican style potluck this is always requested of me. It's good stuff. The only changes I make is I use two medium fresh tomatos chopped in place of the canned tomatos. And I also saute the peppers and onion, because I prefer them that way.

This is great! I also made a few changes. I used canned Rotel tomatoes w/ green chillis because it adds a lot of flavor and I like the tomatoes a little softer than the fresh ones. I added some jalapeno, doubled the avocado and I omitted the bell pepper and oil.  Make it the night before so that the flavors meld well and it’s perfect alone or on just about anything. Thanks for the recipe!!

This is an awesome recipe.  In a tortilla,  with nacho chips or as a side dish, this recipe is versatile, healthy, and delicious.  It makes a lot but you will use every bite.  Stays fresh & crunchy all week long.  We use this every cookout & pot luck.  I don't add avacado or olive oil.  Just a preference in our family.  If you can find canned Mexican style tomoatoes it makes it into perfection.  Add some cumin and heat if you like that kind of stuff.  Excellent recipe.  Thanks !

Easy and inexpensive.    I took this to a potluck and several people asked for the recipe.   I have also made it without avocado (when I couldn't find good fresh ones) and it still tastes delicious.  Substituting lemon juice for lime juice gives a different, yet still good flavor as well.

The best... Have made this several times and I always have to print out the recipe. Perfect... You may want to add a tad more lime juice but that's up to your taste buds.

Very easy to make and quick also when you have guests! I made homemade tortilla chips to go with them for a more authentic taste. Yummy, yum yum. :)

This turned out very nice & colorful.  My husband really enjoyed it.  I could have made it spicier.  Otherwise a good salsa.

This was a huge hit at both a work party and at a family reunion.  I made a triple batch to feed them all, and it still turned out wonderfully.  Will make it again for a quick and easy crowd pleaser.

This recipe was delicious!!! I tried it without the olive oil, and it only made it seem more fresh and delicious (plus less fat!!). This is definitely one of my favorite recipes on this site (plus it makes an excellent side dish)
