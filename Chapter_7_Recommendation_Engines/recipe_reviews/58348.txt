The kids love this.  If you want more flavor -- I use chicken broth instead of water and canned El Pato sauce in my rice before I add the rest of the ingredients (the El Pato sauce doesn't really add a lot of liquid, so keep on about the same proportions of liquid as before.)  I've also noticed that the HOT rather than MEDIUM picante sauce makes it almost too spicy, but you can scale up or down depending on your taste. Also, add a little minced onions, garlic and celery in the meat (hot pork sausage and/or ground beef) makes it really really good.  I didn't use too much cheese on top at first, but this is the best part.  The kids also like this inside burritos.  Great!  UPDATE:  I was out of Sour Cream so I used Ranch dressing -- not 8 ounces, but just enough to get the creaminess through the mixture.  Came out great and no one mentioned the difference.

This is a fantastic dish! Very easy and quick to fix and the bonus is, it's delicious! I prepared it exactly as instructed, but cut the recipe in half. I let it sit a good 15 minutes after taking it out of the oven so it would "set up" a little. Then we ate it on warm flour tortillas. My kids said it was better than anything they could get at Taco Bell!! I'm taking that as a compliment. This will be a regular at my house.

Made it exactly like as instructed. I would use a hotter picante sauce next time or spicier sausage. To me it was just a good rice casserole. I am going to add just a little more rice next time. Recipe was slighty watery. It is good, easy, and fast so I will make it again.

I made minor changes to this. My six-year-old and I don't really handle spicy too well, so I put in about 3/4 cup medium chunky salsa and about 1/2 cup sour cream. I also use sage sausage because that's the only sausage I actually like. I use Daiya cheddar shreds on top. We now make this 3-4 times a month because we love it so much. Occasionally we'll use the leftovers in burritos the next day but usually we just eat it with spoons.

Made this for dinner one night. Had misgivings about the picante sauce but went on anyways. Actually the recipe was
way more than I needed for two people, so I brought some to my brother and he loved it.  This is definitely a recipe that I will keep in my recipe book Thanks

I made this using no meat because it was a side dish to cheese and chicken enchiladas. I had already mixed together salsa and sour cream, along with a can of cheese soup for the enchiladas, so that's the mix I used for this rice; I didn't think it mattered that there was a little cheese soup mixed in and of course it was fine. Easy-peasy and excellent side dish. I ussed shredded pepper jack for the topping as that is what I had on hand. I'll definitely try it with the meat (not breakfast sausage, maybe Italian sausage I think, or pure ground pork,) as a main dish some other time; it's a great weekday meal. Thanks CHAUNIH!

Yum! I threw everything except the dairy in my rice cooker. Instead of the breakfast sausage I used "Mexican Style" chorizo. Then I added a little chopped onion, garlic, cumin, cilantro and Goya complete seasoning. After it was done I mixed it with the sour cream and half of the cheddar cheese. I sprinkled the rest on top. It came out fantastic. I've played around with other rice mixes but this has been the best so far with a few changes. Thanks!

I used chicken broth instead of water to cook the rice and used 1/2 regular and 1/2 spicy breakfast sausage.  I think next time I will use all spicy sausage to kick it up a notch.  Overall, this was very good and liked by all.

My family really likes this one. I recommend less cheese on top  because it comes out really oily.  Also, there is noting "fire" about it.  You'd have to throw in jalapenos or something if you wanted it to be hot.

This was a little better than I expected it to be. I'm not very fond of sour cream, but this recipe buried it in the mix fairly well. I made it exactly as written, using the Hot version of Pace picante sauce, and I shredded an 8-ounce "longhorn style" mild cheddar for the cheese. The recipe didn't say whether the fat from the browned sausage should be drained, or left in for flavor/etc. - I opted to get rid of it. If this hadn't included the sausage, or if I hadn't used the Hot picante sauce, I think this might've been a bit bland. But as I made it, I pretty much gobbled it up. Actually, I think that the reheated-in-the-microwave leftovers were a little better, because it seemed firmer and less moist. All in all, this made a pretty tasty dish.

Made today for lunch but I didn't have sausage so I used two cooked chicken breasts that I chopped up. It is a good filling meal and easy to put together.

We really enjoyed this. I cooked the rice in chicken broth.  I used a can of rotel and half a jar of chunky salsa (med. heat).  I mixed most of the cheese in with the rice and saved just enough to sprinkle on top.  This was very "fire" like and will make it again.  Thanks Chaunih

I too thought this recipe was quick and easy, as well as tasty. Like other reviewers, I used chicken stock to cook the rice, instead of water.  I think that makes a big difference.  I also used spicier versions of the pork sausage and salsa.  I would definitely make it again.  It was perfect for a potluck.  I did the prep the night before, refrigerated overnight, and baked it in the morning.

I thought this was great. I served it to my inlaws and they loved it. I used the Italian and smoked sausage, the big fat kind, just cut up in pieces. That's what I had on hand. I think next time I will stick with the recipe and use ground. Thanks!

Quick and easy. I used taco seasoned ground pork, substituted ranch dressing for the sour cream (didn't use 8 oz), and medium chunky salsa instead of picante. Also used day old rice (refrigerated).

This was very good - the perfect combo of creamy, cheesy and savory...  Quick and easy to put together as well.  Will definitely make it again!

This got good reviews from my boys.  I liked it too.  The only thing I did differently was use a pkg. of cream cheese because I was out of sour cream.

I used brown rice, and El Pato (I don't like chunky hot sauce).  This is definitely a great recipe by itself, and can definitely be tailored to fit whatever you are craving.  I can see myself adding black olives, some jalapenos (I like the kick), and maybe corn next time I make it.  Yes, there will definitely be a next time for this recipe.  Oh yeah, I did drain the sausage, just too much grease not to.  Thanks for the great recipe CHAUNIH.

Really good wrapped up in a tortilla. I used hot sausage and brown rice. Using the brown rice I increased the liquid to three cups. For the liquid I used canned beef broth as others have stated. The kids are already asking for this one again.

I went lower fat on the serving for 8 size, and pretty much followed the recipe .  I used smoked turkey sausage taken from a one pound link I had (removed casing) to have a total of 40 grams of fat in the one pound.  Went with 8 oz of a good quality low fat sour cream to have 20 grams of fat there.  I went with half the recommendation of cheddar cheese on top, and used a good quality low fat for 24 grams of fat.    That made each hearty and filling serving just a little of 10 grams of fat, and it tasted great.     I did use the medium hot picante.   I might experiment with adding black beans or corn next time, as another reviewer has mentioned.

Pretty good recipe.  I did what a few others suggested by adding a diced onion and a can of Rotel tomatoes with diced green chiles (hot).  I also used chicken broth for the rice rather than water.  Isn't one of my favorites, but will make again.

I'm still eating leftovers for lunch.
I add some Tobasco to make it a little hotter.   I will definantly make is again.

This turned out awesome, I added a can rotel and a can of corn to get a bit more spice and veg in it. The sausage turned out to be a real treat, a nice change from ground beef.

I made this as a one-pot meal. I browned ground beef with chopped onion,two stalks of celery and three tablespoons of taco seasoning. When that was done I added a 28 ounce can of diced tomatoes, 1 1/2 cups of long grain white rice and two cups of chicken stock. I covered it and cooked it on medium for about 25 minutes. I added 1 1/2 cups of cheddar cheese and 3/4 cup of sour cream off heat just before serving. The consistency is a little on the wet side but the flavor was great and only one pan to clean. Thanks for the idea.

Really liked this as a base recipe but did not find it all that spicy.  Next time I will use hamburger meat with taco seasoning(as another reviewer suggested),a can of spicy rotel, sauteed onion, and a dash of cumin.

This is a great base recipie.. It looked so yummy I had to try it. I used Hot Italian sausage to kick it up a bit and used a can of tomato with chilies (the milder version) which also spiced it up... It got raves and the left overs were even better the next day! I will make this again and again!

I made this with Italian sausage.  Based on all the great reviews, I thought it would be great but it wasn't.  Maybe the type of sausage I used wasn't right.  The hubby liked it though and we ate it on tortillas.

This was tasty and very filling.  I added a medium sautéed onion and used about a half-pound of diced pork loin instead of sausage, and Monterey Jack in place of most of the cheddar, since that's what I had on hand.  
I also cooked the rice in some left-over liquid from cooking red beans in pork broth, and added some of the red beans to the recipe (maybe a cup of cooked beans).  
The picante sauce I used was medium, but frankly, this could have stood to be kicked up a notch.  Maybe some extra diced jalapenos or green chilis, and I probably missed out on some flavor in using pork loin instead of sausage.  
It's really quite good but there's just something missing.  Once I figure that out, it'll be fabulous.

The base recipe looked good, but I will admit that I did add some chopped jalapeños, fresh cilantro, cumin, and I used chorizo as the sausage. Very tasty. I used it as a side dish for tacos...

It was a very easy recipe and I really enjoyed it as well!  I'll be looking forward to these leftovers~
My personal touches were:
-used sage ground pork
-cooked an onion, about 1/3 of a red bell pepper and 1/2lb of cut green beans in the fat left behind by the pork in the pan and added that as well
-cooked the rice in chicken stock rather than water

I turn this into a full meal, one dish casserole by pumping up the veggies.  I add onion, green chilis, chopped tomato, black olives, and bell pepper, and use spicy garlic salsa. Ground beef works well instead of sausage. I cut the sour cream by 1/2 and it's still good. This is one of my "go to" recipes for weeknight dinners and pot lucks.

Fast and easy and an excellent way to change day old rice in a rice cooker to a tasty and substantial winter comfort food.  Since I live in Japan and used less rice for dinner than I expected last night, I was looking for a shortcut for dinner tonight. All ingredients were as listed with the exception of substituting lean ground beef (spiced with garlic and a healthy dash of chili powder) for the sausage (which is impossible to find here).  If you're going to use a toaster oven, you need to substantially up the time and lower the temp to about 150C.  I covered the casserole dish with foil until just five minutes before serving to keep from scorching the cheese.

I am not a fan of long grain rice, and not really a fan of rice casseroles...but this recipe truly hit the ball out of the park, and it will be a keeper for us. I used chorizo sausage to try to make it spicier...and I added avocado slices across the top before baking. Oh, and I steamed some cob corn, cut the kernels and added them for a sweet taste...soooo delicious. Quite honestly, this recipe could have stopped at mixing in the chorizo (and corn) to the rice...it was so delicious. The sour cream add was a nice touch, but it could have just as well been served with sour cream :)

Awesome recipe!  I have eaten it as a side and added it to tortilla shells to make quick burritos.  So good!

I wasn't very impressed with this recipe. I did use ground pork seasoned with taco seasoning, so maybe it would be better with the sausage. It was just really flat and bland.

This recipe unaltered is excellent!  The last time I made it I changed it some, I used chicken instead of sausage and I sauteed 1/2 red bell pepper, 1 serrano pepper, and 1 small red onion with the chicken.  My husband and son are very picky eaters and they devoured this!

I made this rice for the first time last night.  Mmm, mmm, good.  It was absolutely delicious.  I did cook the rice in chicken broth because I saw that one of the other people who rated this meal did it that way.  I don't know how much of a difference the broth made but it sure was good.  My girlfriend thought it was very good too but a little too spicy.  Of course you have the power to make it as spicy or nonspicy as you want.  I like things very spicy so I bought "hot" picante sauce, but you could buy medium or mild if you prefer.  Definitely a new recipe for my pleasureable eating experiences.
Thank You!

Everyone loved this recipe, and it's so easy to make. We had a rice sharing Mother's Day get together with friends and family, and everyone devoured this dish.

I have to admit I loved this.  I know it was fattening, I just didn't want to sub low-fat or fat free. Thanks. Will make again but not too often, because of the fat.

Bland and full of calories.  I was glad I had not made it for guests as I often like to try new recipes with my friends and family.  Plus, it was not spicy at all.

Not a fan of this recipe...I was excited to try it, but I couldn't use any of it.
