WATCH OUT. This is a good salad, but this recipe is WRONG. You use only 2 tbsp. of the reserved pineapple juice in the cooked dressing part, not all of it. The mixture you cook has to be thick like a pudding and it won't thicken with that much pineapple juice.

You can use mini marshmallows, dark cherries instead of white ones if you can't find the white ones and mandarin oranges if you don't want to peel oranges.

This is a great recipe!  I used two cups of Mandarin Oranges instead of the fresh orange pieces and mini marshmellows instead of  quartered ones.  It turned out great and so easy!!I've also made this using a large tub of cool whip in place of the heavy cream.  It's a great recipe:)

I used to make this recipe a long time ago, from the BH&G cookbook.  I, too, was confused by the amount of pineapple juice to add.  To get two cups of pineapple, I had to open two cans.  I didn't see a stated amount to add to the dressing, altho I sure didn't think adding all that I reserved would work!!  The cooked part of the dressing didn't thicken that much on it's own (and I use jumbo eggs), but after mixing with the whipped cream, I was satisfied with the texture.  (And still am, the day after.)  My salad didn't get watery and the dressing certainly was not too thick.  Next time I may add a little more sugar to the dressing or maybe some to the whipping cream, as this salad was not very sweet.  I don't have a sweet tooth and don't like my food overly sweet, but this could use a bit more sweetness.  Or I'll stick to the ambrosia recipe from the back of the Dole can...faster, cheaper, and, maybe not better, but certainly just as good!!

this is a very easy salad to prepare, plus you can make it a day ahead.  i use fruit cocktail instead of the cherries and a can of mandarins instead of the fresh oranges.

I have a similar recipe where you melt the marshmallows as you cook the egg mixture.  It helps to thicken it up.

This is very similar to what I grew up with, but since I never liked it as a kid (it was never sweet enough - looked yummy, tasted like vinegar) I have modified a few elements to make it a little more delectable. The suggested amount of 2 tbsp of reserved juice worked perfectly. Be sure not to use any more vinegar than specified - apple cider vinegar worked well just the right amount of zing. Make sure all the egg white is separated - those little bits hanging on can form clumps in your custard. Be sure to stir constantly with a whisk as it thickens. I used 1/2 amount of sugar and threw a handful of marshmallows into the custard as it cooled and stirred until it was all melted (this helps cool the custard as well as add a little "fluff". I also added powdered sugar to the whipped cream til it was slightly sweet (about 3 tbsp) I used 2 jars of dole tropical fruit drained well as it tends to be less mushy and tastes better than the canned stuff. I think what people forget is that this is an OLD recipe and when I was a kid canned fruit was packed in HEAVY syrup! So as the mixture sat the sweetness from the fruit made the entire salad sweet (Hence 24hrs). Today most of the fruit is packed in natural juice and really doesn't taste sweet at all. So taste everything before you mix it together people! Don't just follow a recipe and then be upset at your results... If you refrigerate your fruit ahead of time and sweeten everything to your liking you really do not have to wait 24hrs!

Our family makes this every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas!  We substitute mini marshmallows, use Bing (dark sweet) cherries, green seedless grapes and skip the oranges - but essentially the same recipe.  As an option, we sometimes add chopped walnuts. YUM

Thank you for posting this! My Mom made this all the time - mostly at Christmas. It really does need to sit for 24 hours to let the flavors develop and also gel. I always double this for a large crowd, but use only 2 T white vinegar instead of 4. Like someone said, the 2 T of canned juice is adequate. Might not even be necessary. Just taste as you go along when melting the mix over the stove in a double boiler. We always melt that marshmallows right into the sauce - because it adds to the 'gel' and also alot of people just don't like the look or feel of marshmallows.

I cut up a firm apple, leave skin on, and add 1/2 C walnuts. Be sure your custard is completely cool before adding to the whip cream. Also, whip cream until hard peaks, not soft peaks. When the salad sits overnight it will be too runny with soft peaks. It is yummy and worth the work you put into it. I also use fruit cocktail (big can)instead of oranges with a small can of mandarin oranges. I don't use the pineapple. My family requests this salad every Thanksgiving and Christmas.
