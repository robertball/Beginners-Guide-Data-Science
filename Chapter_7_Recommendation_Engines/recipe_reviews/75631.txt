As written, I'm not overly impressed with the taste/results of this recipe, but I can tell that with very little adjustment and change, it will be an excellent addition to my standard collection.  Many other people said they neglected to add the tomatoes to the recipe and after trying mine, I wished I had not added them, as well.  I had to sprinkle more salt over top of the result and I wish I'd included some minced garlic when cooking up the onions...  just a few things I will be sure to do the next time I make this!

This quiche was delicious and easy and quick to make.  I put it in two deep dish pie crusts and cooked/fried the onions in oil and seasoned with granulated garlic and salt before adding to quiche to speed things up a bit and give it a good flavor. I left out the tomato. I used 1 cup of cheese instead of 1/2 c and sprinkled parmesan cheese on top.  The italian seasoning was good, but next time I will use just garlic, basil and oregano individually, as I don't care for italian seasoning very much.   Basically, you can add and leave out so many things as long as you stick to the base items and it will turn out incredible.  Great taste and texture, esp. if you don't like the egginess of regular quiche! 5 STARS!!! THANKS!!!

I love quiche, and had never tried Lentil's so I gave this a try.  I used egg beaters liquid egg for the eggs, skim milk for the milk and low fat chedder cheese.  The quiche came out nicely and I have added this recipe to my vegetarian recipe folder.

This is by far one of the best quiche recipes I've every had...I love that there is no pastry!! After reading the other reviews I also increased the spices....Using fresh herbs - parsley, coriander, basil - and dried oregano and sage....I also added a little nutmeg and think I will put even more nutmeg next time. I also only cooked the lentils for about 15 min. and stir-fried my onion to save time. This was just a fabulous dish!! Thanks so much for sharing!

I really liked this quiche. I omitted the onion and tomato, cut the salt in half, and added a dash of garlic powder. I used 2 cups of frozen cut broccoli, since thats what I had on hand. I also just mixed the lentils, cheese (shredded cheddar and monterrey jack blend), and broccoli together in the pot I cooked the lentils in and then poured it into the dish. I also added a sprinkling of cheese on top. I only cooked my lentils for 10 minutes and I used a 9x11" baking dish, baked it for just under 35 minutes. Came out beautifully, I think it would also be really good with cauliflower.

I love this recipe because I have all the things in my pantry or fridge. I did not put the broccoli on top of the lentils to steam and I only cooked the lentils for ten minutes. That really cut down on time. I think I like this recipe best of all because it taste great the next day. Be sure too add the cheese!

this may be the best quiche i've ever had. the vegetables filled 2 9-inch crusts (not deep dish), but i needed a little extra egg and milk. i just threw tons of spices in there, like oregano, basil, parsley, rosemary, thyme, and sage. the lentils filled out the taste well.

Good....I substituted brocolli for corn and it tasted fabulous! Used a bit of blue cheese, feta and no cheddar and it was great....Remember to let it cool!

This recipe is amazing and exceptionally adaptable which really suits my cooking style. Once I had got started - the onions were already in the oven - I realised I didn't have all the ingredients. I didn't have dried lentils so I used a can of lentils. I didn't have broccoli florets so I used frozen peas and corn. I don't do milk or cheese so I used water instead of the milk and half a cup of nutritional yeast instead of the cheese. I had a packet of mushrooms which had reached their sell by date and since I had already 'murdered' this recipe I threw them in as well. I'm a new gluten free dairy free vegetarian and so am on a learning curve with my family kicking and squealing all the way. I am pleased to report that they gobbled this up like there was no tomorrow and I have had to promise that it will be a regular feature at our dinner table. Of course, now I can't wait to make it as it was supposed to be made!

This recipe is great. I have been looking to cut down meat in my diet and this dish is great for protein. I opted out of the cheese and added half a sweet potato and about 1/2 cup of sliced butternut squash(thinly sliced) to the onions while they were grilling. These gave it a nice texture and a bit more flavour. Didn't have italian seasoning so i added fresh basil and oregano, next time I'll add much more salt and pepper.

It was between a three and a four. I really wanted to love this as all of the ingredients are in my faves. I doubled it and put it in a casserole dish and it was very quick and easy so it does have that going for it.

This quiche turned out SPECTACULARLY! I've always loved quiche but had never even imagined making it with lentils. My husband and I have stopped eating red meat and this is such a great vegetarian meal. I followed the recipe almost exactly, with great results!

Came out great!  As usual, I made some changes based on what I had in the house and preferences -- no onion/olive oil, no tomatoes (based on recommendations, served with salsa instead), and basil/oregano/parsley instead of Italian seasoning.  For the cheese, I used 3 slices of 2% cheddar cheese and placed it on top.  My husband ate half for lunch.  We loved it and I will make again.

This was absolutely delicious! Like several other reviewers, I left out the tomatoes, and sauteed the onions on the stovetop with a bit of garlic powder. Followed the other measurements exactly. Definitely a keeper, and it will get made often. Looks easy enough to experiment with other veggies, too. Thanks so much for sharing.

This is a fantastic recipe! Simple, tasty, and healthy. A few quick notes: the lentils needed more than 2c of water - 2c was absorbed before the lentils were cooked. I needed to increase the eggs to 6 and add a little extra milk to get enough egg mixture to cover the other ingredients. Added red pepper flakes, oregano and garlic.

Yum!! I made this exactly as written the first time I made it and it was so delicious! But it's a perfect recipe to tweek to your liking. The second time around I pre-cooked the broccoli just a bit in the microwave prior to placing on the lentils to finish cooking. (I don't like my cooked veggies 'crunchy', I like them cooked.) And I added sauted mushrooms and I loved that addition! You can also play fast and loose with the flavor of cheese you use - shredded swiss adds a great flavor.

Sorry to be a downer but we really did not like this recipe.  It is indeed mild on the eggs - too mild and it doesn't hold the rest of the ingredients together well.  The lentils were vvery bland and the Italian seasoning floated right back up to the top.  We only ate a small serving each and now I am trying to think of ways to remix and use up the leftovers - which is most of it.  Mostly a waste of energy, although I did eat a few vegetables I might not have otherwise.

This is a great recipe. I chopped the tomatoes and placed them on pie dish and seasoned. Instead of baking the onions, I sauteed with garlic. I added some chicken boullin to the lentils. Added a layer of sourcream over the lentil mixture and spread with cheese! Excellent!

Excellent recipe!  I put about a tsp. of minced garlic in with the onions as they were cooking.  Instead of fresh tomatoes, I used about 1/4 c. sundried tomatoes in olive oil.  I didn't have a full two cups of broccoli so I used about 1.5 cups broccoli and half a cup of cut green beans.  No need to add cheese.  It was very tasty and lower in fat and calories without it.  I'll definitely make this again and maybe throw in mushrooms next time.

This was yummy. I made some changes due to ingredients that I had on hand and the size of my family. It turned out so well with the changes though that I'll probably keep it that way. I fried up the onion with a little oil and pressed 2 cloves of garlic with it. I used a 16 oz bag of California Blend frozen vegetables instead of the broccoli and I left the tomatoes out all together. I did double up the eggs, milk and lentils and used a 9x13 baking dish for the cooking. We're a family of 5 and I was concerned the the original recipe would not be enough. I didn't have Italian seasoning so I used some parsely, coriander and basil.  With the cheese I used 2 cups; 1 cup mixed in with the eggs, lentils and vegetables and the other cup sprinkled on top. I baked for the recommended 45 minutes and that was perfect. Let it set for 10 minutes to cool and then served it right up. It was great!! Thanks for the recipe. I would never have thought to have combined eggs with lentils. Being a vegetarian tasty and nutritious dishes can be hard to come by. This one meets all requirements in one. Thanks again!

The absolute best quiche recipe.  I added minced garlic to the onions and changed the broccoli to spinach.  I did add about 5 small chopped tomatoes unlike the others... but it just serves to how versitile this recipe is.  Even if you don't think you will like it... try it... I ate half myself... Enjoy!

This was excellent!  Will definitely make again!  Only change: pressed a few garlic cloves into the onion and oil mixture before the first bake.

This has become a regular at my house.  My husband and kids love it!  You can use any vegetable in place of the broccoli.  Kale and spinach are good as well.  I usually add some garlic powder to the egg mixture.  Cooks evenly every time.  I have recently given up dairy and I have substituted coconut milk and added a T of nutritional yeast with good results.

I liked this quiche because it had a plethora of different fillings.  I loved the idea of sneaking some lentils into it to give it more protein and tastes really great too.

Delicious!  I substituted the broccoli with zucchini and baked that with the onions at the beginning.  The lentils give the quiche a "meaty" texture, and the Italian seasonings add lots of flavor.  I will definitely be making this again!

I love it! It is extremely light even with the cheese added, and you feel like you can eat quite a bit because it does not feel heavy! I added extra seasonings of herbs de province, and more salt. Delicious!!!!

I thought this quiche was delicious!  The only changes I made were adding 2-3 cloves of fresh garlic to the onions, while I cooked them on the stovetop.  I also put in dried oregano, basil and thyme instead of an Italian seasoning.  I doubled the recipe and baked it in a glass casserole dish (baked it for the same amt. of time).  It was so easy to make, and the entire family loved it (even my three elementary kiddos)!

Good but not great. Needed some kick ... maybe garlic would help. Italian seasoning was a little strong.

I used some beans on bottom also.  Just sauteed and seasoned vegies I had, and garlic. Not over cooked so the celery was still crunchy  added 1/2 c. pumpkin to liquids.  Used very little cheese. No tomatoes.  Was well received!

My husband and I thought this was great. I had to make some modifications because I only had one 9 inch (not deep dish) pie pan so.... I cut it down to two eggs and 1/2 c. milk, but I could have added 3 eggs and would have been fine. I used mozzarella cheese instead and chopped up the broccoli with the stems for added texture. Overall, it was a great recipe and a good base for adding whatever you want!

I loved the idea of quiche with lentils.  I made a whole wheat pie crust with my quiche.  Added red/green/yellow bell peppers and omitted the tomatoes.  Added 2 more eggs and used soy in lieu of milk.  I like lots of flavor, texture, and eggs. Awesome base recipe tailored to my taste.  Thanks!

I like to cook vegetarian meals at least 3 times a week.  This meal was ok.  It lacked some flavor and the lentils were to much.  I'd rather use the lentils for soup than this quiche.

I used a deep dish pie crust and barely got all of my ingredients into it. The flavor was okay but the recipe was easy to do so I'll probably make it again. I'll probably add parmesan cheese to this dish the next time I make it.

Very good. I used red lentils, roma tomatoes and used quite a bit of black pepper. I cut the salt down to 1/3 tsp. I sprinkled a bit of parmesan cheese on top right before putting it in the oven. I didn't have to drain any water off of the lentils before adding the broccoli, as red lentils seem to soak a lot of it up. The lentils made for a sort of interesting texture, but this was easy to throw together and tasty.

This was so good. I give it 4 stars because the recipe as is, would be pretty bland, I think. After reading other reviews, I altered the recipe slightly. I needed to use up some cauliflower and had frozen spinach, so I used just over a cup (give or take) of that combo. I don't really like Italian seasoning mixes, so I used Herbs de Province that I sautéd in with onions and some garlic. I used veggie broth to cook the lentils-and cooked few mins longer than the recipe called for-I thought they needed to be a bit softer. And I doubled the cheese. It fit perfectly in my deep dish 9-inch pie plate.  I misread the cooking time and ended up cooking it about 30 mins longer than the recipe called for, but it needed the extra cook time. The lentils, cauliflower, and spinach combo was pretty wet, so I think if I'd cooked it only 45 mins, it wouldn't have been nearly as good. The "crust" was nice and brown and it was SO flavorful. I've already eaten my leftovers for breakfast. The hubs loved it and took some to work for his lunch today. I'll be making this again SOON and recommending to my mother!

This turned out really well! Some slight modifications:
I started with sauteing red onion and chopped garlic in olive oil. When they were starting to go translucent, I spread them out on the bottom of a 13x9 pan. I boiled the lentils as described, and separately sauted celery, mushrooms, carrot, & broccoli. I put the lentils through a strainer and then added the veggies and lentils to the pan on top of the onions. Added a layer of shredded cheddar and pepperjack cheese. Covered with 7 eggs and some milk with spices. Baked for about 50 minutes until the top turned golden brown.

I admit, I'm bad about leaving reviews even though I use many, many recipes on this site.  This is one of the few that really moved me to leave my 2 cents.  I've had quiche before and always found it pretty bland (I need spice!) but I made this pretty much as written and it was really good!  I'm trying to follow a "clean" eating plan and this was an excellent, healthier replacement for my usual fatty sausage and frozen hash brown breakfast casserole.  Next time I'll use my large muffin pan, it makes perfect serving size portions and cuts cooking time.  Thanks Wonder79!

Never would have thought to add lentils to a quiche but we loved it, with a  few tweaks I learned from other reviewers.  I sautéed the onions, along with some garlic to save time.  I omitted the tomatoes, used asparagus instead of broccoli because that's what I had, at least doubled the Italian seasoning and added some nutmeg.  The whole family loved it (husband, 6 yo and 3 yo).  It filled one deep dish pie plate perfectly.  I was a little leery of a crustless quiche but it set up nicely and didn't stick to the pie plate.

It was on the bland side but too much dry seasoning taste, needs more cheese for sure, like the lentils may try to make it again with a twist

This was the best lentil dish I have ever had.  I had a bag of black lentils sitting in the cabinet for about a year and didn't know what to do with them.  This receipe was delicious.  I made 2 quiches and had the extra one for lunch over the next couple of days reheated in the microwave with extra cheese melted on top.  

As other reviewers suggested, I did not add the tomato.  I made the mistake of adding salt to the lentils as they were cooking (my idea, not in the receipe), but it wasn't necessary and next time I won't do that.  

The kids even ate it and didn't complain.  I plan to make this regularly.

Excellent recipe! I would have never thought to add lentils to quiche. I added 3 strips chopped turkey bacon and, per other recommendations for more spice, FRESH basil and parsley (about a TBSP of each). My husband loves extra flavor, too. It was fantastic!

Liked this recipe, with some of the changes mentioned in other reviews. I always cook lentils in veggie broth. I also added one minced garlic and whatever cheese I had in the fridge (I think it was Parmesan)as well as one tsp oregano and one tsp basil instead of Italian seasoning. I liked the idea of the tomato, but took other reviewers recommendations and did not add it into the quiche. I added the chopped fresh tomato as a topping at the end instead. Pretty quick and painless and everyone enjoyed it!

This recipe needed a lot of help to get the flavor going.  The texture was good, but, we had to fresh ingredients to get any amount of flavor in the dish.  It fell flat.  Not on my list of things to make again.

I enjoyed this quiche very much - I liked the diversity of texture within it due to the lentils.  My girlfriend didn't love it... she thought that quiche should be smoother, without the toothiness of lentils.  She also felt that a quiche should have a crust, so this may be more frittata-like.  So, a slightly mixed review in my house.  

I did find that I had to cook the lentils for the full 20 minutes, unlike some previous comments.  I made a couple of minor modifications: as others did, I omitted the tomatoes.  I also sautéed the broccoli florets and onions with a clove of garlic instead of baking the onion in the pie pan.  I did this so I could prepare it ahead of time and put the pre-made quiche in the fridge to bake later (which worked fine).  I also added some shredded mild cheddar/jack mix as well as some shredded Parmesan cheese.  I think the cheese is necessary.

Left out the tomatoes partly based on the other suggestions and added a bit of garlic salt. 
Delicious!

Excellent! I didn't use any tomatoes and substituted the Italian seasoning w/ Herbs de Provence with success. Be sure to really drain the lentils so you don't end up with a wet quiche. This recipe works :)

My oldest and I loved this....hubby and youngest...so-so.... I used red onion, a bag of rozen broccoli which I steamed in the microwave, a carton of Eggbeaters Eggwhites, and a splash of skim milk. I did use some shredded cheddar as well. Really yummy, healthy and protein packed. The lentils made a nice crust on the bottom. Thanks for a different kind of quiche!

I thought this was great - a smart twist on quiche. Left out tomatoes bc I didn't have any but would add halved cherry tomatoes in future. I did the onions (added garlic) in a frying pan and next time would add the cooked lentils to the frying pan to cook off some of the water as the original recipe suggests. I used red lentils which cook up fast and kind of vanish in the dish (dH didn't even know it had lentils in it!). I  think swiss cheese would be a great addition.

I loved this recipe.  I used red lentils which I really liked because it seemed like crust.  I also increased eggs to 6 and milk to 1 1/2 cups to fill over veggies.  I used a deep dish pyrex pie plate.  I also used Gruyère cheese, 1/2 which I put on top of ingredients before I poured egg milk mixture but it made a beautiful glaze over top.  I used basil and lemon thyme to season because that I what I had.  One of my kids ate it with fresh salsa over it.  We will definitely be making this again thoughout the summer.  I can think of other veggies that could be used.  I loved the fresh tomato taste as well.

Love this quiche, reading other views, I read one that sauted the onions, and I opted to do that also with garilc and olive oil. It was even great cold the next day! Love it!

This was a nice veggie dish.  I sauteed the onions with some baby portabellas and omitted the tomatoes.  Next time I'll add one egg, up the salt to 2tsps and put the cheese on top instead of mixed in with the other ingredients.

I found this dish tasty enough but not striking in flavor.  I thought is was common place in its Italian flavor. I added some mozzarella to my serving to give it a little boost and it desperately needed some salt. I doubt that I'll make it again because I think it's rather boring. That's too bad because it's very healthy and I feel like I'm doing something good for my body when I eat such a dish.

Very nice recipe that will complement a lot of other dishes.  All I added was some spinach and chopped artichokes and the can of savoury tomatoes.  Super easy and the whole family (kids are 10 and 4) enjoyed it.

wow! Really surprisingly good. I substituted zucchini for the broccoli, since it's in season, and I poured everything into a deep dish pie crust for a traditional quiche touch. Using a real pie crust made it so that there was too much egg mixture, though - so if I do this again, I'll cut the lentil and egg mixture in half, or else split the recipe between two pie crusts. If you have some zucchini lying around, try subbing it in this recipe - the combination was delicious. And I left out the tomatoes as other suggested - it was fine without them.

Loved it! I make this  weekly.  Sometimes I use broccoli, sometimes spinach, I even chop up a zucchini from time to time.  A can of diced tomatoes works if I don't have any fresh on hand.  Seriously, the possibilies are endless.  Don't skimp on the salt and pepper!

I made a half batch of this, and it will be a regular around these parts now because it's delicious! I used this as a base- I changed a lot in this recipe- the biggest was the lack of crust.  I used a sheet of puffed pastry and draped it into a 10 inch cast iron skillet which turned out beautifully!  For the onions I caramelized them in the same skillet I would be making the lentils in with some white wine, salt and black pepper; I'm very glad I did because it gave the onions more flavor and cooked though out nicely.  I added some corn to it, used canned tomatoes, instead of italian seasoning, I used parsley, oregano, thyme and some sage, which was very inviting and delicious.  I placed the onions into a separate bowl once caramelized and then cooked my lentils in chicken stock adding water when needed, added broccoli, and poured that into the onion bowl with the rest of the veggies.  I shredded some aged white cheddar and some le gruyere for the cheese and it was marvelous!  The half batch fed my husband and I for dinner and now we have just enough for breakfast in the morning.  It all fits nicely in the 10 in skillet... I'm going to make this again, and keep experimenting with it as I go.  Good base, but as others have said, it sounds a little bland alone.

Surprisingly my husband even liked this quiche. You can't taste the lentils much, next time I might increase them.  Cheese is a must. Next time I might add some sauted garlic.

Didn't like it, sorry...I thought the lentils broke up the texture of the quiche too much. I like mine much firmer. Tasted okay but won't make it again.

The recipe was a good way of using a lot of good ingredients and it has potential to be a very nice dish.  I gave it three stars because the flavor was lacking, and I thought that broccoli was not the best choice (broccoli absorbs too much water). If I make it again, I would add even more cheese (I added a cup of jack and cheddar to this one); I would replace the broccoli with spinach, as some other cooks did; and I would season the lentils better while cooking,and add more salt in general. Finally, I would probably add some cheese to the top.

I picked this recipe because I had some of the ingredients in the kitchen and thought I could make it work.
I used frozen spinach instead of broccoli, basil, garlic, and oregano instead of italian seasoning, mozarella cheese instead of cheddar, and totally forgot to add the tomatoes and the recipe still turned out very, very tasty. Will be making this again!

Amazing!!! I changed just a little based on availability and taste. No tomatoes. Added mushroom. Frozen instead of fresh broccoli and doubled cheese and herbs (because yum). Crazy delicious. My husband and I destroyed our slices so quick. It is less dense than normal quiche, but those lentils are so yummy we didn’t care about texture.

I added crust, because I made one expecting quiche to need a crust, garlic, tarragon, and mushrooms. It was good but could have used a more flavorful cheese and some added spice. Next time I'll add some more garlic and spices.

I was so disappointed with the flavor of this dish, especially given the wonderful smell as it came out of the oven!
It was interesting, it was healthy, it just tasted pretty bland.  I sort of felt it needed more cheese?  More salt?  ....something

My husband, my 2 kids, and I were not crazy about this recipe. Maybe because we had never had lentils before. Also the amount of Italian seasoning was a lot.

Baking it now... i love that this recipe minimizes dirty dishes...I didn't have tomatoes so I used about a tablespoon of tomatoe paste and spaghetti sauce. an after thought, next time i will add mushrooms in with the onions and spinach in with the broccoli.

Didn't have broccoli or mushrooms, but used fresh asparagus in place of broccoli and cooked according to broccoli directions. Also, used fresh yellow tomatoes. Used broth in place of water in lentils. It came out very moist and yummy! Ate over/with mashed cheesy potatoes and garlic rosemary bread. Yum! Will make again and try with different vegetables. High protein healthy vegetarian dish!

This is very good and easy to make.  All of the ingredients are fresh and on hand.  Everyone at dinner said it was the best quiche  and they had seconds.  I served it with brown bread, salad, and sautéed summer squash and mushrooms.

Good basic recipe... surprisingly and satisfyingly rich and hearty.  My favorite is just as printed but substituting thin sliced carrots and cauliflower florets for the broccoli. I also used plain almond milk for the dairy and make sure it's a sharp Cheddar!!

This is a bit too bland to our liking.  I changed things up to add flavor, which improved this to a 4 star rating.  Sauteed onion and garlic instead of baking.  Omitted the dried Italian seasoning and used fresh thyme, oregano, sage and rosemary.  Also, blanching fresh broccoli florets first is helpful.

Considering its healthfulness, this was a very good recipe.  It's an easy, basic recipe that has endless possibilities.  I have made it 3 times with different combinations of veggies and herbs I  had on hand (I always keep the ratio 2 c green veggie to 1 c other veggie).  So far, my favorite has been with red onion, 2 c shredded zucchini (squeeze out excess water before adding to the dish), 1 c chopped baby bella mushrooms, and 2 t dill weed.  I use red lentils, since they are already split they lend a much smoother consistency when they cook down.  I find this dish to be incredibly satisfying, and I actually prefer the taste after it has sat in the fridge overnight, allowing the flavors to "marry" and been reheated.

I liked the Quiche. I added some hot spices to the egg mixture. Very glad I did. My husband asked me what kind of meet I added (I didn't add any- way to go Lentils). So over all it was a hit in my house.

It was good but not great.  I think it would have been aweful/flavorless if I didn't follow suggestions from the reviewers.  I sauted the onions and 2 cloves of garlic (minced) in olive oil in a non-stick pan.  I didn't add tomatoes.  For seasoning I did 1 tsp basil, 1 tsp oregano, 1/2 tsp pepper, 1/2 salt.  I cooked it in a 8 x 10 pyrex.  It was done in 35 minutes.

This recipe was very tasty. I don't know why others said to omit the tomatoes. I added canned tomatoes that were pre-seasoned and it was delicious!! Also, I used 3 eggs instead of 4 which was fine but it would have held together better with 4.

This has become a staple recipe of ours.  I have followed the recipe but usually I don't use tomatoes and I use ham or turkey bacon instead of the lentils.  It's good either way.

This is my new fave dish.  I can't think you enought for posting it!  It is quick, flavorful, and healthy. I will be making this weekly for a healthy breakfast dish.  Made the following modifications: egg whites only, no salt, Greek seasoning instead of Italian, and Italian flavored canned diced tomatoes for fresh (I don't like fresh tomatoes). The dish far exceeded my expectations!

This was just ok.  The Italian seasoning was to overpowering and I used corn instead of tomatoes because I do not care for mushy Quiche.

The taste of this dish was pretty decent, but I can't think of any reason texture-wise, why I would ever put lentils in my eggs again.  My lentils were plenty well cooked, I just didn't care for the combination of textures, and I don't generally have food-texture issues.

Delicious - I added garlic and used an extra teaspoon of Italian seasoning.  Cooked the onion and garlic in with the lentils and then mixed everything else in when they were done.  Also used a few different types of cheeses that I had in the fridge.

I made this for my 9 year old daughter and I one evening. We thought it was very tasty. I added more seasonings.

Great and easy recipe.  I did use a pie crust just because I love crusts.  Tastes wonderful!

This was a great recipe to make. I used a frozen pie crust because I prefer quiche with a crust. I added some left over spinach and some frozen corn to the mixture and it turned out very tasty. I would certainly make this again.

Really very good. I used spinach instead of broccoli, with parmesan cheese, and it went well with the italian seasonings. It also held together great with the parm... I was worried it would be crumbly. Really delicious. Just the lentils alone, without the egg mixture on top, were really good.

This is such a great recipe.  I usually use spinach instead of broccoli and like to add mushrooms and sometimes a few extra eggs.  This is great to make if you don't want to think too hard about dinner cause its always good.

Wow! Great recipe, the quiche came out absolutely delicious! I added a larger variety of vegetables, in addition to broccoli I also put in some mushroom and carrots. I will definitely make this again

This recipe is fantastic. I first made it when I was a novice cook at the tender age of 16 and it even turned out for me. It was easy and my vegetarian boyfriend loves it.

This was very easy to prepare.  The Italian seasoning gave this dish a nice burst of flavor mixed with the veggies.  I will be making this again.
