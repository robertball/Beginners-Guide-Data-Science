After trying this in a local itallian restaraunt, I wanted to try it at home.  After reading several recipes, I selected this one because of the thickened sauce.  This was as good as the restaraunt's chicken! I could only find Marsala Cooking wine, so I left out the salt-because the cooking wine is salty enough.  I doubled the sauce so there was enough for the pasta, and made crusty garlic bread to go with.  Wonderful, and easy!

For heaven's sake... DON'T use cooking wine. If you wouldn't drink it, you shouldn't cook with it. You can buy a decent Marsala for under $10. I use Conti-Royale. The next day I use the leftover Marsala to make a killer French Onion Soup. Fresh mushrooms and FRESH basil really make this dish pop, and I always add a couple cloves of minced garlic and a few tablespoons of finely diced onion with the mushrooms. I've also played with the sauce and served it over pork and beef, switching it up with red wine, white wine, roasted peppers, and sliced onions. So easy to dress up dinner with a quick wine sauce.

Amazing recipe! The sauce was very flavorful and creamy, but not too heavy. I would recommend doubling the sauce ingredients, though. It came up a little short. I served this with egg noodles instead of linguine. Yum!

Delicious flavor, but the recipe instructions are a little misleading. After adding the wine, it should simmer longer than 2 minutes, otherwise the alcohol doesn't cook off and it tastes too boozy. Marsala can be strong, so it needs time to settle in with the rest of the flavors. Like the other reviewers, I doubled the sauce. There's enough for the chicken, but we wanted extra to put over angel hair.

This recipe has been the talk of my weekend and week. I made it last Friday and my family is still salivating over it! The chicken was so flavorful..if you want an easy baked/fried chicken taste..this works. 
I served over linguine with salad as the starter. You definitely need to double the sauce ingredients...You'll have just enough to drizzle on the pasta. I may triple it next time because we are saucey tips. 
Loved this recipe!!!

This was good. A little boozy-tasting for me, even after cooking for a while, so I mellowed it with a little chicken broth at the end, and it turned out fine. My husband is a big Marsala fan and he really loved it. Thanks!

I gave it four stars because my husband really loved it. It seemed a little salty to me, however. This may have been because I used cooking wine. I would also recommend low-sodium broth. If it needs a little punch, just add the salt yourself.

We didn't really care for the sauce, very strong wine flavor even after simmering it for a long time.  We usually like wine sauces, so I guess Marsala wine just isn't a favorite for us.  My son loved the chicken without the sauce.

This fell pretty short for us, it was just really bland even after adding extra seasoning to the flour coating and sauteeing onion and garlic with the mushrooms. Unlike other reviewers, I didn't think it was marsala-tasting enough. I'm not sure what would improve this. I love chicken marsala but this recipe really didn't do it for us.

Very easy and fast recipe. Great for nights when I don't have a lot of time. I followed the recipe with the exception of using Low Sodium Chicken Stock in place of broth and adding more of that stock in the end. Like a couple of other members, we found this a little too boozy without the additional stock. Also, I didn't think that 2 minutes of simmering was long enough to mellow out the Marsala and allow the alcohol to cook off. I will also double the sauce ingredients next time. With these little tweaks, it will be perfect for our taste.

Delicious and easy to make.  I only made 3 chicken breast.  I also felt like I didn't have enough of the mushroom sauce.  We only ate two of the breasts and had just enough for them.  Just a warning to double the wine/broth mixture if you like a lot of sauce.  I also had to use a little more olive oil than the recipe called for.  My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this.

If your looking for a "romantic evening" with a nice meal without having to go anywhere or pay a babysitter, this dish is easy and quick.  

Put the kids to bed and turn your dinning room into your own little Bistro for the night!

This is a no fail marsala recipe.  It tasted amazing, totally restaurant quality.   I needed to cook this for a party of 40 so I let the recipe calculator do it for me and it came out perfect.  I changed a few minor things:  I used fresh plain basil as opposed to dried sweet basil (so I used more obviously), and I used more mushrooms then called for because my sister loves them and it was for her birthday party.  Low cost, great tasting meal.  Thank you!

i mad this mothers day along with another dish.  everyone enjoyed this, not too overbearing with this amount of Marsala, I did however, pound the chicken to 1/2 inch...too thin and you can overcook it very quickly...cut breasts in half first for ease of cooking and handling.  Also use heavy duty freezer bag to pound chix....not completely seeled but will keep work area clean.

very good recipe.  I tweeked it a bit with the ingredients.  Instead of spices I used real onions and garlic and also added red sweet peppers.  Chopped all them up and sauted them with the chicken.  Overall my family loved this and I will be making it again.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is by far the best homemade Chicken Marsala recipe I've tried. Both hubby and I loved it. I made no changes to the recipe other than doubling the sauce. Served it over pasta.

This was the BEST Marsala recipe I've ever tried.  I did double the sauce amount for extra to add to the pasta.  It was a big hit in my house and I was asked to make it again for next week!

I prepared this recipe exactly as written except that I took another reviewer's advice and doubled the sauce ingredients...It was fairly easy to make although I think it takes longer than 15 minutes to prepare!  I found it tasty however, I made another Chicken Marsala recipe a few weeks ago and prefer that one...

This was pretty good.  I only used two chicken breasts because they were quite large and they did use up all the flour mixtue.  I also used vegetable broth instead of chicken because I had some open in the fridge.  Put over spaghetti.  Quick, easy and good...I'll be making this often.

I made this as directed, however, my mushrooms were not very fresh and I used Onion Powder and Garlic Powder but added no salt. It was very salty but honestly the quality of the Marsala sauce was not fantastic. I think if I had had the full amount of Marsala wine and enough fresh mushrooms it might have been better.

This was very easy to make. The chicken turned out great (tender, juicy, and just enough spice). Would make a great sandwich, or base for another dish as well :) The sauce needs work in my opinion. I think shallots and a tablespoon or two of butter might do it. If the chicken weren't so good, I would rate it a 2 overall. I would not make this again without changes.

This recipe came out pretty bland and when left alone it settled into a chunky mixture. With a couple changes though it came out pretty well. Also this recipe doesn't specify sweet or dry marsala wine. Dont try sweet def use Dry its much more flavorful.

I have to give it four stars because everyone raved about it- but in my opinion it is just okay. I have made it twice by the recipe with e exception of using real onions. Next time I am going to use real garlic and add some chopped roasted red peppers - it just doesn't seem to have that much favor, although the sauce is nice and thick and as I said, everyone loved it.

I loved the recipe yet modified it. Prior to sauteing mushrooms, I melted a tbsp of butter with 1/4 cup mince white onion and 4 minced garlic gloves for approx 5 minutes then added mushrooms and the other ingredients indicated. After tasting I had 1 tsp of worchestire sauce and it was perfect for my husband and I.

There are 2 versions oc Chiken Marsala. This one and the one that you just use Marsala, buuter and flour, basically. No cornstarch. In my opinion, after tasting  "Chicken Marsala" at various eateries, the cornstarch on is horrible!! I can't stand it!

Wonderful, but the alcohol was still there and took away from the wonderful spices and broth. I will take the reviewer's advice about simmering longer; I bet that will make it a 5 star recipe.

Loved it! Followed others' advice and tripled the sauce and used fresh basil and garlic and it was perfect!

Perfect recipe! The changes I made were minor, as I let the mushrooms saute in 1 tbs of butter along with minced garlic, pepper, 1 tsp of soy sauce, and thyme for an extra 5 minutes. Other than that, just a wonderful recipe overall!

Doubled everything to feed our small crowd and it was gobbled up in no time.  Having grown up with Dad preparing this meal (a NYC fireman, need I say more?) I never quite learned how to duplicate his amazing rendition . . . this recipe comes darn close.  Got lots of compliments and reqeusts to put this in our list of "must haves".  5 stars for sure!

This recipe was fast to prepare and so easy. Was well received by my husband and teenage son. Husband said it was just as good as a Fine Resturant. Served with egg noodles and green beans.

Great!  I used golden mushroom soup instead of chicken broth.  I also sauted shallots and garlic with the mushrooms.  I served over mashed potatoes with scallions.    Definately a keeper.

My kids don't like fresh mushrooms so I used canned. Sometimes, I don't have Marsala so have used other wine, didn't like the sherry, merlot is ok.

Eh, not very good. And I've never disliked a recipe from allrecipes.com. The sauce on this was not thick (and I kept adding corn starch) and it wasn't very flavorful. Not sure what went wrong, but it suxored.

This was very good!! I double the sauce and used extra mushrooms. I also simmered the sauce for much longer after adding the wine. It tasted pretty boozy after only 2 minutes. This is a very good starter recipe.

This was an awesome and very quick version!  I used double the amount of mushrooms and ingredients to make the sauce & served over egg noodles.  Wonderful - sauce thickened up nicely & was very tasty! Thanks!

I just made this last night for the 1st time, and it was very good! I followed some of the other's advice & doubled the liquid measures, but will triple it next time to have enough for the linguine. I also got nervous that the mushroom sauce was too watery, but after about 8-10 mins of simmering, it thickened up quite nicely! My husband & 4 kids loved it, and so I will surely be making this again!  PS, I also cut the chickens in 1/2 for easier cooking. Don't be afraid to add your own seasonings into the flour mixture to kick up the flavor!

Doubling the sauce is a must.
