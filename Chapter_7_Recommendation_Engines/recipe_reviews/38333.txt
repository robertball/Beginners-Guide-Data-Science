I really enjoyed this pasta dish and my husband said it was awesome.  Based on outher reviews that it lacked flavor, I added roasted red peppers and sun dried tomatoes.  I also used vegetable rotini because that's what I had on hand.  In case my guests wanted more cheese, I put some grated romano cheese on the table (which some guests used).  What's great about the dish is the unique combination of flavors without the usual feeling of heaviness you find with other pasta dishes.

This turned out great, bold and delicious. I followed the general suggestions regarding not enough sauce. I used more like 30 kalamatas, most of an older bell pepper, two jalapenos and seeds (although they were apparently mild as the dish had no heat), and approx. a cup of red wine. I used approx a cup of feta and cheddar, and per a previous suggestion, I tossed the feta with the pasta and sauce. I also tossed in artichoke hearts.

This is one of our favorite recipes we have found on this site. I omit the jalapeno peppers, use a mexican blend cheese instead of the cheddar and add diced chicken. I toss everything together in a lasagna pan and bake it. The red wine and kalamata olives really make this recipe delicious.

This dish was fantastic!  I wouldn't change a thing.  The kalamata olives are what really makes this dish so I wouldn't recommend substituting them, unless you really dislike them.  Be sure to fine chop them so they are well distributed throughout the dish.  I would say this dish feeds closer to 8 - 10 people.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe, Cindy!

I was a little wary of this recipe, as it seemed like a strange, fancy casserole.  I'm glad my love of kalamata olives and feta cheese won out.  This was fabulous - definitely a keeper.  And I agree with the earlier poster who reccomended extra cheese - can you ever have enough cheese, anyway?

I love Feta cheese and really wanted to try it in a recipe. Not only that, but I have a Vegetarian roomate, so I was excited about this recipe and it was fantastic! It's like a cooked pasta salad. I substituted black olives for the Kalamata olives since they aren't my thing, and to make it more mild, excluded the peppers. It was a great dinner and very light and filling. I think next time I'll add more cheese though, because I think at least a cup of cheddar and Feta should top it, and a hint of Parmesean.

This recipe was delicious.  The wine gave it a wonderful flavor but I think it could be left out.  My husband who is a very fussy eater also asked me to make it again.  Great recipe!

I thought this was okay as a side dish, but the kids thought it was boring. I think it needed more sauce and maybe some extra seasonings.

Easy to prepare, but why a casserole? Why not serve it as is? Also needs more zip. Maybe use a fresh, chopped jalapeno instead of canned? Or toss with salsa?

Good, but needs a little more flavor.  Perhaps more cheese, tomatoes & olives would do the trick.

It's ok.  Tasty, but I don't love it.  I added sundried tomatoes to add to the flavor and that was nice.  It's otherwise easy to cook, didn't take too long.

I was looking for a vegetarian main dish to bring to a potluck at work.  I tried this out on my family at home.  Everyone loved it.  I thought they were going to lick the pan clean!!  I used a red bell pepper and also added some fresh oregano.  Next time I'll layer the cheese instead of just putting it on top.

This came out pretty well.  I added way more feta than was recommended though--I also added most of the feta with the pasta, when I tossed it all in the sauce.  I also added some toasted pine nuts at that point because I had them on hand--they added nice flavor and crunch.

I doubled this recipe to make for a large group. It was fine, but nothing special. Feta is not a melting cheese and cheddar melts greasy. More kalamata olives and cheese would have made this more tasty and more of a true "melt". Otherwise, it was just a standard pasta dish with tomatoes.

This is delicious! My husband and I loved it. Only thing I did differently was that I used goat cheese and I mixed it with the pasta with the sauce. So good!

I was not very impressed with this recipe.  It had a nice flavor but I ended up with way more pasta then sauce (even used less pasta then called for!) probably won't make again.

Added extra spices.  Used 3/4 amt. of pasta.  Used mozzarella instead of cheddar.  Mixed part of the cheese with the pasta and put more cheese on top, in addition to grated parmesan.  Baked for 25 minutes.  Did not put under the broiler.  Served with Sangiovese.

We had this for dinner last night and the only problem with it is that it's way too easy to eat!  It really hit the spot.  

I made two small modifications because that's what I had in the house.  Instead of a jalapeno, I used 1/4 cup of pickled jalapenos and I only had a small bit of reduced fat cheddar, so I topped up the cheese with some Pepper Jack.  Very tasty!

needs more of something I can't figure it out and I really want to figure it out because now I have a huge bowl of pasta and sauce that I don't like.
