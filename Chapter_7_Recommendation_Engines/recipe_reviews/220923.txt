This was excellent!  I used leftover Honeybaked Ham for this.  I also used fresh pineapple since I had that on hand.  The creamy dressing I used was Honey Mustard II dressing from this site, and because of that I combined the honey mustard requirement with the creamy dressing requirement to make this.  I was thinking that this will be good tomorrow on a sandwich for lunch along with a couple of slices of ham.  I would definitely make this recipe again!  We loved it!

This was excellent!  I made it as directed using crushed pineapple in place of chopped pineapple since I couldn't find a small can of the chopped.  For the creamy salad dressing I used coleslaw dressing.  The serving sizes are huge! I served it over mixed lettuce greens and it turned out wonderful.  Update:  The second time I made this I used fresh pineapple -- definitely better, and increased the curry powder to 1/4 tsp because we love curry. Will definitely make this again and again!

I had some leftover canned ham and fresh pineapple to use and came across this recipe. I skipped the red pepper, used mayo in place of salad dressing, and used sweet pickle relish. I eyeballed all of the ingredients which came together in almost a tropical tasting salad. The curry was a nice addition; I  added more of that and as well as the garlic powder. Look forward to this for lunch during the week. Thanks for the easy and delicious recipe, Barbara!
