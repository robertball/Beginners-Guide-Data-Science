This is a great bread that does taste just like a cinnamon coffee cake!  I wanted to take it up a notch, so for the "middle", I used 1/4 c. of brown sugar vs. white, 1 & 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon and for a little crunch added 1/4 c. of finely chopped walnuts.  I did not swirl anything I just did a layer in between.  This baked up very nicely in exactly one hour.  I then drizzled a cinnamon glaze over top after it was slightly cooled: 1 c. confectioners sugar, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1 & 1/2 Tbsp. buttermilk (or milk) and 1/4 tsp. vanilla.

This recipe is a keeper!  I have been making it for years, since finding it in an issue of of Taste of Home or Quick Cooking magazine.  It makes a very good cinnamon coffee cake quick bread.  I often make it using Saco's buttermilk powder mixed with water to make buttermilk, as I typically do not stock fresh buttermilk in my refrigerator.  In place of this, baker can make a cup of "homemade" buttermilk/sour milk by adding a teaspoon of vinegar OR lemon juice into a measuring cup and adding enough liquid to equal one cup.

A baker can also make individual coffee cakes using muffin tins, or a pan that has multiple small round, square or rectangular baking compartments.  I work at a coffee house, and I make these as individual coffee cakes and drizzle them with a glaze of powdered sugar and milk.  They are a favorite of our customers.

The taste is very very good but cutting it up was somewhat difficult as the consistency was quite crumbly. 

Also, because I did not have any buttermilk, I "made" some in the following way:
1 cup of milk
1 tablespoon white vinegar
Mix and let sit at room temperature for 10-15 min

Made this a month ago, but had to go out of town so I ended up putting it in the freezer.  It had a wonderful cinnamon flavor and it was not crumbly at all, probably due to having froze it.  I personally ate 1/2 of it, family was lucky to get a slice.  I loved the crunchy top and next time I may make more topping because that was my favorite part.  I am now going to make another.

I thought this was totally awesome. It took me a bit longer to prepare it than I thought, but it turned out great. I made it for my family, only my mom has been able to try it so far, but she really liked it :}

Loved this recipe! My 7th grade students made it and it was a great recipe for them and it smelled soooo good while it was baking! I only cooked it for about 50 minutes though.
