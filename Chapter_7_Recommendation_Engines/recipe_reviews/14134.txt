I'm a huge fan of Microwave risotto.  Having experimented over time, I now add a dash of light cream at the end and stir it through and this makes a big difference and brings it closer to a traditionally made risotto.  I vary the recipe depending on what I have in the fridge and often add semi-dried tomato, cherry tomatoes, mushrooms, onion, baby spinach, a can of chopped tomatoes (including the liquid), cheese or chicken.  Very versatile.

This was an extremely easy recipe to make and everybody who tasted it thought that it was delish. I added sauteed mushrooms and, as one of the other reviewers suggested, caramelized the onions and added them in the last few minutes of cooking instead of throwing them in raw with the rice. I did have to cook the rice an extra five minutes in order to cook the rice through. I would also suggest checking up on the rice and mixing it halfway through both times of cooking. If the rice appears a little dry just add more water or wine. Sauteed mushrooms in wine and butter seasoned with salt and pepper are a great touch. *I kept the lid on though not very tightly just to cover up but still letting the steam from cooking come through* Overall, a delicious meal to prepare in little time!

Almost a 5 star, super good but not as good as the real stuff.  I will make this again many times just because it is so simple.  Also, making risotto in the summer time is painful at best, so this will definitely be good for summer (no standing over a hot stove for an hour)  One warning, DO NOT cut in half.  I did and it came out like a burned brick.

So, I have ashamedly used this website for years and never joined or reviewed anything...but i gotta admit, this recipe made me do it!  IT IS SO EASY!  AND tho you have to fiddle w/ it a little to make it as good as slaving over the stove, it is worth it!

My modifications: 1) Added mushrooms and leftover (cooked) chicken midway during the last 10 min cooking bit.  Also added more veggie broth at that time (about 1/2-3/4 more than called for in the recipe).  2) Changed the ORIGINAL liquid proportions, as well: 2 cups veggie broth and 1/4 cup RED (yes red) wine 3) increased the cooking time by 2-3 minutes to get the rice done (I think i have an underpowed nuker.)  4) Probably added a little extra cheese, too.  ENJOY!!!!

Well, count me among the amazed and impressed! I made mine with half butter & half olive oil, all chicken broth for the liquids, and I stirred in 2 tablespoons of prepared pesto sauce at the end. Also, I stirred it halfway through both cooking times to help release more starch and make it creamier. It was a bit oily, but that could be from the added oil in the pesto.

I am excited to have a risotto recipe that will be bearable to make in the steamy summer months, when slaving over a boiling pot for 30 minutes is not my favorite activity.

This was my first try at Risotto and I was a little intimidated by the stove-top version listed on the box. I was surprised and pleased at how well this turned out in the microwave. I would definitely make this again.

LOVE THIS!  I too hate to slave over the stove making risotto the traditional way, so I jumped on this recipe and it was DElicious!  I made some revisions and it came out yummy, my husband just devoured it!  I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, caramelized onions (already had) instead of raw onions, and added more parmesan than it asked for.  Most importantly though, I sauteed some crimini mushrooms with butter and wine and added it at the end with the wine.  Amazing!  I too kept the lid on, don't know if I was suppose to do that.  This is a GREAT recipe base!  I plan to make it again and again and again...

Perfect - I substituted chicken broth for the vegetable broth (didn't have any) this dish came out creamy & perfect. I can't wait to try it again using the vegetable broth.  I usually avoid making risotto because it's so time consuming but this recipe makes it soooooo easy.  I used this dish as a side with my Chicken Marsala by Lisa also found on this site, along with a salad and I had a perfect meal.  Keeper!!

Excellent recipe. Try not to use a plastic microwave container because it could impart a plastic taste to the risotto. I like to vary this recipe by adding different things on different occasions: pesto sauce one night, tomatoes and basil another night, mushrooms and saffron another night. Use whatever you have on hand. Also, if you cut the recipe in half, watch the times very carefully. It gets a bit trickier to cook it like that.

Not only is this easy, but it is sooo good! Even better than I have had in restaurants. I didn't have wine so I used chicken bouillon dissolved in water, also left out the garlic. Had some edamame and added that..wonderful! Had it for lunch and dinner. Can't wait to make this for guests.
Update!! Just made this for dinner with crab cakes..my hubby is not a big rice "fan". He had 2 helpings and made a "TV" dinner with the leftovers..that says a lot!

I was very skeptical about this recipe at first, as I didn't think the risotto would get soft enough in the micro.  But, I was proven wrong.  This is a great micro risotto recipe, and much better than standing over the stove stirring!  I used 1/2 cup more broth during cooking, and then stirred in some milk at the end when I added the cheese to make it creamier like traditional risotto.

The consistency and texture of the risotto turned out great! I may never make the conventional way again!  That being said, I only used 1/2 of a medium size onion and it was somewhat overpowering. If I had mushrooms to add I think it would have really harmonized with the onion and it would have been great.

Unbelievable! This is a superb, restaurant quality dish.  I followed alot of the reviewers recommendations~~>I added a shallots and mushrooms that I browned in butter at the point where I added the white wine.  I also used chicken stock (Emeril's brand that they sell in the supermarket).  The result was delicious, creamy.  I really couldn't stop eating this!  I can't wait to make it again.  One reviewer said she served this with chicken marsala so I think I will try that next time!  Thank you for a fabulous 10 STAR recipe!!!

I was very unsure about this one but thought I would give it a try anyway...so glad I did.  I used butter and it did turn out a little watery.  Will definately use again and tinker with options.  Thanks for the post.

I am going to give this recipe 5 stars for the idea and technique.  I have never made risotto before and have always wanted to.  I've had this recipe saved for a long time and purchased the arborrio rice to make it.  Well, tonight was my opportunity to try it out.  I followed the recipe closely, but substituted shallots for onions (like the flavor better) and used chicken instead of veggie broth.  This was very good, but I did use more liquid than the recipe called for.  My rice container suggested 3 cups of liquid for 1 cup of uncooked rice, and I think that's a lot closer to what you will really need to use.  I ran out of broth and had to add extra wine (didn't want to use water!) so mine ended up being pretty wine tasting (is that a word?).  The kids weren't crazy about that, but hubs and I both enjoyed it.  Would probably be great topped with some fresh chives or parsley at the end.  Next time will plan of having more broth available and just a bit of wine.  Loved the parm stirred in at the end.  Will totally try this again and it's nice enough for company!

This is unbelievably good & super easy.  I've made it 4 times now & it has turned out perfectly each time even though I've added different things every time I've made it.  The main change I made is to use low sodium chicken broth in place of vegetable broth & I've used either water or wine depending what I've had on hand.  Once I added a jar of olive tampanade, another time I added sauteed mushrooms & tonight I added sauteed mushrooms & spinach.  It is so versatile.  Dare to be creative & add what you like.  I would even make it for company - it is that good!

Wow - I love risotto but too lazy to make it the authentic way - this is a wonderful substitute and will go on my weekly rotation.  Went well with the Vienna Schnitzel receipe (from this site).  Thanks!

Great recipe. The only problem is that it took about 6 minutes longer, which required the addition of about 2 cups +/- of more broth (I used chicken broth). Also, I agree with a previous reviewer; it's best at the end, to check it every 2-3 minutes to make sure the amount of liquid is appropriate, and add the Parmesan cheese at the end! The flavor and texture was great, and much less work than traditional risotto.

Loved it. My first foray into Risottoland (although I've had it many times before in restaurants). Next time, I'd like to try the Gourmet Mushroom Risotto to see how these two recipes compare. But this one is a keeper because it's so quick and easy.

I have a dairy allergy, so I omitted the butter (used all olive oil).  I doubled the recipe.  This recipe is great because you can add whatever you want to pair it with any meal!  I'd highly recommend using fresh herbs, and limiting your additions to 3 - too many makes it too busy.  I've made this recipe twice, both times it was FANTASTIC. I did add 5 minutes to the cook time because of the extra volume, and stirred half way through both cook times.  The first time I added baby bella mushrooms (cut bite size) in with garlic and onion.  Then, I added baby spinach, artichoke hearts and roasted red peppers (drained, roughly chopped) during the mid-10 minute stir.    The second time I added oven roasted tomatoes (sliced romas, salt and pepper and olive oil, 350 degrees until soft), artichoke hearts (drained, quartered) and fresh thyme all at the end.

This is pretty good, though not quite as good as the traditional way of cooking risotto.  I also found I had to add 1/2 cup morel broth and add on 4 minutes of cooking after the suggested 10 minutes of nuking. I also added a splash of cream w/the cheese.

Yum, yum, yum!  I doubled the garlic, used half a large onion, and stirred in a few tablespoons of milk with the cheese to give it a little more creaminess.  Leftovers reheat well - just add a dash of milk and it's good to go.  Impressively good for the limited amount of work.

This was allright. I liked it, but my fiance didn't. I guess we are just spoiled being that we both make a MEAN homemade risotto :) For ease, you can't expect much (geez!).... I found Drasaid's directions to be spot on. I was a bit confused, though. I did not know what wattage microwave oven Drasaid used (mine was 850 watts) and also was unsure as to whether or not I was supposed to remove the lid during the last 10 minutes of cooking (i.e. when the wine was added), so I cooked for 5 minutes, checked, then microwaved for 5 minutes more as directed (you ARE supposed to remove the lid during the last step!). I ended up using slightly more than 1/4 cup of Parmesan (i.e. fancy shredded cheese - DON'T use the can stuff... yuck!) since I wanted to use up what I had on hand. I also added 1 cup of frozen (thawed) peas after everyting was mixed thoroughly. I could detect a slight hint of wine (my fiance did not). That is my only complaint. You should NEVER taste wine in your risotto; it should only be added to enhance. I also found Drasaid's risotto to be a bit creamy (almost gooey), but that can be easily fixed by adding more liquid or less cheese. Play around with this. Add veggies, meat, pinenuts - anything goes! This pairs especially well with Broiled Tilapia Parmesan by Phoebe (also on this site). Thanks for sharing such a quick, fun recipe Drasaid : )

OK 5 stars for how snappy and quick this is to make.  For me I wanted to carmalize my onions for a bit so I skipped cooking them in the microwave and added the butter into a skillet and cooked for 5 minutes or so with the garlic.  Heated the broth as stated (which I only had chicken on hand that had roasted veg seasoning flavor in it-tasted fab)..then added all the above to the microwave safe dish and tossed in my fav spices since a few reviewers mentioned the blandness (salt, pepper, paprika, dash sugar, and parsley)I think any recipe has room to add in your favorite spices..so that's what I did.  I also used pinot grigio for my wine.  Will make again and again.  Next time I will toss in my garden squashes and zucchinis after I saute them a bit.  Now that sounds good.
Don't pass this up..it good.

I don't know what I did wrong, but the rice was undercooked and all the liquid had boiled off. didn't care for this at all.  I followed the directions exactly as written.

Pretty tasty considering it was made in a microwave.  I used sparkling cider since that was all I had on hand.  Added more parmesan and salt to taste at the end.  Easy and more importantly, quick!

I made this tonight and it came out wonderful, as every other time I made it. This time I added some 10 grams of reconstituted porcini mushsrooms with the onions and garlic, and a big pinch of saffron to the stock (used beef instead of vegetarian.    This is a great recipe, so adaptable, and best of all, it allows me to have cocktails with my guests instead of sticking me in the kitchen with a wooden spoon to stir, stir stir!

Absolutely delicious. First time making risotto. Super easy and got rave reviews from husband and sister. Kids didn't like it, but what's new?!? Update 1/10--tried it again and used red wine and it was even better, and really pretty! Plus, the kids liked it this time!

This recipe is wonderful. It lends itself nicely to experimentation, always with great results. I've made this several times now exactly as written and completely changed up and its delicious every time. I've found that if you don't have arborio rice on hand, you can easily substitute any other long grain white rice. I prefer jasmine rice since I can buy it in bulk and its less expensive than arborio in my area. I also have found that I prefer to use half an onion, two garlic cloves, and whatever vegetables I can find in my fridge/garden. If the veggies need to be cooked, I stop the microwave with five minutes to go and toss in the chopped veggies. I also like to shred some cooked chicken and toss that in when I put in the cheese. 
Risotto purists may not be impressed with this recipe because it's not exactly like traditional risotto. But its pretty darn close, and easier to make when you're pressed for time.

I followed the recipe to a "T", except used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. It came out tasting great with a PERFECT texture. Next time I will use less onion (I'm not a huge onion fan) and add mushrooms. This was soooo much easier then standing over the stove forever.

I wanted to make this as-in and give it a fair rating, because I recently had risotto for the first time. It was at a cooking demonstration given by professional chefs and it was amazing. I bought the Arborio rice and had plans to make it today. However things didn't go as planned so I need a quick cooking method. I thought it was very good. Not as soft and creamy as I remember the other stuff but it had a bite to it that I liked.

Really easy and tasty. I used Basmati rice, and I drained a tin of mushrooms and threw them in with the wine.  Made this a couple of times now, and it's disappeared quickly.

This is so easy and so good!  We make this all the time for ourselves, and when we have company and it's always a hit.  Easy to make while you're cooking the other dinner components.  We have made this ahead and just reheated it quickly before serving, still good!

Super easy way to make risotto!   I loved that it didn't require constant attention.   I used chicken broth instead.  It was a little pasty, and the wine flavor was a little too much for me, but overall pretty good.

I added a can of mushrooms and used apple cider instead of wine. I didn't have an onion so I used dried onions. I cooked up the garlic, butter, and onion on a skillet instead of a separate microwavable bowl (same number of dishes and I could heat up the broth while heating up the other stuff) Quick, easy, and delicious! I'll make this again soon!

This did not go as expected. In fairness I did not have the white wine so I substituted Marsala and red wine. Even so the rice was thicker and not as creamy as risotto that I have made in the past.

Amazing!  I have to admit I have never made risotto the "old fashioned" way, but have used several rice cooker versions.  This is much more easy and is totally delicious.  The only change I made was to use chicken broth in place of both veggie broth and wine.  I also added mushrooms and shredded zucchini.  The risotto was flavorful and creamy.  Will definitely experiment with other add-ins and this is my new favorite recipe!

Wow, easy and good.  Only changes-sauteed onions and garlic first, and added can of mushrooms, with juice, and enough wine to make 3/4 C liquid, put in about 1/4 c cream when cooking was finished.  Came out great!

This was o.k. but needs to be adjusted.  First off, the risotto was not cooked enough with the times given and there was not near enough liquid to soak in.  I will try this again but have to adjust with more liquid (I didn't have time when made the first time).  I have to say the old fashioned, more difficult way definitely gets better results!  This was not creamy at all.

Wow!  Thanks for another recipe we love that is simple to make too.  I've made this twice in the last week.  Only had White Zin the first time, much better the second time with Chardonnay.  Also used chicken broth both times as my grocery is always out of vegetable broth.

I'm sorry, but we didn't like this recipe.  I have a delicious risotto receipe made with Vidalia onions and feta cheese stirred in at the end that I recreated using this recipe and the microwave.  I basically followed the recipe except used broth instead of the wine because the kids were going to eat it and I wasn't sure how much of the alcohol would cook off in the microwave.  Anyway, even with extra stirring, this risotto wasn't half as creamy as doing it on the stovetop.  My family didn't enjoy it much and the leftovers ended up getting thrown away.  We won't be making it in the microwave again.  Oh well, it was worth a try.

I have never been able to get risotto right on the stove...okay I am not that good a cook I guess...this, however worked great.  The only problem I had was step 4 - It did not say to replace the cover after adding the wine, so I assumed that since the liquid was supposed to "boil off," I should leave the lid off.  I think I lost too much liquid that way.  I even stopped the cooking at 9 minutes.  Next time I will replace the lid for the last 10 minutes and see what happens.  

I can't wait to try some alternative liquids, as I am not all that crazy about wine - got me again...I am completely unrefined. The weird thing is that my wife, who hates the very thought of wine loved this recipe.  Go figure.

Excellent dish!  I used 2 garlic cloves, chicken broth, and added mushrooms.  I caramelized the onions instead of cooking them in the microwave.  I added them and my sauteed mushrooms in the last minute of cooking.  This got rave reviews from my husband.  Next time I might try other veggies too.

Fantastic! It is true, I do put off making risotto most times because it is somewhat time consuming. This was perfect! I sauteed boneless chicken breasts and made a Tomato Rosemary Sauce from the back of the College Inn Chicken Broth can to go with the chicken, then made this risotto recipe and steamed green beans. DH loved it and so did I. I followed the recipe exactly. It was perfect. Thanks for another great recipe. I will definitely make risotto more often and use this recipe to do so. Can't wait for lunch leftovers!

I was skeptical that a microwaved risotto could actually come out as creamy and delicious as the slow-cooked version, but it was my sister's birthday, she requested that I bring risotto and I did not have time to make one of the more cumbersome recipes. To complicate matters, I had to scale it up to serve 12. 

It came out great!!! Everyone loved it. My sister works in a high-end Italian restaurant and she liked this better than what they serve.

A great way to use leftover Arborio rice (don't substitute)!  I used more garlic instead of onion, and water instead of white wine, and this still came out fantastic.  The only thing I may change next time is to include some slivered almonds, to enhance the earthy flavors of the rice and vegetable broth, and to add a nice crunch.  This went very well with Broiled Tilapia Parmesan from this ite.

This was great! I've never made a risotto, and this seemed like a super-easy way to start. I didn't have vegetable or chicken broth, so I open up a can of chicken/wild rice soup and used the liquid. It worked very well, then when it was done I added some mushrooms sauteed in wine, olive oil, and the remainder of the soup. Delicious!

Excellent!  Creamy and tasty!  I added sauteed (done in garlic, butter and white wine) mushrooms at the end!  If you like risotto this recipe is for you!

I rarely have time to make Risotto- all that stirring!  This microwave version isn't quite as good as stove top but it was better than I expected.  I used chicken broth for all the liquid and added extra parmesan to make it extra creamy.  Will use this recipe from now on!

I, too, was a skeptic of risotto in the microwave, but I am a believer now! I added pesto, chicken and fresh mushrooms at the end of cooking, and this risotto came out fantastic! It was so delicious, my husband had three bowls! I will definitely be making this risotto again, and often! Thank you!

I thought this was an excellent way to prepare risotto.  I did have to make some small changes to the recipe.  I lengthened the cooking time by about 6 minutes in order to cook the rice properly and added more wine.  Before I made those changes, the rice was still hard and all the liquid had absorbed quickly so there was no creaminess.  As a personal preference, I added some chopped parsley for color and some sauteed sliced mushrooms.  In the end, I had a delicious risotto that my whole family loved, and I will definitely be making this again.

This recipe is a great basis for your creativity!  I've made it twice, adding different vegtables each time.  Try a colorful selection of corn, broccoli, peas and/or tomatoes. One note: having a rather anemic microwave, I had to add some cooking time.

This was creamy and delicious.  I sauteed the onion and garlic with a pint of mushrooms, then added the vegetable broth to that, then added the rice and moved it all to the casserole dish.  Instead of 3/4 cup of wine, I used 1/2 cup wine and 1/2 cup heavy cream to make it nice and creamy.  My mom couldn't believe I made it in the microwave and wanted the recipe.  Score! Thank you, Drasaid!

Have tried this recipe several times.  Because I do not have a tight fitting cover I have adjusted some amounts and cooking time.  I use 2 cups of veggie broth and microwave for 10 minutes. Keep the wine about the same and add a couple of minutes to the cooking time.  Add the cheese and add 1/4 to 1/2 cup of heavy cream. Think the cream makes this dish almost as good as the one that takes stirring and stirring.
Drasaid, thank you for giving your recipe.

I think I could have cooked the rice for a little bit longer and put a little less wine in and add mushrooms and it would be better but for microwave risotto it was fantastic!

I have been on Allrecipes for years.  This is one of the best recipes I have tried.  I am not a regular rice eater and have never tried risotto.  But I had some arborio rice in my cupboard to try sometime because I listen to Food Network alot and they make nice looking dishes with it.  I was so surprised by how good this was.  I also tried the Quick Chicken Piccata on this site with it.  This is one of the best meals I have had in a long time, and I am always cooking and trying out new recipes.  If you haven't tried this do it!

I love onions and this was too overpowering with the onion flavor.  I would sauté the onion first next time I make this.  Other than that it was great.

I love this recipe! Even when I'm tired and don't feel like cooking I can usually muster up the energy to throw this together. To make it extra easy I use dried minced onion, often add garlic, and apple juice instead of wine.

This is just as good as making it over the stovetop!  I did need additional broth (about 1/2 cup), which I just heated in the microwave before adding.

This recipe sure had the "WOW" factor at a pot luck tonight! Friends were very impressed how well my first Risotto turned out. Then I told them it took less than 30 minutes to do in the microwave and they just couldn't believe it. I followed the recipe just about to the letter. Main difference, I precooked the onions and garlic for about 5-6 minutes. Then followed the recipe. I used chicken broth to for the little extra flavor. About 2 minute before the timer went off, I opened the lid to check the rice, felt it could be a bit moister, so I dumped the other 1/4 to 1/3 cup of left over chicken stock in and went about 3 more minutes. I think next time, I'll add some heavy cream to see what that does for the overall texture. All in all, this is a great keeper!

I have to say... I was so scared to try this but I really wanted some Risotto and having a bad arm, the traditional way is not something I can do without hurting myself... So, I tried it!!! OMG!!! My family and I were shocked at how good it is!! I will be making this often... I didn't have to really modify anything since I only wanted a basic Risotto (my 13 yo won't eat a bunch of things)... the only thing I did a little different was to use extra broth in place of wine, just a 'splash' of cream at the end, and add more cheese (only cuz my family are cheese freaks. AWESOME.... THANK YOU!!!

Easy.  Tastes great.  I don't normally rate recipes that I have changed, but I needed to this time.  Instead of Vegetable broth I used chicken broth. I cooked chicken and mushrooms in butter and garlic, put peas in to add colour and added it with double the amount of cheese. My husband, that doesn't like chicken, loved it.

I have never made or eaten risotto, so I have nothing to compare this to. Either way, I thought the texture and appearance turned out well. However, the predominant taste, to me, was onions and wine. When I looked at the recipe I thought there was quite a bit of both, but wanted to follow the recipe exactly being it was my first time making it. I think it would be better with less than half the onion and to subtitute some of the wine for more broth. I did cover it each time, when microwaving, so maybe the wine could not evaporate off enough. I don't know. I hate to waste food, but I don't know how to fix it, so it will more likely get tossed. The small box of risotto was very expensive to.

Excellent! This is a super easy recipe :) Perfect for last minute side dishes but tasty enough to serve to company. Highly recommend adding a splash of cream at the end as mentioned by other reviewers. I've used different types of broth (chicken, veggie, mushroom, etc.) and it's always a hit. Thank you so much Drasaid!!

Very good!  Never had risotto before so don't really know what to compare it to.  :)
We used Jasmine rice so it took about 5 minutes longer in the microwave and maybe another cup of water before the rice was soft.
We ended up forgetting to add the Parmesan cheese until we were all eating it.  So we just sprinkled some on our plates.  Really, it tasted better with the cheese, but maybe it would have tasted good mixed up correctly like the recipe called.  Very good and will make again!

My husband and I LOVE risotto and I was so excited to try this microwave version.  We always make our risotto with chicken broth so I used it instead of vegetable broth.  And we didn't have any onions or garlic so I just used garlic powder.  I also followed other reviewers' advice and stirred halfway through the heating time.  I was really pleased with how it turned out!  It was still creamy and hard to tell the difference from the old fashioned stovetop risotto.  Definitely a keeper! Thanks!!

This was really good.  After reading the other reviews, I cooked the onion garlic and butter in a small saute pan along with 1/2 c chopped sun dried tomatoes then followed the recipe.  It was really good and timed perfectly.  When I added the grated cheese I also added a little light cream at the end and it was wonderful

I love this risotto recipe because it is so easy and still tastes very good!  I don't have to stand by a pot stirring and stirring; instead I can make this while I am actually cooking other things too.

I can't believe how good this is for being microwaved!  Added frozen peas to the mix when I added the wine (actually used apple juice b/c I didn't have a cheap white available).  Awesome!!

This was excellent! So flavorful! I used pinot. The only thing I did differently was saute the garlic and onions with the butter in a pan instead of putting it in the microwave. I was afraid the garlic would burn because I made that mistake before! My son gave it 6 out of 5 stars. Would definitely make again! :)

Earns its five starts due to the fact that it cooks in the microwave, only about 4 stars for taste. I eliminate the onions, due to a picky eater in the house, and decrease butter by a tablespoon. Have substituted chicken broth for both the wine and veg. broth in the past. I add a dash of cream at the end of cooking. Great for a quick side dish! I do have to cook the butter less in micro to keep from burning.

I loved this recipe.  I added about a teaspoon of lemon juice, used chicken stock, and  a bit more cheese, probably double.  It was definitely a little chewy but I liked it that way.  This one is a keeper.

Note: If you are thinking of trying this with brown rice, let me save you the time. It doesn't work. I know brown rice takes more time but after more than 45 minutes I still couldn't get this to resemble risotto. I was anxious to try this with a brown rice to boost the nutrition but it came out more like a pilaf.  Edible, but not risotto.

Incredibly easy, and might even taste better when reheated the next day for lunch.  Grape tomatoes make a nice addition.

I had a microwave risotto recipe from years ago that I couldnt find so I kind of merged the 2, based on what I could remember from the first.  The results were very good (which leads me to believe that this recipe is very forgiving...this is why I dont bake!)  I used 1/2 butter 1/2 olive oil, its healthier.  I melted the butter then added the onions and cooked them for 1 minute.  I then added some mushrooms and garlic and cooked for a minute more.  Then added rice , stirred and cooked for 2 mins,then I did the wine (like you would with classic risotto).  I never covered the dish and used 2 1/2 cups of chicken broth in stead of the 1 1/2 veg.  Probably nuked it with broth for about 20-30 minutes?  Was very yummy!  Will make again!

This recipe was much easier than a traditional risotto.  I did make some minor improvements to suit our tastes.  I added more broth and cooked slightly longer than suggested bc we like the rice softer. I also stirred in a lrg splash of cream to the finished product to make it creamier.  I will make this againa and again and again.

I love risotto, but don't always have the time to prepare it the authentic way...I was a little sceptical using the microwave because I am not a fan of preparing food in it, but let me tell you, I was seriously impressed!  I turned out wonderful!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I can't believe I hadn't rated this before.... we have made it so often !   I have not made traditional risotto before, but after trying this, I don't think I need to....the flavor of this is so good and it always comes out just right.   We add sauteed mushrooms and freshly grated pecorino romano cheese to it, yum !!!   Thank you for sharing !

Well, who would have expected that? It's not quite so creamy as the old-fashioned loooooong cooked risotto, but it really does capture the essence of it. Big hit in our family, though I have to say, I used bouillion instead of broth, and it was too salty. I wouldn't do that again.

Nothing beats real "stirred" risotto, but this was a fairly good substitute.  I liked the fact that I could do other things while it was cooking.  It just didn't have that same creaminess that risotto should have.  I added a small can of mushrooms (with the water) and subsituted chicken broth for the veggie.  Thanks for the recipe!

honestly I think that the Risotto that you stir and stir on the stove is a little better, but only when you have perfected the heat and stirring combo. This is almost as good and for the next to no attention that it needs, five solid stars.

I've had this in my recipe box for 2 years!! I finally tried it for a lunch with some leftover arborio in the cupboard. I didn't have wine, so I just used extra broth.  I followed the microwaving directions exactly and came out with a FANTASTIC risotto.  I must say I was skeptical, but it was very good.  The fresh parmesan is absolutely necessary....don't use any of that fake shake stuff.  I'm going to try it again with some asparagus, mushrooms and shrimp and make a lenten dinner out of it.  YUM!

I have made this twice now and really like it a lot.  My husband didn't like it the first time so I made a few changes and he really likes it now.  I used 2 1/4 c. of broth and 2-3 Tbsp of wine - just enough to taste.  I also cook it for a lot longer than the recipe states.  I followed the directions the first time and it was just too hard still, so I go about 10 more minutes in the microwave.  This recipe has great flavor, and the best part is that you don't have to stand in front of the stove stirring!

Tried this recipe for DH,mom, and kids...I personally loved it, but everyone else was not too crazy about the flavour the wine gave to the dish...I live with many fussy people...will make again and cut down on the wine.

A very easy and yummy recipe, though I have not tried it in its original form, only with my own tweaking. It is delicious with a bit of tomato sauce added in the last few minutes of cooking, as well as with mushrooms, sliced carrots, and extra garlic, plus a bit more parmesan than prescribed. All in all, a great starting point for creating your own delicious risotto! 
Thanks!
Note: I have also prepared this using regular long grain converted rice- it works just fine, though Arborio is definitely much creamier!

This is a fabulous, quick and easy base. Just make sure you add your favorite ingredients, because as is, it is just plain risotto, without all the special ingredients that give it the flavors you are used to.

This is my first review but I just HAD to take the time to review this.  It was to die for.  Exactly like the risotto from my favorite local 5-star restaurant and so easy.  I caramelized the onions first and added a little extra butter and salt at the end.  A definite keeper.

After using this site for weeks, I finally joined just so I could review this recipe. Wonderful. Him indoors loves risotto but, as I work full time, I rarely had time to make it - until now. Thanks so much for sharing it - and thanks for curing the earache he was giving me!

I thought this recipe was awesome!  The only thing I added was some sauteed mushrooms and an extra clove of garlic.  It was super easy to make and exceeded my expectations!

Having made the real thing with home made stock and all the time I can say that this is a great everyday alternative. The texture was compirable and it took very little time - even my kids could make this!

I was pleasantly surprised by this.  I was a little skeptical of risotto made in the microwave, but it was actually really good.  I used an entire small onion and about 3 cloves of garlic.  I also used chicken broth instead of veggie broth.  My husband and I both really enjoyed this.  I plan on making it often.  The ingredients are things that I usually have around the house.  It would be great with some other ingredients tossed in there too.  It's definitely a good basic recipe, and it's incredibly simple to make.  Yum!

This turned out great!  I added sauteed mushrooms and more onion along with some worcestshire sauce at the end.  We loved it and will make it again!  Next time I'll use all broth instead of the wine though, we didn't like the taste as much-- but it could have been the kind of wine that I used.

I wouldn't make it again. It wasn't  the right texture and the onion and parm  overwhelmed the flavor of the rice.

I used a lower proportion of wine, and ended up adding a bit more liquid and a couple more minutes.  I used someone's suggestion of adding a bit of cream to finish.  A nice and easy side dish with fish

My girls really enjoyed this and I will definitely make it again.  I didn't have Arborio rice so I used Jasmine rice and it turned out really well.  I read that Jasmine rice doesn't absorb as much as Arborio so I added more and then ended up adding more stock.  I'm not sure the exact ratio I ended up with but it turned out great and it was eaten up very quickly.  I will try it with Arborio rice next and see what the difference is.

I followed the recipe to the letter, and produced a perfectly cooked, utterly delicious risotto! Am currently living without an oven and stove while I wait for mine to be repaired, and what a pleasant surprise that we can still enjoy one of our favorite meals! Many thanks for this lovely recipe . . . I will probably continue making this even once I have a functioning stove again!

I did not have parmesan cheese, so I used a few ounces of gouda.  It was creamy and tasty!  I could not tell the difference between this microwave texture and the stovetop versions I have made before.

Super easy compared to the alternative, but the flavor for this recipe isn't anything special. The consistency was right though.

Followed recipe exactly... seemed like endless microwaving, the flavor was odd.  Not a fan. The texture of the rice was nice.  I would try again but add a ton of extras like veggies and some flavor.  But I wanted to try the recipe first.

Made this for first time today (10-27-12).  Sauteed onion, garlic (2 large cloves) and 8oz thinly sliced mushroom caps in butter.  Heated the broth (I used chicken because I had an open container), added the vegetables and rice to the broth and followed the directions from that point on, adding the wine and cheese.  It was easy (without all the incessant stirring) and my husband and I thought it was delicious.  It was a side to broiled teriyaki salmon and Brussel sprouts.  EXCELLENT!

This recipe is FABULOUS!  I typically stir halfway through each cooking time and add a little more liquid, but it's so easy to be versatile with this!  My family loves it, and it's a great alternative to tradtional risotto, with very similar results!

Oh my goodness.  This is a comfort food dish.  I have only had risotto one other time, and I made it from a recipe that required the stirring over the stove method.  This was so much better - admittedly, I have never had "real" risotto.  I followed the advice of others and sauteed my veggies, and added at the end.  I served this with a "raw" kale salad, and it was great.  I also found it to be very "forgiving" in that frequent checking did not destroy the outcome.

This was surprisingly good for risotto made in the microwave. It was amazingly helpful for those nights when both the four year old and the two year old are NOT letting me stir for 20 minutes straight at the stove. I added spinach, chicken, and a little extra parmesan. The only reason I didn't rate it five stars was that I tried the suggestion of apple juice instead of wine (for the kids) and while they really enjoyed it, my husband and I found it a bit too sweet and tangy. Overall, thanks for a great shortcut!

My 10 month old and I absolutely loved this.  I didn't have all the ingredients so I substituted the vegetable broth for beef broth, the garlic clove for garlic powder and white wine for ginger ale and it was great. The convenience of doing it in the microwave is a big plus

I thought this came out great.  I took no time at all (although I did not cook it in a casserole dish that had a lid, so I used a plate and it take a little longer).  It was delicious...thank you!!

This was my first successful risotto.  It was so easy compared to the stovetop method that I think I'll start making it on a regular basis.  Mine was a little dry at the end, so I added some milk.  It made it nice and creamy.  I also added a pinch each of salt, pepper, and Spanish saffron and served it with steamed broccoli and some marinated artichokes.  Yum.

Tastes awesome, it's very similar to traditional risotto, I recommend to add a dash of cream at the end, for making it even better

Not only was this easy, but so delicious! I did substitute more chicken broth for the wine since we are all out. It worked very well and received rave reviews from my family :-) Thanks!

I'm the only one in my family of 4 who likes risotto, so I pull this one out when I want to treat myself.  It cooks up quick & easily...and I get to "slurge" & have a glass of wine while waiting for it to cook up.  I keep saying next time I'll add something (shrimp? peas? mushrooms?) to it, but I keep making the original recipe!  A definite keeper!

i have had this in my recipe box for quite a while and am really glad i finally made this. i followed the suggestions of the reviewers and stirred halfway through all of the cooking times. i have a 1000 watt microwave and i felt mine needed a total of 10 more mins and more chix broth after. i cant wait to make this again for the hubs because he loved it

An excellent substitute for the stove. I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe, except maybe to double it. The leftovers are just as good. Thanks for a great recipe!

Very tasty, very quick and very easy.  I stirred in a bit of half-and-half at the end and it was creamy and delicious!  My two-year-old is currently scarfing down seconds, which tells you everything right there.  Yum!

It was easy and yummy! It's one of those recipes that will be different everytime I make it because I'll change it up everytime.  I used ck broth and a small can of V8 juice for the liquids and used some frozen veggies.  I didn't have any cream like one reviewer recommended, so I stirred in milk after I added the cheeses. I will definately be making this often!

delicious and easy are the two most important factors for me and this recipe has both of them. easy to change the recipe a little every time for what you feel like whether it's cheesier or some sun-dried tomatoes or vegetables. great recipe. Try it!

This was really good.  I cooked mine for quite a bit longer than the recipe called for, probably about 30 minutes from the point where you add the broth. (the rice was still uncooked in the center after the cooking times specified in the recipe).  I continued to stir in more stock every 3-6 minutes until the rice was no longer hard in the middle.  I also left the lid on because I didn't think that you want any liquid to boil off in a risotto, (don't you want it to absorb into the rice, making it more creamy?)  I used chicken stock and added sundried tomatoes at the end and it turned out great.  Can't wait to try this again with some different variations!

Love it. So easy. I took the other reviewers advice and added a little more cheese and some heavy cream. Works well with whatever veggies you have on hand.

This recipe was easy but following the recipe gives less than desirable results. I followed others' suggestions and added the carmelized onions and garlic half way through the cooking. I had to cook this another 4 minutes to get it soft enough, and I would have cooked it another 2 or 3 with additional liquid if I had the time. Extra cheese for us too!

Yep, this really does work.  I am thrilled with the fact that I don't have to stand over a stove stirring for 30 minutes.  I sauteed my onions and garlic separately and used chicken broth entirely.  I did add the onions an garlic at the start with the rice.  I kept the lid on for the last 10 minutes, stirred at 5 minutes and checked it with 2 minutes left on the timer and it was done. I stirred in the parm and grubbed.  Awesome.

This was AWESOME!  Cooked perfectly with no slaving over the stove!  I even forgot to add the parmesan at the end, and it was still a wonderful risotto!  I'm making it again and adding the cheese this time.  I would imagine it only gets better with cheese!

I really liked this!  Next time I might increase the amount of stock (I used chicken) and decrease the amount of wine slightly.  I used long-grain rice, and needed to cook it about 3 minutes longer.  Could have been a bit creamier, but overall it was very tasty and I'll definitely make it again!

Sooo easy and quite tasty.  I love risotto, but struggle with more complicated recipes.  While this isn't quite the same as those fancy shmancy risottos, it's good enough for me!  Love it!

Took longer to cook when I tripled the recipe.  Used Maggi chicken/tomato bullion cubes to augment the broth to the correct amount.  Also used lemonade to augment the wine I had.

Like everyone has said, this isn't real risotto. But whatever it is, it's delicious! The only thing I added to the recipe was salt & pepper and a bit of heavy cream at the end like another reviewer suggested. This recipe is super easy and very flavorful. I will definitely be making it again.

My whole family loved this recipe!  Everyone went back for seconds!  I didn't have the white wine, so I just added more broth and water.  I also added thinly sliced portabella mushrooms. This is already a family favorite!

I have to say, I was pretty surprised at how well this risotto came out! I love risotto and usually do the long routine of stirring and adding liquid...what a nice switch for a night where I didn't have the energy! I followed another review and added a dash of fat free half & half at the end, yummy. I also added sliced baby portabella mushrooms with the onions/garlic. The timing for the microwave was perfect.

Very easy and very good. I added some lemon pepper and some Mrs. Dash just to enhance the flavor. I also omitted the wine (I was out) and added a bit of brown rice since I was about four Tbl's short of a full cup which then required a bit more liquid and a little longer cooking time but the kids raved about this rice. A keeper in my book!

This was too easy! Nice recipe. I needed something that I could make with whatever I had in my pantry. I used red wine because I was out of white.  It came out sooooo tasty. Of course, it's not the same as the real deal, but it's great for everyday dinners.  Thanks!

I know what you're thinking, no way this recipe works.  I thought the same thing.  OK, it's not perfect risotto, but it's  close and so wonderfully simple.  Add this to your list.

Thank the stars above for this amazing and quick risotto!!  I used apple juice instead of the wine and it was fabulous!  It does leave a strong taste so if you're not too keen on the AJ or wine, reduce the amount a little.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! I will definitely make again. I love how quick and easy this recipe is without compromising on taste. I added a handful of finely diced bacon, to the garlic, onion and butter mixture. I also used chicken stock as I didn't have any vegetable stock or white wine on hand. I have made it twice now and it has been a hit both times even my fussy two year old loves it!

Easy but a little bland.  I added sauted exotic mushrooms at the end.  It did take a little longer to cook but that may have been because I had 12 servings. I will make again when I want risotto but dont have the time for the real thing.

I eat this all the time - with a few tweaks. I use regular rice since it's much cheaper, chicken broth since I always have it on hand (also - there's no need for two bowls - just heat up the broth with the onions, and about a tablespoon or less of butter to cut back on the fat. If it's watery - as others have mentioned - just keep cooking it until you get "pits" on the top. (I usually cook it for 11 minutes after adding the wine.) And don't forget salt!

This is soooo good. I served it with marinated meatballs from the crock pot and a fresh green salad. I added a bit extra white wine and extra parmesan.

This is very good and easy.  I've made this before the old fashioned way and you can't tell the difference.  Made it with both red and white wine and it's great both ways!

I changed the recipe just a little bit. I made it with only vegetable broth and no wine(just a tiny dash of apple cider vinager). I also subtracted maybe 1/4 of a cup of liquid. I cooked it for 10 minutes longer ,and it came out perfect!

Wow!!! What a surprise! I've been making risotto for years and it is always time consuming, (which I don't mind.) and hit or miss with the consistency. This recipe was great. I added a little more garlic because we love it and I added carmelized onions when it finished cooking. When I removed the cover after the last 10 min, I thought it was too watery. But, when I added the cheese and let it sit with the lid on it was perfect. My husband loved it. I didn't tell him it was from the microwave, he's a purest. I can not wait to try it with other additions and double the amount. For time and taste, it gets my first 5 stars. Thank You!!!

This was delicious.  I just used water in place of wine, chicken broth instead of the vegetable broth and added 2 extra cloves of garlic. I thought was a very easy side dish.  Better than standing over the stove for 30 min. straight like other risottos.
It was a little too watery after the cooking times allowed, so I microwaved it for a minute more then stirred an extra 1/4 cup of parmesean cheese in to thicken it up.  It worked well.  Nice recipe.  Thanks.

This recipe is a time saver and tastes just like the longer version. I will try adding sun dried tomatoes, saffron, mushrooms and the like in future versions to see how it measures up when not the basic version.

This is excellent!  I probably won't make regular stove-top risotto again.  The only change I made in the basic recipe was to cook it an extra 3 minutes uncovered - it needed slightly more time at 8,000' altitude to reach al dente.

Although the actual flavour of this recipe wasn't really to my taste (I'd have given 3 stars for taste), the texture of the risotto was great and so I'll be adapting other risotto recipes to the quick microwave method.  Thanks Drasaid for a great timesaver.

OK so it isn't as good as the risotto you spend 45 minutes stirring on the stove.  But for the amount of effort, it really is excellent.  For the record, I forgot to heat the chicken broth once, but I added extra liquid and cooked it longer, and it turned out fine.

I was very skeptical when I saw this recipe.  But it really surprised me - the flavor was really good and the rice actually cooked up well (I assumed it would be really crunchy).  However, this didn't turn out as creamy as old fashioned risotto.  I left the lid on for the last 10 minutes - not sure if that made a difference.  The recipe didn't specify what to do. It is definitely a good way to easily make risotto, just don't expect it to taste exactly like it does with the regular method.
