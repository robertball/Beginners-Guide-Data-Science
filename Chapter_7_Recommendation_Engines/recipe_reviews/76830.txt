I was craving a thai style peanut sauce for chicken and found this recipe. I had almost everything on hand except white wine vinegar (I subbed a 1/4 cup marsala wine)and soy sauce (subbed what was left of a bottle of worschestire & filled the rest of the 1/4 cup with yoshida's sauce.) I also added a lot more red pepper flakes and a few dashes of hot sauce. I only made 4 chicken breasts, and baked it in the oven, so it was more of a thick sauce than a marinade, but it was delicious and filling with fried rice. Would be excellent with a veggie side dish as well. To quote my husband, it was "glorious!"

I wanted a sauce on the chicken and I love peanut sauce so I made this dish but cooked it differently.  I found that the recipe had quite a lot of garlic in it and it tasted very strong.  I had to add 3/4 cup of water to it because it was like a paste.  I also added some oyster sauce for sweetness and a little more soy sauce.  I broiled the chicken, after which I only used 1/4 of the sauce to marinate it in.  I then simmered the remainder of the sauce and poured it over the cooked chicken.  It is great with rice.

I bought it from the Smuckers store in Orville, Ohio where it was on the natural peanut butter jar. It sounded bazaar but being an excessive peanut butter eater I tried it. It was the best chicken I have ever had! I would suggest eating it with a non-lettece salad with ginger dressing. The only think I will do differently next time is saving some sauce for the cooked chicken as an extra dipping sauce. (Or if you care double the sauce!) Great party idea and fairly easy to assemble.

My picky son loves this recipe and asks for it often.  I have made it several times.   It seems to work best when the grill is not too hot.

This peanut-garlic-ginger sauce goes well with chicken.  I also had to thin the sauce/marinade.
Reserved 1/2 of it to use as a dipping sauce.  The chicken really stuck to the grill.  Be sure to spray the grill before cooking/

This was ok but I must have done something wrong. The marinade didn't really "stick" to the chicken while grilling so it didn't have a lot of flavor even though I marinated it for quite awhile. It seems it might be better to bake it. The chicken was moist though.

made exactly as the recipe states (including adding about 3/4 cup of water to thin it out) and it came out perfectly-- i only had skippy peanut butter but i don't think that matters.  next time i may try it with crunchy peanut butter for an added crunch but perfect as written.

This recipe was very flavorful. I baked it instead of grilling it and I didn't use as much garlic. It was a little too salty for my taste but overall it was very good.

The chicken was tender and had a good flavor. However, I feel the taste could have been taken up a notch. I'm not really sure how to jazz it up a little bit more.

I made this according to the recipe and while it was good, I felt it wasn't great (my fiance loved it however).  The sauce tasted a bit chalky, maybe that's typical of a peanut butter sauce?  I agree with other reviewers in the fact that the sauce doesn't stay well on the chicken.  You must reserve some for dipping.

The flavor of this marinade surprised me!  I expected the strongest flavor would be peanut butter, but the sourness of the lemon juice and the ginger really stood out.  However, I didn't taste much of the garlic or the pepper flakes.  I followed this recipe exactly.  I did end up adding 3/4 cups water which watered it down just enough.  Spraying the grill beforehand really did help with the sticking issue too.  The flavor of the chicken by itself was good but not very strong.  However, using the additional marinade as a dip added that extra powerful flavor.  I can't say it's the best dish I've ever made, but I did enjoy it.

I really liked this and it was super easy.  I only used half the amount of pepper flakes and it still had a bit of spiciness. I think it would have been too spicy for my family if I included the whole teaspoon. I will definitely make again.

We marinated the chicken in this peanut sauce, but then baked it instead of grilling because of reviews that suggested baking gives it more flavor.  It did have a lot of flavor, but my family found it mediocre tasting.  The texture from the peanut butter bothered all of us.  I'm going to have to move on to find another recipe close to a satay.
