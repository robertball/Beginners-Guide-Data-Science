Very yummy :) More like a beef/brocolli stroganoff versus traditional beef and brocolli. I used 1 large clove of fresh garlic in place of garlic powder. I also used low fat cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of brocolli. I also added 1/2 cup sliced mushrooms when sauteeing onions and garlic. Husband and 3 year old loved it!

Pretty good. Flavor was good, but I would choose a more tender cut of meat.

This was okay.  I liked it for its simplicity but it definitely wasn't a traditional beef & broccoli taste.  I'd make some changes next time...

This is a good recipe. I do have to say the sauce is a little thick but it still gets eaten in my family. I do steam the broccoli while I cook the meat to save some time since i don't add onions to my meal. Then I kust throw everything in the pan until heated through. I serve this ontop of a bed of rice and add a egg roll with the meal. Pretty good stuff.

made this when at the last minute i realized that the "steak" i'd taken out of the freezer for dinner was actually stir-fry beef.  OOPS! needless to say my hubby and kids did enjoy this meal.  i didn't have bream of broccoli so i used cream of celery.  i also cut the soy sauce in half, because my kids are super picky when it comes to anything that tastes remotely "chinese".  i don't eat red meat but it smelled good :)  i probably wouldn't make something like this again, as i don't tend to use canned soup in my cooking, but it was good in a pinch - and i keep the soups on hand just for times like this!

Not too bad.  I had to add more stuff to up the asian flavor.  I used one small shallot instead of the onion.  I also used about a third of a cup of soy sauce, three cloves of fresh garlic, one tablespoon of oyster sauce and some ginger paste.  I served it over white rice.

This, of course, isn't the traditional beef and broccoli I might order in a Chinese restaurant, but my husband enjoyed it, and that's what counts for me.  It does have good flavor, but I might add a tad more soy sauce.

This was great! Kids ate it and the husband did too.  Easiest and best Beef and Broccoli ever!  It is truly fool proof.

This was like a homemade hamburger helper for me. Definitely quick when you need dinner in a hurry. I used ground beef. I also addded a can of cream of chicken(should be just cream of....because there was no chicken in the can..lol) and an extra 1/3 cup of water along with the cream of broccoli just to make it plentiful. Be sure to season your ground beef or beef. It was very tasty and had a nice flavor. Sauce is very thick, so not your average beef & broccoli but definitely a spin. I will make it again. Very Hearty!

This recipe is a staple in our house!! My kids love it!  I have substituted chicken instead of beef. Also, made my own creamy base. Always served ver rice. Very good!

This was good. I used cream of asparagus because I did not have broccoli and it really didn't make much of a difference in flavor. This really needs salt and pepper though. In all, it was very good for a quick meal.

Good dinner, the cut of beef was a little tough for the overall meal (I even sliced it thinly and against the grain) but I still quite enjoyed it :)

Thank you for the recipe!
