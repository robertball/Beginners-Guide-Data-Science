My Mom has been making these since I can remember, but without the cheddar cheese.  The cheese makes them much better. I serve them as a side - as you would hash browns - with bacon & eggs. Frying them in the bacon pan doesn't hurt either.  The only reason I didn't give this recipe 5 stars is that it's not quite as good as potato latkes.  But, it is good and is a great use of leftover mashed potatoes.  If you're making these for the first time, I recommend green onions or chives.  Also, be sure to make the pancakes more like the size of sausage patties.  If you make them too big, they'll fall apart when you turn them.  Thanks for sharing this Deanne.

These potatoe pancakes were awesome. I did add 1/3 cup flour to pancakes together. I also added a splash of milk to get the right consistency and bacon bits. Served with sour cream. So delicious...Will definately make them again...Thanks...

I made these tonight and they were a big hit! I did some alterations, however, I did use the cheese, but I also added 3 tblsp. flour and some fresh snipped chives. I also added a teaspoon of garlic powder and a teaspoon of hot sauce and salt and pepper. My family loved them. I will be making this one again! A great way to use leftover mashed potatoes!

This is it! I've tried (and failed) many potato pancake recipes and this one is great!  I just added a little Bisquick to the mix (approx 1/4 c.), and a sprinkle of garlic salt, and added margarine to pan in between batches, and they came out perfect and delicious!!!  Thanks for submitting this recipe!  I will never have to throw out leftover mashed potatoes again!

These were ok, but I thought they were bland. I also had a hard time turning them. The second batch I made I added 3 tbs. of flour, 1 tbs. chopped onion, and 1 tsp. garlic powder. Then I served them with sour cream and they were very good.

These were good as starters.  Next time I will make sure to add extras like more cheese, bacon and onions.  This was my first time making potato pancakes.  They good several tries for me to become efficient at them.  Several ended up in big messes.  They are nore difficult to make than pancakes.  Be careful not to spread them too thin or you won't be able to flip them.

These were pretty good for potatoe pancakes made with mashed potatoes.  I guess I'm just spoiled. I'm used to my grandmothers potatoe pancakes that are made by shredding fresh potatoes, a ton of work but the difference in taste is all the difference

I made mine a bit flatter and cooked them longer, which made them crispier on the outside but still mashed on the inside, but they were still quite good, easy to make and tasty.

Thank you for the great recipe.  My potato pancakes to out crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside.  Loved the addition of cheese.  The trick to these are to make sure the mixture is cold consistency.  After adding all ingredients I place it back into the refrigerator for an hour.  Then took and coated them in flour before cooking them in butter.

We call these "Potato Cakes" and those made with raw grated potatoes are "Potato Pancakes" (like latkes).  We add flour to the mashed potatoes and also dredge in flour before frying.  We don't add cheese or onions or garlic (never tried that).  My friend puts bread crumbs on them (I'm not sure if she also puts it IN them?), but they're good that way too.

I have tried several times to make these and they are not really crispy enough to pick up.  Maybe this is the way thay are supposed to be and I just don't like them??

I've been eating these as well since a kid.  You know I've never thought to add cheese.  I've always added a lil' white onion.  No onion this time, used your recipe.  The cheese gave them a lil' firmer texture and they were wonderful.  My husband normally doesn't care for these because of the center being soft, but he really liked these.  Thank you.

This served as a great base recipe. I used the same amount of potatoes and cheese, but I added an additional egg and diced leftover spiral ham. The pancakes turned out great!

YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY!!!!  This is the only Potato Pancake recipe you need.  After reviewing other people's feedback here are some additions that I made.  I added chopped up leftover bacon (could do the same with sausage), three tablespoons of flour, a pinch of garlic salt, a pinch of pepper, and onion to taste (recommend you fry up the onion first).  Recommend you make them a little bigger then a sausage patty.  I made six nice size pancakes with the current measurements.  Recommend doubling if you are cooking for more then just three people.  Cook on medium heat.  Be patient, if you cook them too high you will burn them and the middle will not firm up.  This one is husband approved!

After following other readers' suggestions, I also added bacon pieces and scallions  and they were delicious! They did fall apart easily if made too thick, but keep them small, flatten them out and let them crisp good and they're perfect.

Delicious!!  I read several of the reviews before making my batch.  I needed to use up some leftover mashed potatoes.  They were lightly seasoned, so I added in plenty of cheese, green onions, bacon bits, a touch of minced garlic, and a tsp of salt.  I also added in 3T of Gluten-free Bisquick, as recommended by many reviewers.  I used a large skillet, 2T butter to sautee the pancakes.  I formed the pancakes by hand and smooshed them down a bit.  It made about 8.  I cooked on medium heat for about 5-8 minutes on each side.  They were perfect! Crispy outside, warm and creamy inside.

Still on the lookout for the perfect potato pancake recipe!  This fell apart too easily during the flip and just wasn't crisp enough.

I should have read the reviews before I cooked these...I was misled by the high number of stars.  I wish I would have known to add flour or bisquick b/c without it these fall apart in the pan.  My "pancakes" looked more like scrambled eggs!

I am giving this a 4-star because the taste was awesome.  I would give it a 2 1/2 star if it was based on ease.  It was VERY hard to flip the pancakes after they browned.  Mine pretty much came out broken in half, or in many pieces.  I added fresh garlic & green onions.  Went perfect with our barbeque chicken.  Probably won't make again in pancake form, maybe casserole form would work better.

These are excellent.  very adaptable to items you have on hand too! I added a few bacon bits, and parmesan as well as cheddar and some green onions--a couple shakes of bisquick does help hold these together!  YUM! Thanks!

Yummy! These are a little tricky to get the hang of, sorta like real pancakes, the first few turn out a little funky but still good. I added chives from my garden to these potato cakes. Warning though, be careful how much salt you add to the cake recipe, depending how much salt you put in your original mashed potatoes. I didn't add any because my mashed potatoes were already seasoned enough in my opinion the first time around.  Thanks for the recipe, I will come back to make these again when I am questioning how to use leftover mashed potatoes!  Tasty!

This is the best tator patty recipe I have ever tasted!  I did have to add about 1/4 cup of flour to get them to stick together but they are great!  My daughter will not eat mashed potoes but she loves these!

These were pretty good potato pancakes; at least they were much better than others I have tried. I took the advice of other reviewers and added a couple of tablespoons of flour to help hold the pancakes together, but I'm not sure it was necessary. The main thing to ensure something like this comes out right is to use a lot of oil, which I know Americans are loathe to do.  I made four large pancakes out of the recipe and fried them in about 1/4 cup of oil and they turned out perfectly -- no problems flipping them at all.  (I did add one clove of minced garlic which gave the pancakes a nice kick.  Also sprinkled some pepper on top whilst they fried.)

I've been looking for a recipe for potato pancakes made with mashed potataoes and I'm so happy to have found this one! These taste almost as good as the ones my stepmom made when I was younger. Good tasting & simple to make- the best combination. My kids & nephews loved them.

I am a beginning-intermediate cook who is trying to find quick and easy dishes to make while my wife is pregnant. This is my first dish to try from allreceipes.com and it turned out exceptionally well. I added green onions instead of chives, and mince garlic. However, it took me 1.25 hours to make because I had to make mash potatos from scratch. Thanks for the recipe, Deanne.

If you find that your potato mixture is too runny, just add instant potato flakes instead of flour. Also you'll want to chill these prior to cooking to help alleviate the 'falling apart' problem. What I did was scoop them out with an ice cream scooper, rolled them in panko, placed them on a plate and stuck them in the fridge. When you're ready to cook them, just squish them down a bit when they go in the pan so you're not trying to fry a ball! :) Experiment a bit with spices like minced onion, garlic powder, or even ranch mix! For the basic recipe I'm giving this five stars...they're great if you're careful with prep and execution. Thank you!

These were good. The mashed potatoes that I used had a lot of cream so I needed to add more flour for them to stick together. I also increased the cheese to 1/2 a cup.

Added the following: 1/3 C flour, onion flakes, garlic salt instead of salt.  All told, this recipe is good, but a little bland for what I like.  Wish I would have had a fresh onion to use.

I resisted the temptation to tinker with this recipe before tasting it and I was glad I did. The one change: bacon grease for frying. Served with a dollop of sour cream on the side, it was excellent. Lots of potato/cheese flavor. Crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside. Nice contrast.

This is the first time I ever made potato pancakes for my husband and he LOVED it.  I usually make mashed potatoes made with chives and sour cream and have left overs.  I did add 3 TB of biscuick as someone else suggested to give it a lift .. YUMMY !!  Thanks for sharing.

This is a very good starter recipie for potato pancakes.  So many personal taste modifications can be made. I did add 1/3 cup flour, 1 tsp each of onion & garlic powder along with 1 tbs parsley. To cut down on the fat content, I used pam instead of butter, & 2% shredded cheese. They are easily turned if cooked slow and allow to brown, pressing after turning. Thanks for the recipe.

Well, I didn't have leftover mashed potatoes, so I had to use instant mashed potato flakes. That being said, I had to use two eggs to get a somewhat decent consistency to work with. Even then it was very dry. I added garlic powder to mine, and omitted the salt. If I try this again, I'll make sure to use already made mashed potatoes, but that's my fault for not reading the recipe correctly.

The cheese makes it very interesting, a bit of a departure from my own recipe.  Don't add extra cheese.  I added sage to mine, which made my version a 5-star.  These are too bland.

This is a WONDERFUL recipe for leftover mashed potatoes.  I did add flour like one of the other reviews said to.  My entire family, including 2 yr old triplets couldn't get enough of them.  My pickiest eater asked for seconds and thirds.

My husband said right away that this recipe was a "keeper." I made instant mashed potatoes and then immediately made these. The only problem I had was trying to turn them over while at the same time keeping them together. The next time I make these I will make them smaller so they are easier to work with.

I used 2 1/2 cups of potatoes and 1 cup of Bisquick, added onions, a 1/2 tps of cayenne and kosher salt. Cooked on low. Be sure to could at least 10 minutes or more to make turning easier! They were delicious!

Just made these- they were a great recipe for my leftover mashed potatoes. Next time, I will not add salt. I usually don't mind salt, but between the salt from the cheese & the salt already in the prepared mashed potatoes, these were a bit too salty. This recipe as listed is 4 stars. Very basic & easy. Next time, I will add some garlic or veggies for a yummier potato pancake. Also made these thin & no bigger than a sausage patty. Had no issues with breakage/mess making them this size. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!  I took the advice of another reviewer and added a 1/3 cup of flour, other than that I followed the directions exactly.  I found that 5 minutes on each side was a little too long, so on my second batch I only cooked them for 4 minutes on each side and they were golden and perfect.  Will definitely make again!  What a great way to use left over mashed potatoes!

Very good and great way to use leftover mashed potatoes!
I only used a pinch of salt though. 
Next time I will add either some onion or bacon for a little more flavour.

I make these when my sister or I have tooth aches or pain in our jaws, or when we're just in the mood for something different! They're really good and even better with ketchup on them! I like to add just a little more cheese, though.

I made these for brunch today from leftover Thanksgiving mashed potatoes. Very good! I did add 2 eggs and scallions. Do cook these at med to med/low so they cook through and crisp without burning.

I added 1 more egg, 1/4 cup o flour and 1/4 of fresh chives. I fried them in bacon fat with oil and butter - just a small amount in a cast iron skillet on medium. They have been awesome both times I've made them.

I was quite pleased with these.  Used left over mashed potatoes and added green onions (a must after having tasted them).  Mine were a little soupy as well, so I had to quickly grab a pinch of flour.  Didn't think they'd turn out, but they did.   Will make again as I'm always on the lookout for recipes using leftovers.  Served with Spanish Omelet and fruit salad.

These were so good and so easy!! The cheese really made them tasty. I followed the directions but did use bacon grease instead of butter. We had them with grilled steaks for dinner. The next morning we had the leftover steak and potatoes with eggs for breakfast. Delicious!! Will definitely make these again~many times.

So I am making these now and have figured out that if you don't flatten them out enough they will fall apart.  I also think that a lower heat is better.  My first batch was on med high and I couldn't flip them at all, I threw them out.  I lowered it to med low at 5 min a side and they are perfect.

Everyone loved this recipe....I did add  1 tsp onion powder since other recipes call for some onions and my kids don't like them.  I also took the advice of some of you and added 2 TBSP of flour to help them stick together.  Served with sour cream and homemade applesauce.  Delicious!

Is a very nice recipe to build from, and use your leftover potatoes. I did add the flour as others suggested and worked very well. Thanks for sharing

These were so good! I did make a couple of changes though. My mashed potatoes were made with red potatoes and had little bits of the peel still in them. I decided to leave the peels and see what happened. I also added 1/3 cup of flour and a little garlic powder. I didn't have cheddar cheese so I used hot habanero cheese instead. I topped them off with a little sour cream and they were delicious! Great use of leftovers!

By far the best Potato Pancakes recipe I have found!! My only change was cut the salt in half and replace it with Onion Salt.

This is the best way to use up leftover mashed potatoes! The recipe as is is a bit bland - at least I like to add green onions and pepper. It is one of those recipes you can alter in a million ways though - the base is great.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for using the leftover mashed potatoes I usually end up with.  I made the recipe almost exactly except that I added a little more flour to the mixture. They key with these is cook over med heat about 4-5 mins before u turn them... they came out perfect and I love mine with sour cream on the side... However the next time I make them I will add some chopped onion because  I forgot it when preparing them but they still came out delicious!!Will definetly make these again! Thanx for the recipe!

yum these are so good , I’m just now making them for the second time but this time I mashed up the remains of  yesterdays leftover cheddar scalloped potatoes , sooo good and I didn't even need to season them, just add a little egg (enough to make it sticky) and roll in bread crumbs .

Yummy! Though I did add the 1/4 c. of flour as well, I didn't want to risk them not staying together for me, since I was DYING for them. They were very good and I make these all the time now!

Great use for the mounds of mashed potatoes we had left.  Used yams in one recipe. Served them with cranberry relish and a herbed butter cheese.

Tasty, a good use for leftover potatoes.  I added 1/4 cup bisquick, and sauteed onion and garlic beforehand in about 2-3 T butter before adding to potato mix.  I also added sage and thyme, about 1/4 t each.
These will break apart unless you coat in flour before placing in pan.  I also used a lot of oil, almost coating the entire bottom of pan, on medium heat.

Oh, yummy.  I was shocked that my kids even liked them.  As per most of the other reviews, I did add maybe 2 Tbsp. flour, and like another reviewer, I added approximately 1/4 tsp. sage.  The sage really made a difference.

Maybe I did something wrong. Everything just fell apart and made a big mess of mashed potatoes in my pan. I added flour and kept trying for them to stick together in a pancake form, and had no luck. I would not reccomend trying this recipe.

this recipe was good except the pancakes were mushy and runny and quite hard to flip. I would make this recipe again but with extra flour like the other members suggested.

I didn't use the flour recommended by the other reviewers. I should have.  These were tasty but fell apart.  I used a 1/3 cup measure to scoop them.  Maybe that was too big.

Tasty use of leftovers. As other reviewers have mentioned, making them "medium size" helps prevent them from falling apart. Also, I did add just a touch of flour to the potatoes and also a light coating of flour to the outside. They held together quite well and were not at all dry. Also, frying in bacon drippings does add a nice extra flavor.

These were yummy!  I had to add a little flour to my potatoes because they were too loose.  After that they fried very well.  I will make them next time with garlic mashed potatoes and then I think they will be smashing!!

These were very good and a great way to use leftover mashed potatoes. I spiced them up with onion flakes and bacon bits. I replaced the salt in the recipe with seasoned salt (Lawrys) and I think that really made a difference. If you like cheese, I would add more. These need TLC when flipping, so as others said, don't make the patties too thick or large. Don't crowd them on your pan either because it will make it more difficult to flip!!!

I have been searching for such a long time for a mashed potato pancake recipe and was very excited to use this recipe. It tasted great and the family loved it although I think I didn't have the thickness right but I just adjusted the cooking time for 5 minutes longer. will probably make again. sonya

This is a really delicious treat.  I used potatoes left over from "Party Potatoes" also found at this site.  I added some grated onions and served with roast beef sandwiches - also left over.  Everyone wanted seconds!  Highly recommended.

I loved them, the kids didn't get past one bite each - didn't like the texture. Too bad for them! ;) The only problem is we never, ever have leftover mashed potatoes lol. If I make more, they eat more! These stayed together nicely and were easy to flip. They would be awesome with bacon & onions, like big unrolled perogies!

Rather bland as written.  Need to add some onion (white, green or minced, dried).  Do not flip too early, they will fall apart.

Added a bit of shredded carrot and a bit of rice milk since the first pancake wasn't sticking together so well. Easy, delicious and a fast meal by just adding salad.

These are WAY too salty. But maybe it was because of the bacon I added, and the potatoes were already salted too.. Kinda weird anyways. I won't make them again.

These were quite good!  I added a little garlic powder and a few chopped green onions.  I also added a little flour to hold the batter together better.  They would be even better with some sort of sauce on the side, or sour cream and applesauce.

To anyone saying they are bland, this is a very basic recipe you can build upon. The trick is in boiling them with flavors and then adding a little pizaaz to the mix once mashed. I added minced garlic, onion salt, basil, chili powder and whole grain mustard in with the boiling liquid and instead of using water I used a mix of veggie and chicken broth. I'm adding chopped green onion to the mash and a spoon of parmesan with the cheese also. Its very good as a starting point as a base recipe.

Was expecting much better given the high rating and positive reviews. However, the potatoes were incredibly overpowered by the tasted of burned cheese, even when I undercooked the cakes. Will continue my search for a decent potato pancake.

For mashed potato pancakes, which usually lack in flavor, these were very good. I had a difficult time keeping the pancakes together. I didn't give it 5 stars, because I really don't think that potato pancakes really deserve five stars. That's just me.

This was a GREAT recipe!  My husband loved them.  It reminded him of when his father made potato pancakes when he was a child.  I made the same changes as other reviewers.  Adding 1/4 Bisquick to the recipe helped hold it together and adding the onions andn garlic salt made it very flavorable.  Thanks to Deanne & the other reviewers for making this a favorite in our house!

My family loved this dish!!!  It was very tasty!! The cheese added a GREAT flavor.  The only thing I had to do different was add flour.  When I tried to follow the original recipe... My mashed potatoes stayed mashed potatoes.  When I added flour to the mix... they turned into golden brown goodness!! Thanks for sharing your recipe.  We really enjoyed it!!!!!

Yummy!  I added milk and self-rising flour.  Fry on low heat in a little bit of oil, you can see the tops start to bubble like regular pancakes, check for a golden brown color on the bottom and flip.  Cook slowly (low heat) until browned. These came out crispy!

wow if i could, i would rate it 1000000 stars!!!!!!!!! it is great, especially if you add some basil on them. i used chedder and parmesan instead of just chedder, because i was almost out of chedder and didn't have enough. but the parmesan adds to the potatoes very nicely. oh and we didn't have potatoes so i used Idahoan instant mashed potatoes and it was awesome!!!!!

Wonderful!  I did have to add about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of flour to thicken the mashed potatoes up because my first batch was too runny and I had to throw it out.  I added Velveeta cheese because I didn't have any cheddar.  Then I topped it off with sour cream.  It was excellent!

I followed the recipe pretty accurately, though I did have to substitute Italian blend shredded cheese for the cheddar. I found that if you dump the 1/4 cup potato mixture on the griddle and then try to flatten, it makes a mess sticking to the spatula.  I ended up pressing them first, like you would a hamburger patty. The flavor was fine, as the leftover mashed potatoes were already seasoned w/ garlic, but the texture was still mushy/soft and not crispy. Not a bad tasting dish, but not exactly potato pancakes as I know them either. A bonus however: my picky one-year old loved them!

These were really good. Leftover mashed potatoes are always dry and not as tasty when reheated - so this is a great way to use them. I did add a little black pepper, dried sage and about 3 tablespoons of flour to help hold them together. I also increased the cheese to 1/2 cup. Letting them get nice and crispy (over medium heat) before flipping them is the key. Serve with dollops of sour cream.... YUM!

i made these following some reviewers' suggestions (added about 3 tbsp flour, and made the pancakes the size of a standard sausage patty), and they were FANTASTIC! i used leftover garlic mashed potatoes (in which i cooked a few cloves of garlic in the same water as the potatoes, then mashed everything together), and they were simply perfect. thanks for a great recipe!

Quick and easy with leftover things from the fridge! I added a dash of cayanne pepper to give it a little kick. Tasted awsome with a little ranch dressing.

I'm a fairly intermediate cook and couldn't get these to turn out.  They were greasy & fell into a million pieces.  

I did add flour to my second batch and they turned out a little better.

Of course, there were leftover mashed potatoes from Thanksgiving.  I wanted to make something for breakfast and went searching for a recipe.  I found this one and I'm so glad I did.  I did add about 1 tblsp of flour like other reviewers suggested and they were delicious with some fried eggs and bacon strips.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

My leftover mashed potatoes had been made with milk and were very soft to work with. I added a little flour to this recipe, but not quite enough. They fell apart when I flipped them over but the taste was well worth the effort. I will keep making them until they come out perfect.

I made these up for breakfast as a way to use up some leftover mashed potatoes . Hubby and I both enjoyed them with our eggs as a change from the usual hash browns.  As some others have suggested   I did add about a 1/4c of flour to the mixture as well as increased the grated cheddar cheese to about 1/2c. I would definitely make these again but think I would add even a bit more cheese next time.

Just the recipe I was looking for to use up leftover mashed potatoes. Simple, not many ingredients but next time I make it I’m going to add some paprika.

Had to cook longer to get a crisp crust and be able to flip without falling apart. Good but then added Panko and it worked a little better.  Great way to use left potatoes.

Really liked this. They cooked up nicely.  Added some garlic salt and chives. I may just have to make 'extra' mashed potatoes next time to ensure I have some leftovers.  :-)  Thanks for sharing.

Really nice when I followed some of the changes.  I added 2 tbsp of flour, a bit of paprika, and some garlic. I made small pancakes (about 3-4 cm across) as they are easier to flip and don't fall apart. We ate them with some Greek yogurt and really enjoyed them.

Fantastic ! Even my 4yr old  loved them.  Added like others recommend  green onion, 2 tbsp of flour. Did not add garlic as the original mashed potatoes  had garlic in them. Definitely a keeper!I won't be throwing left over  mashed potatoes  ever.

This was the first time I had ever made potato pancakes and my family and I really loved them.  When I make them again - and I will make them again - I will take the advice of the other reviewers and add a little bit of flour.  Great recipe, very simple and quick!  Thank you for sharing!

I made these cakes, per the recipe. They are very easy and quick to make, and taste great! I will change it up the next time I make it, but the recipe is good just as is. Really recommend this recipe for gluten free folk, who want a quick something to eat :-).

Deanne, your potato pancakes are awesome! I really like this recipe and I'm sure it will see a lot of use.  Note-  If you've added the 3 tablespoons of flour and they're still falling apart when you flip them, then you're flipping too soon.  You have to let the bottom get fully browned and firm before you try.  It also helps to use a rounded spatula.  Thanks again for sharing this.  We all loved them.

This is a great basic recipe. They are great on their own or you can dress them up with  anything you like.  My kids like them way better than just plain mash potatoes. Sometimes I add bacon bits to mine and serve with sour cream or plain yogurt.  They are like a loaded potato pancakes.  Watch the consistency of your batter; depends on how thick you make your mash potatoes.  If it is a bit runny you can do as some of the other reviewers suggest and added a little flour.

Easy and delicious!  I added 2 tablespoons flour, crumbled bacon, garlic salt and cayenne pepper. I also cooked them much longer because we like them extra crispy!  My husband and kids loved them!  No left overs!!!  Soooo easy!

I should have read the reviews about the flour, because I ended up with sticky, messy, hard to turn globs of potatoes. Tasted ok, but not worth the hassle.

When I made these as the recipe called I had a big mess.  Turning them was almost impossible.  I read the reviews and added flour and that made such a difference, they actually turned and looked like pancakes.  I'm only giving 3 stars because as is the recipe isn't that great.

I used some frozen mashed potatoes left over from thanksgiving. I left out the cheese and added 2 tablespoons of flour. I also made a sauce with a teaspoon of capers, 3 tablespoons of mayo, a teaspoon of dijon mustard and 1/2 teaspoon of red wine vinegar.  My parents really enjoyed them!

These were just ok. When I tried to press them with the spatula, they stuck to it and broke apart. I found a large metal spoon to be a little bit easier. Also if they start to break when you're trying to flip them, you need to wait a little bit longer before flipping. I found them a little more tasty after I sprinkled garlic powder on them.

Pretty good.  For me, I thought they needed a bit more seasoning (onion powder and garlic powder would do the trick) and some flour or something to help them stay together.  Will try it again next time with some tweaks.  Thanks for the recipe!

To me this recipe was just ok. Very bland flavour. Good base recipe and next time I will add more spices and more cheese, I might also add chopped up cooked whole potatoes to give it a more firm texture and sprinkle the top with more cheese.

My boyriend liked them but I was not impressed.  They did not hold their shape at all while cooking and came out very bland.  (I added salt pepper and garlic).  I may try these again but with some of the members tips.

I made these just as the recipe said and they turned out really well. Try not to rush them though because they will fall apart if you try to turn them over before they are ready.

I used up some leftover garlic mashed potatoes with this recipe. I imagine they have the potential to be a little bland with regular mashed potatoes. They weren't bad but not fantastic. I melted a little extra cheddar on top and served it with a dollop of sour cream on the side as well. Sounded gross but I thought I'd try it, YUM! Turns out sour cream is great!

Perhaps the recipe should call for using 'plain' mashed potatoes rather than the ones I make for dinner.  These were terribly runny and I had to add a lot of spices to flavor it up. On the brighter side though, my husband loved the crispy cheese that melted and cooked on the outside of the cake.  It did make a nice crust. I might try this again just to see if I can redeem this recipe. But only my husband ate them.

i followed the others lead with the flour and that helped. flavor was good. added little extra cheese and some pepper. hubby didnt care for them but my son loved them. dont know if i would make these again. good use of leftover mashed potatoes though!
