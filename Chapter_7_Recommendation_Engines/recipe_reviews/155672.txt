Way way WAY too sweet.  Not one person out of six liked them.  I added about 1/2 cup of cider vinegar the next day and reserved them and they were still too sweet.  They could practically be dessert! If you like your baked beans very, very, VERY sweet then this recipe is for you.  It definitely wasn't for us.

Was surprised to see this wasn't a five star recipie! We've been required to bring this to gatherings for 5 or so years. I did cut the brown sugar to 1\4 cup (you can always add more at tasting). The same with the salt, I added it at the end. If you substitute a different can for the Boston beans (lowest salt beans) beware of the spike in salt the others have. We've had several last min corrections till I figured it out.
     So glad I had to recheck this recipie, and put my 2 cents in.

These were awesome!! I completely disagree w/Tess that they're too sweet. My usual maple syrup/brown sugar/ & onion combo for beans is WAY, WAY sweeter than these!! The flavors all blended together & complimented each other very well! Fantastic alternative to your usual recipe!! A note: these make a TON! It completely filled my slow cooker-I actually had to take about 1 1/2 c out because they started spilling over. I ended up freezing 1/2 & serving the other 1/2 at a family get-together for 8 adults & 9 kids & it was plenty-even enough for many to go back for seconds! They LOVED them!!
