Excellent way to make ribs....my mom's also done them this way for years.  In a hurry, simply use a box of prepared stuffing,moistened with a little chicken broth.

My family enjoyed this recipe but the next time I use this recipe I will brown the racks of ribs before stuffing them.

I made the stuffing with sage; butter , onion and a little bit of chicken stock. Same as I would for turkey. This is my dad's favourite meal with mashed potatoes and broccoli. So I made it for Father's Day. :)

I loved them when my mom made them but these didn't come out the same. They were dry and tough. I ended up scraping the stuffing off and putting them in the pressure cooker for 15 minutes to make them edible.

Thank you so much for this recipe. I Smoked the ribs for three hrs at 220* then stuffed and tied. Then into a covered pan and into oven at 400* for 1-1/2 hr.
It was great.
