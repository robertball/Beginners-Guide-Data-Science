This recipe reminds me of a recipe for a cake which involves getting a cake mix and following directions on the back of the box.  Perhaps a recipe for Fried Chicken:  Go to KFC and get a bucket; bring home; eat!

A staple in our family for generations. I make them for my own children all the time. The only change I would make is to fry them in sunflower oil. Olive oil does add anything to the taste. They must be served with bacon, sausage, fried egg, mushroom, tomato and fried soda farls. An Ulster fry is a heart attack on a plate, but eaten once in a while, is a wonderful treat and a taste of home.

I made this & Soda Farls for Ferg's Ulster Fry Up (on this recipes site). I preferred the Potato Farl. Try this simple recipe, especially as part of the Fry Up!

This is the best recipe ever. I never did understand the instructions on a packet in pre-bought farls. Calling it a recipe is like an epiphany moment for me - it now all makes sense. 5 Michelin stars for Ita!
