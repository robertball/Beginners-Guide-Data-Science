Holy Hot!  The meatballs were too hot for my husband and I to take (and we like hot food!)  and we could not serve it to our young daughters because of that.  This recipe has some potential, but it was just far too hot for us.

These meatballs are great!  Just what I was hoping for.  I did make adjustments, based on taste.  I used 1lb of ground beef and only 2 chipotle peppers with about 1tsp of sauce.  The hamburgers came out really flavorful with a bit of spice.  Will definitely make again.  thanks!

I like the meatballs toasted with provolone on a sub roll.

Basic meatballs with an extra punch of flavor, very good & spicy smoky flavor.  I cut this recipe in half for the ground beef and with about three chipotle peppers which made approx. 20 meatballs.  Spiced up some plain pasta sauce with about a teaspoon of the chipotle pepper seeds, fresh garlic and italian spices.

I can't smell or taste much if anything due to a heavy cold, so I was going to let my family rate this.  My son thought it was much too spicy (and I reduced the Chipolte by half) and my daughter thought it was good, but not great.  All I got was the smokiness, so I assume it may have been too spicy.

This is great!  I use spaghetti squash in place of the pasta as well as ground turkey instead of ground beef to simply lower the calories and fat.  I love adding the chipotle peppers to the meatballs!  YUM!!

This is by far the best meatballs I've had.  I did however make some adjustments, I added dried parsley and minced garlic (instead of onion).  I will definitely be making these meatballs again.
