Correction: To seal samosas before frying, I usually dip them in laban then dredge them in flour . To make laban, use 1/4 cup yogurt and 1/2 cup water. There's no half and half. It's an easy recepie though it has long list of ingredients.

Sounds interesting, but I'm not sure what to do with the ingredients listed after the phyllo - 1 cup of flour in a yogurt sauce?!  Please help!

This was quite different as I always bake fillo dough.I think the trick is in drying yogurt really well till its crumbly. I also added salt at that stage. A small amount of filling is required and its not soggy at all. Thanks for an interesting recipe.

These were really good.  I liked the pastry part of it because it was crunchy and actualy had flavor!  The filling was very flavorful too, however it was quite    soggy inside even though I dried out the water as best as I could while cooking it.  You'd want to make sure you completely dry out the water before you fill it, otherwise you will have a soggy filling.

A little time-consuming but fairly simple to make, even for my first time frying something! Only needed half the dough, ran out of filling. Great combination of flavours in these.

Loved 'em! Not soggy at all. Added minced mushrooms to the filling, used 2sheets of phyllo per roll and replaced curry with garam masala.  Will make again.

I dont use phyllo dough, i make my own dough with flour, salt, ghee, and water and some spices. Besides that, these came out great!

Some rater couldnt figure out what to do with the yogurt and flour? Read the directions? No seriously, read the directions. lol Not the recipe's fault you couldn't take the time to read. They're even numbered for you.

just perfect! Still 4 stars because it's kinda hard and for the starters, its will take them over 4,7 times to do it correctly for my part, its took me 5trys to do this recipe. I love the idea: fast and yummy!

Don't know what went wrong but the yoghurt curdled immediately when I added it to the onion mixture in the pan.
