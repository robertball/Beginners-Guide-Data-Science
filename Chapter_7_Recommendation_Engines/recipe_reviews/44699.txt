I lost my Gran's recipe & was so happy 2 find the same one here! The recipe tastes great as written but over the years I've made a few changes(according to my personal taste)and with a few small adjustments, I prefer it. So, I thought I'd share. Firstly, instead of white sugar, I use 1/2 C packed brown sugar. The molasses in the brown sugar makes this pudding taste richer. The original recipe calls for 3 Tbs cocoa, I heap my Tbs to make it a bit more chocolately. I also find 1/4 C cornstarch was a little too much for me, as the pudding went as firm as jello the next day instead of staying creamy. If u add just over half that amount & cook it slightly longer it gels less. Of course, if you like it that way or are using this recipe to make a chocolate pie or square that you want to keep it's shape when cut, then you'll want to use the full amount. Lastly, I always use evaporated milk when cooking. It just tastes creamier to me. Thanks for posting this recipe, Kelly! Update,July 09: To avoid lumps, put 1st 4 ingredients in saucepan and mix well. If there are any lumps, get in there with your fingers and work them out. If you don't want to do it with your hands you can use a sifter or push them through a sieve. You must have a smooth, lump-free powder before you add your liquid. I also use a whisk and constantly stir. Lastly, it will sometimes thicken before it boils but I find if I don't let it boil for even just 10 seconds, I can taste the cornstarch in it. Thanks :)

Very very easy pudding. I also used three 'heaping' teaspoons of the cocoa, since I really enjoy a nice deep chocolate flavor. Make sure not to overcook, and never boil or it tends to try and lump up on you, but that can be resolved with a brisk whisking as the mixture starts to cool. Another tip is when you put it in the fridge to cool completly, try to make sure you have brought it down to about lukewarm temperature outside the fridge, I whisk away at it while having the sink filled about an inch or two deep with cold water and some ice cubes, really cuts down on the wait time for that. AND when you finally do put it in the fridge, use some plastic wrap to cover but make sure the plastic is lying directly on top of the pudding, actually touching it all the way over the top. This seems to prevent that top layer of strange congealed pudding you sometimes get when the pudding sits for awhile,which taste fine, but is a bit odd compared to the creamy pudding underneath it.

OMG!  This is heavenly and easy!  My only suggestion is to, like the recipe says, make sure you bring it to a boil.  Mine JUST started boiling, but it stuck to the spoon and because I was worried about it burning, I removed it from the heat.  I think had I let it boil for just moments longer it would have been thicker.  FYI, I used skim milk.  I thought it had a very rich flavor and definitely took care of my pregnant chocolate craving. :)

Maybe not five stars as an intricate, elaborate dessert, but certainly five stars for a humble, homemade chocolate pudding. Perfectly sweet.  Perfectly chocolatey. Perfectly creamy and comforting.  I made no changes to the recipe.

I have my grandmother's chocolate pudding pie recipe, well HAD it, and couldn't find it today when my 10-year old son and I wanted to make it, so I looked on Allrecipes.  Found this one and made it as the ingredient list is  the same, just different proportions.  It is very, very good.  I baked a pie crust and poured the warm pudding into it; am waiting for it to chill.  But, as I doubled the recipe there was a good bit leftover and son and I have tried it.  This is almost exactly the flavor of the recipe I've lost! I'm so happy and son is too! Chocolate pudding pie is a three-generation family favorite for us, so I am really picky about how I make it. This recipe is smooth, creamy, not too sweet when made properly. Be sure to cook over MEDIUM heat and don't get in a hurry after it boils, give it a few more minutes.  Put plastic wrap on it to avoid the "skin."

My daughter Kelly submitted this (my) recipe a number of years ago...this is still my favorite, after all these years. I've been reading some of the reviews. I now make this recipe with only 1/3 Cup of white sugar. I also heap the cocoa measurements. Also, after cooling a bit, place plastic wrap right down over the top of the pudding and this prevents the rubbery film from forming.  DO NOT REDUCE THE CORNSTARCH MEASUREMENT.If it's too think you're over cooking it, if it's too thin...you're under cooking. I've found this recipe to be virtually fool proof. ENJOY!!

YUM! This recipe gets five stars not only because it tastes so good, but also because it's TWO desserts in one. You have your pudding.. and spoon some into some popsicle molds and you have homemade fudgecicles! I used splenda instead of sugar so the texture was a little different, but I don't mind the difference.

This was sooooo good!!!!   I am never buying the boxed pudding mixes again!  I spooned this pudding into popcicle molds and made some fantastic homemade pudding pops.  This pudding is also good poured hot over brownies with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.  My diet is shot!!!

My usual chocolate pudding recipe calls for 1 egg...and I just ran out.  So I decided to make this and it turned out great.  1/2 cup of sugar wasn't quite sweet enough for me, so next time I might try 3/4 cup.  I reduced the amount of butter to about 1 tbls. but no other changes.  Thanks Kelly.

Good, basic pudding recipe.  Here's tip for unexperienced pudding makers: don't stir constantly until the milk starts to boil.  I used to stir the milk the whole time, and it would take FOREVER to boil and the milk would sometimes get a burnt flavor because it was on the heat for so long.  Only stir occasionally until it starts to boil (otherwise it keeps losing the heat and won't get hot enough to boil), and then stir constantly for about 2-3 minutes before taking it off the heat.  If you do that, then it is easy and relatively fast to make pudding.

FANTASTIC!!! Oh my goodness, I'm going to be making this all the time... it's just as fast and easy as making up a boxed pudding, but so, so, SO much better. The butter adds so much. Didn't change a thing, except added some almond extract second time I made it. Thank you so much!!!

This recipe brought back a lot of memories.  My grandmother made something very similar to this for her children, and then her grandchildren.  Kids and adults will love it!

Definitely 5 stars for ease and taste!  This is a great stand-by comfort food recipe.  Will definitely make again.  The only thing I did differently was to use  heaping tablespoons of cocoa powder because I wanted it chocolate-y!  This is my new keeper.  =)

Very thin - despite the fact that I added an egg yolk for extra richness (which was the only change I made).  Good as a sauce - not as pudding.

Fantastic!! I had been craving chocolate pudding for like two days and decided to make it from scratch instead of buying the boring box version.  It turned out phenomenal and I'll definitely be making this again.  As for my personal taste, I could have appreciated a little more salt but it was still very good.  One great hint: USE A DOUBLE BOILER!!!  However, when using a double boiler to make pudding: boil the water in the bottom pot on high FIRST before adding the top pot. While waiting on the bottom pot to start boiling, add all the dry ingredients to the top pot and whisk until WELL blended to get rid of any dry clumps.  Once the dry ingredients are blended, add the top pot to the pot of boiling water and then add your milk a little at a time while whisking briskly. This technique will give you a flawlessly smooth texture without any clumps AT ALL.  ENJOY!!

For taste, this pudding earns five stars. Overall and as written, 4. I rounded the tablespoons of cocoa for a more chocolaty flavor and it was perfect. It wasn't bitter or that really dark, rich chocolate. Still light and creamy but just chocolaty enough. Be sure to use salted butter and add the additional salt; it really makes a difference as salt enhances chocolate. Eaten hot, the pudding's consistency isn't a problem but once it stars to cool down it firms up like gelatin. Next time I'll decrease the cornstarch. I also used butter (never margarine). For best results use a whisk for this recipe and be sure to scrape the "corners" of the saucepan constantly to avoid burning. I love how easy and delicious this was, and will totally be making it again.

My Mom would make this chocolate pudding for me after I came in from ice skating! Yum. You can also use 1 square of unsweetened chocolate,use half and half and double the vanilla. I have made it this way for my kids and they agree it is very yummy.

This was really good!  The second time I wanted it to be a little more rich and creamy so I used 17% cream (buy cutting 35% whipping cream with 1/2 water) and used 5 tbsp of cocoa instead plus 4 squares of Lindt 70% chocolate.  Oh my!  

I continued to whisk it every 10 minutes or so while it was on the counter to keep it from forming the "skin".  Once cooled, it stayed super creamy without having to worry about the top going hard.  mmm  Thanks!

I've made this pudding so many times and I really apologize for not rating it sooner. Any time I'm ready for a tasty something of my childhood comforts, I automatically think of chocolate pudding and I always go to this recipe. Most of the time I don't even let it cook off! It is super easy, has all the flavor that only cocoa can provide and it is absolutely delicious.  There was no school today because of snow and my daughter called and asked for that "chocolate pudding recipe you always made on snow days for me so I can make it for the kids".  Pay it forward baby!! Thanks, Kelly.

Mmmm. Didn't quite make it to a boiling point for it to coat my spoon. Used splenda(2oz), one tbspn of margarine, and probably close to 4 tbspn cocoa. This didn't last long in my house. You must try this recipe.

This was very good.  I quadrupled the recipe (large family) and used fresh, raw goat milk.  I did everything else almost exactly according to the recipe.  TIP: For those of you that found that your pudding gets grainy the next day, that's because food thickened with corn starch is meant to be heated and then eaten hot.  When it gets cold it causes the food to separate.  I used the same amount of a product called "Clear Jel" which is a modified corn starch.  I use it for home canned pie fillings as a thickener because it thickens fast and is stable at room temperature and when it's cold.  Here is what I did: I added all the dry ingredients (1/2 white, 1/2 brown sugar) to the saucepan except the Clear Jel and worked all the lumps out (I did add a bit of whole egg powder but I don't think it was necessary and I wouldn't do it again).  Next I added all the milk less 1/2 - 1 cup to the saucepan and stir well.  Then I mixed the reserved milk and Clear Jel in the Magic Bullet to get all the lumps out.  Bring the pudding mixture to a boil like the recipe calls for and once it's boiling, add the milk mixture all at once and stir rapidly.  It will thicken almost immediately to an almost "too thick" mixture.  Once I added the butter and vanilla, it was exactly the perfect texture and the texture will stay the same after it's refrigerated.  You can get Clear Jel online; it's usually available at your local co-op or extension service.

The saying, "good thing comes to those who wait" certainly holds true w/ this recipe. We followed the recipe (w/ no changes) and it turned out great.  I used fat free milk since that's the type of milk we always use.  FYI - several have commented about the "skin" which forms on top of the pudding.  To avoid this, place a layer of plastic wrap directly on the top (so it's touching the pudding)of each bowl.  No more skin. This is a keeper!

Very good and easy chocolate pudding recipe.  One note however - be careful with your cornstarch.  Make sure you add milk to cornstartch rather than adding the cornstarch to the milk.  I ended up with lots of clumps of cooked cornstarch that made it a little like chocolate tapioca pudding!  Still a good flavor, just some weird rubbery chunks floating around because the cornstarch didn't get disolved.  I'll definitely make again though.

Easy to adapt for diabetics to make a sugar-free treat. I have experimented with various amounts of Splenda, including 1:1, 1.5:1, and my favorite, 2:1. It always takes more Splenda than sugar, no matter what the package says. Because I love deep chocolate, I use 5 level tablespoons of Dutch process cocoa, which makes a huge difference in this recipe. Dutch process cocoa has been alkalized, which neutralizes the acidity that is present in non-alkalized cocoa, such as Hershey's, the most readily available brand in the US. It costs more to buy Dutch process cocoa, but it's money well spent. I buy it in bulk online and use it in everything that calls for cocoa, such as hot chocolate, cakes, and cookies. However, since I have added a full 2 Tb beyond what is called for in the recipe, I believe that's at least part of why it takes so much more Splenda. I've learned to streamline the process by cooking it in the microwave. Give it 3 minutes at full power initially, then whisk well, and set for increments of 1 minute, whisking well after each minute until it reaches the consistency you like, remembering that additional thickening occurs after refrigeration. For me, in my 1000 watt microwave, I only need one additional minute, but bear in mind that your mileage may vary. Add the butter and vanilla, whisk one last time, pour into serving dishes and chill. About 7-8 minutes, start-to-finish. Great depth of chocolate flavor. Simple, satisfying comfort food.

My pudding didn't thicken as much as I expected. The flavor was good though. And I made fudge pops with them as another person did. They were so yummy! I'll probably make this pudding again this summer when I'm craving a fudge pop!

This was unbelievably good and so simple. I substituted chocolate soy milk because I'm off dairy and I did make sure to let it boil for a few minutes so it was nice and thick on the back of the spoon. The taste was amazing. My husband couldn't stop raving and had trouble believing I'd used "fake" milk.

this is one of the best recipes ever!!!!  i made this on a snow day without having to go to the store for anything.  i used 1% milk and it still came out creamy and chocolaty and delicious!  just whisk until you can't whisk anymore and it will be creamy, no lumps and won't " break" in the fridge.  i can't say enough about this pudding except TRY IT!

My mother used to make this pudding when I was a little girl.  She also made a vanilla version that she called "Blanc Mange" (Blah-Mahnge - not Blank Mange).  Happy memories.

I am not a chocolate pudding eater, but my DH is and he LOVED this pudding.  He said it is very creamy with the right amount of chocolate.  It was very easy to make and within 25 minutes it was made and the kitchen was cleaned up.  I like recipes like this.

This is the easiest pudding recipe I have ever found! To change it from chocolate to vanilla, omit the cocoa powder (obviously), add about a half teaspoon or so of more vanilla, and add about 3 egg yolks. You need to make sure you cook this thoroughly, especially if you use egg yolks!

I just made this ( had a craving for chocolate puddin'!) and it's outstanding!
The butter added at the end made it so smooth and creamy!  Simple ingredients and so easy to make.
I can see making this when we camp - what a treat!
Thanks, Kelly - I'll make this often!

This is delicious!  I used more cocoa because I like dark chocolate.  I didn't find it too thick like other reviews mentioned - but I had that in mind while I cooked it so I made sure not to cook it too long.  I also stored it with plastic wrap directly on the top of the pudding so you don't get that yucky pudding skin while it cools.

This is just like what I remember my mom making when I was a kid.  You just can not go wrong with this easy and delicious recipe.  I doubled it for our family of six to have plenty for later (if it lasts that long).  Thanks so much for sharing!! TIP #1: If you don't want that skin to form on top while cooling, place plastic wrap directly on top of the pudding after slightly cooling in pan from stove and you poured into a bowl to chill. TIP#2: Let cool on counter 10 min or so before chilling so you do not get condensation on the plastic wrap causing water on top of pudding.  Remove slowly  when chilled and enjoy:)

This is an excellent, quick recipe when you need a chocolate fix. You can adjust the flavor/sweetness by adjusting the sugar, cocoa, or vanilla slightly until you get it just the way you like it. You can also use a drop or two of mint extract instead of the tsp of vanilla. 

Make an extra batch and FREEZE it! These make the best fudgsicles. After it has cooled slightly, spoon it into Popsicle molds.

The flavor was pretty good, though not chocolatey enough for us. Also, my pudding had these little congealed bits in it, though I stirred constantly. I let it cool overnight, and the texture was so coagulated, I had to toss it. I really wanted to love this, sorry.

Thanks for a great pudding recipe. I made a chocolate pie with it. I first made a graham craker crust and then poured the pudding into the crust. After the pudding had cooled a bit, I put 3/4 of a cup of mini chocolate chips in it. Then I served it with whip cream and a few mini chocolate chips over the top. My family loved it, especially my step daughter.

I gave this 4 stars just because I think the amount of cornstarch is way more than is necessary and there needs to be more cocoa.  I tweaked my pudding using flour instead of cornstarch (substitution is 1 tbsp cornstarch equals 2 tbsp flour)and 1/4 cup cornstarch is 4 tbsp   so you would -according to this recipe- need 8 tbsp flour or 1/2 cup.  I only used about 5 tbsp and the consistency was PERFECT once it chilled.  I also added about 4 tbsp cocoa give or take (I didn't measure accurately) as well as a hint of cinnamon.  I was wanting cinnamon chocolate :). Cook it till it looks like a really thick soup and chill before eating.  I personally do NOT like warm puddings unless its bread pudding.  Very quick and easy pudding with just things you have on hand!  Good eats!

Who knew homemade chocolate pudding is just as easy to make as the boxed stuff? And it tastes SO much better! I was craving something chocolatey last night, but my baking supplies are running low, so I used what I had in my cupboard to do an ingredient search on this site, and this is what popped up. I'm glad it did! I made pretty much as stated, but subbed smart balance spread for the butter as that's all I had. I used 1% milk and I used heaping tablespoons of cocoa powder as suggested by many, and I added in a handful(1/4 cup?) of chocolate chips when I added the butter. Wow, it was just fantastic! I know it says 4 servings, but it only lasted my mom and I through our Sunday night tv shows(Big Brother, The Last Ship and Falling Skies). I can't comment on how it is chilled since it never made it that far, but it does form a "skin" on top even just cooling on the counter. I'm sure plastic wrap directly on it would help, but my mom likes the "skin" she says that's how REAL chocolate pudding should be and it tasted just like her mom used to make for her growing up! I will be making this again(after grocery day)on Thursday when my mom is over to catch up on our shows of the week(Big Brother, Under the Dome and Extant), I doubt the pudding will last through that! I may try to add some peanut butter or mint extract in it this time, just so many possibilities! Thanks so much for the recipe! :)

I made this pudding for a pie and was very disappointed. It was gritty from the sugar and pastey tasting from the cornstarch. I didn't want to put 1 star because it wasn't even worth that!

Amazingly easy to make and good - but I do agree with many other reviewers that it can definitely stand to be more chocolatey. I like the idea some others had of adding chocolate chips. I wonder if chocolate milk would work too? Other than the slight absence of chocolate, this turned out well, nice texture. Thanks for the recipe.

Not bad.  Not a lot of chocolate flavour though.  Easy enough to make with kids, but I'd either add more cocoa or find a way to add some chopped chocolate to bump up the flavour.

This recipe turned out perfectly.  I sprinkled it with a handful of Heath bits just because I'm a glutton, but it would have been great without.  Thanks!

More like 4.5 stars

A very nice basic chocolate pudding recipes. I heard alot of people decreasing the cornstarch BUT DO NOT. I used what was asked of the recipe and the pudding came out great. I always thought pudding was too time consuming but it was really quite simple and tasty

I read reviews that people found is soupy. Not too put fault but I at first thought it was going to be soupy but you just need to keep on stirring because it does take a little patience. You will need to keep stirring the whole 10 minutes and it will thicken up

I made it for a special date night with my husband and he really liked the homemade taste

Will make again for special occasions

Comfort food at it's best! It does require some patience to bring the mixture to a boil...but it is worth the wait and all the stirring. This is delicious served warm...the first time I made it I ate the whole thing myself! I doubled the recipe the next time so I would have some leftover to refrigerate. It still tasted great cold, although it doesn't look very pretty. That's why I only gave it  four stars...I wouldn't serve it to company and it might be a hard sell for someone who doesn't love pudding. I love the fact that I can satisfy a sudden chocolate craving with just a few ingredients usually on hand. I know I'll be making this one again this winter!

Very good!  I added a bit more butter, but this was probably the best pudding recipe I've ever had.  I personally like it best after it's cooled and has a nice, thick 'skin' on the top. YUM!  

I don't know if the family liked it or not, since I ate the whole batch myself.  Guess I'll need to make more.
:o)

Great basic recipe, but it was too thick, too sweet, and not quite chocolatey enough for my personal tastes.  I tweaked it to just 1/4 cup maple sugar, 1/2 cup dutch processed cocoa, and 3 Tbsp corn starch in 3 cups of skim milk.  I whisked the dry ingredients first to make sure no lumps, and added the milk gradually while whisking so everything was fully incorporated before putting on the heat.  It took about 10 minutes on medium heat to reach a low boil, and I kept it simmering while I stirred for another 3 minutes or so.  Perfect texture and taste for me.  Thank you so much for such a great, easy recipe!

PERFECTION. The only change I made was to up the cocoa powder to four heaping tablespoons, because I REALLY needed a chocolate fix. I'm saying goodbye to the boxed mix - this was so much better and SUPER easy.

I just made this pudding and it's cooling in the refrigerator right now. I chose this recipe because of the simple ingredients and the easiness of the instructions. I didn't change a thing about the recipe and by the looks of it it should taste great tonight after dinner!

SOOO very delicious and easy to make, there's no reason to buy it in a box if you have this recipe.  For even more chocolatey flavor, make sure your tablespoons of cocoa are heaping.  Other than that, I wouldn't change the recipe one bit.  For the small handful of reviewers complaining that this recipe is too thin, your cooking technique is off.  If you follow this recipe, your pudding will come out fine.

Great recipe! I just mix everything in the pan on the counter, not over heat, and when cook it, the heat is medium-high (but, hey, it's just me). For those who made it and it came out soupy, cook it until it's really, REALLY thick, almost lumpy. Trust me, I've made it for a while now, and the last few tries it has become soupy, but I just made it two days ago, and making it so thick it's kinda lumpy makes it. Have ALL faith in my suggestion, because it will come out smooth (when you eat it).

This reminds me of pudding my grandmother would make when I was a kid! Only she put way more butter in it and we would eat it over biscuits while it was hot. She called it Chocolate Gravy. A very nostalgic recipe. I have a McCormick's Cocoa Chili spice that I added the second time and it added a little more of a modern edge to it. This is a great, inexpensive, tasty desert!

My daughter has sever food allergies and I made this pudding for her and substituted soy milk for regular milk.  It was great.  I even froze it into pudding pops or added more cornstarch to make a chocolate pudding pie.  Everyone always loved it and never thought it tasted allergen free

This was awesome! So rich and creamy. I think the real trick is using whole milk. I used heaping spoonfuls of cocoa powder to give it the extra chocolate taste. For anyone who didn't get this recipe right, use whole milk and stir constantly. If you use skim milk you probably need to add more cornstarch.

Wow!  I haven't made homemade chocolate pudding in a long time because the recipe I tried many years ago just didn't cut it.  This one, however, was spectacular!  I followed a couple of the hints from others--used rounded tablespoons of cocoa and used packed brown sugar in place of the white sugar.  I also tasted it and found it needed 1/4 tsp. salt to a single batch perfectly balance the flavors instead of 1/8 tsp.  Although I only had skim milk on hand, since it was the holidays I didn't want it to taste watered down, so I replaced 3/4 cup of skim milk with heavy cream.  Although we are not really dessert eaters, the 6 of us who had it ate a double batch! Hmmmm...maybe this is not such a good recipe after all! : )

Very tasty! This recipe has an almost identical thickness and flavor to Jello pudding. My only complaint is the texture. I used Hershey's cocoa powder, which I presume is reasonably high quality, but the pudding ended up with a minor yet noticeable graininess. Next time I'm going to try melting baker's chocolate into the thickened unflavored custard and see if that makes for a better mouth feel.

Overall, this was pretty good and was really easy and quick to make. I did find it a little bit sweet, so next time I'll add less sugar. I used a vanilla from the Domincan Republic, so it had a unique, almost coconuty taste. I added some cinnamon to half the batch and turned it into a Mexican chocolate pudding.

This was soooooooooogood!  I used 1% milk and added a bit more cocoa powder.  It came out perfectly!  I poured it into small disposable containers with covers so I could pop one in my lunch bag- way better than the packaged stuff, and cheaper too!

This was perfect homemade chocolate pudding. I used fat free evaporated milk for a creamier flavor but I made no other changes. No leftovers and my husband and I were fighting over licking the spoon/pan. I think this would make excellent "pudding pops" this summer, I can't wait to give it a try. Thanks, Kelly, for sharing your recipe.

After the mixture thickens, add 6 oz chopped milk chocolate & keep cooking over medium heat until melted (about 1 minute extra).  Then take off heat to add butter and vanilla. I used whole milk.

This is a great recipie! I also used heaping spoonfuls of cocoa. I garnished with some raspberries, the kids loved it!
To make sure there were no lumps I mixed all the dry ingredients in the pan and then poured in only about 3/4 of the milk, I wisked it until it was completely smooth and then added the rest.

I followed the advice of many reviewers and used 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of white, heaped the cocoa powder tablespoons and didnt fill the 1/4 measure cup up completely with corn starch. I also used skim milk because its all we buy. :) With the above changes- it was DELISH!! We are eating it warm as I type! Thanks for sharing.

I love this recipe.  So simple and satisfying. As others have suggested, I whisk my dry ingredients together in a pot and add about 2 oz milk, stir till smooth.  Then I slowly add the rest of the milk over medium low heat and continually whisk until it gently boils then remove from heat.  I use regular soy milk and a product called Mimic Creme as I'm lactose intolerant.  Sometimes I add instant coffee granules (sanka) for a little extra kick.  Quick, easy, hits the spot.  Thank you Kelly for a delicious pudding recipe.

I Have been making this for a year now & we all love it!  The only changes i have ever done is to add cooked rice for chocolate rice pudding & it was a treat!  One other time i whipped up some heavy cream & folded it in & it was divine!  So easy & simple to make & reminds me of my childhood when everything was made from scratch

I've made A LOT of cornstarch puddings and this is the best one yet. I like mine warm, right out of the pan, in the winter, but I've never been known for my patience. I use three HEAPING tbs of hershey's special dark cocoa for a deep rich flavor and color. A tip - throw the sugar and cocoa in your coffee grinder and give it a buzz - it'll dissolve much more easily into the milk. Just prepare yourself to stand there and whisk till it feels like your arm is going to fall off - totally worth losing an arm though.

My husband and I were hungry for homemade chocolate pudding and didn't want to run out to the store for the ingredients. Found this recipe and were able to use what we had in our pantry. I have to say I will NEVER buy pudding in a box anymore. This pudding was very easy and quick. Chocolate flavor was excellent and very creamy. Made up some real whipped cream as the topping and we both were in heaven. You also know what ingredients go into it and don't have to look at the package for preservatives. I would recommend this to anyone that wants a quick, easy and delicious pudding recipe.

This recipe didn't work for me. It becomes watery and never comes out to be thick at all! Even if you stick it in the freezer for hours it turns out soupy and like hot chocolate! I have attempted this recipe 4 times each time turned out just the same!

This is fast, easy, and delicious.  I made a mistake and used 4T of cocoa instead of the three called for.  No problem, it was excellent.  We will be making this a lot, and I will add the dry ingredient "mix" to my pantry along with our other homemade mixes.

Delicious! I added 3 "heaping" tablespoons of cocoa, used 2% milk, and cut the cornstarch in half. Still made a rich and very excellent pudding. Now I never have to buy pudding mix again, thank you!

Oh my god! TO DIE FOR!!!!! This is really tasty! I did reduce the cornstarch like previous reviewers suggested since I don't like gelatinous pudding the next day but it didn't last that long! I mixed in bananas - YUM! And I put some in popsicle molds, they make the most delicious fudgcicles!!

I just love this recipe.  I've made it many times and it always comes out great.  Just make sure  you cook it long enough and chill it well.

I usually substitute  some kind of liquor for the vanilla - brandy, creme de cocoa, and kirchwasser have all worked well.  My favorite is the brandy.

I love this stuff.  I would give it 5 stars if it was suggested to use a can of evaporated milk in place of part of the regular milk.  It really makes a difference.  I use almost all of mine to make fudgesicles.  So much better than anything you can buy at the store.

Jell-O might provide a  quicker, more convenient chocolate bang, but THIS recipe is much tastier -- skip the box and go for homemade cholately yumminess! :o)  TIP: place plastic wrap directly on the warm pudding before chilling to ward off the "skin" that will form on the surface of the pudding.

I used powdered milk (instant nonfat) and it still turned out sooo goooood. I ate it warm and it was rich, thick, creamy... Mmmm. I put in an extra shake of milk and a bit of extra butter but I think it would have turned out perfectly regardless. It had a pie-like consistency after being cooled though.

This recipe will be much better after a few changes.  I did add extra cocoa powder which helped however next time I will use only high quality powder like Droste.  The pudding is a bit too sweet for our tastes so I will cut down on the sugar.  Not fantastic but definite potential.

Made as written, but used skim milk.  Slight aftertaste and not chocolately enough for me.  If I make this again, I'll add more chocolate and use regular milk.

Outrageously good!  Instead of regular cocoa powder, I used "special dark" and, as a chocoholic, I was in absolute heaven  So easy, so yummy.  We'll be making this a lot on cold winter nights.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe but I cannot rate it because I am going to have to try making it again   Used Splenda instead of real sugar and it never thickened.  Since I followed the directions exactly, I am going to assume that it did not thicken because I substituted Splenda.  Will make again and then rate.

So good and EASY!  I was doing the boxed "cook and serve" kind but this is more tasty, cheaper and just as easy!  I've had this recipe saved for like a year, and finally decided to try it, and I'm glad I did!  Served while still hot with some peanut butter chips on top- they melt so deliciosly over the chocolate!

If I could I would rate this recipie a 10. I just made 6 servings of this pudding recipie and I tasted it while it was warm  "FANTASTIC, DELICIOUS, WONDERFUL". This pudding is so good I thought my tounge was going to slap my brains out. It is so easy and takes no time to make. Who needs boxed pudding when you can have the best. I can't wait to eat it when it is cold. There is one thing I did change though, instead of 3/4 cup of sugar I used 1/4 cup plus 2  tablespoons (that is 1/2 of the sugar of what the recipie called for) of Splenda Blend for Baking because the gentleman I made this for is a diabedic and can't have all the sugar (chocolate pudding is his favorite). Also, I put the pudding in individual cups and on the bottom I put 2 banana slices, put 2 tablespoons of pudding on top of the bananas then I put 4 banana slices on top of the pudding them filled the cup with more pudding and topped it with 4 more slices of banana then put a tablespoon of whipped cream on top (I called it chocolate pudding suprise). Can't wait to try it with other fruit like strawberries. HATS OFF TO THE LADY THAT SUBMITTED THIS RECIPIE AND HATS OFF TO HER MOTHER TOO.

This recipe is great, although I did modify it quite a bit. I used skim/fat free milk. I used 1/4 c. white sugar and 1/4 c. brown sugar. It wasn't chocolately enough, so I threw in a generous handful of semi-sweet chocolate chips right before adding the margarine & vanilla. I used only 1 tbsp. of margarine. These modifications made a fantastic, quick, and easy treat! I am a chocoholic and I found that it was actually almost too rich (despite the skim milk & 1/2 margarine) because of adding too many chocolate chips. I think next time I'll just add an extra tbsp. of cocoa and it will be perfect. As an added bonus, when you use fat free milk & only 1 tbsp margarine, it's a pretty low cal/fat treat!

Thank goodness!  I had my wisdom teeth out yesterday and needed a soft recipe I could stand to eat!  I ate this warm and put some in the freezer for pudding pops.  I followed another reviewers advice not to use so much corn starch but maybe mine could have used a little more.  Everything else is great and I will make this again and again!

Fantastic chocolate pudding!  So easy and everything's already in the pantry.  I added a bit more cocoa powder.  Wouldn't add more sugar, as it's just sweet enough (but not too sweet).  I used 1% milk and it came out perfectly; next time I will try nonfat.  No more store-bought for us.  :)

mmmmmm, yummy... licking the bowl as I type! Didn't have any milk so I substituted a can of evaporated milk and 1 1/2 c heavy cream (as if this needed extra calories- but oh well a girl's gotta have her chocolate).  Be sure to stir the whole time to avoid lumps.

This was so easy and tastes great! I added a little more powdered chocolate because I wanted a stronger flavor but I really did enjoy this recipe especially since I could have a less sweet pudding unlike those instant jello ones. thanks!

Doesn't get much better than this!!  Made this recipe a few hours ago and can't wait for it to get chilled in the fridge.  I did sample it hot and it was awesome!!  The only thing I did different was kick start the cooking in the microwave.  About 2 min and stirring every 30 sec. until it started to thicken.. Then on the stove on medium heat and stirring constantly.  I let it boil 2 to 3 min on the stove and no sticking to the bottom of the pan.  Oh, I also used 3 "rounded" tablespoons in measuring the cocoa.  I also "tapped" the cocoa and cornstarch through a tea strainer as another reviewer suggested.  Did I say this chocolate pudding was awesome??  Thanks for this recipe!

Delicious...NOTHING like Jello instant pudding!! It's the real thing! I heaped my tablespoons of cocoa used brown sugar instead of white, and used 1 can of evaporated milk with the balance of 2% milk. I  put the cocoa and corn starch through the sifter to remove any lumps. I used approx 1/8 cup corn starch, but should bump that up a bit next time. I stirred it constantly over medium heat JUST until boiling. Cooled the pan in ice water in the sink (stirring constantly) then transferred to a serving bowl and covered with plastic wrap "touching" the pudding to prevent the film from forming on top. Refrigerated for a few hours, dished it into individual servings and topped with whipped cream...wonderful dessert!

My daughter requested chocolate pudding, so we made it using what we had. 2 cups of almond milk with 3/4 half and half, brown sugar instead of white (she loves it so that was by choice), and the rest remained the same. Amazing. We used a little less sugar and a little more cocoa than called for, and it's simply gorgeous and rich.

Same recipe I've used for 40 years.  If you like it a bit thicker, you can use a bit more cornstarch.  Just a note-- if you are low on milk but have instant powdered dry milk, you can add the dry milk powder in with the sugar and other dry ingredients and just add in the water that is necessary to make up the correct amount of milk.  It doesn't hurt the taste.  This is obviously a keeper recipe.

I made a few tweaks, because we don't use dairy milk or straight sugar. I used almond milk and Truvia. It turned out great!. I also dusted it with cinnamon, but that was more to complement the almond flavor of the milk.

Very good and easy pudding recipe. I followed the advice of some reviewers by using an extra tablespoon of cocoa and less cornstarch. I added a pinch of cinnamon to the cocoa, as I find it enriches the flavor, and at the end, when I added the butter and vanilla, I stirred in a few squares of bittersweet chocolate. Will make again.

Fast and simple! I decided to leave out the butter, and it came out perfect. Not to thin and just the right thickness. Taste great. I also added an extra tablespoon of sugar for more sweetness.

Easy, delicious, and fairly quick! I used 1% milk because that was all I had on hand. It thickened up before the mixture ever reached a boil. I will definitely be making this again, although I'd substitute half and half for some of the milk, or use whole milk for an even richer taste.

I can't believe I used to buy cook n serve or instant pudding. This recipe is PERFECT! It's so creamy. Sometimes I use the dark chocolate powder by Hershey. It's really luxurious if I whip up some cream, sugar, and vanilla and drop a big dollop on top. It's so fast and easy and satisfies my need for chocolate on short notice.

I have made this recipe several times with only two modifications.  I use almond milk since I don't drink cow's milk and I use brown sugar since I never seem to have white sugar. I got tired of always having to look the recipe up so  I finally decided to save time by mixing a large batch of the dry ingredients together so I have my own pudding mix. I altered the number of servings on the site to figure out how much of each ingredient to mix. When I am ready to make pudding I just add 2/3 cup of dry ingredients to a pot and 2 cups of milk to the pot.  This is a slightly smaller amount than the 4 serving recipe listed here.  It is about 2 cups of pudding. Works great everytime.  The leftovers are great cold but I prefer warm chocolate pudding.

I have never made homemade pudding. This was easy & delicious! I used brown sugar instead of white. Cooked over medium heat, stirred constantly with a whisk until bubbly & thick. Turned out perfect LOVE!

OK, so this recipe has ruined me from buying store-bought puddings, unless I have to in a pinch. :) This recipe was GREAT!! And NO added preservatives or food colorings!!! I did what other reviewers suggested and added more cocoa than the recipe calls for. It still was not as chocolate-y as I would like it... I added about 3/4 tablespoon more than the recipe called for. (I think I will add more cocoa next time!) It was not very sweet, but it was sweet enough, to be sure. My husband really likes chocolate pudding and he said that this was GREAT! The only thing is that when the pudding is warm it was a little bit too rich tasting.... It is not as rich when it is cooled down. I give this recipe 5 stars. Thank you Kelly!! :)

Great recipe!  I was worried about it being too thin so I used only 2-1/4c milk and added 1/2c heavy cream.  Turned out beautifully.  Be sure to constantly scrape the sides, and bottom, of the pan to prevent burning, and use a nice even heat.  

I'm also going to reccomend adding 2tsp of instant espresso powder to make it a mocha pudding!

This is simplicity at its finest!  Who says dessert needs to be complicated?  I followed this exactly, using heaping tablespoons of cocoa to ensure extra chocolatey-ness.  I don't understand how anyone has a problem with it being runny- patience and a good whisk is all it needs to get beautifully thick and creamy :)  As I was enjoying a bowl, I had what I consider to be a stroke of genius (I will leave it to you to determine what that says about my level of intelligence...) : I will use the lidded cups from my yogurt machine to package up this delightful treat into perfectly portioned and portable single size servings!!!  Fantastic recipe Kelly, and I thank you for sharing it :)

I made this recipe with whole milk, and used 1 3/4 squares of unsweetened chocolate baking squares because I did not have any cocoa powder. This recipe was INSANELY good. It is now my husband's favorite dessert.

This is a great, simple recipe. After trying this I don't see the point of using "instant pudding". The ingredients are things I have on hand. I strongly recommend this recipe.

Per suggestions, used 3 heaping TBSP of cocoa, used canned evaporated milk measured right from the can, and cut the cornstarch (instead of cutting it in half, I used 3/4 the amount, or about 3 TBSP). Got the lumps out of dry stuff mostly before adding the milk.  It came out very nice and yummy.

This was excellent!!!  I am lactose intolerant so instead of milk I tried Almond Breeze and I doubled the Hershey's cocoa because so many reviews said it needed more.  I microwaved mine in two minute increments, three times, using a wisk in between to mix the pudding, for a total of 6 minutes, then added the butter and vanilla!!  With Almond Breeze it tasted a lot like a nutty candy bar chocolate.  

I then made a batch using So Delicious Dairy Free Coconut Milk.  It seemed way too thin so I added another tablespoon of cornstarch, but whoa la at 6 minutes in the microwave it was very thick but after adding the butter and vanilla it was a very nice consistancy.  Made with the Coconut milk it seemed more like the name brand cook and serve pudding!!

Both work very well for those out there like me that are lactose intolerent!!!!  Making it another choice for a great dessert or when you really need chocolate!!!

My daughter is severely allergic to milk.  I was dismayed when realized that I had accidentally grabbed the wrong box of pudding (with non-fat dry milk) at the store to make her favorite "dirt pudding".  Found this recipe and substituted soymilk and it turned out perfectly!  Passed my taste test (I don't care for soymilk) because I couldn't even tell that it wasn't made with real milk.  Stir CONSTANTLY with silicone spatula otherwise the cornstarch mixture congeals at the bottom of the saucepan.  Be patient, might take at least 10 minutes to thicken when using soymilk.

YUM!!!  So easy and so delicious...used skim milk which eased the guilt over the HEAPING Tbsp. of cocoa I put in.  Very rich and smooth.  Next plan is to increase by 1/2 for a pie.

Delicious!  I wanted to make a banana pudding recipe but having all chocolate lovers in the house, decided to try this recipe!  all I can say is I will never waste money on box pudding again!  I added the pudding to a pan lined with vanilla wafers and sliced banana and am waiting for it to cool before refrigerating but my daughter was liking the pan clean!  (ok, and I had a spoon too! yummy!) I stuck to the recipe as written and it was perfecit, not too sweet and lots of chocolate yumminess.  I plan to add some whipped topping when I serve it instead of the classic merangue.  Can't Wait!

All I can say is... delicious!! So much better than the boxed instant that I'm used to. I used skim milk and left out the butter to try to make it healthier. It turned out great.

Oh, so much better than the box kind!  I also put some in the freezer and it made great fudgepops.  I boiled it just a bit longer as another reviewer recommended and it was perfect.  I will add a bit of cayenne to it next time.

I only rated this recipe 4 stars because I didn't quite follow the recipe. I truly wanted choc. pudding and I didn't have cocoa powder so I used choc syrup and some choc melting discs instead. It tastes great and I think it will taste better when I follow the recipe with the powder. Then I can give it 5 stars with a clear conscience and judge the actual recipe not my substitute. Did I say how delish it was...Fab-oo-lus!

Old fashioned, simple goodness. So easy and incredibly delicious. I find the most important element is to be patient and stir constantly and you get a smooth, creamy pudding every time. I add an extra tablespoon of cocoa because I am a true choco-holic and it comes out fine!

This was the first homemade chocolate pudding recipe I have tried, and it is amazing!!!  I have used it over and over and everyone who has had it, love it! I like to use it for chocolate pudding pie, too.  If you want to make it healthier, you can reduce the butter and use skim milk, and there's not too much of a difference.  You can also add some protein powder (preferably chocolate) and then you have a lower fat, higher protein version.

Awesome recipe...simple!   My son can't have dairy or anything processed with nuts so I was able to use soymilk, cocoa powder and smart balance and it was completely delicious and safe for him to enjoy! I added a little cinnamon too. Thank you so much!

Made changes as follows: used dark cocoa (heaping tablespoons), half brown sugar and half white, used half table cream and half milk.  This is a richer, more chocolaty pudding... if your are gonna have dessert it might as well be delicious!!:)

Not very chocolatey for my taste.  It did work very well for a pie filling.  I added one egg yolk at the end along with the butter and vanilla and it set sliceable for a custard pie.  Next time I would melt in some chocolate and increase the cocoa.

This year we are staying home for Thanksgiving and not going to my inlaws---the only thing my husband asked for was homemade chocolate pudding pie like his moms---her recipe calls for egg yolk---I opted for this recipe over hers and just got done making it---IT IS AMAZING!!!  Just like my mother in laws with no egg---now I hope there will be enough leftover tomorrow to fill the pie because my family cannot stop eating it(it is still warm)---the only change I made to the recipe was I used half and half in place of milk and I warmed it to speed the pudding process along

My ten-year-old daughter made this.  I couldn't eat much since I can't eat corn, but what I did taste was really good.  This is what my daughter says:

BEST PUDDING IN THE WORLD.  I have never tasted chocolate pudding that I've liked, but this is just amazing.  It was so creamy and good warm.  I'd rate this a million stars if I could.  Everyone, make this.  It is the best chocolate pudding I've ever had.

It's almost 11:30 p.m.  I didn't have any pudding to fill my cupcakes, so gave this a try.  It is wonderful!  I can hardly wait for it to cool - yes, so I can finish the cupcakes and be done; but also because my husband is eager to try it.  I already tasted it warm - it's super!  And so easy!  Thanks for the recipe!

Oh my chocolatety deliciousness! This was gobbled up before it was even cooled! I didnt realize until later that I forgot to add the last 3/4 c of milk but it didn't matter. I skipped the butter entirely and instead added 1/2 tsp of instant coffee to complement the dark cocoa powder I used. Really though...excellent! My family told me I couldnt make it anymore because it was too good. I then explained that it only had a half cup of sugar and they were amazed! I will make this over and over.

This was a good recipe. It's not as rich as a chocolate pudding made with real chocolate or with eggs, but its still very good. I added a quarter cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips at the end to try to up the richness. Mine set up just fine. For me it was not quite sweet enough, but still, overall, a good recipe and I will make it again. My three-year-old declared it good, too.

I had a hankerin' for chocolate pudding this evening and had no pudding mix.  So I did a search and found this claiming to be the Best ..... NOT!!  I went by the recipe exactly.  It came to a boil, coated the back of a spoon, so I took it off the heat.  But as I stirred it it had not thickened enough so I had to put it in the microwave for a few more minutes.  It never really became "pudding".  As to the taste:  it was WAY too sweet.  I added a little almond flavor which helped only a tad and then I threw in some choco chips which helped only a little.  I WOULD NOT make this again.

That was the best pudding I have ever had.  If only people were more aware as to how these types of things were made and how easy they were, no one would ever buy that gross instant stuff ever again.  Thank you so much for the excellent recipe.

Oh my god! Absolutely yummy pudding. I have never before tried a box chocolate pudding, though I have used cornstarch vanilla pudding out of box before. But I never thought it would be so easy. As another reviewer suggested I used brown sugar and it really tasted like caramel chocolate. I skipped the margarine and didn't miss it. Also I like my pudding creamy so I reduced the cornstarch to just about 2.5 Tbls. It still was a little clumpy on cooling so I think next time I am gonna make it 2 Tbls. Also I added about 3 0z chocolate chopped to  the pudding when it was hot. 

I give it 4 stars because with 1/4th cup cornstarch its gonna become a pudding cake. And I don't think pudding should be that thick. 

But otherwise its an awesome recipe. Best chocolate pudding every. I am even planning on trying out vanilla pudding next time.

This was quite good. I used it to fill a yellow butter cake. I still prefer the cook and serve boxed mix over this recipe, but it is good to have around in case I don't have any jello boxes at home.

Absolutely wonderful!  Love that I can make this easily from what's most often in the cupboard/fridge!  We use 2% milk in ours, which I think makes it a more calorie-friendly, calcium-rich treat.  I can see where some would want to add more cocoa powder to get a more intense chocolate taste, but as the recipe is written, it's still yummy!

This pudding tasted delicious. So surprised at how much better a from scratch pudding can be compared to the taste of a box instant mix. Will never be buying a mix again as this recipe was so easy to make that it wasn't even funny. 10 minutes MAX, and that includes prep/cooking times. Mine is in the fridge chilling right now. Although I've only made it once so far (bet your bottom dollar I'll be making it plenty of times over again) I'll just suggest one tip, when the recipe says stir constantly when it's boiling (or even slightly before then actually), STIR CONSTANTLY, the mixture sticks to the bottom of the pan easier than anything I've ever seen. You don't have to stir quickly but stir constantly as 15 seconds of not stiring can probably be disastrous. I halved the recipe as I was only making some for myself but added 1 1/2 T of extra cocoa as I like my pudding extra chocolaty but that's just to my particular taste. Also I used 2 % milk and it turned out fine.

The best pudding I have eaten in years.  I can't believe it doesn't have egg.  It was thick and very creamy.  It would be perfect as a pie filling.  I made a double batch the first time.  The second time I made a 4x batch so that I would have enough to last for a few days.  I sent a small bowel over to my neighbor. My family scarfed it down and the neighbor lady came over the next day for the recipe.

Excellent.  I made mine with skim milk and Splenda to save carbs and calories.  One recommendation is to whisk all dry ingredients in a small bowl with a couple ounces of the milk, till smooth, then add to the pot of cold milk, and whisk continuously on med heat till it just boils.  Then remove from heat and pour into serving bowls.   Cover with plastic wrap and chill if you decide not to eat warm.  If you prefer not to have a 'skin' place plastic wrap directly on the surface and when you take it off-no skin!  Enjoy!

The recipe is the perfect balance of chocolate and cream. I made this recipe the first time several months ago. The consistancy was lumpy. This time when I made it, I whisked it the entire time and it was smooth as silk.

Simply fabulous!  I was out of instant chocolate pudding mix, so I thought I would give this a try, since I had all of the ingredients on hand.  It is so easy and delicious!  I did use heaping tablespoons of cocoa powder, but that was the only change that I made.  Simply perfect!

This is absolutely the best!  We prefer a cooked pudding and this is terrific. I like to add a 1/2 tsp of espresso powder to the mix for a little kick.

I boiled for five minutes and it was still thin, I was looking for something a little thicker than the reviews lead me to believe this was. However it tasted good and had the right amount of chocolate. It went from measuring spoon to tummy in under 20, certainly cannot complain about that. Kids and hubby thought it was good too. If you want tasty homemade taste and not elegant, fancy restaraunt stuff this is a great recipe. I have added it to my recipe box and will certainly make again and again. I will experiment to get it thick though. It is not as thick as Jello brand (tastes much better though). Thank you for sharing this recipe with us, Kelly.

Pretty good and turned out well.    I have scorched pudding before so I started the burner at 5 and then once the pudding was slightly thickened I turned it to 3 to thicken the rest of the way.  I also made sure to stir this pudding the entire to time cooking also to avoid scorching.  Whisking the dry ingredients with the milk well also stopped them from settling to the bottom.  At first I thought it wasn't thick enough, but after about 6 hours in the fridge it was perfect.  Plan to use in a chocolate cream pie.  Thanks for submitting!

I added a dash of cinnamon and 2 teaspoons of instant espresso once the milk mixture was hot (so that it would dissolve)  It made the recipe that I already loved seem a little bit fancy.  I learned from my favorite food network gal that cinnamon and coffee really bring out the flavor of chocolate, and I agree!

Easy, classic pudding recipe. I use almond milk to cut down on the carbs. Tip to others, make a paste with the cornstarch, cocoa, sugar/salt and cold liquid first, adding more liquid as you blend. The cornstarch and cocoa will clump up otherwise, no matter how much you blend it. THey need to be mixed into a cold liquid first.   The cocoa quality really does matter, use Dutch processed if you can. The bad reviews re: chocolate taste probably used cheap cocoa.   If I don't have cocoa on hand I'll use chocolate chips instead (added to warming pudding, stirring constantly and cut back on the sugar.

I didn't have enough milk, so I used fat free half and half and it turned out really rich and creamy.  I used heaping teaspoons of cocoa, but next time I might try dark cocoa.  Overall very good and comforting.  Will definitely make again.

(and a 1/2)  If you're having trouble w/lumps, might I suggest the following: whisk together dry ingredients as directed. Then prior to putting on the heat, S-L-O-W-L-Y whisk in the milk... a little bit at a time (kinda like when you're making a roux). The "thick mass" thrashing around in the pot will eliminate all the lumps!

Tastes just like the pudding I loved as a kid, but isn't sold in stores anymore. I used heaping tablespoons of chocolate, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. This is a keeper.

This is SO good. It is very smooth and creamy. I used half skim milk and half evaporated milk to make it a little more creamy. I also grated some dark chocolate candy squares into it to make it more chocolatey. The next time I make this I'll probably double the cocoa to get that nice rich chocolate flavor.

I followed PLAYKITTENPIE's alterations (use brown sugar, up the cocoa to 3 heaping tbsp, decrease cornstarch to a little over 2 tbsp). I think next time I'll use a little less cocoa - it was a tad strong for me. I doubled the vanilla because we buy imitation, and I also added in the last few drops of (imitation) coconut extract and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Divvied it up into 5 parfait glass and they look beautiful! Once they cool, I'll top them with homemade whipped cream - "Whipped Cream," submitted by MOOZOGASSIR.

Definitely my favorite chocolate pudding recipe.  For variety, try adding miniature marshmallows to the serving bowl and pour the hot pudding over them.  I would highly recommend using butter in the recipe, not margarine.

This pudding is absolutely perfect, to say the least! It has a very raw chocolate taste to it, akin to the difference between store bought hot chocolate and homemade hot cocoa, this being the latter. I only had non-fat milk on hand, other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I was worried about over/under cooking it but I followed the advice of waiting till it coats a metal spoon, then cooked it a little more because it still looked runny. It does thicken upon standing, though. When I popped it in the microwave the next morning, it was as if I had just made it: still perfect. The only difference being that directly from the fridge it looked a little grainy, probably because of the non-fat milk. I have an aversion to undercooked eggs, so much so that it doesn’t matter how cooked they are, the outcome has to be absolutely solid for me to eat it; the cornstarch is genius. I won’t ever buy pudding again.

This recipe was QUICK, EASY, and FABULOUS!!  The only change I did was swap the cocoa and cornstarch measurements to 1/4 cup Cocoa and 3 TBSP cornstarch.

Easy, good!  Using the suggested cornstarch does make quite a thick pudding.

When I make this right it tastes better that the packaged Jello pudding cups I used to binge on in college. Listen to all of the top rated reviewer's suggestions- good stuff, and I know cause I've made this about half a dozen times already.

My daughter and I just made this and it is wonderful! 
Changes made: Took suggestions from another reviewer and replaced white sugar with brown. Also, heaped the tablespoons of cocoa. 
Also: I used one can of evaporated milk and the rest was whole milk. 
I put the dry ingredients through a fine mesh sieve and there wasn't ONE lump! It is perfectly elegant, rich, and smooth!

My pudding was runny, so I decided to put it back on the stove, and add more cornstarch. I forgot to mix the cornstarch first with some milk, so I got lumps. I put the pudding through a sieve.
Also I put in a piece of dark chocolate (72 % cacao) and it made a huge difference! Good chocolaty flavor. But be careful then it won't burn.

This is so easy and sooo delicious and creamy! I have made it with the evaporated and regular milk and both are delicious. I also have used 3or 4 squares of baking chocolate instead of the cocoa. You won't make the boxed stuff again!

Excellent taste and texture.  Exactly what chocolate pudding should be.  Very easy to make even for those who are recipe challenged.  To those who complained of runny pudding, here's a tip:
When cooking with cornstarch, if you must taste, use a clean spoon for each tasting.   Never put the spoon back in the pot after it has been licked.  Digestive enzymes found in your saliva will break down the cornstarch.  Incidently this is also true for Cool Whip.  Thanks Kelly.

I was having a serious craving for chocolate pudding but was too lazy to go to the store.  So I did a search on allrecipes and this recipe came up.  Who knew pudding was SO EASY to make from scratch?  It was ready in 5 minutes and the recipe calls for simple ingredients that are on hand in most kitchens.  I used the "mocha powder" from Starbucks in lieu of cocoa powder and it was delicious!!!  The pudding is thick, not too rich, and very creamy.  I will never buy the boxed stuff again.

This is really good! Quick and easy to make. I'm glad I found it, I've been dissapointed with Jello's instant pudding for awhile now. It did take longer that I had expected for it to set up all the way. Yummy none the less!

This is great pudding! It is easy to make, and if you rewarm it in the microwave it looks and tastes like freshly made. (BTW, I think the carb count is off on the nutritional information.)

Yummy!  I just made this recipe to satifsy a real chocolate craving, and I love how quick and easy it is!  I didn't have any cornstarch, so I used flour, and it worked great.  It did have a slightly different flavor, but still VERY good.  This one is going in my recipe box.

I really liked this. The only thing I did differently was to put 6 semi-sweet chocolate chips in with the margarine. That gave the pudding a nice, smooth flavor & took that little "bite" that the cocoa taste can sometimes have out of it. Thanks for a yummy recipe !

I made this recipe for the grade school where I cook.  The kids absolutely loved it! They told me "Make this recipe more often!"  I did substitute 1/2 of the white sugar for brown sugar as was suggested by another review.  It had a very creamy texture and an absolutely wonderful chocolatey taste!  While the pudding was cooling I did lay Saran Wrap directly on top of it to prevent the "skin" from forming on it.

This is a creamy and very chocolaty pudding. Way better than the boxed variety! Very simple too other than all the stirring but the time is so worth it in the end. I used a whisk to stir and used 3/4 cup sugar instead of 1/2c. b/c I like sweet puddings but it is not even as sweet as boxed pudding w/ the extra sugar.
Delicious and my search for the best chocolate homemade pudding is over!

Requires a little more work than the stuff in a box but it's well worth the trouble.  This pudding has a nice cocoa flavor, not too sweet and tastes homemade.  Doesn't taste like it came out of a box.

for the health conscious- substituted vanilla soy milk; cut back a smidgen on the sugar and cocoa, halfed the butter and omitted the vanilla. not bad, and not too unhealthy either- although the untamed tongue may demand the full amount, if not a little bit more, of the sugar.

Good-bye Jell-O, hello homemade!  I really liked this!  I will try 3/4 cup sugar next time as another reviewer suggested.  This was my first attempt at homemade pudding, and I really don't think it gets any easier than this!  Thanks for Sharing this recipe!

The recipe was very easy and actually pretty quick.  I'm a little impatient so I turned the heat on the stove up to med-high to hurry it up, but it still turned out perfect.  NO LUMPS!  
It tastes very good and has the perfect thickness for an eclaire or cream puff filling.  This is my new pudding recipe from now on.  My kids loved it and even my very picky dh loved it!  Thanks so much Kelly and tell your mom she's a GREAT cook! :)

I ran out of milk so I had to estimate dry milk. i also like less sugar to chocolate so I used 1/4 cup sugar instead of 1/2 cup. Thickened well!  Would be better with powder sugar on top.

This is a delicious chocolate pudding. I've been making this recipe and using frozen goat milk (since I have goats that aren't producing right now). It works wonderfully. Since making it the first time, I've reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup and increased the cocoa to 4 tbsp. I also like it with more vanilla and double the salt but it isn't necessary. If you want to make a sturdier pudding like for pie or if you just want it decadent like me then you can add a couple egg yolks as well. Whisk them with a little milk and stir them in when the pudding starts to thicken. If you do that, be sure to hold (and stir) it at a boil for at least 90 seconds to neutralize an enzyme in the yolk that breaks down starch. Otherwise you'll have muddy puddles in your pudding.

I cut the sugar in half and used brown sugar
also to prevent clumping I used electric hand mixer for a minute and made it very smooth. Thank you.

I needed a chocolate custard filling to put between layers of a cake.  This was perfect, because it wasn't  quite as thick after cooling as a pudding cooked with egg would have been.  Very easy to make.

Absolutely delicious, reminds me of my Great Grandmothers. Only changes I made were to use 3 heaping tablespoons of cocoa since I like it very chocolatey and only 2 rounded tablespoons of cornstarch for a thinner pudding. Whisk periodically as it cools to avoid a skin forming on top & if there are any leftovers place plastic wrap directly on top of the pudding before putting in the fridge to avoid more skin. My brother loved the pudding "skin" though, so to each his own!

I just made this. It was effortless. I'm gonna give this SIX STARS. I LOVE pudding. Followed directions exactly. Thank you for this awesome recipe. I will not buy pudding anymore. Seems like "loved it" would leave a higher star rating than "liked it". WE LOVED THIS EXCELLENT RECIPE

We love this pudding! Very chocolatey and you may want to double it! It takes forever to boil though and I always end up turning it on a 7 or so. I'm making it again as a chocolate pie filling now. Yum!!

I love this recipe and have made it several times as written. I do recommend using a whisk rather than a spoon to ensure a smooth pudding. I like to serve it chilled in pretty glasses with a dollop of cream and a shaving of dark chocolate.

Easy and incredible! We are dairy-free, so we used almond milk and it set up beautifully. Took the advice of others and cooled a bit before refrigeration. Kids licked the bowls! I licked the whisk :-)

Mmmm chocolate. Super easy alternative to the nasty store bought puddings. My four year old and I got down on this! We ate it warm and then later when it was chilled I tried some again and it had a little graininess and lumps but it was probably due to the cornstarch and/or something I did wrong. Still tasted good though! I'll make again

Delish!  I rounded the Cocoa up to 1/4 cup, it was just easier to measure. I also tossed in a handful of chocolate chips with the milk, so this was good and chocolate-y. Poured it into 4 dessert bowls, very pretty!

I make this almost every weekend! I just made it with Almond Milk for the first time and it was even a little richer. (we make our own vanilla so that is always a treat to add) So simple, so easy. I cannot bring myself to buy it at the store anymore. With or without whipped cream, I like it any way.

Boom.  This is good as is but add a little cream in place of some of the milk and it's on an entirely different level.  Thanks Kelly!

If you need a quick hit of chocolate pudding, it doesn't get any easier than this! Tasty, chocolatey and creamy all in one. For those who found it very thin, trying using whole milk -- and make sure you cook it long enough, as per the instructions. Perhaps that's part of what didn't work out? In any case, I used only 2% milk and it came out creamy and perfect, the first time.

rich, yummy and easy- my kind of recipe! 
I didn't have enough milk on hand, so subbed with vanilla and some choco milk- turned out great! my family likes it warm off stove top. 

so many possibilities, experimenting with different types of milk, splashes of alcohol and fruit peels, fun!

This needs more chocolate. Not a lot more, maybe a couple of tablespoons. My main problem was that it was thin and runny. More like a sauce - good for dipping. I followed the recipe exactly. The trick must be in allowing it to boil and then thicken a bit, while stirring off and on. I think the directions that state, "until it coats the back of the spoon" is subjective. Maybe I took it off the stove too early. I'll try it again. I think it's worth a try.

This was a really quick chocolate pudding that tasted great. I made it the first time as the recipe was written and the second time I used soy milk (because hubby cannot have dairy). I used a little less sugar with the soy milk as it is sweeter than regular milk, but both times it tasted great, and you really couldn't tell the difference between the milk and soy versions. Will be making this a lot more!

I used to use a recipe that had the extra step of mixing cornstarch and milk and adding that in.  The measurements are all the same and this was much easier to make.  It's thickening up nicely and smells good.  I did take a taste, mandatory, and it is very good.  I'll make this from now on.  I've always made puddings from scratch.  I do often cut back to do half sugar and half splenda on occasion.

The texture and consistency of this was perfect.  It wasn't quite chocolatey enough for my chocolate-loving husband though, so I melted a few chunks of a chocolate bar into it after it was finished cooking.  It turned out great!

i was pleasantly surprised with the outcome of the pudding recipe. i've never made pudding from scratch or even from a box so i was a bit hesitant about even attempting this recipe. but then the pudding cravings hit...i had no cocoa powder on hand so i just made vanilla pudding---very tasty and has almost the exact texture of pudding you buy at the store. this will definitely be my 'go to' dessert recipe. (update: my only complaint is lumps)

I had an entire gallon of milk that was about to expire, so decided to make some pudding to use it up.  Didn't have a lot of ingredients on hand, so used this recipe as a base with a few substitutions that I don't think impacted the overall result. Followed the recipe but substituted a slightly heaping 1/4 cup of chocolate chips for the cocoa powder and butter, and reduced the sugar to a heaping 1/4 cup.  I was really surprised at how good this tasted!  Taste was great, but gave it 4 stars for the consistency.  I think using cornstarch as the thickener causes the pudding to have a jelly-like consistency (It jiggles when you shake it, for example).  That's not what I think of when I think of pudding.  If you can look past that, the flavor and mouth texture are good.

This is the third time  I have tried this recipe and it works flawlessly. I use solid cooking chocolate, not cocoa powder. And for those people who have it come out thin, maybe you should try full-cream whole milk, if you aren't already. Overall, great dessert and super-easy to make.

I made this for a large group and tripled the recipe.  It still came out just perfect - creamy and chocolatey.  It's a keeper.  A bonus is the low cost to make!

A wonderful pudding. I personally do not use cornstarch, instead I use spelt flour and it turns out great every time.

Easy.  I added extra chocolate to suit taste.  Also, when adding the vanilla, I added a bit of dried espresso to deepen the chocolate flavor.

Husband felt loved eating warm homemade pudding for dessert.

This was the best chocolate pudding I've ever had. My 4 and 5 year old and my husband loved it too! It's so indulgent and creamy! Just like mom used to make; Definitely a keeper!  Thank you for a great recipe!

I lost most my recipes when I moved and my dad found my pudding cups and started hinting by leaving them out...and then buying a huge box of cornstarch. So I started looking for a base recipe and this one is great.  I makeep a lot of pudding on demand from my family because they won't stand there and stir it. My dad  isn't one to like a lot of sugar, I normally put less sugar and more coco plus I made a double batch. So I put about 1 1/3 of sugar and nearly double the about of coco to make it more bitter, and a tad extra vanilla.  It was perfect and mostly likely will be gone when I wake up tomorrow.

Delicious! I used brown sugar instead of white sugar, and I used heaping tbsps of special dark cocoa and I used creamer and water for the last 3/4 of liquid because I ran out of milk after 2 cups. Anyway It's awesome!! Well it's still cooling but it tastes yummy!

Almost instant gratification with this recipe but it cooled quickly enough to dive right in! I also like that it uses no eggs.  I had dark brute cocoa powder for a darker chocolate flavor.  Will no doubt make this again. (so good to use as a dip for bananas and orange segments, pineapple too!)

I have to comment on this one! Pudding sounds so simple, and this one is a snap to put together, but the flavors & smooth texture sets it apart. I make this at least once a week (or more). Only changes for personal taste, is I only use 1.5 Tablespoons cocoa (I know ... what??) but I prefer it to be a lighter chocolate flavor. I've also used brown & white sugar 1/4 c each. The key is to combine it as suggested, on the stove so you can whisk away while cooking it! Cook until it really coats the back of that spoon, mine usually lightly boils for 1 minute or so. Whisk the whole time. Add the butter & vanilla at the end and this is a winner!

I used 3 heaped tablespoons of cacao and found the pudding rich and chocolatey.  This recipe has become a family favourite.  I have made it around 10 times since discovering it.  Yum!  Update:  I must have made this pudding a dozen times but tonight I was a bit short on the cornstarch and I noticed that the pudding was very thin.  I hope it's all right.  :-(  Follow-up Update: Pudding turned out delicious just the same!  I LOVE THIS RECIPE!

Love, Love, Love this recipe. Yes, make sure it comes to a boil, yes, add a little extra cocoa and cornstarch if you want it thicker. Amazing and as easy as boxed but 100% better!

I followed someones advice and used a little less than 1/4 cup cornstarch and it was perfect. Also used 3 heaping tablespoons cocoa. I also added about 1/3 cup semi sweet chocolate chips to give it a richer chocolate flavor right before taking off heat.

I made this recipe exactly as stated and it wasn't very good. Very runny even though I cooked it for a long time. Taste was just bland. Don't understand what I did differently than everyone that gave it such a high rating.

Yum yum yummy yum yay! I am sitting at 11,500 ft. eating chocolate pudding and dancing around. I'm preparing a presentation on global warming and freaking out about talking in front of all of these NGO's and needed some comfort food. I had to use cocoa paste instead of powder and didn't use butter (neither item is in my local store). I used about 100g of cocoa paste and skim milk. When I added the milk, the pudding seemed to thicken in less than 2 minutes, just BOOM it was done, insta-pudding! So delicious and exactly the warm comfort I needed.

So easy - and to be quicker, mix it in a pyrex pitcher, cook it in the microwave, 2 minutes and stir with a whisk, repeat, stir, and then 1 minute at a time til it's rich and creamy. For my microwave it took just 7 minutes.   Add the vanilla and butter and you're done!

For flavor I would give this a full five stars.  I really did enjoy it.  I even liked it warm.  It is a very think pudding, though.  I dropped it a star for that.  It was far too think for my taste.

When I made it, something went wrong and now I have a syrupy goop. Good flavor but I had to use a Dutch oven rather than a medium saucepan.

Made this this am exactly as written. It's been in the fridge for 4 hours and it is soup. Will not make again.
Update: took it out of fridge and reboiled with 2 egg yolks added. Thicker...maybe more like pudding now. Keeping fingers crossed.
Update again: tastes good but still not pudding consistency.

I was interested in making pudding but didn't have any in a box.  Boy am I glad I didn't.  This is better than any boxed pudding and so worth the effort.  I read other reviews first.  So, I put all my dry ingredients in a bowl and stirred them all together, then added to the dry pan and stirred a bit till some of the sugar melted. I added 3/4 cup of milk to dry ingredients in pan and stirred with a slotted wooden spoon.  Once all the ingredients combined, I added the rest of the milk and stirred.. Wah-la. No lumps.

This is the recipe my Mother and Grandma used.  I used a 1/4 cup of Stevia and 1/4 cup sugar and used skim milk in mine to make it healthier and it turned great!  Thanks for posting

Couldn't find my recipe for "hasty pudding" and picked this one to try - so glad I did!  I added a dash of cinnamon (my personal chocolate flavor enhancer of choice) and even though I made a double batch, I had no leftovers.  (My fiance had THREE bowlfuls!)  Cornstarch pudding is one of the simplest, fastest chocolate desserts you can make and this recipe is pretty foolproof - as long as you get to a FULL boil you will have perfect, silky pudding in no time.

This pudding is fantastic! It is my number one favorite snack to make for my mother, because she is very underweight and needs to take in more calories but she doesn't have much of an appetite.  She really likes this one, though!

It is great as is. Exactly like a Jello pudding cup. I then doubled the cocoa and vanilla, and I think that it is awesome.

I adjusted the recipe to serve 6 and I used Splenda and reconstituted powered skim milk. I did add the butter and vanilla. For a diet pudding it was quite good.

This recipe is delicious as is, or with a bit more cocoa powder! The instructions are simple enough, but I have found that it does take 10-20+ minutes to bring to a boil over medium heat. Just for planning purposes. It cools down quickly in the fridge and develops a thick skin over thinner pudding.

This is just an absolutely wonderful pudding recipe. I had never made pudding before, but it came out perfectly and tasted delicious the very first time! It has a beautifully rich chocolate flavor and comes out at the perfect consistency. I have now made it several times, and my partner and his son love it! It's a very easy recipe and doesn't take much time or effort, which also gives it a boost in rating for me. I usually stick pretty close to the recipe, but lately, I've been adding a tablespoon or two of chia seeds during cooking for added protein, fiber and healthiness. It turns out a lot like tapioca pudding and doesn't affect taste at all.

Very simple but very tasty!  Easy and consistent enough to tweak it to suit.  I put a handful of chocolate chips in it to kick up the chocolate factor.  Hubby and I both loved it.  This recipe will fill 4 ramikins.  When I was a kid, sometimes we'd get fancy and chill it in wine glasses then top with whip cream right before serving.  Tres elegant!

Turned out great! I used essentially the same proportions (a bit more cocoa powder and a bit less cornstarch). I thought because I only had 1% milk it wouldn't work out, but it was fine. The helpful advice to make sure to continue stirring over heat after it comes to a boil--until it really looks like pudding--, to then put the pan in some ice water while stirring to cool, and finally use saran wrap to cover right on top of the pudding really worked. It was even fine the next day.

I have not eaten chocolate pudding for years.  I found this recipe today and it is wonderful!  It's easy, creamy, and yummy.  I made it exactly as written except for rounding the tablespoons of cocoa.  I like dark chocolate.

I made this recipe as written with no substitutions or alterations and it came out just fine. The flavor and creamy consistency of the pudding is worth a solid four-plus stars but I gave it five stars overall because of the simplicity of the recipe, and I value simplicity especially when the results are this good. I used a whisk first to combine the dry ingredients and then to incorporate the milk until the mixture came to a boil. I finished cooking the pudding with a metal spoon so I could see how it coated the spoon, then used the whisk again to blend in the butter and vanilla. I used Hershey's "Special Dark" cocoa and while it was quite delicious, I agree with another reviewer who said this pudding is only as good as the cocoa. While I like Special Dark for making brownies, I'm eager to try this recipe again using a better quality cocoa. Update: I made this pudding with Droste (Dutch Processed Unsweetened Cocoa Powder) and the result was near perfection! Droste will be my "go to" cocoa from now on.

This was very yummy.. I wanted it for a pie so I made a few changes.. You can add 1tsp of Cinnamon. I also did Brown sugar instead of White, I heaped the cocoa powder like one lady suggested and I did a 1/2 cup of Cornstarch instead of the 1/3C. It was really yummy.. I will make this again. Thank you for sharing..

Made this with soy milk for my daughter due to a dietary restriction and it was perfect! From start to finish it took me less than 5 minutes. This recipe is very basic, so you really notice the quality (or non-quality) of your cocoa powder. I used a high-quality Dutch process cocoa and it was amazing! :)

This is yummy, and will curb your chocolate craving. I used unsweetened rice milk, and added a teaspoon of instant coffee granules to bring out the chocolate flavor even more.... very delcious hot, warm or cold, I tried it all three ways. Very smooth, with just the right amount of chocolate!

Tried this after dental surgery and could not stop eating it! I am never buying Jello again. Only changes I made was adding one extra tablespoon of cocoa powder and add a mix of half-and-half and almond milk (didn't have regular milk at home). Thanks, Kelly, for this fantastic recipe.

This pudding is so good, it blows boxed mixes out of the water.  I thought the sweetness was just right.  I put mine in popsicle molds and made fudgesicles for my grandson, nothing artificial, just yummy goodness.

Inedible. Followed to a T and what resulted was in no way a chocolate pudding. It formed a weird plastic like coating on top and all you tasted was corn starch - no chocolate.

I pour the hot mixture into paper cups for individual servings. Some of my kids find it too rich for their palates, so they often don't eat too much at one sitting, although they love it. Serving in paper cups also allows me to control how many servings they get, and that everyone gets an equal share. TIP: to balance out the richness and sweetness of the pudding, serve cooled with a tablespoon of UNSWEETENED whipped cream. This is an excellent recipe, particularly because it is so tasty and so easy to make.

My mother made many a dessert with Hershey's cocoa back in the 50s and 60s and this was one of them. (You've got to try Hot Chocolate from scratch - the bomb!). No need to change a thing on this receipe. Some people suggest putting plastic on top to prevent the "film" from forming. Seriously? That's my favorite part!

I was not happy with the thickness of this pudding. Flavor was excellent and if I ever decide to make it again I will add more cornstarch.

This was a great basic recipe. I added 1/4 tsp instant coffee but next time will try 1/2 - 3/4 tsp. Maybe a bit more cocoa. It got super thick for me, no problem at all!! It took awhile to boil but then went perfect. I'll use this as a base recipe and try adding different flavours, next time more coffee, maybe with a touch of cinnamon... Thank you!

I made the recipe as written, but I did decrease the sugar to probably 1/3 cup.  It was very good!  The first night, when I served it still warm, it had a runny but thick texture.  After overnight refrigeration, it held its shape.  Both ways were very good.  When I made it,  I used skim milk.  It would probably be even better with a higher-fat milk.

Super creamy and chocolatey, especially using three HEAPING tablespoons of cocoa!  The recipe is easy enough for my 10 year old daughter to make on her own.  She made 2 batches tonite: one to put into cups for their lunches, and the other we devoured!

Excellent! I love this is recipe it is the closest I have found so far to what my Grandma used to make when I was little. I forgot the salt, and I used flour instead of cornstarch (it's all I had) and it turned out just great.

The ingredients had potential. However the result was something more like the thickness of mashed potatoes the next day. I agree with several of the other posters. There needs to be a cut down on the cornstarch - drastically. Also I saw no benefit of the butter. It never incorporated into the pudding and was just butter swimming in the mass of chocolate. The next day the butter was cooled and each to pick out since it just sit on top and to the sides. I would add the vanilla into the mixture as it was cooking if I ever try this recipe again.

Easy to make and nice chocolate flavor (I think). I got a little bold and decided to add come cayenne pepper (I love spicy chocolate). A quarter teaspoon is too much (It was a bit too spicy and only a little of the chocolate flavor came through). The next time I am feeling adventurous, I will try half that amount of cayenne. I will definitely make this again.

Thanks to tips from past reviewers! I used half brown sugar, half cornstarch for softer texture (not jello-like), boiled for several mins to get rid of cornstarch taste, used half pure vanilla almond silk milk (really yummy)and my own addition of  3/4tsp freeze dried coffee  (read before this intensifies chocolate flavor). YUM, thanks for sharing.

Best homemade chocolate pudding recipe ever!  Made me Queen of the world in my house.  I admit I did make 1 small change.  Since we are VERY DARK chocolate lovers, I added 1/4-1/3 cup 60% cacao chips by Ghiradelli while it was very hot.  YUM!! Will never go back to a box again.  Thanks Kelly!!

So easy and very tasty. Made it for my kids (who loved it) but my husband ended up polishing it off in the middle of the night. I added 3 heaping tablespoons of Cocoa and slightly less than 1/4 cup od cornstarch and it turned out perfectly.

Yum. This is so easy and uses ingredients you have in your pantry. Such a nice quick dessert when you don't plan on anything. I did add about 1/2 Tb extra cocoa. Maybe even more next time! Oh, I added shaved Hershey bar to the top. It added some sweetness, very good.

I made this and my husband and I loved it!  It was so easy.  The colder it gets in the fridge the more the chocolate flavor comes out.  I am thinking of using it for the filling for chocolate cream pie.

You do as you wish but this recipe is good as it is.  It isn't difficult and is much better than pudding purchased in the store.  I use very heaped up tablespoons of cocoa but that is my preference.  Upon cooling you get that lovely pudding "crust" - I double the recipe when I make it as one isn't enough.

Very tasty!  I added cayenne pepper and cinnamon like someone recommended. I didn't have enough corn starch, so I used flour.  I will defiantly be making this again and again.

I've tried several recipes and this was the only one that had a decent flavour.  Like others, I did add a bit more cocoa than it called for.  I will probably make again and it's definitely a good base with which to experiment - and I do love experimenting. :)  Thanks for posting this!

Exactly how good old fashioned chocolate pudding should taste! I increased cocoa to 4 T and served with whipped cream dusted with cocoa powder.

This recipe is quick and easy. Important to note: if you are planning on refrigerating this, DO NOT COVER. Leave it in the fridge overnight uncovered to cool.
Kids loved it!

4 stars for being ingredients that I typically have on hand and so easy to make! I wasn't 100% in love with the flavour, would have liked it to be more rich, but then I think that would require melted chocolate which is something I don't always have on hand. I might try this again but make it vanilla by omitting cocoa powder and upping the vanilla extract.

Four stars when hot. Only three stars cold.

This was a quick and easy chocolate fix. I, too, would add more cocoa as I like a darker chocolate flavor. I ate some right away while it was still hot, and some the next day after it was chilled. The flavor and texture once chilled was only so-so. You could really pick up on the cornstarch.

I will certainly keep this recipe around!

Decided to make on a whim after supper.  I had all the ingredients on hand which was great!  I give this 4 stars.  It had amazing choc flavor!! The only change I made was I only added a little over 1\8 c cornstarch per other suggestions.  It came out great!! It was still smooth pudding a few hrs after chilling in the fridge.  My only complaint which I think is my fault.  Is there were a few clumps & skin pieces but I did step away from the stove & it had burnt a bit on the bottom so next time we'll see if that is resolved by stirring constantly.  Try this!!

I made this last night for a Halloween party. I topped the chilled pudding with chocolate cookie crumbs and gummy worms to make dirt in a cup. Everyone loved it! I really liked how easy this was to make and how all the ingrediants were basic pantry ingrediants that I always have around. The only thing I might do next time is add 1 more tablespoon of cocoa powder to make it a bit more chocolatey. Thanks for the great recipe I will for sure be making this instead of buying pudding mix again.

I doubled the recipe and added a good heaping tablespoon extra of cocoa powder and 1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate chips just to get more of a chocolate flavor. I did everything else as written.  It came out wonderful.

Super tasty! I had a craving for chocolate late at night and this did the trick. I like mine really thick so I let it boil for a minute. So far the best easy pudding I've made.

supremely divine. i did make a minor chance, i wanted a chocolatier taste so i took a handful of semi sweet chocolate chips and heated it in the microwave with the butter, 15 seconds at a time to avoid scorching... and then when the pudding came to a boil i added vanilla and then incorporated it all into the pudding... excellent...

I cook alot but this was the first time I tried to make homemade chocolate pudding. It was a huge hit!! I doubled the recipe and also added a tad more sugar. I followed the advice about it boiling. This will be my new recipe to try out on family and friends so YUMMY!

A great beginning, this pudding tastes good but needs more chocolate.  Also, if you don't like it super thick, just decrease the amount of cornstarch.  I doubled the recipe and didn't change the cornstarch and it set up just like boxed pudding would.

This was tasty and simple to make.  But I'm not crazy about the effort to constantly stir (as is generally expected with pudding).  I tried the Creamy Vanilla Pudding method and that was so easy.  Both recipes taste so much better than a package, but this recipe takes much more standing by the stove.  If I hadn't tried the other recipe I may have rated this a 5.

Just made this and it is delicious.  I used almond milk since we don't use dairy.  Next time I will freeze it in popsicle forms as some reviewer mentioned.

Easy with normal ingredients around the house. Tastes delicious! I sometimes use dark cocoa powder for a stronger flavour, but it's good with anything you have in the cupboard.

Made it exactly as stated and it is really nice, I was a little worried because I've never used cornstarch in this manner and it really tastes just as good as boxed instant or cook and serve pudding and you know exactly whats in it.

This is a simple and delicious recipe.  The first couple of times I tried to cut back on sugar, and while good, it was not quite as good as when I just made it according to the recipe.  With one exception, I reduced the amount of milk to 2 cups to make it thicker, and more chocolatey, and this worked great.  As easy as any packet, and you know there are no nasty chemicals in it.  I may try this with stevia to see if I can get it sugar free, and then it will be PERFECT and diet friendly.

Great, easy recipe. We have people with a milk allergy in my family, so I substituted homemade coconut milk (just shredded coconut plus water in the blender for a few minutes) for the milk and coconut oil for the butter. It had a little bit of a coconut flavor that played nicely against the chocolate. 

I think I will use a little less cornstarch next time. Only use the amount in the recipe if you're going to put the pudding into the serving dishes while still warm. Once the pudding cools with this much cornstarch in it, it gels and won't spread at all when you spoon it into a bowl.

It was good- not over the top- for people who have never made pudding before Its pretty exciting to see how easy it is with this recipe- I did what one reviewer suggested- used brown sugar and less cornstarch- it tasted like thick hot chocolate- something to whip up if you don't have anything for dessert but I wouldn't go out of my way to make it again- just didn't excite me enough

So great!  This took a long time to boil, but we turned up the heat to high for a few minutes and it got thick in no time.  Such a great unexpected taste--I don't think I've ever had "real" chocolate pudding!

This stuff turned out well.  It didn't taste exactly like store-bought, but it isn't.  This pudding is good, though.  It's home-made (and vegan, if you do soy milk)!

All I can say is yum.  Followed the original recipe and turned out great!  I do recommend mixing all the dry ingredients together first or sifting to prevent lumps.

Oh my, this is sooooo good! I've never made homemade pudding before but now I'm glad that I did. Not only is it super easy to make, it tastes a hundred times better than store bought pudding. It was pretty thin when it came off the stove and I was concerned that it wouldn't set, but it got deliciously thick after a few hours in the fridge. I used heaping tablespoons of cocoa powder, so in the end I probably ended up using about 4-5 tbsp and it was very chocolatey. And as long as you keep whisking it the whole time there should not be any lumps.

This is the perfect chocolate pudding recipe!!! I loved it, and so did my husband who happens to be VERY picky about chocolate pudding! :)   The recipe is just fine as is, but in preparing it, I have a couple of tips:   - put the dry ingredient through a sifter before putting into the saucepan.  - after adding the milk, use the back of a spoon or silicone spatula to break up the lumps that will inevitably show up while cooking - whisk the entire time while cooking and bring to a boil  This is fantastic pudding to use in a pie, triffle, or just as an indulgent chocolate snack! LOVE IT!!!

Just made this and it's really yummy.  To keep lumps at a minimum I dissolved the corn starch in some of the milk before adding it to the pan.  I did not have cocoa powder on hand, so used a square of unsweetened Baker's Chocolate.  Chocolate lovers may want to use 2 squares.

My husband and kids liked this and I liked making it from scratch and leaving out all the preservatives that go with boxed pudding.  My only complaint was color and texture.  Color was lighter than box pudding and the texture wasn't as smooth as I'd expect.  It was perfectly smooth while cooking but when I put it in a container to chill it came out with some lumps.

Delicious! And easy. Followed the recipe exactly and couldn't wait for it to thicken; my bowl was gone while still soupy. Soooo good. Update 11/2014: Made this again...it never thickened all the way...but still tasted fabulous.

A little sweet but really good. Very simple if you microwave.

This is a wonderful basic recipe for chocolate pudding. The basic recipe can take a lot of modifications and still it still turns out great, as long as you keep the ratio of cornstarch to liquid constant.  I usually use 1/4 cup of sugar and 4 T of dark cocoa powder for richer chocolate flavor, and the consistency is always perfect.  I've also substituted coffee for part of the milk with great results.  The basic recipe can also be made dairy-free very easily. I've made it with almond milk, and it turned out great-it just needed an extra minute or two of cooking to thicken up.

YUM! I just made this and it was delicious. I fixed it as written and it was very simple and easy to make. I did not time how long it took to thicken, I just continued to stir until it started to boil. We ate some while it was still warm because that's how we prefer it. This is rich but not too sweet and has a flavor similar to dark chocolate. Will definitely make again.

Simple and chocolatey -- who could ask for more? It even thickens up more after it's chilled in the fridge. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!! :)

This was very delicious, so quick & so so much better than pudding from a packet!!!!  The directions do need to be clearer with the  boiling time.  I boiled mine until the mixture was thick enough to coat the spoon, but found that when eating it, it was too runny.  Thanks Kelly for this awesome recipe!!

Best Chocolate pudding Ever. I tried making pudding scratch a long while back, and it failed dismally. This, however, did not. This was the richest chocolatiest chocolate pudding ever. I'm not insane about chocolate unless it's milk, but this was fabulous. The ehat had to be on high for it to start bubbling. I wound up using a  mixture of my lactaid milk, and my brothers regular milk, and a little water, as we were running out of milk everywhere. Delicious! another note: the serving size is more like 4 servings. there are four of us and it went fast.

For other beginners i say try this recipe.  5 stars-followed directions to the T and turned out to be just what i was looking for in a 'scratch' recipe.  For those with lumps i stirred the dry ingredients together-then slowly added the cold milk.  No lumps at all.  Like so many others there will be no more boxed puddings in my cupboard.

Wow. I am on a no-fat low carb diet which I was about ready to give up for the lack of chocolae when I came across this. I make it with fat-free milk and splenda, and skip the butter [sometimes adding flavored syrups for fun], and it is always thick and satisfying. I can only imagine how wonderful it would be as given, since the proportions of ingredients are perfect! Thanks, Kelly!!

Absolutely delicious.  Why would you waste your money on buying the boxed stuff full of unnatural things when pudding is so easy to make and so wonderful?  This recipe is as good as it comes.

Tasty, and very easy.  Make it even quicker by mixing everything except the vanilla and butter in the blender, then pour it in a pot and cook until thick.  My family loved it!

Ok, I use 3 simple and healthy ingredients: milk, cornstarch and sugar, that's it. You don't need salt , vanilla, or butter. You can, also, use lowfat milk if you want. Either way this is a natural and healthy dessert with no added or processed ingredients that you get in store bought pudding. It's a good feeling to know what you are eating and it tastes so good at the same time.

Great recipie. My wife and I enjoyed it very much. Use a whisk to keep it smooth. I used an extra tablespoon of coco. Use a very good coca, I like Green and Black's coca powder. One way we like to use it is to make the pudding up and ladle it warm over vanilla ice cream to make a hot fudge-like  sundae.

Superb and SIMPLE.  I added 1 teaspoon of instant espresso for a mocha twist.  If you haven't yet made, I suggest slowly adding the milk to the dry ingredients, a little at a time, so that you don't have lumps.  Also, I think a whisk is a better utensil choice over a spoon.  I brought mine to a steady low boil before I took it off the heat.

This is the easiest pudding and is REALLY good. I made servings for 8 people, and the pudding was gone within a day of my making it! I think I am going to make a batch right now. I know what is for dessert tonight!!!  P.S. Try putting mini chocolate chips in the pudding on the vanilla-and-butter-adding-stage!

EXCELLENT!  I was looking for a homemade version of chocolate pudding and this one is right on.  The only thing I did differently was I omitted the butter to make it low fat.  I will be passing this recipe on for sure:)

This was great! I think I would prefer add'l cocoa next time, but I dropped a few butterscotch morsels into the pudding before putting it into the refrigerator and it was a nice touch. Will make again.

This brought back nostalgic memories of my Grandma's house.....I did cut back the corn starch but other than that I didn't change a thing.  I think eating it warm with some whipped cream and sprinkle of cinnamon is the best! Thanks for the post.

When I was a kid, my mom made homemade chocolate pudding once a year...when "The Wizard of Oz" came on TV.  It was a special night.  I followed this recipe exactly and it's perfect and tastes just like Mom's.  Well worth the time spent at the stove. Thanks

Just like Grandma used to make. Full of flavor and very creamy. I made a double batch and I am glad I did, it is disappearing fast. And very easy to make. No more pudding from a box for me,this is so much better. Thanks for a great recipe. God Bless.

What the heck did I do wrong here! Our pudding came out tasting like... I don't know, bland. Not really a "mmmm chocolate pudding" taste. The reviews are good so I gave it a three, but it honestly came out like a two. Maybe more cocoa powder?

I made this as a quick midnight snack and it definitely cured my chocolate craving. I upped the amount of cocoa powder and added in a bit more butter to make it extra rich. If I wasn't in such a hurry, I would have sifted my cocoa powder because I ended up with little lumps in my pudding. They were cooked lumps, but I like my pudding smooth. I chilled the leftovers and had some this morning - yummy! Thanks for sharing!

I haven't had scratch pudding in years.  Wow.  I will not be able to go back to the box.  I added a little cinnamon and instant coffee and it really enhanced the depth and richness.

it reminds me of my mother`s pudding . it`s really better than the pudding powder coz it does`t have the weird taste that coming from the preservatives . it`s simple , delicious and cheap, and U can make it lighter using fat free milk and no butter.

yummy!  it is silly how when you grow up having jello instant pudding, you forget that you can just make it yourself.  it tastes better and is really easy.  i used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa, 1% milk and omitted the butter and vanilla.  a nice light dessert.

This recipe is yummy and easy to make.  I did, however, cut the sugar doen to 1/3 cup.  Otherwise it is too sweet for me.  I tried making it in the microwave and it came out just as good.  Cook in microwave for 2 min and stir, cook for another 2 min and stir.  Cook a little more watching for when it starts to boil.  Remove from microwave and stir in butter and vanilla.  Voila!

This was gelatinous and totally unappealing once cooled, and the chocolate flavour was nothing to write home about. If you're looking for a pudding that holds its shape perfectly once out of a mold and don't really care about the flavour, this is it. If you're looking for creamy, chocolatey goodness, keep looking.

I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used brown sugar, and ~1/8 cup cornstarch and it was fantastic.  I like this cornstarch version better than the flour version of Grandma's Old Fashion Pudding.  The thicken process takes a little bit, so be patient, but all of sudden, it goes from liquid to thick!

Love this pudding!!! I took the advice of the reviewer before me and used brown sugar, evaporated milk, and reduced the cornstarch by half. It was wonderful!! The absolute creamiest!! I made a second batch omitting the cocoa and doubling the vanilla and it was a delicious vanilla pudding.

this recipe was flavorful but lumpy. i personally dont like to bite into lumps of bitter cocoa powder. to make the recipe better, i mixed the recipe throughly with a hand mixer halfway during cooking. i also substituted 1 3/4 cup of milk and used heavy cream.

I never really have liked any homemade chocolate pudding I've tried.  It always seemed to bitter.  Not this one!!  This by far is better than any other I have tasted.  My husband and kids literally couldn't eat it fast enough!  I made it exactly by the recipe.  DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING it's perfect just the way it is.  So long boxed pudding, hello homemade.

I ran out of my german pudding mix and then, for the first time, read the ingredients on the package. So, I set out to find a recipe with the same ingredients and this was it. Fabulous. I've made it three times already, double the recipe and fill it in small dishes. To avoid the skin (I love it but my kids don't), I place a piece of saran wrap directly on top of the hot pudding and it works great. A delicious recipe and keeper. Thank you very much.

I was looking for a dessert and didn't have a lot of ingredients on hand - but I had all for this recipe. The best chocolate pudding I've ever had - I don't think I'll ever use a mix again. I had one banana so I made slices and divided it between the four servings. 
Thanks for sharing

I couldn't get the texture right, but this was pretty easy to make and the flavor was YUMMY!

I took some reviewers advice though. Instead of just 1/2 cup of white sugar, I used 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of white sugar to enhance the flavor. I used a little bit less cornstarch, a little more cocoa, and a little less butter.

But I would probably make this again.

Be sure to cook long enough or else the texture will be funky.

Yummy! Love the chocolate flavor of this pudding. It had a nice smooth texture. Yeah me!! But your arm will get tired. I think it took about 4-5 hours to cool in the fridge. So plan ahead if that is what you prefer. I didn't think about that and it wasn't ready for dessert.

WOW!  This pudding is delish!  I did take some advice from other cooks and put in less corn starch.  Maybe 2 TBLS less.  This pudding is now my go to recipe.   
  Make it as the recipe calls for and you won't be disappointed.

This was SOO good! I made it exactly like the recipe and it was yummy. Why buy pudding at the store (especially when you can't pronounce half of the ingredients), when you can make it from scratch at home. My family loved it. Thanks!!

Very easy to make, and very delicious! You might try adding a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon if you like that sort of thing

This is wonderful!It was slightly strong for my taste (not bad though) so i added a good 2 table spoons of thickened cream after it had chilled and then it was absalutly perfect!! My partner lovesss the store bought stuff, so this is fantastic cause it tastes even better! :D

i found myself having to add a small ammount of brown sugar and milk mixed together at the end, just before removing from heat.. i stirred it in and it took away the over thickening i had going on. plus the brown sugar gave it the sweetness it was lacking. Overall its great. It tastes like chocolate pudding :)

Well I took the advice of another review and added more cocoa powder (1/4 c.).  I also decreased the amount of cornstarch to 3 T because I was afraid of it being too gelatinous.  The flavor was good but I ended up with runny pudding.  I'm guessing that I either didn't cook it long enough or that it needed all of the cornstarch.

This was ok. I followed the advice of others who rated the recipe and lowered the   cornstarch and increased the cocoa. Maybe we didn't cook it long enough but it was very loose and even with the extra cocoa wasn't chocolatey enough. Perhaps I will try another version of instant pudding.

To me this has a slightly bitter after taste.  I also used slightly less cornstarch as suggested by others, and it is a little soupy for me.  I might try to make again.

I have always loved cornstarch puddings, and add this suggestion: cook it in the microwave and then you CAN'T scorch it.  

I haven't had a problem with it being too firm the second day (as other reviewers have mentioned), at my house it never lasts for a second day.

In the past couple of weeks since finding this recipe I have made this pudding a total of 6 times and am about to make it a 7th. It is creamy and chocolatey. I use the three "heaping" tablespoons as well. I've also made the vanilla version of this pudding that is just as good. THANKS!

Yummy.  After reading the reviews, I too added more cocoa and cut back on the cornstarch a bit.  This turned out VERY well for such an easy recipe.

I didn't much care for this. The taste was kind of tartly bitter. I think adding more milk will help but that would totally throw off the consistency of the pudding. I might end up having to turn my pudding into a sort of chocolate milk shake.

I really like this recipe, because all the ingredients are already in the cabinet or refrigerator.  The first time that I made it, the pudding was a bit soupy.  I took the pudding off the stove after it had just started boiling and it coated the back of the spoon.  So, the second time, I made sure it boiled for a little longer.  After a day, the pudding turned to jello.

This was a good, easy and quick recipe that I could make with items in my pantry.  It did satisfy my need for a chocolate fix, but I would prefer it to be a bit more chocolatey.  It also left a strange film in my mouth that I attribute to the amount of cornstarch in the recipe.  I will keep searching for a better homemade chocolate pudding recipe.

Update...2nd time I added a 1 oz square of semi-sweet baking chocolate at the end.  Perfect chocolatey-ness!

Made this as a surprise for my husband and son and what a hit!  It was oh so easy and so rich and creamy!  Next time I will add heaping tbs of cocoa, and maybe try evaporated milk.  Hubby was impressed that it was from scratch, much better than boxed instant or cooked.  This is a keeper!

I just finished making this recipe for the very first time, expecting it to taste just like my mom's homemade chocolate cornstarch pudding.  AND IT DOES!!  I'm surprised it didn't take as much time to make as I originally thought it would.  The three "heaping" tablespoons really do make the difference like other cooks have mentioned.  Next time, however, I will try to use either whole milk or evaporated milk since it was a little on the "thin" side.  Otherwise, I am ecstatic regarding the way this turned out and I'm just psyched to tell mom about it.  WOO-HOO!!

My family raved about the chocolatey flavor and I was delighted that it was so easy.  I hid a red cherry in the bottom of each and let the top skin over.  Our family tries to disturb the skin as little as possible as we try to get to the cherry!  Started this tradition as silly kids and we still do it as grown "adults."

I made this last night and followed the recipe exactly. It didn't have enough chocolate flavor and was a tad sweet. I made it again tonight and added a tablespoon and a half more cocoa powder and it tasted much better. The sugar to chocolate ratio seemed more acurate.  Even though it tasted much better than last night, I'm still not too sure that this is "the" recipe...I may keep looking. It is a very easy recipe and it thickens up nicely.

this is so easy and so good! you will never make box chocolate pudding again! if you dont like a skin on the top then use the plastic wrap method. so creamy, so chocolatey, so yummy!!!! keep stirring and dont get tempted to turn up the temperature or it will burn on the bottom of the pan. worth the tiny bit of patience! pure comfort food.

...Great pudding recipe! We celebrated my husbands birthday and he requested a yellow cake with chocolate pudding...no icing...no nuts...no sprinkles or candles....NO FUN!  I baked the yellow cake in a 13x9 dish and while it was cooling made this pudding.  The only changes I made was added 2 big pinches of brown sugar and a handful of mini choc chips.  I poked holes in the cake and poured on the pudding.  Turned out to be really good and best of all hubby said it was exactly what he wanted.  Will be using this recipe from now on... :)

Some friends and I take turns picking up milk from a local dairy.  When I was gathering my jars today I found I had 3/4g of milk to use before my friends came by to pick up my jugs.  I qudrupled this recipe for our family and found the results to be most satisfying.  Velvety smooth and choco-riffic!

Good! A bit "grainy" but not in a bad way (this is how homemade/cornstarch puddings are--they'll never be as smooth as the boxed stuff). Gets runny if there is any left over so plan to eat it that day.

So far the best scratch pudding I have found!  Unforunately, I still like the Jello cook-n-serve better, probably because I was raise on it, but BOY this one is really good too.

This is a fabulous recipe for pudding!  I've made cornstarch pudding before, and it always tasted like cornstarch.  But with this recipe, the pudding tasted so good like brownies and not at all like cornstarch.  Yum!  Thanks for the recipe.  p.s.  Some people said they did not like it with the margarine, but I think it tastes good either way.  With the margarine, it tastes more fudgey.

Boy does this one take me back! Very smooth and thick and creamy, just like MY mom used to make. It's a touch on the sweet side, and it could use maybe a tablespoon more cocoa for my tastes. But all in all, very good! Who the heck needs that instant pudding nonsense?

Needs twice as much cocoa powder and therefor more sugar  and at least a half cup of diluted cornstartch. There are better more chocolately pudding recipes by far.

This was O.K. I think it would have been better without adding the butter though. The consistency seemed to be much better before adding the butter. It also smelled better too. I would have like a thicker, richer, more chocolatey pudding.

the consistency was fine and it was easy but I was not crazy about it. it tasted too "dark", some people might prefer that but I think a lighter sweeter milk chocolate taste is more appropriate for pudding.

i dont know what happened.  the pudding turned out watery and left a bad aftertaste in my mouth.

i followed the recipe except used packed brown sugar, heaping spoons of chocolate, and less cornstarch as one reviewer suggested.  

at first it had a pudding-like consistency when it was hot, then after it cooled down, it was watery...almost like watered down chocolate milk.  sheesh...

Personally, I hate pudding, but this, I will eat.  This recipe is just as easy as the box pudding but it taste better (according to my pudding-freak boyfriend)!  Don't forget to add the butter, it makes a difference.  I forgot to add the butter, and the thought the pudding tasted just "okay."  But then I remembered and a final tasting proved all the raves to be true.  I also added 1 oz of semisweet for a deeper chocolate flavor.

Yum!  I really wanted chocolate pudding the other night and didn't have any box mix.  This recipe was perfect--better than a box mix, and just as easy.  I even used skim milk (all I had) and I thought it was good.  Maybe not creamy the way you're used to pudding, but it totally fed my craving.

I had to use brown sugar because I was out of sugar, and it was too sweet, so I added a handful of semi-sweet chocolate chips and its bomb.

This is a keeper! I added a touch more cocoa powder and substituted 1/2 cup of the white milk with a high quality, rich chocolate milk I had on hand because, hey...it's more chocolate! 
Tip: Put plastic wrap on the surface of the finished pudding to prevent that rubbery skin forming.

I made this pudding and it turned out ok. I didn't have quite enough cornstarch, so I used a bit of flour, and I didn't have cocoa powder so I used hot chocolate mix. It tasted kind of funny and not much like chocolate when I did the spoon test, so I melted some chocolate chips in the microwave and added those in. It pretty much tastes like chocolate chips, but not in a bad way. Super fun to make though! Thanks Kelly!

I made this last night and was very disappointed. it has a great taste but after refrigerating overnight, it broke down. It's not the first time I have made a cooked pudding but never had one liquify like this did. It was upsetting since I was using the pudding in a trifle for a dessert competition.

Very easy and delicious. Made exactly to the recipe. I sifted together the dry ingredients, and had no problem with lumps.

This was incredibly easy to make!  Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly except I used three heaping tablespoons of cocoa (the more chocolate the better).

Made it. Very easy reminded me of an old recipe my family used. Of course I added a little cream to it while it was still warm. It was gone in seconds!

This turned out great but wasn’t as chocolatey as I liked. I did heaping tablespoonfuls of cocoa.  After it was removed from heat and had cooled somewhat, I added about 1 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips and wisked until melted, this improved the flavor and did not seem to change the texture.

This pudding was AMAZING! I will definitely make it again. It was really thick, which I love in puddings. Next time I make it, I might add some of my own ingredients. Overall, it was just amazing and I loved it. I totally recommend it.

Pretty good! Followed the reviews adding a bit more cocoa. Used brown sugar that was a bit hard and had some pieces that made me worry.   But I’d dissolved perfectly and the final result was smooth and creamy. I stirred the mixture a lot while cooking, but noticed some mixture sticked to the bottom of the pan. Next time I’ll try pouring hot milk instead of cold. Great and quick recipe. Thanks!

I make the recipe as is and really enjoy the flavor, it's a quick fix when a desert is needed or when I have a very late night 'sweet' hunger and no more chocolate in the house. Another benefit of this recipe is that it is easy to adjust for vegans - replace the milk with soy or almond milk and use a vegan margarine instead of the butter. Turns out yummy, too.

This is one of my favorite recipes that I've made for years, but in recent years I've become lactose intolerant.  Tonight I tried to make it using oat milk, and WOW!!!  It's delicious!  My family didn't even notice!  
Also, we eat this warm in mugs!  YUMMMMMM!

I have made this several times. I adjusted the recipe for two servings for my wife and me. She always raves about the taste. This recipe is really easy and is even better topped with a dollop of whipped cream. I also add a little expresso powder.

4.75. Made recipe exactly as directed and it turned out perfectly puddingy (I just made that word up) . The only change when I make it again will be to decrease the sugar a bit to accommodate my own tastes.

My only change is I used chocolate milk. This is the best warm. I always make it when anyone in the house has a little chest cold or just cold from being outside.

This is easy to make and has a wonderful,  smooth consistancy. While the flavor is probably just right for milk chocolate lovers, I would prefer a richer chocolate taste. I'll try a bit less sugar and probably double the cocoa next time.

The only thing i did not do is bring it to a boil, if you bring it to a boil it will burn to the bottom. All i did was stir it until it got thick enough to have a film on the back of a spoon.

I just made this with my grandson! WOW!!! I have no idea why it never occurred to me that pudding isn’t just made in little instant pudding boxes to be mixed with milk...or the already made pudding packs! I just happened to stop in front of the pudding at the store, thought to myself....”I haven’t made that in awhile!” And then when I looked at the ingredients, I flipped out & put it right back on the shelf! Grabbed my phone, opened ALL RECIPES & looked up pudding. Seriously, MIND BLOWN!

Great recipe! The key is starting all ingredients on low heat until everything has been added and mixed well. Increase heat - and stir constantly until it boils. Once it comes to a boil, set the timer for 1 minute stirring constantly. Once that is finished, remove from heat, and stir in butter and vanilla. You can cool or eat it warm, but it should gel up perfectly. Pro tip: Using a good quality milk pan makes all the difference.

Great with a dollop of real whipped cream on top or line the bowls with whipped cream first and spoon in cooled pudding for "pudding in a cloud" ;) 
Can put a piece of cling wrap directly on top of pudding as it cools to avoid the skin if desired!

I love this recipe. I can make pudding in 10 minutes that’s amazing tasting. I make no changes to the recipe. I do use natural cocoa (not Dutch processed) and its rich and delicious.

This was easy to make. I think it needs a little more cocoa in proportion to the amount of milk, so I added another tablespoon of cocoa. If one likes a richer chocolate flavor you could add one quarter cup of cocoa which I would do if making it for a pie and decrease the milk by about a half cup. Also, cook at medium heat and no more stirring constantly  until it comes to a boil, then continue cooking for another minute. It will start to thicken before it boils. Cool for two hours  and serve  with whip cream, or else, pour into a pie shell and refrigerate. Delicious!

This was great! So simple, my daughter and I loved it.  I used the brown sugar per a suggestion by a member and I couldn’t have been happier! I think this is pretty foolproof and is a great recipe for a cold winter night.

I made the recipe as written and it was good (Nothing to write home about but good).  I made it a second time with a few alterations.   I replaced 3/4 cup of milk with heavy cream and, like many other reviewers, I used heaping TBSP's of cocoa powder and just a little bit more sugar.   It was soooo good!!   The kids and hubby loved it.  They said it tasted just like Hunts snack pack pudding.   I know many of you are thinking that doesn't say much but it's high praise from my family.

Omg!!! So amazingly delicious and super easy to make! I used brown sugar as that was what I had and heaping tbsp's of cocoa. Made individual pudding cups and topped with whipped cream. 8 have made this countless times now as it's a huge hit in my house!

I made a double batch and kicked it up a notch by using Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa Powder and adding 1 cup of mini semi-sweet morsels while it was cooking. OH MY GOODNESS GRACIOUS!!!! It took me back to my Grandma's house when I was a child in the 1950s!!!!!

Delicious! I’ve never made homemade pudding before. I followed the tips from a high rated review and used a little less cornstarch but I should either use the full amount or heat it longer next time. It didn’t set up well, but we ate/drank it anyway and the flavor was amazing!! Will be making this again!!!

This recipe is divine!  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added 1 additional tablespoon of cocoa (4 tablespoon total).  I also used arrowroot flour instead of cornstarch (a little less than 1/4 cup).  

Tossed the first 5 ingredients in a blender and blended for 30 seconds to lessen the chance of "clumps" during the heating process.

Next time I will use low heat the entire time and stir more to avoid burning.  Still super delicious and my family practically ate the whole pot!!

Divine. I actually add more cocoa to up the chocolate flavor and make it taste more dark chocolately. I will keep and remake this many times.

The taste is delicious it is easy to make, I used it as my filling for the cannoli I cooked for Christmas. Following these measurements I filled 15 cannolis the consistency was perfect for it, thick like jelly but not as firm just nice and smooth. I refrigerate it after it cooled and used it the next day to fill the cannolis Everyone loved it I had no left overs!

Easy. Delicious. Like other reviewers I added 1 extra Tbs. Cocoa. 

Also, my kids said they thought it tasted a little salty. I might use unsalted Butter next time.

First time made as directed - let cook adequate time as suggested, loved it. Second time, put in cook crust topped with marshmallows and toasted under broiler 2.5 minutes. Told kids it’s a s’mores pie. Third time added 3 egg yolks, (whip, set aside, added hot pudding a few spoonfuls at a time, until brought up to temp then added to pot and cooked an additional few minutes.) Then I put it cupcakes with chocolate cookie crust on the bottom and again toasted marshmallows on top. Told kids it was hot cocoa cupcakes. They loved it every time. Great easy recipe.

Halved the recipe and consistency/texture was perfect however I found it a little too "sugary."  Planning to make again with a little less sugar & a little more cocoa powder.

Fantastic. I only made substitutions because I had to with what I had on hand. I used heavy cream in place of milk and melted dark chocolate instead of cocoa. It was used for a pie filling. Very firm perfect for a pie. It was delicious and very decadent. Best chocolate pie I have ever had.

Easy to make, easy to modify and came out perfectly.  Butter in pudding - who knew?

I made half a batch with sugar and and half a batch with 1/3 sugar, 1/3 xylitol and stevia extract to taste.  Both thickened well.  I'll be making this pudding again!

Excellent chocolate pudding. For those complaining that it's too thin it's pudding not pie filling so it will be thinner than maybe you're used to. Also, it needs to cook for at least 2 mins after it comes to a boil. Sometimes I use 1/4 cup white & 1/4 cup light brown sugar. Still tastes like great chocolate pudding but adds a little richness to the flavor. Or add a bit of cinnamon or instant coffee powder for that hint in the background that seems like an added bonus.

It was so good, I was compelled to leave this review (and I never leave reviews)! Not only was this crazy easy to make, but it tasted so rich and professional, I was shocked that I made it. I followed the exact recipe, except I used dark chocolate cocoa powder rather than regular (DO IT). And it had a wonderful pudding skin, my favorite part. I’m pudding this in my favorite recipes ;)

Cooked this on medium/low heat and stir, stir, stir, until it becomes glossy and thick. That's how you keep lumps out and get great pudding. I used brown sugar and it was yum!

Little too sweet.  Next time I'd use 2TB. less sugar and add 1 TB. more cocoa.  I also added 2 egg yolks at the end and only used 1 TB. of butter.  I also used skim milk  and cut it back to 2 cups, so it wouldn't be runny.  Ricipe is super easy, fast with ingredients everyone has on hand.  Beautiful texture.

My family loves this so i make it fairly often as a quick last minute dessert. I usually leave out the vanilla - just my preference. It is much better chilled than right off the stove.

I took advice of another reviewer and put plastic wrap on top before putting in the fridge. This keeps it from getting that tough thin layer on top so pudding has creamy consistency throughout.

It's great with strawberries!

Thanxx for this recipe. This is a stayer. The only change I made was to use sticky brown sugar instead of the white sugar. My guests raved and I love it!

Thank you, Kelly Thompson! Perfection. This is the chocolate pudding I remember my Grandma making on all-too-rare occasions. I would suggest using Dutch process cocoa. I was lucky to find a closeout of Droste at the store. Just wonderful and thanks for sharing your family's recipe.  I thought boxed Hershey's was a step up in quality until I made this. Buh-bye box.

It’s a great recipe, except every time I make it, it comes out way too liquid. Both times I have made it, it has come out more like a thick hot chocolate. So what I did to make it into a pudding was to re do the recipe, but using the liquid pudding instead of milk. It turned out fantastic and tasted great. I believe this recipe asks for too much milk, I will try to make it again with half of the asked amount of milk, and see how that goes.

It is a great recipe, though if you don't stir quickly or often enough, it will become a bit chunky with pudding-chunks. It honestly takes about 30 minutes total, and doubling the recipe gets you to feed many. Perfect for the chocolate lovers in our lives!

I made this pudding today and was pleasantly surprised that pudding with no eggs in it could be this rich. I used rounded T of cocoa because I LOVE chocolate and also used brown sugar as suggested by some in the comments. Will be trying this in a pie soon. Thanks for the recipe!

Quick and easy dessert when you've a craving for chocolate.  I substituted coconut sugar and almond/coconut milk otherwise everything was the same.  I would have like it a little more chocolate-ly so next time I might add  more chocolate.
UPDATE: made it again for chocolate pie. I did increase the cocoa from 3 Tbsp. to 4 Tbsp. (1/4 cup) Perfect.

OMG ! This big hit on my family !! Easy and tasty. First , I taste sweetness not enough, but I was wrong. I think I better stick with 1/2 cup of sugar that recipe said. ( I did another 1/4 cup adding..... it is quite sweet . Especially I put on home made Whipping cream on that )
Well, definitely my repeat recipe !

I was disappointed with this recipe. I covered and chilled in the fridge before serving. The consistency wasn't smooth enough. I also wasn't a fan of the flavor. I'm pretty sure I followed all of the instructions correctly. In my opinion, the flavor is more frosting-like rather than a pudding.

The  recipe is easy to make but I was hoping for a more chocolatey/sweet flavor, but my family thought it was delicious. I would suggest doubling everything because this recipe does not make a lot.

This a very cheap, lovely and tasty option. I’ve made this quite few times, and it’s nice. Nothing fancy, but it does the job. Here are some tips I’ve got for you, they will make your job easier:

Instead of doing everything on the pan, mix your dry ingredients with 1 cup of milk and put the 1 1/3 on the stove to warm up. When the milk is warm add the chocolate water and this way you are less likely to get lumps and whatnot. Remember! Don’t stop stirring. That is very important.

Loved it!  It will be my go-to chocolate pudding recipe!  No changes.  No lumps or clumps - just whisk everything together before and during the adding of the milk.

I have mixed feelings on this one: On the one hand, it certainly was easy to make and satisfied my immediate craving for chocolate pudding. On the other hand, I made a double batch that there's no way we will finish mostly because of the gelatinous texture. I used 2% milk and maybe whole milk would've made it creamier but I just don't know if I want to make it again to find out...

With every recipe I have tried on this sight, I first follow the recipe thoroughly. I try to rate each one based on the recipe itself. Then if I want to add or change anything I do that on my own. So, what I am trying to say is that when I rate a recipe with 5 stars it's because I loved it the way it is. As I read through reviews I get a little upset when recipes are rated low because someone decided to jack with the original. Do not rate a recipe poorly because you jacked up, blame yourself, not the recipe! I made this and it turned out fantastic and yes, next time I will put saran wrap over the top to prevent the strange "crust" from forming but other than that, this was perfect. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

It had a few lumps of cornstarch after cooling for a few hours, so I will try to whisk it better next time. The flavor was much smoother than pudding made from a box mix.

Close to my grandmother's recipe.  It was not so intensely sweet as so many are.  I might add a bit more chocolate next time, but did enjoy it.

Really good, and tasted great! However, it was kinda lacking. First time I made it, it was good, wasn't to thick or thin! However, it doesn't have that "chocolate" flavor I would've liked. There's a hint of chocolate, but its not that noticeable. Next time i'll modify the recipe so I add more sugar and coco for better flavor, other than that its great!

I used dark cocoa powder to make it look dark for Halloween. It was tasty but I think I didn’t let it boil long enough because it isn’t as thick as I was expecting.

This is foolproof and delicious. Probably need a whisk. I add 1 tbsp dark cocoa powder as a personal preference. Yummy.

My husband loved it and said it was amazing. He prefers it hot. He went to reheat it the next morning and burnt it all to the bottom, so be sure to never put this above medium heat!

Good flavor. Be sure to watch the video. It was not clear to me how thick the pudding should be or how the coated back of the spoon should look. My first try thickened and coated the back of the spoon but never set. It remained runny. It was ok over ice cream as a sauce. The second try, after watching the video was fine.

Great recipe and so easy to make :) I changed the recipe slightly since I do not drink milk. I used almond milk instead, just did not add as much since it is more watery (~ 2 cups maybe a bit less). I also used coconut palm sugar. Turned out great.

Awesome! Just like grannie's. Add 1/3 cornstarch rather than 1/4 if your making a pie. (No foul for extra scope if coco) ??

I normally don't like pudding, but this was great! I made it with my friend, and it took only 15 min. to make! I think it would be a great dessert for any time. This is a very easy recipe, and I encourage you to make this with your friends and family!!

This is the perfect recipe if you are making a pie or dessert with filling!  I made my pudding with dark chocolate and 1/4 cup of extra sugar (brown) just because it is my family's preference.  I would suggest breaking up and lumps in the dry ingredients by hand before you add the milk.  You can also measure the cornstarch with a 1/4 cup of the milk and mix them well before adding them to the pot.  Then add the remaining 2 1/2 cups of milk.  Any lumps left should be fairly easy to crush on the side of the pan with a metal spoon  before the mixture starts to boil.  Thank you for the recipe!  It is a keeper.

I've made this a bunch of times and it always turns out delicious as written. Recently I had no milk so I used rice milk - I don't recommend substituting because it comes out like warm snot - stay with it as written and you won't be sorry.

this chocolate pudding is SO GOOD! WAY BETTER than the pre-packaged pudding you buy at the store!I tried it before i put in butter and it was AMAZING, so if you don't want the extra fat in your pudding just don't put the butter in! :)

For No-Nonsense Dark Chocolate Addicts: 

I added 3 heaping tablespoons of good quality unsweetened cocoa, and about 1 whole block of Scharfenberger's unsweetened chocolate (1/5 of the 275 gm box) , grated. 
I used a hand mixer to incorporate it really well. 

I also used coconut sugar instead of white sugar. 

The pudding came out AWESOME, with a  seriously dark, bittersweet chocolate taste. Super smooth. If you like your chocolate pudding kickass dark, try this out adding the cocoa & unsweetened chocolate.

Never buying the box again... this is a great recipe and I made  it with almond milk and stevia for a lower cal treat.  Works great with the substitutions.  Going to try it with coconut milk next.

This recipe is so simple and can be made with ingredients that I usually have on hand. My entire family loved this yummy dessert and they've asked for it a few more times since I've made it - a sure sign that this is a keeper recipe. I love serving this warm, right from the stovetop. And it's even better over vanilla ice cream!

I followed the recipe exactly only it did t thicken enough so I added another 1/8 cup cornstarch. Also, I think next time I will add more cocoa, as the flavor was not strong enough for me.

The end product was way to thin to eat as pudding, even after chilling overnight. It tasted great although I did make one small change to the recipe: I added marscapone to the cooked mixture, off the heat with the butter and vanilla which made it extra creamy. Instead of tossing the "pudding", I decided to fix it. I combined 1 1/2 C milk, 1/2 C corn starch and 1/2 C cocoa powder (it wasn't chocolatey enough for me) and cooked it until very thick (I thought it was already a bit too sweet so didn't add sugar. The finished pudding was sweet enough for me). I stirred in 2 T butter and 2 t vanilla and 2 T marscapone then let it chill. Much better!

I followed this recipe exactly and it didn't set. It had the texture of thick chocolate syrup. Also, though I stirred it constantly, towards the end there was no avoiding getting lumps of overcooked pudding in it even though I turned down the heat to medium low. So if you attempt this, maybe use a double boiler?

Very good and very smooth. As previous reviewers suggested, I used 1/2 c of light brown sugar instead of the white and it did make the flavor more rich tasting. I also followed the suggestion to use 3 heaping tablespoons of cocoa, which boosted the chocolate flavor and blended nicely with the brown sugar. Other than that, I followed the recipe. Made sure the dry ingredients were lump-free before whisking in the milk, then placed the pot on the stove. I whisked constantly while cooking, then when fully cooked removed from the heat and whisked in the butter and vanilla. Cooled by whisking the pot of pudding in a sink full of cold water before transferring to a bowl & covering the surface with plastic wrap and refrigerating. It was very creamy and "chocolatey". Family loved it.

Mine came out runny, most likely because I used 3 TB of cornstarch instead of 4.  Next time I will use the entire 1/4 cup.  I has a nice chocolate flavor, and the butter and vanilla come through with tasty goodness.  I used skim milk, and when I make this next time, I will start with canned evaporated milk, just to taste the difference.  Will make this again.

I've made this at least 3 times, and I have been very pleased.  The recipe doubles nicely, and that's a good thing, because if your family loves chocolate pudding as much as mine, you'll want more.  I was able to successfully tweak the recipe by replacing the white sugar with a sugar / stevia blend such as Truvia and the newer product called Zing, by using fat-free milk and by reducing the butter by one fourth.  The pudding tastes better the following day so if you can plan ahead, try to make it the day before you want it or need it.  Since the recipe calls for stirring constantly, I found that using a wire whisk works very nicely because it breaks up any clumps.   This is the perfect treat for when you are craving something sweet and creamy.  Thank you, Kelly Thompson, for such a wonderful recipe!

It was great except it tasted better if you add two teaspoons instead of one.

I have made this several times and we love it. I now play with it and sub brown sugar for white, cut out the cocoa,  cut back the milk a bit and splash in some bourbon - and then you get a nice butterscotch pudding! So easy, no messy eggs to stir in! Thank you Kelly for a great recipe!

I found that this recipe came out super lumpy! I had to use an immersion blender to get all of the lumps out and then later, when I took it out of the frig to use it, it was really lumpy again. I am going t try another recipe for next time.

I increased the the milk by 1/4 cup and the unsweetened cocca  to 1/4  cup.  I used 1% milk.  The pudding was a big hit with the family.  It was easy and fun to make so no more store bought pudding.

The pudding was very good, and my family likes it, but the image of the pudding in other bowls is a bit deceiving, because it look much more creamier than mine. however, this is a great recipe and I would definitely make it again. Careful not to burn the milk when cooking!!

I tried making it last night and ended up with the perfect texture (just like pudding), but totally ruined the taste by burning it (cooking it too fast; too high a heat) and adding too much salt.  I'm sure the garbage disposal loved it, tho... :-D

Tonight, I tried something different.  I used our Vitamix blender to blend all the ingredients together (made sure all were carefully measured out, including the salt), except the cornstarch.  I tasted it... tasted like good cocoa!  Poured it into the pan and heated it a bit before adding the cornstarch.  Tasted the spoon after it thickened up proper (Ouch! Burned my tongue!) and now it's cooling in the fridge.  I think I nailed it pretty well this time.  Pays to follow the instructions! :-D

I might be adding a little more cornstarch than the recipe asks for, which is possibly why it's coming out the proper consistency when done.  Someone commented it was kinda runny.  Might want to try cooking it a bit longer or adding a pinch more time (not thyme!  HA!).

Beats paying for the stuff on the shelf with artificial food colors.  That was my motivation for trying to make REAL chocolate pudding... and I'm a guy! :-D

*Regarding Lumps* Just put everything in a jar with tight fitting lid and shake vigorously for 20 seconds or so. Then cook. The flavor was great, plus I melted some pieces of dark chocolate instead of vanilla.

The only problem is that I want to eat the whole batch in one sitting it is so good!! Commit to stirring constantly, scrapping the bottom of the pan to keep from burning, until it is really boiling, I have made it dozens of times and has always pleased!
The person, Suz, who gave a two star review and added an egg, obviously did not cook it long enough!

It's good, the best homemade pudding I've made (out of admittedly few puddings). Besides heaping the tablespoons of cocoa powder, I followed the recipe. I used 2% milk. The pudding looks like the picture(s). There was a foamy layer over the mixture after I added the milk but that may be due to over-whisking. I removed with a sieve.

Very easy and creamy.   Used 1 cup heavy cream and 2 cups 2% milk, a little more than 1 tsp. vanilla and heaped the cocoa tbsp.   Boiled gently for 1 minute.  Be careful not to burn.  Deep chocolate flavor and not too sweet.  Served topped with whipped cream and shaved chocolate.  Yummy.

This is a delicious  and easy dessert,  with ingredients, most of us have at home. I always scale to 5 ,but divide into 8 servings.This way, I have dessert for 2 diners, but with smaller portions and less calories.. I cover the indiividual dessert cups with plastic wrap, right against the pudding, to prevent  a skin from forming on  top.

This recipe is a simple and homey treat! The first time I made it, I prepared it as written, using evaporated milk for extra creaminess. It was wonderful! The second batch I made, I added an extra tablespoon of cocoa powder & added 2 ounces of chopped dark chocolate with the vanilla & butter. It definitely made it much richer & more chocolatey. Next time, I will NOT add the extra cocoa, but WILL add the finely chopped chocolate. I used this to fill pastry shells for mini chocolate pies. Delicious!

Great pudding. I made it with regular soy milk due to lactose intolerance. Cow's milk would have made it perfect.

This pudding is fantastic! I can't get enough. My advice is you need to babysit while its heating. Don't let more than 30 seconds go by without stirring. When it starts to steam its getting close and once all the bubbles go away its done cooking after 30 seconds or so. That last part of the cook time is the most crucial. Don't let it lump up!  I also add 1/2 teaspoon of cornstarch just to tighten it up.

It's got potential.  I think it could use more cocoa and sugar, but that's me. Perhaps substitute some milk for cream, too, for added richness. 

Consistency is great.

Delicious! I made a few adjustments to the recipe and that's still a work in progress, but overall I'd say this recipe was a big WIN!

One thing I did was replace approximately half of the sugar with stevia sweetener (which I added after cooking). That worked out fine, but I'm not sure I got just the right amount of stevia. So, that will take a little more experimenting.

I added a teensy bit more cocoa (as I read others had done) and accidentally used 3 cups of milk instead of 2-3/4. I also added less than a Tablespoon of butter (because I'm worried about the fat content) but I think what I did add still enhanced the flavor.

It seemed obvious that the recipe would be perfect as-is, or you could do some small adjustments here and there and find success that way. I'll be cooking this again!

Took other reviewers' suggestions and used brown sugar versus white, and used heaping tablespoons of cocoa. Delicious and creamy; I will definitely make this again.

I really like the taste of this but even though it was coating the spoon as instructed it didn't set. I used this in a pie and it was more like pudding. Good tasting though.

I doubled the recipe which gave me approx 8 servings. It came out perfectly and the only thing I changed was I used Dutch processed cocoa. I poured servings in my kids Tupperware for lunch and it was perfect!

Very easy to make. I put 4Tbsp of cocoa powder and 1/4 tsp of coffee powder to enhance the flavour. Also threw in some grated chocolate with hazelnuts. Minimal effort. But very tasty.

I made this exactly as written-but I had to double it.  Making traditional ice box cake ( with graham crackers) that my Grandma Nanny showed me, I knew I'd need more and it was delicious. Will only use this recipe from now on. A personal note- I use the microwave for pudding- no chance of scorching the bottom.

A long time family favorite - I cook it in the microwave - fast and fabulous!  For a special treat, put a layer of mini marshmallows in the bottom of each individual serving dish and pour the hot pudding on top. The marshmallows will melt and some will rise to the top giving the pudding a fun appearance and a little sweet burst that contrasts with the rich chocolate.  So good!!

Amazing!! Cannot believe I just made homemade pudding! I served this in individual ramikins topped with homemade whipped cream and everyone loved it. This dessert recipe was very easy, quick and delicious yet elegant too. I used skim milk and 3  heaping tablespoons of coco powder. At first I was unsure if by using skim milk the pudding would set but it did.  Even with using skim milk the pudding was chocolatey, smooth and rich. Excellent recipe.

This was delish!  I reduced the amount of corn starch as other suggested so it doesn't get too firm in the refrigerator and also used heaping tablespoons of Cocoa.  I also added an eighth of a teaspoon of chili powder.  This doesn't make it spicy at all, it just adds another layer of flavor that makes it really Delicious.

This chocolate pudding was okay. I added more milk, and I also added chocolate chips into the pudding. It was either lacking something or an ingredient in this recipe wasn't right because the flavor was not good. I'd much rather have a cup of Jello's Chocolate Pudding than the pudding that this recipe provided.

I love this recipe - just like mom used to make.  The one thing I have changed from hers, is I heat it in the microwave instead of top of the stove.  It is much quicker.  I whisk it every 45-60 seconds and continue cooking until it boils.
Prep time is less than 5 minutes.

My 12 year old daughter and I made this recipe only without the butter and it came out perfectly. Very chocolaty and delicious! If you wanted to, you could adapt this recipe to just about any flavor, from vanilla to pistachio. It seems just like the cornstarch pudding recipes I remember from my childhood and a very good recipe for beginning cooks. I can't think of any reason to add butter, so I just left it out.

Now that I've discovered this recipe it's my go to for when I am craving chocolate but don't have any at home. The other day I made it for my mum and she asked me what brand it was... she was amazed that I had made it so quickly and was especially stunned at how delicious it was. Try this recipe guys!

I have made this 3 times now, and I LOVE it! I tried writing a review before and accidentally published it before I said why I like it so much :) I agree with kittypie when I say, use BROWN SUGAR, it makes the flavor much deeper and richer. Also if you don't want an usually thick jello type pudding with a strange texture, don't use all the cornstarch, only a little over half (which would be about 2 1/2 tablespoons) . I have done it different ways. The first time with less cornstarch and brown sugar and it was magnificent. The second time with all the cornstarch and it was, meh, ok I guess, would have been ok for a cake filling maybe but way way too thick. Third time I tried with white sugar as called for, and half plus a little of the cornstarch as I did the first time, it tastes very good but would be 20 times better with the brown sugar. Hope this helps! I know I always read reviews before I cook things from this site, I'm grateful for kittypie's suggestions, also, chopped almonds or fruit on top is very yummy! Happy cooking all!

This recipe tasted very good, but I could not manage to get a good texture. I tried it twice, but I don't think I'll be making it again.

I just got done making this and it is fantastic! I shifted all the ingredients in the pan and did nothing else to change it. I'm not a huge fan of chocolate but this is wonderful! I'm not sure what happened with others and not having it set. It took about 15 minutes to cook and once it started to thicken up I let it come to a boil, dipped a spoon in it and ran my finger a crossed the back to see if it stayed in place. Really easy and amazing!

Very easy to make and my husband loved it! Way better than the store bought ones! I did make with brown sugar and as reviewers said, heaping tablespoons of chocolate. I put in small containers and it yielded 8 servings.

This is an excellent dessert choice if you are looking for something easy, chocolatey and comforting. As some other reviewers have stated, you could get away with a little bit less cornstarch. This recipe is also good with a little bit of cinnamon added to it.

My husband and I both loved this dessert dish! My husband said this is a keeper! I did not change a thing, and also would like to mention this is my first time making chocolate pudding from scratch. It was fabulous, much better than store bought, and even better than restaurant chocolate pudding.  I served it warm and it was delicious.  I read so many reviews - and how some people made chocolate pudding pops from this recipe. I'm going to try that, too!  This recipe is definitely a 5 star!

I added an extra tablespoons of cocoa powder for a richer chocolate flavor.  I have made this pudding many times and it's really easy and tastes great in a pie crust too. My kids and husband love it.

I will only give this 4*'s because I used evaporated milk to make the pudding.  

I love making pies and in the past when I made chocolate pie, i used a box pudding.  I saw this and decided to try it.  It tastes exactly like the box, only fresher. And it's almost as easy as opening a box.  It is velvety smooth because of the cornstarch.  And no preservatives!

Excellent recipe!  I ran the cocoa, starch and sugar through a sieve.  I doubled the ingredients, (using half brown sugar and half granulated sugar) cooked over med hi, whisking fast and constantly (and forgot to add the salt) - so it quickly came to a boil.   Once I brought it to a boil,  I reduced the heat to simmer, whisked briskly as I cooked it 3 minutes longer.  Turned out perfectly!  Once transferring to serving dishes, I covered it with plastic wrap touching the surface to eliminate/remove the thick film that forms over the top when refrigerated.  This recipe is great for whipping up a quick and easy chocolate treat, for sure.    Simply impressive.  Everyone here loved it.  :)

This is the chocolate pudding recipe I make all the time.  I do one thing different, I add two -three eggs yolks (tempered) to the pudding for extra richness.  I occasionally change it up by using 1/2 the orange oil in place of the vanilla for a chocolate orange taste.

This recipe was so good! Instead of using regular milk, I used almond milk and it still tasted great. I also used half the amount of butter because I felt like that was too much.

Great recipe. The pudding comes out thick and rich, as it should be. I know a few people complained about the consistency of this dessert, but as long as you follow the recipe (don't put egg in it) then it will turn out great.  And, if the recipe doesn't call for it, why put it in?

YUM!  This was delicious - so much better than the boxed pudding... and better ingredients too.  This really didn't take long to make.  It was not lumpy at all for me and I didn't use a double boiler.  I whisked together the sugar, cornstarch, cocoa powder and salt in a medium saucepan and then added in just a little bit of the milk at first and whisked it together - it was almost a paste.  Once it was smooth, then I added in the rest of the milk and cooked over medium heat.  I didn't whisk vigorously, just enough to keep anything from sticking to the bottom.  Once it came to a boil, then I started whisking faster and just waited until it looked like it had thickened up well.  The whole process took only about 10  minutes for me.  I don't like pudding skin and I don't like putting plastic on top of anything hot, so I just transferred it to a serving bowl and left it on the counter top - whisking every few minutes until it started to cool, which kept any skin from forming.  I like pudding cold best, but I thought this was even good warm!  Great recipe, I will definitely be making this again.

Just made this for me and the kids and it is delicious. I followed the recipe exactly as written. I let mine come to a "roaring boil" for about two minutes and the consistency came out great. This recipe is a keeper, but  next time I may add some more cocoa powder to make it a little more chocolatey.

I used 5 Tbsp of corn starch and doubled the vanilla. Occasionally I also make vanilla pudding and alternate layers of vanilla and chocolate pudding (it's fun whisking two pots at one ^__^). This chocolate pudding is definitely my family's favorite desert recipe.

So easy to make, and my wife loved the pudding.

I  made one minor change.  

Recipe calls for 2 3/4 cups milk

I used 2 cups of 2 % milk and 3/4 cup of half & half (only because I ran out of milk.)

Fantastic results!!!!!

I love this pudding!!! 
I had read a review about the pudding being too thin but this is not true at all, Im thinking they didn't cook it long enough to get the right consistency. 

The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly but after that I made a few modifications.

I skipped adding the sugar at the beginning and when the pudding was ready I added 6 individual packets of Twin sugar. I used almond milk instead of regular milk (since I don't drink regular milk) and I added only 1 tablespoon of butter ( I used margarine instead).

The pudding is rich and delicious!!  You must be patient when cooking puddings since they have to be stirred constantly . Boil and simmer until thick enough. It gets even thicker when cooled.

This recipe is heart warming comfort food and so easy to make! I double the recipe when I have extra milk that needs to be used up and put it in a pretty glass serving bowl.  The beauty of the recipe is in its sweet simplicity, so don't change a thing!

I followed the recipe exactly and this turned out amazing! As I had seen from other reviewers that it was a bit thick and better for pie I poured mine into a crust and let it cool in the fridge, then topped with home made whipped cream. It was delicious and gone in two days. I was multitasking while making this so I definitely was not "stirring constantly" I think this may have been beneficial considering there weres also reviews stating it was too thin and soup like. Just make sure to boil it long enough to thicken up and don't go crazy with stirring it. Oh and I think if you're getting lumps of cocoa or corn starch in your pudding,  you need a sifter so you aren't pouring hard to break apart chunks of powder into the mix in the first place. 
My experience was great. Delicious chocolate pudding pie!

I make this as written and it is plenty chocolaty and mine did not get gelatin hard after refrigeration as other reviewers stated. I stirred it constantly until it coated the back of a spoon but it never came to real boil. I was going to wait for the boil, but the instructions didn't say that so I took it off the heat thinking it might not set up properly but it was perfect. It also didn't take that long to make. I doubled the recipe and it worked perfectly.

Worked perfectly!! I followed PLAYKITTENPIE's suggestions and used brown sugar instead of white as well as using half the corn starch. I also made sure to heap the cocoa powder as I measured it out. In addition to that I decided to add a little bit of cinnamon. The pudding is delicious! It's the perfect consistency and very creamy! Will definitely be making this recipe again!!

I've been cooking  over 30 yrs. and I love  the simple recipes.About 15 yrs. ago I became allergic to eggs-you'd be shocked how many things have eggs.I'd go to birthday parties etc...and could only watch everyone else enjoy...I just made this pudding, increased the cocoa a bit also the cornstarch because I made it into a pie for my hubby of almost 32 yrs.Delicious-thank you.

This is a great pudding recipe! Followed the recipe exactly. I did not think it was overly sweet. I'm not sure if the butter was necessary. I added it, but it looked pretty thick without it. Maybe next time I'll leave it out. But, as is, this recipe is great. Thank you!

This is the best, easy comfort food recipe I've ever found.

Wanna know what cheers me up? Warm Chocolate Pudding.

I use dark chocolate caocao powder instead but hey, to each their own.

Think I might add more cornstarch to my next batch though. I just prefer it a little thicker/pudding-er xD

Exactly the cornstarch homemade pudding I was looking for.  Tripled the amounts (my family would simply laugh at a 1/2 cup serving and ask for more!) and even at that it set up perfectly. The only change I made was a touch of almond extract along with the vanilla, but I do that to nearly all recipes. Now at Christmas I'll use a bit more cocoa to make it a dark chocolate pudding and add peppermint instead of vanilla.

The recipe is perfect.  Making this does require patience though.  Too much heat and you -will- burn the pudding on the bottom of your saucepan before you get a good boil.

This is what chocolate pudding is supposed to taste like. I make as directed except with 1/4 cup cocoa powder (equivalent to 4 tbsp). This is easy to tweak with fancy flavors if desired. For people who don't know how to use cornstarch, you MUST boil it for it to become clear and lose its floury taste, basic kitchen chemistry. The butter temperature seems unimportant (it just melts!) but there's a reason to add vanilla last; otherwise it would evaporate off and lose flavor in boiling.

So much better than a box pudding and just as easy! My first try at pudding from scratch. This was very simple and very good. I used a high fat cocoa and heaping tablespoons. I did mix the dry ingredients well before adding milk to prevent lumps. The kids gobbled it up- a great after dinner dessert.

Oh my goodness this is so good! I live overseas and always looking for easy tasty things to make, and this recipe goes in my files. Thank you for sharing your Mama's recipe and giving me a taste of home! I plan to use pudding in tiny pie shells and top with whipping cream.

Great recipe :) but instead of adding corn starch directly to the sugar , first stir it in the milk then add the milk to the sugar it turned out to be smooth & with no lumps

It was nice and chocolatey, but was a little on the thin side.  It tasted great though!

Basic recipe proportions are fine; instructions are good.  You might try heating the milk, 90 seconds in the microwave, before adding to speed up the thickening process.  Always works for me in pudding recipes.

I have never made from scratch creamy pudding,  just boxed, rice and bread puddings as I thought they sounded like more work then it would be worth. However, this recipe was super easy and turned out perfectly.  I don't think I would change a thing.

Followed the directions the first review gave except used the original amount of cornstarch and we all loved it! Just a little rich so don't put too much in your bowl at once ;)

Delicious!! I doubled it but only used  1.5 cups of sugar and for my family it was sweet enough.  I did not add butter since I was out of it. also added two eggs like other readers suggested.  Thanks for sharing!!!

This recipe is so easy and just plain perfect. I used evaporated milk because I didn't have plain milk. Also, I think I burned mine a little bit. I sturred constantly but suddenly it just boiled and just became thick in a blink of an eye. That didn't keep the pudding from being perfect.

This is an Awesome recipe, so glad I tried it.  I even used coconut milk and it turned out beautifully!  OMG it is so good!, only downfall... I had to go in for a second spoonful while it was still hot, burned my tongue..lol.  I am DEFINITELY making this again, and again, and again :D
_ The people who said its too thin, either didn't cook it long enough or didn't use the 1/4 cup cornstarch. This is a no fail recipe. The texture and thickness of this pudding are PERFECT.

Yum!  Just made it and it's still pretty warm, but tasted it and it's delicious.  I had Godiva cocoa powder on hand, which worked out wonderfully.  The family is all in different parts of the house.  I wonder if there'll be any left by dinner time???? Hmmmmm.

This turned out amazingly for me. One thing to note is that it took me only a couple minutes of boiling the mixture for it to come to the perfect consistency. Love it! I will most definitely be making this again. And it only takes a few minutes.

My son decided at the last minute that he wanted to leave chocolate pudding for Santa. I was happy to find this recipe that used ingredients I had on hand. This pudding couldn't have been easier. I made it as written and will follow the recipe exactly in the future. It was easy and delicious. We'll be making this a lot!

Excellent, simple chocolate pudding recipe.  Just as easy as using a boxed mix, and much tastier.  As another reviewer mentioned, mixing the dry ingredients and ensuring there are no  lumps, before stirring in the milk, is key to a smooth pudding.  The pudding does become quite firm, but we like it this way.

Excellent and straight forward recipe. To all those having problems with the viscosity, temperature and movement is key. Too much heat causes the starch to unwind onto itself and congeal/burn on the bottom. Too little heat will result in thin, chalky tasting pudding. Reduce liquid to a gentle simmer, stirring constantly for 2 to 3 min. It is also quite useful to thoroughly  dissolve the corn starch in the cold milk before applying heat. If you add more cocoa, reduce the amount of starch or increase the amount of liquid slightly as the cocoa will also serve to thicken the slurry. Simple recipes are easy to tweak.

This is exactly the recipe I was looking for to taste like the boxed "cook & serve" stuff of my youth! I read through several reviews first, as I always find that helpful on this site, so I did incorporate some of those ideas for the good and bad on my first try. First off, I stuck with 1/4 C cornstarch as published and had no problems with consistency. I dropped sugar to 1/3 C as I always find American recipes too sweet. Upped salt to 1/4 tsp and also upped cocoa to 4 heaping teaspoons. I mixed 3 different types I had on hand: Hershey's special dark, Wilbur's and Bellagio sipping chocolate cocoa for extra decadence. I also threw in a few drops of hot sauce just for kicks although I didn't really taste it. The second batch I just made this morning was perfect! The difference between it and last week's was that last week I used 1 can of evaporated milk (per reviewer) along with whole milk, as I didn't have enough milk on hand. There was definitely an unpleasant, weird flavor last week that I attributed to the evaporated milk although I was concerned I might have slightly burned it too. So this week I used all whole raw milk and noticed none of the weirdness even though I had some slightly burnt stuff stuck on the bottom of the pot again. So unless you really like the flavor of evaporated milk, I would not suggest it for this recipe. As for the skin, I like it as proof it's homemade pudding

While this is not the best pudding i've ever had, it gets 5 stars for straightforwardness and ease. It's just like the boxed pudding except you get to choose the quality of the cocoa so it ends up tasting better.

Easy and delicious!  I might try halving the vanilla next time since it was a bit strong for me.  I'm also going to try doubling the recipe and freezing it as pudding pops!

The flavor is great but it thins after cooking it. Very thick in the pan but as it cools, it thins. I've tried many times - sometimes cooking til it's thick but not boiling, sometimes cooking just until it's beginning to boil, and sometimes boiling for a bit. Every time it thickens then becomes runny as it cools. Why? If it would stay thick, it's definitely 5 stars! I couldn't give it 5 stars when it won't stay thick.

OK...I'm really upset.  How is it I've lived to this ripe old age and nobody told me about this quick chocolate pudding?!?  Quick, easy, and far better than that store bought stuff I've used for years and I know exactly what's in it...none of those weird sounding things.  I made it exactly as written except I did add some butter as others suggested.  I want to try the marshmallow trick, too.  And the Cool Whip trick.  This recipe will amuse me for a long time!

This really is as fast as boxed pudding.  I used heaping TBS of cocoa and despite being a serious chocolate addict, one recipe served my family of five just fine (with no leftovers).  The quality of your cocoa will affect the taste.

Made this yesterday. So easy and good. Since I was going to use this as a pie filling I add one tablespoon of flour to the dry ingredients to give it some additional thickness. I also let it boil for two minutes, stirring constantly, and then took it off the heat and let it cool. As a pie filling this worked out great. The filling was firm and sliced very easily. Good chocolate taste too. I did let the pie  chill thoroughly before serving it.

I sifted my dry ingredients into the pot. I pouted it into martini and wine glasses and put Saran Wrap on top before putting it into the fridge. It was a pretty easy recipe.

If you add 1 T cornstarch to 1c liquid, bring it to a boil & boil for 1 minute, you got jel!!  Works for pudding, gravy, fruit goo for pies, etc.  This recipe has 4T (1/4 c) cornstarch to 2 3/4 c milk.  If you bring this to a boil & hold for 1 min it cannot help but thicken! I know that ultra pasturized milk is no good for cheese as it will not curd.  Perhaps this may be part of the 'not thickening' problem.  I used "dutched" cocoa (Droste's) & will try again with a non dutched like Hershey's just to compare.  The Droste's was delicious.  Plenty of chocolatey flavor for me.  To the guy who made this & said it tasted like broccoli... the off flavor may have come from your butter, your pan or your cocoa.  If you follow the recipe with fresh, tasty ingredients, I guarantee it will NOT taste like broccoli.  Maybe it will if you burn it.

Very easy, VERY good. Just 5 minutes out of the pot, and it's so thick that my spoon is resting on top without sinking in. I stirred constantly with the pot over medium heat until it came to a boil, then stirred vigorously for one minute while it boiled.

I decided to try this recipe because I couldn't find my mom's recipe, and this was a great substitute! It tasted really good, however since I like it warm it was a little too thin for me and I think there was too much butter (there were pools of it on top of the pudding). Maybe if I had let it chill it might have thickened up a bit.

Fantastic! easy and so delicious-- no gluten, no GMO's and filled with healthy antioxidant chocolate... I like that I can adjust the sugar(s) or even use stevia or agave!  I used sliced almonds and orange zest and it was so nice!

I think this recipe is wonderful! It makes a great base pudding for any flavor!  I skipped the cocoa and added peanut butter instead. Added mini chocolate chips on top while still hot so they would melt.  I never really liked store bought pudding and this one is perfect.

This is a great recipe. I'm so used to buying packaged instant pudding mixes, and I'm not sure I've ever cooked pudding from scratch before I ran across this recipe. I have some cornstarch that I need to use up, so I make a batch of this every week or so. I think I just made my fifth batch. I kept stirring it every couple of minutes as it cooled down, so as to inhibit a "skin" forming on it. I also had never really heard of eating pudding warm - I tried it once, but I definitely preferred this after it chilled in the fridge. This recipe is worth recommending!

I have made this pudding many times and it's one of my family's favourites. I just finished making it again but this time I used half 1% DARK chocolate milk/half 2% white and it still set up without any problems and I even stirred in 1/4 Cup of semi-sweet choc. chips when I added the vanilla and butter. Then I had a taste but I didn't find it quite sweet enough (due to the semi-sweet choc. chips?) so I thoroughly stirred in 1 TB sugar and left it to set.  It was a lovely dark chocolate flavour and I will make it like this again, perhaps using all choc. milk next time. Sometimes I add 1Tb Kahlua to the milk to make a richer flavour.  Thank you for sharing this recipe Kelly.

This was lovely!  I'm trying to cook healthier, less processed things for my family, and this was the perfect alternative to chemical artificial colorings, additives, and preservatives in a box.

I stirred the dry ingredients with a whisk while adding the milk, while the pan was on medium heat.  When everything looked smooth and clump-free, I increased the heat to high, and it thickened right up before it even came to a boil. I added the butter and vanilla and stirred until it incorporated.  I put the pudding in 4 individual serving bowls and put them in the fridge.  Half an hour later it had set up to the perfect consistency.  It did have the skin on top, I did not cover it, but I like it that way.  Husband and 2 teenaged boys said it was great.  Thank you for a healthier option!

Delicious homemade chocolate pudding. I've made this a lot since finding the recipe. Usually I put it into a graham or pastry crust to have "chocolate pie". After refrigerating it's not liquid-y at all. Delish!

Just made this tonight.  It came together quick and I let it cook up slow.  Be patient...it takes about 10 minutes to thicken.  I used brown sugar instead of white and used a tish less cornstarch.  It was sooo yummy.  I can't wait to make this again!

Second time I made this recipe I got a nice thick pudding.  Over med heat I just stirred and stirred until it started to boil (10+ minutes).  Used only 1/3 C sugar which is enough; otherwise followed the recipe.  As I prefer dark chocolate to milk chocolate, I think I will add more cocoa next time.  Very nice recipe and better than those boxed puddings!

For 30 years, I have been using my grandma's old recipe from the 30's that calls for solid unsweetened chocolate but have been having trouble with speckles and flakes that won't dissolve, lately, so I had stopped making pudding. I tried yours to see if a powdered cocoa recipe would come close and it does! I used heaping tablespoons of cocoa since I love the stronger chocolate taste. Thank you for sharing this recipe, Kelly. (if anyone can say why I am just now getting speckles and flakes with the solid, after 30 years, I would love to know. Yes, the chocolate is new and good brand.)

Wow!  I'd never made homemade pudding before.  I was perusing recipes and realized I had all the ingredients on hand to make this pudding.  Yummy!  I licked my bowl clean.  I couldn't even wait for it to cool.  Will be making this again and again!

Wonderful.  Since I have a fear of corn and GMO's, I started using tapioca flour instead of cornstarch and it is just as good.  Thanks for the recipe!

AWESOME***** All my "kids" (which include at least 1/3 of our town!) go crazy when I make this for them. I use a whole gallon of milk and the pudding is gone as soon as it's ready to eat!!!

Pretty yummy! I didn't boil it like the recipe says to, but it thickened up quite nicely despite this. Just make sure that all the dry ingredients are completely stirred into the milk before you turn the heat on or else it will all burn to the bottom of the pan. Rookie cook's mistake I guess. :)

This was very easy to make, but it turned out really thin. It tastes pretty good though; I like it better hot. Overall, this was a great recipe; if I were to make this again, I would add more cocoa powder and stir in some milk chocolate to intensify the flavor.

Thank you for posting this recipe! It replicates the "cornstarch pudding" my mom used to make "by feel" (without a recipe) on Sunday evenings. She died suddenly a few years ago, and until I discovered this recipe, I hadn't been successful in finding a similar-tasting, easy (foolproof, even!) version of this type of home style cooked pudding. I've made it several times and have been happy with the results every time—regardless of whether I used whole milk, one, or two percent (it just depends what I have in the refrigerator). One suggestion for anyone who prefers thick(er) pudding: after bringing the mixture to a,full boil, just continue stirring constantly for a minute or two longer. You will see and feel the difference in the texture, and it will continue to thicken as it cools.

Holy cow! My daughter kept asking for store-bought pudding, and I just couldn't do it. I'm so glad I made this instead: it's just like homemade hot chocolate, but thicker.

I loved the recipe. Reminded me of my Grandmas. But I liked the texture better without the oleo added. It was still good though. various uses possible with both situations. Think a pie filling is possible without the oleo. Not sure. will try that next time.

Made this tonight for a quick and easy dessert for my husband and sons. They LOVED it! I did not make any alterations to the recipe. I read another comment about folding whipped topping into the pudding (once cooled), I will be trying that out on my next batch! The batch I made disappeared in less than five minutes!! Great recipe! Thank you so much for sharing (:

for anyone who complains about it coming out too thin, just replace the milk with 1 part evaporated milk and 1 part water.

So delicious! This was very easy to make. I followed the recipe, except I left out the butter (I didn't think it was necessary.) I did used 1/2% milk. This was so wonderful. It turned out perfectly. I will certainly make this again. Next time, I might try to cut back the cornstarch and the sugar (it was really sweet; not a bad thing at all, but I might try to make it a little "healthier"). Also, I would recommend covering the pudding with plastic wrap right on the surface of the pudding if you refrigerate any. If not covered this way, it will have a thick skin (which some people may not like.) This pudding is so good nice and cold, right from the fridge. Thank you, Kelly, for this yummy recipe!

I wanted to see how well the recipe worked as a pie filling or just pudding and it was wonderful for both! This is a perfect, quick chocolate pudding OR pie filling. Put the pudding in the refrigerator over night for a firmer set! Thank you!

I would have given this five stars execpt for one problem. The recipe says let it boil, some viewers say dont let it boil. I've found that letting it boil is let important than how much it thickens up while it's on the heat. When it gets to a syrupy consistancy and thickly coats the back of the spoon, then remove it from heat, whether it's boiled or not.

this recipe was DIVINE!  I used 1 1/2 cups of milk instead of 2 cups(I made for 3), and it came out nice and thick.  I'll definitely be making this recipe again:)

I whipped this up exactly as described in the recipe.  My son and I enjoyed the pudding warm the first night and my son ate the leftovers the next day cold out of the fridge.  I will never buy boxed pudding again!  This is tasty, cream and preservative-free!!!

Excellent pudding! Much better than box mix. I prepared recipe as written for 8 servings.  I stirred constantly even a few minutes even after boiling to make sure it would be nice and thick.  Yummy!!!

Wow! What a lifesaver! I'd never made pudding before (except from a box). I wanted to make some for a trifle dish. I even had to substitute flour for cornstarch, and it still came out delicious. Thank you so much! I'll never buy pudding cups again, either. :)

such a simple and easy way to make your own homemade pudding... very good both warm and cold... mine did thicken up quite a lot as it cool... if you are planning on eating it cold I think be sure to take it off the stove a little earlier than you would it were at the consistency you want hot.. also cooling too room temperature covered with plastic wrap might be another helpful suggestion...  but either way great flavor... really enjoyable... the only thing I might do is add a little extra cocoa powder to make it a little richer chocolate (I am a dark chocolate lover)... but as is the recipe is definitely not over overpoweringly sweet... great balance and flavor

Thanks for sharing this recipe Kelly. I read some of the reviews and upped the cocoa powder by 1 T to make it 1/4 cup. Kept all else the same and thought it was plenty sweet enough. Took about as long to make as a cook and serve box mix but I could actually pronounce all of the ingredients in this pudding. Plus it used ingredients I had on hand and seems like it could easily be modified to suit other needs (pie filling, cake filling, etc).

This recipe is uber good!  I used 4 tbsp. cocoa since I like a lot of chocolate flavor.  Other than that everything else I left the same.  I topped this with the mixture from the peanut butter cream parfaits recipe on this site for an awesome peanut butter/chocolate combination.

This is quick & easy to whip uo, and absolutely delicious.  Thick and creamy.  Served warm it is to die for with whipped cream on top.  Chocolate-a-holics like me can add some extra cocoa powder when they need that extra kick, or it is incredible just like the recipe says!  Thank you!!!

This was great!  I used a smidge less sugar, and 3 rounded tablespoons of Guittard chocolate, plus I added a tablespoon of Grand Marnier orange liqueur.  I cooked it until it was really good and thick.  Delicious!

This recipe was AMAZING! I adapted it to a vegan friendly recipe by using raw 'turbinado' sugar, a mixtue of coconut and almond milk, and vegan margarine and the flavor and consistency were absolutely PERFECT! This is my new go-to dessert! The best part is that a little goes a long way! I didn't need to over do it to feel satisfied. YUMMY!!

Was very tasty and not difficult at all to make.  I went on the site to find something that didn't need a lot of ingredients for dessert because we were out of eggs.  This was a perfect, cost friendly dessert and we will have it again soon.

OMGoodness this is really, really good.  I had a major sweet tooth & was craving chocolate.  I found this recipe and gave it a try.  I am not disappointed!!  The only thing differend I did was follow the advice of the other reviews and I put in 3 heaping tablespoons of cocoa powder.  I'm sure I'll make this again. :)

This is really 2-1/2 star pudding.  I love the flavor, simplicity and quick prep, but it is very thin.  I refrigerated it, and it just separated.  I modified recipe by increasing the cornstarch to 1/3 cup and reduced the milk by 1/2 cup.  I also began using whole milk instead of 2% so it's thicker, but it still doesn't "gel" to a regular pudding consistency.

Very good recipe, I only made half the recipe (just for me lol) & I really enjoyed it. It's just as good without the full amount of butter as well as skim milk.
A great & healthier alternative to ready made pudding & mixes. (at least you know whats in this one!) lol

Thanks :)

I only gave it four stars because I used playkittenpie's review ideas and my pudding turned out awesome! If your pudding does set up too thick you can more milk if you like. Just whip the pudding with a wire whisk while you add the extra milk. My pudding gave Jello instant chocolate pudding mix a run for it's money!

My 3 1/2 year old and I made this today and it is really yummy! We used special dark cocoa powder other then that we didn't change a thing. I will say it did take waaaay more then 10 min. to cook. Don't rush it. Low and slow, keep stirring and you will be happy. If it didn't thicken up for you my guess is you didn't cook it long enough.  I will be making this again very soon

Oh my goodness!!!   This pudding is amazing!!  I had some Homogenized milk I had to use up and wanted to make pudding....I had no box mixes at home so thought I'd try one try one from scratch. I am so glad I tried this recipe! The chocolate-yness and sweetness are perfect!  I actually tried it before I added the margarine and vanilla and it was good then.  I did have lumps in the final product, but I think that was technique and nothing to do with the recipe (I was scraping the bottom as it cooked - oops). 5 stars for sure - it's delicious!

Delicious!  I was in the mood for some chocolate pudding but stuck inside on a snowy day without a box of Jello Chocolate Pudding.  I took the chance that I could find a recipe online, it looked easy, so I decide to take the challenge.  I loved it and it was so very easy too!

five stars. I am never going to buy cook and serve boxed pudding again. I like to make pudding cause I have a hard time finishing a gallon of milk but didn't have any pudding in the house tonight. I remebered I had a recipe in my box. OH NO! While writing down the recipe I forgot to write in how much milk. So I googled chocolate puuding and up popped this recipe. It was so easy to make.And much creamier and tastier than the boxed pudding I have been using all my life. Which by the way does not taste as good as it did when I was little anymore. So now I am hooked on this recipe. YUMMMM!

Really delicious!  I made it as written; it wasn't quite thick enough for my hubs & my taste.  Next time I'll add a bit more cornstarch.  The sugar we use (apparently) has more water in it than granulated sugar, so this may have a big impact.  The chocolate flavor was excellent; if you like uber sweet, up the sugar.  I made this for a friend who had a wisdom tooth removed and was kinda scared about giving it to her (cause I burned it a lil . . .oops!), but it tasted alright even though it was a bit burned.  It was still delicious and we ate the leftovers really quickly!!  :)  Thanks for this great recipe!

OUTSTANDING. Just like I remembered as a child. Very easy and quick. I used the Hersey's Special Dark coco with three heaping teaspoons and just a little more cornstarch since I like puddings to be firmer. I let the pudding cool off outside on my porch. Next time I will double the recipe for a benefit dinner next week.

A very nice pudding recipe. Great as is, or add an egg yolk for a little extra richness. I used farm fresh milk and homemade butter, as well as a high quality dutch cocoa, and the taste was simply decadent.

This is such an easy easy recipe that yields such great results. My mother-in-law used to make this for my husband when he was a little kid. He said it reminded him of being a little kid again and those small simple pleasures. I'm gonna put this on my list of my little ones too. A definite favorite!

This recipe is so quick and simple and the results are great! For a more intense flavour, I added extra coffee and chocolate and I also used non-fat milk to make it healthier. The ultimate low-fat dessert!

Excellent taste, creamy texture, easy to make--a keeper!  The butter and vanilla really mellow the chocolate flavor--do not be tempted to skip these ingredients!  As noted by others, I dissolved the cornstarch in cold milk and the thickness was perfectly creamy.

I was looking for something like my grandmother used to make, and I know she used cocoa and corn starch. This is very good, but it doesn't seem as rich. Then again, perhaps my judgement is hazed by nostalgia. I used evaporated milk, as I believe she did. I will probably make it again with more cocoa.

Maybe it's because I use whole milk, but the first couple times I made the recipe it came out too thick & gelatinous for my liking. However, with a few modifications, this is the BEST chocolate pudding I have ever eaten! I add an extra tablespoon of chocolate and cut the cornstarch in half to 1/8 of a cup and it comes out rich, smooth, amazing. Cutting the cornstarch in half makes softer & creamier, very similar to the texture of "instant" pudding (which I like). I have good results using a wire whisk (no lumps) and then refrigerating it overnight before serving. Thanks so much for posting!

Made this today because I was craving something sweet. I changed the sugar from 1/2 a cup to 3/4 and it was perfect for me. Also did 3 heaping tablespoons. The taste was perfect it's just that I assume I wasn't stirring enough, but the whole bottom of my pot had a black crust on it that was hard to remove. Probably just a fault on my behalf. Love the pudding though. Also, after refrigerating, it's a bit water and lumpy in consistency, but a bit of stirring for a minute or two fixes that up.

Amazing and just what I was looking for. Since I can't have milk I substituted soy milk and it was still creamy and fantastic. Sometimes I don't add the chocolate, and put in a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg, and then add some cooked rice and you have a delicious rice pudding!

I *thought* I had one of the best choc pudding recipe in town - - - but hubby felt it was a little *too* chocolaty.  This one is just perfect.  I used 3 level T of cocoa, which was not quite enough, so I ended up grating a little bittersweet chocolate into it after removing from heat.  I also substituted coffee extract for the vanilla (I love the way coffee enhances the flavor).  Outstanding.
UPDATE: Dropped to 4 (sorry) - texture of pudding when chilled is rather disappointing - too *cornstarchy* - if eating warm, very good .... alas

Delicious!  Just as easy as from a box, and so much better!  It was thick, creamy and had a rich chocolate flavor.  I used a whisk to stir it while it was heating and had no lumps.  I also realized that I only had about 2 cups of milk after I had started and it still came out great!  I will definitely make this recipe again and my try freezing it as pudding pops this summer!

I just can't seem to make pudding thick. *Sigh* It was more like chocolate soup.   The flavor was still great though, so I might try it again.

This is good. Very tasty and had everything I needed on hand. I don't know what I did wrong (I sifted my ingredients, and stirred the whole time) but I ended up with a few lumps. I ran it through a small mesh strainer after it was done cooking, and that took care of it. Next time I will make sure my daughter is handy because I thought my arm would fall off (I made a double batch). LOL

Fantastic--Make sure you blend all of the dry ingredients to get it nice & smooth.  Although, I like a few lumps because then I know it is homemade!! :)

I was craving something chocolaty and comforting and this did the trick.  I was was very happy with the smooth texture of this pudding but I can't help but wonder how good it would be if I added about a quarter of a cup of chocolate chips with the butter and vanilla at the end.  I'll try it next time.  Loved it and so did my husband.

This was great. I love chocolate, and took the suggestions of some other reviewers and added more to the recipe--I would advise against that, at least the first time. While I loved the pudding, mine came out a bit too strong the first time out. The consistency, however, was perfect, and I appreciated that I didn't need any eggs, so I could keep this relatively low in fat (using margarine and skim milk).

was craving something chocolatey - saw this recipe and had to try it.  I paired it with the crunch of the Vanilla Crispies recipe from this site as well.I am so glad I did!  Very easy, creamy and delicious!  I won't ever have to buy a box pudding again!  Thanks so much for sharing!

perfectly delicious, and super easy. I used some of the hot pudding (just before boil) to add to a cup of hot milk with vanilla extract to make a hot chocolate drink. mixed to a ratio of half milk, half pudding....Just lovely. A good way to get some calcium!

Great recipe I remembered from my childhood.  I increased the sugar and cornstarch slightly.  I beat two egg yolks, and added some of the hot chocolate mixture (before it thickened completely).  I added the egg yolk/chocolate mixture back into the thickening pudding.  It makes the pudding a little more custard-like.  I also increased the butter for a slightly richer flavor.    I made a double batch and it is long gone.

This was a very easy recipe for those who have a chocolate pudding craving now and again. So much better than boxed. I actually made with 1% milk and it was still creamy and thick (with a bit less fat, for those who care about that!).

So good! Followed recipe except I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon-just love chocolate with it.  Thickened up wonderfully- you have to bring mixture just barely to a boil. So glad I tried this instead of buying a box!

This is so creamy!  As my son says, it tastes like hot chocolate.  Homemade is so much better than boxed.  Thanks for sharing.  UPDATE:  This also  makes a wonderful vanilla pudding.  Because I left out the cocoa powder, I took out 3 TB of sugar.  It was the perfect sweetness. Yummy!  5 stars for vanilla too.

made this recipe exactly as written and as a chocolate pudding it is excellent! trouble is, i wanted it as a chocolate pie filling and found it too runny for that even when i chilled it for 24hours. wonder how the others managed to get it to firm up?

Mmmmmm.....just lovely!! My "Ouma" (Granny in Afrikaans) taught me to make this pudding. The only thing I do differently is to add 1 or 2 Tblspns of brandy and, of course, the butter. I have also made the pudding with 1 cup less milk and, once cold, folded in 1 cup of whipped cream. No matter how you prefer it though, you can't go wrong with this pudding as my daughter has also been making it since she was 10yrs old.

AMAZING!!!!  Best chocolate pudding ever!!!  the butter really makes the difference!!  I followed the recipes exactly, and it turned out perfectly.  Once it starts boiling, it does thicken very quickly, so make sure you keep an eye on it!  Really good with sliced bananas or with coconut.  Even passed my picky daughter's test!  She has never liked homemade pudding!  Thanks for such an easy, fast, and delicious recipe!!  Your mom would be proud!

I tripled this recipe, yes tripled, and it turned out great.  I only had 2% milk and margerine so next time I'm going to use whole milk with some half and half, and real butter to make it richer but it was very easy and delicious this first time making it.  My husband had never tasted homemade pudding and was blown away with the taste.  He may eat all of it by himself in one night if I don't hide some in the freezer soon, LOL!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Much better than store bought! The second time I made it, I used brown sugar and doubled the cocoa. I also reduced the cornstarch, so it doesn't go solid when it cools.

I loved this recipe!  I followed another user's suggestion and used 1/2C brown sugar and heaping tbs of cocoa powder.  The pudding turned out great!  I cannot seem to stop myself from "sampling" it every time I'm near the fridge!

This was a very easy recipe and my family like it.  I was a little hesitant about putting so much cornstarch in, so I reduced it by half.  The texture was very creamy.  However, it didn't thicken up as much as I'd hoped.  I will definitely put more cornstarch in next time.

Used double the cocoa and vanilla, as per suggestions, and the flavor was spot on. The texture is still a little thin, even using full-fat milk and simmering it for a while. Still, the flavor was so good noone cared.

Great recipe!  I used 4 tablespoons of cocoa, and left out the butter and vanilla- no need for the added fat.

OMG I am in shock!! I was craving chocolate and searched for a recipe to use what I had on hand. I didn't even have any milk! Made this with 2 cups water instead and added an extra tablespoon of cocoa powder...it came out delicious!! Like fudge! I really am so suprised how good and easy this was! Some whipped cream on top would make it even better :)

This was pretty good, but turned out lumpy (probably because I have a hard time controlling the temperature on my gas stove). I may try more cocoa next time for a deeper chocolatey taste.

This was very tasty. I followed others suggestions and added extra coco powder but it wasn't enough chocolate flavor for me. Next time I will add more coco and omit the butter and vanilla, it took away from the flavor. I served my pudding with sand on top. Everyone loved it.

This was a great pudding to make and eat!  Quick and easy and used everything I already had on hand.  The only change I made was to use regular Splenda instead of real sugar and you couldn't tell the difference!  Great for a late night snack!

VERY GOOD!  I had no idea it could be so easy to make pudding from scratch.  I used 2% milk and it turned out wonderful.  It only took minutes.  Thank you Kelly for such a terrific recipe.

Delicious. I used some evaporated milk as one reviewer suggested and half brown sugar. i made the mistake of boiling the butter and vanilla with everything else but i don't htink it made a difference. this is great - i am eating it and it hasn't even cooled yet. great recipe.

The taste of this pudding was amazing.  I couldn't get enough.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I did get lumps though. I'm not sure if I had it on too high.  It took FOREVER to boil. Or if my constarch clumped.  I loved it though....lumps and all.

Super tasty! I didn't know making homemade pudding would be so easy. I really am not a fan of the plainness and boring old pudding. But I really like this recipe! We may just be eating pudding a bit more often! Although, I will have to find out how to alter this for different flavors... =)

Lovely pudding that DOESN'T have that annoying jiggly chocolate pudding pie texture! The only thing is, you should add a little more cocoa, the original recipe doesn't have quite enough.

I've had this problem with puddings where my cornstarch clumps into lumps( lol) so what I did this time was dissolve it in water first. well, I would do milk next time, and cook the pudding longer after it has reached boiling...it became watery after sitting in the fridge. used 2 TB  brown sugar, 1 TB nutella, and 2 TB cocoa, no butter. will try this again cause taste was right.

I wasn't crazy about the flavor of this recipe.  The flavor was more on the line of my mothers chocolate fudge. Not the pudding flavor I was looking for. Maybe I have had the box kind for too long. I will say I have only tried this warm so far.

This was ok. The one in my old betty crocker cookbook is better. The key to success with this recipe is the way you cook it...keep stirring to prevent lumps.

I just looked around on the internet and I wanted a recipe that used cocoa because that's what I had on hand (didn't have any chocolate bars).  I gave some to my husband and he said it was much better than like Jello pudding out of the box.  My brother said he wouldn't be able to tell the difference between this pudding and Jello out of the box or off the refrigerated section already made up; but I disagree; I think he would be able to tell the difference.  I liked the pudding a little too much; ate one yesterday and one today.  I think it would make a good pie filling too!  This is a keeper.

way too sweet! Should have listened to the reviewer that said make as stated rather than reduce the cornstarch. I quadrupled the recipe and used half the recommended amount of cornstarch as some reviewers had said. 

I was simultaneously making Fannie Farmer's Blanc Mange and was amazed at how quickly it set up. It had a lot more cornstarch in it. So I kept mixing a Tbsp of sugar w/a Tbsp of cornstarch. I had to add another 3-4 Tbsp of each to get it to begin to set. 

I think this would be perfect as the recipe states rather than altering it by reducing the cornstarch. Will try again as is written.

The texture can be odd...  It is delicious for the most part though.  VERY difficult not to have clumps though.  Be sure to whisk it constantly as it thickens.

Delish!

I don't keep cornstarch on hand, so I used 1/2 cup of flour to thicken it. I ran out of vanilla making French Toast this morning, but next time I make this I will use it. Because I only had salted butter in the house (grocery store mishap), I omitted the salt the recipe asked for.

I had high hopes for this, but it turned out to be just mediocre.  It definitely tasted better the second day, and it certainly was easy.  However, despite the fact that I stirred constantly, there were still some lumps that caused a bitter aftertaste.  (Most likely the cocoa or cornstarch.)  While this was easy to prepare, I honestly think it's just as easy to use the cook and serve mix (i.e. Mighty Fine brand) from a box.  Sadly, I probably won't make this again.

The flavor of this pudding was really good, exactly what I was looking for but my pudding came out a bit soupy.  It could have been my mistake b.c I've never made this before, but next time I will reduce the amount of milk by 1/4 cup and see if that does the trick! Thanks!

This is so easy and so versatile. Brown sugar instead of white is an awesome, necessary substitution. If you want vanilla pudding, use the same recipe -- omit the cocoa powder and increase the vanilla extract to 1 TABLESPOON. You cannot go wrong!

i cooked it and stirred constantly, it did get thick - slightly too thick and although i stirred the cocoa powder first to get the clumps out, my pudding still had lumps in it.  i even slightly reduced the cornstarch Basically a good recipe, but i prefer it to be a little smoother.

This was a good recipe, nice and better than boxed, but I will try the changes that kittenpie suggested.  It did seem a little starchy and the brown sugar may give it a deeper flavor.  When I make it again like that, I will update.

Flavor was nice.  I did substitute part of the milk for some half n half I had on hand.  Was nice and thick, but once it set up it was more like a jello jiggler than pudding.

My daughter (11) requested homemade chocolate pudding for her family birthday dinner.  I've never made it before.  But I will make it again!  Great recipe.  Everyone loved it.  And so easy.  What more could you ask for?!  I did add about 2 tsp extra cocoa per other reviews.  Yummy!

This is perhaps the easiest, yummiest pudding. It isn't as rich as some of the other cooked pudding recipes, but it has never failed me, tastes good hot or cold and is SO much better than instant!

So much better than instant, you can't even compare.  Next time I will try with evaporated milk to make even creamier.  I liked this better when it was first made and hot, but that is just the way I remember it as a kid.  I pour a little cold milk on the top before eating, don't know why - that's just how we did it.  Super easy!

I have found my new chocolate pudding recipe!  This rocks!  My mother in law made homemade chocolate pudding for my husband growing up, and he's been begging me to try it.  I've been through several recipes, and each time couldn't figure out what was supposed to be so great about homemade pudding.  Well, now I know!  I'll never buy a box again!  We topped the warm pudding with fresh whipped cream and felt like we were eating gourmet!
Thank you for posting!

First time making homemade pudding.  Yum!  I disagree with the person who thought it wasn't "pretty" cold... I stirred the skin into it before I put it in the fridge and I thought it looked great!  Definitely not a recipe for someone in a hurry - get a stool to do the stirring!  But it's worth it.  Thanks!

This was pretty good. I had some young guests over and they enjoyed the pudding made into a popsicle-- but it was not good two days later. Pretty gross actually. I don't know what happened with that, but I may still use this as a pudding recipe.

Good pudding, but it kinda tastes like the jello kind that comes in a box.

Great Pudding!! SO much better than the boxed mix, and not really that time consuming or hard to make from scratch. Did like it better warm, but cold it was still very good. YUM YUM!!

As I was gathering the ingredients for the pudding I realized I had a rolled pie crust and some heavy cream in the refrigerator, so I decided to make a chocolate cream pie.  The pudding for the filling turned out to be very good, but I didn't really get any comments on the finished pie.  The consistency of the pudding was stiff enough that it kept its shape when slices of the pie were cut.  I think this would probably be better as just pudding, since the crust and whipped cream seemed to cut down on the chocolate flavor.

Brilliant!  I wasn't sure how it's supposed to come out... I've never had chocolate pudding before believe it or not (I'm Asian) :o)

But my sister who's studied abroad told me they were real good.  Thank you so much Kelly... I changed a tiny thing though... used about 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and diluted it in a 1/2 cup of water :o) I know that's not why it tasted *great* Thanx again!

Mmm we loved this!  I had no idea that homeade pudding was so easy to make.  I will definitely make this again - but I think next time I will reduce the amount of sugar marginally as DH and I found this just a tad too sweet.  The addition of butter at the end gives the pudding a nice glossy finish.  Thanks Kelly!

First: I tossed in a couple of ounces of Jack Daniels which gave this a marvellous tone! Also: 1. Low or near-no fat if made with 1% milk! 2. Forget the 4 servings nonsense - serve it in ramekins (makes 11 servings)and feel so smart eating two at once! 3. For a chocolate pudding lover this is marvelous! 4. This is SO easy to make!

Yum, yum, yum!  Followed recipe exactly and it came out perfect!  I'm a huge fan already of the cook and serve boxed version, but I think I like this even better...  you don't get that chemical aftertaste.  I make a double batch to pour over cake for scrumptious pudding poke cake.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

Very tasty, rich puddding.  I prefer dark, dark chocolate so this wasn't the ultimate, I will add more cocoa and less sugar next time.  It did get quite thick the next day, so less cornstarch will be used next time.  It was good and creamy...very enjoyable.

This is the best homemade recipe for pudding that I've found, but I still prefer a pudding snack pack to this recipe. I will be making this again if I have a craving for warm chocolate pudding. This recipe is really good served warm.

Pretty good. It was very easy and I had all the ingredients on hand, which made it even easier. I do think it needs to be a bit more sweet.

I made this for a pudding pie.  I used heaping tablespoons of chocolate and the brown sugar tips suggested by others.  It was very good even though I forgot to add the butter and vanilla.  It was really thick so if you want it to be creamier use less cornstarch.
