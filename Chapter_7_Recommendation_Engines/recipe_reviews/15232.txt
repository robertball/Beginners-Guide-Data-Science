Good results!

As a culinary student I've tried and failed with bread many times before getting some decent results.  Here's what I've found that may help:  
1) Proof your yeast as directed (mixing water, yeast, & sugar)-- if it doesn't start bubbling or frothing after 10 min, throw it out.  Either the yeast is dead (check expiration date) Or you killed it with HOT tap water > 120 degrees F kills yeast.  Optimal temp is LUKE warm around 100F.   
2) Mist the bread with water every 3 min for the first 10 min.  Why?  This does 3 things.  Prevents the crust from forming too fast thus restricting the rising process.  It moisens the crust just enough so it doesn't brown/burn at the end of the baking period - you get a golden brown instead of a dark heavy crust.  And it  finally makes the crust crispier.  This is a very important step.  It also helps if you have a bowl of water in the oven to increase the humidity percentage.  Professional ovens have adjustable humidity controls which add moisture in.  Why only 10 min?  You can mist for longer but you'll end up with a thin white crust instead of golden brown.  Once the bread has risen to its full potential (within the 1st 10 min or so depending on the size of the loaf), then you want  it to start becoming golden brown.

Baking is regarded as being harder than cooking because of the exactness in ratios of the ingredients. 
Hope some of my hard lessons learned helps you -- Best of luck!

This recipe was awesome! I skipped the bread machine business and made it by hand...the dough was sticky but it worked well  enough, just start the yeast in the warm water for a few minutes before throwing in the rest of the ingredients. Instead of loaves I made rolls and they turned out great. I also added 3 tablespoons of dried rosemary to the dough which made all the difference. They were a huge hit with my kids, my daughter told me they tasted just like the bread at our favorite Italian food place and she was right! Misting the dough during baking with a spray bottle is a MUST. Don't skip this step, it's what makes the crust so crispy.

Wonderful recipe ~ so easy.  Everytime I make it I get rave reviews!!  

Easy hint, use spatula to scrape out of breadmaker onto a heavily floured board.  Then use a metal scraper to scrape/scoop/lift the floured dough into a rectangle and then plop onto a silpat/greased cookie sheet.  This is a rustic bread so it will be chewy with large holes.  You really can't use your hands, they'll goo up and you won't be able to handle it.  Develop the lift and fold over technique with the scraper and it'll be a breeze.

I was really nervous about this recipe after reading how runny it could be but I followed the directions exactly and it turned out fabulous. Yes it was runny, yes I had a real hard time getting a bowl around it cuz it just ran out on the wooden board I used. Yes it got stuck all over my fingers. And yes I put too much flour on the baking sheets. But it turned out to be the best ciabatta bread I have ever tasted.  WELL WORTH THE WORK.

I've been looking for a good hamburger bun recipe and this is it. I dump it all in an oiled boil over a pan of boiling water in the oven for an hour after the initial 15 minute relax. With floured hands I form 5 flatten balls, roll them in sesame seeds, spray them to keep them moist and let them rest again while the oven heats (usually for 20 minutes). I spray them at three minutes and 6 minutes and leave the pan of water underneath while they bake. They are perfect, way better than anything you can buy! Thanks for sharing!

I have made many, many loaves of bread using the bread machine to start the dough. The first batch yielded 2 baguettes; I could not get 2 13x14 loaves out of the dough. The 2nd batchThat I made this evening yielded a pool of dough. Anyone know what I did wrong?

I have baked about one to five loaves of bread a week for 40 years. This is a great loaf of bread. For those who had trouble with the dough being too runny, these suggestions: Use only bread flour as called for in the recipe; AP flour does not absorb as much water. Secondly, measuring flour for bread differs from measuring for cake or cookies (sifted or stirred & fluffed) because bread bakers "feel" the dough while they knead in the flour. Air humidity can also affect the moisture. Just lightly scoop the flour, but if the dough is truly runny, add flour a tablespoon at a time after the first five minutes of kneading until it no longer runny but is still quite wet. Keep in mindd the this bread is meant to spread out into a fairly flat loaf. It's other name is "Italian Slipper Bread." Making bread is a sight & feel process, even in the bread machine.

I made the dough in my bread machine. I poured the bread on to parchment paper and watched the dough run in every direction. I've been making bread for years and have never seen a recipe so far off base. And yes, I measured every thing correctly.

This is a great recipe - excellent bread. Instead of making two loaves, I made one and buns out of the remainder of the dough.  Only cooked the buns for 13 minutes.  One of the best bread machine recipes I've seen.  Certainly will make this a lot!

Great recipe! I discovered (quite by accident) that you can eliminate a step in this recipe. When the bread machine is done, just leave the dough in the machine for an extra 20 minutes instead of taking them out. This keeps it from being handled too much and keeps the flour down. I do it this way all the time now!

This bread is so delicious! I made this with proofing yeast, warm water, sugar, and olive oil. I also added 2T of fresh minced rosemary. I slowly added the flour and salt, kneaded and let it rest for 15 minutes, then let it rise for an hour. The dough is sticky and somewhat gooey but as the submitter stated, "resist the temptation to add more flour".  I placed a pan filled with water on the lowest oven rack to increase the humidity for the bread. Instead of dividing the dough into 2 small pieces I kept it one large size. I placed the bread on a parchment paper and baked the bread at 450 degrees for 25 minutes. After the first 10 mins of baking, I spritzed the bread with water every 3 mins a few times. This helps to achieve the nice golden color and crusty bread topping. The wonderful aroma of bread baking made my mouth water and I couldn't wait to eat the bread right out from the oven. The bread baked up beautifully into one large round shape. The top was an even golden brown color. I just had to cut myself a nice warm piece of bread. This is a nice, simple, rustic style bread. The outside is crispy while the inside is soft and tasty. This bread recipe is good as is and I don't see a need to change any ingredients or measurements. This complemented my juicy steak, "Balsamic Mushrooms", and "Roasted Tomatoes with Garlic", also from this site. I used the bread to soaked up all the fresh juices from the tomatoes and mushrooms and steak. My family ate up the entire bread!

Mystery Solved! I think I solved the reason for the wide differences in quality results in the reviews. Use ALL PURPOSE FLOUR not bread flour in the recipe.It gives you a much firmer dough using exactly the same 31/4 cups of flour.  Bread flour gives you a runny self- leveling dough that spread out and will not keep the loaf shape you make it into.Using a cookie sheet to contain the dough from flowing over in your oven it will give you a baked loaf about one inch high.  My second try I used all purpose flour,the same amount,31/4 cup.I could form a slipper shape loaf. Hope this helps.

Awesome recipe! I actually did everything in my bread machine using the French bread cycle, and it came out perfect.  I did add about 2 tsp of yeast, and a half a cup more of flour from taking the others´ advice, but my bread machine did everything, and NO MESS!!  The French bread cycle lets it rise a little longer, and I even extended it by 20 min. in the rise cycle, chose dark crust and extended that by 20 mins. as well.  It came out perfect and I am scared to make it again, it´s to irresistible so we have been eating it non-stop!  THANKS FOR A GREAT RECIPIE!!!

Have to try this again. Maybe I would put the loaf a few minutes shorter in the oven. Because mine got a pretty tough crust.

I've tried this recipe 2 times.  With different batches of yeast.  This is too runny for Ciabatta and does not rise enough. I've made Ciabatta before and dough is wet, but not this wet.

I made w/o bread machine--here's how: mix warm water, sugar, yeast, and oil.  Let sit until foamy.  Then add flour and salt, mix in KitchenAid with dough hook for a few minutes and continue with step 2 in recipe.  (used 1 1/2 tsp. active dry yeast instead of bread machine yeast, and included 3 TBSP vital wheat gluten in 3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour instead of bread flour) Both loaves turned out beautifully--going to try w/ paninis tonight!

Big hit with the family!  Thank you for the excellent recipe.  I have been experiementing with this recipe and found that the dough is a lot less sticky and easier to deal with when using cold water (from fridge) instead of room temperature.  The bread also turned out much softer on the inside with this method. I also brushed the loaves with water every 5 minutes which made the crust more tough and chewy. I also baked at 425 for the first 15 minutes and then 475 for the last 10.  During the last 10 minutes I brushed each loaf with olive oil and continued to brush with water every 5.  Everyone loved it and my husband said I should stop making other breads and just make this one only!  Thanks again! 5 Solid Stars *****

Simple no nonsense bread. 

I found that if you spritz the bread too soon while it's in the oven, it stops the bread from rising while baking. So wait 10 minutes or so before spritzing.

I made this as directed in my Zojirushi.  I let the dough rest for 15 minutes in the machine and then poured the dough into 2 well oiled 9-inch cake pans.  I then sprayed cooking spray on top of the dough and covered with greased plastic wrap for the rise time.  I baked about 25 mins with a pan of water on the bottom oven shelf.  I didn't spray the dough.  Turned out two round, fairly even, inch and half high loaves.  I sliced the loaves flat across and filled with deli meat and cheese.  Sandwiches for a crowd!  Will use again and again.

My hubby loves this bread (so do I).  I use 1 1/4 cups whole wheat flour and 2 cups bread flower.  It makes the dough easier to work with and adds to the nutritional value.  It is great for paninis.

Wow, this is good!  I make a lot of homemade bread, so it takes a lot to impress me, but this bread is great.  Yes, it's really sticky, but it bakes up beautifully.  I made this to take to a potluck goodbye for a friend and was going to bring both loaves, but I'm only going to take one loaf now!  This is great for eating with butter, with bruschetta (what I made it for) and with some oil as dipping. Plus, it's super easy and I'm sure would be easy to double since it makes pretty small loaves.  I definitely plan on making this again!  Thanks for the recipe!

great & versatile recipe, marina. thx a million.


CAN'T TOUCH THIS?
my breadmaker took 2hrs and 20min to yield a blob with half the flour on it still untouched. still wonder why...


BEATING THE STICKY PART
undeterred, i scooped out the mysterious mud onto a lightly floured surface. by dusting my hands in flour on and off, i bypassed the sticky part altogether to form 8 awesome buns.


THE PAN'S INCOGNITO
here's how to bypass the reported "bowl-size issue": cover the pan with a teatowel and send it incognito (oven power off). drafts will be wondering "where is cognito?"


BOWL IN THE OVEN
took the culinary student's advice re the boiling water bowl. good idea. just remember to add salt in the water. why? c'mon. no rain, no rainbow. no salt, no steam :-)


ADD-ONS
i'll also take some other chefs' advice about adding garlic or olives or both next time.

HEADLINE NEWS
thx for your reviews everybody. this ciabatta became an instant classic in my family. Greek Lover Boy has the story...

hasta la vista, baby.

My husband loves ciabatta rolls for making sandwiches.  We usually buy them at BJ's.  Thought I would try my hand at this recipe because in the reviews 2 important words kept coming up.  1. Delicious 2. Easy.
I doubled the recipe and made it in my kitchenaid mixer and followed the directions exactly exept for the dimpling of the bread... After I got it in the oven I looked up dimpling and it said to make dimples by making indentions with your fingers... Well I apparently "docked" the bread.... making holes with a fork... Nonetheless, it came out very nicely!  Tasty!!  Easy!!  Husband gave it five stars and he would definitely let me know if it wasn't up to snuff.  Thanks Marina for the great recipe...  :) Will make again for sure!  UPDATE!  ok now I have made almost every ciabatta bread recipe that I have found at all interesting.  I keep coming back to this one.  My husband also likes this one the best.  I usually add a little rosemary that I have growing outside...  This bread is great for dipping too!

This was a great recipe! First time I made it and it was delicious! I used a food processor with the dough blade. It worked great and it was a lot quicker than a bread machine. I also added garlic/chili coarse kosher salt on the top before I baked it. Amazing!!! I can't wait to make it again!

There's a reason it's called "artisan" bread.  Even with a bread machine, baking bread is an art.  You can't just dump everything in the bread machine & expect perfect results.  All bread recipes should give flour measurements by weight or as a range when measured by volume.  Even though the bread machine helps with the physical work of bread-making, you're still responsible for making sure the dough is right by adjusting the flour accordingly.  Flour requirements will vary based on weather conditions.  During the initial knead, look at the dough to make sure it's forming a nice smooth ball, not a gummy mess and add more flour if needed.  This recipe makes a nice loaf if you pay a little attention to the dough in the beginning.

This is one of the first bread recipies I tried years ago. I use this for my home made Schlotzsky's substitusky bread.  Just pour batter into a cake pan or individual springform pans for smaller size.  Yum.

This is a good recipe...
Haven't tried yet in combination with creating the sponge first . I am going to make the sponge, then finish the dough using the bread machine, & this recipe. I make most of my own bread, & for gifts, too. The reviews here were helpful. 
Rodney Dowdle April 9 2006 is an excellent review with excellent suggestions.
I will be back to let you know of my version results.

GREAT BREAD! I was pleasantly surprised with how well this bread turned out. I used it to make sandwiches for dinner and it was a huge hit. I followed the recipe exactly, and did not have an issue w/ it being too wet or runny at all.  It was a nice, simple, rustic style bread. I can totally see enjoying slices of this with an infused dipping oil, and that's exactly what I plan to do with it next time~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This bread is the best.  A lot of work is taken out by the machine and I can still keep my hands in, if you will, by only using the dough cycle.  I will say that I put a round cake pan full of water in the oven rather than spritzing as it was easier.  It freed me up to do other things.

Again, great bread.

I printed this recipe to use for homemade bruschetta. There is a restaurant here that uses Ciabatta for their Bruschetta, but the loaves are a lot smaller (about the size of my hand spread) and the shape is rectangular. I also bought some in the grocery store and they were the exact same as that restaurant's. I was sucked into this recipe because of how quick and easy it is, but it really didn't taste as "authentic" as the ones I have purchased. I made 4 rectangular loaves and baked it for only 20 minutes. They came out poofier than I expected. I spritzed my loaves every 5 mins as suggested, and they came out with a nice golden crust. The bread was very good. I think I will have to use a recipe that calls for a starter being made the day ahead if I want the taste I am going for. Thank you for the recipe - it really is a nice tasting white bread.

This recipe does produce a nice bread but I did have some handling problems as others have mentioned.  The only way I've found to combat it is to work with cold dough.
  
I mix the dough and allow it to proof a little bit, maybe 7-12 minutes.  I cover and put in the fridge for about 4-6 hours, guess you could keep it in there longer.  

While the dough is still cold I separate and shape my loaves on floured parchment paper.  Middle knuckles down I spread starting at the center, making sure not to over dimple/flatten as you'll get a tighter cell structure resulting in the chewiness some people complain about.

While shaping/dimpling I have a pan of boiling water in my cold oven, making a mini proofer.  I put the loaves in the oven and proof them for 10-15 minutes,  it depends on many variables... you've just gotta watch it rise.  

Once they're done proofing I take them out of the oven and turn on the heat, leaving the pan of water at the bottom.  Pop any large air bubbles, pea sized and smaller I leave.

Put them in the oven and spritz them with water once at around 3-5 minutes in and the other at 8-10.  

Over complicated but my results are consistent, great recipe.

Sometimes, it still amazes me what kinds of things I can make at home by following a really good recipe.  This turned out just perfectly.  Great for sandwiches, making garlic bread, or with just butter and jam.  I used AP flour because I was out of bread flour, and it still turned out great.  Because this was so simple, with hardly any hands on time, I will be making it often.

I don't have a bread machine, so I do this the old-fashioned way.  I dissolve the sugar in warm water and then add the yeast till it foams. Then add the remaining ingredients.  It is quite sticky to work with, but well worth it.  Thanks for a great recipe!

As a novice baker, I found this recipe to be very easy. It turned out great the very first time. Reading the reviews, it seems that the "loose" texture of the dough is a problem for some people. I found that you need to really flour the surface-- I used parchment paper-- that you pour the dough onto so it doesn't stick. Then after the second rise, I sprinkled some flour on the top of the dough and sort of rolled it around so that all of the dough was covered in flour and there was no problem with it sticking to anything at that point! When I formed the loaves, I sort of twisted one of them and left the other one. The one I twisted came out much fluffier than the other one. I also did the spritzing every 3-5 minutes. WOW- it came out so yummy! Just like from an artisan bakery. I was totally impressed with myself! and the recipe, too! :)

DO THIS AND YOUR DOUGH WILL BE EASY TO WORK WITH!!! I made this bread yesterday to serve with baked ziti.  I ended up kneading it by hand (proofing water, yeast, and sugar for ten minutes till foamy then adding salt, oil, and flour then kneading for 10 minutes).  The dough was not too sticky as I was kneading.  Then I put it in a big bowl with a little olive oil in it and rolled it around to cover all sides.  The key here is that I did it in the MORNING so I covered the bowl with plastic wrap and put it in the refridgerator for the day until I came home at around 4 and it rose a bunch.  My dough was not sticky or runny because it was cold.  All I had to do was let it out of the bowl, punch it down and split into two loaves, dimple and lightly flour (I didn't do the 15 min rest time since it spent so much time in the fridge).  I let it rise covered in the oven for an hour then cooked it spraying with water every few minutes for the first ten minutes then baking normally.  It turned out PERFECT and it was SOOO easy!!! I definitely recommend letting it rise in the fridge.  ENJOY! PS: eat this bread with a bowl of olive oil mixed with italian seasoning and pepper.  It's awesome!

I really wish I had read the reviews of the people who rated this recipe 1-star because it seems as though I have the same problem.  This dough is incredibly sticky and it is impossible to work with.  I managed to get it split into 2 pieces and onto the pan, I covered with a clean tea towel as I always do when making bread and even though I floured the bread, the towel completely stuck and deflated.  It would not rise again and I ended up throwing the whole batch in the garbage.  I really have no idea how some people have had such great results....for me, this was just a complete waste of ingredients.

This is not a review - I'm just trying it for the first time and hoping someone could respond with advice.  My bread machine dough cycle is 1 1/2 hr long including 2 rising cycles.  I'm wondering if I should take it out after the initial mixing and follow the recipe from there or go the 1 1/2 hr in the machine and then add the separate "rising times" in the recipe.  Any input is appreciated!  Thanks..

Very Good!  This bread came out wonderful!  I took the advice of other reviewers and spritzed my bread while it was baking. I did it every 7 minutes.  I also added some fresh rosemary and that gave it a wonderful aroma! I can't wait for hubby to get home so we can have a glass of wine and dip this bread into olive oil with oregano in it.  Some reviewers complained of this bread being too sticky.  It was somewhat sticky & wet, but not overly so.  Came out perfect!

This has now turned into my go to recipe for rolls.  The dough bakes up just beautiful and makes the perfect roll for sandwiches...light yet with a beautiful crispy top.  The dough is quite sticky and I am glad that I have resisted adding extra flour, because I think that is what makes this such delicious bread.  This is a definite keeper for such easy and beautiful results!

While looking for a bread to go with seafood bisque, I came across this recipe.  I followed it exactly and couldn't have been more pleased.  I hardly had to touch the dough as it dumped easily onto the floured board and I covered it.  I used a knife to cut it in half and once again it was pleasant to work with.  The taste was perfect as the crust was very crunchy and crisp.  It was just perfect for our soup.  It would also make a great dipping bread as Christina stated.  This is definitely a keeper amongst my recipes!   Thank you Marina for sharing!

I made this last weekend, and although the texture was fantastic (crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside), the bread couldn't stand alone. It needed to be a little sweeter or something. Next time I think I'll try to add more olive oil and sugar in the dough, and maybe take the suggestion below to add dried rosemary to the dough. Really great recipe in need of just a few tweaks.

Wow.  Excellente.  Do NOT skip the  water-spraying step or bread may come out burnt-ish and too crusty.  Sprinkle the top with oil and salt.  Delicious.

Like others I had problems with the dough being too wet. To be fair though, I made some substitutions to the flours called for.

I followed the recipe to a "T" and it came out great.  My husband said it tastes just as good as the ciabatta bread from the bakery.  I think using the bread flour helps to keep the dough from getting to "runny".  The dough was a little sticky but not what I expected from reading the reviews. I will definitely make this again and try to spice it up with herbs and/or cheese.  Great recipe!

this was amazing. I added the ingredients in the order of warm water and yeast first with the sugar and let that sit for a few minutes to proof then I added the flour and the salt on top so that it is added in last during the mixing cycle (salt can kill the yeast if added to early). I then dumped it all out onto a floured cutting board and covered for about 15 minutes to settle, and then used a sharp knife to cut into four long loaves of bread.  I was looking for a good bruschetta size loaf, and they came out so moist and fluffy, perfect!  Do make sure you spritz them every 3-5 minutes and you will get nicely browned and not to crunchy outside, I also baked the smaller long loaves for only about 20 minutes.  So good, will definitely make this one of my regulars!!  You could add fresh herbs or garlic, I can imagine the possibilities, but its also perfect on its own. In fact, i'm going to get another piece!  Yum!!

This was amazing.  Everyone loved it.  It had a nice crunchy crust with a tender and soft inside filled with air bubbles.  

The dough is not that wet, I think people exaggerate or just don't like baking bread that much.  I just dumped it out of the bread machine, let it rise, then stretched it (make sure to flour your fingers) into 4x12 loaves and let it rise again.  I followed the recipe exactly.  There is minimal touching involved.  Easy and super delicious.

Delicious. Dough is hard to work with until you've made it a few times and gotten the hang of it. It's pretty aggravating if you're used to easy bread machine recipes - but worth it. One thing other reviewers haven't mentioned is that it's useful to scrape down the sides of the breadmachine a few minutes after it's started mixing to be sure to incorporate all of the flour in the corners. Also, I followed other's suggestions and proofed the yeast first and used a themometer to check the temp. of the water. Lastly, I turn the dough out directly on the cooking sheet that I will bake it on. I let it rise in a slightly warmed oven with the pan of boiling water underneath. Turns out perfectly everytime.

I followed the recipe exactly.  I also used a spatula as suggested and coated it with Pam.  I also coated a metal spatula with Pam to cut it in half.  I stretched the dough rather than shaped it.  Spritzed it every three minutes for the first 9 minutes and it turned out PERFECT!  Very chewy on the inside while being crisp on the outside.  So good I had to make a second batch.  Perfect again.

I really like this recipe, and I really like using the bread machine to help with the dough!  I have made ciabatta bread the "old fashioned" way, and it is a mess, this takes a lot of the mess out of it.  The dough is not nearly as wet and messy as traditional.  While it doesn't taste exactly like regular ciabatta bread, it is close enough and good in its own right.  And for less mess it is worth it!  I have seen people on here complain about it being wet, that is what makes it so good!  My boyfriend makes it a work and they use large tubs to make it in and it takes many hours and they have to 'knead' quite a bit,  this is a nice recipe because the bread maker gets most of the hard part, I only have to do the last!  Thanks!!

I have tried and failed miserably to make this recipe two times already.  My yeast being bad does not seem to be the problem.  The dough is extremely runny and hard to work with.

I use recipes very close to this and add a sourdough starter for 1/2 a cup of the water. It works very well. But the dough must be a bit stiffer (more flour) to be able to fold the dough into a batard or a baguette.

Absolutely great recipe. I had started out elsewhere with a from-scratch hand-made biagi; gave up instantly with a gelatinous mess. I switched to this recipe, only making the salt Kosher, otherwise the ingredients were followed exactly.  Elsewhere I did follow 2 suggestions: (1) let the dough stay in the breadpan for 20 minutes (which yielded an easy-to-work-with dough which I then placed in a butter-greased bowl covered with plastic wrap; and (2) placed the dough, once punched down, into the refrigerator for 4 hours.  The technique followed by me after that: uncover the bowl, punch it down and knead it over, then let it rest for 15 minutes.  No one else has suggested how many rolls you can make, but the answer is 12.  After shaping and let rise for 1 hour, I used a baking stone on the center rack and a roasting pan on the bottom rack into which I placed 1 cup of boiling water from my tea kettle right after putting the rolls in (I would recommend putting only 6 rolls in the oven at a time else they will be merge together).  For each 3 minutes thereafter I lightly spritzed the rolls for the first 10 minutes; the rolls were done in about 12 minutes, not the 25 suggested by the recipe. Be sure to use a Thermapen to get an accurate reading for doneness.  Thank you all for your suggestions!

I've made this bread several times already (no bread machine - do it by hand); I add fresh rosemary to the dough, and proof the dough and sugar in water, as suggested by another reviewer, before adding to the flour; also, instead of a 45-minute rise, I let it rise for one hour.  I also pre-heat a pizza stone sprinkled with corn meal, and a metal loaf pan on the rack below the pizza stone, for a half an hour before baking the bread.  There is no need to spritz the bread if you pre-heat a metal loaf pan and then add a cup of very hot water to the loaf pan when putting in the bread.  The water hitting the pan will create plenty of steam as you quickly shut the oven door, and the result will be a nice, crispy crust.  I make all of my breads this way.

LOVE this recipe, I make it once a week, make it into small square buns and we make blackened chicken sandwiches, turkey burgers & portabella burgers, it works great! Usually add rosemary to the recipe and I spritz with olive oil.

Poor reviews from poor bakers... this recipe has been spot on everytime!  I usually use it to make the best sandwich rolls around... after the rest, cut the dough in 8... flatten into 4 to 5 inch discs let rise for 45 minutes bake at 425 for about 12 minutes...   cool on a rack and bag em' and tag em'... good eats!

This was good bread.  I used my kitchenaid mixer because I don't have a bread machine.  I also used all purpose flour and my dough wasn't even remotely runny, I'm guessing this is why my bread was so much denser than I was expecting, even though I barely worked it at all.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I had a hard time rating this, because mine was just a "pool" of dough, as others have stated. You can't cover it, either - too sticky. The first time I made it, I had floured the top & covered with wax paper, which I had to bake with it on or deflate the dough - which was only about an inch high as it was! It had spread to almost cover the pan...I loved how it turned out! Perfectly crunchy top & bottom & airy/chewy inside. I cut it into sandwich-sized pieces, then split them to make a top & bottom. I don't like a thick bread - I used to cut the middle out of store-bought ciabatta rolls, using the middles as more sandwich slices (but no nice crust). I assumed I made the bread with too much liquid, so made it a 2nd time being very careful to measure everything exactly. Same watery dough the 2nd time, but I didn't care! The flavor & texture are excellent - with or without toasting. I purposely spread it as much as possible (about 10"x12") sprayed it with Pam and the plastic wrap to cover it & let it rise. It didn't get much higher, and the covering stuck anyway, so it deflated some when I removed it. It came out 1" high - just thick enough to split in two. I'm rating this 5 stars because I personally LOVE it like this and will continue to make it for myself. (first flop I've ever liked!)

Best and easiest!!! Followed directions exactly but as other reviewers wrote, I left dough in bread machine for 20-30 minutes and removed from pan. Not as loose as I expected and followed the rest of directions and it turned out great, hubby loved the taste. Making second batch tonite for town meeting day pot luck. Keeping one loaf for us though! Will be making many times in the future. Thanks for such a great crusty bread recipe better than the store.

Yum!  My second successful loaf of bread today!  I followed this recipe exactly, except I just left the dough in my bread machine for an extra 20 minutes instead of placing on the counter under a bowl to rise (as was suggested to me on The Buzz).  The directions aren't kidding- this is some of the stickiest dough I have ever worked with!  I did manage to resist the urge to add more flour, but it was difficult :)  I thought there was no way I was going to be able to form the dough into anything resembling an oval (or anything else for that matter!), as I could not hardly even get it off my hands.  So, I divided it in two, and just sort of plopped it on the baking sheet in frustration.  Don't worry though- after it sits for a bit it is easy to go back and get it into shape.  I did spritz with water every 5 minutes or so of baking, and I got a beautiful crispy crust.  The inside is perfectly chewy.  Just wonderful!  Thank you Marina!  :)

My first time with ciabatta and it was perfect. I read every review and ladelded out the flour with my measure as one suggested and used bread machine for kneading and one rise. Used spatula to remove with no difficulty and then divided dough into two nice loaves using flour on my hands. Let rise second time on parchment lined baking sheets. Did water spritz after 10 min. And they turned out looking great and tasted fabulous. I was afraid to try after so many talked about so liquid. I honestly think scooping the bread flour out with the one cup measure made the difference. Can't wait for hubby to taste.

We love this bread, its become a real treat in our house! The last time I made it, I roasted a head of garlic and made a paste from it with a little sea salt and rosemary. I added it to the bread machine and let it knead for a few minutes before taking the loaf out to rest. The final product came out beautifully! The recipe is lovely on its own, but the garlic was a nice addition.

Made this one time and am making it again today.  Really easy and really delicious!  It is a runny batter, but it works in the end.  Remember, it is a rustic bread and is not meant to look perfect.

I gave it 2 stars because the taste was very good, however after I dimpled it the 2nd time it did not rise in the oven when baked, the bread came out very flat.  Next time I won't dimple at all and see if that  helps.

Very good. I followed the advice of another reviewer and used a rubber spatula to get the dough out of the bread machine pan and it worked great. The bread baked up nicely. I didn't have any problems with it at all.

I have made this at least ten times and the dough runs over the pan and bakes up with a very pale crust.  Instructions say not to add more flour, but this is so runny you can't even shape it.  Don't know how one person was able to shape it into buns.  Looking for a different recipe.

I love making bread, but didn't enjoy making this ciabatta. The dough was very runny and I did resist the temptation to add more flour after the first proof. In the second proof, the dough started to spread, like the Blob, and did not rise. Halfway through the second proof, I ended up putting it into a loaf tin. Tasted okay, but not the ciabatta that I am like. I think I will just go to my favourite bakery for ciabatta next time.

It was great. It was definitely messy. Flour your hands to handle that dough. And i liked the idea to cover "it" with a large bowl. It reminded me of The Blob as it crept out from underneath the bowl. HaHa! But it was worth the effort. And my family was well pleased.

I am in the middle of making this right now. 

Memo to anyone who is game enough to try it...  When taking the dough out of the tin, flour your hands, your board or tray...  Flour everything!!!  

Not until you actually try this do you realise how sticky, and loose the mixture.  

This however is not in any way a bad thing!!! Can see how it works, and work it does! Awesome recipe as long as you flour your hands, the board, the tray, and whilest you are at it...  Whe whole kitchen. lol

this is excellent, the only problem I had was when I tried to dimple after the last rise. It had crusted slightly (even toweled) and fell. I should have let it rise again, but it rose slightly and is quite tasty.

I'm a novice at bread baking, but this turned out excellent anyway.  Everyone in our family loves the crunchy crust with the chewy inside.  I don't hesitate serving it since there is minimal salt, sugar, and olive oil.  It taste great and is healthy.

What an excellent recipe! The dough was easy enough to work with (I took the advice of another reviewer who suggested to pack the flour into the measuring cup rather than loosely adding) and the loaves came out perfectly. Hubby ate an entire loaf by himself! Thanks for a great recipe!

Awesome bread.  Mine did not come out of bread machine sticky.  I did add some sea salt to the top as recommened by another reviewer.  I also spritzed with water 3 or 4 times.  Bread browned fast, baked for 25 minutes but could have gone the full 30 for extra crispy.  Will make again!

This was a relatively easy recipe.  The oven setting seems too high. The crust was done before the bread inside was done.  I shall try 400 dgrees. I think it should mention using luke warm water to activate the yeast, also.  Still a very nice bread. I will make it again with a couple of tweaks.

Before I made this bread I did a bit of research and found that the dough is supposed to be wet and sticky which is exactly what I ended up with.  Marina, this was delicious and exactly what I had hoped for. Crusty on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside with lots of beautiful holes. Delicious and thank you!

Don't Give Up!  It seemed I was doing something wrong.  The loaves didn't rise much and even though I floured the top when letting them "rise", they stuck to everything I covered them with.  Because I kept checking on them and changing the covering (plastic wrap, wax paper, finally damp towel worked best), I let it sit for an extra 20-30 minutes, then baked even though they seemed to be "stuck" to the floured non-stick baking sheet.  It turned out delicious with a perfect texture and came right off the sheet.  So my advice, don't give up on it, no matter...!!

WET STICKY DOUGH?? PLS READ:  The first time I made this I ended up with a wet sticky mess like many reviewers. Second time was fine. The difference? How people are measuring. Typically, I spoon flour into measuring cups and skim the top. This is the "proper way". The second time, I scooped the flour out using the measuring cup, which packs it in more tightly, and the dough was much more manageable and produced a better loaf of ciabatta. 3 1/2 cups spooned  3 1/2 cups packed!!!

I loved my bread's crispy, chewy crust and spongy interior!  Even if this isn't true ciabatta because it doesn't use a starter, it still tasted excellent! I would cook it for less time at a lower heat, though, because my crust was much too brown.  Also, use very floured hands when working with the dough, and use grease along with flour when flouring the pan, because my bread stuck in places.

the best of the rustic bread recipies we have found to date (I have gone through at least 8 bread recipies. All good, but not as good as this one. We do have 2 or three things we did that made the bread even nicer.  1) place a pan of water at the bottom of the oven and spray the cooking bread a few times with water (moisten, do not wet). We read that this contributes to a crustier bread. 2) We used a higher temo when cooking (475 degrees) 3) We chose not to glaze with egg and water. We dusted with flour instead.  That said, the ingredients and technique we used was otherwise identical. this is one awesome loaf of bread.

I love this recipe, thank you for sharing it!  It is perfect.  By using the bread machine it's easy to make.  Before taking it out of the machine I spread olive oil over my hands and the spot where it is going to rest and I have few problems with it sticking.  Also, I just make one large loaf instead of two smaller ones.  You must mist during baking to get the perfect crust.

Great recipe!!  I love Ciabatta and this was so easy to make.  The caution about resisting the temptation to add more flour was good as I certainly would have.  The dough was softer and stickier than I would have expected.  Also, user tip to use a spatula and a metal scraper was good as it made handling the dough possible.  The results were excellant!!

This was really good! My dough wasn't all that sticky when it came out of the machine....more plastic-like than anything. It was even difficult to shape. But once baked this bread was amazing! I think next time I will make buns out of it.

I made dough into dinner rolls and they came out light, fluffy, and crunchy on outside. Great. As another user did, I did not use a bread machine and added rosemary to the recipe. Also, I not sure if this made a difference but I let the dough rise for 4+ hrs before forming rolls. Then let rise 1 more hour. Next time I will try adding olives to recipe!

Really good, except for the airpockets were not as large as I had thought they'd be. OH! and for those that haven't figured it out..the 13X14 in loaf..uh..TYPO!!  It is supposed to read 3X14.  We did not have a functioning spray bottle, so we did not 'spritz'...but I do think that it is a must..I will have to go and get one before we make this bread again.

wow!  really good!  It was extremely hard to work with, and I thought that there was no way that it would turn out... but when I took it out of the oven I was optimistic and when I sliced it I knew that it was a keeper!  thanks so much - it is better than my grocery store!!!

I just made the bread and it tastes wonderful and has a great texture that one would expect. (I did mist the bread several times during baking.) Overall the appearance was not as good- pale and about 1/4" to 1/2" high.  Kinda hard to make sandwiches with, but good with dinner none the less!  I ended up baking for 7 extra minutes (the oven temp is fine - I always use an oven thermometer & it is accurate) to try and get a more golden crust... it turned out a bit on the pale side.  Also- I'm not sure if did something wrong, but after following the directions and using fresh yeast the loves were under 1/2 inch high.  Maybe I will try it some other day and make fewer "dimples" or only make 1 larger loaf.

Easy Recipe.  Liked the technique of using bread machine to do the mixing and kneading.  No messy clean up!  Flavor was good.  Would like to try it in a smoked turkey sandwich.  Good with soup, too.  Will make this again!

Yummy and impressive. Takes about 3 hours from start to finish, depending on your machine's dough cycle, but it's worth it!

I love this recipe!  It takes 5 minutes (at a casual pace) to put the ingredients in the bread machine and then you have an hour & a half to get on with other things, put the dough in the oven, and 25 minutes later, heavenly ciabatta!
I'm making eggs benedict for breakfast, served on the ciabatta fresh from the oven!  Yum!

Set up an account here just to be able to rate this recipe with 5 stars! This is first ciabatta I have ever made, and it is probably one of the best loaves I have ever tasted. Excellent. Very surprising considering its simplicity, few ingredients and how sticky it looked. I resisted adding flour and avoided handling entirely. Simply let it rest then pour it onto two parchment-lined cookie sheets, pulling edges in a little with a butter knife. Looks "off" if you are picturing regular dough, but the oven heat works its magic and this bread comes out beautiful, with golden color, crispy crust and airy interior. A flat rustic charmer.  ...  Only variation I made was to sprinkle olive oil, salt and garlic powder on one of the loaves about 5 minutes before done. Did use suggestions to use regular flour, to twice-brush water on loaf during cooking, and to place small bowl water in oven. Enjoyed it, as is, without butter or toppings, especially the garlic one. Thank you for sharing!

This was fast & easy using the bread machine. I have been looking for recipes using the bread machine to make the dough as i have arthritis in my wrists and all the mixing by hand made me stop making bread.  We loved the taste & texture.  I will definitely be making this recipe again.  Had it tonight with lentil soup from this site as well, great meal on a cold winter's night.

My husband thought this bread was perfect.  He loved the chewiness that it offered.  I made half of the dough into a loaf of bread, and the other half in to 6 rolls to be used with the recipe 'Ultimate Steak Sandwich' from AR.  They proved to be a great fit with the sandwiches.    The bread toasted up really nicely in the toaster for a breakfast treat.  I will be using this recipe again.

I am somewhat of a beginner to making bread but have tried several different types and this by far is my favourite. MY husband LOVES ciabatta bread and it is difficult to come by in my area. I tried this, having relatively low expectations, and was pleasantly surprised with the flavour, texture and appearance. The crust was chewy and the inside was moist and soft. The only things I did differently was I proofed the yeast first in the warm water for 20minutes. I also used all purpose flour instead of bread flour and the dough was the perfect texture for ciabatta - rather wet but still a workable dough.

This is my first attempt at ciabatta and it went well. I had to baste the bread with water as I don't have a spritzer. The taste was great. I think it is worth the work if you have the time.

Something's not right here.  I make various breads using my bread maker for both completed loaves and dough starters, but this recipe (which I measured exactly, something that I don't think is all that necessary) just produced a load of runny goop that was impossible to shape, handle or do anything with.  It just slowly ran off the sides of the floured board on to the worktop and from there it was a quick step into the waste bin.  Any ideas on how to actually get this to work? Take care.

For those of you not wanting to deal with a super loss batter, I added 1/4 cup more flour, kneaded in KA for 5 minutes and came out with a lovely soft dough.  Skipped the resting period, molded into two squares, cut the squares with pizza cutter (4 per square or a total of 8 bun sized), and proceeded with rest of recipe as written (except baked for 20").  Insanely wonderful burger sized buns, chewy on the outside but light and fluffy on the inside.  Outstanding.

This recipe is awesome.  I just got my bread machine out after 15 years of it gathering dust.  I rarely made anything in it that didn't just come out of a prepackaged box.  But I have made this 4 times now and it turns out well each time.  Sometimes the dough is not as runny as the first time I made it but it turns out delicious all the same.  I always use the tip of spraying the loaves with water every 3 minutes for the first 10 minutes.  I also found the tip of using a silicon scraper to get the dough out of the bread machine pan helpful as well as using a metal spatula to turn out the dough rather than get really messy hands.

Just a great, light, "holey" kind of bread.  It was quite sticky and wet, and I did add about 1/8 cup more of flour, but as long as you don't handle it much, it will do what it is supposed to do.  I spritzed too early and got a flat loaf.  I put the dough in a Dutch oven to bake.    It comes out looking like artisan bread.  This recipe is great.  Just make sure to handle dough as little as possible.

I combined the sugar, yeast, and warm water and let is sit for about 10 minutes (until it got nice and cloudy) before adding it to the other ingredients.  I don't have a bread machine so I used my electric mixer.  It took about 15 minutes on speed 6 for the dough to pass the window pane test.  My only change to the ingredients was adding a few pinches of rosemary as per another reviewer to give it a bit more flavour.  Next time I think I'll add thyme or good italian seasoning mix instead.  I made one loaf and half a dozen buns from 1 batch of this.  The buns are amazing with the grilled portobello mushrooms from this site!

Not sure what might have been wrong, with recipe amounts measure precisely the dough was not dough, but literally the consistency of cake batter. I had to add an extra cup of flour at least. Even after the extra flour was still very runny/sticky and difficult to deal with, but it turned out great with rave reviews from all 14 dinner guests.

Not sure about this and what I did wrong. Someone else noted the recipe may have been changed from 2 1/4 c flour to 3 1/4c flour. I used the latter and the dough wasn't runny at all. Maybe a little sticky but not more than other bread I've made. It also didn't really rise much so I'm left with two rather flat breads. Haven't tasted them but not quite what I wanted. I'm taking these to a party tomorrow so wonder what the Italians will make of it... Can someone please check the recipe?

This has become my "make it quick" bread.  Instead of following the directions exactly.  I mix it. Dump it all onto a pan in one lump. Let it rise for about an hour. Then bake.

Not the best texture or crust, but certainly well worth the short time spent to make it.  I made 1 large round loaf. Very nice to look at, sliced well, great fresh out of the oven and also for toast.  Definitely a keeper recipe.

This is one of the easiest bread recipes I have ever made.  Have made it several times with no problems. I agree with many of the posts on here regarding... what is all the fuss about. Just toss your ingredients in your bread machine and enjoy. My family loves it. Thanks Marina for this wonderful recipe.

This bread was delicious and mine turned out just fine. This was easy to make, and I still can't figure out why so many had problems with  this. It was easy to work with and it looked like a ciabatta bread to me. This would make perfect garlic bread or bread with soup,or even a pizza sandwich, Yum. I had mine with pasta and it was the perfect pairing. Thanks!

This recipe is great if you reduce the amount of flour.  I am wondering if someone changed the ingredients list.  2 1/4 cups of flour worked perfectly for me with similar results as some of the other reviewers.  I made it this morning for sandwiches after church and had to make more for lunches tomorrow because it was so well liked.

I made this bread for a friend's birthday dinner.  Everyone was blown away by my "skills", although I did nothing out of the ordinary.  I mixed the whole thing in my bread maker.  It rose once, then I took it out, divided it in two, didn't play around much with it, just shaped it onto the large cookie sheet and let it rise again, did add the container of water to the oven, and I did spritz every few minutes for 10 mins. total, and this bread was enjoyed and gobbled up.  I had a tiny piece left the next day and it was not hard as some breads become, and eating something healthy and knowing what I put into it, is always a plus.  Delicious.

So easy to make in the bread machine ( I have a very old machine). I followed the recipe ingredients and used the frech bread setting, let it rise for an extra 15 mins, shaped, covered and let it rise for another 30 min then baked. I had no problems working with dough. Sprayed my hads with a little olive oil before taking out of machine.  I made two loaf, but I think next time I will make it into one and a couple of rolls. It tasted more like a frech bread, but worked great to dip in my tomatoe soup and then panini sandwiches the next day. A lot cheaper then buying at the store and should save me a couple of emergency trips to the store for bread.

Wowwwwww!  This recipe is sooo easy.  I wanted one that calls for the use of a bread machine only.  I am so glad I read one of the reviewer's comments.  She set her machine to French Bread, and so did I.  I have made several loaves, and have experimented with lots of herbs.  Today I am trying it on a medium versus dark crust!

I wanted a recipe I could make without prrofing as some recipes call for.  I loved the bread and it came out as expected.  I didn't have bread flour so I used all purpose and added some gluten which I had on hand.  It was delicious and this recipe is a keeper for sure.

This is great! I don't have a bread machine so I used my KitchenAid stand mixer instead. The only thing I changed was that I used a whole package of active dry yeast. My husband said it was some of the best bread I've ever made and I've made lots and lots of breads, so I will definitely be making this one again! Thanks so much for sharing!

I had no problems making this bread! It didn't rise as much as I hoped, but that's okay. I just didn't care for the taste, maybe it was just too much salt? It was okay has the "crust" for a bread pizza, but not okay to eat plain.

This bread turned out exceptionally well for a first time bread baker. :) Everyone ate it as soon as it was ready. I liked the directions and ingredients, and it worked out for me, an actually really easy recipe to follow since this was my first time making bread.

I have made these twice now. The first time they came out ok. The second time was much better. I make buns instead of loaves. I do the water for every three minutes as someone else mentioned. With five minutes left I brushed and egg wash on the tops. It gave the buns a great color and the buns were a hit. I used them to make bacon cheese burger sliders. YUMMY......

Great recipe. Wonderful texture and air spaces. I thought it was as good as ciabatta made with a sponge.

I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with a pool of gooey paste.  I managed to divide it in to somehow and glopped it onto parchment paper.  I followed the recipe to a T and did not add extra flour.  The "bread" came out like a flat almost cracker type bread.  My yeast and all ingredients were very fresh.  I may try again and add more flour??

As mentioned by an earlier review - there is no way to get two 13X14 loaves out of this mixture.  Glad to see that someone has revised the recipe to read 3X14.  That works.  However have made this twice before and both times trying to get two 13X14 loaves ended up with one roughly 10x14 loaf which turned out just fine.  The dough is sticky but with floured surface and hands and with minimal messing with to form the loaf, it does ok.  The bread is delicious.  Don't have a spritzer so use a paint brush to lightly brush water over the loaf a couple of times while baking.  Worked fine.

Nice recipe! I also use this for pizza dough and it makes a fantastic garlic bread, great for grilled sandwiches or just dipping in sauce. Very versatile. Thanks for sharing this!

I make this according to the recipe, but turn it out in one lump onto a big pizza pan.  I spread it out alternatively flouring my hands and then continue with the rest of the recipe.  My b/f loves this better than any store bought ciabatta.

Absolutely wonderful, added a bit of garlic salt on top.  Baked a few minutes shorter and got a crispy crust without spritzing.  Delicious!

I made this with 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 AP flour (its what I had in the kitchen).  It didn't rise as much as I would've liked, but it was the flour, I'm sure.  Still, it rose enough to not be dense, and it had a good flavor.  I did brown quickly, and didn't need the full 25 min to bake.  All in all, it was a good experience with bread, and a good outcome.  I will keep this in my recipe box to use again.  Thanks to the reviewer who suggested the spatula to get the dough to the baking sheet and thanks to the person who submitted this recipe.

So yumm!  Yes a bit sticky, but with some flour on the board and my hands it was not a problem.  Both loaves rose beautifully and had lots of even holes throughout.  It was so good that my trial slice turned into half the loaf!
Will be making this again, although next time will reduce the temp and cook for a bit longer as the loaves browned very quickly.

I tried this recipe twice and the first time was awful. Not airy with holes on inside, but dry and crumby. Tried it a second time today and it was perfect!! Moist with holes and not crumby at all. I let it rise a bit longer this time and didnt work with it much before putting it in the oven. Wetting every 3 mins in the beginning whilst baking is very important as well to ensure a nice crisp crust. ``If at first you fail, try and try again.`` I was put off the first time, but will be sticking to this recipe!! ps..the US system is more accurate than metric for positive results.This is my opinion after trying this twice.

I have been using a bread machine for many, many years and I have never seen a recipe so misleading in my life.  I would  refer to the dough as batter or paste.  It was extremely hard to handle and there is no way it would ever look like the pictured product unless it was baked in a bread tube.  Clean up was not easy.  But I do have a suggestion for covering while rising, us a large roaster one of the high domed ones. Or the larges salad bowl you can find. I used Reynolds release foil on cookie sheets and I must say it slide off with no problem.  I haven't eaten it yet but I'm not sure if I'll make this one again.  People must have added extra flour to have made their's manageable.  So has anyone else noticed that this bread is only an 1 to 2 inches high when it's all done and baked?

Great recipe!  I made 2 14" loaves today substituting canola oil and 2 1/4 C of GM High Gluten flour and 1 C GM H&R AP flour.  Results - perfect thin crisp crust with a soft chewy interior.  After it cooled my partner scarfed down one entire loaf, so it had to be good!  Thanks for the recipe!

Really awful. It is no fun messing with runny dough. And what are you supposed to use to cover it? I used plastic wrap sprayed with Bakers Joy and that did not work. A waste of ingredients. I'll be making a trip to Panera Bread.

I came within 30 seconds to pitching this whole thing. There is a conflict between the picture and the recipe. It is not that easy to handle (the dough) because it is so sticky but the finished product is outstanding.

During my first try our power went out briefly and turned the machine off, and I didn't realize it... I had no idea if it had had the proper rise time or not, and I went ahead and tried baking them, and they were still delicious!  I substituted 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, and it was delicious.  This is our new weekly bread recipe. Thanks!

I tried this recipe out and was weary about the stickiness of it having read all the reviews.... BUT.... the result was excellent!  This is a great recipe and easy to make.  only thing that worried me whilst making it was the dough nearly rising to the roof of my machine, but this might have been because i used natural yeast and not dried stuff.  I'm very pleased with tis and shall be using it again!

Great recipe!  I have searching for the perfect homemade bread for years and this is it!  I bake it on a baking stone to give it the "hearth" effect.  My family loves this bread!

I love ciabatta and this was sooo easy!  Everyone one in my family loved it!  It was also the very first time I had used the bread machine, and i was very pleasantly surprised at how wonderful it turned out, since I'd heard so many horror stories about bread machine failures!

This is what ciabatta bread should look like. Fabulous flavor! I used 1/4 cup of whole wheat bread flour instead of all regular bread flour.

This is the best bread I ever made. As I was eating it I kept asking myself "You really made THIS??"  Really good flavor and texture with a chewy crust. I didn't alter the ingredients, but as another Allrecipes member suggested I left the dough in the bread machine for 45 minutes after the dough cycle ended. It was a soft dough, not wet but it wouldn't hold a shape either. I also put a pot of water in the oven while preheating and left it there while baking as someone else suggested.

I just took this out of the oven on this freezing cold day, it is delicious! I followed the recipe measurements and used the bread flour, i also added 1/8 tsp garlic powder and 1 tsp rosemary for some extra flavor. I left it in my bread maker for about 20 minutes past the 1 1/2 dough cycle, then transferred it to a floured bread board. Cut it in two and put it on parchment paper. Let it rise 45 minutes . I spritzed it with water 3 X in the first 10 minutes. It is perfect, taste and texture! I will be making this again, and again!

This bread turned out perfectly for me. I  appreciated the reviewer'so tip to leave the dough in the bread machine for the 20 minute rise.  It worked perfectly!  I  had no problem with the dough being too runny.  I made 6 large rolls with this recipe.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I am making this for the second time.
I used all purpose flour - no problem.
If it is too runny you probably aren't using enough flour. try lightly packing the flour in the measuring cup. Also, for rising I turn the oven on for about 20 seconds to warm it then leave the light on while it rises. Great bread!

Excellent EASY recipe for a very tasty bread. I made this recipe 4 times, two were loaves and two were rolls.I made the loaves in the bread machine. The dough was not runny, but sticky. I just scoop it out of the bread pan with a spatula. Dusted my hands with flour. I added poppy seeds to one batch of rolls. I used my giant muffin tin for the biscuits. Everyone loves this bread. Why bother with store bread. Next I'll try hamburger buns!

Easy and great tasting. I changed the recipe: i used AP flour instead of bread flour. I used a stand mixer instead of a bread machine. I also added a bit of garlic and onion powder and some dried herbs. I let it rise in a slightly warm oven for about 45 min. Baked at 425 for 30 min. Spritzed water twice within the first 10 min. Came out airy, chewy, and delicious. The whole family loved it.

Wow! Not only easy, but delicious!!! I added some dried rosemary and basil (less than a tablespoon of each) but followed the recipe exactly besides that. It was perfect: crusty on the outside, fluffy and dense on the inside. A friend said it was the best ciabatta they'd had, and I got several requests to make it again. I will absolutely make this again.

Oh my gosh, folks, this Ciabatta bread recipe is incredible. I have been regularly baking it and sharing it with friends and neighbors. And better still, instead of paying $4 for a half-sized loaf loaded with preservatives at the local markets, it costs me about a buck and a half to make these two loaves I even use the bread machine for the dough cycle). It has actually lasted for a week just sealed in a plastic bag, but you won't really need to worry about such longevity. This stuff will go fast right out of the oven.
I should note I cheated a wee bit as the dough is/was-as forewarned-sticky. I used corn meal in baking pan and it took far less and added even further to the delicious taste...so thanks again, Marina for sharing this one. It's now one of my top 5 favorites!

I just set my bread machine to the dough setting and let it do all the rising in the machine. Then I just dumped it out onto a greased pan and gently formed it into a squarish shape with a few pushes. Baked it on the bread setting of our steam oven. Perfection!! Best ciabatta I ever had!!

yum! left it in the bread machine for the first short rise per other comments, then laid it out in the baking pan for the second rise. i sprinkled the top with a dusting of salt, garlic powder and rosemary and it's insane. i think next time i will try incorporating the spices into the dough. thank you!

Dough was so runny that after 15mins I had to POUR it like cake batter into two 12 x 4 inch baking pans. I let it rise for any hour then baked in oven at 425 for 25mins. End result was really nice bread with great texture and nice crunchy crust. Thanks for this recipe!

I made this into buns.   They were a little hard to form as the dough is very sticky but they turned out well, albeit a little unevenly shaped.

I have tried a whole lot of ciabatta recipes and this is by far the best. I made it in my KA and the only change that I made was to add the olive oil at the beginning. Yes it's sticky, that's what makes it so moist. Thanks Marina.

Great recipe! I rolled mozzarella and green olives into a hallow then formed baguette style loaf. Worked amazing. I also sprinkled top with fresh sage and cumin seeds and a bit of coarse sea salt before spritz-ing with water for a bit of added flavour. I also filled a muffin tin with water to aid a moisture rich baking environment. Result was beautifully crispy crust and soft flavourful filling and bread on inside. Yum yum yum :) thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was so easy!  Dough was perfect.  I used my B&D bread machine on the dough setting and followed all the instructions.  Dough was sticky as they said it would be, but it worked just as it should.  Will use this recipe again!

I let it rise in bread machine before taking it out. And using a spatula to get the dough out is definitely the way to do it!

Excellent bread. Perfect explanation in recipe to have a nice crispy crust and a nice soft center.  The only problem is I have no leftovers for tomorrow. The next time I will try some cheese topping as the crust appears to support this.

I had runny dough all over me, the kitchen counter, the dogs, the floor.  Yes, I followed the recipe.  I turned the dough out on plastic wrap, since you said it would be runny.  I could only get it off the wrap with a spatula.  Couldn't possibly have divided it in half, as it ran together.  Despite losing 1/3 of the dough as stated above, it baked up great.  I covered it with olive oil while hot and sprinkled on kosher salt.  I don't know how to fix this recipe except by adding flour.

Due to me having a low sodium diet, I have to find recipes from scratch... In this recipe, I altered it slightly by using 2 cups of wheat flour and 1 and 1/2 cups of bread flour and then I added some basil and rosemary spices and added it to the water where the salt and sugar was added.   The bread turned out great!  I love Ciabatta bread and all the air pockets in it!

I made this for the first time today.  It was easy and it came out great.  Hubby had a piece pretty much right out of the ovev with butter.  He loved it!  Will definitely make it again.  One word of caution...when you cover it to lrt it rest for 45 minutes...don't let the cover touch the dough.  It will stick.  I used floured plastic wrap and it still stuck.

Very good.   I used my Blendtec blender with the Wildside jar to make this instead of a breadmaker.  Let the yeast set for 5 minutes before adding the oil and flour then pulse to mix.  Let sit 15 mins in jar before turning out to form rounds and let rise.  Worked like a charm.

I made this today and did not have any problems with the dough running or being too sticky. I made no changes to the recipe at all and it turned out great.  I did not give this recipe five stars for one big reason.  Ciabatta bread is supposed to be light and airy (like a sponge). This bread is a little dense.  I would make it again because it is delicious, but I would not call it a true Ciabatta bread.

This is more like focaccia bread than ciabatta. Was dense, not airy.

This is an excellent recipe!  I'm so glad I found it!  I just used regular flour and it was fantastic.  I just doubled the recipe and made 4 loafs to take with us on our beach trip!  Perfection!

I used Fleischmanns dry active yeast, which I know is not the most effective bread machine yeast, but as I also added some dough enhancer I hoped for the best. The loaf did not rise much at all. The final loaf tasted way too salty, but this too maybe because I used a low sodium salt. I need to try again but using less salt.

I have no bread machine, so I did it the old fashioned way--by blooming my yeast in the warm water and sugar first. Fabulous bread! I always thought specialty breads like chibata and chala were impossible at home, but this was the easiest bread I ever made; and with the best results. I added some dried herbs and seasonings to it the second time: rosemary, parsley, garlic, lemon peel, paprika, red pepper... It made it that much better.

I followed the directions exactly. I refrained from adding any more flour even though the dough was very sticky and wet. It was next to impossible to handle. My loaves came out thinner than I prefer, but they tasted very good with a crunchy crust and soft interior.

my secret to make it crusty is to put a cast iron pan below the baking rack and preheated it, then when I placed the bread inside the oven I added four or five cubes of ice on the cast iron pan, the bread came out very nice, but I don't think the flavor is the best.

Just made this bread and the recipe turned out perfect, as written!  I made no changes and do not plan to make any in the future, and will definitely be making it in the future.  Fortunately, I have worked with wet dough before, so I wasn't intimidated by it, but was glad that other reviewers mentioned it so that I wasn't startled by it.  The best way to work with wet dough is to lightly sprinkle with flour before cutting and handling. I use a small metal wire strainer so you get a light even dusting over the dough.  Then I cut it in half and gently formed it into two loaves.  I got about the same size as the recipe called for.  The most important thing to remember is when you are measuring the water, I always measure by weight so that it's exact.  And when I measure flour, I place it in the measuring cup and use a knife to level it off so that the flour does not get packed down.  If you do those two things, your breads will come out better, in my opinion.  We had the best BLT sandwiches with this bread and I look forward to leftover turkey sandwiches with the other loaf!  Superb!

I was troubled by the liquidity of this dough, but chose to wait it out and see.  It tastes good, but it's not pretty and didn't rise nearly as much as it should have, in my opinion.  It's edible and usable for the sandwiches, but I'll keep looking for a better one.

This bread turned out wonderfully.  We love it.  The dough was sticky and all I could do was laugh when I was working with it!  But I was able to form it into 6 mini loaves to use for sandwiches, and I'm happy with the outcome.  Thank you Mother Ann for suggesting this recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly and used bread flour.  I also added 2 TBS of rosemary which added a nice flavor.  I can't believe my finicky teen loved it!  Will make again.  Thanks!

This is a delicious and simple ciabatta recipe.  I have tried another recipe before, and it took the entire day to make 2 loaves of ciabatta.  I could not believe how easy and good this recipe was.  I followed the recipe entirely and I was very happy with the result.  As one reviewer said, I sprayed the bread with water a few times while in oven for a crispier crust.  Will make it again soon!

Yum!  I admit, I feared it was too flat/runny but it cooked up just like a beautiful store bought ciabatta.  Prepare yourselves for STICKY dough--handle minimally, and make sure everything is floured nicely.

Another great bread recipe!  I added one tablespoon of flour since it had been raining here for days and it was very humid. I didn't separate the dough since I wanted one large loaf.  The dough turned out beautiful and soft with great flavor.

this was a really good and easy bred. I spiced it up by replacing one cup of flour with whole wheat flour and adding some fresh rosemary. It had a nice crunchy crust. the only thing I did not like was the bread machine instructions I don't have one so figuring out the mix and rise time was a bit difficult.

Excellent, light and fluffy with a super crispy crust.  My whole family was very pleased and thought they were purchased from our local bakery.  I cut them into individual pillows prior to baking so everyone could enjoy the crunchy edges.  I bake bread often and absolutely LOVE the simplicity and ease of using a break maker for this recipe!  Definitely a keeper!

I used my Kitchenaid Mixer. I proofed the yeast with the water and sugar in the Kitchenaid bowl until foamy. I added the rest of the ingredients to the bowl and mixed. Left the very soft dough in the bowl for about 20 minutes. Took it out and shaped on a Parchment paper Cookie Sheet to let is rise. Came out perfect

Though this bread is delicious I wouldn't call it a ciabatta.  This is probably mostly on my part however.  I prepared the dough in the traditional sense, kneading it by hand on my floured counter and in that way added a lot more flour than intended.  However before I started kneading I was surprised at how non sticky it was.  After making challah consistently nothing looks 'too wet' anymore I suppose.  Another thing I did was swap 3/4 cup white flour for whole wheat.  Instead of spritzing, I brushed water with a pastry knife and also had a pan filled with water in the oven-I was terrified I would burn my arm off.  Still-a delicious loaf.  I am a total die hard for a crust brushed with water or egg white (aha as seen by my obsession with challah)

I followed the spritzing tip and the bread turned out very good.  Next time, I'll add herbs.

I made this bread today, and while the dough is very sticky, floured hands will take care of that. This recipe made 2 loaves that were awfully tasty. Kids gobbled it right up. I did everything according to the recipe, except, I did not use a bread machine. This is a keeper.

Delicious! I might brush it with egg before I bake it though, it was a bit pale.

Anyone out there who has made this bread successfully can help .... My dough is not runny as most reviews mentioned. Instead it is almost like pizza dough - nice and smooth but slightly sticky to the touch. Am I on the right track ?

I have made this bread several times now and although it is sticky I didn't find the dough too difficult to work with and it makes a lovely loaf. Thanks for the recipe

Tried this last weekend for the first time.  It was Much better than the brands I have purchased from Food Lion and Wal Mart. That is the extent of choices in our town. Very chewy on the outside and soft on the inside. Used bread machine to mix, did spritz and followed directions pretty much as indicated Getting ready to try it again and add my own touches for variety.

It was extremely humid when I made this bread so I don't know how much that affected it but when I took the dough out of the bread machine it was almost liquid.  I had to add much more flour to get a dough consistency.  It did rise some but not enough to be able to cut in half for a sandwich.  It was also hard as a rock the next day (could have been from the extra flour.)  The pieces I was able to salvage did taste good though.

If you are looking for a crunchy bread to serve with soups and salads, this is the recipe for you!!! It is quick, easy, and flavorful. I don't have a bread machine so I just used my KitchenAid mixer to mix the dough.  If using this method, use hot water and  measure the flour carefully. I would add up to 2 1/4 cups  initially, and then just add enough flour until the dough has a soft and sticky consistency. If the dough should happen to become too thick (as mine did), just add a little more water.  I used olive oil to prepare pan, worked great. This was the first time I made ciabatta bread and I couldn't be happier with the results!  As warned in the recipe, do not add extra flour,  otherwise you will not obtain the true texture that this type of bread should have. It is important to spritz the loaves with water as they bake to obtain the wonderfully crispy and crunchy loaf of bread. Great reheated. Wrap loaves in foil, opening foil the last 2 or 3 minutes to add crispiness to top of loaves. Just as good as from  the bakery,  if not better!!

Lovely!  I baked this as the "virgin run" in my la Cloche; removed top and baked for additional 4 min (no spritzing).  We made an olive oil, basil, red pepper 'dip' and had for supper with a few olives and wine. P.S.  I halved this recipe first time as I wanted to test la Cloche, and it worked perfectly.

I have used this recipe more often than any other for bread in my machine.  I had the notion this morning to put fresh herbs in the loaf I'm going to make for Christmas! :)
Once the dough cycle finishes, I plop the dough onto a floured surface and cut in 2 with a large knife.  I DON'T shape or dimple, I just invert the dough lumps onto parchment paper, so the floured side is up and bake after it rises.
Perfect every time.  And I'm sure it'll be even more awesome with fresh herbs!!!

Well it is not Pandera.  It was not bad but not good. There should be that sour taste to it and there was none. It was more frenc bread than ciabatta. I think the only way to really get that is to use a starter or sponge.

Very easy and very good.  I followed the recipe exactly and had superb results.  Next time, I might try rolls or smaller buns, suitable for individual sandwiches.

I didn't use a bread machine, the bread turned out just great. I wasn't sure where to mix the yeast, water or flour mix, so since I used dry yeast I just mixed it with the dry ingredients and added water later. The dough wasn't runny at all, just very sticky. The bread tastes great!

I made this bread last night and it turned out well. It was not overly sticky or soupy and was fairly easy to work with. I did warm the water and proofed the yeast with the sugar in the bread machine before adding the other ingredients. I am only rating this a 4 because, although the bread is good, it's not ciabatta. It has good flavor, but not a ciabatta flavor. It would be a good substitute when I don't have enough time (or energy) to deal with the biga.

This is a great recipe !  My nephew loves ciabatta , but he and my husband prefer the bread as individual large  hamburger size "roll". Took me awhile to get the handling down (lot of sticky dough all over everything for awhile!), but liberal flour dusting and folding the dough before cutting and shaping seems to help a lot !

I cut the recipe in half, and it turned out perfect! I didn't have anything to spritz water on it, so I tried to moisten it with a rag throughout the baking time- the crust didn't come out as crispy, but it sure was tasty! I really didn't have any problems with runny dough or making an oval of 3 X 14... expect the dough to be sticky, light, and pretty soft. Awesome bread, especially when used in a tuna fish sandwich!

I will not buy bread again, and I make this.
I also can not wait to make it for my friends. You must take the advice of the reviewer Apr. 9, 2006 by Rodney Dowdle

What a fantastic, simple recipe! The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly. It really wasn't runny our soupy like many people have said and the recipe predicted, but the texture turned out perfectly, so I'm not worried. Instead of two large loaves, I split the dough into 6 equal loaves, which ended up being PERFECT for sandiches. 
I've since begun substituting 1.5 cups of whole wheat flour to give a little extra 'healthy,' and making the total amount of flour 3 1/2 cups (and extra 1/4 cup). Still turns out excellent, and doesn't change the texture a bit!

A big hit. Mine didn't turn out with large holes, but then, we didn't care. I used 1/2 and 1/2 whole wheat flour and a little gluten flour (1 Tbsp). It was a spongy dough, but not runny. I covered it with plastic wrap and a towel for the resting period. I also use waxed paper with flour on it instead of a floured board. It was easy to pick up the edges of the paper when it came time to transfer it onto a stone for baking. We will definitely bake this one again. Thanks Marina

I found this recipe difficult to deal with.  The dough seemed almost too sticky to handle.  My bread didn't rise as much as I had expected.  My flour was new and the yeast was new, so I know that could not have affected the rise.  I think this difficult transfer (because it is so sticky) is what is causing the bread not to rise as much as it should.

just made this and i was pretty sure it wasnt going to turn out, but it did!  the dough was just a gross sticky blob when i baked it, it hardly rose and was pale when finished (not golden brown) but its great bread, great crumb inside.  will be making into yummy sandwiches this week (fantastic w/ carmelized onions!).

I read the top reviews about this bread and decided to make it even though it was said to be somewhat hard, yes the dough right out of the bread maker is a bit like cake dough, but the end product is really good.  I worked in a baker as a cake maker right along side with bread bakers and they told me Ciabatta bread is one of the hardest to make.  So thanks for the wonderful recipe which makes ciabatta bread easy.  One helpful hint is to prevent it from sticking put a lot of flour on the board and baking sheet.

Made this and everyone loved it. I will be making this several times.  My only complaint is that everyone wolfed down both loafs fast.  Guess my bread machine will get a good work out with this one.

Fantastic recipe! I use the stand mixer method with the editors note. I make a bunch of these at one time, because this bread tends to disappear quickly! Thank you for the recipe!

I've  made these into rolls for sandwiches pretty often ( never tried the loaf ) they are much better than even "Panera's " Ciabatta , They freeze well too . The recipe made 8 large rolls - I send them with my husband and son to work for lunch , they like it because it holds a lot without getting soggy  by  mid-day . I baked for 12 min ( till inside reached 205* ) they came out perfect .

I have made this bread multiple times, but I use a food processor.  I do not proof the yeast, I use so much yeast it would be rare for it to go beyond its potency.  All of the ingredients go into the food processor for about 2-3 minutes.  

I bake the loaf on a stone (put it in the oven while it is preheating) and spritz with water every few minutes develop a nice crust.

Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I sliced the first loaf and toasted it in the oven with olive oil.  Served with baked brie...delicious!  I put the second loaf in the freezer and it was just as tasty as the first.  Definitely going to bake again soon!

I made this with old instant yeast and old active dry yeast around double the recipe amount total, and a mixture of 1/3 cu. bread flour, 1 cu. whole wheat flour, and the remainder white AP flour, with an additional 1/4 cu. because it usually seems necessary for me. I mixed the yeast and flour together by hand before mixing in the salt and then the liquids and so on. My stand-up mixer performed the mixing of the water and kneading. I had to stop and mush the dough ball a little bit after adding the oil, because sometimes it slipped off the hook, rather than be kneaded. Maybe my bowl is too big.
Regardless, the bread turned out tasty and spongy. I sprayed it a bunch of times with water and baked it in the oven with a bowl of water (maybe the bowl was too small) to try to get a crispier crust, but it didn't quite turn out that way. It still works well for its intended purpose, dipping in olive oil, basalmic vinegar, garlic and spices. Very tasty. The bread smells good.
I have to admit after it rose, I was a little concerned that it wouldn't turn out well because it didn't spring back after I pushed it in, but that's probably because my yeast was half-dead. It seems to be the same thickness as the bread pictured on the recipe page.
Anyway, enjoy!

Excellent bread and so easy to make letting the bread machine make the dough! Followed the recipe and it turned out great. Very sticky dough but not as sticky as 7up biscuits. Will be making this often.

Being from Philadelphia, I know good rolls and bread and there are so many things I love about this bread recipe!!  The flick with a finger crisp crust, the dense heaviness of the bread like a wonderful ciabatta should be, the ease of the recipe and the taste......AMAZING and our go to bread recipe!!  Thanks!!

Amazing! I made the dough in the bread machine, but forgot about it for a while (maybe a half hour) once it was done with the dough cycle.  When I took it out, I broke it into 8 sections to make rolls.  I didn't let it set the recommended amount of time, and it still turned out wonderful!  Since they were rolls instead of a loaf, I baked them for 15 minutes.  We will definitely make these again!

This is a wonderful bread and I make it often. Has anyone tried using whole wheat flour and if so, how did it turn out?

No changes to the original recipe. I do cut it with a knife and make individual rolls. Always get compliments.

How is it that I haven't made this one before? The use of the bread machine to do most of the work is a great time saver. I followed the directions to a "t" and ended up with two beautiful loaves, which I couldn't resist to slice a little sliver while it was still warm and slather it with Nutella! Mmmm! Will make again. Thanks for the recipe!

The flavor and the crust of the ciabatta is spot on, however the inside texture is not quite right (no large holes)not sure if it needs more hydration, or to incorporate the biga starter. I will have to experiment. Either way it is an excellent bread and very easy.

I am thrilled with this recipe!!! First time to make it, didn't have enough bread flour, so I substituted cake flour for about 12 the flour needed. Added 1-1/2 tsp dried rosemary/garlic to batter. Used the knead setting on my bread machine and followed the rest of the directions. Misted with water every 3 minutes the first 10 mins, as suggested in comments. Excellent! Crispy outside, tender& moist inside!

There is something at minimum unclear, at worst wrong, about the water/flour ratio, as many others have noted. "3 1/4 cups" of flour is ambiguous; I wish the original poster would give this figure in grams instead: some guides say 1 cup = 120g; in my hands it was 130g; but everything depends on how the flour is scooped or ladled.  What I got, even at 130, was an unmanageable soup; reminded me of pancake batter. I had to add flour, lots of it; now I'm waiting for it to rise and bake; I expect it will taste fine--but not like ciabatta.

I have made French bread, Italian bread, pizza dough, cinnamon rolls, and a few others from a bread machine. Sure everytime you use a breadmachine theres a little tweeking that could be done the"next time". Not here. This recipie was awesome the first time.

I make this bread in my bread machine.  I make it as white bread, or I make it as whole wheat (2 cups bread flour, 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1/4 cup of  ground Flax seed. I am a type 2 diabetic so using less sugar and more fiber is important to me.  This bread is delicious!

Really good bread. Yes, the dough is VERY sticky and somewhat hard to work with , but the end result is SO good. I have also used coarse salt on the bread while baking and have tried adding dry Italian herbs, both really good. Finally, I didn't spritz while baking, but filled a 13x9 half full with water and put it on the rack below the bread before turning the oven on. This worked great as well.

Try, try again. I fretted the sticky, wet dough but the dough was just a little wetter than bread dough. The loaves didn't rise and they didn't brown.  Smelled good, looked terrible and was a bit, actually quite a bit, crusty but the taste is there just a lot more crust than bread. I guess I just need more practice. Seems I just needed fresh flour.....Made 2 batches last night. Cooked in 8 inch round pie plates and before the 2nd loaf was cooked hubby had already eaten first loaf.  The dough was sticky but not as bad as I was expecting. Don't let the dough warning stop you from trying it. Plan to stock the freezer over the next few days, if they last long enough to freeze. A little bit crusty but I lightly coated with butter after removing from oven. That gave it a nice brown color and slightly softened the crust.

I seem to have a hard time with getting any bread I make to be 'airy'.  But the flavor was spot on with this one!  I can't wait to make it again.  I prepared the sponge the night before and left alone for about 32 hours.  Perfect!

Excellent recipe thank you. I've made it a few times now and it's getting easier to deal with the very soft dough. Firstly, I wet my hands and that keeps the dough from sticking. Also, be really careful to follow instructions for your machine. My machine doesn't want the yeast coming into contact with the water and it does make a difference to the rise. Also, don't forget to just check that all the dough is incorporated after the machine has run for a few seconds. This recipe makes excellent rolls too, don't try to shape too much

Great recipe.  Super easy, though the dough is a little tricky to work with.  I make this several times a week!

Love this recipe! The whole family scarfs it up the minute I make it. I do not make any changes to the recipe. I am a relative bread-baking newbie, so I will mention for other newbies that I found it makes a huge difference, if you are baking it on a baking sheet, to use one of those silicon mesh baking pads underneath the dough.

The dough was sticky, but the results were wonderful! I liked the chewy/crispy crust and the texture of the bread itself. Don't be expecting a regular looking loaf of bread--this one spreads and remains fairly flat.  I will be making this again for sure!

I have made this bread quite a few times already, love the chewy texture.  Make  sure to use the bread flour though it makes ALL the difference.  I tried all purpose once as i was out of bread flour.  I ended up with a heavy very dense loaf, total opposite of what it should be.  Will definitely make again.

I am from the "old school" of bread making and resorted to the standard hand kneading of the dough.  I have only one word to describe it...scrumdiddlyumptious! 
Yes I WILL make this recipe again...real soon!

One of my all time favorites! I immediately roll out the dough onto non stick foil that is floured. Then I score the dough for bun size and let it rise covered with a cloth for an hour. Spritz with water, bake, and let the magic happen!

I made this bread for the first time. I am very beginner of baking but it seems I succeeded making this recipe. I put all ingredients into my bread machine and set dough cycle. While The machin kneading the dough I had to scrape it off from the wall of the pan. It was very sticky. After knead, the dough needed to be rested but the machine setting was moving for kneading again. So I turned the machine off and leave the dough there for 15 mins.  I sprayed water every 3 mins for for first 10 mins of baking as other reviewers' recommend. Outside of bread is crunch. Inside is chewy and moist. The bread is little salty for my taste. So I'll reduce salt next time. I'll make this recipe again.

It stole the show at my dinner party! Made the dough in my bread machine, let it sit in there for 20 minutes. The dough was sticky but not unmanageable. Shaped and rolled well, rose well and into the oven! I didn't have a spray bottle so just threw some water on top with my fingers and called it a day! Baked beautifully and tasted exactly like it should! I spent all day making a chiffon cake and all anyone wanted to talk about is this bread!

I did not use a bread machine. Made 2 hours before I went to bed. Placed in the refrigerator over night. Don't worry it won't hurt it. Take out in the morning punch down, let rise on baking sheet 1-2 hours and you will get this monster loaf!

I do like this recipe, but I find that the hydration is too low. I added an extra 3/4 cup of filtered water to my zojirushi bread machine (takes about 4 hours to turn it into dough). I prefer SAF yeast for consistency, I keep it in the freezer to have it keep longer in a zip lock bag. Remember to preheat  for at least 40mins, I use a pizza stone for the base.

What can be said? Absolutely perfect. I used the stand mixer method and followed recipe exactly except I let the yeast "bloom" for about 10 minutes before adding flour. My daughter said it tasted like gourmet bread from a restaurant. Very easy, crispedy, crunchedy crust and wonderful flavor. Make this now!

I don't use bread machines as I find the stirring and kneading process therapeutic.  Instead I proofed the yeast with the warm water and sugar, then added the rest of the ingredients. The dough is very sticky as warned so I didn't knead it. Instead I stirred and folded for 4 minutes, then followed the rest of the recipe as written. Think chewy crust makes this a perfect dipping bread.

The first time I made this, I made the water too hot, and it just ran out of the bread machine. The second time, I heated the water to 70 degrees, and, as you can see by the picture, it came out perfectly. This is my go-to ciabatta recipe from now on. Now all I have to do is figure out how to make the ciabatta rolls.

This is a rather easy recipe. I followed this recipe as it was listed (including a reviewer's tip to spray the tops a few times the first 10 minutes), except I divided the dough into 6 pieces to make buns for hamburgers. It only took 15-20 minutes cooking time for them. They turned out great! The buns were about the size of the larger deluxe buns, so next time I will make 8 smaller ciabattas.

I use a stand mixer, proof the yeast before mixing (a must), and spritz with water every couple of minutes at the beginning of baking.  I also don't divide the dough and make only one large loaf.  I have a hard time finding bread that I like and when I do it's usually very expensive.  This recipe is just as good as a bakery and much cheaper.  If you generally don't bake with yeast don't be dissuaded.  Follow the instructions closely and you'll be fine.

What I did was:  3 T Olive O, 3 C AP flour, 1.5 t each salt and sugar, 1/38 + 1T whole milk, 1.5 t yeast.  Out of machine, it is not wet at all.  I would even say 'dry'.  I will increase liquid next time if this turns out half good.  

In the end, it's nice bread, but not even close to ciabatta.  Even grain, small-hole sponge.  I do know from experience that using the maximum amount of water will produce larger holes - the normal bread I make every week has about 1/58 cup water to 3 cups flour and it's still handleable if a little sticky.  However, I'm afraid a slow rise might be required for that real ciabatta texture.  Since I didn't follow the recipe, I can't rate it low and will try again with the right ingredients but more water for sure.  Wondering how others got pourable dough with the amount of water listed?  Also, spraying with water wets the dry flour so you don't get that 'floured' look.  Obvious, but not till you do it I guess.  

Finally, disappointed that the picture I uploaded here just goes into the batch instead of staying with these comments.  But, there is one that shows just what I'm talking about if you look for it!

My family loves this recipe. It is sticky and a bit hard to work with but the flavour and texture is completely worth that tiny bit of inconvenience. I make this regularly and don't change a thing.

Great results! I did not find the dough sticky at all, but I used my stand mixer, mixed the water, sugar, and yeast and let it bloom for about 15 minutes. I added the flour and salt and ran my mixer for 4-5 min, then I drizzled the olive oil around the sides of the mixing bowl while it was mixing on low.  I let it go for another 4-5 min and it slid right out of the bowl onto my parchment paper.
Fantastic tasting bread, a keeper!!

I give this 4 stars instead of five for the pure fact that this does not make a ciabatta bread. It does however, make a wonderful french loaf. Extremely easy and tasty. Instead of making two loaves I made a larger loaf and two rolls.

I am an experienced bread maker, but admittedly have never tried ciabatta before. Even so, this seemed like a lot of work and time for mediocre results. It takes far longer than the time stated in the recipe, for one thing - about three hours for me - and the dough is so hard to work with that it was more trouble than it was worth.

I followed the recipe and brush water with olive oil every 5 min after the first 10 min of baking.  Set at 220C.  The crust is soft, not the hard crust that I expected.  How to make a hard and crispy crust?

Fabulous bread and even better (6) large, sturdy (but not tough) buns for Sloppy Joes or burgers.  Smaller/flatter buns make great toast or a replacement for English muffins.  Leftover bread makes great croutons.  I make this 2-3x/wk.  It's easy and fast in a breadmaker, just a little kneading and shaping at the end to get the size and shape you want, but not too much for anyone to handle and just enough for someone to get the hang of bread-making beyond just using a machine.

Really liked this recipe and family loved the end results.  I don't have a bread miachine so mixed with mixer.  Extremely sticky but do not add more flour.  Covered and let rise for 45 min.  Separated dough into five sections and formed in to ciabatta rolls.  Let rise for 15 min and baked for 25 min.  The best rolls for hamburgers in no time at all!  Will not buy rolls again.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the best bread ever!!!  I have made this about 5 times now in the past 4 weeks.  I took the advice of Rodney Dowdle's review about putting a pan of water in the oven and spraying the bread every 3 minutes for the first 9 minutes and then letting it bake for 15 minutes.  Comes out perfectly browned!!  Other than the water spraying, I didn't change a thing.  Love this recipe.  I am never buying bread again!  Thank you!!!1

I only had rapid rise yeast and before the chance happened to pull out the pan it was baking. My daughter really wanted this bread as it was intended. After it cooled I cut into it and crusty on the outside and delicious on the inside. The loaf is tiny and in all likelyhood will be consumed during dinner. Even with a problem with bread machine this is a keeper.

I can't believe there hasn't been any reviews on this bread since 2009.  I found it to be simple to use.. Loved the idea of the spatula and a metal spatula.  I coated it with flour which made the process easier.  I just have to learn to make two even loaves, but who cares.. IT WAS AWESOME!!  I did the spritz every 8 min till it was done and came out with a crunchy crust.  I'm going to try make rolls the next time.  I've had other Italian bread dough be a little loose, but resting it for 15 and then rising for 45 worked perfectly...

Very good! Especially dipped in olive oil and balsamic vinegar. I used regular flour and increases the yeast to 2 tsp. came out perfect, not very sticky at all. Made into 8rolls instead of single loaf, baked for 22minutes total, and did a final baste of olive oil with a sprinkling of sea salt. 5minutes after coming out of the oven, my husband was asking me to make more! This is a keeper recipe

This came out great! Did not use a bread machine. Dough was very sticky, but stuck to recommendations and did not add any more flour. Glad I did! Added some rosemary per one reviewer's recommendation and it was awesome. I want to eat the whole loaf right now! (Note: Used bread flour only, no AP needed.)

Have experience making yeast breads.The texture of this bread gives breakfast casseroles a great texture. Like to toast slices for tapenade.I find using a Pam coated spatula best way to handle/divide batter.Pour onto parchment paper and let rise. I do not dimple and handle carefully, as it tends to deflate if knocked about.

The dough was so wet, it oozed on my board.  It did bake up as pictured and looked pretty nice, but my daughter's first comment was, "You've made better bread than this."  It was too salty for our family to eat and we are saving it to make a strata or bread crumbs with.

I forgot to add the oil, so I will not rate this the 4 stars I would pick.

I did not have issues with this dough being too damp.  However, I did have an issue with part of the bottom somehow not developing a crust, which was a little bizarre.

Overall, this was a good recipe, and perfect for hearty sandwiches.  I would not eat it as a dipping bread, as it is a little low on flavor for that.

This ciabatta bread is so easy and pretty much fail proof!
I have successfully added other things in like garlic and sun dried tomatoes.
I make this all the time.  Perfect for dipping, sandwiches, and toast!

this recipe was so easy to follow that my 4 & 2 year old children helped me to make it. Although it did not get all the nice airy holes that ciabatta usually has it was still very good. My husband said e it was the best bread that we have ever made.

This recipe rocks - tastes just like the bread you would buy from a bakery - we strongly suggest that you try it and don't be afraid of how wet the dough is it all works out and the bread is airy and the crust is crispy an awesome loaf you will love it!!!!

The dough came out like batter, supper runny. I measured exactly, my ingredients are fresh (just made bread yesterday with it) and I've been using my bread machine for months now. Terrible recipe.

I'm actually looking for some advice :-)  I have made this bread a few times and the first 2 it turned out perfect!  Chewy on the inside and crispy on the out.  The last few times however it has turned out more like normal bread.  Soft and nice, but nothing like ciabatta... any one have ideas?  I followed the recipe exactly the same all times (at least I think I did...).

Easy to make, firm but soft, and paired perfectly with BBQ chicken. Family loved the meal! I also made it into buns instead of loaves by shaping them at the first dimpling stage and dipping them in sesame seeds. After rising again, I dimpled the second time and slipped into the oven for baking. It made six buns that were about 4" in diameter.

Very good recipe!  I've been playing with the amount of olive oil to add - more makes the though a little denser, less makes it lighter but less texture.  Give it a try - easy to make and tastes great!

This was a good recipe - nice chewy crust and great interior. I appreciated Jajam's tip about the all-purpose flour, seeing as it's the only kind I had on hand. I just watched closely during the kneading part of the cycle and added flour by the tablespoon until the dough was still quite moist but no longer puddled when the paddle stopped moving. I ended up adding about 3 tablespoons of extra flour. Very happy with the result. I made a loaf as well as several rolls, one of which I used to make a sandwich for lunch today - really good!

This recipe turned out very well. I didn't need to spray the loaves as the recipe called for. The crust turned out just fine for me. Yesterday I made a roast beef on ciabatta with sriracha mayo, gruyere & swiss, and a sliced tomato. Heated it a little under the broiler to melt the cheeses & toast the crust. Turned out DELICIOUS. I will make this recipe many more times.

This recipe was easy and delicious. It turned out better then the ciabatta bread I have been buying.I had a turkey sandwich and it was the best sandwich I ever had I still can't believe it was so easy to make.

Fantastic bread! I made the dough in the bread machine, and since it rests and rises there as well, I skipped the first rising outside of the machine. I made two loafs, covered them and let them rise for 45 min., as the recipe says. Following other reviewers' advice, I put a bowl with water on the bottom of the oven, and sprinkled water on the loafs every 4-5 min. After the bread was ready, I covered it and let it cool before slicing. It is extremely delicious!

This is a recipe you really can't go wrong with. I substituted practically everything for ingredients I already had (whole wheat flour instead of white, brown sugar instead of white, sea salt) and it turned out lovely

Amazing flavour and simple to make! I like to make rosemary infused olive oil and brush the tops when they are hot out of the oven for a nice subtle rosemary taste.

This was a delicious sandwhich bread, but i don't think that it can stand alone.  I made this without a bread machine by proofing the yeast in the warm water with a T of honey, then adding the rest of the ingredients.  Knead, and let rise for 1 1/2.  Deflate, shape, let rise again, cook.  Easy peasy.  Definately spritz with water and keep an eye on it, mine browned very quickly.  Nice texture, crunchy and partially chewy.

My family loves this bread. I have made it exactly as specified in the recipe and the family says they prefer it to loaves of ciabatta bread bought at the store. I bought a spritzer at the dollar store for misting. Not a big expense for something that the whole family loves. NOTE: never any leftovers!

This was great! I served it with bean soup.  I was extremely nervous, because the dough was UNBELIEVABLY liquidly.  But it worked out fine.

Great recipe!  The dough is very, very sticky, but after reading other reviews, I used a spatula to scoop it out and shape it, and this worked well.

You need to use more yeast like 2&1/4 teaspoon yeast (one packet) and 2 teaspoons of sugar. Part of the reason this bread doesn't get the full rise is because it doesn't use a starter which traditional ciabatta does; so you just needed a little more yeast. Also use some seasonings! You aren't making a sour loaf so try using garlic or rosemary. And if you want an even better crust, drop two ice cubes into the oven every 10 minutes rather than spraying down the bread. All-in-all it's a pretty good recipe for a basic bread.

I used some of the dough to make pizza dough and my family said it was the best pizza dough ever.  I used the rest for bread dough and it was nice and crispy on the outside- since I put a little water on top while baking.  I'll definitely make again!

I've made this twice now and all I can say is WOW.  Friends and family all agree this is an amazing recipe.  I followed the measurements exactly, the only change is I baked on a preheated stone pan and spritzed with water for only the first 10 minutes.  Amazing crunch on the outside and a wonderful hole-filled moist bread on the inside.  I plan to make this again and again (goes perfectly with soup).

mmm this is super good! I dont have a spray bottle to mist my bread with so i just put a few ice cubes in the bottom of the oven but I would have liked it to be a little crustier. I added two finely chopped jalapenos and a large handful of shredded cheddar cheese. It is super good toasted and buttered. My dough was of course sticky but not too difficult and it rose perfectly fine.

i love this recipe.  I make it without the bread maker.  It is really sticky but do avoid adding more flour.  I chop up fresh herbs and olives and add to the loaves, which makes this a huge hit. Makes great pannini sandwich bread and is really nice with soup.

Excellent recipe with fantastic texture.  Worked out perfectly using my bread machine.  I posted pictures of it and I'm using it for pizza crust after baking it.  I'm sure this crust will be delicious.  I did add about 1/2 tsp of garlic powder to the dough and it's made the bread very nice.  I used 1 loaf for our pizzas and the other loaf I cut into some slices to dip in evoo and some seasonings.  Woweee.. better than the restaurant!

My beloved bread maker broke. I had a new one I was unfamiliar with and could not figure out how to use the dough recipe. I ended up getting on Basic, 3 hrs and 20 minutes later, it was done. The best bread I have ever made! Making my 2nd loaf only days after the first. Note; the top sunk about 1/2 inch. It did not ruin the bread, but don't be concerned. The best recipe! Thanks!

This is excellent!  My mom and I both tried it and everyone loves it at both of our houses!  I was so glad you said not to add more flour.  I definitely would have!  We made ours in long, french bread pans and they rose and were so delicious!  I even baked some for the neighbors!!!!!

This came out wonderfully!  I didn't have parchment paper, so I brushed olive oil on the pan.  It made the crust a little crispy and it had a great flavor.  This is better than what you can buy in your local bakery!

very good bread...we cut the recipe in half and made it that way but the end results were a crusty outside with a soft spongey interior...we loved it!

Not a true Ciabatta, but still a very good loaf of white fluffy bread.  I used plain old white flour and it turned out very well.

I don't know if it was the fact that I used SAF yeast instead of bread machine yeast or the fine sea salt I used or what but this loaf just did not work for me. Yes, the dough was runny, as expected, but it just did not rise at all. My result was two loaves of flat, rather dense bread, not the "holey" ciabatta I was hoping for. I'll keep trying though....

This recipie reminds me of aplain old flat bread.  The biga is really needed for a Ciabatta loaf taste.  I suppose if one is in a hurry it wil do but then so would a french loaf, or italian bread.

This was VERY good!! I love ciabatta bread and this is as good as it gets.  Beats spending $4.00 a loaf in the store for it. It is VERY sticky!! Hard to handle, but not impossible. I used AP flour because of a reviewers suggestion.  It's great with olive oil.  It doesn't cook up very high, only about 1", so don't know if it would be that great for sandwhiches. But for snacking on it's great!!

This turned out perfectly.  I even  subbed 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour for some of the bread flour and while it may not have risen as much as it would have, it turned out better than any loaf of any bread we've ever bought from a store.  This one's a keeper!

I had no trouble making this recipe. I didn't have bread flour so I sifted regular flour right into the bread pan. Perhaps that helped with the stickiness others are reporting. It wasn't too sticky at all, just a bit. However, my husband and I agreed that it didn't have much taste to it. Was rather bland for us.

I make this in my bread machine and add a bit more flour as I knead/shape it so it is as firm as other breads I make.  It's become my default bread for home, pot lucks, etc.  I bake it with a pan of hot water in the oven, cool it about an hr. then bag it so the crust becomes nice and chewy.

The quantities I used are (from my Phillips breadmaker book):
1 tsp yeasr
500g white bread flour
1 tsp sugar
1 tsp salt
350ml water

As this has slightly less water and slightly more flour, it is easier to work with - still a bit sticky but not runny. I don't know if the end product is better or worse as I haven't tried the other quantities. You can use it to make a normal-sized loaf if you have an Italian bread setting on your breadmaker. 

I was looking for an easy way to make ciabatta-shaped ciabatta and this recipe is easy and works! Thanks.

although I read thru the reviews warning me about the very wet dough, I must have missed something because the dough was SO wet that I couldn't shape it.  The end result was 'ok' - but more doughy and not as light as ciabattas should be.  What did I do wrong?

This is very good bread. I will make this whenever I do not have the time to make the sponge. However, my preference is to make the sponge for ciabatta; the dough is much easier to work.

Love it!  I cannot seem to find ciabatta bread locally, and I miss it, so I am thrilled for this recipe.  Just like I remember from when I was growing up.

I followed the instructions exactly and both loaves turned out great!  I also sprayed the tops with water every 3 minutes and then brushed the tops with EVOO when there was about 5 minutes left.  I will certainly be making this again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

We have always bought this bread from our bakery for anything that had a lot of sauce and needed a bread to soak it up. Soups and pasta sauces mostly.  This recipe, being fresher and warmer is as good as the bakery's,
