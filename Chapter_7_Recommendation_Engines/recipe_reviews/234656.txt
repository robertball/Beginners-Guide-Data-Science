Great tasting muffins.  I recommend adding extra rhubarb but otherwise followed recipe as is.

I replaced the oil with applesauce and added a half cup more of rhubarb. I also used plain greek yogurt and a tsp of vanilla instead of vanilla yogurt. They turned out very good; not too sweet and a nice healthier version of rhubarb muffin.

My family raved about these. I made only minor changes, but if you're easily offended by such reviews, please move on... As I do in all muffin recipes, I added 1/8 cup each ground flaxseed meal and wheat germ, subbed applesauce for the oil, and used Splenda (brown sugar) baking blend. I also upped the baking soda, salt, and cinnamon to 1 tsp each. Used a whole 6 oz container of french vanilla yogurt, and subbed unsalted butter in the topping because I had it on hand. The topping is absolutely fabulous and just the right amount - I will definitely try the topping on my other muffin recipes! I added the rhubarb to the wet ingredients instead of the dry, don't think it adversely affected the results though. I made mini muffins in a dark pan, baked at 325 for 17 min. So yummy! I think you could successfully sub pineapple for the rhubarb too.

Delicious! Taking a queue from other reviews to cut fat and calories and use up more of my prolific rhubarb, I used 2 c. rhubarb, plain greek yogurt + 1 tsp vanilla, instead of vanilla yogurt and substituted 1/2c applesauce for the oil. The combo made 12 perfectly sized muffins that were moist, perfectly tart with that nice crunch from the topping (w/double the oats!). Next time I'll try substituting a flax meal for some of the white flour and boost the nutrition even more. These are a keeper!

I took the muffins to work and they were devoured within minutes.  Everyone loved them.  The recipe is perfect the way it is - no changes needed.

Good basic muffin. Increased rhubarb slightly (1.5 cups?). Added 1 tsp vanilla to batter, which is very thick. Used applesauce instead of oil and added more cinnamon. Doubled  topping, cooked 350 for 18 min. Perfect, very moist

My sons and I loved this recipe.  I added 1/2 cup more rhubarb and a nectarine the second time I made it, I also doubled the rolled oats topping. With peach season here I think you could successfully sub peaches for the rhubarb too.

Just did my second batch of these.  I love them just the way they are.  I do suggest you have the rhubarb chopped up pretty small.  Might try the suggested version of using apple sauce on my next batch.

I love these just as they are.  The slightly tart flavor the rhubarb give these sweet muffins is wonderful.  Quick and easy when you have an abundance of rhubarb.  I've made them with fresh and with frozen rhubarb with equal success.

Very good, just the right amount of sweet and tart. I used 2 cups of rhubarb. The additional rhubarb did not make muffins watery. Moist and delicious. Definitely will make again.

Love that this recipe has whole wheat flour and yogurt, to add a little protein to the breakfast sweet. I put a sprinkling of sugar in the raw instead of the crumble topping and they were great!

Yummy! Moist and wonderful tasting.  I did as others suggested and increased the amount of rhubarb to 1.5 cups as I LOVE rhubarb.  Even though I did this, I still only ended up with 5 muffins.  Not sure what size of itty bitty muffin tins everyone else is using to get 12 muffins. :)

Substituted the oil with apple sauce. Didn't have enough brown sugar so used half brown sugar and half white sugar. Definitely best with the topping!

Full disclosure:  I'm celiac so I had to create a version of this recipe that was gluten free.  For the dry ingredients I used the "Namaste Gluten Free No Sugar Added Muffin Mix" as the basis of this recipe. To that I added the brown sugar and all of the other wet ingredients (replacing oil with apple sauce).  Since the mix was a little bigger than the quantity of listed dry ingredients, I added about 3/4 cup of orange juice and an extra egg to moisten it to the correct consistency.  I also used nearly 2 cups of rhubarb as recommended by other reviewers.  Oh, I have to tell you, I thought it was delicious!! The slight sourness of the rhubarb in contrast to the sweet crunch of the topping was so good. Although I had to make these muffins gluten free which necessitated different ingredients, I feel I can review this recipe as excellent anyway!  Yummy!!

Inadvertently used 1/3 cup of oil instead of 1/4, but the result was absolutely delicious. I am not a big rhubarb fan, and even I couldn't get enough of these!

These were fine, to be fair, I didn't have any yogurt so I used sour cream. I thought that would be an acceptable substitute but the batter was very thick and hard to mix up. There was no real texture to the muffins, they were like soft rolls. They were a bit bland and I added a couple of chopped strawberries to up the sweetness. I will try them again with the yogurt but I have a feeling that it won't make that much of a difference.
