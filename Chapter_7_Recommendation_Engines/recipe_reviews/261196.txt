I used a bag of frozen riced cauliflower. This was easy and good! My friends really liked it too.

This was absolutely delicious! I used a bag of pré-riced cauliflower, which I am fairly certain had more to it than a grated cauliflower would have, so I also used a whole small onion and two large cloves of garlic, as well as a bit more heavy cream and a pat of butter. It was a magnificent accompaniment to salmon. I will be making this quite often.

I thought this was really good! Grating the cauli makes you think you're eating a starchy side. It's nice to have an option like this to go along w/ your main dish and green veggies. I sub'd butter for ghee. Will definitely make again!!!

Absolutely divine! I used butter instead of ghee, and one large shallot instead of onion. I also cut the parmesan down to 1/4 cup and it was delicious. Even my kids enjoyed it.

This recipe is delicious. I am not crazy about the cauliflower taste of cauliflower rice but the carbs are so much better than rice. I don’t taste the cauliflower in this. My husband found it to be very satisfying, very flavorful and said “the texture is great!

I made this yesterday evening (had leftovers tonight).  It was amazing!!  The only thing I changed was I used butter instead of ghee and I used frozen riced cauliflower (Costco, 4 cups).  Everyone loved it, will definitely be making this again!

This recipe gave me the taste of a cheesy starchy dish without the carbs. I used olive oil instead of ghee. I added green peas, to cut calories instead of heavy whipping cream I added fat free cream cheese,  a squeeze of lemon, and sundried tomatoes! Yummy

This was excellent!  I used more garlic and mushrooms in this because I really like them.   Probably my all time favorite cauliflower recipe.  Thanks, Fioa!

So yummy. I'm lazy so I bought pre-riced cauliflower and precut onion. Also, I couldn't find ghee so I just used butter to substitute.

Such a great recipe! I used a bag of frozen cauliflower rice instead of chopping up my own cauliflower. It made the recipe so easy and tasted delicious! I'm so happy, I now have another side dish to add to my keto dishes!

Fantastic! Made it exactly as written. As a long-time low carber, I get very tired of cauliflower, but this dish makes me forget I am eating it. Could have been rice. A little bit of heaven!!!

This is so good!!  You'll never know you were eating cauliflower!  I like mushrooms, so I doubled what the recipe called for.  This is a side worthy of Sunday dinner or a Friday night  dining in.

I made as directed.  I felt like it just kept absorbing the salt.  It needed a ton to have any flavor.

I didn't have Parmesan cheese, so I subed cheddar cheese.  It was delicious. I will be making this dish again!  The cheddar and heavy cream melted wonderfully together to create a creamy sauce that was delicious. Next time I will buy cauliflower that is already diced. That took the longest; dicing up the cauliflower. But once everything is ready to go, it is a quick and easy dish to put together.

I used Asiago cheese and evaporated milk as I didn't have any cream on hand and added a little parsley. It was really good and very tasty and simple to make.

Like most risotto, makes a mess, but tasted great! Used frozen pre-riced cauliflower and just under cooked it a bit (mainly to defrost it). Worked out great!

Absolutely amazing!!  I added some extra heavy cream.  Had the cauliflower riced and frozen ahead of time which sped up my prep time. This is an easy and tasty dish.

Husband trying to stay low/no carb. I was very surprised at how good this is. Whole family loved it. Didn't change a thing except butter instead of ghee.

This is absolutely one of my favorite dishes now.  So easy to make and Keto so good for me.  I didn’t understand the nutmeg at first but it definitely adds some flavor to the recipe. Kudos

My husband loves risotto, and he loved this. He was surprised the "risotto" was actually riced cauliflower. I used a bag of frozen riced cauliflower from Aldi. I added a little yellow pepper, spinach, and grape tomatoes and they added a nice amount of color and flavor. A great addition to my healthy, quick and easy repertoire.

Depending on the head of cauliflower, I used more garlic, mushrooms  and freshly grated Parmesan, Kerry butter instead of Ghee; and all I can say is that this recipe is AMAZING and surely a keeper. We will make it again very soon.

This was pretty darn good. Not quite as creamy as traditional risotto but a great keto sub.
