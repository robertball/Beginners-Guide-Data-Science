I have been meaning to review this recipe, because I have been making it for a long time and, in fact, am eating a slice right now!!  

This makes an absolutely delicious cookie.  The directions are excellent and accurate.  The only thing I do differently is add 1 T dried orange peel in addition to the orange extract.  I've made it with chopped almonds when I'm out of walnuts and it still tastes fabulous.  

Everyone loves this cookie, and it keeps so well in tupperware.  It does seem to take twice as long to make because you slice and bake them a second time, but don't let that deter you.  It is worth it, and makes a decent number of cookies. 

 Make sure you watch them brown and turn them once during the browning step.  If you have cookie racks, it makes the cooling process go much faster. (As does a ceiling fan in the kitchen.)  

Try these cookies - they are great.

Incredible!!!  These are so good, so much better than I expected.  You gotta use the orange extract.  Totally made it.  I drizzled them with white chocolate afterwards.  I will be making these again and again...maybe tonight!

This is fun and easy to make. I didn't think there was enough dough to make 4 logs, so i only made 2. Don't be fooled! They rise alot. My biscuits were too big to be biscoti like, but they were great. Thanx

This is a great basic recipe. The first time I made it, I thought it tasted a little too oily, so I cut the oil to 1/2 cup and used 1/4 cup of butter for the flavor. I also added 1/4 tsp of salt. I did not have orange extract, so I used lemon instead with some lemon and orange zest and poppy seeds. I love recipes like this that you can change around each time you make them. Thanks for sharing!

This is a good recipe but a bit bland. Next time I would add orange zest.

My dad requested biscotti, so I quickly chose this recipe and presented the cookies as a Christmas gift (after sampling several myself with hot coffee!). I substituted vanilla extract for the orange and used sliced almonds and semi-sweet chocolate chips rather than walnuts. Absolutely delicious; they came out perfectly. This will definitely become one of my regulars.

Very good Biscotti.  I didn't have orange extract so used 1 tsp almond and 1 tsp vanilla.  I added 1/2 C choco chips.

Good for dunking in coffee or hot chocolate.  Alone they are not that great.  If I were to make them again, I would use a different type of nut (pecans) and add some dried fruit or chocolate.

I have been using this recipe for the past 3 years and it has never failed me!  I tend to bake it a bit longer both the first and second times (usually 30 minutes the first time at 325, and then after they cool I put them back in for 10 minutes on each side at 350).  They always turn out deliciously crunchy without being too dry and have great taste.  I always substitute chocolate chips for the nuts - it's by far the most requested thing I make!

Everyone loved these.  I used pecans and craisins and then left some plain, dipped some ends in chocolate and then drizzled some with chocolate. My loaves took 5 minutes longer to bake...i had them a little closer than 3 inches, maybe that's why. The dough is a little dry and crumbly with the stuff in it so to make your loaves...place a ball of dough onto plastic wrap and wrap losely like a burrito ,,then roll it to log shape and remove plastic

I have one big problem with this recipe: I CAN'T STOP EATING IT. I made it for gifts for the holidays and I've had to make several batches so I have enough to give after nibbling on them. It's wonderful, easy, and easily modified (you can "play with" the extracts, add raisins and/or other dried fruits and/or different nuts. After making about 6 batches, I think my favorite modification is changing the walnuts to pecans and using a combination of vanilla, almond, and orange extracts (keeping the total at 2 tsp). I also added some dried sweetened cranberries and dried cherries to give at Christmas (yes, it's a little odd to give Jewish cookies for Christmas gifts, but they were a hit and look festive with the additional red color). These are probably the easiest mondel brodt I've ever made... almost like my grandma's, but with much less effort! I like that they aren't overly sweet. They are a perfect accompaniment to coffee. They look and taste a lot more impressive than the effort they take to make. Thank you, Joan!

Pretty good mondel bread. It was the first time I made it so I had my friend that is Jewish try it and let me know if it was good, and she said it tastes like the one her grandmother made, so it past the test...

Very easy to make and tasty. I like how easy it is to eat. I added a change for the second bake and dusted the slices with cinnamon sugar to give a slightly sweeter taste.

This is an excellent recipe and mine gets gobbled up right away.  I use almonds for a traditional Mondel Brodt.

These cookies are fantastic!  I used the ingredients I had on hand, which were; Half butter and half oil (I only had a little bit of oil left), no nuts and lots of orange zest.  I dipped them in chocolate and they taste like those kebler elve cookies with the chocolate strips.

I was really surprised how good these turned out. They are wonderful with coffee. I dipped mine in chocolate. I think the next time I will put cherries in them. I've had Mondel Brodt with cherries and they are fabulous. Thanks for a great recipe

This was a great recipe! I've never made anything like this before so I tried it first with vanilla flavoring instead of orange and used some chocolate chips instead of walnuts. Today I made it the original way and it was awesome ~ so much better than the substitutes! I did add one more teaspoon of orange extract and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Thanks so much!

The best way to start my day is with 3 or 4 of these dipped in my tea. I used anise oil instead of orange extract, and dipped the finished slices in melted chocolate, then drizzled with white. I've tried chopped deluxe mixed nuts and chocolate chips, using vanilla instead of the anise flavor. Try it, you'll like it !

Great recipe - I've made it twice with great success both times.  I like to add a cup of chocolate chips to the batter in place of walnuts for an even sweeter treat!

These are absolutely wonderful.  I make them all the time and even my brother loves them and he is extremely picky!   I tend to add chocolate chips in them and they come out great.  I can guarantee everyone will love them.

Excellent shortbread type cookie.  I like a strong orange flavor, so added 1 T of orange zest.  Next time I will add more.

DELICIOUS soft biscotti!  I used chocolate chips, 1 tsp almond and 1 tsp vanilla extract and it was sensational!  I gave two of the loaves away and I'm wishing I would've kept one because I ate one for dinner and another the following day.  These are dangerously good!  I will try lemon extract and poppy seeds in the future!

These cookies are delicious very much like a biscotti Followed recipe exact except I use anise extract instead of orange because thats what I had on hand.I only bake once because thats the way I like biscotti and like I said these are like biscotti. I think next time I make these a combination of almond extract and dried cranberries would be good. Thanks for a great recipe.
