These are great fluffy cookies. I used 1 cup margerine and 1/2 cup olive oil because that is what I had. I also used regular milk instead of buttermilk. I topped them with sprinkles. They are a hit.

These cookies are just like the ones my Grandma taught me to make except she used more flour (5-6 c flour) and rolled out the dough. She always cut big round cookies using a upside down glass and topped each cookie with some sugar. Biggest thing to remember ***DO NOT overmix the dough or you will have rubbery/tough cookies*** Thanks for sharing the recipe. YUM!!!

Tried this recipe this morning. It makes A LOT! Next time I might scale down the recipe. The cookies turned out wonderfully - soft and fluffy! I sprinkled them with cinnamon and sugar. I actually live in Lancaster County, PA, and I have to say, these are very very close to what you might buy at Amish markets or country stores! :D

This is cake. For the love of God. And I don't mean 'it's a piece of cake.' It is a cake recipe. The Amish Sugar cake recipe is nearly identical. Please, if you truly are craving cookies in your dorm room on a cold October night, please DON"T MAKE THIS. It was a waste of ingredients and time, and now we have to go to the store to get cookies.

If you are looking for a soft melt in your mouth sugar cookie this is NOT it. If you are looking or something with the texture of a rubbery pancake with a little flavor you have you match. I have never thrown away a batch of dough after the first two sheets, but this wasn't worth scraping of the pan. Sorry.

I still make this recipe as my hubby and I love this recipe so much as do friends  that I give this to when I share the cookies with.  they cannot believe how soft they stay in the container and how soft they are to begin with.  Plus i even sprinkle them with sugar before i bake.  plus if you make these christmas just sprinkle before you bake with color sugar, what a holiday feel.

My 9 year old daughter made these and they turned out great.  I halved the recipe because I didn't need that many cookies!  Besides that the only change we made was to sprinkle cinnamon sugar over the cookies before we baked them.  A powdered sugar glaze might be good over them as well once cooled....

Being from York/Lancaster Co PA I am familiar with this "cookie" We always refered to them as "sugar cookies or sugar cakes". They are more like a cake but then again we make little devils food cakes the same size slap 2 togehter with frosting in the middle and call them "Whoopie pies".  Chicken pot pie is Chicken with noodles and potatoes in a pot. Chicken pie to us is a chicken and vegetables baked in a a pie crust.  Its a regional thing I guess. This is a good recipe true to my families traditions and we've been here over 300 years in PA Amish country.

I am a 13 year old who made these cookies with my 10 year old brother and 8 year old sister. They loved making them and eating them! Sprinkles go great, and the buttermilk can be substituted with milk. Nice and soft, and good! They taste like soft vanilla wafers.

I thought that the nay-sayers were just being mean, but these cookies are indeed strange.  I followed the recipe, but I certainly didn't get anything that I could pour.  I got an oily, soft dough, which I spooned up and patted into rounds.  They baked in about 8 minutes, but they never spread, even a bit, and they didn't puff.  I can't say that they're awful, but they certainly aren't tasty, either.  They're bland.  Very bland.

This recipe is actually GREAT! You just need to tweek the recipe a bit by cutting down on the oil and inceasing the vanilla. Only use 1 cup of oil and increase vanilla to 1 Tablespoon which adds flavor. This will make the dough thicker and more like a cookie!!

I will not be using this recipe again. After 10 minutes in the oven, they were still white.  Once they were finally done, I tried one, and it tasted more like bread than a cookie.  They did not get "big and soft" at all.

My husband always wants me to make sugar cake cookies, so i looked it up and made these. They are really good! I gave it a 4 start because he said i had to put a lot of sprinkle sugar on top because they werent sweet enough. So half way through i added  more sugar to the mix, they flatend out a little more but are SOOOOOOO yummy now! perfect taste and still fluffy soft sugar cookies!

So, in light of users saying this recipe was bland, I substituted 1/2 cup white sugar for dark brown sugar and two cups of the all-purpose flour for whole wheat flour. In the last half of the batter, I added some oats. They turned out quite delicious. The batter didn't seem to oily or too thin. It was similiar to a thicker cake batter. They didn't puff up, perhaps because of the difference in ingredients. But they weren't bland. They aren't my favorite, so if I make this again, I might add the oats again and make it into a cake.

These are light and airy and seem to dissolve in your mouth.  I think they need a glaze or icing because they are a little dry otherwise.  With a simple glaze made of 1 T melted butter, 3 T milk, 1.5 C powdered sugar, 0.25 t vanilla, and a pinch of salt, it is a breeze to drizzle and make these cookies beautiful.  These are the easiest and most delicious sugar cookies ever.  I love easy to handle batter rather than a thick dough.

These are a far cry out from cookies and distinctly resemble strange cookie flavored pancakes!! Almost identicle to the 'Amish Sugar Cake' recipe with more flour. You should never put this much liquid into a cookie dough, it makes batter! These oven baked 'pancakes' do taste good but they flatten out into large puddles. We had to take the 'batter' and spread it into a well greased and floured 9x13 pan and baked it. Sorry, this recipe is a big two thumbs down.

I can't believe anyone wouldn't like this cookie! It's delicious. I'm just in shock at the bad comments. I make it every year for christmas and add red and green sugar on top for a little cheer. Delicious.

This cookie is very blah. The amount of oil is shocking and unfortunately, the cookie tasted more like vegetable oil than anything else. They did get big and puffy though. Perhaps it would be improved with some kind of icing, but I think I'd rather stick with a regular sugar cookie.

This cookie was delicious and easy to make.  But I was disappointed in the way it looked.  I wanted to give them away and they looked very ordinary.  I liked them better when I made them larger.  I used a soup spoon and pushed them off with another soup spoon.  There is no way I could have poured them.  I used extra light olive oil.  Thanks for the chance to try it Heather.

These cookies turned out more like cake texture.  I omitted the cinnamon since it is the middle of summer and substituted lemon extract and vanilla.  They were yummy, but not the kind of sugar cookie I was looking for, thanks.

I know the recipe calls for a lot of oil, but it makes a cake like cookie that you can ice with frosting.  If you are looking for a sugar COOKIE then this isn't what you are looking for probably!  Our local Amish store makes these and they are so, so good.  Every time I make these, they are a hit.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This is the best and easy supper moist cookies I have ever had.  I made them for my kids and baseball team and they loved them. I also cut the oil to 1 cup and I used sour cream instead of butter milk and they turned out delicious. I would make this cookies over and over...
Thank you so much!

My 13 year old daughter made these and I think we overcooked them a little. But other then that they were pretty good.we made as the recipe reads, and next time might add a little vanilla or almond extract for a little more flavor. Overall not a bad cookie though.

Did not like this cookie. The excessive oil and then the buttermilk in this together gave  a most unpleasant after taste . Tasted kind of like vinegar and oil salad dressing. Good on lettuce, terrible in cookies.

Overall a good cookie. A touch on the bland side but for me these are perfect for flavouring. Add a little orange extract or lemon, top with a lovely boiled sugar icing. All in all an excellent recipe.

I have used this Recipie for the past three years in ALL of my Christmas Baskets. Everyone just raves how soft and cakey these cookies are and has asked for the recipie. These cookies are so simple my 10 year old uses the recipe himself for taking cookies to his school parties.

This is not the Amish sugar cookie recipe I was looking for. The one I was looking for does not use buttermilk. It uses powdered sugar as well as granulated sugar and it melts in your mouth.

This recipe was okay. But it was a little pancake like, and it looked very yellow for some odd reason.

i tend to overcook cookies so I never seem to get a nice, soft cookie when I bake.  I tried this recipe and was VERY pleased with it.  They baked up just right and have a nice, light taste.  I think I may try colored icing on them next time.

This was a very quick and neat looking recipe, but after trying it, I am very disappointed.  They really only taste like flour drops.  Maybe they need ground  nuts and cinnamon. I will probably not be trying this recipe again.

This is the best cookie I have had in a long time. I love sugar cookies, but I don't like them hard. I will repeat this recipe over and over! Just mailed it to my friends online. I used regular milk one time and it still turned out great! Thanks for listing,,,!

I thought they were very good and easy to make with my granddaughter Ava.   I did not have buttermilk so I used 1 teaspoon of vinegar with my milk.   Also made them by the tablespoon to make them larger.   I cut baking time to 8 minutes and used sprinkles before baking.  Makes at least 4 dozen.

Too much oil...oil separating from batter while first batch is baking. Oil leaking from cookie batter on cookie sheet prior to baking second batch. This was my first try to duplicate the taste of Amish Sugar Cakes. I see many more recipes but, the people at work ate them.

Wonderful recipe.  Reminds me of when I was a kid and made these at a friends.  I subtracted 1/2 cup oil and added sugar and almond extract.  Also added fun colors on top due to it being Christmas.

If you're looking for an old fashioned "tea cake", I think this will do the trick. They are not very sweet, but they are beautifully soft. I kept them simple, just sprinkled some sugar on top of each cookie before baking. It gives a little sparkle. I like them to bake the full ten minutes. I used parchment paper on the cookie sheet.

These are so good.  After they are cool, I make a little glaze of confectioners sugar and milk, spoon it on the cookies and then add red and green sprinkles to look more festive.

Awesome cookies, i was skeptical when making it, the batter is super oily, but they plump a lot, and taste great, i cut the recipe in half also. Next time i might add some more sugar, perhaps on top as well.

Easy and taste great!
