Excellent recipe...I do a similar dish without tomato sauce... Instead I use 1 package of cream cheese and 3 ozs. of fresh cream which I mix together and add to the pasta once the broccoli is cooked... Other than that the rest is the same recipe...Excellent taste!

Oh this was great! I probably used a little more bacon (I had some leftover that was already cooked/crumbled) and didn't measure the broccoli just used 2-3 heads. Didn't have linguinin so used fettucini and cooked the broccoli in the spaghetti sauce not the pasta water. Used a couple tablespoons butter to cook the onion/garlic since I had already cooked the bacon and added the garlic when the onion was almost done to avoid scorching.

I received this in my e-mail this morning and went to the store after work to get the ingredients. My husband and I loved this dish. It's super easy and it has terrific flavor. I added some red pepper flakes to the sauce per one suggestion below. It was delicious and I will definitely make this again.

This is a tasty dish! It's very good at the end of the week when you're tired and don't have a fridge full of ingredients lol. I made a few small changes. I took the advice of others and added my garlic after the onions had cooked. I also added frozen broccoli florets with the sauce instead of boiling it with the pasta. I also doubled the bacon. And added a dash of red pepper flakes. Came out delicious will be making it again.

I thought that was pretty good...I made it with turkey bacon though & the turkey bacon is a different texture than regular bacon so DH didn't care too much for it.

Love this recipe! I used farfalle (bowtie) pasta. The broccoli was cooked to perfection with the pasta. The taste of the bacon onions and spaghetti sauce was unbelievably delicious! I will definitely be making this again soon.

Really really good! There's just two things I would do differently next time: 1) Add 2 more slices bacon 2) Don't brown the garlic until the onion is almost tender as my garlic got a little overcooked as the grease was still so hot from the bacon. It was a nice fast meal and a good way to get my kids to eat some broccoli!

This was very good. The tomato sauce rather than a white sauce perhaps an alfredo seemed a little odd but we tried it anyway and all in the family liked it. I think with an alfredo it would be 5 stars - but that would be an entirely different recipe then wouldn't it?;o) Thank you to whoever shared this.

Added sundried tomatoes and a sundried tomato stir-through sauce instead of the spaghetti sauce. It deserves a star just for how pretty the pasta looks when you drain it with the broccoli.

We thought this was a solid 4 star recipe. I liked the taste of the broccoli with the sauce (I used Ragu chunky mushroom). I served with a salad and wheat rolls. Easy and tasty.

This was disappointing. Couldn't taste the broccoli or bacon and it tasted almost like spaghetti with spaghetti sauce. Won't bother to make again.

Delicious! So good I made it first with a red sauce (Ragu chunky mushroom) and then with a white sauce (Ragu alfredo). I took the advice of another All Recipes user and sauteed the onion and garlic in a small amount of the bacon grease then added the bacon and the sauce once the onions were soft. A couple of tips -- (1) Cut the amount of pasta down; only use 8-10 ounces of pasta instead of the 16 ounces called for in an 8-serving recipe. 1 jar of sauce can only cover 8-10 ounces of pasta reasonably. (2) Make certain the pasta is almost entirely cooked before adding the broccoli. I added my broccoli after 5 minutes as the recipe stated only to have my pasta take an extra long time to cook and consequently my broccoli turned to mush. (3) Feel free to add other vegetables as desired. I added green peas and mushrooms.

This recipe is one of my all time favourite pasta dishes made however with alfredo. I like to consider it the North American version of the Italian Carbonara. Though not the most healthy of suggestion I recommend using accumulating bacon fat to saut√© the garlic omit onions to enhance a two ingredient recipe. Substitue fresh ground black pepper instead of parmesan which will add nothing to an alfred sauce. Also remember not to drain bacon fat down your sink's drain as it will solidify as it cools. Instead collect it in a dish and wait a few hours until it becomes gelatenous (jelly). I like to add a paper towel into mine when it's still liquid to disperse it and make it easier to wipe out of the container into the garbage after. (not sure if you can compost hightly unlikely)

This was a very nice recipe but after reading some of the reviews that I would add some extra bacon to it. The aroma in the house was incredible after frying the bacon and then sauteeing the onion and garlic! I couldn't wait to eat dinner!

This was OK. Maybe it's just me though because I didn't think the bacon with spaghetti was a good combo. I did eat it though and my friend said it was OK. Like I said it might just be me. Thanks anyway.

Tasty recipe...bacon gives the sauce a nice flavor although next time I think I will use more bacon to bring out that flavor.

To me this was just ok. I used more bacon then called for but it still did not blow me away. Yes this is a quick and easy recipe but one that I do not believe I will be doing again.

As seems to be popular I'd say this recipe was "just ok". The broccolli and the bacon flavors really didn't stick out much at all. I feel like it's missing some kind of zest. I might experiement with it. At the very least however this is a decent meal to make when your fridge is getting empty.:P

I gave this recipe 4 stars because it is fairly easy to prepare and it tastes pretty good. There is nothing super special about it but I will probably make it again as it does add variety. I followed the recipe pretty exact but I think next time I will use less noodles or add more broccoli.

I used EXTRA (peppered) bacon. Wasn't crazy about the spaghetti sauce. I think this dish would taste much better with alfredo sauce. I think the dish screamed for some red pepper flakes. All in all it was pretty good. Just needs your "personal" touches.:-)

This was ok but there was definitely not enough bacon. I added a little bit of red pepper flakes to give it some oomph. Good for a quick weeknight meal-I always have these ingredients on hand.

Really liked this. I used half fresh and half thawed frozen broccoli. Next time I will use a sauce brand that I have tried and liked instead of something new. The bacon adds an interesting texture and taste.

My husband never complains but we both decided this was pretty blah. Maybe the alfredo version per other reviewers would be better. We won't try this again.

I monkeyed with the recipe a little bit using a whole pack of bacon (we LOVE bacon) added some fresh thyme and a splash or two of Cabernet to the sauce. The result was SO much better than your average "I forgot to defrost anything so I guess it's spaghetti again" dinner. Delicious!
