I have been making this recipe for many years now and it still remains my all time favorite! One thing I can't stress enough...you MUST use a GOOD quality feta. The kind you get in a grocery store just doesn't have enough flavor. I'm lucky enough to have a Greek deli nearby that offers excellent feta. I also double the amount of spinach and always add extra garlic and red pepper flakes.
If you'd like it a bit more hearty, try adding chicken tenderloins, cut up and sauteed.

OH MY GOODNESS!!!!!  This was such a delicious and easy recipe.  I only used half the feta b/c my husband doesn't really care for it, but without knowing what was in it, he agreed it was was good so next time I will use the whole amount of feta.  I also used extra spinach and next time will use a little more.  I literally threw this together in no time and then added some medium shrimp during the last few minutes.  LOVED, LOVED, LOVED THIS MEAL!!!

I am newly married & just learning to cook. I'm always on the lookout for things that are relatively easy and taste great, too.  This recipe definitely fit the bill!  My husband loved it and the leftovers were even better the next day.  I only had 4 oz of feta, but I added 4 oz of mozzarella and it was outstanding.  Also added an entire bag of baby spinach, as it does cook down a lot.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

This recipe surprised me. I really liked it.  I'm not a fan of tomatoes, so I wasn't sure.  The feta mixed in so nicely with everything to create a light and creamy sauce with a great flavor. And despite the amount of tomatoes, they didn't overpower the flavor at all.  I highly recommend this one.

The recipe was good but cooked tomatoes get so mushy. Instead I sauteed the onions/garlic/mushrooms and left the spinach/tomatoes/feta uncooked and mixed them in afterwards. Turned out very good and was really fresh tasting because of the uncooked portion. The spinach became tender from the residual heat but wasn't mush and the tomatoes kept their firmness but still released their juices. All in all it was very good. Would make it again for sure.

this is a real keeper!  thank you, suki.  i liked all of the ingredients, so i figured i would like the finished product, but had no idea just how good and easy this dish would be.  the melting feta makes it.  i am not a stickler for measuring...and changed the amounts of the ingredients (more spinach and more garlic) and it was fabulous.  i listened to the advice of another reviewer and made it again the other night as a main dish by adding chicken sausage.  my husband loved it.

Fantastic recipe and really easy to do!  This is now one of our favorites and I make it regularly, at least once every two weeks.  Great with crusty bread to sop up the juices and feta. Yum!!

Very tasty...the first time I made it I added shrimp...was awesome. The second time I made it, I didn't add the shrimp but added artichokes instead. Both times were very good, but it was better with the shrimp. I also used 4 cups of spinach because we love it and it cooks down alot. Also, the first time I used canned tomatoes and we thought that tasted better than it did the second time when I used fresh.

Oh my dear LORD was this good!!!  I had to stop my husband from licking the pan clean and thought I was going to have to wrestle him to the ground so he would save me some for leftovers to bring to work today!  I got this recipe e-mailed to me yesterday as the vegetarian option of the Daily Dish.  I IMMEDIATELY called my husband and asked him to pick up the feta since I had everything else to make this.  I had half a jar of sun dried tomatoes which I used instead of the fresh, and also used two small cans of mushrooms instead of the fresh.  ALSO, I used an entire bag of baby spinach (based on the comments of other readers), whole wheat rotini pasta and a full 10 oz. of feta.  It was TO DIE FOR, restaurant-quality, good.  The feta melts at the end and creates it's own creaminess which feels like you're cheating on your diet.  The only thing I will change is adding more garlic next time (I love garlic!) and maybe adding some chicken as extra protein.  My husband has requested I throw this into heavy rotation as a dinner and I have no problem doing so since it comes together so fast!

My minor modifications: * I used 2 cloves of garlic * I used sliced baby portobello mushrooms * added more red pepper flakes  * I used 4 oz. of feta and 4oz. of this 6 cheese Italian blend that I already had which included mozzarella, smoked provolone, asiago, parmesan, romano & fontina cheeses * When I cooked mine, I made sure that the mushrooms cooked down some before adding the pasta. I like mushrooms, but cooked.   Delicious dish!  Best pasta I've had in a long while and easy to prepare.

I am so in LOVE with this pasta! I have made it several times....so YUMMY! The feta MAKES this dish!  Even though I love feta, my husband hates it.  So this is what i do: I use a 16oz pkg of penne, 3 tbs olive oil, a whole red onion, 2 cloves garlic, 4 cups chopped tomatoes, an 8oz pkg of mushrooms, a whole bag of spinach.  I prepare just as directions say, except when it comes time to add the feta....I take out half of the pasta.  His part gets mozzarella and mine gets the FETA! Easy! And we are both happy :)

I really enjoyed this! I was worried that it might be bland, but the feta really pulls it together and gives it something special.  It's healthy, simple and I will definitely keep it in rotation. I used a can of drained diced tomatoes in place of fresh and will definitely do that again.

This was the BEST. My kids asked if they can have this every night for dinner.  As the others did, I doubled the spinach and I also added 4x the garlic.  I threw in some sun dried tomatoes too.  It looks terrific and tastes terrific too.  My younger daughter says it tastes better than "the whole entire world".  It's a winner.

Excellent! To spice it up even more, I added 1 chopped zuchinni, 1 handful of pine nuts and 1/2 cup of sun dried tomatos.  Thanks!

made this for an italian potluck (while not italian, very remniscent of the style- not too saucy, with fresh veggies being the feature of the dish)and not a single bite was left!  no issues of blandness here- increased the garlic to 4 cloves, increased the onions to 3/4 C, used cherry tomatoes (which offer the perfect amount of sweetness to the dish), and a dash of toasted pine nuts and kalamata olives.  used only 6 oz of basil and tomato feta and a generous dash of red pepper!  fantastico!

I needed an easy but attractive dinner for 15 people, and this dish was a hit! (My 22-month-old granddaughter ate as much as some of the men!) I premeasured everything into large bowls so that at cooking time, all I had to do was dump in ingredients. (If you double the recipe, make sure to use two large skillets instead of one.) I'm glad I took others' suggestion and doubled the spinach and increased the mushrooms. Delicious with a big salad and herbed rosemary bread. This will become one of my go-to meals for both company and everyday. Thanks, Suki!

Very flavorful. My husband and I both loved it. I used canned diced tomatoes (italian herb flavor) instead of fresh which worked very well. I'll definately make this one again.

I love a recipe that's straight to the point! That is, not a whole basket of ingredients and seasonings. It is what it is, and it's delicious. -I didn't have enough feta, so I added some diced up avocado to not miss out on a nice creamy texture, and always a spritz of lemon at the end for me to finish things up!

It was delicious, but I think it need a little something to tie all the flavors together, perhaps some sort of oil/vinegar dressing? I also added extra spinach simply because it's such a good and nutritious filler.  Next time, I'll probably add some sundried tomatoes and perhaps broil some hearty portabella caps to put on top.

This was really good.  Did not have ripe fresh tomatoes so I used unsalted diced from the can.  Added more garlic and more red pepper because we like it spicy spicy!

Yuck. This did not work at all. I don’t know what went wrong, but 
it tasted just awful. Perhaps I used the wrong kind of mushrooms —
I think if you cut them out of the recipe,it might be okay, but I wasn’t
big on the melted feta — would add that as a topping, to keep its crumbly 
consistency instead.

I really liked this recipe.  The one change I would make the next time is to fry the mushrooms with
 the garlic and onions.  When you add mushrooms to tomatoes and spinach, they don't get that golden brown look.  I also added more garlic and more pepper flakes.

This is a good base recipe, but I wish I had listened to the other reviewers about using good feta. I tried to be healthy and use fat-free feta, and I think it REALLY affects the taste. No matter how much red pepper and salt/pepper I added, I just felt like something was missing. Next time, I'll make sure to use a full-flavored, full-fat Greek feta; I think that will help give it more flavor.

Also, I more than doubled the amount of spinach (6cups) and still felt like I could have used more. I forgot how quickly spinach leaves shrivel up when cooked. I could probably bump it up to 8 cups next time - more spinach is always a good thing!

Edit:
- Measured 16 oz of uncooked pasta and it made an entire saucepan full
- Used 8 cups of spinach and thought it was just the right amount
- Used 4 cups of tomatoes
**I think what was crucial in giving it extra flavor this time was using a full-fat, "Crumbled Feta with Mediterranean Herbs" from Trader Joe's. The pasta was a lot more flavorful this time.

I used some green and red onions and roma tomatoes, went ahead and added a can of diced tomatoes also, since it didn't seem like enough at that point, which made a nice sauce with juices from the can, so glad I did. Also a bit more of the mushrooms and fresh basil. I did add the whole ten oz. bag of spinach and glad I did, it really condensed quickly. At this point my gut said to just add pasta and top with feta, but I added the feta and cooked it into the mixture as the recipe calls for. It made the spinach clump in together into gobs. I will make it again but will just top it with feta and not cook it into the pasta. My husband still loved it, but also agreed to top with the cheese and not add it into and cook it.
Update: Made without mixing the Feta in and liked it much better. Unfortunately didn't have Feta, like I thought I did, so topped with grated Parmesan.

I was a bit dubious at first because the combination of spinach, mushrooms, tomato and feta sounded a little odd to me but this recipe turned out very well.  My boyfriend loved it.  The only change I'd make would be to use a little less feta next time - like about six oz. instead of eight.  Very quick and easy.

I think this dish is delicious!  Very FRESH tasting!!  For those who don't like a lot of spices, the red pepper could be left out.  For those who like more spiciness, add more red pepper, or any other spice that you like, more garlic, basil, oregano, parsley.... whatever your taste buds prefer.  Please don't give low stars to a recipe because it's not spicy enough for you when you know your own preferences - if you prefer spicier food then 1 pinch of red pepper certainly wouldn't be enough for you. And don't rate it when you change the ingredients either.  Rate it only if you make it as it's written.  It really bothers me when people do that! I made it as it's written, tasted it and rated it - I give this recipe 5 stars! It's simple, fresh tasting restaurant quality, and healthy for you. I truly enjoyed it and am looking forward to leftovers tomorrow (and there's a lot - my family wouldn't eat any.  They don't like it when I make "new" things- oh well...... more for me!!) Next time I make it I may tweak it by adding zucchini, and/or grilled chicken or shrimp. As is it's yummy. Being able to "customize" it by adding different ingredients just shows that it's a versatile recipe also. Thank you Suki for posting it!!

Wanted a pasta dish without a tomatoe sauce. Found this recipe and couldn't be happier about finding this new  recipe that will be a favorite for my family.  I used a lb box of penne so doubled the recipe. However, only used 4 oz of feta and thought  that was plenty. A delicious and healthy alternative to standard pasta and sauce.!  Hope you enjoy it as much as  my family did!

Awesome recipe as is, but my tips:  Overcook the onion--let it start to brown.  Double or triple the garlic.  Forget the mushrooms and use artichoke hearts instead.

Oh. My. Gosh. This is amazing.  I didn't have any mushroom on hand so I left those out, and it's still one of the best pastas I've had. I would order this in a restaurant, and it's so easy to make!  I love spicy food so I went crazy with the red pepper flakes, and I'm so glad I did!

Mmmm!  Perfect for Meatless Mondays!  Add more fresh spinach.  And, make sure you get a good quality feta.  It's worth it!  Threw in a few kalamata olives too!  Would be great with some grilled chicken or shrimp thrown in too!  Kids loved it!

Needed way more garlic as well as some salt. Even after these additions it still seemed to be lacking in flavor. :/ Will not be making again.

I kept the sauce and the pasta separate and let my guests spoon each on their plates.  I don't recommend letting feta cheese heat at all - it changes the flavor and has a weird smell.

FIVE STAR - hubby would've given it ten!  Very easy, uses ingredients I have on hand, smells great on the stove and and tastes even better!  Definitely one for my regular rotation - nice enough for company too!  Leftovers the next day heated up nicely and tasted just as good!

12/4 - made this a second time for friends, added in some chopped artichokes as well - yum!  5 stars!

This was delicious.  You know how reviewers say a recipe was restaurant quality?  Well, this one was.  I'd make it for company.  The combination of the spinach, tomatoes & feta results in a creamy, orangy colored sauce.  Anyway, I combined the instructions/ingredients for "mostaccioli with spinach and feta" which is almost the same recipe.  I used a 6 oz. bag of baby spinach which I washed & chopped.  This time, I left out the onions & mushrooms & put the red pepper flakes on the table as I thought my husband would like a milder taste.  I cooked the garlic first, just for a little while, but not to brown it.  I used whole wheat penne.  I also added some defrosted frozen shrimp (1/2 a pound) to heat for a little while, before adding the pasta & feta.  I kept stirring the pasta & feta till the feta pretty much dissolved & it had a creamy texture.  My husband thought the feta should be decreased a bit (although I loved it) so I may use 3/4 of a cup next time.

This is an excellent pasta recipe. I baked what I had left over the next day with melted cheese and it tasted even better! I have even made it with whole wheat pasta and it compliments the whole grain flavor very nicely!

I boiled the entire box of Penne and added it to the pan at the end until I thought there was enough ( I ended up using more than the 8 ounces this called for. I’d guess about 13 or 14oz). I used an entire onion, 2 minced garlic cloves, I chopped up 4 plum tomatoes,  a whole container of mushrooms and a entire bag of spinach. I skipped the red pepper flakes and used an entire container of feta.

This was a decent meal. Instead of fresh tomatoes I used a can of diced and chopped them because we don't really like chunky tomatoes. I added a little bit of parsley and rosemary which gave the dish a little more flavor. The feta was definitely different...not bad, just different. I actually think I might like this better as a cold pasta salad rather than a hot pasta dish.

Just a few things to add to this wonderful recipe.  Add a handful of fresh basil.  Fresh pasta (refrigerated section) makes this dish.  Artichoke hearts make a great substitute for fresh mushroom.  I usually use shallots for this instead of onions.  Triple the garlic.  Canned tomatoes (no salt added) can be successfully substituted for fresh in  the absence of good tomatos in the produce dept.   I wholeheartedly agree with the reviewers who add different cheeses (italian blend, fresh grated parm).  I usually don't add as much feta as it calls for just to keep it a little healthier.  Do find good feta cheese.  Also find good parm.  It's worth the effort and expense.

Great recipe, very quick to toss together too. I left out the mushrooms ( husband is not a fan..) used thin spaghetti noodles (all I had on hand..) and added a sprinkle of italian seasonings, otherwise made just as written. Will definitely make again.

My daughters and I needed a quick meatless recipe so we tried this one out.  I put a bit too much red pepper for their taste but overall we were all pleasantly surprised.  The flavor was better than I expected.  We used Barilla's penne Ultra because it is whole wheat and has extra protein which is good for vegetarians.  If you cook this, add more spinach then you think you need - it will cook down and you will wish you had more. In future I will add more onions and garlic, and use less tomato.

Very flavorful easy recipe. I used whole wheat linguine, canned diced tomatoes (didn't have enough fresh ones), and more spinach than the recipe called for. I put 3 cups in initially and then put another handful right before serving.  Next time I will wait until the very end to put the feta in so it doesn't melt as much. Didn't have red pepper flakes but was still great without it. Definitely making this again.

This was very good. I used thin spaghetti.  Added a squeeze of lemon juice and a little basil.  Agree with the tip to use high quality feta.  No "sauce" needed

This was great -- the opposite of bland! I only used 4 oz of feta (to cut back on the fat), fire-roasted diced canned tomatoes, and a full bag of baby spinach. I also added fresh basil. My boyfriend and I used about half the recipe and I'm just eating the leftover sauce over noodles now. It's almost better reheated!

Both my boyfriend and I really enjoyed this  dish. I didnt have the red pepper flakes and used oragano (i wish i had fresh basil on hand) but it still tasted very nice. I added extra spinach as others had and next time i think i will add more tomato and garlic. A great recipe that with a few revisions just might be one of my favorites! Creamy,healthy and so easy to make!

I am rating this 4/5 because the presentation on this dish is not the greatest. It ends up looking mushy with the melted feta. BUT, nevertheless, it TASTES GREAT! I threw in some chopped cooked spicy italian sausage at the end.. MMM

This was such a delicious and impressive dish -- especially b/c it is so easy to make! I agree with other reviewers that it was a bit liquidy but it didn't detract from the taste. I will definitely be making it again.

So good!  Easy and quick.  Great way to get some fresh greens into your diet.  I also threw some kalamata olives in that I wanted to use up, and so we'd have more sauce, I used a can of chicken broth and some white wine for extra liquid.  Thank you Suki!

This is a really tasty recipe! I put more garlic and red pepper flakes to cater more to my personal tastes. I also added some dried basil and a pinch of oregano. I cut the oil in half to make it a little healthier and it was plenty to cook with. I'll definately be making this often!!!

Great recipe! I used canned tomatoes and spinach instead of fresh and more feta and garlic than indicated in the recipe. I fried mushrooms before adding tomatoes and spinach. Also tried without mushrooms - still tastes good. Next day I baked the leftovers in the oven and added some feta on the top. It became nice and crispy. Thanks, Suki.

I was reluctant to try this because I wasn't sure my wife would like the feta cheese. It was wonderful, something we'll make for company. 

All the textures and flavors were a delight.

This recipe is a keeper!  It is very tasty and simple to make.  Since tomatoes are out of season right now, I used 2- 14 1/2 oz cans of diced tomatoes seasoned with garlic and onion. and then drained them.  I also used tomato and basil Feta cheese.  I will definitely make this one again!

This recipe was great.  I made one substitution because I did not have mushrooms.  I used eggplant instead.  Let me tell you, it turned out awesome.  My three year old even ate it! Contrary to the other ratings regaring too much feta...I might add some more next time.  Oh...I also added some fresh basil and my feta was flavored with tomato and basil.
Thanks

I have been making this recipe for years!   I just happened upon it today so I'll leave a rating. I will add roasted red peppers and marinated artichoke hearts sometimes also. However,  when I add my spinach,  I do it this way because otherwise it just turns into a shriveled mass of spinach ~ everything goes into the pasta pot,  I toss it around good. The baby spinach then gets tossed in and filled in, and cover. The heat from the other items is enough to Wilt the spinach just enough and it stays in separated leaves.

This was delicious, Suki! I used 1 lb. of mini penne, a pkg of sliced baby bella mushrooms, about 8 c. baby spinach and a little over a pint of halved grape tomatoes. I kept the feta at 8 oz but upped the red pepper flakes to probably 1/2 tsp and used at least 2 TBSP minced garlic since I made the full pound of pasta. This is one of those recipes that is easily adaptable to whatever you have on hand and to your personal preferences. Thank you for sharing!

This was easy and DELICIOUS! I used thick spaghetti and cherry tomatoes cut in half. Other than that, I stuck to the recipe. Oh, I also added a few tablespoons of pasta water to sauce so it would coat the pasta a little better. Mmmmmm

Just had this for the first time tonight! It was super easy to make, and I'm already wanted to make it again! It's easily one of the best meals I've ever had. The only thing I did not do was cook until al dente. I prefer it a bit softer!

Added about a 1/4 cup cream and 1/4 cup chopped sundried tomatoes along with the pasta and feta. Next time, use more spinach and reserve some feta to garnish before serving (my feta melted which was delicious but it would be nice to have pieces of feta in there as well). I served with shrimp roasted in olive oil at 400F for 5-7 minutes. Very good and super fast & easy!!!

This was very good.  I did add some sliced hot Italian sausage and I used Cheyenne pepper instead of the red pepper flakes but those are the only changes I made to the recipe.  I will definitely be making this again for a quick dinner idea.

Excellent! I used 1 can of diced tomatoes instead of the fresh and 16 oz frozen spinach thawed and drained. Also substituted linguini for penne pasta!!

This was easy and delicious, and a very, very tasty way to use up some leftover feta and spinach.

Seems too easy to be that good. I did add 6 cloves of garlic and it was not too much for us (they were small  though) I will never eat pasta sauce from a can again.

Really, really nice.  I added in some chicken which I forgot to keep an eye on in the pan and totally overcooked!  lol  But the pasta itself was very good and had really complex flavors.  I might just add a little bit of butter to the pasta next time but thats about it.  Thanks!!

I added a bit of shredded mozzarella I had in my fridge, cut way down on the onion, and probably added only about half the tomatoes, and some fresh basil to the end result.
I omitted the red pepper flakes because I didn't have any and I didn't miss them at all.
I will definitely make it again, it was delicious!

So so so good. Didn't change a thing and it was absolutely perfect and much healthier than loading on the alfredo or spaghetti sauce! This would even be good with chicken or shrimp added, but is AMAZING just as the recipe states.

I am usually pretty wary of pasta that has no sauce with it, as it is usually dull and bland.  I thought this would be the same, but feta and spinach sounded so good I couldn't resist the urge to try it.  The juice from the tomatoes and the feta mix with the oil and sort of provides a "sauce", so this was actually very tasty!  I made a few changes though to accomodate what I had in my pantry.  My husband is a meat-eater, so I made this with chicken.  I just put sliced chicken pieces in with the onion and garlic and sauteed for about 4 minutes or so.  I used canned tomatoes and I did not use mushrooms because I had none.  I cooked the noodles in chicken broth.  I forgot to put in the red pepper until after I had already made the entire dish.  I think it was better without the it.

Great recipe!! I change things (of course) according to what I like and have on hand. This time I used vegetable pasta, a lot more garlic (3 cloves), onion (1 C), tomato, mushrooms and spinach (about doubled each). I also added some hot Italian sausage (browned in the garlic and onion) and Italian seasoning/garlic salt at the end. Great recipe!!

Cooked mushrooms with onion and garlic.  Added tomatoes with spinach later.  Used more spinach than called for.  Served with Chianti but could also go with Pinot Gris or Retsina.

I just made this and while it was good enough, it was quite bland and I used 3 cloves of garlic. I just kept feeling like it needed something to bring up the flavor.

Simple to make and tasty. I used sun-dried tomatoes (not in oil), added some kalamata olives and sausage for my husband's serving. Also added in some fresh basil when I added the cheese. We're full :-)

This recipe was amazing!!  Almost everything it called for I had on hand and it was so simple to prepare.  Had the husband and kids raving.  You definitely want to add more spinach, next time I will probably double the amount.  I also added sauted shrimp.  This was one of the best and easiest dinners I've had in a while.

We has some things in the fridge we needed to use up..fresh spinach, boiled shrimp and some tomatoes, so I found & made this. Only thing I did different was, after reading other reviews, we used 4 oz of the feta and 4 oz of the mazzarella cheese (combined) & added the shrimp.  My husband, a picky eater, gave this an A+.  I loved it too.  Easy and great taste. There are so many ways you can twick this recipe to suit your own taste.  I will be using this again.

This is excellent!  I made it as written but used a bag of baby spinach instead of 2 cups.  I would even use more next time.  I also marinated chicken tenders in Greek dressing, broiled them and cut into chunks and added to the pasta.  I will be making this again and again.

Fantastic pasta!  I used 3 roma tomatoes and 3 smaller ones from a friend's garden (less than called for), more than a cup of chopped mushrooms, lots of fresh baby spinach, very little onion and plenty of fresh (homegrown) garlic, plus macaroni elbows instead of penne (because I accidentally overcooked the penne -- drats).  I cut up two grilled chicken breasts and added the chunks to the olive oil (used more of that too) in the pan before the veggies.  Then I finished it with 6 oz. of feta and an ounce or two of shredded mozzarella.  Very, very good recipe!

This was very fresh tasting but slightly bland.  Next time I would add more crushed red pepper and some fresh basil.

This dish is FANTASTIC!!!!!!!  So easy and delicious, can't ask for more.  Did add 2 extra cups of spinach as suggested by some other reviewers.  Will be making this weekly.  Highly recommend this.

This was superb!  Only thing I did differently was to add more garlic, onion, and spinach!  Oh, I did squeeze some lemon juice at the end.  I will make this one again and again.  Thank you!

Fast, easy, and had the ingredients on hand. This was a real delicious meal - loved how the pasta base mingles with the salty of the feta and the sharp of the red pepper (I didn't heat the cheese or pasta with the veggies b/c I made both regular and gluten free pasta to go with this). Definitely a keeper!

This was my first time putting feta in a pasta and I was very pleased with the results. The cheese gets all melty and soft, it totally makes up for the fact that this dish doesn't have much of a sauce. I especially like this recipe because you can add a lot of fresh veggies to it. I think next time I'll add in some zucchini. One thing I think is important when making this dish is to wait to put the tomatoes in. I only mix mine in with the other vegetables about two minutes before I mix in the cooked pasta. That way the tomatoes can heat through but stay plump and juicy.

I was really impressed with how well this turned out.  I love the fact that it is all natural ingredients as opposed to the canned sauces, with all their preservatives that I usually buy.  I added extra spinach, but I could have added more... next time.

Great pasta. It was quick and easy and a nice change from your regular jar sauce. The whole family liked it. I am not a fan of mushrooms so I left those out and added about 1/2 cup of ricotta cheese and garlic and onion powder, oregano, parsley and italian seasoning. This dish is a keeper.

This is a definite make-again recipe.  I added 1-inch cubes of chicken breast, which I sauteed beforehand.  I would definitely use more spinach than the recipe calls for, as it adds beautiful color and taste.  The feta is delicious and still tastes great the next day.

WOW!  This is an amazing way to make pasta.  It was appealing to me because we had everything in the house besides tomatoes and mushrooms.  Loved that it was creamy without any traditional sauce.  Very Unique and delicious!    Made a couple small modifications:  1) Added more spinach.  I read the reviews, and was just going to do it by the book the first time, but after just seeing it wilt, I knew I should double the amount.  After eating, I think it could still have a little more without being dominant. 2)I had seasoned feta in the house, so that's what I used.  I combined two packages, one being Mediterranean Herb, and the other being tomato basil.  I think the seasoned feta made a lovely contribution, and I'm not sure it would have tasted so good if I would have used plain.  *Both people I shared a meal with said this is the best pasta they've ever had.  ...and they eat a lotta pasta.*

I've made this twice, and it has truly become one of my favorite recipes!  I eat way too much of this when I make it!  I use frozen tomatoes from my freezer, and don't use the full amount of feta cheese...I sprinkle it on top at the end, varying the amount according to each person in the family.  I think you could definitely add more spinach to this.  I also don't add any red pepper flakes, as I don't like spicy food. Fantastic recipe - definitely a keeper!!

This was really really really good.  I know I'm not supposed to do this, but I did add a few things so I have to rate the version I ate, but that's not to say the original recipe wouldn't be excellent.  I subbed green onions and also threw in artichoke hearts and shrimp with the veggies, then after it all cooked down, I hit it with a splash of white wine before I added the pasta and feta.  I didn't pay much attention to measurements and may have been heavy-handed with the red pepper flakes because it was spicy!  BUT SO DELISH.  Perfect with a crusty whole wheat baguette and steamed asparagus on the side!  The only suggestions I'd make would be to throw in more spinach since it cooks waaaaaay down and maybe leave the salt out since you're adding feta anyway.  I did.  LOVE this!  I would give more stars if I could!

What a great recipe!  I loved it. My son loved it.  I did follow some of the suggestions and added more garlic and spinach.  I also used tomato and basil feta cheese.  Might try adding some shrimp amd/or pine nuts next time.  Thanks Suki!

Made 1/2 the pasta for 2 with total amount of the remaining ingredients.  Added some raw shrimp at the end.  This is absolutely delicious.  I did add quite a bit less olive oil to keep it a bit lower in calories.  Will make again soon.

I would suggest deglazing the pan with a little white wine(Chard.)  after adding spinach and spices.   Adds great flavor.

Delicious!  I only used 1 T olive oil to cut back the fat a little.  I used 10 oz spinach, 2 cans of drained diced tomatoes, and portabella mushrooms.  I also used reduced fat feta, and instead of mixing it in, sprinkled it on top to taste in the individual bowls (also to save fat/Calories).. Used Barilla Plus Penne Pasta

Oh so wonderful!

Delicious!! I have also used variations by adding zucchini and salami and then serving with parmesan cheese. I combatted the watery texture, by mixing some corn flour in water and then adding to the spinach/feta pasta, thus it became more saucey.

I found this delightful.  Very light without all that meat in it.  the only thing I changed, was that I seede the tomatoes which also decreased the liquidity.  It was marvelous.

This was pretty good.  I doubled the mushroom, onion, and garlic amounts, and I wish I'd doubled the spinach and feta amounts as well.  The taste was good...I just like more of a "stuff" to pasta ratio.  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved it.  I have made it numerous times over the last year.  Yes, use more spinach, use fresh tomatoes, use extra garlic, and I even use extra Feta for that extra salty and tangy zip.  My kids love it, except for the ultimately picky 6-year-old.  I pull this recipe out when cooking for vegetarian friends/family members.

I really don't remember when i first made this recipe.  But, I just found it hidden in an old cookbook.  I am making it tonight again with the hopes that it is as good as I remember.  I do remember that since my hubby does not like tomatoes, I use grape tomatoes and cut each one in half.  This gives the sauce the bit of tomato but they are still in large chunks.  I also use mini penne pasta for a more bite sized dish.  
This is great with some grilled chicken that has been marinated in Italian salad dressing for a full meal.

This was awesome, but I made significant mods. I doubled the onion, garlic, and spinach. I used 1/2 feta and 1/2 parmesan, and also added more pepper flakes and a bit of Italian seasoning. And some black olives. This tastes so great! And freash and healthy too!

WOW!  I am not a spinach lover but next time I would add the whole bag of fresh baby spinach instead of 2 cups.  I used 2 large cans of chopped tomatoes, drained.  I also added 1 1/2 cups shredded parmesan cheese when I added the Feta.  My husband hates mushrooms, so I changed to sliced black olives and added them with the cheeses.    Soooooo good!

Wonderful! I would give it more stars if I had the option!! I added Italian turkey sausage for my meat-loving boyfriend, which ended up giving it a really great added flavor for a lot less fat than regular Italian sausage. I also used two cans of diced tomatoes with basil, oregano and garlic seasoning in place of the tomatoes to make prep time go a little quicker. Overall an excellent and filling meal . . . I'm sending it to a friend right away! Thanks, Suki!!!

This is a great meatless recipe. I would say it may not be the most kid friendly but that's ok. My two cents: more garlic (at least another clove) and don't skimp  on the mushrooms and spinach, I did and I wish I had been more brave. Also, I used canned tomatoes but in the future I would buy the lowest in sodium or go with the fresh as it made it a bit salty. This recipe was terrifec and I will be sure to add it to my regular rotation...would be great for company also!!

I admit that I make changes to suit what I have on hand but this is a great base.  I usually double the spinach and add whatever veggies I have - red, yellow, orange peppers.  Grape tomates are perfect for this, use at least 1 pint.  Kids are not mushroom fans so usually leave those out. Just stirfy the veggies, shred the spinach and toss with the pasta.  I have used different pastas, but our favorite is using orzo, a pound of anything works well.  The warm feta is the best part - have used sheep, goat and cow.  The kids love it when I add leftover bruchetta in addition to the tomates.  Great as a cold lunch as well.  Thanks Suki.

Two words best describe this recipe - YUMMY & EASY.  When reading the ingredients, I thought it wouldn't be anything special, but I was completely wrong!  Great tasting and was a cinch to make.  I can't wait to make it again.

We have been using this recipe for over a year now and we all just love the combination of fresh flavors.  I will often add fresh Basil to add just a sprinkle of grated hard cheeses.

Pretty good basic recipe.  I added extra garlic and lots of red pepper flakes.  The spinach wilts WAY down, so I think you can add tons.  While I was eating it I was imagining adding other ingredients like pinenuts or a different cheese...so I guess it wasn't perfect for me, but lots of potential.

This dish is worthy of using for entertaining, and it is so cheap and easy to make!  We now have this meal about once a month, and make it in large portions so we can have lots of leftovers.

Wow!  This recipe is awesome!  We love feta cheese, so I added the whole 8 oz.  It seemed like a lot when I first added it, but as it melted into the rest of the ingredients it was perfect.  Two of us had this for dinner, and there certainly wasn't much left over for lunch the next day.

This is a very good and healthy dish. My husband, who is traditionally a meat lover, really likes this recipe. The spinach cooks down quite a bit; next time I will probably add more and also some more mushrooms. It's very colorful and tasty. Other reviewers thought the feta to be too much, but it's really the main flavor of the dish. Highly recommend if you love feta cheese.

This was a great recipe. My husband and I really enjoyed it. I did as people said and only mixed half of the feta in and kept the rest to sprinkle on the top of the dish. I also added a small amount of garlic salt and basil and it was wonderful. Will definitely make this again.

This recipe was FABULOUS! I read the review that said it was bland, so when I made it I added a little extra garlic and I also added some chopped artichokes. The dish had tons of flavor!

This pasta was amazing!  My roommate and I especially loved it because it was easy on our budget and lasted us a few days...it even tasted good cold out of the fridge!  We used a lot more spinach than was called for because it really cooked down.  Also, we used vegetable oil and couldn't tell any difference.  Suki rocks!!

This was okay.. I doubled the spinach as other reviewers suggested and I added more garlic ( I love garlic ), but I was disappointed. I think it really does matter what kind of feta you use. I used a light feta (to cut back calories) and I think that if I had indulged on a good quality feta that it would have tasted a lot better.

This was a homerun for my husband and I.  Instead of the 3 cups of chopped tomatoes, I used a 28oz can of diced tomatoes w/oregano, garlic, & basil.  Would absolutely do that again.  Also, I added some extra garlic and a whole bag of spinach.  Added some cooked Italian sausages that I cut up.  Fantastic!

This is a great and very versatile recipe. I made some changes: I added a teaspoon of balsamic while the mushrooms were cooking, quadrupled the amount of spinach and wish I had put more. Also added bell pepper and some kidney beans I needed to use. Came out great! The feta give everything a wonderful taste, and I didn't add salt because feta is already salty.

Very yummy, and very forgiving!  I don't think I used the correct amounts of anything, but it was still tasty.  I added chicken sausage.  Definitely do not omit that pinch of red pepper flakes!  Nice touch!  I might add a touch of fennel next time.

Excellent recipe and tips from reviewers. Thanks all. A favorite with revisions. Rather than cook garlic/onions on medium-high, I sweat the vegetables like I learned in a free Rouxbe cooking class, by turning the eye on low, putting in the oil, adding the onions and garlic, covering and cooking until they turn translucent -- not brown -- just soft. This releases a lot more flavor from the vegetables. Like others, I use sun dried tomatoes instead of fresh, half feta and half mozzarella, and I have yet to use too much spinach. I put 4-5 cups. We love it at our house!

This pasta was ok.  I was excited to try it because the combination of ingredients sounded delicious.  Unfortunately, it some ways it just missed the mark for me.  I definitely thought there would be more of a sauce with the pasta, but I didn't have any sauce at all.  Although I did eat it all, I doubt I will make this recipe again.

This was a super easy recipe. I used a whole onion, a package of sliced baby portobello mushrooms and a whole package of baby spinach to bulk up the veggie factor. Turned out awesome!

Don't know if this was just because of the brand I bought, but after melting the feta cheese became grainy and gave the pasta a very unappetizing texture.

I liked this recipe. Very easy, and tasted yummy. I did add more garlic like earlier comments suggested. I did add more mushrooms, and I used cremini, shiitake, and oyster mushrooms. I did run out of spinach, so I substituted it with kale.

I thought this tasted just really okay, but it used what I had in the house. My main issue was it was just rather dry. Although, I did like the use of all of the vegetables. Except the combination of flavors just didnt seem to meld well for me. I got more like 5-6 servings, so the calorie count is not too bad either. Just not a repeat dish due to the flavor and dry nature of the dish. I had to toss the leftovers as they never got eaten.

This recipe was absolutely lovely. 
Instead of using the normal tomatoes I used canned tomatoes, I don't like mushrooms so I had them without. I had spinach, and mixed the feta in with the ingredients. Wow. This was absolutely delicious. Will be making this again, I actually ended up eating the whole lot!

This was very good! I had to go back and saute some more spinach as it really cooked down, so don't skimp on the spinach. I only had feta with tomato and basil and that was a nice addition. A very nice dish I served with coleslaw and grilled chicken.

I liked this. It wasn't one of my favourites but it was very tasty. Based on some comments that it lacked flavor I added 3 additional cloves of garlic and a chile pepper instead of pepper flakes.

Very very good recipe!  I made it with blue cheese (even though I know it's not a substitute for feta), but I figured the ingredients would suit blue cheese just as much as they do feta, and I was right.  Very flavorful and delicious!  I sauteed the onions first, added the mushrooms, once those gave out some of their liquid, added the garlic, sauteed for another minute, added the spinach (handful, frozen) and tomatoes, then after a few minutes, melted a full 8 oz of blue cheese right into the sauce.  So good.  I truly recommend it, and it's very easy to make.  I will, of course, make it with feta too, but the blue cheese version is wonderful, for those who would like to try it.

Sounded amazing with the feta, but the mix of the melted feta with the red pepper flakes was awful. Next time I would leave the feta in chunks, and mix in right before serving and omit the red pepper flakes.

Very good.  I did add more garlic, crushed red pepper and spinach than was called for. I also added lemon after it was all mixed together because there's nothing better than lemon and feta!  Next time we're going to add some grilled or crusted chicken. It's a keeper.

I took the advice of others and used extra spinach. Also added Italian seasoning and approx. 2Tbsp finely chopped kalamata olives. Delish! Will make again.

I absolutely love this dish!  I added some roasted cashews to it because a local restaurant does that it a similar dish on their menu and I love it!  I used garlic-infused olive oil, also, which added a nice touch.  Great recipe to play around with, ingredient-wise, also.  Awesome quick dinner!

Delicious.  Even my kids liked it and asked me to put it into rotation...will adjust red pepper flakes accordingly...depending on my audience and the desired kick!  Loved how much flavor could be accomplished in an (almost) one skillet meal...

This is a very quick and easy recipe to put together on a weekday.  Follow the recipe exactly and it will turn out well. Only thing I added was basil and it was delicious.  I did not have fresh spinach on hand and used frozen, it worked just fine.

Fantastic recipe! Followed others advice and increased garlic, onion and used a combination of fresh, canned diced and grape tomatoes. My own personal modification was to use frozen five cheese ravioli in lieu of the penne pasta which made this an exceptionally tasty and filling vegetarian meal. My teenage son went back for four helpings. Yum!

I liked it a lot.  We had just come home from a long trip and wanted a light supper.  Unfortunately, my husband was late and the spinach was not just wilted... so next time, it will likely be a five-star rating.

Yum!!  What a bonus that this is quick and many of the ingredients come from the garden.  I didn't have enough spinach so I tossed in some arugula and cut down on the pepper.  I added more garlic and at the last minute a handful of basil.  We were out of penne so I made this with macaroni.  I can't wait until the tomatoes in the garden are ripe so that I can use them instead of the store bought.  I will be making this frequently.

Wonderful dish! I would definitely add more spinach garlic, and mushrooms, but everything else was just perfect. Quick, easy, and delicious!

Yummy!  We really like feta in this house.  It was a little too much feta for me, but just right for my hubby.

Really good recipe.  Easy to make and impressive to serve.  Just a few changes.. used minced roasted garlic (from the jar) and used 2 cloves.  Also added chicken during the onion/garlic cooking process to add some extra protein for the diabetic in the family.  I used canned petite diced tomatoes in their sauce (though next time I might only use 2 cups) because that's what I had on hand.  I also used only 6oz feta because the container I was only that amount.  But it was really a very tasty dish!  Especially with some fresh french bread to soak up the sauce at the end :-)

easy, healthy, good...a trifecta!  Now if it were only a bit cheaper.  I used a full (around 10 oz) bag of spinach and left out the red pepper flakes.

DELICIOUS! This was amazing. I left out mushrooms (due to tastes), used canned tomatoes (because that's all I had on hand), and added more spinach (because we love it, and it shrinks down so much). I would make this over and over, and I have already recommended it to my mom!

My family makes this one at least once a month, if not more.  It's simple but incredibly flavorful.  The only change we make is if tomatoes aren't in season, we get canned whole ones instead and chop them.

I loved the feta and red pepper flakes but it was missing something...kalamata olives or tomato/pasta sauce? I will make this again but add to the recipe. UPDATE: Used chopped italian diced canned tomatoes with olive oil--so much more flavor and also served over whole wheat egg noodles. Increased the red pepper flakes too. YUMMY!

Yummy and easy!  I used canned diced tomatoes with basil/garlic/oregano spices...the rest the same as recipe...did not add feta until we had it on our plates.  A nice 'go to' meal...as I don't eat meat this is great...but as others have done, can easily add chicken, shrimp etc.  Thanks for recipe that is healthy and yummy

With just a little change this recipe was awesome!  We added 2 (raw) hot sausages sliced up to the pan first, then as they were almost done cooking added the onion and garlic. (We didn't need any red pepper flakes because of the sausage.)  Then add the mushrooms so they can cook a bit before the tomatoes.  
Also, make sure that you add the spinach LAST, not at the same time as the tomatoes because it wilts super fast!
Served with bow tie pasta and it was delicious!!

I love the ease and delicious taste of this recipe.  I used one 15oz can diced tomatoes and one fresh, which added a little more sauce that I thought it needed.    I also used canned mushrooms because I didn't have fresh.   I think a whole cup or more of spinach can definitely be added.

Light tasting and mild.  If your looking for strong flavor and sauce, I would suggest looking for another recipe.  This one is good the way it is.  Only suggestion is to add the pepper flakes in with the onion and garlic so more of the flavor comes out in the first seriving and like others, add more feta!  Great with garlic bread as it would be with rotissery chicken.  Yum... A keeper in my home.

Awesome.  Made this for many meat eaters and they did not miss a thing.  I added more garlic and olive oil (but I'm an "estimater" anyway, but have fun with it!

This is just super. I had to substitute the type of pasta and cheese, but turned out really nice.

Very delicious though i must admit I did make a couple of changes.  I used 3/4 c chopped onion and 2 cloves of chopped garlic along with 2 pinches if red pepper flakes.  I used whole wheat pasta because it is more healthy.  During winter we don't get good fresh tomatoes so I used canned diced.  Lastly, all I had in the house was garlic/herb feta and it turned out to be a great addition.  The only substitution that might have changed the original recipe was the cheese.  This is great but the addition of some sliced grilled chicken would make a full meal.

This was really good.  My family thought it was too cheesy but I thought the cheese was just right.  It could use more spinach though.  My kids picked the pasta out and left the other ingredients so I probably will not make again.

FABULOUS!! I am not a good cook by any means. I made this and gave the leftovers to family members so they would believe that I can cook. Made a few adjustments: used wheat pasta, portabella mushrooms and sundried tomatoes instead of regular.  Also added pine nuts and left out the onion (I don't like). Still tasted great and hard to believe it's healthy. I am going to the store to get the ingredients and make it again tomorrow. Super easy, super delicious!!!

I used 12 oz of pre-cooked chicken breast strips to add some protein. I also used halved grape tomatoes and wheat pasta. This was a wonderfully flavorful and filling meal.

I just made this and it is DELICIOUS!  I used dried onion flakes and put them in the pasta water.  I cut back on the tomatoes only because I did not have that many on hand.  I know it says it makes 4 servings but, I think it is closer to 6...depends on how much you eat.  I plan on taking this for lunch all week long!  Very flavorful!!  Very easy to make!  I made it while I made another dish and I was not overwhelmed!!

I cooked this for a friend's Birthday Dinner and it was GREAT! I will mention that I had read some of the reviews and I am one of those cooks who always adds extra of what a recipe calls for or I just add something I think might work. (it usually does) With that said, I followed someones advice and added extra spinach (4 cups packed) and I used 16 ounces of crumbled feta cheese. This will definitely be one of my main, easy to "Throw Together" recipes. BTW, the 3 friends ALL wanted the recipe. I am so glad I found this site and will be contibuting some of my recipes. Thanks to all of you wonderful cooks out there and whoever started this site. Everyone have a Blessed 2011.

This pasta is excellent!  Sometimes I add cooked chicken strips (seasoned with garlic powder, salt, and pepper).  I have made it without the mushrooms (didn't have any on hand), and it is just as good!

UNBELIEVABLE! This was soooo good, I should have added moree spinach , so next time I will do that. I cut up some spicy turkey sausage and sauteed it with the onion and garlic. I also put 3 to 4 cloves.  This was great!

SO good, so easy! This looked incredible with the bright reds and greens - very healthy and appetizing! Added lots of garlic - about 5 cloves. Also added 2 tubs of pre-washed, organic spinach leaves. Didn't measure tomatoes but chopped up 4. Left everything else as is. What a delightful, healthy, summer meal. Serve with crusty french bread!

Quite Good.  Added extra spinach and tomatoes, grilled chicken, and a bit of mozz cheese.  Also added zucchini spears which I think make a big difference.  Seasoned with Cavendar's. Easy.  Easy.

This was pretty tasty! I had to use frozen spinach and halved cherry tomato's (on hand). I also added chopped red bell pepper and essentially doubled everything except the pasta. Next time I may try to melt the feta with some chicken broth in a seperate pan to make it a bit smoother. We will make this again!

This was pretty good, but too watery. I would definitely drain out some of the excess liquid before adding the feta.

Delicious! Suggestions: Definitely add Kalamata olives. Such an important flavor to add punch. I also cooked the mushrooms separately in red wine to make them more tender and to add flavor before combining them with everything else. I do agree with more spinach. And canned diced tomatoes were totally fine because so much of the rest of it tasted very fresh and the tomatoes become more of a sauce anyway.  This was easy but was praised for both taste and presentation. Serve with a greek salad and drink some red wine for a fantastic evening :)

We loved this recipe.  I also added extra spinach, garlic and crushed pepper.  Thanks Suki for a great recipe for those of us trying to cut down on the meat.

This was REALLY tasty!  I thought the amount of spinach was fine (maybe I am a better packer than some?) but I did use 4x the amt of garlic.  I added black olives, and used cherry tomatoes for the tomatoes.  Thanks, Suki, for a delicious recipe!  :)

excellent recipe.  Made some changes to suit my palate.  Increased garlic (minced) to 1 tbs, added 2 chicken and spinach sausage skinned, chopped and fried with the onions and garlic. Used the Feta cheese with garlic.

I LOVE THIS! I have made a few changes over the years- I double the spinach and use 4-5 garlic cloves, I use a lot of red pepper because I love it, I also add a little white wine and/ or chicken broth depending on what I have. My favorite addition is shrimp- I LOVE shrimp and or scallops in this dish!

Very flavorful!  I really don't care for feta cheese, but when a Greek friend gave me some, I didn't want to insult him, so I prepared this dish for us one evening.  It was delicious and surpassed all my expectations.  The only thing I did differently was used 4 cloves of garlic.  I will make this again.

I wish I could give this three and a half - it was pretty good, but I felt like there was something missing.  Maybe I'll try again and add something like artichokes or kalamata olives.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was good - just a tiny bit low on flavor even though I added veg broth to make it more saucy and added fresh basil at the end.  I think this would be perfect with some kalamata olives or marinated artichoke hearts.  I will make it again with a few revisions.  My toddlers ate it up so that's always good!!

My husband and I LOVED this!!  The only change I made was based on other reviewers recommendations to add more spinach.  I used about 6 cups.  This is a great way to use those extra tomatoes when too many are ripening at once.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

My husband really liked this, but I thought it could use basil or some other flavor.  I used whole wheat rotini pasta instead of penne, and I added chicken, which may have contributed to the need for more saucey rich flavor.  Will try again, maybe seasoning the chicken more, adding basil and some Kalamata Olives too!

Very, very good recipe. My husband said it's a keeper! I used 2 chicken breasts sliced thinly and roma tomatos (removing the seeds before dicing) and about 2 TB fresh oregano from my garden. I also added a couple tsp of McCormick's garlic salt, half a shallot (no onions), 2 cloves of garlic and 1 tb butter. Definitely use more spinach (it looks like a lot when you put it in the pan but it cooks way down). I used half a box of whole wheat penne pasta. Would recommend doubling the recipe if you want to use an entire box of pasta. It was saucy and delish! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

Very good! I subbed a can of artichokes for the mushrooms and used a can of diced tomatoes. Also, added 1/4 cup vermouth and juice of half a lemon.  I did see the fancy feta at Trader Joe's but opted for the cheaper, regular stuff and it was just fine. It's 6 oz which was plenty.

Wow- delish and easy even with whole wheat pasta. I didn't have mushrooms and used canned tomatoes but this was amazing. A little extra garlic and oil because we love it and you have a great flavor blend. Use greek feta and not the cheap kind for this- the cheese gives it great depth. Thanks for sharing!

When I found this recipe, I thought this sounded wonderful. Then I saw the calorie and fat count-ugghhh.  So I reformulated the recipe and used only 1 tsp of olive oil, whole wheat penne pasta, extra garlic and only 6 oz. of feta cheese. It was still WONDERFUL!!!! And the calories came to just over 300 per person with a huge serving! Great recipe!

This was "luscious".  I added olives and artichokes as well.  The FETA, as someone else mentions, MUST BE real Greek feta, which can be gotten at Harris- Teeters, Trader Joes, World Market and at Super Giants if you have any one of these around you.

Loved It!  My son is a pasta critic and he really liked it too.  I used more olive oil as when I added the mushrooms and spinach it wasn't moist enough.  I didn't add the tomatoes until the very end after I had already mixed in the pasta and this kept the tomatoes from getting too mushy.  Will definitely make it again.

Really excellent recipe that is easily tweaked for personal taste.  I followed everything with a few additions that we like:
Cooked 1/2# bacon and used the grease for the onions/garlic instead of olive oil.  Swapped finely chopped broccoli for mushrooms.  Garnished with crumbled bacon, lots of fresh basil and freshly grated parmesean cheese.  Finished it all off with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice.  Really colorful and delicious and I was requested to 'please' make it again.  Definitely putting this into my 'easy' supper rotation.

This was pretty good. I only had half the amount of feta and no onion so I had to use minced. I will try this recipe again and be a little better prepared.

This was sooooo good and easy to make. I used a whole bag of spinach and added artichoke hearts. Delicious!

I loved this recipe. I made it for a dinner party and my friends and family loved it. I added chicken which was good. To accompany the meal I made bread with feta so good. Will make again.

OMG!!  No words can acurately describe how good this is!! I cooked it for dinner last night and just finished having the leftovers for lunch.  It is soooo good!  The only recommendation I have is if you like spinach add more that is what I did as initially it seemed as tho I had more pasta than spinach etc.  Great!

It's perfect just the way it is. Abosultey delicious and so super easy to make it's ridiculous. My 3 kids even liked it though the hot pepper was a bit too much for them. Though it's my fault because I added more and a little went a long way. :)

One of my favorite recipes because of it's full flavor and cook quick time.

I've made this dish more times than I can count.  It's so easy and quick, but tastes restaurant quality.  I sometimes replace the tomatoes with the sun-dried variety, and also sometimes toss in some cooked shrimp towards the end.

So simple, so fresh, so delicious!  Left out mushrooms and threw in a little fresh basil.  Presents beautifully as a dinner for guests, and made the house smell like a five-star Italian restaurant. Served it up with a simple lettuce and vinaigrette salad.  We made the full recipe for the two of us and had leftovers the next day which reheated very nicely.  Can't wait to try it with a grilled chicken breast or shrimp!

We really enjoyed this pasta.  I doubled the amount of spinac.  Was out of tomatoes so threw in some sweet red peppers instead.  Used "fat-free" tomato-basil feta, which was very good and will use again.  May try crumbling the feta on top at the end as others have suggested. My ultra-picky husband, who only eats his pasta with Prego, even enjoyed this pasta!

This is excellent- even better once reheated. I will be making this weekly. The only changes I made were: I doubled the spinach, used less feta (1/2cup), used whole wheat linguine, and instead of salt I used a lot of red pepper flakes. This kicked it up- but it was fabulous. This is my new favourite pasta dish.

This recipe is fantastic! I made it basically as written, except I used an entire bag of spinach and extra garlic and red pepper. I expected it to be drier, but the feta melts and makes a delicious sauce. It was an instant favorite with my family. I would give it more stars if I could.

We really liked this recipe. I made some very slight modifications- I added the crushed red pepper to the onions and garlic so it would infuse into the oil a little bit (we like spicy food!), then when the onions were almost done I threw in about a pound of shrimp. As soon as both sides turned pink, I threw in the rest of the vegetables. If you like spinach, I would recommend adding a whole bag- 2 cups looks like a lot but cooks down to less than half! The feta added a great creamy consistency. A great dish!

Can't say that I enjoyed this much. Did not have very much flavor. I sprinked some paremsan and lemon juice on at the end for flavor and then it was not too bad. Would not make it again.

SO good, and SO simple and quick! with a can of diced tomatoes, it makes it even easier, the only thing needed to be cut is the onion! The melted feta made it nice and creamy too. I added some cooked salmon to the dish for some protein, and it was delicious. I'll definitely be making this again.

This is a simple fantastic fresh recipe. Thank you! Even the kids liked it. I made it with fat spaghetti did not have penne. My husband who is not a fan of feta loved it, this will be a welcome addition to the Oh %^4# I still gotta make dinner notebook. Thank you very much!

I am suprised at how delicious this is.  I thought it might be bland...boy was I wrong!  The only change I made was to add a dash of dried basil to the onion/garlic mixture.  I don't eat meat, but for hubby I added chicken-spinach-feta sausage and he loved it.  Tastes like something I'd pay big bucks for!

I have made this twice and both times it was great.  I used a mixture of regular penne pasta and whole wheat penne pasta the first time and could not tell a difference in taste.  The second time I used all whole wheat and it was still yummy!

I also added a can of black olives and will be adding some capers next time.

The feta cheese is a MUST.  It makes the dish.

I also used two can of petite diced tomatoe and a whole bag of fresh baby spinach. I like lots of "sauce" on my pasta!

This recipe is soooo healthy!  I even used it for a recipe exchange amongst friends.

I've made this several times, and it always turns out great. Feta can sometimes be overpowering, but it really made this dish. I should note, though, that I always use an herbed feta cheese when I make this (if I only have regular feta, I toss in about half a teaspoon each of basil and oregano). Even my boyfriend (who always thinks pasta is boring) loved it!

DELICIOUS! I used 1 can of diced tomatoes (drained). Watch the amount of salt you use as the feta is salty already. Will definitely make again!

It was very good.  The pasta will dry out if it's not served right away.  I splashed a little olive oil over top and stirred it around at the end to make sure it was nice and moist.  I also added some chicken breast.  My parents loved it.

This dish is excellent and can be made even healthier with a few variations: I omitted the oil and sauteed the onion and garlic with the tomatoes for excess liquid. I reduced the total cheese to 6 ounces: 3.65-ounce package reduced-fat tomato-basil feta, and the other 3-ish ounces lowfat cottage cheese. I followed the advice of others and increased the veggies and spices (more spinach, garlic, mushrooms, and crushed red pepper; added one small zucchini and Italian seasoning). I reduced the pasta to 6 ounces and it was more than enough. Overall concoction was super rich and flavorful!

Delicious and so easy! Doubled the garlic (love the stuff!), didn't use mushrooms since I was out, and added pinches of dried oregano/basil during seasoning. Heated about 10 small olives (sliced) (which I did have in the fridge) with the feta cheese at the end. Makes for a quick weeknight meal, especially if you already have leftover cooked pasta to use up. Thinking about adding sundried tomatoes next time.  Will definitely make again! The dish wasn't "liquidy" at all - be sure water from spinach is pressed out as much as possible before adding and seed tomatoes first if needed.

This pasta was good. I used a can of tomatoes. I used the exact amount of mushrooms and spinach, but as others have said, increasing the amount would be better. I found the pasta to be a bit bland, so i added more pepper flakes. If this had chicken in it, it would be better!

I thought there was way too much pasta for the sauce.  The tomatoes also made the sauce very watery & soupy despite bumping up the amount of feta.  This is not something I would make again.

Great recipe. I added a chicken breast, used canned tomatoes, and used Kraft "Mediterranean" crumbles. Next time I'll use strictly feta and double the spinach.  Remember to use a LARGE pan, especially if you add extras.

I thought this was very good.  I used Garlic & Herb Feta Cheese which added additional flavor.  Next time I'll add way more spinach, mushrooms, etc but I like a lot of "stuff" in mine....still good though!

This pasta was delicious! I did do some things differently. First I didn't use the red pepper flakes and then I used canned diced tomatoes. Yummy!

This was great, nice summer meal. My kids loved it. I doubled the recipe so I could have leftovers but my hungry family at a lot of it. I did put more spinach in it also. The spinach kind of disappears when it cooks so be aware of that fact. Anyway Thanks a lot, it was delicious.

Delicious! I didn't have mushrooms so just added sun dried tomatoes after sauteing the onions, garlic, tomatoes and spinach. This one is a keeper and so unbelievably simple!

I made this recipe twice so far, and I'm definetely making it more. Someone always asks for the recipe. I would add more spinach, and if you are worried that the feta might be a bit too strong, add a little bit of tomatoe sauce to make the color more read. The feta blends in so well anyway, so the extra tomatoe sauce is more for aesthetic reasons than anything else.

So Good! I used the 2 servings recipe and only used 1/4 cup of onions (personal preference). I put too much penne in it but the flavor was still great. Thanks!

Wow, this is so simple and tastes like a million bucks!  I used one 15 oz. can of diced Italian style tomatoes (drained) because tomatoes are out of season.  It was the perfect amount of tomatoes for me.  Since I'm a vegetarian and need a little extra protein, I added some toasted walnuts just before serving.  I’ve also made this using chevre in place of feta, adding a splash or two of milk with great results.

Dang, this is good. I followed the recipe to the letter and was amazed at how easy it was. Next time I'll double the spinach and halve the cheese, just to make it a little more healthful.

A light and easy dish. I only used 4oz of feta because my eaters aren't big on cheese, and it still imparted a nice flavor without making it overly cheesy. I also poured the sauce over chicken breasts and baked them @ 350 for 20 minutes then served it all up over pasta. Yummy!

I can't explain why these ingredients produced such a lucious dish, but this was soooooo good!!!  I used one 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes instead of the fresh tomatoes, and the sauce was perfect.  I also used less pasta (so more "goodies" in each serving!).  A keeper.
Thank you, Suki!

Excellent ! I used baby spinach, canned diced tomatoes seasoned with basil and basil seasoned feta, as suggested in previous reviews. Using the baby spinach and canned tomatoes there is hardly any work !   Great for leftovers too.

Excellent recipe and so easy.  The flavor is definitely not intense, but I liked it because it is a subtle light pasta dish. I liked it as is, but for those who want more flavor, I am sure you could spice it up.  Very tasty.  I used one can of diced tomatoes (drained) Thanks Suki!

Great and very tasty!  We'll be fighting over the leftovers! I just added more spinach, almost a whole bag, because we really like it and the I used a can of diced tomatoes because the fresh looked terrible in the store.  It was great even with the changes.

This recipe gets major points for being relatively quick and easy - especially if you cheat and by diced tomatoes and presliced fresh mushrooms, like I did!  I have to admit, I wasn't totally crazy for it.  It was good, just not GREAT.  But my boyfriend absolutely loved it.

Made this last night - happened to have all the ingredients - turned out perfect!!! Served with baked salmon with just a touch of olive oil and lemon pepper. Husband, who really does not like spinach, really liked it in this dish. If you love cheese - don't skimp on the feta - it seems like alot, but it was perfect. I suggest cooking the mushrooms down, then adding the spinach to wilt down, then the tomatoes because we prefer our tomatoes a little more whole, and not so cooked down. Thanks, Suki!

I was searching for a long time for a spinach sauce recipe with pasta...Excellent !! 
I used 2 tinned cans of tomato with jalapeno,frozen spinach 3 (10 oz) packs,and 4 oz of feta and  4 oz of cream cheese with a bit of mozzarella cheese. Also i cooked teh mushrooms for a bit longer till they changed color for more taste and cooked thawed spinach and tomatoes till done. For next time i would use cooked chicken for a complete meal. Thanx for a great recipe.

This is sooo good! I am a feta cheese freak and this sure fit the bill. I made with store bought tomatoes and it was great. I am anxiously awaiting our crop because this recipe will be amazing with fresh, home grown tomatoes. The kids liked it as I served it to them before adding the feta. They did not realize it contained spinach. I said it was "baby greens." Thank you, Suki!

This is good stuff. We are going to make this at least once a week now. I used grape tomatoes (all I had on hand), and 8 oz. of mushrooms.  Next time I will double the spinach at least. It looks like you are adding a lot of spinach, but it all gets cooked down. Use only fresh spinach. My boyfriend gave it 4/5 stars, but he never gives anything 5 stars. You can use 7 oz. of almost any kind of pasta.

This meal was very good......  I did change it around to make it basically...FAT FREE!!  So, I gave this recipe a 4 star with my changes to the recipe.  I didn't use any olive oil...I used Olive Oil Spray (PAM)...and I also used fat free feta cheese.  I took the advice of others...and added more spinach...(doubled it)..I may triple the spinach next time...cause it wilts to nothing...  My husband loved it too...may add chicken next time.  I made it again..a few days later...and just ate it plain without any pasta!!!  Delicious!!

This was a delicious dish! It hardly took any prep time at all.  I used halved cherry tomatoes for a better look, and I doubled the amount of spinach.  Also, I didn’t drain the spinach as much as I should have, but the water kinda fused with some of the tomato juice to make a small amount of sauce in the pan which was really good.  My family loved it – thanks!!

This was awesome!! As a vegetarian, with a non-vegetarian husband, it is difficult to find meals that fit my lifestyle and satisfy him.  This one did!  I was concerned that the flavor may be bland when looking at the recipe but the flavors, once cooked together, mingled perfectly. I added a little bit of crushed red pepper for zip and 1 cup more spinach and it was great!  This is definitely a keeper!!

This is one of the best meals I've ever had!  I'm a vegetarian, and my husband is not, so we have a hard time agreeing on meals.  This pasta is one of the only thing that we both consistently agree on for dinner!  You can change small parts of this recipe to fit your taste, but it's great just the way it is!

Nice variation for pasta. The feta really made a difference. I cooked the tomatoes, mushrooms, and spinach a bit too long, but it was still very good. Better the next day!

This was very good. My husband suggested I add toasted pine nuts next time, which I think would be excellent.  I will make this again.

I thought this recipe was okay. It didn't have very much flavor, but it looked pretty and there was nothing objectionable about it. I'm not sure I'll make this again. If I do, I'll definitely add some other ingredients to it to give it a kick.

I was expecting this recipe to taste somewhat bland, and I didn't have red pepper flakes so I left them out, but it was delicious.  The feta cheese really gave it some punch.  I'll definitely make it again, maybe this time with a little chicken (but it was great as it was.)
I've now made this recipe a dozen times, but I make it with jumbo shrimp.  Everyone loves it.....a one dish meal.

A very tasty recipe.  I only used 4 ounces feta, and that was enough for us.  Next time I would make sure I chopped up my spinach, so it was well mixed throughout the dish.  Yummy!

I agree with others that said to put the feta on top leaving it in a crumbled state rather than melting it in.  I loved all the feta, but cutting it back would be just as tasty :)

Super tasty!!! I made the recipe as it said. Ok. Well. I added more mushroom and more spinach than it called for and since my hubby loves his protein I cooked some shrimp in the pan before adding the pasta and feta. Will be making this time and time again. Loved how the feta melted slightly giving it a creamy base. Thank you for the recipe! A new go to fast supper!!

Loved this so much I made it again.  I add a sprinkle of Italian seasoning at the end.  It goes well with meatballs or crab legs as a side.  Can also add Prosciutto and have it as a main dish.

Delicious and easy!  I’ve made it twice - both times using a whole bag of spinach & added sundried tomatoes as suggested in other reviews.  I tried it once with fresh tomatoes & once with a can of diced, and preferred the diced as they had more flavor.  It has been a big hit & already requested for a third time!

Made exactly per recipe.  It was filling and good but a little on the dry side.  I drizzled a little zesty Italian dressing on it.  Made it meatless on a Friday in lent but will make it again adding chicken or shrimp.

I increased the penne to 12 oz. box of veggie pasta, which increased the protein to 8 grams per serving.  I doubled the spinach, mushrooms, onion, and garlic.  I used canned chopped tomatoes, since it's winter.  I think basil would be a nice addition next time.

This was easy, fast and very tasty! I was worried that the feta cheese might be too strong for us, especially for my husband who doesn’t like cheese much. But when it melted, it became such a mild wonderful flavor at the end. I also set aside some spinach and added it at the very end. Thank you!

This is tasty and very versatile - just throw in whatever you have in the fridge. This made a quick easy lunch for 7 with the addition of some chicken and extra veggies to bulk the dish out a little. Everyone enjoyed the feta flavour. Will make again.

This pasta salad tastes way better than I thought it could, given the simplicity of the ingredients. All of the flavors compliment each other so well. The juices from the vegetables come together to coat the entire dish, so it doesn't need more seasoning than the salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes.

I did use slightly differing amounts of the veggies and cheese, but it's not an exact science.

I used Greek Dodoni feta cheese, which is incredibly bold, tangy and rich. 

My boyfriend took one bite of this and said it was the best pasta salad he'd ever had. I agree.

I loved this recipe!  I made it with a friend and it was a hit!  Easy and refreshing!  We used extra cheese, pepper flakes, and we added onion salt.  It was more of a pasta salad than a pasta with sauce.

This was a tasty, quick dinner for a meat free night. I used a large can of diced tomatoes in place of fresh tomatoes, and added in a sliced red pepper, extra spinach, and an extra clove of garlic. Served with Italian bread. Very tasty.

Made this for the first time today, stuck to the recipe and it was super! Our fussy 12 and 16 yo boys both enjoyed as we did. We will have this again. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Super easy and tasty, it was just good luck that a happened to have all the ingredients, (I'm not a big fan of feta), would I be able to substitute another cheese and still hopefully not have left-overs? Ricotta? Parmesan? Gouda? I'm sure it's all to each individual and a lot of trial and error but if anyone has modified this with any success let me know ;)

Came out great on Friday night. Swapped out the feta for goat cheese. Next time I should put the goat cheese on top instead of mixing with the pasta. Overall very enjoyable.

This pasta is absolutely delicious. I was surprised by how flavorful it was with so few ingredients. It really doesn't need anything added but it's amazing with some cooked bacon in it. Even better as leftovers! I made it with frozen chopped spinach because it's all I had and it still came out great.

A really delicious recipe!  I made some adjustments which is why I gave it 4 stars.  I did not use mushrooms but instead added artichoke hearts.  I also added cooking sherry and fresh rosemary.  We topped the dish with feta instead of mixing it in allowing people to eat as much or as little as they wanted to.

Not very exciting. The main appeal of this dish is how easy it is. I didn't find it particularly filling either. Feta cheese is expensive and so high in sodium and there's so much of it in this dish - of course, without the feta it would be pretty bland. It would be better with some modifications.

This was a pretty decent pasta dish.  I increased the amount of garlic, and added some kalamata olives.  I'm wondering if a little bit of lemon squeezed over it at the end might not have been nice?  When I make it again, maybe I'll try it.  Great for weeknight meals.

I didn't have mushrooms and added more than a dash of red pepper flakes for some more zip. 

This was surprisingly delicious for something so simple. I would happily make it again and you can add whatever fresh veggies you have on hand.  I should have used some of the zucchini in the fridge but was in a rush. A great dish when you are pressed for time or want a meatless night.

Spectacular! I added more garlic, because I always do, and I let the dish simmer a bit longer so the feta would melt. Next time I might put some white wine in, because I prefer this dish to have sauce rather than separate ingredients. This is going to be a regular on our family menu!

Made this dish for a work potluck, everyone loved it. I did use about half the amount of feta that was called for, which worked out perfectly.  The next time I make this I will double the amount of veggie.s

This is the best tasting pasta salad. The combination of the veggies, pasta, garlic and Feta are an explosion of flavor in your mouth. I didn't want to stop eating it. I used veggie macaroni and extra spinach.

The flavor was good, will add more Feta Cheese and Spinach if I make it again. When it was all prepared, it sure didn't look as appetizing as the picture did!  I'll keep looking for a Vegetarian Pasta dish that REALLY makes an impression because this one didn't! Sorry! :-(

Absolutely one of my favorite pasta dishes to make and enjoy.

For best results, use vine-ripened tomatoes.

This was so quick and easy to make, and absolutely delicious. However, I give this a 3 as is because the proportions seem very "off" to me. I would double the spinach and likely the mushrooms and tomatoes as well, because by the time they cook down, they are barely existent in the dish. I also halved the cheese (and use goat cheese instead of feta, just a personal favorite!). The pasta is so cheesy as is, I feel like twice as much as I included would be more than excessive. Essentially by the time it's done, you just have cheesy pasta with a hint of vegetables. I will absolutely be making this again with the aforementioned modifications.

Wonderful recipe.  Wonderful taste.  I added chopped, cooked chicken and served garlic bread and a salad.  I'll definitely make this again.

I didn't use the mushrooms so I thought I would add extra veggies, but the spinach cooked down more than I thought. I will add more veggies next time and some chicken. It was very tasty and fairly easy to make quickly.

great, but too much cheese. 4 oz is plenty and you cannot have too much spinach, so use the whole bunch of whatever you have, spinach or chard.

I made it as written and It was okay, but I didn't care for the amount of feta cheese in it.  My husband thought it was more of a side dish.  Like all the fresh ingredients though.

Been making this for almost a year and LOVE it. Im a huge fan of past and feta. I did however leave out the mushrooms and onions and I top it with fresh tomatoes instead of cooking them in. I have also added sauteed chicken breast In sometimes for a dinner meal. I rarely measure ingredients. I usually eyeball it according to what I like. I plan to make some tonight for myself for dinner. Yum!

Yum, yum, yum this is delicious!! I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. I wouldn't change anything. Even my 2.5 year old daughter ate it all, and she seriously hates anything green she picks it out even when hidden. I made it as a man dish with the whole wheat pasta so chicken wasn't needed but it would make a nice edition. This is a great healthy meal and added to my favorites. Thank you!

It's delicious!! Unfortunately, I didn't have mushrooms or fresh tomatoes so I had to make due with what I had which was a 28oz can of diced tomatoes and I added asparagus, the other ingredients I just added more of; a bag of baby spinach, extra feta and it was perfect!! My husband and I enjoyed it very much!!

This recipe is excellent. I ended up just using a whole bag of spinach, 2 tomatoes, and a whole package of mushrooms and it was just the right amount. The feta was spot on, making a cheesy sauce with the tomato juice. I would recommend sauteeing the mushrooms with the onion and garlic as well. Great pasta, will be one of my favorites.

I used tofu noodles, and added black olives and jalapenos.  Absolutely delicious!  My husband didn't know that they were tofu noodles until I told him.

Needed more flavor, but I did omit the pepper flakes because my daughter doesn't like spicy foods. I will make again adding more garlic and maybe some basil.

This recipe is so simple but so good. I added some extra crushed red pepper to make it a little bit spicier, but just the garlic flavour is excellent.  The original vegetarian version is great, but it would also be good with chicken or whatever meat you prefer. 
This is the kind of recipe you can play with easily to suit your own tastes. Personally, I would omit the mushrooms next time. I normally like mushrooms, but they just felt out of place in this dish.  Maybe another kind would be better than the regular white mushrooms that I used?

I followed this recipe exactly, except my feta container was only 5.4oz. It was okay but definitely not 5 stars in my book. The feta cheese added the only flavor, and i used fresh produce from my garden. I would make this again with lots of changes, because i think its a great base - but personally if the best part of a dish is cheese there leaves a lot to be desired.

This is a great easy recipe to make - but it tastes SO much better the day AFTER you make it. I made it for dinner one night and my husband and I liked it, but when we took the leftovers to work the next day - hot ! So now I only make it on Sunday nights with another dinner and we take this to work the next couple days.

Made this for dinner tonight, and everyone loved it!  I didn't have any red pepper flakes, so I added a dash of cayenne pepper, but that was the only change I made!  Great way to use fresh veggies!

I made this last night and it was delicious! I used a bit more garlic and onions but otherwise stayed true to the recipe as written. I had to stop myself from eating the whole thing at once! Thank you for the yum!

Cook the veggies very briefly to avoid mushiness and excess water. Add the feta in big pieces AFTER the veggies have been added to the pasta.

Easy summer dinner -- great use of the tomatoes my husband grows.  It was quite a bit "thinner" that I anticipated, but our tomatoes are very juicy!  And I only had 4 oz of feta, so I added a handful of fresh parmesan and a handful of mozzarella instead.  Does scream to be served with french bread!  We will make this again.

This was very good. As we get older we try to go meatless at last three times a week. Unlike some reviewers I didn't find it bland or dry (but saved some pasta water just in case) but even though I used over a pound of fresh spinach, it wasn't enough. I used canned San Marzano tomato's drained and diced, quadrupled the garlic, doubled the onion and pepper flakes and sauteed the mushrooms with the onions/garlic which is where I got some extra moisture. A keeper.

I made this and was pleasantly surprised! As a vegetarian I make many dishes with these ingredients, but following the directions exactly make a wonderful dish warm, and it's excellent leftover cold as a pasta salad (adding a small bit of balsamic vinaigrette if you please).

I loved this recipe! I made this in one serving by cutting the ingredients to 1/4 of each listed. I had everything on hand except for fresh garlic, but 1 tsp of jarred minced garlic (for 1 serving) worked just as well.  I used a little more onion and tomato also. As previous posters have said, the feta is what makes this dish. I was worried it would be too much but it's perfect! 1 serving is only 400 calories and very filling. I'm thinking about adding a little bit of ground turkey next time.

This recipe is easy and quick, and doesn't really require any tinkering.  The only changes I made were to add a little onion powder and garlic powder, and I used spaghetti instead of penne because that's what I had.  Delicious!

Thank you! Cooking isn't really part of my skill set, but I nailed this one! My brother (who doesn't like tomatoes) loved it too. I took out the onions, doubled the mushrooms and the spinach, and added red bell peppers for a little color. It was wonderful!

I used frozen spinach (thawed) and two cans of drained diced tomatoes-only because that's all I had. I peeled a zucchini into strips for my "noodles" to make my meal low carb and my husband had thin spaghetti noodles.   It was still delicious even with my little tweaks! Next time I will try the fresh tomatoes and spinach. Yum yum yum. This is a keeper. Thanks!

I had to omit the tomatoes since I had none and I substituted fresh basil for the spinach  I first seared 3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts in VERY hot EVOO 3-4mins each side took them out. In oil and drippings sautéed (3 mins) 4 cloves minced garlic and one chopped yellow onion. added 8 sliced mushrooms sautéed an additional 3 mins. Chopped up chicken added it back to pan added tsp crushed red pepper and 3/4 cup light cream. Bring to boil simmer uncovered stirring frequently until cream reduces 50%. Add 6-7 leaves chopped fresh basil cook 2 mins more. Meanwhile cook penne until al dente. Toss it all together with 8 oz crumbled feta.  BELLISSIMA!

Thank you for a great recipe.  Add 2 TBSP chopped Kalamata olives and 1 TBSP olive juice for acid balance.  2 more cloves of garlic is about right. Contrary to other reviews, DO NOT add salt unless you taste it first - there is plenty already in the feta.  Great on a ridged whole grain penne. Cook pasta until 90% done and finish off when you add to the sauce.

Super easy and delicious. Loved all the fresh veggies. I added the red pepper flakes with the onion and garlic and cooked it a bit in the oil.
Super delicious!

Really good flavors.  I added chicken, basil, couple slices of Havarti Cheese & Parmesan.  Next time I wouldn't add so much cheese and just do a light white sauce.  (Bacon would be a great addition!)

Made this for the first time tonight and it was AWESOME! I love using fresh ingredients, however I did add half a jar of roasted red peppers and a touch of garlic salt. Definitely will make again!

Made this for dinner last night and I will definitely be making it again! but I added some Italian seasoning and a little Marsala wine to it when I was cooking the garlic and onions. Also I left out the red pepper flakes.

This dish turned out very well, it was easy to follow and turned out be great. We changed by adding a little bit extra cheese because to bring a better taste but it was kind of too much. It still looked great and I would recommend add less cheese then what it tells.

This was pretty good. I made it for a vegetarian friend and added a can of rinsed white beans for extra protein, which went really well. I think this amount of feta cheese makes a good creamy dish but then the flavor overwhelmed the fresh veggies in the pasta. For my tastes I would either make this with just tomatoes and the same amount of cheese, or omit the cheese all together and make a lighter sauce to showcase the yummy veggies. I enjoyed trying this recipe, thanks so much for sharing.

This was delicious!!! I just love the flavor of the feta cheese. It made such a light, creamy and flavorful sauce!! It was a nice change from always eating a spaghetti type sauce! My boyfriend is always skeptical of meatless recipes, but paired with a salad it makes a good and healthy dinner!! A keeper for sure!

Great dish.  I didn't have fresh mushrooms at home but did have a small jar of marinated mushrooms.  I added fresh basil, used super greens (spinach, bok choy and kale), cherry tomatoes and tomato basil feta cheese.  As other suggested I added a little bit of Italian seasoning. I placed sliced breaded chik patty on top (Morning Side's veggie version of a breaded chicken patty which is delicious!) and served with garlic bread!!!!  This recipe is a keeper for sure!!!

This recipe was really good.  Followed the recipe except 2 things, put an extra large handful of spinach in and in a separate pan I cooked some chicken in garlic and butter and added it to the dish.  It was very tasty and I'll make again -probably with even more spinach!  Thanks for sharing!

This is the first recipe I made off of this site and to date remains a favorite of mine and my boyfriend. I substituted goat cheese for the feta cheese and it made the sauce more creamy and delicious. This is a great dish!

Recipe is excellent.  Have to admit I didn't "measure" anything and ended up with way to much pasta.  Next time around will use more ingredients and less pasta!!

Fresh flavor, really simple.  We added chicken.  I bet this would make a good cold salad too.  UPDATE/TIP:  If you plan to have leftovers with this, either don't re-warm the leftovers, or reserve the feta to garnish immediately before eating.  I've re-warmed leftovers with the feta mixed in melty feta is not too appealing to me.

such a simple yummy dish!  i quadrupled the garlic, tripled the spinach (and actually think i could have added even more).. didn't have any mushrooms.. and didn't bother with the red pepper flakes.. just made sure to salt and pepper it to my liking.. i could easily see how chicken or shrimp would be wonderful additions.. ty so much for this recipe

This recipe was easy & delish! The bf & I do not like mushrooms, so I omitted them & added chicken. I also doubled the garlic & spincah. Perfect. Will be making this one again & again! (Maybe adding a little bit more crushed red pepper next time)

Surprisingly good! I added Kalamata olives as another reviewer suggested, and we found that a little vinaigrette dressing really added a nice flavor. My son, who will have nothing to do with spinach, had no complaints, and even went for seconds. We'll definitely be making this again.

This was incredible!  I had to deviate from the recipe significantly due to lack of ingredients but it still turned out amazing!  I had no onion or any suitable substitute so instead I added some sundried tomatos for extra flavor.  I also had no green peppers or mushrooms but I did have an orange bell pepper and some leftover asparagus so I added that as well.  I used a combination of slicing and roma tomatos to get the 3 cups and I only had half the required feta so I added some fresh mozzarella to make up the difference.  Finally I added about 2 teaspoons of oregano and some kalamata olives to really intensify the flavor.  The final product knocked my wife and I's socks off.  So much depth of flavor for such a healthy dish, this will be added to the rotation!

Loved this recipe! Super easy too. I ended up doubling the recipe (everything but the feta), and used grape tomatoes cut in half which gave it a really nice sweetness. Easy and adaptable to what you have.

Easy, satisfying, and flexible (I added shrimp), but it didn't wow me like some other recipes on this site.

I made this tonight and it was delicious! I added a couple other seasonings to saute with the garlic and onion. I also used diced canned tomatoes. The only thing I would do differently next time is to saute the mushrooms in the garlic/onion mix for about a minute before adding the spinach and tomatoes.

Made this last night and loved it!  Will definitely make again.  I do think pine nuts might be good in it as well as kalamata olives.  I plan to add both next time.  Delicious and easy!

Yum!  Make sure not to add too much pasta (it will make the sauce bland).  I added more garlic and cheese to my taste.

I actually made this for myself tonight (single serving). I only had about 1oz. of gorganzola and used that in place of the feta. I used small cherry tomatoes cut in half and seared the skins before I put the spinach in to wilt. Threw in the cheese, made a few rounds around the pan with my spoon and scooped it into my bowl. I would use a little more garlic next time, other than that was a great, quick and easy dish!

This is AMAZING!  I doubled pretty much everything since I used an entire box of pasta and we love veggies, but I used only about 50% more feta (~12 oz) and it was still sooo tasty.  My husband said it tasted like a Noodles Co. dish!

This is amazing and I always feel good after eating it.  I add more fresh veggies, cut back on the feta (4oz rather than 6oz), and add extra red pepper.  My husband loves it too and he dislikes most of the ingredients.  Another plus about this dish is that you can pre cut the veggies a few hours before and whip it up in only 10-15 min.  Thank you Suki your the best :)

I doubled the vegetables in this but other than that followed it. My family loved it and it was easy to make. I added Turkey tenderloin chopped up to give the men a little extra protein.

great alternative to a red sauce! Packed with veggies. The feta I used was a little strong so maybe I will add a little less next time, otherwise good!

Oh my goodness, this is so good!  I used 3 cloves of garlic.  I added 2 small links of Italian sausage sauteed out of the casings, and a few pieces of Roasted Red Peppers because I needed to use both of these.  I would use them both in it again.  This is wonderful!!!

This was very good. I split the recipe in half and made two batches. One vegetarian, one with chicken. No mushrooms, we don't eat them. I forgot the red pepper flakes and I love spicy food, I'm sure it will be a great addition. Didn't add salt as feta is already salty. Added a splash of white whine.

This recipe is delicious. I like to add protein to it though, usually italian sausage. Also, I reserve a bit of feta cheese and sprinkle it on before serving.

Wow, this is delicious! I've made similar recipes before, but for whatever reason, this one really hit the spot. I followed the recipe exactly. Save some of the pasta water to throw in in case you need a little more juice---or add a touch of chicken broth.

There was a lot of extra sauce from the tomato juice, but I saved this and mixed it with rice for another pretty solid dish.  Easy to make for a beginner!

My all-time favorite summer dish - I highly recommend fresh tomatoes from your garden as the one time I made this with grocery store tomatoes, it didn't turn out nearly as good!  The first time I made this, the spinach got clumpy, so now I wait to add it with the pasta and feta - not as wilted, but we like it better that way!  It also re-heats fabulously!

I am a college student and made this having very little cooking expertise.  Used whole wheat pasta and omitted red pepper flakes.  Also added oregano and 10 garlic cloves instead of 1.  Was amazing.  
Even if you dont like hot things-- add the red pepper flakes-- it needs for flavor

Very yummy. I sauteed up the mushrooms on the side, since not all in our house like them, but otherwise did everything the same.

I used this recipe as a guide to tweek a recipe that fit our family tastes. I added chicken, used white wine, added kalamata olives, sundried tomatoes instead of regular tomatoes, added much more garlic, a bag of spinach, a bit more of the feta cheese than called for. I was planning to add artichokes  but completely forgot and only realized that when we were eating the meal. This recipe was great.

This was incredible, although I admit I made a few changes. I used 2 big cloves of garlic and added about 2 tablespoons of white wine while the onions and garlic were cooking. I added the tiniest pinch of nutmeg (yes...delishhhhh). I used way more spinach than called for and still didn't seem to be enough. I also did half feta, half mozzarella because I thought the feta would be too overpowering. Let it sit for a minute or two before serving so it gets nice and creamy. Yum so good!

Could not have been easier or more delicious!! Followed some of the reviewers suggestions and added more garlic, tomatoes, mushrooms, spinach (2x the amt) and hot pepper flakes. It all cooks down so much and it doesn't alter the taste (except for the pepper flakes, but I like it hot), it just gives you more of the delicious sauce in ratio to the pasta.

Made this last night for the first time, turned out absolutely delicious!  I reserved a small portion of the feta to sprinkle on top once plated.  Next time, I will use more spinach.  One of the best recipes I have found from this website!

I followed the recipe and like others suggested, I added more garlic, red pepper, and spinach.  I used wheat penne and threw in some pine nuts.  Yum! :)

Easy to make and very tasty! I used whole wheat bow-tie pasta in place of penne, and used grape tomatoes, sliced. I doubled the recipe and had plenty for dinner and to take for lunch the next couple of days.

Very good recipe!  We added a little flour to the onion/garlic/olive oil mixture after it browned and then a little white cooking wine.  We might try using sweet basil instead of the spinach next time just for variety.  My two kids (ages 16 and 9) really liked it also.

We liked this recipe. The sauce itself was very tasty and it will great not just over pasta. I didn`t have mushrooms so omitted them and the sauce was still delicious. Good comfort food.

This was absolutely delicious. I tweaked it a little bit so that i could make it a bit low calorie and it was amazing how GOOD it was. Will definitely make it again. 
*Since I am still learning to cook i miscalculated how much salt to add and so it was a little salty but it was still good =)

We always enjoy this recipe but I found it to be a little bland. I add chicken to add some protein to it, and used chopped canned Italian tomatoes instead. I double the onion and garlic and also add Italian spices to fill out that "gap" in flavor.

Made this for dinner tonite.  Made per recipe except I used (home) canned, drained tomatoes and no mushrooms.  Very tasty and my kids didn't complain too much about the spinach.  Whole wheat pasta + spinack + tomatoes = very healthy!

This is one of the best recipes I have found to date on this site.  I did only use half the suggested amount of feta because it was all I had, but it still turned out great.  I added some parmesan cheese after cooking to add some more flavor.  When I make it again, I think I could add even more spinach as it really cooks down.  I am not a big fan of mushrooms, but decided to throw them in just in case it needed it. I was pleasantly surprised and think the mushrooms add a nice flavor to the dish.  I will probably add even more next time! Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent pasta! I used whole wheat penne but other than that followed the instructions exactly. I don't think much needs to be done to improve this dish.  Thanks so much :)

AWESOME!  We loved this.  Added 3 extra cloves garlic, 3x the spinach, no mushroom, calamata olives (marinated).  Super!

My hubby and his buddy agreed that this is the best pasta dish I've ever made. I used a whole box of penne (13 oz), halved the feta, added mozzarella, used canned mushrooms, and plenty of salt and pepper. As another user suggested, I sauteed chicken in italian dressing and added it to the dish. It was delicious! Next time, I'll add more spinach and tomatoes.

The feta gave this dish so much flavor! We put romano cheese on top. This is a wonderful complement to chicken (I used vegan mock chicken, my mother had grilled chicken). We've been making a similar dish using broccolini, but never tried spinach or feta with it. We will definitely be making this again.

So good! I left out the mushrooms because I'm not a big fan but it was still full of flavor. I like that it doesn't feel as heavy as some pasta dishes. Great for summer!

This dish was pretty yummy, but I would add more garlic, spinach, and crushed red pepper. I don't like mushrooms, so I used some green bell pepper instead. I also added chicken because my husband needs his protein!

I was a bit skeptical about putting uncooked vegetables in with hot pasta - but I was wrong! Both myself and my fiance loved this.

I have made this several times and for a quick and easy meal I give this a five.  A great dish to put together after a trip to Costco for the feta and fresh spinach.  I used one can of diced tomatoes to replace the fresh ones since the tomatoes are currently out of season.  Thanks for sharing!

This was delicious and so simple. I didn't even have mushrooms and it still turned out great. We will definitely add this to the regular rotation. I used canned diced tomatoes to make it quick and easy enough for a work night.

Oh.  My.  Goodness!  Living overseas, where some ingredients would break the bank, I  doubled the pasta but kept the other ingredients the same, except the feta as I used only half the suggested amount.  (Being out of America so long, I can't take things as salty as most people!)  So creamy and delicious...we'll be making this a LOT!

The was delicious!!  I only had about 4 oz. of feta so I used that and about 4 oz. of parmesan.  Next time can't wait to make with more feta though!  I use ww penne pasta as well!  This is now one of my favorite pasta side dishes!  This would be great as a main course with some grilled chicken thrown in!  Thanks!

We loved it.  Used about 4 cups spinach, 3 cloves garlic and 1 1/2 cups mushrooms.  You could even add more mushrooms and spinach if you want.  Great flavors - thanks Suki!

I made this to complement the Awesome Baked Sea Scallops, which I thought would steal the show with my family.  NOT SO!!!  The hub especially, couldn't get enough of this.  We were fighting for the leftovers the next day.  I will definitely make again....maybe adding some sauted shrimp for a one-dish meal.  Oh!  This is just as good cold as it is hot.  I'm already thinking summertime salad.

This was a great recipe! I had my doubts about tomatoes (they are not my favorite).  I used a package of grape tomatoes and chopped them with spinach in the food processor. I also added chopped sweet Italian sausage.  It was delicious!  Next time I will definitely use the entire package of baby spinach though!  More spinach!!

YUMMY!!    THe only thing I changed was I did not cook the tomatoe.   I just added it just before serving.  But that is just a personal preference.   This was a super easy and yummy recipe!   I will make it again!

My husband & I loved this meal! I made a few changes. I used 16 oz. of good quality rotini (DeLallo brand). Doubled the garlic, doubled mushrooms, and used extra red pepper flakes. Served this with chicken breast grilled in garlic powder, salt & pepper, and sprinkled tomato & basil feta cheese over the whole thing. Delicious!!! Will make again!

Pretty good with a few tweaks. Reduced the feta by at least a quarter, added almost a lb of sliced mushrooms and used 4 cloves of garlic. I also replaced the chopped tomatoes with a 28oz can of diced tomatoes, drained. This help give the dish more of a sauce, which my fiance prefers. Served with some spicy italian sausage.

This was super great and easy to make! I took advice of other reviewers and added more spinach liberally. Also I added some (~3/4 oz) vegan mozzy cheese in addition to the feta. It was sooooooooooooo delicious.

I used Parmesan Cheese and Italian Seasonings instead of the Feta...  That's what I had on hand and it turned out beautifully!  Next time I'll try the feta and maybe add some chicken.  I would recommend adding more Spinach.  IT really cooks down!

Really good meal!  Very simple and easy to do.  You can increase or decrease any part of it as much as you want.  I diced up the mushrooms and used a bit less of the tomatoes.  You can also add Italian seasonings or black olives.

Simple and delicious, good combination of ingredients!  I added chicken with the onions, amd because I was low on feta I added a few tablespoons of cream cheese to the liquid to make it a little creamy.  Perhaps a bit fewer tomatoes, and more spinach as suggested.  It just goes to show what a flexible recipe it is!  Thanks!

YUMMY, this was very good and quick to throw together.  I used whole wheat penne and unfortunately ran out of 'fresh tomatoes' so didn't quite have enough (didn't want to open a tin), but nonetheless, this was very tasty.  Next time I will add much more spinach, I didn't measure this time, just grabbed handfuls and threw in, but it does cook down quite a bit.  Looking forward to leftovers and yes, this would be great adding in any type of chicken, shrimp, etc!

Really good and healthy.  I used whole wheat pasta and substituted squash for the mushrooms.  I also added turky sausage for some protien.

Good dish but didn't have the "wow" factor. I added some grilled chicken tenders to make it a full meal. Would maybe consider adding a little bit of white wine to give it more flavor.

This had a fantastic taste and it was so quick and easy to make! Added some extra garlic and red pepper flakes for some heat, but thats just me. If I was making this for guests I wouldn't change a thing!

Easy to make and delicious. I don't usually like feta but I loved it in this dish! I added kalamata olives (yum) and chicken that I dredged in flour and good seasons italian dressing mix. We will definitely add this to our list of "favorites!"

Yum! After reading some reviews that this could be bland, I was generous with the garlic, red pepper, salt, pepper, and veggies. I cut back the pasta to about a quarter of a box and seasoned to taste. I barely had any feta, so I added some parmesan and mozzarella. Very good recipe made from everything on hand. Will definitely make again.

Great!  I used 1 can of dice tom (drained), 5 oz froz spinach (defrosted and drained), added 5 cloves of garlic and a few leaves of chopped basil.  It was sooo easy and perfect since I had all the ingredients at home already.  I'll serve with crusty bread next time.

I realized when I started making this that I forgot to buy pasta- and it's great without it as a salad!  Next time will try it with the pasta also, but a healthier, low-carb version would be to skip the penne:)

Good recipe, but I prefer Greek Penne and Chicken from this site (with the modifications in my review).  This recipe just seemed to be lacking something for me.  It was very easy, though, so with a little doctoring it could be great.

Great recipe base.  Subbed the tomatoes with a can of diced Italian-style and that worked out well.  Also added a few more Italian spices to kick it up a bit, but overall tasted well on its own.  I think you can get away with less feta but that's personal preference.

Very tasty. If you are cooking for vegetarians and meat eaters, separate 1/2 of the portion into a separate pot once you've finished all the steps. Then add pre-cooked, shredded carnitas!

A very nice and simple dish, and a great way to sneak the spinach in without the kids noticing. You can add spices for more flavor.

This recipie was quick and simple, with easy to follow instruction.  Let's not forget to mention, the ingreidents were something that I already had on hand (except the feta).  Made it for my boyfriend for his weekly meal with garlic cheese toast and he LOVED it.  The only modification that I made was to add about 3 tablespoons of sugar (I like my food sweet/salty if that makes any scence).  But overall I will keep this in my monthly rotation.

This recipe was delicious! I did find it to be a little dry though so adding more tomatoes and spinach tends to make it a little tastier. We also added about 4 cloves of garlic instead of the one 1 that it calls for. Turned out flavorful and fantastic!!

Very good. I left out the mushrooms because we don't like them, I used canned tomatoes because that's what I had on hand. I had sent my husband to the store for feta cheese and he came back with fresh mozzarella so that's what I used. It was really good that way. Next time I'll try it with the feta but the mozzarella was great.

We make this a lot, but I don't add the mushrooms (because I don't like them).  This is great as a light meal and sometimes I add cooked shrimp or grilled chicken to it.

good. i used halved grape tomatoes, but it would probably be better with canned diced tomatoes or chopped fresh tomatoes. I also added oregano and marjoram, but it seems like it was lacking something. my husband loved it though.

We used real goat's milk feta for this.  So much better than other feta I have tried in the past, but ymmv depending on whether you like goat cheese.  Next time I'll experiment with a sprinkling of fresh herbs, but it was really perfect and delicious.

So good and so easy. A new favorite pasta dish. 
I made it essentially exactly like the recipe but instead of red pepper flakes I put a half t. of cayenne pepper. I also used bow tie pasta instead of penne because I had it on hand.

This was really good and easy to prepare. I followed the recipe exactly but next time I will cut down on the feta cheese maybe by half.  I enjoyed this the next day cold and it was still good.

This recipe was amazing! My boyfriend wanted to impress my parents by cooking dinner for them (he's a beginner) and he made this for my family last night. It was a huge hit! We added extra spinach, garlic, and onions--because I love them--and the feta cheese added all the flavor needed. The color also made for great presentation and his only regret was that he didn't have enough to bring home for his own mother to try out, haha.

This is an easy, nutritious, awesome-tasting dish to make!  We have already made it three times in the last month...it is definitely going on our regular rotation.  The only change I made was to omit the mushrooms as my family does not like them.  A keeper!

Wow was this yummy! Easy and delicious. My husband LOVED this and so did I!! The only changes I made were I used Italian seasoned diced tomatoes rather than roma tomatoes, I omitted the red pepper flakes (DH doesn't like spicy things), I used angel hair pasta instead of the pasta it recommends, and we added grated parmesan cheese on top! My husband said this was the best dinner he's had in a while - partially because all the vegetables make you feel good. Thanks so much for this!

Added feta and spinach chicken sausage, which added a delicious touch, and used crushed canned roma tomatoes since that's what I had at the moment.  Soooo yummy, it's hard not to have seconds.

I've made this dish several times (and just never got around to rating it, shame on me!) and I love it.  I use whole wheat pasta and also add shrimp to my dish for protein and it's yummy.  I made it for my family and they were quite impressed at how easy it was to make and how yummy it turned out.

This was delicious.  I used a bit of boursin cheese and a tad more feta than the recipe calls for, but it was fantastic.  It was a nice summery, not to heavy, lots of fresh veggies included, meal.

This recipe was delicious, the flavors were perfectly complimentary and the dish comes together quickly and easily.  Even though I used sprouted Ezekiel penne it still tasted delicious (and that pasta can have a pretty strong flavor). Thanks!

We really enjoyed this.  Like other reviewers, next time I'll add more than a pinch of red pepper flakes, more garlic, olives, basil or oregano and more spinach.  Hot or cold, this is a very nice dish.

Great dish!  Very flavorful.  I added Kalamata olives, as suggested by others, and a full bag of fresh spinch and it was great.  There are only two of us, so we have plenty of leftovers for today--and we're happy to eat it!  Delicious.

This recipe is a bit bland, if I make it again I will add fresh basil and more garlic and red pepper.  It is a relatively healthy pasta dish though.  It would make a nice Summer meal.  I think it would probably taste good cold too.

This has a really great flavor. I added some chicken as someone had suggested, and I used reduced fat feta to make it a tad healthier. The only thing I can say is that it was a little bit dry. I'm sort of a beginner cook, so I don't know the best way to fix that really. Maybe adding a little more olive oil. Either way, that's the only thing. Otherwise, good, good!!

This was an unexpected delight!  We added toasted pine nuts, browned Jennie-O hot italian sausages, taking them out of the casings, and LOTS of red pepper flakes.  Also used Rontoni wheat penne.  Thank you very much for this recipe.  It's a keeper!

love love love this recipe. always a hit, and much more colorful than these photos suggest. 

the only changes i make are adding quite a bit more crushed red pepper, garlic, and onion to the sauce. also, sometimes i microwave the fresh spinach first so it loses some of its size before adding it to the pan (it will wilt in the pan of course, but can be unweildy to add all at once).

Followed the recipe mostly- sauteed some shrimp with garlic and added them in at the end.  Used a can of diced tomatoes with green peppers and onions.  YUM!  Next time I'll use some kalamata olives and pine nuts. YUM!  Thanks!

So, so good.  The feta cheese was a nice alternative to tomato sauce as a pasta topping.

I was not expecting to like this as much as I did.  I chose it because it seems so healthy with all the veggies but the flavor is outstanding.  I think it is the feta-it can be so strong but it adds such great tang to this pasta!  I used a can of diced tomatoes and 1/2 package of frozen spinach in place of the fresh stuff.  My husband raved!  This is a definite keeper!!

This recipe was delicious, and I would make it again although with the many pasta dishes available, it simply  isn't a 5-star recipe.

This was just perfect for a Saturday afternoon late lunch for two with a bottle of Chardonnay!  I managed to scrounge around the house and find most of the ingredients, and had to use a few substitutions.  I only had frozen spinach and jarred diced tomatoes (Those DelMonte sliced or diced tomatoes in jars are wonderful).  I didn't have any feta cheese, but I had read a similar recipe that used blue cheese, which I served on the side as an optional topping.  I also had slivered roasted almonds and sliced kalamata olives(as recommended by others)on the side for toppings.  Thank you Suki!

Pretty good! I liked it, my husband didn't at first but it "grew" on him after a few bites. The only thing I didn't like was that the feta melted during the cooking process- I added some more crumbled feta on top (I like my feta)

excellent!!  but i would agree with other reviewers to double the amount of spinach and decrease the amount of feta (only used 6oz).  next time i'm going to use canned tomatoes in the actual cooking and for presentation purposes atop the pasta with wilted spinach, "real" cubed tomatoes, and sprinkle some cheese.

Delicious and very simple and fast for a week night.  I only had rigatoni on hand and used that.  I halved the recipe to serve two people and was afraid that it would not be enough but it was plenty for two of us - we actually have a bit left over and look forward to the leftovers.  Thanks submitter.

I changed the servings to make this recipe for 2 and it still seemed like a lot!  I used canned tomatoes also and used a whole 5 oz container of feta cheese.  Next time I will add twice as much mushrooms - my husband and I loved it!

This sounded much better than it was.  There wasn't enough spinach, even though I more than doubled the amount called for, and even with the red pepper and feta, it was bland.  It was okay, but not great, by any means.

Wonderful!  I doubled the spinach and could have used even more. I also added roasted red bell peppers and artichoke hearts. In my opinion, you can never have too much garlic. I had no chili flakes but used hot chili sauce in its place and it was divine. Easy and will make again and again.

Used more garlic and onion.  I agree more spinach could be used, like double.  This makes a huge batch, more like 8 servings, so use 1/2 the pasta if you don't want alot of leftovers. Everyone loved!

For my own personal taste, I left out the tomato.  Added a little milk to keep the dish from drying out.  Served with garlic chicken (from this site) and my guest enjoyed it.

What a great combination of flavors!  Suggestion: This recipe (minus the noodles) makes a fantastic topping for a veggie pizza!

Great! I used an extra cup of spinach, but next time will use even more. I used wheat pasta, and added some chopped kalamata olives. Yum!!

Lekker! (as they say here in the Netherlands).  This was great - hearty and healthy w/o being heavy.  As suggested, I increased the amount of spinach (200g) and decreased the amount of pasta (for 3 servings), and I used romano cheese instead.  I also used a 400g tin of Italian-seasoned tomatoes...plus added dried basil and oregano (seemed like the natural thing to do).  Definitely a keeper!

I scaled this down to one as it was just for my daughter although having read reviews I did use more spinach. She loved it. I used parmesan instead of feta (her choice) and spiral pasta. Quick easy meal for when I cant adapt what we're having for her. Will be making often. Thanks.

I was looking for something to make for dinner to use up some leftover spinach and mushrooms from yesterday's salad.  I had everything else except the fresh tomatoes, so I used 2 cans of drained diced tomatoes.  This recipe is incredibly easy and I was really surprised at how tasty it is.  I agree with other reviewers that it would be  great with shrimp.  I'm planning on making it this summer with fresh tomatoes too.  Great recipe!

I made this dish for company and all six of us loved it. Instead of adding feta to the sauce I grated parmesan cheese on it at the table, to make it lighter. I reccomend about a half cup of fresh herbs (I used oregano) to add depth. Reheated beautifully the next day.

I loved it. My wife thought that it lacked substance. Maybe I will use some strips of chicken, but in my opinion, it needed nothing. Awesome. It is the way that I rate all recipes, based on all whole are at the table.

Great dish!  I used 8 oz mozzarella cheese instead of the feta to make it more Italian.  Also used bow tie pasta.  This is a keeper!

Delicious! After browning the garlic/onion mix, I added the mushrooms and sauteed them before adding the tomatoes and spinach.  I added feta only to the portion I ate, and will add separately to leftovers. I also added extra spinach and tomatoes.

This was good, a little bland but good. Next time I'll spice it up a bit more. I used canned tomatoes and more like 4 cups of the spinach instead of the 2 called for in the recipe.

Adding shrimp or chicken to this recipe also creates great flavor.  Like others, I added more spinach, and it was wonderful.

I used a whole bag of baby spinach and added 1 diced zucchini for even more vegetables.  I also used canned, diced, drained tomatoes and only used 4 oz of basil garlic feta (which is the package size sold at my grocery store).  Very very good!

This sounds very similar to a recipe I make that calls for tomato, onion, garlic, fresh parsley and greek seasonings simmered, then throw in some shrimp and serve it over pasta with feta cheese and black olives (and more parsley) sprinkled on top.  I will try this, adding a liberal dose of greek seasonings, as we love that blend! And the spinach in it only adds to the goodness of this recipe.  Thanks!

Great pasta recipe! I  used canned diced tomatoes for extra flavor. Other than that, I followed the recipe using a a bag of fresh baby spinach and probably a little more than a pinch of red pepper. I have basil growing in my garden, and I threw in a few chopped leaves - great addition. I'll definitely be making this dish often at my house. Everyone loved it. YUMMMM!

I agree that it's a good base, but theres not a lot of flavor. Definitely recommend canned tomatoes and I think fresh spinach works better than frozen. The flavored tomatoes is a good idea, I just added basil and oregano myself and it helped a lot.

Great flavor.  I omitted the mushrooms and added extra spinach (since the spinach shrinks so much when it gets heated up).  I also added Italian turkey sausage as someone had recommended.  It was a hit.

This was pretty good, but I would add a lot more mushrooms and more red pepper flakes as well next time. I used canned diced tomatoes with garlic and olive oil; I think the recipe wouldn't have enough flavor for me otherwise. But it's so healthy and it's a nice change from my usual Prego :p Thanks for your recipe!

This was so delish and simple!  The only thing I changed was I used canned diced tomatoes flavored with basil and oregano and used 4 oz of plain feta cheese and 4 oz of tomato and basil feta cheese.  Yummmm.....

This is a quick, easy, and healthy meal!  I really enjoyed making it and eating it.  I used canned diced tomatoes - garlic and olive oil flavored - and it was excellent.  Next time I will add more spinach.  Yum!

This was really tasty -- by far the best Allrecipes recipe I've tried.  I used a can of diced tomatoes and frozen spinach and it turned out great.  Go easy on the red pepper flakes.

This was good, but not as flavorful as I had hoped.  I poured the mixture into a 13 x 9 pan since I had 40 minutes until dinner & I think this was a mistake.  I topped it with another 2 cups of spinach & probably 2 cups of shreaded mozzarella cheese before I baked it & this probably saved it.  I think I prefer to have my feta cheese sprinkled on top at the end so I get more flavor out of it.  It seems to loose its taste when I blend it in with pasta.  Good idea though.  The ingredients were great, I would just make as the recipe states next time & leave the feta out 'til the last.

It was so good! I like spicy so I added spicy sausages and diced canned tomatoes with jalapeno. I also took the suggestion from others and added a lot more ingredients like more onions, spinach, mushrooms and cooked the mushrooms for longer too. It was great and easy.

This was quite simple and very tasty.  I used whole wheat pasta and light feta to cut down on fat content.  My husband really enjoyed it.  Will make again.

FABULOUS!  I do not give a recipe 5 stars unless it truly deserves it... and this recipe does!!!  I was pregnant, and a VERY picky eater when I first made this recipe... I couldn't stop eating it!  I took it to my baby shower and everyone loved it too!  It's absolutely delicious and easy to make.  TIPS:
If you like super hot/spicy be liberal with the red pepper.  
I added about 3-4 cups of spinach because I felt once it reduced there wasn't enough.  

I highly recommend adding this recipe to your regular dinner menu!

This is one of our favorite recipes, we make it at least once a month.  We don't put in mushrooms, however.  It takes well to just throwing the ingredients in without measuring specifics.

Delicious combination of flavors. I used reduced-fat feta, and it didn't melt really well, but the flavors still blended nicely. We are on a low-carb diet, so we skipped the pasta and added a little turkey sausage.

Often I've tried internet recipes but have not been satisfied with the results. Not this time.  Both my wife and I could tell, after one bite, that this was a really delicious dish.  Basically easy to prepare, but the prep -- chopping the tomatoes, slicing the mushrooms, etc -- did take a bit more time than I thought it would.  (Doesn't it always, though?) Anyway, a terrific dish.  This one's a keeper.

My husband raved about this pasta dish! I omitted the mushrooms and added more fresh garlic. I was hesitant to add all 8 oz. of feta at first but went ahead anyway and I'm glad I did! It has a great Mediterannean flavor which my family loves.

Awesome! So light and delicate, and so beautiful to look at. I didn't have penne, so I used seashell instead. I also cut out the mushrooms. Next time, I might add a bit of lime juice and some pine nuts.

This is a truely wonderful pasta recipe. It is easy, quick and absolutely delicious. I'm not too fond of over creamy sauces on pasta so this one is perfect for me. Super as per recipe but also a good base for many alternatives.

Pretty good. Since I've never had feta before, I'm not sure I can rate this accurately. (The cheese was not my favorite part, but that's probably just my personal taste). I think I cooked the tomato part too long. But despite all this, it was a good dish. Tasty both hot and cold. My husband even liked it when he picked out the veggies. :o)

I wanted to give this a 4 1/2, but you can't rate it that way. Overall, it was quite delious, but you need to cook the spinach a little longer and make sure that you chop the spinach up but not too much.

I was a little unsure on this one but it turned out great.  I too added lots more spinach than it called for and it was perfect.  I think it was even better the next day!! Too many tomatoes for my taste though.  I'll definitely make it again and cut back on the tomatoes.  Yummy!

This is excellent and easy. I drained most of the liquid from the tomato/spinach mixture before adding the pasta and cheese and it was the perfect consistency. Will definitely make this again.

Delicious and easy to make!  I substituted squash for mushrooms and it worked fine, just make sure all the excess liquid is cooked off.  I also love spinach, so little more than 2 cups was very good.

This is one of the best vegetarian meals I have prepared.  It was definitely restaurant quality.  I plan to serve it the next time we have guests.  Thanks!

This is my new favorite pasta recipe-delicious! My only change was to add more spinach (at least 4 cups) but I love spinach.

This is the best pasta I have ever made.  I cooked it for my mother-in-law, who is an excellent cook and she was very impressed.  I have made it at least 3 times in the last month.  Thank you for this submission!!!!

The ONLY flaw in this wonderful recipe is not enough garlic! The feta wraps the whole dish together. Will definitely make this again.

Wonderful dish!  I was skeptical at first, but made it as it seemed easy, and the family loved it!  Fresh tasting, and great colors.

Wonderful meal. My husband loved it, even without the meat. I was short on feta cheese, so I poured in 1/2 cup mozzarella. And well-drained canned diced tomatoes work great, too. Bon appetite!

Oh, abosultely yummy! I've tried all sorts of variations with this recipe, skipping the mushrooms altogether, and it still tastes just as good. Chedder cheese works well instead of feta, for a change, though 8 ounces really is a bit much :)

This was absolutely delicious! My husband found it bland but I think I added too many mushrooms and I forgot the red pepper flakes.  I found to be a wonderful recipe and would definately make it when I have people over....

A very satisfying meal!
I did not add mushrooms, and only used 6 oz of feta cheese, and it was still a little
strong-flavored, but delicious.  I'll use less next time.

Very good pasta dish.  Reheatd the next day and added fresh feta for yummy leftovers.  Even my "plain only" pasta eater liked it.

I loved this dish. I wasn't sure what to think because it had no flavor at all until I put the feta cheese into it! Great taste!

This was a tasty and easy meal - my only complaint was that there was way too much feta cheese.  I would only use about half next time - the taste was much too strong (and I do love feta!).
