Very good! My family really liked this. I wouldn't change anything but I think the chicken needed longer to cook through. I also used this recipe for the traditional chili sauce to go with --Mix together for Chili Sauce 2 to 3 tbsp freshly squeezed lime or lemon juice, 5 tbsp finely chopped fresh red chilies, 5 cloves garlic, chopped, 3 tbsp finely chopped ginger, 1 tsp fine salt, 1/2 cup boiling hot chicken soup

Mmm, coming from a Singaporean I'd say this is almost like Singapore Chicken Rice but I prefer to use the boxed mix, lulz. But since I didn't try the chicken since having hear bad reviews about it, I only made the rice and I'd say to saute the ginger/garlic/onion, add in the broth, cieve it to remove chunks of ginger/garlic/onion

The rice turned out beautifully so fragrant and just how i remember it,note use fresh clear chiken stock if you can. The chicken on the other hand was a bit on the bland side so i would recommend increasing the herbs in the recipie here.

This was a wonderful dish and the leftovers made even more dinners. I used chopped chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken. I altered the recipe slightly, mixing all the ingredients together at the end to almost make a stew. The rice and chicken mixture was really good in tortillas that I rolled up and baked with mozzarella cheese on top. Overall, a very versatile meal that was a great base for other meals.

Love it! I did the exact same thing as noted in the recipe but added a bit more spice to the rice with a few dashes of garlic powder, pepper and red pepper flakes. I also added a bit more cilantro (1 cup instead of 1/2 cup as noted) and the taste was out of this world. This tastes exactly like the chicken rice you'd find from my home (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia).

I was really craving for Chicken Rice and I found this recipe. I tried it out and the rice turned out GREAT! My husband loved it. The chicken on the other hand, I agree with the earlier review that it is slightly bland if you use only the recipe required amount of spices. I would recommend increasing the spice amount for chicken and if you are adventurous enough add few more spices of your own! Overall, it was great.

This is fantastic, I had to make parts of it in advance, so I crisped up the chicken in a mix of canola and sesame oil...and I only used 2 breasts and 2 thighs or it would have been too much chicken for me...I will definately recommend this recipe and I'll make it again! Thanks for a great recipe!!

I loved the rice part of this recipe.  I make it on a regular basis... but I don't think the chicken was that great...  but the rice goes really well with other types of chicken.

Ooohh this was so good!!  The only thing I added was a bit of grated orange peel to the ginger, garlic, and green onion mixture that went into the chicken, and then I added the juice from the orange to the rice. I was thinking that next time I'll add even more orange, but it was really delicious!!

Okay, I missed the comment about serving with chili sauce as a condiment and suspected it might be served with one. I followed the recipe exactly, though, and it was very enjoyable on its own, easy, and healthy (even without any happy associations because, sadly, we've never been to Singapore). My husband agrees, so this is a new standard in my tried-and-true box. Thanks very much, Blubloth.

I guarantee that the readers who have not found the chicken delicious have used the wrong breed of chicken. Each breed has its own flavor and distinct qualities, so I suggest going to a poultry farm or Chinese market for options. The ideal breed (I believe) is called Chinese Cochin (Yellow-feather chicken); it has a wonderfully thick, yellow and chewy skin and less breast-meat than most types found in American grocers (which are broilers and cornish game hens). Broiler chickens are no good because they are bred for meat-- their skin is thin and has less flavor. I highly recommend readers to choose the right chicken as a first priority. Enjoy!
