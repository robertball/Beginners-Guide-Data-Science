This was good. A little variation though would be to bring to a boil a can of Italian Recipe Chicken Stock add pastini (wonderful!) and then when returns to soft boil break an egg into this mixture and stir to have strings of egg throughout the soup. This is an excellent feel better soup great for when you have a cold and it will chase it away! Enjoy!

Fantastic!  I don't know if it helps since the pasta is tough to find,  but I work stocking wegmans stores and its how I discovered pastini.  If you have a wegmans nearby they should have it.  Since it was the first time seeing the pasta I came hear to find a recipe for it and found this soup.... So glad I did
