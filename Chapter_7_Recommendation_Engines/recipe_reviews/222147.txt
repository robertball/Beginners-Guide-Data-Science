I rated the custom version instead of the published version--whoops! I cut this recipe back by half to 16 servings and made muffins instead of one big loaf. I made this with melted margerine instead of butter and pecans instead of walnuts, I made no other changes. I did bake my muffins at 350*, they were done at exactly 20 minutes. My kids and I thought this was one of the better banana breads we've ever had. The sprinkling of cinnamon sugar on the outside was the best part.

Wow - this this healthier version even got my husband's approval! I cut this recipe in half and used two eggs. This was also a great way to use up some very ripe bananas. It came out moist, sweet and delicious - you really don't know it's low in fat. I sprayed a 9x5 baking pan with Pam for baking and then did the cinnamon-sugar dusting. I baked  at 350 for a little over an hour - YUM!

Awesome Recipe! I had a bunch of browning bananas and looked everywhere for the PERFECT banana bread recipe. I finally settled on this one, because who wouldn't want the healthier version? Anyway, I did make a couple of alterations to make it even healthier by using organic pure cane sugar instead of white sugar, egg replacer, and earth balance instead of butter. I was nervous that it wouldn't bake properly, especially with the egg replacer, but everything came out delicious and creamy thanks to the sour cream. 

This recipe also makes a ton of bread. I ended up making 4 mini loaves (~5x3 in disposable pans) AND about 20 muffins. The loaves took about 1 hr 10 mins to bake and the muffins took just about 40-45 minutes. All in all, I will definitely come back to this recipe when I have some end-of-road bananas that need using. RECOMMENDED!

I think this turned out JUST as good as full fat versions of banana bread I've tried before. I made a half recipe, used half vanilla yogurt, half sour cream, and I didn't have enough regular flour so I filled in the rest with more white wheat flour. I expected it to be a bit heavy that way, but it was moist and yummy anyway! Baked for 45-50 min instead of an hour. I will be making this one again.

I made this bread exactly as the recipe directed, choosing not to add nuts, and it is delicious!! Not too sweet, great texture. I made 2 loafs and 12 large muffins. Muffins took 45 min exactly at 300 on convection and just to note, everything rises significantly so leave room:)

I just made it exactly to her adjustments, WOW so good! Healthier and tastes as good as the original! I recommend stirring the wet ingredients in with the flour -creates a denser bread :) yum!

Tastes pretty good for healthy bread, however there is way too much cinnamon and it overpowers the banana flavor. This is more like spice cake than banana bread. Ill use the substitutions in a different recipe.

I made 1/2 a recipe.  I used only 1 egg and used half vanilla yogurts/half fat free sour cream.  I only had all purpose flour so I stuck with that.  It was amazing .  My kids are choosy with muffins and breads....this was gone immediately!

I made this into Muffins. I was in the  middle of making this recipe and realized one of my bananas had gone bad. So I used 2 overripe bananas, and 1/2 a cup of applesauce to replace the third. The batter looked sort of light (may have been the missing banana) so I added in a few dashes of Pumpkin Pie Spice. Oh, I didn't add in any nuts. They still turned out good! I plan on making these again with the 3 whole bananas and I will edit my review. I wanted to review anyway since there weren't many reviews so far. Thanks for submitting, I love finding healthier versions of recipes!!!

It needs more sugar. It tasted like cardboard at the first bite. I kinda got used to it but the kids did not like it. Even with the cinnamon/sugar sprinkles on the bottom and on the top. I made mini muffin and baked for 20 min. Very moist but very grainy and not much taste. I even added a 4th banana (half the recipe).

I cut the recipe in half, used oat flour instead of wheat flour, gluten free all purpose flour, 2 eggs (instead of 1 1/2), fat free sour cream, coconut sugar, grapeseed oil instead of butter, and sprinkled a mixture of cinnamon, coconut sugar, grapeseed oil, oats and gluten free flour on top.  Plain yogurt can also be used instead of the sour cream to make it even healthier.  Thank you for the recipe!

A good banana bread with less guilt than the usual. It does make a heartier loaf that is nice and moist.  I added cinnamon crunch topping - 1/2 c. sugar, 2 Tbsp. sugar, 3 Tbsp. butter and 1 tsp. cinnamon.  This adds a sweet crunch, good for pound cakes, too.

I made it with honey instead of sugar. I used 1 cup of honey and then 3/4 tsp of salt and 3 1/2 tsp of baking soda.  (Next time I will just try 3 tsp of baking soda)  I used 2 cups of greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  It turned out delicious!

I loved this recipe. However, I felt the bread itself lacked a little favor, so I added a homemade cinnamon and sugar crumble to put on top. First time making it, and will definitely make again
