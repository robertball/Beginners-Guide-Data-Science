We sauteed the scallops with the mushroomsinstead of broiling them, but besides that followed the recipe.  Wonderful, restaurant quality recipe.  Will make again

We loved this. I also added chopped onion and squeezed the juice of one lemon for citrus. Poured it over rotini and added Parmesan. Delicious. .

This was amazing! We did not have any chanterelles on hand they were not in season. I bought oyster mushrooms instead. Everything else was true to the recipe. I used a beautiful heirloom tomato. I served with mashed baby Yukon Gold Potatoes with minced scallions mashed in. It was perfect! So glad I stayed true! I almost skipped the potatoes and went with asparagus. My husband and I were both wowed by this recipe! I may use half xvoo instead of all the butter next time just to see if itâ€™s as good and healthier but really this was worth the calories!

"Amazing", said the teen son and husband! We added white wine and garlic to the browned butter and simmered a bit before pouring over the pasta.

OMG is all I can say about this recipe!!!! I could not find Chantrelle mushrooms so I used baby bellas.  I am on a very strict diet and cannot have a lot of fat or tomatoes so I browned the butter and dragged the broiled scallops through the butter/vinegar but did not pour it over the mushrooms as the recipe directed.  Still... This is my favorite scallop recipe I have made thus far!

Great combo of  mushrooms and scallops. I have been making the two together forever. This is a nice recipe I will make again. Be careful not to overcook the Chanterelles like I think I did, they became a little tough.

tried this last night with white chantrelles, but didn't have scallops yet had halibut in the freezer. I would recommend it! quick and uber-tasty. I did add a few things: a small amount of chopped onions and a 1/2 cup or so of chopped spinach with the tomatoes, and then salt and pepper to taste.

I served it over parsley rice but it would be good over pasta as well.
