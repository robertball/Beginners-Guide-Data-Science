If I wasn't married I would be standing up holding a poster board that said Chef John Marry Me!!  These were fantastic beans.  Not baked beans, not pinto beans, not any kind of beans I've had before ...different yummy beans.  YAY! go Chef John go...right now I'm your biggest fan.

.Very good starter. We just like more spice. We found it was just a nice tomato flavour. After sampling the way it was intended I tweaked it.  I added 1 tblsp of liquid smoke and a tblsp of ancho chili peppers. Next time I will probably double both of these. I will make it again. Thank you

The flavor of these beans was great! I did make a couple changes - I used two cans of pinto beans, drained and rinsed, instead of the dried beans. I also skipped the mustard, but added a little tomato paste at the end to thicken the sauce a bit. The chipotle powder adds a nice heat to these!

These beans are fantastic!  I doubled the recipe for a barbeque picnic and used half black beans and half pink beans.  I prepared the dry beans and sauce as recipe directs, and then used a crock pot on low for 4 hours for the last step (this made it easy to serve them hot for a group). They were perfect with smoked brisket and a salad with cilantro-lime sauce.

My previous attempts at cooking beans have been less than spectacular.
I have made this recipe several times with amazing results.  I recommend this recipe for any summer social gathering.  Sometimes I cook thie recipe on a Sunday to enjoy the rest of the week.

Being from the central coast of CA, these beans are at every BBQ. And i am so glad to make them at home now, and this recipe is great, just perfect, and thanks for the recipe.

I have lived in Ca all my life.  I have been on countless trips to the central coast (Nipomo, Arroyo Grande, Santa Maria, and Pismo Beach.)  These beans are not an acceptable representation of the beans from that area.

OMG OMG OMG OMG! I've had plenty of Santa Maria BBQ, but the beans were never much to write home about. This time, I was making the tri tip and needed the beans to go with it. I followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT that I made my beans in the pressure cooker, no soaking in advance. The sauce I made the same (though I did use smoked paprika instead of regular). UNBELIEVABLY good! Had to order more pinquito beans just so I could makes sure to have them on deck at all times!

We made this recipe for 24 servings...  Luckily, we made it a day early figuring they're always better the second day.   It worked!  We split it into 2 crock pots, and added jalape√±os to one batch.  The second day I added an extra (6 servings) cup of the sauce, and both pots came out to rave reviews.

I made the recipe as it was given.  We liked the beans very much and thought the spices were just right for our taste.  This recipe will be made again soon.

I made this recipe as written. I found the "juice" to be too sweet and not savory enough for our taste. I ended up doubling salt and seasonings. I also added two shakes each of soy sauce and worcestershire sauce and nearly a tablespoon of ground black pepper. It was an improvement, however does not taste like authentic Santa Maria pinquito beans (I am a native of the immediate area). Great start, just not close enough for me.

I think these are the best beans I ever made. Used Rio Zappo beans from Rancho Gordo. I used 6 cloves garlic, no salt,2 tbsp tomato paste and only 1 tsp sugar. I also used smoked paprika and 1/2 small chopped onion. Totally delicious

These were very good but my family asked they be made without the sugar. I added tomato pur√©e for moisture. I used the correct amount of sugar but they were sweet.

This is so good! I used peppered jowl and no ham because I didn‚Äôt have any. I will remember to reserve and freeze some during the holiday season so I can add it the next time I make it. It is super easy to make and worthy enough to use with my heirloom beans from Rancho Gordo.

I've made these beans many times and they are fantastic!  If you make them according to the recipe you won't be disappointed.  However, I've made some modifications that my family and friends really like:  use bacon ends, cut them in chunks, and cook just before they get crispy; add a can of Rotel; and add some type of minced pepper when in season or use red pepper flakes.  I also cook the day before and simmer for a 3-4 hours.  Refrigerate overnight.  Heat up the next day and serve.

Only needed 1/2 T sugar; other than that, I made as directed. I put the beans in the bacon pan to get the extra flavor from the drippings - really good with bread.

Tasty for sure, but a bit heavy on the meat for my taste.  Next time I will use either ham or bacon but not both.

This is a keepa!  Thanks for a fabulous, EASY, bean recipe.  I did use tomato paste as opposed to ketchup...salt issue in family and this was still great.
