Not a bad basic cake recipe.  Make sure not to use corn starch in place of corn flour.  Corn flour is different from corn starch and will yield different results.

I made this cake exactly to the recipe.  The ingredients list "corn flour", but I assumed it meant cornstarch as the directions say mix flour and cornstarch together.  I don't get the 2 cups of cornstarch. This did not even taste like cake.  I am not sure what it tasted like.  The cake was extremely dense and heavy.

WHEN I MADE THIS CAKE I CHANGED IT. THE CORN FLOUR/STARCH PART WAS CONFUSING. I USED 2 TBLS CORN STARCH AND INSTEAD OF 2 CUP OF WHITE SUGAR USED 1 2/3 C. WHITE SUGAR AND 1/3C. BROWN SUGAR. AT THE END ADDED CINNAMON AND 1 DRAINED CAN OF FRUIT COCKTAIL. GOOD FLAVOR BUT A VERY HEAVY CAKE, SOMEWHAT LIKE A POUND CAKE.
