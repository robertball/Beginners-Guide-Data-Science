A delicious healthy salad! Just enough heat and tons of flavor.  I used a flat iron steak instead of flank steak, because that is what I had on hand.  Also put the oil into the marinade and then grilled the steak on my gas grill, instead of cooking stove top.  Use reduced fat Mexican blend cheese and made a chipotle cream to drizzle on top with reduced fat sour cream, some milk, and a little of the HerdezÂ® chipotle cooking sauce.  Thanks for this great recipe!
