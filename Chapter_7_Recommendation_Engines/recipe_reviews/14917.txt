All my guests loved this recipe, i could not get them out of the oven quick enough.  The recipe calls for 4 cups of cheese, I only used 2 cups and it worked out fine.

We make a similar recipe every New Year's Eve, but we use Swiss cheese instead of cheddar, and we don't use bacon bits. I have a good tip for making these even better.  The big complaint we used to get was how soggy they are.  If you first toast your cocktail rye bread before putting the mixture on, that will make them less soggy.  You can even toast them up hours before needing them.  Just keep the toasted rye bread slices in a zip top bag until you need them!

My husband DID love this recipe! I put it on English muffins and baked them for about 15 minutes. I crumbled up some leftover bacon from breakfast and used a little more mayo. I used some dill cheddar cheese that I found at the farmer's market. As Rachael would say, it was CRAZY good!

These aren't my personal favorite, but the guys sure do love them.  These are requested frequently.

Very similar to what my husband's NaNa made and everyone gobbled up----we add 1-2 tsp. of Carroway seeds to give it a bit more flavor. It's a tried and true favorite.

The guys did go crazy over these, but the girls didn't complain about them.  Just a weird phenomenon with the guys - who knew?!  I made the cheese mixture a day early and put it in the fridge - for easy prep on the day of the party.  Had some cheese mixture left over and made AWESOME chili nachos with it.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

These rye rounds were great.  I didn't measure any think, but I think it would be pretty hard to ruin.  I used just enough mayo to get everything to stick together.  Everyone loved them. I followed another reviewers suggestion to toast the bread first.  It worked great.  We ate them with homemade tomato soup.  A keeper!

I thought I had bacon bits, but when I got ready to make the recipe.....I discovered I did not. I made it anyway, and it was great! I can only imagine how good it would be if I had the bacon in it!

We've had a similar recipe in our family for years.  We don't put the bacon in the cheese mixture, we sprinkle it on top. We also bake at 350 degrees for 10-15 minutes. The bacon becomes crispy not greasy.

These were just ok. Yeah, the men liked them, but didn't go crazy for them. Way too much cheddar cheese. After broiling these they were also very greasy, not crispy. I might make again, I don't know. Nothing to write home about.

I have been making this recipe for over 15 years. The only problem is since I moved to Texas I can't find the cocktail bread- only at xmas time at a bigger HEB. I had to take rye bread and use by biscuit cutter to make them look uniformed. I don't usually add onion but I use onion powder to keep the flavor similar.

I love this recipe!!  My husband's family introduced me to this recipe, though it's slightly different from the one here.  We use green onions and always, always real bacon that is cut into pieces, NOT bacon bits.  I make it for New Year's Eve...I'm just about to make it now!
