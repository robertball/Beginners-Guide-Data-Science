This is a perfect cookie for me. Not to sweet and since I'm a dunker I was glad it was a little drier, held up in my coffee. These do not spread which make them a thicker cookie, another plus for me. I did not add the coconut because I was out. I did add 1 tsp vanilla.  Cooking temp and time is spot on. Thanks for the recipe cheerios!

I wanted to make these cookies, because I loved the sound of all the ingredients together!! I mean coconut, oats, peanut butter and chocolate-omg!!! I read all the reviews, some said the cookies were dry so I added some vanilla ( 2 teaspoons) as suggested. Even with the vanilla, they were a tad dry and not as flavorful as I like a cookie to be. My husband thinks if more peanut butter was added they would be more flavorful. They were tasty but just not amazing.
Edit: Ok so I put the cookies in a tupperware container last night and ate one for breakfast lol. For some reason they dont taste dry anymore and are almost a little moist. They are perfect & taste SO much better today!!

These were tasty.  I added the coconut, oats and chocolate chips to the dry ingredients and folded everything together, with ease. I did add 2 Tablespoons of Vanilla (yes 2 tablespoons). I would have given the recipe a 5, however as written they would be on the dry side. I will be making these again with the addition of vanilla. Thanks Cheerios for this tasty treat! UPDATE: almost 12 hours of them being made..and stored in an airtight container: ive noticed they have gotten even more dry..even after my addition of the 2 tbl of vanilla.. This recipe needs more moisture..so in addition the vanilla..and few tablespoons of water(when cooking with oats), or milk should help. I like the idea of flavors in this cookie..but even more butter 3/4-1 cup would do the trick with that amount of dry ingredients.

I didn't flatten my cookies and they turned out fine.  I will add some flavoring next time.  Maybe some vanilla and spices.  Good cookie overall!

This was a very flavorful cookie!  It did take some time to incorporate all the oats into the dough and I ended up using my hands to mix everything together.   The cookie does not expand very much in the oven, so, if you want a larger cookie make the dough balls bigger.  Mine were a little smaller than I would have liked.  Based on the other reviewer's post that the cookies were a little dry I took mine out of the oven a little earlier and they were crunchy on the outside and softer on the inside.  They are definitely more like a peanut butter cookie instead of a chewy oatmeal cookie.
