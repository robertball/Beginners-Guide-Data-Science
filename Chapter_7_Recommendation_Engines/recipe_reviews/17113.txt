Judging from the reviews, I knew this recipe needed a lot of tweaking. So here's what I did: I soaked the oats in the milk for about 30 minutes so the oats wouldn't absorb the liquid in the batter and make the muffins dry. I used 2 tb applesauce and 2 tb oil instead of the full 1/4 c to make them extra moist, and added 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. Once I mixed up the batter it was very stiff do I added 1/4 c water to it. These came out nice and moist with a slightly dense, chewy texture and light chocolate flavor which I liked a lot. If you want more chocolate flavor though, you should probably double the amount of cocoa powder and increase the sugar to maybe about 3/4 c. This was a really nice concept for a recipe.

These muffins were ok. I changed a few things and I think it made them better.
I substituted butter for oil and I also added 1/4 cup of Brown Sugar. Also Cinnamon and Vanilla really gave them a kick.

After reading other reviews, I started out by putting the oats in 1/2c milk to soak while working on the first section of the recipe. Due to inattention, I forgot to subtract this 1/2c milk from the later milk added, and this turned out to be a good mistake. The muffins were about the right dampness. 

For the 1/2c oat-soaking, I used vanilla soy milk, then switched over to my roommate's regular milk. 

My main issue with the muffins is they seem to suffer from some sort of flavor personality disorder with the cocoa/raisins. 
Here is what I plan on doing next time:
- throwing a few handfuls of chocolate chips in with the raisins.
- soaking the oats in slightly more milk.
- substituting in some apple sauce, as recommended in another review.

I could see these being pretty successful chocolate-chocolate-chip-oatmeal muffins. I wouldn't bake them the same way next time.

These muffins were really yummy, and easy to make.
Just the right amount of chocolate flavour.
They sure don't last long, even with the double batch
I made.

I was excited to find this recipe because my daughter wanted to make chocolate muffins and I wanted to make something "healthy" so I thought this would be a good compromise. I made the recipe before reading the reviews. I followed the recipe (though I beat the egg separately before adding in) and they came out moist, but still had a "dry" taste, like they  needed more sugar and/or more cocoa. They weren't quite chocolately enough. Maybe vanilla would have helped, as someone mentioned. I'd like to try again, but I don't think my daugther will eat them.

Overall, these are pretty good muffins.  After reading the other reviews, I did make some changes.  I used 3/4 cup all-purpose flour (minus 2 tablespoons) and 3/4 cup whole wheat flour, and  I doubled the cocoa powder (which is why I reduced the flour by 2 tablespoons).  I used quick cooking oats instead of regular oats, 1/2 cup raisins, and 1/2 cup bittersweet chocolate chips.  I also used skim milk, and omitted the oil, instead using 1/2 cup applesauce, which seemed to make the batter the right kind of consistency (as I was adding the wet ingredients, I could see what others meant about the batter being too thick if you stick to the amount of liquid used in the original recipe).  The muffins came out of the oven moist, with a slightly crusty top, and are quite tasty.

followed previous suggestions, my batter came out so thick I thought I had screwed up somehow! I added 1/4 c of milk and that seemed to make it work better. nice muffin. I tossed in some flax meal for the heck of it and it's not bad at all.   Previous adjustments listed were to: 1) soak the oats in the milk for about 30 minutes prior. 2) add extra water (or milk) if batter is too thick.   someone else added applesauce instead of oil and said that was nice too. I'll try that next time. Great muffin though!

I omitted the raisins & used Ovaltine chocolate milk mix instead of cocoa (adds a little more sweetness & vitamins!). I also substituted applesauce for the oil (lower cal & fat). Tasted great, you'd never know they were healthier than normal! Thanks!

I followed other reviewers' suggestions and added 1/4 c. of brown sugar. I also sprinkled sugar on the tops of these. There's just something weird about the oatmeal with the chocolate. I think these are OK, but I don't think I'll be making them again.

These muffins were soooooo delicious. Sometimes you don't have some of the ingredients but your too lazy to go to the store. I'm not saying you need to use my alterations, but this makes the recipe a lot easier. Instead of the rolled oats, i used instant oatmeal. There is no need to soak them first, I didn't add the raisins, and instead of milk I used water. Using milk would make it taste a little better but sometimes there come those days where you are lazy and you feel like making these muffins. DO NOT..I repeat DO NOT EAT THESE THE SAME DAY YOU BAKED THEM. THEY ARE 10,00000 TIMES BETTER THE DAY AFTER OR LATER.

These were tasty and fast to make.  To the newbies that are just introducing yourself to baking.  Do NOT overwork the dough as stated in the recipe.  I cooked my raisins before integrating them into the dough along with the liquid they cooked in.  Didn't have milk or eggs so substituted mayonnaise.  AWESOME!  Made them moist and light.  Added a tsp. of cinnamon and just gave it that added "kick"  I will be making these again.  It's a keeper.

I thought these muffins were pretty tasty!  They did  not come out dry (like some of the other reviews mentioned).  The only changes I made was that I doubled the amount of cocoa powder (using 4 tablespoons instead of two) and omitted the raisins.  Kids loved them for breakfast!  Would definitely make them again.

Made these today. They came out pretty good but I added some dried cherries to go with the raisins. They came out very well, but I recommend it with lots of dried fruits. It really helps make these pop with flavor.

No problems with the consistency of batter, but overall taste was boringly bland.  More... salt? spices? molasses? something.  Won't make these again.

Taking a cue from other reviewers, I soaked the oats in milk prior to adding them to the other ingredients. I did not have to add any water to the batter-the batter was very thin. I added vanilla and cinnamon to the recipe. The muffins turned out well--they had a mild chocolate flavor. Next time I would omit the raisins and add chocolate chips instead to boost the chocolate flavor.

This is a good recipe but I would like to add a few revisions of my own.  1) Use quick cook oats not large flake oats. 2) Add 1/2 cup of apple sauce, sweetness and moisture without the processed sugar and it won't change the flavour. 3) Try changing the raisons by using saltana rather then golden. They have a stronger flavour.

I tried making these for a tailgate, and they needed a lot more flavor.  Next time I would double the cocoa and put in at least a half cup of sugar.  Very quick and easy to make.

Instead of raisins, I just made chocolate oatmeal muffins. My friends loved them. I like that they are healthier and more filling than regular chocolate muffins. They were great with ice cream and fruit for a cakey dessert too!

They weren't too bad.  If I made them again, I'd add more sugar.
