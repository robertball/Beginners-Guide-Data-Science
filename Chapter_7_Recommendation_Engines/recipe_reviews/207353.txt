This is my recipe. The dough can sometimes be testy so if it get too soft, pop it in the fridge for a few minutes but don't leave it in too long. Too long and you won't be able to get it pressed!

I made these with spelt flour instead of all purpose flour.  Maybe that is why they were crumbly and dry.I would prefer to taste my potatoes baked or mashed; in cookies, I didn't care for the taste!
