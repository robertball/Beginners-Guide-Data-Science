I made my first cushaw pie today. This recipe called for 2 pies  but it ended up making 5. Not sure why so many but they are good. I'm taking some to a picnic tomorrow and taking the rest to a local soup kitchen. I'm sure they will enjoy it. Thank you for this healthy, tasty pie recipe.

This has replaced the Thanksgiving pumpkin pie in our house and is so much better. I find the traditional pumpkin pie too dense and sweet. To be fair if you look at a can of pumpkin, it’s actually more squash anyway. This is so much lighter in texture and not overly sweet. To put the portions in perspective, 1/2 this recipe with 3 cups of cushaw purée and you get 2 pies. I took a couple of tips from another cushaw pie recipe which said to roast the cushaw for an hour in a 350 oven and then peel off the skin. Either way, cushaw holds a lot of liquid so cook the day ahead and put in a colander over a catch bowl to drain the water. Even with this I still squeezed excess water out with a dish towel. I recommend this so the pie isn’t too watery. I did add a bit of white sugar (just a couple of tablespoons) for a bit more sweetness but also a bit of lemon extract too. Added a dollop of fresh whip cream when served.

I made a grape-nuts crust with about 1.5 cups of cereal and milk. Forms well after the milk gets soaked in. I ended up with 4 pies instead of 2 so I suggest you lower the servings to adjust. One cushaw was close to 12 cups so I vacuum sealed the rest to use later.
