i didn't make any changes but i will say it is very sweet. maybe the sugar could be cut back or just serve smaller pieces.

Great recipe! My family loved it. I bought semi sweet chocolate by mistake and just reduced sugar to 1/2 cup. May double the recipe for fuller pie but loved it!

This recipe is Excellent for Two main reasons.. because it tastes good and because it's Super Easy! The only change I made was to add chocolate shavings to the top for presentation. If you really want to kick the recipe up, add finely chopped pecan pieces to your Graham cracker crust.. That's what Copeland's does to all of their cheesecakes. That extra element of nutty flavor kicks everything up a notch.

Spectacular taste and fairly simple to make (as long as you have a stand mixer).  I'd recommend making the crust and the whipped cream, but loved the silky chocolate filling.  Family LOVED it - will be making a 2nd pie tonight.

I made this for Thanksgiving Only change was I doubled the recipe.. a huge hit especially with the young crowd. My nephew dubbed it his new favorite, booting my banana cupcakes to second. I topped it  with fresh whipped cream and dusted cocoa, delicious and pretty!!
