WOW!  Just bought an antique stove, but it wasn't installed for Thanksgiving.  So for the holiday dessert, we decided to try a couple no-bake pies.  This pumpkin pie is absolutely delicious.  You wouldn't know it wasn't baked judging by it's taste and consistency; in fact this was superior.  And I've baked a lot of pumpkin pies! I won't bake a pumpkin pie again, as this pie was creamier, filled the pie crust better, and in fact was easier to prepare.  I usually add more spices than recipes call for, but this recipe was just right, nice and spicy. Thank you Cathy.

I personally judge foods and other things very critically, but I think this recipe kind of made me feel so much better. This was the first pie I've ever made, and no bake, it's so great! I made this for Thanksgiving the other day, and it was truly an absolute HIT! The only odd thing that occurred while heating the filling part/egg spice and milk mixture was that for some reason the eggs seemed to almost scramble.. into little bits. But it was primarily because the heat was set on medium--you should really stir the eggs in slowly while the mixture begins to heat, on low, and then add the spices, and pumpkin last, with the heat off, stirring after about 15-20 minutes, constantly, on low. This is only for pure perfection. I just love this pie, and I would definitely make it again, and again, for anything! Not too sweet, but not to pumpkinny, it's just right! The crust is amazing, if you use a graham cracker one. Delish!

After Halloween, I cooked and pureed our pumpkin...had lots of extra to try some new recipes with.  I used 1 3/4 cup pureed pumpkin and used 2 teaspoon of Pumpkin Pie Spice.  The pie was so quick and easy....and tasted fantastic.  So easy and delicious I think I would make this one EVERY year.  My husband said it tasted buttery....thank you for sharing!

This pie was AWESOME! So much creamier than the traditional baked and all the flavor. The only change I made was to use a ready-made shortbread crust. I also realized last second I had no nutmeg or ginger, or even pumpkin pie spice - if the same happens to you in a pinch, I doubled the cinnamon and added a splash of vanilla extract and it turned out great.

Yum!  I made this for Thanksgiving last year and forgot to rate it.  When I told my husband that I was going to make it again (now that it's pumpkin season) his eyes lit up! :)  Delicious, good flavor even with lighter ingredients.  I make it with fat free sweetened condensed milk, egg whites or egg substitute, and reduced fat graham cracker crust (when I can find it) - thanks for this great recipe!

I had made this recipe a few Thanksgivings ago and every year after my kids asked for it but I had lost the recipe. This sounded familiar so I tried it and the kids told me this was the one. What I do is pour this into 12 small graham tartlets by Keebler and then top with mini marshmallows. The flavor is so nice and creamy! I will not lose this recipe again!!!!!

How can you say "WOW!!" and get enough meaning in it? It was so VERY good and took down my Thanksgiving baking stress a few notches. THANK YOU. Note: this recipes can be used with the regular easy pie crust (located on this site). I didn't have a cracker crust available & didn't want to go to the store. It turned out awesome! I don't know if I'll ever go back to baked pumpkin pie.

Agree with other boardmates, it's so great and can be finished in 5 min.

Personally, I found that it's to sweet for me, suggest other boardmates to reduce the use of sweet condensed milk.

Loved this pie and so did everyone else. It really was pretty simple to make. Doubt that I will be baking a traditional pie again. Some suggestions: Use a whisk to blend the eggs well and then combine with other ingredients before cooking on the stove top. Continue to use the whisk while cooking. I found the mixture tended to get thinner at first and slowly thickened. I cooked mine on med-low heat until the consistency of thick gravy...and on my stove that took about 12 min.  CHANGES: took another reviewer's idea and used 2 tsp of Pumpkin Pie Spice instead of Ginger, Cinnamon, and Nutmeg...too lazy and busy on Thanksgiving Day. Thanks!

okay.. right.. so I follow the recipe with one change.. My family likes their pumpkin pies more vanilla than spicy.. so i only used 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and added vanilla.. only thing i changed.. recipe said to chill 3 hours.. after 4 1/2 hours my pie was pudding (which my husband ate and liked).. I thought OMG what did I mess up?? I didn't because it just needed till the next day to set up..  so if you follow the recipe time line and you have pudding.... stick it back in the fridge and have faith.......... I will make again.. Husband loved it.. would like to try traditional crust.. I know that takes away a little of the ease of this recipe but you can bake your storebought crust while you thicken your filling.... thanks.........

What a great pie!  Could not tell it was a no bake.  Instead of 2 eggs I used 6 tbsp of egg whites(it set perfect) and I used low fat condensed milk and it turned out great.

WOW!!  This was amazing!  I took it to our Thanskgiving dinner and it went down a treat!  I used 2&1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice, as another reviewer suggested.  Also, I needed to turn the heat up from low and almost brought the mixture to a boil to ensure it would set (otherwise I would have been there all day!)  Thanks - I will definitely make this again.

I have not baked a pie from scratch before, and I had no time to use an oven. I found this recipe on this site, and decided to try it for my Halloween Party in my local Ballroom. I had been asked to bring a dessert, I made two, for trial and error purposes, and they both came out beautiful, and delicious! I would recommend this to a beginner like myself, and even to the seasoned baker!

absolute perfection! I used a nilla wafer crust (delicious), low-fat sweetened condense milk, 1 egg with 1 egg white. The consistency of the pie was perfect, the right blend of pumpkin and sweetness. I think next time I will buy a regular pie crust and blind cook it in the oven. Addendum 9/10/2010: STILL my favorite pumpkin pie, I am convinced the stove top method is why those pumpkin pies from Wholesale clubs are soooo creamy. I still blind cook my shell while stirring on the stove top,  then I pour mix into shell and bake for 15-20 minutes more. Then refrigerate. PERFECTION every time!

This was so delicious! I made a gingersnap crust for this pie and mixed in a cup of apple butter in place of some of the condensed milk. It was a huge hit at my family's Thanksgiving this year -- I won't use any other pumpkin pie recipes after this one!

My brother loves this pie so much I have to make it each time he visits me, which isn't a problem b/c it's so easy to make.  I didn't have a Graham cracker crust so arbitrarily used a chocolate Graham crust and he loved it.  He's requesting it again for Thanksgiving. So now I make two; one just for him.  One of my family's favourites.

have baked pumpkin pies before, and liked what i've made. I've never tried a no bake pumpkin though. and never ever cooked with gelatin. sadly, the lack of experience with gelatin bit me. i dont think it set well enough and my pie turned out a bit.. runny/sticky-ish. the flavor is good, the consistency not. tastes really good frozen and with icecream. yum

This is a really good easy to make pie. It taste delicious. My thing is that it's super rich almost too rich. Maybe next time I won't put a whole can of condensed milk in. I also had a little too much mix for 1 9inch shell. Over all it is a good pie.

Great IF you use half the ginger (1/4tsp), otherwise the ginger is overpowering. It also turns out great if you replace the cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg with 1 Tbsp pumpkin pie spice.

My family was very skeptical about this pie, but it was a HUGE hit and was eaten faster than the traditional pie I made.  I made a gingersnap crust for it instead of graham cracker, which was perfect.  I'm definitely planning to make it again this year.

Ok, to be fair, I have not actually tasted this pie yet, I made it just yesterday for a family get-together today. But it smells SO good! And I did taste the filling. AMAZING! And super easy to make, I'm not much of a pie maker, but I can see myself making this recipe again and again. I will update with the reaction of my family later, but I can already guess they will be mega-impressed. Just for the record though, I made this in Canada, so the references for the "1 can of" is a little misleading and required some extra calculation on my part. I wish the recipe was written in more universal terms, like cups, teaspoon, etc.  In Canada, for the Eagle brand condensed milk, I used 1 full can (300ml) and about a 3rd of another can, which is about 1 3/4 cups. For the pumpkin puree, I used about 2 cups (there's about 3 1/2 cups in the bigger can). And for the gelatin, one packet in Canada is 15 ml, which is .5 oz, so I only used half a pack, to get the .25 oz, or 7.5 ml. Also make sure you get the pumpkin puree, I almost picked up pumpkin pie filling. Also, I got 1 graham cracker crust and accidentally got 1 shortbread crust. Whoops. We'll see how it turns out.

Turned out great - I prefer a spicier pumpkin pie so I made one as written and then one with additional spices (clove specifically & bumped up the other spices to about 3/4 tsp) - both were great. Thanks!

Great pumpkin pie! I've never made pumpkin pie before and I was estatic to find a recpie that didn't require baking. My opinion though it had an obvious gelatin-like look than pie-like, which I hoped it wouldn't have, but no one else seemed to notice. I guess I just did since I knew what was in it lol. Nevertheless, everyone loved it. I think this will be my new Thanksgiving pie recipe..!

Very easy and a perfect way to use left-over pumpkin. Made with fresh pumpkin ... hmmmm A little sweet - but that's what pie is for ;-) I don't like using gelatine so I thickend the mix with about 1 T of cornstarch. Worked surprisingly well.

I usually forgot to rate a recipe, but this one is a keeper.  My husband and I did agree that the crust needs to be a traditional pastry crust.  Even my father, the pumpkin pie expert, was surprised by how good this was.

This recipe is awesome! I made it and everyone loved it. I used this recipe a second time but modified it instead of canned pumpkin I made a blueberry peach puree in my food processor and only used cinnamon and a little vanilla extract. It turned out awesome as well. Next I'm trying raspberry apple I'll update with how that turns out. Awesome recipe!

Turned out excellent! Followed the directions exactly. The chilling process took longer than I expected. I chilled the pie overnight in order to allow the gelatin to firm up the pie.

So easy! Just added a tbsp of vanilla though- that's the only change.  Be sure to add the beaten eggs a little at a time to make sure they don't scramble! I made a day ahead and the consistency was perfect!

We made this but didn't think it was as good as a traditional pumpkin pie.  The texture seemed a bit gritty and the flavor of ginger was overwhelming.  We may have done something wrong, although we followed the recipe exactly.

oops, I forgot to add the eggs but it still turned out wonderful! I made mine individual pies using a muffin tin.Brought them to work and everyone said it was very delicious. My coworkers were surprised it was no bake. Note: keep chilled as it got soft after sitting out for several hours.

Loved it about sums it up. My oven has recently decided it was possessed by space demons and I needed to bring pies to a family gathering. I'm so used to making baked pies that I wasn't sure at first how this would work, but I was pleasantly surprised. Great taste and texture and no staring in the oven trying to decide after about an hour if the pie is the right amount of jiggly.

This will now be my go-to pumpkin pie and I can't wait to try it with different crusts, shortbread and gingersnap come to mind.

Thanksgiving day wouldn't be complete without pumpkin pie ... but with all the other items needing to be cooked, I didn't want to bake another thing.  This pie is super easy and oh so yummy.  Took it to a dessert party and it was a hit over all the other baked pumpkin pies.  This is definitely on my list of top holiday pies.

I made this pie with fresh pumpkin and a pre-cooked flour crust.  The flavor was good but the texture was a little jiggly, I suppose to be expected from the gelatin.  The crust stayed nice and flakey with this method but the overall consistency made it lose in a taste test with a Libby's pumpkin pie I made.

If I could select a 6th star I would! I love how simple this is to make. Every so often it comes out a little runny, but I think that's my fault. I've tried a few variants like adding chocolate or banana- made for some interesting tastes, but those would probably have a better texture baked the traditional way. I have taken to adding a secret ingredient that everyone seems to absolutely love including me. I enjoy offering to bring dessert to dinner gatherings now as I know what I'll be bringing!

I made this for thanksgiving the day before.  I bought all new/fresh ingredients.  It was in the refrigerator for about 24 hours and it never set.  It looked beautiful but when I cut into it, it was runny.  It looked more like pudding than a slice of pie standing alone.  What happened?!  I love this recipe for it's simplicity but I need it to be edible.

I baked this for my first gluten-free thanksgiving. I wanted to use my gluten-free ginger snaps to make the crust (instead of graham crackers) and knew if I used a traditional pumpkin pie recipe, the crust would get soggy when I baked it the second time around. So I looked around for a no bake recipe and found this one! It was amazing. The guests ate more of my pie (almost all of it!) and to my boyfriend's mother's disliking.. almost no one ate hers. This recipe made me very proud and it was delicious. Plus, it only takes 15 minutes to make!

LOOOOOVED this recipe! I followed it exactly (with the exception of making my own crust) and it turned out delicious!!  I love that it was a perfect-looking pie with no uneven cooking 'marks' and the taste was awesome! I will always make this in place of traditional pumpkin pie! All my guests asked and left with the recipe! MMmmm Make this! You won't be disappointed!

Great alternative!  No one knew it was a no-bake one until I put it side by side with a baked one.  Everyone had both pies and everyone preferred the taste and texture of this one.  THe graham crust was a bonus.   I am definitely not going back to baking pumpkin pie.  This tastes the same (better accordding to some) and it's less work!  That and the kitchen doesn't get blazing hot :)  Thanks so much for sharing!

Wow!what an awesome pie.  My family loved it.  It was fast, easy and very tasty.  Had some trouble finding 15oz can of pumpkin puree so used a whole can and adjusted the spices and added another gelatin.  Thanks for a great pie.

Best pumpkin pie you'll ever taste!!!! I'm not a fan of pumpkin pie, mainly because of the crust, but this no bake in a grahmcracker crust is the best. I'd made this last christmas for my family & everyone agreed it was awesome! I did use cinnamon but also used pumpkin pie spice instead of the other spices, as others suggested. I'll be making this pie each Thanksgiving and Christmas from now on!

Of all the pumpkin pies I served this season, everyone liked this one best. Its rich and creamy, custard-like texture makes it outstanding. Very satisfying.

I served this for dessert at Christmas and everyone loved it. As I am a working Mom I did not have time for something elaborate, but this tasted like I spent hours making it.

I may never bake another pumpkin pie. Yes, it's that good. I've made this twice in one week. The first time as a test, since I planned to serve it to guests, and the second time for a dinner party. Both times the pie was perfect. It's creamy and rich and has a wonderful pumpkin pie flavor. I strained the cooked custard through a fine sieve before adding it to the crust and did capture a few clumps of egg, so I'm glad I did.  I'll surely make it again and again. Thanks for the recipe.

Loved it!  I'm not a huge fan of regular pumpkin pie because of texture, sometimes.  This one has the crunch of graham cracker crust with the bonus of a lighter pumpkin filling.  Almost mousse-like.   I made it for someone who loves regular pumpkin pie, but he said he thought this was even better.   We did put a big dose of whipped cream on top, but it almost doesn't need it.  
One note - Instead of separate ginger, nutmeg & cinnamon, I used 2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice.
Thanks for the great recipe!

For me this was a 4 star based on the texture, which is due to my taste preferences, not the recipe. I am sure others would say differently if they don't mind texture.

for me the texture was a mix of a pudding  gelatinous yet had the taste of pumpkin pie. I did use one package of gelatin, two eggs. Next time I might use half of gelatin package instead all of it.

Other than that, I do love it. Just throws me off at first. So yes I will make it again but differently. If i didn't love pumpkin so much i probably wouldn't make it as often.

This was a very simple but satisfying pie to make. I made the graham crust from scratch so its tastes a bit more home made.

I love this recipe! Not only is it incredibly easy, it is delicious! I did add a bit of ground cloves and allspice along with the other spices; however, this was not necessary as the mixture was beautiful beforehand - I just love cloves with my pumpkin. I didn't have a graham cracker crust (for some reason they aren't sold in Australia that I am aware of) so I used some mini tart shells...they were so cute and everyone LOVED them. I will definitely keep this recipe in my arsenal and use it from now on! Thank you so much for posting!

I usually bake a traditional crust and let cool ahead of time, so it's more of a traditional pumpkin pie. But the flavor of this one is so good!!

The original came out of a magazine advertising Knox gelatin.  I know this because I've been making this recipe for over 30 years and it's my favorite, and I still have the tattered page.

This pie is amazing! I was a little skeptical so I made a baked pumpkin pie to bring to Thanksgiving dinner, and then I mad this no bake pie to keep at home and try for myself.  When I tasted the no bake, it was sooo delicious! So I cut a small piece to bring to Thanksgiving dinner to let my sister and mom try so that they could help me compare to the baked one.  They loved the no bake, and after trying the baked pie, the verdict is this one is better. The baked pie was still amazing (the other guests who hadn't tried the no bake pie LOVED the baked one), but this no bake pumpkin pie was more amazing. This was my first time ever making pumpkin pie, so I'm glad both turned out well and got positive feedback. But for future events, I'm gonna stick to this recipe. I'm planning to make it for the Christmas party this year.

And just to add, I followed the directions exactly. Not a single change, and it came out perfect.

this isn't the best pumpkin pie that i've ever had, but it's not far off.  plus, it's so easy to make that i can overlook it's slight lack of perfection.  i had it chilling in the fridge after only about 10 minutes.  perhaps in the future i'll try putting it in a home-made crust instead of store bought.

If you just don't like to bake, this would be a good pie recipe to go with. But if you like baking (and I do!), then a traditional baked pumpkin pie is much better both in taste and presentation. This recipe is actually more work than a traditional baked pie in that with a baked pumpkin pie, you throw all ingredients into a large bowl, beat, pour into a crust and bake. But it is nice that there is this alternative for those who prefer it. And it is pretty good, just not great.

Oh yum! While I prefer baked pumpkin pie, this sure was delicious! My only gripe is that this was not as smooth as it would have been if it were baked. I think I'll process my puree in a blender or food processor to ensure it is velvety smooth next time. I will also use a standard pie shell instead of a graham cracker one (just my personal preference). All in all, this wasn't bad considering the Thanksgiving dessert I was planning to serve was a total flop. :) Thanks for sharing your recipe, Cathy! I'm glad I gave this a try!

This did not work for me at all.  The pie set up just fine, but the taste was off.  It didn't have much pumpkin flavor as the taste of nutmeg and ginger took over.

I just made this in the morning before work--that's how easy it is! It chilled in the fridge during the day and was ready for my husband's birthday dessert in the evening! He loves pumpkin pie, and this turned out perfectly. A fun tip: since we had people over, I bought a bunch of those mini graham cracker crusts so everyone could have their own little pie. With a bit of whipped cream and cinnamon on top of each, they looked so cute. This is a great, easy, tasty recipe!

I've only recently moved from the UK to the US and have never tasted let alone tried to make pumpkin pie before. I read this recipe and figured I'd give it a try. Only thing I struggled with is how thick the consistency should be? I stirred for about 20 mins all in and poured into the pie crust. My husbands verdict? "hmm that's actually not that bad"  sounds like a winner to me lol.  Thank you for posting!

Really tasty dish, but NEEDS to be served chilled.  Did not solidify like regular pumpkin pie.  I really liked the graham cracker crust with the spicy ginger flavor.

This was great.  The taste and texture were delicious, it was easy to do, and you couldn't tell it wasn't baked.

I followed the recipe exactly, except used a whole wheat pie crust. Even though I prefer the taste
of a more traditional recipe, my family still liked this one!
Good job!

This pie is INCREDIBLY AWESOME!!!!!!! It was quick and easy to make, and tasted terrific. It is sure to become a regular for us. I did add 1/8 tsp of cloves, and it seemed to be a definite plus for those of us who are cloves-fanatics.

Pumpkin pie is my husband's favorite pie and this is now his favorite pumpkin pie recipe.  This is one of the BEST pumpkin pies I have ever had.  Very easy to do and it makes a thick creamy filling. The recipe is great with no changes. We do like it with whipped topping. I also like to add 1/4 tsp. of gound cloves.  Tonight I added 1/4 cup sugar and it was a little too sweet.  This pie would also be excellent in a prebaked pie shell. Just typing this is making my mouth water.

This pie got rave reviews from my family & friends.  Perfect for making the night before a dinner.  I had to make this with a baby in one hand and a toddler tugging on me and it was still easy. I would higly reccomend it to anyone.

This is the most easiest pie I have ever cooked. It tastes great. I make this instead of the one you bake. It is tastier and richer than the other. Try it, you'll like it.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it went over extremely well! It was so good that both my husband and I discovered we like pumpkin pie (previously didn’t think we did). Made exactly as written, and I highly recommend it. It’s almost like a pumpkin pudding pie.

Used a no bake graham cracker crust and made this pie in 6 half-pint jars.  Substituted 3/4 c Splenda and 12 oz evaporated milk for the sweetened condensed milk.  Worked great for my diabetic hubs and he'll have something special for dessert on Thanksgiving.  Will use Splenda in the whipped cream topping when we open his jars!

Thanks for this tasty solution.

Didn’t make any changes.  This pumpkin pie was a big hit.  Even my wife and granddaughter, who normally dislike pumpkin pie, said they thought it was great!  Best thing too, was that it was so easy to make!  I will definitely be making this again!

Great pumpkin pie and so easy to make.  I used the 12 individual graham cracker shells.  My friend who always watches her calories said she would take just one bite of the individual pie.  Before I  knew it she was back for the rest of the pie and that was a first for her.

This tastes great!  I used caramel condensed milk  (what I had on hand) and added a pinch of cloves, because we like them.  It hasn't quite set up yet, so I can't comment on the final texture, but I licked the spoon, and it was sooo good!

Followed recipe exactly. Great pumpkin flavor shined through. Ready made graham crust tend to crumble EZ and I stored them in the freezer 1 day before to have the pie set. Pie  was in the fridge 1 day and was a bit less firm the traditional pumpkin pie.   On my Thanksgiving easy dessert list!

Delicious! Everyone kept telling me it was the best pumpkin pie they had ever eaten. I chose this recipe because this is the way I remember my mom making pumpkin pie. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. I personally loved it and it has become my go-to pumpkin pie recipe. :) The pie was creamy with the right amount of spice. I am going to try it in a traditional crust next time, but it was great in the graham cracker crust as well.

I made this pie and it was amazing. The flavor was better than the baked types. It was smooth and creamy. Held it's shape perfectly. It took me about 20 minutes to thicken on my stove other than that I followed the recipe exactly. This recipe is a keeper!

The taste of this pie was ok, but I didn't like the texture. It wasn't smooth like a baked pie. I'll just stick with Libby's.

Delicious! My oven is not working and I wanted to try this recipe before Thanksgiving day. The consistency of this pie is much creamier than the baked pies I have always made! It was wonderful and I will definitely be serving this for Thanksgiving!!

I love this recipe and make it often! I started a few years ago when I first found it for Thanksgiving. My daughter loves it so much that she always has me make again a week later for her birthday instead of birthday cake. I follow this recipe exactly, it's perfect.

WOW!! Best flavor I've ever had in a pumpkin pie, and as a general rule of thumb pumpkin is my least favorite pie. Super easy and I used a gingersnap crust. Perfection!!!

Tried this recipe as a quick fix for a hubby with a pumpkin sweet tooth.
He said it was so so. I made it exactly as written. Won't make again.

I had to make mini pumpkin pies for a bridal shower and because I didn't want to overcook the pies or burn the crust, I made one batch and filled pre-cooked crusts. I topped the mini pies off with a structured whip cream. (See photo) this recipe was amazing and delicious! I added 1/4 tsp of ground cloves to the pie mix as well. I'm definitely doing these again! Thanks for the great recipe!!

I tried this recipe and I am disappointed that it is too runny. I put extra gelatin in and the filling has been in the fridge for about an hour, but it is still really runny - I wonder if it will thicken over night... sure hope so, I was replying on this recipe for my class in school. The flavour is good, but next time I will stick with the traditional recipe.

This was easy and it turned out delicious!  I made a graham cracker crust and refrigerated over night.  This morning I made the filling and this afternoon we had some with lunch.  Thanks for the recipe.

Bring butter to room temp. Or micro butter only until thumbprint can be depressed into it. Do not soften too much or else cookies will spread and become flat. I chilled dough overnite but an hour would have been sufficient. Made recipe EXAcTLY the way it is written. I am making again today.  May decrease sugar by a 1/3 due to sweetness in jam and glaze. GL! Fabulous taste!

I made this today as a backup just in case my pumpkin roll cake doesnt come out right. I have made this before, so easy and it tastes better then a baked one. I did do as others and use pumpkin pie spice instead..Keeping my hubby away from it until Thanksgiving is going to be difficult:) !! Definitely a keeper !

I make a very similar recipe---a lot!  I spotted it years ago in an ad for Knox gelatin and probably Keebler graham cracker crusts.  The only difference in mine is that you sprinkle the gelatin over 1 T of water in the saucepan to let it soften for a minute.  Then add the condensed milk, eggs and spices mix to that and stir continuously over medium heat.  I dial the nutmeg way back to about half that.  Thanks for posting this!

This is so very simple. I used the mini graham cracker crusts and they are adorable (10 for this recipe).  The grandkids will love, love, love them. I also used more seasoning because we love the spicy flavor. A dollop of whipped cream and a sprinkle of nutmeg or cinnamon to top it off.  This was just a dry run Thanksgiving.

I would give it 4.5 starts if I could. I loved the easiness of this pie and the flavor was great! However, my family who is crazy for pumpkin pie liked it, but said they would prefer the original. For an easy and quick pie, though . . . this can't be beat!!!

This is AWESOME!  I originally used this recipe in 2008 (sorry I took so long to rate and review).  We will not eat any other type of pumpkin pie now, this one is just too easy and great tasting.  I do make my own pumpkin puree though, because we always grow them in our garden.  This recipe really deserves more than 5 stars.  Thanks for the time saving recipe.

Wow! This is the best pumpkin pie   I have ever had, the whole family loved it. Smooth and creamy, not grainy like some pumpkin pies. I added 1/4 tsp. cloves to the recipe and it was very good. A pastry crust would be good also, but the graham cracker was a nice change of pace.

This recipe is DELICIOUS AND EASY.  I made this using the Graham Cracker Crust I recipe on this site and used 2 1/2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice in place of the cinn., ginger and nutmeg, just for convenience.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving dinner today and it was fantastic.  Pumpkin is my favorite pie and this is the best I've ever had...ever!  It was simple to make and the graham crust is perfect with it.  It takes longer than 10 min on the stove to thicken. More like 25. I ended up increasing the heat to help it along. It was well worth the time stirring.  If I could give it more than 5 stars I would!  I will never make another traditional pumpkin pie again. This is my recipe for life!

This was so easy to make, and has great flavor and texture. Pumpkin pie has been one of those things I dread making because it never turns out quite like I wanted, but this was perfect. I might experiment with it a bit but it definitely goes into the regular holiday rotation. Thank you!

Pretty good and yummy!  It tastes as though it was baked.  Only problem that I had was that I had a few white chunks in my pie.  I don't believe I scrambled the eggs to cause the chunks.  I think the chunks were from the gelatin.  Does anyone know how I can solve this problem with the gelatin.

I don't like pumpkin pie, but my husband said this was good.  He said it was way sweeter than the traditional version.

So amazingly easy to do! I had never tasted or done a pumpkin pie before in my life, so I was wondering what it'd turned out to be. I fallowed the recipe exactly, except instead of gelatin, I had bought pectin (by mistake); I improvised that part. But it's really yummy, and I wouldn't hesitate to do it again. Thanks for sharing!!

I have made these pies for the last five years and always a huge hit! We've done taste comparisons against Frisch's and these win!

yummy!  my can of pumpkin was bigger than called for and ended up being enough for two small pies.  I just added a bit more spice.  So easy & got great reviews.

Really good, and a much better way to make pumpkin pie when you don't want to make your house even hotter by baking on a already hot summer day. I only had a can of pumkin pie filling which already had the spices and sugar, so I used 75 ml of evaporated milk as per directions on the pp filling can and followed the rest of the receipe as written and it turned out great. I mainly make P Pie for my son, who doesn't like the crust, so I poured the mixture into a glass bowl and put it in the fridge for my son to eat as he wishes. This my new warm weather pumpkin pie recipe althought I might make regular pie in the winter.

I made this recipe exactly as stated and it turned out delicious! The spices were a great combination. My only complaint is that it is a little bit runnier than a baked pie, for obvious reasons, but nonetheless full of great pumkin flavor. This is one of the easiest & fastest pies I've ever made. The hardest part is waiting for it to chill!

I'm an American living in Australia.  I made this for my work place (had a can of pumpkin, can't get it here) and the Aussies just raved about it.  Most of them had never had pumpkin pie before as pumpkin (squash) is cooked as a vegetable here.  This was very easy to cook and I may never go back to baked pie again.  Thank you

DELICIOUS!! I think I'll be making this pumpkin pie from now on. It's easy and quick and tastes pretty close to the baked pumpkin pie! Lots of flavor which was always my issue when trying other recipes... I LOVE spices, so this was perfectly spiced! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING THIS WITH US!!

I just bit into this pie. Okay, well, I started and couldn't stop! I HAD to say how awesome it is! It beats the last traditional pumpkin pie that I made. I am definitely making this for my boyfriend's family's late Thanksgiving this weekend! Thanks soooo much! Super easy and so delicious!

THANK YOU!!  I love this pie, and I'm not really a fan of pumpkin pie.  It's way better than the standard pumpking pie.  I made some changes:  used regular prebaked pie shell instead of graham.   Used low-fat sweetened condensed milk.   Instead of 1/2 t. nutmeg, I did 1/4 teaspoon of fresh grated nutmeg, and 1/4 teaspoon of Chinese 5-spice.   This pie totally rocked!!

Best pie ever!  My fiance's mother loved the pie when I made it a week ago and has asked me to make it again for thanksgiving.  I used egg substitute instead of eggs and fat free sweetened condensed milk because she is on a low fat low cholesterol diet.  It came out really creamy and was definitely set in 3 hours.  If you don't eat the crust, this is one of the healthiest desserts you can have on thanksgiving! Definitely a keeper.

I have always burned the edges of my pumpkin pies.  This tastes just like the baked pie, but with no burnt edges.  I don't know that I'll ever go back to baking pumpkin pies again.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was pretty good.  Simple to make; I love pumpkin pie and I think I will make it again.  I used a ready made graham cracker crust but didn't "cook" the crust in the oven prior to pouring the filling.  I will do that next time or perhaps use a pre-baked pastry crust.

I just finished filling my mini graham crusts and I couldn't wait to try it...I am glad I tried it AFTER I filled the crusts because I could not stop scraping the pan to get the last bit out to eat. This was AMAZING how good it is for no bake. I LOVE Pumpkin Pie and this was just an excellent recipe with the perfect flavors. From now on I will make only this recipe. Thank You for such a quick, easy and just all around excelent recipe.

Yum, so easy you'll feel guilty. I used fresh grated nutmeg.  I liked the graham cracker crust and can't wait to try the traditional pastry crust. Has a nice firm consistency, not mushy at all. Thanks.
