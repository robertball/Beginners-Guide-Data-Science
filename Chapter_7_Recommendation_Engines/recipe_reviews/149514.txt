Rather than fry such a lovely side dish, I baked these at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.  Worked beautifully.  These are quite time-consuming, and would work well to prepare the "balls" ahead of time, then bake when ready -- would be GREAT at for a dinner party.  One time-saver: I stuck the rice mixture in the freezer for 10 minutes rather than chilling it overnight.

Deelish!  The only things I did differently were to omit the saffron (as I had none on hand) and used extra virgin olive oil for the frying insteead of regular vegetable oil.  I probably used more spinach than specified, too. But it came out wonderful. These were gobbled up at a drink/appetizer party I had recently. Great recipe so thanks to a fellow Albuquerquean!

I made this for a potluck and it was a HIT!  I fried them the night before, and then reheated them in the oven until warm, and served with marinara sauce.  Everyone loved them, including my picky sister!I might substitute water for the wine next time, and I would only use about 1/2 of an onion, because the flavors came off pretty strong, but it was still yummy.

These are delicious! My husband told me to add this to the favorites list. I used Fontina cheese in the center, and mixed chopped ham with the rice, I also spread the rice on a cookie sheet in the freezer for 10 minutes instead of the fridge for 4 hours. I will definitely be making these again!

While the taste of these was very good, they're very labor intensive and took a long time to make.  For that reason I probably wouldn't make them again.  I used a 1" scoop to help form them, scooping up some of the rice mixture, pressing the cheese into it, then mounding more of the rice mixture onto it.  The scoop made it easy to form and unload the balls.  Once the balls were formed and rolled, the frying went quickly since I was able to fit about 20 at a time in my pan.  The recipe yielded 80 for me.  I have a lot that I froze, and today I found that heating the frozen ones about 15 minutes at 350 degrees  got them to just the right temperature.

For once, I followed the recipe exactly & I have to say, this was the best risotto I've ever had & I'll make it again. Not the balls though. It wasn't that they were terribly hard to make but once fried, the risotto lost all flavor for me & just tasted like fried breadcrumbs. We call that "brown food" around here & neither one of us cares for it. The recipe is excellent, easy to follow, & a good use for leftover risotto but I'd rather have the risotto as is cuz it ROCKS!

Fantastic recipe! I rolled in homemade bread crumbs and then baked. Obviously gave it a different taste, but everyone loved it!  I will make again!

These tasted very good but were SO time consuming to make that I probably won't make them again.  I agree with another reviewer that the onion stood out too much and so I would probably reduce.  I tried to bake them as another reviewer suggested but they did not turn out well for me - the inside cooked but the outside didn't brown up.

This recipe is very time consuming but well worth it! Honestly, this is one of the best recipes on this site! I absolutely adore these little rice balls! I came across this recipe by accident, found it interesting and saved it. A few weeks later, I made them. I few days later, I made them again! I've made these about 5 times so far; I'm actually cooling the rice mixture now lol. Thank you so much for posting this recipe. I love these hidden recipes with only a few ratings that turn out to he a hit. I use multiple blogs, cooking shows and different websites to find great recipes and this one is in my top 3! I serve it along side "the pioneer woman's" penne alla vodka. That's great too btw. Ok, enough ranting and raving! Thanks again!
SIDE NOTE: if the saffron threads are too expensive or unavailable at your local grocery store, I heard Tumeric works great as a substitute. If anyone tries this or uses any other sub' please let me know! Mollie1983@yahoo.com

These are great. Served them twice and everyone thought they were wonderful. I bought the small mozzerella balls at the deli. I made 24.

Used leftover risotto but the technique worked well. Baked instead of frying.

I had some arancini at a local restaurant in December and loved it.  So this is an attempt to recreate.  I'm exhausted - started making the risotto on the same day as the arancini, is why.   It's taking longer than 20 mins to brown these puppies... I've put them under the broiler for 5 minutes to see if that will help.  I hope the parchment paper can handle it.   It only took 1-2 mins under the broiler to do the trick, but the bottoms were still soggy so I flipped them over and put them back in for another minute.  They look pretty good and taste like the risotto - but are quite fragile before cooling.  I used mozzarella and Jarlsberg cheese as inserts, just to see how that would be.  Making the risotto the day before is the way to go!  These are  really fun appetizers and I'll make them again.

So delicious!  I used shallots in place of onions.  Other reviewers have complained that this was too "hands on", but I didn't find it so.  Will make this again and again!

This is pretty good.  I didn't fry (baked at 350 for 30 mins) and didn't use mozzarella (didn't have it), but I really liked it anyway.  The balls didn't stick together all that well, but I think it's because of the rice I used.  I think--and I'm no rice expert, so I could be wrong--that Arborio rice is stickier than other rices since it's used for risotto, so it probably sticks better.  Since I'm having trouble finding that kind of rice, however, I just tried it with regular rice.  Very tasty, and that's from someone who isn't the biggest fan of rice.  Thanks for the recipe!
