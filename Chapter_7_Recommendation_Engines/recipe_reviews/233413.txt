No ho-hum peas these.  These are peas all dressed up pretty. Onion, pancetta, fresh thyme and white wine (and I couldnâ€™t help adding a bit of fresh minced garlic) - what a great, flavorful combination of ingredients!  Happy to be the first reviewer and give this recipe two thumbs up.

Love it, love it, love it! This dish adds an upscale touch to my meals while being so quick and easy to whip up. I wouldn't change a single thing, this recipe is perfect. My only recommendation to first time testers it to not overcook the peas once the wine is added, which I accidently did on my second batch. The slight flavor of the wine is simply delectable with the peas but the wine taste will dissipate the longer it is cooked so try not to surpass the recommended cooking time. Thank you so much for sharing this beautiful recipe!

We made this dish as a side to a nice Chicken Dish.  The Peas were a hit, a real gourmet side dish for sure!  Easy Peasy (Pun Intended)  Thanks Don!

Quick,easy,delicious...need to say more? Keeper! To keep them bright green do not overcook the peas just until they are no longer frozen, and do not cover them because the vapor will overcook them and they will immediately turn dark green.

Nice change from the your ordinary peas. The thyme really works well here, and I also added some garlic. In a pinch, I'm sure bacon would be a good sub for the pancetta.

This is a great way to cook boring old peas. I followed the directions exactly. I think it's worth using fresh thyme instead of dried. I have to cook mine a little longer than stated to get the right texture.

So easy and absolutely delicious! I doubled the pancetta since my package was a 4 oz pack and I didn't want to have it sitting around. it was so good on it's own and even the roommate who hates veggies liked it. he mixed it with his rice and ate it.

It was great! But the pancetta didnt really crisp up it was a bit chewy. I would try to fry it longer than what the recipe says next time.

These were yummy.  Made exactly as written except I didn't have enough fresh thyme so I wasn't able to add the whole amount.  So much better than plain ol' peas.

What a great starter! We added bacon and pancetta. Best of both worlds! Topped with scallions! Really good!

Delicious addition to our Easter meal.  I prefer a little snap to my peas so I cooked them from frozen for about 5 min.  I also doubled the AMT of pancetta because more is always better. Used red onion so the dish was visually appealing too. Definitely will be put on my recipe rotation

Very easy & simple! Way better than canned peas by far! And I really don't have an excuse not to make them this way. I added garlic and all the flavors came together wonderfully.

This dish was flippin' yummy!  I did not change a thing, and I would definitely make again and would definitely recommend to anyone!!!  I could see people wanting to add maybe some parmesan cheese which I bet would be great, but quite honestly, it's great as is.

These are delicious just as written.  I have made them twice and they disappear FAST.  I love them!  The boring peas are gone and replaced with something wonderful!

The original recipe probably tastes really good, but I used what was available at my local supermarket - so pancetta became prosciutto, onion became red onion (I had some left over so I used that), and white wine became lemon juice (my husband won't eat food made with wine).  Individually, maybe the recipe could have overcome a substitution. But all together - nope.  The peas were perfectly cooked, and sweet, but the rest of it was bitter. Easter fail. :(

Served this with Thanksgiving dinner instead of the usual veggies. Everyone loved them. In fact there were no leftovers.
