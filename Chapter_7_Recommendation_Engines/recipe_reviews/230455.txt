You could use this in decorative fashion using a pastry tip on a cracker (as pictured) or you could just dip into it with anything available. If you love blue cheese you'll love this. This reminds me of a comparison: when you love plain horseradish you can eat it plain; but if it's too much you can add sour cream or mayo to cut it. That's kind of what this is like. Whatever it's good! Thanks for humoring me with my review. Just make this!

I tried this for a small party. It impressed my guests with its' flavors especially when paired with a strong cracker. It kept well in the fridge overnight and the taste stayed true the next day.

This recipe was the favorite of the party. It was great on a cracker. I am very happy to have the recipe to try on my own!

Blue cheese and Port wine are a classical pairing. For desert I piped decorative blue cheese mousse rosettes on servings of port wine gelatin. It was voted best dish at the dinner party.

This was a simple recipe and tasted fabulous on crackers and veggies for a party dip.
