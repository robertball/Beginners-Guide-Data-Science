Great recipe,Barbara. A tasty combination with the celery soup. It is a tad salty for my family, but I couldn't find reduced sodium celery soup. I'll keep looking because this is a definite keeper. Oh Yeah...I believe the cooking time should read one hour at 350 degrees with a cover the first 30 minutes, no cover the last. At least, this is how it worked for me. The chicken was sooooo tender and the sauce was just thick enough to make a good gravy. The stuffing was moist with the edges being crispy. A very pleasant texture all around. Thanks so much for sharing.

Unfortunately, I baked it uncovered for 60 minutes and it was quite dry, but still delicious. The next time I will bake 30 minutes covered and 30 uncovered, which is what other raters mentioned in their reviews: I didn't read the reviews until after I made and ate it!

I used cream of chicken soup, not cream of celery and used milk  instead of sherry.  Turned out great..chicken was moist and with lots of flavor.  I did bake at 325 for 30 minutes covered then 30 minutes uncovered as others recommended. A comfort food for sure! Thanks

This was great! Added fresh mushrooms and onion to the stuffing. I also seasoned the chicken with a spicy mustard.  As others suggested, I cooked it 30 min covered and 30 min uncovered and it turned out perfect! :)

I had some leftover Swiss cheese and wanted to use it up, so I was looking for recipes and am sure glad I found this one!  This dish has wonderful flavor and is SO easy to make!  It really does taste like you spent hours. The only changes I made was I shredded the Swiss instead of slicing it, and I didn't have sherry, so I used milk. I will be making this again!

AWESOME!  I wasn't sure about the sherry, but the swiss cheese toned it down to a perfect blend of flavors!  My husband and I loved it.  I only cooked it for 30 minutes covered and then 30 minutes uncovered on 350, just like someone had suggested.  It was so yummy.  Try it!  Thanks for the recipe!!!  Oh yeah, I served it with mashed potatoes and collard greens.

Yummy and easy!  Only change was the cooking time (30 min. covered, 30 min. uncovered at 350*).  Served with green beans and bread.

I used breast tenders (about 2 lbs.) and it turned out really good, except I wish I had only cooked it for 30/30.  It was too done.  But the flavor is wonderful and I will definitely try it again!

Just made this recipe and we all enjoyed it.  I used chicken gravy instead of the soup and Merlot wine instead of the sherry, since I had neither on hand.  I baked it at 325* uncovered for 45 minutes and it turned out great.  Hubby requested that I add this one to my recipe collection.

Very good flavor.  I did add some garlic, salt and pepper to the chicken.  Only cooked 30 minutes covered and then 30 minutes uncovered as others suggested and the chicken breasts were not done.  Had to cook an additional 20 minutes.  My chicken breasts were quite thick.  Would make this again.

This is an easy and tasty dinner. You do need to season the chicken a bit with some poultry seasoning and garlic. Just don't add sallt. The stuffing makes it saty enough. Overall a very good recipe.

I made this chicken based on the reviews and it was a hit with my family.  My 7 year old son loved it and asked if I would make it for his birthday even!  I'm not a fan of swiss cheese or cream of celery but decided to try the recipe "as is" and it gave it such a distinct flavor we all loved and will make this over and over again!

I made this according to the recipe (except for the cooking time) and liked it alright, but thought it was a bit bland.  I'll make it again and maybe kick up the sherry, add garlic, use mushroom soup and fresh sauteed mushrooms.  It was 5 stars for how easy it was to make! Thanks for the recipe!

I made changes eventhough the recipe as is is probably fine. I just can't make myself use canned soup AND packaged dressing. Unfortunately ,my changes aren't right here sooo when I get them, I'll add soooo this review is more just a review for me that I don't pass it up. Easy & good. Love that! :D 5/12 Finally! :D Combine 1/2c sherry & cr/cel soup. Dredge 6 bnls chix halves in mixture. Place in 1T oil & foil-lined pan. Pour remaining sauce over chix. Bake@350, covered w foil ,30min. Remove foil. Drizzle 2T butter & 1T olive oil/canola blend over ten slices bread, 1/2"cubes .Place around chix. Bake 30more, uncovered.  Slide cubes off chix .Remove chix & slice. Stir pan contents. Serve over chicken. Very,very good! Added dried cranberries to cubes & mmmm!

Add a couple of cans of green beans, drained about 15 min. before the chicken is done and this recipe would be perfect.

I needed a dish to take to a friend who is undergoing treatment for breast cancer. I wanted something very flavorful since I knew that soon the chemo would take her taste for food away. I had sherry, chicken breast, Swiss cheese and stuffing at home so thought I would give it a try. I made a batch for her and her husband and a batch for me and mine, dividing the recipe between two 9x9 pans. It was wonderful! I will consider this a quick and easy recipe that tastes like you spent hours!  Make it...you won't be disappointed!!

Easy to put together -- was a bit too "buttery".  Next time will cut back on the margarine.

This recipe was way overdone at 1 hour, 30 minutes.  The chicken was tough, and there wasn't enough liquid for the stuffing.  If you're going to try this recipe, try cooking the stuffing alone for 45 minutes, adding additional liquid in the form of butter or more soup, and then add the chicken for the last 45 minutes.  I think the flavors go well together, but the dish was inedible because of how dry and overdone it was.

Surprisingly very, very good.  I don't usually go for soup-added recipes, but decided to try this.  It turned out great.  Followed recipe as written as ingredients would allow.  I didn't have sliced swiss, so I used shredded; replaced sherry with dry vermouth; had only one 6 oz box of chicken stove-top stuffing; used 1/2 c butter; baked in an 8x10 casserole, covered 30 min and uncovered until breast were done.  wah-lah!!  Breasts were moist; nice sauce, topping was crunchy!! Even my husband liked it.  He's not a picky eater, just doesn't care much for chicken breast, but I try to squeeze it in every now and then.  I think I'll try this with boneless pork chops, pork stove-top, and mushroom soup. HMMM?  Thanks Barbara...enjoy everyone!!  OH!  I forgot to mention that I seasoned the chicken breast with Penzy's Northwoods seasoning and placed in ziploc bag in fridge for a couple hours, flipping them over several times.  I'm certain the recipe would have been great without it, but I just love that seasoning....would be good on a car bumper!!!  It was a free sample with my last Penzey's order.

I made this with 3 chicken breasts & half the cheese, stuffing & butter.  I made the full amount of sauce substituting lo salt chicken broth for the sherry. I cooked it covered for 30 minutes at 325 then uncovered & cooked 30 minutes at 350. Although my husband and I both liked it, it was super salty. Not sure how you would fix that since herbed stuffing mix is salty by nature. I expected it to be more saucy but the stuffing of the 3 breasts soaked up the sauce for 6. Probably won't make again because of the saltiness.

I substituted white wine for sherry and used mozzarella instead of cheddar.  Had about 4 oz of stuffing in the house and used 1 stick of butter, the dinner was tremendous with small red potatoes and green beans.

Made this exactly as written, except I accidentally grabbed 98% fat free cream of celery soup instead of the original, so I was a little worried the flavor wouldn't be as good. I couldn't have been more wrong, this was amazing! Such a unique blend of flavors, I will definitely be making it again!! :)

The chicken was moist and flavorful but the stuffing was dry. Add more soup, water and mushrooms. I added this one day later and warmed it up. It was good.

Not bad!  I only used two chicken breasts but kept the sauce the same.  Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly.  The chicken was baked for 2 hours (I love dishes I can put in the oven and let it rip!
) and wasn't the least bit dry, and no knife needed.  It cut with a fork.  We did find it just a little salty, though.  Next time I'll not salt the chicken, just use lemon pepper, and will dilute the soup just a bit...maybe add sour cream to it.  Overall, a good recipe we both enjoyed.

I think it had good taste but need to add 2 cans of soup and uncover for 30 minutes not a hour....
