I probably shouldn't be rating this recipe because I did modify it, but the recipe with alterations made a delicous breakfast!  My boyfriend said it's a keeper.  I reduced the biscuit mix to 1/2 cup since i wanted it to be less bready and substituted a 1/4 cup of milk for the oil to make the dish less fattening.  Finally the only other change I made was to grate the zuchinni.  The dish had a wonderful light texture.  Thanks for this recipe!

Delicious!  Much better than the photo suggests. :)  I made a number of changes, but I bet it's just as good as is.  I used Italian seasoning instead of seasoned salt, fresh parsley instead of dry (so doubled it), 1/2 C Colby Jack instead of a 1/4 C Swiss, only 1/2 Bisquick, mostly milk instead of oil (but a little oil), and grated one zucchini instead of slicing both. Also added a 1/4 tsp of dill weed and 1/4 tsp of ground mustard. Wound up cooking it for about 40 minutes in an 8in pie dish.  Both of my guests talked about it throughout the meal and asked repeatedly for the recipe.  One commented how she now knew what to make for brunch for her vegetarian roomie.

I am so impressed with this recipe. I wasn't sure how it was going to work out--I used my smallest zucchinis and it still looked like too much zuc to bread, but it worked out beautifully. It's perfectly spiced and seasoned, the baking time is perfect for the zucs to come out moist and not slimy. The bread is a nice egg bread. It was really delicious. I sliced the zucs as thin as I could get them--I'm no chef, so the slices were rustic rather than paper. So let's call them 1/8" slices, and rounds. I grated the parmesan off a block I had around, rather than using the stuff from a shaker. I didn't have any seasoning salt, so I used paprika and some other stuff with a little salt. My kids ate it and my husband liked it, so it's a keeper in my book.

Zucchini Brunch Bake Haiku: "SO close to 5 stars! A few things should be reduced. But darn, this is good!!" First time made this as directed, and found the zucchini hunks too chunky, the biscuit mix too bread-ey, and the oil, well, just too oil-ey. Went back and read reviews, and changed accordingly; i.e. grated the zucchini and wringed out liquid, halved the baking mix, reduced the oil and added milk (oh, and for a carnivore, added some leftover cubed Easter ham), and ohhhwowohhhwow, this was good! After it sat at room temp., eating a square was like picking up a savory "brownie", and microwaved the next day, just as good. Can't wait to make again w/ a whole slew of veggie, meat and cheese variations that I have in my mind grapes!

this recipe is very delicious, however, you need
to adjust the baking time to 85 - 90 minutes, which is lightly golden brown & toothpick comes out clean.  Our oven temperature is a perfect 350.
Excellent warmed up next day in the microwave!

I made this for my Mom group - it turned out great. I substituted shredded Colby for the parmesan, and also shredded zucchini. I upped the serving to 8, and added 2 Tbls of sour cream. I also used a little chipotle pepper with the spices - lovely!

I helped my 5 year old make it with 1 zucchinni and 1 yellow crookneck squash.  She can't used a sharp knife, so we grated it instead. Baked up nicely with a light quiche-like texture in a glass 8x8 pan.

Really enjoyed this! I added a little extra parmesan and doubled the spices called for, and it came out nice and flavorful!

This was really good.  I served this as a main course for a light meal.  Used 2 medium and 1 small grated zucchini (to use it up) which made the cooking time longer by 15 minutes.  Subbed Italian seasoning for the seasoning salt and oregano.  Served with pizza sauce on the side since it was all I had on hand.  Will make this again.

I made this for a family brunch and it was a huge success! Took 30 minutes exactly in the oven. I replaced the Parmesan with a cheddar/Monterey blend and it was delicious. I also had a hard time finding seasoning salt so I made my own concoction and added it to the mix. It got rave reviews and 2 people asked for the recipe!

Very tasty recipe and a great use for a bountiful crop of zucchini. I used crookneck and zucchini. Next time, I'm going to add cheddar or Velveeta on top for extra taste.

I've been making this for years with the same recipe which was passed down in my family.  I use Krusteaz buttermilk pancake mix.  This recipe is addictive.  It's my favorite way to eat zucchini.  Sometimes I add tiny pieces of pepperoni.

I made this with sliced zucchini as the recipe called for. I didn't have parsley or season salt so I I used herbs de Provence. The substitution worked well. I was surprised how the dish stuck in the pan even with cooking spray and all that oil. I would try and use al alternative to the oil next time. The dish was ok but not fabulous. I was expecting something a little more eggy and less bready.

This was very tasty. I shredded the zucchini and used suggested modifications from other posts. I only used 1/2 cup of the baking mix, and 1/4 cup of milk. I added about 1 tablespoon of oil. I baked it for 35 minutes. Although the toothpick came out clean, I found it to be a little to “wet” next time I will bake it longer. I am also thinking the 1/2 cup of baking mix might be better with the shredded zucchini. I will certainly make this again.

Cold In Florida today, didn't want to run to store to buy the baking mix.  I googled a substitute baking mix recipe and used that. Consists of only 3 ingredients ( all purpose flour, baking powder and very little Crisco baking stick) which I had on hand. I did liberally use the pam spray and nothing stuck after baking, great.  I  used a mandolin to slice my 2 zucchini, the veg. cooked to perfection being so thin. Instead of the veg oil, I used canola oil. I used the full amount of salt, which I usually decrease in any recipe, and it was just right. I inserted the toothpick after 30 minutes of cooking, the toothpick came out clean.    The center loaf of my 8x8 glass pan was not cooked all the way. I did end up cooking it about 10 minutes longer, 40 minutes, instead of 30.  My Husband loved this. The recipe is definitely like a brunch meal. I will make this again, Thanks for the recipe.

I made this and it was a hit.  the 2nd time i made it i shredded the zuc and doubled the amounts and put it on a sheet pan and baked for 35 min.  the changes I made were, i salted the zuc and left it sit 30 min then squeezed out extra water,  added 2 shredded carrots. and about 1 1/2 cups of cooked crumbled sausage.   it was awesome,  delicious eaten cold too.  I would def make this again

I made this for a lunch with my family and everyone loved it. I made it exactly as the recipe states. I did not grate the zucchini. I made it the night before and it kept well for about 2 days. The one piece that was left on the 3rd day was a little too soggy for me so I'd say to make sure you finish it on day 2. I will definitely make this recipe again.

Made this for brunch and it was a hit, and not just with my vegetarian friends! :) I grated the zucchini as others suggested and added some reduced fat cheddar/mozzarella instead of the parmesan cheese. I also sauteed the onions before adding them and added some minced garlic. Delicious-- will definitely make again!
