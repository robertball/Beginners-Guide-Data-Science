I loved this recipe. I made it for Easter dinner. I made some changes. I omitted the water. After i marinated the ham, I poured the marinade into a sauce pan, let it reduce for ten mintues, and then poured it over the ham before I put it in the oven. Fantastic. Very juicy and very flavorful.

Made this for Christmas dinner, and it was so goooood. The only thing I did different was to add a single serving bottle of cola to the marinade, and omitted the water from the pan since I had the liquid from the cola. This was a real hit, and we'll be having this again, no doubt about it. Thanks for the recipe!

This was awesome! I did change the recipe a bit - I doubled the glaze (without the water) and poured it over a sliced, 4-pound boneless ham, then cooked it in the crock pot on low for about 5-6 hours. It made a simple, delicious Easter ham - excellent flavor.

I made this for our Easter dinner ham which was 12lbs with bone in so I just doubled recipe.  I used Candian Club since I didn't have Bourbon but it turned out wonderful very moist and tasty.

Amazing! I will definitely make this again.  The only thing I did differently was replace half of the water with apple juice. Great job Jennifer!

You REALLY have to like bourbon to like this recipe.  Apparently I'm not a fan of bourbon.  I cooked it according to instructions and it came out mushy, maybe it was the marinating for 8 hours, I don't usually marinate, just pour the glaze on and bake. There was no saving this recipe, the marinade penetrated too deep.

This is a 5 star all the way!  I doubled the recipe and used a 10 lbs bone in 1/2 ham.  I usually by a pre glazed spiral ham and since this was just a regular ham I wanted to add a glaze.  I put it in a roasting bag and let it marinade for about 14 hours.  (flipped it about 4 times)  I hate bourbon and my parents had left 2 bottles here and I wanted to use it up.  I was nervous because one of the reviews said that it left a strong bourbon flavor.  But my guests and I felt it gave it a rich savory flavor.  Everyone loved it.  This glaze is OUTSTANDING.  I even forgot the garlic which would have made it even better.  Thanks Jennifer.  I will forever keep bourbon in my kitchen from here on out!

I used Pork loin instead of ham.  I put crushed pineapples over it instead of the rings.  It turned out wonderful.  I also put 1 1/2 cups of coke ( a can would work too) instead of water.

I made this as written the first time, except I used a bone-in ham & didn't add the pineapple rings on the outside nor the water, but I used a disposible tin pan so I didn't need water & didn't want to dilute the sauce. The 2nd time I added spicy brown mustard- made it during the holidays & we had leftovers plus incredible ham & cheese sandwiches on crusty Italian bread for several days. Each time I used a pre-cooked [smoked] ham so I only heated at 20 minutes/lb. at 325 degrees and it came out perfect & juicy [didn't want overcooked dried out ham!] Bonus: both times got a meaty bone for home made pea soup later in the week!

This recipe was fantastic. I had heard over the years that bourbon-glazed hams were delicious, so on Christmas I tried the recipe and the masses were right. The ham I prepared was very yummy and I intend on using this recipe again and again.

I used this recipe for our Christmas ham, and we were all happy that I did! We used the left over juice in the pan to pour over the slices. The only thing I did differently was to pour over the juice from the pineapple rings that I put on top for decoration before I put the ham in to bake. DELICIOUS! :)

Absolutely fantastic! I doubled the sauce and made gravy with the excess (drippings) using just a bit of milk, water, and cornstarch. With the sauce I added spices (cloves, allspice, cinnamon, and mustard) to taste and since the ham came with a sauce packet, I tossed that in with it all. I poured half of the sauce on before I baked it and the rest when it was about done, baking it for another 10 min or so to set the glaze. Oh, I also omitted the water and just used whatever pineapple juice was in the cans. I boiled the sauce to thicken before pouring it on the ham.

We thoroughly enjoyed this ham!  I used Jack Daniels Honey Whiskey instead of Bourbon as we had some of that.  Worked out perfectly!  I will make this again!

Rather than use this as a marinade and then spoon over while it's baking, I found it best to take it and reduce it into a sauce.  Yes, I started out just as the directions stated, but prior to putting the ham into the oven, I took about 1/2 of the juice and cooked it on the stove.  Everyone raved about the reduction!  Just heat it until it becomes a little syrup-y.... great as a dipping sauce or to pour over several slices.  And that great Bourbon smell as it's being reduced - wow!

Very Good! I used Southern Comfort in place of the bourbon and also substituted the water with chicken broth.

My second time making this dish. This time I used cola instead of water.. and grilling it instead of cooking it in the oven to give it a smoky flavor. .. it was a smash hit the first time I made it per the ingredient. This time it’s

I gave it 4 stars because it is so thin. 
I like a glaze that is thicker that sticks to the ham and the pineapple. 
Otherwise, this is a good recipe. 
I will thicken it with more sugar and in the future will not use 1/2 cup liquid to 1/2 cup sugar mustard mixture.  
I also did not use maraschino cherries because of the red dye.  I used the jarred cherries from Trader Joe's.  I miss the maraschino flavour, but I like healthy more.

Delicious, except I used ground clove instead of garlic because I like sweet ham. It was a hit!

I followed the original recipe but as live alone, it was too much. The next time I didn't make all the servings and only used pineapple pieces as the extra rings on top was as bit too much.

This was a great recipe! Made it 2 times for family dinners over the holiday and everyone loved it. I skipped marinating for 8 hours. The glaze was strong enough to hold its' own. I added enough water to my baking pan to cover the bottom pretty good prior to baking. Before adding the glaze, I baked a 7 lb ham for an 1 hr 15 Min. I then added the glaze and continued baking for another 1 hr 30 Min. Every 30 min I would take a spoon and cover the ham with the glaze until It was cooked. I let stand for about 20 minutes before slicing which I highly recommend. I did not add any of the sliced pineapples as the recipe called for either. This was personal preference because we do not like our meats too sweet. The 8 oz crushed pineapple in the glaze was perfect.

Excellent! I am not usually the cook for the family but I got rave reviews for this! Made it as is and it turned out wonderfully. It was nice to make something the kids didn't get a chuckle over..... We've made it every Easter since.
