After avoiding this recipe for months, believing that it couldn't be very good, I finally tried it and am beyond impressed with how it turned out.  This is so simple and easy and the taste is wonderful.  Watch the pepper, because it does get very spicy. Great to use this chicken with the refrigerated pasta and sauces for Blackened Chicken Alfredo.  Family loves it!

This was pretty good for a quick meal. i added a tablespoon of brown sugar to make it like a teryaki sauce because I knew my daughter (6) would be more apt to eat it if I took away some of the bite that worcestershire sauce has. I also threw some fresh broccoli to cook in the skillet, which I really liked, although predictably, my 6 year old didn't. All in all though, it was good and I would make it again.

This was one of the easiest meals I've ever prepared.  I served over a bed of rice and it was delicious.

Yum!  I used 3 chicken breasts (cut into 1-inch cubes) and 1/2 cup of Worcestshire sauce.  I added fresh mushrooms and had this on angel hair pasta with Alfredo sauce. Sooooooo good!!!

I really, really enjoyed this recipe, as does my fiance. It super quick, easy and tasty! I've made it twice now; once as is and once sauteing onions and garlic first. I prefer it with the onions and garlic. Note: Do Not be surprised if it tastes a lot like Worcestershire sauce. Worcestershire sauce is a strong flavor and is the dominant ingredient in this dish.

I used only 1/2 tsp of pepper and 1/3c of worch. sauce b/c I didn't want this to be too spicy for my daughter. I doubt I'd make this as a main dish but it went well placed atop of our cream sauce based pasta.

Wonderful! I sliced some onion and added to the Worcestershire sauce.  I also sprinkled chicken breast with Emeril's Essence seasoning before adding to the sauce.  I will surely serve this to guests. Delicious!

My family enjoyed this recipe. I cut back on the ground pepper just a bit... and even then, the chicken had a nice spicy kick to it. This couldn't be easier to prepare! I'll make it again.

I only gave the recipe 3 stars since I had to make some modifications to it. The basic concept was good. I also took some of the others revisions & ran with them. Here was my version: 1/2 cup Worcestershire 1/2 cup Low Sodium Soy Sauce 1 tsp dry mustard 1 tbsp brown sugar 1 tsp black pepper 1 tsp lime juice  I also browned the chicken pieces briefly before adding the liquid, brought it to a boil then reduced the heat. I will definitely make this again. It was a hit with even picky eaters of the house.

I added a little brown sugar, chopped garlic and onions per some of the reviews.  I halved the amount of pepper because it sounded kind of excessive.  
The chicken was moist and flavorful and I enjoyed it.  Funnily enough my boyfriend (who is not a picky eater at all) did not like it.  I have no idea why not.  
I didn't have any rice so I served it with mashed potatoes.

I wanted to like this.  Blackened Chicken sounded like something I get a the local malls food court.  But this really did just taste like chicken in worchestershire sauce.  Which it was so I don't know why I thought something special would happen when I cooked it.  It did not happen.  I did not like the flavor at all.

Nice spicy taste, but a little too much.  We added onions and served with white rice.  Really liked adding some blue cheese dressing on the side for dippig. (cooling)  Next time I would cut the pepper to 1t and may cut the worchestershire down a little.

It was easy to make, kinda just left it on the stove and did 1000 other things and then flipped it and kept working!  Husband thought it was wonderful, I actualy placed the strips of chicken over a fresh green salad and it was so yummy!

I love how easy this is. As someone else did, I cut back a bit on pepper, and added a bit of brown sugar. But that's just a matter of personal preference. It still had a lot of bite. Tasty and so, so easy.

Was looking for a healthier alternative for cooking chicken breast and this one was good.  Low in calories, the only downside is it is very high in sodium.  Tasty and easy to make.

It was easy... but I thought the worcestershire was way too powerful. I had marinated my chicken in Italian dressing so mabye that is why is smelled wierd while cooking. I am rating it 4 stars because there were no leftovers so obviously hubby and son liked it. I served it with spagetti and alfredo sauce from here.

This recipe could be really good if the worcestershire sauce didnt make the chicken so tart. I cant figure out what should be added to balance out the flavor. Otherwise the chicken comes out very tender and served over rice makes it a very comforting meal.

You can "get by" with this recipe. It really needed some sort of additional flavoring. Careful in the amount of pepper or else the chicken tastes hot w/the worch. mix. Mine didn't blacken very well either. Will try to make again w/a few adjustments like maybe adding soem garlic or some sort of citrus.

Quick, easy, delicious meal.  I served it over white rice, which went very well with the heat of the chicken.  My husband and I ate it right up - my only regret is that I didn't make more.  :0>

First time I made this, it wasn't good at all. I tweaked it like this: 1 cup Worcestershire Sauce, 1 cup sliced whole mushrooms, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tbsp brown sugar, half a handful of fresh basil or you can use 1 tbsp dried, 1 pinch sea salt, 1 tsp olive oil, and 1 tbsp minced garlic... Boiled chicken thighs for 10 minutes. Sauteed minced garlic, sliced mushrooms, and basil in olive oil before adding other ingredients, cooked according to directions and served over a bed of fresh, shredded lettuce, and white rice to absorb the sauce. Very good, but we love garlic, so if it isn't your cup of tea, omit the garlic powder. Kids love it!

I was surprised at how good this turned out.  I added a dash of Tony's Cajun Seasoning to the sauce--whoowhee!  That's good eatin' dere!

This recipe might seem to simple to produce a delicious meal, but IT'S NOT! The chicken turned out spicy (that's how my husband likes it so I added extra pepper), juicy, and downright yummy. Will definitely make it again!

I have eaten blackened chicken before, but in my opinion this was not close.  Not spicy, just tasted like worcestershire sauce. I served with pasta & Alfredo sauce but even that couldn't improve the flavor.

This was so simple and so tasty! I was actualy surprised at how juicy and how much flavor the chicken had! :) I put this chicken over brown rice and there was plenty of sauce to pour over it. Yum! Next time I'm going to add a little bit of brown sugar and maybe some minced garlic for added flavor...not that it needs any.

Without some major adjustments, this isn't all that good as is.  Obviously the worcestershire sauce is the main flavor, which I cut in half, but it needs more than that.  I added some onion, garlic, and had to season the chicken. Served it with egg noodles.  It was ok if that's all you had on hand. Oh, and the black pepper is way too much.  I definitely cut back on that. I added sour cream, anything I could to cut back on the extreme flavor...nothing really worked. I had to eat it, can't let it go to waste. Will not be making this again.

This was so unbelievably easy! I use whatever kind of chicken I get on sale, either breasts or small cutlet pieces, and either works really well. I also serve it over rice and veggies, and I make it about once a week just because it's so easy.

It might seem a little odd at first, but this is a really good recipe. The sauce gives the chicken a nice tangy flavor, and the pepper adds some nice heat. And best of all, it's pretty much 20 minutes from start to finish, and 3 ingredients. You can't beat that.

This recipe turned out delicious.  Instead of using just black pepper I cut that to 1/2 tsp and added 1 tsp. of cajun seasoning called "Slap ya Mama" and 2 minced cloves of garlic.  I then used the cooked chicken with penne noodles and alfredo cheese sauce topped with 1 cup. mozzarella cheese and dried basil.  It was super delicious and will continue to cook my chicken this way for that dish from now on.

FANTASTIC!  The whole family loved this one!  So many different dishes you could use this chicken for!  I did use thick chicken breast so it took longer to cook.  Next time I'll either buy thin chicken or pound the chicken out.  Thanks for the fast and wonderful recipe!

We loved the chicken.  It was spicy but we love spicy food.  The flavor went all the way through the chicken.  My son the picky one of the family ate most of it.  That is great for him.

My fiance and I made this dish and we loved it.  We put it over some wild rice, and had asparagus with it, and it was delicious.  We also made quesadillas the next day, and cut up the leftovers...it was the perfect thing to add to the quesadillas.

I thought this was pretty good and wonderfully easy- but maybe a little too peppery for me.  My fiance loved it though.  I cut the chicken into 1 inch cubes and served it over angel hair pasta. I'll probably make it again but cut back on the pepper.  Thanks!

I've made good blackened chicken with recipes from this site.  Why I didn't choose one of those I can only guess is speed in getting it in the pan, but combining spices isn't that timeconsuming.  Cook time is very close.  It wasn't until I tasted it did I realize that I essentially making plump  "chicken jerky."  'Hoping this can be saved by using in Brunswick stew.  No one wants it as is.

Easiest Blackened Chicken Haiku: "Sure, it is easy, but blackened is a dry rub, cooked fast on high heat." I didn't change a thing about this simple recipe, but I don't really see how it's blackened (well, other than the actual color of the chicken when finished) as I thought that a blackened protein was when it's coated in a dry rub and browned super fast on really high heat. Hey either way, this was easy to do, but I thought that the Worcestershire flavor was just too, too much.

Excellant dish exceptionally easy to make. Chicken was very moist and well seasoned. The only change I made was to add a sprinkling of cayenne pepper. I will definately make this again.

Easy, simple, tasty...perfect for a quick meal. I complemented the chicken with wild rice for a nice mix. Adding it to alfredo and pasta sounds great too.

Ever since finding this recipe, I have had it dozens of times!!!  I love pepper (and lots of it) on everything, but I found this amount to be a little too much.  I cut the amount of pepper in half.  My husband does not care for it because he doesn't like worcestershire sauce.  I can't get enough of it!  He is an OTR truck driver so I have it at least once every trip that he goes on.  Simple, delicious and low fat!

Yummy! We added this chicken to cheese tortillini and topped with "Quick and easy alfredo sauce". One of my families favorite dinners!

While I was looking at this recipe it sounds and looks disgusting but my Husband said we should try it.  I added just a pinch of Cajun Seasoning and it made it even better!  It was so freaking awesome!  Put it over a dish of Alfredo and that went perfect with it.  I would recommend this to anybody!

I didn't think this recipe would be very good - but I was very wrong.  My husband said it is a keeper and I agree.  I made the receipe exactly as it said, have patience as it does thicken up and make a very tasty glaze.  I am going to try it with elk or deer.

This recipe is super easy & my family loves it!  Its my go to recipe when I'm not in the mood to cook.  In less then two minutes the chicken is bubbling away and I can move on to something else.  I've tried both chicken breasts & chicken thighs and I think thighs are best because they come out nice and moist.

This was really not very good.  At first I was amazed, "yay!  yummy easy recipe!"  But after cooking it and eating it...first of all, it ended up being SUPER dry.  And it did not blacken at all.  I suppose it was ok, but if you are lookin' for something really tasty, you might not want to choose this.

I made this last night, and actually really liked it!!!  Be careful with how much pepper you use, especially if you use fresh ground pepper, as it gets a little strong.  Will make it again!  VERY SIMPLE!

I made this for dinner while my daughter had her best friend over and even though these 6 year olds ate it, I however was not impressed. I served it with brown rice and stir fried garlic veggies, and ended up eating everything but the chicken.Sorry but it wasn't what I had in mind.

I thought this was great!  The pepper makes it very flavorful.  I added some teriyaki sauce (1/2 cup) with 1/2 cup worcestershire sauce.  Good stuff!  Thanks.

I didn't like it, the chicken dried out fast.  I did cut mine into smaller pieces to use with fettucine alfredo.  My fiance loved it, the kids thought it was okay.  I probably wouldn't make this again.

Great recipe!  I put it over buttery-sauce egg noodles.  The sauce didn't thicken, but it turned out just great!  Thanks!
