Followed recipe exactly; thought the soup was a little thin and bland; I've had potato leek soup before that was much better than this.

Used a 1/2 tsp more curry then instructed, otherwise made as per recipe.  The potatoes were over cooked and the texture was pleasant so I pureed the soup.  The flavor is excellent!!!  If I want it chunky next time, I will lessen the cooking time.

So yummy!!  My instant pot quit working after the saute, so I finished in a pan on the stove.  The flavors are wonderful and so perfect for a cold snowy day!

Very flavorful! I don’t have an instapot so I prepared as directed then simmered in the broth for about 20 mins.  Then I transferred, in batches, to the food processor to purée.  I returned the purée to pot, added half and half and heated through.  Came out great, will definitely make again!
