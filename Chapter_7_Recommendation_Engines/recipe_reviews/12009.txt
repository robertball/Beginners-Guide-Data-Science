So I have now made this recipe a minimum of about 50 times.  It is our favorite recipe on this site, and my husband's absolute favorite meal.  Having made it so many times, I have tried every variation under the sun, and I have come up with what I think it the most flavorful method. Here are my suggestions:  1. Don't waste time chopping fresh peppers or paying the extra cost.  Buy the bagged frozen red, green, yellow pepper, and onion blend found in most brands.  You will not lose any flavor, and I promise you won't know the difference. 2. Heavy cream is best, but to cut calories 1/2 heavy cream and 1/2 ff half/half + 1-2 t. corn starch works, too. 3. Mushrooms aren't necessary, but use baby bellas if you do.  4.  Add more cajun seasoning.  This recipe doesn't call for nearly enough, but you will need to add strictly based upon your taste.  Once everything is added to the sauce, I taste it and keep adding until it tastes just right.  A little extra salt is usually required, as well.  5.  For the meat, I have found two variations that are PERFECT.  Our favorite is to use a rotissiere chicken from the  grocery deli.  Debone, add the meat to the sauce.  YUMMY.  We also like it with a pound of fresh shrimp. 6. Use  3/4 of a box of linguine. Four ounces? Crazy. UPDATE:  Many reviewers complain about the sauce being too thin for this recipe.  Just let the sauce simmer longer, or mix a little corn starch (a tsp.) with small amount of liquid (milk or water) & add it to the sauce.

very good.  i used the fat-free half and half with a little cornstarch to thicken.  it turned out great without the extra fat.

I originally saw this recipe in a Taste of Home issue from 1995.  This dish is served at the Monroe Street Grille in Tallahassee, Florida.  The manager provided the recipe to Taste of Home magazine. I made it and loved it! I made this dish when I was snowed in one day.  I substituted many things b/c I couldn't get to the store - I defrosted skinless/boneless chicken from a bulk freezer pack.  I used canned mushrooms instead of fresh, and I had to make my own cajun seasoning since I didn't have that either (1/2 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tsp pepper, 1/2 tsp. onion salt, 1/2 tsp. paprika, 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper to make 1 TBS Cajun seasoning).  I added Tobasco sauce and did need to add 1 tsp. flour to thicken the sauce.  I also omitted the green and red peppers and lemon-pepper seasoning, b/c, surprise! I didn't have those in the house either.  However, overall it was EXCELLENT and my fiance and I finished all of it.  I will definitely be making this again. Tasted just like Fettucini New Orleans that you can order in restaurants.

This recipe is quite good as written though I rarely make it due to the high calorie and fat content.  Once in a while, I'll suprise the family as a special treat as everyone likes it!  Couple of things could use improvement....  Use fresh minced garlic vs garlic powder ~ using fresh helps the recipe develop different levels of complexity beyond the Cajun seasoning.   Instead of green peppers, I usually substitute Anaheim, Pasilla or Hatch chili peppers when I can find them (Hatch chilis can be found in Hatch Valley, NM, and are wonderful).  I also increase the amount of Cajun seasoning to taste and add 1/2 tsp of onion powder.  The sauce is thin; good, but quite thin as many other reviewers have noted.  To avoid the thinness, make a roux using flour, butter and some of the sauce.  Please note:  It's important to let the roux cook down to a beautiful golden color before adding it back to the sauce otherwise you will taste the flour in it.  Thanks Tammy for the submission.

this is sooooo good. this is the kind of food i crave and what i usually order at restaurants. i did make a few changes that would work well for the calorie conscious...first of all i used about a T of the cajun seasoning that my boyfriend makes (i think it is emeril's recipe from food tv). i sauteed the chicken in pam, removed from the pan, sauteeed about 1/2 - 3/4 c of mushrooms, 2 T of finely chopped onion, and 1/2 T of chopped garlic in pam also.  removed that. added about a tablespoon of butter to the pan and scraped up all the brown bits. added 1 T of flour and cooked a couple of minutes until thick. then i used a little more than a cup of fat free half and half. let it thicken, then i dumped everything back into the sauce, added one chopped roasted red pepper, and a deseeded and chopped tomato; i doubled all the seasonings. tossed this with pasta and it was spectacular. i know this isn't a particularly diet friendly recipe, even this way, but it sure beats the restaurants version of creamy pasta and i think it tastes even better. my boyfriend LOVED it and he hates cream sauces (he also has a huge aversion to low fat/fat free recipes, but he didn't know). This made about four servings. I think it would be wonderful in the summer w/ lots of fresh veggies. may add baby spinach next time or broccoli... thank you so much for this recipe!!!

This is a great recipe.  I played a little with it by adding 1/2 cup white wine and some shrimp along with the chicken.  I also added extra cajon seasoning and Tabasco.  My husband loved it!  We will definately have this again!

Excellent! I did substitute fat free evaporated milk for the whipping cream and also added a little flour to thicken the mixture. The taste was wonderful even with this change.

I'm really sick so I needed a quick dinner I could throw together with as little effort as possible. I added a little more cajun seasoning, used all red pepper (we don't care for green peppers), a small sliced yellow onion instead of one green onion, I added a few cloves of fresh minced garlic and I increased the basil, lemon pepper and garlic powder. This fed all three of us (the kids ate most of it with my not feeling so good) and the boys and I just loved it. Huge hit. I do think that it would not have been as good had I not increased the spices. Next time, I'll add more mushrooms. I think this would be good with some steamed or roasted broccoli tossed in for an "all-in-one" meal.

I cook a lot and this recipe was very good.  For me to rate something five stars the recipe has to be spectacular!  I'm sure I'll make it again.  Because of the comments about it being bland, I did add more cajun seasoning and more cayanne pepper.  We like spicy!  I can't afford the calories so I used Land O Lakes Fat Free Half and Half and no one would know the difference.  I use this in Alfredo sauce also.  I thickened it with flour and water just like any gravy and it was wonderful.  There are so many different cajun spice recipies and the spice would make all the difference in the world as to how bland or spicy your finished dish is.  I looked for a spice recipe on line and made my own.  I also tossed in a little broccoli at the end for some more color.  Corn would also be good!  I might try that next time.

Good Recipe! I make this for my husband about every 4 months since it's so rich.  Tastes similar to a Chicken Scampi dish he enjoys served at a popular Italian restaurant.  This also works well for company.

I made this for a dinner party. What I did differently to the recipe is: I let the chicken sit in 3 TABLESPOONS of cajun spices for about 3 hours, then I cooked the chicken and removed the chicken from the pan and put it in a warm oven, then I added the other ingredients to the pan and after adding the cream I let the mixture boil then simmer to reduce it to a thicker sauce. While sauce was simmering I cooked the pasta. I plated up the pasta spooned the sauce over the pasta then I placed the Chicken on top of everything. All of us really really liked this dish!!!

I love this recipe!  I have made it several times, and have “tweaked” it a little to make it a little more figure friendly.  Instead of 1 ½ C of heavy cream, I use 1 ½ C fat-free half and half (land o lakes) and add 1 TBS of cornstarch.  I stir them together to get rid of any lumps, then add to the pot.  SO GOOD!

Tasty!  Now that we are all past the horrible flu that attacked us & I spent the past 2 days disinfecting the house, I can cook again.  This is a wonderful recipe.  I used left over chicken (from the beer butt chicken recipe on this site).  Next time I'll thicken the sauce a bit, but I will make this again for sure.  Thanks Tammy!

Interesting and different pasta dish.  To make it healthier and add a bit more zip, I substituted a combination of 1/2 cup light sour cream and 1/4 cup heavy cream for the 1 1/2 cups of heavy cream.  It was still very creamy.  I also didn't have cajun seasoning on hand, so I used Chef Paul Prudhomme's steak blackening magic, which is Cajunish and has a lot of bite. excellent!

This recipe has now become a family favorite.  I make it all the time and have doubled the recipe and served for company several times...and handed them the recipe by their request as they left.  Do I really need to say more?  I think the 150 rave reviews prior to mine speak for themselves. The best part is that although it says "cajun" it is not too spicy for the young ones and for those that feels that spice is what this recipe lacks, they can always add more of their desired spice.  Thank you Tammy.

This is a wonderful dish. I’ve made it a few times and have a couple of notes. You have to use heavy cream, it doesn’t taste right when you try and substitute for half and half or any combination you can think of, I’ve tried to cut the calories. The seasoning measurements are really just guidelines, season to taste! (I usually double.) The brand of cajun seasoning you use can make a huge difference, so don’t skimp. I like thicker sauce so I stir a teaspoon of cornstarch into the cream before I pour it into the pan. Mix the chicken cream sauce with the pasta before you put the parmesan on or the delicate flavor gets lost. And finally always, always use FRESH parmesan cheese!

This was absolutely delicious, although it took me more like an hour to make it rather than 30 minutes (I think the cooking times, especially the 2-3 minutes for the veggies, are very underestimated unless you want hard, crunchy veggies in your pasta). I would strongly suggest buying chicken breast tenderloin strips rather than the full breasts which end up being too much meat for the dish. It's a very versatile recipe. I can't wait to experiment with other veggies in this dish. I think it'd be great with shrimp, too. I doubled the recipe with no problem but you have to use a huge frying pan and the peppers make lots of liquid so you have to reduce it down a lot more. I added cornstarch dissolved in a little water to thicken the sauce after adding cream and reducing for a while. It makes the sauce a lot creamier and thicker.

Very tasty!!!

However, I really had to jack up the cajun seasoning, but I have a feeling Canadian Cajun has a LOT less kick (wusses....lol)  I'll pick up some real cajun next time I'm in Florida.

Boy-type people in the house really liked it, so it's going into the regular rotation!

This was wonderful!  It reminds me so much of the one they make at Cheesecake Factory!  I couldn't find a red bell pepper so I used a yellow one. I also decided we wanted more sauce so I used 2 c of heavy cream and 12 mushrooms as well as added a small sliced onion to the chicken when it was cooking.  I did end up adding 2 tbsp of cornstarch to thicken it up and omitted the green onions in favor of the sm onion.  Thanks for the recipe!  ***UPDATE*** I decided to try to lighten this recipe up a little bit and I used 2% milk in place of the heavy cream and an additional tablespoon of cornstarch for thickening, still delish!

I hate to be the one to give this recipe a bad review when there are so many great ones, but my family and I thought it was awful!  It was first of all very unappetizing to look at.  I used half and half like some of the reviews suggested and it was like we had pasta soup.  The peppers are barely cooked.  My son choked down a little and when my husband came in a little later he would'nt even touch it.  I did double the spices, but it just wasn't any good.  Please note that I've been cooking for years and years so I know how to follow a recipe.  I was just so surprized how yucky this was when there were so many great reviews.

My husband gets annoyed with pasta or fish dishes. He is a steak and potatos kind of guy and while I love any kind of pasta, my kids are so picky. I was a little hesitant to try this but figured at worst they would all hate it and I could eat the whole thing myself. 
I only had two cups of heavy cream so i used that and used 1% milk to make up for the rest of the cream. I added corn starch (just a couple tablespoons) to thicken it. Otherwise I followed the recipe. I didn't mind the chopping as it gave me something to do while the water heated up for the pasta. I thought this was an incredibly easy recipe and tasted like it was a special from a restaurant. It wasn't too spicy for my three kids. They liked everything but the peppers. My husband said it was fantastic. High prais from a pasta hater. I used a pound of linguine but didn't increase the amount of the sauce at all and there was plenty for two adults three kids under 7 and a bowl of leftovers for lunch. I didn't have a problem with the sauce being too runny probably because I added the cornstarch to thicken up the milk. It was nice and creamy full of flavor and very filling. I was going to serve garlic bread with it but forgot and i won't bother next time. It was so filling i wouldn't have had room for more bread.
Great great recipe.
It will be a standard for us.

This was a really good recipe; can revise to your own liking pretty easily.  If the sauce isn't thick enough, add some corn starch.  My husband loved this, even eating leftovers the next day (he usually won't eat leftovers).  I added a bag of frozen asian vegetables with some broccoli into this because my husband loves it in these type of dishes.  It went over well with him.  Happy hubby, happy me. I put some pine nuts on top of mine.

Holy yummy! I made this dish tonight, mainly for my hubby, who is a much bigger pasta fan than I am, but wow...I was pleasantly surprised. I had fettucine on hand, and used that...and would use again. For the cajun spice, I used Tony Chachere's and didn't measure out any of the spices called for, but rather seasoned to taste, eliminating salt altogether (as the Tony Chachere's had plenty). I was in a giant rush and used a 14 oz. bag of  frozen pre-cut peppers, which of course, resulted in extra liquid that I drained before adding the cream (I used 1 c heavy cream, and a 1/2 c of half and half). It was the perfect consistency, even after I threw in a handful of shredded parmesan cheese for good measure. I also used an entire 8 oz package of pre-sliced mushrooms, however, I would sautee them separately next time before adding to the chicken, as they too emit extra liquid, which I didn't really want in this dish. Even my 3 year-old was gobbling this up, and I was worried it may a tad on the spicy side for her. Hubby practically inhaled this! I will definitely make this again, only next time I'll use fresh peppers, and sautee those separately too. I'd also like to play around with this by using low-fat ingredients. Served with some crusty bread, and we had ourselves a meal....a good meal!

This dish is excellent! I made it following directions except I cooked the chicken in olive oil Pam instead of oil and used fat free half-half with about 1 tbsp cornstarch. It turned out great and nobody noticed I had slimmed the recipe down quite a bit. The pasta was even better the next night. A definate keeper!! :)

Wow! Thanks to VBHOKIE (Baby Bella suggestion, increase cajun seasoning and add corn starch to thicken) for your tips! Basically followed the recipe as written but used I Can't Believe It's Not Butter and Skim Plus Brand FF ½&½ and increased Cajun seasoning to 1 Tbsp. Stopped by the local produce stand today and got purple and orange/yellow stripped peppers~trying to keep it local and fresh. Hubby was WAY impressed with the flavors and textures. Thanks Tammy for posting! As Hubby says "This is a keeper!

Very delicious! My wife REALLY loves this recipe after I made a couple of modifications: I use 2 whole peppers (one green, one yellow/orange), 1/2 a yellow onion instead of a green onion, no mushrooms.

If you have a taste for spicy, I agree with other recommendations to dump in a LOT more of the cajun seasonings than the recipe calls for. By default it isn't bland, but you've definitely got some room there.

This is my favorite dish to make.  It's a wonderful recipe.  Delicious and fairly simple. Just FYI for anyone who wants to make it a little lighter... instead of using heavy cream, I use milk with a heaping tablespoon of flour whisked into it, then once I add it I let it come to a boil to thicken.  Works great.

Yum!  Will make again!  I made this after my son's football practice, and he is always starving so I needed a recipe that was quick.  Trying to stay low fat as possible so I substituted the heavy cream for 2 cups skim milk and tablespoon of corn starch, and it worked great.  The sauce thickened quickly, and was delicious!  I added two small diced fresh jalepenos from my garden, and it added just the right amount of heat!  Next time I am going to try shrimp instead of chicken!

Wow!  Outstanding dish!  I added some squash and it was delicious.  The only substitution I made cut the calories in a huge way -- I used evaporated skim milk with a little bit of cornstarch to thicken it in place of the heavy cream.  It was absolutely delicious!

YUM!  A big hit in our house.  I've even made it before with low fat cream of mushroom soup and milk or canned evaporated skim milk (even better!) in place of the heavy cream, and it tasted good as well.

This was really good! I did take the advice to use extra Cajun seasoning since my guys like spicy. I coated the chicken, added extra while cooking it and then tossed in some more while taste testing towards the end. Also, instead of using lemon pepper, I used some lemon peel and fresh ground pepper.

For those of you who said it was "soupy" my advice is to let it simmer long enough for it to thicken. When draining the pasta, save a bit of the pasta water. Be sure to follow the rule, "the sauce can simmer, the pasta can't wait." Make the sauce, and while it's "heating through" cook the pasta. This will allow the sauce time to thicken up. Drain your pasta, saving some of the water, then add the pasta directly into the sauce or pour the sauce directly over the pasta. Toss, toss, and toss some more. Then when you think all the pasta is completely covered, toss again. You will find that you may need to add some of that pasta water to thin the sauce, but add it by the tablespoon because you don't want it to go "soupy" again. 

I really liked GinnyG's suggestion of using some white wine and shrimp but my guys will not allow any kind of seafood to pass their lips, so I sauteed some shrimp in white wine for me and added it to my own portion. 

If this turned out bland for you, you aren't using enough seasonings. Remember to taste test as you cook and add seasonings until it tastes good to YOU! Play with your food!! ;-)

This recipe is a good starting place for Cajun Chicken Pasta. I knew it would probably need spicing up a bit; so I seasoned our chicken with Chef Han's Cajun Meat Seasoning (which I have had only been able to find in Louisiana)and added a significant amount of the seasoning to the sauce as well. I also added a great deal of parmesan cheese and a little corn starch to thicken it up. It turned out wonderful and my dinner company loved it. We will most likely make this again.

What a great recipe!!  My husband thinks this is better than the one he loves at a local restaurant.  The only thing I changed is I thinly sliced the peppers rather than chop them & added a little more cajun seasoning.  Thanks for the recipe, can't wait to make it again.

This recipe was very good! Definately would make again. I recommend cutting the chicken in smaller proportions and maybe even decreasing the amount of cajun seasoning a little because it was a little overwhelming but I will definately make again!

This was excellent!! I changed a few things due to our liking and ingredients on hand. I grilled 3 chx breasts sprinkled heavily with cajun seasoning on the Forman grill. I sauted 1/2 a green pepper and a TBS of garlic in 2 TBS of butter. After the chx was done I cut it up and placed in pan with the peppers and garlic. I mixed it up and added about 1 1/2 C of heavy cream and 2 TBS of cream cheese to the mixture. I then added salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder to taste. Cooked on medium for about 5 minutes and added 2 TBS of flour to thicken. Tossed in the linquine noodles and topped with parmesean cheese.  We all LOVED it!! I think the cream cheese really kicked it up a notch!! I make an awesome chx alfredo and my boyfriend said he thinks this was even better than that!! Can't wait to make this again! YUM!!

The recipe is good, quick and relatively easy, but a little lacking in flavor. 

I found it easier to cook the chicken breast whole in a single layer, seasoned on either side, then cut into strips, rather than cutting raw.

My uber picky husband loved it. Add more Parm and add while sauce cooks. Parm also helps thicken faster.
Excellent.

Only veggies I used were an onion and green bell peppers, didn't used lemon pepper, and doubled the cajun seasoning, and used 1 1/2 cup of fat free half & half.  I did add a bit of corn starch to thicken the sauce.  Would definitely make this dish again!

I absolutely LOVE this pasta dish!!!  I modify the ingredients a little, though.  I like bell peppers, so I add three kinds (red, yellow and green) and a sliced sweet onion instead of chopped green onion.  I used a couple of packages of Louis Rich's Southwest seasoned chicken strips, but still add the cajun seasoning called for.  I use a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce because mine always seems too thin.  This dish reminds me of a favorite pasta that I ate for lunch nearly every week at a local cafe in Chicago (I worked in the building adjoining to the cafe).  Even my co-worker couldn't believe how similar it tasted to our favorite dish!  This is very good served with a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese (the fancy shredded stuff) and a serving of garlic bread on the side - just like the meal at the cafe!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!!!

I thought this was really good. I added low fat sour cream instead of the cream which reduced fat and added a little bit of extra flavor. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This is a hit all around. It's become a regular weekly meal. Because my husband is not big on white sauces and loves tomatoes, I added a 15-oz. can of diced tomatoes. Suddenly I had finally hit upon a sauce with a similar taste to one in a seafood pasta dish I enjoyed at my favorite Orlando restaurant years ago. And it passes the Cajun test -- I lived in Acadiana for 4 years!

This is the same recipe as submitted by Carol Spradling. Not sure if that one is still online, but either way this became a staple in our home right away and has been so for over 8 years! This is one of my husband's very favorite meals, and he requests it often. The only thing I do differently is omit the green peppers because I really can't tolerate them. But I throw in some mushrooms to make up for it. Oh, and I actually prefer this with shell or elbow pasta, even a ziti shape because it seems to really hold the sauce more. 

Unfortunately, the leftovers do not fare well, so don't make too much at once. An all-time favorite, easy to modify to make it as spicy as you want. Excellent recipe.

This recipe is so ridiculously good! I have been making it for years, and am always amazed at how delicious it is when it's all said and done. I never used lemon pepper, always fresh juice. And always slice the peppers instead of dice.

My family is actually vegan now, and it was really easy to replicate! We obviously eliminated the chicken, and I used a roux to thicken the sauce (made from unsweetened, plain almond milk). Heckle if you wish, but my family was able to enjoy this with zero cholesterol and barely any fat (in comparison to cream of course...)!

Ummmm this was not good at all. Im very confused why it got so many good ratings but then realized i had the rating list sorted from highest to lowest so i didnt realize the bad ratings are exactly what was wrong with it. the sauce was runny, there was no flavor and i doubled up on everything. Luckily i cooked it for my dad and not my boyfriend (whom doesn't exist) cause he would have broke up with me for serving him something that tasted like nothingness. on the plus side i with all the carbs and cream im pretty sure i put on an extra 3 lbs....blahhhhhhh

The only thing that gives this dish any resemblance of a Cajun dish is the two teaspoons of Cajun Seasoning.  If you leave that out, this is an Italian dish.

Very good.  I would recommend using more Cajun seasoning than what the recipe calls for to give it more flavor.

Very tasty recipe!  I used bow-tie pasta instead of linguini.  I also added a little white wine and Greek seasoning for added "zing".  Try serving it with Texas garlic toast...yummy!

I seasoned the chicken and added another tsp Cajun seasoning for 3 total. Sauteed in pan until almost done and then removed. I let the chicken get brown on each side, over med-high heat. I used olive oil and butter for flavor and so the butter wouldn't burn. After removing the chicken, I cooked mushrooms in pan in a little butter/oil over med-high heat. Removed the mushrooms and deglazed the pan with about a half a cup of white wine. I let it reduce and tossed in the peppers. I also added about a half cup of sliced onions and a TBS minced garlic. Cooked for a min or two, and added the chicken, mushrooms, and all their juices back to the pan. I added all the seasonings recommended but doubled them. Garnished with diced green onions, and a bit more parm. I put my parm on before the onions to melt it from the heat of the sauce. Without these steps the recipe would be so bland. With these changes, I'd make it again.

I made this substituting shrimp for the chicken, which turned out quite well.  I used a mix of green, red, yellow and orange peppers and I omitted the mushrooms (didn’t have any).  I sautéed the shrimp separately just before serving.  This was very good and I would make it again with chicken or shrimp!

This was amazing!! Hubby loves spicy food, so I added more cajun seasoning. Only thing I did different was to add a chopped onion & since hubby isn't a fan of sauce, I just cooked all the meat, veggies, and seasonings, then used a jar of alfredo sauce to put over mine & the kids. He absolutely loved it even without the sauce. This will definately be a new "fave" in our house. Delicious!!!

Absolutely delicious!!! After reading reviews, I decided to double up on all the seasonings because I like my dishes with a lot of kick. I also used a spoonful of cornstarch to thicken up the sauce and it worked great. I added a sprinkling of paprika for color and the dish turned out beautifully. Easy to prepare and lots of flavor. Thanks for a great recipe!!

Cajun ? Where is the holy trinity ? This has potential. Advice - use a Cajun spice mixture without salt.  Add salt to your taste. Reduce sauce to taste and thicken if necessary.

Love this pasta! I used Paul Prudhomme cajun seasoning, used ff evaporated milk instead of heavy cream and added "worcestershire for chicken" which really adds to the cajun flavor!

I liked the recipe.  I would recommend increasing the amount of sauce, using fat-free half-and-half, and being careful with your spices.  You probably need more than 2 tsp Cajun seasoning.  I was using a pepper grinder so didn't measure my black pepper - and it turned out to be way too much.  I probably used somewhere between 1/4 and 1/2 tsp, but I'd also increased the amount of liquid to 16 oz and used 3 chicken breasts..  I'm a huge pepper fan, but this is a recipe that only tolerates so much.  Finally, I'd recommend cooking your chicken in cooking spray to skip a few calories and using and using a bit of flour to thicken up the sauce.

Really enjoyed this!  The cajun seasoning on the chicken added a little heat which you don't usually get in a pasta dish.  I subbed parsley for the basil and increased the salt.  I also did one cup heavy cream and half cup half and half to cut some calories and fat out.  Then I added some cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  Will be making this again.

I decided to use half and half instead of the whipping cream and to thicken I added a bit of flour. I like it spicy but my guests did not so I added a bit of sour cream at the end to lighten the spice. Was so good. Also ended up having at least 6 portions, great as left overs. Really delicious! Will be making this again for sure.

Yummi! This was amazingly good.  I used shrimps instead of chicken.  I omitted the mushrooms as well as the lemon pepper.  For the sauce, I used half sour cream, half light cream.  After I was done with the sauce, I felt it needed more flavor which is why I added more cajun in the sace, parmesan, cayenne and definitely nutmeg.  Next time, i'll try making it with chicken.  Thanks a lot for this recipe.

I used home made Cajun Seasoning (1/2 tsp each garlic powder, onion salt, Paprika, and cayenne, plus 1 tsp pepper), and it came out SPICY.  Next time I'll tone down the seasoning with flour to coat my chicken, since that much spice is too much for some people (I loved it though).  The other flavors melded very well- they weren't overpowered by the spice.  This makes a great cold weather recipe, and also goes great with a light sweet salad.

My husband and I both enjoyed this. I used fat-free half & half and thickened with a bit of cornstarch. It tasted rich and creamy, but guilt-free. My Cajun seasoning had a lot of salt (so I couldn't add more) so to get an extra kick I added about 1/2 tsp. of crushed red pepper flakes. I also used rotisserie chicken and added it near the end so it wouldn't dry out. I'll definitely make this again.

Made this for my boyfriend and he loved it....and let's just say, he's a very "meat-an-potatoes" kind of dude. I noticed that some other posters were worried about the consistency of the sauce.  I tried a little trick to thicken my sauce and it worked really well, it's actually the same method I use to make stovetop macaroni-n-cheese.  If you melt a little butter, add some cornstarch (I use flour) to make a rue,  add the cream, and then add it to the dish, it thickens quite nicely.

This is a great dish, and one my boyfriend BEGS me to make again and again. My only complaint is the consistency of the sauce-- but I see from other reviewers that I should perhaps cut the amount of cream used or add some cornstarch-- good tips, thanks. I use much more seasoning than called for, practically drowning the chicken in HOT cajun seasoning, and then adding liberal amounts of garlic salt and black pepper to the sauce. Very good recipe though. Thanks!

Hey yo, this dish is exceptionally delicious.  I made it for myself on payday and it definitely made me feel like I was worth it.  I used rotini instead of linguini, but that was strictly my preference.  If you like thick sauces like I do, then add a little cornstarch.  The seasoning salt I used was Tony Chachere's, a wonderful seasoning from Louisiana.  Make sure you season your meat real well.  I also added just a couple of drops of Louisiana hot sauce to it to give it a even more authentic cajun taste (I'm from Louisiana so I should know).  Other than that, the recipe was fine as is.  If you like meaty dishes, then you might want to add a little more chicken, but do so only if you prefer a lot of meat.

I have made this many times now, and we LOVE it.  This has become a favorite in the family.  I cube the chicken for easier eating, and experiament with different pastas.  I leave the mix in the pan and let everyone dish the amount they want over the pasta.  I don't have lemon pepper and have never used it in this recipe and it tastes delicious without it.  Sometimes I will omit the mushrooms & onions also.  Thank you for this GREAT recipe!! AWESOME!!!!!!!!!  Will make again & again & again.

Wonderful!  I added extra spices, though, and to cut down on fat used half heavy cream and half skim milk.

My boyfriend always orders this dish when we go out to eat, and he raved that this recipe was better!  I added more cajun seasoning, and instead of two cups heavy cream, I used one cup heavy cream and one cup cheddar/jack shredded cheese.  Excellent!

My fiance loved it and, so did I! I made it more spicy by doubling the cajun seasoning, and then adding some more to the saute. But then we love extra spicy. I will definately make it again.

I looked around for a cajan chicken pasta receipe for a long time and I finially hit the jackpot.  I changed the receipe just slightly by leaving out the mushrooms and adding about 1/2 a cup of american cheese right at the end.  It's a big hit in our family!

tip:  shake the chicken pieces in a Ziploc bag with the Cajun spice and salt.  The butter is a must.  I always begin with a base recipe and change things based on what I have in the kitchen.  Mostly, I was intrigued by the cream sauce with Cajun...so I just cooked the chicken with the Cajun spice and salt for about 10 min. then added in one diced yellow onion (no green onions on-hand), 2 garlic cloves, a bunch of kale, half a red pepper, and then used just half cup of skim milk and mixed in 1 Tbsp of corn starch to thicken it up.  I also didn't have pasta so I served it over jasmine rice.  The entire family gobbled it right up.  I know, it's not what the recipe called for...but I can tell from the spice mixture that it would be delicious on its own.  However, I think 1 1/2 cups of cream is a lot of liquid.  I would suggest trying just 1 cup and then adding in the amount you think is needed.  If serving over rice, it'll just get absorbed perfectly.  If serving over pasta, I think it'll be a tad too much liquid.

I used this recipe as an idea for the items in my pantry.  So ignore the rating (but I did like it) and enjoy the suggestions.  I cooked an onion, two tsp. of jarred garlic, and red bell pepper from my freezer about 5 minutes until onion is translucent.  Added a can of chicken breast, drained, sprinkled with Penzey's Cajun seasoning.  Cooked for two minutes.  Added drained jar of mushrooms.  Cook one minute.  Added can of evaporated milk.  Two tablespoons corn starch, two tablespoons cold water in jar, shake well.  Add to sauce to thicken.  Added pepper, salt, Penzey's smoked sea salt and California sweet basil to taste.  Toss with pasta.  Serve with Italian 6 cheese blend. AWESOME.  Wish I had added the cooked sweet corn but I thought of it too late.

Amazing! We used the frozen peppers and onion. Also added grated Parmesan cheese to the sauce to thicken it up a bit. Wonderful! Definitely a keeper.

Yum, this is good! It also is fast and easy to prepare.  I added a tiny bit of flour to help the sauce thicken, might not have been necessary.  I left out the basil (just didn't have any) and used dried garlic instead of garlic powder (for the same reason, didn't have it).  It was a bit salty for my tastes so I may not add the extra salt next time.  It is good! This will be a regular for my home.

Simple, easy and super yummy. I prepared everything  per the recipe and would only add a bit more cajun spices next time. I could see swutching up the veggies for variances or conveience to what you may have on hand.

Turned out really well with a few adjustments: I seasoned the chicken with a good amount of cajun seasoning, a little cayenne, garlic powder and basil and let it hang out while I cut all the veggies. I sauteed the chicken but 2 chicken breast halves looked too much for the dish so I took some out (I made 3/4 of a 16oz bag of brown rice penne). I then added some garlic and the veggies: 1 medium red onion, mushrooms (next time I'll cut them thicker), and one red bell pepper (next time I'll throw that in a little bit before the rest of the veggies). I sprinkled in about 3 tablespoons of flour and cooked it a bit. Then deglazed with some white wine and then the cream and some milk. Next time I'll use like only a 1/2 cup of cream because the sauce thickened up nicely because of the roux so I would use evaporated milk or half & half and milk. I kept seasoning with cajun seasoning, basil, salt and pepper. I didnt have lemon pepper so I just added lemon juice from half a lemon. At the very end I added about 3/4 bag of baby spinach and some pasta water to thin out the sauce and finally some parmesan cheese.

MADE THIS FOR DINNER TONIGHT AND IT WAS EXTREMELY SALTY!! I FOLLOWED THE RECIPE TO THE EXACT....I RECOMMEND NOT ADDING ANY SALT DUE TO THE CAJUN SEASONING HAS ALOT OF SALT ALREADY IN IT (WICH MY BRAND DID...LOUISIANNA) PLUS THE PARMESAN IS SALTY. IF I MAKE THIS AGAIN I WOULD MAKE MY OWN CAJUN SPICE TO HELP ELIMANATE THE SALT !!

This is delicious.  I served this over spaghetti squash since I cut out grains.  The only thing that got this 4 stars instead of 5 is that I put in a full tablespoon of cajun seasoning and it needs more!  I think next time instead of just putting it on the chicken, I'll do that and then add some to the heavy cream once I've poured it into the pan.

Great recipe but I changed a few things: 

1- I cooked the sauce (cream & parm cheese) seperatly so it becomes thicker 

2- I added vilada onions (instead of green) 

3- I coated the chicken with the cajun and added some flour 

4- Added a little golden sugar while cooking chicken and veggies

My husband loved it and it will be part of our weekdays meals! 

Thanks!

Just finished eating this and my husband and I both give it four stars. I would say it's restaurant quality for sure. The best part is it's very simple to make. At first I was a bit worried because the ingredient list is a bit long and it just seemed intimidating. Well I couldn't have been more wrong because it was totally simple and pretty quick to make. I used a little more heavy cream to use up my carton and I also added some cornstarch to thicken it up because it was a little on the thing side to me. Another change I'd be sure to make is to use more linguine. I doubled what the recipe asked for and still could've used more. Next time I think I'll add more veggies too. I will be making this for both company and regular week night dinners in the future. Thanks for a great recipe!

Ok, the "sauce" isn't much of a sauce, mostly just heavy cream with a few spices added. The sauce stayed very thin, even after bringing to a boil. Wasn't worth it for as much fat as is in this recipe! It tasted fine, just not our fav!

My boyfriend loved this meal! I did, however, Change a few ingredients:
*Cayenne pepper in place of cajun seasoning
* Used precooked garlic chicken and added it to the sauce after the veggies
*sauted the green onion first in butter than added mushrooms & peppers
*used half and half instead of the heavy cream

Gave it 4 out of5 only because I had to add more Cajun seasoning because I love lots of flavour, but otherwise this recipe is amazing! I also made a white sauce with soy milk instead of adding half and half to reduce fat and to make it vegan! (used fake chicken too!) Very tasty, a new favourite!

I thought this was pretty good.  Definitely used more that 4 oz of pasta!  My teenage son absolutely loved it.  He would have rated it 5 stars.  I made it exactly as stated, except adding additional pasta.  I would add more cajun seasoning next time and possibly less cream.  I don't think we needed quite so much.

Delicious!  I took the advice of another reviewer and used a rotisserie chicken shredded up and a bag of frozen onions and peppers.  It was so yummy.  We loved it!

This recipe has a good texture and presentation but the cajun flavor was to strong for my taste.

I thought this was really good!  The only thing I did differently was add a little parmesan at the end to thicken the sauce.  Thanks!

This was great. I actually had the oven on for something else so I roasted some yellow onion slices with the peppers with some olive oil on them and then added them to the chicken later. We will be making this again.

Very good, and I'm adding to the family favorites. However, next time I'll use less pepper. There is already pepper in the lemon pepper, plus probably some in the cajun seasoning. With all of that, we found this dish overpowered by the pepper taste. I used bowtie pasta instead of linguini and it looked like a restaurant dish; plus, much easier to stir together with the sauce. I didn't have any green onion so I used half a white onion. I also minced three garlic cloves and added that in after the veggies had mostly cooked down. I actually think I'll double the garlic next time. This sauce is just begging to be garlicky, and the powder just isn't enough. I stirred in about 1 1/2 tblsp. corn starch with the heavy cream before pouring it into the pan, and that made for a rich and thick sauce. I used some leftover grilled chicken that I cut into strips, and it was delicious. Needs more salt than what is called for, depending on how much extra Parmesan you want to add. The mushrooms are a definite must-- baby bella, if you can.

My husband went bananas over this recipe. I didn't care for the peppers in this sauce, even though I usually love peppers. But otherwise, the flavors were great.

This was an awesome recipe and one of the best dishes I've ever made.  It's definitley a keeper!  However, I had to convert it to feed 4 people and it called for 3 cups of heavy cream.  Thatwas way too much!  it made the sauce runny, but we were able to sop it up with the garlic bread!  Other than that it was fantastic!  I will make it again except I plan to add garlic and sun dried tomatoes and use a little less cream.

Way too much cream!  I made a double batch (I like to have leftovers) and 3 cups of cream makes this more of a soup; I even tried adding cornstarch to thicken, but to no avail.  I'll probably make it again, maybe add some carrots. I'll definitely use much less cream or use orzo instead of linguine, and just add it last to absorb some of the liquid.

This recipe was everything I hoped it would be! I used some shortcuts mentioned by the first reviewer (used frozen onions and peppers, skipped the mushrooms) and this was still restaurant worthy...no kidding. Thanks Tammy Schill!

YUM!!  I made a few minor changes such as using 2 T of Tony Chachere on the chicken before cooking, added some sliced smoked sausage, red/orange/yellow peppers and fresh broccoli.  It was very savory, spicy and will make it again!

This, as it is, was just okay for me.  I feel like it has tremendous potential, but it was just a little off.  First and foremost, I would change the noodle from linguini to penne or farfalle.  It seems like it would be a much better accompaniment to the flavors.  I almost doubled the spices and it still didn't have enough kick to it.  Perhaps it was the particular cajun seasoning I used (Emeril's Bayou Blast) but something was definitely missing.  I will try and add Tabasco if I make it again.  I also think using grilled chicken would make this dish much better and would make the flavor of the chicken really stand out.  Overall, just okay.

I was really excited about this but I am happy I taste tested as I cooked. This would have been a bland soupy mess if I hadn't added to it. Sorry, just not for us. If I'm going to eat something that fattening I'd want it to be worth it... anyways, to pass it off as something I was proud to serve I added a very heavy hand  to all spices including coating the chicken in the cajun spices. I had to also add a corn starch flurry at the end...just not worth the effort

This is a fantastic dish.  If you want to WOW your guest, this is it.  I was raised in the south, a small town above New orleans. Here is my secret.  Cut up your chicken into 1 inch chunks, put into a ziplock bag. add Paul Prudhommes poultry magic. cover the meat generously.  put in frig for several days.  massage the meat often, to mix the seasoning with the meat.

As I made this tonight, my husband kept commenting on how "fancy" it looked. It looks like a lot of work, but by using the frozen pepper/onion suggestion, it was a breeze. It was cooking hot within 15 minutes. As a working mom, that's timing I appreciate! Oh, and the flavor was superb. (The sauce was a little thin...will try to use cornstarch next time.)

This was a fantastic dish.  My husband and I love spicy dishes so I added a little crushed red pepper to add some more flavor.  I served it over angel hair.  I have been using all recipes for some time and this dish actually made me leave my first review.  Enjoy!

Very tasty,  followed the recipe more or less exactly.  DO NOT over cook your chicken, next time I may cook through then remove from the pan adding back in at the end.  Also, don't even think about saving for leftovers,  as with most cream sauce....

Absolutely delicious!  The only alterations I had were to add about a half cup of chopped yellow onion and used half and half instead of whipping cream to cut the fat/calorie content. Also, I sauteed the peppers and onion before hand set aside to omit the water from them in the sauce. I used Tony's Creole seasoning mixed with cayenne pepper and it was plenty seasoned with the other seasonings...no need to add salt. Can't wait to try it with shrimp or andouille sausage!

My husband and I liked this recipe is.  Will use a little less salt next time.  The butter + salt made it a little too salty.

While it may be putsy, I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, rubbed them with the Cajun seasoning and grilled them. I cut them into strips and layered them with the pasta, sauteed asparagus and red onion.  AWESOME!  This recipe is so versatile that you can just toss in whatever vegetables you like.

This is a great recipe!  It is so easy and I find it fun to make.  I doubled the recipe and it easily fed 6.  I do feel it needed more cajun seasoning, but that is personal prefrence.  Overall I felt all the ingredients played well together.  Mushrooms seemed like they didn't belong, but they added a texture that would be missed.  Very good, definitely a keeper!

Delicious!!  The only change I made was to stir the parmesan into the sauce instead of sprinkling it over the top.  It made the sauce a bit thicker that way.  So fast and easy to make, I will make this again!

I diced the red peppers & chicken, and used olive oil instead of butter.  I also added minced garlic instead of powder and pepper flakes.  Instead of green peppers I used peas to maintain the colorful presentation...yum!!  Also, I added a little corn starch to the sauce to thicken it up and only 1 cup of heavy cream.

Excellent.  I have made this three times now and feel I have it down pat.  I used bow tie pasta the last two times and found I liked it even better.  I omit the mushrooms.  Definitely a keeper!

I've made this for the second time. Its is MUCH better with penne pasta..which absorbs more of the sauce. Still a great recipe!

Absolutely fantastic! I followed the advice of LESLEYSALYER and used 1 T of flour and 2% milk rather than the heavy cream. Used leftover grilled chicken, sliced it thin and added to the sauce. Added steamed broccoli rather than green peppers. Will be making again!

This is very tasty.  I replaced shallots for the green onions (a personal taste preference).  If you want green onions I would only use the white portion during cooking and then use the greens as garnish at the end.  Cooked green onion tops tend to be bitter and effect overall flavor.   I also used used real garlic (one clove) pressed in place of powder and added it with the onions.  I found the cajun flavor a little light so I added extra cajun after the cream to my desired taste.  I also added double the amount of parmesan while it was still in the pan to help thicken the sauce.

Pretty good. Boyfriend and roommates loved it though. I'm not a huge pasta person but it was pretty good. However, You do not need to use Heavy Cream. I used Land O'Lakes Fat Free Half and Half milk and that tasted great. No need for the extra fat and calories! I even used fat free butter! And you really don't need as much milk in it. Just make sure to let pasta simmer for a while so sauce can thicken.

We used Porcini mushrooms soaked in warm water for half an hour then sauteed with the peppers. Also I felt that a little more Cajun spice and a little less cream (or maybe thinner cream) might help it next time. Very good though - will be eating it again!

I recently ate at a popular restaurant and had cajun chicken pasta. I then became obsessed with finding a recipe. I came across this in the allrecipes cookbook and was delighted! It came out great accept for the sauce. I thought it would be thicker. I did add more cajun seasoning and I refrigerated the sauce so it would thicken. I only refrigerated it for 30 mins. I loved this dish and I will definately be makingit again!!

This recipe was really good.  It was easy, fast, and good for company.  Very easy to tweak to your likings.  Pretty healthy if you cook chicken in olive oil and substitute something lighter for the heavy cream.  I tossed the pasta with herbs and olive oil and made a bit more sauce.  It wasn't soupy at all and I received many compliments.

Absolutely delicious!  I doubled the recipe and used 1 12 oz can fat free evaporated milk plus 1/2 cup half and half with a T. of cornstarch mixed in instead of the cream and cooked the chicken in olive oil to make it healthier.  The spices were perfect...we all loved it!

Fantastic recipe!! I've made this two times now and just love it. I add extra cajun seasoning for an extra zip, and use two cups heavy whipping cream. I also let it simmer for about 30-45 minutes with the parmesean cheese so that sauce thickens up.

I seasoned the chicken really well with salt, pepper, cayenne, garlic powder, poultry seasoning, and lemon pepper.  After cooking the chicken/vegis, I squeezed 1/2 a lime over everything and added 1/2 a cup of cream and about 1/4 up of chicken broth and let it cook for a couple of minutes.  Once it thickened and heated through I tossed in the pasta and served.  This dish tasted really great and wasn't too heavy like cream pastas usually are.

Wow - what a great recipe.  Quick and easy enough for supper for the family but so tasty that I can't wait to share it with friends.  I used 4 chicken breasts (hubby loves chicken), increased the cajun seasoning to 3 tsp and replaced the cream with evaporated milk to lower the fat content. There was still plenty of sauce and I literally licked my plate clean! (When unobserved, of course!)

This is one of the best recipes I have tried on this site! I have already made it twice, and gonna making it again tonight. Like the other reviewer's the only thing I changed is I added more spice, instead of 2 tsp of Cajun seasoning I added 2 tablespoons in addition to more cayenne pepper then add the cajun seasoning to the sauce instead of the salt and pepper.  Also I find that there is no need to add flour or corn starch (which changes the flavor anyway) to thicken, the starch in the pasta will thicken it if you allow it to sit for a few min before serving.

Great recipe!  I added this dish to my recipe box back in 2002.  It's still great today!  Sometimes, I substitute shrimp for chicken and it's just as good.  I had to add more cajun seasoning than the recipe suggests.  I used Tony Chachere's Original Creole Seasoning.  Try it with artichokes.  Had a similar dish on Bourbon.

Great recipe!  I made a few alterations - marinated the chicken for four hours, used 4 cups of cream for 16 servings (recalculated recipe asked for 12!!), used 1 tbs corn starch to thicken the sauce a bit.  Though I reduced the amount of cream, there was plenty of sauce because of the liquid exuded from the veggies.  Served with salad and some crusty french bread and it was a huge hit.  Be generous with the cajun seasonings on the chicken because it ends up flavoring everything else too!

This is one of my favorite recipes now!  I love fixing it when we have guests come over for dinner.  Excellent flavor- I still need to figure out how to get the sauce a bit thicker.  I added cornstarch last time and that seemed to help.

After reading the reviews, I thought this recipe would be better but I was disappointed.  Maybe it was the cajun spice I used, but the recipe didn't have as much pizzazz as I would have liked, seemed a little bland to me.

Holy Good Stuff!!!  This was great.  For veggies - I only used red pepper and mushrooms and just doubled the amount to make up for the green pepper and onion I left out.  I added 6 TBS. (yike!! but it made the difference) to the sauce.  If it looks runny - wait!  Take it off the heat while your cooking the noodles and it will thicken on it's own.  By the time you add the noodles to toss - the sauce will be thick and be reheated from the heat of the noodles.  WE LOVED THIS SO MUCH!! Thanks!

Great recipe, my whole family loves it!  I used half-and-half instead of cream, and cut it down to one and a half cups, otherwise there's way too much sauce.  other than that, it's a terrific dish and we've had it several times!

This recipe was very good, however, I did make some changes.  When I cooked the chicken, I used 5 tablespoons of butter (I know, too much fat, but you only live once!!!) and put some extra cajun spice in the pan, which created a paste, which in turn, thickened the sauce without the use of cornstarch or flour.  I increased the cream to two cups and omitted the lemon pepper and basil--I have numerous Cajun recipes, and none of them call for these spices, so I left them out.  I also omitted the vegetables and increased the amount of chicken.  I served it with dinner rolls and had a wonderful meal!  I will definitely make this again!!

My husband and I really enjoyed this one. We love spicy food so we kicked it up a knotch on the seasonings. It was perfect with a salad and breadsticks.

This is delicious, even my toddler likes it (I substitute a small amount of milk in place of the cream).  I also cut up the chicken.

Basically quadrupled it to feed four at the fire station. I added a little more spice for extra heat. A very good meal along with the garlic knots bread.

Excellent!  Excellent!! The only thing is the serving size is too small and I am leary about doubling the recipe because I know some things don't turn out as good! But I would highly recommend! !

I made this, following the recipe exactly, except for adding some corn starch to thicken up the sauce. My husband really liked it, and I liked the Cajun flavor on the chicken. Next time I am going to add some kielbasa, and an additional bell pepper!

Excellent flavor. I followed the recipes ingredients then added 2 T cornstarch to thicken the sauce. It was so good and everyone loved it. Definitely added to my recipe box for future use.

Followed the recipe exactly as written, except for adding a small amount of cornstarch to the Cajun spice before tossing in the chicken. It helped to thicken the sauce in the end. It was, by far, the best pasta dish I've ever made....and I've made quite a few. Thank you SO MUCH for this recipe!

This was delish! Hubs loves this meal at O Charleys and it was my first time making it. Personally I found that there was too much bell pepper for my taste. . But other than that this meal is one I'm passing down and plan to make at least once a month.

After I made this and my girlfriend took the first bite she turned to me and said, "oh this isn't healthy at all is it?"  Who cares! This meal was SO good it's going be a monthly splurge meal for sure.

REALLY good! I used a whole pepper instead of one cup, or whatever was called for. Extra mushrooms too. We also sprinkled with extra parmesan before served.

Yummy!!! For thicker sauce, omit heavy cream and add 1/2 cup creamy goat cheese or cream cheese. Blend it into the sauce with a spoon. Allrecipes.com has a great Cajun spice recipe. Next time I will add other veggies listed in other reviews.

Very yummy! Made it with half and half because it was what I had on hand and it came out delicious! Just added some sautéed Cajun shrimp at the very end because I love shrimp with all those great flavors.

This was the best pasta I've ever made!   My family loved it.  The only thing I changed was use fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  Can't wait to make this for my son & daughter-in-law.  I know they will love it too.

Not only was this super easy for this talent-challenged cook, but it was really really great.  i did not change anything in the recipe other than to add more veggies than it called for.  Had to throw in some corn starch to get the sauce to thicken, but the taste was fantastic.  Will definitely make this one again.

Delicious! I simply changed two things to make it a healthier dish - I used chicken that I simmered in broth (by skipping the butter I saved 200 calories right there) and Almond Milk (30 calories per cup!)for the cream and this dish was still superb!

We loved this--I used boneless skinless chicken thighs instead of breast because we prefer them. I also used half & half instead of heavy cream and a lot more mushrooms(we love them!). The only change I will make next time is to leave out the basil,  my husband doesn't care for it. Other than that, it's quick, easy and a nice change.

I love this dish! I also made cajun spice from scratch. It's hard to find onion powder in Thailand thou. So i just used fresh onion instead. It came out good. Guess i will have to make this dish again!

I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out wonderfully.  I will make this many more times I am sure.  A lot of people are saying it isn't spicy enough.  I would say that is caused by not using the correct Cajun seasoning.  I used the Slap Ya Mama seasoning in the yellow container and it turned out plenty spicy.  Rather than adding a thickening agent, I just put the linguine in the large skillet directly and let it sit for a bit.  This worked perfectly and can't wait to make this again.

Read several reviews for short cuts and cut calories – husband ate two plates full – this is in the ‘Tom will eat’ list of meals!! I did use juice of a lemon to get by with as little salt as possible. (Very picky eater husband!)

I assumed that "Cajun Seasoning" meant the jar in the spice aisle labeled as such. As a result I ended up with a salty mess - that packaged seasoning is mostly salt. 

Next time I make this, I will just add in the spices that make up the Cajun seasoning and leave out most of the salt. Cayenne pepper, onion powder, oregano, and thyme would be ample seasoning and keep it "cajun".

This is a great base recipe, although I found that the sauce recipe as called for is way too soupy. I ended up adding about 1 Tbsp. of flour to get it to thicken up a bit. I actually had some zucchini on hand that tasted very good in this recipe. It's a winner in this house!

This is delicious. I have make it just like the recipe calls for, minus the mushrooms because the boyfriend doesn't like them. Adding shrimp is also very yummy. Wish it didn't have so many calories, therefore definitely a rare treat.

I'm sure this would have been fabulous if I hadn't substituted half the heavy cream with nonfat yogurt. The sauce was a little thin, and consequently didn't stick to the pasta the way I would have liked.  I do not keep lemon pepper in my pantry as it seems to go rancid more quickly than I can use it, so I added some freshly ground coriander seeds which did give the dish additional dimension.

We really liked this.  I had no idea what I was going to make for dinner.  I opened the frig and saw that the only meat I had thawed out was some of those already cooked grilled chicken strips (which I had bought intending to use on top of a salad) . . . somehow I stumbled upon this recipe, and I had MOST of the ingredients in my frig in one form or another to throw this together quickly for my hungry family.  I used red, yellow & orange peppers that I had grilled and frozen.  I only had about 1/2 of a cup of cream on hand, so I just threw in some skim milk until I had the right amount of sauce.  I also used fresh basil (which I have so much of right now).  Everyone really liked it.  My son was having a friend sleep over, and he had dinner with us and he kept saying how good it was.  I literally had this together in 20 minutes.  Now that's a quick weeknight dinner!  Served it with some crusty bread - yum!

This is my favorite recipe I've ever made on this website!!! And my favorite dish in general. Instead of linguine I use penne noodles. And I use a red onion instead of green.

To cut fat and calories, I used 3/4 C half & half and 3/4C milk in place of the heavy cream.  Came out wonderful and I didn't miss the fat!  I also skipped the mushrooms due to family preference...  Yummy!

I LOVED this. I made a few adjustments as I am a spice fanatic and like my food hot! In addition, I didn't have all of the ingredients in my kitchen like the peppers. I did have fresh mushrooms and basil and that was truly nice. Also, I sauteed the chicken with garlic. Lastly, I didn't have cajun seasoning so I used the Google Machine and and found a great recipe which was great to throw together: http://kitchensimplicity.com/cajun-seasoning/. YUMMERS! I would have given the recipe a 4.5 if possible, but I didn't feel it deserved a 4. THANK YOU for posting this!

This recipe is really great, although I did make some changes. For the cajun seasoning, I recommend just making this recipe (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/cajun-spice-mix-2/detail.aspx), and using the whole amount that that recipe yields. I wound up using one red and one yellow pepper, didn't use mushrooms or green onion (and just used regular onions instead), and replaced the heavy cream with 2% milk, some flour and some parmesan cheese. For cooking, I first sauteed the onions and peppers until almost done, added the garlic, then added half of the chicken directly to the veggies. After the first batch of chicken was done, I took everything out of the pan and cooked the second half of the chicken. Then I added the milk, flour, and parmesan and scraped all the brown bits off of the bottom until I got a thicker sauce. I didn't even bother adding the basil, lemon pepper, salt, etc, because the sauce was already super flavorful from cooking the chicken in the cajun seasoning. Tossed it all in a bowl and it was amazing!

Made this for dinner last night and we really enjoyed it; however, it really needs more cajun seasoning for our palates.  If you don't like spicy, these proportions should be alright for you.  I did not add the parmesan because I don't think of it as a cajun ingredient and it tasted great without it.  I'm half Italian and I use plenty of parmesan in other dishes.  One tip on the thickening:  if you sprinkle about a Tbs of flour over the veg when they are just about done and stir it around a minute, then add your liquid (I used 1/2 cup heavy cream and 1 cup 2% milk) it will blend and thicken perfectly and won't make the dish taste floury.  Use this method for soups too when you are sauteing your veg (don't tell me you just put them in raw! :-{).  I also used a bag of frozen peppers and onions which I defrosted, drained and blotted on a paper towel to get the extra moisture out; also added fresh sliced garlic in the saute (no garlic powder here! What's up with garlic powder anyway?  I don't get why so many people use it instead of fresh--if you put it through a garlic press, it melts into the dish.)   Can't wait to make this for friends!

DELICIOUS!!!!!! I made this recipe for valentines day, it was absolutely AMAZING!!! I used the measurements for the seasoning as more of a guideline ( adding more garlic powder and cajun seasoning), I also added 1/2 cup white wine ( I think that's what really made the dish) and a little bit of flour to thicken the sauce. All my husband can talk about is how impressed he was with this meal and how he wants more, however it is very high in calories, so it's going to stay a "special occasion" meal. If you love a ton of flavor, there's no way you will be disappointed with this dish! Happy cooking!!!!!

My family enjoyed this recipe. I didn't use as much heavy cream and didn't have any mushrooms but it still turned out great. I think though that if I make this again I will cut down on the lemon peper seasoning. I think that it gave it a weird taste that would have made it better without. Thanks.

Fantastic recipe.  I used a whole box of linguine and used a whole carton of whipping cream.  I also used an extra chicken breast.  Made great left overs!  Will be using this recipe for a long time.  Family and friends loved it and very easy to make!  Also, let the sauce develop.  Cook it low and slow and continue to taste until you have it perfect!  I also garnish with come diced tomato (uncooked).  You can also make a variation and serve this with shrimp over grits instead of linguine.  Shrimp and Grits garnished with diced tomato is to die for!

Delicious, and a totally fun spin on an otherwise boring pasta night!  I added a can of diced tomatoes to the veggies as they were simmering as well as a few healthy shakes of garlic salt  and cayenne pepper before I served this dish.  This is a KEEPER!!!

When I read the recipe, it really didn't sound good but after reading the reviews decided to try it. I had most of the ingredients on hand except the mushrooms, so went for it. Well I have to say, it was absolutely delicious. My husband loved it even though he is not a big fan of chicken. I had a little leftover for lunch but would have liked to have more. It was just as good reheated. I will make this many more times but will add the mushrooms. Great recipe!

AMAZING RECIPE. The cream made it extremely runny so all I did was add a little flour and then it was perfect. I accidentally added way too much basil and it still came out amazing. Double the recipe because you will want leftovers!

Wanted to try something different for dinner and saw this. I'm not the worlds greatest cook and boy was this an easy recipe! I didn't measure out any of the spices, just did them to taste.. and I'm sure I used WAY more than 2 tsps of cajun seasoning...

I made this for dinner tonight  & it was very very yummy!! Next time I make this I will double it. I used a rotisserie chicken and just added some cajun seasoning and sauteed for a couple mins. I also used a bag of frozen peppers which included red, yellow, and green peppers (this was suggested by others who made this recipe before).  Next time I will add more mushrooms because we really enjoy them and they were yummy in the pasta.  Definitely will be making again.

Loved this recipe! 
I'm a college student, so I changed a few things. Instead of adding 1 1/2 cups of heavy cream, I added 3/4 cup cream 3/4 cup 2 percent milk. It was cheaper to buy the smaller bottle of cream, plus, cutting down on the cream cuts down on calories. Also, I only put in one whole green pepper and placed this in a bowl with the green onions and sprinkled a little bit of lemon juice over the top. I tossed it, and then put it all in with my sizzling chicken and the cream. DELICIOUS!! 
I highly recommend this recipe! My boyfriend and I really enjoyed it. Thankyou Tammy for sharing! :):)

I definitely reccomend: #1 Add more cajun seasoning, the dish didn't taste like cajun at all. #2 brown the sausage and pepers and onion in a seperate pan before adding to poatoes, my potates got really mushy because I kept flipping/moving the skillet to get the sausage and peppers to brown/cook. 3. definitly add chicken broth to potatoes, it gave a wonderful flavor. 4.Mix a tsp of cornstarch with a little water and then add to sauce to get it to thicken up a bit.
  Overall, it was Really Yummy and my boyfriend and I slurped up the last drop in our bowls! Will definitley make again!

This dish was great!! It reminded me of the cajun chicken and shrimp pasta they make at Friday's, but WAY better. I did add extra cajun seasoning and about a tablespoon of flour to the sauce to make it a little thicker. I also added the parm cheese while cooking the sauce. Will def make again.

This was good, but nothing I'd make often. I substitued fat-free half and half, and marinated the chicken in KC Masterpiece Cajun Marinate instead of using powdered cajun seasoning. It was a bit hot for me, so I think I'd reduce the pepper next time. I also wish I'd sauted the peppers and mushrooms a bit longer. Hubby wasn't impressed by this one.

Spectacular! The only thing I changed (because I didn't have heavy cream on hand) was that I used a small carton of half and half and some milk and thickened it with cornstarch and a little flour.

I love this recipe it is soo good! I usually do about 3/4 heavy whipping cream and about 1/4 regular milk and add a little corn starch. I also only use mushrooms since I do like all the other stuff in there. I add about a teaspoon of lemon pepper, garlic powder and cayenne pepper and it turns out delicious every time!

This was awesome! My family of 8 are picky eaters and they loved it.  I used less cream than they instructed and added 2 teaspoons of flour to the cream to make it thicker. I also used less peppers and onions. I will make this again.

I made it VEGAN (probably half the fat!) and it was soooo good! I used original coconut milk creamer and just added some corn starch until it was creamy. Without having the chicken, I will definitely add more peppers and mushrooms next time - 2 red and 2 green & 6 baby bellas. I think I will try angel hair pasta next time too. I made my own cajun seasoning from another recipe on this site and added some extra  to the sauce as per other reviewers suggestions. Other than that, I stuck to the recipe and it was outstanding! I just ate some for lunch and it's even good cold the next day :) 

I can't wait to make this again!

Made this tonight!  Family was very happy with it.  The only thing I did different was, I grilled my chicken with cajun seasoning and then I cut it up and put it in with the peppers.   I also added some red pepper flakes at the end for a little more heat.  Will make again.

Delicious & easy pasta dish. I skipped the ckn and used a veggie medley (broccoli, asparagus, mushrooms, onions, red pepper, peas) I doubled Cajun seasoning and some of the herb (I like lots of flavor in my sauce), used half milk & half heavy cream, added a few splashes of Tabasco sauce, and used a blend of Swiss & Parmesan cheese....came out very good! I will definitely make this again!

My boyfriend and I adore this! I even made it for a dinner party and it was a huge hit! The only thing I do differently is add some chicken broth/stock to the sauce to give it a heartier, more rounded out flavor. Just plain cream is a bit too rich for me!

Best dish my husband has ever made!! For Vday this year we wanted to keep it simple and avoid the crazy restaurants and always love this dish when I go out so I requested for him to make it at home. It was incredible!! Definately one of my favorites and I will be making it a lot more often. I just wish I could find a healthier way to make it...

Very tasty. Much like what I've had in restaurants. Just wish the sauce was a little thicker. I'll probably think of ways to use less cream as well, for health reasons.

This is my husband's favorite recipe on this site, so I make it at least once a month. I typically use 1 bell pepper chopped small, 1.5 tbs of Cajun seasoning, and mix 2 tsp of cornstarch in 1 cup of half-n-half before adding to the pan. Oh, boil your pasta water while chopping, I always forget to do this and screw up the timing... :-)

Just made this tonight and it was really good! We used angel hair pasta and a frozen bag of bell peppers (you couldn't even taste the difference). I added about 2 tsp of corn starch to the sauce to thicken and everyone loved it!

Corn starch is a must! I am a beginner and have made this 3 times. The first two times I made it without corn starch and it was way too runny. Third time was a charm.

I used half and half to try to be healthier, and the sauce ended up being kind of thin at first. I wasn't sure if it was because I used half and half, but after letting it simmer it for awhile and adding some corn starch, it thickened ... needed to add additional cajun seasoning and salt than called for, too (just taste as you go to make sure there's enough).  Next time I cook this, I'd cut the bell peppers smaller and add broccoli and cauliflower to make it even healthier. I want to see if it still tastes good with less butter too .. Note to self: try cooking with 2 tb of butter instead of 3! Or substitute for veggie oil and see if you can tell the difference taste-wise ... 'cause I think my stomach hurts a bit from the butter overload :(  This is a good base recipe for cajun pasta. It came out pretty good overall, very flavorful but not AMAZING restaurant quality. Then again, I feel like even with restaurant pasta, it's hard to be like WOW about it.

The flavor of the sauce created by this recipe is very tasty - rich with notes of spice.  I added broccoli to the recipe and used a whole red bell pepper.  But the sauce did come out quite thin, even after I let it reduce a whole lot.  I know a lot of reviewers said that they used cornstarch to thicken it but I hate the taste that cornstarch brings to a recipe.  So while the flavor is quite nice, it's too thin for my preference.

This was REALLY good. It looked a mess as my presentation wasnt much, but it tasted FANTASTIC. Creamy and comforting, but spicy and not-your-average-dinner. I recommend (presentation wise) to remove the chicken when cooking and adding it on top of the pasta/sauce after. I think it would look nicer. So good and easy!

Excellent recipe! Even using evaporated milk (plus 1-2T cornstarch to thicken) in place of the heavy cream, it was delcious! Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly... great blend of flavors and the vegetables were cooked perfectly for this recipe following the times specified. This makes more than two servings! Probably closer to four, depending upon how much you eat, of course. Wonderful--not too spicy! Would be a good dish for company. Oh--I guess I did serve it with Farfalle... =)

I've made this twice and think it is pretty good.  It needs extra parmesan though.  If you don't love spicy food, then you should also be careful with this recipe!

This really deserves at least 10 stars!  Great is not even the word!  This is one of the best dishes that I've ever tasted!  Yes, it's that good.  I use shrimp instead of chicken and I also use bow tie pasta.  To thicken the sauce I just add a little corn starch or flour.  It will do the trick.  Thank you so much for this recipe!  I love it!

I absolutely HAVE to make this dish twice a week for my New Orlean's born husband, and a double batch at that, so he can heat it up for lunch at work the next day. I use Tony's Chacheres seasoning and make it exactly as the recipe calls, except for leaving out the mushrooms, and it is AWESOME. This pasta is to die for!

This dish reminds me of one of my favorite OBX restaurant dishes called "Alligator Pasta".  I was able to lighten it up a bit by using olive oil instead of butter, substituting whole wheat pasta and fat free Half & Half.  I took the advice of other reviewers and thickened the sauce with cornstarch.  I added some minced garlic and more cajun seasoning.  I also added some pepper flakes and hot sauce. (I love spicy/hot food!)  To cut prep time, I used 1 frozen bag of sliced multicolored peppers and onions.  I also used the pre-cooked Tyson chicken strips.  I tossed in 1 diced tomato (seeds removed) right before serving.  This tastes just as good (if not better) the day after!  (I had some for breakfast!!)  Try this - you won't be disappointed!

Finally! A true restaurant quality dish.
I mean it. It will surprise you. I didn't have the half & half or whatever it called for, so instead I used 1 1/2 cup 1% milk heated on the stove top with 1/2 stick of butter. Then after adding it to the chicken (which I coated with a little flour mixed with the cajun season) I added some water mixed with a little corn starch while boiling. It thickened right up! I used orange bell peppers instead of green. I trippled the green onion to 3. I used 3 chicken breasts instead of 2. I also added minced garlic with the veggies as well. I am so happy with this recipe & it was quite easy to do.

Awesome recipe. Like other reviewers, I used fat free half and half to lower the calorie content.  I used a little corn starch to thicken and it turned out delicious. I agree with those who said this is restaurant quality.  It is very simple to make and would be great to serve company.  I used red peppers like the recipe called for because they were on sale.  Usually they are too expensive but I must say that the red color added to the presentation. Next time I may dice a tomato and serve on top for presentation if red pepper is not available.  Thanks for another addition to my recipe collection.  This is a keeper.

I've made this a few times and have loved it every time.  Tonight I used four chicken breasts, doubled the cajun seasoning, added half an onion, two small tomatoes and some chives.  Besides that I followed the recipe and it was delicious!!

Yummy!  I eat this at least once a month!  As with everyone else, I made some changes to it. 

1.  I serve with angel hair pasta or sometimes without any.

2.  I place the cajun spice on a plate and coat.  

3.  I remove the chicken once cooked and add the green/red peppers, onion and extra mushroom to the pan to cook.  Meanwhile, I cut the chicken into bite size pieces and return to the pan.  I don't use the heavy cream.

4.  Serve with the pasta or without, sprinkling with parmesan cheese.  

I ALWAYS get complimented on this dish.  It's pretty good as leftovers too!

My husband liked this one better than I did - I am not really into cream sauces.  To make it a little healthier I substituted olive oil for butter.  I also used suggestions from earlier reviews and cut the heavy cream to 3/4 cup and added 1/2 cup of white wine and 1/2 tbsp of cornstarch.  I also doubled the garlic powder.  My husband requested that this one go into our normal rotation.  UPDATE:  I used fat free milk and cornstarch instead of heavy cream and it didn't augment the flavor at all.

This was so incredibly delicious!!  We didn't have any linguine, so used penne; which I think worked better as the penne could soak up more of the sauce.  Used a fellow reviewer's cajun seasoning recipe (yum!).  Used green, red, and yellow peppers, a small regular onion, and no mushrooms.  Instead of cream, added a scant 1/4C of flour to the chicken and veggies, then added skim milk in place of the cream.  Next time I might cut the flour a little as it made a very thick sauce (though we loved it).  Mixed the parmesan into the sauce too.  Next time, I think I would use fresh garlic and cook with with the chicken, instead of the powder.

Very good. Just a LITTLE too spicy, as written, for my family, though:will cut the Cajun seasoning to 1-1/2 tsp.next time. The sauce flavor was very good (cream & butter...big surprise!)but I will add more mushrooms and carmelize by themselves in the butter THEN add the peppers & green onion:as I thought the mushrooms were not cooked enough when the peppers were done. The only things I did different was to add, cut up, cooked (boiled in the pasta water) fresh asparagas and I used sweet yellow peppers(& the red)instead of green:which I think paired better, and will do if I make again. I would prefer the chicken cut up smaller/shorter pieces too... and I would add MORE peppers (in strips, for prettier presentation-not chopped) AND I will use penne pasta: just our preferences, so not to use a knife to eat.

I would give this 5 stars because even though we didn't have a lot of the ingrediants it still turned out great!  We used thigh meat, 1 cup milk mixed with 1Tbsp flour, and only the cajun seasoning with 2tbsp parmesan.  We only had mushrooms and onions so we just sauted those.  Turned out great inspite the alterations.

I picked this out and my husband made this tonight on his own.  He didn't have any problems making this and that says a lot!

He made exactly as the recipe calls for except for 2 minor changes based on our indiv preferences:
1. substituted fat free cream for half of the cream in the recipe to trim down on fat
2. used shrimp instead of chicken just because we had chicken for dinner last night

This recipe is awesome just as is folks. No need to go through all of the algorithms posted. Truly.  I added a little red pepper to mine when served to make a bit spicier, and my husband likes milder.  He doesn't like green/red peppers that much and said didn't even notice them.  He chose to include them.

And, we had most of the ingredients on hand.

Great recipe! Thanks. AL

(be sure to have a nice bottle of white wine chilled to accompany)

Excellent!  This is a very tasty, creamy dish!  Since I had super-sized / jumbo chicken breasts, I cooked them in the oven at 400 degrees for 40 minutes instead of browning them and running the risk of having them half-cooked in a skillet. Afterwards, I cut them up in strips 1/2 inch in thickness before putting in the skillet along with the rest of the ingredients.  Instead of linguine, I had fettucini.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as indicated and it turned out absolutely great. I will definitely make this dish again, no doubt about it.  Congratulations to the creator of this recipe!

This is soooo good!!!  One of my favorite dishes that I have made several times.  Family and friends always ask for the recipe.  I changed it to add a pint of half and half and a pint of heavy cream, and 1/2 tsp of the 1/4 ingredients: lemon pepper, salt, etc., 1/4 tsp of the pepper and garlic, AND I add about 1 tsp of red pepper flakes to make it spicier!!! or adjust to make as spicy as you want to.  Definitely worth a try.

Excellent. I just made this for dinner. I did improvise a bit since I didn't have some of the ingredients. I didn't use mushrooms or bell peppers. After I sauteed the chicken, I removed it from the skillet, along with the butter. Then I added a little bit of olive oil, sauteed 2 whole garlic cloves in it for about  minutes. I discarded the garlic, then sauteed the green onions and parsley. After that I followed the recipe as written. Along with the cream, I added some flour to thicken the sauce. Oh yeah and I increased the Cajun-the original amount was definitely not enough for us. Great results!

Amazing! We made the healthier changes (omitted butter, used Pam; omitted cream, used evap skim milk w/ cornstarch to thicken; also used fresh garlic & fresh lemon juice; and added tabasco) and we didn't want to stop eating this! Because of the spiciness, it is very filling and very tasteful. It took us about 30 minutes to cook it, but that was with two of us cooking. However, this dish is worth it. Has most definitely been added to the favorites list. Thank you so much for a great recipe! :-)

We thought this was pretty good.  It did need about 1 1/2 Tblspns of flour to thicken and 1 teaspoon of cajun and a pinch or two of red pepper flakes to spice up the sauce.  Next time I will only use 1/2 green pepper too.  Great recipe, just too many peppers for me.

Excellent recipe!  I did not care for the lemon pepper - will omit next time.  This is a fantastic dish and is very flexible - you could make a ton of variations from it!

This was so good! It tasted just like something from a fine Italian restaurant...but better! I strongly suggest using less heavy cream than the recipe calls for. You don't need that much! And also, after the chicken was done, I removed it from the skillet, cooked my vegetables, added the cream, seasoning, and then I put the chicken back in. This keeps it tender. I added 1/4 white wine and 1 T fresh lemon juice. The flavors were bursting!

My entire family loved this...mom,dad,sister and brother!They all bragged about what a great cook I am (hee hee) I'm not a fan of green bell peppers so I subsituted asparagus for color and used the whole red bell pepper,I used regular whipping cream instead of heavy, and couldnt find cajun so I used blackening season. YUMMY!!

Awesome! Made a few small changes, added two cloves of garlic instead of the powder and before sauteing the chicken and veggies, diced up half a pound of bacon, cooked that first then, sauted the chicken and veg. Delish!

Very delicious recipe. My husband loved it. I followed other reviewers suggestions--and added cauliflower, which was great. I also cooked the chicken with onion. The only disagreement I have is with the 1.5 cups of heavy cream! You do NOT need that much. I used about 3/4 cup, and I doubled the recipe. So, that's my two cents. Otherwise it is fabulous and I will definitely make again! Thank You!

My husband really enjoyed this, however, I thought it was just ok. I made it with half and half and cornstarch to reduce the fat. I'll probably make it again but it won't be on heavy rotation.

What a great dinner!  My husband and I loved this and will definitely make it more often.  The first time I made it, the sauce was way too soupy, so this time, I reduced the cream (I used half and half instead) to 1 1/4 cup and heated it in a separate pan while sauting the chicken and veggies.  While it heated, I mixed 1 T cornstarch with 2 T cold water and added it to the cream.  Thickened it right up!  I highly recommend this meal!!!

LOVED this!! I recently made it for my parents' and they loved it as well. For the cajun seasoning, I used a mixture of Penseys Northwoods Fire and Hot Cajun. I added chopped zuchini, used red & yellow peppers. I also used fat free half & half. I very SLOWLY heated the h & h in another saucepan to a boil. Then sirred in about 2 Tbs. cornstarch, whisking until thickened. I mixed in the seasonings, then added to the skillet, tossed in  spaghetti, and a little parmesan-I figure I saved enough fat to have a little parm! This is an absolute winner & will make it often!

WOW. Made it for my boyfriend who LOVES cajun and he went nuts. I did make a few changes that others had suggested... added some italian sausage, used penne instead of linguine, half & half instead of heavy cream, lemon juice instead of lemon pepper,and real minced garlic instead of the powder. I added a little bit of cornstarch at the end b/c the sauce was thin. I didn't toss it all together at the end, instead I just "spooned" the sauce onto the noodles. Worked great, tasted even better reheated the next day. big YES!!

Very tasty, yumm ! Its a hit ! I used 
light cream instead of heavy cream. It wasnt that spicy thou, so next time  gonna add lil bit chili powder or extra spicy cajun. Also i suggest  using olive oil        over butter. keep it healthy..

I was doubtful at first, but this dish really came through. I used a rough approximation of JEN78RN's recipe for Cajun seasoning: 1 tsp pepper, 1/2 tsp paprika, 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper, and a dash of salt.  I used broccoli instead of mushrooms, and I ended up adding about 3 tsp cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  And it came out pretty darn good! *Really* spicy. :)

This recipe have been a keeper in my kitchen for years. I have doubled the amount of the spices(only the dry spices) added an extra chicken breast, boiled more pasta and is enough for 2 more people. Is incredibly good!!!

My fiance and I travel for a living and joke that we have "eaten our way around the country."  We have well traveled palates and we both LOVED this recipe.  I followed some suggestions by previous posters and 1. added a couple more mushrooms, 2. used just a bit of corn starch to thicken some, 3. used cajun and blackening seasoning, cooked the chicken in the skillet first, then made the sauce as the recipe says, and scraped up the yummy brown bits on the bottom the pan.  It was a very simple recipe and it was AWESOME!!!!  We ate til we were busting open.

Awesome!!  I made this last night for dinner and my hubby just called and said he was going to finish it off for lunch today.  I substituted the chicken for shrimp, added more mushrooms (because we love them!), and a little more salt.  I will definitely make it again, although next time I am going to try it with bowtie pasta.

Very good and tasty ! I am keeping this recipe ! I used homemade pasta, fresh basil, garlic and Parmesan, fresh ground black pepper and i left out the lemon pepper. We like spicy, so I added more cajun seasoning and a touch of chili pepper. I also thickened the sauce.

Ok....first of all if you are looking for light and healthy, this ain't it.  But OH MY GAWD!!!!  This is insanely good!  I didn't change anything, just used fresh garlic and fresh lemon juice.  My cajun seasoning added plenty of salt so I didn't need to add any more.  Then I just added heavy cream until I had as much sauce as I wanted.  You don't need to thicken it at all, especially once you add the pasta.  My husband would not stop eating!!!  SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good.

Yowza!! We used a 16oz box of pasta and doubled everything else (but used 1C of 1% milk instead of more cream) and it was EXCELLENT! I think next time I will leave the cajun at 2tsp, as it was a bit too hot for myself and the 3 young kids. DH loved it as is and will sprinkle extra on his.

This gets a 5 for taste and ease of preparation.  I didn't have lemon pepper so I skipped that but did add fresh lemon juice (which really added to the flavor).  It was a filling meal and one I will be making again and again! Thanks

Although my husband and his friend really seemed to like this recipe, I would have to say that I did not. I followed the directions exactly except I left out the bell peppers (we don't like them) but in the end, the sauce came out WAY too soupy!  To thicken it, I added more pasta (as I made extra just in case) and I added half a container of Alfredo sauce. It still needed a good amount of salt. Also, the chicken didn't come out as tasty as I hoped. Unfortunately, I will probably be asked to make this again sometime in the future. But, in my opinion, it really tasted quite bland and heavy at the same time.

This was pretty good and definitely has potential!  I will completely omit the salt next time.  It was way too salty!  Also, I doubled the sauce, used 3 T of cajun seasoning, and sliced my chicken into cubes which made it very juicy from simmering in the cream.  I also added cornstarch, but I think I added a bit too much because it was just too heavy for me (my fault!!).  Next time, I'll use about 1.5 T of cornstarch.  My husband LOVED this (he usually doesn't like spicy food).  It is fattening but relatively cheap to make... so this will probably go into our rotation :)

Excellent recipe - I have bragged to all of my friends about how delicious this recipe turned out.  It is extremely rich (but in a good way!) - and at first I was fearful that the sauce was too thin.  However, as soon as I added it to the pasta (which I almost doubled in quantity), it did thicken up a bit and came out perfect...make this and enjoy!

I took a chance and made this recipe for the first time last night and had the nerve to invite our neighbors over as taste tasters.  I made small changes.  I doubled the recipe.  I cooked the chicken separately with the cajun seasoning.  I sauteed the veggies as stated, added the butter, then cooked chicken, cream etc.  We all fell out of our seat!!  I will agree with some of the other reviews that the sauce is very thin.  But its important with the cream in my opinion to not boil it as it will take away from the taste of the entire dish.  Rave reviews all around in our household and neighbors!!!!  Brava Tammy!!!!!!!

My husband and I loved this dish, 12yr old didn't (the peppers). Hubby said it was the best pasta I have made in a long time, and we eat pasta a lot. I used a whole red pepper and 1/2 green, instead of the other way around (well chopped), used 2 green onions, let the chicken sit with spices for 2 hours, used 6 ozs. linguine instead of 4 (there was plenty sauce).  I also used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream, doubled the basil and used 2 large cloves minced fresh garlic, which I added when I sauted the chicken. Easy, quick and tasty. Served with steamed asparagus and crusty bread. Will make this again, for sure.  Thanks Tammy!

Tasty and fairly quick. Wife really loves it. I know we sometimes use grilled chicken breasts instead. It has found it's way into our meal rotation.

Very good. I have tried many recipes for cajun chicken pasta. I will definitely add chicken broth or use half and half to use less cream. I added tons of garlic and used yellow onions instead of green.
Update: I made this again and used 1C heavy cream and 1/2c water. I used the peppers, 12oz sliced mushrooms, scallions and used 1 1/2 Tbsp of Cajun seasoning and 1/2 teaspoon of the others!

Since I'm lactose intolerant, I substituted the heavy cream with 3/4 cup of Lactaid skim milk and 1/3 cupmargarine. (that probably cuts down on the fat a lot!) I didn't use mushrooms, and used creole seasoning instead, and it turned out fabulously. This is an excellent recipe.

This is a restaurant quality dish.  I altered it a bit.  It is very soupy so I added about 1 1/2 - 2 TB of flour.  It is spicy, but not five alarm.  To increase the heat,
 I added some red pepper flakes and cayenne pepper.  I also add the cajun seasoning to the sauce as well as the chicken.  Excellent! It is now in my husband's top five dishes.

I followed the recipie exactly, and loved it. Not bland at all. Even though I don't like bell peppers, I wanted to be open minded and used them anyway. I think that next time I will add fewer and cut them larger so that I can remove them before serving. 
I made this last night, and brought  the leftovers to work, and it is even better the second day!

I loved this recipe after I doubled the spices used, and added cayenne pepper as well.  The original recipe wasn't nearly spicy enough for my taste!

My husband said this is one of the best meals that he's had in a long time. I substituted a 1/2 cup of half & half mixed with a jar of Alfredo sauce (portabello & white wine flavored) instead of the heavy cream. I omitted the green pepper and just used one whole red bell pepper. Then I added one can of drained diced tomatoes, and 1 tbsp. of flour. This dish is divine!

This was great! My whole family enjoyed it, and it is very easy to prepare. I did use a lot more cajun seasoning after reading other reviews. Great recipe!!

My family loves this recipe and asks me to make it all the time. If you make your own cajun seasoning, you can adjust how spicy you want it. I didn't have cream the first time I made it, so I used alfredo sauce instead and it was still very delicious.

Very good!  I followed the advice of other reviews and substituted the cream with light sour cream.  Still came out very good!  I did not use te green pepper (do not like the taste.)  I used yellow peppers in place of the green.  Be warned - it is spicy!  I did not mind it but my husband thought it was  a little too spicy,  I will probably make again but reduce some of the spicier seasonings.

I made this for my husband and my in-laws and everyone loved it.  My husband thought it was a little rich, but other than that gave it the thumbs up.  The few changes that I made were...I used less than half the heavy cream called for and added a bit of cornstarch to thicken the sauce. I also used Creole seasoning instead of cajun (is there really a difference?)and last but not least I used garlic salt instead of lemon pepper. Hope this helps:)

This was a great pasta dish the first thing in a while that my boyfriend said I had to make again soon!  I made the mistake of adding milk to the cream, because I was 1/2 cup short, which made the sauce too thin, but it still tasted great.  You can also play around with the seasonings and add more or less to your taste.  A very versatile, very yummy recipe.

Better than most I have tasted in a restaurant. This is my husband's favorite meal. Watch the Cajun seasoning, I added too much the first time, trying to enhance the flavor. It was too salty to eat. But the second time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out perfect.

This is one of THE BEST recipes on allrecipes. It is sooo tasty! My husband always takes seconds. I gave this recipe to a guy at work and he raved about it so much, other people at work were requesting the recipe. The ONLY think I would change/add is a tablespoon of flour to thicken the sauce. That's it!

I can't think of an easier, tastier main dish!  I've lived in New Orleans, and have eaten my share of Cajun Chicken Pasta.  This is - by far - the best ever!  I am going to try the suggestion of using fat-free half and half..I can't wait!  Thanks, Tammy!

Right up there with the restaurant version.  Turns out great every time.  I added the meat at the end so I could divide the sauce.  I added the seasoned/cooked chicken to one half and crawfish tails to the other.  Both were a big hit.

This is excellent.  I used the lemon pepper and cajun spices without salt, and added about 1/2 tsp of salt. I used 1/2 & 1/2 and 2 tbl of cornstarch.  I also added the parmasan directly into the sauce.

I was just looking for a quick fix for Saturday dinner, when I  bumped into this recipe. 
I recommend this recipe to all my friends and relatives now. It is an absolutely fantastic food combination, very flavourful and quick to cook. If you had 10 stars rating, I would give it 12 :)
Nothing to add.

My husband loves spicy foods & it takes just like the Cajun Chicken Pasta at the Cheesecake Factory.  You can just add purplr onion and shrimp and I bet it would be identical.  I added even more cajun seasoning that it called for and it was awesome.  GREAT, GREAT, GREAT!!!

Delicious! My husband loved it. We love it extra spicy so I added more Cajun seasoning, as well as red pepper flakes. Eating the delicious leftovers right now!

This recipe was outstanding.  I'm so glad that I quadrupled the recipe.  I tried to follow this recipe to the T. I looked for Cajun seasoning and I could not find it. So I used mccormicks Cajun seasoning for fish. It's usually by the bread crumb isle. Also that is a lot of heavy cream. Do not get heavy whipping cream. Some people don't think there's a difference but there is a huge difference in taste. So I put about 1 cup of heavy cream and 4 cups of 1/2 and 1/2.   It turned out so yummy. Definitely 5 star material.

I thought this recipe tasted good but not quite what I expected after reading all the good reviews. I added cherry tomatoes for a pop of sweet in the dish. Yum!

This was a fabulous dish.  I added a Cajun andouille and left out the green pepper.  I think next time I will throw in some raw shrimp and let it simmer and cook in the sauce.  I couldn't quit tasting it was that good.

I tried this recipe today, without the peppers (I'm not fond of peppers unless they are raw)  and with more mushrooms. The rest I followed to a "T". It was delicious, company worthy for sure. Thanks Tammy.

this was really good!  Whole family loved it!  Like usual I cut the cayenne down (Heat pansy here)  and it actually turned out not spicy enough.  It was still really good!  Just with the flavor of the spice blend I used you expect a little more heat.  and it wouldn't go amiss.  Thank you for sharing this one!  It will become a regular at our house too, along with some of the other reviewers claims.

Revision:  I have made this now for the second time.  I doubled the recipe, except the butter only used 2 tablespoons of butter.  and used half and half in place of heavy cream.  I am sure the sauce was a bit thinner than the heavy cream version.  but undercooked the pasta by 1 minute.  then added to sauce as the two were stirred together the pasta absorbed some of the liquid making it a nice consistency and adding flavor to the pasta.  Excellent!

Flavor was ok, but I wasn't super impressed.  Seemed to be missing something.  There was also way too much liquid.  I even added more veggies and noodles and still very soupy.  Will not make again.

I loved it but the husband wanted more flavor and spice, so next time I'll add some red pepper to the cajun seasoning and up the amount of spices I used over-all. I thought it was delicious!

Bland, and kind of weird-tasting. Also, cooking bell peppers, especially green ones, for 2-3 minutes on medium heat, was not even close to long enough. And the white ends of green onions should be cooked for no more than 3-4 minutes, and the green parts, about a minute. Not a fan of this recipe's taste or texture.

I doubled.  Thicken with cornstarch/used fat free 1/2 and 1/2/3/4 pkg of linguine/sauteed in olive oil.  Next time try adding shrimp, rotel and possibly Tabasco.

I enjoyed making this recipe. I read the reviews and made a few changes.  I used the frozen onion/celery/pepper mix and cooked it together with the mushrooms in a tablespoon of butter with 2 tsps of Emeril's creole seasoning (you can find the recipe here: http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/emeril-lagasse/emerils-essence-creole-seasoning-recipe2.html#!.  After the vegetables began to soften I added 1/2 cup of water and cooked them until they were dry, then repeated that because I wanted them to be softened and the flavor to be very concentrated.  I tossed the chicken in 2 T of the creole seasoning.  I also used 1 cup of half and half thickened with 1/4 cup of flour dissolved in 1/4 cup of water to make the sauce.  and I used 8 ounces of linguine instead of 12 ounces. AND I used about 1/4 cup of parmesan instead of just a few teaspoons.
This made a huge recipe - at least for me and my BF - because it is very rich.  It fed both of us and my two kids with ample leftovers.  A delicious recipe with a few changes. I'll definitely make this again.

Awesome recipe! I substituted a couple ingredients for ease. I used frozen chicken breasts and canned mushrooms. Came out delicious! I suggest cutting up the chicken into bite size pieces to cut down on cooking time. It says 30 minutes but it took me about twice as long. Next time I will be using 3 chicken breasts. To make it spicier, add extra cajun seasoning to the finished dish

Sorry, but I made this with 1/4 cup chopped onion and garlic, mostly because I did not have green onion, and used olive oil not butter and no Parmesan. Also had no mushrooms, and felt like they also are not necessary, otherwise absolutely as directed. Totally decadent and restaurant quality or better. It is rich, sumptuous and spicy. Perhaps spicy because I used a bit more home made Cajun seasoning (as per previous reviewer)...

Made this tonight and even my 9 year old who claims to hate veggies liked it. I made only a few changes. I used half and half instead of heavy cream and used a whole red bell pepper and no green. Also used 2 portobella mushrooms because that's what I had on hand.  I misread the recipe and used a whole bunch of green onions instead of only one.

This was good! I used some leftover chicken from the other night so it was shredded and became kind of mushy looking but it tasted good. I also used fat free milk and a little cornstarch. I did not have any green onions or mushrooms :( next time defintly adding the mushrooms!! My son even liked it my daughter is super picky and said no but I am going to add this to my list of meals!!

This is very simular to a dish we served over 17 years ago (I say served, as I movd from the area) at a restuarant I ran.  Only difference is we used a bit more of (our version) of cajun spices & (didn't use green peppers) and servied it over orzo with wonderfully prepared asparagus and a nice chunk of our artisan bread.  This was a customer favorite!  I have prepared this at home with linguini and is just as good.  I still don't add green pepper, I don't like the bitter taste they add to cream sauces.  Fresh minced garlic instead of powder is necessary!  Great comfort food with a restuarant flair!

Fast, easy, delicious.  What's not to love?  I doubled the recipe, with a full pound of linguine.  Suggestions to simplify a double order: 1) Use precooked chicken (I used Costco packaged rotisserie breast).  2) If you use a good Cajun/Creole (same) seasoning like home mixed Emeril's Essence (has the salt, cayenne, etc), you can cut out most spices on this recipe. 3) Use a package of pre-sliced bella mushrooms. 4)Half & Half with a T of cornstarch will cut fat.  5) I don't care for bell peppers or lemon pepper, and it's beautiful without it.  Now to cook: a) melt butter, throw in chicken, mushrooms, and green onion.  Then sprinkle Essence and mix.  b) pour over 3 cups of half and half with a T of cornstarch, add Basil, and bring to a simmer. That's it.  You can taste to see if you want to add salt, but you should be done if the creole/cajun seasoning is right.  Let it simmer and reduce while you cook the pasta.  Mix it all together and serve.  Son said it was one of the best dishes I've made.

It was great I loved it. If you've ever tried Friday's Cajun Chicken and Shrimp Pasta it taste exactly just like that. I made this twice my family loves it.

I left out the onions, other than that, followed the recipe...YUMMY!!!  The first bite or two I wasn't that crazy about but the more I ate the more heat I could taste and the better it tasted!  This is a "keeper" recipe for sure!

I adore this dish! Unfortunately, when I made it for my dad's birthday, I mis-measured the Cajun seasoning. My mum adored it! But my poor dad doesn't handle his spice well. A quick reminder; always read the recipe clearly.

But honestly, this is a wonderful recipe that reheats perfectly well the next day; always a bonus in my house. Permanently saving this to my recipes.

This has been a family favorite for years. The 1st time I made this I could not find any Cajun seasoning so I used Mrs dash hot and spicy and we love it.  I coat chicken in the Mrs dash and cook in a lot of butter. We only make this 3 or 4 times a year, that way its always special. Leftovers are the best.

Great recipe! I took the suggestion of another and used frozen pepper onion mix, I also added broccoli. We like it spicy in this house so I also added cayenne pepper! Delicious! I've also made it the semi homemade way by just buying a jar of Prego light Alfredo sauce ( 50 calories per serving). Fresh is always better but it was pretty good as well!

My husband and I both love this dish! I've made it several times now and the only changes I've stuck with are adding some fresh spinach while sautéing the other veggies and some extra mushrooms based on preference. I agree with another reviewer that fresh minced garlic is better here than garlic powder, but my husband can't tell the difference : )

WOW! Just made this for the first time. It was full of multiple layers of flavor from the rich cream sauce followed by a touch of heat from the Cajun seasoning. The only fault with this recipe... No left overs.

I made this today and my husband loved it. I had to ad-lib w/the spices, but it still turned out good. I also thickened the sauce a little as recommended by other reviewers. This was easy to make, too. I will definitely put this on the lunch menu again in the future.

We love this recipe in my house.  I never seem to have Cajun seasoning to I improvise and create my own with the seasonings I have.  It never seems to taste the same but I love that I can tone it down or crank up the heat to my choosing, especially with three small mouths eating it as well.

This recipe reminds me a lot of a scampi recipe I use. I used 2 cups of shredded parmesan, and substituted the heavy cream with blended milk and butter.

I didn't reread the recipe before I started, so I had stewed the chicken breasts. I sliced the chicken and sprinkled it with the Creole seasoning and put it aside.  I had Hatch peppers so used those instead.  I added the chicken as I added the cream and yummy yum.

This is an excellent dish, A KEEPER for sure, defiantly will make it again, many times! I used the bag of frozen peppers and it sure made this dish even easier
 I used fresh chicken because I wanted the seasonings to absorb into the chicken and used McCormack "fiery" pepper seasoning and didn't add the salt to the recipe, so we could salt to taste after. I can't say enough how delicious this was, my husband went crazy over it!

Great recipe as-is, but versatile! Try it with shrimp, sausage, etc. and you can use whatever pasta you have on hand. Add some cayenne for a little kick. Better than what you get at a restaurant!

My husband could not stop talking about this!  I thought it was fantastic as well...tasted restaurant-style.  I used real cream and I was worried when it was a little thin in the skillet, but it firms up once the mixture starts to cool.  I can't wait to have some leftovers...I'm sure it's even better the next day!  I used probably more green onion than most people do, and I added some chopped zucchini for more vegetables. Yum!

This is a house favorite of ours, I make it at least twice a month. We always add a little more cajun seasoning. One big edit we make is that we omit the garlic powder, and saute real minced garlic with the onion. Once the peppers and sauce have all come together I like to add a good handful of parmesan cheese to really pull it all together.

Made this a couple of times for the wife and I. Excellent every time! We use Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning for the cajun seasoning, and we add 1-3 tablespoons of flour (or corn meal) to the sauce to thicken it up. Comes out delicious and good looking every time so far. Thanks for this one... can't wait to make it for the in-laws! :)

Careful not to bread the chicken in the spices, definitely do just a rub or you'll in for a surprise! Nice twist to a simple dish.

it could have used a few more mushrooms and i personally didn't care that much for the pepper, but i really enjoyed it and the husband loved it :) -  i first thought the sauce was more soupy than saucy, but by cooking it a little longer and on higher heat this was easily remedied. also used more pasta. thanks for the great recipe

Go very easy with the Cajun seasoning ( it's hot AND salty)  and forgo the salt and pepper, unless you love volcano spicy very salty food.

I just tried this over the weekend and loved it.  My husband thought it was a little too spicy but I had added a little extra spice because I had used an extra chicken breast that was in the package.  I just had leftovers and I have to say that the leftovers were FANTASTIC too.  I'll be making this one again soon!

This was good, but it didn't have enough flavor or kick, so I added much more Cajun seasoning, plus hot sauce.

We loved this. The only thing I would do differently next time is to cook the peppers, mushrooms (used baby bellas) and onions at the same time the chicken goes into the pan because I prefer a softer texture to them. I did add some extra Cajun seasoning due to the other reviews but not enough to really say I made huge spice changes to the recipe. Also, I think the key to any good pasta recipe is buying the best pasta you can and not the box stuff from the grocery store. I'll be making this again.

This was super yummy.  The only change I made was to switch the amounts on the bell peppers.  I really love red bell pepper and don't really care for green, so switching was the way to go for us.  I will definitely make this again.

This is an amazing recipe that my husband and I absolutely love! Turns out perfect every time I make it. I add Cajun seasonings and I actually MINCE all the ingredients. I figured smaller bits of the peppers and mushrooms would be better when their finer. And it was!

I'm a big fan of TGI Fridays Cajun pasta and this was very similar. I didn't add green peppers (don't like them) but I did add everything else. I used more Cajun seasoning (to taste, pasta (about half a box) and I sprinkled a little flour over the chicken while cooking to make a rue for a thicker sauce. Also, plan on leftovers because it made a lot more than dinner for 2.

This was an AWESOME recipe!!  I did use the breast/white meat from a rotisserie chicken (sliced it into strips) per another reviewer's suggestion which made the meat so tender.  Other than that, followed the recipe measurements exactly.  Just stirred the vegetables into the butter along with the Cajun seasoning.  When they were done, added the cream and seasonings and mixed.  Then added the chicken and heated throughout.  Definitely a fav of ours now!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Amazing recipe that had quickly become a family favorite. We made this 3x in the first week. Have been asked for the recipe several times already. Did make a few changes as I went along. Extra onion and mushrooms, fresh garlic, extra spices and cream to increase the amount of sauce, cornstarch to thicken sauce, and a lot more Cajun seasoning. We completely coated the chicken in Cajun and it does smell super spicy but the taste is amazing when cooked. I was really worried this recipe would be too hot but it was just perfect.

One of my family's most favorite recipes! I made it with chicken for a long time before I discovered how yummy it was as a seafood dish. Now I always make it with a combination of seafood and leave the chicken out. I typically pick 2 types of seafood (shrimp, crab, or scallops) and get about 1-1 1/2 pounds total. The best by far was when I added the Maine lobster chunks some friends brought to us after their vacation. It was heavenly! Depending on what Cajun seasoning you use you may want to omit the salt. I swapped Cajun brands because they stopped selling the one I loved and my new one is super salty as it is.

This is my first time ever making this recipe. It came out so good. I made it vegetarian for our roommate. I tossed the veggies in the Cajun seasoning. I also added some fresh Parmesan to the dish and melted the cheese.

I absolutely loved this recipe. I couldn't believe that I cooked it and it came out like restaurant quality! I was in shock...i am a beginner, and always mess up recipes so I was expecting my first try to be ok. Even my husband, who could careless about food, its just sustance to live...he couldn't stop raving about it. He thought it was so delicious and wants me to keep making it. I did doubled the sauce/gravy (whatever u want to call it) and seasonings because I wanted enough to go over a bed of pasta.

I was searching for a recipe to cook for Fat Tuesday for my family, including some very picky toddlers. I wanted something indulgent with a Cajun flair but not too hot.  I found this recipe on Pinterest and  decided to go with it.  We are a family of five so I had to adjust the recipe accordingly.  I reduced the number of chicken breast from 4 to 3 and I used only 1 green bell pepper rather than 2, and I added extra mushrooms.  One reviewer complained about the sauce being very runny.  While I found that to be a ligimate complaint, I solved the problem by adding 1 T cornstarch to 1 T cold water and adding it to the sauce.  The sauce thickened up nicely and to the consistency I was looking for.  This dish was outstanding!  My family loved it, even the picky toddlers.  It contains just enough spice to kick thing up a notch without too much heat.  This is a new family favorite!  Next time I might switch out the chicken for some crab and shrimp.

Loved this recipe!  Sprinkled Cajun seasoning over boneless, skinless chicken thighs  and added more mushrooms. Combined noodles and sauce and simmered for a couple of minutes to reduce. Thanks Tammy for a wonderful recipe!

Accidentally ended up changing quite a bit, but the end result was still pretty good. Used a yellow pepper instead of green, used creole seasoning instead of cajun (I misread the label!), didn't use basil, didn't use as much cream, used 4 green onions, many more mushrooms and just went crazy with the mixture of spices until I was happy. End result tasted good but as another person said, sauce was VERY soupy even after I let it cook down. I ended up adding in 2-3 tablespoons of cornstarch, which thickened it up amazingly. Also added a spritz of lemon on top which made a huge difference, it really cut the taste of cream and fatty-ness. Will probably make this again but use even LESS cream and add in white wine.

Wonderful recipe. The only things I did differently were to add broccoli, double the recipe and I didn't have heavy cream so I substituted it with a milk/butter combo.

I love this recipe!  I usually use a rigatoni type pasta and add a can of rotelle tomatoes with the cream and then reduce until a good consistency.  I also always save a little pasta water in case it's too thick or not saucy enough after I add pasta.  Just yummy!!

Absolutely loved it!!  Made it exactly like the recipe asked.  My wife and I generally visit a local eatery that services a similar dish.  However, can't lie...this dish topped it and more.  This will definitely be a staple within our home!!

Excellent and ready. As good as in a restaurant. I used orange and yellow peppers. At first sauce seemed loose but improved as pasta absorbed it. I didn't add salt, no need. Used half onion. Would make again.

This is SO good! The whole family loved it, even my son who doesn't like veggies. I sauteed the chicken about 20 minutes until it was almost shredded in texture. I followed VBHOKIE's advice and bought the frozen onions, red, yellow and green bell peppers which was MUCH cheaper than buying fresh, and saved tons of time, also omitted the mushrooms. The flavor was great!  I used a bit more salt, cajun seasoning (Tony's), and basil and tasted the sauce until it was where I want it. I also added the parmesan cheese (a little more than called for) while the sauce was simmering which helped it thicken. Also added fresh chopped green onions on the individual plates (I like them crispy not cooked). I will be making this over and over again! Thanks for this recipe Tammy!! This was way better than this dish I order at restaurants! :)

This is awesome!!!!!!  I substituted fresh spinish and roasted red pepper in place of the green and red peppers. It is close to the raddlesnake pasta served at UNI's Pizza.

Followed directions exactly and it tasted great. Very easy and quick meal.  This will definitely end up in our dinner rotation! Next time I will probably use more Cajun seasoning as I didn't think it was spicy at all.  I will also probably follow advice from other reviews and use half and half to replace some of the heavy cream to reduce fat/calories.

Delicious! My husband and I loved this.  We followed the recipe except that I used 2% milk instead of the heavy cream and then added some flour near the end to thicken it up.  Tasted like something you would get in a restauraunt!  Going to try this with shrimp this week.

This was a good basic recipe, but needs some corrections! We ended up making cajun seasoning, and seasoned the chicken with way more seasoning than the recipe called for, but that is what gave the sauce most of its flavor! Also, the heavy cream needs to be reduced way down to make a sauce unless you wanted cajun noodle soup! We added some butter and flour to thicken the sauce, and after the alterations the pasta was a big hit! Thank you for the recipe!

Simple.  Used rotisserie chicken as one person had suggested.  Used a bit extra Cajun seasoning and used real garlic rather than powder.  Next time I'll try with shrimp.

A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!! Loved it soooo much. I followed the recipe exactly but it ended up a little soupy I added about 1/4c. of flour and it turned out perfect. However, a side note, be careful when adding extra seasonings....I love salt and most recipes are never salty enough for me...THIS ONE IS!!! I over salted mine but next time I will know better. ;) Enjoy I know my family will for years to come.

My husband and I thought this pasta was pretty good. Not 5star worthy, but still pretty good. Defiantly not a boring dish! Lots of flavors. The pasta needs a lot more cajun spice than it called for.

We had some chicken leftover from fajitas the night before, so I decided to use it in this recipe. I made the mistake of reading the reviews and being very liberal with my cajun seasoning. Unfortunately, I had never used this particular cajun seasoning before, and the sauce ended up being nearly inedible due to the spiciness. The recipe itself is fantastic, and we all agreed it would be amazing if I hadn't accidentally made it so spicy. I ended up dumping out some of the sauce and replacing with more dairy to dilute the spice and it was much better. I used regular half-and-half instead of cream. Will make again, but stick to less seasoning!

LOVE this recipe, it's restaurant quality, in my opinion.  I made minor changes based on what I had in the house - used all red bell pepper, used regular onion instead of green, and I think I would keep it that way next time.  Instead of heavy cream, I always use canned evaporated milk for sauces, etc.  There's no loss of flavor/quality, just WAY fewer calories and fat grams.  I think the spice level on this was just about perfect.  Great recipe, and a definite repeat.

Okay, I give this a 5 star...even though I didn't follow the directions.  I used this recipe as a base for an easy breezy redo.  I used a rotisserie chicken and cream of mushroom soup...  So technically I shouldn't critique this specific recipe.  However, aside from the lack of richness that mine probably doesn't have as compared to if I had used the cream, thanks to the basic info, I was able to enjoy a similar taste, but with what I had on hand.   Delish!!!  Thanks for the recipe, as I was stuck on what to do with my rotisserie chicken!!!

Restaurant Quality!!!  I made this as written with the exception of deglazing the pan with white wine prior to adding the cream.  Will be making this again and again!

I really enjoyed this dish but have to agree that if you follow this recipe to the letter it would not be as great.   For me it wasn't the ingredients listed but the quantities that will affect the dish.   I realize that the recipe states it will serve 2.  And it probably would serve 2 people one serving each.  For me I doubled the pasta, chicken, and tippled the veggies...but the real difference came with the addition of grated Parmesan cheese.  2 Tablespoons will not thicken 1.5 cups of heavy whipping cream.  I seasoned the dish with 4 tsp cajun seasoning and I grated 1/4 cup.

This was FABULOUS! Even my youngest who doesn't like any pasta other than spaghetti ate this..(and I didn;'t have fettuccini or linguini so I used farfarle bowties). I also sub'd evaporated milk for cream, for less fat and we didn;t miss it .

I made this and midway through preparation I realized that I had no cream or condensed milk.  So, I substituted a large can of Campbell Cream of Chicken Soup with half a can of water.  I also added about 8 oz of frozen broccoli florets and 1/4 tsp of ground red pepper.  OMG, this came out wonderful.  I used 3 half chicken breasts and it made enough for 7 people.  Absolutely wonderful.  This will be a regular when I expect company.  Quick, easy and elegant.

Great recipe!  Even the kids loved it!  The only thing I changed was to double the cajun seasoning....we like a little spice!  The sauce was a little on the runny side, but I just added more cheese.

This recipe is perfect as is and is a family favorite!  Perfect for that special occasion dinner.  To cut some of the calories and fat  I used fat free 1/2 & 1/2 and mixed it with a little corn starch and it was still yummy!

This was good. I followed the recipe as is and it came out good. I didn't mix everything together just the sauce and the chicken. I did it that way so we can pour however much or little of the sauce on top of the pasta as we wanted. Overall a good recipe.

This has become one of my favorite go-to recipes.  It's amazing with a little bread and a glass of wine.  It really does need a good dose more cajun or chili spice.  Great dinner!

This had great flavor, after cooking the dredged chicken pieces for awhile I added a can of cream of chicken soup to it. I cooked the vegetables in a heavy cream/cream cheese/seasoning mixture before adding in with the chicken at the end.  I actually had too much pasta for the amount of chicken/veg that I made, so I made some alfredo sauce to add to the pasta as well.

Quick and easy. My wife loved the taste. We will be making this again. One negative is that the sauce as prepared was a little thick. Will then it out the next time. I think we are going to add shrimp the next time.

FANTASTIC!!! I did make some alterations: 1. Used about 1.25 lbs chicken & increased the Tony Chacere's Creole season to 3 tsp...2. Used a bag of bell pepper/onion frozen mix which I heated and drained all liquids out (omit green onions)...3. Used fat free half & half instead of cream and added about 1 tbsp flour to thicken...4. omitted lemon pepper & parm cheese...GREAT STUFF!!!

Will definitely make this again! Super easy!!  I've been looking for a recipe that would give us the same flavor as a dish, from the old 8.0 Club in downtown Fort Worth, called Funky Fettucini Alfredo.  Made a few changes ~ added 1/2 lb. smoked sausage, an extra 1/2 tsp. cajun seasoning and I used farfalle/bow tie pasta, to mimick the 8.0's recipe. This recipe tasted just like the restaturants, or better!! Very little effort with geat taste!!

This was deliscious, however, next time I will save the time not cutting up fresh peppers. I don't think it is needed with all the seasoning. But just for flavor I might cut it up into 4ths and then just pick it out. It looks like there's too much seasoning but it really is great. My fiance isn't a fan of peppers which is why I will just leave em out from now on...

Love, love, love it.  Next time I'll probably skip the pepper.  I may also add some more chicken for the man of the house.  I was skeptical that the sauce was too thin but once I tossed it and let is sit for a minute while I toasted some garlic bread it was perfect.

I was feeding a group of people so I had to adjust the serving size to 4. When I saw that it took 1/4 of butter and 3 cups of heavy cream I sprung into "healthier version" action. To serve 4, I used 2 cups of half and half. I reserved about a 1/4 c of it and mixed some corn starch in before adding it to the mix. I also sauteed my chicken in 1T of I Can't Believe It's Not Butter and added olive oil along with it to the pan. The only other change I made was to add more Cajun seasoning to the sauce. We like it spicy!

The dish was good over all but we were looking for something with more of a kick so next time I will put way more of the spices because you could barley taste them.

This is one of my family's favorite new recipes - it's excellent prepared exactly as written, but we like spicy stuff, so I add more cajun seasoning, and add a chopped clove of garlic to the chicken & butter while cooking. We also add a few splashes of Tabasco at the table! I've also used a lower fat version when my pants are feeling tight - substituting low-fat sour cream for the cream and cutting the butter in half was just as good! Thanks!

Delicious!  I will definitely be making it again.  My tweaks were: Used chicken thighs; used only red & yellow peppers; used half & half plus skim milk w/some corn starch instead of cream; omitted from lemon pepper down.  Served over whole wheat spaghetti.

The chicken was tasty. However, I used season all instead of salt. I would also suggest to remove the lemon pepper from the recipe

I made it according to how it's written.  I didn't have cajun seasoning in my spice rack, so I used the "simple cajun seasoning" recipe from this site.  The heavy cream thickened perfectly without the need to use corn starch because I stirred it a little longer because I didn't want to change the taste or appearance at all..My family felt the amount of spices as written was perfect & if I doubled it, it would've been too hot to eat.  I did pass this recipe on to my other family members to make since it's basically an easy recipe to make. Thanks!

I thought this was delicious I might have used a little to much cajun seasoning but it waas still good. And it didnt need as many peppers as it called for. I also didn't use 1 breast per person either. 2 chicken breast for 4 people was enough if sliced thin. Very good I will be making it again!

SOOO Good- Kids had seconds and hubby LOVED!! Definately saving this one.  I made a double batch, but only did about 1 cup cream for whole thing and it was perfect. A hint of sauce but not overpowering.  Chicken was great with cajun and the spice was perfect!

This recipe was too die for good!  My husband liked it so much that he wants me to make it again this week!  I did make a few changes just to reduce the fat content... I used fat free half n half instead of heavy whipping cream, EVOO to cook the chicken in rather than butter and whole wheat spaghetti noodles instead of linguine.

This was good, but I'm not sure it is worth the fat and calories. I would be curious to see how the flavor would be if it were to cook a bit longer allowing the spices to meld better. The only changes I made was 50% half and half and 50% cream and then I chopped the chicken instead of leaving it as breasts. I'm not sure I would make this again unless I could find a way to reduce the fat and calories.

Very good. Its hard finding recipes my picky boyfriend likes and we both liked this one. I followed the recipe exactly as written except for the addition of about 1 tablespoon of cornstarch. The sauce was a bit thin even after simmering for a bit. I would also recommend more cajun seasoning and salt.

This turned out pretty good.  It made enough for 4 servings in my household.  I used about 5 oz. bow-tie pasta, a red and orange bell pepper, no mushroom, and added a bit more cajun seasoning plus a bit of cayenne (we like things spicy).  The sauce is pretty thin/runny, so I added a tiny bit of cornstarch, and it got a little bit thicker.  The sauce was a bit thicker the next day too.
Good flavors, and pretty quick to throw together.

Excellent! I made this almost exactly as shown. I only omitted the green peppers because I don't like them and the lemon pepper because I thought I had some but didn't. I found that this ended up not making as much sauce as we like, so I added a cup more of half and half and some more of the spices. Also, I used a tablespoon of real garlic instead of garlic powder. My family and I just absolutely loved it! It's the only recipe I've made in which my son ate the red peppers.

Very good! It reminds me of a dish that would be served at a restaurant. Oh, and it was quick AND easy! I followed other reviewer's suggestions and used fat-free 1/2 & 1/2 mixed with a little cornstarch and frozen peppers. I also seasoned chicken tenderloins that I pounded thin with homemade Cajun seasoning from this site, and cooked stovetop on my grill pan. It looked beautiful and tasted even better!

Really good...I would add more spice next time. More cajun seasoning, maybe some fresh garlic and tad more salt. Used fat free 1/2 and 1/2 with cornstarch added and it turned out perfectly.

I made this last night & it turned out great. The only change I made was I used bow tie pasta insetad. The thing I will change next time is the spices. I felt like it wasn't spicy enough.

this was awesome. I used one yellow pepper instead of a green and red pepper. I didn't have 12 oz of whipping cream so I used 8 oz of whipping cream and 4 oz of half n half. I also added cayenne pepper, Goya seasoning, and used angel hair pasta instead of linguine pasta.

This recipe was delicious! I didn't have some of the ingredients on hand so I substitued some things or omitted them totally. Like I didn't have red bell peppers so I left them out and I didn't have cajun seasoning so I use Creole seasoning instead and it was great! I served it with garlic and butter croissants.

My husband cooked this last night before I came home, and it is EXCELLENT!  We used white vedalia (spelling?) onions instead of green onions.

wonderful and filling meal that everyone loved. I cut the prep time in half by cutting everything in advance earlier in the day. I usually make without the mushrooms.

We made this last night for some friends that were over for dinner and it was fantastic! I pretty much followed the recipe with the exception of tripling it so it could feed 4-6. Its a little spicy so maybe next time I will cut down on the Tony's. I work at a major chain restaurant and this tastes very similar to a dish we have on our menu,which is one of our best selling plates.

I left all the veggies out.  Mixed skim milk with a T of cornstarch before I added to pan.  Man is this stuff great!  Fried the chicken in EVOO instead of butter.  Felt good eating it because I cut all those calories and you wouldn't even know it. I also added extra cajun seasoning.

delish! I used hafl & half to cut down on calories and while the sauce wasn't as thick as it probably could be, it was still really yummy. I only used one bell pepper bc I'm not a huge fan of bell peppers and added a whole bag of baby bella mushrooms.

This was excellent! I used fat free half and half and a bit of cornstarch like some of the reviewers recommended to cut the fat, and it was still delicious and did not taste low-fat at all! I would like it just a bit spicier, so next time I will add some red pepper flakes, but otherwise follow the recipe as written. I will be making this a lot I am sure.

Okay, this is an awesome recipe!  I noticed that a lot of other reviewers cut the heavy cream, but I really feel like that's a cornerstone of this dish.  Here's my take on this recipe: I cubed three boneless chicken breasts, tossed them with 2 tbsp of cajun seasoning. I then sauteed the chicken (in olive oil) in a deep skillet, along with about a tbsp of minced garlic, a pinch of salt, and half of a slivered onion. To this, I also added about 1/4 c. of chardonnay, and let it reduce for approx.  10 mins, until the chicken is cooked through. After that, I followed the recipe, added in the bell pepper (omitting the green onion and mushrooms), as well as the listed seasonings. Prior to adding the cream, I added a pinch of salt and about 2 tbsp of lemon juice. Next, came the cream. In retrospect, I'd probably only go with about 1 c. of cream, since the additional 1/2 c. seemed slightly excessive, but if you like a rich cream sauce, by all means, go for the whole amount. With the cream, I added the suggested seasonings (minus the black pepper), and a bit more lemon juice. As the sauce simmered, I also added--to the whole mixture--a half cup of grated parmesan cheese, which, I think, helped slightly thicken the sauce. Next time, I'd use another tbsp of cajun seasoning in the sauce itself, since it was "spicy" but seemed to be missing that big Cajun kick that I expected. And, also, I'd reduce the cream to 1 c., since it was a bit heavy, and I added wine. All in all, an A+ recipe!

I loved this.  I had to add a lot more Cajun to it.  But i like a good zap.  I added some crushed red pepper as well.  Probably a bit to much seeing that my hubby thought it was so spicy.  I added zucchini and asparagus left out the mushrooms.  I also used whole milk because i didnt have heavy cream.

My husband and I are very picky eaters and we loved this recipe.  It was easy and quick to make, which is great with two little kids at home.  I omitted the peppers and mushrooms from the recipe since we do not like those and it still was very tasty!  Thank you!

I made this last week and it was delicious!  I did make a few minor changes though.  I used a pint of fat free half and half and then made a slurry with cornstarch and 1.5 cups of 2% milk (I like a lot of sauce).  I added more cajun seasoning and some red pepper.  It took about 15-20 for it to thicken.  At the end when everything came together I stirred the linguini in the pot with the sauce and added a cup of Italian cheese.  It was very tasty and I had enough to eat for two days!  Thanks!

WOW! I wish I could give this recipe more stars!!  I didn't follow it exactly since I used what I had on hand...I had to make the following changes: I used 1/2 of a lemon pepper rotisserie chicken, shredded; I used 1 tbsp of cajun seasoning; I left out the red pepper, mushrooms, and basil (personal preference)  I also used a pint of heavy cream, and added 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper for more spice!  I think this recipe would be delicious any way you do it!  I might add broccoli next time..and next time will be very, very soon!  Thanks, Tammy, for posting this recipe!  It's just the pasta I've been craving for a couple of months now!

Very good and creamy. I added about a hand full of fresh grated parmesan cheese and left out the red pepper ($1.50 at my store is way too much!) and the mushrooms since I hate mushrooms. Everything else the same and it was awesome.

THIS RECIPE IS AMAZING! Will definitely make many many more times! Sauce tastes just like a cream sauce at the macaroni grille restaurant! I cannot cook very well at all but this my friends is a WINNER!! 5 stars!  The original sauce was a bit thin, just simmer longer for a thicker sauce. I used 1 cup of heavy cream and 1 cup of fat free half and half for less calories.

I made this for my boyfriend on Valentine's Day 2010 and WOW!!!  I did find the sauce a little thin even after simmering it a bit longer so I added a handful or so of mozzerella cheese and a dash more of cajun seasoning (I used King Cajun Louisiana Mix). It turned out so well I think I'll make it for my parents some day soon.

wow!!!  this was probably the best recipe i have found on this website.  Thank you so much for sharing!  Now, that being said...I did do a few things different but I'm sure it would still be a 5 star recipe if I followed it to the letter.  Now, here's what I did.  I used a package of baby bella's...oh so tasty!  And I used Mrs. Dash with some salt and extra garlic powder.  I didn't add peppers because I didn't have them and don't really like them anyway.  Other than that...it was the best pasta I have ever had!!!  Thank you again!

This is Wonderful!! The strips are so much better than the whole half chicken breast, as the seasoning is more evenly distributed thoughout the sauce.......I only changed a couple of things,.....I only used red and yellow bell peppers, and a lot more mushroons.  It was perfect, and my son, who lives in La, loved it....Thank you!!

Excellent base recipe. For the most part, I didn't add anything that wasn't already listed; just olive oil when sauteing the chicken. I definitely added more cajun seasoning per previous reviewers, and after sampling the finished product, figured it could use more salt. Also, once all of the vegetables were chopped, there should definitely be more chicken/pasta in order for the ratio of everything to be more consistent. And, of course, for lower fat, light cream works just fine, as long as you use about a tsp. of cornstarch and cook it a bit longer. This is definitely a good recipe to play with!

This is an awesome meal.  If you are counting calories, here are a few suggestions:  saute the chicken in olive oil and a little bit of garlic instead of butter, use whole wheat pasta (I realy like the whole wheat penne), and use fat free sour cream instead of heavy cream.  Just those few changes make this a very flavorful, HEALTHY meal.

This was great. I followed the recipe with the exception that I sautéed shrimp and scallops in a little butter and fresh garlic to cook and then added on top to serve rather than cooking in the cream sauce. I do think the amount of pepper was overpowering. It wasn't too hot and I like spicy foods, however the black pepper was overpowering, so I would recommend reducing the peppers to start and then increasing to taste. I also split the cream in half and added fat free milk for a lower fat substitute. Add a teaspoon or two of cornstarch to cold milk to mix and dissolved and then add to the cream mixture closer to the end of cooking to thicken up if using milk rather than the cream. Over all, I thought this was good and will probably make again as the recipe is quite easy and is a great different meal for a busy week.

Nothing I would change except to reduce the amount of heavy cream.  The dish doesn't need that much cream to give it flavor, the ingredients alone work!

Very good. I used a seafood mix (scallops, shrimp, and calamari) instead of chicken and mini bow ties instead of linguini. Also omitted the peppers as I didn't have any on hand. Excellent and fattening!

Wonderful recipe! My husband loved it.He said it tasted like a dish from Olive Garden or Carabaas. I did make a few modifications to make it a little more healthy. I substituted low fat sour cream for the heavy whipping cream. I also used EVOO instead of butter.I also used a little flour to thicken. It is a keeper. However, we will only eat it ONCE a month. Thanks a million.

This was wonderful! We will definitely make this again.  I was looking at another person's recipe and went shopping for half and half.  I was looking at the reviews and was referred to this recipe again.  So, since i only had half and half on hand i used 1 tablespoon of cornstarch and 1 cup of half and half.  It was fabulous.  The spices come together perfectly.  The bit of twang from the lemon pepper was great.  i didn't measure the cajun spice i just dredged the chicken in it and made sure it looked well covered.  it was perfect!   also, i didn't have red pepper on hand so i just used a few slices of green bell pepper.  i wouldn't use a whole pepper.  This matched well with a side romaine salad.   Highly recommend this!

This was pretty good. Instead of chopping the onion and peppers myself I just bought a bag of frozen pepper medley, you couldn't even tell the difference. I also added a couple shakes of red pepper flakes just for some more spice.

This is my first recipe review.  I have tried so many recipes, but this is my first actual review.  I LOVE this recipe.  It is restaraunt quality at home.  I always make extras for the younger airmen (I am in the Air Force) in the dorms.  I always get rave reviews.  When I use heavy cream, I need to add cornstarch or flour to thicken the sauce.  I used heavy whipping cream this time and it was perfect.  I add extra minced garlic and extra cajun seasoning.  I used farfalle (bow tie pasta) so my 2 year old doesn't choke on it like she does with the longer style noodles.  This is definitely one of my favorites!

Slightly disappointed.  Followed the recipe exactly.  The flavor was VERY good - not too spicy, but we thought it was good even though we love spicy things.  However, I anticipated making Cajun Chicken Pasta, not Cajun Chicken SOUP!  I used 1.5 cups of heavy cream, exactly as called for, but wound up placing a bowl on the table which appeared to contain nothing but seasoned cream - all the ingredients, pasta included, sunk to the bottom of what wound up being an excessive amount of liquid.  Next time I think I will drain off the butter used to saute the chicken as well as using only 3/4 to 1 cup of cream, and maybe adding some flour and letting it simmer for longer.  Good flavor, bad ingredient ratio.

I followed this recipe exactly, and it was very disappointing.  I've experimented with a lot of different cream sauces, and they usually turn out pretty well, but this was a waste of time.  The sauce was too thin.  I thickened it, but since it didn't have much flavor, it still wasn't very good.  Maybe the cajun spices I used weren't flavorful enough, but I added more seasoning and fresh garlic & it still was pretty flavorless.  Tonight I plan to make a sauce I know I like so the leftover pasta, chicken, & veggies don't go to waste.

Great.. Not too spicy as I was afraid of. I used homemade cajun spice mix where I have control of the salt and heat. Hubby put hot sauce on his and everyone was very pleased.

Great recipe!  I took a few shortcuts...bought rotisserie chicken from our wholesale store and frozen peppers and onions.  Also tripled the amount of cajun spice.  Yummy!

A fantastic and very easy recipe!  When I make it I increase the amount of veggies by quite a bit (2 of each sort of pepper and a TON of mushrooms) and then increase the amount of cream and spices, but it is very good exactly as written.

I wanted to try this dish badly after i saw the good review about it. It is really a quick and easy meal and the most important thing is... it is sooo good! I replaced the garlic powder with real garlic instead. 
Good recipe!!! Strongly recommend!!!

Our favorite pasta recipe yet!

We love spicy food and this is perfect. I always make my own cajun spice using about 8 different seasonings- it's always so good! Last time we saved the leftover sauce and put it in pitas the next day because we were out of noodles- simple and filling!

This was a VERY easy dish to make, and extremely tasty! I used 2 cups of whipped heavy cream, and I didn't follow the instructions on seasonings. I just added as it needed flavor. I sautéed my chicken in butter as well as red wine vinegar, which added a extra kick to the flavor. I also used half of the green bell pepper, and used a sweet yellow onion instead of the green onion. I didn't add the mushrooms at all. Overall, this dish tasted like it came right out of a fancy restaurant! To top it off, fresh garlic bread on the side, with a daiquiri brought it all together! I will make this over and over again!

Was passable as something quick and easy to throw together, but didn't wow me as I expected based on all the positive reviews.  I subbed Morningstar Farms Chik'n Strips which I wouldn't do again. :/  Sauce came out thin, so I added a bit of potato flakes. And, with all the spices, I was expecting it to be a lot more flavorful. Probably won't make again. Oh well, thanks for letting me try.

This was amazing. I did as VBHOKIE suggested by omitting the mushrooms and used the frozen, bagged blend of yellow,green,red peppers and onions found in the freezer aisle of the store. I used 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, which I coated liberally with the cajun seasoning (more than the recipe called for) with 16oz of linguine and 2 cups of heavy cream. Cooking with the frozen pepper and onion blend did make the sauce very watery, so I fixed it by mixing in 1/4 cup of flour. I let it stand to thicken, and sprinkled a little more of the cajun seasoning in the sauce. I did it under 20 minutes from start to finish, and it was so good. It's definitely going into the recipe box!

This was very good.  I used shrimp instead of chicken, and I seasoned them with the following cajun seasoning recipe: 4 tsp. salt, 4 tsp. paprika, 3 tsp. garlic powder, 3 tsp. fresh ground pepper, 2 1/2 tsp. onion powder, 1 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper, 1 1/2 tsp. dried thyme, 1 1/2 tsp. dried oregano.  Also, I used half and half instead of the heavy cream.

This was delicious! The only changes I made were I cutting the chicken breasts into bite size chunks, used 1/2 and 1/2, and I used a bit more cajun/creole seasoning called for on the raw chicken and added cayenne pepper along with the seasonings to the sauce towards the end. My family and I tend to like our food quite spicy :) I will be making it this weekend for our family get together.  I highly recommend this recipe!!

I have been making a cajun chicken pasta recipe almost the same for years but instead of sauteing in just butter I use a combination of olive oil and butter and omit the cream altogether. I did try it with the cream and it was a nice change.

My son chose this for me to cook one night, and I have to make it at least twice a month now!  Excellent dish!  It takes half an hour to prepare from beginning to end, so it's a great dish to fix on a weeknight.  Leftovers the next day usually are more "buttery" or "greasy" than the creamy texture you get the first night you fix it, but my co-workers still ask for me to bring in my leftovers when I tell them I'm making it!!

This recipe is delicious... I swapped the veggies for whatever ones we felt like having... and estimated on the seasoning amounts... great alternative to regular Alfredo pasta.

This was awesome!  I followed the recipe exact except I did use a pint of fat free half and half and 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to thicken instead of heavy cream and it turned out perfect.  So this was a guilt free dinner for us with wonderful flavors, will be making again!

Impressive. I did have to substitute because I was not able to find cayenne pepper for the seasoning.. It was wonderful though, it had a nice zing to it and it was a brillant mixture of all sorts of flavors. I will make agian soon.

very good flavor.  Definitely add flour to the sauce because it is very thin without.  Other than that it is great as is!

This recipe was AWESOME!!!!! Very good and yummy! I followed the recipe exact only using spaghetti noodles instead, and would add more mushrooms and green onion, and maybe some flour to the sauce to thicken it a little. Otherwise it is perfect, just like at a fancy restaurant! Serve with some fresh bread and a green salad on the side!

Absolutely outstanding tasty recipe!  I liked the chicken cut into small strips before cooking.  I added some broccoli flowerettes right at the end and they added a nice touch.  My husband added some jalapeno to his, but definitely spicy enough for my tastes w/o this.  Instead of chopping the peppers, I'm going to try small strips next time - more color and texture.  The 2 servings made two meals for us - even with only 2 forzen chix breasts!  Thanks!!

This was a good recipe, if I make it again I will probably add a lot more mushrooms.  I made 2 servings, which actually was enough for 3-4 adults.

This recipe is excellent! It is not Cajun by my definition, but it is a wonderful combination of flavors.  I made this for a potluck.  I sliced the chicken into thin pieces and doubled the cream sauce so it would not dry out in the crock pot. It was a party hit!

WOW!!!!!What a great recipe. Unlike everyone else, I make this recipe exactly as stated. Wish people wouldn't rate recipes if they are going to change. They need to submit their own "changed" recipe. Anyway, great recipe all the way. My State champion football player son and his friends chow down on this dish because of the carbs and high protein. Just wish the calories weren't as high,(for me). Thanks for a GREAT recipe.

Great recipe....I really enjoyed the flavor.....tasted like a dish i would get in a restaurant.  I first tried this when my cousin made it for me over the holidays and wanted to try it for myself.  I would only caution to use less whipping cream than indicated in the ingredients.  I used about 1 pint of heavy cream and it was very liquidy.  Of course you can thicken with flour or corn starch.  Awesome recipe....try it!

I made this recipe last night for my boyfriend and his brother.  I was very impressed.  It was very easy.  The only thing I did different was add a little cornstarch to thicken it up.  It was just spicy enough!

Good pasta dish--the only complaint we had was that the consistency of the sauce was too thin for our liking so I used some cornstarch to thicken it up. Other than that, it is definately a good dish with a little omph.

This was pretty good.  I did as others had suggested, used milk and cornstarch instead of heavy cream.  But the sauce was still pretty thin.  It had good flavor, but I'm going to have to tweak it a little to suit my taste.

I liked this recipe a lot to change up dinner a bit. I marniated my chicken with Mrs. Dash ten minute marinade zesty garlic for about two hours (because I had the time). After the marinade I tossed the chicken in the zatarian's creole seasoning lightly, added some tabasco sauce as well. I sauteed the bell peppers, mushrooms, and onion first because if you don't the veggies will be too crisp. Then I cooked the chicken and then mixed the veggies with it to add it to the cream sauce. I did use a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce. It was delish!

This was just okay. The cream sauce was too rich and took away from the whole cajun flavor (i even increased the amount of seasoning). If I make this again I'll take the advice of others and decrease the amount of cream and increase the cajun seasoning.

This is delicious!  I am allergic to wheat gluten so I used gluten free rice pasta.  Also added chopped sun dried tomatoes to the mix.  I didn't have any cajun seasoning.  So, I used Tony Catcher's Creole and put some Essence of Emeral seasoning on it too.  Also used fresh basil from my herb garden. I scaled the recipe for 4 servings and it looks like it could actually serve 6 - 8!  This stuff is good good!  We will be eating it again tomorrow for lunch!

***update***
Had this for lunch and it is even better the next day.  This one is a sure keeper!

Very tasty!  I have made this twice.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly except I used penne pasta.  I also accidentally bought half&half instead of whipping cream.  It turned out good though, as I just added a little flour to thicken up the sauce and it was AMAZING!  I also added more cajun seasoning than the recipe called for.  The second time I made it I used the heavy cream and I didn't like it as much because I thought the sauce was too runny (even after letting it simmer for a long time).  Next time I will add flour again.

The most requested recipe at my house by far.  My husband would eat it every night if I would make it. I've made it a couple dozen times and it is fabulous each time!  My husband loves the soupy sauce, though it does make a mess with the noodles flinging around. Throw on an apron! :-)

This is our all-time favorite recipe around my house.  We cook this all the time.  Lots of calories, but we definitely eat this at least once a month.  I suggest cooking the sauce a little longer than suggested just to infuse the flavors even more.

Just like the restaurants. My husband marked this one for me to make and loved it. He thought I had cheated and ordered take-out. Very creamy and flavorful. I didn't have a problem with the chicken being bland, and the leftovers vanished in his lunch the next day.

This was delicious and very easy to make! Every bite was a treat. Not to sound like an echo, but you do need something like corn starch or flour to thicken it up a bit. This is going in the cook book, I would cook this for company knowing I had a winner!

I thought this was absolutely delicious. We top with a store-bought Kraft brand mixture of Romano, Parmesan and Asiago. The other types of cheeses add a lot of flavor. This was absolutely delicious! Thanks for the submission!

This was excellent. My husband, who is not a pasta man, demanded I cook it again...and soon. This recipe tastes almost exactly like my favorite pasta at Chile's. I also cubed my chicken for simplicity. I did take every one's advice and use 1/2 and 1/2 to reduce the fat. Oh, and use real garlic instead of garlic powder...it makes a huge difference.

This was really really good, however next time I'm def going to add paprika, cayenne, etc to the chicken because it wasnt spicy at all. Also, would only use 1 Cup of cream, the sauce was way too thin. Otherwise, excellent!

Really good recipe.  Husband loved it. A keeper.  Followed recipe pretty much exactly...some minor changes:  light cream, fresh basil, 1/8 tsp. lemon zest (didn't have lemon pepper) 1/2 tsp chili powder with the cajun seasoning and marinated chicken for 30 minutes.

This was really good! I added a few dashes of white and cayenne pepper, and that really brought the flavor a long way. The sauce's thickness was great! I think the trick is to lower your burner to medium to low heat, and just let the suace and chicken hang out for a good 10 min. in a covered skillet. I used half and half, and the suace was at a great level! Will probably try this one again with shrimp and scallops. Thanks!

Very good! I used pre-cooked chicken, half the butter and half & half instead of heavy cream (w/cornstarch to thicken), and it turned out splendidly.  Thanks!

Great tasting pasta...but lets be honest, its not worth 1.5 cups of cream...that's an extraordinary amount of fat/cholesterol, and coming from an MD...I wouldn't recommend it.

I tried this recipe last night and my boyfriend and I abosultely loved it!  Adding cornstarch is a must as the sauce was definitely too thin.  I also added cayenne to the chicken and a dash into the sauce, as someone else suggested; it came out wonderful. I used thin spaghetti noodles instead since I was all out of linguine. Next time I might try some shrimp in it as well.  You could always add shrimp and sausage and make a jambalya pasta.

GREAT RECIPE. I was in a hurry so I used canned chicken and frozen summer vegetables. Definitely add cornstarch to thicken. I made a second batch with shrimp that turned out great also.

GREAT dish.  I thought there was a little too much cream for the amount of pasta used, so we ended up doubling the amount of pasta used.

mmmmmmm!  The best.  If it isn't hot enough, throw in some more cayenne. I used half and half instead of cream and cut back the amount by a quarter. Still, it's wonderful!

Amazing!  I have made this many dinner parties and it has been a hit each time.  I used light cream instead of heavy cream but followed the recipe otherwise.  I have tried with different pasta as well and found that penne works the best as it does not absorb the sauce as quickly. Very easy to double!

This dish was fantastic. I too added a dash of cornstarch at the end to thicken it up a bit. Also, I cooked the green peppers longer than the rest because they tend to be a rougher pepper than red/yellow/orange.    I was tired of working with chicken breasts, so I used chicken sausage instead. I will make this one again for sure.

Love this, both my daughters now also make this. We use chicken breast cut up into chunks either grilled or lightly cooked for about 5 to 7 minutes on stovetop. If the sauce is to thin take a little water add corn starch mix and slowly whisk into sauce till you get the thickness you are looking for.

This recipe was fantastic!  I made a few modifications but it still tasted great.  I used light cream instead of heavy & used fresh garlic as opposed to garlic powder.  It was quite liquidy (not saucey), so if I were to use light cream again I would probably only use 3/4 to 1 cup.  I will definitely make this again!!

Very good & very easy though I wish it were healthier!  I will try the low-fat version next time.  Used a bit less chicken and 1 cup heavy cream.  Added some diced tomatoes.

Fantastic! I followed this recipe exactly and it was wonderful and sooo flavorful! This is definitely a keeper and one that I would definitely serve to dinner guests! I served with a warm crusty loaf of bread to sop up the delicious sauce.

Delicious!! We loved this recipe.  I did make a few changes like some of the others mentioned too...I used 1 can of fat free evaporated milk, and 1/2c. of heavy cream with 1/2 TBSP cornstarch. I did use a Rotisserie chicken and shred it up. Used a bit more of the lemon pepper, and creole seasoning too.  I might add a little more evaporated milk next time to get a bit more sauce.  I added 1/2c. of roasted red peppers instead of the regular red pepper, and a couple cloves of garlic when you add all the veggies. Really easy and incredibly tasty. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Very good.  I didn't find that the sauce was too runny once I mixed it with the pasta, although I did have it in the oven for about 30 min before serving so that probably thickened it up a little bit.  The spiciness of the chicken with the cream was a nice combination.

Fantastic!  I added 1/2 lb of medium shrimp to the recipe.  We all loved it and I plan on making this again soon.  My only suggestion is use low-salt or no-salt Cajun seasoning because it can be quite salty otherwise/

Not nearly as good as I'd hoped it would be, this recipe would rate only "fair" in my books.  But, I did forget the parmesan cheese, which I believe would have made a difference.  I also used evaporated skim milk, which was a mistake.  I will make this again, but I will use Parmesan and real cream.  I will also make sure to only put in 2 tsp of Cajun Seasoning... I used 3tsp and it was too spicy.  Maybe also a little extra lemon pepper.

VERY GOOD!I took the advice of other members and used evaporated milk instead of heavy cream. I did have to add a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce but it tasted awesome. I did use a little more butter and garlic salt with the chicken. I waited until the last minute to add the peppers so they wouldn't get"soggy". I also used bow tie pasta. Like another member said, if you don't like peppers that much, cut back. I will definately make this again.

This was the easiest pasta recipe I've ever made. The chicken was delicious dredged in the Cajun seasonings. I let them sit in the bowl for about a half hour while I was making Shrimp Etoufee and the Bread Pudding with Whiskey Sauce from this site (I did a New Orleans dinner party for Mardi Gras). We had too much left over and we ate it last night heated up and it was even better. The spices really got into the sauce. I used nonfat cooking cream instead of the heavy cream and it was still delicious and probably a little less rich. This is a keeper! Thank you Tammy!

This was SOOOOOO good - add about 1/4 cup water mixed with about 2 Tablespoons flour with the sauce to make it more creamy - I used approx 8 ounces of pasta rather than 4.

Excellent. Using 3 large chicken breasts, I doubled the cajun seasoning, grated cheese, and lemon pepper. I used 4 green onions and a whole red pepper, not half. I used a whole box of angel hair instead of linguini, and increased the heavy cream to 2 cups. I sauteed all the seasonings along with some fresh garlic right in with the chicken, and added the grated cheese in with the heavy cream. All other measurments I left as stated. Very good recipe. It's a keeper.

This was a great dish!  It is better than my husband's favorite cajun chicken pasta at TGI Fridays.  I made a few small changes to the recipe.  I added Cajun spices to taste, we like our cajun spicey, and cut the chicken into strips.  I think we have a new favorite in our house.  Props to the person who submitted this recipe!

Great recipe! I added red pepper flakes instead of fresh red pepper because I didn't have any. Also, tried this with and without andouille sausage. We loved this and cannot get over how quick and easy it was to prepare. Will make this many more times.

This was a delicious, easy dish.  I added about 2 cups of sliced mushrooms, and about 1/2 cup julienned sundried tomatoes, as well as 4-5 cloves fresh minced garlic.  Instead of the cream, I used 1 14 oz. can chicken broth and a splash of white wine.  Towards the end I added fresh basil and 4 oz. crumbled feta, and twice as much parmesan. Wonderful!

I don't understand what's so special about this recipe? Just a normal pasta dish.
Maybe in Holland we are more used to this kind of dishes (?)
I enjoyed eating it, but will not make it again.

This recipe was good, quick and easy.  I used left over roast chicken and since I'm not a big fan of cream, I used half and half and a slurry of water and flour, for thicknesses, and like others kicked up the amount of cajun seasoning.  This was really good.

This is delicious.  I basically doubled the recipie.  I used 3 chicken breasts, and sprinkled a pinch of cajun seasoning on each side of the chicken breast.  Next time I might do two pinches per side.  I used 2 cups of heavy cream, adn I used an entire box of Linguinie.  It turned out perfectly.  I will definatly be making this again.

Thought this recipe was excellent.  I cooked the chicken with all the spices and then added 1 T. of flour to the chicken mixture and cooked for 1 min. to  so the sauce wouldn't be too thin.  It was plenty spicey for me. I also used more pasta than called for, about 8-10 oz.  I used chicken tenders instead of breasts.  My kids even liked it!  This is a keeper!

This is great. I soaked the chicken in a bowl of water with a little more cajun season for 10 minutes before cooking. I also added Romano cheese to the sauce to help thicken.

I am teaching my fiance how to cook, and this is the first recipe he made on his own.  It is incredibly easy, fast, and delicious!  The first time we attemped this recipe, I disregarded the amount suggested for cajun spice, and our dish was terribly salty and spicy.  We threw it out and tried again, this time following the recipe exactly, and it was perfect.

Very easy to make but not as good as everyone makes it out to be.  I dont know if it was the Cajun seasoning I used or if it was something else, but I thought the dish was bland. I doubled the seasoning and it still had very little flavor.  I didn't add mushrooms but added yellow and orange bell pepper instead.  The dish was very easy to make and it fit well for a fast and easy weeknight dinner.  I would not recommend it for entertaining.

My husband usually turns up his nose at anything with pasta or chicken. He's a beef man.  But he absolute loves this dish.  Even our children 6 and 11 clean their plates and ask for second helpings!  It is quick, easy and I usually have all of the ingredients on hand.  Love it!!!!!

What a great recipe.  I followed the recipe except I added Aspargus and chopped jalapenos to it.  It was a great success and you can bet I will be making this dish again.

Really really fabulous!  My five year old ate five servings!  I used penne instead of linguine because I don't have time to cut up pasta for my four small children, but it worked really well.

I thought this was great. I made a few changes though. I doubled the recipe but only used 1 red bell pepper and 1 green bell pepper and I left out the mushrooms. I added more cajun seasoning than the recipe called for and also added cayenne pepper to the chicken. I took the advise on cutting back on the milk. I used 1 & 1/2 cups of half and half which was more than enough with the recipe being doubled. I thought it came out very flavorful and delicious!!!

This recipe was outstanding..I have to rate this a five star because my husband won't so much as touch a pepper or a onion but I was amazed when even he came over to the counter and reached for a dish of this. He LOVED it!!WOW!! My children even loved it.I added a bit more cajun seasoning and added a bit of thickening to the sauce. I also added 4tablespoons of wine. This was so easy but yet very fancy to serve.ABSOLUTELY GREAT!!!!!!

I followed this recipe to the T... and I thought it was totally bland and boring.  Next time, if I bother to make it again, I would add white wine and more cajun seasoning, and cut back the basil.

Very good.  I seldom have heavy cream on hand, so I just use what I do have, which is usually skim milk.  I thicken the sauce then, with a flour-liquid paste.

I cannot convince myself that this should be added to the regular rotation.  It was very tasty, however I thought the sauce was too thin and with all that heavy cream - not exactly what I would consider healthy!

This is a definite winner.  You could also use other vegis such as broccoli or others to spice the recipe up.  This will become a staple at our house a wonderful blend of New Orleans style cuisine.

As I was reading all the rave reviews of this dish I was thinking it could not possibly be THAT good--but, oh was I mistaken!  This dish is so unbelievably tasty!  As many others, I used about 3/4 the recommended heavy cream and added flour for thickening.  I also added fresh minced garlic and a little extra basil.  I made this dish for nine people, ranging in age from 14-60 and everyone, including my very picky little sister, loved it!  I will definitely make it again.

What a great recipe, and oh-so-easy too!  This was one of the best cream sauces I've ever made.  It was a bit runny tho', so you might want to thicken it up w/ some flour or do what we did - we blackened the chicken in a hot skillet and then finished it up with a quick broil in the oven, removed the chix, and then poured the sauce into the skillet to scrape up all the blackened goodness and also thicken it.  We also added some Cajun seasoning (abt 1 tsp) to the sauce.  If I cld give this more than 5 *'s, I would! :)

I love spicy, unusual foods, and this one hit the spot. My husband enjoyed it too, and he tends to be picky at times. I thought it had alot of liquid, could possibly cut down on the amount of heavy cream that the recipe called for. Other than that, it was great!

I followed everyones advice and added more cajun spice plus fresh garlic & more basil too.  Since I don't like the crunch of onions and peppers (and the kids don't either)I sauteed them in the butter then added the chicken (used 3 chicken breasts)to that mixture. I also used half cream/half milk and brought it to a boil to thicken it.  More mushrooms too.  I thought it was very tasty and so did my oldest son (although he added cayenne pepper to his).  My youngest son wasn't crazy for it and my husband thought it was okay (and he spiced it up with habanero pepper) but he's not fond of cream sauces and would have preferred it if it had a tomato sauce base.  Once again can't please them all!!! :)

My husband and I loved this recipe! I would suggest using part half and half though. I used all heavy cream and it was a little too rich.
I also added shrimp and more cajun seasoning. 
Delicious!

Thanks for sharing such a wonderful meal.  I too doubled the cajun, and even added some cayanne and red onion with the peppers.  I also used half and half instead of the heavy whip to try and cut the fat.. it still tasted great.  Certainly a new favorite for my husband and I.

Wow!  This was fantastic!  I even cheated on a couple things.  I used 1/2 can cream of mushroom soup and enough milk to equal the amount of cream it called for.  And the only other seasoning I added other than the cajun seasoning (use more!) was some fresh minced garlic.  I tossed everything with fresh grated parmesan...mmmmm, very good!

I tried this recipe last week and my husband and I both LOVED it!  I used a little more cajun seasoning than was called for and it was really great!  I would suggest cutting up the chicken into strips for better presentation. This is yummy!

My husband and I loved this - tasty, quick and easy.  I, like others, added an additional teaspoon of the cajun seasoning and it was perfect.  I served it with a salad and garlic cheese bread.  This is a definite keeper - thanks for sharing!

Love it. Has made it quite often. The only recommendation I can make is to use the low sodium Cajun seasoning and I put way more seasoning in than the recipe calls for.  I also use baby portobellos.

I really liked this. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because my teenage boys didn't like it as much.  But my husband did. I did do some tweaks. I tripled the recipe for 4 of us because we wanted leftovers but I should have just doubled it. I did half and half cream and whole cream. But it didn't need as much as it called for when it was tripled. It looked MUCH creamier than the picture. t also didn't need  quite all the peppers when tripling it. I didn't want to overcook the chicken but I wanted a thicker sauce so once everything was added, I took the chicken pieces out so they wouldn't overcook. I added corn starch to thicken it up.  I made my own cajun seasoning because I could tweet it the way I wanted it and I had all the basic spices.look it up on line.  I added 1 1/2 of the cajun spice so it had good flavor. My hubby thought it was salty enough so I omitted the salt and added 2 shakes of lemon essential oil which we loved instead of the lemon pepper which was salty tasting. I added the green onions just before I added the chicken back in because I didn't want them too soft.  My hubby wants this again so maybe I will do it when the kids are gone.

Used frozen left over chicken, pepper veggie mix also frozen, almond milk , rice pasta and an Emeril cajun spice mix I had made previously.  It was very good and less rich than the original recipe .  The rice fettuccini  is starchy so  it thickened the sauce a bit.

Oh. My. God. Make this RIGHT NOW. It’s quick, easy and delicious. You could add other vegetables to if you want to, like maybe some frozen peas. I didn’t have heavy cream so I used half-and-half and it was still delicious. We also sprinkled a little bit of crushed red pepper on the top at the end because we like things spicy.

I made a bigger portion of this using a whole box of pasta using 5 chicken cutlets, 1 lb of shrimp and 1lb of chorizo sausage, 4 peppers, 1 small box of portabella mushrooms, times 4 on the spices and 4 cups of heavy cream. My wife was in love with it and so was I.

made this recipe a few times and followed it to the bone...  amazing taste and kids love it also...this is made with 35% cooking cream therefore if your looking for non fat, your not at the right place...  fat = flavor!  great recipe and highly recommend without having to replace or change anything...  If you replace or change anything,  well you'r not making this recipe period!

I had 3 chicken breasts so doubled all the sauce ingredients. I did have to add about 1/4 cup flour to thicken the sauce. Overall, this was a very good dish.

This recipe is a an awesome base. What I love about cooking is adding and making changes in my own way. This recipe calls for chicken. Chicken can be bland on it's own, but in a pasta it can get lost if you do not pre-season to your liking. I prefer to use andouille sausage that is sliced for us grown ups or cut into pieces for our children. It seems to add a more depth to the flavor of the recipe. I always use fresh ingredients for the peppers and for the onion and for the herbs (if you have them - Sometimes I use dry and just add more).  Cooking is an art so cook the peppers and the onion to your liking. Some like it crisp and some do not. Cook to your choosing.  Last, I also add garlic because why not? It is a cajun medley. Also, I sometimes add cilantro for an extra kick and flavor sensation. It melds out in the recipe pretty well if you like it.  The seasoning in the recipe I thought was a little weak. Just keep adding until it suites your taste. Play with the recipe and have fun. Sometimes coloring outside the lines is fun!! Make it your own. Above all enjoy!

Fantastic dish! I didn’t add the green onions when the recipe says to, I added them when the dish was done. 1st time I mad it, it made the onions soggy. This way was much better.

Wonderful recipe.  I did not have all of the ingredients so I substituted the cream with mushroom soup and Creole seasoning (is this the same as Cajun?).  I can't wait to try as written, we loved it.

I made this recipe for the first time. I used penne instead of linguini and chicken thighs instead of breasts. This is definitely going to be in our rotation. It is not overly spicy, but just spicy enough to remind me of my cajun roots.

My first time making it and it came out amazing. Forgot to buy heavy cream, I substitute it with organic milk, flour and sour cream and it was just as creamy and delicious

This was easy to make and it tasted great. I'd suggest to leave your vegetables cut thick. I added shrimp that I had steamed in cajun seasoning at the grocery store as the sauce was cooking down. It went really well with the chicken in this meal. Thanks!

I have made this recipe so many times and it’s always good. I’ve made it with chicken and I’ve made it with shrimp. Always good but tonight it was excellent. What was the difference?  Well, I’m on a somewhat keto, low carb, low sugar version of an eating plan. So I made it with heavy cream. I’ve always used half and half before to try and save calories. Well on my diet, it’s better to use heavy cream because there’s no sugar in heavy cream. This made an incredible difference in flavor. Oh and I didn’t eat it on pasta - I just ate it straight and I didn’t even miss the pasta. Promise. I did make some alterations due to what I had on hand. Didn’t have green bell pepper so only used red. Didn’t have fresh mushrooms but canned work out fabulous. Added some minced garlic because I always do.   And I only used a cup of heavy cream because it seemed like enough and it was. Wow. Very good.

Absolutely loved this, though it needed a few large twerks, um tweaks. First off make your own cajun spice mix, there is a recipe on this site. Secondly, coat the chicken with it just enough to cover all the chopped chicken, it’s around 5 teaspoons of spice or more but it’s worth it. I left the coated chicken in the fridge all day. Second tweak was instead of using lemon pepper use ground pepper and add grated lemon zest, it tastes less artificial. Lastly add around a tsp of cornstarch to the sauce so it actually thickens into one. Ab fab!

We have made this twice since finding it on the site.  The first time exactly as written and the second increasing the seasoning tremendously and enjoyed it more the second time around.  Will be keeping this one around with the increases.

The whole family loves this, reminds them of something they get in a restaurant.  I make it quite a bit .  Followed recipe exactly except omitted mushrooms and simmered chicken in sauce for about 15 minutes before adding noodles.

Gave this recipe a try and there was mixed reviews between my husband  and me. I followed the recipe with the exceptions of a couple modifications: using fresh minched garlic instead of garlic powder, increasing the cajun seasoning slightly, and using half & half with a little cornstarch in place of heavy cream. (also used more pasta)
My husband really enjoyed it, but I found the dish lacking in a cohesive flavor. It tastes better as leftovers as the seasonings have time to meld together. Definitely NOT a showstopper.

This was delicious! I did add a chopped red onion with the vegetables. The only criticism is the linguini— USE PENNE!!  I love linguini in other dishes but it doesn’t quite work here—- this screams for something tubular :)

Definitely make the roux if you plan to make this recipe.  3 times I’ve made this and the sauce is soupy each time which drowns the flavor out making it bland.

My husband loved this. And, while pasta is my least favorite food, I liked it quite a bit too! I made it as the contributor described, with two exceptions: 1) I took other reviewers' suggestions and added cornstarch to thicken the sauce. 2) I added chopped fresh basil right before serving. Thank you for the delicious recipe!

This recipe was very bland. I doubled the seasonings, and added some extra Cajun seasoning. The fat was VERY high in this recipe, so I used greek yogurt and milk instead of cream which turned out great. With several adjustments to the base of this recipe, it turned out well.

Brilliant! I second the recommendation to add extra cajun seasoning.  This will be a favorite.

Really just added more Cajun spice to the sauce and threw in some spicy sausage. Turned out great! Will definitely make it again.

This is me and my fiances absolute favorite.  I will rotate doing chicken and shrimp to change it up.  We like more spice so I add more cajun seasoning than it asks for.  Tastes like a restaurant.

So glad I tried this recipe!  I made this pasta with roasted chicken from the grocery store, so my version is slightly different.  I sauteed the mushrooms, onions, and peppers, stirred in the heavy cream, and added the basil, garlic powder, and both lemon and black peppers.  After cutting up the chicken into bite-size pieces, I added it to the pan, along with the Cajun seasoning.  It does need some time to thicken, so I kept it on the stove for about 15 minutes, then blended it in with the linguine and it came out perfect.  We did end up adding a bit more Cajun seasoning to make it a bit spicier, but overall I think this is a great recipe with just the right amount of good ingredients, but it was not overwhelmingly heavy as some Cajun pasta can be.  With the sprinkled parmesan cheese, this was a hit!  I'll definitely make it again!

Definitely will make it again. I had some trouble finding heavy cream, but milk seemed to substitute pretty well. Beforehand, I simmered the milk for some time after it boiled to thicken it as much as possible, and it turned out great once I added it to mix. Also I didn't have lemon pepper on hand, so I used citric acid which added a nice touch to the meal. Awesome recipe!

I didn't change or add any ingredient. I did change the presentation. I seasoned the chicken breasts with the Cajun seasoning and let it marinate a couple of hours in the frig.  I cooked the 2 chicken breasts, removed them from the pan, covered to keep warm. Then I followed the rest of the recipe. After adding the pasta to the veggies and sauce I then sliced the  chicken and put it on top of individual servings of the pasta mixture. Add a little parm and whala.

This dish is now a staple! I’ve been making it for over a year now. No longer need the recipe!  As many people have tweaked it to make it their own, so have I. Instead of the either or pepper mix, I dice rainbow peppers (3 pack) w/ 4 green onion stems. The Cajun seasoning we use is made by McCormick. Unfortunately in my area, we can no longer get it! We’ve substituted an off brand but chose to liven things up with cayenne pepper during the Cajun tossing portion. (Also did a semi Cajun marinade for the chicken with some white wine vinegar and olive oil, over night). As my spouse does not like mushrooms, we omit them. The simmer time is a little linger as we don’t add any thickeners. When all is said and done, it’s always amazing! Oh and as many people have pointed out, use more seasoning. Love the recipe but the original just doesn’t have enough.

So good!! I didn’t have onion or mushroom to add so added a little fresh spinach at the end. Also did use about a tsp cornstarch to thicken. This is going to be a staple recipe. Thank you

With so many positive reviews I expected MUCH better than this. I added more cajun just like everyone else suggested. The sauce was so bland it tasted like eating buttered noodles with dry rub chicken. It has no flavor. The sauce needs a serious makeover for this recipe to be any good at all. Definitely DO NOT recommend.

Sooooo good!! Didn't use mushrooms. Used red, yellow and orange peppers. I also added cayenne pepper on top of the Cajun seasoning for that extra little kick. I use shredded parmesan instead of grated Parmesan, and I mixed it right in with the pasta and the chicken. I will definitely make this again!

I used angel hair pasta instead of spaghetti noodles which make a world of difference.  Also, I reduced the lemon-pepper to 1/4 and I added way more “Cajun seasoning”. I used “Slap ya mama” with the yellow top. My household is from Louisiana so we love spicy.

Super yum and easy!! Saving this for a regular pasta dish.  I would recommend giving the sauce enough time to thicken after adding the cream as there were lots of goodies and lots of liquid that didn't come together as a cohesive sauce.  My adjustments: I made it for mardi gras and added andouille sausage, and eliminated the green peppers and added more red to replace.  Makes great leftovers as well!

Used crawfish instead of chicken, more onions, black pepper, lots of pepper jack cheese and minced garlic.  Turned a good meal into a true gourmet culinary masterpiece.

We havent made any changes other than we dont add mushrooms or lemon pepper, and sometimes we will use only red peppers or only green...this recipe is so good minor changes like that wont make a difference. Excellent for leftovers for lunch or another supper...

Very good! The sauce was a bit liquidity though, so I added cornstarch. Thickened up more when you add the parm at the end. Will make again

I added 2 cajun sausages cut into bite sized pieces which I sauteed with the chicken. 
I am not a fan of mushrooms so I left them out.  I also used pre chopped onion/celery blend and pre chopped multi colored pepper blend.  Last, I added some red pepper flake for a little heat (it is cajun pasta, afterall).  It was delicious.   I will definitely make this again.

Very good and not very difficult to make! I did add more Cajun seasoning than what it called for. And substituted zucchini for the mushrooms. Definitely will make this again!

I didn't care for this dish.  I did change it and cooked the seasoned chicken with a sous vide but the sauce just wasn't that good.  Maybe my wife and I just don't like these flavors.

Made this the other night and it was delicious...only changes I made were fresh basil and I used only red pepper as I don’t like green. Very good and will definitely make again.

I was expecting a kick in the flavor but the Cajun spices were mellow. I did double the recipe for my big family and added 2 tbsp of cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  Family loved it!

Delicious. I added some cooked Andouille sausage. I used a frozen pepper onion mix as recommended by another reviewer and  omitted the mushrooms.i also added a slurry on cornstarch and heavy cream to thicken the sauce and added about 1/4 cup extra Parmesan cheese at the end.

Amazingly easy and delicious! If you like spicy, don't be afraid to add some extra chili flakes. Also, I didn't have heavy cream when I made this so instead I used sour cream. It worked! Would recommend 10 out of 10.

I took the advice of others and used a rotisserie chicken and pre-cut frozen veggies. The chicken worked out fine, but the veggies ended up pretty mushy. Still, the flavors were good. I'll make it again.

Loved the dish, the ratio of chicken and noodles seemed pretty low compared to the heavy cream. I did twice the pasta and chicken with two cups of the heavy cream but it turned out great!. You definitely need to turn up the heat some after the cream has been added in order to cook it down. Also add the Cajun seasoning to taste, I ended up putting in significantly more.

This is so good! I let my cream bubble for a bit while longer than just “heating through” and I didn’t measure the seasonings, just eyeballed a decent amount of each (I’m guessing a little more than what was called for but we don’t like bland food around here) and made some garlic toast on the side. This isn’t spicy so good for the whole family.

This turned out  just okay and not any spice really. I did stick to the recipe, but added a little celery just to keep with the Cajun Trinity and a bit of jalapeno and fresh minced garlic...just because it sounded good. I didn't really taste it during cooking because it smelt so good! I had to thicken the sauce with cornstarch and a bit of milk but it seemed to work itself out. And instead of topping with parm I dumped it in the sauce to help thicken that up too. I thawed about a half a pound of shrimp in the pasta water during boiling and served the sauce over shrimp pasta mix.  I added hot sauce at the table and the BF just wanted more of a kick. So I seasoned up the leftovers and hope for the best lunch tomorrow. Thank you for sharing!!

I had most if the ingredients and it was something new to try. It was pretty quick to throw together and not alot of messy cleanup.  I liked the end result and will likely try it again with variations. I really like Allrecipes site as it makes me want to explore more ideas in the kitchen!

This dish is so easy and fast  to make and the family loved it.  I used already made Alfredo sauce and doubled the mushrooms.   Forgot to use any of the spices and it was still great.     Definitely a make again!!

Unfortunately I used too much cajun seasoning, 2 tbl and that made it too spicy for my DH. I thought it was good. Next time will make with the amount of cajun seasoning in recipe or not use it at all.

This actually had a lot of flavor. My husband and I are fans. This tasted like something I would order from a restaurant. The only bell pepper I used was an orange one because those are my favorite, and then I added broccoli and did not use mushrooms. I added extra of everything so that we could have leftovers - it tastes just as great the next day.

Reallly delicious recipe, and even better - was quite quick! I decided to use the pre-chopped/sliced veggies from the produce section of my grocery store (red & green bell peppers and onions - a fajita mix) so prep was minimal.

Delicious sauce - probably didn't even need the parmesan, but it was a great touch.  Winner!

Easy Peasy. Mostly stuck to the recipe (but used frozen chicken strips) and it was a hit, as the moms say. Agree with those who added extra vegetable goodness. This is a recipe you can experiment with seeing the foundation has already been taken care of. Try it out if you need a quick delicious meal. ??

I didn't have a red bell pepper so I used the 2 green that I had. Rather had red to give it more color. The only other thing I would change, I would leave out the salt. It's plenty salty  with all the other seasonings. I made this exactly like the recipe and it's very good, except too salty for my taste.

I found it delicious.  I only eat chicken wings, so therefore needed some liquid to cook them, before adding the cream.  I did fry the mushrooms and pepper, but only added them to the chicken towards the end.  I have just realised that I forgot the parmesan.  And I went especially to buy it too.

Really good but I think I would add more cajin seasoning , salt and maybe fresh basil. Used half/half but just 1/2 cup. No problem with thickness with sauce as cheese made it a bit thicker

Very good! My additions were increased portions. I added 8 oz of pasta, 2 cups of heavy scream, 2 tablespoons of Cajun seasoning, 1 red bell pepper, and 1/4 tsp of Garlic powder. I also added a jalapeño pepper because I like a little bit more kick and 1/4 tsp of corn starch to thicken the sauce. Very good meal.

This was a really great pasta recipe. Definitely of restaurant quality. However I was really wishing for more of a spicy Cajun flavor, and I even put a tablespoon & more extra. I feel the heavy cream drowned out any intense flavor potential. I will need to try this again later with the sour cream substitution to see if it helps bring out the Cajun spice. Also, the sauce was so thin I needed to make a quick roux to thicken it up, and it did perfectly!

this was the bomb dignity! absolutely delicious, but I'll admit that I tweaked it. I finely minced a half pound of andouille sausage and used 3/4lb shrimp instead of chicken. AMAZING dish regardless. definitely making again!!

Awesome recipe.  I did not have green and red peppers so I used broccoli and cherry tomatoes (cut in half and added at the end).  I don't like green peppers anyway.  I love recipes that can be versatile.  I also added some corn starch as other reviewers recommended because I like a thicker sauce.

I substituted zucchini noodles and half and half for a healthier version and it was absolutely delicious! However the sauce was more of a soupy mixture. Next time I will use less half and half, corn starch to thicken the sauce, and a little more cayenne pepper. Aside from that, it's a great recipe that I'll be using again!

This recipe is delicious. Needs ALOT more cajun seasoning than this recipe calls for. Add as needed.

Delicious.  I grilled bone in chicken breast then tossed it in the Cajun seasoning before adding it to the cooked peppers.  Wouldn’t change a thing!!

Good base, but it appeared to be very bland.  I decided to double the chicken and vegies as I was looking for leftovers.I like to use fresh vegies and for the bell peppers I sliced up half a yellow, red and orange.  I added 1/2 an Anaheim chili to spice it up. 3 cloves of garlic, 2 green onions and 5 large mushrooms.  I didn't have heavy cream so I used a substitute (milk and butter) and added some flour to thicken the sauce. Next time I may try using the half n half.  For the Canjun spice I followed Emeril's Creole receipe (very simple to put together)  I also added a 1/2 tsp of dried basil.  The end result tasted great!!

My husband and I live Cajun cuisine.  However, as we have grown older.....we love spicy....but our stomachs do not. Finding a mildly spicy dish can be a challenge. This delivered.....mildy spicy and full of flavor. This was a very easy receipe to make. Chopping is a bit time consuming but well worth the effort!  If you work....( I did for many years and then came home to my second job....caring for my children and my home) you can easily do  prep work on the weekend. Throw a salad together (I bought the premade) and some garlic toast (also premade from the freezer section of my grocery store! Even without the prep work....an easy meal for your family. If you're single....this only makes 2 servings.  if you have a family....with a salad and bread it easily stretches to feed 4.  My only suggestion is to go ahead and cut the chicken into bite sized pieces before cooking.

I was afraid this dish would be too spicy for my kids, but all of them asked for seconds, and my husband said this was the best pasta dish he has ever had. I took this recipe and made it my own a little bit so if yo have certain spices or tricks you know your family likes I recommend incorporating them into this dish. You do that and chances are it will be a hit.

I've made Cajun Chicken Pasta over 50 times in the past several years making many changes along the way.  Started with whole milk or half and half, now I usually use heavy cream.  I've cut down on the amount of chicken generally using 1 3/4 - 2 pounds of chicken breasts, but 4 cups of cream.  I'll use 4 teaspoons of Cajun seasoning for the chicken, double the amount of peppers and green onions but quadruple the other spices for the 4 cups of cream I use. Generally, I use about 14 ounces of bow tie pasta for this recipe.   Also, I end up using 1/2-3/4 cup Parmesan.  Sometimes mushrooms, sometimes not.
As far as pasta, I started with linguine, but have been using bow tie pasta which my family seems to like better.  I will cook the pasta very al dente, drain it, and let it finish cooking in the sauce.  The starch in the pasta thickens the sauce and the pasta absorbs the flavors.  I end up having a thick, creamy sauce.  For those who'd like a little more kick, they can dust a little Cajun seasoning and crushed red pepper on top.  With a salad and French bread, you've got a great tasting and quickly prepared dinner.

This is an excellent recipe! My husband is a picky eater but this was perfect! I am going to make again and add shrimp and maybe some broccoli. The only thing I did different was make a roux with flour and butter to thicken the sauce. This one is a keeper and definitely going into the rotation! Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe - it’s one of my husband’s favorites! Make sure to simmer it long enough to get the right consistency (thicker) and we definitely needed to add more Cajun seasoning and salt.

This is fantastic!  Would give this 10 stars if I could.  Have made it several times and always a hit.  One additional step I make is to first blacken the chicken using the Blackened Seasoning Mix by contributor DJBPITT on this site (then adding the Cajun spice called for in this recipe to the cream sauce instead of rubbing on the chicken).  Its perfect and reheats well despite being a heavy cream base.  Thank you Tammy!

This is my one of my go to recipes! I made this once for my mom and she was asking for it again the next day. I tend to add more parm than the recipe calls for cause who doesn't love cheese?? I also let the sauce thicken a bit more than called for. Sometimes I add the mushrooms and sometimes I don't. depends on the last time I went to the store. and the colors of peppers also depends on what I have. but overall...this is my go to!!

Doubled the amount of Cajun seasoning as suggested by many reviewers, then followed as written.  The cream sauce was  yum but next time I would use butter & flour to make a roux and use milk instead of cream to make it lighter.  Definitely a keeper.

I used fat free milk in place of the cream and used a bit of corn starch to thicken. Yummy!

Loved it but I shouldn't have cooked the peppers as much as I did. I would suggest barely searing. I loved it but best of all, my daughter had JUST come home from having a baby so it'll be a recipe for life. I added a little crushed red peppers just because we like things a little hot.

I made this exactly as written with two exceptions. I made homemade pasta, and I didn't have lemon pepper seasoning so I squeezed three quarters of a lemon into the chicken and vegetable mixture in added a lot of pepper. My husband said it's my favorite dish so far with the exception of my stuff shells! Definitely a 5-star

Followed this recipe almost exactly and it came out great!! Letting it simmer is key. Longer is simmers, the thicker the sauce will get. My husband loved it! Well definitely be making again! Thanks!

Very good as is, but I added shrimp and sun-dried tomatoes. I also added the ingredients to taste and substituted simple Italian seasoning for basil. I didn't use ant lemon pepper seasoning and I added a little corn starch to thicken the sauce. Very good

We really liked this. I used Creole Seasoning from this website, and it was medium on the spicy scale. I didn't have heavy cream, just half and half, and it was a bit runny. So I added some Italian blend cheese to the sauce, and that helped thicken it a bit. It made a nice meal that I'll try again some time.

I have been making this recipe for years after seeing it in a Taste of Home cookbook.  The original recipe calls for eight slices of red and green peppers  and 1 to 2 cups of whipping cream.  I find that 1 1/4 cups is good.  Since I like mushrooms I use all of an 8oz container.  I don't like lemon-pepper so I leave that out.   This is  a great easy dinner.

I made this cajun chicken pasta and it was wonderful.
I would make it again.  Did not have any basil so I substituded thyme and it still came out very flavorful.  That is the only change I made to this receipe.

I swapped linguine for egg noodles, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. It is extremely important to lower the heat before adding the cream. I found it thickened up quite nicely! Delicious recipe!

Turned out delicious!! Very happy with the results. We like it more spicy so I added an entire jalapeño cut into thin slices.  Will probably add two next time.

I added 1/4 cup of flour to the cajun spices.  Put uncooked pasta in sprayed pan and layed fried chicken breasts ontop.  Included onion, tomato, and yellow squash into the other vegies.  Vegie-alfredo sauce mixture spread over the chicken and baked at 35o degrees for 45 minutes.  Husband and his buddy made me save this recipe, which is why I am a first time member of Allrecipes.  Thx.

First tried this recipe at my aunts house nearly 15 years ago.  I've been making it ever since! It is delicious. One thing I will say is,  using half and half is not the way to go. To the reviewer who gave this one star and used half and half and then complained it was soupy pasta well duh! The recipe called for  heavy cream and that is exactly what needs to be used for this creamy and tasty pasta to work out.

I worked at O'Charley's while I was in college and LOVED their Bayou Shrimp Pasta. I am happy to announce that this is very respectable competitor!

I opted, like others here, to sub skim milk with a tablespoon of flour as thickener. Just make a roux with the butter from the saute and flour, brown it will, then add the milk to make something similar to a gravy. Skim milk doesn't thicken as quickly as the higher fat varieties, but it will thicken if you let it simmer long enough. Better to risk it getting a little too thick than to turn it off too early.

I will absolutely make this again.

My husband loved it!  I thought it was pretty good.  It was easy to prep and cook.  It's not super spicy, but just enough.  I would've used a little more bell peppers and mushrooms. And I did use more parm cheese.  ;)
I'll be making this again.

I loved this recipe because of its versatility and highly recommend it. My husband is extremely picky and my biggest pet peeve is watching people pick food off their plate. 

The base sauce is fantastic (i added some rose wine and let everything simmer before adding the heavy cream - I usually work with what I got since herbs and spices are expensive and we are on a budget) but it still came out delicious. Mine had more kick from the spicy Caribbean pepper I used instead but delicious nonetheless. 

I had read reviews before making it and sprinkled some flour while it simmered away happily to make it thicker. Someone mentioned 1 tbsp cornstarch - I wouldn't recommend that; cornstarch is a major league binder and will probably make your sauce into gravy if you're not careful. 

I'm adding this to my recipe book; it'll probably go really great with shrimp, too!

Made it with more or less the changes suggested by VBHOKIE.  Incredibly delicious but it would be hard not to be with all that delectable cream. Not overly spicy and just what I had in mind.

The taste was fabulous, but the sauce was more like a soup.  Just added a few teaspoons of cornstarch, and it thickened right up.  Definitely will make this again!

I added cooked broccoli and omitted the mushrooms, and I used 3 fat cloves of minced fresh garlic. My family loved it! I would only suggest removing the chicken and veggies once they're cooked, then pouring in the cream and simmering it until it's nice and thick before adding the meat and veggies back in. My sauce turned out a bit on the thin side, but it was delicious otherwise. Would make again!

I wrote a recipe for cajun chicken pasta on a recipe card and I thought it was this one because most of the ingredients are almost the same. But the recipe I have calls for 2 cups evaporated milk and when everything is cooked add the cooked linguine and bring it to a boil and then simmer for a few minutes. Without boiling it and then simmering it I can see how it would be watery because mine was at first. Also I had about a tablespoon of blackened seasoning left (not cajun) and it was definatley not spicy enough so I added more cayenne to it. I added fresh garlic and some tomatoes and subbed regular onions for green onions.

I stumbled on this recipe after staring at a package of chicken breasts in the refrigerator and not knowing what I wanted to do with it. This receipt is fast and very easy. The only difference I made was using angel hair pasta instead of the linguini. I also used garlic pepper

This is a pretty darn good cajun pasta. I added about double the cajun seasoning though and some cayenne pepper which took it over the top. My husband ate the whole bowl and said he would eat it again and he hates pretty much anything that is not meat and potatoes.

Turned out delicious. Had to leave out the chicken and substitute the heavy cream for coconut cream since my daughter is vegan but still turned out delicious.

Made the recipe with the following changes: used rotini, as that is what we had on hand, used green and yellow pepper, for the same reason, used half-and-half cream with a bit of cornstarch and omitted the lemon pepper as we didn't have any.  This was still really good and easy to prepare, and the sauce didn't suffer as a result of skipping the heavy cream.  We did find this very "pepper-y" and I wonder if the lemon pepper would have pushed it over the edge, had we used some.  All in all, a good meal and I would make it again.

The recipe was Great!!! I really enjoyed it, it was even better the 2nd day. I made no substitutions to the recipe except adding an extra chicken breast and I did a tablespoon of each seasoning to give it more kick. EXCELLENT RECIPE!! MOST DEFINITELY WILL BE MAKING IT AGAIN.

I cooked a pound of linguini figuring we'd use what  we needed and save the rest (tossed a bit of olive oil on it to keep it from sticking). I sauted a large chopped sweet onion in butter. Shoved it to the edge of the pan. Added the chicken strips with the cajun spice and a bit more butter. Put in the chopped green pepper and one chopped chipolte pepper. Added 2 large cloves of minced garlic. Added the basil. Sauted all. Poured in  1 1/2 cups of half and half and some milk. Boiled it down until it made a sauce (no cornstarch needed, just took some time). It was delicious served over the linguini.

Made almost as written with the following changes.  Used the Cajun spice recipe from this site, (1 T).  Because I was afraid of runny sauce, I made a roux using butter, flour and milk.  Mixed in the chicken and veggies and poured over pasta.  Very good!

Made it to a T.....ok ok I didnt use as many peppers because I only had one. More wouldve been great. The sauce is very runny and it doesnt taste all that cajun to me. Probably going to add way more next time. Maybe let it sit for a bit before cooking. Overall, this is one of those pastas that dont have that thick sauce to steal the show. It doesnt need to be thick and you dont have to spoon it up into a bowl to eat it like a soup. I think youre suppose to mix it up and fork it out with tongs. The flavor will be there! Leave the remaining sauce behind. This is pretty tasty and will probably be a regular in our recipes.

It was okay. I took another reviewer's advice and used frozen veggies, but I won't do that next time. The fresh veggies will add more flavor.  The sauce was very soupy, so I added 2 tsp corn starch to thicken the sauce. I did use the heavy cream as directed. I doubled the Cajun seasoning amount and used a whole box of pasta....and used fresh baby bellas, halved.  I found this recipe needed lots more salt, and once served, it also needed a lot of parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. The leftovers the second day were much better...always is. I would make this again, but will use fresh veggies like I mentioned earlier.

This dish was just OK for us. The flavor was slightly bland and I followed the recipe exactly. However, it gave me the worst case of heartburn for the rest of the evening! Probably won't make it again because of that. Sorry.

O.M.G. This dish is so incredibly delicious and satisfying, I must warn that overeating is inevitable!! I made just a couple modifications to this recipe, and they worked out VERY WELL!!! Okay, so instead of grilling the chicken with oil or butter, I just boiled it in water. That way the chicken is super moist and it can be served shredded or sliced (your preference). Then remove the chicken from the water (which is now like a healthy broth) and boil the pasta in that water! Then prepare the cream sauce as directed in a skillet, adding the cajun seasoning with the cream, and adding in the already-cooked chicken. Bon Appetit!

This recipe was a hit with my family. Even my toddler liked it. I made it without mushrooms, but it was still flavorful.  
This will be a part of my dinner rotation. I may even try it with shrimp and sausage instead of chicken next time.

I love this recipe. It's absolutely delicious as written. I do find myself adding additional Cajun seasoning to my desired spice level, but that's just personal preference! Half and half will also work if you find yourself without heavy cream. Just make sure to allow it to reduce down longer.

Fabulous but like a lot of people I made changes.  First I chopped fresh garlic and threw in with the veggie saute.  Also used Costco rotisserie chicken to keep things easy and so I added the cajun seasoning to the veggies after they sauteed.  Only used 3/4 cup of heavy cream b/c that's all I had and it worked just fine. Didn't have lemon pepper so skipped it.  My husband who is a very picky eater rated it a 10!

This recipe was great! Doubled quantity to make leftovers. Took suggestions in comments: nearly doubled Cajun to taste, frozen tricolor peppers n onions, used a whole box of linguine for 4 servings. Next time I'll halve the chicken slices to better spread meat.

This was FANTASTIC!  I am from the Gulf area and NOLA cuisine is everywhere and I can honestly say that this was some of the best cajun chicken pasta I have had.  That said, I think this recipe can vary quite a bit depending on what cajun season you use, which is why i only gave it 4 stars.  I prefer Tony's however I used "Slap ya mama" season for this one and man was it spicy.  I can handle a lot of spice, but it did overpower the dish slightly and also upped the salt factor.  When I make this again, I will change it to 1 tablespoon of cajun season and see how that goes.  Other than that, the only other changes I made were omitting mushrooms and added a bit of cornstarch to the heavy cream.  It came out nice and thick and one box of linguine was perfect for the amount of sauce we had.  This was a real crowd pleaser and I will absolutely be making again.

Great recipe :) I made the Cajun seasoning myself and added extra cayenne pepper. I called it Cayenne Chicken instead of Cajun Chicken :P Nice and spicy!

This was delicious!  I followed a few of the previous reviewers' suggestions and: (i) used half a box of linguini (so about 8 oz); (ii) added more vegetables - a whole red pepper, a green pepper and about 6 oz. of mushroom slices; and (iii) whisked a tablespoon of cornstarch into the cream before adding it to the pan. Will definitely make this again.

I didn't have heavy cream so I substituted 1.5 cups milk mixed with 2/3 cup melted butter and 2 T flour. It thickened up nicely after adding it to the chicken.  I used broccoli instead of the peppers since my family doesnt care for them. This was really good!

Delicious. I doctor it up using what I have on hand and also to fit my caloric needs as I use MFP and have lost over 65 pounds in the past 10 months just by counting calories made by using recipes here and logging it. FREE & delicious! This recipe can easily be modified to be a less in calories while still retaining amazing taste by using plenty of seasonings.

I took my time with this recipe.
 I used shrimp.
I cooked the shrimp in butter garlic and coated in cajun. Then I removed the cooked shrimp. 
I cooked down sliced red and green pepper, sliced onion, and mushrooms in butter to a sauté in cajun seasoning.
I added 2 cups of heavy cream and half cup milk. Let simmer. 
mixed a bit of corn starch with heavy cream to thinken. 
added shrimp back in. simmer.
added pasta simmer
done and yum!

We absolutely LOVE this recipe!! I put my cut up chicken in a ziploc bag with the cajun seasoning over night to get the flavors through it. I left out the mushrooms because I don't like them, and I added a bit more parmesan cheese. I have made this a few times and will definitely make it again!!

Delicious. I took advice from others by adding minced garlic instead of garlic powder and thickening the sauce by using corn starch and water. Perfect!

This was an excellent recipe!  I followed other's suggestions but I added 3t cornstarch to 6t water and made a paste to add to theheavy cream.  I used 16 oz of heavy cream (just didn't want to waste it) Used Tony Chachere's seasoning as my cajun spice but added more just to taste.  I also used 3/4 of a 1 lb. box of linguine and sprinkled about 1/4 cup of parmesan instead of the 2T.  Will make again

Good recipe. The only major change was based on caloric content (used 2 cans of evaporated milk and corn starch vs the heavy cream). I can see where some say it was bland, but simply upped spices.

I love it.  It's easy to make and super creamy.  I don't change anything.  I may back off of the cajun seasoning a tiny bit but that's only because my son thinks it's too spicy.  I do not. I serve this over gluten free penne pasta.  It's awesome.

Fantastic. I've made it with 2% milk before and it still tasted great. (I just thickened the sauce up with cornstarch.) I also use way more mushrooms and red pepper than this recipe calls for.

I've made this several times. I don't always use chicken. I've used sausage, shrimp, or whatever I feel like using or have on hand. Sometimes we add a little Slap Yo Mama to it for added kick.
**always spicier the next day**

Will definitely make again. It was delicious! I used a vegan chicken substitute, vegi broth, and almond milk; it wasn't super creamy but tasted great. I think I'll add some peas next time.

Didn't make any changes, but would try a less salty Cajun seasoning than Tony Cacheres.
Family thought it was very tasty, and I will make it again!

This is awesome!  Made it several times and is always a hit!  Only changes are I double the pasta and use lite cream with corn starch to thicken... And lots more mushrooms of course!! Makes about 6 servings for us.

This recipe is amazing!  I have made it about 4 times in the last 2months.  Our family LOVES it!  I only omitted the mushrooms and used penne pasta in place of the linguine noodles. I'd recommend this to any and all of my friends!!!!!

This is an excellent chicken dish. I made my own creole seasoning which can be found here in AR as Creole Seasoning Blend. (I also gave the seasoning 5 stars.) I usually try to make the recipe as is the first time. However, I used 2 Tablespoons of the seasoning and omitted the salt. More mushrooms, 8 oz sliced mushrooms, added a lot to the sauce. I used one can of milk and 1/2 cup heavy cream in lieu of 1-1/2 cups heavy cream. A small amount of cornstarch helped in thickening the sauce. You cannot go wrong with this recipe.  Oh - and definitely boil at least half the box of linguine!

Really amazing recipe. I added 1 sliced chourizo sausage to the recipe and fried them up with the chicken strips adding a further teaspoon of Cajun spice. I also removed the meat from the pan, fried up the mushrooms a little first, then added the peppers etc. Turned out superb. Thanks for sharing!

Loved it!  Doubled the recipe but only used about 1/4 cup of half and half because that we had in the house.  Added a little corn starch at the end to thicken it up.  Glad I only had a little half and half because otherwise I think it would have been too soupy.  Substituted Montreal Chicken seasoning instead of  Lemon Pepper since it was also all I had. :)  
Awesome recipe!  Will make again!!!

Used 1/2 & 1/2 and a little cornstarch instead of cream.  Didn't have lemon pepper so added some lemon zest and extra pepper. Didn't measure the Cajun seasoning, but used a lot.  It was great, will make again.

Delicious! Used 1 lb shrimp instead of chicken, whole onion chopped instead of  green onion, 5 cloves garlic minced instead of garlic powder, 8 oz sliced mushrooms, 2 cups cream (did have to thicken with flour).  The whole family was raving about how good it was. Definitely a keeper!

I made only one edit to this recipe.  I used zero fat 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream.  Since the 0 fat cream is just a little thinner than true cream, the sauce came out  identical in flavor, a tad thinner, and not as rich.  This is a winner in my book!

Great recipe, not for those trying to watch calories but hey, we can't eat tofu every day. I recommend using 16 oz of pasta to soak up the sauce, 4 just wont cut it. Makes enough for 4 plus leftovers. Will definitely be making this again!

I've made this dish a dozen times - WE LOVE IT! I go the quick route on weekdays and buy a rotisserie chicken &  I chop off the meat. I also used frozen peppers and onions and jarred mushrooms. To cut the calories I mix half and half with the whopping cream. I also like it with bow tie noodles! Enjoy! ??????

I did almost exactly what the recipe called for . My husband hates mushrooms so I omitted them. I added about 1/2 cup of chicken broth to sauce as well as 2 tsp of corn starch to thicken sauce. Thus dish was a hit to everyone at the table

Everyone loved this! It turned out very delicious. I followed the recipe to the letter, but I put the cheese in the sauce instead of on top. Next time, however, I plan to use fresh garlic cloves.

I made no changes to this just add a bit more of all the ingredients so that there was a slight bit more, warning if you do this you will need a massive skillet or a big pot.
 This turned out wonderfully as is! Had a nice kick to it and went down a treat in my house, even my son had seconds and he swears he doesn't like spicy foods lol.
 I will make this again.

Used 1/2 and 1/2 with a tsp cornstarch instead of heavy cream, and used more Cajun seasoning than called for.  Was good but the sauce was a bit too thick.  Next time will cut back on sauce and add more veggies.

This was very good!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I felt it was lacking something.  After tasting the sauce I decided to add some more shredded parmesan cheese, and once the cheese was melted into the sauce it tasted perfect!!

Excellent!  Used whole wheat bow tie pasta, added carrots, used 8 oz baby bella mushrooms.  Forgot the basil, but it was so good as is, am going to leave it out.  Instead of cream, used 2% lactose free milk (i am lactose intolerant). Instead of just adding the milk, used 1/2 cup milk, 2 tbs butter and flour to make roux to thicken sauce.  Added to pasta/veggie mix.  Used a little chicken broth to make more sauce.  I did not add the chicken back in.  Kept it in a covered bowl to keep warm and served on top of the pasta mix.

I was surprised this was a 4.5 star recipe.  I thought it lacked flavor and was pretty bland.  I will not be making it again.  It did taste a little more flavorful the following day after the flavors marinaded overnight.

Super yummy- as others said definitely add more Cajun seasoning. I doubled the recipe and added Parmesan to the sauce to give it and Alfredo consistency. The husband had seconds! Will make again for sure!

Excellent recipe.  I did add extra cajun seasoning because we like things spicy.  I also cooked more pasta than it called for.

WOW! JUST WOW!!! I was looking for an easy recipe and stumbled on this one. It's quick, tasty, and filling. I changed the cajun seasoning because the seasoning I had was no good. I am a fan of cajun and can only can only imagine it will be just as tasty. I used Creole seasoning instead. I sautéd the veggies prior to adding the whipping cream. The only thing I'll add next time is broccoli.  I just like veggies.

This recipe was great! It was extremely simple. I made it exactly as stated just doubled the recipe with slightly less cajun seasoning (I'm not a huge fan of spice). The only issue I ran into was getting the heavy cream sauce to thicken slightly more to make it more of a sauce consistency rather than just pure liquid. Regardless, it was fantastic and I will definitely be making this recipe again!

One of my favorite recipes on this site...I usually double the recipe just so I can have left overs during the week. I do end up thickening the sauce with corn starch at the end.

I made this tonight for dinner and was very pleased.
1. As a busy mom, I love a good meal I can pull together in less than 30 minutes. This recipe was quick and easy, 25 minutes tops, even with prep time cutting up veggies, etc.
2. I added probably 2 more tablespoons of Cajun seasoning than the recipe calls for. The key is to build up the flavor by adding spices as the dish cooks, to taste. Not just at the beginning. I also used garlic salt vs. powder and cut down on the salt the recipe calls for, and I added more mushrooms  (why would you only add 4?) and some sliced red onion, along with the peppers and green onions. Next time, I'll add broccoli or cut up asparagus for crunch. 
3.

The family liked it! The creamy sauce and peppers were yummy! Definitely my favorite parts of the dish, as well as the cajun ??. The peppers make it colorful.

I used another reviewers suggestion and used a rotisserie chicken  and used more pasta.  I also added corn starch to thicken it up.  It was delicious.  Just the right amount of spice and nice and thick.  A hit!

This is my favorite go-to pasta... rich, creamy, flavorful & spicy. Sometimes i use shrimp instead of chicken. My husband doesn't like mushroom, so I usually add broccoli instead of mushroom. Other than that I don't tweak the recipe at all. We love this dish!

Really great recipe.  I don't know how this isn't a popular recipe! Maybe too spicy for some? Well, if you can get over the spice, whip this bad boy up. It's moderately easy to make, not very time consuming, and soooo good.  Besides being made with noodles and heavy cream, I'd say it's healthy ?? I let the sauce thicken a bit and only used one chicken breast, plus 3/4 box of noodles.  I also only used one bell pepper and, woops, no green onions (they had wilted). Oh, and extra seasoning, because this household likes FLAVOR, and lots of it! This recipe is just fabulous.  Easy weeknight dinner with lots of potential for extra veggies and variation.  I've been with my husband for two years and he loves spicy, so I've been getting used to it since we started out.  This probably would have been too much had I not had a drink by my plate!

This is my go to recipe whenever I'm visiting a new mom's house. I hate to come visit people empty handed, so I try to come with food. I bring a tray of the Cajun chicken pasta with a loaf of garlic bread (store bought). Every single person I made this for has asked me for the recipe.

Good, but not quite as flavorful as I imagined.  Therefore, if you're worried about the spiciness, don't be (it isn't too hot).  Easy to make though and something different.  Maybe I'll try it again sometime!

Great recipe, this is a keeper. I doubled all the spices & butter. And used 2cups half & half, green pepper, pack of mushrooms and white onion (instead of red pepper & green onion). It was excellent, creamy, but not heavy and lots of flavour. My husband loved it :)

Wife wanted more, I guess it is as good as rated. I had extra boneless skinless thighs which I used and kept the spices as indicated. I only had a cup of half and half made up the rest with milk. Once it got to the boiling point I added the Parmesan cheese to the mixture which instantly thickened the sauce. Noodles are finished, poured into the sauce pan and topped with the cream. Mixed in and served, it was a hit

This is such a tasty and easy dish. Pioneer Woman, Ree Drummond, also made this on her show, but since it was after this was posted, maybe she got from this site? I pretty much just eye balled everything. I meant to buy a bag of frozen peppers and onions, but came home with Hong Kong frozen mix. It was still excellent! I guess you can put broccoli and water chestnuts and it still turn out great! I used all the seasonings listed, just sprinkled it in the pot. I took advise and used a rotisserie  (whew, thank goodness for spell check on THAT word!) Very happy with this dish!

Very easy to make and turned out amazing! Didn't have green peppers so we used a red/yellow/orange mix and also substituted some 2% milk since we only had a cup of cream but otherwise followed the recipe and it was very tasty.  Definitely a keeper for us!

I absolutely loved the taste of the sauce until I added lemon pepper!  Not sure if I got a bad batch or what, but it ruined the taste for me.  Tried adding fresh lemon to offset the taste, but that curdled the 1/2 and 1/2 that I used.  Oh well, we still ate it as the chicken was delicious.

Excellent tasting recipe but I did have problems getting the sauce to thicken up.   I added a bit of Parmesan cheese during the cooking in an attempt to thicken it a bit.   I think to make this again, I would cut the cream by about a third, or possibly add in a thickening agent, such as corn starch.   The other thing is that when I added in the peppers, I thought that it was entirely too much for the recipe, but as they started to soften, it was the right amount.    Overall, this recipe makes a huge amount of food for two people.   I think it would definitely feed 3, if not 4 people.   I will definitely make this again, perhaps with shrimp next time, but I will do something to thicken the sauce a bit.   Thank you for a winner that any restaurant would be proud to have on their menu.

Came out really bland and super runny...even after trying to thicken with cornstarch.

Excellent pasta dish and I really liked the idea of using frozen peppers and rotisserie chicken.  I was able to whip this up very quickly and it was very good!

Pretty good, you can use different cajun seasonings for a different level of heat. Tasty.

I've made this according to the recipe with small substitutions many times, and it was amazing! My small substitutions include minced garlic for garlic powder, and lemon juice for lemon pepper, and i probably added more spice than called for. However, it is a high calorie dish, and my fiance and I are dieting. So yesterday I decided to substitute shirataki noodles for the pasta, and low fat milk, and light cream, for the cream, as suggested my other reviewers (we don't have half and half where I live), and it turned out amazing!!! Tastes almost like the original with half the calories!! My fiance proclaimed that he never wants to eat pasta again, and only shirataki noodles! (not necessarily because it tastes better than pasta, but almost as good, and without all the carbs!). I entered the ingredients into a calorie counter and got a total of 377 calories per serving, with a serving size of 2 cups. As a side note, I've also made many other pasta/noodle dishes, ranging from Asian to Italian styles with shirataki noodles, and they all turned out great too.

I know this has had tons of reviews but I just had to add my 2 cents even though nobody will probably read it.  I have to say this is incredibility delicious.  I like so many other cooks adjusted the recipe to suit our own tastes but I didn't make to many changes.  I mainly just used the ingredients list not the measurements because I wanted to make more then the recipe made.  We like having leftovers in our house.  I did omit the basil because I don't like it and I used a little parsley in place of the basil.  In sure for those who like basil it would be just as delicious in it.   In a bowl I added Cajun spice to my chicken ( I used 4 boneless chicken breasts) then mixed with my hands until it was evenly distributed adding more Cajun spice until it looked just right to me.  I browned the spiced chicken in about 2 1/2 TBS. of butter.  Once done I drained my chicken saving the juice to use with the cream in my sauce.  I took the advice of another reviewer and once my chicken was done, I then sauted 1 1/2 med. size diced onion, (1/2 tsp. minced garlic from a jar)  and diced red and green bell peppers (about half each) in a little more butter until they were tender but not quite done and then added my sliced fresh mushrooms to them just until the mushrooms were soft but not shriveled and the onions were clear.  I took them out of my skillet and added a pat or two of butter and a little bit of canola oil and made  a roux.  When the roux was slightly tan in color and smooth I adde

Delicious! Like some other reviewers, I made it a little healthier by substituting milk (thickened with 1/4c flour) for the cream. I thought it still tasted rich and creamy despite the lower fat content. I will definitely make this recipe again, and maybe experiment with using shrimp or sausage in place of the chicken.

This was a great base recipe to start with. I added a 3rd chicken breast and also a kielbasa sausage. I marinated the chicken in the Cajun seasoning along with a little Italian dressing and Red Hot sauce. This is a keeper for certain!

Made this for the first time and it easy great! It's quick and there was not a huge clean up! After reading reviews, I cut back on the fat by using 3/4C heavy cream and 3/4 cup half and half. I let it simmer to thicken. Made more pasta to feed a larger crowd. Other than that, I kept everything as is.

Really good recipe. It was easy but it took a bit longer than stated (not a big deal though). I made the recipe as written and I thought the sauce was too runny (next time I'll add cornstarch). I'd like to make my own Cajun seasoning in the future because the brand I had was very salty. I will make this again! :)

It was great. The only changes I would make next time I make this recipe is I will add some heat to it, probable pepper flakes.. I think I would prefer it better with more spice and a tad more lemon pepper. Overall it was a really great recipe.. Definitely a keeper.

Loved this recipe! The main reason I rated it 4 instead of 5 is because I had to follow reviews to get the seasoning and thickness for the sauce. I added about 1/8 c half and half, and did an extra chicken breast  (because one of my roommates can eat a LOT), played with the seasonings until it tasted right (ended up nearly doubling the lemon pepper, and just shook the cajun spices until I got the flavor I wanted), and then added about 2 tbsp corn starch with a bit of milk to thicken the sauce. Turned out spectacular, and even have enough leftovers for one person at lunch tomorrow.

This is a really great recipe. We used old bay seasoning  instead of cajun seasoning. Made it extra spicy.  Good for  colder months. Probably a little too heavy for the summer with all the cream.

My picky eaters enjoyed this recipe.  They would prefer that you leave out all of the vegetables, and I have once.  It was still good.  The sauce is extremely easy to make and I would recommend adding about 1/2 more heavy cream to make more sauce.  In a hurry I have also used the precooked Tyson chicken strips.  Cut the cook time in half.

This was great as is but I like spice so I doubled the Cajun and sprinkled in some cayenne for good measure! It's so yummy:)  I've found after making it a few times I prefer lemon zest and fresh ground pepper instead of lemon pepper, and fresh basil thrown in at the very end instead of dried.

I followed the recipe exactly as directed! 
(Only exception being that I added chicken andouille sausage)..... yum yum/couldn't resist adding more cajun to the cajun pasta! 
AMAZING Recipe! 
I cooked enough to feed 8 people! I ate 2 small portions (lunch & dinner). My husband ate the other 6 portions within in a 12 hr period!!! HAHAHA! 
I made my own Cajun seasoning because I didn't have any on hand (I mixed Cumin, Cayenne, Paprika, Onion powder  & Red Pepper seasonings).
This is my favorite recipe I've ever made using allrecipes.com! 
-btw I don't like spicy foods...
This recipe has a perfect kick of spice without the spiciness over powering the flavor of the veggies. I used fresh sliced baby bellas, fresh green/red/yellow/orange peppers & yellow onions.
The sauce simmering with the meats & veggies for 20 mins on low heat while waiting for the hubby to come home made my house smell like heaven! He knew when he entered our home that he was going to be eating  a decadent meal!
First words out of his mouth, "This house smells delicious!".... lol 
I love that so many fresh veggies are used in this fabulous recipe! I loved the color, presentation, aromas & flavor characteristics of this recipe! This will now become our guilty pleasure meal once a month (everyday if it were up to husband). 
I use to work at J.Alexander's restaurant many yrs ago & since leaving and becoming a nurse I've always missed their Rattlesnake Pasta more than any other pasta meal I've ever had.
*UNTIL NOW!

This is a really good recipe. I was being lazy when I made this, so I didn't go to the store to get everything needed, however I did have all the spices. I didn't have any peppers and I substituted the chicken for shrimp. It taste awesome, my family loved it.  Thank you so much for sharing..

I added about two cups extra fresh parmesan cheese into the sauce mix. It made it more cheesy and a little bit thicker. Great recipe, thanks!

This was so quick & easy and tasty!  We all loved it & will be having it again often. I only had red/orange/yellow bell peppers on hand and I added a tbsp of corn starch to the sauce, as well as a 1/4 cup of Parmesan. Perfect!

This is my husbands favorite meal and I make it as is except using a rotisserie chicken. Love the blend of flavors and the quick easy prep!

This recipe is one of our favorites.  We usually have all of the ingredients on hand, plus it is quick to prepare.  Even a novice cook can make this and have it be oh-so-good.  I have made it with a variety of shellfish and fish when I have not had chicken on hand.  I also cut back on the cream since most of it stayed on the plate which decreased the calories.  For 4 ounces of pasta, I rarely use more than one-half cup of cream for a sauce.

Ive made this tweaking the recipe around 10 times now, with only 1 fail.  Its excellent, easy and fun.  Fair warning I never measure (cook french style) and just use the exact page as a guide. Almost always fantastic regardless. Well done!!

I have made this recipe several times and it is delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except I don't like mushrooms so I left them out.  My only complaint is that the sauce is very thin and goes to the bottom of the plate. It's just as good reheated the next day.  I love this recipe.

This was a great recipe.   I made a small slurry of corn starch to thicken it just a bit, but overall the flavor was really great.  I will make this one again!

As is we really liked it but wanted to love it so we doubled the Cajun spice and added a splash of lemon juice to perk it up.  It also need a little cornstarch to thicken it up and it made all the difference.  It was amazing! Quick and easy and lots of flavour!  Thanks for sharing!

I followed VBHOKIE's advice.  This worked great and we all loved it. I mixed just a bit of the sauce (maybe  1/4 cup) in with the pasta, plated the pasta, then topped it with the sauce/chicken.  I also waited until this point to add fresh grated parm.  Delicious!

I'm not someone who cooks often, but I made this today for the first time and it was absolutely delicious!! I did make changes to some of the recipe. I took advice on another review and used roasted chicken from the deli (I'm sure chicken breast wilI turn out good, but this def cut down on time and tasted great). I still added Cajun seasoning to the chicken (used Tony Cachere's Creole seasoning). I also added chopped smoked sausage. I sauteed the sausage with the peppers before adding the chicken. I was a little concerned about the sauce because some of the reviews said it turned out thin. I used 1 cup of heavy cream and 1/2 of half & half, and sprinkled a tiny bit of flour on top to make sure it thickened and the sauce was perfect! I imagine if you make a lot of changes to the sauce to save on calories you will need to add some flour, etc. to ensure it thickens or let the sauce simmer longer...Unless you absolutely love mushrooms they didn't seem needed in the recipe. I like mushrooms but I ended up pushing them to side when I was eating. Overall, restaurant quality recipe and easy to make!

Loved this. I made many changes: used 1 chicken breast, shrimp and andouille sausage. I also used half and half, and fresh garlic for the sauce. Omitting the butter altogether. It was a bit thin so I thickened with cornstarch. I also sauteed chopped green and red peppers, mushrooms, minced yellow onion and fresh garlic first, then added chicken (seasoned with Cajun seasoning and OldBay) followed by sausage. After adding half and half to the mixture I seasoned well with Cajun seasoning, basil, lemon pepper, black pepper and let cook for about 30 mins then added the shrimp (seasoned in Old Bay and Cajun seasoning) i let everything cook another 15 mins. The peppers onion and garlic all melt into the sauce at this point and the shrimp adds a mild seafood flavor- makes for a rich, flavorful sauce. I used Rotini pasta to hold more sauce and after tasting it, my boyfriend suggested I sell my variation of the recipe to local restaurants-it was THAT good!!!

I left out the mushrooms and used fettuccine.

It was good, but i wanted more spice. I will try it again and add pepper.

Wonderful base for my own twist! I'm living in England, couldn't find Cajun at first glance so picked up Jamaican Jerk instead, and used a lot more of it, used 4 medium chicken breasts, used orange and red bell peppers, red onion on top of the green onion, cooked the meat with some rice wine, and added both some rock sugar and himalayan sea salt!  Loved it! Would do many times more. Oh they also don't have "heavy" cream so I used something called "double" cream in the UK, which appears more natural and thicker than AE heavy cream.

Made this last night and it turned out great. We love our veggies so the only thing I did different was add more peppers, mushrooms, & green onion. We both enjoyed the flavor but will be adding more Cajun Seasoning to kick it up a notch.

One of the best recipes I've made on this website. A lot of people are saying the sauce was too thin but if you just let it simmer for about an hour or so the sauce becomes thick. I highly suggest making this recipe to the T. I used fresh everything and let the sauce simmer for an hour. Enjoy!

I doubled the recipe and added more parm than it said because it was a very runny sauce but good nonetheless. I'll make it again.

This was delicious! We accidentally used 2 tbsp of Cajun seasoning instead of 2 tsp (oops!!) but it still turned out really, really well! The sauce didn't thicken very much, but it still managed to coat the pasta well. The balance between meat, vegetables, and pasta is on point. Not too much or too little of anything. And leftovers reheat better than pretty much any other recipe I've made. I plan to make this a LOT more often.

Pretty good recipe for what it is. I think next time I would add a little more flavour, such as a kick of spice on the chicken, I felt the Cajun didn't do enough. That's just me though. I also had to add some cornstarch because the sauce just wouldn't thicken enough for a sauce. Other than that it was great, I made lots extra for lunches. Thanks for sharing!

Awesome recipe. I made just as posted, just used a little more garlic, Cajun seasoning, and lemon pepper.

I am not a cook, so I have no tweaks or tips. This dish was awesome. I read thru a handful of reviews and chose to follow other and more competent peoples ideas and substitutions. I used the frozen bag of veggies like someone said and it was just fine. Simply awesome, fast and easy.

Super good. I did add more Cajun seasoning and use different noodles, but other than that it was the same.

Oh my goodness, this is simply wonderful. Even my picky daughter loved it. The only thing I did differently was add a little andouille sausage to give a little more Cajun kick. It would be great without it too. This is one of my favorite dishes now. Thank you so much!

This is truly a five star recipe as written! The only change I made was to add more Cajun seasoning to the chicken which ended up too spicy for my husband, but just right for me. However, this is extremely rich and fatty with all that cream, so next time I might use a steamed cauliflower/2% milk puree that I use for Alfredo sauce and just thin it to the ideal consistency, or just use a little cream and a combination of 2% and corn starch as others suggested. This is a very tasty recipe that will be on our regular rotation with some fat-reducing adjustments for my sensitive stomach.

This recipe is one of our favorites!  I've probably made it a half dozen times and its a hit every time.    Add 1/2 - 1 lb of shrimp and 1 tsp of Cayenne pepper to this recipe to give it a little kick and add something to the Chicken.

Changes:  Used chicken thighs, 1 cup condensed milk, couple tablespoons minced garlic and stuffed tortellini.   I was out of lemon pepper, didn't try to substitute.  Otherwise followed directions semi-closely.  Excellent melding of flavors.  If I'd had boneless chicken, even the prep time wouldn't be too bad.  This is a new fave in our house, a definite keeper.

This is my son's favorite recipe.  I've made it a ton of times.  I add a little flour at the end to thicken the sauce up.

Perfect. I used more red peppers and mushrooms and added onion, just my preference. I had to make my own heavy cream, which worked fine 1 cup 2% milk + 3/4 cup melted butter+ 1 tb flour to thicken- worked hust fine, also i have a high soice tolerance so the cajun spice was at least tripled i think. Thanks for the great tecipe!

I'm a 23 year old guy who loves to cook. I've got a ton of Cajun relatives on my moms side of the family, so Cajun cooking is in my blood. My grandma on my mom's side was Cajun and she passed away when I was 4. She had this recipe for crawfish fettuccini that was too die for. As many of you know, crawfish is expensive, so we eventually substituted chicken for the crawfish. Same great dish. I've already made this pasta 3 times now and continue to make it every week. I just fell in love the first time. However, I do have one complaint. Even though I use heavy cream, the sauce is still runny. To combat this, I threw in a tablespoon or two of flour to thicken it. I thought about that because of another Cajun dish I make called etouffee that uses flour to thicken the sauce. Now only if I had some boudin balls to go with this!

"Bayou" chicken pasta was my absolute favorite dish in college. To be able to find this recipe and make it in my own home warms my soul. The Cajun mix I used was posted here by Bobbie Buckley Dirks.

Very good, for my taste it needed a dash more salt and there wasn't enough pasta for the amount of sauce it made. But flavour is great

I made this last night. I doubled the recipe and I floured  the chicken before cooking it. Also I added a little more Cajun seasoning than called for.  All in all it turned out great. I will definitely be making this again.

My family loves this recipe!  I just pulled out my old print copy and found that I'd misplaced one of the pages so I came here to get the full recipe.  My old print copy was printed in 2001!  We've been making it all these years and love it.  We don't change anything which is unusual for us as we usually modify recipes quite a bit.  We also use the same recipe but use shrimp instead of chicken which is fantastic.

This recipe was fabulous! I did use half and half and a bit of flour, but I know it would have been even better with full cream. I adjusted the seasoning to our tastes, we like spicy so I added probably a teaspoon or more of Cajun Seasoning (used a recipe for that from allrecipes for that). I also added just a bit more pasta and we managed to get two dinners for the two of us out of it. Can't wait to make it again!

This recipe was SO DELICIOUS!! I put a lot more garlic (and used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder) and I used a more cajon seasoning because I love the spice. I did find the sauce a little liquidy so I left it at medium heat for a few minutes and then let it simmer. Overall, amazing dish and I will certainly be making it again.

Really enjoyed this. I used a local Cajun seasoning. Added an additional tsp. also used one full red and one full green bell pepper. Used 4 oz mushrooms, baby Bella's. I'll add the whole container (8 oz) next time. Used a twisty pasta (don't recall name). Used extra parm in the sauce with additional on top. Very yummy!

Definitely need to thicken the sauce.  I used cornstarch.  Next time I'll add cheese to the sauce as well.  Ff 1/2 n 1/2 worked fine and cut down on the guilt factor.  I grilled my chicken before adding to the sauce at the end.  A little char added a nice dimension.  I'll def do this again.

My guys loved it! I changed it up a bit based on reviews and personal preferences.  3 T of Cajun seasoning, 4 large chicken breasts, one orange bell pepper, more green onions and double the garlic.  Since I needed to hold it a while before serving, I took the chicken out of the skillet after sautéing and put it back in to warm in the last few minutes. I also made a roux to thicken it a bit.  Delicious!

I'm known for following recipes as written and still messing them up??. I tried this and I must say,  it's absolutely delicious. My boyfriend raved about it. Being from the Caribbean I was able to have every ingredient freshly picked.  I used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder and I added a bit of onion. I'll be making this again!!!! Thanks.

I made this last night, it was good but maybe just a tad rich & salty for our taste but I think we will make it again with modifications (perhaps my Cajun seasoning had salt in it too).
I used 1 full 450g (1lb) pack of fettuccine & approx. doubled everything else (except for the cream)...I used 1 medium (483ml) carton of half&half, mixing in about 1.5 tsp of cornstarch before adding it to the pan.
I also used a rotisserie chicken, 1 8oz pkg of crimini mushrooms, 1 red pepper, 1 yellow pepper (only because we find that the flavor of green pepper really dominates a dish & we don't like the flavor of it).
All in all it was a tasty dish

Instead of heavy cream (heavy cream is upseting to the husbands tummy), I sort of invented my own by combining milk, butter and little flour... It turned out great! My husband was born in the south and loves anything with cajun spices, so this was a pretty big hit with us!

Love this pasta! It is definitely a spicy dish which is good with me. The only thing I don't add is the mushroom just because I'm not a mushroom person and neither is my husband. But other than that I follow the complete recipe and its flavorful every time!

My husband is lactose intolerant so I made some adjustments for that and for ingredients that I had on hand.  I used lactaid milk instead of heavy cream.  To help make it thicker because of the milk I added somewhere between 3 and 4 teaspoons of cornstarch.  I also added fresh lemon juice and fresh parsley because I had it and it sounded like a good addition.  I used 3/4 of a one pound box of pasta, like a different reviewer recommended, and next time I will use the full pound just because I am more of a pasta girl than a meat eater.  Great tasting, easy to make, and easy to adjust to your liking!

Basically loved it--but hadn't got half the ingredients, but I'm still willing to rate on the basis of what happened. Had no mushrooms, had no peppers--DID however have greens to substitute. Didn't have linguine, used noodles. Anyway: no complaints, had I got some shrimp/white wine might have been even better. Still great as it was.

This was absolutely delicious! The amount of spice was perfect - who wants mouth scorching pasta anyway? The only changes made was I used a bit more pasta than called for and, since I prefer a thicker sauce, I allowed the sauce to simmer for a bit longer to thicken up. Next time I'll be sure to add more mushrooms as well. Other than that, this recipe is definitely a winner. The family loved it!

This was amazing! A definite staple in our home! I added more noodles! I'm a wimp and it was the perfect amount of spice! Kind of reminded me of tetrazzini but way better and with a kick! I also added a little more parm-can never have too much cheese!

Sauce was a little much, even with adding extra pasta. Had to add double the cajun seasoning for my taste preference, because the sauce was just a little under seasoned.

This was very good. I used milk instead of cream and it didn't lose anything but a few calories. We will definitely be making this again.

This was a great recipe! Me and my girlfriend loved it! Used shrimp instead of chicken though 1 pond seemed a bit overkill and used a cup of heavy cream. After it simmers a bit leave it on the stove for a few min  and it will thicken up nicely .

Good, not great.

The only minor alterations I made were using minced garlic instead of garlic powder (based on other reviews), and adding some flour to the sauce to thicken it. My husband and I enjoyed it, but we both felt it was lacking some flavor. It just doesn't have quite enough spice for us. Not even in the "spicy" sense, just not enough flavor in general. 

But it's not too hard, doesn't take overly long to cook, and tastes decent, so I'll be saving the recipe for another time. Just experimenting with the spices.

Need to play around with it more.  I agree with others it very high in calories - therefore using half&half or something else would be suggested.  I did add 1 large jalapeno sliced up - gave it a good heat kick.  will make a again.

I didn't change this much.  2 onions instead of 1; 1/2 pound of sliced mushrooms; 2 pods fresh garlic instead of garlic  powder - sauteed with chicken; 1/8 C. white wine added to the sauce; a couple shakes of italian seasoning; a bit extra salt; twice the pasta; I thickened the sauce with a little flour mixed with water then  I just spooned the sauce over the pasta  - I didn't not mix it together. It was very good.  I would make it again.  There still seems to be something missing.  I think next time I may cut some cherry tomatoes in half and add them at the end, heating just enought to warm through.

It was fantastic! One change I made though. I had no Cajun seasoning so I used fajita seasoning instead and it tasted fantastic. Don't add the salt if you do this though because I'm sure it would be too salty.

Delicious!! Like being at a restaurant, but without going out. I used 1/2 and 1/2 because that's what I had and it was fabulous. Hubby loved it too. One of our favorite recipes from this site.

Tried this recipe and it tasted so good! I did use recipe ready frozen vegetables and 1 jar of Alfredo Sauce to make it easier. It also tasted spicier by adding 3T of Cajun seasoning, but this recipe is a keeper!

Makes a delicious meal. I use fresh garlic instead of powdered, and only one bell pepper, but otherwise leave it as-is. The leftovers are fantastic if you have any!

I loved the recipe and so did my husband 
I used bow tie pasta instead and have played with other proteins as sausage and shrimp and all are loved 
Also my husband loves heat so I added a little but of Cajun spice to it to really give it some flavor and he doesn't like mushrooms so I omi those 
But great recipe thanks !!!!!

My husband said he wished it would never be gone! It was delicious. I, too, added way more cajun seasoning. Next time I will put a few teaspoons of flour in with more butter after  cooking chicken and veggies to thicken it up. That was the only thing that was not perfect. I cannot wait to make it again!

I've made this recipe several times and everyone always raves about it. I use penne pasta instead and add diced tomatoes every now and then. I also love to use different color bell peppers just to make it look even more pleasing. Served with garlic bread. delicious

Excellent!  I made a few changes... I used shrimp, added baby bella mushrooms,  1/2 & 1/2 as well as heavy cream, and a little more parmesan cheese. Tasted just like my favorite dish at Red Lobster. .. that's no longer offered!! I will be making this again, perhaps next time omitting red and green peppers and trying fresh spinach just to change it up.

Great recipe!  My husband and I loved it. I didn't use the peppers (not a fan of peppers) and I used canned mushrooms.  Everything was great! I will be making this again!!!

Great recipe! Easy and not a ton of ingredients. I also, as suggested, added more Cajun spice & would like to add shrimp next time.. Will be making again soon!

I LOVE this dish, very simple and delicious! The only thing that I did not like was how watery it was. I saw some people put cornstarch in it to thiken it up...how much should I put in if i doubled the recipe???  thanks!

Ok, (disappointed) I just made this and it tasted bland and only like green peppers to me. Next time I'll add about 1/3 a green pepper and replace with more mushrooms. I'll also add twice as much Cajan spice.
A little wine would have been brilliant too.

I made this tonight for the first time. I loved it, however, I did tweak it to eliminate some of the fat content. I used olive oil instead of better and fat free half and half instead of cream. I used a small amount of cornstarch to thicken it at the end. I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because it just wasn't as spicy as I was hoping for. At the table I added extra Cajun seasoning to my own plate and it was much better. (Of course, that is a personal preference.) I will definitely make this again!

As written we did not enjoy this, it was extremely bland.  I upped the veggies, thickened the sauce, upped the seasonings, and in the end had a decent meal.

It was exactly what my husband was asking for, so that's a win! Have made it twice now, second time we used fresh garlic and we both liked it soooo much more. Next I want to try it with shrimp because I thought the chicken seemed a bit flat with all of the other flavors.

Fantastic and everyone loved it.  We used some Tony Chachere's creole seasoning instead of the Cajun seasoning it called for and loved it.

Wow very easy dish and better than any previous Cajun recipes I have tried. The only thing I would tweak is adding more of the seasoning and adding a little bit of flour to the sauce and then setting it to a low flame so that it thickens.

This recipe is so delicious! My 7 and 9 year old loves it,even though its too spicy for them. I did not change a thing, but I'm pretty sure it would be great putting different veggies or even sausage in it.

My wife and I truly enjoyed this pasta dish. It's a nice change from tomato based pasta dishes. We followed the recipe and found the dish a little on the salty side. Next time we'll cut back on the salt but otherwise the recipe is a keeper.

I liked most of the ingredients but I personally found it a bit bland. My remedy was to add brandy to the cream and it was much better. This is a great way to use up the left over rotisserie chicken.

This was AWESOME! Had to remove the extra from the table. My substitutes....farfallea noodles, no lemon pepper just extra pepper. Was runny but I like moist pasta so didn't bother us. It really is a great dish. Just spiced perfectly.

Super disappointed in this one based on all the rave reviews. The proportions seemed wrong from the beginning. 4 oz pasta for 1.5 cups cream? I increased the pasta to 8oz, cut down on the peppers and chicken. Also, reading the recipe I didn't even think of the fact that the sauce doesn't call for thickening agent. I realized as soon as I put the cream in, that it was going to be too thin. I added some flour to thicken just a bit at least. The taste in the end was good but not great. Will not make again. Seems like all the rave reviews on this one are people who changed this quite a bit.

We loved this recipe. I read the other reviews and made a couple of changes. I used a garlic oil and Creole seasoning blend to marinate the chicken in first. Then I cooked the chicken in a Sicilian oil/ butter mixture.   I omitted the mushrooms but doubled the peppers and used an even amount of half-half cream and heavy cream. .  I added a couple pinches of fresh lemon zest to the sauce  while cooking. Once plated I sprinkled fresh diced tomatoes, shredded cheddar cheese, and chives  on top. This was so good!

Used half heavy cream and the other half 1/2 and 1/2 to cut down on fat.  Added broccoli for veggies.  Increased Cajun as other's suggested.  Made it with shrimp instead of chicken.  Used about 3 tsp corn starch with some milk to help thicken the sauce.  Very yummy!

I love this recipe!! Me and my boyfriend make it all the time. The mushrooms aren't necessary, but I do think it's delicious if you add a can of corn, and hot sauce.

I really like this recipe. I didn't use red pepper or onions, mainly because I forgot them when I went to the store I just used broccoli. But the sauce was awesome.

This recipe is GREAT!

My only minor changes were to use farfalle and I added andouille sausage. It's rare that I don't completely change a recipe here, but this one was simply delicious as written.

Very tasty. I used sour cream instead of heavy cream and only 1tsp of butter instead of 2. The sour cream made the sauce too heavy so next time I'll use heavy cream!

Wow this has to be my favorite pasta dish I've made. It wouldn't even be good without the chicken as a vegetarian meal. I didn't want it to be bland so I pretty much doubled the cajun seasoning and basil. As far as others saying it was too soupy I let mine Cook down after adding the cream for about 5 to 10 minutes and it turned out perfect.

Absolutely love this recipe! Only thing I changed to resolve the thin sauce was to add a lot more Parmesan cheese (like a cup), and OMG! Forget the flour or corn starch! yuck! Add more Parmesan cheese and it's more like an Alfredo sauce, and with the Cajun seasoning...umm umm yummy!!

This is a staple in my house.  I will say that I add broccoli and shrimp to the dish.  I boil the broccoli with the pasta and cook the shrimp separately and add at the end of the dish just to heat it through.  I like using bow tie or Campanella pasta.

LOVE this recipe. The spices make it very flavorful. I used more to suit our tastes (1 1/2 TBSP of cajun seasoning, about 1 tsp of lemon pepper, 1 tsp of garlic powder, and 1/2 tsp black pepper). I used about 1.75 lbs of chicken breast thinly sliced; I didn't use any extra salt; I used about 2 cups of fresh chopped broccoli instead of mushrooms (only because my kids don't like mushrooms and they love broccoli); I sauteed the veggies in a little white wine with the garlic powder, lemon pepper, and black pepper in the same pan after cooking the chicken, then added the chicken back into the pan, and then added the cream; I used 2 cups of heavy whipping cream and added a few more shakes of each of the seasonings (including the cajun) to the whipping cream, chicken, and veggies; I added about 1/4 cup of grated Parmesan to it all and continued cooking it; I added 2 heaping tablespoons of flour to help thicken it all at the end. My kids LOVED it. I will make this again. It's pretty quick to make and super delicious. It's full of flavor, and uses fresh ingredients, which I love. Thank you!!

This is a GREAT recipe! Easy prep, easy cook, and fast enough to make on the fly. We added  a 1/2 lb of shrimp. We plan on trying it with sausage next time. It disappeared too quickly for me to get a picture.

I changed a few things! I used oil & light sour cream instead of butter & heavy cream to lower the calories. I also used blackening seasoning on the chicken, grilled it then added it after sautéing the veggies and adding the sauce. It was quite possibly the best pasta I've ever made!! Oh I also kept a cup of water from boiling the pasta to add to sauce to help it stick to pasta and I added some corn starch to thicken it

Made this tonight, it was really good. We did some alterations such as adding a tablespoon of fresh chopped parsley, some chopped broccoli, and a little bit more Cajun. Definitely will be making it again. So good.

This is a close clone to a dish served at Redfish. Just add black beans and swap the Parm cheese for Asiago and you have it. I like to add smoked sausage and shrimp as well. Never enough protein.

I added more vegetables and did the corn starch add like the reviews suggested. I also decreased a bit of cream.
Second time around: Didn't add cornstarch and it was still great.

Tasted wonderful. Also didn't have any problem using just over a cup of half and half and a little cornstarch instead of heavy cream.

First time I made this my husband said "this is the best pasta you've ever made!" It was a hit. I did modify a couple things, based on other reviews. I used half and half instead of heavy cream and yes it is more watery, you just need to add a couple tablespoons corn starch and let simmer. It reduces to the perfect creamy consistency (just give it a little time!). I also don't like green bell peppers (I used yellow & orange bell peppers) so I added some spinach and it was a perfect addition. I think you could really add any vegetables if you want. I also used chicken thighs and they were great. And someone suggested adding Cajun seasoning (in addition to what you coat the chicken in before cooking) while you're cooking and that was a great suggestion! Because then you can make it as spicy as you want. I think I only added about 1 additional tablespoon hole cooking. All in all, a family fav!! Def looking forward to making this a lot more!

Made this and it was so delicious! My boyfriend had the idea of using fish instead of chicken, I might try that next! Super yummy and quick recipe. Love it!

Very good recipe.  I made some adjustments to reduce fat.  Used chicken broth rather than cream and thickened it with some flour. Very moist. Hickey breast.  Great flavor.

Very, very good- took the suggestion of another reviewer and used frozen peppers and onion. I also used 1 tablespoon of the cajun spice. Can't stand thin sauces so made it nice and thick. 
Hubby loved it and can't wait for me to make it again

I really liked this recipe. It turned out to be really good. It didn't look like the picture but it was still good. The only thing we changed was the mushrooms. No one in our group liked them. The only thing I would change is the amount of salt. I felt like it needed more.

I thought this was a great recipe but i did have a few issues, the sauce seemed like it should have had cheese added(which is what i did) and also the amount of peppers seemed like a bit much. but overall it was a great recipe.

The chicken came out very well, and it was very easy to follow.  I added a bit of salt to the pasta because it was a little bit bland, and some cheese to thicken the sauce.  If I were to make this recipe again, I would put a lid on the sauce to help it thicken.  I would definitely recommend this recipe to a friend.

It was fine and I'll make it again. I usually try to follow a recipe as written the first time I try it and make adjustments the next time around. Suggested changes: add more Cajun seasoning, more pasta and cook down the cream sauce to thicken it. Might also try it without peppers, using frozen peas instead.

Delicious!  I made this exactly as the recipe is written, but I omitted the mushrooms (me and my kids don't like them).  My husband isn't a big pasta guy...he said it was the BEST pasta dish I've ever made!  I've been making a lot of new recipes the past couple of months, between Allrecipes.com and different cooking magazines, and this was his favorite!  He raved about it to his mom and sister, and they want the recipe.  THANK YOU!!!

This was delicious and a good way to change-up chicken breast (our least favorite part of the chicken).  I only made small changes due to what I had on hand...I used yellow peppers and added a few broccoli flowerets.  Also, I didn't have any cream so I used milk and added some flour to thicken it a little and some butter to help smooth it out and give it back some richness.  I'll be making this again soon!  Thanks, Tammy, for a very good recipe!!

This was really, really good and very easy to make.  The only thing I changed was added some crushed red peppers to kick it up a notch but it didn't need it--hubby and I just like the added heat.  Thank you for sharing, it's going into my menu!

A good starter recipe but if you are gonna label something "Cajun" let it be that. This needs more Cajun seasoning. I sautéed the chicken, shrimp, and veggies separately with fresh garlic and additional Cajun seasoning. I deglazed pan with some white wine. Added the cream and some milk whisking constantly. Then I added about a cup of freshly grated Parmesan cheese. It turned out to be a creamy garlic white wine sauce. After I was pleased with my cream sauce I added the sautéed shrimp, chicken and veggies. You don't need the lemon pepper seasoning or garlic powder. Fresh is always best... Period!

My wife and I thought this was bland.  Not much spice to it until I added more Cajun spice and red pepper flakes. That added the heat needed.

Great tasting recipe and easy to make.  I did cook the  cream down until the thickness met our preference.  Other than that I stayed true to the recipe.  Will definitely add this one to my list of repeats.

This was delicious!!! It did taste just like the Cajun chicken pasta from the Cheesecake Factory! My boys loved it!  I didn't use mushrooms because  I don't really like them. I used an entire box (16oz) of linguine and doubled the sauce and the proportion was perfect so I'm confused about only using 4 ounces of linguine.  I followed everyone's advice and doubled the Cajun seasoning and really just seasoned to taste. I was worried about the sauce being a little thin so I just let it simmer and cook a while. Once I put it on the pasta and let it sit it was fine.  Will make again and add some shrimp!

Needs more spice, but it's a good base recipe.

This was very tasty.  I used a pound of pasta and 4 large chicken breasts.  I tripled all of the seasonings, but found that I didn't need near the amount of cream (I used half and half) as would be needed for 4x the pasta.  For my one pound of pasta and triple seasonings, I found 2 cups of half and half to be perfect, though I accidentally seasoned the vegetables and chicken before adding the cream instead of after. UPDATE: I tossed in some spinach… YUMMM!!

This is a fantastic recipe! As as per other comments, I doubled the Cajun spice and it turned out wonderful. I also deglaze the pan with Chardonnay after the chicken was cooked and prior to adding the vegetables. I also added 12 strawberry tomatoes (halved), giving a nice colour to the dish (I did not use a lot of the bell peppers).  Will make on a regular basis!  I'm looking forward to tonight's leftovers!!!

Okay, so here's my take on this recipe. Being recently diagnosed with diabetes, I've been working on lowering calories and fat. So, what I did was to substitute a tofu-soy milk blend for the heavy cream (I've also discovered I'm lactose intolerant, as well), and used olive oil instead of butter. These two substitutions dropped the calories and fat by more than half! You would never know it was soy, either.

The seasonings are awesome, and the flavor just explodes in your mouth. I will definitely be making this again!

I had only red, yellow and orange peppers so I used one red and one yellow, skipped the mushrooms (my daughter don't you know) and everyone loved it!  I used a whole package of spaghetti noodles and have 2 1/2 leftover portions after feeding a family of four.

This is a yummy recipe.  I substituted 1% milk mixed with some light sour cream for the heavy cream, and let it cook down.  It was a great way to cut down on the fat and calories.

This was ok.  Cooked it with out the peppers & mushrooms because don't like those but maybe with sun dried tomatoes ...something.  Used 2 Tbs of Cajun seasoning & that was too much but 2 tsp would have been not enough.  Will make it again but add a bit of something.

This dish was delicious! I didn't have lemon pepper, and added a bit more cajun seasoning...but it turned out excellent! Will definitely be a regular in our household! Next time I am going to add broccoli.

Very delicious and creamy. To reduce fat I did use half cream and half 1/2 & 1/2. I bought chicken tenderloins and cut in to bite size pieces before coating in seasoning. Easier for the kids to eat. It was spicy, but my boys like spice. They polished it off.

Yup, it's good. Everyone liked it. My changes: sautéed fresh garlic in butter for a minute before adding chicken. I did not add extra salt; I salt the pasta water and the parmesan can be salty.  I did not have any lemon pepper and I prefer to not add pre-blended spices (they don't agree with me) but I did use the cajun seasoning as suggested (Bulk Barn). I added the juice of 1/2 lemon right at the end when I was placing it all in the bowl.  Delicious and will make it again. Thanks.

Made it in a pinch last night when the girlfriend showed up with short notice, we both absolutely loved it. Only thing I would suggest is to marinate the chicken a couple hours in advance. Aside from that, I might use a less beastly cream in the future to reduce the fat/calories. Really good!

Made this last night and it was great i didn't have any linguine noodles so i used a rotini noodle instead. I found a cajun seasoning receipe on this site as well as i didn't have any. Will make again. I also didn't have any half and half or evaporated milk so i substituted with 2% milk and thickened it with corn starch. Oh and i didn't put any mushrooms in it as i don't like them and used yellow onion instead of green onion as i didn't have any

My family and I really enjoyed this dish!  It was very easy to make because most of the ingredients I had on hand.  However, the noddles had to be substitued for spaghetti but that didn't affect the great taste. I will definitely make this again soon.

I made this for a dinner party I had to multiply the serving size to 10 and it got rave reviews. It was surprisingly simple to make. I will definitely make this again next time I think I will add shrimp.

Fantastic. Been asked to make it multiple times it was so good. I suggest adding more Cajun seasoning and using a few less mushrooms. Regardless it is delicious.

Love this and make it all the time.  Omit the salt, with the Cajun seasoning you don't need any extra salt. I make this with chicken or shrimp- both are great! I also use regular milk and thicken with corn starch. One of my husband's favorite meals!

Oh my goodness. This is absolutely the best recipee on this website!! I have tried many recipes, but this one is amazing. It is very flavorful (although I added 1/4 tsp of cajun seasoning to the mix with creamer). I also gradually added in Parmasean cheese with the boiling cream/veg/chix mixture. Another way I differed from the recipe was I doubled the noodles (it was a good proportion with the extra noodles) and added all ingredients in the extra large skillet (noodles included) and boiled an additional 2 minutes. This recipe is a favorite of mine now and the "two" servings was enough to feed my family of six (3 adults and 3 kids). Thank you so very much for posting this Tammy.

This was pretty good, and came together really quickly. Perfect for a busy night. My only complaint was that the sauce was a little thin - I think next time I'll either thicken it with some flour or cornstarch, or cut down on the cream a little.

Delicious!!  Even my picky 3 year old said it was yummy.  I did skip the veggies since my family doesn't care for mushrooms and bell peppers (served broccoli on the side instead)  But the Cajun chicken in cream sauce over pasta was GREAT.  Restaurant-quality.  I would love this with shrimp, too, I think.  For making more often, I'd try some of the lower-fat or fat-free alternatives, but as is the recipe is really well-flavored.  The sauce was nice and thick, just the right consistency.

Fabulous! Made this tonight and couldn't be happier! I didn't have all the ingredients, but this lends itself so well to improvisation! I used grape tomatoes instead of peppers, leek instead of green onion... you get the idea.Sauce was perfect, no cornstarch required. Beware though - this took way longer than indicated both to prepare and to cook, so leave yourself some extra time. Definitely a make-again!

Really good!  I found this quite salty when I used Tony Cachere's seasoning so next time I will cut out the extra salt.  Also, my hubs doesn't like heavy cream flavor, so I used 1/2 & 1/2 which worked just as well.  I served mine over spaghetti squash, which was wonderful.  Easy to make.  Will definitely make this again.

I more or less followed this recipe to a T (omitted the lemon pepper... because I strongly dislike the stuff!) and my notoriously picky husband said that it was the best thing that I have ever made.

Really, really good flavour and SUPER easy to make. Will absolutely be making again!

My fiance ate this up!  I substituted half & half as well for the heavy cream and added a couple cloves of chopped garlic instead of garlic powder.  The sauce was very thin although I let it simmer for about 30 minutes.  Next time I will add some corn starch.  I also added some red pepper flakes because it was not spicy enough for us!  I love the idea of using shrimp in this as well.  Thanks for the submission!

I followed the recipe exactly and I must say, it was very very good! My husband loved it!! This dish had lots of flavor and just the right amount of spice.  I was afraid it would be too spicy.  I read the other reviews regarding how thin the sauce was so I let the sauce simmer a little longer; however, it did not thicken up that much.  After trying this dish, I really don't believe the sauce is meant to be a thick, alfredo type sauce.  I liked it just the way it was.

This was awesome!! A couple of changes I made though. We used left over roasted chicken from the night before, so I removed from bone, chopped into bite sized pieces and tossed it in the cajun seasoning. I also chopped up a quarter of an onion and sauted in butter first and then added the coated chicken. Added the other seasonings and then the cream. I left the fresh veggies for last as we don't like our peppers over cooked. Once everything was combined, I added the chopped green onion to use to as a garnish as those are better less cooked as well. We will for sure be having this again!!

This recipe is great! I used fettuccine noddles, canned mushrooms and frozen bell peppers instead, and it turned out yummy. I'm always adamant about trying new recipes because I'm usually disappointed. However, I'm happy I tried this one and so is my Husband. Definitely making this again!

Outstanding recipe (or at least a good starter). I used a bit of Corn Starch slurry (2 tbls CS & 1/2 cup water) to thicken up the sauce a bit but other than that didn't do a whole lot else to it. I wanted to see how it was before making too many changes and we absolutely loved it so other than maybe using shrimp instead of chicken I'll leave it alone. Great recipe, thanks!

I loved this recipe. Spicy, but not too spicy! The only change I made was, instead of using heavy cream I used Cream of Chicken. My local grocery store was all out of heavy cream, so I had to improvise! I definitely would recommend this dish!

This recipe was a great starting point.  The 4 oz of linguine it called for was NOT enough, I used half a package.  I also added 1/4 cup of white wine and a pinch of red pepper flakes because it needed something extra, it was just a little to bland for my tastes without it.  If you like a full flavor like I do, double the Cajun seasoning and simmer the sauce as long as you need to to reach the desired consistency.  Delicious!

AMAZING recipe!!!  Made some adjustments after reading other reviews, such as adding shrimp and used a rotisserie chicken from the deli, also pre-sliced  peppers and  onions along with sliced mini bellas from produce section to save time . As for the seasonings, you definitely need to increase according to personal taste. I also used minced garlic instead of powder. Needless to say the family LOVED it, including a picky eater! This will be going in the favorite category for sure....nom nom nom =)

Quick to make, had extra left-over.  Ate it with rice, ate it with noodles, and also had it with toast.  Very straight-forward to make, didn't take a lot of work, I enjoyed it quite a bit!

This was awesome.  Just made it, and my friend and I loved it so much that I knew I needed to review it right away.  It's a simple 2 pan dish (pot and pan) that takes less than 30 minutes.  The cajun gives it a kick of spice that isn't overpowering.  I substituted half and half for the heavy whipping cream and achieved great results.  I tried to figure out how to make the sauce thicker, and as per many suggestions made a "roux" but rather than make a whole new sauce (for the roux) i just added flour to the half and half when i poured it over the chicken and vegis, making sure to stir out the lumps of flour.  I was nervous that it would not work out well, but it did! So easy, and versatile, this sauce would be awesome with sausage and peppers. If you are unsure, make it. You'll be happy you did.

LOVE IT, LOVE It, love it!!  This recipe was amazing!!!!!  I did not use a red pepper or mushrooms (didn't have any).  I think the veggies can be a variable based on what you have and what you like.  Anyway, the end result was better than something you'd order in a restaurant!  I did add more cajun seasoning because I like my food spicy.  The second time I made this I used half and half instead of the heavy cream to cut back on the fat content and you couldn't tell the difference.  I think this was just wonderful and it will definitely be in my regular rotation.

Wow, wow, wow!  We LOVE this recipe!  My toddler and preschooler even eat the vegetables!  The flavor is great and it's so easy to make and adjust to taste.  I use 1/2 the cream and 1/2 lowfat milk and reduce the butter a little to reduce the fat a little.  I also add some asparagus cut in 1-inch pieces.

This is really good! But the sauce was very thin, so I added a touch of cold water mixed with cornstarch. Made all the difference.

This recipe was easy to make and turned out great. My final product didn't come out like the default picture did because mines had more sauce to it. I used less green and red peppers and mushrooms, but I would like to add more chicken to the recipe. I used half whole wheat noodles and half regular noodles just to experiment the diffidence, and I don't think there was a difference at all, just added a little bit of healthyness in the recipe. I would definitely recommend this recipe to someone else because it taste good, easy to follow and didn't take long to make.

The recipe was pretty easy to understand, and it also easy to follow. Our product was turned out to be awesome. If we make the recipe again, I would make it has more sauce and add more chicken to our dish, beside bigger cut for our chicken strips.

I used frozen peppers and onions, as suggested.  I didn't have lemon pepper seasoning, and I don't think I was missing anything either.  I nearly doubled the cajun (we like it spicy), and apparently I didn't read the directions very well because I added ALL the seasonings to the chicken before I cooked it up, but it still came out amazing.

This is a really good recipe!!  We thinly sliced the green and red pepper into strips instead of chunks and after slicing the chicken we coated each piece with cajun seasoning (using WAY more than the recipe suggests, but we like more flavor and that gave it a ton!).  Definitely a keeper in our house, thanks!

THis is really a great recipe.  I had to make my own heavy cream because we don't keep it on hand, and also I used smaller yellow and red peppers since we were out of bell peppers.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a T.  I have a family of 3 semi picky eaters and they gobbled it down like it was their first meal in a week.

I really like everything in this.  I added a bit more cajun spice but we are kinda "zingy" here.  I may try thickening it next time, or not as its really decent as is. Thanks Tammy

This is awesome! We double (at least) all of the spices. Use half butter half olive oil to saute chicken. Frozen precut mixed peppers and onions (also in replace of the green onions) YUM! My husband and kids (5 and 1) LOVE this dish. Great leftovers for work lunches to make everyone jealous!

My husband and I LOVE this recipe!  I've served it to my parents and they do, too.  I use at least 12 ounces of pasta (all kinds work; I like it with farfalle).  Also, I use half-and-half instead of heavy cream and let it boil for a bit to thicken.  It's SO delicious and pretty easy, too! I used "Creole Seasoning Blend" from this site.  The flavor really depends on the cajun seasoning you use!  Also, I cooked the chicken in coconut oil instead of butter.  You can add or leave out any of the veggies depending on what you like.

DO NOT ADD SALT! We use the Weber N'Orleans Cajun seasoning, it's our favorite. I  love this its just like the cajun pasta dish you get in the restaurants if you help it, we prefer it with shrimp but love with the chicken as well. I followed others recommendations the second time around and found it perfect: whole box of linguine, additional seasoning unless you don't like the heat, 1 whole green bell pepper, 1 whole sweet red bell, 1 yellow, and one orange all diced tiny with the green onion. Makes a beautiful color and needed added veggies(our local store sells bags of tiny mixed sweet peppers and sometimes they are perfect. Then I add a whole 16 oz carton of baby bellas. I also just buy the small carton of cream and use the whole thing. If your sauce seems thin just add more parmesan or ramano cheese to it. Stirring it into the sauce and cooking it works better than sprinkling it on top. My whole family asks for it every week now. Also, Cajun seasoning is salty itself, additional salt is unnecessary. First time I made this it was so ridiculously salty what with the salt in cajun seasoning and lemon pepper then to add salt was just too much or I would have given it a 5 star as is review. With our version we would give it 10 stars!

Absolutely delicious.  I used Emeril's Essence for the cajun spices.  Also, I lightened the recipe a little by using 3/4 cup half and half and 3/4 chicken broth.  I thickened it a little by adding a TBSP or so of cornstarch to the chicken mixture right before adding the half and half.  Served over spaghetti because I didn't have linguine - worked great.

I made some significant changes because I'm on a diet, so keep that in mind. I substituted the linguine with shirataki (aka "miracle") noodles, and I grilled the chicken on my Foreman grill before cutting it into smaller pieces. I also made a roux with milk and the cheese, although I'm not sure if I saved many calories by doing it that way. I also used a whole red pepper and half a bundle of green onion, which seemed to be the right ratio of ingredients.

Overall, this approximately cut the calories in half for this recipe (I guesstimated it at 500 to 550 kcal). On top of that, both my bf and my friend that was over for dinner really loved it (as did I). I think it's important to mention that it requires a quality Cajun seasoning to be an excellent dish...we just happened to pick some up last time we were in New Orleans.

I loved this recipe.   I used greek yogurt instead of cream, frozen peppers, and then used extra cajun and a small dash of cayenne.   If using greek yogurt, make sure you add it close enough to end so that it does not curdle in the heat.

I made the recipe as directed, except lightened it up by using a mixture of skim milk and half and half, instead of the cream. Added a tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken a bit. Was so good! My husband loved it, and I will me making this again.

Delicious. Made as recipe directed, but left out the mushrooms due to one hater in the family. Doubled recipe. Will be making this regularly. Restaurant quality flavor. Sauce thickened upon mixing with pasta and setting for a couple minutes while finishing setting table, etc.  Thank you Tammy for sharing this recipe!  Might be delicious with shrimp and krab instead of chicken.

This was our first time preparing this recipe. We dine out frequently and Cajun Chicken Pasta is one of our go-to meals at the local restaraunt. The recipe turned out fabulous with just enough spice. The only thing I plan to change next time is to toss 1/2 the chicken and sauce with the pasta and save the other 1/2 to place on top of the dish. Great recipe. Thanks for sharing.

Wow. Great recipe that is also very versatile! I didn't have cajun seasoning, but found this "Simple Cajun Seasoning" on the Allrecipes site:

    2 1/2 tablespoons salt, 1 tablespoon dried oregano, 1 tablespoon paprika,1 tablespoon cayenne pepper, 1 tablespoon ground black pepper.
    Combine the salt, oregano, paprika, cayenne pepper, and black pepper in a plastic bag and shake to mix.

(I'm not a big cajun fan, so I omitted the cayenne pepper and it makes a FANTASTIC all-purpose seasoning! Doubled it to keep handy for other uses.)

Also, I've made a few healthy changes to this pasta dish: fat-free half and half thickened with cornstarch, any vegetable handy~ tonight I used broccoli, tomatoes and red bell peppers. The more veggies the merrier! Instead of butter, using olive oil, or even coconut oil makes a healthy and yummy alternative! Skip the parmesan cheese...the seasoning is plenty tasty by itself!

Very good. I dropped it down to one pepper, added one zucchini (Highly recommend) only did one cup of cream (more than enough).

My husband absolutely LOVED this dish. The only thing I did was not use all of the heavy cream. My husband usually does not like anything with a "white" sauce. Be afterwards he wanted more sauce, lol.

I followed the recipe other than using a yellow bell pepper instead of green because it was what I had on hand.  It turned out wonderfully!   Husband and I agreed that next time we might try adding a few pieces of crumbled bacon.

Oh this recipe is definitely a keeper.  Made it the way the recipe stated to except I cut the chicken into strips first, tossed with the cajun seasoning and a little olive oil then baked in the oven just until it was no longer pink.  Then I put the chicken into the skillet and followed the rest of the recipe.  This made the chicken very juicy and flavorful with the spice cooked through.  This was so good!  We served it with garlic bread and a dinner salad.  Next time I will try to make the sauce a little thicker but that's just personal preference and didn't affect the flavor or our enjoyment of it at all.

This was quick and easy.  I thought it was pretty good.  My husband and I are kind of picky about creamy sauses, and this one was a really good balance.  Will be making again.

FANTASTIC! I added a bit of flour to thicken the sauce, and some shrimp and it was a score for us!! I will definitely be making this one again.

We loved it.  The only thing we will change is to add some cajun seasoning and crushed red pepper to add more kick.  We also didn't love it was only 2 servings but easily doubled the recipe for our family of four.

This was delicious, we did add some vegetables and cornstarch to thicken it. Otherwise I suggest the water/flour to thicken the sauce a bit. It was just spicy enough without being too spicy for the kids :)

First time making it and it was really good! I was confused as to what cajun seasoning was but found a cajun creole seasoning at the supermarket and used that. I did reduce the heavy cream to 1 cup, extra cajun seasoning and fresh basil and it was perfect;)  Also If u let the sauce simmer it does thicken up a bit and not quite so runny.  Overall I was very satisfied. Taste like a restaurant style dish. It may take me a few more times to make it over the top delicious but even as is it was delicious!

We loved this recipe.  Took the advise of others as we did not need to consume the calories.  I doubled the recipe and used only 1/2 cup of heavy cream and used fat free half and half with a TBSP or so of corn starch.  Used the frozen onions and peppers and amped up the seasoning.  This is company worthy. Thanks for sharing.

Wow!  Definetly making again!  I am fresh out of cajun seasoning, so i used a grilling seasoning, and worked out wonderfully.  Next time I will try adding frozen stir fry veggies, for ease and variety.  Otherwise, awesome dish and far better than any frozen ready meal and fast to prepare!

I gave this 5 stars, since we really enjoyed the flavoring of this.  However, we did not like how runny the sauce was (I know it's a personal preference, thus the reason 5 stars!).  I will definitely be making it again, but I will thicken the sauce.

Should have read more of the reviews first.  This was SO SALTY that it was almost inedible!  Added more cream and made a cornstarch slurry to thicken.  Helped some, but will definitely not make again unless I can find a Cajun seasoning that does not have salt; same with lemon pepper.

Bland and almost had a beefy taste to it.  Not enough sauce to cover pasta as written.  Had to amp up the cajun seasoning.  Will not be making again.

Delicious! I did change a couple of things: left out the onion and mushrooms (kids don't like them). I used 4oz of heavy cream, 1 cup of half & half, and 1 1/2 cups of 2% milk; 1 heaping tbsp of cornstarch - mixed it together. My sauce thickened perfectly and I saved some fat & calories :) I did use a 12" skillet pan to make the chicken and sauce. My daughters asked for this to be added to our dinner menu :) Thank you for a fabulous and easy recipe!

Instead of heavy cream, I used 1 1/2 cup low fat cottage cheese mixed with 4 tbs powdered milk, mixed in a blender until creamy. This worked well and reduced the fat and calories.

Followed another top reviewer's suggestions to make the Cajun seasoning as opposed to buying it as I didn't have the Cajun seasoning.  I also substituted spaghetti for the linguine and didn't add lemon pepper.  I accidentally forgot the grated Parm at the end, but I don't think it mattered as the dish was delicious!  I liked the consistency of the sauce with just a touch of cornstarch added to thicken it faster!

Love this recipe.  We do use fat free 1/2 and 1/2 instead of the cream and also use penne and rotini instead of the linguine.  Love it and eat all winter!

Note:I made changes so take that into consideration with my rating. 1) Replaced Heavy cream with milk. 2)Used faux chicken :)  3)No green onion so 1 Tb regular used. -------------I had to amp up the seasonings and sprinkled some crushed pepper, thyme, & oregano. It was actually nice & creamy without all the heavy cream fat added. I think rosemary & fresh garlic would be good too. Next time I might use 1/2c less milk, try a "drier" pasta. Pretty quick to make.

Delicious recipe, with some adjustments made.  First, we cooked more linguine per serving since we were starving, and added a few cloves of fresh minced garlic to the mix.  Used less green/red bell pepper, but added in some sun-dried tomatoes and green olives into the mix, along with extra seasoning and salt.  Baby Bella mushrooms were perfect for the recipe, especially when they got mixed with the other ingredients we added.

Definitely want to make this one again, but I may add some artichoke hearts to the mix just to see how they fare.  My biggest suggestion though?  Make more than you know you could possibly eat.  The leftovers were 10x better the next day...one friend ate them for lunch and dinner 2 days in a row!

My family LOVED this recipe. The only thing I did different was I added about a teaspoon of corn starch to thicken up the sauce. After mixing the pasta with a little parmesan, I combined everything and and placed it in a baking dish then topped with a little fresh blend of pepper jack cheeses. I baked in the oven for a few minutes to melt the cheese at 400. It was amazing!!!!

Very tasty!!!! This is definitely now part of my collection!  I changed one things and used 1 cup heavy and 1/2 cup light cream to cut back on the calories... also.. this made way more than two servings... I also used about 6 oz of pasta instead of 4 and shredded Parmesan instead of grated. I'll be making this one again for sure!

The flavor was wonderful after I added more Cajun, at least double or so.  The sauce is what bothered me, it was just too thin.  I would have let it simmer even longer than I did but I was worried my chicken would be completely overdone if I did.  I think I will play with the sauce consistency next time but other than that , it was fantastic!

Made it for the first time tonight and it was delicious!  Mine didn't thicken up either (but I was in a hurry) so I just added some milk/corn starch.  It was a quick and delicious meal!

Took the advice of others and increased the Cajun seasoning. I did need to use corn starch to thicken it but it was still delicious. Everyone asked for the recipe! I will make this again and again.

I Tripled the recipe, except for the cream (only used 2 cups) - it was a bit too spicy.  Next time I'll cut back on the Cajun Spice.

This was delicious! I minused the green peppers though. I also used portabello mushrooms. I chopped up alittle more green onion and diced up a tomato then put it on top of pasta after it was dished. Then the parmesan...wow it was good...unfortuneatly not to my waist size.

Delicious! I'm sure that any pasta would've worked. I  used shells. I also didn't have any heavy cream. I substituted 3/4 cup of milk and 1/3 cup of melted butter instead.  I'm sure the heavy cream would've made it better but mine still turned out very tasty!

YUM!!!! The heavy cream makes this meal a bit heavy and too thick, so try using half and half or just milk with a tablespoon of cornstarch mixed in. The first time I made this I didn't have any red peppers or onions, but it was still really delicious.  The second time I made it, I used the peppers, but it wasn't nearly as good.  You can really experiment with this one and add any vegetables you have on hand.  I like it with mushrooms and sundried tomatoes for a little color and flavor.

This recipe was GREAT! I added a little more cajun since we LOVE spice, and instead of fresh peppers added a bag of the frozen srir-fry peppers with onions. That worked just fine and tasted great. I used light cream and added some corn starch to thicken. Will definitely make this again!

I made this for my husband, daughter and very picky eater son!  EVERYONE LOVED IT!  It's definitely a regular menu item in our house!  With a lot of recipes being so bland, it was nice to not have to doctor it at all.  It was perfect!  In fact, I think we'll have it tonight!  YUMMY!!!!!!!

Very good! My family loved it! I adapted to 4 servings and only used 2 cups of cream. Used diced chicken tenderloins.Addedmore cajun seasoning. Would make again but try to lighten it up a bit for less calories. Thanks for posting.

excellent recipe. I added starch to thicken it up as I put more veggies and most likely added extra water in the process. I also BBQ the chicken which turned out amazing as the pasta sauce had a hint of char in it.

This was delicious! I just add some hot pepper sauce to give it a little kick (I recommend Chalula). This will be a new regular recipe!

This is a fantastic recipe.  We made it 3 times this week because we just couldn't get enough.  This is much better made fresh because I don't feel that it has the same consistency when reheated.

AMAZING! Read a lot of the reviews ahead of time and was excited to try this for dinner tonight. Came out perfect! I skipped on the mushrooms and lemon pepper and added shrimp and cayenne pepper. Couldn't taste better! I did thicken the sauce with some flour. About 2 teaspoons and it was great! Definitely will make again!!

Very similar to Cheesecake Factory's bowtie pasta chicken dish, except the chicken isn't breaded and fried. A little less cream, calories and fat, and it would be 5 stars.

great recipe. I added white wine and sun dried tomatoes. I also used a blend cream, to cut down on fat. I ended up needing to thicken my sauce, so i used brown rice flour, because thats all i had. The consistency went a little cruddy. Next time, i will try plain white flour. overall, very delightful!

I'm giving the recipe as-is 4 stars... But with a few changes it was better than 5 stars! I marinated the chicken with white wine, olive oil and about 4 teaspoons of cajun spices for 24 hours. I also added about 3 cups of heavy cream (and then some extra cajun spice and cayenne pepper!) and it turned out DELICIOUS! Definitely will make again.

this recipe is great! very easy to make...you just need a few minutes to do all the prep work with chopping the veggies, etc...maybe add some red chili pepper flakes for more of a kick and a touch more salt. everyone who ate it loved it....restaurant quality :) it is a rich dish with the cream & some butter but good for an occasional indulgence!

I had Creole seasoning, so I used that. Overall a pretty good recipe but seems to be missing something, just not sure what. We ate this over linguine with garlic bread.

I have made this a few times, usually using the frozen peppers/onions because they're less expensive and some version of low fat cream or half-and-half.  It's always been good, but I can never seem to make it thick enough.... something I'm still working on.  Still, my husband and I both really like it, especially with a whole lot of Cajun spice.

This was very good and EASY! We had pork chops the other night and had a chop left over. I sliced it up and used that in the recipe. We also had spaghetti the previous day as well so I used those left over noodles. It turned out great! I didn't measure and just guessed on most of it. I think it needs more cajun seasoning though. I also considered adding red pepper flakes.

This was very easy to make.  Because I did not have heavy cream I used a pinch of cream cheese, flour and 2% milk for the sauce.  I pored this over spaghetti and it was awesome!

This was easy to make and delicious.  It has wonderful flavor, but you could also add some cumin or cayenne pepper as well to make it spicier.  The recipe does not say this, but if you leave the sauce sit at the end for 2 minutes it will thicken.  I didn't do this and the sauce was too runny.  After a few minutes we went back for seconds and it was thick.  Will make again.

I thought that this was and easy dish as well as delicious.  I used egg noodles instead and it still was wonderful.  I also left out the parmesan cheese, but that was on accident.  I am pretty positive I don't want to add it, considering I don't think that it would add much.  I also used regular milk and added flour to thicken up.

Delicious!  The sauce was a bit runny, so I added the parmesan cheese and a little bit of flour to thicken it up before serving.  Was just as good, if not better, than cajun chicken pasta dishes served at restaurants.  I do have to be honest though, I didn't measure out the spices, just threw them in.  I will definitely be making this again!

Tasted just like my favorite dish at a local restaurant! Only complaint was sauce was a little runny and not as spicy as I had hoped but those are both modifications that I can make.

Excellent recipe...I didn't have heavy cream, but I really wanted to try the recipe, so I used a jar of Ragu Light Cheesy Alfredo Sauce.  I also used another reviewers recipe for cajun seasoning.  We loved this recipe and will be making it LOTS!!!

Wow, possibly the tasiest thing I've ever made. I substituted fake qorn chicken for the chicken and broccoli for the mushrooms, a red and a green jalapeno for the green bell pepper, and half and half with flour for the heavy cream. Doubled the recipe. You could probably do just about any variation and it will taste YUMMY. Used the recipe for cajun seasoning here.

It was great looking, but tasted bland. I ended up only putting about 75% of the recommended heavy cream in it, and probably quadrupling the cajun seasoning to make it edible.

This is good. I added the parmesan cheese to the sauce instead of sprinkling on top at end. I was trying to thicken the sauce by doing this. I think I should have added more cheese; it was still a little too thin for me. But the flavors were great! The Cajun seasoning on the chicken did it for me!! I pounded the chicken before slicing. This made for very flavorful and tender chicken. UPDATE: the chicken needs to be seasoned with salt too before cooking. I made a rough of 3 Tbsp butter/3 Tbsp flour and added it to the chicken mixture before I added the cream and I like the thickness off the sauce much better. I also added some fresh chopped basil to the finished sauce. This always makes sauces taste so fresh! And I sprinkled some small diced tomato on top of the finished plated dish. I will try some crumbled bacon too. Yummy!!!!

Quick and easy! I didn't have Cajun seasoning per say...I used Emeril's seasoning mix with some extra black pepper and paprika and it gave it enough heat for me. Didn't use the lemon pepper either. Very good dish overall. Will definitely use it again.

excellent dish...i prefer more cajun so I would recommend a cajun rub next time.  If you follow the recipe it is a little runny, but we just used bowls instead of plates.  I wouldn't change anything about this plate unless you want to make it a bit thicker.

This dish is wonderful. Just made it this evening and it had plenty of veggies which is always good.  I used a whole packet of mushrooms instead of just 4.  The dish was very tasty and the chicken came out quite good.  I would say to make it a bit healthier, only use 1 cup heavy cream and 1/2 cup milk.  Some people said they don't like the soupiness of the dish, but I loved it!  One last thing - I added cayenne pepper for a bit of spice and some onion powder and topped the dish off with fresh cilantro.  The cilantro really really worked with this dish and is a MUST try! Hope everyone else enjoyed this dish as much as I did :)

Awesome recipe.  Will recommend to family and friends.  I used half and half instead of heavy cream and it was still yummy.  Cream would have made it thicker.

Very delicious. Easy to make with little prep and a lot of taste. My wife and I thought that it had a taste very much like a Chicken Carbonara without the bacon. We used a bed of bowtie pasta and loved it. Great recipe!

My boyfriend didnt like it because he said it was too plain. My daughter said she wanted the leftovers! Next time for flavor, I will be adding onion and a diced tomato and definitely real garlic. I will be omitting the peppers and scallions.

My husband and I made this together and it was amazing. My husband works part time at a local restaurant and this by far beat out their cajun pasta recipe! We shared with some friends and they licked their bowls/plates clean! Be aware that the servings are quite large!

Well we just went bonkers for this. I used one really big red pepper instead of the green one because I didn't have one but kept it the same, maybe an extra green onion though. YUMMMMMMY!

So delicious! I made it for 5 so I added more chicken & more vegetables and more seasoning to taste. I added yellow squash because I only had a green pepper (which I really enjoyed. I loved the mushrooms in this. I might try using all half & half thickened with cornstarch next time....to try and make it less fattening. Seriously so good!

Good!  I had lots of problems with this recipe, the problems being that I didn't have some of the ingredients.  So I kind of adjusted and it still turned out great!  I had a kick and I didn't use red pepper, but I used a recipe on this site for the cajun spice which might have been a bit hotter than the regular stuff from the store.

Taste wise...I give it 5 stars!   I rated it 4 stars because I felt the suace was a bit too thin.  Next time I will cut the heavy cream down to 1 1/4 or 1 1/3 cups instead of the suggested 1 1/2  cups but I will definetaly be making it again.

If you're trying to be healthy and cut back, don't use this recipe! FF half&half with the cornstarch is nasty. Use the heavy cream! I did not find much luck with making my own Cajun seasoning and it doesn't taste the same and since a lot of the flavor come from the Cajun, just go buy yourself a bottle of it. I used rotisserie chicken (it's precooked). You can toss that in at the end because it's already seasoned and if you cook it too long, the chicken texture becomes too soft and/or un-tender. If you like mushrooms add them in but if you don't the flavor isn't affected (I used white/button mushrooms.) And definitely add the full amount of salt.

This recipes is delicious! I doubled the spices, used pureed garlic (with a little olive oil) instead of powdered garlic, splashed white wine on the vegetables and used freshly grated parmesan cheese as a thickener, in the future, I will saute lemon zest with the butter. I highly recommend this recipe, its quick, easy and only uses one pot!

Absolutely delicious! I had to add a little bit of cornstarch to thicken the sauce, but other than that it was perfect. Also, I like to use angel hair instead of linguine. Everyone loved it and I'll be making it again!

Update: I've been making this for over a year now and it's become a favorite of mine. I use frozen peppers now (makes it faster and tastes about the same) and I use extra half & half. If you're doubling the entire dish, by the way, don't double the spices. It'll be extra spicy (which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it can be) if you do so. Use the regular amount of your spices, and then add spices in later once you've tasted it.

This is now one of our favorite recipes and we make it about once a month. So creamy and flavorful. We never have fresh mushrooms or lemon pepper around, but it is perfectly fine without them. Thanks for this recipe, Tammy!

This was excellent.  I followed the recipe except didn't add mushrooms (don't like them), added a 1/8th teaspoon of cayenne to kick up the heat and used the juice of a 1/2 lemon to brighten it up a bit,  a little extra salt and didn't use green onions, used a 1/2 sweet onion cut into strips.

Soooo good! I really like pasta dishes but my husband does not, so my goal was to find a recipe that would make him think twice about not wanting ANY pasta and this recipe did it! He loved it, he said it was the best pasta dish he has ever had!   I basically followed the recommendations of reviewer VBHOKIE by using unseasoned frozen stir fry veggies from the grocery freezer section that included onions, green peppers, red peppers and yellow peppers. I did not us mushrooms, I about doubled the Cajun seasoning, I used about 2 and 1/2 cups of the heavy whipping cream and I also slightly increased all of the seasonings. Make sure you season to your taste, my husband and I both really like our food full of flavor.  Oh yeah, another thing I did to add extra flavor was I cut up my chicken the night before and marinated it in Italian salad dressing overnight. When I was ready to start preparing the meal I drained the extra Italian dressing. That made the chicken so flavorful! Great recipe, I will for sure make it again!!!

Thank You,Thank You!  This is so delicious. Ive bee looking for years for this recipe!!!Followed other reviews advice an made with milk and corn starch to thicken.  Also used Pam and just a little butter to sautee chicken.  I dont think you would be able to tell and helps reduce the calories dramatically! As well dont be afraid to add more of All of the seasonings! Loved it! Is definitely a new family favorite,

Very tasty!  The sauce comes out a bit runny if you don't follow the alterations that recommend adding flour or corn starch to thicken the sauce.  Overall, a very good way to get over a 1000 calories in a sitting.

This recipe really didn't do it for me. The sauce was really thin so I added some flour and let it cook down for 5-10 minutes which made it a lot thicker. It was really rich and I couldn't even finish my portion. It was decent but I won't make it again. Just not my cup of tea.

This is amazing.  A staple in our home now.  So yummy!  Need to work on finding away to limit the Heavy Cream though.  Think I will try half and half.

Oh, this was good! My two-year-old even asked for more. Next time I will slice and not chop the bell peppers and add a bit more mushroom. I used 1 cup heavy cream and 1/2 cup milk, and there was a LOT of sauce. So maybe I will cut that back a little next time. Added fresh basil from the garden. Nice touch.

This was SO delicious and full of flavor!!  I was a bit confused by the "2 chicken breast halves" and assumed that meant one full breast...?  I did not change anything, except that I omitted the onions (don't like them) and mushrooms (forgot to buy them) and I was short on heavy cream, so I supplemented the rest with Vitamin D milk that I mixed 1tsp. of cornstarch into to help keep it thick.  Worked perfectly.  Next time I will probably cut down on the butter a bit I would definitely say to tone down the cajun a bit if cooking for those who don't like spicy.  We LOVE spicy and it was perfect as was for us.  Definitely a keeper recipe!!

Yum Yum Yum. I make the sauce separately starting with a roux since I use FF half and half. I make the roux with butter, spelt flour, and minced onions and garlic.

Made this last night and loved it! For those who said it was too runny, you must let the sauce simmer for quite awhile and it will thicken right up! I actually wish there were more sauce and I think I will make more the next time around.  I threw in some asparagus and some tomatoes as well and I did use more of the cajun spice than written. Great recipe!

Great recipe. To cut back on fat and calories I used Half & Half instead of Heavy Cream. I also added the parmesan in with the spices to help thicken the sauce.

Love love love this dish. A friend gave me some cajun seasoning from Texas, and I wasnt sure what to do with it. Lets just say I will be requsting more. This dish is easy and yummy. I love that I can add veggies depending on what is in season. This is a keeper for sure.

so so so so good!!! I made a few slight changes nothing major... I sprinkled my chicken on both sides until lightly coated with the Cajun seasoning,  increase the cream to 2c for more sauce, fresh basil. I did take my chicken out of the pan while the sauce was thickening, and added asparagus toward the end of cooking. to die for! my picky son ate it up in no time flat! I also used the whole grain noodles and they were excellent!

Delicious.  Absolutely delicious.  I reduced the amount of cream, and added flour and water instead to thicken up the sauce, so that I could reduce the calories JUST a little.  The cajun seasoning I used was a VERY salty, so next time I'll use less than the recipe calls for to balance things out.  Otherwise, this was probably the best pasta dish I've ever tasted. SO GOOD!

Last night, I made this for the second time in 2 weeks. Everyone loves it to the point that I will never have leftovers.  I used Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning to get the perfect amount of spiciness(a small amount goes a long way).  I also only used a cup of heavy cream and corn starch to thicken the sauce.Fresh asparagus made it perfect.

My only complaint was that the sauce didn't thicken as much as I would have liked.  I let it sit after cooking, but to no avail and I used less cream than called for.  The only other change I made was that I used leftover grilled chicken from the night before and just sliced it up and threw it in after the veggies had cooked down some.  It was very good otherwise and I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could!!

Excellent recipe as is.  I would use less green pepper next time and more cajun seasoning (can't use too much in my opinion!).  My whole family loved this!  I'll make again!

I was truly surprised when I cooked this. It's really tasty and super easy to make. I made some changes though. I added 1/2 teaspoon of all the ingredients minus the pepper. Next time I think I will try someone else's suggestion of adding 1/2 cup white wine :)

One of my favorite recipes - I've made it several times now.  I use half/half instead of heavy cream (just add a little corn starch), omit the mushrooms, and use frozen peppers and onions.  Made it for my mom once and now she makes it at least twice a month.

LOVE LOVE LOVED it! I only used 1 cup heavy cream and omitted the mushrooms and peppers. I also tried with shrimp but felt the chicken held the cajun better! Thank you so much- it really does taste like something you would get in a restaraunt!

I am such a picky eater and simply removing the mushrooms (for me) made this dish perfect. I would reccomend this to even picky eater children like me and mine!!!

This is superb! My boyfriend who is the pickiest person loves this! He says it's his second favorite meal ever (first is his favorite chinese place). He wants me to make it all the time! I'm going to try to make it 1/2 & 1/2 rather than the cream and then each time try to make it healthier. I also cheat and add cornstarch to thicken up the sauce. I add ground red pepper, a little garlic powder and more cajun seasoning too. I may make it tonight for dinner now that I'm thinking about it!

This has definitely made my recipe box! Very delicious. i omitted the mushrooms as I am not a fan, but otherwise delicious. I have made it at least a dozen times with rave reviews. I have also made it with shrimp which turned out equally delicious. Thanks!

Okay this pasta is great but i added parsley and olive oil at the end. Also some coarse pepper and tobasco sauce did it good. Overall this recipe was great but needed some adjustments. My family LOVED IT

This recipe is delicious.  It tastes a lot like a blackened chicken pasta dish we get at a local italian restuarant.  The only thing I did was I used jar alfredo sauce instead of heavy cream, and I used bow tie pasta instead of linguine.  For the cajun seasoning I used Zatarain's Creole seasoning and it tasted wonderful.  I also omitted the salt it called for because I figured the creole seasoning would supply enough salt.  This recipe is fast and easy and tastes like it took a lot more effort.

This recipe is delicious!!  I made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it.  I doubled the recipe, used 2 cloves of garlic instead of garlic powder, and a full quart of heavy cream.  It thickened up perfectly with a little extra time simmering.  I'm a beginning cook and this made me look like an experienced chef!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious and so very easy to make. I used whole wheat rigatoni and  definitely used more seasoning than the recipe called for. It was yummy for my tummy! However, it was a bit greasy when I reheated in the microwave. What's the best way to re-heat this dish?

This recipe was really yummy.  I'd love to make it again.  I gave it 4 stars because there weren't nearly enough spices in it.  So basically just a cream sauce.  I would recommend really tasting the sauce before serving it.  You'll probably want a lot more seasoning and spice.

Simple, tasty, easy addition of veggies for kids, and you can make it more or less spicy to suit your own taste.  I used half-and-half instead of cream and it was still very good.

I've been making this for quite a few years, and it is simple and really good.  I usually change it though.  I use a yellow pepper instead of green, adds great color.  I also cut up some hot Italian sausage for some extra kick.  If you like it hot like myself, I throw in a chopped Habanero.  For the cajun seasoning, I use 1 tbps cajun and 1 tbsp cayenne.  With all the extra ingredients, I usually use a entire box of Rotini noodles, and then freeze the left overs.

One of our favorite recipes. I use a whole box of linguine (breaking the noodles up before cooking)and basically double everything else, taking liberties with the green onions and mushrooms. I use 4 boneless chicken breasts and more cajun seasoning out of preference. I use 2 red and 1 orange bell peppers, 8 or more mushrooms, a whole bunch of green onions, a pint of heavy cream and double the seasonings. Its a keeper and a frequent dish at our house, easy to heat up at any time of the day when hungry.

Yum! This was really good, although it definitely took way longer than 30 minutes to prep and cook. My only huge change from the recipe is that there is no way in heck that 2 tsp. of cajun seasoning is enough. I just kept sprinkling more and more on the entire time, and it still could have used a wee bit more. Maybe that's just personal preference, but for anyone trying this recipe that wants *seasoned* chicken, use way way way more than 2 tsp. My boyfriend loved it, and added a ton of red pepper flakes to his to make it ungodly spicy. Thanks for the great recipe! I can't wait to make this again.

We really liked this. I did have to make a few adjustments though. I don't like mushrooms and maybe reviewers said they added no flavor so I omitted them. I also thought the sauce was runny (I used the right cream) so I added a bit of flour. Also we threw in some snap peas that we had on hand. Gave it some nice color and additional flavor. Will definitely make this again. My 14 month old daughter even loved it.

This was ok. Decent enough flavor, although I don't think it was spicy at all. So if you like spicy, you'll need to add more than the recipe calls for. And I was expecting this to be creamier and it was actually very watery. But the flavor itself was decent.

This is the best pasta I have tried on the site. It has so much flavor and is better than anything you can get at one of those chain Italian places. We've made this a few times and we haven't changed anything. It doesn't need any changes.

The only thing I did different was cook the mushrooms and peppers about 5-7 minutes and not the 2 minutes

This was great! I omitted the mushrooms and green onions and used a frozen peppers and onions mix that I had on hand. I served the sauce over fettuccine- this dish definitely need a bulkier pasta than your average spaghetti-and used half & half in place of cream. I also made my own Cajun seasoning using the "Creole Seasoning Blend" recipe on this website. I'll definitely make this one again!

I made this without the peppers, onions, and mushrooms.  It was very good. To make it easier on me I put the chicken in a ziplock bag to coat with the seasoning.  I used fettucine florentine instead of linguine. I also used an extra teaspoon of cajun seasoning (Tony Chachere's Spice N' Herbs Seasoning). Came out very yummy. Definite keeper.

My hubby thought it was excellent! I used a pint of fat free half and half and added two tablespoons of cornstarch to the sauce. Also left out the mushrooms and used more of the Cajun spice. Thanks for sharing!

This was very good! I didn't have linguine so i did corkscrew pasta. The only problem i had was that the sauce was runnier than I would have liked. But that didn't change the flavor any, it was yummy

We loved this recipe.  Changed it some because my husband had opened a jar of Ragu Alfredo sauce and I wanted to make use of it.  Used this instead of heavy cream.  Plus, it was his cooking night! He replaced Cajun seasoning with Southwest Chipotle, replaced lemon pepper with cayenne pepper and added red crushed pepper (about 1/4 tsp I think).  He also changed his mind about the chicken!  Added shrimp instead.  It was great and ready in no time!  Would probably be as good with ingredients specified here, but he likes it with a kick!  It was actually not too hot for me.  My 15 year old loved it too!

OMG!! I'm a terrible cook and only about 3% of my dishes turned, but this was delicious! I used red onion instead of green and Half n Half rather than heavy cream, added a little cornstarch and it turned out great!  So good, I've made it every week since I got the recipe.  Thanks for a great recipe and making  a horrible cook feel like a gourmet:)

Needed chili, a little lemon and maybe some wine.  Pretty good though, and its seems like it would be really hard to screw up, which is awesome.

This was a fairly easy and quick pasta dish, but I don't think I'd make this again just because of the calorie content.  For me, the sauce wasn't runny at all--I actually ended up adding 3 tbs. apple juice to get the right consistency.  There was enough sauce for me to use 7 oz of pasta, so this ended up making 3-4 servings for me.
WARNING: taste the sauce before adding extra spices--I took other reviewer's advice and added cayenne pepper which made the pasta too spicy for me.

This recipe was excellent! I modified slightly by adding black olives and marinating the mushrooms in garlic and olive oil.  I also cut back on the cream and added fresh roma tomatoes as a finishing touch.  This dish was even better the next day after all the spices had soaked in so it's great for leftovers!

This recipe is so good, I couldn't believe it.  I could not find cajun seasoning in the supermarket that I shopped so I used seasoning salt instead.  It turn out to be a very tasty dish.

we did not care for this at all...for some reason it tasted really "peppery" Maybe it was the type of cajun seasoning I used, not sure....but was disappointed.

Great recipe for simple ingredients that you'll most likely have on hand.  I only added about 1/2 of the cream, and julienned the peppers; I think they look prettier that way, and you get more flavor per bite.  As written, just spicy enough, though I made 2 separate dishes- one for the adults with the stated amount of pepper. Another for the kiddos with just a tiny dash.  Thanks!

Since we like spicy dishes spicy, I added 1/4 tsp more cajun seasoning(could have even made it 1/2 tsp more). This is a delicious dish that will definitely impress your dinner guests.

We loved this!  Turned out a very impressive dish, that actually was quite simple to make.  The recipe looked like a lot of work, but when making it, went together easily.  I would make this often except it does have a very high fat content.  But when you want rich and creamy, with a slight kick - this is it!

Very Good. I think I might have added too much cajun seasoning,...it was really hot! I didn't have red or yellow peppers so I added roasted red peppers instead...I also didn't have any mushrooms. I added 1/2 cup of heavy cream and used a 1/2 C. whole milk and the sauce was thick enough. My husband really liked it...next time I won't use as much cajun...or chili powder (oops!)

Very good recipe.  Make sure to pick a good cajun seasoning.  I highly recommend "Joe's Stuff" or, if you like heat, "Joe's Hot Stuff". It's also best to let this dish sit awhile in the pan so that it's not soupy and the flavors can absorb into the pasta.  We enjoy this on angel hair pasta.

Good but not that Cajun.  Needs more Cajun spices than calls for.  Will try to make a low-fat version next time.  But worth a try!

Awesome pasta! I used a lot of the modificatios posted by users, especially LESLEYSALYER. I did omit the cream/milk because I'm not a big fan of cream sauses. Will make this again!

Well I sorta follow the recipe above and also the recipes of reviews. First I did use chicken..I used steak, actually steakums they are sold in a box. I had no cajun season so I just follow the review below and made my own using cayenne pepper, garlic powder, pepper, onion powder, paprika and I also added steak seasoning. I use rotini noodles (sprial noodles). And finally it was very unclear to me with the cream, so I just use a condense cream of mushroom mix. I add about half of can water to mixture. The food came fabtasic. I will make again maybe next time i will used chicken.

Turned out great despite having to make a few changes.  I doubled the recipe and realized I only bought 1/2 of the cream so I used 1% milk for the remainder and then thickened it up by adding a tbs of flour and 2 tsps of cornstarch and letting it simmer for about 30 min while stirring every so often.  I didn't have any garlic powder but had garlic salt and used that instead.  I also didn't have Cajun seasoning so I used 1/2 tsp of garlic salt, 1 tsp of black pepper, 1/2 tsp paprika, 1 tsp of chili powder, a little bit of chili flakes and then added some hot sauce when everything had been mixed in together.  Also didn't have any dried basil on hand so used 1.5 tsps of fresh basil which I thought was still great.  Despite all of the changes, the pasta still turned out great.  Really adaptable and definitely a keeper.  Already had requests to make it again for Christmas!

OUTSTANDING! I did as another reviewer suggested and cooked the seasoned chicken in Pam, then removed it, and then cooked the vegetables, added a bit of flour, then the cream, and then put the chicken back in the pan. I can't find cajun seasoning here in England, so I made it using the recipe another reviewer left- it turned out great! It was the perfect balance of creamy and spicy, and the sauce was thick enough to coat the pasta, but wasn't too runny. Next time, I may add a tomato at the end like someone else suggested, just to see the difference.

I made this as southwestern flavours go down well in my house. And it was good plates were clean and this was quick and easy to make. Next time I would swap a tin of chopped tomatoes or some passata for the cream as the sauce just needed something and we aren't great fans of cream sauces. But thank you for this recipe it made a lovely change and I will be making this again.

My husband and I LOVE this recipe.  I have served it to many friends and always get requests for the recipe.  I have made a few changes.  To reduce calories & fat, I use light sour cream instead of heavy cream.  I cube chicken into bite sized pieces before seasoning with cajon & browning.  And I chop the peppers fairly small - so they are not so crunchy.  It's perfect with garlic & parmesan breadsticks and a salad!  Thank you so much for this 5 star recipe!

I made this for a welcome home dinner for my husband, and it was simply impressive!!!  I did lighten the dish up by omitting the butter and using half-and-half, some low-fat milk, and thickened it up with cornstarch dissolved in a little chicken broth.  Trust me, no one will know the difference!!!  Served it with a crusty loaf of bread, and it was devoured!

Very good, my husband loved it.  I couldn't do the cream so I did a roux of butter and flour and then added 2%, it was perfect.  Tip:  Don't think when you taste the sauce you need to season or salt it more, once you add the chicken and veggies, it's plenty salty!  That would be my only complain but I used creole seasoning and that tends to be salty, could be easily remedied in the future.  Great recipe to spice up our weekly meals.  Thanks!

I didn't use as much cajun seasoning, as my husband doesn't like food too spicy.  And I didn't have lemon pepper on hand.  I did think the sauce was a little too runny, so perhaps I should have thickened w/ a little cornstarch.  Overall good taste though.

I'm going to give this recipe 5 stars even if mine turned out too salty. Maybe my batch of cajun spice had extra salt in it. It was still amazing and would definetely make again but without the additional 1/4tsp salt.

This pasta was really good.  I followed the reviews of others, I used half and half, then thickened it with cornstarch, I also cooked the sauce seperate from the veggies.  I pounded out the chicken, and then rolled it in cajun seasoning (both sides),  I baked the chicken in the oven at 400, then julienned it, after I had tossed the linguine with the sauce and veggies.  Easy, and good presentation. FYI, cook the veggies longer, otherwise they are too crunchy.

If you are like me you never have all the ingredients or time to run to the store.  I used Creole seasoning instead of Cajun.  I did not have lemon pepper so I added a drop of lemon juice (while cooking the peppers) and 1/4 pepper instead of 1/8.  It still turned out Fabulous!

I've never really been an alfredo fan which is why this looked so appealing.  That, and I had the ingredients and wanted something new and different.  I'm so glad I tried it!!!

Because my husband is the pickiest eater on the planet I had to remove all of the vegetables.  I doubled the recipe because leftovers make my life much easier.  I did, however, make a mistake and used tbls. instead of tsp. for the cajun seasoning (which explains why it was so much spicier than I expected).  Whoops.  I didn't quite have three cups of heavy cream so I threw in some half and half.

The sauce seemed awfully thin to me so I thickened it with a little cornstarch.  Surprisingly my husband still enjoyed it after explicitly telling me he didn't want anything too spicy.  I think this one will definitely be showing up frequently on our dinner table.

Really liked this.  I didnt have the dried basil and dont think I missed it.  I replaced the cream with fat free evaporated milk(to reduce calories) and it was delicous and still creamy enough.  Will make this again.

This was pretty good but I had to add a lot more seasoning than recipe called for, otherwise too bland for us. This is also very unhealthy with the heavy cream so I think next time we might try half and half like another reviewer did.

This was so delicious! Everyone in our house loved it. I used one pound of chicken breast, 8 ounces of pasta, 2 cups of heavy cream, added a little red pepper flakes, and a little more of all of the seasonings (we needed more than 2 servings!) and it was so good! Will definitely make again.

Pretty Good!  I added some shrimp sauted in butter & hot sauce, reduced the cream to 1 c. as some suggested, added 1/2 c. chicken broth & thickened w/corn starch.  Also added 1/4 cup Cajun Sunshine (my favorite milder hot sauce) before serving.

This is one of our favorite recipes.  I use more cream, fresh grated aged parm (to the sauce and as a topping) and a little lemon juice. This is so good - can't say enough about it!

This is a great recipe for chicken pasta.  My husband isn't a big fan of pasta but he said he would definitely want me to make it again.  I added a little bit of lemon juice when the chicken was half way cooked and I used half and half.  I also left out the green peppers and mushrooms as we don't like either of them.  It tasted so wonderful the night I made them, but not so great the next day - it was kind of bland the next day.

This is a keeper! I substituted regular garlic for the garlic salt and used less cream and it turned out exactly how I hoped.  This is a good base recipe and you can modify the seasonings to your tastes.

I used spaghetti, half and half to save on fat and no green onion or peppers.  Everything else I kept the same.  I thought that it tasted really good.  Thanks for sharing:)

I modified this a little. I added shrimp and chicken (diced). I left out the green peppers and used Jalapeños instead, also added a dash of Tabasco. Next time i think I'll use real lemon instead of the lemon pepper. Overall this was awesome, my girlfriend was pretty impressed when she came home from work today.

This is my husband's favorite recipe!  We used to have to go out to eat to get a good cajun pasta, but not anymore!  I have substituted regular whipping cream in place of heavy to make it a little more calorie friendly.  Just add a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce and it's ready to go!  Fantastic!!!

I have made this 3 times and have it down to this... chicken breasts (bone in) with cajun seasonings, s&p bake 40- 45 min. Add 1 tsp cajun seasonings to spices, reduced peppers to 1/4 of red and green.  I used Fettucini Rigate to hold on to the sauce better. Plus Parm regianno 1/2 cup. Its a once a weeker!!!!

I was impressed with the recipe.  I love spicy foods.  I used creole seasoning instead of the cajun seasoning.  I loved it.  The chicken would have been good alone, but the cream really makes it the wow factor.  My husband said it was restuarant quality.

I made this for dinner with friends....everyone loved it!  Definitely not healthy, but delicious!  I doubled the recipe, used 2 cups heavy cream and 1 cup half-n-half.  I had to add quite a bit of cornstarch and water to thicken the sauce.  It was a hit!

This was a huge hit with my husband and friends. Hubby LOVES to cook cajun food but sticks to Gumbos and Etouffees. I thought that this would be fun and different, I added a little more of each of the spices then what was called for abd added file. It was terrific!

Delicious recipe. I also used half and half instead of heavy creamer, and it came out just fine. I also added some chili pepper along with the cajun and it was perfect. Thanks for a great recipe!

My boyfriend thought this was pretty good, I thought it was okay. We used Mccormick cajun seasoning, I didn't think it was spicy enough, or it didn't have the hot flavor that I like. I would prefer grilled chicken instead of fried as well.

Seems I accidentally used creole seasoning instead of cajun seasoning, but it was still great.  I know that with cajun it'll be just as delicious.

Point is, if cajun is too spicy for you, use the creole instead (I used a little more than 2 tbsps).  That way you can still enjoy this delicious recipe.

This was wonderful! I added more cajun seasoning during cooking. I added some onions that I had in my fridge as well and this was great. My boyfriend tends to be picky and he loved it!

I made this last night for my boyfriend. And he absolutely LOVED it. He loves spicy food and this hit the spot! I couldn't find any fresh scallops so I doubled the amount of shrimp. DELICIOUS!

Not bad, the flavor is pretty good.  This would be good in a pita pocket as well, I'm thinking.

I was unable to find Cajun seasonings exactly so I used Creole seasonings. I am not sure if it is the same thing but it was wonderful. The creamy sauce needed longer time to cook but it was awesome.

I don't know where it went wrong, but this was just "okay".    I had really high hopes, and we love cajun, so it sounded like a winner.  I'll have to try it again, and see if it comes out different (better), because I absolutly trust the rating system here at Allrecipes, and the opinions of its members.  Over 500 five-star reviews can't be wrong...right?!  Maybe I mis-measured or something...???  I'll happily eat the leftovers for lunch though!

The pasta was good, but the chicken was not.  I added some exta cajun seasoning as some suggested, but the chicken still had no flavor.  I will make the pasta again, but not the chicken.  I would give the pasta 4 stars and the chicken 2.

This was a good base recipe.  I add cajun seasoning to the sauce, about 1/2 cup of marinara sauce, and 1/2 Tbsp of crushed red pepper.  I think if I wouldn't have added a little more spice, it would have been pretty plain.  I also add a bit of cornstarch and about a cup of Parmesan cheese to thicken the sauce up.  Its a good recipe to play with and make your own.

This is the best dish in the world!!!!  I took one bite and thought I was in a fine Italian resteraunt.  This recipe is one that I will keep forever and tell all of my friends and family about.  My husband made this dish and he doesn't even cook so if he can make it anyone can make it.  Very easy but a lot of prep work he said.  The only thing he did wrong was he added 2tbls. of Cayenne pepper instead of 2tsp.  It was very, very hot!  But it was so good we could not stop eating it.  He also left out the onion and mushrooms b/c he doesn't like them.  At first we thought the sauce was too runny but once you mix it with the noodles and let it set for a few minutes it thickens right up.  I think you should make this recipe and try it yourself.  Words can not describe how yummy it is.  If you don't like it then you need to get your taste buds checked out.

AMAZING 5 star recipe! The flavor is sooo good. Not only is it incredibly delicious, it's quick and easy too! The perfect recipe. The cajun seasoning I had on hand was Emeril's Bayou Blast Essence. This will definately be going into my favorite recipes list! Thanks so much. :]

This dish is great! I add a little white wine with the cream to add more flavor. My boyfriend loves the spice of the Cajun and I love all the pasta with the  cream sauce. It is a great combo!

Excellent, excellent, excellent! This is an excellent dish for dinner parties. The complex flavor of the cajun spices really complements the sweet milky flavor of the cream. A word to the wise, though, you might want to avoid this recipe if you're not fond of the creamier pastas. Otherwise, prepare yourself for a real treat!

Im so dissapointed that I was dissapointed with this recipe.  After all the review I was expecting something so much better. It smelled great while cooking, but there was hardly any flavour. I may make it again, and hope this time was a fluke.

I love this pasta.  I made it for the first time not think that my kids would go for it, but they love it.  It is now a regular at our house.  If you have a hard time getting the sauce to thicken just add a little cornstarch and water.  Best pasta ever.

This is a great recipe. My wife and I just finished eating this and we both loved it. We used Tony's Original Creole (great for cajun food) seasoning, because that's one of our favorite seasonings. The only thing I would suggest is to not put in all of the cream in at one time. Put about half and mix it and if you want it more creamy, go ahead and add more until you're satisfied with the thickness. Once again, EXCELLENT RECIPE!!

I have made this many many times! This recipe is outstanding. I always double the recipe and its more than enough for 4 hungry people. I only use one of each pepper out of personal preference. Also cornstarch is basically a must with this recipe. It doesn't thicken well, but add a little cornstarch and your good to go!

I made this pasta dish and my family loved it. The cajun seasoning was not spicy at all so we just added more on our plates. My sister doesn't care much for the green pepper or red one but she could not really taste it. This was great. The sauce was a little thin so i just added some corn starch and a little water to the sauce. It turned out great..nice recipe and was quick to make.

We tripled the recipe, and I agree with other reviewers that the recipe calls for too much cream.  I put in ~2/3 of the required cream, and the recipe would have been too soupy.  I opted to strain the liquid out and reduce it before recombining to serve.  That worked very well, and my wife and I both enjoyed the flavor and texture.

Excellent recipe.  I will either cut the sauce in half or double the pasta next time though, as it turned out more like a soup than pasta.  Was very good though.

I've made this recipe several times and my husband and I love it!  We omit the mushrooms because we don't like them, but added asparagus (cut up) in its place at the last minute after I've steamed them (you can add zuchinni too).  Now that I've read other reviews I will start to add cornstarch to thicken it up a bit because it is a bit runny.  but delicious and definitely restaurant quality!!!!

Excellent restaurant quality recipe.  But, you DO have to be smart about changing the number of servings or it will be too soupy.

This recipe had an excellent flavor!  My husband really liked it.  My sauce just came out too runny for my taste.  I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but I'd have enjoyed it more if the sauce was a bit thicker.  Also, not sure where the "cajun" comes in.  I probably wouldn't make it again.  I would rate it more 3.5 stars.  Just above average.

I thought this was very good, but nothing special.  It was pretty much like other creamy chicken and pasta recipes I've tried.  The sauce was thin, although it was very colorful.  Easy to prepare.

Don't let the photo fool you!  This is a colorful and delicious meal that will leave you asking for seconds!  I do think that 1 1/2 cups of cream is a bit much because it makes the sauce VERY thin, but other than that I love this dish!

Took others suggestions & used 1c half & half. I didn't use any salt/pepper & next time I'm reducing the Cajun seasoning to 1 1/2tsp because we thought this was still to salty. We did love this recipe otherwise. EASY.

This had great flavor, but it was way too soupy for my family. I will definitely make it again, but will cut down significantly on the cream and will likely add grated parmesan to the sauce to thicken it a bit.

This recipe would have been outstanding, if I had ensured I had all the ingredients before I started making it. I didnt have heavy cream so I was forced to use milk and ricotta instead. Not exactly what the author envisioned I'm sure and defintley not the final version, but I can tell if I had use the right ingredients this would have been great.

This was awesome...great flavors.  I used 2 cups of heavy cream and reduced the cream, basil, lemon pepper, salt, garlic powder, black pepper and parm cheese for about 10 minutes in a seperate pan then mixed that mixture into the chicken, pepper and mushroom mixture.  I also added really ripe tomatoes.  I suggest cooking the cajun seasoning right in the cream reduction for more even zip!  Will make again for company.

This was wonderful and did remind me of the cheesecake factory cajun pasta dish. I put the butter,cajun seasoning, chicken and all the vegetables in skillet and cooked at one time instead of tossing chicken to coat with seasoning and it was great. I also added some sherry just because a had a little on hand from another dish. A little bit of wine would also be good to saute with.

Great recipe!  My hubbie doesn't like a lot of chicken dishees, but he loves this.  It has just the right amount of flavor..not spicy, but good flavor.  I didn't add the veggies, b/c we don't care for them and it still tasted great!

This is a great recipe. It get better and better everytime I prepare it. My husband loves this dish almost as much as he likes the cajun pasta dish at the Cheescake Factory restaurant. I am learning to cut up my veggies the night before to reduce the prep time. This recipe is a definite crowd pleaser!

Very Tasty dish. Did not want to use that much heavy cream, so I used about a 1/2 cup and used regular milk to supplement the rest of the cream. Peppers add a nice flavor to this dish.  My family  really enjoyed this meal.  Thank You for sharing!!

This was great!  I made this for my fiance' and his son (13) who is always talking about how well his mom cooks.  He loved it and even ate all the left overs the next day!  They both went on and on about how good it was.  It was fast and easy.
The only thing I would change is I would cut down on the cream.  The sauce was way too watery...I'd put half the amount of cream next time.

I thought this pasta dish was great! I made enought to share with other family members and everyone loved it. I was also great the next day when I reheated it for lunch! To change it up a bit I substituted a half cup of the cream with some left over alfredo sauce I had! Absolutely two thumbs up!

This is awesome!!! My husband couldn't stop picking at this while I was fixing it and devoured it at dinner. I left out the mushrooms because I didn't have any and used regular onion instead of green. I didn't have the green pepper either, but even missing those components it was still outstanding. This will definitely be a family favorite. Thanks for the recipe!!!

This was the first recipe I have made off this site that I will keep for life! I did do some minor changes as other reviewers suggested. I used a ton of fresh garlic (a whole bulb we love garlic in my house) I also added some brocolli at the end which made it superb! I didn't have any cajun seasoning so I used a ton of cayenne pepper and garlic powder...Thanks for the wonderful recipe, my boyfriend asked me to cook it again the next night!

This recipe is great.  I added 2 cups of evaporated milk and one cup of full cream but had to add some corn starch to thicken it up.  I also used some taco mix and added chilli powder instead of cajun seasoning (couldn't find any my grocers).  All in all a very good recipe.

Absolutely Wonderful! Best pasta I've ever had and I made it ) If you double or triple the recipe don't double or triple the whipping cream. It won't thicken up right if you do. I didn't add mushrooms and I put the green onions, and bell peppers in the chopper. This was wonderful. Thanks so much for a great recipe. =)

absolutely fabulous and a beautiful dish as well.  even good cold the next day.  I added a more seasonings to the sauce (to my taste) and used evaporated milk and cornstarch as the base. like other reviewers mentioned, the sauce thickened up once i turned of the heat and added the pasta.  therefore, if using cornstarch, give the dish a few minutes to "rest" before serving.  Great sauce, wonderful for bread dipping! Thanks!

So yummy!  Tastes better than the Cajun Chicken Pasta served at a local restaurant!  I don't usually like Cajun food, so I made this recipe more for my husband, but I loved it too!  I added 1 T. cornstarch to it after adding the spices to thicken it a bit, but it was perfect otherwise!

Just goes to show you can't always judge a recipe by its five-star status.  Too bland and fattening for all the work and time.  Even using the tips from the previous reviews couldn't make this a keeper.

This was an easy, fast, delicious recipe.  I used canned mushrooms (prefer fresh, but in a pinch...) I recommend being generous in the sauce to pasta ratio- the cream sauce is very good and we all wanted to get the last bit onto our garlic bread.

My family loves this meal.  I have also fixed it for family when they come in to visit from out of town and it is a hit.  I also serve it with garlic bread and a wonderful glass of wine for the adults and no can eat anything else.  This is a truly a restaurant type dish!

This recipe was excellent. I typically don't like pasta but wanted to try something different for my anniversary dinner. I have 2 words "Loved It".I used evaporated milk and added flour to thicken. I doubled the chicken and added onions less peppers. Of course I used a lot more cajun season to put a kick to it.

This recipe was very tasty, I added garlic and cilantro. I also think it would be good with some brocoli added. The only time consuming part is chopping the veggies, other than that it's an easy, great recipe.

I'm not a cook at all and have tried a few recipes on this site (all with some degree of success).  This was very easy to prepare and cook although I probably quadrupled the ingrediants.  I put about 2 pounds of chicken, 16oz of fettucini, 3 whole bell peppers, a whole stick of butter and a ton of sliced green onions, a whole clove of garlic and used half-and-half (with cornstarch).  The cornstarch was pretty key...needed to thicken that sauce up and it seems like I never used enough cream.  The only real problem I had was that I cooked so much for so long in such a small saucepan that the chicken basically shredded itself, so my Cajun Chicken Pasta looked nothing like the picture but still came out AWESOME.  I think the only way to screw this up is to use too little spices.  I threw in a link of spiced sausage for added flavor and it worked great!  Next time, more sausage and maybe some crushed red pepper to bump it up a notch.  Oh and since I'm not really a cook, try to avoid this one big error: a "clove" of garlic doesn't mean the entire bulb. It's one little segment (a bulb could contain anywhere from 8 to 40 cloves)

This was just ok. My husband liked it a lot more than I did. I definitely dont think that it was a 5 star recipe.  I used whole wheat pasta and added cornstarch and extra seasoining because the sauce was very thin.

This dish is very heavy. If I end up making this dish again, I will decrease the amount of cream and peppers.

We really enjoyed this pasta. All the cutting was time consuming, but well worth the wait. I changed out the chicken with specialty made sausage, and I think it was the better option to go with the cajun feel. Definitely make this for yourself and others!!!

I thought this recipe was decent but not like "woopie". Maybe it needed more seasoning, or salt, but it was better than many recipes I've tried

I loved it, but cut the peppers smaller (bite-size) and use angel hair pasta. 
From a VERY picky eater, I guarantee this will be delicious!

My boyfriend and I loved it...he seriously licked his plate clean :)
I made a few changes - omitted the bell peppers, used a whole container of sliced mushrooms, cut chicken into small cubes and added sliced tomatoes during the last 2 minutes of cooking.

Although this is too "heavy" for me to have very often, I do greatly enjoy it when I decide to make it. Instead of heavy cream, I substitute evaporated milk. It still comes out delicious, just less fattening. I also add a few shakes of red pepper powder. I like my food spicy! Other than that though, I follow the recipe exactly.

Wonderful!  I used 3 cloves of garlic and half a cup of grated fresh parmesan but everything else remained the same.  I will definitely be making this again because the whole family loved it.  I might also try using whole boneless/skinless chicken breasts but it really is very good just as it was.

This turned out to be a very good dish that everyone enjoyed. The only thing I might change is use less Whipping Cream so it might thicken up a bit more. Overall, a very good flavored dish.

This recipe is one of our favorites. I have made it several times since I first discovered it. It is one of my husbands favorites. We make it when we have company and I always hear alot of praise about the pasta. I like to serve it with french bread sliced in half with butter garlic or garlic powder and parmesan cheese. If you have no french bread you can substitute just bread. I find this recipe is very acceptable to everyone and does not take too much time. Well worth every minute!

Really, really good.  I doubled the recipe, and used twice the pasta above that (16 oz. for a double recipe), but only used about 2 cups of cream thickened a little with arrowroot.  With those changes it was just right and made for one of the best meals that we have had in a long time!!

Yummy.  My husband loved it.  I was a little worry that he won't like it becuase it was a tat bit creamy.  Turn out my husband said that it wasn't too creamy at all.  It was just perfect he said.  I added fresh basil because I had some on hand.  The pasta was full of fragents from the fresh basil.  Thank you Tammy

i really loved this; it reminds me of the cajun chicken pasta i always get at fridays. and it was so easy; i am EXTREMELY SLOW at preparing any type of food, but this was effortless. i used only 2/3 cup of half and half for two servings and added some cornstarch at the end. also, i substituted one of the chicken breast halves for a small handful of shrimp. thanks x 100000 for the recipe!

This turned out really good!  I added some yellow pepper since I had it around and some chopped white onions.  I doubled the recipe, but didn't double the cream - used 2 cups for a double recipe.  Thickened the sauce with about 2 1/2 teaspoons of corn starch mixed into 1/4 cup water like others suggested.  I would imagine the cajun seasoning you use makes or breaks this recipe.  We used Luzianne and it was flavorful with a nice kick.

This was fabulous.  The sauce as others have mentioned definitely needed to be thickened.  I also cooked up another 1/2 lb of linguine and added it to my leftover sauce.  I had doubled the recipe.  I think it needs about twice the noodles that it calls for and a bit of flour to thicken it up.  All and All...a keeper!  I loved it!

We thought this was okay. There were too many peppers and the sauce needed to be much thicker.  The lemon pepper seasoning overpowered all of the other flavors.

I WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS WHEN I WAS MAKING THIS RECIPE. I AM NOT A BIG FAN OF GREEN PEPPERS, BUT I ADDED THEM ANYWAY. TO MY DELIGHT THOUGH, THIS RECIPE TURNED OUT INCREDIBLE! I ALSO ADDED FLOUR TO THICKEN THE SAUCE. THIS RECIPE IS DEFINITELY A KEEPER!!!

Awesome!!  I followed the recipe almost exactly (I added a little flour to thicken it up a bit) and it was perfect!  One thing I did notice was it made a little more than 2 servings, atleast at my house.  I fed my family of 4 with it, although my kids are just 3 and 5, and still had leftovers.

This is FANTASTIC! I have made it several times, and it is one of very few recipes that I have followed to the "T", but I would not change a thing. Everyone who I have made it for absolutely loves it. Thanks for the recipe :)

This recipe was simple, had great presentation and the taste was amazing.  Everyone loved it and went back for seconds and thirds.  The only thing bad with this recipe is the nutritional info.  Not recommended if you are on a diet.

Heavy cream just seemed too decadent, so I substituted half and half, then thickened it with a little cornstarch.  I'm not a big pasta fan myself, but my husband said it's the best recipe I've found in eighteen years of marriage!  I thought that alone should rate it five stars.

A very colourful but disapointing recipe. It was not very flavourful at all. I had to use 1 & half tablespoons of cajun seasoning but the result was it only got spicer, not more flavourful. Given all the good reviews I imagine that cajun seasoning in the US is quite different to what I get in Australia.

Excellent recipe!  My boyfriend loved it- said it tasted like something he'd get in a restaurant.
I left the mushrooms out and used one red bell and one yellow bell pepper. Will definitely do this one again!

Great recipe!  Easy to make and delicious.  What really sets this recipe apart is rubbing the cajun spices in prior to browning the chicken.  I scaled back on the cream---1 1/2 c cream for a double serving of the recipe---and found that the pasta amount called for is perfect.  Great recipe, a real crowd pleaser!

Delicious chicken pasta dish--rivals restaurant versions.  Great to serve for company and not too spicy to be a crowd pleaser.  I used 1/2 cup less of the cream to reduce fat and calories.

Delicious!!  I took the advice of some other reviewers and used 2 T of cajun seasoning instead of 2 t.  It was a little too spicey for my husband.  Next time I won't use quite so much!!  I will definitely make this again!

This is a five star meal!! My husband gets so excited when this is on the menu. The only thing I do is I double the pasta. If not, there is a lot of sauce and not so many noodles. I have and will continue to make this again and again.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful. I made it for supper and it was a real hit. This tasted like one of the dishes from Macaroni Grill. I will definitely make this recipe in the near future. Thanks for a great recipe.

Great recipe with some minor changes.  I more than doubled the cajun seasoning and then added some paprika for umph! & color!  :)  It also needed some thickening of the sauce prior to mixing.  All in all, a fabulous recipe!!!  Tastes just like a restaurant!

EXCELLENT!!! I made only a few adjustments after reading the calorie and fat content LOL!  I used fat free half and half and just thickened it with cornstarch.  I also used double the amount of Cajun seasoning since our family likes spicy foods.  Personally I thought it was too much spiciness but Hubby loved it (I'll bear with the spiciness for him)!  I also used flash frozen chicken tenders that don't need to be thawed before cooking (per package) and just added the cajun spices top the frozen chicken while cooking...amazing flavor!  Thanks for the great recipe Tammy, it's definitly a keeper!!!  PS, sorry for the few changes I made but I would never had enjoyed my meal if I knew how much fat and how many calories I was eating!! LOL

Unbelievable! I've now made this three times for four separate people and they ALL raved. I didn't have heavy whipping cream the first time, so I used sour cream... it was still wonderful, but the sour cream did give it a much different taste than the heavy cream. Using the heavy cream is much better. I also thought you needed more pasta. I scaled the recipe to serve 4 people and used a whole pound of pasta. Angel hair works great too!! Thank you for the awesome recipe!!!! I will make this again and again!!

I made this last night.  It was very good, but I feel it can be a little better.  Next time I will marinate the chicken in the Cajun seasoning.  Also I would like the sauce to be a little thicker.  Maybe I will heat the heavy cream separtely and add parmesan cheese.

I absolutely LOVE this dish.  I make it whenever we are having company (of course, I have to double the recipe) and everyone else raves about it, too!  The only thing I change is that I don't combine the finished sauce with the pasta.  Rather, I dish the pasta out on plates and then spoon the sauce over it.  It's easier that way to dole out the right amount of veggies and chicken.  Also, I buy the stir-fry chicken instead of breasts.  It's already sliced and saves time.
Fabulous recipe, Tammy!!  Many thanks!!

This recipe is delicious!  Forget all the additional seasonings.  Just use half a bottle of Chef Paul Prodhomme Poultry Magic.  It has it all, and makes an easy dish easier.

This recipe was awesome! My husbands always takes a deep breath when I get new recepies but he actually loved this one! The suace was creamy and the bell peppers were very colorful. The only thing I did differently was marinate the chicken breast for about 30 minutes in cajun seasonings then grilled them on an indoor grill. Then I sliced them up and added them to the creamy sauce. It really brought out the flavor. Even my 8-yr old loved it!

This is an excellent recipe.  I got raves from family and friends.  However, one caution, do not add extra cajun seasoning - gets VERY VERY hot, too much for children.

My family liked this recipe, but we didn't think it was anything to write home about.  I doubled the recipe for my family of 5, except the bell peppers. I used 1 green and 1 red (and I personally thought it still had too many bell peppers).  I used creole seasoning instead of cajun (it was what I had), and I was not at all impressed with the flavor of the chicken.  In fact, I picked most of the chicken out of my helping.  My husband loves cajun flavoring, but he couldn't taste it at all in this dish.  I used 8 oz. fresh sliced mushrooms which, frankly, were the best part of the meal.  I did, however, love the sauce.  It was my kind of thing, not spicy - just creamy.  I used shredded parmesan to top it off, and it was great.  I think this meal could be wonderful if I used shrimp or scallops (or maybe both) in place of the chicken.

Once you have the cutting and chopping done, this recipe comes together very quickly. The spiciness is subtle; it's not overwhelming to people who don't like hot stuff(like my 2yr. old). I've had to thicken it with a bit of milk and cornstarch mixed together both times I've made this.

This is sooo good, but definitely don't add all of the cream.  I made it once with all the cream and it came out bland and watery.  The second time I made it, I only put in a tiny bit of milk and it was perfect-- so much more flavorful.  It is also delicious with fish (like talapia- though it flakes up a lot) or shrimp.

This was fabulous!!! Everyone at my table enjoyed it very much.  To cut the fat I took another user's advice and used fat free half and half.  You will need a thickening agent for this recipe though.  Enjoy!!

This was excellent.  I used the cajon seasoning recipe from Emeril's website.  I used 1% milk thickened with corn starch instead of heavy cream and it turned out great.  Will definitely make this again.

This is DELICIOUS!!  At others' suggestion, I used only 3/4 c. of half and half...still plenty of sauce.  I have also doubled the recipe, using only 1 c. of half & half..great!  I've varied it as well, using bowtie pasta, adding more cajun seasoning (love spicy stuff), using shrimp, using hot turkey sausage, and even using a combo of chicken, sausage and shrimp!  It is so good and easy!

Great recipe!  I also added extra mushrooms and cornstarch to thicken.  I thought it could have used a little bit more spices in it though, and maybe some cheeses blended in.  I will make it again!

I really loved this recipe.  To cut some of the fat from the recipe I substitute a can of low fat cream of chicken soup mixed with a little milk for the cream.  I also added 1/2 pound of low fat turkey kielbasa sausage and it turned out wonderfully.  I will definitely make this again!

This was really as good as everyone said.  We have had cajun pasta at resturants and this was by far much better.  I liked it with the cornbread, it added a little sweetness to the spicy pasta.  Will definately try this again.

I have made this recipe several times and each time, I had everyone wanting a copy of it.
I've changed it up a little.  I add a few tablespoons of flour to the cream to thicken it up just a little.  I also add extra cayenne pepper for added heat.

This is the best pasta/sauce dish I've tried yet. I used half N half and found I did need to use the cornstartch to thicken it up.  Otherwise a great meal.  I'll make this again.

This was GREAT!  I worried when I first made the sauce that it was too thin and runny, but it worked out really well.  I served it for a luncheon and it was a big hit.  Thanks for sharing it!

This was GREAT!  I, too, had to add some cornstarch to thicken the sauce (used half-n-half).  I also added some spicy sausage in with the chicken, and it turned out incredibly well.  The red and green peppers make the dish lovely to look at, as well.

"You have really outdone yourself"  is the comment I heard when I served this to family and friends.  I used more seasoning than stated. So easy, and so delicious.  Served with homemade rolls.

This is a great recipe. I served it for dinner when we had some friends over.  The adults absolutely loved it, but most of the children found it a little spicy. However, that certainly isn't going to stop me from making it again!

OMG, this was fantastic! I also put 1 tbs of flour with 1 cup of half and half cream to thicken. Tasted just like a restaurant pasta with great spices. YUMMY! Give it a try!

This was very good, but I definitely recommend removing the chicken from the pan while sauteing the vegetables, increasing the spices & adding the corn starch. I will definately make again, with these changes.

I loved this and served it over egg noodles but next time I think I will cook the chicken and place to one side then cook other ingredients to form sauce. pour some over noodles and toss, then reheat chicken and drizzle remining sauce over top. I will try to make this healthier next time too. This is a definate keeper  :)

The cooking time is off. The vegetables preparation time wasn't taken in consideration. I cooked for 6 servings and took me an extra 20 minutes to be ready. The actual cooking time posted on the website is right on the nose. Every body love the taste we all have seconds.

This recipe is really good and pretty simple to make.  It does need to be thickened a little but a little cornstarch takes care of that.

I have made this recipe several times and everyone loves it.  My family likes a little more spice, so I added more cajun seasoning and tabasco sauce when I added the cream. Gave it a kick.  Thanks for such a great recipe!!!!

My son loved this dish.  I, however, found it runny, bland, and full of fat.  The spicy chicken pieces were delicious and the vegetables went well with them.  The whole dish just didn't come together well.  If I made this again, I'd reduce the amount of cream, and I'd thicken it with flour or cornstarch to give it the rich texture it ought to have had considering the amount of cream and butter included.  I'd also increase the number of mushrooms to at least 8 oz.

I thought that this was a great recipe.  My husband loved it.  The sauce was a bit runny, so we added flour, next time will add corn starch when mixing in all spices.  But I thought that it was excellent and will make it many more times.

I prepared this wonderful dish last night and received kudos from my husband and son! They LOVED it! The sauce is creamy, bursting with color (green onions,green and red peppers)and FLAVOR! Try this recipe...you won't be disappointed. *hint-I doubled the recipe, and you may want to too, this way you'll have more than enough for seconds....and thirds....

This is a very good one-course meal. We made some seasoning adjustments, which is to be expected with a spicy dish. We added more Cajun seasoning as well as salt. I also thickened the sauce just a bit. Overall, an excellent and easy recipe.

Terrific recipe! I've been wanting to spice up my cycle of meals, and this did the trick. Followed others' suggestions with the cream: for my low-fat diet, used half n' half instead (only a cup) with a couple teaspoons of flour. Also, boiled it just slightly to thicken faster. Very tasty and spicy!

I made this for a Survivor night dinner party and we all LOVED it! Both of my girlfriends want the recipe and I'll definitely be making it again--might add shrimp next time! Thanks All Recipes! (Like others, I used Half and Half and flour to thicken--no heavy cream in our house!)

I have to tell you. I loved this recipe. The only thing I would include in this recipe is cook the chicken and remove it from the pan to continue to cook all other ingredients and put chicken back in pan for just a few minutes to warm it. Thanks, Terry

This recipe was great!   I cut down on the amount of bell pepper and cream by about half of both.  Otherwise, you just can't beat it!  My husband and I absolutely loved it and I will definitely be making this on a regular basis.   It is hard to believe that something so delicious could be so easy to make.   It tastes just like one of those wonderful pasta dishes you would order at a fancy restaurant.  Truly a wonderful dish.

Wow!  This was fabulous!  I halved the cream since you just need enough to coat the linguine and doubled the cajun seasoning..since we like it spicy!  Restaurant quality!  I will be making this often!

This was fantastic!  It tasted like something you'd order at a restaurant.  I don't use the heavy cream the recipe calls for.  I just used a little table cream (about 1/4 cup)and it turned out great.

This was excellent! Great flavor! Almost like Chili's penne pasta dish. Make this if you like cream sauces, such as alfredo. Very easy to make and pretty quick too. I couldn't find anything labeled "cajun" seasoning so I used Emerill's Southwest seasoning. You will miss out on a great dish if you don't try this!

what a delicious recipe, i added more pasta and cut down on the onions and heavy cream and it was just perfect.  the great thing is that you can add as much or little of the "garnish" as you want (pepper, onions, mushrooms) and you can make it as spicy as you want.  great taste!!

This is a pretty quick dish for chicken.  I didn't have any cajun seasoning, so made my own with ground red pepper and garlic powder.  It still turned out wonderful!  My husband enjoyed the spiciness of the dish (it was a little on the too spicy side for me).

My husband loves this dish!!  I have been using lowfat evaporated milk in place of the whipping cream to make this dish less fattening.  I have also added sausage and asparagus.  This is a great recipe.

I loved this dish. I forgot what I was doing and used 4 times to much seasoning. It was so hot my husband had a hard time eating it but not me. Next time will follow direction better. The extra spices I used made it way to hot for the kids.

This was absolutely the best!  I cut down on the cream to 1 cup - and it was delicious.  Also, the spice was just right for me (my stomach can't take hot/spicy foods) and my husband who likes hot foods said it was great.  I made it for valentines day dinner and will make it again soon - maybe tonight!

Out whole family loves spicy food and this was no exception. I used chili pasta and it was a little to much for even us. So I sugggest mixing 1/4 chili pasta with the rest normal and it makes a really good dinner with easily reheatable leftovers. Very good and quick something you could have all the ingredients pre-prepped so when you came home you could throw it together.

This was delicious!!  A bit spicy for the little ones, though.  I doubled the recipe, but only used 2 cups of 1/2 and 1/2 in place of the cream, which seemed to be just the right amount of liquid for about 3/4 pound of linguini.  I also added a bit of flour so the sauce would thicken.
DELICIOUS!!!!

Really good meal. However, you can definitely cut down on the heavy cream, since it just produces a watery sauce, most of which gets left at the bottom of the bowl anyway. I also substituted half heavy-cream, half-skim milk with no untoward effects.

Beware of the salt!! I'm not sure if my Cajun seasoning was different that others, but it contained a ton of salt already, and after adding the 1/4 tsp of salt I had to scrap most the sauce and add a extra cream to get rid of the saltiness. After it was solved, very good!!

I too thought it was very good. I followed the recipe exactly and did think it could be spicier. Also it called for too much cream. Next time have the cream and double the spices.

Made this the first time for Company and we all loved it.  I also used half and half cream and thickened with a little cornstarch.  One of the best recipes I've make in a long time.

I thought this recipe was delicious.  My whole family enjoyed it too - including my young daughter.  It is not spicy - the Cajun seasoning is more seasoning & salt than fire.  I would even recommend omitting the 1/4 salt called for in the recipe if you don't care for salt.  I also tried substituting half-n-half for the cream and it turned out very good.  Next time, I will try using half of the Cajun seasoning on the chicken and then adding the remaining Cajun seasoning when the other spices are added to give the sauce a bit more zip.  A good company dish.

Very Good! I modified by using 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream (had to thicken a little), also added 1 more tsp of Cajun Seasoning for more bite. My kids loved it!

This was one of the best things I have ever fixed. I also added a bit of fresh cilantro and it was WONDERFUL! Even my picky husband ate two helpings.

Family enjoyed it. I ahd a slight variation, no mushrooms and it was still delicious. I was surprised as I expected it to be spicier than it was. My 3 yr old loved it too!

This was amazing!!!  We live in Paraguay where it is hard to find a recipe where it actually works and comes out good.  This was perfect and will be made again and again.  My friends can't wait to try it!

Very good recipe. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed it. May be a little too spicy for children. I wonder if there is a lower fat way to make this recipe excluding the heavy cream? 
Thanks for the great recipe.

Bravo!  I made this dish for Valentine's Day for my fiance' and me; we both loved this dish!  I found it to be a quick and easy meal to prepare but, the taste was to die for. Whenever I prepare this dish again, I will remember the first time we shared this dish together.

We all loved this recipe but my kids wished that it didn't contain green pepper (but my husband and I liked it that way).  I had read the reviews first so I increased the cajun seasoning to 4 tsps. and added 1 tsp. of cornstarch to thicken the sauce at the end. I also substituted half and half to reduce fat. It was excellent.

I loved this recipe. I added basil pesto instead of the dried basil and garlic powder and I used Half and Half. I thickened it with a little cornstarch and about 2 tbs Ricotta Cheese. These changes made the recipe wonderful!

This is a great pasta dish and really fairly easy to make.  I made it for several friends on Valentine's Day, and it received rave reviews.  Like others have recommended, I used half and half rather than cream and doubled the amount of Cajun seasoning.  You may want to scale the recipe up so you'll have leftovers!

This recipe was a hit at my house. I made it very spicy with extra (not double) cajun seasoning. I did not add any bell peppers. The sauce was just perfect, I used half and half, brought it to a boil, let simmer on low/med for a few minutes to thicken. My 3 children loved it. Will definitely make again.

The whole family enjoyed this recipe.  I added some diced jalapenos in with the peppers and I also added more peppers.  Finally, I added a little jalapeno juice in with the heavy cream.  It added just the right amount of spice.  Will make this again.

I have been looking for this recipe for years!  This was exactly like I had in a great restaurant and so easy!  My husband wished there were more leftovers for his lunch!  Oh, yes, it needed MUCH more cajun seasoning and I used half & half and thickened it just a little with cornstarch.  This was just WONDERFUL!  It is now part of my personal favorites cookbook!  2/18/14 update.   Still make this and often for company.  Sometimes I use shrimp..as good, if not better!  Always use more green onions because we LOVE them.   I measure the seasonings and it is always amazing!

BRAVO!!!!!!!  Wonderful recipe.  A new staple in our home.  I also added a little more cajun spice (1 1/2-2 TBS).  Fantastic with a salad and crusty French bread.  If you are serving people who aren't partial to peppers, shred them fine with a cheese grater.  Still get the flavor but won't scare the pepper haters away!

Absolutely wonderful. We as well doubled the cajun seasoning amount, and my husband thought it could've had even a little more. I think 4 tsp was perfect. The kitchen smelled so nice!

Winner!!  My husband doesn't usually like "creamy" pasta dinners but he loved this one.  My picky children even liked it.  I also increased the cajun spice.  Great with a glass of red wine. Mkeddie, Canada

My husband and I thought it was okay.  The kids hated it - green peppers and mushrooms.  Won't make this one again.

I made it without the cajun seasoning because I didn't have any and it still turned out DELICIOUS! a total hit in my family and I will definately make it again.
