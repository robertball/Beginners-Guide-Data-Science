maybe it was the fact that the recipe was poorly written, or that the fish is cooked too many times, but my family and I thought this dish was horrible. First off, 3 Tablespoons divided is 1Â½ Tbsp., yet the first line says marinate the fish in 2 Tbsp. of oil. Secondly, The swordfish was way too tough from being marinated in lemon, which partially cooks it, being fried and THEN finally being boiled in wine.. and it was ALOT of wine. No time limit was stated as to boiling it off before putting the fish back in. We had rubbery swordfish in wine. Next time, I would not fry the fish with the onions and would put it in at the very end after the wine had completey cooked off.

I originally gave this recipe 3 stars, thinking that the fava beans were no good.  My notes I made on the recipe said they were "yucky" tasting.  I have since made it again and have decided that this entire recipe is "yucky."  I used canellini beans and it was baaad.  My family hates it.  I hate it.  I threw this recipe away.  I won't waste my time with it again.

Seeing as how my mother is from Calabria, I thought I would give this recipe a whirl, and am I glad that I did! Thanks Salvatore, this was delicious, very easy to follow. I had no trouble with rubbery fish.

this was great.  I didn't have canned fava beans so I had to cook them myself.  I cooked them in the pressure cooker which did an ok job, but left some of them mushy. this actually worked to this recipes advantage because it created a kind of white wine, onion, fava bean sauce which really went well with the swordfish.  Not sure how that person overcooked the swordfish, it came out perfect for me.

I'd have to agree with some of the other comments about the reviewer who thought the fish was rubbery.  They must be cooking-challenged or maybe they used inferior quality fish. I made this last night and my wife and I both loved it!  It's light, but filling and totally delicious!  definitely a keeper. I used butter beans instead of favas, but any meaty bean would work. I also suspect that halibut would work great if you can't find swordfish. Nice work, Salvatore! YUM!!!!

Wow, what an amazing recipe!  I went out on a limb and tried this recipe for the first time for some friends during a dinner party.  The response was overwhelming!  I had no problem with chewy fish or an excess of wine in the finished product.  I will definitely use this one again!

I saw this in my recipe book after forgetting about it for 2 years, and I remembered how much I liked it. I don't remember any rubbery fish problem. I can't wait to make it again!

Yummy.  My husband isn't a big fan of sword fish.  But this tastes pretty good.

This recipe had a good taste to it but was a little bit mushy because of the beans. I subsituted fava beans for white and pink beans. I would of got the fava beans but the grocery store didn't  have them.

I love fish and have been looking for a way to shake up my usual lineup of recipes. This was a great change of pace!

I only marinated it about 10 minutes (to keep the lemon from overly softening the fish) and used reduced-sodium cannellini beans instead of favas. Light and delish!
