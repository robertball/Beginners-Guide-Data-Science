This made a different side dish.  It smelled heavenly while I was saut√©ing the garlic, onions and ginger with the curry powder.  I used fresh green beans, which I had blanched and added to the pan and mixed with the aromatics.  I think I would cut the oil to 2-3 tbs.  I tried both chilled and warm and prefer warm.  This was a hit or miss with my family, they were almost evenly divided.  Thanks for sharing.

This was a wonderful salad I made it from leftover fresh green beans that marinated overnight and served it on a bed of romaine lettuce with feta cheese on top, delicious!

I added a can of kidney beans and a can of garbanzos and more onions and used lemon juice (2 lemons) instead of the vinegar).  Except for the canned green beans getting mushy and falling apart it would look pretty good.  I like the flavor with the other ingredients.
