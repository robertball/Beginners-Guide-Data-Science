This is my first review, and I'm happy to report it's a great one!  I added a few ingredients, namely a few additional garlic cloves, a small handful of minced ginger, a can of Rotel tomatoes, and some dried basil and oregano.  Also, instead of using canned black-eyed peas, I used dried, and pressure cooked them beforehand (took only 10 minutes).  Served with avocado slices.  What a great way to start out the New Year!

This is my husband's favorite vegetarian recipe!  We have it once a week.  We sometimes add homemade salsa to the mixture in the tortilla for more zing.  Great recipe!!

I've made this several times now, and we really enjoy it. I do have to tripe the recipe to feed my large family. I also alternate between grilled corn tortillas and whole wheat ones. I also add more garlic than the recipe calls for  (we love garlic) and I add a couple drops of liquid smoke seasoning.This is terrific with sour cream and guacamole. Thanks for the recipe!

This is another favorite in our home.

I use a pound of dried black eyed peas, soak them, cook them, and then adjust the recipe accordingly.  We each eat 2-4 of these for dinner, then have leftovers for a couple days.  (They are even better the next day!)

I've made them with & without smoke seasoning.  I like them with, but it is great either way.

I also choose to use corn tortillas, but again that is just a personal choice.  (If you DO use corn tortillas, you need to heat each of them on a very hot skillet before using them.)

Simple, great recipe.  I added an extra clove of garlic and omitted the vegetable stock.  I think any stock would make this too liquidy.  Serve with shredded cheese and sour cream.

This is a great and very tasty recipe, but I'm not sure how they can claim this serves 4. It was barely enough to fill 3 tortillas. I recommend at least doubling the recipe.

I thought this came out really good. However, I added pickled jalapenos instead of fresh, and tripled the recipe to fill 8 tortillas. I also allowed it to "cook down" so that there was virtually no liquid. Distinguishable citrus flavor - tangy and delicious! Serve with sour cream.

Excellent recipe. Tasted great. My picky husband enjoyed it. I omitted the stock (there really isnt a need for it). I added extra cheese. DELICIOUS!!!

Not bad! I added chicken and corn to it. I also added a teaspoon of oregano and a few tablespoons of enchilada sauce to give it extra flavor! YUM!

Very tasty, and pretty easy to whip up too. I didn't have veggie broth, so I used chicken instead. I'm not a huge fan of jalepenos, so I used green chiles instead. Ate this in the tortillas with homemade gucamole and with a side of Mexican rice.

Was pretty good, a nice change for black-eyed peas..I doubled the recipe & it needed a bit more flavor so I added the liquid I'd reserved from the cans of black-eyes peas & a small hamhock (from the pot of collard greens that were also on the stove) & doubled the garlic. Gave my guests & family the choice of eating as a side, a dip or burrito filling. Everyone said that while they were the best they'd had, still nobody was converted to black-eyed pea lovers...Happy new year!!!

I gave this 5 stars because it gave me the jumping off point to make a really good meal. I changed a lot of the recipe but I kept the back bone of it and everything was great. Thanks for the inspiration!

Amazing flavor, especially for the amount of ingredients involved and the simplicity of the recipe. I added some cilantro and a couple of dashes of cumin.

Very yummy.  Used red pepper flakes instead of a jalapeno and it was just enough spice.  Topped with sour cream.  Was great even without cheese.  Could of used less liquid though, I let it simmer for quite a while so it wasn't so soupy.

My husband and I liked this recipe. I didn't use the jalapeno or veg. stock since I don't like jalapeno. Instead I used rotel (drained). It honestly didn't look good but we were pleasantly surprised. Kids, who love black-eyed peas, didn't care for the dish though.

Amazingly simple. My expectations weren't high after seeing the mixture. But these were delicious! Definitely don't need the large tortillas. Small ones will do.

Meh. Despite the massive amount of onion (and extra garlic) I found this to be rather dull and uninteresting. And strange on a tortilla.

4/5 only because we modified it. We used a tablespoon of salsa and a shake of hot red pepper. This is a healthy and simple recipe. Thanks for sharing.

This was a super simple, yet tasty way to use up my extra black-eyed peas.  I didn't have any fresh jalapeños so I used a small can of diced green chiles and added cayenne pepper for the heat.  I also added chopped fresh cilantro and cumin powder.  Really yummy as a warm salsa with chips!

My husband & I really liked this one!  I used water instead of veg broth, and I put a couple of spoonfuls of real bacon bits & some chopped up cooked chicken in to simmer.  Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic and flavorful.  Black Eyed Peas are great and the seasonings in this recipe don't make you miss the meat at all

My mom used to make a recipe similar to this one.  I made a few changes to this one (some from previous suggestions).  I didn't add any stock and used green chilies instead of jalapeno peppers (but would be good with them too), used 2 cloves of garlic, 1 can of diced tomatoes and some oregano and basil.  I also added more lime juice.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This was good.  Very liquidy, not sure why so much broth is needed.  Filling and affordable meal.

This recipe was just ok. I think I'll stick with the more traditional recipes with ham for my New Years Day peas. Thanks for the recipe though!

The recipe, as is, is on the boring side which is why I gave it only three stars. But I think it could be improved with some additional ingredients.  It was very easy to make and healthy.

I give it five because I would like it as written but...dietary restrictions. It still deserves five for adaptability. I used low sodium chicken stock and dried peas. I added onion, garlic, cumin and oregano and some Rotel to beans as they cooked. Drained liquid, topped with a little feta cheese...absolute heaven. I will try again with Mediterranean flavors instead of Mexican.

This is another simple, tasty, and healthy recipe using black eyed peas. I have to admit that I was never a fan of black-eyed peas. But this recipe made me a believer that they could be quite flavorful. In this recipe, you simmer it in stock, jalapeno, garlic, onion, lime juice, and other seasonings. You can then spoon the mixture into a freshly toasted tortilla. The fresh cilantro topping is a must.

This was fabulous and I'll be making it a LOT!  I put a bag of dried black eyed peas into the slowcooker with water and cooked on high about 4 hours. Once drained they were ready for this recipe.  As per other reviews I added chicken stock and cumin.  I also added a jar of my homemade salsa and canned jalapenos. Served with corn tortillas. LOVED this recipe.  I can see so many uses for the leftovers - salads, burritos, nachos, etc.  Thanks for the recipe!

Simple, inexpensive and delicious. i have only tried them with canned beans, but I will try the pressure cooking method with dried beans next time. We really enjoy these as a light dinner.

Very good. I made this for lunch & used Habanero & lime flavored tortillas (from Trader Joe's). I also omitted the vegetable stock, doubled the garlic & onion & served with sour cream. Delicious.

I liked this recipe!  After looking at the other reviews I added a tomato and some extra spices, and left out the stock.  I ended up eating it like a burrito with cheese and it was great!  I will for sure make this recipe again.  Thanks

Can't say it was a family favorite on new years.  On the otherhand, I don't normally like black-eyed peas, I found this super yummy!  I used frozen instead of canned, and served with sour cream and cheddar cheese like others suggested.

Excellent! I omitted the jalapeno pepper & stock and substitued a can of undrained Rotel. Used a little sour cream & shredded cheese as condiments - so quick & easy!!

This is wonderful. My husband and I are vegetarians, we never thought of this combination for tortillas. My work place had a very large luncheon with many torillas left, brought them home and this was the first. Very flavorful,satisfying.
