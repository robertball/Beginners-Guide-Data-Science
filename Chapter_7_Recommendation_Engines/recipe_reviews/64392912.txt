This is my recipe and I just wanted to note that I think the fact that I make my own cream soup takes it over the top! You just melt 2tbls of butter, whisk in 3 tbls flour & 1 tsp chicken bouillon then whisk in 1/2 cup water then 1/2 cup milk and whisk until thick.  This also freezes & refrigerates well before baking
