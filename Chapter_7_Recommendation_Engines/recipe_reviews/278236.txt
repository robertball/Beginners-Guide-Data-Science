Delicious!!! I made this as Chef John's recipe was written and this spread is a winner. A no mess way to eat Buffalo style chicken with all of the favorites you would expect. Be sure and make the blue cheese spread and put it on a crostini!

I used White Castello cheese instead of blue cheese as hubby not keen on  blue.  Delicious!
