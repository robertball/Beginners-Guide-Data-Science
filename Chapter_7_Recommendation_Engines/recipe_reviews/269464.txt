I love anything with that fall like spice to it! This is probably the best recipe for this kind of cookie yet. Like another commenter said, there are soft and sooo delicious. My husband doesn’t usually like spice kind of cookies, but he absolutely LOOOVED these! Whoo Hoo!

I’ve never heard my kids say “ mmm” so many times. I liked them just as much, and the recipe wasn’t to complicated. Highly recommended.

I added a big more nutmeg and was extremely satisfied. The grand kids loved it too, to my surprise. Very happy with this recipe, thanks a lot, Sunny days Nora.

If this is even possible, I found a way to make these even better!! By adding a little lemon juice, then a little lemon zest on top.  Super!

These are identical to the cookie my mother used to make. And I’m very pleased that it’s pretty simple ! This is a great recipe and I’m so happy it’s gotten so many great reviews. As another commenter said, it would be helpful if this recipe had a video. I’m not the best cook, so I’m pleased I could manage to make this one, and, I’ll make it many times again. My mother used to make these when I was a boy, and bring them out to me as I played in the sand box. Lol, brings back happy memories. And, these are sooOOOoooOO good!!

With so many good reviews, I had to try it, boy am I glad I did! I’m gonna make these again for sure. All my co-workers were asking for the recipe. So good! Finally a good recipe worth making again. I absolutely love the fall- like spice to it. And so did everyone at work!

A great recipe, instead of making them with milk chocolate use dark chocolate.
