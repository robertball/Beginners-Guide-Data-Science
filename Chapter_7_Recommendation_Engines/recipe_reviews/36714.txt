I did not care for this.  Perhaps I just don't like tiramisu.  The texture of the wet lady fingers just didn't do it for me.  My husband took one bite and that was it.  The filling is good though.  I won't make this again.

Better than restaurant tiramisu and light!  One thing I did that really improved the texture was add a tub of Fat Free Cool Whip to 1/2 of the cheese mixture.  I put a layer "Non-Cool Whipped" cheese mixture on top of the first layer of ladyfingers then added Cool Whip to the remaining half of the cheese mixture and topped the second layer with that.

While this was very easy to make AND very tasty, I think next time I too will add some Cool Whip, the marsacpone/cream cheese mixture lacked a "fluffy" quality that is found with most authentic tiramisu.  The taste of Kahula is VERY subtle, so if you want it more pronounced I suggest adding more.  Also, putting the cocoa powder in a small sieve and then tapping it works great to sprinkle it evenly over the top.  This tasted MUCH better after it sat overnight.  Overall, a very yummy recipe, but it needs just a little tweaking to make it perfect!

Mmmmmmm....this is delicious!  I did make some changes...since I didn't have enough cheese on hand, I made 1/2 the recipe in a loaf pan (9x5).  I didn't have any mascarpone cheese, so I used an 8 oz. block of light cream cheese (Neufachtel).  As another reviewer had suggested, to improve the texture, I mixed half of the cream cheese mixture with non-fat Cool Whip and used that as the top layer of the tiramisu.  Next time, I think I'll mix the entire cream cheese mixture with non-fat Cool Whip and make this both layers.  My bottom layer of ladyfingers was a bit soggy because I soaked the ladyfingers too long...will know for next time.  Overall, this is a delicious light recipe (relatively speaking).  I will definitely make this again.

Wow! I made this for a dinner party, and EVERYONE loved it! I must note my alterations:
I used a 1 whole container of marscapone, 1/2 a tub of cool whip and about a 1/2 cup of cream cheese. Dolly Madison Angel food cake was used in place of the ladyfingers. I used 1 1/2 cups of espresso and 2 1/2 cups of Kahlua (my friends are lushes)I placed about 4-6 tablespoons of the coffee mixture in the bottom of the pan prior to placing the cake in (in fear of a soggy bottom layer, I didn't dip them)
I made this dish the night before I needed it. EVERYTHING tastes better overnight! Call me a fanatic, but this final step really kicked the recipe into high gear: after about 10 hours in the fridge, I took another 1 1/2 cups of kahlua and injected the tiramisu in various places with a syringe to infuse the liquor in the cake. To die for...

I made this for our office party and everyone raved about it.  I could not find ladyfingers or spongecake so had to make from scratch, but turned out okay.  I was scared that the coffee mixture was too strong so I did not use all of it.  Also, I ground semi-sweet chocolate chips into a powder and used in place of cocoa.

I love this recipe and so do my family and friends.  I am asked to make it everytime I go to a get together.  I added 3 or 4 more tablespoons of Kahlua and used double the marscapone cheese and cream cheese (not fat free).  It is really easy and I like that I don't need to use raw eggs!

Yum! I admit, we used double the mascarpone cheese and neufchatel instead of nonfat cream cheese, but this recipe is still much lighter than most!  Also used a whole grocer's angel food cake as no ladyfingers were available - 3/4" slices did the trick nicely.

I oversoaked the bottom layer of ladyfingers, so this didn't come out so well. But even with that said, I didn't feel this recipe was a keeper.  I have had Tiramisu at a restaurant once, and I didn't feel there was enough of the cheese mixture to make it even close to being comparable.  Hmmm.

I made this dessert for 6 people who have very different palates.  All of them wanted seconds, even the person who hates coffee!  I also reccomend shaving chocolate over the top as a ganish, and leaving this in the refrigerator overnight.  You might also want to make the ladyfingers yourself, which is unbelievably simple, even for someone like me who has never baked anything from scratch before if you use the "ladyfingers" recipe from Allrecipes.com as well.

I made a few alterations to the recipe, I used 'ultra low fat' cream cheese because I couldn't find non-fat, it worked out well. I also used 'Splenda' in place of the granulated sugar. As well, I think you could cut down on the amount of Kahlua as we found the flavour very strong (even though we really like Kahlua!).  Lastly, if I were to make this recipe again (which is likely), I will not add the brown sugar, the dish is sweet enough without it.

I made this for a group of co-workers (12) and they all loved it.  It was easy to prepare (although I had some trouble finding Marscapone cheese, but now know where to look).

This is a great recipe. We live in a small rural twon and many of the ingredients were not available, even with subs it was great!! Can't imagine how awsome it could be with all the right stuff! Used all cream cheese instead of the mascapone and just added about a 1/8 C heavy cream to "richen" it. Used sarah lee frozen butter pound cake cut in slices instead of the lady fingers. I am sure baking your own would be even better but making dinner for 24 with 4 children is challenging enough. Super recipe!

This was amazingly easy to make and everyone thought I'd spent hours on it!!!  The key to the recipe is soaking the ladyfingers just right.  Mine came out a little soggy so the next time I make it I'll soak "quickly" as the recipe states.  I used double the amount of cocoa and grated semi-sweet chocolate for the topping.

Love it Love it Love it! Even my husband keeps asking when I will make the next one! Being french canadian, we love brandy in coffee so I added a little shot of brandy with the kahlua/coffee mixture for dipping. I also dip a little longer for stronger taste. Yum!

I've only gotten complements with this dish. What I also like to do, however, to improve upon this is take Cool Whip, add a shot of Kalhua and spread it over the top. Let the tiramisu harden for a while in the fridge first though before adding the topping.

Easy recipe to follow seeing that there are no eggs or whipped cream in the ingredients list.  Unfortunately, it tasted like a cross between tiramisu and weird cheesecake.  Pretty disappointed with the outcome.

Hmmm, I think either I left something out or the author left something out.  It diffently lacked some additional sweetness.  And I have tried many variations of Tiramisu.  Two bites and it was all in the trash.

This is an excellent recipe.  I double it (I figure its light, and ok to double:)) By doubling it, the serving is more grand.  Very very easy to make.

This was excellent.  I made it for my father's birthday, and everyone loved it.  It works well if you make it in a square casserole dish because you won't have to worry about plastic wrap touching the tiramisu while it chills.

excellent recipe.  I love the fact that it doesn't have raw eggs in it.  My husband considers himself a tiramisu conneisseur and thinks this recipe is great.  I added some grated semisweet chocolate to the cocoa powder but otherwise pretty much stuck to the recipe directions.  It tastes the best after it is in the refrigerator overnight and we have found it is hard to wait those hours before having a taste!  Thank you for the recipe!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit.  Everyone loved it, and no one knew it was light.  I opted to make tiramisu because I was sure there would plenty of traditional desserts already at my cousin's house.  The changes I made were that I doubled the recipe to make enough for all 22 guests and I used the entire 8 oz tub of the mascarapone cheese.  I also used espresso instead of the regular brewed coffee to give it a more distinctive flavor.  Do not substitute the Kahlua with rum, the kahlua gives it a much nicer and smoother flavor then rum.  I would make this again, probably soon!!

I expected this to be a challenge, but it was really easy.  More importantly, it was delicious! THis is a great dessert for those (like me) who always seem to mess up baking. I left out the Kahlua and it was still very good.

This was to die for! It was so easy as well. I am no cook, but this tasted like I bought it from a speciality store. My hubby loved it!!!

I have fixed this for numerous occasions and all who enjoy Tiramisu have found this to be a wonderful version of it. Try it - you just might find you love it!!

Great recipe for those of us who love tiramisu but don't want to go to alot of trouble and make the REAL recipe. Next time I'll add more cheese.  Experiment with your dipping to get it just right.

This was an okay dessert. I love tiramisu but this came out unlike any I've had before. It was quite soggy and the 'cheese' taste was strong. Be very careful to only soak the lady fingers for a second - otherwise you'll have mush.

This had a really rich flavor:  hard to believe it is low in calories!  In the future, though, I will make double the cheese mixture as it was not near enough to fill up my pan.

This is a wonderful recipe.  Be careful not to soak the ladyfingers too much.  Than it will be too soggy.  Taste just like a restaurant tirimisu...you won't miss the extra fat or calories.

This recipe was ok; it wasn't that great but people did seem to like it.  I used a lot more Kahlua than the recipe suggested.  Also, dip the ladyfingers in the coffee mixture longer so it can soak up more of it- if you don't, the cake tends to be a little harder than the conventional tiramisu.

Very yummy. I didn't dunk entire lady finger in coffee mixture though.

I love this recipe and have been making it for quite a while.  Mascarpone cheese is very important and gives it extra creaminess.  I have also made this without alcohol for those that can't tolerate it, and it tastes just as good!

This recipe is incredibly easy to make and tastes very authentic.  I especially like it for being a "no egg" recipe.  Definitely make it the day before since the flavors intensify over time.  It was a great hit at my party this past weekend.

I had this at a Christmas party and it was wonderful!  I didn't even know it was light until I asked for the recipe.
