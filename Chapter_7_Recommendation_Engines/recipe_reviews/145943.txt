This is an excellent and healthy meal. I served it with sweet potato fries.  I stayed true to the recipe, only adding sliced red pepper and some red onion rings to the vegetable medley.  For preparation,when the vegetables are close to being finished,  it is easier to put the mushroom bottom side down on the bun, top with the veggies, and then top with the blue cheese. I then put the sandwiches under a high broiler until the cheese browned a bit.  I then topped the sandwiches with the top of the bun.  Delicious and healthy idea!

These burgers came out really delicious.  I marinated them in the dressing for about 3 hours and after grilling all the veggies were very juicy.  The portabella was nice and tender while the rest of the veggies added a nice crunch.  I put the mushroom cap face-up on the bottom, then added the blue cheese crumbles to that (they stay in the burger a little easier that way) and then piled the rest on top.  I also used about 3/4 of a bottle of lite balsamic vinaigrette, which cuts down on the calories and you can't taste the difference.  Delicious, healthy, and very easy!

This one is a regular meal at our house now.  I often make my own balsamic dressing, mix & match veggies including onion and bell pepper, and use different cheeses at times.  Yummy!

Wow wow wow. This was amazing! We didn't have bread of any kind so we just ate them breadless. Used goat cheese instead of bleu. Used broiler instead of grill. Added some fresh red bell pepper for some crunch and zest. The flavors and textures were... just wow. One of the best meals I've had in months.

This was delicious, even though I forgot the blue cheese. Great combo of veggies! I used homemade balsamic vinaigrette, and I didn't have time to marinate, but they still had plenty of flavor. Also, since it's too cold to grill, I roasted the veggies in the oven at 425. Because my buns were way too small for the huge portobellos I had, I used sprouted-grain bagels, which aren't as dense as regular bagels but are thicker than buns and held up well to the juicy veggies. I'm making again this week--and this time I'll remember the blue cheese!

I haven't tried this yet but noticed that the squash in the picture is summer not winter---big difference in moisture content.

This was alright, but I wouldn't call it spectacular.  I wasn't a huge fan of the bleu cheese...maybe it would be better with something else?  I will try it again though, just to be sure!

Excellent, but too big to handle and had some vegetables that we're not fond of.  I used the process with grilled onions, red pepper and onions instead.  My husband was drooling.  Paired it with Tomato Gorgonzola Soup for a veggie nite meal.

This was just boring. We had to spice it up with quite a bit more bleu cheese and some dijon mustard.  I think a more complex marinade would have helped a lot.

Delicious! I might have enjoyed this better than a regular burger.

This was pretty good.  I thought the flavors blended together well.  Not the best thing reheated, so eat it all the night you make it!  :)
