I live in Sweden and this recipie is exactly like the one I use to make Jansson's Delight,, it is wonderful!  The only difference is that I add the anchovies (packed in water from a tin) in layers, rather than at the bottom.  I prefer your method better than mine.

Truly Excellent!!!  One of the best potato dishes we've ever eaten.  I used red onion for added depth and since I made it for two I had to adjust the amounts a bit (different than if you use the provided scaling calculator).  2 medium potatoes sliced 1/4", 1/2 Cup Heavy Cream, 2 Oz Butter and 1/4 bread crumbs (I'll increase the butter/bread crumbs next time, they really added to the dish) and I'd also bake 5 minutes longer (50 Minutes).  This is top notch.

My gosh these are GOOD!  I'm not a big anchovy fan, but you don't really taste the anchovies.  They do, however, add a fabulous flavor.  I used "regular" anchovies, half and half instead of heavy cream, and increased the topping a bit.  We just LOVED these!  Just a delicious potato dish!

You should brown the onions in butter before adding them to the Jansson, this makes the Jansson "richer" in flavour.
As a Swedish cook this is the real way to do it...

IKEA sells Swedish anchovies. They're in the refrigerator section of the food market and they come in tins (but need to be kept refrigerated). While these are actually pratt fillets, what is important is the brine they lay in, which is spiced with cloves, ginger and other spices which bring the authentic flavor to this dish. I make Janssons Frestelse throughout the cold season every year, serve it to guests and bring it to potlucks and it is always very popular. Do not fear the anchovies! I always include the brine and usually use two tins. When I make this just for my family I sometimes throw whole tilapia fillets in the bottom of the baking dish and make it more of a balanced meal than a side dish. Lastly, I always use white pepper to season.

Thank you for this wonderful, easy recipe.  I used red potatoes, came out great.  I wasn't sure how to cut the potatoes, I think best would be thin slices, like you'd use for scalloped.

I, too, was happily surprised at what an effect the anchovies had--AND without being detected by my anchovy-hating other half!  I made one change to keep from going to the store--I substituted a tube of anchovy paste for the anchovies.  I think the quantity of the tube may have been a bit small in comparison the "fourteen" anchovies called for, so I either won't do that again, or I will use TWO tubes.    In spite of my faux pas, I am still SO impressed by this dish, and will make it again!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was really easy and yum. I used normal anchovies, ( I soaked them in milk for a few hours before using them,and drained). I used both red and white onions ( thats what I had ) and I cut the potatoes into strips. I had to use a little more cream ( I think my potatoes were quite big) and I baked it earlier - took a little longer than 45 mins. and then reheated it close to serving. Will make again.....

Tasty enough, as scalloped potatoes go.  My potluck diners were surprised to learn about the anchovies.

I've always heard that anchovies lose the fishy taste when cooked in a recipe like this one but there was a slightly fishy taste.  I used half and half instead of the heavy cream.  It was just ok, probably won't make again...

The anchovies gave an unwanted fishy taste. I would not include them again. Recipe would be better with just cheese, garlic, salt, and additional cream or half and half. I did like the innovative idea of placing the raw onions on the bottom layer so they cooked fully without needing to be sauteed. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

So my husband and I are NOT fish people, but we live in TN so it is not like we get the freshest fish. I thought I could sneak in some omega-3's in and not be able to taste the fish with this dish. I bought the best jarred anchovies the store had, but the dish was FISHY.

This is good. I used 1/2 and 1/2 but I added some butter to make up some of the difference of it and heavy cream.  I used some anchovy paste squirted on top of the onions. probably about 1/2 a tube for 1/2 the recipe

I Tried this recipe at the Swedish Society Julmiddag (Christmas dinner) and was told it was a holiday MUST on any Swedish Christmas dinner.  It was delicious!  So I am bringing it when I go to my non-Swedish Canadian family dinner! I hate to think how many calories that whipping cream adds to the menu though.

So easy and delicious! I rearranged the order of ingredients, placing the potatoes on the bottom, followed by sliced onions, garlic salt and pepper,  and chopped ham (instead of the anhovies); then I did a second layer and poured the cream over and topped it with the bread crumbs and butter. Will definitely make again.

My Swedish husband requested this so I used this recipe. He said it was perfect, just like they make it in Sweden! I omitted the anchovies because he hates them but I am determined to try the recipe with anchovies and see whether or not he notices, haha!

I could detect the fishiness and the gray color was not appealing.  I used a whole tube of anchovy paste which I think was the equivalent of 3 Tablespoons and I halved the recipe. It might have been better with only 1 Tablespoon, or just some salt. I ate it but if I make it again, I will not include anchovy paste. It also took 15 minutes longer to cook than the recipe called for.
