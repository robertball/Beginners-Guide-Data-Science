First of all, there is NO reason to cook this for 2 hours!!!  In fact, I think the beef was LESS salty because I didn't cook it for so long.  DON'T ADD THE SALT.  It's just not necessary... and I am a certified saltaholic!  I'm not sure that this recipe really needs the Worcestershire, or maybe just not as much. I also added a bayleaf and used fresh garlic (and plenty of it).  Instead of diluting the gravy mix with a full cup of water, I only used half a cup and I also blended in a tablespoon of cornstarch with the gravy mix before adding it to the beef.  I wouldn't use flour.  I'd stick with cornstarch.  Flour should actually be fully cooked or it can taste too, well, floury.  Cornstarch can safely be added just before serving.  I served this over mashed pototates.  It was good.

My meat&potatoes husband couldn't get enough.  However - I did make some adjustments.  Coated beef w/ flour, then sauteed.. added 2 Tbsp minced garlic w/ the onions instead of garlic powder.  1.75 cup beef broth, 1/4c red wine.  Did not add any salt or pepper.  Simmered 1 hour.  Then added the brown gravy directly to the beef (no extra liquid!) and simmered an additional 30 minutes while I made mashed potatoes to put it over.  It ended up DELICIOUS!  A tad bit salty, but we like salt.  Use some Pillsbury Grands to sop up the extra sauce and it was perfection.  Follow these steps and you will avoid the problems that keep coming up - overly salty (no salt, low sodium soy), too runny (no extra water at end), meat too tough (1.5hrs, at the most!).

My husband asks for this all the time. I like to use fresh mushrooms and garlic instead of canned mushrooms and garlic powder. I just saute the mushrooms, garlic and onions with a little butter and olive oil before I add the meat to the pan. Using fresh mushrooms and garlic really makes a big difference.  I also like to use only 3/4 cup of water and I add 1/4 cup red wine.  About 15 minutes before I add the gravy mixture, I like to add about 1 cup of frozen peas to the beef tips.  At the end when I add in the gravy mixture I usually use a little less than one cup of water and add some flour or cornstarch to thicken it up a little more.  This is great served over egg noodles or rice.

Food For Thought: It is very fustrating when you look up a recipe and find reviews on how everyone has modified the recipe and given the review based on modifications. If you modify the recipe post it as a new recipe, as your own recipe not as a review of what's been written. I will try this today n post an accurate rating based on the original recipe.

This recipe was delicious. I too cooked it in the crockpot. I only filled it with water till the 2lbs of stew meet was covered, I omitted the salt, put in 1/2 a large white onion, and the 1/4 c. worscheshire and low sodium soy sauce. It smelled great cooking day. Right before we ate it I added just the brown gravy pack with no water and it thickend up quite nicely. The was a great meal. My husband is asking for seconds.

The only part that I changed about this recipe when I made it the first time was, after an hour and a half simmer, the gravy wasn't looking like it would be thick enough. So at that point I mixed 1/3 cup of flour with 1/2 cup of milk,  shaken in an airtight container to get the lumps out. Then stir it into the pan. It made the gravy the perfect consistency for pouring over rice. You may want it a little thinner with noodles, but it won't work as the recipe describes. Doing this will also cut back on the "too salty" taste other reviewers spoke of. I didn't cut back on salt at all and it was perfect. Actually it was nice not to see my husband salt his food for once.  We really love this dish and will eat it often! Thanks so much for posting it.

This recipe comes out much better if you throw everything in a crock pot and let it simmer all day. The meat is so tender!

Very, very good! My boyfriend did everything but lick his plate clean! I omitted the salt and it was still bordering on too salty... next time I will use reduced sodium soy sauce. Served it over No Yolks noodles, with flaky biscuits and Garlic Green Beans (from this site). Yum!

SOOOOO tender, just don't overcook; 90 min is plenty. EASILY 5 stars with minimal modifications! Coat beef with flour & pepper before browning, don't add any salt. Simmer for 1 hour on low/med, then add gravy packet & 2 tbsp corn starch. Simmer additional 30 min, remove from heat. Served over instant mashed potatoes, but egg noodles would be great, too! THIS WAS SO EASY! Too easy to taste this good! It was a hit with my boyfriend & he's hard to impress. THIS IS GREAT THE NEXT DAY, TOO!

I have been on All recipes.com for several months now and have made my family of five recipes from this site almost every night,  but this one was the first one I am writing a review on...It was that good!  I didn't change a thing.  Everyone loved it!  I believe the reason the recipe calls for the meat to cook for 2 hours is to tenderize it.  You can buy inexpensive bottom round stew meat (rather than top round) and by cooking it for several hours, the meat definitely is alot more tender than if it had cooked for a shorter period.  I served it over egg noodles and added some baby peas.  The meat was so tender it melted in our mouths!  This is one recipe I will make again and again.

Good base recipe, but way too salty. I floured the stew meat before browning, I used 2 cloves of fresh garlic instead of powder, low sodium beef broth instead of water, half of the low sodium soy sauce, and no water with the gravy packet (maybe that's why it was so salty?). The sauce was nice and thick. Next time I will add in fresh mushrooms, maybe 1/2 cup of red wine - and I will leave out the soy sauce altogether. I don't really care for the taste of it anyway.

I just tried this today, and benefited from comments of several others. Thanks!  I added 2 garlic cloves (pressed) to the onion to brown, and used only 1/2 and onion.  I actually used sirloin steak and cut it into bite sized pieces.  I tossed the in flour before browning. After browning I added the 2 c. water, plus 1/4 red wine.  Used only 2 Tbs. each of Worchestershire and low sodium soy sauce and 1/2 Tbs. of brown gravy powder.  After it all simmered awhile I added 1 c. of beef broth and sprinkled a little pepper in it.  I only simmered it for an hour all together.  It was extremely tender, not salty, very flavorful and we all loved it!  This [altered] recipe will be a keeper!

This was pretty good.I omitted the salt and used low sodium soy sauce and a packet of low sodium brown gravy mix. It was just right not salty at all.

This is a great crock pot recipe!  I tweaked it just a little(did not need the oil because I used my crock pot).  This cooked for about 2 to 3 hours and the smell was wonderful.  I used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder, I wanted a thicker gravy so about 20 minutes before I served it I took about a cup of the liquid from the pot and stirred in about 2 tablespoons of Argo corn starch until lumps were gone.  Then poured the mixture back into the pot.  This thickened the broth into a fantastic gravy which was perfect on white rice.  I promise you this is delicious!  Served with french bread and a tossed salad.  This one is definitely a keeper and I will make it again.

Contrary to many negative reviews of this recipe, it was actually good.  I made this last night for my wife, daughter and her two kids and they enjoyed it. I consider my wife an expert at cooking and she gave it rave reviews.  Based on other suggestions I did eliminate the salt and used beef broth instead of 2 cups of water and cut the soy sauce and worchestershire in half and I did need to thicken it up at the end.  I served it with veggies and mashed potatoes and it turned out GREAT! I normally give my wife a break and cook twice a week and this recipe is definitely in my rotation. Thanks for a tasty recipe. :)

I used low sodium soy sauce and had no trouble with the salt also only added 1/2 cup COOL water at the end with the gravy mix. This is important if you want it to thicken nicely. Also added some mushrooms and cooked it in the crockpot after pan searing the meat. Excellent dish. Thanks.

My family loved this. My 6 year old son had THIRDS and ate all of his veggies to get a second helping. I added some sliced mushrooms and replaced the garlic powder with minced garlic. I cooked this for 1.5 hours and the meat was perfectly tender. My husband makes homemade egg noodles, so we added those at the end. I did not add the salt based on other reviews and thought that the level of salt was perfect. No need to add, but not overly salty, either. Because we added the noodles to the dish, we did add the full 1 cup of water with the gravy mix and the thickness of the gravy was perfect. The noodles soaked up some of the liquid and the flour thickened the gravy without needing to add any additional corn starch or flour. I'm pretty sure there will be a mutiny at my house if I do NOT make this again!

My family and I loved this dish!  I cooked it in my crockpot, it was so easy! I followed another reviewers notes, covered meat with water, cooked it 4 hours. I added 2 dashes of hot sauce and 1 tbl. Italian seasoning. I added gravey mix (no extra water) about 20 mins before serving. This is diffently a KEEPER.

A good base recipe.  I modified this quite a bit.  I sauteed an onion with 2 cloves fresh chopped garlic.  Then dusted beef with flour and browned.  Added 1/4 cup of red wine.  Added 2 cups of water, 2 cloves smashed garlic, 5 or 6 splashes of worcestershire,  3 splashes of low sodium soy, 1/2 Knorrs homestyle beef stock, Lots of fresh cracked pepper,  some dried thyme, 2 bay leaves, dried rosemary, reduced heat and simmered for 1 hour.  Then added diced green pepper, and a touch of salt.  Simmered 30 min.  Served with white rice.  Fantastic.

This recipe is five stars, after a little modification.  First, I don't even add the salt and I use low sodium soy sauce.  The first time I made it, it was so salty it made our lips pucker!  But, after I made it with way less salt it was fabulous and the beef was so tender.  I either serve with egg noodles or garlic mashed potatoes. Thanks, for a great, easy meal!

I threw it all in the crock pot except the onions and the cup of water that went with the gravy. Cooked it for six hours. I did have to thicken it up with some cornstarch and water. Served over mashed potatoes. Super good!

This was really good. I threw everything in the crockpot with the exception of the oil, salt and last cup of water. I  waited until about 30minutes before dinner and threw the brown gravy packet in with a tiny bit of flour. It thickened up very nice. It cooked for around 10-11 hours and wasn't salty at all. We served it over mashed taters and the hubby and I were fighting for the leftovers. I think it would be a great start to a shepards pie!! Thanks for the recipe

I didn't add the additional salt and this was still salty.  Next time I will use low sodium soy and worcestershire.  Besides that it had a great flavor and was really easy to make.  I will give this another go.

I made this tonight and it's a it.  I had to convert it to gluten free in order to eat it.  Here's what I did:  eliminated the packet of gravy mix as it's not gf.  Tossed the beef with gluten free flour seasoned with garlic pepper.  Also used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  I served it with some gluten free pasta and it's absolutely delicioius!

Awesome recipe.  I throw all of the ingredients in the crockpot and cook it for the day.  Then I shake some milk and flour in a bowl with a lid and add it at the end to thicken it.  No need to brown the meat either.  Just throw everything in the crockpot set it and forget it!!

I've made this recipe several times now, tweaking it along the way. The first time I had the same problem as other reviewers, it was wayyy too salty, I almost couldn't eat it. Now when I make it I decrease the soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce a bit, and leave out the 1 tsp salt. The dish still has great flavor but isn't pucker your lips salty.

Overall good recipe but it did turn out quite salty!  Next time I won't add as much salt..cutting it back to maybe 1/2 of what is called for here.  Otherwise, the flavor was good and the meat was very tender.  Trying it again tonight w/ less salt!

Very tasty.  I cut the soy sauce in half, added fresh mushrooms and substituted fresh garlic for garlic powder (personal preference). Definitely let the beef simmer as recipe states so it will be tender.  This recipe is often requested in my house.  Delicious!

My husband liked this a lot. It went well over mashed potatos, but would go well with rice or noodles. I changed a couple things just for my personal taste. I added mushrooms and used real garlic and I didn't use as much onion because my husband is not a huge fan of them. I also didn't use as much water because I like my gravy thicker. I will make this again!

My husband loves beef tips over egg noodles so I thought I would try this. I used reduced sodium soy sauce and brown gravy mix. It was very good but I will leave the salt out next time and cook it just an hour. Going to make a batch to keep some available in the freezer. Thanks!

This was pretty good.  I omitted the salt and used low sodium soy sauce.  I put everything in the crock pot and cooked on low for 8 hours.  If I use the crock pot again I will definitely reduce the amount of water/liquid significantly.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, denisef!

I cooked just as the recipe specified and it wasn't too salty. I usually dont add much salt but this time I did and I'm glad! It was DELICIOUS! My husband loved it too. I cooked with rice and steamed carrots. I did double the gravy amount because we love some gravy!!

This was beyond good!! It was salty, but we ate it anyway, had it with garlic crescent rolls, and used them to clean our plates.  Mine was nice and thick after adding the gravy packet, I did not add any extra water to it.  Definitely a keeper!

I've made this recipe several times for my family and it's been a hit every time.  I haven't altered the recipe one whit and it comes out perfect.  Although I will say, I do withhold the tsp of salt until the end, because some gravy mixes are saltier than others.  I do like to add mushrooms to it, fresh if I've got them, canned if I don't.  I don't have a problem with the cook time of two hours, since it really seems to make the beef become fork tender.  This recipe makes plenty for a family of four, with leftovers when combined with egg noodles.

Some of the most flavorful and tender meat we have eaten in a long time.  I followed the directions and served this over egg noodles.  This was a popular dinner....no leftovers.  This would be just as excellent over rice or mashed potatoes.

first off, dont use water and gravy mix; use beef stock.  secondly, once seared, you dont need to cook it for that long.  once you've added the liquid, cook it for about 15 minutes, covered.  make a paste using equal parts of cornstarch and cold water; add a little of this at a time to the beef and stir, until desired thickness. if it's too thin, add more of the cornstarch paste till desired thickness, bring to a boil.

i also added a pinch of cayenne, fresh garlic instead of garlic powder, and one bay leaf.

serve over rice. 

the basic recipe is good, it just needs touching up.

My children LOVED this.  I did think it was a bit salty, and I used a low sodium gravy mix  and soy sauce and had eliminated the salt called for, too.  It was a good cold winter day meal and I would make it  again, but I will also look for another similar recipe that may be less salty tasting.

This is supper good!!
BUT.....It is salty and I didn't even add the salt that was called for, since it called for so much soy sauce. I will be making this again for sure! But with out the salt and half the soy. And I didn't have gravy mix, so I just used 2 table spoons of corn starch with beef base and some water in a jar. Shake it up really good than just added to you meat.

I've made this recipe many, many times and it's always a huge hit.  I do different variations...sometimes with sliced mushrooms, sometimes with red wine, sometimes thickened into a gravy.  I've always served over noodles but tried rice last time and love that too.  The leftovers are excellent.  I've also made a double batch and frozen it with good results.

I laughed when I read these reviews because my husband also LOVED this recipe.  I thought it was pretty darn good myself but throughout our meal my husband wouldn't stop raving about how good it was and how he would like this once a week.  I guess beef tips are the way to a man's heart!  On another note, I did throw a splash of red wine into the mix therefore having to add a little extra brown gravy mix as the one package was just a tad bit runny (totally my doing!)Overall, YUMMY and most important EASY!  Thanks for the fabulous recipe!

I generally like salty foods, so even though I read the warnings and decided to leave out the salt in this recipe, I still found the salt content to be quite strong.  I will make this again, but will try the reduced salt soy sauce as well.  Otherwise, the meat was very tender and my husband thought it was great regardless.  Thanks.

Came out great! I heeded the advice of others and cut out the additional salt, and I always use low-sodium soy sauce anyway. I have found the key to the best flavor is to simmer it at a higher temperature (I set it between low and medium,) keeping it lightly boiling. The meat becomes delightfully tender and the sauce reduces to a rich and slightly spicy perfection. Also I let it continue to simmer for about 20-30 minutes after I add the gravy mix, before bringing it up to a rolling boil so it can thicken. Hope this helps somebody! We LOVE this recipe!

First of all, I made two changes to this recipe.  I omitted the onion and used a roast cut into large chunks.

I thought that this was a pretty good dinner.  The gravy was the perfect thinkness.  As long as you reduce the liquid properly before adding the additional water/gravy mix, you will get a good result.

I did not find this dish too salty, but my husband did. A really good trick for getting rid of an overly salty taste it to add a cut potato (I used half of a potato cut into two pieces) to the pot.  The potato will absorb a lot of the salty flavour and not change the overall taste of the dish.

I would make this again using a low sodium soy sauce.  Like I said, even though I was able to cut the saltiness by using the potato trick, my husband still found it a bit salty.  Overall, this was a good dish that was very easy to prepare.

I made this as directed .  The meat was tender after 1 1/4 hrs of cooking .  However , when adding the packet of gravy and water , I cooked it for 10 mins . more , and it did not thicken to my liking .  Had to add a slurry of cornstarch and water , and cook 10 more mins.  The sauce was too salty , and had too much pepper .  If I were to make again , it would be with a lot of tweaking .  Sorry .

This dish is FANTASTIC!!!  Even my picky kids loved it!  The only change I made was cutting some of the soy sauce!  It was a little salty the first time I made it but the second time I cut the soy sauce in half and it was perfect!

This is one of our favorite recipes. I do change it up a little bit though. We use 1/2 cup of water, and 1 cup of red wine. Everything else we leave the same (but we omit the onions, no one in the family likes them) and it comes out perfect every time. We put it over mashed potatoes and even the baby will eat it!

This was amazing! My father said it was the best meal I have ever cooked. I followed many other users suggestions.
First I sauteed portobella mushrooms with the onions. I subsituted beef broth for the 2 cups water and added 1/4 cup red wine to the liquid mixture. I also used fresh garlic rather than powedered and NO SALT! This recipe doesn't need any salt with the amount from everything else. I cooked everything for 50 minutes then added frozen peas. I waited 10 minutes than added the gravy mixture for another 30 minutes uncovered.
This is a must cook dish! Definitely will make it again.

Instant family favorite!  I have made this several times and it's always a big hit.  We serve it over homemade mashed potatoes with hot buttered rolls. The only thing I alter is to use reduced-sodium soy sauce AND reduced-sodium Brown Gravy mix.  And I omit the salt called for in the recipe.  Otherwise its just too salty.  I do use 2 packets of gravy with 1+1/2 c water.  Turns out perfect every time.

This was an okay meal. I served it over rice, as I have done in the past. I used low sodium gravy mix and low sodium soy sauce (plus I left out the salt) and I still felt like it was pretty salty. But it was edible and my husband really enjoyed it. He loves Worcestershire sauce and I am not a  big fan of it, so I think that is where my taste buds let me down. As for the texture and simplicity, 4 star. I put the whole 1/4 cup Worcestershire and next time, I will use half of that.

This is a very good recipe which is easy to change to your own tastes. At the suggestion of a few other reviews, I drugged the meat in flour before browning it to add a little girth to the sauce.  I also only used half the soy sauce, half the Worcestershire sauce and no extra salt.  I did use the gravy packet as the thickening agent in the end.

The meat was quite tender, and really had a nice flavor. We ate it over white rice, and LOVED it. The only thing I would change next time is maybe add only half the pepper, because like someone else's children, I thought it was a bit "spicy" for me.

My husband loves Beef Tips but he doesnt like my Beef Tips...I have been on the look out now for a really, really good Beef Tip recipe.  I found it!  This recipe was wonderful. Hubby loved it and so did my son.  It was very tender and just YUMMY.  One thing I would change is the salt content.  Next time I am going to cut that by half.  Thanks for sharing this recipe---its definately a keeper.

So delicious and tender! I didn't have a problem with too much salt, and I cooked it for the full time! Next time I will probably add some mushrooms while it's simmering and serve over mashed potatoes.

I'm giving this 5 stars because this gave me another real easy recipe to add to my box, and it tasted great. I used one cup water and one cup beef broth, onion, fresh garlic, the soy sauce and 1/8t pepper with the meat, then thickened it with cornstarch. I cut the meat in relatively small chunks, so it doesn't take that long to cook. The meat was extremely tender, and it had plenty of taste. Honestly, if I had added the worchestershire, and the added salt, I don't think we would have been able to eat it. This was delicious over rice.

I used my slow cooker to simmer the meat and it turned out nicely.  For all those who said it's too salty, just omit the salt and use low-sodium soy sauce.  That's what I did and it was perfect.  Simple, but tastes great.  Everyone likes it!

I coated the meat in flour than added all the ingredients except for the brown gravy mix in the crock-pot cooked on low all day, I added the gravy mix and a little cornstarch turned crockpot to high and let it thicken while I made mashed potatoes to serve with it. The meat was very tender and even the picky eaters enjoyed it.

Wow wow wow! This recipe was delicious. I was a little leary of trying this, as most beef recipes end up very tough and chewy. Not this one! I followed the recipe to the letter. I seemed to have A LOT of sauce, though. I couldn't get it to thicken. Next time I will omit a cup of water (or maybe even more). I would have rated this 5 stars if not for the thin sauce. However, it did have a wonderful slightly-spicy taste. I added some sauteed mushrooms to my plate, and served with herbed mashed potatoes and a veggie. The meat was so very tender, I could cut it with my fork. I did notice a salty taste as well, and I would probably omit the extra salt next time too. I was VERY impressed with how this turned out, and it was so easy! I will definately be making it again.

Whoa!!!!!!!!!! This dish was way too salty, and this is a salt-a-holic talking!! I guess the only way to reduce this would be to use low sodium soy sauce and omit the additional salt.

This was a delicious meal and my 4 year old loved it.  I did take the advice of others and did reduce the soya sauce and omitted the salt. I also used roasted garlic instead of garlic powder. The meat turned out tender and the sauce was thick and rich.  A definate keeper.

This was really good. My picky husband even liked it and he hates it when I try new recipes on him.  We both felt this needed a little something more flavor wise and the sause could stand to have been a bit thicker, so I'm going to play around with a little next time I make it, but it's definitely a keeper.  I made this in my crock pot following the directions of some of the other reviewers, cut back on the soy sauce (low sodium variety) but kept the Worcestershire sauce at recommended amount since dh loves the stuff.

The Worchestershire and Soy made this WAY too salty and WAY too sweet! Next time I will only add 1/8 cup of both sauces...and will probably add another packet of the gravy...because I like it thicker!!! :)
But overall I liked it...

I read the reviews before I made this and eliminated the salt and used low sodium soy sauce.
My husband and I loved the flavor, but it was way too peppery for the kids.  I'll make it again and use less pepper.  Very easy and the meat was as tender as the reviews said.

Here Is what I did:
I coated the beef with flour and browned in a Dutch oven. I saute'd the onions in a separate pan while the beef was browning. I added the onions to the beef when the meat was browned and stirred.  I poured 2 cups of water along with the 1/4 soy (low sodium) and 1/4 Worcestershire and 1 Tbl spoon of minced garlic to pot. I put about 15 turns of fresh pepper from a grinder into the pot. Brought it to a boil then simmer for 1 hour. I DID NOT ADD ANY SALT. I can see how regular soy could make this salty so use low sodium soy.
While simmering I took the beef gravy packet with 1 cup of water and 1 Tbl spoon of  corn starch I and put into a jar with a lid and shook up. 
I boiled the noodles (I used Amish egg noodles) as directed while the meat mix was simmering.
After 1 hour I poured the gravy mix into the meat mixture and stirred and simmered for an additional 20 -30 minutes.
When the noodles were done I added them to the meat mixture and stirred well and served.
The meat was amazingly tender and the sauce was rich and thick. This turned out AWESOME. THIS WILL GO ON MY FAVORITES LIST.

Delicious.  Hubs and I both give it 5 stars.  Made it with round steak.

Didn't have gravy mix, but used Simple Beef Flavored Gravy recipe from this site with 2 tsp of  beef "Better Than Bouillon" plus 1/2 cup of cabernet for part of the required water.  Also added a can of mushrooms.

Can't wait for the leftovers at lunch.  YUM!  This goes into the rotation.
----------------
Used this tonight for the meat base for a beef pot pie.  Yummy!

This was SO good!  I know a recipe is great when my picky husband says it is and that I should make it on a regular basis.  I did make a couple changes.  I added more pepper than called for (actually by mistake), but it was really good.  I did not add the 1 tsp salt it asked for.  I added a little less Worchestershire than asked for.  Served it with garlic butter green beans and it was wonderful!

Well, I guess I'll add MY 2 cents to the 457 reviews... LOL 
So many said it was too salty that I used low sodium soy sauce, low sodium gravy mix, and omitted the salt. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  My cut of meat was "steak tips" which was all they had at the store that day, and were long pieces that I cut up.    I do want to note that it took almost the entire 2 hours to become fork-tender.  Other reviewers indicate that their meat was tender after an hour or an hour and a half. It really depends on the meat, so have patience if yours is taking a little longer. All of a sudden it will just be really tender!!!  Also, because of all the low-sodium things I used, I actually had to ADD a little salt at the end!!!!  But that is better than having it be too salty.   Anyway, end result is 5+ stars and a great big thank you for this yummy recipe.

Our dinner was just great. We used beef tips. Tender and succulent. Robust flavor. We followed the recipe mostly, but I prefer seasoned not salty and avoid gravy packets. After following the wise advice of other reviewers,I sauteed garlic with the onions rather than using garlic powder. Andsubstitited beef broth and a 1/4 of red wine for the 2 C water. I simmered for 1 hour, then rather then adding the gravy packt I used 1/2 C. water and 1 Tbs cornstarch. 
(On the side we sauteed mushrooms for the top) Yum!

Very good! I omit the extra salt (the soy sauce has plenty) and I saute the onion with fresh garlic. I also didn't cook it as long - an hour seemed fine. Plus, we were hungry. :)

This dish has became a regular request at my house....my kids who are picky eaters all of them like this, it does come out a little salty so maybe cut out the salt as the other ingredients have plenty of salt.  This is very good served over mashed potatoes or noodles.

A delightfully basic, yet delicious recipe. I omitted the extra salt (figuring correctly that there would be plenty in the soy and worc sauce) and instead of the dry gravy mix, I simply added 3T cornstarch in a slurry with about an ounce of water. Thickened beautifully and tasted great.

Very good recipe. Didnt add the extra salt due to the soy sauce and worcestershire sauce already being so salty. The sauce was way too thin, so I added 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, and an extra dry pack of gravy mix to thicken it up, otherwise it would have been like a soup! Turned out very good. I also seasoned my beef tips and marinated them in meat tenderizer 3-4 hours before cooking. Excellent!

This recipe is fantastic! I added a bit of corn starch to thicken it up some more, but I think that is the only change necessary. Growing up my mom always got the beef tips and gravy from schwans, and I think this recipe tastes just like theirs! i highly recommend it.

Very good recipe! Next time I'm going to add some sliced mushrooms to the mix.  Also, I only simmered this for about 30-40 minutes and it came out fine, but I think the meat would've been more tender if I had cooked it for the full 2 hours.

I changed a few things since I cook for only two.  I used a boneless sirloin tip steak (less than 1 lb) and sliced it.  I cooked sliced onions, fresh mushrooms, and minced garlic (from jar) together first in 1/2 the olive oil then set that aside while I sauteed the meat in additional oil which I had coated with some flour first.  After it was browned I added a little water at a time (about a cup) and it thickened up nicely.  I added the soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce before putting a lid on it and letting it simmer for about 1 hour.  I didn't use the dry gravy mix because I thought it was fine without it...just added a bit more water.  Served over noodles.  I added no salt to the recipe but added  a little garlic powder and pepper.

As written, I have to give this a three star, sorry.  A tsp. of pepper is just too much, that is all I could taste.  I used low sodium soy sauce and left out the additional tsp. salt, so I didn't think it was too salty as some have said.  I do like the flavor of soy sauce and Worcestershire and will make again with much less pepper.

Very good! The flavor is great! The only thing I would do is maybe double the sauce recipe. We love our noodles saucy! I did not have the onion soup mix, so I used minced onion and some ground beef bouillon.Turned out great! I will make again. Thanks for sharing!

Pretty good but I found the soy sauce to be very overwhelming for the dish. I think I might replace it with beef broth next time. It was very salty for me and my husband and I even left out the salt it called for.

My Family loves this recipe, even the fussy ones.  They beg me to make it.  It is on the salty side, so omitting the salt is a good idea and using low sodium Soy Sauce will also help.  I also just add the gravy mix to the whole pot rather than mixing with more water and it comes out with a great consistency.  Meat is always tender.  Thanks denisef.

We eliminated the extra salt and used a lower sodium soy sauce. It was an absolute family hit!

This recipe is simple and very delicious. The only thing i did differently was omitted the soy sauce and cut back on the salt. I also reduced the cooking time to 90 minutes from start to finish. My hubby loves it!

it was good.. didn't add the salt but after cooking for awhile there was no need for salt. I noticed the sauce was not thick enough to coat the noodled so I had to thicken it up w/ cornstarch.. over all she is a keeper.

This would be 5 star...but if you make these...be forewarned....you better like the taste of salt.  Will make these again, but omit some of the soy sauce and the 1 teas. of salt altogether.  Also, had to thicken with cornstarch at the end, because the 1 package of gravy mixed in with water...well that just wasn't enough.  Otherwise, excellent taste.  JUST WAY WAY WAY TOOOOOO SALTY.

I made this pretty much exactly to recipe - omitting the last cup of water for the gravy addition. I thought the consistency of the sauce was good with this change. Oh, and I didn't add the salt. I thought it was still rather salty (even my husband commented) and even borderline peppery. My 2 year old ate it, and that is saying something. I would make this again, however I might try to cut back the salt even more next time. It was a good use of stew meat.

Husband loves Worcestershire but he thought this was far too strong.  May try halving it next time.  Increasing the gravy mix and adding sour cream helped cut it a little.

The flavor in this recipe is amazing. The meat tasted so good, but I had a hard time getting the consistency of gravy.  I will definitely make this again but make my gravy on the side and pour on top after it is on the plate.

This was a nice change from every day beef stew.  I did make a couple of changes tho.  I used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder, completely omitted the salt and instead of dry gravy mix I used one cup of water and a jar of quality brown gravy right from the beginning. Kept covered for first hour then removed lid for last half hour and it thickened nicely.  Next time I will definitely add sliced fresh mushrooms for the last half hour.

This was good.  I didn't add any salt and pepper (let everyone do it as preferred at the table) and didn't add all of the soy sauce based on previous reviews.  I cooked fresh garlic with the onion and dredged the meat with flour first but the rest of it followed the recipe as written.  It was way too runny - even with the flour!  Next time will add corn starch or something.  The flavor was delicious, though.  I served it with mashed potatoes but will use egg noodles next time.

I threw everything in the crockpot in the morning and let it cook all day- the meat was very tender.  I added no salt, and less soy and worcestershire because I wanted to add some golden mushroom soup and some fresh mushrooms.  I also stirred in some cream cheese at the end because I had a little I wanted to use up.  I guess I changed almost everything about it, but that only means that it's easy to adapt to your tastes!

Very good. The cubes I had were quite big so I halved or tripled nearly all of them so they would be bite sized. This turned out very good and the beef was quite tender. Thanks denisef for the post.

I have been looking for a beef tips recipe to replace the ready made beef tips I buy at the store.  This is the recipe. It is a keeper.  I made no changes to the ingredients in the recipe but I did shorten the cooking time.  My husband really enjoyed it.  He said they were better than the store bought.

I made this recipe a couple of weeks ago and my family is still raving about it. It was soooo good.  I substituted one cup of water with red wine and omitted the salt.  It was still salty, but not too much for us.  I served it with mashed potatoes.  The gravy is awesome.  I can't wait to make this again and again.

I had never made beef tips before.  Looked at a lot of recipes.  Made this for Christmas Day.  Family said it was good but not sure if they were just being polite or not.  I didn't think it was great but it was good.  I did make it as written except for the salt.  I might make it again if someone requested it, but wouldn't make it for myself again.  Thanks anyway.  Nice to try something new.

Oh my, yummy.  I did make two changes though.  Instead of 2 cups water, I used 1 cup water and one cup red wine.  Subbed fresh garlic for the powder. (4 cloves. Simmered it for 2 hours. I wasn't going to add the gravy packet b/c the juice was so flavorful but ended up adding it.  You couldn't tell it was a packet.  The juice overpowered the packet flavor which was great!  Will make again!  Yum!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is SO wonderful.  You really should not have to change anything to the recipe for a great meal but, I like to mix some cold water with cornstarch and add till my desired thickness to make it a little thicker. I have the curse of the picky eater family and even THEY loved it.  I make this often.  I have a wonderful buttered rice recipe that I make to go with it but sometimes serve it over egg noodles or mashed potatoes.  Thanks a bunch!

This was amazing! The beef came out fork-tender. The only thing I changed was to omit the last cup of water at the end and just added the powdered gravy directly to the pot and simmered for the last 20 minutes. It came out a nice consistancy. I served over rice with crusty rolls to dip in the gravy! I'll be making this one over and over!!!!

Relatively easy to make, but I followed the directions exactly and it was way too salty... next time I will omit the additional salt and cut down on the soy sauce.

This was really good!  I used a non-stick pan & Pam and cooked the beef.  I didn't use onions (added dried onions later).  And I added frozen peas.  I cooked it in the crockpot and then froze it and it turned out great.  Served over rice.

This was very easy to prepare and had a lot of flavor.  Unfortunately, it was also extremely salty and everyone commented on the saltiness.  I did not add the extra salt, based on other reviews and it was still too salty.  If I were to make this again, I would cut down on the soy sauce and the worchestershire sauce, or at the least use low sodium products. But this might be at the expense of the flavor.  I did have to add some cornstarch mixed with a little water to thicken it up some.

I made this for dinner the other night and it was an instant hit!!!!  I added diced onion and minced garlic to my meat as it cooked.  I then added all ingredients except gravy to crock pot with my meat mix and cooked on high for three hours.  I added gravy mix during last 30 minutes of cook time.  We loved it!!!

I made this tonight for dinner and made one minor adjustment based on other reviews.  Others said the sauce was too thin, so I dredged the beef in seasoned flour before tossing into the frying pan.  The end result was a nice thick gravy.  The reason this recipe got only 3 stars is because the flavour is pretty bland and could use something...I just don't know what.

Very good. As previous reviews suggested, I left out the teaspoon of salt. I used McCormick Brown Gravy mix and it seemed to be fine. We love pepper so the teaspoon was fine. I will definitely make this again!

I found this VERY VERY salty.  Next time perhaps I would choose a low-salt beef powder mix and a bit less Worchestershire.  Meat was really tender though.

This was delicious.  I only had 1 lb of meat so I halved the recipe with the exception of the onion and the gravy mixture.  I followed the advice of the other viewers and did not add the additional salt and added fresh garlic.  We ate this over rice and there was more than enough gravy. Thanks for a great recipe.

My first review ever.  If I could give this no stars I would.  I have never made a meal that we absolutly could NOT eat, until this one.  WAY WAY WAY too salty, and that was with even using the low sodium soy sauce.  The meat tasted like a really soft stick of beef jerky.  DISGUSTING!!!!!!!

Wonderful! The meat was very tender and the sauce had an amazing flavor even though it was a little too salty for my boyfriend and me. I'm not salt shy and neither is he, but to be honest the salt content was still a little too much even after I took the advice of the other reviewers and tried to lower it by using lower sodium soy sauce. I will definitely make this again but next time I will add no additonal salt, use low sodium soy sauce, and lower sodium dry brown gravy mix.  I also found that cutting the amount of pepper it calls for was good also, since otherwise it would have overpowered the flavor.

Although easy to prepare, this recipe isn't worth the time involved.  The flavor of the tips ends up being rather plain, and there is just too much "sauce" - which is actually more like just beef broth.  It definitely needs to be thickened more than the recipe directs.

I followed another raters advice and tried this one in the crock pot, and it came out absolutely wonderful! I omitted the salt, and added a little cornstarch to thicken it up ( I may have done something wrong becasue it was a little runny at first)  but it was gone the second it served it...the meat is soooo tender! I have never had stew meat i could cut with a fork! Yummy

My 5 year old otherwise known as Mr. Picky loved this, as did the rest of my family.
I thought a 1/4 cup of soy sauce might be too salty, but it was delicious. The broth is
excellent. I put in the slow cooker and added the gravy last. I will make my beef and 
and noodles this way from now on. Thanks for sharing your recipe Denise!. janette

So listen.. I've made this twice this month. This dish blesses my soul! The true definition of Soul Food. 

I made some minor changes: Before I started the fire I seasoned the meat (not in the instructions). I use a special seasoning I bought, I don't know whats in it.. but its delicious and put it on everything. Use seasonings that's contains little salt. Then coated the meat with flour (also not in instructions). I used a cast iron skillet, cut up and saute'd the onion as instructed. I also added some minced garlic to the saute for a minute or so before adding approx 2-3lbs of meat to the skillet (don't want the garlic to burn). Cook meat until brown or has a crust on it (approx 5-7 minutes, high heat). Added 1.5 cup of water, Soy Sauce and Worcestershire to taste (that means you actually have to do a taste test to know if it was enough). Cover and let cook for an hour and a half to hour and 45 minutes, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan frequently (important for gravy making purposes).  I also added a couple more dashes of that seasoning for good measure (optional.. if you really like a particular seasoning, go for it!). I did not add any more salt (the soy sauce is salty enough), garlic (i did that first) or pepper (my seasoning has a slight kick to it). Taste, taste, taste, taste. Do not cook anything without tasting it while its cooking! That way you know what its going to taste like before it hits your plate. Modify as needed.

There is no need to use/add grav

In this case, I'm glad there were reviews saying this recipe was too salty! I'm sorry I didn't read them until AFTER I made it:(  It is way too salty. Next time (if I make it again), I will not put in the 1 tsp. of salt, and also buy low sodium soy sauce. The salt overpowers the taste by far! I would add more garlic powder and mushrooms next time too.

This turned out amazing for the first attempt. My husband loved it and even told his mom I made it better than her recipe lol.. personally I would of cut the meat into smaller cubes but either way it was awesome! I followed the directions exactly minus the time, I cooked it for 1.5 hours not 2.

I enjoyed this recipe and will make it again.  Found that the sauce did not thicken so I added flour and water to the liquid and it became a good tasting gravy. Excellent over mashed potatoes.

Read all the reviews and decided to take Corrina's advise (the Most Helpful Positive Review). I used 1 cup of beef broth and 1 cup Merlot instead of 2 cups water. I also started off with 2 lbs of sirloin and used 2 brown gravy packs straight into the pot without mixing. My wife told me this is why she married me!

I made this tonight...according to other reviews I made this in the crock-pot and omitted the salt.  I had to make a few changes.  I did omit the additional salt because I felt the soy sauce and Worcestershire were enough and I am glad I did. I did not have the gravy mix, but I still wanted a more gravy like consistency so I added a can of mushroom soup.  When I got home, there was a layer of grease on top and it was very watery (soupy).  I added a can of cream of chicken soup and made a slurry to make it thicker.  The cream of chicken soup was the kicker...added a great taste. However, I would use a chuck roast instead of stew meat (stew meat seemed to disintegrate into almost nothing.. omit the vegetable oil..the meat gave enough grease in the crock-pot. I really like the added cream soups...gave it flavor and consistency.

Very salty.  I think using low sodium soy sauce and low sodium gravy would help this.  I simmered the beef for an hour and added water to it to keep it covered.  I added the packet of gravy with 2 Tbsp. Of water and simmered 30 min longer.  The flavor of this recipe is very good.  Next time I will make this with the above notes and in the crockpot.  Cooking in thr crockpot will make the meat much more tender.

This recipe is an absolute masterpiece!! As we all cook to taste, I have to respectfully disagree with Corrina. I think the longer it is cooked the better it is! I also love garlic and put a LOT in there. The two pounds of meat might be a touch on the too little side, my mother taught me to cook for leftovers. My boyfriend loves it too. After a long day at work, set it up, let I cook and when he gets home, FEAST. Love it! Denisef, your family has a great chef as a mom, God bless you!  CR

This recipe was delicious. I followed other reviews and cooked it in the crockpot. Dumped everything in the crock pot except the gravy pack and let it cook all day.  When we started cooking the noodles, I added just the brown gravy pack with no water and it thickened up quite nicely. We also have increased the beef and water amount and it left enough leftovers to freeze for another whole meal.

My family loved this recipe.  I made a few changes - I did flour the meat before cooking, I did not add the salt and instead of the packet of gravy mix, I just added a cup of water with about 2 tbsp of corn starch mixed in.  I served it over egg noodles.  Everyone went for seconds.  I will definintely be making this again.

I made this for my in-laws and my family and they loved it.  My father in-law loved it so much all could keep saying was how good it was and asked my husband to have me make it for him again soon! I made a couple of minor changes following suggestions on here where I added fresh minced garlic when cooking the onions and I also omitted the water at the end fully because of how thin everything looked and only cooked it an hour and a half.  I served over some rice and that was it.  Great recipe!

5 star with modifications - only used beef broth and red wine for sauce - no soy sauce or worchestershire sauce. Sauteed garlic with the onion, browned meat, and then threw in slow cooker for a couple hours. Added cornstarch at the end to thicken a bit.

Mostly followed the directions but ommitted salt and used beef broth instead of water per reviews. Added a little cooking Sherry.  Simmered for about an hour. Maybe I should have used the salt per the original recipe as this was just bland and I tend to buy low sodium items. I used Omaha Steaks sirloin tips so it wasn't the quality of the meat.  Probably won't make again.  I'm used to getting "wows" and "yums" at dinner time.

I've made this several times.  Very good recipe!  I tweaked it like everyone else!  I don't really measure ingredients at all, just eyeball it and pour/toss it in.  I used a can of beef broth and a cup of water, a larger can of mushroom pieces, added about a half cup of sliced celery, a larger chopped onion, about half a teaspoon each of thyme and sage, a little less of the soy sauce and worstershire, and added 2 envelopes of the brown gravy mix right at the beginning and cooked on the stove for around 2 1/2 hours on simmer.  The meat is fall-apart tender and if the gravy is not thick enough, add another envelope of gravy mix (I like lots of gravy!).  I also love the idea of adding sour cream to it at the end (have done that, too!).  Make it YOURS!  You can and add chopped green pepper, a can of squished whole tomatoes, jalapenos..... the list goes on!!!   Enjoy!  :)

I agree that this is a good base recipe, but if you want it less salty here are my suggestions.  Cut the soy sauce and worchestershire sauce by half and add 1/4 cup of good red wine.  Also, adding beef broth will just make it more salty.  I added 1 glove chopped garlic instead of garlic powder; adjust according to your taste.  I also added dry porticini mushrooms versus canned.  Even though the recipe didn't call for mushrooms it balances the flavor.  Try 1 package of mushroom gravy insted of brown gravy...a lot less sodium.  Delicious!

I tried this with beer and the juice of canned mushrooms rather than water, and a big dash of cayenne rather than black pepper, and garlic flakes instead of powder -- and left the salt out.  The gravy mix was plenty salty.  It's hard to do this wrong as long as the skillet is watched towards the end so it does not completely dry out and burn the meat and onions.  Just a nice caramelization is enough.

This was very good and inexpensive. I bought cheap steak and cut it up myself. I added a bell pepper and a T. of minced garlic. I floured my meat, so I used 1/4 c. olive oil and browned my meat, onion and pepper together. I also used 2.5 c. of water w/ a t. of beef boullion (I didn't use a t. of salt I just sprinkled some while I was browning.) My son-in-law actually called my daughter at work to see if she had eaten supper because he didn't want to save her any. Next time I will make some yeast rolls to go with. Mmmm..

Since I don't eat onions I just browned about a tbsp of unsalted butter with onion powder instead of veggy oil and onions. I had to make my husband corn dogs cause he won't eat ANYTHING with gravy. He went to put his plate up and was in the kitchen for a few minutes before I went to put mine and my son's plate up and I caught him eating this out the pan. When I saw him eating it I was very happy with the recipe

I thought it was pretty good. I made a few modifications. I added mushrooms. I did not have onions on hand so I used onion powder. I did not add the salt b/c one member said theirs was salty. I thought it was still a little salty w/o the added salt. I used half red wine and half water. Served it over egg noodles. I will make this again.

Great recipe, but will alter a bit for future use. First off, too much oil. There was a lot of oil sitting on top that I had to skim off before serving. I omitted the salt and still felt that it was too salty for my taste. Will make again with low sodium soy sauce and see if there are low sodium alternatives for the worcestershire and brown gravy mix. I found it to be done in about an hour before I added the gravy mix. It was also thick enough without needing cornstarch as some had suggested. Overall, quick & easy to prepare and am willing to make again with the changes.

Very tasty, but quite salty.  I used no salt and only 1 T. Worcestershire sauce, but the full 1/2 c. soy sauce.  I'll use less soy sauce next time.  Also used only 1/2 c. water with the gravy mix and let it simmer uncovered for about 15 minutes after adding and the consistency was perfect! I cooked it for 2 hours total and the meat was very tender.  Not sure why others would have tough meat unless they're not using stew meat.

I am rating this 5 stars due to how EASY this recipe is to adapt to the ingredients you have on hand.  I Made the following changes: I left out the soy sauce altogethere.  I added about 1/4 cup barbecue sauce instead.  I followed the recipe otherwise, except I only simmed the beef for 45 minutes, then added the gravy mix (already mixed with water) and boiled for 1 minute.  My husband LOVED this recipe.

I tried to do this in the crockpot with not so great results. I adjusted the recipe for 3 pounds of stew meat, since that's what I had, and I did sub red wine for part of the soy and Worcestershire as recommended by some other reviews. I also used frozen chopped onions instead of fresh and added a large can of sliced mushrooms, drained. I followed the rest of the recipe from there, except the last cup of water (2 cups with the adjusted recipe), which I left out since you need less liquid when cooking with the slow cooker. Unfortunately, there was still too much liquid. Even after adding 2 packages of gravy mix and a cornstarch slurry, the sauce never thickened up. But, the good thing was it still tasted really great! My husband gave it a 4 as it was and I would give it a 4 for flavor myself. I do want to try this again on the stove so I can see how the gravy thickens up the right way before I give this one official stars. But if it tastes as good on the cook top as it did in the crockpot, plus it has real gravy, I'm betting it'll be a 5 star recipe. Thanks so much!

I'm cooking this now. Instead of water I used beef broth. Added some black pepper and garlic powder. It's gonna be beefy. No salt don't need it. Did'nt have any worcestershire so I added some A1 steak sauce. I know it's gonna be good. I'll be back if it ain't.

We did not care for this.  Had to add 4 Tbsp. cornstarch to make it thick enough to make a gravy to pour over noodles, otherwise it would have been way too watery.  I thought the flavor was just OK, my husband thought it was awful and said don't make again.  I used sirloin instead of stew meat because I thought it would be more tender, but that didn't help.  I didn't add the tsp. of salt because I figured it would be salty enough with the soy sauce, and it was (even used low sodium soy sauce), if I had added the extra salt, would probably have been inedible.

I made this last night and we thought it tasted delicious.  I used low sodium soy sauce and didn't add any more salt and didn't have a problem with it tasting too salty - and we don't like much salt in our food.  I used powdered garlic, but I think next time I will use fresh garlic.  I also added 1/2 tsp thyme, which I think I will increase to 1 tsp next time.  I used very lean beef, and found it was a little on the chewy side, so next time I will cook this on a lower heat for at least 2 hours - probably in the oven or slow cooker.  But all in all, this was a good dish.  The flavor of the gravy was amazing and I wouldn't recommend reducing the quantities of soy sauce or worcestershire sauce.

This was really good, although I feel it was too much Worcestershire sauce. It kind of overpowered everything.  Next time I'll add a tbsp at a time until its to my liking.  My husband didn't think it was too much, which is strange since he can be picky.  I don't think it was too salty, although I used reduced sodium soy sauce and McCormick reduced sodium gravy packet.  I also eliminated the extra salt.  I could see how it would be waaay too salty as written.  Served with egg noodles and had baby carrots on the side.  I will definitely make again!

This was absolutely delicious.  I used low sodium soy sauce and left out the 1t salt, and it wasn't salty until I added the gravy packet.  I did what others suggested and didn't add the 1c water with the packet because there was alot of juice from the meat, but I'm sure omitting it is what made it taste so salty.  Next time I will add the water and simply thicken it up with some cornstarch.  I have to give this 5 stars because if I would have followed the recipe I think it would have come out just fine.  Thanks for a great recipe denisef!

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe, thou it was a wee bit salty and the soy sauce was a distinctive flavor. Next time I'll cut the soy sauce down. I also added fresh rosemary and thyme which was oh so yummy! ;)

This was DELICIOUS!  Our lone small town supermarket is notorious for lousy cuts of meat, but this made even their meat tender! I don't add any extra salt as the soy and Worcestershire sauces have enough salt in them.  I also only add about 1/4 tsp of garlic powder.  To make the gravy thicker, I only add 1/2 cup of water, and I usually mix up 2 tbsp of corn starch with 1 tbsp of water and add it to the gravy mixture.  I make mashed potatoes with this and my husband can't get enough!!

My husband and I really liked this and my picky children even ate it without complaining. I put in the full amount of soy sauce and worcestershire sauce but left out the added salt and it turned out with the perfect amount of salt for my taste. I also had to add a couple tablespoons of flour to thicken the sauce up at the end and I used onion powder rather than a chopped onion.  My husband and I both agreed that the flavor was fantastic but the texture of the meat brought it down to a 4 star. Next time I will try cubed sirloin tips isntead of the stew meat.

FANTASTIC - FLAVORFUL - SAVORY!  I almost exactly followed the recipe except I added 1/4C sherry, a little garlic with the onion, and mushrooms towards the end.  Very flavorful!  I also used stew meat because that's what I had.  The 2 hours made the meat very tender.  I also doubled the sauce because we like lots.  This is one to keep and brag about!

This was really good.  I used the slow cooker method, on low for 5 hours.  We served over egg noodles.  I will be making this again!

Good recipe, could be better. Way too salty should have followed others suggestions and cut down on the soy sauce and worchestershire sauce. Added some basil and thyme to the gravey to make it richer.  Other than that it was great. Will make it again just cut the sauces in half.

Yummy!  No salt needed AT ALL!  I did not have a gravy packet, so I adjusted the spices accordingly.  Cooked for about 1.5 hours.  At the end, I mixed Wondra flour with cold water (thoroughly) and whisked in and let simmer until thick and bubbly to thicken the gravy.  It was easy and delicious over whole wheat egg noodles served with baby peas.

Cooked for the time as suggested, was falling apart and tasty.  Used venison instead of beef.  However my family and I found it was too salty and I never put the salt in suggested in the recipe.  Might try again with low sodium soy sauce.  Also, I didnt use gravy mix, I added 1 tbsp of cornstarch to a cup of the water and added it about 20 minutes before taking it off the stove.

I actually skipped the skillet and put it all in the crockpot.  So yummy! Served with egg noodles.  My gravy wasn't thick which my guy liked.  He couldn't get enough.  I added minced onion to add some more flavor.

My family was crazy over this but I agree with the comments about the saltiness.  It is too salty.  I used reduced amount of soy sauce and worchestershire sauce but should have omitted the salt entirely.  I can't wait to try it in the crock pot.  Might help to add a note to cut the stew meat into little chunks.  The pieces of meat from the grocery store are too big.

My husband likes beef tips and rice but I don't, this recipe made the dish edible to me. With modifications, this recipe is a keeper! Thank you!  I omited the soy sauce, reduced the cooking time and instead of the brown gravy mix I made my own gravy with corn starch and extra liquid left over after cooking. I didn't need to add any more liquid.

It was okay.  I held back on the soy sauce as suggested by others and then added sour cream at the end but my husband took one bite and gave me the look which conveyed, "Please don't make this again".  I will finish the leftovers for lunch so not to waste however this is a no-go in our household.   Side Note:  After 1.5 hours the meat was tender.

This was a great, easy recipe.  I followed others' advice and didn't use salt, and I added red wine.  My kids loved it and argued over who got the last serving.  I also didn't use gravy mix, but used the sauce and made gravy from flour and milk.

This was a good recipe. I did this is a crock pot and also followed the recommendations of other reviewers and added no salt. I added mushrooms and then, as we are not big pepper fans, I decreased the pepper to about half of what it called for. The pepper was still too strong. I will definitely make again, but with less worcestershire sauce, low sodium soy sauce, no salt and no pepper this time. This is a great base recipe that can be adjusted to personal preferences very easily.

I just made this for dinner and it was great.  I used sirloin, because thats what I had. I also didnt have mushrooms or the brown gravy mix.  I did the first part of the recipe exactly as is, but when it came time for the gravy addition, I added 2 cups of frozen pea's, and 1 cup of cold water 1 tbsp. cornstarch, and 2-3 tbsps. of gravy starter browning sauce.  It was delicious, and the meat was tender..  My husband slurped his up and wanted more, which from him is a compliment.

This was good, but instead of using brown gravy mix, I waited until the water soysauce mixture reduced by about half, then I mixed in 1/2 cup water with 2 tbs of cornstarch. This ended up great.

The ONLY reason that I gave this four stars instead of five is because the salt would have been too much if the recipe was followed to the letter. Fortunately, I had read the reviews before preparing this and did not add salt AT ALL, just the soy sauce. It was PERFECT! Personal choice: we ate this over rice. EVERYONE loved it and in this house, that was a FIRST! It was very easy to prepare. Took about ten minutes to prep and then only had to be stirred every once in a while. VERY convenient if you have children needing help with homework.

This was a good recipe.  I cooked it in the crock pot for extra tenderness after cooking all day.  I also cut down on the salt by only adding 1/4 of a teaspoon and it was perfect.  Veyr good-thanks for sharing.

This recipe turned out great! I followed advice & cut out the salt & decreased the soy sauce and worchestershire.  To add flavor I put in 2 bay leaves, some dried porcini mushrooms & some red wine.  I also dredged the beef in flour before browing to thicken it up some.  Quite tasty:)

Yummy!!  My husband and I both agree.  After reading the recipe I made some adjustments.  We used venison instead of beef.  I left out the worchestire (whoops) sauce because we didn't have any and put in around 2 T. of lemon juice instead.  I wanted to put this in the crock pot, so I threw everything in the crock pot (including the gravy mix) and left out the last cup of water.  I knew it would need thickening to serve, so I transfered everything to the stove and thickened it with corn starch and water.  It turned out extremely tasty and tender.  My husband preferred it over mashed potatoes, I liked mine with rice.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is wonderful, I only changed a few things starting with season the meat before you brown it & I sauteed it with butter instead of oil, last I eliminated the pepper & cut back slightly on the soy sauce but this meal will definitely me in rotation (the sauce is great on mashed pot) THANK YOU

As is, this recipe isn't good at all. Its really salty and the sauce is thin. I added an extra gravy to it, and it made it much better. I will make it like that from now on. The gravy I added was " simple beef flavored gravy" from this site.

I thought this was a very good recipe.  I like that it uses ingredients I usually have on hand.  Here are the changes I made:  I did not add any salt and only a scant 1/4 teaspoon of pepper.  The gravy mix did not make the sauce thick enough so I had to add some cornstarch and water.  I served it over linguini.  It was quite excellent; both my husband and 17 year old son have asked that I make it again...an update 10/05/08....made this again on Sunday just the same way except I served it over mashed potatoes this time.....wow it was good!  A real rib-sticker of a meal.  Kind of like stew without the vegetables.

This was an easy and yummy recipe to make.  My entire family loved it.  I changed a few things.  Instead of garlic powder i used  garlic cloves.  And 5 min before serving I added 1 Cup fresh green peppers.  Yummy!!! To thicken it up, I added 1c water w/ flour to mixture and it made the sauce very creamy.  I would highly recommend to anyone!

Sure, it tastes ok (with less salt). Am I the only one who is concerned that each serving contains over 50 grams of fat and over 700 calories?

This recipe is EXCELLENT!  It has a marvelous taste!  The only thing we noticed is that we like a bit more gravy with ours so we add 2 to 4 cans of brown gravy mix also.  Another thing we do differently is just brown the meat with seasonings, then put it in a crockpot, then add to the crockpot, dry gravy mix, 2 to 4 cans of gravy, Worchestershire sauce, Soy sauce, and 1 cup of water and let it all simmer for 2 to 4 hours on low.  It tastes great!

I've made this a few times, and I'm making it again tomorrow because everyone keeps asking for it!  The only thing I changed was that I didn't add any salt, and it's excellent.

Found this to be pretty peppery but satisfying.  I subbed a can of beef broth for 1 cup of water.  I think I may add some sour cream next time, per other's advice.

Way too salty!  We really liked this recipe but even my husband and oldest son, who both love salt on everything said that it is too salty.  I will leave out the salt next time and it should be delish!  I added a little corntstarch/water paste at the end to thicken it up a bit.  Served over mashed taters- wonderful hearty meal!

Good recipe, I didn't add the salt & used low sodium soy sauce.  I still felt is was salty enough without adding all that extra salt.

I used a jar of gravy rather than a mix and used a little less of the soy and Worcestershire sauce. And it was still a little to salty.  Very tastey though.
Will make again if I can cut the salt but keep the flavor.

My family really liked this tender meal.  I cooked it well over the recommended time, probably four hours.  I wanted a thicker sauce seeing we weren't going to be putting it over anything because we were having it with a squash cornbread dressing found the same day.  We recommend both and this will become a family stable, going to try it in a crock pot.

This was excellent, considering all the mixed reviews.  We followed the recipe as stated, except added fresh mushrooms and garlic to the meat and onions, and omitted the extra salt. Also used leftover london broil for the meat. Served over egg noodles, it was wonderful. Thank you.

I tried this recipe tonight and it was very good.  It turned out perfectly!  I didn't add the salt that it called for due to reading the other reviews that stated it was too salty.  I served it over egg noodles and peas as a side dish and it was great.  I'll probably make it again.

I really liked this. I think it was easy to prepare and was good over  white rice. I added fresh mushrooms after browning the meat and it came out good. I did use half of the amount said to use for the soy sauce even though mine was lite. It was not salty at all.

As written I would give this 1 star, but listening to others I omitted the salt and reduced the pepper to about a scant 1/2 teaspoon.  Some sliced baby bella mushrooms added a nice flavor as well. I agree this was a little thin but certainly not the end of the world as I was able to thicken it with very little effort.

this was definitely the best beef tip recipe i have ever found!!! I read all the reviews before hand on the saltiness. I don't keep anything "low-sodium" in my house so I just cut down on the soy sauce. It turned out delicious!! Although it really doesn't take 2hrs to cook it!!!

The first time I followed the recipe to the letter, but it was too salty. Now I make it with low-sodium soy, eliminate the salt and saute fresh garlic with the onion, instead of the garlic powder. It's great, very tender - never any leftovers!

This does get a little salty but I put so much rice in it when it's done that the saltiness is spread thin and it comes out quite nicely. What is a real kick in the face is the pepper. I like pepper ALOT, and maybe it's the kind I use, but when I prepare this it's nearly too much pepper. However, I always love a challenge and haven't adjusted it. 

I love how tender the beef gets from those tough chunks you start out with.

Since this was my first time making this, I followed the recipe to the tee.  It turned out excellent with the exception that is was a little too salty - next time I will eliminate the salt. I also had to add some corn starch mixed with water to get it to thicken to my satisfaction.  Meat was tender and delicious.

Made this for dinner last night.  Husband LOVED it!  I used MINCED garlic instead of garlic powder.  I also left out the cup of water that was to be added to the gravy mix and the salt.  I just poured the gravy powder in the pan with the meat, stirred a while, and it thickened nicely!  Will surely be making this again!  And that is saying a LOT, because I am fronm Louisiana and it is REALLY hot down here!  We do not eat many hot foods in the summer, but this one will return in a few weeks to my family's table!  Thanks, Denise!

Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!  I have a hard time cooking with beef (a "recovering" vegetarian, so my husband calls me) - and this was sooo easy!  His facial expression after the first bite said it all.  I used 1 1/2lbs beef, decreased the 2 C Water to 1 3/4 during the simmering period.  The gravy did not end up as thick as he would have liked, but excellent nonetheless!

Wow! Great recipe. This is the first time that I was able to get beef this tender.  I also added fresh mushrooms to the last 30 minutes of cook time.  It turned out great.  My father uses this same recipe for pork chops.

Very good and easy.  I agree it was a little salty, so the second time I made it, I cut the soy and worcestire by 1/2 and it turned out great!
Definately a keeper and is good with venison or chevon also.

Great recipe.  I will use this again; but,will try to reduce salty taste by using "no salt added" gravy mix if available.  To reduce amount of water after gravy is added to mixture, I simmered it uncovered for 30-45 minutes.

My husband liked this recipe very much.  I followed the advice of other reviews and used half as much soy sauce and omitted the salt, and used a roast I cut into pieces.  My only change was that I used a roasting bag and cooked them in the oven.  It turned out great, with less hassle.  They were not as tender as they might have been, but I will try to marinade them next time.  I will certainly use this recipe again.

This recipe is really good if you omit the salt, use low sodium soy sauce and I only put in half the worstershire.  I will make if often with these changes.  Thanks!

This was awesome!  I have never made anything like this before and was kind of nervous to try it since I was making it for guests.  It was a hit.  The only thing I have to complain about is that it didn't get as thick as I thought.  I expected a gravy like consistency.  But it was still delicious and oh so tender.  I will make this again and again and again....

I just found this recipe less than 1 week ago, and have already made it 2 times.  My husband and kids love it!  I can't get my 6 year old to eat meat, but she will eat this. It is wonderful!

This recipe was WAY too salty - my husband ate one small bowlfull and declined more. Soy sauce is very high in sodium, as is Worchester, so I don't know why the recipe needs an additional teaspoon of salt dropped in. Anyway, we felt we couldn't taste the meat, just the salt...

My husband just loved it.  With the other reviewers advice, I eliminated the salt, and I still thought it was a little too salty.  Maybe next time I will use Low Salt Soy Sauce.  Definately a keeper.  Thanks!

Actually, I was pressed for time so I made this in my crockpot.  I made rice when I got home from work to serve with it.  My family loved it! My picky 4 year old wanted 3rd's!  My husband definitely wants me to make this again.

We loved this recipe.  Only negative was that we thought it was very salty.  In the future, I will omit the salt altogether.  Soy sauce and gravy mix adds enough.

Yum Yum, nice and easy, one thing I added was to marinate the beef in an inexpensive burgundy wine for about three hours prior to preperation. The wine gives this dish a gourmet flair.

I am obsessed with McCormick seasoning so I used the steak seasoning McCormick and I used the garden vegetable McCormick seasonings and I did not use soy sauce only Worcestershire sauce I let the meat soak in it for a couple hours and the rest of the recipe I did I said. It is so good and we'll make a lot more times!

I took the advice in the comments and cut the simmer time to 30 minutes then cooked it in the gravy mix for another 15 minutes. I also dropped the salt as the liquids are already super salty.

This was a delicious dish. I made the dish according to the recipe minus the salt, and used low sodium  soy sauce.  I was not trying to change the recipe. I omit salt from most recipes and always use low sodium soy sauce. The dish was not too salty as I read many post saying it was. I served it over rice with asparagus on the side. It was delicious.

I'll make it again & will add more onions next time + some mushrooms, and maybe a bit of cream.

This time, some changes I made was to use less oil, swap garlic powder for garlic, and swap water for one can of beef broth.

I've made I've made this numerous times but have always cooked it in the crock pot. I coat the meat with flour, mix up the liquids with the dry ingredients and pour over the meat, cook on low for 8 hours.  I cut the water back to 1 cup because I'm cooking it in the Crock-Pot instead of the stove. I'll add sour cream about 30 minutes before it's done for a different flavor if I have it on hand. The recipe is great as it is. I changed it some just because of cooking it in the Crock-Pot.

Super good. However that is wayyyy too much soy sauce. I cut it down to about a tablespoon of soy sauce, that was the only modification i made and it was great. Try the sauce about 15 minutes before it's done and add more soy to taste if needed. 
I served it over buttered egg noodles and it was a hit.

Loved it!  Read all the reviews first.  I cut back on the soy & Worcestershire to 2 Tbsp each and used 2 gloves of minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  It wasn’t salty, just right!  Definitely needed that 2 hours to tenderize that tough stew meat.  Adding this my favorite list, thank you.

I made this according to directions I didn’t modify it at all. Beef was really tender . Flavor was ehh. Super salty and I like salt, however too much for my family . Maybe with low sodium soy sauce and don’t add any more salt it would be better .

My husband and I absolutely love this recipe! He asks for it all the time and I don’t blame him, this is a hearty, warm and comforting dinner. Although I do make some changes by substituting the water for beef broth and adding a packet of beefy onion soup mix while the meat is simmering on low. I definitely do not cook for the full two hours, the meat is done in about an hour or a little more depending on the size of the chunks. We serve this over rice or roasted potatoes.

I made this for the first time today and my husband and son loved it!  They agreed that it is their new favorite.  
I tweaked just a bit.  I used low sodium broth instead of 2 cups of water and I floured and browned the meat before cooking it.  I also used used low sodium soy sauce (and cut the amount in ½) and then garlic clove minced instead of garlic powder.  Really was wonderful!

I added added some fresh mushrooms, and to thicken it up more, I added a slurry of corn starch and a little cold water near the end. I omitted the salt, as there was already lots of sodium in some of the other ingredients. I liked the recipe, and I think it would gain a star with about half the Worcestershire sauce, as the gravy had a bit more tang than I would prefer.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

It was super easy to make.  I used grass fed beef which cuts the cook time almost in half.  The sauce turned out super sour though.  I’m not really sure what happened.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!

We enjoyed this recipe! I've made this as directed and in the slow cooker. We preferred it in the slow cooker which was awesome because that's easier! I just dumped everything in the slow cooker, omitted salt, and replaced 2 cups of water with low sodium beef broth.  About 20 minutes before we ate, I added the package of gravy seasoning without any extra water. It didn't thicken up as much as I'd like, so I added a slurry of 1Tbs corn starch with 2Tbs water. Added some cooked egg noodles right before we ate. Mmmm!

I made it but I had to change a few things due to lack of some of the items. 
I did not have brown gravy mix therefore I browned some flour,  seasoning salt and garlic pepper in a cast iron skillet till light to med brown.  did not have fresh onions used dried onions I soaked in  water.   for about 5-10 min.  seasoned the meat with season salt garlic powder & McCormick's Garlic and herb seasoning.    I very seldom use plain white salt.  I prefer Lawry's seasoned Salt for all my cooking.   
it's still simmering I will let you know how it taste soon  but making it was super easy

This was a simply and good recipe! My kids aware it well and hubs liked it too. I used low sodium soy and left out the salt. I also added mushrooms because I had some that needed to be used. Served over buttered egg noodles with green beans and garlic bread. Next time I will serve over mashed potatoes ?? YUM

Wayyyyyy to Salty!! I made it as is, so I'm rating as is. You will need to OMIT THE SALT for it to be good, otherwise all I taste is pure salt. Maybe even use low sodium soy sauce. It's a shame bc I was so looking forward to a nice dinner. Even my husband could barely eat it and he eats everything

Adding fresh mushrooms,deleting the salt, adding a package of onion soup mix instead of the salt, adding  a teaspoon of cornstarch to the gravy packet mixture to insure a think gravy. This looks delishous and I'm looking forward to dinner this evening.

I read the reviews that said it was very salty, so I didn’t use the soy or Worcestershire sauces and used a mushroom gravy packet and found it to be just the right amount of salt. Also, I only used two cups of water total. I am making it again as I type this. Thanks for the share and all the very helpful suggestions.

Like the Worcestershire and peppery flavor. Easy to make. We eat it with rice instead of noodles. Prefer to have lots of onions so we don’t cook the onions at the start and add them when simmering.

Nothing to complain about. It’s not thick, even with the gravy packet, so if you’re looking for thick maybe a bit less water and add your choice of thickener. Thinner was fine for us. We swapped coconut aminos for the soy sauce. The flavor is excellent. It has a good kick and I crave foods that kick  so I was happy :-) Thanks for sharing!

I took the advice and added only half a cup of water to the brown soup mix packet plus a half teaspoon of corn starch and mixed it well before adding it into the cooked pot of beef. Delicious!

I used beef broth instead of two cups of water and used two packets of brown gravy. I also served over  white rice instead of egg noodles. Husband loved it! Will be making again :)

My family loves this!! It’s too salty for us, so I just omit the salt! I use egg noodles, and it’s always a hit! Never any left! It’s so easy and tasty! I highly recommend it, even for picky eaters!

I thought the flavor of this was spectacular & apparently my husband did too as he quickly asked for a 2nd helping!Did not need the salt & will omit next time. Used fresh garlic. Didn’t add extra water for gravy - spooned off 1C of hot meat broth & whisked in the gravy mix before adding back to eat.

So good. I would do the last step without the cup of water next time. It was too watery for me so I had to add some corn starch to thicken the gravy a bit.

Made this for dinner one night and we both enjoyed it.  I had reduced the number of servings to 4 because I only cook for 2 now.  I also reduced the amount of pepper from 1 tsp. to 1/2 tsp. It was very good but still a little too much pepper. I reduced the cooking time to 1 1/2 hours.  The beef was still very tasty and would make again.  Next time I may try toe crockpot.

Used fresh garlic and shallots along with mushrooms and onions. Butter and olive oil. Used garlic powder, salt and pepper, corn starch on meat. Browned added just a small amount of worcheshire sauce and no gravy mix, used “ better than bullion beef base “ served over rice.  Splash of fresh parsley   So yummy!!!

I made this in my Instant Pot from beef that was frozen solid late in the afternoon.  I put the frozen beef into the pot, ran the "stew" cycle once through.  Removed lid, all the beef was separated, and mostly cooked.  There was a lot of liquid in there from the freezing, so I chose not to add water to recipe when proceeding.  I then  added onion, etc as recipe, plus 1/2 bag of shredded carrot instructs, then ran the Instant Pot through the stew cycle again.  Continued with recipe but added a second package of gravy mix due to there being a lot of thin liquid and then finished off with just a splash of whipping cream to make it a bit richer.  This was a hit with my family, and the Instant Pot saved me.  The meat was super tender  and everyone commented on how good the meat tasted.  Nice change from traditional stew!  Thank you.

First time making beef tips. Good flavor. I too omitted the salt even with low sodium soy sauce there's was plenty. Glad I gave this recipe a try.

I made this exactly as the recipe states and it was delicious. I put it over homemade garlic toast. I think it would also be amazing as a base for stew and am going to try that next.

Made this tonight. I read through all the comments and cooked it in my slow cooker instead of on the stovetop. I'm also trying to cut down on our sodium intake as a household so I did cut the Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce amount in half (mostly because we also don't cook with them often so we aren't used to the strong flavoring of either ingredient ) oh and I also used the low sodium version of soy sauce. This is definitely a recipe that I will be making again soon and often! Very simple and very flavorful!

Sautéed the onions with garlic before browning the meat. Used beef consommé instead of water and about 2/3 of the soy and Worcestire. Only cooked for about an hour. Then is used sour cream onion dip with the gravy mix. Came out very tender and tasty. The sauce was a little thin - but went really well with rice or a nice baguette

Instead of a gravy packet, I used a packet of au jus. I simmered in Dutch oven and it turned out so good. Hubby really liked it.

Made this dish last night and it was delicious! Like the other reviewer I did not add salt to this and I was happy that I listened to her advice. I recommend adding the soy sauce and worchestshire but wait till the end to taste and add salt to your preference. The soy sauce and worchestshire already has a lot of sodium! I cooked this for 2 hours like the recipe to make it really tender. This will definitely be added to my arsenal for easy week night meal!

My husband, our roommate, and I all loved it! It was pretty easy to make and delicious with some egg noodles and some buttered bread to soak up the gravy. I did make some changes based on reviews but not many, I only used half an onion because that's all I had and I sauteed about 2 tablespoons of minced garlic with it. I halfed the amount of soy sauce because I didn't want it to be too salty and I also cut out the salt and pepper. Instead I added garlic powder and onion powder and I added the gravy packet in when I added the 2 cups of water instead of including an additional cup of water. I simmered it for 1.5 hours and there was still quite a bit of liquid so to thicken it up I took a cup of the juice and added another packet of gravy and about half a tablespoon of cornstarch mixed it well and then added it back to the pot and stirred it together. It thickened up into a nice gravy that way, it still was a little salty but not enough to deter us from gobbling it up. Will definitely make this again!

This recipe is a decent base. The only change I made was to decrease the salt to 1/2 tsp. I found that even that was too much salt (and I used low sodium soy sauce) so next time I will eliminate the salt entirely. The pepper was also very overpowering. Not for the flavor in the meat but if you put the sauce over noodles, it is just way too much. Next time I will eliminate the salt, use 1/4 tsp-1/2 tsp pepper and will add some mushrooms. Since the mushrooms let out liquid I'll reduce the water.

Delicious and the family loved it! Was a bit too salty with regular chicken broth (given the soy sauce and other salty content already added) so will either try with reduced salt broth or plain water next time. A definite winner otherwise!

I made just like the recipe but it was too salty!  Other than that it was delicious.  The beef tips were so tender!   Next time I will use  low sodium gravy mix.

Great base recipe, but quantities need adjusting.  1/2 C soy AND 1/4 C Worcester and additional salt were way too much.  I think the soy sauce is the main source here.  Next time, I'll drop this down to 1/8 C soy sauce and 1/8 C Worcester and still avoid the added salt.  Then some tasting and adjustments at the end.

This is delicious! I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder and I didn’t not add any extra salt. The salt in the meat and soy sauce was enough and it’s still very salty, but flavorful.

I made this & used less salt along with reduced sodium soy sauce. It was perfect. I was worried it would be too salty, but it wasn’t. Served with mashed potatoes & green beans. My family enjoyed it, so I’m going to make again tonight.

We have 6 kids and finding meals that everyone eats is almost impossible in our house. I started making this recipe a year ago and it is still an all time favorite recipe. We have to quadruple the recipe however but it's amazing. Especially budget friendly

Loved the recipe! I used deer meat in place of beef and it was awesome!! I looked up a beef tips recipe to find a different way to use up our deer meat, so glad google popped up this one. Also appreciate the different ideas, someone mentioned mushrooms which I had a few left over and didn’t even think of adding it until I read the review, this dish is a great way to use up those veggies that need to get eaten...definitely one to make again.

Made this with low sodium soy sauce the first time and my Mother-in-Law and wife loved it. Tried it again (still low sodium soy sauce) with chocolate bock beer to replace the water and fresh garlic instead of powdered; I also used Gluccomannan  Powder as a thickener. Even better the second time.

Instead of the soy sauce I added 1 cup red wine to deglaze the pan. I also had a jar of pork gravy which I think adds a better taste than beef gravy for whatever reason and two tsp beef bullion. No need for added salt. I also reduced then thickened with a little cornstarch. Finally...HOMEMADE MASHED POTS  and framed with fresh steamed green beans!!! Cozy!!

Very tasty. Easy to make.  Take care with adding salt, it can lean on the salty side if not using low sodium ingredients.

I'm a marginal cook, and instructions need to be explicit.  It doesn't say when to add the gravy/water mix, whether it's during the time the beef is cooking or after.  I split the difference and added it about an hour in.  After 2 1/2 more hours, the beef was flavorless and the sauce was watery.  I was frustrated and put it in the fridge overnight.  That helped the flavor considerably, and the gravy was just slightly thicker.  I ended up putting in 2 TBSP of cornstarch (mixed with a little cold water), and that helped.  End result:  great flavor and tasted fabulous over egg noodles.  What I will do next time is, wait the 2 1/2 hrs. to add the gravy/water mix.  If that doesn't thicken the sauce (like on the video), I'll do the cornstarch again, and would use maybe a tsp. or two more.  My husband loved it, and so did I!  One more note:  I did not add the salt.  The soy sauce (reduced sodium) and Worcestershire added enough to the recipe.

This is one of my go-to dishes for weekend comfort food. It's so easy and delicious everytime. The only adjustment I've made is to add 2 packets of brown gravy w/ 2 cups of water after browning the meat & onions. Then another cup of water about an hour later. The added water dilutes the salt of the gravy, soy & worcestershire perfectly. We've served over mashed potatoes & egg noodles and the beef pairs well with both. Highly recommend holding onto this recipe!

The family loved it and it made great left overs! The meat was super tender. The only thing I'd change is using low sodium soy sauce because it was a bit salty for my taste.  I made my own brown gravy using "Better Than Bouillon" roasted beef  base. Yummy! Highly recommend this recipe!

Made exactly as written, save for throwing in some garlic with the onion, and served over egg noodles. Delicious!

I made this recipe as written except left out the salt. It was still way too salty and the Worcestershire was very overwhelming. I don’t think I’ll make this one again.

I like onions, when I followed the directions the onions  disintegrated. I removed the onions after sautéing and added them back about 20 minutes before eating. It was awesome! My whole family loves it.

I'm sorry but this was horrible.  Turned out, meat tender but the gravy was so salty and just an odd flavor.  Not at all what I  had hoped it would be.  Yuck.

OK...I hate it when people do their own "thing" to a recipe...and in all honesty I didn't really change it.  I made a 1/2 recipe because it's just the two of us.  The only thing I changed is the cooking time. I didn't cook it for 2-1/2 hours...that would have made the meat overdone for us. I chopped 1/2 onion and cut up fresh mushrooms and cooked them as the recipe says. Browned the meat the exact way on the recipe, then I put the mixture of worcestershire in and let it simmer for about 10 minutes, then I added the gravy mixture.  To thicken it up, I added some corn starch and water mixed together (maybe a tablespoon of water with 2 tablespoons of corn starch...I didn't measure).  It thickened up in just a few minutes and I served over egg noodles.  It was great!!!  This is definitely a recipe I will do again!!!
(OH! I also didn't add the salt....it has enough in the worcestershire, garlic and gravy mix)

This was a great meal. Very tasty.  The whole family liked it.
It was just too salty.  I even used low sodium soy sauce.  So next time I'll leave out the teaspoon of salt.

I use this beef tip recipe for my version of shepherds pie. The first time I made it I followed the ingredients to the T except for the salt, DELISH!! I made it again tonight and realized I was out of soy sauce :( and wasn't very fond of any of the soy sauce substitute recipes I found. I ended up using 1/4 cup of beef consomme and half the salt that the original recipe called for, and it was still great!!! This is a new staple meal for our family. Thanks!!

I changed a lot so this review if for me ! So I will know exactly what I did and can do it again next time (probably once a week from now on!) added one can cream of mushroom one can cream of chicken threw everything in the slow cookers. Salted and peppered meat 1/2 Of an onion and 3 cloves garlic minced before throwing them in. Cooked 7 hours. Cook out 2 cups liquid and made the instant rice with it. Thickened up the rest of the liquid with a tablespoon of corn starch desovled in 2tbsp of the liquid. This was out of  This world. This was a recipe I wish I had company over just to have more People enjoy it with my husband and me. Pepper plays a huge role in the success of this dish. Moderate salt.

I used ribeye steak cut into strips. Cooked in crockpot. Didn't add salt and used fresh garlic. I don't like meat very much and made it for my husband. He loved it this has become a go-to recipe for dinner.

This recipe is definitely a keeper.  My husband is not a fan of noodles, so placed it over mashed potatoes.   Tender and flavorful.  Thought it might be too much Worchester, but it was perfect.

Tasted great. I make my own "soy sauce" due to allergies. (Got the recipe on this website.) I also make my own gravy. This may be why I did not think there was  too much salt.  Did the recipe as stated. I think may not have put enough water because it started to burn at the 1 hour mark, but It still turned out delicious and tender.

I cooked mine for 2 1/2 - 2 hrs 45 minutes  and I think this is very necessary. However I lightly seasoned my meat before browning with salt and pepper. I also made the recipe with 3 lbs. of beef stew meat instead of the 2 the recipe actually called for. Everything else stayed the same besides using gravy with mushrooms instead of plain ol’ Brown gravy packet. It came out perfectly seasoned not too salty at all and tender. I made both mashed potatoes and white rice for variety.

I made the recipe exactly as it’s listed here. I’m trying not to add any extra ingredients or modifications because while  those may be’s fun for people who have cooked it before, but for people like me who never had I would rather the recipe be reviewed exactly as it directs on the recipe. It was really really good 2 1/2 hours was exactly the right amount of time. We had to do was add some cornstarch in the very end to thicken the gravy a little bit. I also sprinkled a little amounts of MSG to the beef when it was cooking in the pan with the onions.

I made it exactly to the recipe using low sodium soy sauce and it wasn't too salty at all. I did add 2 tablespoons corn starch to the gravy mix for thickening, but otherwise cooked it exactly to the directions and it was perfect. The meat was very tender, I did coat it in tenderizer, and my boyfriend said it was restaurant quality.

This was delicious and made plenty of gravy.  I didn't add the salt but otherwise made it according to recipe.  Quick, easy and flavorful.  Served it with potatoes.  Thank you for the delicious addition to my recipe file.

This was a good base recipe, which was exactly what I was looking for. My suggestion would be to either use salt or soy sauce, definitely not both. I was looking to use up some leftovers, so I didn't follow this to a T. I used leftover gravy from a roast instead of gravy packet, fresh garlic, added Italian seasoning, just because, and used teddy bear noodles because that's what I had.

I followed the directions exactly..and this was far too salty for our taste! I will certainly make this again omitting extra salt and using far less say sauce and Worcestershire sauce!

I made this last week and the  family loved it. We all thought the sauce was delicious. The only thing I changed was I dipped the meat in flour before browning and I cooked it for an 1 1/2 hours instead of 2. Otherwise I stuck to the recipe as is.

I made this recipe this evening for dinner.  I made minor changes only because I didn't have the exact ingredients. I used tenderloin tails instead of stew meat and a can of cream of mushroom soup instead of the packet of gravy mix.  I cut down on the salt and did use low sodium soy sauce.  Didn't need to cook it quite as long as the meat I used is  more tender then the stew meat.  It was so easy to make and so delicious.  My husband of 51years loved it.  I feel like I'm a pretty good cook but he said it was one of the best recipes I'd ever made. He had two servings and is taking the leftovers to work tomorrow for lunch.   It's a keeper for sure.

I made this and  the flavor was good. I did add about 1/2 cup cooking wine and a little chopped green and red pepper. I also ended up adding a little cornstarch towards the end.  For my taste it was too soupy and I like my sauce thicker. I  added a bit more sour cream to suit my familles preference. I cooked this is my pressure pot (except for the noodles I served it on) and it turned out really good. It really helped to tenderize the beef tips to my preference.  I served with cheese filled biscuits, buttered peas and cottage cheese. All in all , the meal prep and cook time took about  1 1/2 hours including clean up!

Pretty good.  2 cups water is way too much liquid. I reduced to 1 cup using half-cup beef stock and half-cup red wine. 2 hrs is too long to simmer.  30 minutes suffices, then 5-10 mins simmer after adding gravy mix/water.

Had I not made changes, I would not have rated it so high.
So many reviews mentioned it being too salty. Instead of eliminating the salt, I eliminated the gravy. Instead, I added arrowroot (3 Tbs maybe?) that I had dissolved in some of the broth from the pan, then added back into the pan. Stirred until thickened. I had thought I might need to add additional spices, but it was plenty flavorful enough without the gravy. Even still, I’m going to use less soy sauce next time. It was just at the top end of my limits for salty flavor. And it was agreed that it should go into regular rotation by my family.

Yum Yum! Followed directions exactly as written, very good. Next time I will skip the salt, it gets enough with the sauces and gravy.  I'll also add some mushrooms and fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder.  Delicious comfort food!

Excellent and then some. The only things I did different was used the crock pot or as I call it the one pot wonder and thickened up sauce with maybe a tablespoon of cornstarch/water. Cooked in crockpot on high for 4 hours and 2 on low. When I turned down to low was when I added the other ingredients besides the meat. Served over egg noodles and a side of vegetables. The sauce was so good I put some on my leftover peas and noodles, no meat left. This is one of the best recipes I’ve made off this site. I will make again and pass along to others

I made a few changes due to the fact that it wasn't planned and kind of thrown together at the last minute. I skipped the onion (only because i didn't have any lol). I didn't have soy sauce so I subbed some stir fry sauce I had. I also didn't really measure anything because I really didn't want any extra dishes tonight (not because I'm lazy, but I was very sick). I only let it cook for about an hour and a half (mainly because that was the break i got in between feeding my 2 month old, chasing my 3 year old, and not being sick for a few minutes). Then (because I really didn't want any more dishes and we're a little redneck) I served it on top of tater tots. My son and I loved it, he even got seconds and you know thats a huge deal if you have a toddler.

Very good!  Agree with other reviews on the amount of salt.  I added an extra cup of water at the end to lessen the salt taste.  Also agree it didn't need 1.5 hours at all to cook.  I pulled my off at 45 minutes.   I will use low sodium beef broth and gravy next time and minus the added salt.

Very tasty! I left out the salt because of other comments, but I will add it next time. Not too salty to us. (I did use low-sodium soy sauce, however.)  I will also add some cayenne pepper to give it a little kick. Living in Cajun country, that's just what we do.

I gave this 4 stars because my whole family ate it and said it was pretty good.   It was also super easy.  The only thing I changed was used a low sodium brown gravy mix and low sodium soy sauce.  It was plenty salty even using the low sodium ingredients.  Would make again...served over egg noodles with a side of roasted broccoli.

This was very good. I followed the recipe for the most part. However it was too salty though. I'm glad I tasted before I added the gravy packet. That said, the only thing I changed was that instead of using 2 cups of water initially, I used 1-1/2 cups of water, and in place of the remaining water, I used some red wine. Then at the end of the recipe when you're supposed to put the gravy and water in, I just used 1 cup of water with 1-1/2 tablespoons of cornstarch.

My family loved these beef tips and will be asking for them often! I made a couple of small changes based on the other reviews - I cooked the beef in beef broth and red wine rather than water, didn't add any additional salt and didn't use a packet of gravy mix. I just mixed up about 2 tablespoons of corn starch with some water to thicken and it had plenty of flavor from the other seasonings.

I'm making this tonight, for the third time! We love it! It has definitely been added to our 'Regular Meal Rotation List'. A couple of things.... There is absolutely, positively No reason at all to add ANY salt to this recipe! The soy sauce & Worcestershire give it plenty! Trust me! Also, it's probably not 100% necessary to cook it for 2 hours. However, I like to. I like to get this meal started when I get home from work, & by the time my hubby gets home (about 2 1/2 hours after me), & we've all had time to shower & relax, dinner is perfect! Plus, I let it cook for 1 1/2 hours, then add the gravy & let it all simmer together for the last half hour, while I usually pop some cresent rolls in the oven. Perfect! Tender! Yummy!

Great recipe and easy to follow ... I made as printed with the exception of using red wine and beef broth in place of the two cups of water (1c of red wine and 1c low sodium beef broth) ... used low sodium soy sauce to cut down on the salt intake ... did not add the additional salt as recommended by other reviewers ... meat was tender and very tasty ... served over mashed potatoes !!! Be sure to NOT over cook the meat ... the texture can turn mushy almost ...

I marinated meat (deer steak) for 4 hours before I did this recipe. Cooked onion and half a yellow pepper with my deer meat. No salt. No water, used low sodium beef broth and added a cream of mushroom soup. Used real garlic(2 cloves). Put in crockpot for 3 hours on high. Soaked up all the broth with white rice.

This was so easy and super delicious.  I thought it was to much water in the beginning.  Would probably cut it down to one cup.  I ended up cooking longer uncovered to get the gravy a little thicker. Only used half the salt and probably didn't need that.   Definitely going into my rotation!

I've been regularly making this recipe for a few years - just never rated it. It's foolproof, easy and delicious! Over time, I've made the following minor adjustments: Instead of two cups water, I use two cups beef broth; and instead of the gravy mix at the end, at about 90 minutes in, I mix 2 or so teaspoons cornstarch with 1/2 cup of leftover beef broth, stir it in and let it simmer. I've played with adding things like onions or mushrooms, but the basic recipe is usually the way to go for us. Half of my family likes it with egg noodles and a small dollop of sour cream, the other half over top of mashed potatoes. And of course, yummy rolls to sop up the sauce!

My review is really for the cooking method, as it turned out fantastic.  I did make a few changes- first, I dredged the beef in flour before browning, thus leaving out the gravy mix.  Because of the reviews about saltiness, I omitted the soy sauce.  I added beef broth concentrate to the water, and in the last 15 minutes. added noodles, making this a one pot dish.  I did add greek yogurt at the end, to make more of a stroganoff,  but that is personal preference.  The beef using this method was so tender and delicious, I am sad that I waited so long to try it.

I used 1/3 cup red wine, same with Worcestershire sauce. Also used low sodium, no salt added beef broth instead of water. Added peas at the end, real garlic cloves (3) instead of garlic powder and also added green peppers, and fresh mushrooms, all over mashed potatoes. It was awesome!!

This recipe is a winner!  This is now going to be in the rotation of meals!  My husband and I had to restraint ourselves from having seconds, it's that good!  Nice taste, savory too!  Added a nice glass of cab and Wow!  Will definitely make again.  No changes made to the recipe, might add some wine to it next time!  Thanks for the recipe!

It is very good, family liked it. When I make it again I will decrease salt for sure (and maybe a little less soy). I tried it without the gravy and added some red yellow and orange sweet peppers...YUMMY over rice

This was an easy and delicious dish and my husband has asked for it again this week.  The only change I would make would be to add more meat next time, we ended up with too much sauce.   I will make this again for sure.

Very picky eater in my house, but she loves the store bought beef tips. I made this and she ate twice the normall amount and said it's so much better than the store (duh). I made my own gravy mix from cornstarch, beef bullion, and garlic powder, and I mixed about half a cup of water with it before I added it to the pan. Only cooked the meat about an hour, and it was a little salty. I'll probably use less salt next time around. Definitely making it again!

Omit the salt.  Can be made in the crock pot - just add all ingredients and cook low for 6-8 hours.

Yum!  I used beef broth instead of chicken.  Added fresh mushrooms and sauteed those with onion.  Substituted Tamari for Soy Sauce.   Seriously delicious!!!

Don't listen to the people who say you don't need to cook this for two hours. You need to cook it that long to extract the Collagen from the meat. It is very good and tender.

My family and I love this recipe. The first time I made it I had wished the sauce was thicker so the second time I only added 1 cup of water to simmer and mixed the gravy mix in 1/4 cup water before adding it to the skillet.  Perfect!

Great meal and will become one of my go to meals at it is so easy. I made a few changes just for fun but turned out really good. I floured the meat and cooked with the onions then used beef broth instead of water. Added a can of stewed tomatoes as well. Served over mashed potatoes and LOVED IT!!

I wish I read the reviews before making this because if you follow the recipe as listed, it is way too salty! Next time, I won't add salt and will look for low sodium options for the soy sauce & gravy. Otherwise, it's a very easy recipe that doesn't take much prep time at all.

This recipe has really great flavor, but way too much salt!!! The only change I made to the recipe was omitting the salt. Next time I make it, I plan on cutting the soy sauce down to 1/8th a cup to see if that helps.

We really loved it.  I would recommend only adding 1/2 cup of water instead of the 3 cups total.  It was a little too thin for me, but I will definitely make again.

This was absolutely delicious.  We liked the amount of salt but I suggest not adding any extra at all. At the very end I mixed 2 tablespoons of corn starch with 2 tablespoons of water and added it to thicken it up a little more.

I used beef broth instead of water and low sodium soy sauce.  After browing place all in Dutch or French oven and bake for 3 hrs at 300 degrees.
We always used 3 to 3 1/2 lbs of stew meat so there is leftovers for the week.  Adding mushrooms (8 oz) is a nice touch.

Add a tea of Gravy Master to give it a dark rich color.

Excellent flavor and beef was perfectly tender. Wish the sauce had thickened up a bit more, but it was good regardless. Will definitely make it again!

excellent recipe. I did use 4 cloves of garlic minced, sweet banana peppers and a vidialia onion sauted in butter . I  then transferred the onion pepper garlic to a plate and browned the beef. added everything back together. used no-sodium soy and beef stock to the brown gravy mixture and I did add a little more wojo sause then called for. only used fresh ground pepper. served over egg noodles and a cuke salad. fine eating!

This was pretty good. The soy made it a bit salty, and I added corn starch because I like the gravy thick. will definitely make it again with a few revisions. had out over rice with some fresh green beans. Quick and easy - Thanks!

This was a good simple meat but I didn't add all of the soy.  Once I began combining the ingredients, I realized the combination of soy, worcestershire, gravy, and salt would have made it waaaaay too salty.  My advice, either omit the salt altogether or use low sodium ingredients.

This was way too salty and I didn't even add the extra salt called for in the recipe. The flavor was off to me. I added red wine and that helped a bit but not enough to make me use this recipe again.

RATING ACTUAL RECIP: It's Way too salty. I do love that there isn't cream of  as a base. 

ALTERED RECIPE: No salt, 1 tsp beef bouillon in the 2 cups of water and I added baby portobellos. A def keeper, but a bit too salty still. I suspect if I halve the soy it would be perfect. I also add the gravy packet at the end, boil for a few minutes then let it sit - no flame - while i boil the egg noodles. I didn't have a problem with consistency.

We really really liked this!!! I have tried several different recipes for beef tips and this one is by far the best.  The only thing I did different was use beef broth in place of the water and fresh minced garlic in place of the garlic powder.  This is the recipe for me--no more trying other ones!!!

My family tore this up!! It is rare that I find a recipe that every person loves but this one did the trick. I followed the recipe pretty closely, according to what I had at home. I dredged the meat in 1/2 cup of flour mixed with garlic powder and cracked pepper since  I did not have the gravy packet. I did use hot water both when I added the first two cups and when I added the last cup. I had the Better than Beef concentrate for when I need beef stock and added a teaspoon of that to the last cup of hot water and let it simmer for ten more minutes at the end. Flavor was great, not too salty (I did not add any additional salt), and had a nice amount of sauce.

It was easy and delicious. I did not brown the meat in oil as the meat has enough fat.  I just threw the meat in the skillet and it browned up nicely without the extra fat and calories.  I also did not precook the onions as I felt they would be too mushy.  The gravy did not get thick so I used a little corn starch.  My daughter wanted me to make it again the next day.

The recipes seem to be very tasty until the last step. Adding the package of gravy mix made the whole meal so salty that it was unpalatable. I suggest reducing the soy sauce or even eliminating it or make your own thickening

I made this recipe as close to the way it was written as I could.  I didn't have the brown gravy packet and was going to ask my hubs to stop on his way home for it. Turns out I didn't need it. The sauce was flavorful enough on its own but needed thickening at the end. I scooped out some sauce into a separate bowl and mixed in corn starch then stirred back into the beef mixture. I also didn't measure the salt, pepper or garlic powder so I may have used a tad more than listed. My hubs requested that I add sautéed mushrooms with the onions next time  I also might toss it all in the crock pot after browning everything in the skillet. All in all it was pretty good and I will defiantly make this again.

My family loved it. I have to make almost double because my 4yr old eats so much.  I only changed two things, instead of the gravy packet. I used Heinz  Homestyle Beef Gravy in a jar at the end, just until it was warm and made it with beef rice a roni. Had much more flavor to us.

used low sodium soy and beef gravy and 1/2 the salt, it was awesome.  Also used some corn starch at the end to help thicken it up.  Next time will make mushrooms for my husband.  I don't like them

I give this recipe 5stars with some slight modifications. I personally reduced the salt to just a quick grind out of my salt freshly grinder. I figured with the salt in the soy sauce it had all I needed. I also did not cook it the full 2 hours. I simmered it about an hour and a half and the meat was fall apart tender. thus recipe also lends itself well to other red meats. I have made an amazing version of this with bear meat on more than one occasion.

First time I made this dish it was good but so salty. Next time I made it I left out the salt and used only the soy sauce omitting the Worcestershire. I also use butter instead of oil doesn't make real difference I just prefer it. Very yummy!

Flavor was great. Needed to be thicker sauce for egg noodles. Will try with potatoes next time or rice and make the sauce thicker. My husband had seconds.

I made this last night with mashed potatoes and it was a hit. Now, I can't stand it when people start listing all their substitutions and changes but I do have to say this. I realized while making it I didn't have any brown gravy mix.  So I stopped after the simmer step. It was very good this way and my picky teens ate it up.  So if you would prefer a thinner gravy than you will like it this way!

I thought this was very good but I did make some minor changes. I cut out the salt and used low sodium chicken broth.
I used Beef Tips (that is what the recipe is named!), stew meat is too tough for a recipe calling for tips. I used only a cup of the broth and 1/2 cup of a dry red (what ever I have left over from the night before, never cooking wine) added my other ingredients, brought to a boil, covered the pot and put in a 250 degree oven and braised for 1-1/2 hours

Even after simmering for the required time, I found the meat just a little tough. So another 20 minutes in a covered Pyrex dish in a 400 degree oven took care of that.

A good basic recipe. I followed the directions to a T and did not have a problem with it being to salty. My wife and I thought that there was to much Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce in the tips. To us it gave a odd taste. Next time I make this recipe I will cut back on these two sauces.

I have made this many times each time changing the recipe a little first I cut down the black pepper  I now only use and 1/8 teaspoon I also added a second package of the gravy mix and only used a 1/4 cup of hot water to dissolve the mix before adding to the rest of the mixture in the pan this way it has a thicker gravy and my family likes it much better. we make this a least a month

After using the recipe the first time, I added thin slices of bell pepper, and substituted 1/4 cup of red wine while using only half the soy sauce. Excellent cold weather dish!

This is a great recipe and is delicious every time! I usually cook it in the crock pot. The only change I make is to use low salt soy sauce.

This was convenient to make, even when taking the extra step of browning the meat for additional flavour. Unfortunately rhere's no escaping how the inclusion of this recipe's many processed ingredients affects the taste.
and health.
We did eat the dish but I don't think I will make it again.

This was my first attempt ever at making beef tips and I thought it was to die for!!!  My wife also loved it but said she thought it was a bit too salty so, maybe next time,  I may try with a low sodium Soy sauce or even omit the teaspoon of salt. I served it over mashed potatoes with a side of corn on the cob. just couldn't get enough. absolutely LOVED it!!!

I have made this several times. It's one of my and my husband's favorite. I use minced garlic instead of the powder and sauté it with the onion. Also I find that 1 1/2 hours is enough cooking time. I also only use 1/2 cup of water with the brown gravy or it comes out to watery.

This was good but way too salty and I have even cut the salt back to half a teaspoon. Next time I think I would leave it out. I did like the flavor of the meal and everyone ate it but it was just too much salt. I had even cut back on the pepper and garlic half.

Great recipe.  I did make a few changes based on comments.  I used Guidry's instead of of the onion (Guidry's creole mix is onions, green onions, bell pepper, celery, garlic, & parsley), used a little extra garlic, added no salt, added extra pepper, added fresh sliced mushrooms, and instead of the small gravy packet (.75 oz) I used Pioneer which comes in a 1.6 ounce size.  I did not mix the gravy packet with water; I whisked it in dry.

Husband ate two large plates.  It's going on the menu rotation.

This is definitely a recipe that you will make again and again.  My family and I absolutely love it!  I learned after the first time I made it that it was too salty (even for me!) and so the last time I made it I omitted the salt and used low sodium soy sauce and gravy mixes.  Much better when I made it that way.  I find it does not thicken up the way that I would like so next time (which there definitely will be) I'm going to try the suggestion given in the top rated review by Corina.

Loved it! I did everything the recipe called for but I didn't have time to cook it for two hours. Mine cooked 40 mins and was very tasty. My kids didn't even notice the onions since they were so translucent.

Took others advice and limited the salt. As for any recipe taste test for seasoning if you unsure.

The stew beef is like rubber, the gravy did not set up until after adding cornstarch!

My large family of all ages loved it. I too put in crock pot. 4-5hrs high, for 4 hrs then low. Didn't sauté onions, just threw in crock pot. I used veg broth( didn't have beef broth) for water. Used LOW sodium soy. I did need to transfer to large pot at end to bring to boil to get gravy to thicken, actually had to use cornstarch/water to thicken, even after brown gravy pkg. sure will make this a repeat. Used mashed potatoes instead of noodles. What a great winter meal.

This is very similar to my own go to recipe. I always use purple onion slices, fresh minced garlic, and add some cream of mushroom. I usually slow cook the meat and sauce together, and this works great with deer steak. Also I rub the meat with onion soup mix, steak season and olive oil and sear I lock in juices before putting in the crockpot.

This was really really salty.  I had a hard time finishing half of it and ended up only eating plain noodles.  I was disappointed.

I was hesitant. I was doubtful. I thought the meat would need more cooking time to be tender. I halved the recipe because I only had a pound of meat. The only things I did differently were omitting the salt and I only simmered for about 90 minutes. Right up until I took my first bite, I was prepared for chewy meat. I was wrong. It was fab. I will make this again. :)

I added 2 tblsp of spicy mustard (Chinese restruant style) and some crushed red pepper. Let it simmer until the sauce thickened and served with rice pilaf! Yum!

I have made this exactly as the recipe states and I have also done my own modifications. Both are wonderful. I like to add cream of mushroom soup to mine. I suggest serving with mashed potatoes or rice and have some biscuits or crescent rolls for that extra gravy. My family loves this meal

I love this recipie, however, I added fresh garlic to the onions, and used beef boullion in the 2 cups of water, and just a little flour to the gravy mixture(only about a tablespoon full) and yes fresh mushrooms add to the flavor. Yummy!

Loved this recipe. Two things I'll change next time is not to add the salt and gravy.  I've been cutting back on salt and with the soy sauce, that is plenty.  I would take about 1/2 cup of the sauce after it has cooked and add a tsp or 2 of corn starch to thicken.   The flavor doesn't really require a gravy packet. Very good meal with egg noodles and peas.

I had to give only 4 stars because of the saltiness.  After the first time, I used low sodium soy sauce and did not add the additional salt.  I also don't use as much water as called for.  I scooped some liquid from the skillet to dissolve the gravy mix.  The longer it simmers the more tender the meat, but still don't need that much water, IMO.  Overall, great recipe that my kids love!

Amazing!!  I always eat too much...I followed the reviews every time and did 1.75 cups beef broth, 1/4 cup red wine, add fresh garlic, just add the gravy mix directly without the 1 cup of water and then a little cornstarch at the end to thicken up the gravy.  It's a great recipe and my picky son loves it too!

My family lives this recipe.  We usually use beef broth instead of water and add the seasoning in while browning the meat.  Also my youngest always thinks it's too hot (spicy) so we did half the pepper. Still a little too much (even for me; don't like much kick in anything) si were trying it withv1/8 tsp pepper to see how it goes.  The way I figure,  the rest of my family can add pepper. This is my go to beef tip recipe and we now serve it when we have a bunch of family over because it's easy. I haven't tried the crockpot but that will be next. We've served it over noodles and rice.

WAY TOO SALTY!! I didn't even add the actual salt, just the soy sauce and it is still way too salty. Like so salty it's burning my tongue and I nor my kids can eat it. I think I might try this recipe again but with 1/4 of the soy sauce called for and no extra salt. Wowzers!

Two words EASY & EXCELLENT! This is my first review. That's how good it is! I read reviews and decided to toss tips in flour before adding to pan and to cut out the salt. Glad I did but we ended up using very little salt  afterward. Because of flour toss, didnt have to add corn starch to thicken. Thanks for a winner recipe that hubby loves!

The recipe was perfect with a few modifications. I didn't add salt, pepper or the extra cup of water for the gravy as other reviewers had noted. I also doubled the garlic powder. I added the gravy mix to meat and let it simmer for 15 minutes to allow it to thicken. I would definitely make it again!

This was a great recipe. I made it exactly as written, except that the several brands of gravy mix I saw in my store were all .87 oz. and not .75 oz. I used some extra-lean beef stew meat and it came out wonderfully tender. I did think the recipe used too much water, though, as there was a lot of liquid after 1.5 hours of simmering (and keeping it covered all that time, as the recipe said, didn't help). I then did step 4 (adding the gravy), and it still took quite a while for the gravy to reduce noticeably. I ate this over cooked rice, for three consecutive dinners, and enjoyed it greatly. I do see, in a couple of reviews here, that some reviewers thought this was too salty. I guess I can agree with that, so if I make this again, I'd skip the 1 teaspoon of salt, and even use low-sodium soy sauce (and maybe less of it, too). But overall, I can highly recommend this recipe.

I LOVED this recipe. I threw everything in the slow cooker on high for 3 hours. I did not brown the meat first, I used minced garlic rather than garlic salt and I used 1 cup of red wine and 1 cup of water instead of 2 cups of water. The meat was so tender and the taste was fantastic. Thanks!

I followed this recipe exactly except I only had time to simmer the meat for an hour. It turned out great! I didn't think it was too salty at all. The gravy didn't seem too thin either. I served with mashed potatoes and it was a big hit with my husband and kids.

I made this tonight and my husband and myself loved this! I did follow some of the other users comments and floured the beef very lightly and left out the salt. This will be a keeper in our home for sure!

Made this for a bunch of guys who were doing outside work on my house.  Cold, windy day and thought this might hit the spot.  It was easy enough to make.  I used Bragg's amino acid instead of soy sauce.  Based on another review I added the brown gravy mix without the water.  Still tasted pretty salty. I also used fresh mushrooms. It was good and the boys liked/appreciated it.  Would really like to reduce the salty taste tho. (didn't add the suggested 1 t.) Will make again and continue to tweak.

Yes. I have tried this recipe. Followed it to a T.  First time with egg noodles, second time rice. Really tasty and delicious. I prefer the rice over the noodles. My family loves this recipe. I give it a 41/2 out of 5.

This is a nice &simple recipe that gives you much bang for minimal effort.  I heeded other reviewers' warnings about salt & skipped the worsch &soy sauce.  I basically browned (just 1 lb of) the beef as instructed & then deglazed the pan with 1/4 c white wine. I then added the additional 3/4 c of liquid in the form of water. Once that thickened with the brown gravy mix I added the beef back into the pan & simmered for about 45 minutes.  I combined a few ideas from Chef John's Classic Beef Stroganoff recipe as I made this one.I think that how much liquid you put in the pan should be dictated by how long you plan to let it simmer...I ended up having to add another tbsp each of water& wine towards the end to give myself a bit more sauce. I will absolutely make this again...the recipe is pretty versatile as far as add-ins & side dishes & spices go. I would like to try to add some different spices-this time I just used garlic. This would be really good over mashed potatoes with a side of Yorkshire pudding.

My family loved this dish.  My 10 y/o daughter said she would like this for her birthday dinner.  I didn't have a gravy mix handy but used a crock pot roast seasoning packet instead.  I also added 2 tbls flour to the gravy mix.

Good comfort food, very tender, I served it over rice. I substituted 1 can of beef stock for part of the water and used a can of mushroom soup instead of the dry gravy mix. It would be good with mash potatoes and biscuits too.

Made this last night and my husband LOVED it. I floured my meat before browning. Slight change was that I did not have any brown gravy mix so I just used some gravy master and wonder. Simmered for 1 hour and the meat was so tender. I served over mashed potatoes. Next time I am going to add mushrooms and use low salt soy sauce, because there will definitely be a next time.

The roommate has multiple food allergies so I have to adapt almost every recipe to some extent.  Cornstarch is definitely out.  I did find some gravy mix made in the UK that is safe and, because I used that, I did not add any salt to the rest of the dish.  Otherwise, it was really good.

previous reviewers are right! This is SALTY!! I'm a salt-a-holic - I mean, I sprinkle salt on my plate and dip my meat in it. Yeah, I love salt. So I opted to ignore reviewer advice and not cut out salt.... And that was a bad mistake! It's waaaaay tooo salty! My 5 year old son thanked me for his salt dinner. Yeah, it was that bad. Aside from the salt, it was great. I used fresh mushrooms & garlic. And I cut out 1 1/4 cups of water, and used 1/4 cup merlot. I also added some frozen peas & carrots when I added the gravy mixture. I also added a T of cornstarch to help it thicken. I served it over white rice. I will make it again, but I will leave out the extra salt AND use low-sodium soy sauce. In hindsight, maybe it was the cup less of water that amplified the salt??? But it didn't need more liquid - there was plenty of gravy to feed my family of 5, with leftovers for Daddy to take to work.

This was wonderful!  I was looking for a recipe just like this for making freezer meals.  I used chuck steak which worked great.  The gravy was rich and flavorful.  Also served it over  mashed potatoes - yum!

This was easy and good.  It was a bit on the salty side so I might look for a low sodium gravy mix next time.  We did use low sodium soy already.  Added fresh mushrooms and served over mashed potatoes.

I also used the crockpot, making this an easy weeknight meal.  I did not add salt or use the vegetable oil.  I used a total of 1/4 cup of soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce mixed together and about 1 cup of water.  I cooked at low for 8 hours and then mixed the gravy mix with 1/2 cup water and stirred it in.  The gravy was not quite as thick as I liked, so I mixed a little corn starch with water and stirred it in and it thickened up perfectly.  The family said they really enjoyed this.

I always love the soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce combo. You can never go wrong with it. It makes a fantastic gravy. So I knew right away this would be a hit! We served ours with mashed potatoes and veggies. I also eliminated the salt. There is also no need to cook that long, 30 min TOPS. Great recipe.

Like all of the above comments, there is entirely too much salt in this dish.  The next time i make it, i will not put any additional salt in. The Soy Sauce is full of Sodium, and secondly, you can always add salt to it as you eat it.  
Other than the Salt issue, this was an excellent recipe, the beef turned out tender.  I used Egg Noodles with it.

My family and friends really enjoyed this recipe.  I had to make some adjustments because I didn't have all the ingredients and was short on time so I couldn't run out to get the missing things.  I used the basic seasonings in Worcestershire sauce because we didn't have any.  I made 4 lbs. because we were having several guests.  All in all, it was worth the little effort!  Thanks to denisef for submitting it!

My husband called it "Excellent" - more than once!! I loved it too. I basically followed the recipe but halved the recipe.  Floured meat before browning. Used low sodium soy sauce and jarred minced garlic.  Omitted salt. Added 1/3 cup of 2% milk toward the end of cooking time. NO corn starch needed. The amount of cooking time really depends on the quality of the beef. I had to cook mine longer than called for; I guess the stew meat from my grocery was not from the most tender cuts. 

These are really minor personal preferrance changes; this is a 5-star recipe! No canned soup involved!

Served over Mahatma yellow rice with a salad, and white bread to sop up the gravy. Next time, I will make biscuits to go with it. Superb!

I made this recipe totally vegan. I was having a difficult time finding a good "beefy" gravy recipe and used this one. I added mushrooms and used veggie broth instead of water. I did not add salt. I used "Gardein Beefless Tips", which are yummy. I added flour and water to thicken the gravy and added two jars of mushroom gravy. I also added a few teaspoons of "Gravy Master". Added a little margarine for a bit of fat. Although I have not eaten meat in over 20 years, this reminded me of REAL gravy. If that makes sense. Good Luck!!!!

These were so tender. I did make a few changes but nothing that I think changes the flavor of the meal. I just used garlic instead of garlic powder and I used a TBS. I did not add the salt or the extra cup of water. I like a thicker sauce. I added a little flour at the end to thicken the sauce up to what I like. I added a can of mushrooms in  when I added the dry gravy mix. I cooked mine for an hour and half, that was plenty.

This is one of my families favorite.  However, instead of garlic powder I use 2 cloves of fresh garlic, and I do omit the salt.

I made this tonight... But I too changed a few things. I floured my beef (seasoned flour with pepper only) I also added sliced baby potabella mushrooms. I also did not add soy and only a dash of worchestershire sauce (too keep from being too salty) I also used reduced sodium gravy mix for the same reason. After I browned the beef I added 1/4 cup red wine to deglaze pot. I also added cream of mushroom soup and unsalted beef stock (not broth) to cook the meat mixture. Then the last 30 mins i used 1/4 cup of heavy cream and the gravy mix, and because I had some tyme on hand I added it too. It came out so good! This is a very good base recipe to make your own! Thanks for the recipe denisef.

Made this for dinner tonight served over egg noodles.  The only change I made was to omit the salt and simmered about 3 hours because I got side tracked.  Smelled really good while cooking, meat was fork tender and I enjoyed the bite from the amount of pepper in there.  I will definitely make this one again.

Great flavor.  Just too salty (and I love salt!).  Served over mashed potatoes - so yummy.  Will definitely be making again.

Tweaked the recipe a bit. I added minced garlic & mushrooms while browning meat Also black pepper. Added 1 can beef broth, cut 2 cups water to 3/4 & added 1/4 cup red wine. cut soy sauce & Worcestershire sauce to 1/8 cup each. Omited salt & before serving thickened juice w/corn starch to make gravy. Turned out perfect. Will make again.

I liked it, I always try to make it exactly as written, but I'm a garlic fiend and add a tablespoon of minced garlic to EVERYTHING! So I sauteed the onions with garlic as well as adding the garlic powder. The recipe was good, but it was so very salty, I can't justify giving it 5 stars. Don't get me wrong, I love salt, but it was a little overboard and I woke up puffy and inflated the next morning! Next time I won't add the salt or the garlic powder at all and I might cut down on the soy sauce a bit as well. Very tasty besides the saltiness.

Used Mom's Brown Gravy recipe to make this. Did it all in the crockpot. Omitted the tsp of salt and onion. Serving with noodles and corn on the cob. My husband actually liked this which surprised me because it seemed too simple but that's okay! I'll be making it again, adding some things perhaps but still making it again. :)

This was simply AMAZING!  I scaled the recipe down to make 3 servings and every bit was gone! My husband really loved it as well.  I am making this for a Masonic dinner and I KNOW the guys will enjoy it very much.  Definitely worth the wait time!!!

I prepared this for dinner tonight. My wife and I did not care for it too much. It has too much soy sauce and worceshire. That is all we could taste. I used low sodium evrything and omitted salt and still too salty.

My family loved this recipe!  However, just like some other reviewers have mentioned, it does taste a bit too salty.  I will definitely make this again, but will use low-sodium soy sauce and nix the tsp of salt.  Also, if you like a thicker sauce, just add some cornstarch (mixed with a little cold water) and stir a couple of minutes before serving.

We Loved this but I did double the water, soy sauce, worcestershire.  Coated the meat in flour and only added on pack of dry brown gravy mix with one cup of water.  My kids even loved this.

4.5 stars from my family.  I only had 1.7 pounds of beef tips, so I added a Tyson pre-cooked roast, cubed.  The next time I will use about 3 pounds of stew meat as there was A LOT of liquid.  I used cornstarch to thicken.  I will also serve it over egg noodles.

This is so yummy! I did do a couple things different...I added two packets of brown gravy mix, one packet with a cup of water and one without. I think next time I will do both packets with no extra water as it was a little runny. I also added sliced mushrooms as well. I also will not add the salt next time as its plenty salty enough...and one more thing I did two tsp garlic powder! I served it over rice and it was delicious! I will definetly make this again and next time maybe put it over noodles! Yum!

This was awesome! I did a few modifications, though. I left out the garlic powder and the salt but I did add one beef boullion cube with the 2 cups of water, plus added only about 2/3 of the worcestershire sauce that the recipe called for. I cooked this for about an hour and the meat was very tender. I'll definitely make this one again!

This was a great recipe. My family loved it. My husband asked when I was going to make it again. I didn't change the recipe at all. It was easy to make. I think next time the only thing I would try different is to make it all up and cook it in the slow cooker. So, the meat would be a little more tender.

Made this for my parents anniversary, they loved it and so did my husband when I fixed it for Valentines Day.  Very easy to make.  I used low sodium soy sauce for low sodium and no salt at all.  Didn't have to season much after it was done except a little pepper.  We will definately be doing this one again!

I substituted a bit of red wine and malty beer for some of the water and used tender beef steak (you use what you have). It turned out great and tasted like the Steak & Stein's steak tips, which is exactly what I was going for.

I followed the instructions exactly except I left out the salt. My husband said this was ok, but asked if I could make this again, but put it in the slow cooker and add veggies. The sauce was nice, but a little salty. I'll try this again making the changes.

Good recipe. Since previous reviews indicated the dish was too salty I cut the soy sauce down to 1 TBSP. I didn't have the gravy packet so I dredged my meat in flour prior to browning it and it created a nice and thick gravy. The taste was different and interesting.

This was super easy to make, my son, husband, and brother liked it....made w/ fresh grated garlic, in butter.  I also cooked w/ Tbl.of cornstarch and beef broth instead of water.  Salt was fine. Thanks!

I made this exactly. This was super yummy and talk about easy!  Lots of flavor.  I would cut back on the pepper next time. I also had to add a cup of water about  1 hour after cooking as most of the liquid had cooked down. I cooked it for 1 1/2 hours and it was nice and tender. I also added a package of fresh mushrooms.  Made it in my electric skillet. Served over egg noodles.  This is a keeper.  Will try it with rice next time.

These were so good. I made this in the slowcooker. Through everything in except last cup of water. I thickened it on the stove with cornstarch at the end. Served with mashed potatoes and peas. Yummo.

Good flavor... but very salty, I'd probably cut the soy sauce in half and double the Worcestershire sauce... and not use the extra salt

My entire family loves this! After cooking the meat, I drain the sauce in a sauce pan and add water to bowl my egg noodles in.  I then add 2 packages pioneer gravy mix to the meat.  I also added mushrooms. It is really good. Thanks for sharing

I've tried several other beef tip recipes and the meat always turns out dry, but this recipe kept the meat very juicy and tender! I think my husband ate 3 bowls of it! Only thing I stupidly added the gravy mixture in all at the same time (wasn't paying attention to directions)So the gravy never thickened up but it was still yummy! Served over rice.  If you do like me and dont end up w/ thick gravy, the juice makes an excellent beef broth for other meals.

I made this last night on a whim b/c we accidentally thawed out beef tips. I left out the onion and the extra salt and it was really good. Served over mashed potatoes with some fresh green beans on the side. Let it simmer for an hour and a half due to last minute scrambling to prepare the dish! The meat was tender and it was oddly addicting. Maybe it was the salt that kept us piling the second helpings on!

this is really good, but at the end when you add the brown gravy, add 8oz tube of sour cream it thickens up the sauce and adds a great taste to it. my family loves it and this is how my mom use to make it.

Wonderful flavors, but made changes.  Omit soy sauce and use only 3TBLS. Worcestershire sauce. Added "better than Bouillon mushroom base to 1 cup water and other cup low sodium beef broth.  added gravy mix in the last thirty minutes of cooking. served over buttered herb noodles, but kids prefer mashed potatoes. YUMMMM!!!

Very easy to prepare and very yummy! I did not cook mine as long as recommended, and the meat was not super tender, but I did not have to time to let it simmer. Next time I will cook longer or even try it in the slow cooker.

My whole family loved this recipe!  The first words out of my daughter's mouth was that the meat cut like butter.  I always say that I'm not good at cooking any type of red meat but this was so easy to make and for once I didn't have chewy meat!  Note: I did not add salt because the soy and worcestershire sauces have enough.

It was great. A little on the salty side that's with using low sodium soy sauce so next time I'll cut out salt all together. Wasn't thick enough at the end so I added some flour and it was perfect think next time I'll just not add so much water!

I made this recipe for dinner exactly as printed and it was horrible. It was too salty even for me, and I love salt.  Also the recipe calls for too much soy sauce. It should be much less. My husband hated it so needless to say I will not make it again.

This recipe was simply marvelous. I am a very low level cook and was able to follow the instructions to the letter. My meal was not salty in the least. I am so happy, because this is the first thing I've cooked that actually came out how I imagined.

Way too salty and too much worcestershire sauce. Next time I would not add the extra salt and add the worcestershire sauce a tablespoon at a time until it was to my liking.

I also dumped this in the crock pot to cook all day.  It made enough for leftovers.  My husband loved it with mashed potatoes the first day and buttered egg noodles the second day.  Great recipe.

Very good.  I had some leftover better cuts of meat, so I didn't need to cook as long.  I used roasted garlic instead of garlic powder, and threw in some broccoli and a little hot sauce right before serving.  I served over egg noodles.  Teenage boys and husband gave thumbs up.  Thanks!

I didn't cook as long as the recipe called for as I ran out of time.  The meat was not as tender as it should have been.  I will try again and cook the recommended time.

I took the advise of others and lowered the amount of soy sauce and worcestshire.  It was still too much.  Next time I'll put less than half the amount required.  There wasn't enough gravy for me so I put in twice as much as called for at the end.  Otherwise, it was tasty.  The beef was tender and it went great over egg noodles.  Will make again.

This is one of those so-so recipes for me.  I love crockpot recipes for their simplicity, but I'm often left kind of mid-range in the outcome.  This was not different.  While the taste was ok, it wasn't anything extraordinary.  I have other recipes for beef tips that my family prefers and will probably just use one of those from now on.  Thanks!

Wow. I feel bad giving this review, because I usually try to be nice. I just do not see how this is getting such good ratings. We took the advice and eliminated the extra salt, I used low-salt soy sauce, and I eliminated the extra water at the end. I ended up with beef tips that were far too salty to eat and way too runny. I had high hopes for this recipe because it sounded wonderful with all of the modifications.  I do NOT recommend this.

I have made this a few times now and never have left overs. The meat is so tender it almost melts in your mouth. I mix mine with cooked and drained egg noodles. And it's very easy to make.

My daughter absolutely loved this dish! I didn't have onions on hand but I had garlic, so I sauteed minced garlic in the first step and added onion powder instead of garlic powder later. I think I'll skip the salt next time because the soy sauce is plenty salty for my taste. We ate this over low-carb noodles and it was delicious, but I think it would be even better over rice. Thanks for the great recipe!

Great idea to use a cheaper cut of meat!  We loved it, served over egg noodles and I used beef broth instead of water and added a bag of frozen peas towards the end, oh and browned pieces in seasoned flour before adding to crock pot.  Try it, you will be impressed!!!  NO LEFTOVERS in my house of four!

Great recipe, but I had to tweek it A LOT!!  I read the reviews and was warned about the saltiness.  I cut the soy sauce in half and the Worcestershire by a third.  I used 2 packets of brown gravy and one packet of onion gravy when I added the water.  I did NOT add any salt and cup the pepper by half.  I also added fresh mushroom which was the perfect touch!! I cooked it for 3 hours and, with all the changes, it was WONDERFUL.  Great starter recipe, but I can't imagine using it as is.

Very good and super simple.  Great way to use stew meat not for stew.  My kids thought it too "hot" so I will cut down on the pepper next time.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars for ease a preparation and taste.  This makes a wonderful family night supper.  I omitted the oil to save fat calories.  I did not add any water, but added about 1 cup of beer.  At the end of the cooking time, I added about 3 tablespoons of arrowroot (healthier than cornstarch) shaken vigorously with 1/4 cup of water, to the beef tips and allowed to simmer until thickened.  We served this over rice.

Yummy, I loved this recipe. I didn't add the extra salt. I decided to make it a slow cooker meal and turned out great. I did have to thicken it up with some cornstarch.

This is a great recipe.  It smells wonderful while cooking.  I didn't use the salt or garlic powder, and had low-sodium soy sauce.  It was just right.

Gave it a three because although it's not really bad.. there was nothing special ab0ut it.. what i did was simmer the beef for 30 mins (just so the beef would absorb the flavor) then transferred it to the pressure co0ker where i gave it another 30 mins. to co0k.. it was oh-so tender! :)

The beef was very tender after cooking it for 3 hours.  The kids thought it was too Spicy so will use less pepper next time.  Way salty so will not add the salt.  Did add some flour to the sauce to thicken it up.

I read all the reviews prior to making this dish and kept an open mind.  The pepper was way too much and this was way too salty.  We even eliminated the salt completely.  In addition, we tried adding some sour cream to offset the saltiness.  This did work, but not enough to say I liked it.  Despite all of this, I loved the simplicity of the recipe.  Great concept, not great taste.

I'm giving this 3 stars because I did not follow the recipe and I don't think it would have been good if I had.  As it was, I was very happy with the meat.

I used 1/8 cup of regular soy sauce, and a little bit under 1/4 cup of Worcestershire.  I did not add any salt.  I used Wondra flour dissolved in cold water to thicken the liquid.

I cooked it for almost 3 hrs in a dutch oven on the stovetop and it turned out lovely.

These were great!  I used 1/8 lite soy sauce, 1/4 c. Worcestershire, dash of Liquid Smoke and did not add any salt as others have suggested.  The Liquid Smoke gave it a great flavor (don't put very much!) I also seasoned the meat with pepper and garlic powder before I browned it.  Will definitely make again.

I loved how tender the meat was, but it was way too salty.  I made it exactly like the recipe.  I think with all the other ingredients which have salt in them already, the teaspoon of salt is just way too much.  I will try this again and omit salt - I bet it will be a lot better.  We really would have liked it except for the salt thing.

This was edible, but not my favorite. Definitely not gourmet. Seemed like a "hamburger helper" type meal. I can't put my finger on it but the sauce flavor was off. I think it was either the brown gravy mix or the soy sauce--maybe the combo of the two. It just tasted a little off. Not beefy and flavorful. Won't make it again.

I have used this recipe, (substitue onion powder for onion) as a marinade for venison.  Do not cook.  Combine all ingredients and let rest in marinade overnight.  Great on the grill!

I tried this with egg noodles.  Added mushrooms and sour cream at the end of the cooking time....it was great!!!

This is going to become a staple recipe for my family.  I used an electric skillet rather than my stove.  It can go with just about anything.  I served this with rice and steamed broccoli, and my whole family loved it.  Easy and yummy!

The aroma from this dish is great and I would double the onions because I snacked on them while it was cooking.  This is slightly bland but its good for a cold day.  I don't really like the brown gravy mix.  I am still playing with it.

Wow! I made this for 90 people tonight and was it ever a hit! The gravy was out of this world. I did however, do something a bit different simply because I had such a large amount to make.  I used the grill with very little oil on it for the browning of beef and onions. This really cut down on the oil. 'Tones' sells a brown gravy mix in the spice section that I used for the dry mix and it thickened very nicely. You have 90 positive 5 stars here!

My husband Really liked this, and even the kids ate it.  Only added 1/2 the onion, (not big onion lovers in my household), but kept everything else the same.  Was out of rice, and served over mashed potatoes, which was also good.

This recipe is great! So easy to make. I used a bit less pepper and salt, but still enjoyed the peppery flavor. I had no problem with the thickening. I added the gravy about 5 minutes before serving. We ate it over garlic mashed potatoes. Delish!!!

Am I the only one who was confussed by what she meant by MEANWHILE combine the gravy with water? I didn't know when to add it, but looks like I was in the same boat with everyone else that said it was not thick enough. It still tasted very good. Served over egg noodles, but next time I will try serving it over mashed potatoes as seen in other reviews.

I rated this "the Best!" because my finicky 8 year old ate it up!  That was a mircle.  Like others, I omitted the salt altogether and only used 1/8 teaspoon of peppers.  I also added portabella mushrooms.  UMMMMMMM delish!!!

Incredibly bland even though I added garlic and oregano. I did as other reviewers mentioned and added corn starch to thicken this up....still seemed too thin though. I cut the water mixed with the gravy in hopes of a thicker sauce. It didn't help and I actually thought the taste was too "brown gravyish". Sorry, but I can't recommend this one.

this was quite nice although i did cut down on the amount of pepper, which still turned out to be relatively 'peppery'. also added some veg to it and used beef broth mixed with flour to thicken the sauce. hubby loved it! will definitely cook this dish again! thanks denise!

This was very simple to make.  The flavor is excellent!  My sauce did not thicken, so I added 2 tbs of cornstarch mixed with 1/2 cup of water.  The results were perfect!

These turned out excellent.  I didn't cook the meat, instead put all the ingredients except the oil and the 3rd cup of water into a slow cooker and cooked it all on high for 4-5 hours.  Had to add some cornstarch dissolved in cold water at the end to thicken it a bit, but the meat was very tender and sauce was great!

I gave this a 4 stars solely because it was too thin.  Like previous reviewers, I added more brown gravy mix and less water.  The taste is wonderful so this change made it PERFECT!

I followed the suggestions of other reviewers & omitted the salt & used a bit less soy sauce.  Also, instead of the gravy mixture, I sifted all-purpose flour into heated beef broth, wisked it & then added that to the meat mixture.  Everyone loved it ... even the toddlers!

This was simple and good! I dont mind the idea of using packaged ingredients(such as the gravy mix) I think it is helpful and makes your meals seem more homecooked with less effort.  This was delicious, my boyfriend was scraping the plate!

this was awesome, and even better the next day for lunch - very easy to make and good. I browned the stew meat in a little flour first, and this helped to thicken up the sauce a little.  Will definitely make again -

I didn't add the extra salt and should've known it would be too salty.  My husband liked it enough...but we had leftovers and he never touched them.  We both liked it better with a dollup of Sour cream on it.

This was very tasty and welcomed by all.  I used half the amount of worchestire and soy sauce and it was not too salty.  I also added an 8 oz package of fresh sliced mushrooms after I browned the beef, right before adding 2 cups water.  It seems like too much water, but if you cook it right it will reduce.  I also added one teaspoon of dry mustard and a few dashes of hot sauce with the garlic and pepper (omitted salt).  Try it!

This recipe was full of flavor. I took the advice of others and used low sodium soy sauce and skipped the salt. It was still pretty salty.  I added sauteed mushrooms before serving and served over mashed potatoes.  I will make again.

I excluded the teasspoon of salt like recommended by the other reviews, but I think after trying the recipe I'll cut the teaspoon of pepper in half. Also, I only used half of a onion, and the meat came out nice and tender. I will try this again!

Very good. I suggest throwing some veggies in to this and you will have bona fide beef stew. I made this one night and ate it the next and it was still prefect. Thanks!

This is a good recipe.  Quick, easy preparation. I, too, was concerned that the meat would be chewy with the short cooking time.  But it wasn't.  It was actually tender.  I omitted the teaspoon of salt and added an additional pkg. gravy mix. It turned out perfectly.  My family loved it.

I subbed 40 pre-cooked meatballs for the beef tips (what can I say, I have a 10lb bag of meatballs in the freezer!) and shortened the cooking time to a bit under an hour.  The sauce/gravy was a bit on the sweet side, so I may cut down on the Wor. sauce next time.  But, other than that, pretty tasty (I left out the salt and ALWAYS use low sodium soy sauce).  Served over mashed potatoes.

I had to substitute Gravy Bouquet for the soy sauce (my son is allergic to it) and it came out great.  The kids love it and I never have leftovers!  Thanks for sharing!!!

Very salty recipe - next time I will cut the Worchestire & Soy Sauces by 1/3 then add beef broth to the rest so it won't be as salty.

Great dinner, kind of gourmet but very easy. I didn't mix the gravy with water, I just mixed it into the cooking juices and added a bit of flour. Kinda salty, I'd leave out additional salt next time or maybe add the extra water....

I was looking for a recipe that would rival those wedding dinner beef tips and this one was the ticket! It even made the beef stew meat just as tender.

I used some leftover (already cooked) roast for this recipe.  I also used a dry gravy mix for cream gravy (normally used for chicken fried steak or biscuits).  Since I did not simmer the meat but 15 mins I cut the water down when I added the gravy mix to just over 1/4 cup (there was still alot of liquid in the pan).  I also omitted the salt and still found the recipe a tad bit too salty for us.  It was tasty though.  Thanks for the inspiration and helping me to use up some leftovers. :)

I don't know what happened but my sauce was really thin. I could not get it to thicken. The beef was really good. It was so tender. The sauce had no flavor. I used low salt soysauce, I wish I did'nt because I had to add salt to my plate afterwards. I don't think I will make this again.

This recipe is fabulous!  I only cooked for two people so I cut the amount of meat, soy sauce, and worcestershire sauce in half, but keep the gravy recipe the same.  Also, I used a minced glove of garlic in place of the garlic salt.  Reheats well!

I was so disappointed with this recipe! I found it entirely too salty, and that has never happened before. I added an extra packet of gravy mix as suggested, but I found that it still had too much liquid. Sorry, but I won't try this again.

This is a very good recipe!  I served it over rice and really enjoyed it.  I didn't have gravy mix so I substituted a roux with some milk.  Also substituted 1 cup of red wine for 1 cup of the water. Added a little thyme, too.

The meat came out very tender and was perfect with rice. Was a bit too peppery, next time I might add less. Takes a while but it's worth it.

I made this recipe last night and it was great!!!  I used my crockpot and I added some bell pepper and fresh mushrooms.  I did not agree with this recipe being too salty.  It was just right!  My husband loved it and ate three helpings!  Thanks, Denise, for giving us this great, but simple recipe!  I will definately make this again!!!

I thought this had way too much pepper when I followed the recipe.  I make it all the time but I leave out the salt and pepper and cut the Worcestershire sauce in half.  Also, if you don't want to use a gravy mix, I add beef bullion and then thicken it with corn starch mixed In cold water.

Excellent. I'm making this for the third time tonight.  I use sirloin tip steak instead of stew meat. Melts in you mouth!

My family definately liked it. It was very easy.  I agree with the person putting it in the crockpot-I'm going to try that next time.  Thanks!

It was very easy to make, but turned out a little too strong for my family's taste.
