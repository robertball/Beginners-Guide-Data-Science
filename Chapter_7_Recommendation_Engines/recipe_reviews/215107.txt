I was very excited about this drink for a Willy Wonka themed party I was having. I took the time to infuse my own bubblegum vodka and strawberry vodka. While the drink was very tasty, I feel like I could have made something similar with far less effort and fewer ingredients. It was a little tough to appreciate all the different flavors at the same time

After finding this recipe I demanded an immediate trip for the ingredients. I now have to find a use for them since I found the drink anything but lifting.
