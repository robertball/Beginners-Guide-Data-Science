My boyfriend loved this and I will make it again. I did make a couple of changes and when I do make it again I'll make one or two more. This time, I added real mushrooms because it's hard for me to call something "mushroom meatloaf" if the only mushrooms are in canned soup. So I added chopped cremini mushrooms to the meat mixture and sliced ones to the sauce. I omitted the onion soup mix because I thought it would be too salty (and I don't like the ingredients in those mixes), but as a result it wasn't quite salty enough. :-) So next time I'll add some Italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt and pepper. But as I said, even without those I liked it and the BF thought it was really, really good.
