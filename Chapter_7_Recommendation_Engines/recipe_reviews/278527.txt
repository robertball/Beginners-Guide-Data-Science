2.11.20  Few things beat the ever-popular combination of cinnamon-apple, and they partner particularly well in oatmeal.  The cooking time was spot on because it didn’t allow the apples to cook to mush, they were perfect with just a little crunch.  The consistency was way too thick for us, so I did add quite a bit more milk to thin it out, but oatmeal consistency is something that’s personal preference.  Quick and easy breakfast, packed with deliciousness.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.
