This was the BEST!!  I added crumb nut topping (1/3C flour, 1/4C packed brown sugar, 3T melted butter) then drizzled a glaze (powdered sugar, vanille extract, milk).  It was AWESOME!!

I made this for Christmas morning and everyone loved it!  Very moist and tasty.....I added a orange glaze to the top made with powdered sugar and orange juice....it was a good complement to the cranberry.  Will make this one again!

This recipe was great!  I used my leftover "cranberry sauce extraordinaire" from this website and it was great!  I made it for a group of friends and they loved how I used up the extra cranberry "sauce" from Thanksgiving!  The pecans in the cranberry mixture really added something and I also put a crumb mixture on top (1/3 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup flour, 3 Tbsp melted butter, 1tsp cinnamon).  After I put the topping on the cake I realized I had forgotten to swirl the cranberry/cake mixture. So, I just gently did it anyway and the crumb topping ended up incorporated into the cake which even made it better!  I would definitely make this again and swirl after adding the crumb top.  Very moist and great taste.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

Okay, I read, I learned, I baked, and I am totally satisfied! I used an 8x8 square glass dish, I added 2 tsp. of vanilla (suggested by someone else), I didn't have almond extract so I used amaretto liquer, I used an entire 16 oz. can of whole cranberry sauce (also not my original idea), and I added the crumb topping. YUMMO! My husband and I have just about finished this off, and I made it TWO days ago. If you put the crumb topping on (1/3 c. flour, 1/4 c. brown sugar, 3TBSP butter) right away, you may have to cover your cake with foil halfway thru baking to prevent burning. Also, I think mine went almost a full hour with the extra cran. sauce, so be sure to check all the way to the bottom of the pan when testing for doneness. Enjoy, and thank you Laura Owen!

This turns out great if you follow the recipe exactly-use a regular can of whole cranberry sauce mixed so it spreads easier- I used a lightly oiled and floured bundt pan, poured 1/2 of the batter in added all the cranberry sauce and topped it with the rest of the batter. I baked about 5 min less than it called for about 50 min. COOL 10 min. before turning out of bundt pan onto a serving plate. It doesn't need glaze but it would look nice to sprinkle it with powdered sugar or make a light glaze when it cools and is on a plate for serving.

This really is the best coffee cake!  It needs no icing...perfect just like it is.  My husband, not usually big on sweets, requests this ALL the time and even asked me to make it for him to take to work.  I make 1 1/4 times the amount of batter though because the recipe didn't seem to make enough.

I made this for a neighbor who had surgery.  I gave him his favorties coffee beans and 1/2 of this cake.  I am glad that I saved some for my family.  I wouldn't have known how dry it was. Watch your baking time carefully.  It depends on the size of pan you choose to use.  My neighbors wife returned my platter with her "version" of this recipe.  WOW!  It included the streusel topping and slivered almonds on top.  She made hers in a 9" rd cake pan.  It is so pretty and you may serve a wedge any size you choose. There could be so many variations with this filling recipe, let your imagination go, or just use what you have on hand.

I was looking through my recipes that I had printed out and put in a folder and came across this one yesterday. Like so many of my cookbooks, it was something that looked good, but I never got around to making. I wanted to bring dessert to my friend's home last evening for dinner, and decided to make this. Needless to say, I was a little nervous  bringing a dessert that I had never made or tasted before.  Well, as you know......."NOT TO WORRY!"......It was absolutely delicious! Nothing but raves from all of us! Everyone wanted the recipe. This will most certainly be on my list of take alongs and any time I am asked to make dessert. Thank you, Laura, for sharing this wonderful treat. May God truly bless your holiday!....Mary Anne Dowling

I made this and I only think I got 2 small pieces, my husband ate the rest!!!...LOL  We both loved it!!... I didnt have the almond extract so I used 2 teasp of Vanilla and also added about 1/2 teasp of Cinnamon...and I dusted the cake very lightly with powdered sugar when it was cooled... Very good the next day warmed in the microwave for a few seconds with a little dab of butter... I know this will be on my Thanksgiving and Xmas tables this year...

Oh wow, was this ever good!! I decided to try this  as part of our Christmas Brunch this year and I was not disappointed. Per other reviews stating it did not bake up very high. I recalculated it for 19 servings. Don't bother with the extra teaspoon of butter or the extra tablespoon of flour called for in the recalculation. I also used 3 whole eggs instead of 2-3/4 eggs called for in the recalculation. I baked it in my favorite old aluminm "Bundt" pan. It baked right to the top perfectly in 50 minutes. I used most of a 14 ounce can of the whole berry cranberry sauce. I was afraid to use the whole can.  Next time I think I will  try the whole can...and there will definitely be a next time. I finished off with a simple glaze of confectionery sugar, orange juice and orange zest after the cake was completely cool. The zest is what gave the glaze its flavor. I baked the cake on the morning of Christmas Eve and glazed the cake on Christmas morning. The cake was not in the least dry. One hint: As soon as removing from the pan, (after cooling in the pan about 15 minutes), I wrapped plastic wrap around the cake while still hot and left it like that (eventually putting the cake dome over the top) until the next morning and then glazed the cake. For those of you not too fond of cranberries, do not let that stop you from trying this recipe. The cranberry taste is very understated. Just a wonderful, wonderful recipe. Thanks you so much for sharing Laura!

Delicious cake!  I did increase the ingredients by 1/4 as recommended by another review, plus added 1 c. chopped pecans to the batter.  I used Cran-Fruit for Chicken instead of a can of cranberry sauce because that was what I had on hand.  It comes in two flavors -- Cranberry-Raspberry and Cranberry-Orange.  I used the raspberry.  I took the cake out after 50 minutes and it was slightly overdone, so will try 40-45 minutes next time.

This is very tasty.  I had leftover homemade cranberry sauce, so I used that in the bread.  Very moist and flavorful.  Based on other reviews I increased the ingredients by 50% so I could fill the entire bundt pan. It has a nice presentation and a nice mild flavor.  Will definitely make again!

What a great cake!  Moist and delicious with just the right balance of tartness and sweetness.  I used nonfat plain yogurt instead of sour cream and used freshly made cranberry sauce instead of canned. Perfect for the holidays and all year round.

This cake was delicious! I made it for thanksgiving and my family especially loved it with their coffee. I put a little less almond flavoring, as a few reviews commented on the strong almond taste, and added a bit of vanilla. It was delicious. Also, I had no idea what a tube pan was and so I could not find one. It turned out fine in a square cake pan, with just batter,sauce,batter. thanks!

This cake was delicious! I made it the day before Thanksgiving to have it on the day of. I used a 16 oz can of whole berry cranberry sauce and it turned out perfect. I think I should have refridgerated it though. (not sure).

I took the cake out of the oven 10 minutes early & it was already overbaked.  The batter was very thick (it didn't pour) & there didn't seem to be enough batter to make that many layers, so I just did batter, cranberry, batter.  I wasn't impressed with the cake (though it's probably much better when it isn't overbaked!) but I thought the cranberry sauce made a great filling.

Love this! I really like cranberry, so that may be why I'm partial to this. The cake part is very moist, which is nice. I used jellied cranberry sauce instead of whole and just broke it up with a for to make it more smooth instead of can shape :). I also omitted the almond extract the second time I made this, which I found to be more enjoyable. The first time I followed the 3 layers of batter and two layers of cranberry, but the second time I only did two layers of batter and one layer of cranberry, which gave me bigger sections of cranberry flavor throughout, which I liked better. Thanks for a great recipe!

This cake is absolutely the best!!! I've made this several times and people always rave about it.  I can't express enough how EXCELLENT this cake is.  EVERYONE always asks for the recipe. It turns out moist and soooo delicious. I love to bring things I've baked in to work and try out new recipes on my co-workers.  They have requested this cake so many times, I don't get much chance to try other recipes.  This is a definite keeper!!!!

We have been baking this cake for 40 years. Some hints: Make sure your baking powder is fresh. Try not to get the cranberry sauce close to the edge of the pan - it sticks like glue. If you don't have a non-stick pan, line the bottom with waxed paper. Make an icing with confectioner's sugar, almond extract and a little milk and drizzle it over the top. We always get rave reviews for this cake.

Loved it! Had to substitute Greek vanilla yogurt for the sour cream and it was perfect. I also added orange zest to the dough and used homemade cranberry orange jam in place of the canned sauce. It takes so much self control to eat just one piece at a time. I could eat the whole thing in one sitting!

Amazing, amazing, amazing.  Everyone loves this coffee cake.  The texture and color are so rich.  The almond extract does so much.  I used more cranberries...excellent.  Thanks Laura!

This basically was like just cake. It definetly needs more cranberry to it and a streusal. I think I'll tweak the recipe a bit and add orange zest some orange juice and make a streusal on top and swirled in with lots more cranberries. I may even just add fresh whole cranberries to it. The cake moistness was right on. Thumbs up for that!

Excellent!  I love dried cranberries but not cranberry sauce but boy oh boy, this recipe, I'll be baking again.  One hitch - I learned a lesson of thinking I could get away with distributing all the cranberry sauce in at once.  WRONG! it was too heavy, settling on the bottom of the bundt pan I used and thankfully pieced the cake top back on the main section & then made a thick confectioners frosting that I put into a baggie, snipped a small corner and drizzled on top. Hid my boo-boo quite well ;-)

Because I'm on a low-sodium diet, I used low-sodium baking powder and baking soda.  And because the sugar content is so high, I used 1 cup Splenda in place of the white sugar.  I also made additional batter as suggested, as it didn't look like enough for a bundt or tube pan.  The results were great. I made several cakes to share at my club and church meetings.  I also made 24 copies of the recipe for those that wanted it.  Thanks for sharing!!

Pretty good,nobody raved about it though. It definitely needs something, maybe orange zest or orange juice in the batter. I might try to play with it for fall baking.

I loved the flavor of the cake, but it was a little overwhelmed because I used two full cans of cranberry as suggested by other reviewers.  I personally felt like that was too much.  I had to cook it quite a bit longer than the time given, but that may be because of all the extra cranberry.  I liked this because the cranberry added some tartness to balance the sweet.

i had been looking for a recipe for leftover cranberries for years.  Most recipes were for chutneys or more sauces or jellos.  They weren't the answer to using up a leftover.  No more throwing out the one-day-wonder-cranberries!  This cake was a hit too !

This was really good! I used the bigger can of cranberries, sooo glad I did. I don't think 8 oz would work very well. I added chopped walnuts and in addition to the almond extract, I also added vanilla extract. I loved it and my dad has let me know (twice already) that he liked the cake a lot. I really recommend adding the walnuts, it just compliments the cake so nicely. I baked this in a bundt pan and just dusted with powder sugar, after it cooled.

Delicious!  However, mine took a lot less time to bake than stated.  I used a 10 cup bundt ban.  It could be that the pan is thin, but overall I think it was done in about 40 minutes (possibly even 45).  I used the toothpick test and it showed it done that early.  I did use the canned whole cranberry sauce, while many other reviewed used homemade sauce. One suggestion is to take the canned sauce, put in a bowl and mush it up really well.  This helps make it easier to put in the batter without it touching the sides of the pan.  I just love the tang of the sauce in this cake.  Everyone here loved it, even picky daughter and picky grandma!

So moist and flavorful! I read lots of reviews before beginning and took the advice to add a streusel topping. I made these into muffins. I made a half batch and got 6 large muffins (from a normal sized muffin pan), so I would guess a full batch would yield 12 muffins. I used an ice cream scoop to scoop a dollop of batter in the bottom of each tin, then about 1 teaspoon cranberry sauce, then more batter, more cranberry sauce, a little bit of batter to top, and then the streusel to finish. I baked them at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes. Perfect! I also used low fat sour cream and vanilla in place of the almond extract. I will definitely be making these again!

My batter was too thick, maybe I added too much flour. I went ahead and added the orange glaze like someone suggested. I don't think I will make it again. I resisted this recipe at first using cranberry sauce but I thought "why not try it". I think I will stick to my cranberry jello salads in the future. But it's fun to experiment!

The cranberry swirl gave the cake/bread a nice texture to the surrounding parts. However, the rest of it tasted a little too much like the ingredients put in it, a bit floury and baking soda-ish.

The cake turned out great and really yummy... even my sister who thinks I can't cook thought it was great!  It took longer to bake than I expected, although that could be because I used a different pan.  Overall, it was a great cake and still tasty and moist as left-overs!

We've never fixed a real "breakfast" on Thanksgiving, simply because there is always so much food later in the day. But, I have a lot of family in my house this year, and I wanted something for people to snack on before the big meal. This cake is delicious and very easy to make. Even those who are not real fond of cranberries enjoyed it.

My coworkers really enjoyed this coffee cake.  I used nonfat sour cream, and I don't think that it affected the taste.  I also used homemade cranberry sauce.

LOVE THIS!  Have made this for years.  Tried it just like the recipe states and it's fabulous; added pecans, also fabulous, and added the streusel topping and again fabulous.  Any way you make this cake, it rocks.  Highly recommend!

Fantastic!
I found this recipe while looking for a way to used up leftover cranberry sauce. I was feeling chef-y so I added about 1/2 a tsp of finely-grated orange rind (also because I had some lying around). Didn't have almond extract so I used vanilla instead. Thanks for sharing this recipe, Laura! I will definitely make this again!

I am uncertain how to rate this recipe.  It turned out beautifully as far as flavor goes.  In one day's time, all friends and family had devoured it, right down to the last crumb.  However, I struggled with the batter for this cake.  It was extremely thick and not pourable (as most batters are): I actually had to spread it into the pan with a spatula.  Perplexed by this, I revisited the recipe to see what I may have missed or mismeasured but could find nothing I had mistakenly omitted or overused?  Will definitely try again ... to see if this was just a fluke ... and because it's such a tasty cake.
[I used a fresh orange juice/icing sugar glaze.  It complemented the cranberry and add a lovely moistness to the cake.]

It was so good! I found it to be a little "wet" at the bottom of the pan, so next time ( and there will be a next time!) I will put more than 1/3 of the batter in the pan before adding the cranberry sauce.  I also made 1/4 more batter as others suggested, I would definately do that again, however, I'd use a 9x13 pan, because it took an hour and 20 min to bake in the 9x9 pan.  Otherwise excellent!

This has a great taste!  I made it in  a loaf pan and followed original directions.  I tested the center and it seemed done but I found out it was still gooey in the middle.  Next time I'll bake longer (60 min?) and cover.  Great recipe!

This was OK, but rather plain. Probably much better with a streusel topping or glaze. I'm still looking for a good cranberry coffee cake.

Very good, quick cake.  Changed the recipe slightly to add 2 cans of whole cranberry sauce.  It seemed to need some sort of glaze,  so I added a powder sugar, milk and orange extract glaze to the top.  It was excellent!  Has a nice blend of tart and sweet flavors.  Everyone really loved it.

I made the mistake of making this the night before and my 3-yr old woke us up twice during the night asking if it was time to eat cake for breakfast yet!  Very good, with big chunks of jelly inside.

Excellent recipe!  I wanted to find a way to use up my leftover cranberry sauce, and I am so glad I found this recipe!  I substituted vanilla extract and plain yogurt because that is all I had on hand.  Will definitely make again!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Not too sweet and was extremely moist.  I added the orange juice and XXX sugar glaze suggested by another, but think it needed a little more orange flavor to that. Cake itself was good.

Very good.  I have made this twice now and the 2nd time I used slightly less almond extract than called for just due to personal preference.  This recipe gives you a moist cake that I was able to make into a loaf and freeze.  It thawed beautifully and tasted just the same as fresh baked.

It made a small bundt cake - needed more batter or something. Not sure if we will make it again. It was good ...but not great.  Like, I'm not going to lie in bed and think "oh that was soooo good." No, it's almost forgettable.  And this coming from someone who just loves cranberries.

I used leftover Thanksgiving cranberry sauce to make this (Cranberry Sauce recipe from this site with cranberries and orange juice - yum!).  I didn't have any sour cream, so I used leftover unwhipped whipping cream, and it still turned out great.  I made a glaze with orange juice and confectioner's sugar as recommended by another reviewer - went really well with the oj in the cranberry sauce.  Great way to use up Thanksgiving leftovers!

So good. I made this but I added the whole regular can (10-12 oz) of whole cranberry sauce as I didn't see it was a little can and it turned out great. I served this along with an asparagus quiche to my Bible Study group 2 years ago and they are still talking about that cranberry coffee cake.  They asked me to bring it again as they said they haven't found a recipe like that and could still remember how good that was.

I really wanted to to like this - but even after modifications had some big issues.  It is too sweet for me - too much like a dessert; not so much like a breakfast.  I did 1/2 batch and baked it in a loaf pan, but cut the sugar down to 1/3 c. (from 1/2 c of the halved recipe)  I also made my own cranberry sauce and layered probably twice what the recipe called for between the batter.  The almond extract overpowered it, so I cut that down to 1/4 tsp (again for my halved recipe).  Still not thrilled with the results, but I love cranberries so I may keep trying.  I am going to add orange zest and vanilla and cut out the almond extract next go around.

Ok, I made this delicious coffee cake for the second time. This time, I used a full cup of low-fat sour cream and a full can (15 oz.) of cranberry sauce. I am using an 8 x 8 inch square glass pan, adding about 1/3 extra flour. It was too moist in the middle, and I will decrease the cranberry sauce to the original recipe amount. Also, the small amount of juice added to the excess moisture. Other than that, it is tasty and presents beautifully. A crumb topping adds to the presentation! I wouldn't make it without it. Thanks!

Ok, I made this delicious coffee cake for the second time. This time, I used a full cup of low-fat sour cream and a full can (15 oz.) of cranberry sauce. I am using an 8 x 8 inch square glass pan, adding about 1/3 extra flour. It was too moist in the middle, and I will decrease the cranberry sauce to the original recipe amount. Also, the small amount of juice added to the excess moisture. Other than that, it is tasty and presents beautifully. A crumb topping adds to the presentation! I wouldn't make it without it. Thanks!

This got rave reviews--I tried to make the cinnamon crumb topping suggested by other readers but accidentally put in 1/3 c melted butter instead of 3 tbsp.  It was different (not a crumb topping so much as a solid topping) but very good.

This did not rise as much as I had hoped.  It was tasty and got great reviews from the family.  But I had hoped for a little different outcome.  I would deffenitely make it again.

All I can say is wow!  Great recipe for Thanksgiving morning.  I probably used a little more whole cranberry sauce, and used half vanilla, half almond extract instead of straight almond.  I also had a streusel topping of butter and brown sugar.  Wonderful!

I thought that this was wonderful.  It was super moist, which was great.  It also had a great flavor with the almond extract.  I also sprinkled it with powdered sugar right before serving to make it look prettier.

I added more cranberry sauce than it called for.  It only added more moisture to the cake.  It is delicious!!  I did add a drizzle of frosting on top (powdered sugar, water and almond ext.)

This recipe was very good.  I made the crumb topping as suggested by another reviewer, and that was delicious!  My only complaint was that it was a little dry.  I think it would have been better if it was only cooked for 50 minutes.

This coffee cake was absolutely incredible!  Made it the night before with great ease and made a wonderful treat the next morning.  It was incredibly moist.  This will definitely be a staple for the Holidays.  Thanks for sharing it.

Great flavor, pretty easy but I didn't have enough batter to do three layers.  Had to have one layer of batter, one of cranberry (half a can) and then topped it with the remaining batter.  I used a fluted pan and it came out real easy.  I might try again.  I think an icing glaze on it would be great.  It was a little dry.

When I turned the bundt pan upside, the cake slipped out easily.  But it looked like a volcano with cranberry magma gushing out onto my kitchen counter.

I haven't tasted it yet - it smelled good while it was baking.  But muffins might be a better idea!

Delicious! Followed recommendations from other reviewers to use 16 oz can cranberry sauce and made crumb topping with some chopped pecans and swirled through the batter. Also made half again volume of batter which was perfect for my bundt pan.

I have had pretty good luck with ThanksgivingRecipe.com. I just didnt love this one. It was too sweet to fall into the quick bread category, but not quite finished enough to be called a coffee cake. It really needs a strusel topping or something similar. Its just really bland except for the cranberry swirl part. My only change was cutting the almond extract in half, which I do in just about every recipe it is in, and baking it in a 9x9 pan. It just sat, first on the counter and then in the fridge, and was not touched. It used up leftover cranberry sauce, but unfortunately not a repeat recipe for the intended purpose.

This coffee cake is pure heaven and brought rave reviews from everyone who ate it.  I used my own homemade cranberry sauce which has whole cranberries, orange juice, sugar and orange peel.  I also added the recommended streusel topping. I could eat this once a week for the rest of my life! Thank you!!!

I have used this recipe several times.  I have always used 16 oz. of filling.  One time I mixed the cranberry sauce (I prefer whole berry) into the batter.  I use what ever I have on hand.  Today I'm using some pineapple and prunes left over in the fridge and I'm going to bake in my cast iron skillet like I would corn bread.  Love this recipe.  Very versatile, quick and easy.

Thanks for a great recipe. The almond extract adds a delicate fragrance and sweetness to the cake. I added a pinch of nutmeg and 1/2 teaspoon grated orange zest to the batter, then glazed the cooled cake with orange juice and confectioners sugar.

I made cherry cranberry sauce for Thanksgiving because I'm not a big fan of cranberries and I thought it would be a nice compromise for everyone.  Then I saw this recipe for cranberry cake.  I had about a cup left over and used that.  Also added a Tbsp or 2 of Ameretto I had on hand and an extra egg to keep its body.  This was great,,,,a recipe I will make often.  Thanks so much !

I made a few minor changes and it was delicious!  I used 3/4 cup sugar, vanilla extract (I didn't have almond), and I made it in an 8x8 square pan.  I think I added a little bit extra cranberry sauce and I'm glad I did!  It might have been easier for me to make in a tube pan but it was delicious nonetheless.

I made it a little healthier by substituting Smart Balance Blend, brown sugar, whole wheat flour, and light sour cream.  It was awesome.

Great cake..something different.  Next time I will let the whole cake cool completely before I take it out of the pan...it kind of crumbled on me when I slid it out of the tube pan.

I used about 1 1/2 cups cranberry sauce and when I took out my sour cream, I realized that I didn't have quite 1 cup, so I made up the difference with buttermilk.  The cake was moist and wonderful.  This one went to the teacher's lounge and was well received with many compliments.

This was great! I made in an 8x8 pan, not enough for a bundt pan. I suggest using the whole 14oz can of cranberries. Used 3/4 white flour and 1/4 whole wheat.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I loved how moist it was.  I made it in a bundt pan, and put a cream cheese glaze to finish it.  I also used 1/2 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp almond extract.  Everyone raved.  I think that any fruit filling could replace the cranberry if you wanted to shake it up.  Blueberry pie filling would do nicely!

Excellent!! I read many reviews first, so I took some of those suggestions as well. I had to "tweak" it since I didn't have quite all the listed ingredients and used walnuts in the mix and topping since this is the family favorite.  I used 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1/2 cup of 2% milk, (no yogurt on hand) adding about a teaspoon of mayonaise. I added the vanilla extract too as well as the almond. I used leftover whole berry cranberry sauce from Thanksgiving--wasn't sure about any liquid juice, so I didn't use it. I added about 1/3 to 1/2 cup more flour, since 2 cups didn't seem like it was enough. I swirled the sauce only on the top, but it was fine. I also used an 8" x 8" pan and it cooked nicely for 50 minutes, adding the topping after 30 minutes. It wasn't dry it all. The bottom was medium toasty brown, so maybe a bit less cooking next time when I make it again, which will be SOON!! Great for brunch, company, Holidays or just easy Sunday mornings.....Thanks!!

What a moist and delicious cake!  I reduced the sugar to about 3/4 c.  and it was still a sweet cake without being too sweet.  especially if you are going to put some frosting on it.  I also used about 1.5 Cups of cranberry sauce that i made.  i baked it with the crumb topping as recommened and it was perfect.  It's a great balance in texture as the cake itself is really moist and the crumb topping gives it a little crust.  perfect for teas and great paired with coffee, too!  It's going to be one of my regulars.  :)

I tried this the first time in a bundt pan and it was too dry (though my in-laws loved it).  Tried it a second time in a loaf pan and it was much more moist, I practically ate the whole thing by myself.  Definitely double the cranberry sauce.

This cake was great! I followed the recipe, except I added 1/2 cup chopped pecans in a bundt cake pan, then filled as directed. Then I omited the powdered sugar topping. It was so moist and delicious!  A new favortie! Thanks!

I thought this was quite good.  I halved it to use up half a can of cranberry sauce I had on hand and did it in a square pan.  I had trouble "swirling" the cranberry sauce.  Next time I will double the cranberry sauce and just mix it with the batter .  It would probably be easier in a tube pan though.  A nice change of pace and great for thanksgiving leftovers.

I love the flavors but tweaked this recipe a bit.  I make my own cranberry sauce so I use closer to 12-16 ounces in a single layer.  After baking I topped with slivered almonds and a glaze with almond extract & water.  The texture is beautiful and it's a wonderful cake for Thanksgiving time.

I thought the almond extract flavor was a bit strong.  Also, the batter was very thick (so don't be intimidated by the word "pour" in the inbstructions)--but the cake turned out fine.  My family really liked it!

This is really good! Four stars instead of five, though, because the batter is really thick and difficult to spread (especially to get three layers out of it). I followed the recipe exactly as it's written, so no changes here. The taste is excellent, especially after letting it sit overnight.

This was a very good coffee cake.  Yes, it's a basic quick bread/cake recipe, but the addition of cranberry sauce is a great idea. I substituted vanilla extract for almond extract to appeal to my family's taste. I am only giving 4 stars, because the recipe calls for an entire can of cranberry sauce, when, in fact, that amount is not necessary.  It was a perfect use for the leftover cranberry sauce we had from Sunday dinner, which was just under 1/2 can.

Made it as written with sour cream. Delicious cake. The top of my bundt separated when i tipped it out, but I may have overfilled it with homemade cranberry sauce. Still tasty!

I was looking for something to do with extra cans of cranberry sauce I sitting in the cabinet.  I made this and took this to a gathering and at the end I told folks I didn't want to take any leftovers home...they were fighting over it!  Everyone wanted some to take home!  This one is a keeper.

I used yogurt, instead of sour cream. Filled muffin tin 2/3 full with batter. Placed a teaspoon of Cranberry jelly in the center. Topped with remaining batter, and baked.
 They were delicious!

I took the suggestion to add orange juice and confectioners sugar as a glaze to balance out the cranberry but I found it was too sweet and threw me and my husband off a little. Since the cranberry comes from the can it was sweet enough.

Moist and tasty!  Here are the changes I made:  I didn't have enough sour cream, so I used part of that along with some vanilla yogurt and milk to equal a cup.  I did just a 1/2 tsp. of almond extract along with 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract.  I also added some pecans as another reviewer suggested.  Next time I might try baking it at 325 instead, as my Nordic Ware Bundt pan is on the darker side and the cake was a tad darker than I cared it to be after 45 min.

Turned out great. Did not have sour cream so used buttermilk (milk with lemon juice added). 55min was too long so next time I will bake it for 50 min. I will definitely make it again.

I used my own recipe for cranberry sauce because all canned sauces have high fructose corn syrup.
 I also added a crumb topping. Just my preference.
Awesome recipe. Will definitely make it again.

Made exactly as the recipe said and it turned out beautiful. The batter was very thick but worked with getting it into pan and it came out great. My husband loves it.  Will make again for sure.

This was delicious and so easy to make! The only changes I made were to add 2 tsp vanilla extract instead of the 1 tsp almond extract, baked for 50 minutes instead of 55, and I topped it with a glaze  of confectionary sugar, milk, and a small amount of lemon extract. So good! Will definitely make it again!

I did not follow the exact recipe. - I used half whole wheat flour,
reduced the sugar by 25%  and used lingonberry rather than cranberrry.  Also I did not go to the trouble of  "Adding the flour mixture alternately with the sour cream or yogurt to the butter mixture" Additionally it was fully cooked at 42 minutes.  It was Okay.  I think whole cranberrries  + some orange zest would make an improvement.

Made this, was really hoping to like it more than I did. Only change I made was using vanilla in place of the almond flavoring (what I had on hand). Maybe that made the difference? It just did not have very much flavor, and I really think I could have used the whole larger can of cranberries as well. Maybe a crumb type topping and glaze would give it more flavor. Willing to try again-

This is wonderful!!!!!  I looked at other reviews and decided to add some nuts and used a whole can of the cranberry sauce.  I also had some dried cranberries so added 1 cup of those along with 1 cup of chopped walnuts.  Made it for a work breakfast and brought home nothing but the crumbs!  One girl I work with is a close friend and we always make her a cake for Christmas and this is what she requested!  Will be making another one for the  holidays I believe.

I just made this. I used left over home made cranberry sauce, and I did make some adjustments. I love the combination of cranberry and brown sugar, so I added a quarter of a cup of brown sugar packed to the batter.  Also I made the crumble topping with the brown sugar flour and  butter and added some crumbled up sliced almonds. It is to die for!

It came out moist and pretty but I just didn't like the cranberry in it.  The cranberry made it too sweet along with the almond extract.  I liked the bread just not the cranberries.

I was going to give half to a neighbor, so of course I had to taste-test to see if it was suitable for human consumption! :)  I used my own homemade cranberry sauce that I processed a bit in my mini-processor. I probably used an amount closer to a 14-oz can (isn't that their size nowadays?). I added the crumb topping that reviewers mentioned (melted butter, flour and brown sugar). Pretty funny....that topping is now on the bottom of the fluted tube pan I used! Oh well, it still tastes good. I also plan to drizzle with a glaze of confect sugar, milk and almond extract. Mine was ready at about 50 min, so make sure you keep an eye on it. Two thumbs up, and Merry Christmas to all!

Excellent cake - nice crumb, nicely moist, good flavour.  Served it for a meeting and a motion was made for me to bring it to every meeting;-)
I used homemade cranberry sauce, which I applied over half the batter, covered the sauce with the remaining batter. The Almond extract is a nice counterpoint.  Next time, I will drizzle an icing with some almond extract in it over the cake.  Mmm mm good.

This was a great recipe! I didn't use canned cranberry sauce but instead opted for homemade cranberry sauce. It was great.

I have been making this delicious coffee cake for  for decades. The 2nd time I made it I accidentally used a 16 oz can of whole cranberry sauce instead of 8 oz. OMG what a wonderful mistake. I layer half the batter, half the cranberry sauce, the rest of the batter and sauce and top with 1/2 cup almonds, chopped.  I do not swirl the sauce.

I thought this coffee cake recipe was pretty good but my husband wasn't so keen on it.  He thought the cranberry sauce between the layers seemed a bit odd...maybe I should have only used the eight ounces the recipe called for.  I had only had a large can and used almost all of it.

I didn't have cranberry sauce so I substituted a can of cherry pie filling and it was delicious.  Next time I will use the entire can to add even more flavor.  I glazed it with vanilla glaze and it turned out great!

Delicious! I grated a little fresh orange peels into my cranberries before putting them down the center of the cake. I used regular vanilla because I didn't have any almond extract. This is definitely something I would make again. Very moist and scrumptious.

This was pretty good.  I even used fat free sour cream.  I read some reviews, and after making the batter, decided there wasn't enough to go around in a bundt pan, so I used a loaf pan, and it came out perfectly moist.  And then I made a glaze to put over it.  I didn't really measure, but it was about 1/2 cup powdered sugar, milk and almond extract.

I made this cake for an Easter Brunch, and my family loved it!  I used yogurt rather than sour cream and I also mixed in a crumb mixture with the cranberries.  This is a new family favorite!

This is yummy, moist, cranberry-y. Tastes somehow as though it has poppy seeds in it - I bet that would be a good addition. Baked in a 9x9" pan for 45 minutes as my Bundt (tube pan) is at a relative's house, otherwise followed directions to a "T". I doubt it will keep long, though, with moist cranberries. No doubt dry out in the fridge, or mould quickly on the counter. Soft crumb; basic ingredients; a hit for a quick dessert.

This recipe is quite labor-intensive. The crust that formed is nice and crisp if you eat it once it has cooled a little. However, if you eat it the next day, it's not that great.

Lots of cranberry and almond flavor...very moist too.  Only regret was it didn't rise as high as I would have liked.  I'll have to try the 9" pan next time.  Will make again for sure.
