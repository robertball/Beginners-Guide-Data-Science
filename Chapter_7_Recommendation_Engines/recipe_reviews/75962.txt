I made these for company on New Year's Day and they were a hit!  I added 1/4 cup packed brown sugar to the wet ingredients based on the review and used 1 egg. I loved the soft texture and taste!

Made some changes, first I doubled the recipe. That makes 5 Belgium waffles. Second, I substituted 3 eggs for the substitute (remember doubled). Third I substituted buttermilk for the water, because if I'm going to eat waffles, why not? They tasted great! Heated up some real maple syrup and butter in a gravy boat, and poured it on, because again, why not?

These were very good.  I added a 1/4 cup of brown sugar which sweetened them up a little.  For me this recipe only made 2 belgian style waffles.

These were pretty good. I used 1 egg, 1 cup normal flour, and 1/4 cup brown sugar. This was the first time we used our waffle maker so I think I just need to figure out how to make them crisper.

These were good. I doubled the batch, and added about 1/4 of applesauce to sweeten them just a bit. I served them with apple topping (2 apples sliced thinly, about 3 tbsp brown sugar, 1 tbsp maple syrup, 1-2 tsp cinn, cooked over medium heat till boiling, then simmered on on low till apples were just soft). It was good and plenty sweet enough for me. I also tried a few with chocolate chips mixed in. They were AWESOME! Served those ones with hot maple syrup.

Delicious! 
 I used substitutes of  1/2 cup unsifted flour, and 1/2 cup Whole Wheat Flour,  I used 1 whole egg.   
I added 1 scoop Ground Flax Seed.  I added 1/4 cup Brown Sugar.  I doubled the cinnamon.
I like this served with a little Maple Syrup, and topped with whipped cream, and a sprinkle of cinnamon.

I made these changes: substituted 1 egg, substituted 1 cup flour (because I didn't have the other kinds), and I added 1/8 cup flour.  This recipe made a very small amount- on a regular waffle iron, about 6 whole waffles. It smelled good, and the batter tasted good, but the waffle iron process sucked all the goodness out of it- so these were OK tasting, but not very gingerbready. I served these with icing (milk and powdered sugar) and that helped the un-sweet flavor these had.

These are great with real maple syrup but if you're going to eat them plain you may want to add a little sweetener.  I used Ener-G egg replacer and non hydrogenated margerine instead of butter to make them vegan.

Pretty good. I used 1 egg, only all purpose flour, and brown sugar. Not crispy and kinda rubbery but waffling is still new to me. I doubled recipe and filled the 4 square iron 3 times and made 12. Going to pop rest in freezer cause all my waffles are better warmed in toaster another day. Had them with good ol fructose free log cabin. Babysitting so total 5 kids with mine and they ate all of theirs.

Very tasty! I used vegan substitutes for the egg (2 tbl corn starch + 2 tbl water) and butter (margarine) and a little more cinnamon than was called for.  They're great with molasses.

I initially made this following the recipe exactly, except that I used an egg instead of egg substitute.  The result was an waffle with almost no sweetness in it that would work as a break product (such as with fried chicken) but not alone unless dunked in syrup. Based on the other reviews, I ended up adding brown sugar to the recipe.  I used a Belgium waffle maker and cooked the waffles 3-4 minutes.  These were interesting and tasty.  For a fluffier waffle, I recommend letting the batter sit 5-10 minutes before cooking.

Not bad. Made the changes suggested, brown sugar and a whole egg and regular flour. It really didn't need any syrup. Tasty with a lot of real butter.

Doubled the recipe (which made about six), substituted regular flour for the two other flours, and used an egg instead of the egg substitute. Also added the brown sugar per the suggestions in the comments. Absolutely delicious, would definitely make again!

Love loves love this recipe! They were moist and wholesome... The only thing I changed was doubled recipe and used whole eggs instead of the substitute...I immediately threw out my leftover frozen store bought waffles and will never buy them again! Thank you for this keeper!

I make a lot of waffles.  These were a little interesting but not great.  I think I will try brown sugar as recommended by others if I try these again, and/or replace some flour with mashed sweet potato.

I just made these, and WOWY! I subscribed to the wonderful magazine and the recipe was a little different. Some changes were; 1 stick of butter, 1/4 c molasses,2 c whole wheat flour, I added 2 t cinnamon, and chopped walnuts to the batter. These are one of the best!

The waffle recipe was a HIT with our family.  I only had 1 TBSP molasses so substituted more cinnamon and brown sugar and it was a huge success.  I doubled it for our early Christmas family brunch.

I added brown sugar like the rest of the reviewers which turned out to be a good call. The next time I make them I will probably add some oil so I can get them nice and crispy.

The gingerbread flavor (spices) kind of sneak up on you. It doesn't blast with gingerbread flavor, so you may want to add a little more of the spices. I added the 1/4 cup brown sugar as suggested, used 2 real eggs because I couldn't get egg substitute and all purpose flour (because I can't get Kamut flour). Made 2 3/4 cups of batter.
You don't really need syrup if you add the brown sugar.

My family loved it and it definitely holds up to the Gingerbread Flavor. I doubled the recipe, used regular eggs, 1/4 cup packed brown sugar, and whole wheat flour instead of the pastry flour. It was super good!

Amazing!!!! I have been searching for a soft gingerbread recipe. We enjoyed these for dinner on a hot July evening when it was too hot to turn on the oven. Some things you eat leave you with a warm fuzzy forever memory. This is one of those for our family. I also added 1/4 cup of brown sugar. Followed everything else to a tea.

These were VERY tasty, but were VERY heavy and dense.
