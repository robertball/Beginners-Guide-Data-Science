I'm no expert, but I added another egg, more cheese, and a bit of flour to help keep them together. Also, you can use a more sticky rice to help. It's incredibly important that you do not flip them too soon while cooking! If you do all of this, you will not have them break apart! :D 
I also sprinkled seasoning salt after and ate them with sour cream! YUM!

I baked mines in the oven like you would do macaroni & cheese & it turned out perfect... When I heated leftovers up I fried it with olive oil to brown it as directed in this recipe

Great recipie! Last day before payday so I used what I had on hand. Arborio rice mozzarella parm and gluten free Italian bread crumbs. Seasoned the rice with garlic powder onion powder salt pepper thyme and oregano. Chilled rice for a couple hours before adding cheeses egg red pepper flakes fresh garlic and a little more pepper and salt. I used GF Italian bread crumbs but panko would work great too. Also used cooking spray rather than veg oil. They made an awesome side dish to baked chicken!

These were delicious but they are really REALLY hard to keep together hence the 4 star rating. I used leftover yellow rice so that added a nice flavor to these. I am wondering what I can add to hold them together better...I mixed everything up (even using all of the optional ingredients except for the meat) formed the patties and let them 'set up' in the fridge all day before frying them in hopes of avoiding breakage. Some did stay together but the majority did not. They still are delicious and I plan on coming up with a solution to the breaking problem. Thanks for sharing.:)

My husband is not a big rice fan but he asked me to make it again. So why only 4 stars? This is like making potato latkes. You need flour to hold it together. I still only used one egg and did add a little more cheese. I slightly fried the onion and garlic first also. I cooked the rice in chicken broth too. Folks you MUST be patient before even thinking about flipping these (just like latkes). They held together great for me. I will be making these again

I followed some of the other suggestions and added another egg and added some flour. When I started to form the patties I was a little concerned I hadn't added enough flour because they didn't want to stay together. I managed to get them in the pan. You have to make sure they are done on one side before you even think about turning them. One person suggested dipping in sour cream. I spread sour cream across the top added some salsa and cheese on top of that. It was so good. My husband isn't crazy about left overs but he loved this. Its been added to keep list.

I added basil instead of oregano made a double batch and added about 1/4 cup extra of cheese. My rice was a few days old so I worked slowly to keep the patties together. My husband asked me what made the flavor and he said "I LIKE it." I'll favorite this recipe and make it again.

Had loads of rice left over when I read this recipe so I tried it out. Really easy to prepare and delicious. I'm going to add some finely chopped smoked bacon lardons next time.

Made it like recipe says but changing up a few things like previous poster mentioned. More cheese added an extra egg and a bit of flour. Liked the simple taste and recipe.

I didnt add anything extra to help them stick together prior to forming them into patties. But i like the idea of it i may do that next time. What i ended up doing bc as is there was no way i was going to get this mixture into patties going into the pan. So what i did was i formed them into balls the best i could placed the balls in the oil then smooshed them with my spatula and then formed up the edges. Worked for me.

Love it but don t bother trying to make patties. Just throw it all together like hashbrowns and stir. Easy recipe to modify for the pickier family members.

I used leftover brown rice that was a couple days old and needed to be used immediately.  I mostly followed the recipe, except I added 2 tablespoons of flour, doubled the amount of cheese (I used extra old white cheddar), and sliced green onions.  Baked the patties in the oven on a greased cookie sheet.  Turned out perfectly golden.

My mom thought they were too dry for her tastes,  but I thought they were divine.  Crispy, cheesy, and oh-so-good with ketchup.

i think maybe a sticky rice like left over risotto would work better

I followed the directions I swear. This was just okay but I ended up pitching them as they weren't worth saving. My daughter likened them to dog biscuits. The dog thought they were just okay too. It was an interesting recipe to try though no regrets.

It s a great way to use left over rice! I omitted the pepper and pepper flakes. I refrigerated the mixture for about a half an hour so the patties stuck together well.

So far so good in using up leftover rice. I quadrupled the recipe using 4 cups of cold cooked rice and all the other ingredients as well. I read all the reviews and baked like mac&cheez per at least one reviewer. It smells great.

I use leftover risotto so I generally add some pepper to the mix and add whatever other spices from this recipe that compliment the flavor. I add about 1/4 cup of flour and one egg. When I m forming the patties I roll the rice into a ball and then roll the ball in panko. I let them sit for a bit and when I m ready to cook I smash them onto a griddle. The panko helps glue the exterior of the patty together. Nice adaptable recipe thanks!

I just love these patties. We eat a lot of rice and I am always looking for recipes to use on leftover rice, besides fried rice. This was our second time fixing these, they were good the first time but I have learned a few things and tried again. I used less garlic and next time I will use less garlic and more salt. They are definitely my favorite go to leftover dish. My husband loves them. I fix 4 like the recipe calls for, I eat 1 and he eats the other 3. Thank you for the easy and good recipe!

I had leftover chicken broccoli riceroni so the cheese and onions married beautifully with it. It was a little hard to work with so I did end up adding another egg and some flour. Delicious with a dip made from fat-free mayo or Greek yogurt deli mustard a dash of Worcestershire and Frank's hot sauce.

I saw this and didn't have much in the fridge so I had to improvise. I had no cheese and only a few seasonings. So I did use two eggs and a few different sessions I had like garlic powder pepper adobo and some onion flakes. It did stay together and fried nicely. I didn't think it was going to be good but I was hungry so I went with it. Even without all the ingredients it was surprisingly good. I decided to put a little ketchup on top and made it even better. I decided I am making it with dinner tonight as well. Can't wait to make it the right way after i go to the grocery store.

Confession.. I googled for this recipe after I accidentally over cooked my rice yesterday. I didn't want to waste it:) I just finished making these. They turned out perfect and my husband is going to love them!!! I didn't change anything except maybe a bit generous on cheese and didn't add red pepper flakes. They didn't fall apart whatsoever. I simply waited patiently by the stove until time to flip. I ate one and it was delish!

I was hesitant about this recipe after reading the reviews but after making them I'm not sure where they went wrong. Instead of onion I used scallions I had but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Will definitely make them again.

I used this as a base recipe and adjusted it to fit my needs. I used leftover rice and beans from taco night as well as ground beef and the rest of the Mexican 4 cheese blend. I also adjusted the seasonings for more of a taco taste. I used a 1/4 cup measuring cup packed tight with the mix and then scooped it out and shaped by hand. I found the best option for me was medium heat and three patties at a time in the pan. They were amazingly good!!  None broke or crumbled.
