This is wonderful--the chicken and dried beef go well together.  I did make a few changes to the recipe:
1)  I used 2 cans cream of mushroom soup, and 2 cups of sour cream (hey--I like a LOT of gravy)
2)  Added a packet of Lipton Onion soup mix
3)  Added a cup of shredded cheddar cheese
4)  Increased the flour to 1/2 cup
Layered everything like recipe said (you don't even have to thaw the chicken breasts--I put them in frozen.  After 8 hours in crock pot, everything was done--chicken very tender and sauce was great.
Served this with rice and asparagus--all I can say is this meal was terrific!!!!!!

Try this--you will really like it!

I rated this once and then came back to rate it again.  I first gave it 5 stars then came back and gave it three.  You see...I make this and have for years.  I make it by taking regular chicken breasts and lining a 9x13 pan and mixing one can of soup and a small carton of sour cream and covering the top.  Sometimes I line the bottom of the pan with "buddig" beef. (the little packages in the packaged meat aisle) At first I gave it 5 stars but then after I fed it to my family - they all thought the crockpot version was not as good as the regular oven version I make.  (not sure why but it turned out much juicier in the fast method.    I also wrap a slice of bacon around each piece of chicken when I am using it for company or if I have bacon in the fridge  -  I then bake it for 45 minutes on 400 - For me - this turns out better and the family agrees.   Perhaps I cooked it too long - but I took it off way sooner than the recipe called for already - so watch the time - or it will dry it out.

I used my larger crockpot and after reading the other reviews, I changed my recipe to 2 lbs. frozen chicken, 1 1/2 C. sour cream, two cans of soup and one 4.5 oz jar of dried beef that I rinsed. The chicken was the most tender I've ever had. Leftovers were great! Will definitely make again for company.

We love this recipe!  I used the packaged dryed beef found in the lunchmeat section in the grocery store; this dryed beef is not as salty as the dryed beef in the jars.  I also microwaved some bacon slices (partially cooked the bacon) and wrapped the bacon slices around the chicken breasts.  YUMMY!!

There MUST be a typo in this recipe.  It calls for 2 oz. jars of dried beef.  I used 2 2.5 oz jars and it was pretty salty.  Next time I would use one small jar and layer it VERY sparingly.  The recipe itself is WONDERFUL!  I used frozen breasts, cooked on high for one hour then on low for 7.  It was GREAT!  I'm most definately use this one again!

Easy AND delicious.  I will make this again and again.  It's too bad nobody else has rated this.  I certainly hope that doesn't mean they haven't tried it.  They are missing out.  Loved it.

This was a great dish even though I changed a few things. I doubled the sauce, added onion soup powder, package of sliced mushrooms, cheddar cheese, and I used 8oz of rinsed dried beef. It was absolutely delish!! I served it with a side of wild and long grain rice, and green beans. This one's a keeper!!!

I couldn't get dried beef, so I subsituted for fried bacon and cut them up into bits.
I added 1 can of cream of mushroom & potatoe & 1 can of cream of chicken - love gravy! Added roasted garlic - 1 tablespoon  and 1/2 cup of dry sherry. Simple recipe and variations of this recipe can be done. Thank you :)

This is such an easy recipe. The chicken comes out tender & juicy. I have made this several times & it is great every time. I have added different spices to change the flavor (like paprika & fresh black pepper)and that worked well too.

I serve a similar recipe in my restaurant and it's a huge hit.  I butter the bottom of a 7qt crock pot, line it with enough dried beef to cover the bottom in a single layer slightly overlapping (1 small jar or package 3 ounces--don't rinse the dried beef. 16 ounces is way to much for this recipe and makes it overly salty).  Place 6 or 7 chicken breasts on the dried beef and add 2 cans each of cream of mushroom soup, cream of celery soup, cream of chicken soup (use enough soups to fill your pot after you've added everything.  I usually add 2 cans of cream of chicken and mushroom on top of everything.  You can use whatever creamy soup you like best).  Add a package of dry onion soup mix.  Take a pint of sour cream and mix with 1/4 cup flour and dump in.  Be sure to mix flour and sour cream well...no lumps. Use a wisk and do this a little at a time. Finally, take a full pound of bacon, cut it into 1/4 inch pieces, lightly fry and add to crockpot.  Can be cooked on high or low depending on how much time you have.  Best cooked on low for 6 hours and high for 2 to finish.  Give a good stir when you put the temp on high.  You can keep the breasts whole, but I tear them apart with a fork as I mix everything up.  This is wonderful served on egg noodles.  I also serve it as a variation over biscuits for breakfast.  You may notice the recipe tightening up if you have to re-heat it.  If this happens just add some chicken stock to thin the gravey.  This also freezes well.

Just made this today for dinner, and it turned out great! I doubled the recipe to feed my family, except for the dried beef....I only used one 8 oz jar for the whole thing. I also rinsed the beef in warm water as others suggested. The only thing I added was some pepper to the soup mix. I put it in the cooker on low for 6 hours. By the time I checked it the chicken was very moist and falling apart, so I just pulled all the pieces apart along with the beef and I served it over egg noodles. Even my super picky toddlers ate it all! I'll definately make this again. Thanks :)

I seasoned the chicken with paprika, salt and pepper and then seered lightly before putting into the cooker.  I skipped the beef and added onions to the mixture.  Awesome!

This great flavor combination has been around for a long, long time, but this is perhaps the easiest version I have seen.  My late wife used to pound the chicken breasts flat, then roll a slice of dried beef inside each, making a kind of rouladen.  She would lay these out closely in a baking dish and pour the sauce over all, then cook covered with foil in a slow oven for about an hour and a half.  Sometimes she would add a little sherry or white wine to the sauce.

I have made this recipe for many years and I have done it in the oven or in a crock pot if I can't be here to get it going.  For those who think it is too salty----You HAVE to rinse off the dried beef.  That helps a ton with the salty.  I also double the gravy using Cream of Chicken soup instead since my family will not eat mushrooms.  Served over rice this is an awesome meal that the whole family eats including the leftovers.

I'm really glad I finally tried this!  I'm not sure if I liked it or not though.  The [pre-rinsed] dried beef stained the chicken an odd pink color (and even though I know it was cooked thru it made it hard to eat pink chicken). The gravy was good but the chicken was still dry.  Maybe my crock pot cooked it too fast; not sure.  Anyway, I don't know if I'll try this one again but thank you for posting it!

Easy to make.  Delicious, but very salty.  Very.  Use the low-sodium cream of mushroom soup to knock the saltiness down a notch.

If it were up to me, I wouldn't give this dish any stars, the beef was much too salty and the sour cream just didn't seem to pair up with the cream of mushroom at all. What a waste of a meal, I won't ever try this dish again.

This was so blah. Everyone was looking forward to it but then as we scooped it out of the slow cooker, we were already looking for something else to eat. I won't be making this again.

I prepared this as directed in the recipe, although I used only one small jar of dried beef and all low fat versions of the cream soups.  It was not too salty, the chicken fell apart and the sauce was very good.  My husband enjoyed it very much.  I do think that the flavor could be bumped up hugely by adding some garlic and bacon.  I will try this one again with those two additions.

This is a really easy and good recipe.  I made one change.  I did not have dried beef and didn't have time to go to the store and look for it so I used roast beef I had from the deli.  It was cut on the thin side.  Everything else was done according to recipe directions.  I did cook it in the oven versus the crockpot.  I really enjoyed this.  So did my family.  We served it over rice.  Aslo a good recipe side for this is the sauteed curry corn, also from this site.  Excellent combination.  A little heavy on the carb count but worth every bite of calorie!!!

Delicious!  I also added 6 strips of bacon to the crock pot, layered in with the dried beef, and it was wonderful.  I also used low-fat sour cream and cream cheese and 98% fat-free soup, and it turned out fantastic!  I like a lot of sauce, so I recommend only 4 breasts for this recipe.

This recipe has potential, however the sour cream should only be added at the end of cooking, it curdled, which it very unappetizing!  I think that carl buddig beef would be better than the dried, as it is a little less salty.  I will probably make this again with a few changes.

Local supermarkets usually carry dried beef in the canned meats isle. At my local store, it is near the canned tuna, salmon and hash.

We love this recipe.  Like many reviewers I also wrap the chicken in bacon.  I place the beef on the bottom, followed by the chicken, and then top with the mixture.  I too would agree that baking makes it juicier, but if you need to make in advance it is so nice to put it in the crockpot!

This was WAAAYYY too salty. I have NEVER made something that we couldn't salvage - have also never made anything on this website that I was so dissappointed in.  I tell all of my friends about this website - and I wasted good chicken breasts on this.  We followed the directions perfectly, waited all day, then ended up eating left-overs and canned soup for dinner.  PLEASE skip this and find something else to make for your family....

Just made this for our small group from church at our house.  I had it in the crockpot all day and it was perfect.  Added the onion soup mix and 2 cans cream of mushroom soup, about 1-1/2 c. sour creme for 8 chicken breasts.  This recipe is a keeper.  It made lots of gravy or sauce which was good cause we served biscuits too.  Got requests for the recipe and some of the men had second helpings. Yea!!!!

My whole family enjoyed this.  The taste is great but it is sooo very salty.  I used low sodium cream of mushroom soup but the beef makes it crazy salty.  I wasn't sure if I was to use 2-8 oz. jars of dried beef or 8 oz total so I opted for 8 oz total and it was plenty of dried beef.  I will make this again and rinse my beef or look for low sodium dried beef.  8 hours on low and it was cooked perfectly.  I served this with Simply Steamed Asparagus  from this site.

Got this recipe from a friend years ago - 1998. It came out of the cookbook she got with her crock pot. I liked the suggestion of rinsing the chipped beef because this is certainly a salty dish but hubby and I love it!

my only suggestion is that you rinse the dried beef before you start layering to lessen the salt taste.

My family (including out of town members) enjoyed this recipe.  Next time I'll use a LOT less beef.  Several did comment it tasted like Tuna!  Easy, filling.  We'll probably make it again.

I'm not sure what happened.  This recipe is very similar to what my mom makes in the oven.  All I can think is that perhaps my slow cooker seal isn't very good.  All of the gravy was either absorbed or evaporated, leaving me with stringy chicken and darkened dried beef.  It was unattractive/unappetizing, but moist.  My guest and husband ate it, so it could have been worse.  I won't make this again.  Used 1.5lbs chix with a 5 oz jar of dried beef- definitely needs the rinsing.  Made full amount of sauce.  I did wrap the breasts with uncooked bacon, which I think added a nice flavor.  I added some frozen peas at the very end after discovering there was no sauce.  Served with egg noodles.

This was a different, tasty recipe that my whole family loved.  It's great to have another recipe using the crock pot that everyone will eat.  I followed the suggestion of using the Budtig packaged beef versus the Armour dried beef in the jar.  Not only was it less expensive, it was not salty.  I did not have to rinse the beef before using it.  I also added a can of mushrooms to the mix as we all like mushrooms. I served this yummy dish over rice. A definite keeper!

I tried this chicken recipe - put it in one Sunday morning about 7:30 and it was ready by lunchtime.  Absolutely wonderful.  No prep - just add things to your slow cooker.  Husband raves about it and even still comments how good it is after his taking the leftovers to lunch.  I did use salt and pepper on my chicken and shouldn't have since the dried beef is a little salty.  Do not salt anything.  It all works out great.  Will use this recipe again and again.  Thanks for a good recipe.

I made this recipe as written then the next time I made a few adjustments. I left out the beef added sliced red pepper, sliced mushrooms and a dash of red pepper flakes to the pot the last hour of cooking. Served over gnocchi and it was great.

Years ago I made this (very similar) recipe and found that the family wasn't fond of the dried beef.  I changed that to Canadian Bacon - sliced thin and used sparingly.  We all liked this better. (Just a matter of personal taste!)

I have been making a receipe similar to this for years.  I absolutely LOVE IT!  I only use one jar of dried beef, and sometimes I wrap the chicken w/ one piece of bacon and omit the dried beef, and sometimes I use both, but no matter how I do this recipe it's 5 stars.  My son and BF both love it.  Sometimes I double the "sauce" so we have some extra to go over rice or mashed potatoes, but this is always a winner in our house!

Some of the reviewers state there wasn't alot of taste to this dish.  The dried beef added plenty of salt (I used the packages of dried beef found in the lunchmeat section and cut them up into little chunks instead of doing the layering)  I aso used some onion powder.   There are minimal ingredients to the recipe so there is room for adding whatever else is to your taste to make it more to your preference.  I enjoyed it basically as is.

I thought the recipe turned out great. My entire family liked it. The gravy is really good. For those who find it too salty, I think you may not have rinsed off the dried beef, which is recommended when using it in recipes.

This was tasty, although my husband didn't like it.  However, it made both of us ill.  I don't know if it was all of the preservatives in the dried beef or if the chicken wasn't properly cooked (I followed the recipe and the chicken looked cooked through).  I rinsed the beef off first, and it wasn't too salty.  I also added onion soup mix and extra mushrooms.  I won't be making this again.

Super Salty!  I would suggest soaking the dried beef for a while to remove some of the salt.  However, I did like the flavor of this dish.  I will make it again, using my suggestion above.

Love this recipe I have been making it forever! To everyone complaining about the salt you have to wash the dried beef and pat it dry to get the salt off of it.  I think it even mentions this on the package.

Definate crowd pleaser. I cut back on the dried beef, it was a bit salty, I prefer the butcher to cut my beef, I think it's much better than the kind in the jar. Delicious!

The Dried Beef made it so salty i had to scrape all the Beef off in order to eat the chicken. the chicken was very good . I feel that this recipe would be a five star, just use thin sliced Roast Beef in place of Dried Beef and double the Sauce CCRider

Excellent meal... Served with long grain and wild rice and asparagus. I rinsed the dried beef and added 1/2 package onion soup mix.  I also added 3/4 c. shredded sharp cheddar cheese to the sauce. I made mine with lowfat sour cream and cheese. My husband loved it and I will definitely make again.  Thank you for sharing!!

I did not like this at all, my husband thought it was ok.  I am pretty sure I left it in the slow cooker too long, but with my work schedule I don't really have any other choice.  The chicken was soooo dry and the sauce was separated and just over all not good at all.  I may try this again on a weekend when I can be home to cook it in a much shorter amount of time.  I really think since it got such great reviews that it must have been something I did wrong...if I try again, I may come back and change my rating!

quite tasty!  i only had a ( family sized ) 4oz package of dried beef so that is what i used.  didn't rinse it before using and the salt content wasn't overpowering.

next time i will add some sliced mushrooms and white pepper to the soup mixture.  might venture to add some more beef but will definitely rinse it first.

i served the chix with wild/long grain rice combo and fresh broccoli spears; made sure to put the beef on top of the chix ( it kind of moulded itself to the breasts! ) to complete the presentation  ...

we will be enjoying this again in the near future!!

This seemed like a great idea, but we found that using the 2 jars of dried beef just made things WAY TOO SALTY.  If I did it again I would cut the beef back.

Very delicious and easy to cook and make.  I rinsed the dried beef and used healthy low sodium cream of mushroom soup.  Cooked 4 hours in oven at 275.

This was delicious!  I did use the two jars of beef but will probably do as some of the other reviewers suggested and use only one jar or use packaged beef or at least rinse the beef to reduce the saltiness.  My hubby is a big salt-eater, though, so it was just fine for him, but it was a tad salty for me.  This one will definitely get a lot of use from us.

I used only one jar of beef AND I soaked it before cooking, and the dish wasn't quite salty enough for our tastes.  I can tell it has a lot of potential, though.  Next time, I'll try NOT soaking the one jar of beef.  The recipe definitely needs pepper, and I think I'll try adding some fresh parsley next time.  We served it over white rice and it was a bit bland, but very tender.

I really liked this recipe.  The taste was good, but after a few bites, it was almost too rich to eat.  My 8 year old daughter only ate a few bites and said it was good, but "too strong".  I ate all of mine but threw out the leftovers.  Probably won't make again.  Thanks for sharing though.

I did not like this recipe. I am giving it 2 stars because I loved the way the chicken "flaked" like tuna fish after cooking all day. However, it also tasted like tuna fish.

This was fairly tasty but I made a few changes to it.  First, instead of dried meat I used prosciutto and just enough to form loose layers.  Second, instead of a slow cooker I placed it in a casserole and baked at 275 for 3 hours covered with aluminum foil.  Third, since it didn't look incredibly appetizing I sprinkled some paprika over the top when it was done, gave it a nice flavor.  Lastly, to give some contrast to the mouthfeel, I sprinkled some japanese bread crumbs over it right before serving with butter garlic rice and broccoli and cheese.

I've gotta admit, all of the glowing reviews of this one surprised the heck out of me. It was VERY dry, the flour.soup/sour cream mixture turne into a strange, sponge-like thing and it smelled wrong. I swear I followed the recipe to the letter. Any idea what I could've done wrong? If I could figure out how to get the glowing results everyone else did, I'd try it again.

Simple recipe, however the sauce broke and seeped clear fluid?  The taste was great, but, did the dried beef curdle the sour cream.

I have been making a chicken dish very similar to this for a great number of years from the recipe book that was included with THE ORIGINAL crock-pot slow cooker manufactured.  The only change in that recipe is that a raw bacon strip is wrapped around each chicken breast.  I found that if I thinly slice the dried beef in strips before placing just enough to cover the bottom -- only --of the crockpot it incorporates into the sauce and makes it much easier to serve.  Dried beef is salty, as well as bacon, so by reducing the amount of dried beef, the blend of flavors of dried beef, bacon, and chicken in a creamy sauce is delicious.   The chicken is so moist and tender and literally falls apart.    My favorite- serve over plain white rice with a side of steamed broccoli.  HINT:  Definitely slightly pound  chicken to try to get uniform size and shape.    The original recipe in the crockpot book requires  1/4 c. sour cream and 1/4 flour.  Make certain that it is thoroughly combined or it will become lumpy and slowly stir into crockpot 1/2 hour before end of cooking -- that will make a very creamy sauce that will not separate.

My mom has made this for years. We only use 1 jar of corned beef (rinse off the salt) and only layer it on the bottom. Plus we wrap each chicken breast with a slice of bacon. 2 cans of cream of mushroom as well. I always make extra so we have leftovers!

Very good but I will alter next time.  Use only 1/2 jar of the dried beef.  Added 1/4 - 1/2 can of milk to the soup mixtures.  Seasoned chicken with garlic powder.

Way too salty with the entire jar of beef.

This is a very tasty and easy dish to make. The one important thing I do is rinse each piece of dried beef. Using it as is makes is too salty, rinsing does the trick!

I've made this a few times and have followed the recipe for the most part. The recipe still turns out great even with minor changes/substitutions. Sometimes I double the sauce depending on what I have on hand. I only use one jar of the dried beef and I rinse the beef to cut down on saltiness. Serve it over rice. My family loves this super easy meal!!

My wife made this yesterday, IT WAS THE BEST, she subed sour cream with 1 can of cream of cheddar soup and instead of dried meat did cooked bacon along with some spices, basil, white pepper and oregano. Our kids loved it to, wish we had leftovers!

This was a good recipe that my husband and I both loved... I only give it 4 stars because it was a bit heavy on the stomach... but is great for very small quantities.

Everyone loved this! I did use 1 can of mushroom soup and 1 can of cream of chicken with herbs soup, increased sour cream to 16 oz container and used half package of Lipton onion soup. Dusted breasts with garlic powder and used 2 packages of Carl Budding chipped beef. Was moist and tender after 6 hours on low. Made alot of gravy!

I loved this recipe. I omitted the beef, and added fresh mushrooms and onion. The chicken was so tender! Very good.
