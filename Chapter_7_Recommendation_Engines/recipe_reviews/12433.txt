Great recipe and so glad it uses honey.  I took this to my pastor's house for dinner and the whole family LOVED it.  This recipe is my new standard pumpkin pie recipe.  It's healthy and VERY good.

However, there is an easier way to cook pumpkin for pie.  Slash three slices in the pumpkin, put in the oven on a cookie sheet and bake at 350 until knife inserts easily.  Then let cool, cut in half, and scoop out seeds.  Then scoop out flesh and process.  It's THE best way to cook pumpkin and preserves the most vitamins.  If you want to roast the seeds cut a lid, remove the seeds, and cook the same. Cooked pumpkins are much easier to slice and work with than raw, which are as hard as mount rushmore!

This recipe makes enough filling for TWO 9" pies. I use 2/3 cup honey and 1/3 cup Lyle's Golden Syrup which makes it sublime. It's spectacular made with FRESH ginger. Really the best pumpkin pie I've ever had!

I freeze leftover pureed pumpkin in 2-cup portions in ziploc bags so it's handy to use for more pies or pumpkin bread later on.

This is the BEST pumpkin pie I've had.  If you want to "taste" the pumpkin and not have it overwhelmed this is the recipe for you.  I cut the honey back to 3/4 cup and boiled the pumpkin instead of baking it, it was faster and easier.  I read pages of reviews before I decided which pumpkin pie recipe to try - YUMOLA!!! I like fresh, I will never buy canned pumpkin again!  After all, I live close to Chez Panise where fresh, good, seasonal produce is IT!!!!

This recipe was awesome. My husband said it was fantastic. I did a couple of changes. I used a regular pumpkin like the kids get on a pumpkin patch field trip. I strained the pumpkin in cheesecloth, which made the pie perfect. I did not use the spices in the recipe since more then a few commented it was bland I simply used 2tsp of pumpkin spice and it turned out just the right spice. I thought it was perfectly sweet with the honey. Also 55 minutes with foil around crust edge was perfect. It made two whole 9in pies for me. A must keep recipe THANK YOU!

WOW! That was sooooooo good! When I mixed everything together, it was very runny. I didn't think it would turn out, but it did! And it was great! Thanks for the great recipe! It was my first time making pumpkin pie!!

nothing like fresh pumpkin pie.  My best tip is to Microwave the fresh pumpkin by piercing it a few times with a serving fork or something long and sharp.  place pumpkin in a plate because it can ooze.  for a large pumpkin, 10 on high minutes per pound works great.  If you microwave 2 smaller ones together it gets tricky with time, you will need to experiment.  cook til skin is soft and impressionable.  LET COOL before scooping out seeds (save 'em to roast and salt and put in candy dishes) or scooping out the meet.  the pumpkin will be much easier/less messy to deal with when cooled.  Second hint:  cover fluting on your pie crust with file or aluminum rings throughout baking.  that temp. is high, they will burn.  I find that it manages to brown through the foil, but if not, remove foil last 5-7 minutes of baking.  yummy!  Oh, also try serving with CARMEL CINAMON ice cream (or carmel ice cream sprinkiled with cinnamon, yummy plus.

I like that this recipe uses all natural ingredients, and tastes great!  I use less honey than the recipe calls for (3/4 c) I have also made it using 1/2 c honey and 1/4 c maple syrup, and it added a nice flavor.

I have made this one several times now.  It has become a holiday favorite in our family.  I love the lighter taste the honey gives.  It was a little scary the first time, as the unbaked filling looks awfully thin and runny, but it has baked up perfectly each and every time.  The only modification I have ever made is adding extra cinnamon to taste.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I love this pie! I've made it for two years now every Fall, and I always make 4-6 pies cause everyone in my family loves them! FYI, I've never used the sugar pumpkins, cause I could never find any, but the larger pumpkins did just fine.  Here are my adjustments/tips: 1. If you plan on using an entire large pumpkin, be prepared to make about 4 pies worth of filling. 2. Double the cinnamon, add a couple of extra dashes of ginger. 3. Hey, why not.... Add a couple of dashes of ground nutmeg and ground cloves. 4. Use a tad less honey (3/4 cup-ish) 5. Try not to bake more than two pies at once. 6. Have fun!

I think that this WOULD have been a good pumpkin pie-if it hadn't had so much honey in it. I will definitely be substituting sugar next time. It was a disappointment to work so hard on a 10 inch deep dish pie, with all scratch ingredients and have it turn out badly. Definitely watch the honey.

Finally! A recipe that doesn't use evaporated milk! A tip - if you don't want to use ground spices, simmer your whole ginger and clove  or cinnamon bark in your milk for a few minutes, then you can cool it down for a few minutes in the freezer before straining into your pie mix. Five stars!

WOW, i was hesitant to try this recipe, but im soooo glad that i did.  I did one fresh and one with canned pumpkin puree. Not much of a difference, so dont worry if you dont want to do fresh, it still comes out absolutely delicious!  I loved this recipe thank you!

I had fresh pumpkin to use, and this recipe called for stuff we can eat on our diet, so I tried it.
Although I cut back the honey a bit and upped the spices, it still tasted quite strongly of honey and there wasn't much other taste.  The texture was very nice, but I had a lot of extra "water".  Perhaps I should have drained the pumpkin puree longer?  The recipe didn't say to drain it at all, but my pumpkin seemed a lot more watery than canned, so I drained it for a few minutes.  I was hoping the recipe took that into account, since it's for fresh pumpkin.
I think that if I cut back the honey further and up the spices further and drain my pumpkin longer, this will be a very good recipe, but as it stands, it's just OK.
My kids really liked it, but it was "their" pumpkin.

I was absolutely thrilled with the way this pie turned out.  The filling would never have fit in one pan, though.  I split it between two pans and used the Best Ever Pie Crust also from Allrecipes.com.  Note: the filling seemed really thin, but thickened beautifully as it baked.  I will use this as my new standard pumpkin pie.  My entire family thanks you for the wonderful recipe!  It is well worth the effort to use fresh baked pumpkin.

Excellent pumpkin pie.  The honey gives it a really rich taste.  Very unique pie, like none I have ever tasted.  Would make this again and again.  I did use a regular jack o lantern pumpkin which I baked and took the skin off and then mashed.  It still was great.

I was very excited about trying this recipe. I love to cook but am not a baker. My husband and I worked  together on this and I must tell you I was extremely disappointed. It was very bland and the texture was terrible in my mouth. I thought it would have been sweeter and more of a cinnimon flavor, even the aroma was not pleasant. I followed the recipe to the hilt. I may try again and tweek a bit the next time.

I was invited to a Huge Thanksgiving Dinner with a bunch of my fiance's friends.  After offering to help with the cooking we agreed to make the pies to free up thw oven.  Together we choose three types, two pumpkin, one apple.  They all came out lovely and delicious, but I have to say this one gets the prize.  Several people asked for the recipie and couldn't believe how healthy and veggie it was. I used 3/4 cup Honey and 1/2 cup Soy milk as a substitute, and pumped up some of the spices to taste.  Enjoy!

I have made this one several times.  I have never had such reviews.  Using less spices than most, it has a fresher, lighter, and creamier taste than other recipes.  The honey adds to the special taste and texture.

BTW- I dont use fresh pumpkin.  I have substituted the canned variety, and it is still wonderful.  

I wholeheartedly recommend this recipe for folks who like lighter tasting pies.

The recipe was certainly easy to follow. Looked runny, but it set well. 1 cup of honey was *really* sweet though, I will reduce it next time to 1/2 - 2/3 of a cup or add more pumpkin. I would use more spice next time. The raw batter was spicy enough, but cooked up you couldn't taste anything. Also, this is WAY TOO much batter for one pie. It's probably enough for two, but I didn't have another pie shell handy, so I simply cooked the extra up as custard.

Made too much filling for a single pie (even though I only had 3 eggs), but it was sooo good.  I reduced the honey a bit and added more ginger.  Firmed up in only 45 minutes using 3 eggs.  This was my first time making fresh pumpkin pie and it was great!

This is a wonderful tasting pie. I only used a half cup of honey. I did not use the cream at all. I used 1/2C soy milk when I pureed the pumpkin because my blender needed  it to blend.

I have made this pie two years in a row. It is a Thanksgiving staple in my house now! I love the honey instead of sugar. I add a 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. Sometimes I double or triple the recipe and always seem to have filling left over for an extra pie.

Excellent recipe for my first ever homemade pumpkin pie! I altered the recipe slightly. I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg & 1/2 tsp allspice, I substituted the milk and heavy cream for 1 c of Lactose free milk. I also mashed the pumpkin which gave it a very hearty texture, which was very nice. I would puree it for that very smooth store-bought texture. I used the whole sugar pumpkin (not just 2 cups) and the recipe made 2 very yummy pies :)

I thought that it was too much salt. I will half it next time. Otherwise, great ingredients.

Delicious pie -- even my wife who doesn't like pumpkin pie likes this one. I use sugar pumpkins cooked in the oven and increase the spices a bit, but it is a very good base to start from.

This was good - I would highly recommend doubling the spices like the other reviews said. It gave is such a nice spice smell and flavor. I also added 1/2 tsp. vanilla.  What's nice about this pie is that is is fresh and it is firm and tastes good with all the spices.  I use the basic flakey pie crust recipe for all my pies - GREAT CRUST recipe. Made up fresh whipped cream and decorated top of pie to finish it. also I used a 9 in. pie plate and still had a little extra pumpkin filling left which can be used to make a mini pie.

Awesome!  The first pumpkin pie I made without condensed milk, and it was worth it.  Definitely add more spices, as many have suggested: I put in 1tsp ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon, and 2tsp vanilla extract.  I also subbed out maybe 1/4 cup honey and put in 1/4 cup molasses, which worked surprisingly well.
A word of caution though - I always baked my pie pumpkin on a cookie sheet with water on it.  If you do it this way, this recipe is kind of soupy and needs longer to bake.

Delicious, i used fresh grated ginger, and nutmeg and was very generous as other reviewers had commented, also used 3/4 cup of honey, that was enough.  Instead of baking the pumpkin until it's soft, i nuked the cut pumpkin in the microwave for 15 minutes it turned out great.

I didn't even like pumpkin pie until my friend served this recipe last Thanksgiving. It's delicious! The honey gives it such a nice flavor, and the fresh pumpkin has such a better texture than from a can. Like others, I added extra spices and wasn't sorry.

Used butternut squash (steamed for 15 minutes, then pulp just fell off the skin), then followed directions exactly.  Well, did add an additional dash of pumpkin pie seasoning.   This came out absolutely divine.  First pumpkin pie I've ever made without canned pumpkin, and wow what a difference.  Truly a spectacular end to a holiday dinner.

This is the recipe I'll be using from now on, for pumpkin pies. The ONLY little adjustment I made, was that I added a 1/2 cup of sugar, about an 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg, and 1/2 teaspoon more of cinnamon. I tasted the batter using the recipe given here, and it just didn't 1) have enough flavor, and 2) wasn't sweet enough w/ just the 1 cup of honey.

This recipe is excellent! This was my first pumpkin pie ever and as I live overseas  canned pumpkin isn't available I had no choice but to start from scratch. I read the previous reviews and also reduced the honey to 3/4 cup and increased the cinnamon  ginger (about 1/8 tsp. each). Also, I boiled the pumpkin instead of baking as suggested in the recipe...much easier, I think. I somehow forgot to add the vegetable oil but the filling didn't appear to suffer because of this omission. I highly recommend this recipe!

This wasn't great. I hate the idea of using canned pumpkin, and chose this recipe because it looked like the best one that used fresh pumpkin. I found that it tasted very bland, even though i added a lot more spice than was recommended, and also didn't really taste of pumpkin at all. perhaps i just used a poor quality pumpkin? however, this did have a very stringy texture - even after putting the pumpkin puree into the blender i still couldn't get it smooth. however, as this recipe did get such good reviews, i would probably try it again, and make sure i use a really good pumpkin. i did make a few changes to the recipe: added more spice, about 2 tablespoons of ground ginger and cinnamon. also, substituted a couple of tablespoons of homey for stem ginger syrup (I live in UK, so don't know if you can get that in US) which tastes really nice - sweet and spicy.

This pie is exceptionally good!!!  I used Marie Callendar's pie shells and actually got 2 pies out of the recipe - way too much filling for one shell.  I followed the directions exactly as given for preparing the both puree and the recipe and I'm really pleased with the results.  Will stick with this recipe as long as I can get ahold of fresh pumpkins!!  My neighbor had an over-abundance of pie pumpkins and I snagged 6 of them.  Got a total of 11 cups of puree, so I froze what I didn't use immediately in 2 C. portions in quart-size zip locks as most recipes call for 2 cups puree.

This recipe was great.  I was worried that it would turn out runny or bland because of the fresh pumpkins and honey but it didn't.  I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone raved!  From now on this is the only pumpkin pie recipe I will use.

Tried this for my first attempt at pumpkin pie and it came out great! Perfect amount of sweetness and spices. I like that it uses all fresh ingredients.  I'm going to make it again for sure, this time in a bigger dish as I had some filling left over.

Excellent pumpkin pie recipe!  I made this last weekend for family dinner and everyone loved it.  I like that the recipe uses honey.  I did take other reviewers suggestions and cut the honey to 3/4 cup and doubled the spices.  Very yummy and I was told I need to make this for Thanksgiving!

WONDERFUL!! I used a small Sugar Pumpkin, about 8-9" across. I was surprised how sweet it was, so I decided to sweeten to taste, put in 1/2 cup honey then tasted it. Ended up adding no more sweetener, but added 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice. It was perfect!! Guests raved that it was the best pumpkin pie they had ever had - they were family, so they were being honest! Will definitely make this again, three times better than canned pumpkin recipe, very tasty! Made the whole house smell like Thanksgiving!

Like others, I used 1/2 cup of honey and 1/4 cup of maple syrup, and it was just the right amount of sweetness with a hint of maple flavour. I didn't double the spices, but I wish I had; they were too subtle for my taste. This recipe was enough for two whole pies.

Just delicious!  My husband loves traditional pumpkin pie recipes, but loved this one.  It has a lighter flavor and color, maybe because of the honey.  It made tons of filling though, so I ended up using half of it for pumpkin bars (a recipe I had on file).  If you used a deep dish pie plate and crust, it might have fit it all.  I will be using this for Thanksgiving.

This pie, using fresh pumpkin, is so absolutey amazing! I live in Japan where sweet pumpkin is avaiable all year round- but unheard of in pie!  Everyone raved about it and it reminded me of home. I believe the key to this incredibly delicious treat is the honey.  I also used freshly grated ginger for added spice.

Very bland, needs more spice.  Should have drained the pumpkin more after baking as it was very watery.  Texture was extreamly light.  I liked the fact that it was sweetened with honey instead of sugar, with a little tweaking this recipe could be good.

I enjoyed this receipe very much I subsituted maple sryup instead of honey, it was very good although you really only need 3/4 c of it instead of 1 cup of honey.  I also subsituded 1/2 cup of soy milk for milk.... It turned out great.. we tend to like healthy desserts with less suger needed.... enjoy..

Great recipe!  Like other reviewers I used more spice (2 tsp pumpkin pie spice).  I also switched from honey to sugar.  I used 1 cup milk, no cream.  Turned out really nice and not too sweet.

It was amazing.  My sister in law and mother in law both said THIS is the pumpkin pie we will now have whenever we have pumpkin pie.  Funny because other reviewers said they got that feedback too!
  I cooked a small pumpkin like as described, then scooped out the insides (minus the seeds which I roasted - also yum) let it cool, pureed it with a hand blender, and then squeezed out all of the liquid through cheesecloth.  That left a little bit more than 2 cups but I used it all.  I also increased the spices (and added nutmeg and cloves) and reduced the honey to 1/2 cup and added 1/4 cup maple syrup (several reviewers suggested this).  Turned out perfect.  I also noticed that the filling was a typical consistency (others said that it was very liquidy)  so maybe that had to do with squeezing out the liquid? It also made just enough for 1 pie.  Highly recommend!

I LOVED this recipe.  Because of all the commentary I doubled the spices and used 3/4 cup of ACACIA honey (the lightest and most mild flavored) and my pie was awesome.  I also added a dash of ground cloves and some nutmeg.

Simple and delicious. The honey adds a great flavor. A little less than one cup would be fine, I used the whole amount and it was sweet but not too sweet.

Really tasty, really easy. The truly surprising thing was that this recipe made the EXACT amount of filling I needed for a nine-inch pie. The only problem I had was that some of the eggs weren't fully incorporated and we ended up with some little white bits in the finished product. But it was still delicious. I didn't have much honey so I substituted maple syrup, and I used butternut squash puree instead of pumpkin because I had a ton of that. Great recipe!

I have been making this for three years now. I generally double the spices and I have cut the honey in half before, with no compromise of deliciousness. I love it and feel no need to look for another recipe. Ever. Love.

Not the best pumpkin pie I've ever had, but good. I always make a recipe as written the first time if I intend to rate it, which was the case here. I think the only thing I did difference was add a sprinkle of cloves. To make it better, hold back on the honey. It was a little overwhelming, and add some extra spices. The pie cooks and sets just fine, even though it seems like it would be too runny when you mix it.

This pie was very good. A little too sweet for my personal taste but still very good! I used fresh nutmeg instead of the ginger and used 1 full teaspoon of cinnamon in this recipe and used a gingersnap crust. The texture was different but I liked it. It seemed too watery but set up just fine. I will make again with less honey.

This is truly the best pumpkin pie I've ever had - and I even used canned pumpkin!  There's something about the honey that brings out the natural flavors of the other ingredients. I can't wait to try it using real pumpkin! Thank you!

It was perfect when I followed reviews to decrease honey to 3/4 cup. 50 minutes and mine is slightly burnt. I also ha enough filling for 2 9" pies. Great honey flavor & great overall pie. Thanks for the recipe.

I buy and cook pumpkins down every year.  A sugar pumpkin pales in comparison to a cinderella pumpkin.  The outside looks dull and boring but the flesh inside is both rich in color and flavor.  It's also easier to clean and cook.  Using a cinderella pumpkin took this already fabulous recipe and made it off the chart.  Paired w/ a whole wheat pastry shell & fresh grated ginger makes this a desert you can have no regrets about but feel good that you're nourishing your family.  Thank you!

LIght and refreshing. I give this a 4 because of the spices. I personally like a little more traditional taste. However, this is a very nice spin on an old favorite!

I made this with one of my butternut squash and it was fantastico!!  Hot out of the oven with vanilla ice cream made it heavenly.  I must add that I do not use crust, I just spray the baking dish with pam and pour in the filling.  Less calories, less work!!  My family gobbled this one up!

This was the best pumpkin pie I've ever had--and usually I'm not a huge fan of pumpkin pie.   I'm living in France for a few months and wanted to make something with the pumpkin my husband carved for Halloween.  I chose this recipe because it's simple and I didn't want to buy a lot of ingredients.  I also don't have a mixer so I just mashed the pumpkin with a fork and blended the pie filling with a whisk--this gave it a chunkier texture than regular smooth pumpkin pie, but we thought this made it taste even better.  The honey also gave it a great flavor, and I used fresh grated ginger.  Still have extra pumpkin in the freezer so I'll be making another pie or two for Thanksgiving!

Very Good! Ilove that it uses honey instead of surgar. I think it could use a little bit more honey though, and AT LEAST double the spices, but I will definately make this again.

I only had 3/4 cup of honey, and that was sweet enough.  But the taste was a unique and delicious twist to the traditional family favorite.  I will probably add a little more spice (nutmeg) in the future.

This was my first time making a pumpkin pie and it turned out great.  My husband said it was the best he ever had.  I doubled the spices like other people had suggested and was glad I did.  I forgot to put foil around the edge of the crust and was sorry I didnt =( but it didn't turn out too burnt even without it.

This turned out beautifully! I don't normally like pumpkin pie, but the fresh pumpkin and honey made this pie delicious.

Not sweet enough for my tooth, but this was one of my first cooking adventures, so I wouldn't necessarily take my word for it. Also, living in the Czech Republic it's hard to find exactly what is on the recipe.  All in all, pretty good.

Not good. The recipe calls for honey instead of sugar and unfortunately the result is a pie that doesn’t quite taste right.

Best pumpkin pie EVER!  The only thing I changed was to add a pinch of allspice and a bit more cinnamon.  Thank you for sharing this recipe, Cali.

This recipe helped me through my first, from scratch pumpkin pie! The Cinderella pumpkin I had, had to cook for quite a bit longer, perhaps because of it's massive size.
The balance of all the spices added in this recipe along with that fresh baked pumpkin, it was worth it!

I kept seeing those cans on sale around T'giving thinking, "Hmm...should I grab those just to be safe?" I didn't to force myself to use my uncut Halloween pumpkin. Even though by the time I was to puree my pumpkin, my Cuisinart mixer of 12 years finally decided to die, (had to run out with just 15 min to spare-Thanks to Sur La Table for staying open till 9pm night before T'giving!) had to buy a new processor. I made two pies and everyone just, "Mmmmmed!" and "Ahhhhed" over this pie! I have to agree. It was out of this world, hands down best pumpkin pie I have ever had! Worth all the effort. Next year, I know I won't have electronic issues and my confidence in baking the pumpkin is there, that this will be a cinch next time!
Definitely give this one a WHIRL!

Want to give it 4.75. Honey was a great sweetener, and paired well with the honey.but, it was a bit overwhelming. Quickly got use to the tast, but it makes a difference   I will be keeping this recipe for future uses, with small recipes tweaks to make it perfect!

It was good!  People ate it--but no one raved over it.  And you can totally taste the honey, so if you don't like a strong taste of honey, you may want to choose a different recipe.  We had it with ice cream, and it was good.

Loved this recipe because it uses honey instead of refined sugar - but I made a few revisions based on other reviews and my own taste.  First of all, I didn't realize how long it would take to cook a pumpkin until the flesh was tender (first time making a non-canned pumpkin pie)!  I boiled my pumpkin whole for about 20 minutes until it felt soft on the outside, and then cut it in half and baked it for another hour or so.  I followed some of the other reviews - and rather than using 1 cup honey, I used 3/4 cup honey, and 1/4 cup agave nectar so that the honey flavor would not be so overpowering.  I also used 2 heaping teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice + another 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. I don't think the original recipe calls for enough spice!    I also added 1 tsp of vanilla.  yum yum! this pie was a big hit at my Thanksgiving dinner! I will be making this over and over.

I am sorry to say that I was disappointed in this pie. More like 2 1/2 stars. The seasoning was off, very bland. It needed more spices. Also, it had an eggy texture, rather than the typical pumpkin pie denser texture. I think 3 eggs probably would have been more than enough. Some people may like that fluffier texture though. Lastly, although I cut the honey to 3/4 cup as many suggested (followed the rest of the recipe exactly), it was still an overpowering flavor. To me it was a honey egg pie with slight pumpkin flavor. All that being said, I will say the pie wasn't gross, it tasted okay. It just didn't have the right texture or taste like pumpkin pie! I have had fresh before and it was delish! This just didn't do it for me, sorry. I may have been expecting too much, after all this had great reviews!! To each his own I guess I must be a bit more traditionalist than the higher reviewers...

This is a fantastic recipe!! Never done a pie from scratch , I always used canned stuff. It turned out absolutely perfect!!! Everyone LOVED it!! I just doubled the spices and added a tsp of pumpkin spice , only because I love the spices , it was soooooo good :) I so recommend everyone try this recipe. Won't make a pumpkin pie any other way from now on.

I had never made fresh pumpkin pie before and was worried it would not come out right.  Boy was I wrong.  Everyone loved the pie compare to the homemade pumpkin pie using canned pumpkin.  I will definitely be using this recipe again.  One last thing, I was able to make 2 pies with the recipe.

Delicious pie! Not too sweet and the pumpkin flavor really stands out. I doubled the amount of pumpkin and the spices too. It helped but next time I'd add even more spice--triple the amounts, maybe. I would not recommend eating this pie right out of the oven. Make it the day before so it can spend a night in the refrigerator, which greatly improves its texture and brings out the flavors.

First, I have to admit that I have limited personal experience with pumpkin pie.  I never cared for it until recently....I guess my tastes are changing as I get older.  My daughter wanted to see how a pumpkin goes from field to pie, so this was our foray, as far as baking one.  I followed the directions as written, but doubling the spices per other reviews.  The end result is kind of bland.  Not bad, just bland.  I will increase the honey by 1/2 cup (total 1 1/2 cups) and add another 1/2 tsp. ginger (total 1 1/2 tsp.) and add another full tsp. cinnamon (total 2 tsp.) next time.  I also added 1 tsp. Watkins Pumpkin Pie Spice and will keep that.  Also, my crust was really bland, though that is not the fault of this recipe and my score does not reflect that.  I will add a dash of sugar to my crust next time.  We'll see how the next one comes out, taste-wise.  Texture- and "set"-wise, it turned out great.  I think this is a good starting point, and just have to adjust sweetness and spice to suit my personal tastes.  Oh....I pureed my cooked pumpkin with my hand mixer, and that made the puree really nice and smooth.  I think it takes a little more blending than simply mashing to get a nice, velvety texture.

I give this recipes 5 stars for its versatility. I actually live outside of the US and needed something for Thanksgiving. Here there is a fruit that is a cross between a pumpkin and a squash that I had heard could work to make a more bland pumpkin pie. With this recipe it was not bland at all. I followed the recipe exactly except, in order to keep it from getting bland, I added pumpkin pie spice. It was such a hit and I will try it now with actual pumpkins when I move back to the USA.

I always make a few different types of pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving with fresh pumpkings. I tried this one because of the honey instead of sugar - I thought it would appeal to the older folks that come to dinner. I thought the taste of honey was too strong, but others there thought it was good. When I make pumpkin pie, I make it for the pumpkin and spice taste, not the sweet honey.

My son's first birthday happened to fall on Thanksgiving this year so I made him this pumpkin pie instead of a sugary cake. He LOVED it. I also made 3 others which I gave to family and friends and they all said that it was the best pumpkin pie they had ever had. Note that if you do not like pulp, you may not like the consistency of this pie as you could definetly taste it.

This was WONDERFUL! I love using honey vs. refined sugar. I used one can canned pumpkin instead of the fresh in this recipe, and one cup of half-n-half instead of the cream and milk called for. Also tripled the spices as suggested by  other reviewers. Next time I will use a bit less salt as well (maybe 1/2 teaspoon). SO GOOD with homemade whipped cream. Will make again!

This pie was delicious. I thought it’d come out with some lumps or something because I don’t own a blender or a food processor to make the puree with; it didn’t. However, it took a lot longer to cook than the 50 or 55 minutes the directions indicate.

I'm not a huge fan of pumpkin pie, I think because I really don't like the taste of cloves. And it seems like every PP filling in the world uses cloves. This one didn't. It's more work to start from just a pumpkin, but the taste is fantastic, and totally worth it! I also used more cinnamon, because I do like that, and it was great.

This pie was amazing! I froze the leftover pumpkin puree so that I won't have to use canned pumpkin at all this winter! The honey is a great touch - sets off the flavor perfectly. This will be my standard recipe from now on.

This pie was easy to make and turned out delicious.  I used a fresh pumpkin that I blended and then drained.  I had enough to make two shallower-than-normal pies.

I was realky excited to make my first real pumpkin pie from scratch starting with the pumpkin. When my family tasted what I had done, they were so pleased. This recipe was really great, especially since I didn't have to add sugars..

My husband and I loved this recipe.  It was so fresh and creamy.  We had extra filling so we put another pie crust into a muffin pan (cut-up, of course) and poured the extra filling in.  It was great.  Mini pies!

i love it! But i made a little changes. Since I try to cut the calorie intake so i didnt use the pie crust, just the filling itself with 2 tbsp of flour and some nutmeg since i love nutmeg. Also i used milk instead of heavy cream but the result is good.

I made this recipe for thanksgiving. I have never made pumpkin pie but this turned out wonderful. I had some left over ingredients so I made some little pumpkin pies by using a muffin pan. I think this become more convenient since you can just grab one and not bother with cutting and using a folk to eat it.

The pumpkin filling didn't have enough substance to it. It turned out very liquidy which made a longer time for cooking it. However, it turned out yummy.

For the first time this year we bough Fairytale Pumpkins. The pumpkins have several large ribs and a blueish hue to the color. They taste great. Will buy them next year. Also cut out the whipping cream and used condensed milk.

When we can find pie pumpkins this is the go-to recipe. This pie is a little more work but so worth the effort. My 13 year old granddaughter who loves to cook was able to pull this off with minimal supervision.  The texture and bite is spot on with the right firmness to the custard and well balanced but not overpowering seasonings. The nice thing about the recipe is that it is not overly sweet and the pumpkin flavor actually rises on the palate. Highly recommended.

I followed the recipe with the same ingredients as called for.  I followed an online advice on how to cook the pumpkin which was cutting in half placed face down on  parchment lined cookie sheet. When the pumpkin is done purée in a blender or processor then put the pumpkin in a strainer to allow the liquids to drain.  I’m not sure if all that was necessary, but the pie came out great. I had enough for another 5 inch pie.

Fresh pumpkins + honey = delicious pumpkin pie!

I had trouble finding a recipe that didn't call for canned pumpkin.  Found this one and gave it try - came out fantastic.  Have made it every year for Thanksgiving the past 4 years, everyone loves it.

I used pumpkin pie spice and Greek yogurt for the dairy. The filling was a bit lumpy, so I used my immersion blender to smooth it, and that gave the filling a nice fluffy texture.

Wasn't the best pumpkin pie, but it was sure good. It was a little bit more "wet" as usual, but it was still perfect.

I made it with coconut sugar instead of honey. It was good! I had to bake it a lot longer than it said.

I made as directed several times and it is so good! I did add extra cinnamon. It seems to get overtly brown on the top, I think because of the honey, but the taste is solid. Definitely my new go to recipe for pumpkin pie.

I've yet to perfect this! I followed the directions to a T both times and each time it's yielded different results. I suggest adding more spices, and place foil along the edges of the pie so they don't burn. Next time I'm adding nutmeg and allspice.

So good!  We used a local raw honey and about twice the cinnamon but other than that we didn't change a thing.  It was the perfect warm sweetness from the honey. We used a standard flakey butter pie crust.

I used the canned pumpkin purée - no time for other. This is the first homemade pumpkin pie I've had and it was great; not too strong of a flavor.   I will try the fresh pumpkin next time.

This was my first time every making a pumpkin pie from scratch. Everyone loved the pies. Even someone who hates pumpkin pie liked this pie. I will keep on making this recipe. The only thing I changed is I added a little more ground ginger and cinnamon. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

There is entirely TOO much honey in the recipe. What is more, the pie tends to be runny, so I suggest that addition of tapioca starch or corn starch if you are willing to try this SUPER sweet pie.

Following the reviews of others,I altered the recipe slightly. I did a half cup of honey, only 3 eggs, and omitted the heavy cream. I did use about a 1/4 cup milk to puree the pumpkin in the food processor and added a dash of nutmeg. Was very easy to make. The batter did seem thin but it cooked up perfectly. Absolutely superb pumpkin pie! Highly recommend it.

I followed this recipe precisely he first time. It was lovely! 

The second time, I messed with it a lot to make 'breakfast pie' for our kids. 
Instead of the 1c of honey, I used 1/2 c of overripe pears and 1/2c of honey and maple syrup mixed. 
Instead of heavy cream and milk, I used 1c of 2% milk. 
I also added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla to enhance the sweetness. 
Finally, I think I added a bit more spice to taste.

It still turned out super yummy, and I felt better about it as a breakfast pie! 

Next time, I may try 1/4c honey/maple, with 3/4 cup overripe pear/applesauce. If I do, I'll let you know how it turns out :)

This was so delicious!  Everyone loved it at Thanksgiving and said it tasted like real pumpkin.  A couple of notes: I upped the spices.  I used 1 t cinnamon, 1 t nutmeg, and 1 t fresh grated ginger.  I also shorted the honey a little and added a couple T real maple syrup and a splash of black molasses.  I followed the recipe exactly otherwise, and yielded enough to make an 11-inch pie.  Also, I followed the advice in WILSONWIFE's review (thank you!) and roasted the pumpkin whole the night before.  It was so easy to work with and cooked perfectly!

Its too sweet with the full amount of honey. Starts to taste like egg with the full amount of egg. Use only 1/2 cup honey and/or maple syrup. Only use 2 to 3 eggs. Used 1 cup of heavy whipping cream or 1 cup half and half instead of milk and cream.

I hate to be one of those people who didn't follow the recipe -- but I changed it.  I had just one small pie plate, so after adding the spices to two cups of mashed pumpkin, I stirred in 1/2 cup honey, 1/2 cup cream, and three eggs.  That made more than enough filling for one pie.  It was delicious!  My mom said it was one of the best pumpkin pies she has eaten.
From a previous experience making pie from fresh pumpkin, make sure you scrape ALL of the stringy stuff off before cooking, because that stuff has a terrible texture.

Pumpkin pie is my favorite and I have to admit, at first I had my doubts about this pie. How could it be good if you don't use sugar? Boy, was I wrong. Looking for healthier options is why I tried this and it is a hit at my house! We call it our guilt free pumpkin pie. One thing that I might do is experiment a little with the spices, just because, I love the fall spices. Thank you for your recipe! So glad to have a recipe for my favorite pie that is guilt free and healthy!

I have been using this recipe for the last 5 years; it is always a hit. As is is wonderful, but I add a pinch of nutmeg & ground cloves to mine. The honey is so complementary in flavor to the pumpkin. It makes enough for two pies, so be aware. We top ours off with some fresh whipped cream. Mmmm... So good!

We called ours "honey pumpkin pie" because the honey flavor was SO strong. Next time I'll only use some of the honey called for. Otherwise, this was a very tasty pie.

I've made this several times now and adore it! I pressure-cook sugar pumpkins in wedges, then puree. I freeze it in 2 cup increments in zipped bags and can make this any time I like. The taste is utterly wonderful, nothing like the canned pumpkin that I used to think was marvelous. No more!

Wonderful pie.  I let the pumpkin drain for a few hours after mashing  and putting through  a sieve.  The flavor and texture were perfect. I followed others suggestions and doubled the spices, adding fresh grated ginger, and using 3/4 C of honey.  My family loved it.

This is the best pumpkin pie I've made in 30 years.  Extraordinary taste.  I made the following small modifications: 1) used 3/4 cup honey; 2) used 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp cardamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp ginger (important to grind these spices together prior to adding to mix).    To cook the pumpkin, I cut the pumpkin in half and cleaned the insides, then placed both halves (inside down) in a 9x13 glass pan with 1.5 inches water.  Placed pumpkin in 375 degree oven for about an hour.    Used a gluten-free pre-made frozen crust purchased at Whole Foods; pre-baked crust in 375 degree oven for about 5 minutes and covered the crust with an aluminum shield.    Delicious!

I really like the fact that this recipe does not use sugar.  Next time I will probably use 3/4 cup of honey b/c 1 cup is a bit too sweet for me.  I added nutmeg and used evaporated milk instead of the milk/whipping cream.   A solid recipe.

The taste of the honey was way too overpowering and did not go well with the ginger. I am not sure why, because the recipe sounds lovely. Perhaps it was just the variety of honey I used.

This is so much better than pie using canned pumpkin and sugar. The honey gives it a great flavor!

I baked my pumpkin until the crust became crispy and I could just peel it off. Next time I will only add 1/2 or 3/4  cup of honey. It was slightly too sweet for me.

Not Bad, if you closed your eyes it tastes pretty much like the " home made from the Can recipe". Color seemed too light and maybe needed to be pureed more before I made again.

great basic recipe. checked all the reviews and found a few useful. used 3 eggs, doubled the cinnamon, added 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp pumpkin spice and next time will try 1 tsp ground cloves too!! It wlll sweeten the recipe further without excess sugar. Also using honey in baking and cooking changes its properties so it is not advisable but I used 1/2 cup cane juice sugar, and 1/2 cup jaggery which contains many nutrients, minerals and protein too. If you can't find powdered jaggery use turbinado sugar. And definately, as a reviewer commented use foil for edges.The pie was fabulous, and not too sweet but the natural sweetness of the pumpkin came through.

pumpkin pie just does not get better than this. I was totally bummed because the local international store did not carry canned pumpkin, so I thought my pumpkin pie craving was going to have to be ignored - thank you for posting this recipe... I know so much better than the can now!

This recipe is great!  I added a bit more pumpkin puree than the recipe called for just to make it a little thicker.  I also added a bit more cinnamon because my family loves that spice.  The honey did wonders and no one found it overwhelming (I used 1 cup).  I had enough filling to make two declicious pies!

first time using fresh pumpkin.  Texture was fine, the flavor was just not something we were used to.  I'll try again with canned pumpkin before deleting from recipe box
