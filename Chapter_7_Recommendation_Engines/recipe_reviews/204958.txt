The way my grandmother taught me to cook sinigang is to never use ginger for the meat version of this dish, only for fish or shrimp. Also, using pork chop lends to the meat getting a bit too tough. Better to use neck bone or pork belly with some rib meat. The latter tends to be a bit fatty, but that's part of the dish's character. Lastly, you can opt not to cook the onion and meat in oil, just put the meat, onion, tomatoes, salt, and water in the pot until the meat starts getting tender. Then add the gabi (taro). Put in a hot pepper or two when the taro starts to soften. By the time the meat is cooked, the taro should be almost done, too, so no need to take them out. This is the time to add the tamarind soup mix. If added too early, the meat absorbs it, and the broth ends up not being too tangy, and the meat ending up tangy (for fish and especially shrimp, the soup base is added EARLIER). Add the green long beans; you can also add water spinach (you can get these at most Asian stores). Also, the best thing to eat with sinigang is rice that's NOT newly cooked. If you're having sinigang for dinner, make sure to make the rice at least two hours before (I make mine by lunch) and let it cool off a bit. You can microwave.

Pork sinigang is my absolute favorite filipino dish. One of the most delicious things about sinigang is that you can add almost any kind of leafy green vegetable like bok choy, baby bok choy, or spinach. My family has always included a lot of green vegetables. In addition, we add radishes. Lots of radishes. Then the end result is a full complete meal. Try using pork country ribs as well which is absolutely delicious.

I make this like my friend I work with makes it. She uses radishes and spinach, no tomato or ginger but I would try it with both. Tamarind soup base is hard to find where I live, only one little shop that's only open two days a week. Love this soup!!

I prefer using pork riblets(pork spareribs cut into bite sized pieces) rather than whole pork chops. Also we add Daikon radish sliced into 2" - 4" pieces. One reviewer says she can't get the Tamarind Seasoning mix easily in her town.  Mama Sita's Tamarind Seasoning Mix (1.76 oz.) is available online from several vendors for not too much money. Does anyone keep their Tamarind Seasoning Mix in the freezer?  If so, why?

Honestly, I tried this recipe and it just wasn't like others I've tried. I did a major swap out from pork chops to country style ribs, pork shoulder/pork butt or picnic pork, basically something with fat. My two VEGES of choice (besides standard onion and garlic) are daikon (white Japanese radish) and mustard greens (I prefer Chinese mustard greens but American mustard greens work well to) Also, i don't like the ginger or potatoes in recipe.  I'm not a fan of green beans, tomatoes or eggplant in it. But if it's in it, I'll still eat it. I've never used knorr sinigang seasoning powder. I prefer a brand I find called "mamasita"
Sinigang mix.

Added fish sauce. That and the tamarind seasoning are the secret ingredients. Also added bok choy, kale (I was out of spinach) and gabi (toro). Delish! Thanks for the recipe!

Good flavor but added a little fish sauce to reduce the sour taste and added okra, finger peppers &  bokchoy. Eggplants are good to add but it was $11 so I didn't buy it.  Thanks for the recipe!

I'm not a good cook by any means, but I can certainly follow directions! The recipe was pretty spot on. My hubby and I wanted more vegetables so I increased the water to 6 cups and added 1 bunch of Spinach (removed the stems of course), half a Daikon raddish (or "gabi") to the green beans the recipe calls for. Since the Daikon raddish comes in this huge foot long stock, I only used half and sliced up the rounds failry thin (I remember my Mom would cut them in chunks). Also, I didn't have tomato sauce handy and substituted ketchup instead.  Recipe is must try for 1st time or occasional cooks!

First time trying my hand at sinagang. This was a good simple recipe, can't really mess it up. Bone-in pork boiled w veggies n spices. The original recipes call for real tamarind n not the packet, but this was good and easy. I took the advice n browned the meat first in oil before , and then added some minced garlic and fresh ginger. Also added 1 whole fresh daikon for texture. Doubled recipe n used 2 lbs chopped baby back ribs to 10 cups water.

I follow this recipe pretty closely except I don’t use very much ginger. The bit i DO use i chop very finely. Also, I add OKRA and BOK CHOY along with the green beans. I love tomatoes so I also add 1-2 more depending on size of the tomato. My entire family LOVES it! It’s been a hit! It’s def a HIGH DEMAND meal, they ask me to make it at least once every other week!

Wow I loved this! My mom was raised with traditional Filipino food and doesn't like tamarind, so when I made pork sinigang for her she was hesitant. However I think using the packet of tamarind soup base instead of fresh tamarind made the flavor much lighter and she really enjoyed it. When I made this, I added twice the amount of ginger called for, and spinach towards the end of cooking. I will try adding fish sauce next time and perhaps with shrimp, but this recipe was great!

Amazing! Loved how the soup was salty and tangy! I think this is even better than the sinigang I had at a restaurant! The only changes I made was that I added baby bok choy instead of green beans and instead of using fresh chopped ginger I used 1/2 tsp store-bought chopped ginger. Delicious!
