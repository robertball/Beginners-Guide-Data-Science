I made this today for dinner.  The title says it all!  Drunken, indeed.  Bf said the sauce reminds him of the Jack Daniel sauce at TGIF that he likes, but the alcohol in this was a bit too strong.  We used Wild Turkey whiskey because that's what we had, so we may try to use Jack Daniels next time or use less.  It makes a lot of sauce in comparison to the Kielbasa, so I may use more Kielbasa next time.  I tried it plain and on a bun; it was good both ways, we will just modify the alcohol a bit next time.  Thanks!

I thought these tasted delicious. I used two packages of keilbasa but did not double the liquids based on other reviews that there was a lot of liquid. I added just a few more ounces of the ketchup and bbq sauce. I did use a little more brown sugar and kept with the 1/2 cup whiskey. Simmered on low for 6 hours just as stated and was very pleased. I did taste test throughout the day, and it seems that while it tasted good throughout the day, the long simmering time really does the trick and they became so tender after the full 6 hours.

These were delicious! Be sure to add whiskey. I used vodka since that was all we had but whiskey would have been even better.

I used grape jelly, omitted the brown sugar and cut back on the whiskey. I also added pepper and cut up a sweet onion and added it to the bottom of the pot. This'll be good beside rice or macaroni and cheese.

The alcohol is this is way too overpowering for us.  I tried one during the last hour of cooking and decided to drain them in a colander and rinse.  Then I remade the sauce without the alcohol and put on high for about 45 minutes.  Good sauce.  Will make a again just without the alcohol or a lot less than called for.  We used "lite" kielbasa and it was tender and good.

Tangy & zippy!  Very delicious.  I made it just as listed in the recipe.  As one other reader indicated, it did make a lot of liquid.  Probably what I would do next time is add another kielbasa and a tad bit more of each liquid.  Will certainly be making this one again.  Thanks!

I made this for our Pot Luck at work and our St. Patrick's Day party the next day, and everyone LOVED IT!!  There were absolutely no leftovers! :)  I couldn't get over how easy it was to make and how good it came out!  I cut down on the whisky on the advice of the other reviews and added just a bit more brown sugar and it was just perfect.  We couldn't stop "testing" it before our guests started arriving, lol.  I will definitely be making this again - thank you so much for sharing! :D

This is very similar to a recipe in a little cookbook that my mother was given by the Philadelphia Electric Company, who sold and installed the electric stove in the kitchen of her new house in 1934!  Differences: no barbecue sauce, sliced hot dogs instead of kiebasa, and some Worcestershire sauce (to taste). This is especially good with Irish whiskey (NOT Scotch, but you could use bourbon). You can use small cocktail sausages, but they will soak up the flavors better if you cut them. Some hot pepper flakes will give it some zip, and it keeps well -- can be made a day or two ahead. I often saute some onion and add it late in the cooking, but you can get away with raw onion at the start. If you find the alcohol to be too strong, boil it a bit with the top off at the end to evaporate some of the spirits -- but leave SOME, at least.

These are really good when you cook them for the right amount of time, but when you over or under cook them, the tastes don't quite work.

Simmer. Simmer. Simmer. It takes a couple hours to thicken. STIR OFTEN so the bottom doesn't stick or burn.  This is not a fast recipe. The bourbon adds such a nice flavor!  We have used Captain Morgan's too on accusation and everyone loved it - but I prefer the Bourbon!

Like many people said, this makes a lot of sauce for only one package of sausage. I cut all the ingredients in half and used one package, and I still thought it was a bit too saucy. The sauce was good though! I used a sweet and spicy BBQ sauce and cut back a bit on the whiskey. My husband wants me to make it again.

Made these for my last party and had many ask for the recipe. I didn't double the sauce at all and used a little less of the whiskey and cooked 4lb of kielbasa. Excellent recipe:):):):

Tasty and oh so easy, especially in a pinch when your hubby's friends show up unannounced! P.S. I usually split the sugar with splenda for saving a few calories and no one knows the difference:)
