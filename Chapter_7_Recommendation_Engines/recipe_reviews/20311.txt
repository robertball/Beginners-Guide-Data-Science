Great recipe!!  I took other reviewers advice and had a great turn out.  I did cut the cookies on the bottom edge so they would stand up straight- very easy.  I also chopped the cookies for the bottom part of the pan which made it easier to cut slices later.  I used frozen raspberries- thawed and drained them then sprinkled with sugar before using.  The whole thing turned out incredible!!

added "Dove" dark choc. ice cream topping to center and drizzled it again atop the last rasp. layer, also used the double choc. milanos. put a dab of cream filling to bottom of each milano in order to "glue" it to the pan and they will stand up. 3 packs of cookies is perfect, no extras though. the added choc. topping makes for a great presentation, people couldn't believe it was homemade! Thanks for the recipe.

Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous! Just cut a small slice off the bottom of the cookies to get them to stand up. My husband's co-workers (the lucky recipients of the leftovers from Easter dinner) couldn't believe it wasn't storebought. I can't wait to have my next dinner party so I have an excuse to make it again.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone was amazed.  This was easy to make, looked fabulous and the taste was fantastic!  By cutting a bit off the bottom of the cookies, they stood up easily around the cake.  I chose to chop the cookies for the middle layer and added melted chocolate to the middle and the top.

Absolutely delicious.  I followed the advise of other people and crushed the cookies on the bottom and middle, which worked perfect.

This is a great recipe! It was so rich that I skipped the second layer of raspberry pie filling. It was so tasty the entire cheescake disappeared from the fridge in about two days!

This tasted ok.  The milano cookies make this different from other cheesecakes, but I'm not a fan of this recipe.  I did enjoy the raspberry layers however.

Very good recipe. I used it for New Years Eve dinner and it was delicious. It did take my husband and I to do the crust, but that's not all bad. Only ended up using 3 bags of cookies. The flavors were wonderful. Oh, I also used  with frozen raspberries in syrup because I couldn't find the pie filling, wish I had I bet it would even be better.

This recipe tasted great.  However, the cookie crust was a pain to set up.  It took my husbands help and tin foil to get the cookies to stay on the sides until I poured in the filling.  The presentation also wasn't too great since the sides like to come off when you slice it.  But overall it did tast great and I will make it again someday.

I couldn't find raspberry filling so I used strawberry instead and it turned out great. It is quick and easy but I found myself with an extra package of cookies at the end.

This was soooo gooooood!!!  It was really easy to make and my family just loved it.  Definitely cut the tops off of the cookies to make them stand easier.  I refrigerated it overnight and it held up beautifully the next day.  Thanks Debra, this recipe is AWESOME!!!!

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner.  It was a big hit!  Everyone loved it and wants it again at Christmas.  I did what was suggested, and broke off a little bit off the ends of the cookies when standing them up on the sides.  For the bottom and the middle, put cookies in a sandwich bag and crushed them. Also used 1 bag of Raspberry Milanos, which are hard to find, and 2 bags of milk chocolate milanos.  This gave a great extra raspberry flavor.  Will make this again with cherry, or strawberry. To the cheese mixture, I also added a tablespoon of lemon juice, to make it taste more like a real homemade cheesecake. So easy and great results. Hope these suggestions help.

First of all, raspberry pie filling does exist.  I only found it at one store (Albertson's).  Secondly, the presentation was very nice and I did cut the tip of the milano cookies to allow them to stand up better.  However, I don't think I will make this dessert again.  I thought it was just ok.  I instead would recommend the "Raspberry Trifle" dessert which tastes a whole lot better and can also be found on this site.  But if you are a TRUE cheesecake fan, then give this one a shot.  I like cheesecake but I don't LOVE it like some people do.  5 stars for presentation, but only 3 for taste.

This recipe was easy but time consuming. I like many others was unable to find rasberry pie filling and ended up using frozen rasberries instead. i added sugar to them so they would create their own syrup.  I followed a lot of peoples advice by cutting the cookies to make them stand up. then i crushed some to make the bottom crust and chopped some for the middle layer.  The cheesecake looked wonderful and tasted pretty good except that there were sooooo many rasberry seeds.  I also agree with another review that this would make a better layered dessert because it's so hard to cut and serve.

This was very yummy & looks great, but a little difficult to cut with your fork.  Next time I'm going to make a "crushed cookie crust" for the bottem and middle cookie layers.  Great party dessert!

I will never buy cheesecake in a store again.  To die for.  Everyone loved it, couldn't get enough.  I crushed shortbread cookies and poured melted chocolate over them.  I didn't have raspberry preserves, so I just defrosted and liquidized frozen raspberries.  This resulted in an unstable structure, because the raspberries were too fluid, but next time... I will make individual "cheesecake trifles" in glasses - layer the cookies, cheesecake and fruit, which will give a beautiful presentation but no trouble with the instability.  CAN'T WAIT.

I used lowfat cream cheese (neufchatel) and chocolate raspberry Milano cookies to make this luscious dessert. I took it to a surprise party and had to hurry to get a piece for myself! Delicious!! A keeper.

This is one of my husband's favorites!  I, too, cut the cookies and it was much easier to make them stand up.  The flavors are divine...I only wish the crust were a bit thinner--it's pretty thick.  But, the presentation and taste make it a repeat in our house!

I didn't even know they made raspberry pie filling; it tasted great along with the cream cheese layer! Cutting the bottoms of the cookies was a great suggestion; it makes for a really beautiful presentation and was easy to assemble! I crushed the cookies for the bottom and middle layers as per others' suggestions. I wish I hadn't; it gave the cheesecake a grainy texture, and it kind of fell apart when I served it. Next time I will leave the cookies intact, but I would definitely make this again.

This is a great recipe and makes a nice presentation...I couldn't find raspberries, so I used blueberries and probably will not use those again!  I think next time I'll try cherries...should be much better.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is very yummy, pretty, and easy to make.  I took advice and used tinfoil to hold the cookies up around the edges.  It took me 1-2 minutes that way!

I thought this one was VERY easy to make and tasted great.  It was a little messy to cut and serve.  I followed the advice of some reviewers and cut the "crust" cookies so they had a flat edge.  This worked well.  I couldn't find raspberry pie filling so I used the same amount of frozen raspberries.  I think if I make this another time, I'd try using a simpler sugar cookie on the layers and put this in a trifle.  I think it would be easier to scoop out than to cut and serve as slices.  I would be more of a layered dessert than an actual cheesecake.

I found this recipe is quite versatile.  I have modified it by adding 1 cup of melted semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1-2 teaspoons of instant coffee (that has been melted with the chocolate chips) or four tablespoons of cocoa (though I prefer the chocolate chips) and the instant coffee melted in a little of the heavy cream.  Any heated ingredients must be cooled before being added to the whipped cream.  This makes a very delicious and rich chocolate cheesecake that people will think you spent hours preparing!  For the edging, I have used chocolate Oreo cookies.  For the raspberry topping, which is also delectable on the chocolate version, I have used raspberry jam, which I have found extremely effective.  I would imagine other flavors of this cake could be made easily with an addition of various fruits or flavoring.

This was delicious but very rich!  A trick I used to get the cookies to stand up on the sides was to fold aluminum foil over the rim as I put the cookies in, and then I was able to put the fillings in no problem.  Great recipe!

This cake is awesome and the perfect desert for company!The one thing is it is pricey to make so if you can find a Pepperidge farm outlet store to purchase the cookies it would save some money. I made a couple of changes, on the bottom layer I mixed the raspberry with the cream cheese to make a raspberry layer, also I Drizzled melted chocolate on top, very pretty.  This recipe is the best!!!

I made this with my 11yo who loves to help (Down Syndrome). It was Soooooo easy and tastes professional.  We did add a layer of milk chocolate and it definitely added another layer of richness. We will definitely be making this again.

I chopped the bottom layer of cookies and added 3tbs of salted butter to that mix before pressing it into the bottom of the pan. The springform pan I used was 10 inch because my 9 inch bottom is MIA. Cut the bottom edge of cookies so they would stand, as well. Otherwise all same, and best cheesecake I've ever had!

I didn't much care for this cheesecake, but the person I made it for loved it, so the recipe is definitely good. I used strawberries instead of raspberry pie filling, since he doesn't care for red raspberries. I liked that it calls for very little sugar. Easy recipe!

Excellent as is.  Definitely used crushed Milano's for crust and middle layer.  You only need 2 packages of Milano's if you do this!

Easiest cheescake I have ever made, and i have made a lot of cheesecake! It all comes together nicely and most anyone can make it!
Things I altered after trying the recipe: use oreo crust instead of milano crust-cheaper and gives the cheesecake a nice overall taste.
chocolate on the top: tastes good and looks nicer- but is a little richer

I couldn't find raspberry pie filling, so used blueberry, but would be good with cherry or strawberry too.  Everyone ooohh'd & ahhhh'd over it, and thought it was a great idea to use the Milano cookies.  Only problem was it's hard to cut a slice of it, as the cookies are the "crust" and they are thick.  Otherwise, was perfect!!

I made this for some dinner guests and they seemed to really like it. I am torn. I loved the inside, so I think I  might try this with a different crust next time.

This has to be one of the best desserts I have ever made!  It can be expensive with 
all the Milano cookies, but it is worth it!  It is very rich, but it only took about 5-10 minutes 
to make.  My friends still talk about it!

What an incredible dessert!  The store where I purchased the ingredients did not have raspberry pie filling, so I substituted cherry pie filling.  It was to die for!!  The only trouble was getting the cookies to line the springform pan, so I laid one layer sideways around the pan, spread the first layer of filling in, then laid the second layer of cookies in.  I can't wait to make this again!  Sharon, Silverdale, Washington

I think this is an unusal way to making a cheese cake - Loved it!  I did take a little work to get the cookies to cooperate but it turned out to be a second helping desert.  The last time I made it I used blueberries instead & still turned out wonderful.
