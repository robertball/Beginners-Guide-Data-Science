This is a really good recipe.  I also used prepared mustard instead of powdered, and added 1 TBSP of milk to soften up the dough a bit.

I used buttermilk baking mix instead of flour and did half with cheese and half with cooked crumbled bacon.  They were light and crispy.  The ones with the bacon definitely went faster.......

These were ok, but agree with the previous poster who mentioned that the dough was dry. I also added about 1/4 cup of skim milk which helped to form the dough. These weren't bad, but I'd add some Italian seasoning or crushed red pepper next time to give it a little kick.

Tonya. This is a SUPER good and EASY recipe!! Thank you SO MUCH!!! I was reading the reviews and I really had to laugh. I guess some people have no clue, the difference between "prepared mustard" and "dry mustard". But oh well, I know the difference and I would not eat these with prepared mustard. The dry mustard gives just the right amount of hot for me and mine. I'll use this recipe always. Again, thank so much.

Easy to make and tasty.  The only change I made was I used prepared mustard instead of dry.

My husband and I though these were just great. I chopped up some bacon and tossed that in (because I LOVE bacon) and I used melted butter as well. They were just right after baking for 12 minutes. I'm going to be making these at parties for sure!

I used various shredded white italian cheeses (because that's all I had) and melted the butter (so no need for the milk). Turned out tasty!

I love cheezy snacks so these were a hit for me :) As others, I added a splash of milk and used 'prepared mustard'... I also halved the called for amount of butter.

Making these a 2nd time a year and a half later. Decided to use half whole wheat flour & half all-purpose flour. Again used half the butter & dijon mustard in place of ground mustard. Also sprinkled some sea salt on the tops before popping them into the oven. Yummy :)

I think I undercooked them a bit.  I added some cayenne pepper for a bit of a kick and loved the flavor.  They were certainly easy to make!  I added a bit of milk as suggested also.

The 'dough' was way too dry to form a ball. 
I added 1/4 cup milk to the mixture, and a bit of chili flakes for some spice. Came out fairly well.

These Puffs are easy-to-make and tasty as well.  I added finely chopped cooked bacon to the mix.  I also added a bit of milk, as even with the melted margarine, the mixture was too dry to form into balls.
I doubled the recipe and made 50 walnut sized puffs.
It's the sort of recipe I'll make up a huge batch and freeze to have available.  And, yes,I do know the difference between dry mustard and prepared.  I used the dry as per the recipe.  Second batch I added parmesan to the cheddar for an extra cheesy flavour.
Thanks for the recipe Tonya.
