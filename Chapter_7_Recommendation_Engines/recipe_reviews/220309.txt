This would have been better if the cucumbers had been quartered and sliced.

Loved it! I added a tablespoon or so of sugar along with red and yellow small peppers. I was great. I agree with kelliann. The cucumbers would have been better quartered.

Very excellent! My husband had three servings so that tells you how good it was. Also, I did add a little bit of sugar as well to help drown out the vinegar. Over all, I would make this again!

always find it odd that people use low fat mayo then add oil, also I assume they used the corn raw as it does not state to cook first. Will be trying as soon as a tomato ripens.

My mom made cucumbers with vinegar all the time and I never liked it.  This was amazing though!  Not too overpowering, I was worried adding all the garlic powder that it would just taste like garlic but it was lovely.  I left out the corn cause I didn't have any and I used Apple Cider Vinegar which gave it a little sweetness.

I love this salad!  It is perfect as is or when adding additional garden veggies and/or sour cream to help thicken it up. People love when I bring this to picnics since it's different than your traditional vinegar cucumber salad. (I love it too because it's inexpensive!)

Used a spiralizer on the cucumbers, and then quartered those. Used cans of diced tomatoes and corn. 1 yellow onion was on hand so I chopped the onion fine and sauteed that in butter for 5 min to take make it sweeter. Replaced the  salt with celery salt. Added fresh avocado and some lime and lemon juice to keep everything looking fresh. Tasted great and even my wife who hates cucumbers liked it. Thanks Walter! I will make this again.

This was refreshing. It didn’t wow me but it was easy to make and my husband enjoyed it. A little plain for our taste but I can see how many people would like it.

I love this recipe.  I read the reviews before making this so I quartered the sliced cucumbers and added 1/2 cup of diced red bell peppers. I also used minced garlic instead of powder.  I will definitely make this again.  My family loved it too.

4-12-2016  ~As we were sitting down eating our dinner of French Dip sandwiches Hubs remarked, “I don’t know where you got this salad but it’s really good.”  Hmmm, that was interesting.  I had held off writing this review until after I knew what he thought about it; I wasn’t too impressed with it and thought I’d have him weigh in. I thought it was entirely too tangy even after making some changes to fix that.  First, I added some sour cream to mellow out the tang and it did help some, but now it had more dressing than it needed.  So I added sliced celery and green peas and that helped that issue too.  Beyond that I used fresh garlic rather than garlic powder and added some green onion and fresh dill, which added some flavor elements I think this needed.  Still, I thought it only mediocre – but what a difference a couple of hours made!  Now it was creamy, full flavored, lively, very interesting, and the tanginess had really settled down.  I thought I wouldn’t like the raw corn kernels but I was happily surprised that they added a unique freshness and flavor.  At the end of the day, with the above-mentioned tweaks, this was a 5-star winner – for both of us.

Delicious if you're a cucumber fan. I served it over a bed of greens. I added the tablespoon of sugar.

Best cucumber recipe ever!  I omitted the onion & corn, used Roma tomatoes and the whole family loved!  Next time I might peel the cucumber to make my 3 year old happy. Definitely quarter them, as others recommended.
