I've made this several times for guests and it's a big hit.  I double the beef to give it more density and serve with slices of baguette.

This needed more of something, so I added 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder, then put into a baking dish and topped with 1 cup of sharp cheddar cheese then the pecans.

This is very, very good BUT in my opinion it definitely needs more dried beef.  I used 6 oz. of dried beef, added a teaspoon of toasted dried onions and a 1/4 teaspoon of worcestershire sauce.  With the extra beef it's salty so I served it with toasted french bread instead of crackers.

This is absolutely delish! I made it for Super Bowl and they licked the dish. This is going to be in the front of my recipe box for a quick and easy hit.

Great Recipe!  My mom used to make this when I was a kid... total comfort food!  I added a small can of mushroom stems and pieces as this is what she used to do.  Yummy!

I get requests for this dip and the recipe all the time.  I do add a little garlic.  I make it in a crock-pot on high until bubbly, and then on warm to serve.  I serve it with thin slices of "french baguettes" recipe from this site.

I added a can of mild green chilies and this made it tastey. Everyone loved it.

I did double the beef on my first try, simply because my family loves meat.  Made this for a party appetizer, and my entire family thought it was great.  Very easy to make.

Way too salty.  This recipe has potential, but it will need some tinkering.
