Used peanut butter instead of peanut butter chips and added it to the condensed milk before pouring it over!

I was looking for something easy and impressive for a business event and this fit the bill.  It is exactly like 7-layer bars w/o nuts and coconut.  I too added 2Tbs sugar to crumbs and melted butter mixture and firmly pressed into pan. I   noted that when I went to cut, the crust started to crumb.  I placed the pan in the frig and it firmed up and was easy cutting and it all stayed together perfectly.  Plus, these are great right out of the fridge.  These are soooo yummy and could not be easier and very addictive.  The only thing I would change for next time is making it equal parts chocolate and PB chips b/c the PB chips can get lost in the flavor.  This would be great with ANY combination of chips or toppings ie. butterscotch, heath bars, etc. And, they are so rich, a small pan goes a long way b/c you can cut these in tiny bars - that way one could have a taste and not feel overwhelmed by the sweetness if so inclined.  I got raves, plus, these freeze well - I had made these in a double batch 15" pan and now have for stop-in guests!  BRAVO and thanks so much.

I added 2 T. of sugar to the graham cracker crumbs and melted butter to give a bit of sweetness to the crust; I also pressed the crust in, so the bars wouldn't crumble. I used a mixture of peanut butter and chocolate chips (1/2 package of each). They turned out well.

My husband LOVED these! I mixed the butter, graham cracker crumbs and condensed milk together in the pan and then spread it out, instead of layering them. We used one full bag of each of the chips on the top, and these were awesome!

YUMMY! I took the advice of others and mixed the butter with the graham cracker crumbs and then add the condensed milk to that mixture and mixed it in. Then I put it in the bottom of the pan. I added Hershey's Special Dark chocolate chips, almond slivers and topped it off with caramel sauce (ice cream topping). Baked for 20 minutes and that was that. I allowed it to cool and then refrigerated it. I couldn't wait for it to get cool! DELICIOUS and so many options to make it your "own" creation. THANKS!

Kids liked this, but I didn't.  I think if I incresed the graham cracker crumbs and made a thicker crust it might be better.

These were incredible.  The first time I made these I didn't have any peanut butter chips so I used 1 cup of peanut butter and softened it in the microwave before mixing it into the condensed milk.  I then dumped all ingredients in a 9x13 dish, mixed it with a spatula and then pressed it down.  AMAZING!  The next time I used the pb chips and was a bit disappointed.  USE PEANUT BUTTER INSTEAD . . . so much better.

Very easy to make. As suggested by others I added 2 Tbls. sugar to the crumbs and 2 Tbls. of creamy peanut butter to the condensed milk because many suggested the peanut butter flavor got lost in the chocolate flavor. After they cooled I put the pan in the frig. overnight but still had difficulty cutting them without losing alot of the crumb bottom. Very sweet so I suggest cutting them into tiny pieces. Will make again but would spray Pam on the pan first.

These bars taste good and are incredibly easy to make.  Anyone who is looking for a quick and tasty treat should try making them.  It would be impossible to mess them up.

An easy recipe that I managed to complicate! I didn't have peanut butter chips on hand, so I was going to replace it with peanut butter. When I pulled the peanut butter out of the cabinet, I had about a T. instead of a cup's worth. Onto plan C! I made my own peanut butter out of peanuts, a few squirts of honey, a dollop of canola oil, and using the food processor! Once smooth, I added the 14 oz. sweetened condensed and processed that all together. I also used the food processor to make the graham cracker crumbs (use about a package and half of crackers), poured it into my liquid Pyrex measuring cup, melted butter in the microwave, and then added the butter into the crackers, mixed it together, and then pressed it into the 13x9. Now here's where I went a little crazy...I've had coconut flakes and finely chopped pecans on hand that I have no use for. I sprinkled those on top of the crust, sprinkled 6 oz. of chocolate chips on top of that, and then I plopped the peanut/milk mixture over top of that. I spread the mixture evenly over the top using a rubber spatula and my finger and then I added the other 6 oz. of chocolate chips over top of that. After it cooked, I spread the chocolate chips across the top so there was melted chocolate as the topping. Everyone loved these! Only thing I'd do differently is either bake the crust for a few minutes, like you do with cheesecake, so it holds together better or I would drizzle a little plain sweetened milk over the crust to act like glue

You can never go wrong with any variation of these sort of cookie bars ...no matter what they are called, butter, graham crumbs, chips and whatever makes them great!  I made these by warming my condensed milk with about 3/4 c. chunky peanut butter because I didn't have peanut butter chips.  Then since I had about 1.5 cups of chips already opened I mixed some chocolate chips, a few white chips, and then coconut to complete the two cup requirement.  I think the chunks in the peanut butter really made them A+.

Great flavor.  I wish I had used more graham cracker for the crust and baked bars for only 25 minutes.  I baked my bars for 30 minutes and they turned very hard.  I would try again altering the recipe a bit. Thx for sharing.

I made this recipe as written and I love the taste and how simple it is to make. However, I thought the crust was to greasy and crumbly. I plan on making this again and reducing the amount of butter.

They were very simple to make which is what I was looking for in a quick dessert to make with my daughter. We didn't care for them at all. we followed the recipe exactly but used peanut butter as some one suggested. It just turned out too sweet and not a very nice texture either. Might be something I did but I won't be trying these again

Excellent! I topped the bars with one bag each of chocolate chips and peanut butter chips and they were great! I brought this to a party and everyone wanted to know how I made them. It was so simple and the one pan really goes a long way. Very rich, delicious, easy treat!

This recipe was so easy, I love that! I only used a half of a can of the condensed milk since others said it was too sweet. Worked out great! I mixed the graham cracker crumbs with the melted butter right in the pan with a spatula, then poured in the milk and flattened it. Very easy.

These are pretty good for how easy they are to make.  Good with walnut, too.  My one suggestion is to refrigerate before cutting, or the crust will kind of fall apart.

Not what I expected at all.  Very crumbly, even though I had it in the fridge.  It also had an overwhelming flavor of peanut butter, which took away from the chocolate.  I was expecting a cookie taste, but didn't get anything close to that.  Will not make this again.  Very disappointed.

Grease the pan first, and used less butter, and mixed all together, then I sprinkled the graham cracker crumbs on top. Rave reviews for a bake sale.

Very good and very easy to make.. I needed a fast desert and that is what I got.  I was out of semisweet chocolate chips so I used white chocolate chips. I also had no peanut butter chips so I just added creamy peanut butter to the sweetened milk. It worked just fine and was YUMMY

These bars were awesome. I was a little worried at first that they wouldn't firm up while cooking but it worked out great. I took the advice from the other reviewers and added sugar to the graham cracker crumbs and butter. I used mini chocolate chips and regular peanut butter chips. It smelled really good while baking too. Thanks so much for the recipe!

These are so easy to make and taste great!  The chocolate and peanut butter are a rich combination and taste great together.  I just put the butter right into the 9x13 pan and pop it in the pre-heating oven until it melts - saves me a dish.  Afterwards baking, I melt 6 oz. of semi-sweet chocolate and a teaspoon of Crisco in the microwave, stir until smooth then drizzle over the top of this dish - looks more polished, IMHO.

I have made this several times and I'm getting ready to make it again right now! So quick and they are in the oven in a snap.  The only thing I tweaked was less chocolate chips and more peanut butter chips.    I recommend this recipe highly!

I also added 2T sugar to the graham cracker crumbs, which I then mixed with the butter before putting into the pan. It's much easier to spread and press than adding the crumbs to the butter in the pan. I also put in 2 cups peanut butter chips with the 2 cups chocolate chips. This recipe is the most requested dessert at any function where I am invited.

This is my go to recipe when my house is invaded with teenagers.  I use what ever crackers I have on hand and throw them in the food processor.  Pretzels work great too.  I change it up to add nuts and/or marshmallows.  I even made an apple and peanut butter version by subbing in cut up apples & cinnamon for the chocolate chips. Delish!

I made a large pan, with half chocolate chips and half peanut butter chips and chocolate chips. I've also made pans with all chocolate or all peanut butter chips. My co-workers gobble these up. They also sold well at my son's team's bake sale.

Well........ my sister and I made this and kinda....well...... failed.  We made 2 of these and in each one we put a whole box of graham crackers.  thats the bad part........ BUT on the bright side we could peel off the top and it had a crust!  It was a hit a my brother-in-law's work! Great recipe!

Easy, rich and delicious. After making the crust, I didn't even measure the rest of the ingredients. Just added enough S/C milk to cover and then sprinkled an equal mixture of chocolate and PB chips on top. Great when you want something really sweet, but don't have a lot of time to put something together.

I had to make a few changes to this one - the first was to use peanut butter instead of the peanut butter chips (don't know what they are but they sound great!). The other change was diet related, where I omitted the butter & instead mixed the peanut butter with the biscuit crumbs - mix of smooth & crunchy. The result was so yummy & lasted about 5 mins! Will definitely make them again, but not for a few days or so. Stupid diet :o(

as written, this would be more of a chocolate chip/peanut butter bar.  I was looking for something with more peanut butter flavor with a bit of chocolate to compliment.  I added a couple heaping tbsp chunky pb to the condensed milk, and only added about a cup of choc chips, and 1 1/2 c. pb chips.  I got more of a pb flavor that way.  this does not make a thick bar, which can be a good thing since they are on the richer side.  I would caution not to pour the condensed milk mixture  and spread it, as the crust is not partial-baked, it will pick up the graham crust. (however it didn't affect the end result).  I would suggest pouring in a smaller stream over the surface and not worry about spreading it out.  I too added about 1 1/2 tbsp sugar to the crust and did it separately in a bowl, not in the baking dish.

Was excited since it was quick and easy. Followed instructions and even took advice from other reviewers but bottom always crumbled and failed to look presentable. Won’t be making again. Really wanted it to work. [extremely sad face]

I think this recipe is fantastic. Everyone in my family likes it. I would say you can replace the graham cracker crumbs for a granola crumbs but graham cracker crumbs are by far the best. I’ve used whatever I had on hand like ground up oatmeal ground up granola and oatmeal or just plain graham crackers ground up. Everything is good but the graham crackers are the best. I also like to use peanut butter that I have on hand versus going to buy peanut butter chocolate chips because Ivery rarely buy them. This is something that with a few key pantry items that you typically I have on hand, can be made anytime. So I always do the typical recipe and just replace the peanut butter chocolate chips with peanut butter smeared into the sweetened condensed milk. Same cooking time same everything else. Great recipe thanks!

This cookie was predictable - lots of chocolate and gooey sweetness.  I mixed the butter, graham cracker crumbs and S.C. milk together, as did other reviewers.  It came out very tough around the edges, even after only 25 minutes of baking.  If I were to make it again, I would put it in a pan lined with buttered foil or non-stick foil to make it easier to take out and cut.  That being said, I probably won't make it again.

I wanted a simple, tasty treat to serve for the Christmas season. This recipe is just right. I followed the steps and added some pecan pieces & M&M’s. I cut the bars into small squares and served with coffee after Christmas Eve dinner. I made a double recipe that I will take to our family Christmas dinner later today. Adults & kids will enjoy these cookie bars. Thanks for such a stressless treat...

I stumbled across the recipe by accident while browsing through my phone at the grocery store trying to find a different recipe. Figured what the heck and gave it a shot. It's been all the rave now. The kids ask for it to be made every week and even though my husband hates sweets, he's been seen sneaking bites here and there. One thing I did find to make it come out better was use a smaller dish vs. the 9x13 pan, everyone liked a thicker crust vs. the thinner one. Will continue to make this.

These are a real hit!  I bake a lot for church functions and don't taste things before I take them, so they have to be good without tweaking.  This recipe is very yummy as is, but I can see lots of little additions you could make if you want to change it up at all...marshmallows, nuts, different flavors of chips.  This is one of my new favorites--you can very quickly make 2 or 3 batches for taking somewhere too.

I thought these were okay, but kind of too sweet for my taste. (I gave half the batch to my neighbors, and I haven't heard their opinion yet.) I made it exactly as written, and baked for a middle time of 27 minutes, which I think was a little too short. I would've liked a thicker graham cracker crust for these, and perhaps a little less sweet stuff (condensed milk and the peanut butter and chocolate chips). A good idea, but as is it didn't wow me. Still, I might try making a modified version sometime.

I took the advice of other reviews and used real peanut butter instead of the chips and mixed the condensed milk in with it before spreading it onto the graham cracker crust. Also i mixed the butter with the graham cracker crumbs and then spread on the bottom of the pan. My husband and company loved them and ate half the pan in one sitting. I personally thought they were too sweet, yet hard to stay out of. All in all a pretty good recipe.

My brother called from Florida and had gone thru all the goodies I sent a week ago and asked for more.  As it is snowing like crazy here (really unusual)  I can't get out.  I went thru the cupboards and made things from what was here.  This recipe looked good and got good reviews so it was added to my stuff.  I used butterscotch chips and white chocolate chips.  Also sprinkled chopped nuts over the condensed milk.  A really big hit--The family just loves it.  And it is so easy to make.

These were ok-- a little too much crumb on the bottom for me and a little too buttery.

This was very easy, but almost sickeningly sweet. I think this would go over better with kids than adults. I mixed the graham crackers & butter together and pressed them into a 9x9 inch pan. 

I would make this again, but I might add some nuts for crunch and to cut the sweetness.

This recipe was so easy and a great hit with my family.  I used chocolate chips and heath chips, then I sprinkled coconut on top.  It was rich, but so delicious.

I substituted chocolate caramel chips for the peanut butter chips, and WOW this is so yummy.  Like eating a candy bar!  I think it would probably taste even better with some coconut sprinkled on top.
