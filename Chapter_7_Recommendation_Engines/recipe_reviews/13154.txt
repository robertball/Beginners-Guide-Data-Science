I really liked this recipe.  The only reason it doesn't get a five-star rating is that my chili powder is very strong, and so I found this a bit too spicy for my taste.

Delicious! Thank you so much for the awesome recipe. It was just what I was looking for.... and the addition of dill.

I added a little more of the seasonings; otherwise, kept it the same and it tastes great!
