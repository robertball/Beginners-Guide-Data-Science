This was great and super easy to make.  It was a hit with the whole family!  I really like the eggplant.  Would also be good with sweet peppers.  I did a couple tiny changes: I used a whole cup of shredded mozzerella instead of 1/2 cup.  I also used two whole eggs instead of egg substitute and added extra garlic.  Thanks for a great dish I will make over and over!

I made this last night and it was surprisingly great! I used a jar of tomato and basil spaghetti sauce instead of the canned tomatoes and tomato paste to make it easier and it tasted great. The eggplant is a healthy alternative to using ground beef. I also used a bag of fresh spinach instead of frozen, and just sauteed it for a minute with a little bit of olive oil and garlic salt until it cooked down. Delicious meal!

This was nice, but a little bland without all the salt. I added some plus extra garlic and cheese. Even though this is good without ground beef, I think it could be delicious with ground Italian sausage.
