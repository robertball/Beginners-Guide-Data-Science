I have had this recipe since the early 90's, a friends mother (could it be the same mom?) made this for Christmas & my husband & I like it so much I got the recipe from her.  I have been making it almost every Christmas since.  It isn't your "ususal" fruitcake.  Love the nuts, the dates and maraschino cherries together.  I have frozen it before for a month or so and it was even more moist than after you bake it.  If you like fruitcake a little bit, I think you will like this the best.    I am headed to my kitchen to make it after I finish this review. :-)
