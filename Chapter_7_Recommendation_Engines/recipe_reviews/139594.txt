I did not have powdered chocolate drink mix. What I did was substitute homemade sugar free chocolate syrup. I also used one packet Truvia sweetener. For me, I think that this would have been plenty sweet with the chocolate syrup--the Truvia was unnecessary. I think that there was a little too much milk, too. That said, this was very good base recipe to play around with. I think this would be good as well with a VIA packet or half leftover cold coffee in place of the milk. I'm going to play around with this recipe and see if I can't get it to where I REALLY like it.

Very good recipe.  However, to cut out the sugar completely, I substituted 1 Tbsp. Hershey's cocoa powder for the powdered chocolate drink mix. Tastes great!

It's awesome, but I had to add a few ice cubes to make it more like a shake. Yum!

I don't know what I may have done wrong? But, this tasted more like a slim-fast shake than anything. It also had the same consistency. This is definitely not what is known as a "shake." I made it because I am trying to cut back on sugar some. I recalculated the recipe to serve 1, but it made enough for 2 people. If you are looking for a quick healthier chocolate drink, you might really like this. Although, the drink is like a thin chocolate malt and the banana is barely recognizable in taste, for some reason. It is not something I would make again, but was filling for what I drank of it today.

I was making a mocha shake, but it ended up more like this recipe. Has all the same ingredients, but some coffee and a little dark chocolate coffee creamer in it as well. Good stuff. Hits the sweet tooth spot without being insanely high in empty calories like ice cream, cake, brownies, etc.

Funny, the simplest things are so good!   Just found out that I'm a diabetic and this seems good for that "in-between snack" (a lil' over 2 points)

Yummy :) All I did different was add a few strawberries I had and used regular sugar since I don't have Splenda.

3 tablespoons is too much, next time ill only use abound 1 tablespoon . I also added ice to make it less watery or a frozen banana next time.

A nice afternoon pick-me-up. I used a frozen banana because I like my shakes/smoothies really cold. I also omitted the Splenda; my Nestle Nesquik 25% Less Sugar made it sweet enough.

It came out really thin and all I could taste was banana.   Next time I might add more chocolate and some ice cubes.
