My freshly picked blueberries were so good that I was worried that putting them in a recipe would diminish their goodness. This recipe was worth the sacrifice of a few berries! Added 1/8 cup tapioca since some people mentioned it being runny. The consistency was terrific.

Delicious recipe!!! I adapted a little because I only had 2 cups of rhubarb. I also used 1/4 tsp of nutmeg instead of 1/8, and I also added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon.

This was easy and very good! I made it for a family get-together and it was gone in under 5 minutes! I served it with a side of whip cream and it was fantastic!

The blueberry and rhubarb taste really good together! However, this pie turns out really runny even if allowed to cool for 24 hours. The flour taste doesn't cook out really well either. The thickener needs to be altered to make it a perfect pie.

Perfect recipe! I used fresh blueberries and frozen rhubarb and took the suggestion to add 1/8c of tapioca to the filling. Worked perfectly! My favorite pie!

I made this pie the other day and it was amazing!! I substituted the lemon juice for a bit of lemon extract and the nutmeg for cinnamon just because that's what I had, and used half whole wheat flour and half regular white flour.  I bought my crust from Trader Joe's.  I loved this pie and so did the other people who tried it.  I will definitely make this again!!!

i had to use frozen rhubarb, maybe that was a problem.  This pie is really tart, and like a previous writer noted, really runny.    Did everybody else use fresh rhubarb?  I'm in SW Florida, cant get it here.  Blueberries were fresh, maybe I needed more sugar and some tapioca .  Not sure, I'm not a baker.  One thing, though, I dont think anyone else is going to eat this, too sour.

This recipe was so fantastic and easy.  I love the bluebarb combo and the ready made crust makes it so quick to make.  I cut the sugar some and would cut more next time, but that's my general taste and not for everyone.

Very good combination of rhubarb and blueberry.  A very nice sweet tart.  Great flavor. I did alter it as per other recommendation by adding 1 1/2 T of tapioca to the fruit mixture to make it less runny.  I used frozen berries because i already had them on hand and so i had to cook the pie longer but it came out great!  I will definitely make this again.

I added a little cinnamon, but otherwise cooked the pie per the recipe. It was a great blend of flavors.

This is a wonderful recipe. Even my mother, who doesn't care for pies, loved this one. It served up easily, and the taste was amazing. Blueberry and rhubarb compliment each other well. I only changed a couple of things. So the crust would bake thoroughly and brown nicely, I reversed the length of time for the tin foil to cover the crust. Rather than 50 minutes covering it and 15 minutes browning, I didn't cover the edges until the last 15 minutes. It turned out beautifully. In addition to sprinkling sugar on top, I also brushed the crust with in an egg wash.
