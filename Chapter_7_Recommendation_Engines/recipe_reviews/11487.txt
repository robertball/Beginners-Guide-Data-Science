I made this recipe a couple of times and we are very satisfied with the result. The balls really tastes like the coconut balls in Hungary (we are from Budapest, so we know) and it is easy and quick to make. In Hungary they make these balls from crashed biscuit and sour cherry, but the mashed potatoes and the lemon soaked raisins taste exactly the same. Unbelievable! I used vanilla extract instead of rum, so my 1 year old boy could also enjoy. 
The other alteration I made to this recipe (to fit our taste better) is that I soaked the raisins longer in lemon+vanilla (2 hours) and drained them before adding to the potato mix. Thus I left lemon juice out of the mixture (added 1/3 less sugar at the same time) which helped to keep a more solid consistency and resulted in a more coherent sweet taste. (The original recipe yields a bit "piquant" coconut balls as they are a bit sour.)

I have prepared these a couple of times according to this recipe for my Hungarian boyfriend.  He loves them and says that they taste just like the ones he ate at home!

I have made a very similar candy. If you are having trouble with the consistancy  of the candy you must use "plain" mashed potatoes. Try to use a baked potato from the microwave and mash it until lump free. Do not add any moisture to the potato.

I am hungarian and we made this ball with a special biscuit called H치ztart치si Keksz.  It needed to grind first, or you can buy grinded biscuits.

Came out very wet, not a dough but can form them and roll them in dry coconut or cocoa and refrigerate them. Seems like this needs way more confectioners sugar or some other dry ingredient or very dry mash potatoes. Taste very good. Used real rum called Cocoribe.

I tried this recipe, followed it exactly, but had bad results. The mixture turned out very thin and I wasn't able to form them into balls. I really would like to try this again, but I fear I will have the same results.

I think the previous reviewer was right.  Soak the raisins for a while (I did mine overnight) then scoop them into the mix and toss the rest of the liquid.  I didn't strain them, just scooped them in.  I reserved the remaining liquid in case I needed it, but the consistancy seemed right without the couple spoon fulls of liquid that I didn't use.  They were fantastic when done, just like I had in Hungary when I went to visit my family.  Kosonom!

My husband is Hungarian. His mother doesn't make them with potatoes, instead with crushed cookies. So, it was a shock to him when he tried it. I didn't add the raisins or lemon. He said they're "Not his mother's kok칩s g칩mboc" lol!

I'm a potato lover, so I tried, but wasn't a fan.
Walmart Animal Crackers are the closest to the cookies we use in Hungary. You have to grind them, will look like breadcrumbs.
No lemons are needed.
(Grinder is hard to find, I got mine on Ebay)
