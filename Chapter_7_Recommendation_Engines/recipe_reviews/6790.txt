Sorry, I just wasn't a fan. I was looking for more flavor like a dark nut bread or pumpkin bread type loaf. It was very moist. Just not what I was looking for.

I really liked this bread. I made it with whole wheat flour and added 1/2 cup of pumpkin seeds and 1/3 cup of sunflower seeds and 3 tbsp of flax seed. It was super nutty and yummy.
