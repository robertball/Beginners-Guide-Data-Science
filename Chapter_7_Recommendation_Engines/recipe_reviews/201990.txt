Yum! I really like this recipe, it's a great way to use fresh cherries, the sauce is spicy and sweet, very good. I served it over hot cooked white rice. Thanks!

This felt like a gourmet meal! I agree it could have used more jalapenos. But it certainly was tasty served with Spanish rice. I'll certainly make this again.

I am always searching for creative ways to use the abundance of cherries I harvest from my two large trees every year and this one was a hit with the family. I did make some slight changes to it though. I replace the pork with boneless, skinless chicken thighs and added an extra jalapeno for heat. Then I added a two more tablespoons of honey to up the sweetness to balance. Finally, I found the sauce simply too runny so I thickened it at the end of cooking with 2 tablespoons of cornstarch mixed with water. Served over hot cooked rice, even my three young picky boys gobbled it up. I will definitely make this recipe again

This was just ok for us.  There was nothing wrong with it, but it didn't wow us at all.  It definitely could have used a few more jalapenos.

This was very easy and tasty, I'm not a huge fan of cumin so therefore the flavor was not my favorite but that's just personal taste. The recipe is very good

I had high hopes for this recipe and was disappointed. I followed the recipe exactly and end product did not have much flavor, just heat. I wound up adding more honey and the remains of a bottle of taco sauce. That helped but I still was not pleased. Family said they liked it. In my opinion, sauce needs to be thicker. Probably wonâ€™t make again.

My BFF made this while I was visiting, and I had to have the recipe. She used red bell pepper, which makes for great flavor and color, and doubled the garlic. It has great flavor...hot, bold and sweet. When I made it, I used her tweaks, and used more honey to even out the heat. I brined the pork overnight so it doesn't get dry. I can't wait until cherry season so I can make it again!
