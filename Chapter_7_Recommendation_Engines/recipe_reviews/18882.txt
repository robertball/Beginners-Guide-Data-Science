I think the younger generation... just doesn't "GET IT!" This is a mid-century recipe from a simpler time, that sooooo many seniors grew up eating (and loved as kids, I might add). It is what it is! You want to add greem pepper, mushrooms, a sprinkle of cheese; I can understand that. BUT... when people completely change the recipe by using marinara sauce, tomato sauce, stewed tomatoes, diced tomatoes, Italian or Mexican spices; it's just NOT the same recipe! And aren't we all getting a bit tired of the BUZZ word "BLAND", it's so freely used to describe so many recipes on this site. PLEASE... like it or not; rate the recipe as written.

This is my great-grandma's goolash recipe :) She lived through the depression so I have lots of these easy, Campbells soup recipes from that time, and remember how often her and my mother made these meals when I was little. It's wonderful, cheap and easy. You cannot sub the soup for marinara sauce, it is NOT the same thing. * Also, you kind of have to appreciate this meal for what it is, a basic and cheap, depression era meal that serves a big family for pennies, this is not a gourmet meal. If that is what you are looking for please spare this a bad review and look for something else.* I usually season my meat with season salt, pepper and garlic, maybe some other stuff if feeling fancy but that will do. Sometimes add a can of diced tomatoes or peppers as well. I usually save just a little of the tomato soup for the leftovers, as they tend to get a little dry, so I save just a little to spread on top before sticking in the fridge.

Great recipe to build on! Tried this tonight, and the family loved it! I tweaked it a bit, after reading the reviews...used slightly less pasta, added some garlic, italian seasoning, a teaspoon of beef bouillion, and a 4oz jar of mushrooms...and it made a big batch, enough for dinner and the leftovers will make a couple of hearty lunches! Thanks for posting April, great recipe!

Edited to add: I've made this multiple times since my first review, and I now use 3 cans of tomato soup...and I thin it a bit with about a 1/4 cup of water...2 cans of soup is not enough.

I make "American Chop Suey" a couple of times each month using one 28oz can of crushed tomato with puree instead of soup.  Now that we're all adults at home, I add a bit of cayenne and lots of fresh ground black pepper. With a green salad and fruited jello for dessert: a classic diner supper. [[I've always thought the recipe name is a New England one; may be different elsewhere]]

Boring to say the least. Use marinara sauce instead of tomato soup, add some seasonings, mix in and sprinkle the top with a shredded cheese of your choice.

This recipe is so super simple and great as a last minute dinner meal! I added mushrooms and garlic. Hubby loved it! I used different kinds of pasta, liked it best with rotini. Will definitely make over and add other recommended items.

I used 4oz macaroni and 1 can tomato soup for my husband and I.  It was very good.  I have been making something very similar to this for years that we prefer.

I have been making a dish very similar to this and my family loves it. I use 1 1/2 pounds of ground beef, add a bit of minced onion, celery and green peper while cooking the beef and then you add 1 can of tomato soup and a small can of tomato paste. The best ingredient I add is small chopped pepperoni bits! It really adds a good flavor and kick to this recipe.  I add the cooked elbows to the ground beef mixture,cover with your choice of cheese and bake for 1/2 hour at 350. Delicious!

Oh...am I mistaken...I was looking for a recipe for Chinese style chop suey and I came across this...I am shocked...this is the base for a typical tomato meat sauce with pasta...my husband was looking over my shoulder and started laughing hysterically...I guess I was expecting and "Americanized" chop suey recipe, not this.  Sorry.

OK, I never would have believed it unless I tried it,but this is a quick, easy and surprisingly tasty meal. The thought of using tomato soup instead of sauce just seemed, well, weird.  But the end result does not taste like tomato soup with pasta!  I like to add a clove of crushed garlic to the beef while it is cooking and serve it with liberal amounts of parmesan cheese!

Okay for a quick meal, but not something we will probably have again. We used tomato sauce instead of the soup and had to add Italian seasonings. It needed something else, maybe some green pepper.

This should of been called hamburger helper. It was really bland. I added a cup of cheddar cheese and a little sour cream. After that my husband was able to eat it. I don't think ill make this again.

This was very good.  I was worried about using tomato soup (I have always used sauce in the past) but it was tasty.  The only thing I added was to place the mixture in a glass pan and cover it with american cheese slices.  I put it in the oven and baked until until the cheese melted. (This was what my grandmother always did)

Quick, easy and makes alot with a little effort.  I used 1 can tomato soup and 1 can of manwich sauce.  It is kind of hamburger-helper like but at least I know the ingrediants are fresh and not as high in sodium.  We enjoyed it!

I made this last night , so quick, so easy and so good with such basic ingredients. The family loved it. Perfect meal to make when you don't know what you want for dinner or if ya just don't want to be in the kitchen for long. If you liked cafeteria food from high school this reminds me of the mystery macaroni mix, just throw some american cheese slices on top a there ya have it. Try it, I know you'll like it.

This is a good base.  I made this last night and added a touch of garlic and onion powder along with salt and pepper.  Unlike some of the other posts though, I would avoid adding too many other spices, otherwise you end up with classic italian meatsauce.  To me American Chop Suey is meant to be simple, not bland but not overly spiced either.

Huge hit with the kids, second time it was made, I added a touch of garlic, placed in oven and added some shredded cheese. Either way, it was well loved! My picky 3 & 6 yr old LOVE IT! Kinda boring and bland for dad & I, but it is good.
Should be called "Macaroni Casserole"

This is a great recipe.  However, my mother added different spin on the recipe with grated cheese.  That is my favorite part of the recipe.  Near the end of preparation I freely add cheese, right from the container type works fine.  Try starting with 1-2 tablespoons but if you're like me you'll be adding more ... I even add more at the table.
Hint: I don't quite use all of the cooked noodles - perhaps 2 cups less to make it a bit moister - but that's my taste.
Try it you'll like it.

The kids liked it, but next time I either mince the onions really small or leave them out entirely (the kids are not big fans of onions, but they add so much flavor to the recipe).

I changed this recipe slighly to suit what I had in my cupboards.I used ground pork,garlic and mushrooms.I then added one can of tomato soup and half a carton of passata(strained tomatoes).I mixed this with the macaroni and then put it in a casserole dish and topped with cheese and baked it in the oven.I have used the original recipe before ,which I liked,but my family prefered the changes.

There are so many versions of American Chop Suey but when I'm in the mood for it this recipe is the flavor I want. It's what I grew up with. The only other must have additions is diced green pepper and Parmesan cheese. For the tomato soup, it has to be Campbells brand.

I am a 71yr old woman who grew up eating this dish, with however a couple of additions. This version is not for the "healthy minded', but ohhh so much flavor. If you can find it, buy, from your butcher, or sometimes your supermarkets carry it, but you would have to ask for it, a piece of ""suet"which is nothing more than a piece of "beef fat".  Render this along with you onions, and GREEN PEPPERS, (this is the real flavor additive).  Cook as recipe states, and enjoy.

this was a wonderful recipe! Although I made changes into the recipe..I used whole wheat elbow macaroni, can of low sodium peas and carrots, added italian sausage, used crushed can of tomatos and can of red pepper and fennel diced tomatos with tomato paste..I also used red onion, a red and yello pepper..To increase fiber and protein I added black eye peas. For extra flavor, I added tsp of each: cumin, red pepper flakes, garlic, and chili powder! my husband and I went for seconds, yum!

This was good, but I added garlic, mushrooms and a lot of seasoning. It was otherwise bland. I think it makes a wonderful base where you can then add your own extra ingredients. Next time I want to try it with corn. My kids ate it, so I will definately make again.

This recipe was not that great. I froze half of it to give to my sister next week when she has her baby but I bet she won't like it. Tomato soup makes it very weird

I make this for my family ALL the time.  My boys (ages 6 & 3) request this at least once a week, but I make it about once a month, so they don't outgrow the taste of it too quickly, since it's SO easy to make!!

I used ground turkey in place of the ground beef and spiced it up A LOT with some oregano, crushed red pepper and cayenne pepper.  It was great for a quick weeknight meal--but nothing too fancy.

I grew up with American Chop Suey too, so it was fun to find this recipe!  It couldn't have been easier to make!  I added some garlic powder to the meat as it was browning and some Italian Seasoning and onion salt to the sauce.  After it was dished out we sprinkled on some cheddar cheese!  It was yummy!

This is very similar to a dish my grandparents always made, they called it Slumgullion. But instead of tomato soup they did tomato sauce and added cumin and chili powder. Definitely a family classic. (:

I added chili pepper and mushrooms (like another reviewer mentioned) and upped the number of cans of tomato soup to 3. Also, I wanted to bake the dish, so I sprinkled a bread crumb and cheese mixture on top and baked it for 20-25 mins at 425 Fahrenheit with some foil on top.

This is a great, quick recipe.  I add some type of chopped tomatoes  with the tomato soup (using marinara sauce makes it more like spaghetti sauce). I also add some spices.

My grandmother used to make this & my husband made fun of me when I told him it was called "American Chop Suey".  I am delighted to see it on this website. This recipe is the exact one my mom used to use and I loved it as a kid!  However, as an adult I have tweeked it some using Worcheshire sauce, chopped green pepper and It. seasonings while the meat is cooking.  Makes for a much more palatable dish!!

I did the same as others and used this as a jumping off point.  I used 1 can tomato soup, 1 can sauce and one can diced tomatos.  Also added cheddar and mozz. cheese and some spices.  3 1/2 yr old son ate it constant for two days, would eat nothing else until it was all gone.

I've also grown up eating it and we always called it goulash as well.  Instead of just buying noodles I always buy a pack of very inexpensive macaroni in a box. Instead of throwing away the pack of cheese that comes with it, sprinkle some on ...as much as you like (not on the whole pan because some like it without/not as much).  If you're not a big fan of tomatoes (which a few kids I used to nanny for and my roommate now, aren't) it brings a cheezy taste to it.  Also, I add diced tomatoes and instead of soup I use sauce.  I also put in a few spices here and there like basil and oregano.

VERY VERY CHEAP! And you can make a LOT for your money! Freezes well also, better than the heat and eat tv dinners!

My grandmother used to make this for us when we were kids.  We loved it then and still do.  The only thing different was she would fry up some bacon, crumble it, add to the pan as the last ingredient and let it simmer to incorporate the flavors.  My husband loves it!  I think if you use anything but Campbell's tomato soup you will not get the best results.

This turned out very well for me. I was exoecting a blah boring dish, but I was surprised at how tasty mine was. Of course I tweaked a wee bit so it was probably a result of my adjustments that made a difference. First of all, I used dried minced onion about 2 T and 1/2 tsp onion powder instead of using fresh. 1 onion is a whole lot, so I wouldn't recommend using THAT much unless you really love the flavor. I also seasoned the meat with a sprinkle of garlic salt and some Season All and a few grinds of black pepper. I used lean beef so it did not require draining. After the beef browned I tossed the dry pasta right in with a little olive oil and sauteed it first for a few minutes before adding the soup and then I started with about 2 cups of chicken broth and simmered the whole thing until the noodles were done. I added a bit more broth as needed while it simmered. I really loved the end result and it turned out rich and tomatoey and had a nice sauce. I don't think by following the original though and skipping the simmer, you won't get the same end result I did. My result was a 4 star dish, but I want to rate this as it is written, so I am only going to give it a 3 to be fair and not try to mislead people whose dish doesn't turn out quite like mine. Thanks for the great base recipe, I had fun tweaking and turning it into my own yummy creation!

I made a version of this that turned out very well.
I used 1 pound of not to lean ground beef 80%-20%
and cooked it with the onion.  I added a couple of squirts of Lea & Pearins, and a pinch or 2 of chili powder.  For the sauce I just used one can of Manwich.  
  It came out great.  I will make it again, but next time I will add some mushrooms.

I followed the basic recipe but needed to add a few ingredients to make it interesting.  After I added sauteed diced sweet bell pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and Italian seasoning, it was really tasty.   Great comfort food.

I'm sorry, but this was not good at all, and it was entirely due to the sauce (soup).  It would have been much, much better if we subbed a high-quality tomato sauce in place of the soup. The soup just made it inedible, and I'm a pretty easy-to-please person. This is my only one-star rating on this site thus far.

I really enjoyed this! it was rather bland when i first tasted it,so i tweaked my seasonings added some chili powder and garlic powder, salt and pepper until i got the taste just right, very tasty, quick comfort meal!! I agree with another reviewer who said that this is not meant to be a gourmet meal, so for those who are complaining, you need to appreciate this for what it is, a basic meal, with simple flavours that is easily adjustable.

This is an old family favorite of mine only we use tomato sauce instead of soup.  Leftovers are great cold too.

I read the previous reviews and tweaked the recipe a bit, and it turned out fabulous!  I added green pepper to the beef and onion.  I also added roasted garlic and cumin.  I added 1 1/2 cans of tomato soup and 1 can of tomato paste.  I did use the whole box of elbows, but did not find it too dry.  I covered it with slices of american cheese and shredded parmesean and baked at 350 for 30 minutes.  I'll definitely be making this again.  It was easy and delicious.

Wow! I can't believe I came across this recipe- I was searching for the standard Chinese-American chop suey! I've never heard this called American Chop Suey before- we've always called it Goulash in our house. My mom has always made this & now I make it for my family. The only thing we do differently would be to sprinkle the top with parmesan cheese (grated or shredded- what ever you have, they are both good) & bake it at 350° for about 30 minutes before serving. I've never had it unbaked so I'm assuming it helps the flavors meld more and it also gives it a bit of a nice crunchy top. It's also good with venison/deer burger.

Okay, this just wasn't very good. It was dry and bland. I even added extra seasonings and fresh garlic but unfortunatly it smelled better than it tasted.  I think it might be better if I added more tomato soup or sauce or something.

I liked this a lot...it was simple and tasty.  However, I had to add another can of tomato soup as there wasn't nearly enough with just 2 cans.

I agree that this is a perfect recipe to build on.  We now use egg noodles instead of macaroni and add a couple cups frozen corn and a package of onion soup mix as well as sprinkling cheese on top to melt.

This is a very easy recipe and I had good results with it. My husband is not a fan of sauce so I only used 1 can of tomato soup and added a little bit of water. I also added some spices (1-Step Beef Spice) and we both enjoy it. Very good recipe!

My whole family liked this. I used 1/2 the macaroni and replaced 1 can of soup with 1 can of tomato sauce.  I used green onion and added sliced fresh mushrooms. I sprinkled with shredded cheddar cheese. I spiced up the leftovers with Mrs Dash's, Onion & Herb variety and will use that in the future.

My 4 yr old was reluctant at first, but ate up and asked for more. My 18 month guy ate enough for a grown man. My husband took 2nds.

my mom use to make a variation of this.  I took other people's advice and did not add the entire box which was a good idea.  I also skipped the soup and added 1 can Tomato sauce and 1 can of stewed tomoatos.  it came out really good.  Will make again.

This recipe is wonderful!! A few things I did to give it more flavor was that I added a yellow bell pepper to the ground beef and onion, two chopped tomatoes, garlic, as well as some garlic salt, onion powder and bouillon for added flavor.  I also used tomato sauce instead of tomato soup and about 1/3 of a cup of water.  With these additions it really made a fantastic meal!!

This was really good. Not only was it easy my husband made it! He did however, use a can on manwich bold and spicy, that he opened up by accident, in place of one of the cans of soup. He also grated some mild sharp chedder cheese into the pot and mixed it up! It was great! I LOVE quick easy, not from a box suppers! My husband said he was going to add mushrooms and corn next time, because he thinks everything should have mushrooms and well a veggie would be nice! I have emailed this to all of my working mom's in my address book! Thanks!

This was the absolute worst dish I have ever tasted. I had this as a kid,(I hated it then too, it was known as golash. It is nothing but macaroni and beef in a tomato sauce. Totally bland.

Being a part Italian family, I played around with this recipe a bit. My husband is Italian, and my son is half, so they had to have lots of Garlic and Basil added to it before it was "justright", But I scooped it out for me before too many changes were made. It reminded me of the spaghetti my grandma made for me as a child...Definetly gets a star for sentimental value!LOL I my wholefamily thought it was really good for being so simple!

This is mid-20th century comfort food at its best. It's not meant to be 21st century foodie fare so don't turn it into something it's not. Make it as written - that's what it's supposed to be. If you want to use marinara sauce and herbs instead of the soup, there are other recipes out there. I love this stuff.

Comfort food for our family. Additional ingredients for us was instead of 2 cans of tomato soup, 1 can tomato soup and equal parts ketchup. I know sounds awful!! Now we add green pepper and mushrooms. Still love it!

I grew up eating American Chop Suey!! My Mother used to make it for us, and I now make it for my children and they Love it!  The recipe my mother used was almost identical to this recipe, with a few additions. She adds a Beef Bouillon Cube, a Tbsp of Worcestershire Sauce, and tops it off with Parmesan Cheese.  It is so good, and so simple to make.  It is an old standby in my household now, just as it was in my household growing up.

I made this the other night but made two changes. The first change I substituted ground sausage for the ground beef.  The second change - I used my favorite jarred sauce.  We really enjoyed the taste of the sausage.

Oops. Small tweaks that add flavor. 2lbs ground beef, 3 cans condensed tomato soup, salt, pepper, garlic powder.  Brown the meat with the onions and seasonings (to taste).  The third can of soup keeps it from getting dry.  Once it is mixed turn the burn to low add more seasoning to taste and stir.  Ready after about 15 minutes.

A great comfort food.  I had this growing up,  except we used hot dogs rather than ground beef.  We sliced the hot dogs and fried them in a little oil with the onions.   Kids love this.  Bland?  Not to kids!

I started out with this recipe but it ended up being very different.  I only had one can of tomato soup so I took a large can of tomato sauce and whisked a package of chili seasoning mix into the sauce before pouring it into the mixture.  I also added a can of black beans and diced tomatoes and used tri-color pasta instead of plain macaroni.  It was a hit!

It was good, I used Johnsonville sausage and that gave it a ton of flavor, although with hamburger this may have been bland. I added fresh grated parmesan!

I grew up on this recipe and knew it as goulash, and it is a well loved dish in my home today.  I give this recipe 4 stars as written (it lacks green peppers-->flavor).  After reading reviews, I tried it with the following changes:  added green peppers, used celery because I was out of onion, Worcestershire sauce, onion powder since I was out of onion, dropped one can of soup for a can of petit diced tomatoes, and added chopped pepperoni ... And oh my!  Still the same comfort food feel as what I grew up with and have made for years, but the pepperoni bits really added a flavor that I hadn't realized it was missing!

I grew up on this dish as a kid and loved it! I use  1-2 cans of whole tomatoes cut chunky in the pot. I also just add the elbow macaroni directly into the hamburg onion tomato mixture and cook until tender. So the macaroni cooks in the tomato juice. Easy and yummy. If it gets thick, add some tomato juice or V8.

I grew up eating this recipe.  My family called it slumgullian. Over the years we have also added to it.  Changed the soup to marinara, added green peppers and garlic and mushrooms.  Great memories from this recipe.

My mom used to make this all the time way back in the '60's, and I love it as much now as I did then. I add green peppers and sliced mushrooms to my adult version, as well as a sprinkle of garlic powder. I also use 1 can of soup and one can of diced tomatoes. Quick and easy stovetop casserole. Great for potlucks!

This was pretty good. For me it was WAY too much macaroni though, so I think I would halve that next time.

This is the stuff I grew up on! My mom would cook a couple of strips of bacon before cooking the beef. Gives it a nice flavor.
When I make it I use one can of tomato soup and one can of stewed tomatoes to give it a more tomatoey flavor. A can of tomato sauce can be added if it's dry.

This is a good base recipe. We have Chop Suey  at least once or twice a month. I add 1 can tomato soup, 1 15 ounce can of stewed tomatoes with garlic basil and oregano. When combining I stir everything together and layer in a casserole dish. Noodle mixture and American sliced cheese. On top I end with cheese and bake in oven just long enough to heat through and melt the cheese. Serve with bread and butter! Loved by all and usually none left over. Hope this helps!

I stumbled across this recipe one day and had a nice chuckle.  My brother and I grew up eating this, it was published in a ladies magazine back in the 60s.(oops, did I just date myself, oh well) I've been making this for many years as it is a great comfort food.  I use half the amount of macaroni and sub 1 can of soup with 1 can of tomato sauce to dilute that tomato soupy taste.  Some times I add basil or Italian Seasoning, sometimes use garlic all depending on my mood that day.  Always serve it with grated Parmesan cheese tho, it's a must.  The leftovers are always better the next day.

This is very much like Hamburger Helper. As it was easy enough for my DH to make, quick, and cheap we did have to dress it up with some spices and it still wasn't much to write home about. Thanks for the recipe though.

I made this tonight for a quick dinner for my family.  I remember growing up eating American Chop Suey!  My daughter loves it when they serve it for school lunch so I thought I would make it.  It turned out great!  I did change/add ingredients according to my parent's recipe as well as the tastes of my girls.  I used three cans of Healthy Request Campbell's soup, ground turkey instead of ground beef, added 3/4 c. of water or broth, and while browning the ground turkey, I threw in 3/4 c. frozen chopped bagged onion and 3/4 c. frozen bagged chopped green pepper (much faster!)  I also put a few dashes of cayenne pepper and garlic powder to spice it up just a bit.  Came out great; my family loved it.  I will definitely make again!!  Thank you April for submitting this recipe!  Topping with alittle parmesan cheese was nice.

Awesome meal.  I would probably add a little add about a 1/2 lb. more meat the next time but still an awsome meal.  Quick and recession friendly.

I'm giving this 3 stars only because it was just too bland. I not only did it all to the ltr (except for using crush tom instead of tom soup) but I added garlic so you'd think it would at least be as flavorful as the reviewers. I'll try again sometime. It was a disappointment.

I grew up with this stuff and now we jazz it up somewhat but the basics are there.  We add pepper strips, mushrooms, fresh or canned tomatoes, garlic, etc.  As someone said, it's a great starter.  Play with it.  And be sure to add freshly grated Parmesan and broil, it makes a yummy crust.

Tasty, simple, fast, fun to mess around with - love it! My version ended up with a chili/Mex slant to it. Used rotini instead of mac. Added A1 steak sauce to the meat as it was cooking. I know - weird, but I like it. Also threw in some chili beans. Worried that the dish would still be a little bland, so I added cumin, cayenne, and chili powders to the pot *after* combining the primary ingredients. Then, topped it with jack cheese, put a cover on and let all that cheese melt into the twists and turns of the rotini. Washed it down with some Dos Equis. Great meal~

OK. First you need to chop 6 strips of bacon into 1/2" pieces and brown that with the onion.  Remove and discard the onion as it becomes brown.  Do not drain.  Brown the ground beef in the same skillet, then drain well.  Proceed as directed in the recipe but reduce the macaroni by 1/2.  i guarantee the addition of bacon will make this recipe a winner!!

I too grew up on this dish. We always called it "goulash". My mother always added canned tomatoes (omit the soup) and peas to the recipe.

Rank this one right up there with other quick and easy to prepare, yet tasty dishes. I thought this might be similar to a staple dish my mom used to make when I was a kid.  Turns out, she must have used tomato soup, because the taste is quite similar.  I can't wait to ask her.  I knew it wasn't straight tomato sauce or spaghetti sauce, but who would have thought it was tomato soup?  Awesome and so easy!

Here's an update, since I prepared this again yesterday:

First, it wasn't tomato soup my mom used when I was a kid.  I ask her about it the other day; she used tomato paste!  Interesting.

Anyway, this time I added a four ounce can of mushrooms and one can of Rotel Diced Tomatoes and Chili Peppers, Extra Hot.  WOW.  Talk about "kickin' it up a notch!"  My wife and I both loved it.  It made the dish hover in the space between "spicy hot, but not too spicy hot."  Believe it or not, restaurant quality.  Mmmm.

My picky 4-year-old likes it as well as myself and other children.  I didn't add the onion though (don't know very many kids who like them).  I also put it in a casserole dish, put cheese on the top and put it in the oven for about 15 min at 350 degrees.

First of all I will say that some people may not like this because it is somewhat bland. But when I was growing up I ate the same thing but we called it goulash. I use tomato sauce instead though. And would use lots of garlic salt. Very good recipe if you need something simple, cheap and easy.

I have made a recipe like this for many years.  The only differance is that I use either ketchup or chili sauce in mine...gives it more flavour.
a little garlic in the hamburger also helps.

My husband and I really liked this recipe with a few additions to it, as some others had suggested.
First of all I didn't use the whole 16 oz. box of elbow noodles. It would have been way too many, and soaked up all of the liquid.
I did add a chopped green pepper, 2 beef bouillon cubes, 1 can of tomatoes, and 2 cloves of chopped garlic. Next time I will add some celery.
I will be making this one again, with all of the new additions!!

This recipe is far from bland like some people have said. I added a beef bullion cube to the meat just in case.  Maybe they used regular tomato soup instead of cream of tomato, I used the latter and it was delicious.

I'm not going to rate because I have not and will not make this.  Reason being I would never put tomato soup in chop suey.  I like to saute green bell peppers and onions and adding regular spaghetti sauce to the beef and macaroni.  I also add parmesian cheese to the sauce.

This is an excellent recipe. It is very inexpensive. I can make a large pan of it for $3.00. I add a few shakes of Italian Seasoning, use 1 lb of ground beef or pork,some shredded cheese, and also add one can of diced tomatoes. It is delicious!! My 2 year old cleans his plate every time! I will definitely make again!

Chop Suey is suppose to have vegetables in it. 
Chow Mein is with noodles.  I think April is a little mixed up.  Easy recipe, though.

Yes and enjoyed it. Added fresh basil, garlic powder, a tsp or so of taco seasoning, one or 2 shakes of chili powder, 1/4 to 1/2 cup parmesan cheese, about 1 tsp white or brown sugar, S and P to taste, and 1/2 cup of water...all to deepen the flavors just a bit. I haven't made made American chop suey often because it never ended up with the flavor I wanted. It was more like marinara. The tomato soup base made all the difference in this comfort food. I simmered the sauce for about 20 minutes before adding the cooked macaroni,  then for an additional 5 minutes. Terrific easy recipe for which I thank you.  ~Judi David

April, you're right, this is a simple recipe and that's the way it was meant to be. My mother always added American cheese and browned it a bit. But, otherwise the same. Had forgotten this dish until now. Very simple, easy to make, affordable dinner. Not everyone can eat gourmet every night. We need more recipes like this. Thank you for posting!

I used to make this years ago but, added a can of cheddar cheese soup. I was surprised to see that this is still so popular when we moved to Rhode Island from Nee York. Old timey comfort food.

First time making it, I found this recipe to be a little bland, I added some garlic salt and crushed red pepper and it fixed this right up to an awesome meal with plenty of left overs or if you have lots of guests.

Used one can of tomato sauce and one can of chopped tomatoes in puree since that's what I had on hand.  It could have used a bit more liquid, but didn't add any since it tasted delicious.  Also used ground turkey instead of beef.

Loved this as a kid and still appreciate it for it's simple yet satisfying flavor.(plus it's cheap and easy to make)
Of course I changed this just a bit, used BSCB and instead of soup used leftover sauce from 2 different jars (1 'sghetti and the other pizza) but other than that everything was exactly the same.

My grandmother used to make this, and it was a favorite of mine.  The only difference is she added diced green peppers.  The secret to a flavorful dish is really good ground beef, freshly ground if possible.  That was my job, going to the market and having the butcher grind the meat.  As for the naysayers, this is a simple comfort food dish, not fancy but yummy if made properly and bonus: almost all kids will eat this.  I wouldn't do this often, but with a green veg or salad makes a quick  easy meal.

Great comfort food.  Tasted just like a recipe my mother used to make.  My husband likes spicier foods so I gave him some Chili Powder to add to his.

Just like my mom used to make it! I made it exactly as it is here because "this is it"! I wouldn't change a thing! I agree with others, by the time some  finish with everything added or taken out its longer ACS and becomes chicken cacciatore! Did I say I love this recipe? It's authentic, not fake!

I made this in my ninja slow cooker, I used 2lbs of meat, 1 diced onion, 1 diced green pepper, 1 TBSP of olive oil, cooked all together on medium on the stove top setting. I left most of the grease in, and added 4 cans of Campbell's tomato soup. I filled half of one of the cans with water and swished it around. Just to thin it a small bit. I added 1 TBSP of basil, oregano, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper to taste. A dash or two of cheyenne pepper. I moved the setting to low on slow cooker. I cooked 1lb of pasta and stirred the sauce occasionally. Added the pasta to the ninja. And serve. My family LOVED it. Normally, I leave recipes alone but I wanted to make it perfect for my family since they are asc buffs. Still a perfect base, I couldn't have done it without it. Thank you!

Really great recipe. Quick and easy to make. For an extra bit of flavor could try adding some seasonings or melting some cheese into it.

My mom got me into making it this way since I was a kid. She always thought regular tomato sauce was too acidic for her and my great Grammy made it this way also. We only used Campbell's soup because other brands just didn't taste right and it was delicious and it makes it creamier. We do add green peppers, mushrooms , celery, onions, garlic and other seasonings like onion and garlic powder, oregano, salt and pepper in with the beef mixture. Once we plate it we put a dash or 2 of celery salt to our liking and its perfect!

I really enjoyed this recipe. It's fast and I've seen some people saying it's bland, but that was easily fixable. I added a lot of Italian seasoning both to the meat while I was browning it and then after I added the tomato soup as well. Also, I made everything in the skillet except the macaroni then added the macaroni to the skillet after it was done. I'm not sure if that makes a difference, but it seemed to thicken it well.  Would definitely make it again.

Like so many others I grew up eating this as well. It's good for a clean out the pantry or low budget meal. It's filling, easy, fast, kid friendly and can be adjusted to particular taste. I am laughing reading some of the reviews from people complaining about the name or it's simple taste. I personally think it's good.

This is my Mothers recipe, yes, just the way it's written...except she also added diced celery. Another ingredient overlooked in today's cooking.  My 47 year old daughter also grew up on this and to this day it's what she requests for her birthday meal. We love it just the way it is.

This brought back memories. This is an old recipe and I had forgotten how good it tasted. Like other reviewers, next time I will use less pasta OR use a package of ground beef that is 1.5 pounds. Next time, I will save a bit of (drained) pasta water to loosen the dish up a bit.  Thanks for sharing an oldie but goodie.  7-2019 **Have now made this with ground turkey. Good, but I'll stick with the original.

This was OK.  Kinda bland.   Six year old grandson  had two big servings though and said he liked it.   I would probably make it again if cooking for kids.    It's quick, easy, and cheap.  The recipe makes a lot.  I started with the called-for 2 cans of tomato soup, but thought it looked a bit dry so added one more can.

Great & simple recipe!  Brings me back to the 70's growing up. Good as is, but I changed up a bit on the second go round.

Substituted 1 can of Rotelle chopped tomato and chiles for 1 can soup.  Added some additional spices.....chili powder, paprika, cumin & some fresh garlic!

Next time may add some bacon :-)

I would really call this a 4-.  It tasted good, and I'll definitely make it again.  I think I'll experiment with it a little, but it's definitely good just as it is.  A little more tomato soup to make it a tad juicier might be good.

Super simple - I printed it out and the wife made it with some sweet onions.  It was good and very simple - for two of us it made leftovers that were reheated a day or two later.

Good and simple - what else could you ask for.

My mother called this recipe goulash, except made with tomato sauce and corn (yum). This certainly is not chop suey, since chop suey does not contain pasta or anything tomato. The only thing I would change is the name of the recipe.

I have made a similar recipe for years and years. Great for busy nights...especially after work with kids clamouring for dinner. I go a step further by cooking the pasta with the sauce.  Add a tsp. of beef bouillon base,  or granules or 1 cube to compensate for the extra water you will use. Cook as she says but add about 1 1/2 cups water to it; bring to boil; add the elbows (or other smaller pasta); stir and bring back to boil. Reduce heat to simmer; cover and cook for about 20 min.  stirring a few more times.
If you want you can use spaghetti sauce but it isn't meant to taste Italian. I noticed that a few women compared it to goulash and it is that too. You could add some beans and BBQ sauce to it for another variation.  Fast, easy, versatile, and rib-sticking!

It is an old recipe. Momma made it when I was growing up. Just plain old American macaroni! This exact recipe was  our Wednesday/Friday night dinner. Now I have it for breakfast as I prefer to eat my main  meal before I go to work. Better for your health to eat a lighter meal in. the evening. 
Momma added cheese to it on Friday night and left out the meat. She also added whatever veggie was on the menu for that night. My favorite was and still is a can of peas.   

I use ground turkey [white meat 95% lean] only. I use turkey for all recipes calling for beef due to health. Cannot tell the difference between the two. I have even subbed catsup for the soup when I was out. Cream [  ] soup works wonders for making a difference in the taste. Always add a little bit of parmesan cheese to top it off.

Some of you need to get your uppity noses out of the air!   This is what many of us, especially older folks, grew up on.  We were grateful to have it.   Until you've lived during an era where pretty much anyone considered themselves lucky to have hamburger to make this for Sunday dinner I guess you'll never understand.   Like another poster said, calling every recipe "bland" is getting quite old.

A 'classic' New England diner fare dish.  I use a tomato pomodoro sauce (homemade or store bought) instead of the soup, and I add just a dash of  cinnamon for just a little extra kick to the taste.

Nostalgia!!  This is a recipe my mother made when I was a child -- it's even called the same.  I always thought she made it because I  loved it.  I didn't realize it was because it was so fast and inexpensive to prepare...  Mom and I added celery to the recipe, but other than that, it's the same.  My husband, a true pasta-addict, thought this was awful when I made it for him and his kids, so I haven't made it in years.  Until now.

Been making this through 3 generations in our family. It's an old standby. We have never used the soup variation, but instead, a large can of crushed tomatoes --home-canned  tomatoes being the best. 
 Additions have also included mushrooms, hot pepper flakes and tomato sauce. Also, I  reverse the above instructions and recommend transferring the hamburger mix to the drained elbow mac pot due to the volume.

This recipe needs some seasonings. I don't know where the author of this recipe is from, but where I live it's called Goulash! It was a staple in our much better than average grade school cafeteria in the 1960s and 70s!

My husband always referred to this as goulash.  Don't know the proper name but was always a fan of this just because of how simple it is.  Only thing different I do is add a chopped green pepper.  I think its delish.

I grew up eating this (I was born in 1955), only it was named "Hildy mix," baked in the oven (hamburger and macaroni prepared first) and my grandmother made it as a family recipe handed down to her. I can indeed attest to the fact that it is simple and delicious! It is also a nice basic recipe that you can change to your taste...Mexican herbs (cumin, chilli powder) or Italian (Oregano, basil and garlic).

It sounds just like Hamburger Help (tm) that you buy for a buck. The box comes with pasta and a sauce and/or seasoning mix and you supply a pound of ground beef. I remember eating this as a kid for a cheap weeknight meal 40 years ago.

This is an old dish that we used to have as kids.  Chop Suey is a misnomer though.  This is American goulash.  We used canned tomatoes instead of soup and sometimes we topped it with cheddar cheese.

In what world is this considered chop suey?    Chop suey is supposed to be pork,, Chinese vegetables, bean sprouts, and soy sauce.   this is goulash.

This is a dish we have made for years, since I was a child. We have called it many things but not American Chop Suey, that is fun. 
Children love this dish. For a variation, we place it in a casserole, top it  with shredded cheddar or sliced processed cheese then warm it in the oven to melt the cheese and serve.

I make frequently using a couple more veggies--celery, garlic, a red pepper and a can of tomatoes.  The trick to having kids love it is to add a glug of molasses.

I didn't have macaroni, so I used large egg noodles.  I didn't have regular tomato soup either. So I used Tomato Bisque soup. Overall I thought it was pretty good. My husband took seconds, so that speaks volumes! Ha ha and he is hard to please!

This is a great recipe. I've made it for years, but I don't think it is chop suey.  At my house we always called it "goulash".  Chop Suey usually contains bean sprouts.

I've been making this for years with variations  I start with 1/4 lb chopped bacon sautée chopped green pepper (1) and chopped onion (1) and minced garlic in the bacon fat.  Brown the Hamburg in mixture instead of soup, 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes and 1/2 of 6 oz can of tomato paste and oregano.  Mix with 1/2 lb cooked elbow macaroni let sit for 20 mins

Great as is but also sometime try keeping recipe as is but substitute 2 cans of stewed tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce. My mother in law taught me this recipe many years ago/she called it goulash.

This is exactly how my mother makes this as did my grandmother before her. We call it goulash here in Nova Scotia and now that I make it, I tend to jazz it up with spices. 
Comfort food at its finest!

I grew up on this too. Mom used Campbell's in many recipes. I tweak it a little and use Tomato Bisque instead of Tomato - creamier and has bits of tomato. My kids loved it too.

My grandmother Trudy in New Hampshire made this at least once a week.  She never used tomatoe soup.  She used ground beef, onions, garlic powder, a can of stewed tomoatoes, ketchup and elbow noodles. BOOM dinner.  It's meant to be a quick, easy, filling meal using staples one usually already has on hand in the pantry and freezer for  pennies per serving.  I make it at least twice a month, although I use fresh garlic instead of powder.  It's not meant to be spaghetti like or a spaghetti knock-off.  It's not Beefaroni or Italian in any way.  This isn't a "gourmet" dish by any stretch and it shouldn't be.   Its meant to be fast, easy, filling and cheap.  PERIOD.

I use tomato sauce or marinara sauce for more flavor. 
Also,  start by sauteing bacon first and then cooking onion in the bacon fat.  Remove from pan and brown and season chopped beef.  Combine all ingredients and you have a very tasty dish!

My mother made this for many years.  It's supposed to have an oriental theme. She used I lb of hamburger, 2 cans of Franco-American spaghetti (now owned by Campbells, I think), onions, some chopped green pepper, and  I can of Bean Sprouts (rinsed) just before serving over crispy chow mein noodles.  Season with Soy sauce.
It is our "comfort food".

This is a recipe t hat makes the memories of your mom and grandma come flooding back. To the tastes of today, I can see why some of the snide remarks, however this is what many of us were raised on in less prosperous times.
My  mother did put diced bell pepper in, but otherwise the recipe is exactly the same. The great thing about it is that is a good base for the more adventurous to play with. Enjoy the simplicity.

And my family called it Goulash and made it with canned tomatoes and often other ingredients.  The first time I made chili for my husband he asked where the macaroni was to which I said that isn't chili it is goulash.  Never could get him to agree with me....lol.

I've been making something very similar to this. I also sautee a chopped bell pepper along with the onion and use 2 cans of tomato soup to the whole thing and at the very end I add shredded cheddar cheese. Serve with a salad and can sprinkle some grated parm over the chop suey.

My dad made this for us kids.. A LOT :) so very long ago, couple of things we do different. about a pound and a third of ground beef, another half onion, bit of garlic, we use tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes with the liquid or even a pasta sauce versus tomato soup. But my fathers addition, and I know this will sound odd... a can of brown sugar baked beans.. for us, it's childhood memories and a delicious dish :) Dad called it Beef and Bean a 'roni.
It's inexpensive, goes a long way, filling and not unhealthy
this is a great recipe

I can't imagine I would care for the recipe as written as tomato soup is pretty boring to me (not penalizing the submitter with a low rating, since I obviously didn't follow the recipe.) But this was nearly identical to one of my favorite comfort meals growing up (we called it goulash), but my mom made it different.  As an adult, when she told me the ingredients, I was shocked (primarily because I was never a ketchup fan, and as an adult went to a Hungarian restaurant, ordering goulash and realized it's NOTHING like goulash, haha!!!).  Mom used ketchup as the base (I know, sounded gross to me too) but once cooked it added a slight sweetness to it.  She also added sharp cheddar throughout and sprinkled on top, and added some fresh garlic to the onions after caramelizing.  The sweetness of the grilled onions and the sweet/tangy from the ketchup are a great match (and you would never know it was ketchup). I feel odd making it as an adult, but when I want a little comfort and an easy/cheap meal, it's my go-to.

My mom made this all while we were growing up (I am 63), I made it for my kids, now it is still one of the go-to meals for when we know we may be rushed ...make ahead and microwave when there is time to eat.  We have always added sliced or chunked  green bell peppers...and even kids who won't eat them complain when they are left off. We also occasionally  remember to add a pinch of oregano or basil to perk it up.

I would put in a couple cans of Chinese veggies, some (can't think of the name now). They are like a crisp potatoes, they come come whole or sliced.  A little soy sauce, then I think you can call this American chop sues.

Survived on this as a kid in a large family.  Mom always used stewed tomatoes and tomato sauce canned from the garden.  Just undercook the pasta a little bit and mix all...the juice from the tomatoes will thicken and cook everything.  Much healthier than tomato soup.

I made this dish with some substitutions and additions: I used stewed tomatoes( large can), and I added cheese ( 1/2-3/4 lb of American, though cheddar mix would work).  Oh my golly, the kids loved it.

I wanted to give this recipe just a bit more so I added some diced bell pepper and American cheese. The base recipe was just fine but this is a perfect recipe to experiment with and add your own touches. Very easy. I've  also cooked this outdoors in a camp Dutch oven over campfire coals. Came out great.

It is such a simple "feel good" meal.  The only difference in this recipe for our junk is that we use one can tomato soup and one can vegetarian vegetable soup (gotta get those veggies in - lol).

This was suprisingly super good.   Rated it a 4 because we did have  to season the meat mixture quite a bit by adding 2 tsp garlic powder, 2 tsps chili powder, 1 tsp salt and 3/4 tsp ground pepper. My youngest was able to help prep and cook this one nearly all by himself. Will make again for an easy dinner.

This is good.  REALLY good with a few adjustments. I added a chopped green pepper to the onion and meat. Sprinkled shredded cheese over the top at the end ... mozz or parm.  I love it with lots of parm :)  Also, I used 3 cans of soup instead of 2 :)

First time i made this I followed the directions exactly.  It was a big hit, and disappeared in record time, even though I had doubled the recipe (lots of big, hungry boys in my house).  It was simple, in the best ways:  simple to make, clean, simple flavors that were fine by themselves, but left room for changes.

Since then, I make it once or twice a month, and make little changes each time.  The most recent version, I added a chopped up bell pepper, substituted out the tomato soup  for a can of crushed tomatoes and a can of diced tomatoes.  I also stirred in Velveeta, onion powder, garlic, black pepper and topped the whole thing with a bread crumb/Parmesan mixture before popping it in the oven.  

Next time, I think I'm going to try half ground beef, half bulk sausage.

I really liked the base of this recipe. 

What I did with it was add a can of diced tomatoes. Put in more meat and more noodles.

Seasonings I used Taco Seasoning with a little seasoned salt. 

Was a hit here, and gave enough for leftovers.

Changes I made were one can of tomato soup, one jar of spaghetti sauce.  Browned ground chuck with a little onion and garlic. Cheddar cheese on top and the family really liked it.  An easy to fix week day dinner that reheats well for  lunch.

Very good. Followed the recipe almost exactly. Instead of standard condensed tomato soup I used 1 can of Progresso Tomato Basil and 1 can of Progresso Hearty Tomato, because that's all I had on hand. It was so simple and a huge hit.

I thought this was a simple, but good recipe. I added crushed tomatoes (about 1/2 of a tomato) and sautéed it along with the meat and onions. For seasonings I put: Italian seasonings, beef bullion cube, garlic powder, salt and pepper to taste. I used only 2 cans of tomato soup, and added about 1/4 cup of water. I also didn't make the entire bag of macaroni. The consistency of the meat, noodles and sauce was spot on!

If you grew up in the 80s and 90s and had goulash for lunch at school, then this recipe will take you back to those days. While I certainly appreciated the nostalgia of this dish, my family did not. Even with some cheese sprinkled on top, this dish could not, and will not, win them over. For the kids, it was too bland, not enough flavor. For my husband, who did not grow up in the US, it was palatable, but he didn't go back for seconds.
I did not use the full box of elbow mac and it still seemed a bit on the "dry" side. If you make this, err on the side of less pasta. I made this as written and I agree that it's a good "base" to start from, but that's about it.

This is a family favorite! My mother's recipe is a little different though. Ground beef browned with diced onion drained add 3 cans of tomato soup, three cans of water, and a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce let simmer while you boil the elbow macaroni, drain and layer sauce noodles and sliced velveeta cheese and shredded swiss ( or any cheese you like). cover and bake on 350 for 30 - 45 mins..... FANTASTIC!!

This was great I added a few things. I sauté a diced onion in a little EVOO and add a diced red bell and Green pepper to that a TBL of sugar and caramelize. I then brown ground beef and add a TBL of sugar to that and add together with two cans of diced tomatos cook over med heat for 10 minutes then add it to sauce pan with elbows and add a small jar of marinara sauce heat on low for 15 minute for flavors to sink in. The family loves it.

Very quick and easy.  I used about 1 1/2 cups of macaroni for mine.  My boys loved it.  I would definately make it again.  I usually make goulash with diced tomatoes, and my youngest always makes me pick them out, but this he didn't complain about one bit.  So I will use this recipe now instead of making it with canned tomatoes.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

I've made it a few times, it's a big hit with my family. I do a few things different, I add in a 14.5 ounce of diced tomatoes along with the tomato soup. As well as when I'm cooking the meat and onions together I add a few teaspoons of garlic.

I changed the recipe a little. I added diced red pepper (about 1/2 a pepper), diced onion (1/2 small onion), tablespoon or so of minced garlic. marinara sauce instead of soup, and about 1/2 cup of beef bouillon. 
I sauteed the onion, red pepper and garlic in butter. My family loved it.

Great easy dish.  Family said it reminded them of lunch food but overall it was a good meal.  I seasoned myself.  The minced garlic, cayenne pepper,  1 can tomato soup, small marinara, worcestershire sauce were key!

Simple and good dish.  Very filling!  I like that there are just a few everyday ingredients and that it is quick and easy.  Sometimes simple is better.

This is how my mother has always made American Chop Suey.  I make it several different ways, but it is really good with the tomato soup.

A friend gave me this recipe nearly  30 years ago - but she called it 'Goulash' !  It's pretty plain without added seasonings - make it Mexican one night with chili powder, oregano and cumin, maybe, or use Italian herbs.  But young children like it plain, whatever you call it!  So does my husband, served with plain white bread. I still make it for him, but vary the seasonings as inspiration strikes. Very basic acaptable recipe.

Being new to this site, I'm glad I discovered the reviews! Like some others I used marinara sauce instead of the tomato soup. My twin toddlers loved this and anything that makes them happy makes dear old dad even happier.

I read quite a few reviews, and when I made this tonight I used ground venison, added two cloves of garlic, the pepperoni, and used a can of Pastene Kitchen Ready tomatoes.  I also added fresh basil, parsley and some dry oregano.  

After that, I put everything together and put it in the oven at 350 degree for 30 minutes.  I learned that if using Kitchen Ready tomatoes, you must increase your salt to your recipe.  But other than that, this meal will just get better with time

I make this dish often, but to spice it up a bit, I add chopped green bell pepper in with the onions while I brown the meat. I also add a can of drained black olives. I pour half the mixture in the casserole dish, layer with provolone cheese and add the second half to cover. I top it with American Cheese slices the last few minutes of baking.

Great comfort food.  I double the onion, add a few sprinkles cumin, combine all ingredients, add 1 cup sharp cheddar, bake at 350 for 30 minutes in a casserole dish covered in foil. Remove foil and sprinke the top with shredded cheddar and put back in the oven until cheese melts.

I'm rating this 5 stars with the modifications I made.  I only used 8 oz. (uncooked) of macaroni, used 1 can of tomato soup and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, added 2 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and 1 teaspoon of garlic powder, and covered the mixture with slices of American cheese, which melted from the heat.  Yum!

We had this tonight for supper, so as a family we took a vote and rated it. My kids didn't care for the sweet taste, but thought it was ok. My husband likes my sauce better in it. (they are spoiled with everything that I make is homemade) It was worth a shot and thanks for sharing a family recipe! It was quick, easy, and filled everyones bellies but did not care for the sweet after taste.

This is a great recipe to build off of, according to your tastes.  I only used half of the macaroni called for, and that was plenty for us.  I also used tomato sauce (didn't have tomato soup), added a can of chopped up stewed tomatoes, and a chopped green pepper.  It was a big hit for us.  Good dish to make on nights when you don't know when everyone will be home, because it can just sit in a covered pot over a very low heat without ruining it.  And, leftovers the next day taste even better!

haven't heard of "american chop suey" in years.  my mom used to make a super easy version.  she used canned franco american spaghetti in tomato sauce instead of the uncooked pasta and soup.  as kids, we all adored it.

I was looking for a quick and easy recipe and this was the first one on the list.  Funny thing is that my family has been making this same exact recipe as long as I can remember.  The only difference is we finish it off with something called Nature's Seasoning.  I can be found in the spice isle at the grocery store.  It is my daughter's absolute favorite and anyone I have made it for loved it too.

This recipe was so quick and easy, and just as stated, my 5 year old LOVED it!  Even my hubby said it was tasty.  I added a bit of fresh shredded sharp cheddar cheese to the top and baked it until the cheese was bubbly.  I'll be making it again.

This was very good for the kids!  I am a home daycare provider and I think this is the first thing all year that all 9 of my kids ALL ate.  WONDERFUL!  The only change I made was that I added another can of tomato soup because it didn't seem "wet" enough to me.  Thanks for the great lunch idea!!

I thought this recipe was great.  I am very picky about tomato sauce and when this recipe called for tomato soup I was a bit leery, but I tried one of my favorite brands of tomato soup and was quite surprised.  My son also ate it and liked it.

I thought this recipe was good-not great but definately tasty enough for me to make again.  I did make a few changes like adding canned diced tomatoes and parmesan to the sauce and instead of 2 cans of tomato soup I added one and then a can of tomato sauce.  Also we put shredded mozzerella cheese on top (except the kids who wanted velveeta, they liked it but not for me!)  This is a good weekday meal, and much better than hamburger helper!

I did not care for this recipe. My bf doesnt eat stuff like this so he didnt even try it. This made way too much food for one person, very bland and very tomatoey. You have to change the recipe around to make it have more flavor. Nothing I will make again.

I come from a large family (6 kids) and I remember my Mom making this for us ~ as a matter of fact, I think this may be the first meal I learned to cook! It's yummy and a great budget stretcher. Thanks for sharing the recipe April!

I use only one can of soup instead of two. Also I add lots of shredded cheese. After mixing all the ingredients, I put this in a casserole dish and bake it for about half an hour at 350 degrees F.  Make sure there is enough onion and black pepper or it will taste too plain.  We don't eat much meat so I use only a half pound of ground beef instead of a whole pound.  I grew up on this casserole and I still like it!

I didn't have much in the cupboards, but I did have the ingredients to make this recipe.  I'm glad - it turned out just wonderful and my 4 yr old and husband loved it.  I sprinkled a little Old World Seasoning from Penzey's on mine for a little extra flavor, but it really didn't need it.  So simple and so good.  Thanks!

I added a big glove of chopped up garlic to the meat and onions like some suggested.  My son, who recently begged me to stop trying new things, ate three helpings of this.  It is actually VERY good!!  Two thumbs up to an easy to prepare, quick to complete, everyone REALLY liked it meal!
