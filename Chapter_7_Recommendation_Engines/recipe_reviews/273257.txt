Recipe creator here! If your meatballs are dry, you are likely overcooking them, or using too lean of ground chicken. As is the norm with keto, try using a fattier blend of ground chicken, which uses dark meat (85% lean), instead of using pure ground breast meat (98% lean).  As for the cheese not melting properly, I would encourage you to use a finer shred size and to only add about 1/4 cup cheese at a time, whisk to incorporate, then add more until completely added. Also, using too high heat will cause your cheese to seize up and not melt properly, so heat gently and as evenly as possible while the cheese is melting. Enjoy!

I made these with ground turkey and also with ground turkey. The meatballs made with ground were a better and much easier to work with!  Both were good though.

My family loved these! I didnâ€™t have any ground chicken, so I had to use ground turkey, but I did everything else as written. I served them with cauliflower gnocchi.

I was very pleased with this recipe.  Meatballs were great!  I needed to simmer the sauce a little more, but it was good.   I will definitely try this again and take pictures.  It was my first time making Zucchini spaghetti noodles and they were very good.

When I read this recipe, I thought it would be wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly. After making it, my first bite reminded me of a cheap chicken sausage, you know- the kind which stays with you for the rest of the day. Everyone at the meal agreed.

Really enjoyed the cheese sauce. The meatballs were ok, clever idea to play off of chicken cordon bleu. It was a changeup from beef meatballs.

This is a very tasty recipe as is, but if you are not going completely keto I would recommend adding some breadcrumbs to make the meatballs easier to deal with. The meatballs were very hard to shape because of how wet the meat mixture was. Other than that it was delicious.

This recipe had a great flavor and I will make it again, however I have 2 semi-cons.  In preparing to cook, I first cut the ham as directed.  When I started to put the chicken mixture and ham into meatballs, the idea of biting into a chunk of ham in the center did not appeal to me.  I cut the ham into 1/4" cubes or so--mixed it all together and cooked them.  I found I needed much more than 1T of olive oil and almost double the suggested 3 minutes on "each" side.  Balls do not have "sides".
My second semi-con, I prefer my sauce a little thicker.  I wondered how the sauce would thicken with no thickening ingredient.  It didn't.  I much prefer to have the sauce cling to the meatballs.  That all said, the meatballs with the small ham cubes mixed in and accompanied by the sauce made an extremely tasty entree.  I now know why there are mistakes in raters' reviews.  This setup makes it impossible to go back and
 edit my review.  Very annoying.

We really liked this dish.  I made mine with ground turkey.  I cooked the meatballs a little longer adding a small amount of the broth and covering to cook through. I will make this again.

Chicken meatballs were very dry.
