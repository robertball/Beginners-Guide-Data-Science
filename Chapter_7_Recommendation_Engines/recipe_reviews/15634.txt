Nice and simple recipe. I sprinkled my chicken breasts with cajun spice & took WHATS HIS FACE's advice and browned the chicken before stuffing them. I skipped the scalloped potatoes entirely and used remaining stuffing in it's place (I used only two chicken breasts). I used Mrs. Cubbinson's Cornbread Stuffing adding sauteed onion and celery. While the chicken was baking I reduced 1/3 c. plum jam and 1/3 c. water and glazed the chicken with it about 35 minutes into baking (I baked for 40 min.) This created a nice sweet/savory flavor. The chicken was very tender and juicy. Thanks Helen!

Timewise and tastewise.... I give it an A plus. Very easy to make and taste good. I had to season the chicken a little more but the overall idea is great!!!

Made this tonight. I sauteed a spanish onion into my stuffing mix... made the scalloped potatoes and baked it for about 40 mins. The stuffing was good and the inside of the chicken was juicy. However I will use some spices or seasoned breading on the outside next time. The outside meat just tasted like boiled chicken. =/ All in all a good meal and 1 out of 2 kids approve.

A quick and tasty meal if you're stretched for time! This isn't a low sodium meal so if you're cooking for someone with dietary restrictions check the sodium levels.

This is a good recipe that has potential for greatness. I thought the chicken was a little bland. I'll make it again but will probably tweak it to my tastes.
