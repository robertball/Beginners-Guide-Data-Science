Great basic recipe with a few modifications.  Added way more garlic, used juice from entire lemon, not just 1/4 cup, deglazed the pan with white wine, and made a basic white sauce with four, margarine, and nonfat milk instead of using sodium-laden canned cream of whatever soup.  We had fresh Swiss Chard in the garden, and used that instead of the spinach.  Served over brown rice.  Super yummy.

I didn't have any cream of celery soup. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and made my own creamy sauce, using flour, white wine, and butter. I did use a little extra lemon juice which made this so good. To balance all my flavors I added a bit of salt and a generous amount of pepper (lemon and pepper make a great combo). Served the chicken mixture over a choice of couscous or pasta noodles. My family enjoyed this!

Made this for dinner tonight.  It was so tasty and fast to make.  Reviewing with no changes to the recipe except salt and pepper on the chicken before cooking it.  I have leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  
I served it over egg noodles and asparagus.

As I was making it, I realized it called for chicken stock but all I had was chicken broth so I used that. I also salted and peppered the breasts before cooking and I had closer to 2 lbs of chicken but there was still plenty of sauce. 

It was just OK. My husband said it was filling. Hardly a stellar recommendation. Doubt I make this again.

This is very good. Next time I will try exactly as written. I took advice from some of the comments and used the whole lemon which made it way too lemony. I also added pepper, garlic salt and used more garlic. I recommend seasoning more than the recipe. Otherwise very good recipe!

Easy, tasty, and healthy.  I suggest serving with egg noodles - it seemed more like a topping than a casserole itself.

I didn't have a lemon, so I used lemon pepper and 1/4 cup of lemon juice instead.  My spinach was too old to use, so I sauteed some zucchini and served it with angel hair pasta.  Delicious!

I made this last night.  DELISH! Quick, easy and inexpensive.  A Definite keeper.  My husband enjoyed it as well.  His only comment was that there was too much lemon juice in the sauce.  I'll  tone it down next time that I make it.  A keeper!

100% delicious! I happened to have some lemon-basil olive oil so I used that, otherwise made as per directions.  Served over egg noodles as suggested by prior reviewer.  Fresh, flavorful and yummy!!

This was surprisingly good for such a simple recipe. First time I made it, I served over noodles. Now I just leave the noodles out and use a little more spinach.

I enjoyed this dish.  I had to use what I had in the kitchen.  I used chicken broth instead of stock.  I used 1/2 can of cream of celery, and decided to throw some white wine in the sauce (worried the broth would make the sauce too salty.  Will definitely fix again.

Delicious! Made it exactly how the recipe says, and was still extremely good! Would be making again! I’d add more garlic and a tad more lemon.

Very good! I don't normally like lemon chicken, but I enjoyed this. I only made very slight adjustments - I used way, way more garlic (4 cloves to 2 chicken breasts), I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper before browning, I deglazed the skillet with a dry sherry, and I used veg broth instead of chicken stock. As others suggested, I served with wide egg noodles. I will definitely make again. I think the spinach sauce would be good with seafood too.

Simple. Fast. Easy. Inexpensive. This recipe is pretty great. The fact that you can throw it together so quickly with minimal ingredients is awesome. The only thing I do different is that I always use a big family pack of chicken as the thick gravy is enough anyway, and to use fat free cream if chicken soup not celery. The flavor is amazing yet simple. I have made this also with broccoli instead of spinach, mushrooms and cream of mushroom, and once with asparagus. Great each time I have made it. Next time I am trying with scallops or shrimp.

Really good. Minor alterations. Added a fourth of an onion and used thighs cuz that is what I had on hand. Sauteed the garlic and onion then deglaze with the stock.

This was really good. The only change I will make next time would be to use 1/2 the lemon zest, it was a tad bit too lemony. Also make sure to season chicken before cooking (I used garlic salt and old bay). Oh, and twice the garlic for sure!

My husband loves it. I used chicken tenderloins instead of breasts. I've made it twice and that's because my husband asked me to make it again this week.

very good!  Instead of soup I used jar Alfredo sauce for less carbs and added more lemon so it was a lemony flavored Alfredo. Very good!

Even though I seasoned the chicken and added mushrooms,  it was bland and the chicken tough. Perhaps more lemon ?  My dogs loved it!

Really liked it, especially how little time it took to prepare this; they don't sell cream of celery soup in my area so I went with cream of corn, the extra sweetness was balanced by adding a little more lemon and it was fantastic! I served with rice and the leftovers were brought to work by my sister and I, still tasted great a day after!

beautiful, light and refreshing. I added just a little more lemon zest and juice for personal preference, and we loved it! Will be making again.

I try to follow recipes very closely when I rate, but I am also trying to make things as much from scratch as possible, so I also made a white sauce instead of the soup. I would probably add some celery salt next time for a little extra flavor, but can't fault the recipe for that. I'm not a huge fan of lemon chicken in general, but really enjoyed this recipe. Also trying to include more spinach and other vegs in my food, so this is great. I always add more garlic that recipes call for too - can't help myself :)

This was really good! I did add salt and pepper to the chicken and extra garlic. I'm making this one again!

I used a tsp. of minced garlic and 2 tps.  of lemon zest.  Also sauteed some fresh mushrooms and added to the finished dish, which brought an additional texture to the plate.  Also deglazed the pan with white wine, once the chicken was browned...which I cut the breast meat in half...much more tender.   Added additional stock after adding chicken back.  Served over rice.

Easy, quick and tasty. Served over egg noodles. Accidentally made once with cream of asparagus soup, still very good. Recommend adding some salt and lemon pepper to chicken before cooking for a little extra flavor.

This was really good. I cubed the chicken before sautéing it and just added the other ingredients (with the exception of the spinach) to the pan as soon as the chicken was done. I put the fresh baby spinach in a serving bowl, topped it with about 8 oz. prepared penne pasta and spooned the chicken and sauce over. I sprinkled the top with grated Parmesan and chopped fresh parsley. Excellent.

The chicken was super tender and the sauce was deliciius.  I didn't have cream of celery, so I used cream of chicken and some celery salt.  It's definitely a keeper!

I used cream of mushroom soup but only two chicken breasts so the lemon was a little overpowering. But still good!

Made exactly as listed, but I used regular broth, and I put a little S&P on the chicken before browning.  Served with rice.  Next time maybe I'll try egg noodles.  Very good!!  Very lemony but not terribly overpowering.  If you like lemon, you'll enjoy this recipe.  I should have used more spinach, really packing down the four cups into my four-cup measuring cup.

I made this for dinner the other night, and it was almost like a light, summery version of beef stroganoff. Loved it!
