I really liked this recipe. It reminds me of the soup they serve at the Dixie Stampede in Branson MO. I added extra veggies especially extra asparagus. My 5 kids thought the recipe okay it varied from "amazing" (my 14 yr old boy) to "mediocre" (my 7 yr old girl). It kept well in the fridge and I thought it heated up just as good. I only had cream of chicken soup and used butter instead of margarine. I would definitely make this one again. Adding shredded sharp cheddar cheese on top of the bowls is a real flavor booster. Serve this with warm bread!!!

Was not impressed it sounded good on paper but didn't turn out that way. Not worth making.

Just returned from Ireland and was looking for a creamy vegetable soup like the many I ate there. This one was perfect in every way. I only used 2 cups of cream instead of 3 but otherwise followed the recipe. It is delicious and I think it is lovely to look at as well.

This soup is EXTREMELY salty tasting and there is no extra salt in the recipe. The taste is exceptionally terrible.

I really like this soup it's not visually appealing just in case you're taking it to a potluck.

I've really enjoyed this recipe. Although I don't care for the puree version. I personally choose to use frozen asparagus and carrots finely chopped as well as canned potatoes (saves time). I sautee my onion in a little butter and add to the mix as stated. I do not puree due to the disturbing appearance even though it tastes fine. I also used half / half instead of cream and added potato flakes to thicken. Great recipe always enjoyed it at The Dixie Stampede in Branson MO.

I didn't follow this recipe exactly since I was trying to use up a bunch of things I had on hand but I made something similar and I would say this is a good base that would work with lots of variations. The creamy texture along with the veggie flavor works well. For the record I made my recipe with the following that I had leftover: instead of a can of asparagus: about 7 stalks of cooked asparagus (from Roasted Asparagus with Balsamic Vinegar from this site); instead of plain chopped carrots: some cooked baby carrots with a brown sugar butter sauce; instead of chicken and rice soup: about 1/2 cup of leftover parmesan rice a roni and a can of Marie Callendar's chicken pot pie soup; instead of chopped potatoes: half a 1 1/2 quart casserole dish of a potato casserole made with potatoes alfredo sauce broccoli onion garlic powder and monterey jack cheese. I also chopped up some extra onion and broccoli. I threw all this into a pot with the spices and chicken broth as recommended and boiled for 10 minutes or so (since the veggies were already cooked). Then I pureed it and poured it back in the pan and added some half and half (I didn't measure it - I just looked for the right consistency - probably about 1-2 cups) and more pepper. I can't believe this puree of leftovers was actually so creamy and tasty! Thanks Micheal.

This is fantastic! It has been awhile since I had the Cream of Vegetable Soup at Dixie Stampede so I can't comment on how close it is to their soup. Nevertheless my family and I enjoyed this.

I made this recipe years ago after we had been to Dixie Stampede and everyone (especially me) enjoyed it. Thanks for the reminder. I will make this weekend!

I made it exactly like the recipe says. It was ok but if I make it again I will add something to it to give it more flavor. I do have to say that my daughter who hates vegetables ate a full bowl. She said it was ok but for her to eat vegetables that is saying something.

This was so delicious! My whole family loved it. The only modification I made was adding some salt (we are salt lovers in my family). I added 1/4 teaspoon which was perfect for us but may be too much salt for some.
