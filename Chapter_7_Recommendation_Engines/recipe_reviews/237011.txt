Try this and loved it, but totally changed it according to what ingredients we had. We used corn tortillas, a fourth of an onion, a fourth of a green pepper, a full cup of enchilada sauce, no corn, and no cilantro. Yeah! Big changes, but other than that we followed the directions perfectly. The only changes we would make now would be to add a little more salt and chalula sauce. Oh ps. We fried the tortilla shells, but probably not necessary.

My family loved these enchiladas.  I cooked a bag of frozen chicken breasts in the crockpot and used half for this dish and half for another.  I also used frozen corn and green enchilada sauce instead of the red.

This is a nice recipe for enchiladas ! You can leave out the red pepper from the recipe if you want a milder taste which is what I decided to do ! I look forward to making  this again very soon ! :)

Great recipe.  I used a can of white kidney beans, as I was out of black beans.  I used a small can of Rotel diced tomatoes with green chilies as the basis for my sauce. These were great. I must have used larger onion and more corn, because I had enough enchiladas  to fill a 9x13 pan. Family loved them and so did I!

I have used this recipe MANY times - but I substitute in slow roasted roast beef instead of chicken. Always a crowd pleaser!

I followed the directions as indicated, but instead of rolling the ingredients into the tortillas, I made the recipe as a lasagna, using the tortillas in the layering process.  I added more cheese and enchilada sauce between  layers and topped the whole thing off with enchilada sauce and a combination of sharp cheddar and mozzarella cheese.  The entire family love it !  My husband asked when I could make it again!

My family really loved it!   What I did differently was use three large cans of chunk chicken to avoid having to cook chicken breasts and used green, red, and yellow peppers.  I did not use green chilies - felt it would have enough kick to it with the peppers and sauce.  I made so much that Im having to freeze the second batch.

We add a little more sour cream to the recipe, as well as we double the enchilada sauce on top, or however much you need to cover the enchiladas.  You can also use salsa, or chili sauce (my personal favorite!) This is very delicious and filling!!

OMG... this recipe was super easy.. and since we always do the authentic Mexican enchiladas, I thought we should put a kick in it...not only did my family love them... they were a hit and tasted great!!!
I substituted the red for green chile sauce and it was fantastic!!!
Definitely gonna do this again!!!

This was great... and my kids who declared, "I don't like enchiladas!" enjoyed it. I used plain Greek yogurt in place of sour cream after discovering I was out. I also skipped the chilies to make it more kid friendly. My husband and I added hotter sauce after the fact.  Will definitely make this again.

This was our Cinco de Mayo dinner. Only difference from the original recipe: we used about twice as much enchilada sauce as the recipe called for. Otherwise it would have been too dry.
