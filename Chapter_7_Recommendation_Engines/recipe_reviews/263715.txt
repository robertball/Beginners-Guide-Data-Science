Now, isn’t this a smart recipe! No more stirring every five minutes. No more splatters to clean up. I used a traditional pressure cooker and after 15 minutes it was thick enough for pasta. I used the exact ingredients and didn’t think they needed to be changed at all. The flavor is simple yet wonderful. Thank you for the recipe.

This was so quick and easy to make! It's incredibly delicious and one of my new favourites - will be making this often :)

I made the following substitutions to work with what I had on hand:
- white white vinegar instead of wine
- diced tomatoes instead of crushed
- strained tomatoes instead of canned San Marzano tomatoes
