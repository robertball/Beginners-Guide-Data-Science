My family loved this chili. I did make a couple of changes. I used beef broth instead of water, and added an additional 1/2 tsp of cumin. The pinto beans I used were fresh (not from a can)which I think made a huge difference. I also added a diced green bell pepper. Topped with cheddar cheese and served with cornbread. Will definitely use this one again :)

I am the original poster of this recipe.  This is an update.  I don't use tomato sauce or white sugar any more.  Also, I took a previous reviewer's suggestion and now use a bit more meat and just a cup and a half of water.

This was really simple to make, and tastes really good. If you own a juicer I suggest subbing carrot juice (or whatever juice you want) for the water (I used 1.5 cups of carrot juice). I didn't use any sugar and it tasted fine to me. I also added a red bell pepper, which I thought was a really nice addition.

I have made this chili for a number of people, and have gotten rave reviews every time! It's delicious, and very easy -- a weekly staple in my house! A few suggestions - use a bit more meat (3 lbs) to make it a more substantial meal. I also only add about 3/4 to 1 cup of water rather than the 2.5 called for.

This is my favorite chili recipe I've found on this site! I always add other ingredients as I love to experiment and can eat chili all year 'round. But it's our favorite in the winter. I use cinnamon as opposed to white sugar to sweeten it and fresh tomatoes instead of canned. I also add jalapeno and habanero peppers to taste. The addition of real bacon can also be a kicker! Excellent recipe. Thank-you

I've been using this chili recipe for a couple years now, it's good, but I modify it quite a bit. I call it Kevin's Kick-Butt Chili -- has a better taste and ring to it.

Adjustments: 

- Add 1/2 pound more ground beef (I use 96% lean)
- MUST USE Brooks Hot and Spicy beans - amazing. 
- 1 bottle of Negra Modelo beer.
- Use all seasonings and spices listed, but heap them or adjust to your liking. 
- Cook for at least 3 hours. 

There will be a lot more liquid because of the beer and Brooks beans, so plan on adding at least two more hours of cook time -- TOTAL of 3 hours -- but you could go longer on low heat. Wipe off excess moisture on the saucepan cover when stirring to speed up the process.  

I promise it won't disappoint.

I tried this recipe and it was good but only after I added several things. It was originally way too spicy to enjoy.
