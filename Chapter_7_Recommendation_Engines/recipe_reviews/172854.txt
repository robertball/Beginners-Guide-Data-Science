I grow my own spaghetti squash and cannot say enough about this wonderful veggie! FYI...to speed up the process with no change to the taste or texture, use the MICROWAVE!!! a nice medium (typical) sized squash takes about 10 mins on high in a shallow baking dish with a small amount of water and salt to create steam. follow same steps as in this recipe just use your microwave. Also, be adventurous, this squash is fabulous with butter and dried italian herbs, or drizzled with rosemary infused olive oil (a cinch to make) if it sounds good on pasta it will be great with this squash!

This was delicious. I added quartered campari tomatoes to the sautee.  Threw the squash in a buttered casserole dish, mixed in the sautee and topped with an italian cheese blend. Baked until cheese was bubbly.  Awesome!

This is very good. Although this was my very first time preparing and eating spaghetti squash. It's easy to prepare and doesn't require a lot of ingredients. Next time I will add more seasoning, maybe parsley or other herbs, and roast the squash 10-15 mins longer so it's not as crunchy and more tender, I will use this again, thanks (:

I've never prepared spaghetti squash before so this was a really good way to learn how to prepare it. Definitely do as the first reviewer instructed and poke holes in it and microwave for 10 minutes on high before baking. Even with doing that I still baked it at 350 for 45 minutes. I let it cool and followed the rest of the directions. I cut back on the garlic using only one clove and used about 1/4 cup of chopped onion. All it needed was a bit of salt, pepper, and some parsley for color. Simple and delicious!

This recipe is a very familiar way of cooking spaghetti squash for me which I appreciated as a reference for cooking time, although I shaved off a few minutes since my spaghetti squash was small. I also appreciated the idea of letting the squash cool somewhat before shredding - duh. I have always struggled with a piping hot squash as I awkwardly tried to shred it without burning the heck out of my hands!   Other than substituting shallots for the onion I prepared this as directed, using butter.  Garnished with fresh, minced parsley this was simple, pretty and delicious.

lacked flavor so I added some diced tomatoes with olive oil and basil and topped with parmeasan cheese and it was delish.

Spaghetti squash is delicious all by itself with a little salt and pepper.  Tonight I decided to really spice it up. I baked it like the recipe said, while baking I sauteed onion, a tsp. fresh garlic and mushrooms in a bit of EVOO and Smart Balance Butter. I then added the spaghetti squash, sprinkling with salt and pepper, putting on a serving platter then finishing off with fresh garden roma tomatoes....It was amazing alot of flavors popping in your mouth. My family has always loved spaghetti squash or any squash for that matter. Enjoy!

I only used this recipe as a reference to bake my squash as I have never made this particular squash before.  I left out all the other ingredients because once I tasted the spaghetti squash for the first time I realized it didn't need a thing!

Excellent! This was my first time making spaghetti squash and I was not disappointed. The only thing I'll do next time is slice the onion really thin to resemble the squash so my children don't see them.

I did not care for this. I had to apologize to my dinner guests and warn them about it before they tried it. I used more squash and less garlic and onion, and yet the squash was way over garlicy! It was unedible but we all tried a bit. My sister in law said using onion or garlic with fresh vegetables really holds the flavor and can be overpowering. I learned this the hard way!

I have never had spaghetti squash, but when I co-worker gave me one, I wasn't going to let it go to waste.  This recipe saved my squash, so to speak.  I cooked mine in the microwave (cut in half, cut side down in an inch or so of water in a glass pie plate at high power for 10 minutes.)  Other than that, I actually followed the recipe (which is unheard of usually.)  Super easy and it reheats well the next day.  The best part is that my husband refuses to eat it, so I get it all to myself!  Totally his loss. :)

I LOVE this recipe. I added some chicken Italian sausage -crumble and saute-separately- then add to the squash. Mix in a little chicken broth and parm cheese and you have a great meal instead of a side dish.

This recipe was the starting point for my adventures with sauteed spaghetti squash!  I decided to try Mediterranean-style next:  I microwaved my squash whole (poke plenty of holes first!), then cooled slightly, cut in half and used a fork to scrape strands out.  I sauteed onions, garlic and chopped green and red peppers in olive oil, then added the squash to the pan.  I then added diced tomatoes (have used canned since - work just as well), oregano and basil to taste.  Once heated through, I added sliced green and kalamata olives, then topped with crumbled (fat free) feta cheese.  I covered the skillet just until the feta softened, then served piping hot.  Delicious!  Thanks for the "blank palette"  to work with!

Oh my goodness! This is so wonderful! You can't go wrong with butter, fresh garlic, and onion! It is the perfect companion to the sweet flavor of the squash. Both my husband and I loved this recipe. He is in awe that he can actually say that he likes squash now! It is great as the base for a lovely red sauce or meat sauce as well. Fantastic in every sense of the word! Thank you!

This was surprising good!! A nice change from plain roasted squash.  I eliminated the butter (to be healthier) and used just a TBS of OO to sautee the onion/garlic.  I will definitely make again.....

This was my first experience with spagetti squash and I will definitely be having it again. I cut the squash in half and took out the seeds then placed the squash cut side up in a pie plate that had about 1/4 of a cup of water in it. I microwaved each half separately uncovered for 20 minutes. It was done just right. I then followed this recipe exactly except that I didn't add the onion because I was trying to get my grandson to eat it. Next time I will add the onion.This is a very tasty and easy recipe to follow. Be sure to microwave the squash a few hours ahead of time as it is very hot to handle for quite a while.

This was fabulous-full of flavor. I did steam mine in the microwave for  10min (each half since my micro is small) and used grapseed oil (all I had on hand) and a table spoon of butter. This was great, the kids ate all gone on their plates! They thought it was noodles too!

This is the first time I've ever had Spaghetti Squash. I prepared it as written. No changes. It's very good and a nice change from pasta or rice. I can see many other uses for Spaghetti Squash. I can't wait to try it with my Basic Tomato Sauce.

I had never made spaghetti squash and this was very good, I did cut way down on the butter an only used 2 tsp of olive oil and 1 tsp of light margarine when cooking the onions.  I chopped some fresh mushrooms as well. Used some kosher salt and fresh ground pepper.

This meal was easy to make and tasted good....real good :) I took suggestions from other viewers to add olive oil instead of butter, chopped tomatoes, portabella mushrooms, garlic & onion powders, basil, and parsley. Delicious. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

Surprisingly fantastic with my tweeks! Cook squash in mirco - split in 1/2, drizzle with EVOO, salt/pepper. Micro in dish, flesh-side down approx 6 minutes.  Sauted onion until soft in EVOO, added LOTS garlic, dash red pepper flakes, diced green & red bell peppers, slided mushrooms, sauted few minutes then added fresh, diced tomatoes (can use canned), just until tomatoes are heated thru.  Toss with squash (looks like angel hair pasta to me!).  Add chopped fresh basil and feta cheese & fresh craked pepper!  DELISH

I hoped to give this 5 stars because it sounds wonderful, but even with suggestions from others it just isn't quite there for us.....yet. 

Microwave is the way to go for sure.  Much less time and no loss of taste or texture for the squash.  I microwaved cut sides down in 1/2" salted water for 12 minutes for an average size squash and it was perfect.  After adding it to the onion/garlic saute I tasted and found a bit of blandness as others had said. So I tried the dried Italian herbs someone had mentioned.  It made for a nice aroma and added good color to the dish....but.

The squash itself tasted great and we love the texture, but the rest of the flavors just weren't right for us.  Next time I think we will use more butter, no garlic, no Italian herbs, and maybe a touch of brown sugar.  We usually don't go the sweet route but think it might be just what this needs.

I really thought this had great flavor, but the 8 year old still prefers marinara. This is my fave though. :)

Absolutely delicious! The first time I made this I followed the recipe to a T except added parmesan on top. So yummy. The second time I added sauteed mushrooms and stewed tomatoes and it is honestly so nice to find guilt-free pasta:)

I was looking forward to this based on the previous reviews but it turned out to be a clumpy mushy watery mess and extremely bland even though I followed the recipe exactly. Trying to doctor it up with seasonings did not help either. Sorry :(

Very good, I did use EVOO instead of butter.  Then, I added my favorite red sauce and turkey meatballs.  This dish was better with the squash, than with pasta.

I had never cooked spaghetti squash before. I dont think I really like it, but am still kind of undecided. I thought it had a very weird texture... maybe the seasonings just werent right for me, or maybe if there was a thick sauce it would cover up the weird texture. I dont know. Definitely something I will try to play with and maybe I can find a way to make it that I like.

I thought this recipe was very simple, quick and pretty tasty. I followed the recipe exactly except I added a dash of paprika to the sauteed onions and garlic. Once I had plated my portion I mixed a tablespoon of Prego Roasted Garlic Parmesan sauce into the "spaghetti", which proved to be a good substitute for the carb laden, real thing!

I have been making spaghetti squash like this for years, it's quick and tasty. Changes: after removing seeds, I fill the cavity with chopped tomatos and maybe a quarter or half of an onion, sliced paper thin!!! Add salt and pepper, and cook right side up in microwave for about 8 min, depending on size of squash. Scoop out with a couple forks and done!

Very good! To save time, I was planning to microwave the squash. Then I read the top reviewers' comments, and that's what she did! My squash was small to medium in size, and after poking multiple holes with a knife, I microwaved it about 13 min. Ten minutes should do it. Had to wait 25 min just to slice it because it was so hot. Carefully removed the seeds, and with a fork, got the strands from the squash. The salt and pepper are really needed for flavor; I also added some fresh parsley. I had half of it for a one-bowl meal. Will have the other half another time.

Really good! I cut back on the butter for health reasons only and added some garlic powder in addition the the fresh cloves. Next time I would have to cook for 50-60 minutes instead of 40. Simple, quick, and tasty!! Thanks for sharing.

This was very good. I have never tasted speghetti squash before. I may not go back to regular speghetti again. I like the crunch and that it's better for me than the pasta.

what a coincidence! My daughter grew spaghetti squash in her garden this past summer.... Lots of it. Which was OK by me, because it turned out that we all love it! We fixed it exactly this way, and were questioning whether or not my granddaughter would eat it. We had an almost all veggie dinner this past summer on the patio. All vegetables from her garden.... The spaghetti squash, cucumbers in a salad, sliced tomatoes, sugar snap peas that we ate raw, and and we threw some chicken and slices of zucchini brushed with olive oil on the grill to cook. We all, including the granddaughter, gobbled the spaghetti squash down! It was so good. The only thing was that we did sprinkle some grated parmesan on top, the good stuff, not sawdust. We fixed it this way several times, and it was just as good every single time. So last night, I did something a little different. I served it with a marinara sauce on it and grated parmesan, because in my mind, I was using it like spaghetti pasta. And I understand people that can't have pasta use it that way. It was very delicious as well.I did something different last night, I served it with marinara sauce and grated Parmesan. It was very good too, but we still like it this way. Thank you for this awesome recipe!

P.S.her garden turned out amazing, did very well, and at Halloween, we had 12 large pumpkins that were carved at a children's carving party for Jack O'Lanterns!

The garlic in this dish is overpowering. It also did not compliment the squash well. My husband could not eat it. I would not make this again.

This was good but I think it needs a little more flavor. I will try adding some additional spices next time. I substituted 2 T Olive Oil for the butter and it still turned out very good.

My first time ever tasting or cooking it!! Wonderful!! Why did anyone tell me this is a great vegetable starch like replacement for pasta! The man and my son both liked it!! I added red bell and red onion for texture and color. Sautéed it in butter, chopped garlic added salt and pepper for taste. Then to top it of I add shredded mozzarella and mexican cheese.  Great comfort food that you don't have to feel guilty about!! Can't wait to try it with different toppings!!

Yumm! This is amazing! I used 1/4 cup of olive oil instead of butter and it was great. I followed a review and put the squash in the oven for longer than 40 min - I did 50 min. Next time I may do an hour.
Wow wow wow thanks joycekling!!!

Prep or ready time is greater than 40 minutes, especially if this is your first time using the vegetable and/or you don't like crunchy squash.
If you like buttered noodles skip the seasonings.  Anything you Do like on pasta, try on this versatile vegetable.  This recipe is a great start.

i made this tonight and i am very fond of this recipe. i read past reviews and added basil and diced tomato's as well to add color and more flavor. very good. one spaghetti squash for 3 people is fine but if you want a big plate full i would use two squashes. i am certainly making this again and probably will add more veggies to it!

My husband made a "Oh no, what'd she make for dinner this time?" look when he saw the spaghetti squash being served with meatballs. 
Surprise! My kids (3.5 & 1.5) gobbled it down with the meatballs and labels it "delisus". We adults enjoyed it immensely too. 
I would serve this on its own only to a dietetic, health-conscious person. But it makes a great family dinner as a sub for pasta if served with good, saucy meatballs or the like.

What a great tasting dish! I cooked the squash in the microwave first and waited about 20 mins to "shred". The garlic & onion was simple and delicious :)

This was my first time making spaghetti squash and it was wonderful! Definitely different than pasta, but I agree with some of the other reviewers that it tasted awesome just by itself with EVOO and spices. Even my carnivorous BF loved it. The only changes I made was microwaving, as others suggested, instead of baking in the oven.

I made this for dinner tonight and my mom and I both loved it! I added a little extra butter and some extra garlic (just because I love garlic) and it was delicious. Next time I might add some cheese too. Thanks for the delicious, relatively easy, and healthy recipe!

I omitted the garlic due to a slight allergy in my family.  The onions with the butter tasted good but I lost the sweetness of the squash in this flavor combination.  I think next time I would add some parmesan cheese.

My family loved this! No one even realized it was squash until I told them! I followed the recipe exactly except that I microwaved the whole squash for 15 minutes (it was 3.5 lbs). We also sprinkled a little fresh parmesan cheese on top and it was so yummy! I will definitely be making this recipe again!!

I thought this was a great way to cook spaghetti squash and it tasted really good especialy with a nice sprinkle of freshly grated parmesan cheese. But it was a bit too heavy on the butter, so next time I think I would maybe substitute olive oil as some other reviewers have suggested.

We loved this!  For the most part I followed the recipe, with a few minor exceptions.  I cut the recipe in half as it was only 2 adults and 2 small children eating - I reduced the amount of butter in half and used 1/2 olive oil.  I also added a small grating of nutmeg to the end result was really brought the flavors out.  The end result was very good and I wouldn't hesitate to make it again!

LOVE Spaghetti Squash. There have been times when this IS the meal at the table! I have also baked the squash until soft and then added my hot spaghetti sauce,r ather than eating spaghetti! Add nice loaf of Italian Bread and your meal is complete!  It also makes a great side dish when you bake til soft (40 minutes)and then add brown sugar, butter ,parsley and salt & pepper to taste. Bake for another 10 minutes! Excellent

The recipe was great for people who are just beginning or simply trying something new with spaghetti squash. Everything turned out great, however, as far as the margarine... I used half the amount. I made the spaghetti squash with some stir fry and it tasted amazing.  Thanks!

This is great. My boyfriend is a health nut so he was quite pleased with this dish! I did alter the recipe a little bit. After roasting it in the oven, I sauteed the spaghetti squash in butter, garlic, and onions(just like the recipe) but I seasoned it with garlic salt and Italian seasoning. I then mixed in Parmesan cheese. I serve it in the hollowed out squash skin using it as a bowl. At the end I drizzled the squash with olive oil. It was great!!!!

This was delicious.  It was our first time eating spaghetti squash and this simple recipe did it justice.  We found we only needed half the butter to saute the dish however.  Yum!  Thanks for the recipe. :)

This was my first time making spaghetti squash, which I decided to grow in the garden this year for something different.  I followed the directions but added 2 small tomatoes (diced), a small white eggplant (diced) and about a tablespoon of marinara to the pan.  Also, I use coconut oil rather than butter, its much healthier.  My boyfriend wasn't a big fan, but I thought it was delicious and am eating the leftovers for lunch now!  When I found out how low cal this veggie is I decided it may be my new favorite food!!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was just too rich.  Spaghetti squash is rich on its own, but the butter/margarine push it over the edge.  I would not make this again.

So easy and very good. I cook my squash in the microwave - cut in half , remove the seeds, rub the squash with olive oil and add salt and pepper. Cook 5 -10  minutes depending on the size.

I just finished the entire recipe (1/2 squash), going back 3 times until it was gone.  That's how good it was!  I made it exactly per recipe except for adding fresh rosemary and topping it with shredded mozzarella.

Yummmy!!  I love spaghetti squash. This was a great side dish. My kids don't like squash but that's okay, more for me.  
I made this as the recipe says. But I could also see sprinkling a little bit of parmesan on top.

So flavorful, the family loved it!
I heated the squash in the microwave, whole with some knife holes to let steam out, for 15 minutes in 5 minute incriments. Then cut open, seeded and ran a fork through for the "spaghetti" then added to the pan and cooked another 10 or so minutes until the squash was cooked to the liked consistency.

I've made it a couple of times. I think the onion and garlic flavor is fine, but the last time I sprinkled some balsamic vinegar on it just before finishing it in the pan, which gave it a piquancy that appeals to my taste. I am going to try tarragon vinegar next time I make it.

I make twice of the week. Great side dish to go with any chicken. I added my own little twist by adding some adoba goya seasoning and Tony Chachere's creole seasoning. Just a little bit is all you need.

I made this with exception I did not have feta cheese on hand so I substituted Parmesan and a shredded Jack/Cheddar  combo cheese.  Turned out great.  Can use for a vegetable dish either main or side course.  I found that I needed to cook the squash for 50 minutes at 350°F.

This turned out great! However, I did not prepare the squash with the butter and garlic. There is another recipe on this site called Alla Checca, which is basically chopped tomatoes, garlic, and basil which is salted and steeped in olive oil in a covered bowl on the counter all day. Cook the squash as directed in the oven in this recipe. Shred it with a fork and toss with the tomato mixture. Absolutely delicious!

First time making it and I really enjoyed it! good flavor and very simple! I put it in the microwave as someone recommended. just an fy i- cut squash in half remove seeds and then put it in microwave I only put it in for 8 min. Mine exploded in the microwave (interesting mess). I didn't have to put it in the oven. It was soft and i was able to scrape out spaghetti.

I made this recipe as it was written. It was ok. I guess my family isn't a fan of spaghetti squash, as you could definitely taste the squash. I think I will need more flavours next time to mask it a bit.

This is easy and delicious.  The first time I made it, I followed directions exactly and ended up with "mush" LOL but the 2nd time it was perfect. I poke holes all over the squash and nuke for 4-5 minutes before trying to cut in half- makes it so much easier. Just keep that in mind when you bake it- you've already cooked it for 5 minutes so 40 minutes is 5 minutes too long  (plus you add it to the onions and garlic and saute it).  I have yet another squash waiting to be cooked tonight... thanks for this great side dish!

I had a small spaghetti squash and decided on this recipe (scaled down a bit due to size of the squash). I prepared it as written, tasted it & decided to add about half a can of diced tomatoes with rosemary & onion. I thought I'd eat half of it for lunch & save the other half.. it was so good, I ended up eating ALL of it!!! I now have a new favorite way of preparing spaghetti squash. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe!!!

3.24.17-No complaints here! Made recipe as written with no problems. Easy to make and very good. Didn't think it was too much garlic or onion flavor--just right for us and went well with the spaghetti squash. Served as side to chicken marsala. 10.19.17: Of course butter makes everything better, but I used a little olive oil this time to saute garlic and onion, toss in squash strands, season w/S&P. Enjoyed it this way too.

Very good.  First time I've ever made spaghetti squash, but I'll definitely make this again.  Just as it is, doubt if I'll change the recipe.  Even my other half liked it and he is REALLY hard to please.

I loved how easy this was to just put it in the crock pot and forget it.  The skin was very easy to cut when it was all cooked and easy to scoop out the seeds. I just added salt, pepper and butter and loved it. I did mine for 6 hours with a liner in my crock.

This was a good basic recipe, but I think it could use more seasoning.  Maybe add some vegetables to give it more color and flavor.   I'd make it again.

I will definitely make this again. I did change it up a bit, I added fresh sliced mushrooms about 2 minutes before adding the squash, added about a tbsp of fresh parsley along with a dash of cayenne. My hubby totally loved it and it is a challenge getting him to eat spaghetti squash.

So simple! I much prefer spaghetti squash done in this style rather than a red/marinara type sauce. I added a little garlic and some fresh herbs to this recipe, but it's fine as written.

Very simple yet tasty and with a surprising texture. I added two variants: added 1/2 cup of white wine for flavor at the end of the sautéing process (make sure it is all evaporated before serving) - I used some weeks-old leftovers of Gewurtztraminer; and I cooked the squash in a grill, over a cast iron griddle for 30 minutes keeping the temperature between 400 and 450F. It was a very successful side with grilled salmon - even picky kids went for seconds

My husband and I are exploring different foods and neither of us have ever had spaghetti squash and this recipe and cooking guide was superb! I did use the microwave to reduce cooking time as suggested in another review using a small amount of water and sprinkle of salt in a shallow cooking container, halving lengthwise and placing upside down, microwaving on high for 15 minutes. I work all day and needed to speed up the prep time, lol. After preparing as suggested, we served this like pasta under chicken Marsala. Mmmmmm soooo good! Thank you for the recipe and suggestions from other reviews!

This was ok, not great.  I added a small amount of maple syrup to it which made it a little tastier.  I would make it again, but still add the syrup or a little brown sugar.

Very easy to make and tasty. Only change to the recipe I made was to cut the squash in half and placed it face down on plate in microwave, shortened up cook time .

This was delicious! I substituted olive oil for the butter. I served it as a base for salmon baked with lemon juice and pepper, and it was perfect.

Went exactly by the recipe ( actually used a little less butter) and was blown away by how awesome it was! Used sweet vidalia onions which I think enhanced the flavor. Would not change a thing!!

This is pretty good.  I did cut the butter to 3TB  as my squash was small.  Next time I will likely cut the butter again- probably to 2 TB just to cut the calories.  It had good flavor but somewhat bland as stated.  I added basil to the squash before cooking and that added a nice touch.  Quick and easy!

This was excellent! I used only 2 tablespoons of butter and sautéed a sweet onion until browned. I love garlic, so I used the entire amount.. But didn't add that in till about 1 minute before adding the squash. This is simple yet tasty.

The recipe worked well, and was quite simple. I would suggest reducing the amount of butter and garlic, as it turned out quite a bit too strong.

This was a tasty test run. I was given a spaghetti squash by a friend, which I had not eaten since I was a teenager. My cook time was 32-35 mins on the squash. I used red onion, rather than white or yellow because that was all I had left after slow-cooking chicken thighs on the grill in olive oil seasoned with onion, rosemary, oregano, thyme, and sea salt. I also had a seasoning for the final dish that I buy from a local festival called "Garli-ghetti".

Thanks for the post below! I cooked in the microwave for 10 minutes and it's exactly the same texture as cooking for almost an hour! I will cook it this way from now on! Such a time saver!

Very good.  Easy to add to any meal.  Followed recipe as shown and the wife really liked it.  Will definitely make again.  Cooked in microwave, let cool a bit to make the scraping manageable and reheated in the pan.  Made timing very easy.

Can't go wrong with that much butter and garlic!  sometimes I overcook the squash and sometimes I undercook it.  I like sauteing it until it gets some brown spots.

Not bad for the first time trying this squash. I'm trying to get more veggies in my family's diet, so new things are needed here. It is pretty tasty, but too much garlic for me. I will put less next time.

I really liked the bones of this recipe even though I made a few changes:  I added kale to wilt it while sautéing the onion and garlic in butter.  I also added some seasoned salt instead of regular salt.  Finally I added a tablespoon of lemon juice just to kick up the flavor.  (I love Lemon so this is just my preference.) Kids loved it I will be making this again.

First time I've ever tried spaghetti squash. Rather than so long in the oven I pressure cooked it for 8 min. Perfect. Completed recipe as directed. Enjoyed my first try of this squash. A bit bland, but can see that it would go with about anything one wanted to add to it. Definitely will have it again.

Another good low-carb side. Easy to customize to suite your taste. So far have only been able to try the microwave method since the oven is usually tied up. Looking forward to try the oven method sometime to see if there is any difference in texture, etc...

I followed the recipe, but baked longer (50 minutes total) since it was too firm when I checked at 40 minutes.  I made two batches.  One with the ingredients listed here, and one with jarred alfredo sauce and leftover chicken.  This was not very good as listed.  This was my first attempt at making spaghetti squash.  I liked it with the heavier sauce much better.

Tried this for the first time tonight.  Oldest daughter was sorely against having squash for dinner, but we have a "no thank you" bite rule in the house.  After her "no thank you" bite, she realized it was not bad at all.  In fact, she liked it so much that she did eat a serving.  Will make this again.  Only change I made was to cook the squash in the microwave instead of the oven.

This was delicious!!!! I did use a LOT of butter (a full half cup just because we love buttah!)  Tons of garlic and a half-chopped onion! We did add chicken sausages (chopped up links) to it and it was the perfect one-pot meal! I did cook the squash a bit longer (55 instead of 40), but my husband likes his veggees "mushy"...Thanks!

I roasted the squash the night before, which made this a pretty quick and easy veggie for us to have with lunch today.  That said, I was the only one who would eat it, my husband took one bite and passed the rest up, and my children would barely taste it.  I liked the part with the onions the best, most bites just had plain squash and I found them to be rather bland and the texture wasn't my favorite.  I was excited to try this, but won't be making it again, I guess we are just not a spaghetti squash kind of family.

I served this as a side to the Boneless Pork Loin with Herbed Pepper Rub and it worked quite well. A refreshing change from mashed potatoes with gravy. I will try a little more seasoning next time.

Perhaps this is a regional dish and is loved by people in a different part of the country. I followed the recipe exactly and wasn't impressed.

great recipe! it makes a lot more than you would expect, but i just refrigerated the squash(not sauted) for next time. one little change for a different flavor...i used bacon fat instead of butter to saute the squash.

This is a great recipe for cooking the squash, generally. I wouldn't say it is "crunchy," but cooked for 40 minutes it does have the consistency of a slightly undercooked potato, if that makes sense. I dressed this as if it were pasta & meatballs -- I cooked some meatballs from frozen as the squash was baking in the oven, and then popped them a saucepan with in a jar of sauce and 2 diced tomatoes. It's not pasta, but it's still VERY good! :)

I give this 3.5 stars, 4 stars with some adjustments in the future.  I cooked my squash the night before and then did the rest of the steps the next evening.  I used less butter than the recipe calls for and added some dried basil and oregano.  I used quite a bit of salt as well. This was a great starter recipe for me because spaghetti squash is new to me.  I feel confident experimenting some more now!

Great Recipe.  I added some whole black olives, olive oil, Parmesan cheese, as well as some Italian seasoning and it was spectacular.  I could eat it every day without growing tired of it!

This was my first time ever making spaghetti squash. I only changed the recipe slightly. When putting squash in oven, I placd in a pan with a little bit of water in the bottom of the pan and I seasoned squash with salt and pepper before placing in oven for 45 -50 mins. Let cool and use fork to get strands of squash out, place in containers and refrigerate overnight. Continue with recipe - place butter in frying pan and saute onions and garlic - add spaghetti squash - cook for 15 - 20 minutes. This dish is great for enjoying spaghetti squash. Must try.

Great recipe! I substituted olive oil for the butter and added a pinch or two of dried basil. I wish we had used a bigger squash, as this one went very quickly.

Was excellent and would definitely make again.  Was a little heavy on garlic (and I love garlic!), and I added a sprinkle of parmesean cheese.

SO good and easy -- As I am a lazy cook, I didn't cook onion/garlic in butter.  I just put some minced garlic (from Costco) on the shredded squash, fresh basil, salt, pepper, and grated fresh Parmesan.  YUM!

This is utterly fabulous.  Very simple, flavorful, and fresh. I added some diced red peppers for color but even they were not neccessary.  I am looking forward to making this again.  Hands down, the best spagheeti squash I've ever had.

My husband normally pushes his squash to the side of his plate but this time he ate it all.  I gave some left overs to my aunt and she begged for the recipe since spaghetti squash promotes healthy living.  I just used less butter and it tasted just as good.  Very easy to do.
