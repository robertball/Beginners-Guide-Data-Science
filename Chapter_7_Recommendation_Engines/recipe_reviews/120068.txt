Good tasting, but thin pancake.  I scaled the recipe to 4 servings and used 2 egg whites.  I got 7 3" sized pancakes, so don't think that would make four servings.  My batter was thin so I let sit for 5 minutes and it did slightly thicken.  Overall the taste was good but this was not a fluffy type pancake.  I served with the Homemade Pancake Syrup recipe.

I made these pancakes this morning. I thought I would be feed my 19-month-old and myself, so I made half a batch. We gobbled those up in about five minutes. So when my husband took a bite and decided he needed "second breakfast," I made an additional full recipe. There are none left. So, for two and a half people to eat 12 servings, you learn two things: (1) they are really, really, really good, and (2) the recipe runs small, so if you're using the pancakes as the entire meal - no eggs and such - consider that the recipe really feeds two foodie adults, not eight.   I made the recipe exactly, but topped it with apricot syrup rather than marmalade. They are heavy and light at the same time, buttery smooth, tender, moist and irresistible. I suppose you could substitute any type of juice and matching topping to vary it ... acai berry juice with blueberry syrup, apple juice with apple syrup ...

This recipe is amazing, and it's a nice change on an old favorite.  I didn't use the marmalade, but I did add chocolate chips (I just sprinkled them on top) and maple syrup, and it was delicious!  I love orange chocolate!

Daniel Fast friendly  I'm doing the Daniel fast and I wanted to find a pancake recipe that at least resembled pancakes.  This may be it!  I ommited the eggs whites, orange extract, sugar, and baking powder.  What I added instead was extra applesauce (what looked liked 3 egg whites worth), a banana (for some sweetness, and a little cinnamon.  They turn out a little gummy but with some sugar free fruit spread on top it was hard to tell!    I'll be interested to try out this recipe again when my fast is over.

I wouldn't exactly call these pancakes 'light-n-fluffy', but they weren't 'sinkers' either.  My batter was rather thick -- most likely due to brand variances among whole wheat flours -- so spreading the recommended 2 tbs batter thin ensured a well-cooked, non-gummy pancake.  And even without the orange extract, the citrus flavor came through using freshly squeezed tangerine juice and a grating of zest.  Good way to start the new year a bit healthier.

This recipie is absolutely amazing. The pancakes are so moist and just melt in your mouth! Everytime I make these they are devoured. I usually end up making a second batch. The work pretty well as waffles too.

This is my first attempt at whole wheat cooking, and I'm pretty impressed! They were really easy to burn, so I turned down the heat to low and used more Pam, which helped. I had one with a sliced banana, but preferred it without any toppings. Thanks!

Thanks for this recipe, these pancakes are delicious.  I followed the recipe to a tee, minus the marmalade topping.  I had mine with maple syrup and they had just the right amount of orange flavoring, mellow, not overpowering.  The texture is fluffy/spongy, not at all dry.  These will get made again!

Um. Yum!!!  I didn't have the orange extract so I used lemon like someone else suggested.  I liked them as is with butter, my daughter used syrup.

These were so delicious! We ate them with whipped cream and marmalade or with maple syrup - both were great. I didn't have orange extract, so I grated some orange zest in to up the orange flavor. I can't believe something so healthy can be so tasty!

Oh, yum!  Hearty but moist.  A perfect breakfast.  I used fresh orange juice, omitted the orange extract, and added raisins and a few chocolate chips.  A keeper!

This is such a delicious recipe. I loved the sweet orange flavor. I didn't have orange marmalade so I just used sugar free maple syrup on top of my pancakes. I also omitted the orange extract since I was in a hurry & they turned out fine! I used Splenda for the sugar, too. A keeper for sure!

These were yummy! A little chewy, but no big deal. I made 3 servings which equated to four 4-inch pancakes. Servings are definitely off on the recipe which is why I gave it four stars. I mixed everything in the blender so I didn't have to dirty multiple dishes for just me.

Absolutely delightful! Delicate flavor with none of the typical slight bitterness that whole wheat pancakes can have. I didn't have orange extract, and so I used lemon juice instead. Puffy and light. These will be a regular with me!

Made exactly as directed, only using Splenda instead of sugar...these were fantastic! Sugar free and almost fat free...awesome! Delicious, nice and orange-y:-)
I used egg whites out of a carton, too...

THESE PANCAKES WERE ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. INSTEAD OF MARMALADE WE ADDED COOL WHIP AND DRAINED CANNED BABY ORANGE SECTIONS TO THE TOP AND MY OH MY WAS THAT A TREAT. THEY ARE SO GOOD YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO ADD ANYTHING TO THE TOP. THEY ARE GOOD AS IS. WHICH IS ESPECIALLY GOOD FOR THE KIDS AS A WHOLESOME QUICK SNACK. I PREPARE A BUNCH AND KEEP THEM AROUND. THIS RECIPE IS DEFINATELY A KEEPER. THANK YOU TO THE CONTRIBUTOR.

These were delicious.  I did not use the extract and also didn't have applesauce so I used oil.  I mixed oil and OJ/Mango juice; whipped the egg whites to peaks and added all to dry ingredients.  Folded in until completely mixed.  These pancakes were light and fluffy.  I will definitely make them again.  Thanks for this recipe.

Kudos for achieving such a soft and lofty whole wheat pancake. It's a five star for texture, but two star for flavor. Somehow the citrus flavor was off in my batch, like bitter after taste. The kids turned them down after two bites and my husband and I made ourselves finish our plate. We're not making them again.

Great healthy recipe!  I made them alongside the Sunday Morning Lemon Poppyseed Pancakes.  I think that overall the lemon ones were the family favorite, but nobody was turning their nose up at these, though!  I added a handful of dried cranberries.  They taste wonderful both with the orange marmalade to top or with light syrup.

I just didn't like these.  I am used to eating whole grains and I found these heavy and not tasty (but mostly heavy).  They took forever to cook through!  Also, I could have done without the orange extract.  It was too much.  I served these with blueberry syrup from Trader Joe's, and that was a good combo.

Really good orange flavor, and I just love all the healthy ingredients! These did come out a bit thin for me so next time I think I'll use less orange juice...these are not the fluffiest pancakes but they are moist and full of yummy orange flavor.  Thanks for sharing!
