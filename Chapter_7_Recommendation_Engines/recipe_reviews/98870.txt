I don't like onions much, so I used leeks instead and it was very good.

This was a very good recipe in all respects. Don't rush it, let it simmer so the rice is done. Next time I'll add shrimp. There are so many ways to vary this recipe but this is a definate keeper. Wife loves it.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I made a few modifications. I used garlic diced tomatoes instead of plain, increased the basil, upped the celery, and used both yellow and green onions.  Also, for more fiber, I used a blend of wild brown rices.  I'd love to try this and add beans or try shrimp as another reviewer suggested.  Hubby LOVED it.  I agree with the previous reveiewer though, try cooking the rice ahead of time.

I used instant rice because I needed to make something very quickly.  The whole meal took about 15 minutes and even with the inferior texture of instant rice compared to regular rice, the soup was great.  I added a little hot sauce to give it a kick and the result didn't taste like something I threw together at the last minute!

Yeah, I liked it.  Used 3 stalks celery, half a small bag of baby carrots, and maybe 1/4 C of fresh basil.  I also used shrimp I had shelled and sliced in half lengthwise.  I think next time I would either make it without the rice, or cook it ahead of time.  There wasn't enough rice to be significant, and it ended up only half cooked.  Overall, it was a great winter recipe.
