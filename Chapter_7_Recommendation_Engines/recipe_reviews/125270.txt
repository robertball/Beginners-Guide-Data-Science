Great mayonnaise cake!  The frosting is really wonderful!   I would have given it 5 stars, but the frosting was just a little too sweet. As with all mayo-cakes, it's best to make this the night before (it's sooo much better the next day, it's moister and more flavorful).  I don't know what the other reviewer did wrong, but I've never tasted the mayo in a mayonnaise cake before.

I usually have mayonnaise but no eggs or milk, so I liked this recipe.  I used whole wheat flour and brown sugar and microwaved it on 6 minutes high, and it turned out great.
There was no mayonnaise taste for me using Hellmann's Real.  Maybe if you used low-fat mayonnaise by mistake there would be more flavoring added to make up for the missing fat, so a mayonnaise taste would stick around.

I don't know what I was thinking when I made this cake.  Basically it's fine if you want your dessert to taste like mayonnaise, but I think it's bad.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OTHERS BUT THIS RECIPE WORKED AMAZING FOR ME. THE ONLY THING I DID DIFFERENTLY WAS I MADE CUPCAKES WITH IT. IT WAS VERY MOIST AND HAD A GREAT TASTE, NOT LIKE MAYO AT ALL.

I have made several mayonnaise cakes in the past and by far this is the best, for once my Grandma was asking me for the recipe instead of me asking her!! It's GREAT!!!

A very good recipe. I substituted the 1 c. of water with 1c. of brewed coffee and used almond extract instead of vanilla. I also used light helmanns mayo instead of regular mayo. The cake came out absolutely delicious and moist.  My family loved it!

Oh dear - we really wanted to like this, but it just didn't work for us.  I did use homemade mayo, but can't believe that would effect cake much.  Light, yes - but quite dry and, well, tasteless.  Tried drizzling some with chocolate, some with cherry brandy, some with a black cherry compote, some with whippd cream, and some with all 4 - still nada.  Hubby will bring home ice cream tomorrow and will try again then as I don't believe in wasting food, but don't think will make again.  Noting this was my first mayo cake, so perhaps it's simply something you need an aquired taste for...so so sorry.

This is like finding an old friend!  I remember it as our family favorite growing up.  I don't recall where my mom got the recipe -- it was supposed to have been invented by a fancy hotel in NY.  After eating it, a patron asked for the recipe and the hotel sent it along with a sizeable bill.  The patron started "sharing" it with everyone they knew to get even.  I don't know if it's true but it makes a good story about a fantastic cake.   We didn't use brown sugar frosting; usually chocolate fudge or chocolate with peanut butter.  Excellent!!

The cake tasted very good!  Moist and chocolatey.  It took 50 minutes to bake in a 9 x 9 pan.

I didn't care for the frosting.  It turned into a thick, hard crust that was much too sweet.  Next time I'll leave off the frosting and serve the cake warm with ice cream.

Great recipe.  I substitute 1c. of water with 1 cup of regular coffee at room temp.  It brings out the chocolate and makes the cake taste homemade and old fashioned.  I frost with Hrsheys Chocolate Frosting recip on the cocoa box.  This is a great recipe when you have excess condiments that need to be used up, or no eggs and veg oil on hand.

Wonderfully moist cake! The easiest to make ever. A one bowl sensation that took about 10 minutes to get into the oven. I did add 5 tablespoons of cocoa instead of 3, so the chocolate flavor was more intense. Very delicious. The frosting was way too sweet. I should have stopped at 3/4 cup confectioner's sugar for the frosting because it was really delicious at that point, but I continued to add the full amount just to give the recipe a fair try. Next time I will stop at 3/4 cup. Otherwise the flavor was fantastic. However, if you do decide to make it "full strength" prepare yourself for an instant sugar rush.

My mom use to make this cake all the time when I was a kid. Personally I never cared for it but my family does. I started making this for my son for his birthday when he was 4 years old. He's 29 now and no matter what he does for his birthday he expects a Mayonnaise Cake to be at mom's when he comes over to celebrate it with us.

I followed the recipe but I am very disappointed in the taste. DH said it had an onion taste to it? I used Hellmann's mayo would that have made it taste funny? I've had Chocolate Mayonnaise cake before and loved it. I don't want to give it any stars  but the site ask for a rating.

After fixing my mistake from yesterday, I tried the muffin tray this time around -  I found the following things - The batter was REALLY thick, I had to water it down a bit, I had the batter in the oven for 13 minutes or so and they turned out fine, although I didn't get smacked in the face with chocolate flavour like I was expecting even after putting more coco powder in. All in all though they turned out ok - I didn't make the frosting - maybe it would have turned out better if I had. :)

This was a very easy and tasty cake recipe..Very moist and very nice. I will never make another box chocolate cake again. I did, however use a different frosting recipe as the brown sugar was a bit too sweet for my taste. Other then that, it was just delicious..:)

I'm very please by how well this turned out. I increased the cocoa to 1/3 cup because I knew I wanted it quite chocolatey. I also used Kraft's reduced fat olive oil mayo, and it left no funny flavors in the cake.

Wow! I really didn't think this was going to be good, mayonnaise and all, but I was wrong. It was delicious. I really couldn't understand making a cake without eggs, so I threw two in at the last second! Turned out fantastic! I made them into mini muffins and used a chocolate mint frosting and YUMMY!!! Definitely going to triple this recipe and make a ton for the office bake sale. So quick and easy to make! Five stars for sure!

Excellent cake. I made the recipe one and a half times the size called for. This made a good sized sheet cake. My family and their friends loved it.

The cake was pretty good, but the brown sugar frosting was totally addicting!

I LOVE this mayonnaise cake. My grandma always made mayonnaise cake when we could come and visit or for our birthdays and this is just as good as hers. GREAT RECIPE!

The only change I made was to add an extra tablespoon of cocoa, and it still didn't have a very chocolately taste. I baked it in a 9x9 pan and it took more then an hour to cook through the middle. Once I removed it from the pan the sides became very very had and we were'nt able to eat it. Will not make again.
