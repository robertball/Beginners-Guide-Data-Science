I love this Jambalaya mix, and have been using it to make a kickin' version of this recipe for years!  I substitute beer and/or wine for the water, though.  It gives the dish a greater depth of flavor.  I often use what I have on-hand for the protiens, but love when I have diced ham, shrimp, diced chicken, and either andouille sausage, or even kielbasa works well.  I have also added black beans.  I find this Jambalaya mix to be very versatile.  This dish always impresses.

This was delicious and I didn't even have shrimp to add.  But I know it would be awesome with shrimp too.

I'm almost embarrassed to admit this, but maybe it will help some fellow clueless chefs out there.  Andouille sausage is a pre-cooked smoked pork sausage.  Just beware if you make any sort of sausage replacement, you should cook it first before you include it in this recipe!  Luckily I noticed before I included it and my cooked Italian sausage was a tasty substitute.  Great Recipe!

I got confused because I was trying to follow the directions and then follow the box directions. I choose to follow the box and it was too much water at the end. I would stick to these directions but it still was good.

I had all the ingredients on hand except the rice mix. I used 1 red, 1 yellow, 1 green bell pepper. 1 medium large onion, 1 pound small shrimp, 1 lb beef sausage ( the U shaped one). I sauteed all the veggies with 3 cloves of minced garlic. I sauteed the sausage and shrimp in a separate pan with red pepper flakes, black pepper and creole seasoning. The meat has better flavor that way i think. ( i also use chicken and ham on different occasions) I don't use water. Normally beef or chicken broth. I pour some wine in or beer. I also had about half cup or more of rice and adjust the fluids or add more when needed. I put red pepper flakes and black beans with the rice. At the end i mix in the meat.

I added another 1/4 cup water towards the end.  I felt it was getting too dry before the shrimp and rice were finished cooking.  The anduille sausage has quite a kick.  You could substitute polish sausage if you are looking for a more mild flavor.

I was a bit skeptical using a boxed mix but considering I'd never made jambalaya before, I was nervous to try anything else for my Mardi Gras get together.  This was absolutely delicious, easy, and was gone so quickly I was shocked.  My brother-in-law used to work as a chef in New Orleans and didn't even guess that it was from a box :)

I could not find the Zatarain's mix anywhere. I checked 3 supermarkets with no luck. I had all the other ingredients so I had to find a way to use it. I found a jambalaya mix recipe online but it called for dried ingredients. I made changes to that recipe by using fresh ingredients, then i incorporated it with this recipe and despite the numerous changes, it was fairly easy. I had no idea Jambalaya was so simple to make. This will be in my monthly rotation.

Great recipe!  I used smoked turkey sausage for a healthier option and it turned out great.  I couldn't find the "reduced sodium" mix, only the original, so it was pretty salty.  I'll do a more thorough search and stock up on the low sodium version when I find it.

I made this recipe for my church luncheon group.  Everyone loved it as it isn't too spicy (although it could be kicked up a notch with additional cayenne).  I added ham as well and a little extra water.  I also cooked it the day before the meal to let the flavors blend and then added the shrimp when I reheated it.  This has great flavor!

This dish was SO yummy! I had a mardi gras party and I was so surprised at how great this was. I ended up using garlic and provolone sausae which everyone loved - I think next time i will try the andouille sausage or make it with all shrimp. I also used cooked shrimp (like for shrimp cocktail) and threw them in at the last minute so they didn't get tough. It was such a hit!

I did not add the green peppers, considering it's spicy enough with the sausage and yellow pepper. I also added a 1/2 cup water to the mixture because it seemed a bit dry. Overall, an outstanding, "zippy" dish that reminds me of the south. Will make again for sure!

Not a huge fan of this one.  A lot of work and time for this one.  The rice seem to take along time to cook.  I also made a vegitarian version of this for my daughter.  She loved it.

Too spicy to eat, but it was kind of like an empty, flavorless spice which didn't make it worth pushing through the pain to eat it. I was really looking forward to trying something different and making a new tradition out of making this, but now I'm like, I'm glad I gave it a try (especially during Mardis Gras Week) but I will not be making this again.

This was AWESOME!!! I pre-chopped my veggies the night before so cooking would be quicker. I accidentally left out the yellow peppers, I found them in the fridge after the dish was complete. I also used the Spicy Jambalaya Mix by accident. I'm SO glad I used the spicy, I think it made the dish!!! I will be making this again. I hope I remember the yellow peppers.

This was my 1st time attempting to make Jambalaya. I followed the recipe almost exactly. I didn't have a yellow pepper - so as for veggies I used a green pepper, lil green onion..only because I prefer green onion and some sweet onion. I read 1 review where a lady saute her shrimp & sausage b4 adding them. I did and added the creole seasoning and red pepper. If you cannot eat spicy food DO NOT add the red pepper. I was able to eat it but some people complained that it was too hot. Over all this was gr8 recipe!!

Absolutely delicious!!! My friends and I cannot get enough. It's one of my favorite and easiest recipes to make. The only thing I did differently was Ro-tel instead of the roasted tomatoes.

I made this (with no changes) for a work potluck.  This was the most talked about dish and didn't last very long.  This is a very flavorful and not overly spicy dish.  I try to make this anytime shrimp or sausage is on sale.

I used kilbasa and cooked the shrimp in some cajun spices before adding it to the jumbalaya. I also had to add a little more water to let the rice fully cook. Sooo gooooood!!!

I made this last night for friends to celebrate "Fat Tuesday, it was a hit! We all loved it. The only small variations I made was to add two chopped cooked chicken breasts when I added the sausage and shrimp and had to add a bit of chicken stock or it would have been dry. This is a dish I will certainly be making again!

only my opinion... and Hubby's too but I followed this recipe exactly and think it is in desperate need of a kick. Maybe some hot pepper sauce and I'm not sure what else but I really thought it was kind of bland for cajun food.

This was very good! To be honest, I didn't care for the sausage much but the shrimp was great! Will definitely be making this again!

This was fantastic!  I added a good bit of dried red pepper, dill weed, garlic salt and basil leaves.  However, this meal was perfect for Mardi Gras!

I made this for my husband's bday dinner. He loved it . It doesn't take a lot of effort for what you end up with. I used pineapple sausage instead of the kind recommended. It gave the dish a sweet and spicy flavor to it.

This was so good! I didn't use shrimp but instead chicken andouille, and it was fabulous. And I used dried parsley (it's what was on hand).

This dish  dish was a lil' out the box for me, which is why I decided to try it.  I don't do good with spicy but I cooked it anyway.  I couldn't find Andouille sausage so I used jalepeno sausage (14 oz pkg).  I had to use more water about 1.5 to 2 cups because I wanted mine a little saucy -don't like it too dry!  My husband and I liked it.  It was slightly spicy which was perfect for me but next time I won't make it spicy at all and see what happens.  I esp like the ease/simplicity of this recipe.  Thx for posting it!

Really good!  We used red instead of yellow pepper (the store was out), and use Chorzio sausage instead of Andouille (again, the store didn't have it). Also, the shrimp were pre-cooked frozen/thawed, so we added them in the last 5 minutes instead of 10.  Finally, we pre-cooked and browned the sausage before adding it for the last 10 minutes.  Very tasty, we'll definitely make it again!

This recipe was very easy and tasty.  I didn't like that Zatarain's had MSG and other ingredients I try to avoid.  so I looked at some of the other jambalaya recipes that didn't use a mix to see what seasonings they used.  I used a combo of garlic powder, dried thyme, dried oregano, paprika, tabasco sauce and beef bullion.  I used chicken andouille sausage to lower the fat.  I also added precooked, frozen rice.  The result was awesome.

Very easy and good. I had to add a little bit more water, and i think next time I will use 2 packages of Zatarain's instead of just one.

This recipe is outstanding and will now become a Fat Tuesday tradition in my house!! 

The only change I made was to substitute the one green bell pepper with another yellow bell pepper, simply because my husband and I don't like green ones.  

Thank you for a great recipe!

This was my first attempt at a jambalaya. I doubled the recipe. I could not find andouille sausage, so I chose 2 different smoked sausages. and browned them first. I added 1 cup rice, and 3 cups extra water, as our kids can not heat spicy food. When it was done, I dumped everything into my slow cooker on low, mostly to keep it warm. It was delicious.

I tried this recipe last night and my husband and I loved it! I did a couple of things differently. Since my sausage needed cooking, I cooked that first and then cooked the onion and veggies is the grease. It gave it a lot of flavor. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. Thanks for posting!

This dish was delicious. I put the sausage in with the vegetables, at the beginning. I found the consistency was just right -- not to thick or watery. 

Also added a boneless chicken breast, cut-up & tossed with cajun seasoning - then added to the dish & cooked a bit before adding the tomatoes. This dish is definitely be a keeper.

I have made this wonderful, easy dish several times.  The first time I only used sausage, and it was good but not great.  The key to making it great is to make sure to use two types of meat, my favorites are the sausage and chicken.  I dice approx two chicken breasts into bite sized pieces and sauté them in olive oil and sprinkle them generously with Cajun seasoning. it also helps to make it spicier, for those who like a little more kick.  I love this recipe for its ease and taste, next time I make it I plan on doubling the recipe when we have company and use shrimp, chicken, and sausage.

One of my go to recipes. I use whatever meat I have on hand, so it's different almost ever time. I add a dash of red wine, and use broth instead of water. I also add a few dashes of our favorite hot sauce. My family loves it!

I thought this was a really good recipe but am only giving it 4 stars because I had to make a couple really minor modifications. First off, it's not spicy enough as it is. I added habeneros to ours to add some extra kick, but that is my personal preference. Also, I had to add about 1/4-1/2 cup extra water towards then end because it was drying out too quickly. Over all, this is a very good recipe and we loved the end result.

This was a solid dish. Very good, but not "wow". Considering it starts with a boxed mix, though, it comes out very well. Brown the sausage pieces, set aside, and cook the veggies in the same pan for maximum flavor. Thanks for sharing!

This was great but I did have to add more water than the recipe called for.  Also couldn't find the reduced sodium mix so it was a little salty.  I didn't add shrimp but I'm sure that would be great.  Be sure to cook the sausage separately- I was able to render a lot of fat out of the dish by cooking it first, draining it well on paper towels and then adding to the rice mixture.

Very good and quick but NEEDS a little kick.  I put about a tablespoon of chipotle pepper paste in it and it was perfect!
