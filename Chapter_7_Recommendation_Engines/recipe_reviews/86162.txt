Loved this!  I cooked it a lot more simply (and faster), and would do that again. I didn't bake it at all, but just simmered it for about 10 minutes on the stove after adding the yogurt.  I used only 1 Tbl. oil, 1 onion (which I thought was plenty!), 2 pods of cardamom (1 wasn't enough), 2 tsp. ginger (instead of 1/4 tsp.), 1/2 tsp. chili powder, and didn't dilute the yogurt with water. The recipe didn't state when to add the mint and cilantro, so I just added them at the end, right before serving (in addition, I used only half the amounts of mint and cilantro called for). Perfect!  Note that 16 oz. of yogurt is equal to 2 cups. I also made the rice separately in my rice cooker. Thanks so much for the recipe!

I'm the author of this: apologies. Please add the mint while cooking the gravy and add cilanthro at the very end in the gravy as well. The rice must be boiled half way before putting it in to bake, otherwise it will turn into mush!

Considering that Biryani is totally a north Indian dish, I was intrigued by the title. I was all the more puzzled when the recipe called for baking.

However, following the recipe, I ended up with a fabulous dish. Really as authentic as I have known it.

Few pointers. The quantity of salt is not clear. I added 1.5 teaspoons of salt to the rice and a teaspoon to the sauce. The recipe does not tell you what to do with the cilantro,mint and lime. Squeeze the lime before baking. Cilantro,mint can be added the last minute and tossed before taking out of the oven.

Being a vegetarian, I totally eliminated the chicken and substituted it with 2 boiled eggs. Worked just fine! 

Great with cucumber raita! Worth the effort!

My whole family really really enjoyed this dish.  It wasn't too spicey for the picky kids but was interesting and flavorful enough for my husband and I to enjoy.  I'll definitely make this again.

This was very bland. I live in an Indian neighborhood and have had excellent Biryani before and this was a huge disappointment. It smells right but tastes like nothing!

I wouldn't know about the authencity, as I have never had this before.......but I do know about flavour, flavour!! Unfortunately I didn't have time to bake, so did a little extra time on stove and basmati rice on the side. I added an extra clove and pod, cause you can never have too much of a good thing. Will be making and baking this one again. Thank you.

I rated this one the day after I made it and said that I thought the proportions were out - too much rice! Not enough liquid & spices..added garam masala, coriander, cumin etc...also added steamed (can microwave or fry) chunks of potato before baking...tasty with afew modifications..

Sorry, but I just wasn't thrilled. The rice turned to mush and the overall flavor was just so-so. It would maybe be helped by making the sauce and cooking the rice completely on the stove and skipping the oven part all together. Also, I'm glad I looked at the reviews to figure out when would be a good time to add the cilantro and mint.

This was my first attempt at making south indian biryani.  I added a few modifications to this recipe such as adding more cloves and cardamum.  I also added a bay leaf to add more flavor and aroma.  I also added the store bought biryani mix which made it tasty but extra spicy.  I did not have any mint but it still came out flavorful.  Overall this was a good biryani but I will make sure not too add too much of the biryani mix or find a more milder one. I think next time when my parents come to visit I may make it for them.  I think they would be proud. Thanks for posting this recipe.

Very bland.  The spice mix did not produce even a hint of what I think biryani should taste like.

I made this for a dinner party, and everyone was pleased.  Some Indian food is too spicy for the average middle class American, but this was liked by all.  I doubled the spice, per the other reviewers, but it was still a little bland.  I kept the rice separate and spooned the mix on top of it on the plate.

I'm a good cook but something went wrong when I tried this.  I used my Le Creuset large baking dish which normally cuts down the baking time but I only baked it for 30 mins.  All the liquid was absorbed, the rice tasted okay but the chicken was way overcooked.  And it really is very bland as others have mentioned which surprised me considering all the onions and spices used.  I won't make this again but will still be learning how to cook good Indian food since I really love i! (Well, I love all food!)

My husband actually loved this, but I found it to be rather bland and my kids wouldn't touch it (they really like Indian curries, but this didn't appeal to them at all).  If I were to make it again, I'd probably only do 1 1/2 or 2 cups of rice, I used 1 1/2 lbs of chicken and still found the proportion of rice to chicken to be rather high.  I'd probably double all the spices as well, I felt the dish did not have much flavor, especially given all the work that went into it.

I honestly didn't like this very much; I have tried other Biryani recipes and this was the least one I liked. It lacked flavor and the instructions weren't very clear in my opinion. I did reduce the amount of yogurt significantly too.

Wow!  My family loved this recipe.  I followed the recipe as written, and while it did take a while to prepare, I felt the flavors developed nicely.  It wasn't quite what I was expecting when I pulled it out of the oven; there was very little sauce, but my kids (3 and 5 years old) ate it like it was going out of style.  I will definitely be making this again.

I made this with ground kabob chicken meat which was too wet to stay together on the skewer.  This recipe is really good and I will make it again.  I did not use any cloves - wife dislikes the taste.

Turned out good. Not sure how authentic a biryani this is though. I used biryani masala powder (available at all indian stores)instead of the cloves, cardamom and cinnamon and used onion powder instead of onions. I  also cooked it on the stove instead of baking. It was quite good and easy to make.

yummmmm...great taste (just don't accidentally use vanilla yogurt unless you want a sweet biryani ;) )
