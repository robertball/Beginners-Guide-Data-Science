We love to try new chili recipes, and this was great! I didn't use raisins (don't like) and used an apple/pineapple chutney I had leftover from another recipe. Put it in the slow cooker for about 5 hours. Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this recipe on a whim - it was too weird to pass up!  I really thought I had a "let's order pizza" recipe when it was cooking, but the taste is AWESOME!  My husband says I have to make it again (I might try the chicken next time) and even my 18-month old liked it (although it's a bit spicy).  Reheating leftovers at work resulted in a bunch of people asking for the recipe!  Thanks!

As a birthday dinner, Casablanca Chili was attractively bizarre.  I do admit that at first sight, this cuisine is aesthetically repulsive.  However, give it a chance and these random ingredients will make your mouth water.  For those sophomoric chefs Mango Chutney could be quite new.  It makes the meal.  Embellish.  Move out of your comfort zone here folks, good things will happen.  Optomism and variety are healthy additions to your lifestyle.

Yum!  This got two thumbs up last night!I did make a couple changes - first off, my hubby is allergic to peanuts (peanut butter, peanut oil, etc)so I substituted cashew butter. Also sauteed 1/2 small onion, diced, before adding the other ingredients (next time might add a clove of garlic, minced, too);finally, I used 2 cans of garbanzos, because I didn't have the chile beans.  This is a keeper - as others have said, don't be scared off by the ingredient list - it all comes together beautifully!

Amazingly awesome chili!!!  People I shared this recipe with were skeptical until they tried it.  I was even worried about making chili with peanut butter, but I followed the recipe to the letter & it was wonderful.  Next time I might spice it up with a hotter mango chutney (or just use more).  Thanks for a great recipe!

What a delicious, easy recipe!  I didn't have mango chutney, so I added mango preserves, diced jalepenos, a little habanero sauce, and about 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  Thank you for this "keeper".  By the way, my kids (2 and 3) love it as well.

An unusual "chili" with a marvelous and different taste.  We served it with a rice/onion pilaf that was a perfect accompaniment.

With ingredients like these I had to try it - and have been raving about it ever since. The most unique flavor that is very impressive wherever you take it. Great flavor and surprising heat!

I just cooked this recipe. This turned out very goos and flavorful. I didn't have peanut butter so I used Thia peanut sauce instead.  Also I am a Chaldean American so there always is some pickled spicy mango in the fridge instead of mango chutney. I didn't have a lot so I also added in some dried chopped apricots. I didn't add the raisins, my hubby and daughter don't like. I would definetley make this again.

We were looking for an original chili to enter into a work competition and is becoming a favorite meal. Dont be afraid to spice it up - we added chili powder (1tsp) and some diced potatoes. The ingredients go so well together!

Three things I like about this recipe - it's VERY quick and easy to make, it's unique, and I love the sweet and spicy combo. Great way to use up leftover Easter ham. (okay, that's 4) :)

Ugh, this recipe was terrible!  It was disappointing, because I like all the ingredients (except for ham, which I replaced with chicken), and I thought it would be tasty.  It was just so overwhelmingly sweet!  The taste of the chili beans did not fit at all with the other flavors.  If I ever made this recipe again (which I probably won't), I would use no chili beans, more chickpeas, and little or no brown sugar.  Who knows, maybe it's better with ham?

Very .... Twangy.  If you have a real sweet tooth and want to try something different, go for it.  I followed the recipe to the letter and found it unpalatable.

This was really yummy.  I made it when my mother was here--I was sure she wouldn't like it--I mean, mango chutney?  But I had to use up leftover turkey, and I had the ingredients on hand.  We all loved it!  (even my 4 yo)  Mom begged for the recipe.  We ommitted the peppers (didn't have them in the cupboard) and served it over rice--

We make this with Boca brand soy crumbles instead of meat. I also made a homemade mango chutney (from this site, I believe) to go with it. This is one of a few recipes that my omnivore husband and my vegetarian self can both enjoy (made with the soy of course!).

The balance of sweet and spicy was great.  My husband preferred it to be a little more spicy, said it was too sweet, so I cut back on the mango chutney (only kind in our store was a sweet and spicy mix-so it made the dish a little sweeter and brown sugar some and he enjoyed it better.  But try it first the way the recipe calls for it.

I used my homemade mango chutney, so perhaps it's sweeter than commercially prepared stuff; I'd suggest omitting the brown sugar to cut down on the sweetness.  My husband & I liked this with warmed pita bread.

This was delicious!  My husband raved about it, too.  The flavors were unusual and the sweetness was a nice change from the ordinary.  The hardest part was cutting up all the ham.  What a chore it was to cut it from the bone, trying to leave all the fat behind!  It was worth the effort, though!

What an interesting lineup of ingredients, just had to try it!  Followed the recipe to the letter except for cutting the brown sugar in half, and giving an orange wedge a good squeeze into the chili pot.  Just when you think this may be too sweet, the tomatoes with green chili peppers give you a spicy smack in the mouth.  This may not be for everybody, but it was enjoyed in this house.  Served with toasted pita bread wedges.

I won a chili cook off at my work with this recipe!  It's unique, tasty, and easy to make.  You can add habaneros to spice it up or replace the meat with cubes or extra firm tofu for a vegetarian version and it still tastes great.  I always make a double batch and it never lasts long.

Very interesting and unusual.  Quite sweet-tasting.  Next time I'll halve or even eliminate the brown sugar and see what happens.  Great way to enjoy leftover ham!

What a nice change for using up leftovers. Freezes and reheats well.  Husband added hot sauce, though it was already a bit spicy for me. i also used crunchy PB, since that was all i had, and doubled the amount.  Used key lime juice b/c i like it better.

If I could give this recipe 6 stars, I would!!! At first glance the ingredient list looks bizarre... but I have had so many experiences where a weird list of ingredients turns out to be a delicious meal.  This was AWESOME - such a delicious combo of sweet and spicy.  I used leftover ham (not turkey).  I would describe the flavor as being like "Indian style ham and beans".  The mango chutney really makes the dish.  I had a friend over for dinner that night and she loved it too.  This recipe is super simple to make.  The only modification I could envision is maybe adding in some fresh chopped sweet onions.  Oh, and I forgot to add the raisins - didn't miss them.  Try this recipe, you'll love it!

I love this recipe. It is a very different take on chili. Every time I have leftover ham, I make a big pot. Don't let the ingredients fool you, it is a perfect combination of sweet and hot.

This sounded odd until I tried it.  Made with Thanksgiving leftover turkey, it was delicious and rich but not overly sweet or spicy. I deleted the peppers, but may include them next time. It is very easy and fool-proof. Making it with ham, the recipe's first suggestion, would be good, too, because of the spices and sugar in the recipe. Good for using ingredients on hand from the cupboard.

This was something different and really good.  The mango chutney added a nice kick, although I didn't use the whole amount.  The recipe didn't say how much diced tomatoes and chilies to use.  I put in a pound can of diced tomatoes and a small can of diced chilies because that was what I had on hand.

This dish was a pleasant surprise.  I substituted the garbanzos with great northern beans, and it was scrumptious.  Definitely a keeper!

Very good, But very very sweet. if its too sweet add jalapeno peppers and cut some of the brown sugar and its a little better.

I got good reviews on this dish last night.  It was extremely easy to make perfect for a busy weeknight. I was suprised that my guest could not identify any of the "odd ball" ingredients- especially the peanut butter. None of them are over powering and they blend nicely into an interesting flavor.  I went light on the allspice since the ham had been roasted with cloves, skipped the chick peas and doubled the chili beans, added a touch of cumin and it was very good.  Its not something I would go out of my way to make, but when you've roasted a 12 lb ham and you're sick of eating it plain, this is a great way to add some pizzaz and come up with a completely new flavor.

I have made this several times before. I made it for a chili contest at work and got 2nd place!! I love the combination of flavors....sweet and salty.  Smart and Final has a big bottle of mango chutney they sell which I use for this recipe and when I make lamb curry with leftover leg of lamb.

I made this the other day but with a few additions and changes, I used dark red kidney beans instead of the beans and spicy sauce and I added a 1/2 cup of chopped dark chocolate at the end.

Made this with a few modifications.  No raisins, and I had no mango chutney, so I subbed apricot fruit spread.  We liked it very much.  It was an interesting way to use leftover ham.  I will probably make again using chicken.  Thanks Janice!

I really had fun using the exotic (to me anyway) ingredients in this.  I thought it was excessivly spicy though and I'm fairly accustom to hot dishes.  The clincher was though that no one else though it was at all good.  Don't serve it to your children they'll think your torturing them and if you husband is a meat and potatoes kind of guy don't even think about it.  I would think that newly weds would be the only candidates contemplate this one.

I saw this recipe and "grimaced" a little.  The ingredients just didn't make my mouth water.  However I had so much ham left over from Easter Sunday and I didn't want it to go to waste so I decided to give it a whirl.  And I am so glad I did! This was great! However no matter what I tried in the past I do not like chick peas so I substituted white cannelli beans instead and I kept everything else the same.

This was certainly different and good for a change, but I think I will stick with the more traditional chili recipes. Not something I would make again because it had too much of a "nutty" taste.

This was for sure a unique recipe. I bought diced ham to use & followed exact recipe. It was sweet, I didn’t mind that, I missed ground beef. I did serve with shredded cheese and oyster crackers

Interesting combination of ingredients so had to try.  It was surprisingly good.  I enjoyed it though my wife did not.  Add some extra hot sauce and its more of an Indian dish.
