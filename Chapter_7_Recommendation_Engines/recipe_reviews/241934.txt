A friend of mine made these and we had them at her house. They were so delicious I had to make them myself. I used all coconut sugar and pecans instead of walnuts. I must admit I am a cookie dough lover more than a cookie lover and this dough is amazing! The Chia seeds and cacao nibs give a little crunch that is soooo good! These are just as good baked, too. I love that we get a little more nutrition while getting our cookie fix :). I will definitely be making these again!

These were phenomenal!  Someone wrote that even the dough was good and they were right!  I made a few changes....I only used half a cup of brown sugar, I used 1 cup of flour and 2 cups of a protein pancake mix I have sifting them all together.  I absolutely will be making these again!

LOVE the combo of nuts, semi-sweet chocolate and chia seeds! I didn't have all the ingredients, and used only half the amount of sugar (in brown sugar), but found them still too sweet for our tastes... next time I would try adding applesauce in place of some of the sugar and oil.  Also I just used baking powder in place of the baking soda and tartar, and they fluffed up great!

Best cookies I have EVER had!  I add coconut to mine instead of chocolate chips and that makes them great as well!

I omitted the cup of Ghirardelli dark chocolate from the recipe. Only used the 1/4 cup of cocoa nibs & feel like that was enough.
On 1/2 of the cookies I also sprinkled some coconut flakes on top of them before putting them in the oven.
The cookies turned out great with and without the coconut flakes and gave them some variety.
And since the recipe made so many cookies, I put 1/2 in the freezer. 
It's nice to have a delicious treat on hand so I don't turn to the store bought processed junk in times of weakness...thanks for the recipe! :)

I use all coconut oil, & only a maximum of 3/4C. They're still amazing, so wonderfully earthy from all the nuts , seeds, & whatever else I can find to throw in!

Amazing!!  Holds it shape really well. Might cut back on the walnuts just a little as they are a tinsy bit dry. But otherwise delightful!

This are very good, not as good as my normal ones, but pretty good none the less, also little more healthy so its a good trade off

I also didn't have dark chocolate chips so I'd imagine it would make it even better

If you dont have cream of tartar you can replace it with it with baking powder

I made it exactly by the recipe, and my family loved it.  Everyone agreed the cookies are best when room temperature.  They do not spread a lot while baking, and turn out crispy.

I didn’t change a thing in the recipe and they are great.  I have been changing the classic Toll House cookie recipe for years, adding flax seed, grinding up Uncle Sam cereal for part of the flour back in the late 1970s.  This recipe takes them to another level.  I do wish there was a nutrient and calorie count, but I guess I’ll have to do that myself.  I’m at 3500 feet elevation, which is borderline for baking.  I pressed them down with a fork and stuck them in the freezer for a few minutes before baking so they wouldn’t be quite so thick. Will make again!

I liked these cookies. They are chewy with a nice crunch. I had to use gluten free flour, so I used a mix with red sorghum and buckwheat flour and some starches. I used a cup-to-cup ratio. They came out perfectly and cooked in exactly the time written. Thank you for the recipe.

Our household follows a vegan lifestyle, so I omitted the eggs completely. Wow! These were delicious and crisp, a quality that I don't always associate with 'healthy' cookies. I will be making these again!

Wonderful!  My husband and colleague's at work all say it's the best cookie they have ever had!  Can't stop eating them.  5 stars
