This was very good!  I won't say my kids loved it but my husband and I did.  Afer reading other reviews I did the following: I made sure the fish weren't crowded in the pan.  I used a shallow pan, and I cooked it in a 375 degree convection oven for 30 minutes.  It came out crispy on the outside and just right on the inside.

The idea was good, but the catfish turned out a little bland and mushy.  I ended up turning the oven on to broil to crisp up the crust.  The fish would have turned out better if the fish was fried instead of baked.  If I make it again I will definitely need to add more seasoning and use bread crumbs instead of flour.  I use the same ingredients, substitute the flour for breadcrumbs, on chicken breast.  It is really good.  The breadcrumbs give the fish or chicken a crispier crust than the flour does.

I was a little hesitant to make this recipe but I'm so glad I did.  I made a few changes. I seasoned the catfish with a bit of salt, garlic, and black pepper before dipping into the egg. For the flour/cheese mixture, I didn't use any flour at all, I subsituted the flour with seasoned bread crumbs, and I  added cayenne pepper to the mixture.
I baked it in the oven for about 35 minutes, then put it in the broiler for another 5 minutes for crispiness.  Once crispy, I spread some shredded cheddar cheese on top of the filets, and left it in the oven(not broiler again) for a couple of minutes, until the cheddar was melted.
It was perfect!!  My husband had seconds, and leftovers for lunch the next day.  He said this is one of his favorites now.  Thanks!!!

I also added garlic and cayenne to the dredging mixture, and had to bake the fish for 25-30 minutes.  Everyone raved, and it was welcomed as a new catfish recipe for the family!

This recipe was great.  I took other suggestions and used tilapia and baked at it at 375 for 30 minutes.  I also substituted half of the flour for breadcrumbs. It was a big hit!

This was really the best, I did as everyone said and used seasoned bread crumbs instead of the flour and it was delicious!  In addition i allowd the filets to marinade in a mixture of blended chive, a bit of garlic, pepper and lemon juice before dipping it in the egg mixture and.  I also used cheddar and not parmesan and allowed it to bake for 30 minutes and it tasted great.  However next time I will dip the fish in egg first then flour then egg and breadcrumbs.  In that way I'll get more to stick to the fish.

I used catfish nuggets and it turned out great!  I didn't use all of the cheese mixture, it kept great in a ziplock bag in the freezer until the next time I made this.  My husband even liked it and he's doesn't usually like fish very much.

The fish turned out too bland, and I didn't like that it wasn't at all crispy on the outside. It needs longer time in the oven and bread crumbs coating instead of flour. I probably won't cook it again. I was dissapointed.

This recipe truly is simple to make and is very delicious.  My family loved it, children included!  I experimented and substituted about 1/4 tsp, or a little more, of Old Bay seasoning and some garlic powder for the salt and pepper.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

This turned out mushy for me, too, and it definately needed to be cooked longer than 15 minutes.  The flavor was a little bland.  My husband ended up pouring hot sauce over his and he liked it much better.

Omgosh, SO good!  I live in the boonies of GA...catfish is the norm here but most of the time it is fried.  this is a wonderful alternative to those of us who don't care for fried foods!!  This was SO good.  It was golden and crisp, tho I DID have to cook it longer than the 15 mins. suggested time.  It was more like 30-35 mins when it was all said and done.  I followed the recipe as is with the exception of not adding paprika (didn't have it) and with adding garlic powder to the mix.  I soaked the fish in the liquid and then heavily coated it with the flour/cheese mixture.  It is wonderful, thanks for sharing!

I can't imagine why anyone would give this recipe fewer than 5 stars!  I did mess with it, but just barely.  Come to think of it, even without the changes, it would STILL deserve five stars for how perfectly the fish turned out--talk about 'melt-in-your-mouth!  I sprinkled garlic salt and lemon pepper all over the fillets just before putting them into the oven.  After about 30 minutes, I sprinkled shredded colby-jack over them and waited until the top was nice and golden.  This is one of the quickest, easiest, delicious recipes I've made.  My five-year-old raved about it, and my two-year-old even ate it by the handful because a fork just couldn't do the trick quickly enough!  To cut down on the butter puddle, you could put the fillets on a grill pan and put the whole pan in the oven.

I give this recipe a 5 after altering the recipe based on other reviewers' suggestions.  i used no flour, only bread crumbs.  i omitted paprika and instead added a tsp of cayenne pepper (and a little cayenne sure does go a long way).  i hardly poured on any butter, less than half, and even that was too much.  it does make the catfish soggy.  you will def need to use the broiler to crisp up the outside of the fish.  and lastly, I added mild chedder on top and had it broiled for about a min.  the extra cheese on top really does zest it up.  total cook time for me was about 25 minutes.  as far as the extra dredge, yeah there is a lot left over, but i like excessive when i am dipping the fish in it.  better to have extra than not enough.  my husband loved this dish.  i will have a hard time topping this meal...

This is the BEST fish fillet recipe I've ever done! And, as an old  traditional "mackeral snapper" I have many. I scaled it back to three fillets and used seasoned bread crumbs instead of flour. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. I used a cookie sheet with aluminum foil sprayed with vegetable spray and it was done in 20 minutes to perfection. The coating was browned, not quite as crisp as deep fried and that's fine. The texture of the fish was perfect- moist and flavorful. Wife usually uses tarter sauce and I usually use liberal amounts of lemon juice. This needed NOTHING ELSE, just fine the way it is. This would probably be a "five" without the seasoned bread crumbs, but I think it causes it to be a "BAM!-kick it up a notch" to even higher. This goes to the very top of my fish fillet list. This is definitely "company good." Thanks Deborah- you rock!!!

We made this during a vacation with our entire family and this turned out absolutely wonderful! Even my sister, who hates fish, kept going back for seconds! I have to admit I was disappointed when all the nuggets were gone, I wanted more! YUM! Definitely a once a month meal! Thanks!

Very good and easy.  Definitely needs to be cooked more than 15 minutes.  At least 20 minutes, probably closer to 25.  It's a nice change to your usual fish recipes.  I served it with lemony broccoli and almonds...YUM!

Very easy & good.  I use 1/2 the amount of butter, and probably 1/2 the amount of flour mixture.  I baked 25 min. 2 yr old loved it.

I followed the recipe and baked the fish, but found it the coating a little mushy and way too buttery, so we took the baked filets and flash fried them on the stove and my husband and my son just raved.  The taste was great, and after being flash fried were crunchy.  I will recommend it to my friends.

I added the garlic powder and a spritz of cayenne as others suggested and baked for 45 minutes at 375.  Served with tartar sauce and a slice of lemon, my eight-year-old scarfed down an entire filet.  We liked it too!

Delicious meal. I did use about half seasoned bread crumbs and half flour. I also sprinkled some salt and pepper on the fish before following the other steps. Big mistake! The recipe was fine as it was...unless you like a LOT of salt. I used only 6 (4oz each) fillets and they ended up baking for 30 minutes at 375 degrees. I didn't need to broil them...they were crisp enough as is. Even my non-fish loving husband was impressed with the meal.

It is very good, but 15 minutes is no where near long enough for the breading to become crispy or for the fish to fully cook.

This was excellent, I used bread crumbs from homemade cheese bread and followed the recipe for the other ingredients.  Although I did substitute whiting.  My husband loved it!

Really liked this reciped. Took others ideas about adding breadcrumbs & cutting flour, it worked great. Also baked it at 375 for 30 minutes and it came out crispy. Would make again for sure.

This is the most delicious catfish recipe I have ever tasted!  As I am dieting, I made a few modifications:
I didn't use any egg, just dipped the fillets in the milk.  I didn't use any flour but 1/3 seasoned breadcrumbs and 2/3 grated parmesan cheese, added garlic powder, a dash of garlic salt and placed the fillets on a cookie tray with aluminum foil sprayed with canola spray.  Instead of pouring butter over the cutlets, I gently sprinkled parmesan on top of the fillets and then sprayed some I Can't Believe It's Not Butter on top.  I baked it at 350 for about 10 minutes and it looked like nothing was happening so I set the oven to low broil for 5 1/2 minutes and it was moist and crisp around the edges.  I shaved a few slivers of sharp cheddar and placed it on top of the fillets as previously suggested and left the fillets in the oven for 1 minute with the oven off just to melt the cheese.
Absolutely delicious, thanks!

THe recipe as is is just a 3, but following the other people suggestions turned it up... here is waht we did.

omit the flour, use seasonsed bread crumbs/cornmeal (you could use panko too), Old bay seasoning instead of paprika, and salt and pepper in the egg wash. I did 2 almost 1/2 lb fillets and cooked for 20 (flipping 1/2 way) at 375. Then i did 4-6 minutes under the broiler (flipping again). this crisped up the outside and left the inside soft and flaky. perfect. My kids (5, 2 and 2) are the pickiest eaters and they all loved mommies "fish sticks".

I was disappointed by this recipe.  I didn't make any changes to it but it did not get crispy.  I broiled it at the end because it looked mushy.  The coating was slimy when we ate it.  Between the slimy coating and the fishy catfish taste, we dumped a lot of this dinner in the garbage.

Great with a few changes.  I omited the milk and instead added a little lemon juice and fresh garlic.  I used breadcrumbs instead of flour.  I also used talapia as catfish is so..well..fishy!  I baked at 350 for 15 minutes and then broiled it for another 3 or 4 to get a crisp top.  Very yummy!  My husband and 2 year old both liked it lots!

Very good. I omitted the butter (for health reasons and I sprayed Pam on the fish instead.  It browned up nicely and was very good. I also seasoned my fish prior to dipping it in the egg mixture which I think adds to the flavor. I would definitely make this again and next time would take the suggestion of using breadcrumbs instead of flour.

I made this for the family last night and it turned out great.  I used Talapia and substituted 1/2 the flour with bread crumbs.  It was crunchy and flovorful.  Very nice and easy.  Thanks.

This is a time consuming recipe for those who have no time. They were mushy after I got them done so I flash fried them like someone suggested. They were tasty if your tired of plain fried fish.

I normally study the reviews before trying out a new recipe, but this time I forgot to.  I'm so glad I didn't b/c I probably wouldn't have made it if I had.  The catfish turned out great, I don't eat fish, but my husband was raving about it.  I made it exactly as the recipe called for.  The only thing I did differently was to add a touch of lemon pepper seasoning to the tops of the catfish before pouring on the butter.  I also had to bake it for another 5 minutes.  Don't listen to the other reviews, the recipe is great as-is.

A friend and I made this as part of our monthly meals (this is a great recipe to freeze for a later meal). She baked it, DELICIOUS!! and I grilled it, DELICIOUS!! Even the children (18mo, 3,4,6) all ate and loved it. If you do grill it make sure you cook it on one side, and do not flip it untill it no longer sticks, this way it doesn't fall apart.

This was pretty good. I omitted the flour and the milk. I seasoned my egg with salt and pepper and I used Italian bread crumbs mixed with garlic powder, parmesan cheese, and Caribbean jerk to spice it up. I put the catfish in the egg and then covered it with the breadcrumb mixture. I put 1 1/2 T melted butter over my two fillets. I baked them at 350 for 18 minutes and then under the broiler for 4 minutes (I did each side of the fish for two minutes). It was pretty good. I squeezed lemon on mine and that added good flavor. I thought it tasted more like chicken than fish, which was good. A nice way to get good-for-you fish without tasting fishy.

This was really good.  I'm not really practiced in making fish, but this recipe made me look like a pro.  I made changes as suggested:  Used Italian breadcrumbs instead of flour, and, since I didn't have Creole seasoning, I used just a touch of Cayenne pepper for the kick.  I had 4 really big catfish fillets, and there was LOTS of dredge left, so that could definitely be cut back.  The fish cooked at 375 for 40 minutes, and then I broiled for just a few minutes to brown them.  PERFECTO.  My husband loved it.  My 5 yr old loved it.  I looked good.  Thanks Deborah!

Very good. I used Tilapia, and based on some of the "soggy" reviews, I omitted the milk, used breadcrumbs instead of flour, and baked for 25 mins, then broiled for 3 mins (baking time will vary based on the thickness of your fillets. Nice, crispy and flavorful as well as easy. I'll make this again w/ other fish & chicken. Thanks.

This recipe is really good!  I don't usually like baked catfish but this change my mind. I took the advice of "d" and used Old Bay & garlic powder instead of salt & pepper.  It is a quick "whip-it up" dinner for after work. My kids loved it too.

This is a good, mild flavored catfish. I like to eat healthy but I might try frying it next time...or at least baking it off the surface of the sheet pan so it doesn't get soggy.

I should have spent more time looking at other people's reviews before cooking.  15 minutes at 350 was not nearly enough time to cook thought the catfish.  I did add breadcrumbs instead of some flour though and that added a great crunch.

This was soooo good and so easy.  I did substitute the flour with bread crumbs and the catfish with tilapia since it was what I had on hand.  And I only used 1/8 c. of butter to decrease the fat.  The last 3 minutes I broiled it to give it a crunchy exterior and it was awesome!

As long as you leave it in the oven a little longer until it's a little crusty it will come out great!
A side of angel hair with a parmesan sauce is excellent to pair with this.
No one has ever NOT liked this!

I did not enjoy this dish.  We followed the recipe to the letter except for the butter, because my husband and I are trying to eat more healthy, and we thought more fish, baked or grilled, would be the best way to go.  the fish was soggy and didn't get crisp.  My husband said he might take the leftovers and try pan-frying them.

I love this recipe and use it over and over again.  I followed the recipe to a "T" the first time, but put it under the broiler (even then) to create a nice crust, which was needed before i would serve it. It seemed like the cook time was way off as i had to leave the fish in for almost an hour - this could be because i had larger fillets or maybe an uneven oven?  I've come to the point where I use less flour and more cheese and spices to make it more crusty and less doughy. I still love it and never fails to impress!  Tonight, I will adapt the recipe with some catfish nuggets I scored.  Can't wait!

Followed the basic premise of the recipe but with the following modifications: used 1/2 cup cornmeal and 1/2 cup breadcrumbs in place of flour, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp ancho pepper (penzeys), broiled for 10 mins, flipped for 5 and flipped again for 2 to make both sides crunchy. Would probably go 5, 5, 5 in the future. Would make it again.

This recipe has been changed so much, it doesn't seem like the original at all.
I used catfish nuggets, dispensed with the egg, milk and melted butter.
Used butter-flavored Pam on a cookie sheet.
Sprinkled the fish with seasoned salt, let it sit about 15 min.
Used 2 parts Italian bread crumbs, 1 part Parmesan cheese and a little more seasoned salt & garlic powder for the coating.
Increased oven temp to 375° and baked for 25 min. 
No mushy fish; it was crisp and delicious!
I will definitly be making this again.

My husband and I have agreed to try this recipe again. The first attempt was far too salty. We're going to try it without any salt, and perhaps a little bit less Parmesan Cheese. The combo of cheese and salt was too much, but after a few minor adjustments it definitely deserves a second chance.

Good flavor and a nice compliment to the catfish.  Easy to make.  I will say that the breading could easily be cut back by at least a 1/4C each as there was much left over.  I used catfish nuggets, which take up more breading that same weight of filets.  Next time would definitely cut back.  Baked the fish in a low-sided pan vs. the 13x9 and still had to broil for a few mintues to crisp up a bit.  With just a couple tweaks, this was a good recipe.

My family doesn't ordinarily like fish with a cheese, but the loved this.  Just be careful not to overcook, because it will get a little mushy...

The taste lacked consistency, proper flavor, and was a bit bland.  Take care in the type of catfish you choose to use.  Fresh is always best.

The flavor was okay, but the texture was horrible: mushy and slimy.  I gave it two stars because I was able to eat it, but not enjoy it.

I cut back the 1.25 cups of flour to 3/4 cups and I still had a lot of extra flour and cheese left over.  I would recommend cutting down the cheese by half and the flour by half.  After it comes out of the oven, I'll advise how it tastes.

followed the advice of others and used flavored bread crumbs instead of flour.I used skim milk and did not put any butter on.
I used tilapia filets. Cooked for 15 minutes and broiled for 5 minutes. came out perfectly moist.

My three year old daughter and family loved this recipe.  I also omitted the flour and used bread crumbs.  I also added minced garlic to the milk/egg mixture.  I found it a bit greasy so next time I will cut down on the butter.  It cooked perfectly in 15 minutes then crisped up under the broiler for about 3 minutes.  Will definetly make again.

My husband LOVED this dish!  I haven't had that much experience cooking fish but thanks to this recipe and the other reviewers' suggestions I really impressed my family.  I followed the advice of using breadcrumbs instead of the flour, a little less salt and I used cayenne pepper to add a little kick.  The nice thing about this recipe was it allowed me to make each of the fillets with a different degree of "hotness".  I made the kids' fillet first with just a dash of cayenne pepper, then added a little more into the dredge mix for mine and finally for my husbands' fillet I added even more.  This recipe is a keeper.

I needed a recipe for some snapper that we had frozen. This was AWESOME, even on defrosted fish. So crispy and cheesy. It could probably use a little bit more zip, so I'd probably add some of my favourite spices next time. 

Great recipe, though!

This deserves more than 5 stars!! YUM! I used Panko (Japanese breadcrumbs) instead of flour, and lots of Tony's Creole seasoning instead of spices (but added blk pepper)..and it was AWESOME! I'm not much of a seafood person, but this is great! I'll be making this over and over again.

I accidently bought catfish at Costco instead of flounder.  I had never tried catfish and was worried it might taste "fishy".  It doesn't at all.  My husband even said to me "There's nothing wrong with catfish, this is delicious."  I love how nice and golden brown the fish gets after just 15 minutes.

This was good, but a little bland. I added a little bit of shredded monterey jack cheese to the top of the fish about 5 minutes before it was done. I think that gave it a little bit more flavor.

We think the butter over the top at the end made it a bit soggy. If we leave that off next time it will be perfect! (To me at least, DH thinks it should be fried!)

I agree with the other reviewers, this is very bland and has way too much flour.  Did not enhance the flavor of the fish at all!  It would need a lot of doctoring-up for me to try it again.

We didn't like at all.  Too much coating for the amount of catfish called for.  Had to bake longer than the time given & didn't turn golden brown.

This was great - next time I will not drizzle as much butter over it but other than that it was definitely a hit!

I still made this recipe without the paprika, milk or flour and it still turned out very well! I'm a beginner with the cooking so it's not hard to make at all. My boyfriend loved it too!

We weren't big fans. The flour was a little overwhelming and didn't all soak in, and there was a little too much pepper. Maybe fresh catfish would have helped (in the landlocked Midwest, you have to take what seafood you can get), but I won't be making this again.

Great recipe.  I substituted 3/4 Italian breadcrumbs, for some of the flour.  I also baked for 30 mins to make fish crispier.

Agree with some of the other reviewers - went by the recipe and it was just too soggy - didn't seem to cook thoroughly either. Put it back into the oven several times to cook longer because it wasn't done.

We were disappointed. It turned out mushy and didn't get golden brown. The kids liked the fish but not the breading.  The dog didn't even like the breading. Perhaps broiling and using bread crumbs might help it.

This is a good recipe for people like me who aren't especially crazy about fish - the catfish had a very mild flavor, and pretty much all I could taste was the Parmesan. Mine was ready in about 10 mins; it would have got mushy if I'd left it any longer. Thanks for a quick, easy and tasty recipe, Deborah!

This was so easy, and very good.  I used cod fillets.  Excellent.  Only need about half of the bread crumb/parmesan mixture.  Will definitely make this one again - with all types of fish.

The first time I made this, the breading and fish came out the oven completely mushy. I made a few modifications and it turned out much better, so I changed my review to 4 stars. The key changes were that I made sure to blot the fillets dry with paper towels before breading, and I baked for 30 minutes at 375 degrees. These had a great flavor and the breading turned out nice and crispy!

This was a nice, quick and tasty recipe.  I found the seasoning a little bit bland, I would add some garlic next time and use freshly ground pepper.  I cooked it 15 minutes only, then another 4 minutes under the broiler and it was perfectly cooked.  I also found it a little bit greasy - next time I will try and cut down on the margarine, and perhaps serve with lemon to cut the grease.

Loved it! I read all the reviews beforehand, and made some alterations accordingly. I, too, used bread crumbs instead of flour. I also turned the boiler on for 5 mins at the end to crispen it up. Everybody in the family loved it! The combination of ingredients (especially the drizzled butter) reminded me of something I've tasted before in a restaurant!  thanks.

This was just okay to us - we had to cook it twice as long as the recipe called for and the coating still wasn't very crisp.  You need to follow the other reviewer's advice and add extra spices.

This recipe as is...is not quite up to par...It was a little bland. However, once I added more salt, some black pepper, Tony Chachere seasoning, and some garlic....it was the best fish I have put in my mouth...you should try this recipe, but add spices to your taste....

My husband and I both like this dish, we have had it many times.  I usually don't have as much fish as this calls for, so I don't make as much of the dredge.  I also try to use as little margarine as possible to keep the fat content lower and make it less soggy. It seems to work!

I'm the kind of person that believes the word "good" and "fish" should never be used together, BUT this was pretty good and the fish lovers in the family thought it was great!  I replaced all the seasonings with a generous amount of cajun spice.  Will definitely make again.

Really good! I took others suggestions and after baking, broiled it for a few minutes to crisp the top. My husband, who doesn't really like fish, LOVED it! I imagine the breading would work for other types of fish too.

I am a novice cheif and this simple receipe made me look like a pro.  I chose this receipe to cook as a first meal for my boyfriend, who is not a big fan of fish.  Needless to say, he loved the fish.  I did alter the receipe according to SASSYSTARR suggestion. Also instead of Catfish I used Tapalia.  Next time I will try it with Catfish though.

i used some suggestions and made some changes on my own to add more flavor - i used cornmeal instead of flour, cajun spice instead of paprika, and broiled the fish for 5 minutes at the end with cheddar cheese on it. my husband absolutely loved it and both kids asked for seconds. i was still a little bit uncertain about catfish with cheese, but i will make this again for sure.

I'm not a big fan of catfish, but this was good.  I took some advice from other reviewers and added some garlic powder and seasoned salt to the flour.  Next time I will use less flour, but it was still good.  A few minutes under the broiler made it nice and crisp.

This was a great recipe. Instead of grated parmesean, I used a mixture of shredded cheeses and it turned out great. This recipe gave me a new appreciation for catfish.

It had a "ok" flavor, but it was a little soggy.  I found it firmed up somewhat after resting for 15-20 mins.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't a winner in our house either. It needs something, I may try it again and tweek the recipe to suit our tastes.

I used a light coating of the flour mixture.  The fish was incredibly tender and wonderful.  My picky 4-year-old even asked for a second helping...which my husband had already claimed for himself...and didn't want to share.  This is what my dad calls a "do-over".  It was so good, that we will do it over and over and over.

The only change I made to this recipe was to throw it on the grill!  I have a perforated metal pizza pan that is now dedicated to the grill and is great for stuff that might fall through the rack.  It didn't get crispy on top, so when it was done, I put it under the broiler for a couple of minutes... was PERFECT!  Served it with California Cole Slaw submitted by Alex for a WONDERFUL dinner in 90 degree Seattle weather!

I made this 2x, I doubled the milk and eggs, I also salted more and flipped the fish half way through so it doesn't stick and it's browned on both sides.

I agree with previous reviewers, after baking, I put it under the broiler.  To offset the blandness, I just sprinkled on McCormick's "Garlic and Pepper grinder" and a small sprinkle of McCormick "Perfect Pinch, Salt Free, Saucy Lemon spice".  It gave an extra dimension to the flavor.

Due to our family's taste preferences we halved the pepper.  We also used Hungarian paprika (a nice mild version).  My husband absolutely loved it.  I thought it was pretty good.  I might add more cheese & butter next time.

My Grandson (7) and I were looking to have something different for dinner while at the grocery store. He choose catfish at the meat and seafood counter. I was hesitant at his choice. We searched the recipes and decided on this one. This is one of the quickest, easiest and delicious recipes I've made. My Grandson did most of the work! It was a fun and  easy experience for him. I too substituted breadcrumbs for the floor. Only had Italian breadcrumbs but they worked just fine. Added cayenne pepper and black pepper. I used only a dash of salt. I hardly poured on any butter, less than half, it looked like it would have made the fish soggy to add more. I baked it in the oven at 375 for about 35 minutes, then put it in the broiler for another 5 minutes for crispiness (baking time will vary based on the thickness of your fillets). Based on reviews, I adjusted the recipe so there would not be a lot of the mixture left over since we were only doing three fillets. Chief Grandpa would have been proud of our success.

I am just getting into cooking and loved this recipe. Was so very easy and my 20 month old ate it up!! Which is a feat in itself to get him to try something new, let alone fish! I might have made mine too dry but it needed a sauce or something to moisten it up.
