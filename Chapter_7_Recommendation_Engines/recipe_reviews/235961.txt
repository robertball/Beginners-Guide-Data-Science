These were great!  I fried mine in regular oil and certainly added everything "to taste."  I also used egg roll wrappers that I cut in fours - cheaper this way.  My whole family loved them and they were easy to make.

Followed everything except I baked them instead until they were golden brown and they came out amazing. Highly recommend.

If you are looking forward to Chinese restaurant tasting Rangoon these are not it. We followed the recipe exactly and all you could taste was paprika and cream cheese. They turned out beautiful but the flavor is just not there.
