LOVE this jam! This is the best recipe for beginner canners! Change the servings to 135 US and you'll get 8 (8oz) jars or 4 (16 oz) jars. The jam is sweet, spreadable, and easy to make. I'm a beginner with canning and this was my first recipe, it was easy and foolproof. Enjoy!

Good consistency.  Make sure and reach the hard boil.  It's perfectly okay to mash berries all at once.  This was sweet enough because our berries were sweet. If not, I would have needed another 1/3 cup of sugar.  If you do this, premix the 1/3 cup with the pectin, adding before the first boil.  It's very important to follow directions closely for jam to set properly, so don't deviate if it is your first time to make it.

Absolutely perfect. The berries and sugar ratio was a little sweet but you come to expect that from most berry jams. Simple enough that my oldest boy and I could make this together--the directions were explained very well. He was quite pleased with himself. This strawberry jam recipe reminds me so much of Grandma it hurts, but it's a bittersweet hurt.

I have made this time and time again first time exactly as recipe states and it was very very good. We have been slowly decreasing the sugar until we find what the minimum amount would be to our satisfaction. This was my first attempt at jam and it never sits long enough for me to worry about it expiring...

This is such a simple recipe that my seven year old could make it!(with help from me at points of course!) Tastes so good that my oldest couldn't tell it wasn't store bought. Will definitely keep this one.

This is a wonderful basic recipe for strawberry jam.  It is very sweet but delicious.  I will try using less sugar next time.  I increased the recipe to yield 8 8oz. jars and added 2 tablespoons of lemon juice.  I also made the necessary adjustment for high altitude during the boiling water bath process since I live in Albuquerque, NM.  I increased the processing time by 10 minutes for a total of 20 min.  Be sure to let your completed jars sit undisturbed for at least 24 hours.

So easy and a lot of fun to do as a family.  We had to decrease the sugar by almost half though.

Fresh strawberries from our garden! I never made jellies, jams.
This was super easy!
I didn't "jar" them. It was a small batch. I'll keep a jar for us and share the other. 
When we get more strawberries in the garden I will start the canning process w this recipe!
Thanks! And English muffin in am has a whole new Life!!!

I cut it down to 1 cup of sugar per 1.3 cups of strawberries, I will cut it down again.  Was very good but still plenty of sugar.

I'm having a hard time. The sugar/berry ratio seems to work well, but the jam won't harden or firm up. I have cooked it twice and even added more pectin. I cooked it down to half the amount of jars, the second time? It still won't firm up. What am I doing wrong?
