This was a good recipe. I added chopped onion,red bell pepper and garlic to the turkey while browning. Instead of white sugar,I used brown.A little less ketchup,was replaced with BBQ and worchestershire sauce and a few grinds of black pepper .This was quick and super easy.I'll make this again,for sure!

Family loved it! Easy to make, too! I changed a few things: 1) I used 1 tbsp Splenda 2) I used apple cider vinegar, 3) While browning meat, I added 2 tsp minced garlic & 1/2 of a chopped onion.

FANTASTIC!!!! Best sloppy joes recipe yet!  Love using the turkey for fat and calorie savings. My kids loved them and I have a daughter that is terribly picky! I also used apple cider vinegar, onion powder and garlic powder and omitted the sugar. There was plenty of tange and sweetness in the Heinz ketchup that sugar was not needed. This will be a regular supper at my house!!!

this recipe was way to sweet....gave me a stomach ache....tastes like you are eating a hot dog with ketchup and mustard and lots of sugar!!! In order for this to taste better I would suggest adding some spices, onions, and some veggies!!!

definitely add the onion (I used a whole one) and the dashes of worchestershire. also, i did not use sugar and it was very sweet with a combo of agave nectar-sweetened organic ketchup and regular hines (we had just enough for one cup when we combined the last of the two!). i used ground turkey. yum!

Good! Replaced brown sugar for white sugar, added BBQ sauce and Worcestershire sauce along with the ketchup (to equal 1 cup), and used apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar.

Jon said these were the best Sloppy Joe's he's ever had! Take that Manwich!

This one is a keeper...and my family of 6 agreed.  We all love sloppy joes, but the canned types all contain onions-and we are no fans of that allium!  Everyone asked for this one again!  I did follow the advice of others, and cut out the sugar completely...super delicious and easy!

This recipe is awesome. My boyfriend hadn't ever tried sloppy joes before this recipe and now he's hooked. I took the advice of some of the other reviews. The adjustments that I made: 1) 1 tsp of brown sugar, 2) 1 tsp of apple cider vinegar, 3) 1 cup of Heinz ketchup and 4) 1 cup of tomato paste. Usually I used ground turkey, but in this case I used a pound of chuck ground beef.

my husband and i loved this!  does not serve 6 - the two of us finished the whole batch.  the directions should have said to reduce the heat to simmer after adding the meat - then continue to stir for 30 minutes -thats what i did and it was wonderful. p.s. - i used ground sirloin.

These are good and easy. A little strong on the yellow mustard flavor, but hubby liked it a lot! I like that they're made with turkey. It's still very meaty, but not greasy like ground beef would be.

This is a great basic recipe. I sauteed garlic & bell pepper with the turkey(I would have used onion had I had any on hand. :-P). In the sauce, I also threw in about a tsp of crushed red pepper to add some zing.

Well, one of my 3 kids ate it, one sampled it here and there, and one had to be forced through tears to take the mandatory three bites.  Hubby and I liked it OK.  We served it with homemade bread, baked tater tots, and some celery to make the plate not completely beige/bland.  
I used apple cider vinegar, and just slightly less sugar than called for; and we didn't have any yellow mustard (I know, what?!?), so we used deli brown.  I found this to be overwhelmingly vinegary.  I will try it again, with less vinegar, and will get some yellow mustard.  All that said, I was pleased to actually "cook" - no microwave, no cans - for me, a decent dinner!

Would have liked a little more sauce, more of a sweet and sour mix but everyone enjoyed and kids did not notice the ground turkey.

I went with the review ideas and added some worchestire sauce, bbq sauce, touch of paprika, and brown sugar. I also added some hot sauce for a little more kick. This recipe was good, but needed lots of work. Probably won't make it again because it takes to much experimenting with the sauce.

Awesome! My family loved this.  I even made a separate batch for my veggie "meat."  So easy and so much better than the recipe I used to use.  The only thing I did differently was switch to brown sugar and add some garlic to the meat.  I also didn't cook it for very long.  Once the meat was cooked and I added it to the sauce, I only kept it in there long enough to mix the two.  My husband was stoked when he got home!

These were delicious!!!  My daughter HATES sloppy joes, but I told her she had to at least try these. She LOVED them!  She told me I could make them anytime, and that in itself makes this recipe worthy of 5 stars!!!

These have such a sickeningly sweet, bland flavor that no one would eat them. There was no zestiness at all, and tasted like eating straight ketchup. 

If you want something that has a zesty taste, stick with recipes that include garlic, onion, and chili powder with a tomato sauce base.

It was too strong. I had to tinker with it quite a bit before I served it and even then the vinegar taste was  very strong (and I love vinegar!).

Delicious!! My mom even asked for the recipe. I've prepared this twice now with turkey and then hamburger both times turned out great! My only note is that when I made it with hamburger I was making it for a larger group so quadrupled the recipe, I did find that you don't need as much vinegar and mustard it made it a little to tangy.  I would reduce that by a teaspoon or more if you are extending beyond the original recipe. I tasted as I went to find the right flavor after doubling.

Great, simple recipe my whole family enjoyed!  One that is likely to become an old standby in our family especially since the ingredients are so easy to have around. :-)

Yummy!  Added garlic, ground pepper, worcestershire sauce & an onion to the turkey. 
I used apple cider vinegar instead and added BBQ sauces. Quick, easy & delish!

A bit too sweet.  I recommend reducing the amount of sugar since ketchup already has sugar in it.  I agree with the other poster who said these taste like hotdogs.

These were sooo good!  I took some of the other suggestions and browned the turkey with some onion and red bell pepper.  I also browned it in 3 tablespoons of butter.  I also switched up the sauce and only used 1/2 cup of ketchup and replaced the 1/2 cup with BBQ sauce and a couple of dashes of Worcester sauce.  I also substituted the white sugar for brown sugar.  These turned out AMAZING!  They have been added to my weekday menu meal plan!

We just finished eating and my husband said, "this is the best thing I have ever eaten!" He is picky so this is a big compliment. I used hamburger, sugar, brown sugar, ketchup, honey mustard, vinegar, & onion.

This was a fantastic recipe! I just made it in less than 45 minutes and my 22 year old brother devoured it in a matter of seconds. I substituted rice wine vinegar for white vinegar because we didn't have it. Next time I'll probably try throwing in some veggies.. Thanks for the post!

Sorry, didn't taste too good to me.  I usually use tomato paste in sloppy joes so maybe thats why it just didn't taste right to me.  It needed some help, so I added worchestershire sauce, a chopped onion, chili powder, paprika, garlic, salt and pepper.

This was decent, nothing special. I did use ground chicken, I didn't have any beef around. Best part was that it was quick and easy and didn't taste half bad.

Great recipe as is. Definitely simmer on low for the 30 minutes, comes out sweet and tangy! I don't ordinarily like sloppy joes but I'm keeping this one since my boyfriend does. He had FOUR of these tonight!

Great and easy recipe! My husband always raved about the Sloppy Joe's at a local race track and this one is as close as I've made. I saute onions and then continued cooking them with the meat ,add some red pepper flakes and I omit the sugar as it's too sweet for hubby. Other than that, I made it per the recipe.

No onions, as per my four year old grandson, whom has decided that, this week, they are "yucky, Nana"- still turned out pretty good. Added ketchup to Trevor's, as he has to "dip" everything- all in all turned out well and the grandson wanted more. That is how I gauge success. Merry Christmas to all!

This recipe is easy and pretty tasty. I added a small yellow onion diced. It is a little on the sweet side, so next time, I will use less sugar and add 1/2 a dice bell pepper.

This is the same recipe I have using for years. But recently I add a teaspoon of cinnamon. You don't really taste it, but it really makes it YUM!

I have used a similar recipe for literally 50 years.  
My kids always loved it. only changes are for each pound of ground meat, beef or turkey, usr 1/2 cup of catsup, 2 T each of sugar, mustard and Worcestershire sauce. Brown meat, drain, add other ingredients and simmer 15 minutes. Quick, easy and delicious. I hate to change a posted recipe, but sorry, it's really good.

Personally, I'm not a big fan of these turkey sloppy joes. It was dry and pretty tasteless. Even though it's not going the healthy route, I think I'll stick with Manwich.

This was good, I subbed Johnsonville ground sausage for the beef. I mixed the sauce in a bowl so I could give a honest review of it. I felt it to be slightly lacking in flavor. I only added sugar to taste which was about 2tsp. There is no way I would add 2tbps to this recipe it would be way to sweet so I recommend putting 2tbsp in a small bowl then adding 1tsp at a time till you like the sweetness level. I did realize a little to late I only have red wine vinegar I do think that added to the flavor. I also added some onion when browning the meat. when mixed all together and simmered for 30 min it had lots of flavor and had te family coming back for seconds. I had to keep a eye on the sauce and add a tbsp. at a time during the simmer to keep sauce thickness how we like it. I added a total of 1/4c water to get a sauce consistency that was not overly thick.

This was a good recipe. I added chopped onion,red bell pepper and garlic to the turkey while browning. Instead of white sugar,I used brown.A little less ketchup,was replaced with BBQ and worchestershire sauce and a few grinds of black pepper .This was quick and super easy.I'll make this again,for sure!

I started cooking this recipe and half way through I realized I ran out of Vinigar, so I had to substitute... and quick! I instead added 2T Sweet Baby Rays Honey BBQ and some garlic powder (I add Garlic to just about everything). Though this may have completely changed the taste (unknown due to unable to try the original recipe), it still tasted great! My 5 year old picky eater ate another helping! This recipe is also a great base to get creative!

Thought it was delicious and my kids loved it.  I, too, added onions and chopped yellow pepper as well as some garlic powder to the mix.  Omitted the sugar and it was plenty sweet.  Will certainly put this in the family rotation.

I made the sauce for this before I starting browning my ground bison - so I could tweak it - if needed.  The desired sweetness of a sauce varies for every individual - but for us - I added an extra tablespoon of white sugar and a tablespoon of light corn syrup.  I substituted a little Wostershire sauce in place of the vinegar.  I also sauteed one small onion and one medium red pepper and added to my bison.  I will never use any other recipe listed with lots more spices/ingredients - this one is simple and perfect!  Anyone can adjust the sweetness or acidity to their taste very quickly!  Thanks a bunch!

tasty. maybe a little too much mustard for my taste though. I also added garlic/onion/red bell pepper. I did reduce the sugar to about 1/2 the amount specified.  Without the sugar, it tasted pretty sour. It probably depends on the brand of ketchup used.

This is a great recipe -- and very easy to make.  Recently, we felt like barbecue but didn't have time to grill out.  The result was a twist on Momma's Slopy Joes we called, "Smokey Joes".  

By the time we finished our "modifications", though the only thing our version and the original have in common is the turkey.  We used spicey brown mustard instead of yellow, added onions and bellpeppers and a teaspoon of liquid smoke.  Our version also included a quarter cup of chili sauce.  Either version would be great with beef as well.

I tweaked the recipe just a little bit to add some veggies and make it a little bit more rounded. I finely chopped a green pepper and 3 fresh banana peppers to add in. They were a hit with the hubby and the mother and step father in law, not to mention our picky 19 month old!

This is so easy and yummy.  I finely grate a zucchini and carrot into the meat and cook.  Then I add the spices.  This is so flavorful that my family does not realize that there are veggies in it too.

Pretty good! I might experiment w/ it a little next time (more seasonings, flavor, etc.)  but overall it was pretty yummy as is. I don't usually eat sloppy joes and I was actually going to make them w/ ground beef for my husband and kids but tried this recipe instead. Everyone seemed to like it.

excellent recipe. I did not add the sugar - the katsup has so much already! Also, I added a whole onion (chopped), Worcestershire sauce, and garlic (minced). Finally, I watered it down a bit with 1/2 cup water and 1 cup V8 tomato juice and let it simmer back down.

My family thought this was delicious!!  It is a bit sweet, but you can always reduce the sugar amount.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Very good, I needed a recipe for a BBQ, the only thing I would change is to add some plain BBQ sauce into the mixture.

The sloppy joe's were good, but very dry.  The recipe needs more wet ingredients, especially if it is in a saucepan for another 30 minutes.  I stirred it pretty often, but it came out very dry.  I may try it again, but with more ketchup.
