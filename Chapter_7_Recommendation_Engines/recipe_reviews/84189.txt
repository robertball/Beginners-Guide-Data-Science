This recipe is great, but I do like my smoothie's cold.  Instead of 1 cup of OJ, do 1/3 cup orange concentrate with 2/3 cup ice and fill the ice cup up with cold water.  Mango's are a must for this recipe.  It's a totally different taste than strawberry's.  My husband suggested sprinkling cinnamon on the smoothie and the cinnamon made it awesome.  It gives it an awesome aroma when drinking it.

So add a little cinnamon and whip cream and it's a great smoothie!  this is great for babies too - the triple fruit smoothie w/ blueberries will keep you baby's regular. :-)

My family loves this smoothie!  I used 1/2 c. orange juice and 1/2 c. water to cut down on the sugar.  I didn't have vanilla yogurt, so I used plain yogurt with a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of honey.  This is a fantastic recipe and a great way to start the day!

Oh, was this good, tho' I confess I used homemade vanilla ice cream instead of yogurt.  Very tropical tasting and a pretty, pastel peachy color.  Frozen mango ensured this was good and cold!

Very nice smoothie. To make it more refreshing though, I used a frozen  banana (or you could use frozen mango cubes). I always toss my over ripe bananas in the freezer to have on hand for smoothies as a frosty quality always makes one so much more refreshing. I cut the recipe in half and it yielded two 8 oz smoothies.

I thought this tasted pretty good. I had all the ingredients but the mango and subbed some pineapple in juice. I don't think it is the recipe, I just prefer smoothies more cold and thickened with some frozen fruit instead of yogurt. A very good drink either way for getting in some vitamins and fiber in the morning. I did use my hand emulsion blender, to save time, and it worked well as there was no frozen fruit or ice to try to chop. Thanks

The color alone perked up the kids and put a smile on their faces.  For me, the smoothie wasn't cold enough and the vanilla yogurt was too dominant.  "As is" I give this recipe 4 stars but it quickly turns into a 5 star by adding crushed ice.  Thanks, MOTTSBELA.

We loved it.  I did use plain yogurt and didn't need to add any sugar (my banana was very ripe).  The smoothie was very good and we liked it, but after a couple of drinks my son suggested we add some cinnamon and that simply made the drink.  We just sprinkled a dash of cinnamon on top of each glass.

I have a child that is an absolute smoothie freak; he loves this recipe also. We switch out the mangoes with strawberries and add ice cubes. It's a hit! Thanks!

I cut the recipe in half and used 3/4 cup semi frozen mango. Because I like really cold smoothies, I also added 4 ice cubes. Very refreshing!

I loved this smoothie!  I added ice to thicken it because I used fresh mango, and it tastes tropical and delicious.  The banana flavor is a little too strong for my taste, so I think I might reduce the banana to 1/2 next time and either increase the mango or decrease the juice to compensate.

somehow, reading your description of the recipe this november 2010, I knew you were in seattle even before I read your location :D  this is a great recipe.  it was orange/pineapple juice I had on hand, and strawberry banana yogurt.. but omgosh, teamed with the mango what a bright ray on a cold slushy/rainy morning!  I'm not usually a big smoothie fan, but I wanted something fresh and zingy this morning.  and this delievered en force.  thank you.

I love nearly anything mango, so I had to try this smoothie. I made this with the following modifications: I didn't have vanilla yogurt so I used my plain, homemade yogurt with a dash of vanilla extract and some splenda. I only used half of the banana, because I just don't like the banana flavor that much. I used frozen mango. I also added a Tablespoon of soy protein powder.  The taste was good--slightly tart in a good way. However, I felt that the orange juice overpowered the mango. Perhaps it's because I used the Trop50 orange juice sweetened with stevia. I'll definately try this again and halve the amount of orange juice. I also plan to freeze my half banana in future, and maybe toss in a few ice cubes, because I like my smoothies really cold.   A great breakfast on the run!

it's pretty good and easy to make, however, the orange juice seemed to give it some sourness, so I made it with milk instead the second time. Tastes pretty good, but have to have it fresh, because it curdles the next day!

I also didn't have any mango so I used raspberries instead. I also substituted plain yogurt with a dash of vanilla extract and honey in place of the vanilla yogurt. It made a delightfully tart smoothie - I loved it.

Very refreshing! To keep the smoothie nice and cold I put the banana in the freezer and when the mangos are ripe enough I put those in the fridge. I used raspberry yoghurt. Very good.

Very good. Both my 11yr old and myself thought it was heavenly!  I only had plain non-fat Greek yogurt, so I added just a bit of vanilla extract and less than a Tsp. of honey. I also used frozen mango because that's what I had on hand.

I agree with the commenter who likes smoothies cold, and with the commenter who likes them like milkshakes. I used 1/2 cup frozen organic orange juice concentrate and four ice cubes. I used the fresh mango chunks in a semi-freddo state. To the commenter who thought it bland, I added a tablespoon of wildflower honey, a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice, a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice blend, and a half tsp. of ground ginger. It is fantastic. Oh, to the commenter who uses less orange juice "to cut down on the sugar", if you're buying orange juice with added sugar, then you need to be buying better orange juice. There's no excuse these days for any mfr'r to be adding sugar to orange juice. The real trick is to buy non-pasteurized OJ, the heat kills the nutrients and any that are in there are usually added as supplements.

Very yummy! I used frozen mango pieces and it made it just a bit chilled without being too cold for my 21 month old. We all loved it. :) I put cinnamon on mine. Yum.

Delicious!!  I used fresh clementine juice and it was fabulous!  Will definitely be making again.  (Will probably try frozen mango chunks next time too to make it a quicker and easier smoothie and hope it's still as tasty. :)

This is a great quick and simple smoothie. The taste is like a little kick of sunshine. I like to add a hand full of ice cudes and whey protien. My husband loves this smoothie for breakfast and for snacks.

Very easy and straightforward. I liked it a lot! However, it was only deemed 'interesting' by another member of the household, so who knows. Next time I'll be using either the mango or banana frozen as others suggest. But there will definitely be a next time!

Soooo good! I just made it and I love it! I didn't use any sugar because I feel like I'm getting enough of that from the juice, mango and the banana. It's a little tart but I love it! I also followed what Vicki2 did. I like my drinks  cold too and since it's warmer, this is so perfect. This would be great on a rainy day when I'm inside, snuggled up and watching netflix too. Awesome recipe!

I just started a smoothie diet last week and this is in ny top 3 favorites. The only problem I have with it - and it is a BIG one, seeing I am counting calories - is the calories this recipe claims to have is waaayy off. If you add the yogurt and oj together,it is more than the 150 calories it claims to have. It still is great, but not necessarily for those on a diet!

I messed with the recipe.  1 mango, 1 c. Orange juice, 1/2 c Greek yogurt.  Son loves it.  I think I might go w half the oj or double the mango so the mango flavor is stronger.

Made this with my daughter on a boring rainy Saturday!  She approved and said it tasted almost like jamba juice mango go go.  
I used a little vanilla ice cream instead of yogurt and trader joe's frozen mango.
Will definitely make it again and will try the yogurt instead.

This was good - the reason for 3 stars is because for me the banana and OJ overwhelmed the mango flavor I was hoping for. I used frozen mango, frozen banana and plain yogurt. Next time I will use fresh mango and an orange instead of OJ!

I was going to submit this recipe and decided to check for it before I cleverly submitted the same recipe. I "invented" the same smoothie in my kitchen not so long ago and we LOVE it. We always use frozen mango and I add flax seed oil for added health benefit. YUM.

This combination is sooo good.  The only thing I did differently was to put a whole peeled orange in the blender instead of orange juice because the fresh orange juice is so much more nutritious and flavorful than oj from the store.

My daughter had to bring in a smoothie for a world geography class project, and she loved this!! It is easy to make (good for school projects, or outside) and was completely delicious!!!

This is YUMMY! I added a spoonful of soy protein powder (unflavored) and a handful of baby spinach leaves (can't even taste them). A great meal replacement! I made it in my new HealthMaster blender - it kicks butt!

Made these on a hot summer day for my kids and a neighbor girl(who doesn't even like bananas).  They devoured it.  Such an easy, low-fat healthy treat!!!  Thanks.

Love, love love this smoothie!  My kids were crazy for it and even my husband, who doesn't like smoothies, enjoyed it.  Really recommend the cinnamon like someone else said.

I didn't like it very much, but can't quite put my finger on what went wrong. Maybe I'm not a smoothies person, I don't know... I didn't find it had much flavour, which is weird, since other people suggested it was too sour - to me it was too mild and neutral! Anyway, thanks for sharing...

This was delicious! I used what I had on hand: pineapple juice instead of orange juice and plain yogurt instead of vanilla, and it came out with just the right amount of sweet and tart. The smoothie did need to be chilled in the fridge before enjoying.

I made this exactly as in the recipe, and I just really didn't like it. My husband thought it was pretty decent though. I think I didn't like the combination of mango and banana. Might be better with berry or something.

This was so delicious and easy to make.  I had only a small banana, so I added about 5 strawberries, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Yum!  This will be a great snack for my kids - and me too!

I used frozen mangos as that's what got me looking for a recipe in the first place. I also used orange/mango juice as it's what I had in the freezer. And I only had blueberry yogurt so I used that. I think that the plain/vanilla yogurt would be better but my friend LOVED it as it was. All in all a good recipe.

I didn't have any yogurt when I made this, but I followed reviews and froze my Banana plus more to make up for it. Then when it came to mix I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and some ice. It came out great!

I made it! Awesome! My husband and I had the flu when I made this. This was loaded with vitamin c and of course probiotics. So, I looked at it as a medicinal smoothie. Lol!


I have acid reflux and orange juice is a trigger. I have to use Minute Maid low acid. Even with that, I can't drink more than a cup a day. So, splitting this smoothie worked out wonderfully.


Also, I added a half cup ice to the blender to make the smoothie a little colder.

Everyone loved it!  It's rather thick so I would add the mango (I used frozen), banana, and yogurt and then fill the blender half full with OJ so it's more of a smoothie  consistency.  We tried orange, peach, mango juice too and it was really good!

I'm not a fan of mangos but this tasted amazing. Used a pureed orange instead of orange juice and plain yogurt instead of vanilla. I'm certain to use this recipe more in the future.

Oh,  I have a similar one before I saw this recipe.  mango and banana together are totally cheerful. I add whole milk and ice cream or the Italian mango ice... less healthy..I guess.

I found that 1 whole bananna takes away the flavor of the mango. Next time I do this smoothie I'll try with just half a banana. I used Alphonso mangos.

Made this exactly as per the instructions, except I used a mix of 2% and 9% vanilla yogurt (kid leftovers :)

Very yummy, and just the thing to get a nice boost of fruit and remind me of the sun during a cold Canadian winter!

I made this but forgot the orange juice, and got it mixed up with another recipe and added a small bulb of ginger instead, but surprisingly it still came out delicious! I'll try it out the right way next time, but just thought I'd share that

This is so tasty! I did make a couple of changes though. I used 2 cups frozen mango in place of fresh since I like my smoothies frozen. I also didn't have vanilla yogurt so I replaced with plain nonfat greek yogurt! Soooooo good!

So simple, so good.  I added a teaspoon of coconut extract and it set it off nicely.  I used a frozen banana and the texture was so nice and... well, smooth.

This was my first time making homemade smoothies. It was so easy and delicious! I followed the recipe exact except I added a little honey per other reviews. Also I added some ice bcuz I wanted it really cold. Used frozen mangos not fresh bcuz its what I had. I really don't like bananas so this is a great way for me to get their nutrients. The mix of banana and mango tastes great. Also I used vanilla greek yogurt because it's what I had in the fridge.

I make this with frozen mango chunks that I get at the grocery store, much easier than peeling and putting a mango. I also use a frozen banana and plain Greek yogurt. The frozen fruit makes this very cold. It is a delicious smoothie and I love the name!

Amazing smoothie recipe that hit the spot. Added a cup of ice and used a frozen banana to get the coldness going. Just half a cup of plain yogurt worked well here. A touch of cinnamon for garnish adds nicely to it. This was a delicious and tangy treat!

1st attempt, slightly sour. 2nd attempt, used another brand of orange juice and it was better. So take note of the orange juice you use.

Very good, very versatile and simple recipe for a smoothie. Ripe mangos were not available to me so I used Simply Orange brand orange/mango juice blend. Fresh pineapple added is fantastic. If you prefer more protein you also boost it with a protein powder. Experiment with different flavored greek yogurts while you are at it. Possibilities for this recipe are endless.

Just tried this morning.  I altered just a little bit.  Hubby chopped the mango and banana up the night before and put it in the freezer then in the morning we combined the frozen fruits with the orange juice and yogurt.  I added a couple tablespoons of pea protein powder since I had this after my morning workout and we both thought it was great.

Liked it! I used plain yogurt and it was sweet enough for me. Will surely make again.

A wonderful way to begin any day. I use frozen mangoes, fresh squeezed OJ, the banana, vanilla yogurt and Splenda to sweeten. Yummy and healthy.

This is a very tasty treat! Quick and easy too! My family is not even a big fan of mango and we all really liked it. I didn't have vanilla yogurt so I used strawberry yogurt instead. Very tasty. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

So easy to make! I made this a few times..... I mixed everything together using a plastic freezer bag (I don't have a blender!); it made it more fun and left a bit of fruity chunks in it! It was great. I LOVE THIS RECIPE!

delicious.  i used frozen mango and plain yogurt w/ a a tsp of vanilla extract.  i like to blend and then taste before sweetening and im glad i did because the drink was sweet enough for me and my 21 month old.  we like tangy smoothies though.

I just now tried this recipe (drinking it now) and it tastes great! I used frozen mangos, frozen banana chunks, and pineapple orange juice from frozen concentrate since I had no regular orange juice on hand. Very sweet without need for adding sugar and I get lots of good fruit and yogurt. Thank you!

I didn't have yogurt, but it still tasted fine and prob got rid of some calories... I couldn't taste the mango so much since the OJ is a bit over powering... I also put ice in

This smoothie is so delicious and refreshing!! I followed the recipe and added a tray of ice cubes, it was absolutely perfect.  There was enough for me to sip on it for several hours.  This is a wonderful smoothie to have for breakfast, thanks!!

I love this smoothie, because it is so easy and tastes wonderful.  Yet, it is still healthy and low fat.  The flavor was still great even when I used peach yogurt.

This was good. I omitted the banana because I don't like them but it was still good. I didn't have vanilla yogurt but did add 1 tsp of vanilla. My husband and 19 mos. old son really liked it too! I might use a little less OJ next time because it was the tiniest bit tart for me but not for my husband.

I really don't make smoothies very often, but after I saw how easy this one was I had to try it.  This recipe is super easy, and super yummy!! I did substitute strawberries for the mangos since it's all that I had on hand.
