Black eyed peas may be good, but my Bahamian family uses pigeon peas.  Yum!

Good with lots of modifications. I used 8 oz of tomato sauce, 4 oz of tomato paste, 6 cups of chicken broth in substitution for water, orange bell pepper, 2 tsp of fresh thyme, a pinch of cayenne pepper and a 1/4 cup of grated parmesean cheese. Not sure how she got her measurements. If I had only used 4 cups of liquid it would have dried up and burned within minutes. Made at least 8 servings..

Very yummy way to make black eyed peas ! I actually cooked my grits first and did the sauce separate and drizzled it on top at the end ! I also added a little sugar to the sauce
