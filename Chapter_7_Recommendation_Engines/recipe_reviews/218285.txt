I've never had chili burgers before but made these for a neighborhood cookout. I only had hamburger buns, so I used those, but think they would probably taste the same. I don't really like canned chili, so I threw a pot together with Chili-O seasoning packet and it came out very good. I also added some Montreal Steak Seasoning to the ground beef, since I use that on just about everything and love the flavor. I offered the recipe with chili on the side, but almost everyone put the chili on their burger and raved about the taste. I might try this at some point in the future with sloppy joes as the topping. Great idea!

What a great idea! An easier and little less messy way to eat a chili cheeseburger. I made the burgers flat sticks shapes so they would fit the bun and not require cutting. I used Wolf brand chili because it's my hubs' favorite canned brand but any canned chili would be fine. I will definitely make these again.

My husband and I really enjoyed this. He omitted the pickles (personal preference) but otherwise we followed the recipe as is. It was messy but what food with chili isn't? We haven't had a chili cheese burger since Checkers left town, this was just as good and we didn't have to go anywhere!
