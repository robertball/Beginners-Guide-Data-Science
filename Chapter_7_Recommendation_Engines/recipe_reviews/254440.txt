Really delicious!   My changes: In a skillet I browned 5 slices thick bacon, cut into 1/2‚Äù dice, until crisp and then removed and set aside.  I poured off all but 1 Tbsp bacon fat and added 1 cup chopped sweet onion sprinkled with 1/2 tsp seasoned salt cooking until soft and then added 1 1/2 cups coleslaw mix and cooked until softened. I stirred the onion/coleslaw mixture into the mashed potatoes, mixing in 1/2 cup grated cheddar cheese and half the bacon.  After filling the potato shells, I topped each with extra cheese and bacon.

I should have trusted my instincts and cooked the bacon first THEN added the cabbage and onions. I ended up having to choose between undercooked bacon or burned cabbage.

Overall these were too rich for me, but still tasty.

This was an easy make ahead dish for Christmas Eve dinner; served with Prime Rib and Creamed Spinach.  I made these the evening prior and then heated in a 350 degree oven for 30 minutes while the roast rested.  I would definitely make these again.

This was really delicious and beautiful too!  I cooked the bacon first and then threw out the bacon fat.  I used olive oil to cook the cabbage and onions and then added the crumbled bacon bits with the milk and other ingredients.  I used only 2 Tbsp of butter.  I baked one half potato in the toaster oven for me tonight and the other three halves are in the refrigerator for later meals.  Yum!

I never would have expected cabbage in a baked potato, much less the added flavor & texture!  Of necessity, I subbed sausage for the bacon. Tasted great, and I suspect it was an improvement for the next-day leftovers, when soggy bacon might have detracted. Great recipe!  Certainly will make again.

This was very tasty even without the bacon (I needed to make mine low sodium).  I used purple cabbage because that's what I has from my local CSA so it was very colorful too.  I cook a lot but it was my first time making twice baked potatoes - it was easier than I thought.  Great recipe!

Excellent and 5 stars all the way! I had some already cooked bacon that I added to the top after these came out of the oven but other than that didn't make any changes. To make it easier on myself I bought a package of the coleslaw mix so that I didn't have to mess with chopping the cabbage. I was impressed with these and will make again.
