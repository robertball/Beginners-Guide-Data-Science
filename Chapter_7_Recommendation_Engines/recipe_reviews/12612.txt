This is a very simple and very yummy recipe. For those who found the pie too runny but don't want to go through the hassle of pre-cooking the rhubarb, try using a lattice top instead of the double crust called for in the recipe. It lets alot of the moisture out. Also, be sure to let the filling sit the whole 30 min before pouring into crust, and let the pie sit in the oven 15-20 min after baking (oven should be turned OFF) to let the excess fluids thicken. If you do all of those steps, the pie won't be runny, nor will it taste floury.

I've made this pie twice, first as written & the second time I made some changes. Using flour, the pie was runny & tasted like flour. So, the second time, I put the rhubarb in a large pot, added the sugar & 1/4 to 1/2 cup of water with 2 Tablespoons of corn starch dissolved in the water. I cooked it until it thickened. I removed the pot from the stove & added the raw strawberries.  I poured the mixture into the crust & dotted with butter.  It turned out much better with the cornstarch.  Not too much liquid & no flour taste. Also, I just brush the top crust with milk & sprinkle with some sugar & nutmeg.

This has the perfect proportion of sugar and flour! I used about 3 cups each of strawberries and chopped rhubarb. I put foil on the edges of the crust, baked at 425 for 15 min. , took off the foil, turned it down to 375 for 45 more min. With pies like this, you cannot just cut into them fresh from the oven, or they run all over the place. I made this at 9 at night, then cut into it the next day in the afternoon, no runniness at all. Yum!

Reading the reviews, most of them saying the pie was runny, I had my concerns about this but they were definitely unfounded. The pie is excellent.  And that means the recipe is excellent.  I didn't change a thing, nor will I in the future. I can only think that those who experienced a runny pie either cut into it before it was completely cooled, or didn't cook it long enough - when you see the juices bubble up through the vented crust, that's a pretty good indicator the pie is done.  I used "Basic Flaky Pie Crust," also from this site, and the result was simply a beautiful and delicious pie.

This was amazing! I went strawberry picking yesturday and made the pie today along with local fresh rhubarb. i changed the recipe by using 3 cups each of strawberries and rhubarb. i didn't use the flour but instead (as previously mentioned) mixed 1/4 cup of water with 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and let it sit with the berries, rhubarb and sugar for 30 minutes. i also baked the pie for 15 minutes at 425 and then 40 minutes at 375. we let the pie cool for about 3-4 hours and it's not runny at all!! this was so good that i'm making 2 more of these pies to give to my family and neighbor! also just a note - you don't need to cook the rhubarb before hand - you need to make sure it's chopped up (about 1/4 inch) and also if you notice the skin is a little tough, peel it a little bit. thanks so much for a recipe that i'll definitely use again and again!!

strawberry rhubarb pie is supposed to be runny--it is an all fruit filling.  What I found out however,is that if you wait 1 day after baking the pie, the juice inside seems to thicken a little bit. You could also use some tapioca to thicken the filling, but this only takes away from the natural flavor of the fruit filling.  Using a little bit more flour or substituting flour for cornstarch also makes the filling a bit thicker.

This could be a great recipe if you would have mention that one should cook the rhubarb 1st .........when the pie was done in the oven the rhubarb was not cooked and the pie was very sour that it needs more sugar.....I will try making this pie again in the future but with cooked rhubard and more sugar.......thank you for sharing this recipe with us...

This pie was really good. I've made many rhubarb pies and I've never soaked or cooked the rhubarb prior to putting it in. Either those of you who have the "crunchy rhubarb" problem have extremely tough rhubarb, or you're cutting it into chunks that are too big. I cut mine approx. 1/4" in width. I also agree with another person that this pie is a bit too sweet. Perhaps our rhubarb is not as bitter as others. It's all in the rhubarb I guess!

I added a cup of water to the rhubarb, strawberrys and sugar and cooked it on top the stove until the rhubarb was cooked up then put it in the pie shell. It was wonderful!! Just dont forget to put foil under your pie tin so it doesnt drip on the oven.

A lot of people have complained about this pie having too much liquid- I didn't have that problem at all.  I use 2.5 cups rhubarb and 3.5 cups of strawberries.  I toss them with the flour and sugar and let them sit for half an hour while I'm thawing my pie crusts.  Then I make a foil tent in my oven so the crusts don't burn.  I don't add any butter.  I bake it at 425 for 15 minutes, then 375 for 40 minutes.  After the timer has gone off for the second time, I remove the foil tent and continue baking until the pie is exactly the shade of golden that I'm after.  This usually takes only five minutes more.  This method might be a little fussy, but it results in a perfect pie.

Just like several reviewers, I too had a very runny pie.  I baked according to directions, the top was golden and looked perfect, but sooooo runny.  What I discovered though, was upon reheating in the microwave it seemed to firm up and was just the way it should be.  Delicious, warm, and covered with French vanilla ice cream.  Not a total loss, but next time I will bake longer with the crust protected with aluminum foil.

PERFECT PIE! I used fresh strawberries and frozen rhubarb.  I did not precook the rhubarb, or use cornstarch instead of flour as others have suggested. I used refrigerated pie crusts.  I did not thaw the rhubarb, I just rinsed it under water in a collander. I followed the recipe, let the filling mixture sit the required time while my pie crusts warmed up and my oven preheated.  I put foil around the edge of the pie to prevent the fluted edge from over browning, and removed it 10 minutes before the cooking time was up.  When the time was up, the crust still looked pale and a little doughy, (probably due to the cold rhubarb)so I left it in for 10 more minutes, after which it was perfectly browned and hot juices were bubbling out the top and running out onto my oven,(I highly suggest protecting your oven with foil when you bake this pie).  I intended to allow this pie to cool completly till the next morning to allow the juices to thicken before serving, but when I checked on the pie in the middle of the night (I was going to put it in the fridge) I found persons unknown had helped themselves to a few slices. I could see that the pie had been very runny and juicy when sliced, but that as it cooled it had thicked nicely.  I never did refrigerate it, it was eaten completly the next morning and was not runny at all, it served up perfectly.  It did not taste flour-y either, just perfect sweet-tart strawberry rhubarb deliciousness with a flaky crust.

Everyone I served this to loved it. I, too, halved the strawberries. I used a 1 lb. container. I looked up on another website and it said that 1 lb. of rhubarb is 3 cups, which for me was around 5 stalks, which I halved lengthwise and then chopped into 1/4-inch pieces.

Great recipe... A helpful hint to making the pie absolutely PERFECT.  Try spreading a thin layer of cream cheese on to the bottom of the pie crust before filling.  This gives the pie an awsome flavor and keeps the crust from getting soggy!

Excellent combination of such a tart vegetable and sweet fruit. The key is letting the rhubarb and strawberry mixture "marinate" in the sugar, to bring out some flavor. My guests raved, and I will definitely make it again.

Wow, this is phenomenal.  Used freshly picked, locally grown strawberries which were really juicy.  I added a couple tablespoons of tapioca which eliminated any concern over a runny filling.  I let it cool for about 3 hours, and it was absolutely perfect.  The combination of the tartness of the rhubarb and the sweetness of the strawberries produced one of the best pies I've ever had.*****UPDATE 6.4.19  I make t his pie annually, only once during rhubarb season, and this recipe  simply never lets me down.  It's my husband's favorite pie (well, second to apple, maybe).

I did everything exactly how the recipe was written and I came out with an extremly soggy pie! All juice! I have never cooked with rhubarb before, so it was a lesson learned, but I still would like to know how to do it right.

So glad to have a recipe to make at home!  I made my pie at night and didn't eat it until morning (literally, for breakfast!) and it wasn't at all runny.  I had mixed the filling and let it sit for 30 min before assembling my pie.  However, in my haste to add the top and cook it, I completely forgot to dot inside with butter.  Don't know how much flavor that adds, but it was really good without (and much lower in calories I'm sure!)  Used a full crust top with big vent holes, glazed with milk, sprinkled with sugar and nutmeg, covered the edges for 15 @ 425, then uncovered for 45 @ 375 and let sit in the oven once it was off for another 15 as suggested by others.  Very happy with this pie!

I just finished making this receipe, but I must say that I took Jennifer's suggestions of adding the corn starch. What I did was put the sugar, chopped rhubarb and strawberry's into a pot, then added the butter and slowly added the cornstarch mixture, which I used three tablespoons of cornstarch to a 1/4 cup of water and cooked it on high for just about two minutes until the cornstarch and butter made it thick, now it is just cooling down until I put it in the crust.  I like a little  bit of a sweet taste so I added a sprinkle or more of sugar and just a drop of lemon juice.  This is also the way I make my Apple Pies, on the stove top with the butter and cornstarch.  I also asked a Amish friend and she uses ThermFlo (a corn starch substitute) and her pies are great.  I also used the lard/butter pie crust from this site (Alan's).  I have no doubt that this pie will be fantastic.

I've been baking pies for over 20 years and this was the worst recipe ever.  I was extremely disappointed with the consistency of the rhubarb, which was undercooked and still crunchy, and the filling was a runny mess.  I ended up throwing out the entire thing.  If I were to ever try this recipe again (and that's a mighty big "if"), I would precook the rhubarb and drain it before adding it to the other filling ingredients.  But what's the point of using a recipe that doesn't provide decent instructions in the first place?  Highly annoying and not up to Allrecipe's usual standards.

This pie was wonderful.  Having never cooked with rhubarb before, I had to do some searching to find out how big to cut it, and the 1/2" slices I used were just the right texture when the pie was done.  I forgot to dot the top wtih butter before putting the top crust on, and the pie was still fantastic.

Wow! I served this at Easter Dinner and got so many compliments with this pie! One person said it was the best one they had tried since 20 years ago when they were 10! I added a little bit of cinnamon and nutmeg to the fruit mixture but I forgot to add the butter on top! (No one noticed!) It probably cooled for over an hour before eating it and it was perfect! Not runny at all, I couldnt believe I made something that came out so pretty! I served with Very Vanilla Whipped Cream. (2 c. whipping cream, 6 to 7 Tablespoons sugar and 1 Tbs vanilla. Whip in chilled bowl with chilled beaters until nice and whipped creamy! Everyone raved about this! Much better than the cool whip) Anyway, I was very pleased and a request has already been put in for Thanksgiving!

Wonderful pie! I used frozen whole strawberries and frozen rhubarb and let them thaw before making the filling. I followed the recipe except I baked it for 15 minutes at 425 then reduced the temperature to 375 and baked it for 40 minutes more. I didn't use the egg yolk and sugar on the top; didn't feel it was necessary. My husband loved it! I will definitely make this again and again.

This is so good!!!  Because I use fresh rhubarb from the garden, it is kind of hard to know what a pound is.  I used about 3 1/2 Cups chopped rhubarb.  This pie has such a nice texture.  The filling holds together without running all over the plate.  Everyone that I have served it to raves about it.  Thanks, Terri!

I made this as is except I sprinkled cinnamon and nutmeg over the filling before I put the top crust on and it was absolutely amazing! The filling was a perfect consistency (not too runny or too sticky) - don't panic if it's soupy when it first comes out of the oven. Mine thickened up perfectly after a few minutes. 35 minutes was the perfect baking time for it. Altogether a great recipe that I'll be using every year!

Absolutely perfect - I prepared and baked it exactly as instructed .  Just delicious and beautiful.  I did buy a Pillsbury pie crust because after 45 years of marriage I still cannot make a pie crust - and I've tried loads of recipes.

It seems to me that if you use more berries, the runnier the pie will be. The only reason it gets juicy at all is because of the berries. So, for those with runny issues, use less berries. Also, for those who don't have a kitchen scale, 1 lb of rhubarb is approximately 5 stalks.  Hope that helps!

After reading all the reviews, I just had to make another rhubarb-strawberry pie. I have allways cooked the rhubarb as thats how my aunt taught me back in the 50's. We had a large rhubarb patch and we just had plain rhubarb pie but oh so deslious. I made the rhubarb-strawberry pie as given. I didn't like it as to the flour taste and runny. I made another pie yesterday and I changed it to 1 1/4 cups sugar, 3 tbls of cornstarch dissolved in  a 1/4 cup plus 2 tbls of water. 3 cups of sliced strawberrys, 3 cups of sliced rhubarb and 1 cup of blueberries. I put the rhubarb in a pot, added the sugar and cornstarch mixture and brought to a low boil, reduce the heat and simmered until it thicken constantly stirring. 
I then removed it from the heat and added strawberries and blueberries and stired and let set for 30 minute and then poured in a 9" pie crust. I scattered small drops of butter over the top of the filling and then I shook a few shakers of ground cinnamon and put the top crust on. I then baked it for 45 minutes at 375*.
My wife made a lemon pie and needless to say all the guest requested the rhubarb-strawberry-blueberry pie. I was a proud baker after all the very postive comments. They all wanted my recipe.

Very easy, delicious recipe.  I would cut back on the sugar as it was a bit too sweet.  I only had one pint of strawberries...I sliced and refrigerated them overnight to dry out some of the juciness so the pie was not runny at all, and there were plenty of strawberries as I cut them each into four slices.  Also DO NOT COOK THE RHUBARB!  It will be a soggy runny mess, just slice it like you would a celery stalk...the thinner you slice it, the sweeter it will get with the sugar/flour mixture...if you cut it too thick, it will be very sour and possibly undercooked.

I used my summer frozen berries: 2 cups of rhubarb/ 2 cups of strawberries(and added fresh granny smith apples)  I heated the strawberries and rhubarb on the stove and then drained the syrup (saved for ice-cream).  Then I put them in a bowl and added the ingredients (sugar- reduced to 3/4c, flour, and butter) I layered the bottom of the pie with the apples and then spooned the strawberry and rhubarb mixture on it, finished it off with another layer of apples and covered the pie.  It was a hit and gone before the end of the night.

Many people thought it was runny but too floury tasting. I used 1/4 cup of flour and 2 tablespoons of tapioca. Make sure to cut the rhubarb small enough for it to cook through. If you do that, it really doesn't require any precooking. I also made sure to add a good portion of orange zest to the pie. It really isn't overpowering and adds a nice "citrusy" brightness to the pie.  I also cut down on the sugar, as some others mention. I think I used about 3/4 cup as opposed to the 1 cup. The pieces came out perfectly intact!

This makes a great pie!  I had been searching for some Rhubarb pie recipes to make for my husband who ate them growing up in Colorado.  After finding a place here in Louisiana that carried fresh rhubarb I decided to surprise him with some pies.  This came out so good.  I used approx. 2 cups of rhubarb and 2 cups of sliced strawberries and the pie was nice and full.  The pie came out perfect--not too sweet or too tart.  My husband just loved it and so did my family who had never had rhubarb before!  I've already bought some rhubarb to freeze so I can make this again!

I never made a strawberry/rhubarb pie before.  I picked fresh fruit this week, checked out recipes from Joy of Cooking, Better Crocker Cook Book, friends, etc. and decided on Terri's - an excellent choice.
I followed her recipe exactly, using 3 cups strawberries and 3 cups rhubarb (I think that is how the weight translated). I followed another reader's suggestion to let the pie sit in the cooling oven for 20 mins after baking time elapsed, then I set the pie on the counter until the next morning before cutting. Thank you, Terri.  This is a wonderful old fashioned recipe I will keep and share. 
See photos (my crust burned a little b/c my turntable stopped turning!).   Note: An oven temp might read 400 degrees, but in actuality it might be 360.  Invest in an oven thermometer.

We love this pie! I used 3 cups each of chopped fresh strawberries and  frozen rhubarb, followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out great. The only difference was an extra 5 or so minutes of baking at 400 F. No need to cover crust with foil, but definitely need an oven liner for the drips! Once it was done baking, I let it sit in the oven (turned off) for 15 minutes. We ate it 5 hours later and other than the bits of juice that's normal, it's wasn't runny at all. Thank you for sharing Terri - it's by husbands birthday pie 3 years counting.

Amazing! I followed the recipe exactly. I used frozen rhubarb and frozen strawberries. This was the first time I made a strawberry-rhubarb pie, and I was bringing it to a pie potluck. I was nervous, and got more nervous when people dished it out because apparently everyone LOVES strawberry-rhubarb pie. Someone actually said I won the "contest." I made no changes to the recipe, except for what Alessandra said and left it in the oven for 15mins. It was not runny at all. Thank you!

I followed some other suggestions: added an extra half cup of sugar, let the filling mix sit in the flour/sugar for the full 30 minutes, made a lattice top crust, let the pie sit in the oven for 20 minutes after turning the oven off when it was done cooking.
It's the best strawberry rhubarb pie I've ever tasted.

Easiest Pie Ever! I was a little hesitant to make this because some of the reviews said it was runny...NOT TRUE if you follow the recipe! I made a few alterations in that i evened up the fruit to 3 cups of each kind, I baked it at 425 for the first 15 minutes and then 375 for the remaining 40-45.
I also covered the edges with foil to keep it from getting too crispy and used a lattice top (it's not hard!) to let off some excess moisture.
This is the perfect pie! literally! Super easy and fast! I chilled it overnight and some of the next day and it was amazingly firm and the best pie i've ever tasted!

Wow.  Just made one of these this evening.  Subbed 1/2 Splenda and 1/2 honey for the sugar, glazed the top with milk & sugar and covered the edges with foil until the end.  I cooked it an extra 5 minutes to make sure it was done...amazing.

This was the best! Very sweet. And satisfying, especially with homemade whipped cream. The only thing I did differently was to drain the strawberries and rhubarb after letting it soak in the liquid. Otherwise the pie might have been runny. Other than that variation, I followed this recipe and was impressed with the results. Thank you for this recipe!

Fantastic!  I used thawed/drained chopped rhubarb that I had frozen fresh.  The strawberries I purchased were of varying sizes so I quartered the larger ones.  Followed the recipe to the letter, added a little ground cinamon to the filling and made a lattice top crust.  Baked exactly 40 min. on a sheet pan (very juicy).  Perfect balance of tartness/sweetness.

I have not made this exact recipe for Strawberry Rhubarb pie, but it is similar to the one I use.  I use 2 1/2 cups rhubarb and 2 1/2 cups strawberries to 1 cup sugar and 1/4 c. cornstarch.  as other reviewers stated, you will have a slightly runny pie until it is completely cool.  i cook 15 min. at 450, then reduce heat to 350 for 45 minutes and the pie comes out perfect every time.  i also add 1/4 tsp. nutmeg to the sugar cornstarch mixture before i stir into the fruit.

This is a great pie recipe! When cooking I wraped the foil around the edges to keep from burning, and cooked at 425 for 15 min and then removed the foil and cooked at 375 for 45 min. After it was done cooking I turned the oven off and left the pie in there for 20 min befor removing. This makes the pie set perfect! This is now a must have pie in our family.

This is a good recipe, however it might be a little too sweet...I might would lighten up on the sugar a lil bit.  It makes for a pretty presentation.  Yum.

This was great, but I applied other's suggestions. Cook on 425 with foil around the edges for 15min, remove foil and reduce temperature to 350 for 45 min, then turn off the oven and let rest for 30 minuets in the warm oven. Finally, remove and let cool completely before cutting to avoid runniness.

As a side, note, this calls for a lot of material to be added to the pie. I recommend using a cookie sheet under the tin to catch any drips in case you don't seal the edges perfectly.

This recipe is awesome!! It's easy and yummy. I did a lattice top and it looked really pretty too. If you are having trouble weaving the top, just lay them over each other,they grow together and look gorgeous! Definatly will try to make again.??

Reminds me of the pie my grandma made. I've made this several times and have not made any changes. The last time it was runny for some reason. I may try some of the suggestions of using corn starch. The flavor is great!

never had this kind of pie until I made this one. OMG! It was so good. Made one for a friend and she said it was the best she's ever had. Brought one into work the other day and everyone raved about it and asked for the recipe. As long as I can find the Rhubarb and get the Strawberries this will be a pie that I will make all the time. Thanks for the recipe.

My family loved this dish!  I had to cook it a little longer than suggested, but that has normally been my experience given our high altitude in Colorado.  We changed one thing - added blueberries to the pie...the flavors blended very well, and it came out perfectly.  The egg yolk also helped the pie brown beautifully.  Thanks for sharing!  :)

made this a couple days ago and got rave reviews! A little bit of sweet and a little tart - excellent!  I followed a few suggestions in reviews:  added cornstarch and 2 tbsp. flour to rhubarb and sugar and let cook in pan for about 10-15 min.  Added strawberries and let sit for about 30 min then put into deep-dish pie pan.  I also added cinnamon and nutmeg to filling with more cinnamon & sugar on top of 2nd pie crust.  Do be sure and have sheet below pie in oven because there will be drippings.  Will make this again soon!

I love the flavor of the filling but it's just a little runny.  I used three cups of strawberries and three cups of fresh rhubarb.  I cooked the rhubarb in about 1/4 cup of water and let it simmer and then added a half a cup of sugar.  I then added the strawberries and simmered for another five minutes.  I then put it in the pie crust and baked for 40 minutes.  I would probably cook another five minutes if I were to do it again and also add a bit of cornstarch to thicken it.  But the flavor of fresh rhubarb and strawberries is just unbelievably delicious.

I fixed this pie exactly as the recipe stated...it turned out perfectly. I chopped the fresh rhubarb into a small dice. I let the strawberries & rhubarb "sit" in the flour & sugar mixture for 30 min. before putting in the crust.  I also let it sit in the turned off oven after baking for about 30 min., then let it sit on a rack overnight.  Just juicy enough, not runny at all.This pie was wolfed down at the Memorial day barbeque I went to yesterday and everyone loved it.

this pie was excellent! i made the lattice top and added 2 Tbsp cornstarch to the filling mixture and it was just about perfect. just don't boil the rhubarb. it softens perfectly in the oven. if you boil it the filling will be too runny and the rhubarb mushy.

I used a store-bought crust and the lattice top rather than a solid crust.  I also boiled the rhubarb for about 5 minutes because they were early spring stalks and a little tough.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly, let it sit overnight, and it was FANTASTIC!  Definitely saving this recipe for the future!

This recipe is phenomenal. I didn't cook the rhubarb first but I did add 2TB cornstarch to the filling and let the concoction sit on the counter for 30min. I chopped the rhubarb to 1/4in thick and I didn't have any problems with a runny pie. This recipe has just the right amount of sugar for sweet and tart and leads to a beautiful looking pie as well. I will be making this one again, guaranteed.

This is one of the best recipies I have tried.  I didn't have any watery pie problems.  Make sure to let the pie filling stand on the counter for 30 mins before you put in the the shell, give it a good stir too.  I followed the fellow reviewers tip about cooking it on 425 for 15 min and then 375 for another 45... it was wonderful!

I made the entire pie from scratch. It took me a good two hours to get it perfect, but it baked beautifully. My boyfriend says it was the best homemade pie he'd ever had! What I might try next time is using 1/3 a cup of brown sugar and 2/3 a cup of white sugar for the filling. I highly reccommend this recipe to anyone willing to put the time, energy, and love into their baked goods to make this pie come out as well as it did.

This is the best strawberry rubarb pie recipe. I got it two years ago and I make a a few pies from local rhubarb and strawberry when it is in season. I recommend putting a cookie sheet under the pie because it sometimes bubbles over.

this pie was really runny. it needs some more flour or something else to thicken it up. the filling was tasty enough, but the instructions could be better, like how large to cut the rhubarb, what size/shape to cut the strawberries.

Suggest simmering the rhubarb in water until softened (estimate less than five minutes and keep a close eye on it or it will turn mushy.)  Drain well, cool, add strawberries and most of the sugar.  Sit 10 minutes, taste and add remaining sugar or more if the strawberries or rhubarb are especially tart.  Then add the flour and sit the remaining 20 minutes.  Taste again and proceed.

This was the most delicious strawberry rhubarb soup we have ever had!! The flavor was excellent, but we think it needs more flour to thicken up the filling. Although it was great drizzled over vanilla ice cream. Yummy!

This was delicious and I'm glad I tried this recipe. I cooked it 10 minutes longer at 400 and it was not runny at all, and yes, I did use flour.  Except for extending the cooking time, I followed the recipe.

This is my go-to recipe for Strawberry-Rhubarb Pie.  I NEVER precook the rhubarb, and it's always perfectly cooked.  If you're experienced with pies, you would check the consistency of the filling (through the slits/lattice) before removing the pie from the oven. 

The amount of flour needed will vary, depending on the juiciness of the strawberries.  I usually end up adding 1/4 c - 1/2 c more flour, but I wait to add it until the mixture has sat for the 30 minutes, then add as needed.  I never have any trouble with the sweetness of the pie, and 40-45 minutes at 400 degrees seems to consistently do the trick.  Besides adjusting the amount of flour in the filling, letting the pie sit for several hours (overnight is best) seems to make the most difference in the consistency.  The last time I baked one, it came out of the oven around 2:15 in the afternoon, and was PERFECT at about 9:00 the next evening.  I usually do a lattice top crust, but that's really just for aesthetics. When it comes to adding the butter, I generally don't unless I'm being lazy and using pre-made crusts; my crust recipe has PLENTY of butter to go around!

I had a bunch of frozen frozen rhubarb (at least 2 cups) and frozen strawberries (about a pint) that I thawed out and used here. I squeezed out some water from the rhubarb for fear it would be too much liquid when I baked it. I pretty much followed the directions but added 2 tablespoons of tapioca beads just for a little extra thickening. I followed someone else hint at leaving the pie in the oven a good 20 minutes after it was done baking: I didn't open the door, just turned off the heat. It looks perfect and a little dribble that came out gelled up nicely and was sweet and tart.

This pie sure was pretty but as a first time strawberry rhubarb pie maker, I didn't know you are supposed to boil the rhubarb first and the directions do not even mention it.  I took it to work and the rhubarb was crunchy!  I would boil it or something before making the filling because we all had to pick it out if the pie.

I have used both fresh and frozen rhubarb in this recipe and both have turned out great. The filling does tend to be a little soupy, so I just make sure I drain the rhubarb and strawberry juiced before letting them set in the flour mixture. Make sure you seal the edges of the crust together tightly because they will leak while baking. I just put mine on a tin foil lined cookie sheet in the oven to prevent any spilling. I find the tartness of the rhubarb great. They also freeze nicely.  Thank you

Very good!  Maybe a bit too tart - next time I'll use more strawberry and less rhubarb. 
Also, the very first step in this recipe is "preheat oven"  In the second step, you mix some ingredients and wait 30 minutes.  Unless your home is chilly and you need to warm it up a bit, wait a bit before preheating the oven...

Great recipe. I let it cool overnight and ate it the following evening, not runny at all. I made it with a crumb topping (1 c flour, 1/2 c brown sugar, 1/2 c butter)and it's absolutely delicious. Not too tart nor too sweet.

After reading the reviews stating the pie being runny & tasting like flour I was hesitant to try this recipe.  I did make it and it came out delicious!  I didn't change a thing that went into the recipe.  I did cook it quite a bit longer but that was all.  It wasn't runny nor did the filling taste like flour.  My husband loved it as did my neighbors.  I will be making this again. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This is fantastic!  My third time making this (in a month!) is in the oven now, and is going to my husband's fellow sailors, who live on base and rely on me for their home baked goodies. ;) The first time I made this, I did exactly as written; the second, with reviewers' suggested water/cornstarch.  No pre-cooking of the rhubarb, and both times have  been just beautiful. I use a small leaf shaped cookie cutter to vent the top of my pie, so maybe the larger hole that made keeps my pie from being soggy.

Absolutely awesome. Don't let this pie's deceptively simple ingredient list and directions fool you. It produces as good a strawberry-rhubarb pie as I've ever had, and it's incredibly easy to make. You might think you'd get a runny pie without tapioca or some other solidifying agent, but the flour does the trick. The pie's simple ingredient list leaves room for customization. I added a dash of cinnamon as an experiment, and it worked fine. I'll try something else next time around.
This pie is now at the top of my favorite list. Can't praise it enough.

I had never even tried rhubarb when I made this pie!

I made this recipe exactly as they said, and it turned out beautifully! Golden brown and everything. I took it out of the oven at 4pm, and we ate a slice at about 11pm and it was perfect. 

The recipe does not say to dice or cut the strawberries, and I have never made a fruit pie before so I was not sure what to do. I ended up cutting them into fourths. That worked out perfectly.

This is a pretty good recipe.  I made a couple adjustments: 1) Reduced the flour to ~3/8 cup and added 2 Tbsp. cornstarch to filling mixture.  Great filling consistency, not runny at all.  2) Some reviewers thought the pie was too sweet, so I used ~3/4 cup of sugar instead of the full cup.  This was a little on the tart side (still good), but next time I'll probably go ahead and use the entire 1 cup of sugar.

I rated the recipe a four because the filling tastes like it needs a little something extra.  Not sure what that should be - lemon zest, ginger, or maybe just better strawberries.  Next time I may try adding a little lemon zest and reducing the flour even more.  I will definitely use this recipe again though - thank you!

Perfect, basic recipe. To lessen chances of it turning out runny, I steamed the chopped rhubarb before adding it & the berries to the flour-sugar mixture. To steam rhubarb: put a metal steamer basket in a medium-sized pot, & an inch of water in the bottom of the pot. When the water boils, toss in the rhubarb, cover, turn heat down to low, let steam for 6 minutes. Then just toss the 'barb in with the berries, & continue following recipe as written. This easy step can really help prevent runny filling; it turned out perfectly & was nicely set!

I love both strawberries and rhubarb, but this pie was a disappointment.  The fillling was so running that slices could not be served and it was very pasty.  I wil look for another recipe for Strawberry-Rhubabb Pie.

Perfectly wonderful pie. My only complaint was I felt that 1 pound of rhubarb and 2 pints of strawberries would be too much filling for a 9" pie. I'm glad I listened to my gut. I was able to get the pie and a couple of tarts out it.

A tasty pie, no doubt.  I did not have any problems with runny-ness, but it wasn't as tart as I expected.  Whether the flavor was a result of the sugar quantity or the quality/season of the rhubarb I used is a matter to be determined by repetition.

Thank you so much for this incredibly easy recipe! I hardly ever make things perfectly on the very first attempt, but my pie is gorgeous!

I took some of the reviews into consideration and tweaked a few things. I did end up using cornstarch along with the flour and I think the texture of the filling is beautiful. I also let it sit in the oven for 20 minutes after turning it off. It's been in the fridge setting for about 8 hours and my boyfriend and I just pulled it out. It's amazing and certainly doesn't need heating up. I bet it will taste even better tomorrow morning for breakfast!

I changed this based on Susan's review: "i changed the recipe by using 3 cups each of strawberries and rhubarb. i didn't use the flour but instead (as previously mentioned) mixed 1/4 cup of water with 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and let it sit with the berries, rhubarb and sugar for 30 minutes. i also baked the pie for 15 minutes at 425 and then 40 minutes at 375. we let the pie cool for about 3-4 hours and it's not runny at all!!"  This turned out so great!  My husband was in heaven!

Everyone loved this. I used Ruth's Grandma's crust from this site and it was amazing. I wasn't sure about the amounts so I used about 3 cups each of rhubarb and strawberry. I would have liked it a bit more tart, so next time I will use more rhubarb. I also didn't bother with the butter, since many said it was unnecessary. I used a lattice top and sprinkled a bit of cinnamon and sugar on the top. My friend who warned me she didn't like rhubarb even liked it.

Was very good indeed found it a bit runny as well , I tried a friends technique  Use a box of tapioca pudding (dry) and add to filling . Works out great and you don't really taste the pudding.

Delicious, the whole family loved it and it was so easy to make - I used 3 cups of fresh strawberries and 3 cups of fresh rhubarb, 425 degrees for 15 minutes - 375 degrees for the next 45 minutes. Let it cool completely and dug in - mmmmmmmmm

This pie turned out great! Was not runny at all- after it sat about 30 min to an hr, it gelled up wonderfully. So tasty! This is a keeper! A tip for the oven temp....maybe turn it down to 375 about 10 -15 min in and also add a pie ring or tin foil to crust around the same time to prevent burning.

Amazing pie! Let fruit/flour/sugar sit for full 30 min before putting in pie and let sit in oven for 20 min with oven off after baking. Texture was perfect! Not runny, pie slices held shape on plates. Perfect sweet/tart balance. Yum! Thanks for the great recipe!  Used Krusteaz pie mix from a box.

This is a superb pie, but be sure to adjust to you taste and bake it properly!!!  It is a berry based pie which means lots of juice - you need to let it cool COMPLETELY, or it will be runny.  Be patient and let it cool and you won't be disappointed.  I used about 4 cups of freshly picked strawberries and 2 1/2 cups of fresh rhubarb - this made the perfect balance of sweet and tart for our tastes.  You may want sweeter or tarter and certainly whether you are using fresh or frozen fruit will make a difference.   Use Basic flaky Pie Crust from this site - and this is a 5 star recipe for classic strawberry-rhubarb pie.

This pie is so delicious!!  I was nervous about it being runny so I followed the advice of one poster who said that when the pie is done, turn off the oven and leave it in for 15 minutes.  The pie slices perfectly, even the first slice.

I lost many customers today from this pie recipe; the rhubarb does not cook enough and it is raw inside... I cooked it and prepared it according to the recipe. I have a pie business and was very disappointed by this as well as upset over my lost revenue. Hint; cook the filling first please! I lost alot of sleep last night due to this .

So easy!  I made a lattice top, brushed milk on the crust and sprinkled white sugar over it.  Didn't add butter.  It is one of the tastiest pies I've ever made!  I also baked for just shy of 40 minutes, and then turned the oven off and left it in there for 20 minutes so it would thicken up.  I did NOT cook the rhubarb beforehand.  The filling is delicious!

It was really good.  I thought that it ended up with a ton of filling so I split it between two pies actually. I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose.  I didn't think it was runny at all (and I noticed it even got thicker as it set).  It was very good.  :)

I followed this recipe exactly and it came out perfectly!  I did cheat a bit on the pie crust, I used a premade Pillsbury pie crust. The last 15 minutes I covered the crust with aluminum foil just to be sure the edges didn't burn.  After 35 minutes the pie was done but too juicy to remove from the oven.  I didn't want to move it for fear the juice would land all over the bottom of my oven.  So I shut the oven off, opened the door and let it sit there for about a half an hour until it set.  It has to completely set before you cut into it but it is well worth the wait.  Don't skip the egg yolk and sugar on top of the crust because it really makes this pie amazing.  Oh my gawd, is this pie delicious.

Excellent pie. I cut the rhubarb small and latticed the top crust and it cooked perfectly. I let it sit in the oven for 15 minutes, and then let the pie cool down almost completely before cutting - not runny at all. Easy to change the rhubarb/strawberry ratio based on how tart or sweet you like it. I've made this twice so far (with fresh rhubarb from our garden and fresh berries) - the 2nd time I brushed the egg yolk on the crust as per the recipe, which did not taste as good as my first which I brushed with lowfat milk. All in all great recipe!

This recipe is fantastic. I Used 1/4 cup flour and 1 heaping tbsp cornstarch. Also made a lattice top. Make sure to put a pan or something under the pie plate in the oven, because this spilled over! After baking, I left it in the pan to cool completely before storing it in the fridge overnight. Everyone loved it, and my fiance told me it was his favorite thing I'd ever made (although he says that about everything). Don't be afraid of the runniness!

Wonderful! I used Spenda instead of sugar, and baked at 425 for 15 mins, and then 375 for 45 mins as recommended. I had promised half to a friend and my husband didn't want me to give any of it away after he tasted it.

This pie was delicious.  It was my first time ever making a strawberry rhubard pie.  My neighbors who have been making them for years told me it was delicious.  I think the secret is to MAKE SURE TO LET THE MIXTURE SIT FOR 30 MINUTES BEFORE PUTTING IT IN THE PIE SHELL.  My pie was not runny at all.
Actually, there was nothing left of it when the picnic was over.

THIS PIE IS SOOOO GOOOOD! I would give it 10 stars if I could. I didn't change a thing and it was perfect. Tastes exactly like the one my grandma use to make when I was a little girl! I made this for Easter and everyone who ate it RAVED. It was nice to reminisce of grandma!

This was the best rhubarb pie that my husband has ever had.  Not too sweet and not too tart. I didn't let it stand for 30 minutes.  Also, I baked it ahead of time and let is set.  That may of helped it not be runny as others have experienced.  Also, I wrapped the edges with tin foil to keep it from burning.

It was delicious! I used a very simple crust recipe and followed the recipe pretty much to a T. only difference is I put in about 1/4 c. of brown sugar instead of white and I added some corn starch. Next time I will add more, b/c it was VERRRY juicy. I might also cook the bottom crust a little bit before putting in the filling. Everyone raved about it. Thanks!

I had never had a strawberry rhubarb pie in my life, but my boyfriend kept raving about them so I decided to try my hand at one.  I followed the recipe to a tee and it turned out wonderful.  It was sweet and tangy all at once.

I used finely chopped raw rhubarb, halved frozen strawberries, and 3/4 cup sugar--it's a delicious pie! It's not necessary, by the way, to cook the rhubarb before baking it. I poured away about a cup of juice after marinating the fruit--this kept the pie from being runny. (I cooked the juice in a saucepan later to make a single serving of excellent pudding!)

This was good! I did what another poster suggested and used 8 oz. of cream cheese at the bottom, I mixed mine with Splenda first to give it additional sweetness. I would only add 3/4 c. to the rhubarb/strawberry mixture, though. It was a touch on the too-sweet side (the actual strawberry-rhubarb mix part.) The crust was great with the addition of the cream cheese, and it was not in the least bit soggy. Just make sure to cool it before you cut into it - maybe that's what the other person didn't do? Patience will be rewarded with a nice easy-to-slice pie!

This made an excellent pie, although I would have liked to see an alternate measure for a pound of rhubarb (how much, chopped, in cups?). Mine was a bit too sweet, but I may not have put in enough Rhubarb (I think I did 3 or 4 stalks). Still, it didn't last long!

This is AWESOME!!!  I made this as a suprise for my hubby for Valentine Day..He was always raving about his moms pie and I had never even heard of Rhubarb!  I had to go to 4 stores to find the stuff and used prepackaged strawberries w/sugar instead of fresh ones and just left out the sugar part and it came out awesome!  Thank you so much.  I will be making this like once a week from now on!  Tina, Ryan and baby Cammie

I have tried other recipes.  This one is great and easy!  Make sure you don't use too deep of a pie dish and use a cookie sheet to put the pie on top of.  The pie overflows with the extra juice, which leaves the pie just perfect- not too watery!!  Must try!!

To all of you who "fixed" this recipe, but rated it five stars... perhaps you don't understand how ratings work. Being "nice" doesn't help those of us looking for a good recipe. When you rate your modifications you're rating a different recipe, skewing the ratings of this one, and frustrating the rest of us. Post your modifications as a new recipe and give it five stars. A recipe for which modifications are necessary cannot possibly receive a positive rating. 

I made this and followed the directions precisely. It is too soupy, and I let it cool overnight. Other recipes (and reviewers here) suggest pre-cooking the rhubarb to soften the bits and  evaporate some of the liquid, also using corn starch, etc. I will definitely use a different recipe when I try again. This isn't even a good base recipe to fix or modify.

I added a dash of cinnamon and allspice. Let it rest and 2 tablespoons of cornstarch. It turned out perfectly.

I used 3 cups of each. It was better the first time I made it, think I cooked it too long this time. I'll go back to following the original insructions, take pie shield off after 30 min. I also think I'm going to use a little bit less sugar next time.

After reading other reviews, I added a tsp. of cinnamon, zest from one orange and a 2 tsp. corn starch to fruit mixture. I let in stand in turned-off oven for a while after baking time and used a lattice top to be sure rhubarb was cooked through. The pie looked and smelled wonderful and the filling was just right too! Not runny, not crunchy, perfect balance of sweet and tart. Took it to a summer BBQ and everyone went nuts over this pie!!

I made this tonight for dessert.  I followed the recipe pretty closely except I used 1/4 C. cornstarch mixed into about 2-3 T water.  I read about the crunchy rhubarb and cut mine a little smaller than I normally would have - I won't do that next time.  I thought it was sweet enough, others thought it was not.  The concensus of the eaters was 4 stars.  Will definitely make this again!  Thanks Terri for a great recipe.

This was the best strawberry rhubarb pie I've ever had! I used 4 cups of sliced strawberries and 1 pound of frozen rhubarb. After letting it sit for 30 minutes, there was a lot of leftover juice in the bowl, which I didn't add in to the pie. I kind of drained the fruit before putting it in. That way, it wasn't runny at all.

Great flavor, easy to make, looked beautiful pulling it out of the oven, otherwise very disappointing.  After cutting into it, it was all water hadn't thickened at all and the rhubarb wasn't even cooked. Guess I'll have to go back to cooking the rhubarb and strawberries into a filling separately before putting it in a pie shell.

Your salvation is here, bakers! I have made this pie twice with vastly different results, so I can finally reveal to you why the reviews for this recipe are 50% glorious and 50% horrendous. Each time I followed the recipe exactly as is with one crucial difference - a difference which makes or breaks this particular pie! The first pie turned out beautiful and my family demolished it at Easter dinner. For this pie I used fresh strawberries and FROZEN RHUBARB. Everyone raved and raved about how good it was. Unfortunately, my husband and I got no pie after they were done with it! So I made it again this evening. This time I used fresh strawberries and FRESH RHUBARB. As other reviewers have noted, it turned into a disgusting soupy mess. The bottom and sides of the crust completely disintegrated as it cooled! So, do not be scared of the seemingly bipolar reviews. The author of this recipe should not have said that fresh or frozen rhubarb will do. Use FROZEN RHUBARB and this will turn out fabulous. Use FRESH RHUBARB and it will make you cry.

Made it exactly as there recipe said but followed "Jennifer's" advice and cut the rhubarb into very small pieces and did a lattice pie top.  Only four people for Easter dinner.  No pie left.

Frankly, my fruit pies don't really ever turn out that great.... this was perfect.  I didn't change the recipe at all. I let the mixture sit for 45 minutes before filling the shell.... YUM!

Really good!  I made it with frozen Strawberries and raw Rhubarb... I cubed the rhubarb 1/2 cubes.  I cooked it for about 30 minutes with tinfoil hat so the rhubarb and strawberries would cook before the crust browned and then removed the tinfoil and cooked for about 25 more minutes.  OMG sooooo good.

The flour in the filling gave it a pasty consistency and left a residue in my mouth.  Not a fan.

Great recipe. This strawberry rhubarb pie comes out perfect if you follow the instructions. Let the strawberries and rhubarb sit with the flour and sugar for the 30 mins and use the lattice crust for the extra ventilation.  In my opinion, strawberry rhubarb pie is best served cold, so let it cool! Served with whipped cream is even better.

Wonderful pie.  Followed the instructions with the following exceptions:  baked at 425 for 15 minutes then reduced the heat to 375 for the remaining time.  Also, we put foil over the crust in a tent once the high heat started to cause it to crust.  Don't hesitate to try this recipe.

delicious. i used 3 cups of each fruit (cut the rhubarb less than 1/4 inch thick), added 1 tablespoon of tapioca starch because i was concerned about other user reviews, as well as a bit of lemon juice and zest and a sprinkle of cinnamon. i left everything sit for the appropriate amount of time and let it sit over night before cutting into it. the taste and texture were both great.

Perfect, not too tart and not too sweet! I forgot the butter and left the crust plain and it was still delicious! I added a teaspoon of cinnamon. Lovely! I cut it after 3 hours cooling time and it was set up just fine.

This recipe sounded good, we had never had rhubarb so wanted to try it.   We bought rhubarb at the local farmers market.  I followed the recipe to the letter so  i don't know what happened.  By reading some of the other reviews, I made a lattice top. It was really pretty but that is all the good I can say.  1st. The pie was so runny it was like soup and the rhubarb was crunchy.  Don't think we will be making it again.

Delicious! I used fresh rhubarb and followed this recipe exactly (used 3 cups each of strawberries and rhubarb per pie) and the pie turned out perfectly. We cut into it when it was completely cool and the consistency was perfect!

Flawless.. I followed the recipe and it turned out amazing.. Only thing I didn't know was whether or not I should cut the strawberries a certain size?.. So I cut them a little chunkier than the rhubarb.. My husband fell in love with me all over again because of this pie :).  Thank you.. New family favorite!!!

Ok.  Followed the recipe exactly - the filling had a floury taste, and pieces of the rhubarb were a little crunchy (I cut them 1/4" thick).  The flavor was pretty good, but the four was WAY too heavy - I will search for another recipe next time.

Easy and delicious!  The quality of the strawberries and rhubarb made all the difference (locally and home grown).  I used 1 cup of organic raw sugar and two tablespoons brown sugar.  Instead of egg whites I used a bit of butter and raw sugar.  The perfect combination of sweet and tart.

This is the perfect amount of sugar and flour, my pie was not runny at all. I used a dash of all spice and 2 dashes of cinnamon with raw sugar to sprinkle over the top of the pie, and that was the only difference I made. It will be a Pie we eat every year this time! Thank you for the great recipe!!!

I followed the advice of one reviewer to use a lattice top, let it stand in the oven with the heat off for 10 minutes and I let it cool completely before cutting.  It was very runny.  We will eat it over ice cream but I'll find another recipe for my next pie.

On of my families favorit pies is a rhubarb strawberry pie, so we've tried many of recipes.  Unfortunately, this one did not meet our expectations.  It had way too much sugar and flour in it.  The flour so much so that it almost tasted pastey.  I think I'll be sticking to our regular recipes!

The flavor of this was down right perfect.  My only gripe about this pie was that the filling was a little on the gummy side, as the flour didn't seem to incorporate fully.  I mixed the fruit with the flour and other ingredients and let it all sit together while I made the crust in hopes of preventing this from happening, but was not successful.  I am not sure what else to do in this situation.  Won't keep me from making this pie again.  My husband and I both love strawberries and rhubarb together and this one had the perfect sweet, tart combination.

Delicious! I've made this twice so far and the second time I cut out about 15% of the rhubarb to sweeten it to my preference, but the rest of the fam and friends liked the more tart version just as much as my sweeter version, so no complaints. I prefer to brush the top with margarine instead of an egg yolk because it's easier not to get that slightly burnt look, but both taste good.

this was just the recipe I was looking for.  the amount of sugar is just right - you still get the tartness of the rhubarb coming through.  and the flour tightens up the filling just right.  easy and delicious!!  I just had a piece for breakfast!!

Delicious! I did everything I was supposed to...except for the crust. I used a frozen crust, and then created my own top crust with 3/4 c. flour, 1/4 c. sugar, 3/4 tsp. baking powder, 2 tablespoons oil, 2 tablespoons milk, and an egg., 1/4 tsp. salt. Yes...it was delicious!

This recipe is super easy! This is the second pie I've ever made and it turned out great! I followed the recipe for the most part, but also headed some of the other reviewers suggestions. A.) Add 1Tbsp. of Corn Starch to the flour and sugar before the strawberries and rhubarb. B.) I omitted the butter, it's not necessary.(but probably depends on your crust. Homemade vs. premade.) C.) Measurements for both rhubarb and strawberries is 3C each. D.) Bake at 425 for 15 min. and then lower temperature to 375 for 45 min. Cover edges of pie with foil so it doesn't burn the crust. Enjoy! This was a great recipe and one I'm sure I will use again! Thanks!

This was a good pie recipe.  I had actually made a 10" pie but kept all the ingredients the same and it worked out great.  I personally don't care for the smell of rhubarb so next time, I will add some lemon juice and/or lemon zest to kill/mask the smell of rhubarb.  Or maybe some orange juice and/or zest.  My kids and hubby were very happy with the pie, though.

Always wanted to make this type of pie.  I followed the directions as shown and it is one of the best pies I ever made.  I let it sit about 45 minutes after it came out of the oven.  My husband is VERY impressed with my baking skills with this pie.  Thank you for sharing such a great recipe.

Followed recipe using frozen rhubarb (not thawed) and fresh strawberries.  The pie sat for hours before cutting into it and was not runny at all, but filling tasted too gummy because of the quantity flour.  If I make it again, will use less flour or substitute something else for the thickener.

This recipe was wonderful, but for the people saying that it was too runny. adding a couple tablespoons of tapioca should thicken it up. or you could heat it up on the stove or in the microwave to thicken it up and just not cook it as long.

UGH! Not sweet enough. I made this pie for Thanksgiving, sweated over making my own crust. Crust ended up perfectly, pie did not. Seriously needed a spoonful of sugar AND ice cream just to make it edible. I will use this again for a starting point, but maybe double the sugar.

Greatest pie I ever made and I used a medium sized bag of frozen strawberries and a medium sized bag of frozen rhubarb. just rinsed them and mixed them with the flour and sugar.  Forgot the butter but it's still great.  I used milk instead of an egg yolk but it didn't brown as much as the photos on here.  But it was not liquid at all after cooling for 6 hours and my house is very warm.  I'll be keeping this recipe 4 ever.  I used 1/3 of a package of a 1 kg or 2.2 pounds of store bought pie dough for a 9 inch pie. I'm lousy at making my own and can never roll it properly but this one made it easy to roll...and it's actually cheaper to buy it pre-made here .

I cut down the sugar to 1/2 cup because it way too sweet even with a more tart rhubarb. The lattice pie crust and letting the pie sit for 30 min before cutting did help with the runnyness. I found that because the texture of the the filling was a bit more watery, it may have helped to cook the bottom pie crust for  10 min prior, letting it cool, and then place the filling and the lattice top crust. My pie crust  on the bottom turned out too gooey. I will try cooking the lower crust.

Excellent recipe!  I used the "Basic Flaky Pie Crust" from this website but I used all whole wheat flour instead of white and butter instead of shortening.  Excellent combination.  MMMMmmmMMM!

I have to agree with other users that this pie was very runny.  It definitely needs to be baked much longer than the recommended 40 minutes if you are not using a latice top crust.  The rhubard was not cooked all the way in some spots and the crust was even a little mushy since there was so much liquid.  I did make sure that the pie was completely cooled before cutting into it, as recommended by some people, but this did not seem to help.  If I try this again I will follow other reviewers' advice and cook the rhubarb first to soften and thicken it prior to placing it in the crust.

Nice pie.  Did the lattice top.  Mixed the strawberries and rhubarb ahead of time and let it sit.  Then allowed most of the liquid remain in the bowl.  Let the pie sit in the oven for 15 mintues after baked and it wasn't runny at all.  Would add a bit more sugar next time and maybe cover the top for the first 15 mintues while baking so it doesn't burn.  That way i can leave it in longer so the bottom bakes longer.

I have never really made a pie from scratch before. Well, I actually didn't make this crust from scratch. I got the ready-made crusts.  I used a bit less rhubarb and strawberries and did a lattice-crust using a technique I found on the internet. Baked for 40 mins and it was nice, bubbly and brown. I did cover the edges with foil so it wouldn't burn.  I let it sit for about an hour, and it was not runny at all! It is absolutely delicious. I made it for my boyfriend and I think he is going to love it! Such a simple recipe, but huge flavor. Will definitely be making again!

very good used about a cup of strawberries and 4 cups rhubarb used 1/4 c corn starch with water as recommended by others. One of the best strawberry rhubarb pies Ive had. Used Basic Flaky pie crust (couldnt believe how easy that was to make, followed directions no changes)

How can you go wrong. Two of my favorites (strawberry and rhubarb) and in a pie! Read the other reviewers comments about it being a bit runny, so also stirred in a little tapicoa in the fruit mixture, and think that helped thicken it up a bit. Also let it sit overnight, and had it the next day for breakfast. Great with some fresh coffee!

This was excellent, but be certain to put pie pan on a cookie sheet covered with foil, because the juices will run over.  I did add about 1 TBSP of cornstarch to the mixture since it looked very juice.  WAS PERFECT served with vanilla ice cream. Thank you for sharing Terri.

This was a great pie, I have made a homemade from scratch pie only one other time and this one turned out great. I think the thing is letting the filling set for the f30 minutes.   It was yummy I will for sure do this again...

To. Die. For. This pie rocks! I was a little afraid after reading reviews saying it was runny, so I added a little cornstarch to the flour mixture. I also added the zest of one orange, just for fun. I think the people that say this was runny must have cut it way too soon. Mine was visibly liquidy for a couple hours after being baked. Once it had completely cooled it was not at all runny; the syrup was thick and luscious. Awesome recipe. Thank you sooo much! :)  EDIT: Just wanted to say that I have made 6 of these pies since finding this recipe last month. People go nuts for it! :)

This pie came out wonderfully. My husband said it was the best pie he'd ever had. I followed someone's tip to use 3 cups each of berries and rhubarb (because I didn't have a way of knowing a pound of rhubarb) and it was perfect. Yum.

This was great! I added not quite a teaspoon of nutmeg to the filling and let it rest for 30 minutes. The pie wasn't runny even a little bit and yes...i let it sit for the entire 30 minutes aswell...that must be the key. mmmm...enjoy:) oh...i also did a lattice top to let out a bit more of that moisture.

It was wonderful!  I am not a professional baker and followed the directions exactly and it was one of the best pies I ever tasted.  The consistency was perfect.  I let it cool completely and it wasn't the least bit runny.  I can hardly wait to make it again.

This is an excellent and simple recipe.  I followed advice of others and used corn starch instead of flour (actually I use half of each) and have never had any issues with a flour taste or texture.  I recommend a lattice crust for the top - I always find with fruit pies this stops them from being too runny, and looks fancy too.

This recipe has the perfect amount of sugar for a sweet pie that doesn't over power the naturally sour rhubarb.  Yummy!  I let it sit in the oven to cool after baking (just turned the oven off after baking) to make sure it didn't come out soupy, and it worked wonderfully!

Very good.  Only thing i changed was i used dry tapioca instead of flour to thicken the pie.   For 2 cups rhubarb and 2 cups strawberries i added 1/4 cup dry tapioca.  It adds no flavor, but it thickens without having the floury taste a few reviews commented on.

I made a few changes and the pie was not soupy at all! I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, made sure to let the fruit sit in the mixture for at least half hour and left in oven with door open and turned off for an extra 20 minutes and the pie cam out perfect!! Big hit with the family!!!

I followed the suggestions, i.e., made sure it sat a full 30 min prior to serving and leaving in closed oven for 20 min after baking.  Cooled for about 4 hours and was DEVOURED at a picnic.  Excellent.

i had high hopes for this. The top crust was nice and crispy and looked great. But the filling just mushed together without much taste (even though I had added some cinnamon), and the bottom crust was pasty and soggy, too.

Perfect!!   I used 3 cups strawberries sliced in 1/2 (they were on the small side) and 3 cups rhubarb and I also put 2 TBS cornstarch in the flour/sugar mixture.   I have made pies like this many times and it seems to be hit or miss with them being runny.  This time I followed the advice of many others and used a lattice top.  When the pie was just about done I turned the oven off and left the pie in there for the rest of the evening, then I put the pie in the fridge right before bed.  Perfect!!!  Thanks.

Delicious and easy! I only made a few changes, namely cooking the rhubarb separately in a bit of boiling water with the sugar and in lieu of adding flower to the raw mixture, added two tablespoons of cornflour dissolved in water to the cooked mixture to avoid a floury taste and undercooked/too tart rhubarb and runny pie. In the end the recipe required a great deal more sugar but maybe that depends on your rhubarb.

I halved the strawberries and cut the rhubarb into 1/2 inch pieces.  There was too much fruit to fit into one pie, so I made a little tart out of the extra.  I made a homemade orange pie crust (pie crust with OJ instead of water) which complemented the flavors well.  I had to add ten extra minutes to the cook time before the crust was cooked fully.  The filling tastes amazing but is incredibly runny.  Hopefully it will firm up over time.  I had no problems with the rhubarb not cooking through, and I think precooking it would only make a mushy finished product.  I will see what I can add or change to make the filling less runny, but this is an excellent pie otherwise.

YUM! Just like you get from a bakery! I did boil the rhubarb for about 5 minutes, then drained it a little before adding it. I doubled the recipe and made two pies- using 2 lbs each strawberries and rhubarb. Also, I used the lattice top idea by taking store bought crust (the kind that's refridgerated and you have to unroll) and slicing them up into 1 inch strips. No runny pie here. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This pie was great, but i changed the 1/2 cup of flour to 3 T Arrowroot (a thickener). Then, after you mix the fruit/sugar/arrowroot,  put everything in a collander to get the majority of the juice out. super full of fruit, without the goop.

VERY SIMPLE RECIPE AND VERY GOOD ALTHOUGH I ADDED 2TB CORNSTARCH,FEW DASHES OF CINNAMON AND NUTMEG AND ABOUT 1/2 CUP MORE SUGAR..OUR STRAWBERRIES AREN'T AT THEIR PEAK YET,THEN LET IT SET THE REQUIRED 30 MINUTES..THINK LOCAL STRAWBERREIS WILL MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE..REALLY GREAT PIE-LOVED IT AND IT CAME OUT OF THE PAN IN A PERFECT SLICE EVEN WHEN SLIGHTLY WARM..

This pie is fabulous.  I made a few changes to the original recipe.  I added a heaping tablespoon of cornstarch to the filling and did not add all of the juice to the crust after it had marinated for 30 minutes.  This pie was not runny at all.  Their was the perfect amount of tart/sweet, I will definetely make again soon.

This recipe is fantastic!  I did not let the fruit sit for 30 min, though. I like my rhubarb diced very small so it's not crunchy.  I mixed in the flour and sugar, poured it
straight in the shell, weaved my lattice, egg wash & sugar, and popped it in the oven.  Be sure to cover your edges with foil, of course. I did let it cool at room temp for a couple of hours.  The filling consistency was perfect.  I wish we could post pictures.  DELICIOUS!

This recipe is both easy to make and delicious!!!  Substituting 1 cup of Splenda granulated for the 1 cup of sugar doesn't affect the taste, and makes it slightly healthier.

I may not have been baking pies for 20 years, but I've made my fair share of rhubarb pies.  This is a pretty good recipe that lets the flavor of the fruit do the talking.  The consistency was perfect, often times with rhubarb (especially frozen) the pies are so runny.  I was very pleased!

This was a wonderful pie! I had no problem with the rhubarb being hard, the crust getting soggy, or the filling being too runny as some of the other reviewers said (and I even used Washington strawberries--very, very juicy).  In fact, the rhubard was perfectly soft and the flour was just right for keeping the pie in shape.  Next time however, I'll put more rhubarb than called for, because I like my pie a little more tart.

This recipe did not work out for me at all.  For one thing, I used frozen strawberries and frozen rhubarb which made everything very gloppy.  The pie was very very thick, and did not go over well with my nieces and nephews.

Very sweet/tart. Maybe a little too tart for me, but it was probably the rhubarb I used, everyone seemed to loved it. I really love the sugary pie crust idea though - mouthwatering! Great recipe!

I use Allrecipes all the time only using recipes that rate 4 stars or better.  This is the first time I’ve added a rating because this pie turned out so poorly.  It looked great but was so very runny.  What a waste of beautiful organic strawberries and rhubarb.

Great recipe with some doctoring. I simmered the rhubarb and strawberries in 1 cup of sugar before adding it to the flour and sugar mixture, then added 1/2 tablespoon of cornstarch. It's my SO favorite pie!

This is the second pie I've ever made and my boyfriend was speechless as to how good it was. This pie is absolutely perfect the way it is. I used homemade pastry crust with a lattice top and it cooked to perfection. 

The trick is fresh, flavourful strawberries (local!) and fresh rhubarb, and really letting them sit for AT LEAST 30 minutes before putting them in the pie. I didn't need to change the heat or timing or anything, but I did let the pie sit in the oven (off) for about 20 minutes afterwards. I should have wrapped the edges in foil for some of the baking as they were slightly too brown, but not so much that it was a problem.  The filling held together amazingly after the pie was cooled (don't be eager, this is the most important part) and tasted even better the second day. I changed nothing about the recipe.

I made this pie to prepare for Hurricane Harvey. My friends loved it! I followed the recipe to the letter and did not run into any of the problems that others had.  I let everything sit for 30 minutes, baked for 40 min, covered edges at 30 min. The only thing I will try different is to place the cookie sheet on the lower rack and pie on the upper rack.  The center of the bottom crust did not cook quite like I like.  Thank you Terri for the recipe.  I will definitely keep this recipe in "Go To" box!

Second time making rhubarb/strawberry pie as my first was overly sweet and runny. Followed the directions but changed a couple things after being cautious and reading some other reviews. First was no flour. 2 tablespoons cornstarch to 1/4 cup water. 3 cups of strawberries to 2 and a bit rhubarb, mix with sugar, splash of lemon juice. Follow directions, but baked for first 15 mins at 425 then for 40 at 375, let cool for at least 30 mins, voila!

The pie wasn't runny at all it was the perfect consistency. I left it in the oven turned off for 15 min and let it cool for a reasonable amount of time. I was impressed with the texture and how it held together when I took out the first slice!

All I would say is it wasn't sweet enough. Could be dependent on the tartness of the strawberries I used. Next time I will up the sugar a little bit and see what happens!

Used corn starch instead of flour, frozen (thawed) uncooked rhubarb, no butter and it turned out perfect!

I took this to Sunday Dinner and it was an absolute success! Everyone raved about how it was the best strawberry rhubarb they had ever had!...and believe me, it's a tough crowd! My Husband's grandfather always compares pies, desserts, etc to how his late wife prepared them... and he loved it! :-D

I made this recipe exactly as written and it turned out wonderful.  I let it set for 15 additional minutes in the oven (off) that was suggesed by another review and it came out perfect.  Make sure to chop the rhubarb into small pieces and half the berries.  I will be making this recipe again and again.  Thanks  for sharing!

Awesome. Only thing I changed was, before baking, put foil on the edges of the crust, and bake at 425 for 15 minutes. Then, I turned the heat down 375° and took foil off. If you don't do this, your pie will be very runny!

I reduced the sugar by about a third. Before putting on the top crust, I added the juice of one lemon. This enhanced the taste of both the strawberries and the rhubarb. The taste of the rhubarb was **much** better.

This recipe is awesome. No need to cook rhubarb before hand at all. This recipe is maybe not going to fit everyone as the posts I read had concerns. One posts states "should have mentioned to cook rhubarb". They didn't mention it because that's not how their recipe went. Maybe the fault was you not cutting your rhubarb small enough. Nothing wrong with suggestions but to be critical is out of line to me. Nothing wrong with added changes though. Very good pie!

I loved this recipe. I was afraid it would be runny due to other reviews so I took the advice of someone else. I cooked it the 35-40min BUT when it was done I turned off the oven but left the pie in for another 15min! Huge difference in the filling. It bubbled and was clearly thick vs when the oven originally wentoff and it was still s little runny

Loved this recipe. I didn't have any problems that previous posters had. It was delicious right out of the oven. Not runny at all. You must wait the entire 30 mins before filling pie shell that is the key I think. Making it again today. Plan to add less sugar this time as I found it a bit sweet.

I have a question.  I was raised to peel the rhubarb before cooking or baking.  Was this because the stalks were so huge?  Ours grew on a bank with stream running below it in Upstate New York.  It was always at least 1" thick and there was always more than we could use.
 I sure wish I had it down here in Kentucky.

My father-in-law asked if I would try to make this pie for him.  Mom and I made two today, 1 double crust and 1 with an open design on top.  Both turned out beautifully.  Excellent recipe. Not runny and not dry. A+++.

Read the reviews how to make it less runny. Add flour or tapioca or corn starch to the rhubarb/strawberry filling. Cream cheese layer on the crust is something to try. 

This is a favorite worth learning to perfect.

This recipe is amazing! My husband LOVES it! I will definitely be using this recipe again. So helpful. But if you want to save some time, just  buy the premade crust in the store. I recommend the one in the biscuit section. It makes it fast and easier for those with a time crunch and it tastes just fine.

I did not have enough strawberries (some of them had gone bad in the fridge), so I added some cut up nectarines as an experiment. It came out delicious! I also forgot to add the butter before the top crust, but I didn't miss it at all. Definitely let it sit for hours and hours before cutting into it so that it will not be runny. Yummy!

This is a revised review. I made this pie yesterday, let it cool completely, and sliced into it. It was runny and the juices pooled into the vacant area after taking the slice out. I had to drain it. However, I let the rest of the pie sit overnight, and it's not runny at all now. So, I would recommend making it the day before you need it for the best result.

I'm not sure what I did wrong. I thought the pie was really runny and this is my third strawberry rhubarb pie recipe this summer. I didn't put a top on the pie, based on previous reviews, hoping that it would help evaporate some of the juice. No luck. I'll be using a different recipe next time.

Just a note that you don't need to turn the oven on right at the beginning as the first step.  Because ideally you want the fruit/sugar/flour mixture to rest for 30 minutes before cooking, you have lots of time to get the oven up to temp after mixing.

My family and I thought the strawberry flavor overpowered the rhubarb. It was more sweet than tart, but that's a taste preference. I will add a little less strawberries next time.

We thought this was pretty good.  It wasn't runny but I made it the day before we ate it and the rhubarb wasn't tough at all.  We really enjoyed the recipe.  Thanks.

Used the French Pastry Pie Crust by TJ (the BEST). Ended up leaving sugar mixed with S-R overnight in fridge. Then added another 1/4 cup of flour + 1 T Corn starch before putting in pie crust. Let it cool in the oven and then put it in the fridge overnight. Was a little runny at first (because it was left over night in sugar) but after removing a little of the liquid, it thickened perfectly and made the most delicious S-R Pie ever!! Gets better with age!

I have made this pie recipe a few times and it is always loved. I use a weave pattern for the top crust which lets more moister cook out, leaveing a pie that is not as runny and nice texture.

I made this following the recipe as is, and while the flavor was delicious, it turned out EXTREMELY runny! There is SO much excess liquid. Also some of the rhubarb did not cook thoroughly enough. I would recommend cooking the rhubarb ahead of time before putting it into the filling to better the flavor and decrease some of the liquid.

This was very simple and delicious! I read the reviews and used 3 cups rhubarb, 3 cups strawberries, and the cornstarch trick (1/4 cup water + 2 tablespoons starch). After the filling sat for 30 minutes there was liquid that developed from the sugar and the cornstarch. I did NOT put this liquid into the crust, so my pie was not runny at all.

I loved this recipe. I followed the directions exactly and the pie was perfect. It was not runny at all and after cooling down, we had it for dessert. I did make a lattice top crust, so maybe that helped to keep it from being runny. The rhubarb was fresh from our garden, so it was very tender.

I only added 1/4 cup of sugar and added a 6 oz container of blueberries.  Beautiful! Took longer to bake, but I think it's my oven. :-)

I thought this was really yummy! I did drain alot of the liquid before putting it in the pie crust. It did bubble over in the oven, so I think i'll drain it alot better next time. But it tasted great and I will make again!

Easy and delicious recipe, just like my mother use to make.  However, I definately don't like the egg yolk on the top pie crust.  I only tried it because it said to.  Next time I will use egg white instead of egg yolk as I usually do.  Otherwise, great pie filling!

I liked the flavor of this pie, it struck a nice balance between sweet and tart, but I agree with some other reviewers that it was waaay too runny. Using more flour wouldn't be a good option because that would start to affect the flavor. I would use this recipe again but I'll experiment with corn starch and/or tapioca as a thickener.

I ate almost the whole  pie myself, but only because no one else really liked it. To me it was a waste of good strawberries because it tasted so much like cooked berries. I love rhubarb pie, but I will stick to my mom's recipe with just rhubarb. And for some reason, my never fail pie crust was as hard as a rock on the bottom.

Great recipe.  Tastes just like when grandma used to make it!  
My variations from the recipe:
1.  Turbinado raw cane sugar instead of white sugar (1:1 ratio) just because it's what I had.
2.  Lattice on top instead of full crust.
3.  Brushed almond milk on top instead of egg yolk.  (Might be helpful for vegetarians who don't buy cow's milk or eggs.)

I cooked mine for the full time (40 min) and let it sit for at least an hour.  It was still warm when we cut it, but not runny at all!  Delish!

This pie was excellent. Everyone loved it. I read the reviews and tented tin foil on top baked it at 425 for 20 min then 35 min at 375. Then took the foil off the top and browned the top (about 10 min)I made a lattice top for it and none of the juices spilled out. I did add about a tbsp of cornstarch to the sugar/flour mixture. I let it sit for 2 hours before cutting and was a tad bit juicy but not running everywhere. Would definately make again.

This pie was delicious, but I too ended up with a runny pie. I made no changes. I took it out when the crust was brown at 35 minutes, but the filling wasn't bubbly. Maybe this was my problem? I even had a pie shield on, but I felt if I left it in any longer the crust would be overdone. I used a basic shortening crust with lattice top. It was definitely cooled when we cut into it... so runny, though, that I almost wanted to pour off the liquid (I resisted.) It tasted fabulous, though!

This turned out to he strawberry rhubarb soup in a crust.  I will try the recipes that use tapioca instead.  Filling was delicious though, and sweetened just right.

Wonderful!!!! This was my first time making a rhubarb pie.  It is my husband's absolute favorite pie (his grandmother's specialty),so intimidated was an understatement.  I found this recipe seriously simple, and absolutely delicious.  I made it as scripted, and did bake it a little longer since we are at high altitude.  The hubs said it was perfect :)

Easy recipe and not very time consuming. I sliced the rhubarb extra thin (less than 1/4 in) but it still turned out crunchy so I guess I'll be boiling it first from now on.

This is an easy, delicious recipe!  I made it one night for myself and three others and only one small sliver survived the night.  I've never had any desire to use rhubarb before but it seemed worth trying when I came across this recipe, and it adds a wonderful tartness to the pie.  This is definitely going to be a staple pie recipe at my house - I've made it three times in the last two months!

Amazing!  I liked the previous post where they suggested leaving the pie in the oven after turning it off.  I think this really helped to rid of any excess liquid from the pie.  It was just the right amount of tart to sweet and the pastry (I used the featured video on pie crusts) was flaky and delicious!

I'd had high hopes for this recipe, but I was sorely disappointed by the results. I followed the directions exactly (except I followed others' advice to use a lattice crust on top to let the steam esccape). I ended up with strawberry-rhubarb soup in a crust! It did have a good flavor, but the consistency was definitely not up to par.

I made this pie exactly as the recipes states.  The ruhbarb did not need to be cooked first...altho, it may depend on how thick the stocks are.  Mine were failrly thin. The pie cooled and set for approximately 5 hrs and had a perfect consistency when cut.  It was actually even better the next day!  The recipe is a keeper.

I did what Jennifer said, it so far looks amazing! This is my husband's favorite pie and he hasn't had one since before we were married. He was thrilled when I announced I would be making one for dessert tonight. My children are just as excited. 
Note to others, always make sure you read all the reviews for any revisions. A lot of times the revisions improve the recipe a LOT.

Yum!  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used 2 T tapioca to help thicken the filling.  I used rhubarb that I had frozen from this spring and it was still really good.  The guys at work are going to love it! :)

I had never made this kind of pie before, but it was my boyfriends birthday and it is his favorite so I found this recipe.  The pie turned out amazing and I did exactly what the recipe said.  I even live at 5,000 elevation and had no problems.  This recipe is a keeper!

Excellent Pie! the only thing i did different was drained out some of the sugar liquid after soaking the fruits for an hour. I figured it would be way too watery in the pie when the fruits cooked down if i dumped all of the liquid out.

I was sooo looking forward to a great pie, but was very disappointed. It was very soupy and runny, even though I tossed the filling with the flour/sugar mixture. Also, even with decreasing the sugar to 3/4 cup, it was too sweet. If I were to make it again, I'd definitely use cornstarch in the recipe like other reviewers, and I'd lower the sugar to 2/3 cup.  We did like the egg-yolk-and-sugar brushed top crust.

I made this for 4th of July because my Grandma always made strawberry rhubarb pie.  I've never made a pie (even the filling) from scratch before, and this worked out really well and was very good.  I did follow the suggestions to use a lattice crust, to let it sit in the oven for 15 minutes after cooking time on the OFF, and then make sure it is cool before serving.  Then vanilla ice cream on top.  Really good!

This was my first time cooking or eating rhubarb. My son in law is a produce manager and he and my daughter brought me rhubarb and strawberries. I doubled the recipe, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. These pies set up perfectly. My daughter and I were eating one while it was still hot. It's a delicious pie recipe and has made me a fan of rhubarb. I will definately be making over and over.

I have never cooked with Rhubarb before, but after getting a bunch in my farm share bag I had to try something new.. My husband loves Strawberry Rhubarb pie, so after reading over all the other recipes I went with this one. The filling itself was tart and tasty. My only problems was that even though I baked it for the longest baking time my bottom crust was under cooked almost to the point of being raw.. I also did a crumble top which came out great :-)

I have always had trouble with fruit pies being runny,  so I added a small amount of extra flour and sugar to the recipe (with 3 C berries and 3 C rhubarb).  The pie wasn't runny,  and was ready to cut in about 5 hours.  It was a bit tart,  though,  definitely not too sweet!  I live in CO,   so to make adjustments for the altitude I turned the oven down to 375 after 20 min.

This is phenomenal!  I have never liked rhubarb, but agreed to make the pie for my husband's birthday.  It looked pretty, so I had a sliver.  OMG - it was so good I had to immediately have another piece!  Perfect blend of tart and sweet.  I followed the filling recipe exactly.  The only change I made to the pie was to make a lattice top and I only sprinkled sugar on it, rather than brushing with the egg yolk.  I never thought I'd say this - but I love strawberry-rhubarb pie (but only if I make it and use this recipe)!  Thanks for sharing!  (My husband is particularly thankful for sharing since now he knows he'll get this pie more than once every seven years!)

Wonderful pie! Old Fanny Farmer calls for 2 TBSP flour and one whole egg in the filling.  I always use that, mixed with the sugar and tossed with the fruit.  Lattice crust, letting it sit in a turned-off oven, and letting it cool before cutting all are great tips that work to prevent runniness.  I brush the lattice top with a little cream, put foil around the edge, and bake it on a baking sheet in case of runover.  Doesn't last long once you slice it!

Excellent pie! I used one 16-oz. bag of frozen  strawberries and one 16-oz. bag of frozen rhubarb. Thaw and drain before adding sugar and flour. I used my standard Crisco recipe for double crust. The ratio of sweet to tart is perfect! My husband absolutely loved it. I'll make it again and again without changing anything about it.

I have never made this kind of pie before this one.. After reading the reviews and taking into consideration the comments about it being a little runny I used a slotted spoon to spoon the filling into the crust.. that way I got rid of some but not all of the juices.. This pie was AWESOME.. my husband and I ate it in one day.

Tastes very good, but did turn out very watery. That is why I am giving it 3 stars rather than 4. Because of this extra liquid, the bottom of the pie crust did not cook very well. Next time, I would bake the pie crust for a few minutes seperately. Otherwise, a very sweet and tasty pie.

I followed the recommendations of allowing the rhubarb to sit in the flour mixture (of which I discarded the extra flour) for a full 30 minutes.  I also allowed the pie to stay in the oven after baking was done, while the oven cooled.  The pie filling was delicious and a perfect consistency!  I sprinkled top layer with sugar and nutmeg prior to baking.

this recipe was awesome.  I took others suggestions for cooking and let the strawberries and rhubarb sit for 30 minutes in flour/sugar mix before adding to crust.  I also let the pie sit in the oven for 30 minutes after baking it, with the oven off.   We cut into it after 4 hours and it was perfect not runny at all!!!THIS IS A KEEPER!!!  I will be making this over and over.

This was my first-ever homemade pie, and it turned out perfect. My husband said it was better than his grandma's! I will be making this again.

WOW! This is a keeper. I have never made a rhubarb and strawberry pie so this was just a shot in the dark. It will become a regular in our house. The thing I don't get though, why go to all the work to make a wonderful pie from scratch and then use store bought pie crust? I never thought I could make crust either and then just tried one time and have never gone back to store bought. Okay, it may not always go together perfect, but man it tastes so good.

Absolutely delicious. I'd never made a fruit pie or even tasted one so I was unsure of how it would turn out. Since my husband requested it specifically for Father's Day, I had to try. It was perfect. I used a lattice top and let it sit in the oven with the heat off for 30 minutes after cooking. The consistency was just right.

I'd never made this type of pie before, and was very happy with the results with this recipe. It was the perfect balance between sweet and acid (from the rhubarb). Thanks for the great recipe!

Followed the directions with fresh strawberries and rhubarb, keeping it in the oven with the oven off was a great tip. No running, tastes great.

I had never baked a rhubarb pie before so I was skeptical with the mixed reviews.  I took suggestions from others - used 3 cups of each fruit and I too added some Pampered Chef mixed spices.  It would be fine to just use a little cinnamon and nutmeg if you don't have that.  I forgot to add the butter but it was fine.  I cooked the pie in the evening and we ate it the next day.  It was not the least bit runny and I didn't notice at all that it tasted like flour.  My hubby doesn't really care for rhubarb and he loved it!!

Tried this recipie a few weeks ago....and got mixed reviews.  The pie filling itself was good, but even after letting it cool for 3 hours, the filling was still very runny. I did make a lattice top, but still didn't get the results that I wanted.  BUT...the filling was so good that I'm going to try it again, maybe just using a little cornstarch to thicken.

I thought this pie was fantastic! A lot of the reviews said it was runny, but I thought it set perfectly it just needed to cool completely. I left out the butter because I felt it was unnecessary, the pie was perfect with out it. I added a bit of lemon juice to the recipe and didn't use a lattice top. Some reviews I read said they could taste flour, my suggestion would be to mix the sugar and flour together separately before adding it and mix really well.

I liked the pie but I also found that it did not set - cornstarch would have been better than flour.  As well I would have added more sugar but I like my pie sweet.

After Reading a lot of the reviews on this I almost hesitated on making this pie. Thank god I followed through! This was an awesome recipe and the pie came out fantastic. I didn't think that this recipe needed any tweaking. For those whose experienced a runny pie try and leave it in the oven for twenty minutes after you shut the oven off. I read someone's review that said that and I think that it worked. This is a recipe that I will be going in my own home cook book! Thanks Everyone

Great pie, but really runny. Next time I make this I will do something to help thicken it up. I cut my rhubarb to 1/4" slices to help them cook up. It was delicious!!!! A great use for the rhubarb out in my garden. This was my 1st time ever cooking/baking with rhubarb. :0)

This was awesome. I used a 16oz bag of frozen rhubarb as well as a 16oz bag of frozen whole srawberries since that is what I had in the freezer. I think that it is important to let the rhubarb/srawberry/sugar/flour mixture to sit for 30 mins before pouring into the pie crusts. I allowed it to cool in the oven for about 30 as suggested and then cut it the next morning and it was not runny.  Tastes just like my grandmother used to make. Thanks.

If I could give this 10 stars I would.  It turned out wonderful.  I followed the recipe to the letter only I used a Pillsbury pre-made crust as I was short on time.  I let it sit overnight before I cut it and it was not runny at all.  My husband had more for breakfast because he couldn't wait till afer dinner :)  This is a pie I will make over and over again.

I thought this pie turned out excellent and was not runny at all. I only made one modification and that is to use 1/2 flour 1/2 corn starch. I let the rhubarb / strawberry mixture sit the full half hour and stirred very well. Also, I baked the pie the night before which is important. I made this for my mother-in-law for Mother's Day and she had 2 pieces!

A friend gave me some rhubard which I froze and ultimately used it in this pie recipe. I let it thaw overnight then drained the liquid. After that I followed the recipe as printed. It came out great and I received many compliments.

I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of a lattice top pie crust, and it turned out great. I DID NOT cook the rhubarb before baking. I simply sliced it thinly. I did follow the suggestion to leave it in the oven after baking for 20 minutes, with the oven off. Just the right combination of sweet and tart.

Awsome! I only made 1 change. I read in another recipe how they stirred 1 beaten egg into the sugar/flour mixture. I just wanted to try that and it was beyond excellent! The pie was firm and jelled nicely and cut beautifully. Sorry I didn't take a photo of a cut slice because it was so perfect.

I have made this recipe numerous times, following the recipe exaclty. Everyone always loves it, rarely do I leave with leftobers. If the rhubarb isn't very ripe (still pretty firm) I slice it very thin. This definitely seems to help it cook better. But if at all possible, try to find rhubarb that is softer, not crisp like celery. This is the only strawberry rhubarb pie that I will make.

I made this with the No-Fail Pie Crust 1 recipe also on this site.  First time I ever baked a pie, and it turned out delicious.  Even my dad, who eats a lot of pie thanks to my mom, was raving over this one.  I'm amazed at how well strawberry and rhubarb complement one another.  I'd save this recipe for late spring/early summer when both fruits are at their peak.

My family said this was the best strawberry rhubarb pie they ever had! I noticed on some of the other reviews that people said it was too soupy so I added an extra 1/4 cup of flour and let it cool completely before I served it and it wasn't soupy at all! I also added a little cinnamon for some extra flavor and it was great! I will definitely make this pie again

Excellent pie.  I took the advice of another cook and left the pie in the oven after turning it off 15-20 minutes.  Worked perfectly.  Thank you for this recipe.

SUPER-DELICIOUS!! SUPER-EASY!!
The key here, as others have commented:  after baking, turn the oven off, open the oven door and leave the pie alone!  After 10-20 minutes, remove from oven and let it cool completely before attempting to cut into it.  This will avoid a runny pie.  Even better the next day!

This pie is great!  I made it with a crumb topping instead of lattice and decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup because of it.  I will definitely make this one again!

So GOOD!!!! I used pie crusts from a store to save time, because I am chasing after a 2 year old and have a 2 week old baby. We were given some fresh rhubarb from a farmer friend and waited until both kids were sleeping to bake the pies together. My husband loved this and we will definitely be making these again!!!!

Came out SO yummy!  I used the fruit that I had on hand.  1lb rhubarb, 1lb strawberries (they were really big so I quartered them) and one package of blackberries (these we're also big so I halved them).  I also made the latice crust and I think that is definitely the way to go.  When it came out of the oven it didn't appear too runny but I didn't need it until the day after so I refrigerated it anyways.  So perfect the next day, all gave thumbs up including me!

Delicious!  It was a little runny, but once it sat in the fridge for a few hours, it was INCREDIBLE!!

RUNNY! Should have modified it using the reviews. An okay taste, but this specific recipe isn't worth it unless you're willing to re-write the whole thing searching through others' reviews.

This was a GREAT recipe...it came out perfectly tender and sweet. I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with the best pie I've ever made! Go with the lattice crust idea (as someone else has already suggested). I love it!

This turned out wonderful. I did as others suggested and made a lattace top to allow plenty of ventilation and the pie was plenty thick and oh so delish with some vanilla ice cream on the side. I will deff. use this recipe again.

I made this pie yestereday, just using some water and corn starch (no flour) and I had some blueberries on hand so I threw a few of those in there, as well.  It was a little runny, but it's a strawberry rhubarb pie!  It's supposed to be runny!  That is the fun of it.  Yummm... so delicious.  I had 2 people who ate 3 pieces each!  Thanks for the recipe!

This pie was okay....Really runny even after letting it rest and cool down.  I added lemon zest to bring out the fruit flavours.  The flavour was nice and I just drained out the runny juice after baking and put it on top of ice cream.  Overall, an okay recipe.

This is my favorite kind of pie ever, and such a summery treat!  Even though I let the fruit sit in the flour/sugar mixture for 1/2 hour, the pie still came out a little soupy, but the taste is phenomenal! And the sugar on top adds to the overall look of the finished pie. Goes great with vanilla ice cream!

Great Pie!  Very easy recipe.  I followed another persons note and did 3 cups each of the strawberries and rhubarb.  next time I will do a little less sugar.  I am used to a sweet and tart pie, this one was mostly just sweet and not very tart.  So next time I will reduce the sugar a little.
Thanks for a great recipe!

I'd make this pie again, I don't think that it was very runny at all.  Make sure to let it sit once you've mixed with the flour and sugar before you bake it.

As others have said, this pie is VERY runny after being cooked.  The taste was very good, but the runny-ness would make me alter the recipe before I used it again.

I made this for my mother on Mothers day (its her favoite flavor of pie)  She said that it was the best Rhubarb pie that she has had.  I will make this again!  I let the pie sit in the fridge over night and the pie was not runny.

I gave this 4 stars because I followed the recipe exactly, waited a day, and then sliced and it was still runny.  I should have taken the advice from others and added corn starch to thicken.  Other than that, the flavor was really good and perfect with vanilla ice cream.

Excellent!  Followed the recipe exactly and was not disappointed - wasn't at all runny or mushy. Perfect blend of tart and sweet - the lattice top was especially impressive and worth the extra effort. I enjoyed the rave reviews "my" pie received this Easter...thanks for sharing!

As a kid, I never liked rhubarb but this pie with the strawberries was exceptionally good. I did add just a little more sugar than called for but everything else remained the same.  Excellent recipe, five stars all the way.

Pretty tasty stuff. I used a crumb topping (oats, sugar and a bit of brown sugar corn syrup) instead of a pie crust top and I enjoyed it more that way. I also used frozen strawberries that I had in the freezer and had to adjust the cooking time, but otherwise it worked nicely and tasted really good.

This was a disaster.  The filling was so watery and the sugar crust burned. The filling is tasty though.

funny how everyone loves this pie but very rarely does anyone make them! My family loved this pie warm with vanilla icecream.  I'm sure that since berries vary across the country the baker will need to use judgement on cornstarch. Mine came out perfect without.  It was runny when we ate it the first day,, no patience to wait for it to cool, but after a night in the fridge it was perfect for slicing.

This was good...my fiance loved it but I thought it was soso. I added a teaspoon of cornstarch to ensure it wasnt too watery...only my fruit filling had NO water! It was kind of gooey but I think it was because the strawberries were not too ripe/juicy. The tartness and sweetness of the strawberries were good combination. I did however think the bottom of the pie was a tad too mushy. My first time cooking with Rhubarb and I took the advice of others and chopped the Rhubarb to about 1/4 inch to ensure it cooked all the way through. 
All in All pretty good and I would make again! thanks :)

This was the runniest pie I've ever made, so it was a big disappointment.  I couldn't find the recipe I had used before for strawberry rhubarb pie, so I went with this one, but I won't again.  Other than the runniness, the flavor was good -- sweet and tart.

I made this pie twice in the same week. Everyone who had it loved it!  I did decrease the sugar to 3/4 cup though.  Definately a keeper!!

My husband had told my mother that he LOVED rhubarb pie. First, I barely cook and second, what is a rhubarb? .. I followed this recipe exactly. My husband couldn't stop bragging on me. 
He called my mom and told her that I had baked one 'heck' of a pie. He ate all but one slice which he saved for my mom. Mom has never had rhubarb pie but she loved it too.

This is my first rhubarb pie and I'm very happy with it. I'm not a baking person and I didn't need to be for this easy recipe. I loved the color of the crust from the egg yolk, it looked so nice I hated to cut it :o) Thanks for sharing!

Simply delicious!! Just the right amount of sweet and tart.  The pie itself looks great, with the shiny golden crust on top.  I precooked the rhubarb before adding to strawberries as someone here suggested, and the pie was fantastic!! Thanks!

If you put more rhubarb than strawberries in this recipe, then you will need to add just a little more sugar.

I was a little nervous making this for my husband, since he had such fond memories of his grandmother's rhubarb recipes....this is now his all-time favorite pie! And I was surprised, I don't like rhubarb, or strawberries, and I liked it too! Thanks so much!

This was simply amazing.  So little preparation with amazing results.  I used a cross-hatch design for the top crust and it cooked, looked, and tasted just magnificent.  I'll use this one for YEARS to come.

I made this pie myself and it’s outstanding. To all the whiners out there...It’s supposed to be tart!! You don’t cook the Rhubarb ahead,  that’s absurd. If you’re unsure why your pie sucked, ask a question. Don’t trash the recipe because you’re inept!

I made this for Thanksgiving!  My grandpas favorite pie is strawberry rhubarb.  I took a few suggestions (like buying frozen cut rhubarb at Sprouts).  I mostly followed the recipe and didn’t pre-cook anything.  I rinsed the frozen rhubarb and weeded out the larger thicker looking chunks.  Tossed it with the strawberries then tossed them with the sugar and flour, AND LET SIT FOR THE FULL 30 MINUTES.  I did alter cooking to 15 minutes at 425 and then 350 for 40 minutes, and had the crust edge covered until the last 15 minutes.  I did the egg/sugar on the crust... and I did sprinkle cinnamon and nutmeg over the topping before placing the upper crust since it’s fall.  I followed the suggestion of doing lattice to allow steam out, I also baked it the night before and didn’t cut it for near 24 hours.  It was PERFECT!!!  No flour flavor, rhubarb was all soft and tangy (not sour), and the pie held together while being cut and served!  I’m so happy, will definitely be doing this one again!

This is a great recipe!  I did precook the rhubarb with a little squeezed lemon juice and 2 Tablespoons of sugar.  I also used a lattice crust and let it sit for a few hours.  Not runny at all.  Just super yummy and really pretty too!

The pie was easy to make and tasted delicious! I even had a skeptical person in the 'taste test' group have a slice (with ice cream on top) and she loved it!  Since this was the first time I made it, I made it as the recipe dictated but did not sprinkle the  2 Tbsp. of sugar on the top crust. 1 Tbsp. was sufficient to give it that nice sparkle but yet not overwhelm the look of the crust.

This is my new favourite pie!  All of my guests loved it. I forgot to put the butter in, but it was still very good. You couldn’t tell anything was missing.  But next time I will try it with the butter to compare. Thank you for the delicious recipe. It’s a keeper!

The first time I made it was a little runny. The next time I substituted 2 Tbl of Tapioca Granules for the flour, great results. I used 14 oz of Rhubarb, reduced in sauce pan with some sugar  to release some water. Added 3/4 t Cinnamon, 1/4t nutmeg and squeeze of lemon

I made this pie with a lattice top. From all I have read,  this pie usually turns out runny so after letting the fruit sit with sugar and flour, I strained out the liquid before putting it into the pie. It baked beautifully.  The pie was nice and tart  and my coworkers loved it!

Simple, easy recipe.  My only change was cornstarch instead of flour, I substituted one half the amount of flour with cornstarch. So if the recipe calls for two tablespoons of flour, use one tablespoon of cornstarch.  Same ratio if you used tapioca.  The pie with the egg yoke wash looked beautiful when done and tasted delicious.

This is the first pie I’ve ever tried making and I have to say it made me look like a pro! I followed the recipe exactly how it is and yes there was a lot of liquid. I didn’t cut into it until the next day and by then it was perfect, not too overly runny or soggy. I also made sure to chop the rhubarb in smaller pieces to avoid them being overly crunchy, about 1/4” did the job. I will definitely be making this again!

This pie had very good flavor BUT it was very soggy. I followed directions but when I cut  into the pie after letting it rest for 6 hrs. it was like soup. The good thing was that leftovers thickened up after sitting for a day.If I make it again I will either add more cornstarch, start baking at a higher temperature and/or let the pie rest longer before cutting into it.

We thoroughly enjoyed this. Made w flour it takes some time to cool and thicken, but we enjoyed it warm and slightly runny alamode. The crust just didnt want to cook, was barely done, but that was another recipe. The fruit turned out with a perfect blend of sweet and tart. Thank you!

I simmered my fresh rhubarb to break down the fibres and try to remove some moisture. Even with that the pie poured out sweet sticky red syrup as it cooked, I am so glad that I placed a lined baking sheet under it.

I've made strawberry-rhubarb "soup" in the past.  Thanks to the previous reviewers, I now know what my problem has always been.  I've cut into the pie way too soon.  I followed this recipe, cut big vents in the upper crust, left the pie in the oven after it was shut off for about 1 hour, let it cool on the counter for another hour, and then put it in the refrigerator for 4 hours and it came out with perfect consistency.  The strawberries I used were not very sweet so it was a little more tart than I like.  But that was a strawberry issue, not a recipe issue. My family loved it the way it was.   I will definitely use this recipe again.

4 stalks of rhubarb (4 cups) not too bitter, sliced down middle and then into small pieces.

strawberries were very ripe, but not overly sweet. cut in half or quarters. 1 quart (4 cups)

Reduced sugar to about 3/4 cup in and 1 & 1/2 Tbsp on top

Use crisco crust ( could probably do refrigerated store bought or amish one)

Baked at 400 for 30 min and still VERY undercooked. put foil on edges and reduced to 375 for another 15-20 min. Check at 5 min intervals

cool COMPLETELY before cutting. Best if made day before 

Would absolutely make again!!

I made this with a streusel topping instead of a top crust. My family prefers this type of pie. I added a tablespoon of cornstarch to the filling along with the flour. My strawberries were homegrown as was the rhubarb. Great way to use up the smaller strawberries.  Perfect with ice cream!

Followed the directions exactly! I weighed out 1 lb of strawberries before chopping up and then the 4 lbs of rhubarb, which turned out to be 4 cups of chopped. Made it the day before serving and it wasn’t runny. Got rave reviews. Definitely will make this again.

I have the ingredients all mixed together. Just waiting my 30 minutes to put it in the oven. This is a nice simple recipe- while searching the internet, others asked for tapioca or vanilla or brown sugar. This one seems to let the fruit do the flavoring.
The one comment I have- Step 1 says to preheat the oven to 400. Step 2 is mix the ingredients and wait 30 minutes. I feel like it is a waste of electricity or gas to have the oven on for that long. My suggestion is, start preheating the oven when the 30 minutes is up, then it will get up to temperature while you are filling the crust, coating it with the egg, etc.

This was a pretty good recipe. I made some changes to it and think it made it a lot better. First, I would totally recommend adding nutmeg to the strawberry and rhubarb mixture and let it sit the full thirty minutes . Second, sprinkle sugar along the bottom of the pie crust. Third, sprinkle cinnamon along the top of the strawberry mixture faster putting it in the pie crust. Fourth, there is no need to brush the crust with egg yolk of sprinkle sugar on the top of the top pie crust. Also, make sure there are lots of holes in the top pie crust by doing a lattice crust or cutting slits all around. You do not need to cover the top with aluminum foil but you should let the pie sit in the oven for as long as possible (preferably about thirty minutes ) after you are finished baking it. 
If you do all this, the pie will not be runny and it will have a great flavor. 



Happy Baking!

I made this with gluten free crust and GF all-purpose flour and it was delicious.  I didn't have any trouble with the rhubarb not cooking all the way through, as others said. I chopped my rhubarb into small pieces and they were fully cooked.

Made it just like the recipe said.  I used 3 cups of each, however that didn't get me a well-rounded top.  Next time, I'd add at least another 1/2 c of rhubarb to get more of a tangy flavor.

This is a good basic recipe but I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and the grates  zest of one lemon. Instead of the flour I added 1/3 cup of tapioca plus a tablespoon to 3 1/2 cups quartered strawberries, 4 cups rhubarb( half frozen, half fresh) and 1 1/4 cups sugar and 1/4 c. brown sugar. My strawberries were not very sweet . I mixed the rhubarb, strawberry, sugar and tapioca, zest and cinnamon  together and let it marinate while I rolled out the dough. I chilled the dough for 10 minutes then added the fruit and put a lattice top on the fruit. I covered the edge with foil and baked  on bottom rack of oven at 425  F degree oven for 15 minutes then transferred pie to foil lined cookie sheet , lowered oven temp to 350 and baked until crust was browned and bubbly.

SO YUMMY!! We picked our own organic strawberries, so they were so tart and beautiful with the rhubarb. We made our own crust as well, so it’s not terribly beautiful, but it was DELICIOUS

Wow!  Delicious and easy to make.  I used Pillsbury Crusts and they worked fine.  Next time I might decrease the sugar a bit to bring out the tartness of the rhubarb.  We agreed that vanilla ice cream is the perfect accompaniment.  I like Trader Joe's. 
Will definitely make again.  The pie looked so lovely. too.

Just the right amount of sweet and tart for me!  Followed proportions to a tee.  Even used a scale to weigh the rhubarb and good thing I did because I measured out 2 cups and it was only .6 pounds.  So I added more rhubarb.  I sprinkled the pie with coarse raw brown sugar after brushing with egg yolk.  I actually cooked it until the juices started to bubble out of the slits cut into the top crust which was about 5 minutes longer than instructions. (Ovens can vary). Then I let it cool very slowly in the oven with the oven turned off but still warm and oven door shut as recommended by another review I saw.  After an hour, I took it out of the oven and let cool on a wire rack until no longer warm.  Then covered and refrigerated. We cut into it the following day and pieces came out picture perfect!  Not runny and the pieces stood on their own like a pic out of a magazine!  Amazing, crispy, flaky and filling was perfect consistency and just the right amount of sugar!

I feel that a crust can make or break a pie so make sure you use a great crust recipe.  I used the Crisco recipe for the double crust but I did increase the volume by half on all ingredients since my pie plate was a little larger.  And then brushed it with eggs yolk and sprinkled with raw sugar.

I will definitely make again. Fresh rhubarb from the garden can't be beat. I added a pinch of salt and a tsp of vanilla and it turned out sooooo good. I baked it with aluminium around the edges and removed it for the last 10 minutes of baking.

This pie is perfect as is. Make sure to let your filling sit for 30 minutes prior to baking. Cut your rhubarb into approximately 1/4 inch pieces. Use 3 cups strawberries and 3 cups rhubarb. Let sit in oven for 15 min after baking with oven door cracked. Let your pie sit for at least a half day prior to eating also. You will not be disappointed! PS I stole all these ideas from different reviews.

The flavor was outstanding but, then, what can go wrong when you combine strawberries with rhubarb?  I followed the recipe to a 'T' and it was like cutting into a soup sandwich.  I even let it set for 4 hours (totally cooled) before cutting into it:(  But, I didn't let that stop me so I tried it again.  This time I substituted raspberries and blueberries (no strawberries in the house) and even added an extra 1/8 cup of flour because the raspberries were giving off a lot of juice.  It was much better, but still not perfect. :(  Will try one more time but will use corn starch instead of flour and see what kind of result that  brings. I used my own pie crust from this site:  Easy Vodka Pie Crust...it's the best!!

I made it as written.  I would suggest 2 1/2 cups of cut up strawberries and the same for the cut up rhubarb. I did let it stand for nearly an hour  in the sugar/flour mixture (by accident) and poured off some the liquid off before placing the fruit into the pie plate. I read one review that said to turn off the oven at the end of the baking period and leave the pie in the overnight for 15 minutes. It was delicious! Not runny at all.

Delicious! The pie did take longer to bake than the recipe calls for since at 35 minutes the crust was still pale and it was not bubbling yet.  I baked it at 400 degrees for closer to 50-55  minutes and then turned the oven off and left it in the oven for another 10 minutes. I cooled it for a couple of hours and it was perfect! I added a bit of cinnamon and a dash of vanilla to the filling before baking.

This pie had just the right amount of sweetness and tartness, and this was the second time I've made it. It is now my "go to" recipe.  I did leave it in the oven a bit longer than 35 minutes, maybe 45 all together.

loved it! I read other reviews and cooked the filling. this was my first time making a pie so I wasn't sure exactly what I was doing. I also didn't realize I didn't have all purpose flour so had to substitute with bread flour... worked out amazing still!

I found the filling did not thicken at the time and temperature given.  I use a convection oven, which if anything should shorten the bake time. The filling came out runny, a bit undercooked, with whitish liquid just flowing out. 

Two ways I might handle this in the next pie: 

First, precooking the filling before baking until it thickens might be the fastest and surest way, spooning it hot into the pie shell and then cooking it at high temperature to brown the crust.

Or  lower the heat to 350 and bake until the middle of the pie gets above 200F so that the flour can thicken the filling. This might take up to 1 1/2 hours.

My results with the original recipe: 
After the pie turned out disappointingly runny, I chopped it up, put chopped up crust and filling  in a new pie crust, and rebaked it using the second method. Now it's more like a cobbler in a crust, but it is much better than before.

We followed this recipe exactly, with a lattice-top.  The bottom crust was soggy.  Next time, we'd pre-cook that bottom crust a bit before loading it up.

This pie was awesome! I did not make any modifications. After reading other reviews I was concerned about the rhubarb not cooking all the way. I did not remove thin layer of skin, but I did slice the rhubarb 1/4 to 1/2 an inch thick. I had large strawberries and quartered them. I made my own double crust. See Pie Crust IV on Allrecipes. Great pie crust, too!

I just made this-this afternoon. There is probably a cup of liquid sitting in the bottom of the pie, leaving the bottom shell like gum.  I am reading peoples reviews and this seems a common issue. The recipe I liked because of its simplicity. Hubby would like less sugar, I am not certain as if the rhubarb were actually cooked first as many did their 2nd try I am thinking the pie would be tarter, as now it is sweet liquid with sour semi crunchie rhubarb and strawberries. Sad I took pics cause my crust was awesome looking and I was proud of my 1st try, til we cut it.....

The ease of ingredients (especially if you use a pre-made crust) surprisingly produced a great pie! I used more fruit because I knew it would otherwise sink in the middle, and created the lattice work crust. Definitely needed the pan on the lower shelf to catch drips. Company asked for the recipe so that's a great compliment!

Agree with the previous two comments. The filling was too runny, so I would add cornstarch next time. Also, the rhubarb was not fully cooked. I will freeze the next batch of rhubarb and that should help when I make the next pie. Also, I would add l little more sugar.

The filling is excellent but 35-40 min wasn't a long enough baking time, my bottom crust wasn't cooked through and I cooked it a full 40 min.  Perhaps I need to put it on a lower rack (it was on a middle rack) but I think baking it for 50 min with foil over the top to prevent over-browning would be better.  Or perhaps 375 for an hour.  Not sure, I'll have to look at other fruit pie recipes.  Also the filling still was slightly cloudy as I don't think the flour in the filling cooked long enough to go clear.

The taste is great but way too much liquid remained even after refrigerating the pie for a few hours.  I literately poured some liquid out of the pie before serving. Next time I will lattice the crust and see what happens.

Did the recipe exactly as shown with 3 cups of rhybarb and 3 cups of strawberries.
It had a excellent flavour, and the rhubarb cooked perfectly,  I cut mine about 1/2" and they were nice thin stalks,  I think it wouldn't have cooked good if you use thick woody stalks.
We will be keeping this receipe for sure.

I added a bit of lemon juice to it to bring out the flavors more. I always double the recipe & make 3 pies as 1 batch seems a little too big for one pie.

I didn't use any sugar in this recipe and it still turned out delicious.  It tastes more like a tart treat this way and less of a dessert, but is a perfect and healthy light treat for hot summer days. Easy and yummy recipe.

I read through the various reviews preparing me for making this pie. I followed the advice of leaving the pie in the turned off oven once cooked. This pie received rave reviews from my hubby who just loves strawbarb pie. The pie was not runny at all, very good clean flavours with just enough tart & sweet. Will certainly make this again.

The first time I made this, I omitted the egg yolk wash and sugar on the crust.  It came out of the oven looking fantastic and everyone raved over the taste.   Today I made it again, with the egg yolk wash and sugar.  It looks terrible.  Really terrible.  The egg yolk weakened the crust and the crust split open in several places leaving pieces of fruit exposed.  I like the proportion of sugar and flour.  I have used egg white wash on pastries before; I will never use egg yolk again.

I should have read more of the reviews for this recipe before making it.  It was very runny and the bottom crust did not cook well at all.  I was so excited and then disappointed.  It was not quite sweet enough and a good 25% of the rhubarb was still crunchy.  I cooked it a good 40 minutes and had I cooked it any longer the top would have been too brown.  I also felt like I could taste the egg wash.  Not happy.  I had really high hopes.  I"ll just find another recipe!

highly recommended. It turned out awesome! Instead of using fresh strawberries, I kept my fresh strawberries for garnish and use 16 oz Dole frozen whole strawberries instead. I used 4 small disposable foil tray (5") and baked for 35 minutes then took it out to brush with the remaining egg white (we brushed it with yolk so white was left as by product). 1 recipe is not enough to do criss cross top so my pie only covered partially. After brushing with egg white, I put it back to bake for 5 more minutes. Glossier crunchier when finished. Then let chilled till completely cool.

I followed the recommendation of a previous reviewer.  I followed the recipe and after 35 minutes baking, turned off the oven and allowed the pie to "rest" in the oven for 20 minutes.  Turned out perfect!

This pie was scrumptious!!  Just the right amount of sweetness and tartness!  I used 4 cups of chopped rhubarb and 4 cups of fresh, early variety strawberries from our garden, which are small in size, but very tasty and sweet in their own right.  What a great combination!  I added 2 Tbsp. of tapioca to the sugar and flour before stirring the mixture into the fruit  and letting it sit for 30 minutes, as directed in the recipe.  As another reviewer suggested, I baked the pie at 425 degrees for 15 minutes and then lowered the oven temperature to 375 degrees for 35-40 minutes.  It turned out perfectly - not at all runny - and was delicious served with vanilla ice cream.   This will be my go-to recipe for Strawberry-Rhubarb pie from now on!

Followed the recipe to the letter - Outcome was not good. The pie was too soupy and the crust under cooked on the base. The Rhubarb was tart and not cooked enough.

Changed the following for 5 Stars: 
1 Cup of Rhubarb, 5 Cups of Strawberries. 
Oven 425 degrees for 45 mins (using Pillsbury pie crust)

Absolutely AMAZING! For those of us who do not have scales or are not American, 1 pound of rhubarb equals 3 cups of rhubarb, and 2 pints of strawberries equals 4 cups of strawberries.
Thank you so much.
PERFECT recipe!
FYI: I followed the Tenderflake lard recipe for the pie crust. Yummy!

Filling was ridiculously running and the rhubarb undercooked. I knew I should have cooked it beforehand, but in spirit of following the exact recipe I did not.  And by runny, I mean it was ridiculously soupy!

With No Fail Pie Crust III this was a fantastic and simple recipe.  Delicious! Only change was to slightly reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup.

I followed other recommendations and didn't use the flour. I mixed 1/4 cup of water with 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and added that to the berries, rhubarb and sugar and cooked it all together for 30 minutes before pouring the filling into the pie crust. Next time, I will use a little less sugar--maybe half the amount. Otherwise, this was delicious!

My husband has always been staunchly against strawberry rhubarb pies.  He prefers straight up rhubarb.  I went to make him one but sadly did not have enough rhubarb.  So I thought, why not give it a try since I had strawberries on hand.  And he loved it!  Sweet and tangy and so very good!

wow, this is only the 2nd recipe with such high remarks that completely bombed on this site.
I made this recipe as written despite knowing that the rhubarb should be precooked with loads of sugar and that cornstarch or tapioca should've been used.
Well, when I finally went to cut into the pie after the cooling period, tons of liquid came oozing out, all over the counter! What a mess! Plus, the rhubarb was tart. Nobody liked it.
I wrapped it back up in foil after adding some tapioca to it and have it basking a second time...hopefully it will help as I love strawberry-rhubarb!

Made the pie exactly as recipe instructed. I left my pie about 15-20 min longer in the oven at 400F because the top crust was still pale. Let it cool and enjoy! Delicious with vanilla ice cream!!! A keeper for sure!

While there is nothing unusual about the recipe it always gets rave reviews. I suspect it is the use of materials fresh from the garden. Plus the butter dots, egg yoke and sugar sprinkles give it extra appeal.  Nice!

My dad and husband give this a "superb" rating! I used fresh strawberries and frozen sliced rhubarb. After letting the fruit set for a half hour with the sugar and flour, I drained off the excess liquid. Also used a lattice top crust. The cooked filling was relatively firm, and we all LOVED it! Thanks for sharing.

I added a little more cornstarch and about a tablespoon of flour. I also drained some of the juice before filling the pie shell. It turned out delicious.

I followed the recipe and instructions, except all I had at hand was brown sugar so I used that instead. I used 2 Tenderflake pie crusts, the second one I used as the pie's lattice top. Loved it, I'll surely be making this over and over again while rhubarb and strawberries are still in season.

This was very tasty! I followed the instructions exactly, and the pie came out delicious, not at all runny, and just sweet enough to overcome the natural tartness of the rhubarb. Great recipe! I'm not good with pints and such, so I just kept chopping strawberries and rhubarb until I had about 9 cups of fruit for a large pie.  Deelish.

This recipe is perfect on its own. I made no changes. I made a lattice top so there was no problem at all with moisture. It didn't make the bottom pastry heavy at all. This recipe is definitely the new favourite!

This recipe was so simple and easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly as is and it came out perfect! Not runny at all.  The first time I made it was with freshly picked strawberries and rhubarb. The second time I made it was with frozen strawberries. I thought it might come out runny but to my surprise it was not runny at all. Perect consistency. This is my go to recipe for strawberry rhubarb pie!

First time trying strawberry rhubarb pie. Followed the recipe to a T, but the pie came out extremely runny. Taste was pretty good, but the pie was literally a soup. Luckily I have a large pie pan because the ingredients would have overflowed as well. I'm not a good enough baker to know how to correct the runniness , so I won't be using this recipe again.

What a great recipe!  After reading many reviews I used 3 cups of both rhubarb and strawberries. Make sure the pieces are 1/4 inch and let the flour sugar mix sit with the fruit for 30 minutes, as directed. The filling was delicious not too sweet and tasty.  The pie did bake longer, until the filling was bubbling. For those of us who have a higher ( I call sweetameter) I would add a little more sugar 2T and 2 T flour. I used a healthy pie crust which turned out crispy on the even on the bottom layer. That was 2c flour, 1/2 c canola oil, 1/2 t salt, 5 T water...mix and roll out between wax paper.  Allrecipes is awesome!

Delicious!!  I love the tart flavor!  I used 3.5 cups strawberries and 3 cups rhubarb.  As others suggested, I cut the rhubarb 1/4 inches thick.   
Some thought the pie was too runny - I followed the recipe in regards to the amount of flour and letting it sit with sugar, berries and rhubarb for 30 minutes.  
 I used a lattice for the top crust and let it cool in the oven.  I think this helped a lot.
Will definitely make again!

Excellent recipe. I used 3 cups of each of the rhubarb and strawberries. I added 1/4 cup small tapioca granules as well. I baked at 425 for 15 minutes with edges foiled and then removed the foil and reduced the heat to 375 and baked for an additional 45 minutes. Turned out perfect and not at all runny.

My first rhubarb strawberry pie and it was excellent....after letting the filling sit for 30 minutes,  I poured about half the liquid out and I was glad that I did.... the pie set perfectly... also I pre baked the bottom crust and it stayed flaky and light!  This recipe is a keeper!

So runny you need a soup spoon and a straw.  After the mixture sits, drain everything.  Also, maybe a little more flour??

I changed the amounts of fruit so that I used 2 lbs each of rhubarb and strawberries as I had a deep dish pie pan. I used 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup flour, 1/4 tsp salt and a 1 tsp vanilla powder.
I made a lattice top, brushed with cream and sprinkled with sugar. I think the reason why some were having issues is the baking temperature and time. I baked at 425 for 15 minutes, reduced to 375 for another 30 minutes, turned off the oven and let sit for 30 minutes more, I loosely covered with foil after the first 20 minutes to prevent overbrowning. The pie was perfect! My husband enjoyed his Father's Day pie as this is his favourite. I used Buttery Flaky Pie Crust from AR for my crust.

Everyone raved about it! I followed some of the suggestions and cooked the rhubarb ahead with some corn starch, butter, and sugar and omitted the flour. Easy and excellent! Would definitely make again.

Should have used cornstarch mixed with 1 T of water instead of flour.  Butter not necessary and sugar can be reduced depending on how tart you like your pie.  This amount was too much.  I didn't like the egg yolk on top and the cook time was not long enough.  should have been about 1 hour to make sure the rhubarb is completely cooked.  Some say they precook their rhubarb, but you shouldn't have to.  Fruit pies should be easy - season fruit, thicken slightly and pour into the crust and bake.

Great recipe. I read the  reviews and saw people had issues with the pie being watery, a common problem with rhubarb. Easy fix - add 2 beaten eggs to the filling. Perfect pie!

Easy to make and really yummy.  The best ever!   I made it with the lattice top and then a few days latter with a regular top.  As long as you let  the fruit mixture sit for at least a half hour before  you put it the pie crust and then let it sit for at least a half hour when it is down, it is not runny.

I made this for my boyfriend who has wanted it because his Grandmother made it with her recipe.  WELL, he really liked it!!  I am not a pie maker, and cheated on the crust and got  2 already made, and used one for the lattice, so it does not look so good, but, it tasted great!!  I did steam the rhubarb for a couple of minutes first, just in case another reviewers thought  was true.

Best strawberry rhubarb pie I've ever had!  I didn't use the egg yolk on the crust - just brushed it with butter.  The sugar on top of the pie makes the lattice perfect!  I used fresh rhubarb and frozen strawberries.  Worked perfectly - but needed a bit of extra time.

Very good, only thing I did differently is cooked it at 400 for 15 minutes then @375 for 40 minutes.  Then turned off the oven and left it in for about 25 minutes. Let cool and had no problems with it being runny.

I would bake the bottom crust a little to avoid the soggy bottom that I ended up with. The flavors where good though!

Loved it even after I forgot to add the butter before putting on top crust. I  did however think to add some orange rind zest to the mixture which made it "ppp". Also my store-bought  crust, made, shiny,  brown and ymmny with egg yolk and sugar was a knock out. Will cook this great recipe again soon!!

Made this into tart shells as I didn't have a pie shell.  Covered with basic brown sugar/butter crumble.  
Very delicious, and just the right size.

I added 1 tbsp corn starch to help thicken the liquid and did not add the butter. It was delicious. I was glad I could let the rubarb sit for 30 minutes to help soften the rubarb. I have never made the combo pie and it was not bad at all. Could have baked it a little longer as I used a stone pie pan and the crust was a little underdone.

Is anyone reading this recipe? It states using 2 T of sugar mixed with flour, not the 1 C of sugar stated in the written  recipe.  Disastrous results if you use 2T of sugar!

This was so delicious!! So simple too. I would've given a 5, but didn't because of a few modifications that helped. I let the fruit/flour/sugar mixture sit for about an hour (got interrupted) so it was very runny. I drained about 1/3 cup of the "juice" and added about 2-3 tbsp corn starch to the juice, then added it back it's the fruit mixture. I also did a crumb topping because that's our preference (1/2 c flour, 1/4 c sugar, 1/4 c cold butter). Then baked at 425 for 15 minutes and turned down to 375 for 30 minutes. It turned out perfect! Will make again!

Very good. But I had to bake it an extra 15 minutes, until I could see that the filling was bubbling. I did add a tsp. of vanilla and some fresh ground pepper. Don't know why, just thought of it, and it was really good!

I saw some reviews that complained about the rhubarb not being fully cooked.  My solution is that the pastry recipe I use can withstand about an hour in a 400 degree oven, so I baked it for about 55-60 min.  I also added a little cinnamon and about a tablespoon and a half of tapioca, which helped it set up beautifully.

After mixing the strawberries and rhubarb with the sugar, flour, I would cook this on the stove over medium heat until thickened.  It doesn't get hot enough in the pie so it turned out soupy.

I did change the amount of water to 1/2 c after reading some reviews. I just wanted to be sure that the filling would thicken up. It worked perfectly and tasted amazing!

I have made this pie several times.  It is so good that I freeze rhubarb in the summer so that I can make pies in the winter, too.  I am surprised to read that people cook the rhubarb in advance.  I have never done this; I bake a 2 crust pie; and it is always done when I finish the baking process.  I like this recipe with the strawberries because they add sweetness to the recipe without the sense that you have added more sugar.  As for these reviewers whose pies did not finish cooking, I can only wonder whether it is a function of the oven temperature.  I do bake mine about 15 minutes longer than the recipe requires.  And I allow the pie to set for several hours to reduce the runny juice problem.

This turned out great! I chopped my rhubarb and strawberries very small and used 2c of each.  I left out the butter and brushed my crust with milk instead of egg whites.  I let the pie sit in the oven for 45 to cool as others mentioned. It was think and delicious!  Definitely a keeper!

I made the recipe exactly as written and it tasted terrible. Too much flour maybe? It was also pretty runny when I cut into it, despite letting it completely cool.

This pie, while a start of a great idea does need to be thicker. I suggest chopping the rhubarb then add 3 tablespoons quick cooking tapioca , mix in with other ingredients and let set 15 minutes to blend before putting into pie shell. It will not be as runny then. Remember for a good bottom crust to chill before adding the mixture.

I halved the recipe and made it in a smaller rectangle tart pan, it ended up being not enough filling for the pan size, but thats my bad... 
It was a simple recipe with ingredients I had on hand, but a little too simple for me perhaps. I skipped the dots of extra butter on the filling and topped with a dash of cinnamon and splash of vanilla for depth of flavour. I had no issues of too much liquid, probably because I did not add the extra butter. The fruit sat in the flour sugar for 40 mins while I prepped the tart crust and it thickened right up. I ended up baking it for 40/45 mins as my tart crust was thick. I then left it in the oven turned off for another 15 mins then threw it right in the fridge to set. It was moist but not a chance of any liquid spilling out when we cut it 3 hours later it was totally set. Guests loved it.

I made this pie exactly as the recipe called for.  I used fresh rhubarb and frozen strawberries.  It was not runny as some other people indicated.  It will be a recipe I will be returning to again.  It had a wonderful taste - not too tart or too sweet.

I made this with premade crust from the market.  I followed another reviewer's idea of mix sugar and rhubarb on stove top with cornstarch until thickened.  Added the berries, butter and crust.  Did not lattice the crust. Just the right amount of sweetness.  Not too tart or too sweet

Wow wow wow. Delicious pie. This was my first try at strawberry rhubarb. I made it just as the recipe  called for and used a lattice top like others suggested. Three cups of each is also a wonderful suggestion. It set up great after a couple hour cool. I used "Ruth's grandmas pie crust" also from this site. It's the bomb too.

Went with other reviewer's modifications and used:  3 cups each of strawberries and rhubarb (chop 1/4 inch pieces). Didn't use the flour but instead mixed 1/4 cup of water with 2 Tbsp cornstarch and let it sit with the berries, rhubarb and sugar for 30 minutes. Baked the pie for 15 minutes at 425 then 40 minutes at 375. Let the pie cool for 3-4 hours or overnight before cutting so it's not runny.

I followed the recipe except I used frozen rhubarb out of necessity. My pie did not set as much as it should have. That was a result of the frozen rhubarb preventing the pie from cooking at a proper temp as well as the extra water released by the frozen fruit. This recipe calls for too much flour. Next time I make this I will use 3 cups of strawberries, 3 T of cornstarch and flour each. Also, the pie was a little too tart for my taste. I will add a 1 1/4 cup of sugar next time.

I made this for pie in honor of Pi day (3.14).  I added some fresh orange zest to the filling and totally forgot to add the butter .  Cooked it until bubbly and nicely browned.  
Absolutely delicious. Filling was perfect consistency, just the right tart/sweet combination with a hint of orange.  Everyone loved it.   Will make it again.

Like everybody said way too runny, I followed the recipe to the T, And it was still too runny I was wondering if we put a tablespoon of cornstarch in with the flour and sugar would this thicken it up as it cooked? but everything else about it was good a little too sweet.
I even let it sit at room temperature for the full 30 minutes. Had no problem with the rhubarb he could just fine but I cut it up in small cubes.

I found this recipe had a couple of flaws.  First, as others have mentioned, it is too runny as written. The next time I will eliminate the butter, and try the corn starch others suggested.  The suggested cooking time was not quite enough for the top of the pie in my oven, more like 45 minutes.  Don't forget to shield the edges, as I almost did!  I do not understand pre-cooking the rhubarb.  If you pull off any outside strings that are tough when you cut the stalks, and chop the rhubard in 1/4 in. chunks, it will soften just fine.

I followed the recipe exactly.  Turned out beautiful, the yolk gives it a golden shine.  I baked it for 38 minutes, let it cool for 8 hours.  It was SO runny and the rhubarb was crunchy, very disappointing.  The flavor was still great, but unappealing with the crunchiness.  I will probably try a similar recipe but will precook the rhubarb or bake longer.

Very good pie.  Made it for a party for work many said it was the best they ever had.  Gave it a 3 because It was a little runny not bad for a rhubarb pie though.

I tried this recipe.. taste was good.. soggy crust factor didn't work for me. I know people say that strawberry rhubarb pie is suppose to have a "wetness" . I did a lattice top to allow for extra drying... the next time I will strain the liquid made from the fruit and try thickening it in a skillet with more cornstarch then return to the pie with fruit. And will most likely brown the bottom crust a bit too.

I've made this pie twice with no modifications and it was perfect every time! I agree with everybody who says the filling needs to set for 30 minutes and leave the pie in the oven after its done with the oven OFF and you will not have a runny pie. So easy to make and delicious to eat!

I made this yesterday and it was a huge hit! I added some tapioca( about a 1/4 cup), made a lattice crust topping and baked it for a bit longer(about an extra 20 min with tin foil over it) and it turned out perfect! Definately a keeper:)

I made this pie exactly how the recipe directs.  The pie tastes great, but was really runny (like strawberry rhubarb soup).  I suggest taking steps identified in others' comments to cut down the juice.

I made this for my husbands family never having tasted one for myself... I didn't realize I would be compared against someone in their family who made hers "the best" for years... I was at delight when it was the continual talk of the night... amazing and "perfect"! It is still the talk of my baking skills. :)

This was very good.  I definitely have to take one of the other reviewers advice and finely chop the rhubarb.  My pieces were too large and it would have been better had they been smaller.  I'll also use more strawberries next time.  Overall it was very good.

I found this recipe to be excellent., I did add 1/4 tsp more of the corn starch...It was excellent. One thing I learned is that one needs to let the pie cool completly on a wire rack...when it is warm it will run. I put mine in the frig after 1 hour of cooling off completly. I let it sit for 45 minutes. My family loved it

Fantastic pie and beginner friendly. (I made it and it tasted great, and I had never made a pie before in my life!)  I would love to make a bunch while rhubarb is still in season, but I don't think we could possibly eat it all... I wonder if it would freeze well?  It would be nice to have this summer treat in the middle of winter.

I followed directions and filling was great but pie crust needed to be cooked longer than 35 minutes.  I also let pie set in warm oven for 20 minutes after baking.  I may try again and precook the bottom crust slightly so it's not doughy.

WOW!!! This pie was absolutely amazing.. first time I had ever eaten or made a rhubarb pie of any kind.  Changes I made: used half brown sugar and half white, because that's all I had. Refrigerated filling for longer, because I had to wait on the oven. Replace 1 cup strawberries with 1 cup blueberries, because I had them and it sounded good. Great flavor, great amount of sweetness without being overwhelming, and mine was not runny at all. I think refrigerating it makes a world of difference.

Great recipe! I cut the rhubarb really fine (not thicker than 1/4") and it cooked perfectly, no precooking or cornstarch needed. I wrapped the edges with foil at the beginning and baked 10-12 minutes longer -- the consistency was perfect, the pie held together when cut and wasn't runny like some people complained. I did add just a bit more sugar, because it all depends on your berries and rhubarb--both were too tart for me. Also, didnt do the top crust--just a lattice top. Helped it cook better, I believe...Anyways, it came out gorgeous--A definite keeper!

I took the advice and used 3 cups rhubarb and three cups strawberries for this pie. I also used a store bought pillsbury pie dough and did 15 minutes at 425 with crust covered in foil and 375 for 45 minutes. Then I let this cool cor 6-8 hours, It is soooo good and easy!

I don't have my own rhubarb plant so I get rhubarb either from friends or the market. There are some differences between the different kinds of rhubarb. Also, strawberries can make the difference depending on the type and how ripe they are. I usually add a little bit of tapioca (1 tsp.) to insure the filling won't be too runny. I also like to make this into a RHUBARB STRAWBERRY CRISP in a 9 X 9 square pan. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.  Yummy!

This pie, while it tasted pretty good, was the runniest pie I ever made.  Yeah, it's a fruit pie, and some spillage is expected when you cut it, but it shoudn't be watery like soup.  I used a crumb crust, which provided plenty of ventilation.  Plus, the rhubarb was still crunchy.  I finally put it back in the oven (covered in foil) for another half hour.  I don't think that  40 minutes is enough time to cook this.  You should not have to pre-cook the filling.  It needs a good hour for the flour to be able to get to temp. to thicken and for the rhubarb to cook.  If it gets brown before, cover it with foil.  I should have just stuck with Mom's recipe!

This was a great recipe that everyone in my family loved (including the fantastic baker grandma).  I was expecting a little more tartness from the rhubarb and want to try this again with fresh instead of frozen and maybe a little less sugar.  Mine was not runny or taste flour-y at all.  I made sure to let the mixture sit for the whole 30 min. before adding to the crust to bake and I made it the day before serving.  I didn't do a lattice top, but cut a whole in the middle and 4 one inch slits.  I will be making this again as soon as there is fresh rhubarb in the store!!!

Delicious! A bit runny if eating right after baking, but all wonderful, fruity pies are like this. Crust protectors are definitely key, although trying to make your own from foil can be frustrating. Stick to the ratio of sugar to flour--don't change a thing!

Wow! I haven't had such a tasty pie in a long time. The recipe is so simple all you can taste is the fruit. I took Alessandra's advice and I will be making this pie again if my rhubarb crop grows vigorously enough before strawberry season finishes.

This is a great recipe. I made it with garden rhubarb that I froze last spring. The taste was fine but I didn't let it defrost completely. The pie tasted really good but it was very soupy because there was still a lot of water in the rhubarb. I will definitely make this pie again.

I have made this recipe a few times over the past couple years and it has become our favorite.  It is easy to make, and the other reviewers' comments have been helpful.  I added a pinch of cinnamon and fresh nutmeg, because that's what my family likes.  I used fresh strawberries and rhubarb and let them sit in the flour for at least 30 minutes; I used a lattice top and let it cool slightly in the oven before removing it and it was not runny at all!  My father who grew up with a wonderful German mother who made everything from scratch said it was one of the best he has had!  I definitely can't compete with Grandma's cooking, but at least I know I can make a pie that would hold up to hers!  Thanks - this is a keeper!

I have never baked with rhubarb before, so I was a little worried how it would turn out. I followed the recipe exactly, and it was perfect. I did cut the rhubarb into pretty small pieces. I let the pie mixture sit for the 30 minutes before I baked, and my pie was not at all runny. I used a lattice top and baked it for 40 minutes, then shut the oven off and let the pie sit for 10 minutes in the oven before I took it out.

I used 3 cups of each, peeled the Rhubarb. Added some Pampered Chef Cinnamon Plus and baked for 50 mins. Best pie ever. If any one loves Baker's Square Pies like me this is soooo much better then theirs! Thanks :)

This turned out so great.  I let it sit for about 4 hours before cutting into it and it was not runny at all.  It was really good and I will for sure make it again.

Fantastic!  I made this pie yesterday for Father's Day and everyone raved about it.  Considering my family isn't big on rhubarb, that's saying something.  It was a truly wonderful pie.  I followed the recipe exactly except for substituting a lattice top crust.  I used in-season rhubarb and strawberries from my local farmer's market, which makes a difference.  It's a new favorite!

Delicious! I used a Pillsbury ready-crust from the dairy section to save time, covered it with egg yolk and sugar as the recipe said, it tasted just like homemade. After baking I let it sit for 12 hours before cutting into it, the pie was not runny at all, my fiance said it was perfect! This is a keeper recipe, I'm sure I'll be making it for years to come.

This pie has great flavor.  But as a professional baker I followed this recipe to the "T" and it came out with the a filling the consistency of Decoupage Paste.  I would highly recommend some revision be made to this pie.

I really benefited from other people's changes.  I used 3 cups of chopped rhubarb and 3 cups of strawberries and baked for 15 minutes at 425 then 45 minutes at 375 covering the edges with foil.  It turned out beautifully,not runny at all.  I cheated and used Betty Crocker's flaky crust mix which was very good.

I made this the other day and stuck to the original recipe and it came out great.  The rhubarb mixture sat for about 2-3 hours, though, instead of just the 30 minutes.  I did not cut it until it was almost totally cool.  Not runny at all!  Great recipe!

It was wonderful and not runny. Only why did my bottom crust come out undercooked? I baked it for 40 min. and let it cool in the oven with the door slightly open.

This was delicious! When I decided that I was going to attempt homemade pie filling for the first time to use up some rhubarb I had on hand I was pretty worried, but this was easier than I ever could have imagined! It was delicious, just like grandma used to make! And I was happy that it didn't get watery at all like most rhubarb desserts tend to! This is a definite keeper!

I had no issues with the pie being too runny. The rhubarb is tender and delicious. I have many compliments on this pie, especially since it is not too sweet and you can still taste the tartness of the rhubarb with the sweetness of the sugar and the strawberries. I love it and it is my "go-to" recipe when I need to make a Rhubarb Pie!

Ditto a previous review. I just made this pie and it was excellent. Didn't change a thing. If there is any secret to avoiding runny-pie syndrome I believe it's a combination of letting the filling stand AT LEAST 30 minutes before pouring into the shell (with occasional stirring), and making sure the pie is baked until the filling is actively boiling throughout.( In my lousy oven that requires rotating the pie about half way through.)

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. I think it's important to allow the strawberry/rhubarb/sugar/flour mixture to sit for at least thirty minutes before baking. And don't drain the liquid before you pour it into the crust because that is where the flour is which is the thickening agent. Really a great recipe. Thanks....I have made this pie several times now, and will tell you that 1) There is no need to cook the mixture first, but the rhubarb should be cut into very small pieces for it to bake properly. 2) It must cool before it will set; but it WILL set - if you follow the directions. If you are nervous about it setting, I used cornstarch once instead of flour and that too worked well. Hubby requests this a lot during the summer and even bought a few rhubarb plants this year to ensure it gets made!

One of the best desserts we have made yet!  We followed the suggestions of some other reviews and made the top like a lattice pie, only we used a cookie cutter on a regular pie crust and just had little circles on the top because it was easier.  That, combined with letting everything sit for the appropriate time and letting the pie sit overnight before cutting it made it so it was not runny at all, and the flavor was great.  We will definitely be making this again.

Husband said it could be better but it was my fault. I thought the recipe said 1 pint of strawberries. OOOPPPSSS! I'll make it again later with the correct amount of strawberries. I used a crust off another website and husband liked the crust alot.

I used frozen rhubarb and strawberries since it's all I had. I also used half flour and half cornstarch. The pie was certainly good, but nothing spectacular. It was also rather tart, I may add a bit more sugar next time.

There was a bit too much sugar for my taste, but when I made it, there were no complaints who ate it.  Mine was the only dessert that had an empty pan by the end of the night.  To make the top crust easier, I rolled out the dough and used a small cookie cutter to cut out small shapes from the dough.  I then put those all over the top of strawberry filling.  It looked gorgeous!!

This recipe worked perfectly. I left it in the over for 20 minutes with the door open as others suggested, then cooled on the counter for a few hours. It worked perfectly, not soupy and it stayed together. Great recipe.

This recipe was GREAT. The store didn't have any rhubarb, so I just used a can of peaches and sliced them up. I baked the pie for the minimum amount of time and then shut off the oven. After letting the pie sit in the oven for an hour or two, it was perfect! Not runny at all. Highly recommended.

I followed the recipe exactly and didn't cut into it until 24 hrs after baking and I still had a really runny pie.  Like some other reviewers, the sauce had a floury taste.  I don't know what I did wrong, but I guess the result may depend on how juicy your strawberries are??  If I were to make this pie again, I may follow others' suggestion of adding cornstarch to the fruit.  Uncut, it did make a lovely looking pie.

WOW! this recipe was great! I did change the flour to 5tbsp.  and added 4c each of strawberries and rhubarb. I also decreased the sugar to 3/4c.  I thought the crumb topping was going to be too much but was just right.  This is a great recipe for anyone to try.  A winner!

I was really disappointed . . . I followed the recipe exactly and I would up with strawberry rhubarb soup.  It sat for two days in the fridge and continued to be very soupy.  I'd like to try this again by adding some corn starch to the filling.  But as is, sure didn't work.

Followed original recipe exactly.  Unbelievably runny but taste was good.  *Edited to add (two years later): I am certain the runny consistency is due to the rhubarb in my garden.  Therefore I am changing my rating to five stars because the runniness is my rhubarb's fault.

Like other reviewers, I found that it came out very juicy. I even left it alone for twenty-four hours, but there was still a lot of liquid. It was also a little on the sweet side. Other than that, very tasty and very easy.

Excellent flavor, but very soupy a few hours after baking.  I had to the thin liquid out of the cut pie!  The flavor makes it worth making again, but I'll adjust the thickening agents next time.

Good, but a little too tart for my taste. I will try it again but add a little more sugar.

The perfect pie!  Everyone loved it!  I was a bit concerned because I didn't know if it would be sweet enough, and I didn't have vanilla ice cream on hand to serve with it, just in case.  I needn't have worried.  Delicious.

I made this as per directions, even adding a bit more flour and a heaping tablespoon of cornstarch. I found it WAY too runny. I think my Mom use to add an egg to her filling mixture, so maybe I will try that next time.

I made this pie at the request of my boyfriend.  He loves the filling in pies to be runny, and this one is now his favorite pie.
