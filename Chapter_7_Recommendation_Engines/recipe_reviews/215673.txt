I was really concerned when I poured the zucchini puree on top of the crust. It was almost as thin as water. I put it in the oven, carefully and it firmed up quite a bit.  A couple of changes I think I'd make to the recipe next time - a little more flour in the filling.  For me, the filling is still a bit too loose. I'd also reduce the sugar as it seems very sweet to me, The crust was delicious as it was,, Update - I stuck these back in the oven and baked them some more.. maybe another 30 minutes. The sugar turned more caramalized and the bars firmed up and browned.  I like them MUCH better this way! So if you make these and don't like them, bake them more and you might be surprised

YUM!!!!!!! So fluffy and creamy. Tastes very "refreshing" because of the zucchini. Definitely a keeper

This recipe was amazing. My daughter said no way she wouldn't eat it knowing there was zucchini in it. I gave her a taste and she loved it. I made it just as is, no changes.

Will make again. Was definitely sweet, I’ll cut back 1/2 cup at least next time. I added 1/4 cup lemon juice and skipped the cinnamon sugar on top, was good, but I couldn’t taste the lemon, i was thinking so they would be more like a lemon bar, next time I’ll add more juice and some zest and maybe a drop or two of lemon oil. It is way to thick, next time I’ll double the crust and put in a cookie sheet and make only one recipe of filling. It was like a pumpkin pie, same ingredients, squash, eggs, sugar, and canned milk, i was thinking more like a creamy pudding custard type thing but it’s just like a pie. I can’t wait to try it again with my modifications and also to make it a day ahead to set. Oh ya cook at least 20 more minuets linger,

The flavor isn't bad, but it's definitely different. I thought it was alright but no one wanted seconds.

Great recipe.  I also cooked this for about 20-30 mins more than the original recipe calls for, bars firmed up better.  I also didn't have 2 tsp of Vanilla Extract (oops) so I used just 1 tsp and it tastes great.  Great way to get rid of these zucchini!  :)

Meh. I wanted to make a Christmas treat to give to friends. This is more like sneaking a vegetable into a cookie for my kids. Not something I'd share for Christmas. But they are green!

I added lemon juice and lemon peel- made for a nice twist! I had to bake longer as well, however.
