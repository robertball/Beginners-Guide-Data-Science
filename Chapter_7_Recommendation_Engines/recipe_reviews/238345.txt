I have been looking for a Breakfast smoothie with Beets. I tried this one today, and I liked it very much. I substituted frozen strawberries for the raspberries. I added 1/2 cup of spinach, and I used plain yogurt  not Greek. I truly enjoyed it so much better than trying to juice it. I will drink this every day , that's how much I liked it :) Thank you for sharing.

I used frozen strawberries . Substituted parsley for spinach. Canned beets in place of fresh beets. Coconut water to cover blades of vitamix.  A little honey for sweetness. Will make again.

It was ok, although I had to end up adding a little agave to it to add some sweetness.

It was good, but a bit of a strong beet taste.
