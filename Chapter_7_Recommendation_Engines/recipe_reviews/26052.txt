First made the cake per recipe.  It was delicious, but a little heavy.  Second time, used cake flour, increased vanilla extract to 1 tablespoon, and added 2 tablespoons white vinegar.  Wow!  No one can tell this is an eggless cake!  My grandson is allergic to eggs, but can have his cake and eat it too!

My daughter has an egg allergy and I've tried several recipes including box mixes with egg substitutes.  Every eggless cake I make is crumbly and doesn't hold together well.  

I was amazed how moist and solid this cake was after making it for the first time today.  It was extremely easy to prepare.  I baked it about 5 minutes too long because the outside of the cake developed a "crust" with a chewey texture.  The crust is shiny.  Other than that, the cake was very good.  It rose very well and did not sink.  I would probably add a little sugar when I make it again because I felt it needs to be a touch more sweeter.  It has a hint of orange flavor and scent from the juice.

I didn't use a mixer, just stired it until everything was thoroughly mixed.  If you over mix an eggless batter, it will deflate.

I would say this is the best eggless cake I've made to date and I will definitely make it again.

I am a preschool teacher & have a child w/an egg allergy in my class. We recently decided to make cupcakes for my co-teacher's birthday, so I was in search of a simple, easy (after all, this was cooking with 3 year olds), and most importantly delicious recipe. I was a little bit worried as some reviewers claimed it was obvious that it was egg-free to regular egg eaters. But, as an egg eater & dessert lover, I can honestly say this cake was better than the boxed stuff and just as simple to make! (Changes I made were 1 tbsp. vanilla & 2 tbsp. sugar to make it a touch sweeter. Cooked in cupcake pan for around 25-30 minutes.) So yummy, esp. w/vanilla frosting! Will definitely be making again for my class & for myself!

I really liked this recipe.  I did not use orange juice, but used 1 cup of water + 1 T white vinegar.  I decreased the butter to 3/4 cup, and I increased the vanilla to 1 T.  It made 20 cupcakes, and my 8 yr old daughter and her friends loved them!

I bake for a living and last year a mom requested a eggless cake for her little girls birthday party. She wanted one small eggless cake and another regular cake to serve her guests. Well this year she is ordering only a large eggless cake!! She said the cake was wonderful and everyone who tried it enjoyed it so no need to make a regular cake! I think it is wonderful that a little girl can have her beautiful birthday cake and eat it too!

My sister swears I added eggs. The cake is surprisingly moist. I added 2 tablespoons of superfine sugar and a tablespoon of Amaretto. I also reduced the butter by half, not because I wanted a healthy recipe but because the cake was greasy to touch. Even with less butter, this cake was still super moist and spongy. My family ate it quickly so I will offer it to my customers as an option.

This is a fabulous cake.  My little guy is allergic to eggs, and it has been difficult to find a "birthday worthy" cake.  A great use of condensed milk, too--so easy, tasted great, not too sweet.  Thank you!

Please note, for those of you out there who CAN eat eggs---pick another recipe.  This cake is definitely plain (with a capital P!) but for those who cannot eat eggs I'm sure it is the best alternative.  It definitely has a cake like texture and look but it tastes like cornbread to me.  You cannot taste the orange juice at all and actually the cake is not very sweet which is probably where a glaze or frosting would help.  After some additional thought Cream Cheese frosting might do wonders for this cake.  Regardless, if you are going to make this be prepared to be VERY creative and dress it up somehow.

I am a baker,  and did this cake for a mom looking for an eggless cake, I must admit this cake was pretty darn good!  
I did supplement the Condensed milk for regular 2%milk, and I added 1/2c of sugar, omitted the OJ  and added 2 tsp of vanilla & 4 tsp of vinegar...
I will definitely be making this baby again!

I ended up using water instead of orange juice since I didn't have any, and increased the vanilla extract to 1 tablespoon.  I baked mini cupcakes for 11 minutes and regular cupcakes for 17 minutes and they came out terrific!  I frosted them with cream cheese frosting to make the cupcakes a little healthier. UPDATE FEB 8 2009 - I now use this for my daughter's birthday cake every year.  Use cake flour and you will get a much finer texture.  Also, I now replace 1/2 cup of the butter with 1/2 cup of sour cream or plain Greek yogurt.  It won't be greasy this way.

My son has an egg allergy so finding good baking recipes is always a challenge.  This cake was FANTASTIC.  Very moist and tender, not heavy like others I have tried.  I did take the advice of another reviewer and used cake flour instead of AP and added a tsp. of white vinegar to the batter (I do this as well with my chocolate eggless cake).  I made this as cupcakes and they were wonderful...very light and fluffy.  A must try for someone with an egg allergy.

I bake cakes professionally and had a request for an eggless cake. After trying the cake mix +soda option I came across this recipe. EXCELLENT !! I followed a reviewer's recommendation and used cake flour + vinegar. I also added some coconut extract to mask the baking soda / powder taste. I really like the texture and will definitely use it for my 3 tiered anniversary cake this weekend ! Thank you..

Very easy.I thought the taste and texture were fine for not having eggs.My grandson is allergic to eggs so this was great.  I made cupcakes baking them 20-22 minutes, and used regular canned icing and sprinkles. Now he has cupcakes just like the other kids!

This was a very good eggless recipes, but, better with a few changes.  This is the only eggless recipe I have found where the cake still sticks together, and doesn't crumble anywhere, or, where it is a sticky-dense like texture.  

As suggested by others, I used cake flour, rather than regular flour.  I used 1 Tablespoon of vanilla (rather than 2 teaspoons).  I also added 2 Tablespoons of sugar and 2 Tablespoons of vinegar.  These changes give better flavor and texture.  
Also, because I was making this for a childrens birthday party (and one child was allergic to eggs), I made cupcakes, so, I added in one small bottle of the Betty Crocker "Stars" decorating decors (they are like the sprinkles you put on top of frosting).  This gave the cupcakes a "funfetti" cakemix-like fun look.  Also, because I made these as cupcakes, I cut the baking time down to 18 minutes.

I'm actually thinking of trying this next time with pinneaple juice, rather than orange juice.

Thanks Margaret for this lovely recipe! I just made a few changes to this and got a wonderful cake in 15min for preparing and 40 min baking.  2C of Flour , 1.5tsp BP, 1/2 tsp BS, 3/4 can of condensed milk, 1/2 C water, 1tbsp Vanilla, 1/4 C of melted butter,  1 whole ripe banana mashed. The cake came out so well and was a big HIT!  Lined my baking tray with cinnamon sugar and was simply delicious.  I'm so glad that my grand parents enjoyed this as they don't take eggs!!!

This is the greatest eggless cake ever.  I've made it six times now, other than using whatever juice I have on hand, I've followed the recipe.  It is a firmer cake that can be used to make shapes for creative BDay cakes.  Cupcakes are great too!

This is the best eggless cake I have found to date.  It was VERY moist and it tasted like a real box-cake.  MY daughter has a severe egg allergy and finding a cake recipe that she can eat has been a challenge.  Not only has she enjoyed this cake, but she likes it without frosting! YIPEE!!!  I did modify the vanilla by adding 1 tablespoon instead of 2 teaspoons, but that was the only ingredient I changed.  THANKS MARGARET!

This cake was OK but came out tasting more like a greasy pancake.  Definitely didn't have much flavor and I even increased the vanilla in it to 2 tblsp.  My 7 year old liked it but it's not a cake I'd put my name or stamp on.  I won't be making this one again.  I'll keep looking!

I used oil instead of melted butter, baked it in a bundt pan for 33 minutes and it tasted great even without any glaze! I'm definitely using this recipe for a caterpillar cake that I'll be making next week for a kid with egg allergies! Thanks for the recipe!

This cake was not good at all.  It is way too sweet and tastes like canned milk, yuck!  I gave it 2 stars instead of one because it did rise, though it was still thick and doughy on the inside.  Definitely not worth trying again.

Best eggless cake I have had so far.  Instead of vanilla extract, I used almond extract and put slivers of almonds in the icing.  I also took the advice to use vinegar, a little more sugar and more flavoring.  I think the texture turned out wonderful.

I made this for my 6 year old son's birthday party today and covered it with a simple butter frosting. I added a little more vanilla extract and a tablesoon of vinegar as some other users suggested. It was a hit! This was the first at a kids' party that they actually asked for seconds! Thank you - this is definitely a keeper!

This cake is wonderul! This recipe fills a 10" pan very well.  Would need to double the recipe to make a 2 layer 10" cake.  The taste is great.  I took the advice of a couple of reviewers.  I used cake flour, added 1 T of vinegar and upped the vanilla to 1T.  Right out of the oven it may taste a bit too buttery, but it's perfect when it cools.  Thanks SO much for this recipe.  I am using it to fill a  bakery order for an egg allergic kid.

Made this for a little girl at church as shes allergic to eggs. This rose perfectly, smells and tastes wonderful. Even my kids were wanting one. Made 20 cupcakes that are beautiful and very tasty. Not overly sweet, just perfect. I will definatly make this again and again. Only change I made was I used Smart Beat Margarine and it was still perfect.

Most of the eggless cake recipes I have found are chocolate, so it was great to find one that "vanilla"-ish. I made it for a friend's son who is allergic to nuts and eggs. I tweaked it a little bit - added about 3/4 C granulated sugar and an extra tsp of vanilla - turned out great! Tastes wonderful with fresh fruit filling and buttercream icing :).

I tweaked this a little, based on previous rating info.  I did 1/2C butter and 1/2C applesauce.  I added about 1/4C sugar, used cake flour (and increased by 5 tblsp's)- added a generous pinch extra of both the soda and powder....and made cupcakes- yummy, light and fluffy.

This cakes was such a hit! It was gone less than 3 hours after it came out of the oven! My family does not eat eggs, and we've always been looking for the perfect eggless cake recipe, found it here! I added 1 tbsp of white sugar to the batter, it came out perfect, great texture, great taste. People were convinced that I secretly added an egg!

Good eggless cake without chocolate.  I suggest using a whole tablespoon of real vanilla extract and adding some orange zest.  I used two round pans and split the layers with dental floss to make them thinner.  This allowed the layers to absorb a little more raspberry jam and buttercream icing.  Mmmm.

Great base for an eggless cake. 
I modified it quite a bit based on the ingredients I had at home though, so here is the full modified recipe:
2 1/2 cups flour 
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup 2% milk
1/2 cup brown sugar
orange zest (from 1 medium orange)
1 cup water
2 tsp vinegar
1tbsp dark rum
1tbsp vanilla extract
1/2 cup melted butter
1/2 cup sour cream

Sour cream decreased the grease feeling from the butter, but still kept the moisture. We don't have condensed milk readily available in my area in Europe, so I just used regular milk+sugar... I could have condensed it myself but was short on time. Orange zest and rum are very common ingredients here in Europe as well, I use both frequently and couldn't imagine this cake without them.

Baked at 170 degrees celsius for 40 minutes and the cake rose quite a bit, and was tasty!

I just tried this recipe over the weekend. It came out rather nicely. My kids and I enjoyed it very much and even shared with Hindu friends who are fasting and can't eat eggs during the fast. I made a few changes as suggested by others. I didn't use orange juice. I used water instead and I added 1 Tbsp. white vinegar. I increased the vanilla extract to 1 Tbsp. and used 3/4 cup melted butter. I felt that it was a tad dry so next time I will use the full 1 cup butter. Other than that, the taste was good. I do recommend!

I learned that if you are baking this cake as a large cake it needs to be cooked in thin (1 inch) layers. You cannot just dump it into a 6x3 inch deep pan and expect the middle to cook. Works great in a bundt pan. Excellent flavor. Tastes great alone or with icing. Love it.

One change I did make was use pineapple juice instead of orange juice.

My Indian friends find this cake delicious too.

I found out my daughter is allergic to eggs and chocolate just before her 2nd birthday, so I was stumped on what to do for her birthday cake! I found this recipe and was so excited to try it! I used a can of fat-free condensed milk because it was all I had on hand. I also ran out of orange juice so I substituted with 1 cup water and 2 tbsp orange extract. It was wonderful! Everyone at the party was raving and really like the "pound-cake" texture. I topped it with homemade whipped cream frosting and strawberries. My dad requested that I absolutely must make it for our next family gathering!

My son is allergic to eggs so I thought I found the perfect recipe...not really unfortunately!  I made mini cupcakes and baked them for 11 min as suggested by another review, they were ok but nothing great!! My kids mostly licked the icing off the cupcakes!! I'll keep looking for the perfect recipe.

This recipe is FABULOUS!  My son is allergic to eggs, so this worked out for a wonderful cupcake recipe.  I added 1 tbsp of white vinegar and 1 tbsp of vanilla.  I used mini-muffin pans and baked in the oven for 11 minutes.  Makes about 4 1/2 dozen mini-cupcakes.

Incredible egless cake!  I made this for my niece's birthday.  This is one of the two best recipes I've found so far (and I've tried many, being an avid baker coming from an family of mostly non-egg-eating people).  I put fresh strawberries thickened with oetker's clear glaze between two 8" layers, frosted them, and put more berries on top.  Bake 8" layers for 35-40 minutes.  Fabulous.  Will make many more times!

This is an excellent recipe. By far the best texture for an eggless cake - and comes out perfect everytime. It is only mildly sweet, so frosting works well. Another addition that I do is to add chocolate chips, and other types of sweet chips into the mixture at the end - that adds to the sweetness and flavor.

I made this for a guest(as the little girl is severly allergic to eggs) at my daughter's 3rd birthday party.  The little girl was delighted to be eating birthday cake just like all the other children and her Mom just kept raving about how great the cake tasted.  I personally tried the cake and did not really care for the grainy texture but I am not a connoseur of eggless cakes.

Great tasting cake, good for those with egg allergies.  I made a glaze with some orange juice, triple sec, butter, and sugar and put that on it to emphasize the orange flavor, and it was really good that way!

Awesome! I added 1/4 c. sugar + 1/2 tsp. salt to the dry ingredients. Also, used salted butter. Just fabulous! Never thought an egg-free cake could be so good!

This is a perfect eggless cake - moist and just sweet enough (I increased the vanilla extract to 1 tbsp), not crumbly at all. The color is nice and golden, not pale as a couple of the pictures showed, so I posted mine as well. I was looking for an eggless cake to make for a birthday cake and this is it. Thank you!

Amazing. Added the vinegar as suggested by other reviewers. No condensed milk in the house, so I used plain milk instead. Added chocolate chips. Terrific cake.

This cake was so easy to make!  You only use one bowl, so it makes for easy clean up too.  My daughter has an egg allergy and I had been looking for a good egg-less cake recipe and this is it!  Moist and tasty!

I have tried many eggless cake recipes and this one by far is the best.  The taste and texture of the cake is wonderful. Cakes for most eggless recipes fall apart. I used an "Elmo" mold for this recipe to make a birthday cake for my son's 2nd birthday.  It came out of the mold perfectly and was easy to decorate.  Now, its my gold standard recipe for eggless cake.

OMG!!!!! THIS IS THE BEST SCRATCH CAKE I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!!  I was skeptical about this recipe at first because the ingredients sound kinda off but it is awesome....so light and fluffy and moist.  I just took it out of the oven and half the cake is gone because I ate it!   lol  I used mangoe juice instead of orange cuz that's what I had, but as long as you have an acidic juice the cake with turn out fine!

I made this cake for my mother in law's birthday. She is vegetarian and does not eat egg. I was quite happy with the recipe.  The cake rose about an inch or more out of the baking pan.  This was great because i was worried it wouldn't rise and be too dense.  It had a good taste to it and my husband's mother loved it! Which made me very happy too!

For an eggless cake, this was great. My friend is allergic to eggs and I wanted to bake a cake and found this recipe. We ate it all. It is a little heavier in texture than a traditional cake and it seemed to have more air bubble holes than a regular cake but the flavor was very good. If you need an eggless cake recipe, this is it.

Such a wonderful, moist cake.  I made this for my son's birthday (he has food allergies) with just a glaze icing and even my older boy who only eats the icing on cakes loved this.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Just made these as cupcakes.  Mixed well, most ingredients on hand.  Not very sweet and both son and I noticed they tasted like a light cakey cornbread.  Did not use oj (water instead) and put a t of white vinegar, like someone suggested. I put an extra 1/2 cup water because mix seemed thick.  Made 24 cupcakes.

It was heavy and much different from a normal plain cake in texture..in my country we have something call ToToe and this plain eggless cake is more like that, than a cake. When it cooled it was hard, the next day. It needs some modification to be perfect. But it is a good start,the taste was great, except I might use a little less baking soda next time

The best eggless cake ever. I don't know much about baking but I gave it a try because we are vegetarians.  I can't beleive how good it turned out in my first try.  I will be making this cake very often.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I have never reviewed a product in my life, but this cake made me sit right down and write one!  I've made a few cakes for my egg-allergic son and they have all been ridiculously heavy and virtually inedible.  This cake is fantastic -- and so easy!  I did take a pp's advice and changed the vanilla to 1 T. and added 2 T. of sugar.  Delicious.  And I don't have any icing on it yet!  Thank you!  Finally, a birthday cake I don't have to feel bad about serving to everyone!

this cake was wonderful, Ihad no orange juice, but I new I had to have something acidic to help the rise and stimulate the baking soda/&pwdr.  I used orange punch (2tbsp frozen concentrate+water to 1C) and added 2 tbsp lemon juice.  I also added 1tsp salt, doubled the vanilla, and I used shortening, not butter! It came out perfect, exactly same rise as my regular cakes, now my customers can enjoy this eggless version of my creations!

I made this cake for my co-worker's birthday. She is, of course, allergic to eggs (and chocolate). This was my first attempt at an eggless cake. To feed the group we had, I actually doubled the recipe and added some orange zest to the batter. With the doubled recipe, I made two 9-inch cakes and a small bundt cake. I cooked the cakes at 350 for about 30 minutes. For the frosting, I used the Cream Cheese II recipe from this site and added some orange zest to it as well. Everyone raved about how wonderful the cake tasted - I've already passed the recipe on to several co-workers! We kept the bundt cake at home and our 3 kids loved it too! Thanks for the GREAT recipe!!

I made this cake for someone whose child was allergic to eggs, they loved it, and I've been making it since, its been a big hit!!! Another way to use the leftover cake, if there is no icing on it, is to slice it thin, and then put it in the oven, and bake it at around 250, it will dry out like biscotti, and excellent for snacking.

Orange juice helps keep this cake from tasting too much like sweetened condensed milk.  It is mildly sweet and has a tender crumb. I used two 8 inch round pans and it was done in about 25 minutes on convection baking at 350°F.  I plan to serve with fruit and whipped cream so I didn't want a too sweet cake, anyway.  Now that I have an egg allergy, I need new recipes such as this one.

This is the third time for us with this recipe.  I have children with egg allergies, and I was looking for another cake besides chocolate.   This cake works great and is so versatile.  Tonight I'm combining this recipe with my chocolate cake recipe and the results are GREAT.  Very easy and fun.

This recipe is excellent. Tried it once and added 2 tablespoon white vinegar. Be careful of flour lumps while adding the condensed milk n orange juice to the flour mix.

It had good texture for an eggless cake but lacked the orangey flavor. If I make it again I will grate orange rind into the batter.

this is such a simple and ohh! so delicious cake. I was actually looking for an eggless coffee cake recipe simply because I ran out of eggs but wanted to have a cake like right now! So I took this recipe, added some cinnamon in the batter and also made a topping of chopped apples, walnuts, little brown sugar and cinnamon mixed with the little butter that I reserved from the 1 cup that was actually called for.it came out so well.Guess melting the butter was the trick here, the cake was so moist and fluffy.makes me feel like I'm becoming a good baker. Thank you Margaret!

Delicious eggless cake!  Great if you want to make an authentic, stays bound cake for allergy sufferers.  Moist too, but doesn't keep well for longer than a day.

This was my first eggless cake, baked for my son's birthday. I was very glad that someone had said that eggless cakes are not to be over mixed. I stirred the batter with a spoon- it looked a little like oatmeal when I poured it in the pans. I also followed other suggestions: increased the vanilla to a TBS, added 2 TBS white vinegar, added a little less than 1/4 cup of sugar and decreased the butter by 1/4. It was a beautiful cake. I put it in 2 9" round pans and checked them in 25 mins and they were done. I think I could've taken them out a little sooner than that. The cake had a good taste but was a little dry. I frosted with cream cheese icing. I would use the full amount of butter and add a little more sugar and maybe a little almond extract next time. Maybe I had unrealistic expectations because of the great reviews, plus I don't bake a lot but this cake was not as good as the 'regular' cakes I've made, even cake mix cakes.

I gave this four stars because this cakes needs a bit more flavor. The texture was awesome, I added 3/4 cup more orange juice to the cake batter, this made it very moist, it was soft and did not crumble easily when I cut it. I also added 2 tablespoons sugar and increased the vanilla to 1 tablespoon. I also added a bit of yellow food color to give it that nice golden color. Next time I will add some orange extract or orange zest to flavor this cake more, I will definitely make this cake again, I still can't get over the fact it's eggless and rose so nicely...WOW!!

I had a customer recently with cake allergies and this recipe was great! I modified it a tiny bit by adding 2 tbsp. of sugar and a tablespoon of vanilla (as suggested by other reviews). One review said to use cake flour but I noticed that softa silk cake flour may contain eggs and I thought this was worthy of mention. This cake was thick a little dry but had a great flavor overall and goes great with pineapple cream cheese frosting found on allrecipes as well!

having a child in the house with an egg allergy, its hard to find things that he can bake with me, but also get to eat in the end. I added a 1/2 cup of surgar and used butter flavored crisco on the pan. added a lot more flavor and made it a bit sweeter. i do suggest that you flip the cake upsidedown to decorate once cooled due to the top sinking slightly after removing from heat. but other than that this cake totally surpirsed me and was very tasty thankx to the orange juice. and on top of that he ate it up!!

This recipe was GREAT.  I made it for a friend who's son is allergic to eggs.  I listened to some of the suggestions and put in 1 TBS Vanilla, 2 TBS Sugar and cut the butter back to 3/4 cup.  I mixed together with a spoon and baked it for 35 mins.  It was sooooo delicious, it tasted better than a boxed cake.  I am definitely hanging on to this recipe, Thanks!

Used recipe and tweaked it a little, reduced the butter by 1/4 and replaced with yogurt, added 1 tsp of vanilla and used cake flour.  Really Good! enough for two 9 inch pans.

we are allergic to eggs. So I made it for Valentines day! My husband loved it and when he came to know its eggless, he couldn't believe it. The cake not only had a nice texture but a good glaze on top too. Also, it was light and moist.  Next time I ll reduce the quantity of butter. Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe. thanks for making our day spl!

We used this as a first birthday cake.  We had leftover batter, so I made some cupcakes.  Turns out, everyone wanted to know where I got the wonderful "muffins" lol.  (I had left them unfrosted so that baby could eat more later).  My ds LOVES them.  What a wonderful consistency.  I added a bit more nutmeg and cinnamon for the next batch.  It was yummy, too, but so was the orig. recipe.

Thanks for sharing the recipe. It is a great recipe. I did not have any orange juice at home, added the pineapple juice instead and also added some cinnamon with dry cranberries to enhance the flavor.

Very good cake.  This tastes more like a pound cake, which I really enjoyed.  I kept 1/2 cup of batter out, added 1 T. cocoa, and mixed it together.  I put 1/2 of the batter in the bundt pan, put the chocolate around in the batter, and then added the rest of batter to the top.  Gave it that extra little sweetness.  Great recipe for us vegetarians!

This was my first attempt at an eggless cake.  I used cake flour insteaad of all-purpose, only used 1/2 cup of melted butter, and added 2 T of vinegar and 2 T of sugar, though I'm not sure the vinegar was necessary.  The cake came out greasy and a little rubbery.  The texture was like cornbread, minus the grittiness.  The taste is fine, though plain like the name suggests.  Since my son is egg allergic, this is our new standard.  I will make again, but continue to tweak the recipe until it suits us.  Still, it's a very good place to start.

I needed a non-chocolate eggless cake recipe for my son's best friends who are vegetarian. 
This recipe is terrific. People can't believe that eggless can taste so good. I've used this recipe for a layer cake and cupcakes. It is moist, light and sweet enough where you can add frosting and it is just right.
In fact, this recipe is so easy that it is my standard cake recipe.
Thanks so much for sharing.

I tried this recipe because my three year old son is allergic to egg.  I was rather disappointed.  I tried the recipe twice: first as cupcakes than as a cake with the same result.  It turned out dense, more similar to muffins than cake. It was not aweful, but just okay.  I followed the advice of some of the reviews - I used cake flour and added two teaspoons of sugar, but it didn't make a differece in the texture.  If your considering this recipe and you have a small child who knows no better, try it.  I would definitely advise that you try them as cupcakes first.

the cake turned out perfect. i used bundt pan and cooked on the gas flame. so i had no control over the temperature, still the cake turned out perfect. it took 25 minutes on a less than medium flame. i doubled the vanilla essence and used water instead of orange juice. thanks for such a perfect recipe.

This is one of the best cakes I have eaten eggless or otherwise. Very soft and wonderful texture and my husband was very happy that there is no "egg-smell" that he dislikes.

The centre of cake sank whenmy cousintried replacing with pineappple juice and the same happened with me. It couldbe because of overbeating also.When i triedwith tropicanaorange juice i mexed using a whisk- The results were good.I also tried replacing Orange juice with 1/2 tsp coffee in 1 cup hot water& 3Tsp   coco pd & 1Tsp sugar sifted with flour and came up with a good chocolate cake  .
used Betty croger choclate frosting.Some may find it less sweet but most found it good.It sure goes in my recipe book.I will need to experiment more with this recipe to figure out why it sank 2 times ..was it fresh pineapple juice or over beating in a professional cake mixer.

My daughter is allergic to eggs and has never been able to eat baked goods easily so this is a great option.  This cake has a heavyness that you don't find in a regular cake, but it was not off putting to my family.  In fact my son eats it better than regular cake. Needs frosting though to sweeten it up.  I also beat it with my electric mixer for about double the time that I do a regular cake the 2nd time I made it and it was a better texture.

Made this for my sister's birthday, came out great! The only thing I did differently was use olive oil instead of melted butter (less saturated fat). Relatives loved the smell and taste.

I love this!  What a treat!  I only used 1/2 cup (1 stick) of melted butter bc I thought 1 cup was crazy.  But it tasted amazing.  Made in cupcake pan and I over filled the first batch but they still only took 20 mins and were perfect!  Also I used self rising flour so I wouldn't be surprised if that's why they rose so much.  :). Will make over and over again for sure!

This turned out wonderfully spongey, however I made a few changes after reading the comments. I put 10 oz of condensed milk, put in extra vanilla extract, 2 tbsp of white vinegar, I cup of sour cream mixed in equal proportion with yogurt (mixed with about 1/4th cup of powdered sugar). I topped it off with a  low fat Greek yoghurt-cream cheese icing and toasted walnuts. Everyone at home loved it.

I made this cake for a school party because I have a student who is allergic to eggs. It was delicious! I did; however, tweak the recipe. I zested an orange, added the zest,  and used1 cup  fresh squeezed orange juice. The cake had a nice orange flavor. I also added 1/4 tsp Kosher salt. It was wonderful!

When I made this it failed, miserably. The cake collapesd on itself and one fell completely apart. On the bright side the cake itself is tasty and would be a good cake if I could make it work and not collaspe, friends and family perfered the one we made with eggs though. I made th cake for my birthday party and my friend cannot have eggs, we did not alter the recipe whatsoever, but from the other reviews with the alterations I see that I probably should have. I admit that adding orange jucie instead of eggs is very interesting but the cakes with eggs work better. I will try and make a cake that doesn't use eggs for others to use, keep in mind that there are not a lot of ways to do this so there may be some similarities but I shall try my best. ??

One of the best eggless cakes I've tried. Surprisingly light and moist for an eggless cake. Took some suggestions from other reviewers and made some changes. Used cake flour, added 2 tbsp white vinegar, added 1 more tbsp vanilla. Once I substituted milk for the orange juice and once made it with orange juice. I think it turned out better with the orange juice, but it does have a hint of the orange taste. Also, just hand mix it like suggested in the recipe. I think that makes it lighter. Baked it in 2, 9'' round pans for 30 mins.

If you are looking for a cake without eggs, it's good, but compared to a traditional cake it was PLAIN! I used cake and pastry flour and added 4 tablespoons of white sugar and used a basic buttercream frosting. The texture and sweetness were good but I was disappointed with the flavour. I was hoping for a bit more of the orange flavour. Next time I will add orange or lemon extract and choose a frosting with a little more pizzazz.

I used blood orange juice and 1 TB of vanilla , then substituted 1cup coconut yogurt, 3/4 cup milk for the sweetened, condensed milk.  Turned out very moist and didn't deflate.  Could definitely use a little sugar, but otherwise very good.

We loved this!  I used two 8 or 9 inch rounds instead and baked about 25 minutes.  I used a little honey in place of some of the orange juice.  Came out of the pans perfectly, fluffy and great!

I wanted to make an apple cake for my daughter that has an egg allergy. The recipe called to use a "Yellow cake Mix" so instead I used this recipe. Per the suggestion of some reviewers, I increased the baking powder to 2 "rounded" tsp. I added 2 Tbsp of Vinegar, I increased the Vanilla to 1 Tbsp and added 1 quater a cup of brown sugar, then I added 1 Tbsp of ground Cinnamon and as a last step I folded in Granny Smith apple peeled, cored and finely diced. The cake was really delicious, moist and fluff, you really couldn't tell that it was an eggless cake.

I was disappointed. It tastes kind of like cornbread. I did use whole wheat pastry flour, and surprisingly it took only 15 minutes to cook and it cooked BEAUTIFULLY, and the texture was amazing but it looked and tasted like cornbread.
I am hesitant to believe it was the whole wheat pastry flour, or maybe whether it's the brand of orange juice used, but I am not sure.

I am so in love with this recipe! I had nearly given up on the idea that my five-year old son, who's allergic to eggs, would be able to enjoy cake. I have tried numerous egg substitutes in cake recipes without success. This cake was DELICIOUS! He loves it too. A total success!

Easy, fast, moist and delicious. Since this was my second time baking the cake, the only changes i made was adding 1/2 cup brown sugar to the flour. I would think a good topping would complement this cake though. Thank You!

This is one of the best cakes i've ever made. this was the first time i made a cake without egg and was a bit hesitant but they(cupcakes) came out beautifully. since i made them a few days before the party i froze them right after i cooled them down. after defrosting at room temp they were still great. i was also a bit afraid that the OJ would give them too much of a distinct flavor but it gave them the right flavor. as one of the previous reviewer MGY i also added vinegar and increased the vanilla to a TBSP.

This was an awesome recipe. I didn't have any eggs and I wanted to bake a cake. And it worked out well. I did make a few modifications; I didn't have any condensed milk, so i used 2 cups of regular milk and 2 cups of sugar, also instead of orange juice i used organe/mango juice, added some chocolate chips and chopped pecans and YUM!. Soft, fluffy and delicious.

My husband said" This cake is amazing! And you made it from scratch!" This turned out to be the best cake I've ever made. It was light, fluffy, and moist. I used the batter to made an 8x8 in double layer cake. To compliment the orange juice in the batter I put a layer of thinly sliced orange, well drained pineapple chunks, and lemon zest in between the cake layers.  I used evaporated milk instead of condensed milk and added 4 tablespoons of sugar for sweetness (this may not have been necessary). I also increased vanilla extract to 1 tablespoon, and added 2 tablespoons white vinegar as recommended by a fellow user.  I highly recommend this recipe!

Made this with some of the suggestion others posted: reduced the butter by 1/3, added 2 T sugar and increased the vanilla to 1 T. The texture was firmer and denser than a regular cake, but had a good flavor.  I made a layer cake and used strawberry filling to give it some extra flavor and moistness.  I got lots of positive feedback from guests and would recommend this recipe if you cannot have eggs, but would go with something with eggs if you have the option!

My daughter loves cake, but is allergic to eggs. We tried several recipes, but this one is by far the best. You can serve this to anyone and they cannot tell there are no eggs. I have also used this to make cupcakes (we send half to the school cafeteria to keep in their freezer and the other half we keep for her to bring to birthday parties).  The cupcakes burn on the bottom when I use butter and they are little greasy, so I substitute oil for the butter and cut the amount in half. My daughter can how have her cake and eat it too.

I'm amazed at how delicious this cake turned out. I was in the mood for cake, but had no eggs in the house. I tried this recipe and I couldn't be more pleased. It's a delicious cake that isn't too sweet. It's moist and holds up to home make butter cream frosting just fine. I'm going to make this cake again right now, adding blueberries to see how it turns out. I have a feeling this recipe would make fabulous muffins, too!

so far the lightest and tastest mix. I made cupcakes instead of the cake for my sons birthday and I had to make more for people to take home. Ha forget the party bags.  I did add a 2 Tbsps more juice.

One of my daughters has an egg allergy so we tried this recipe. No one could tell it didn't have eggs. The texture was much like a regular cake (with eggs)- it wasn't crumbly. The batter was thick- but I had only used 1/2 c. butter (that's all I had). I baked it for 30 minutes but it was too much for my oven--I think mine must run hot. I made a citrus glaze for those in the family that wanted it a little sweeter.

I was looking for an eggless recipe to make for my daughter for her birthday as she has an allergy to eggs.  We had a cupcake party for her.. so instead of making a cake, I made cupcakes.  This was a mistake.. I trusted the reviews for this recipe and followed it to a "T" but the cupcakes came out dry - very dry.  So if you make this recipe.. do not make cupcakes.. stick to the regular cake.. I did think that next time I would try adding Jello Vanilla Instant Pudding Mix to make it more moist - so hopefully that'll do the trick.

Awesome cake!!  Was a huge hit at our daughter's 1st birthday party.  Solid (yet fluffy on inside) cake, easy to icing.

Thanks a lot for this recipe of eggless cake. I am vegetarian & do not eat egg at all. I was looking for such recipe & when I made a vanilla almond cake as per this recipe it turned out very good. This was my first time ever in baking a cake at home. You must be a very good cook. This a God's gift & its so nice of u to share this talent with others. 
Good Luck for everything in ur life.
Thanks Again.

My husband teases my baking abilities so  at on point of time i stopped baking cake at home . To be honest at first I was skeptical about the recipe it seemed to simple . But then  it had no bad reviews at all , so I thought I would give it a try . Yes  indeed its the most easiest cake and came out perfect , moist and ofcourse no eggs in it. Next time I'll try to reduce the flour quantity as its bit on higher side at least for us .

My family doesn't eat eggs so I made it for my brother's birthday party.  With and without frosting, they're delicious!

I was really skeptical about how this cake would taste, but was very surprised.  It's very moist and the orange juice gave it a nice flavor.  I used buttercream icing and strawberry in the middle (I used two 8 in. round pans) and used almond extract instead of vanilla.  I'd receommend that change.  It got great reviews as well!

This is a great cake, eggless or not.  The orange juice adds great flavor, and the texture is the same as cake made with eggs.  I passed the recipe on to a vegetarian friend of mine and she loves it, even for breakfast!

It's a good cake - I have served it to people who won't eat eggs for one reason or another and they like it.
