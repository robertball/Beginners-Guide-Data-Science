Awesome! Just made a couple of tweets for my own taste and dietary needs. Replaced 1/2 cup of the water with milk, 1 egg, couple of Tbls ground flax seed and a tiny spot of ground ginger.

I had to sub a half cup almond flour since I only had 3.5 cups cornmeal-I just used straight cornmeal and even that way with the almond flour is still good! Great with maple syrup! I bet it would taste even better if I had a cornbread mix instead of just corn meal
