This is an excellent cake - a few tips, though.  For true mint lovers, the mint between the layers just isn't enough; for that extra oomph get crumbled Andes mints in your baking section of the grocery store and add approx 1/4 c right into the cake batter while mixing.  They melt into the cake when baking and come out great!  I also sprinkled some on top of cake after icing.  Use a different, thicker fudge frosting - this one is too thin.  Also, don't cook for the full time listed - I cooked for about 20 mins and stick with the old toothpick test and you'll be ok. Also found I needed to make two batches for the cake to be thick and moist as we like.

This cake was fabulous.  I made it for my husband's birthday, and, although he says he hates mayonnaise and can taste it in anything, he hadn't a clue there was mayo in the mix!  The second time I made the cake, I substiuted chcolate caramel bars for the chocolate mint patties, since I am not a huge fan of mint.  It was even better with a layer of peanuts on top of that to make a chocolate Snickers cake!  I will definitely be passing this recipe along to all of my friends and family!

I made this cake for my son's 4th birthday party. It was great!  People told me they really liked the cake.

I was a little concerned by some of the reviews that talked about the icing being runny.  I beat the icing for several minutes and when it still seemed runny, I put the icing pan in the freezer where it firmed up quite nicely.

I highly recommend this cake and will be saving the recipe.

My son loves chocolate mint, so I picked this cake to make for his 13th birthday. I would say the cake was OK, but not fantastic. The mint layer did taste good and was just the right amount of mint taste, not too strong. However, if I made this recipe again, I would use a different frosting recipe. After completing the frosting as directed, it was more like a glaze and way too runny to actually use to frost the cake. It took over an hour for the frosting to cool and thicken enough to put on the cake and that hour included time spent cooling in the refrigerator. 
Also, the cake layers took less than 25 minutes to cook. I checked them after 21 minutes and they were done. If I had left them in the full 25 minutes, they would have been overcooked.
Otherwise, this was an easy to make cake recipe with acceptable results.

WOW!!!
I have baked this cake twice now and both times it was a hit at my husband's office. He has brought it in around 7:00am and the cake has been gone by 9:00am.
I decided to bake it in a bundt pan and just drizzled the "frosting" over it. 
I have been asked for the recipe by several people and I have gladly shared it with them. 
Thank you for sharing it with us Cris!!
HAPPY BAKING!!!

I've made mayonnaise cakes before, but I find that this is the best "base" recipe, just make sure that the cakes are not overcooked, or they will go decidedly chewy. The first time I made this I happened to have a jar of Betty Crocker frosting in the cupboard, and, being a lazy person, I used that instead of making the frosting from the recipe. The result was absolutely superb, and I've used the store bought frosting ever since. One great thing about this recipe is that the mint stops the cake from becoming too overpowered by the chocolate content.

Cannot believe I forgot to rate this. I have made this more than once and LOVE IT.  I get nothing but rave reviews on it, people always tell me that it looks like it came from a bakery.  I add chocolate mints to the frosting while I am baking to give it that extra mint kick and then sprinkle with jimmies (chocolate sprinkles for those not from mass!!) to make it look nice... what a cake!!!

My husband asked for a mayonaise cake for his birthday.  I found this one. The mint intriqued me.  The cake was excellent, but I had a little trouble with the frosting.  I beat it and beat it, it never really got thick enough to spread on the cake.  It was more like a glaze. What I put on the sides of the cake, mostly ran off.  But the frosting tasted good.  I will make this again, but may try a different frosting. Love the thin mints between the layers.

This cake was really good, especially when served warm.  The recipe for the fudge frosting can also be used as a hot-fudge topping for ice cream!

I needed to make cupcakes so I followed the recipe exactly(except added some choc chips) but put a junior mint in each one.  Found it best after some trial and error to put in 1/2 a scoop of batter, lay on the mint and cover it w/ batter. They sink much less than pushing it down in after completely filling the cup.  If they sink, just throw a few choc chip in the indentation while warm so you have an even surface to frost. Piped on some PEPPERMINT(hint-always use peppermint extract-much more subtle-mint extract makes everything taste like toothpaste) buttercream frosting, drizzled them w/ melted chips and finished them w/ an Andes mint stuck in the icing-very rich but a huge hit-looked like they came from the cupcake store!

I did not care for this. the cake itself was too dry and not very good. did not try to make the icing because of the reviews on it. the only reason i am giving this 2 stars is because of the creamy melted mints.

My family uses Miracle Whip, not real mayonnaise, which is probably why my cake turned out SUPER dense and T-H-I-C-K! So if you're doing this, i'd recommend maybe adding an egg to fluff it up a tad?  It's a pretty good cake, not one of my absolute favourites, though.  And also, in the pan, the cake really doesn't spread, so make sure you spread it evenly beforehand!  I only had to bake it for 18 minutes and it was fully done, probably perfect time.. used York patties in the middle since i couldn't find Andes mints anywhere (weird!)  and iced it with "Mint Buttercream Frosting" from another recipe.  My brothers liked it, but weren't 100% gaga over it (they're true mint/chocolate fans)... i'm not sure if i would make it again, but it was pretty darn good :)

I just used the base cake recipe and made it in a Christmas Tree bundt pan then didn't use the mint or the frosting- I just dusted it with powdered sugar.  It rose well, but it tasted a lot like baking soda, so you really do need some sort of frosting or glaze to take away from that. Otherwise it was very chocolatey, just how I like it!

the cake had a very good taste, but was kind of heavy....also, I found that the frosting needs to sit for at least 30 minutes to cool enough to frost the cake with it.  Otherwise, it just runs all over the place.  Everything had a good flavor, it just wasn't what you would call "pretty" if you know what i mean

Wow, this is a really great base recipe for any chocolate cake.  I did add a tsp of peppermint extract to the batter and instead of layering the thin mints, I crushed them and put them into the batter, but that's just a matter of taste and ease (I was making cupcakes, per the special request of a friend).  Super-moist and delicious; thanks for a great recipe!

The cake was good, but the frosting was a horrible disappointment.  It never thickened, even after beating it forever and then refridgerating.  Use a different frosting if you are going to make this cake.

I had lost this recipe a long time ago and was thrilled to find it again just in time for my son's 6th birthday!  It was a huge hit with both him and the rest of my family.  It turned out nice and moist and very flavorable.  I didn't use the mints in the center as suggested but used chocolate buttercream icing instead.  I think that next time I'll try baking it with cake flour to see if i get a lighter texture.  All in all though, excellent recipe, and VERY easy to make!  Thanks bunches!

Boy was this good. I don't really care for chocolate. I made this for my grandson's birthday. It was so easy and really moist.I did as another reviewer did and used store frosting. The thin mints really are a nice touch. Will make this one again.

The outcome of this recipe was disappointing.  After reading some of the other reviews, I added some Canola oil to the batter to make it more moist.  The cake did not rise properly and it was still very dry.  I would not make this again.

The mint layer is great!  I used store-bought frosting.  The cake was a bit dry - I might try adding a bit of oil to the recipe next time.

I found this cake extremely dry and crumbly, even though I only baked for twenty minutes, and the taste was fairly bland. Like other reviewers, I also had to refrigerate the frosting for roughly an hour & then beat to get a spreadable consistency. Once finally finished, the taste was very good and fudgy.  Everyone wound up scraping the icing off of the cake and just eating that.

I liked the addition of mint, but found this particular cake to be on the dry side...the frosting was good, though.

Considering all the rave reviews I was expecting something exceptional.  I followed the directions exactly and it turned out OK.  It had a good flavor but I thought it was somewhat dry.  I liked the idea of the melted mint candies between the layers.  I might try it again with a different cake recipe.

This cake went a little wrong for me- firstly I didn't have two 9inch cake pans, so I used 1 deep pan, and sliced it apart for the mint slices. Because the cake was extra thick- it took too long to cook and came out a little chewy, and then I found that the icing was a little too runny, and almost completely ran off the cake! I made it for my sons b'day party, and I didn't have a practice run.. so it wasn't a great hit among the guests! I probably won't make it again- although it was better the next day (and I did manage to polish it off, and not let any of it go to waste!).

This was sooooo delicious!  I kept trying to stop eating it to give everyone else a chance to get a piece, but it was a little to difficult.  I'll definitely make this one again and again!

Very moist, the mint in the middle is a great addition, the frosting  is good and rich.
