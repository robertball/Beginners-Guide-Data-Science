This turned out good. I used fresh mint instead of dry because if you have it, why not? On that note, It think oregano or basil would have worked better for this. For the leftover I used basil and preferred it to the mint. Overall good recipe though and one I will make again.

Great recipe.  Both my husband and I loved it.  Made my own "Greek Seasoning" from AR.  Only thing I did different was to grill it flat  instead of rolling it.  We grilled it on one side, flipped it and sprinkled it with the feta.
