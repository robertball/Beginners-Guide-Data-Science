I've made this wonderful recipe several times and made it several different ways.  I usually add 1/2 cup chopped nuts to the crust and omit them in the filling.  And chopped pecans and walnuts taste just as good if you don't have any macadamia nuts.  I've used fresh chopped cranberries instead of dried and they come out really fresh and tart tasting.  I've also ommitted the glaze on top, I think it makes the bars a little bit too sweet.  Instead, I add 2 tsp. grated orange peel right into the filling, and don't put any glaze on.  If you do put the glaze on, don't stack the cookies, they stick to each other.  I cut them into small triangles and freeze them, they freeze so well.  I usually double the recipe and it makes the perfect amount for a 9 x 13 pan.

These were pretty good, definitely unusual.  My crust was really crumbly and didn't stay on the bar very well, so they didn't look as pretty as I had hoped, but overall they are colorful and interesting looking.  Everyone went for them at a neighborhood party.  I'd prefer more butter flavor in the crust, more of a shortbread texture and flavor, which this is not quite.  The filling is chewy and delicious.  My family and neighbors all thought they were delicious, but they didn't earn a 5 for me, mostly because of the crust.  Worth working on a giving another try.  Fairly expensive to make!

Very rich in taste.  Quite flavorful and buttery.  Not an inexpensive dessert to make.

Very easy. Great recipe, if a little too sweet. I think I'd try the other user's tip to forgoe the glaze and put the orange zest directly in the filling. Pre-cooking the crust was much easier than I thought it would be. I prepared the filling while it was cooking, so it didn't take as long as I thought it would.

These are absolutely AWESOME! We bought a ton of mac nuts in Hawaii earlier this month and I was looking for a great recipe to use them in! I have to say that I definitely will make these over and over with my stash! I doubled the recipe and used a 9X13 pan. Used my little Pampered Chef mini pizza crust roller thinger to get a perfectly even crust!  THE BEST!

I can't believe more people haven't tried this awesome recipe.  Really different from the typical bar cookie.  Very buttery tasting and not too sweet.  These would be a great addition to a holiday cookie tray.  Would be great with any type of nuts--I think I'll try toasted pecans next time--YUM!

Fabulous sweet tart, buttery flavor with an addictive texture! These were a big hit with everyone! I made them with walnuts instead of macadamia nuts because that's what I had on hand, and they were delicious. Next time I'll try the macadamia nuts for a likely even better flavor! Thanks for sharing the recipe.
