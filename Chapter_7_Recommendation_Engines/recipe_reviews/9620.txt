I this was a very good cookie recipe. I added one less egg and 1/2 cup less sugar and added 1 cup of chocolate chips. Everyone loved them.

Flavour was great, really easy, but they spread too much to be crinkles. They looked more like chocolate cookies with blobs of icing suger on them. They won't go in my christmas cookie boxes, but my son says thats not a problem. He's eaten most of them already.

I like these cookies around Christmas time and make them, plus other cookies. I use Hershey's cocoa (or any other type is fine as well) instead of the squares. That way you don't need to worry about melting chocolate. I also add an additional 1/3 c. for the flour and 3/4 c. for the oil instead of the 1/2.

This is a great recipe!
I'm not a very experienced baker. This was my first time using baking (unsweetened) chocolate, I think. I thought it's supposed to be problematic sometimes, but melting it worked like a charm for me. Also, for the flour, I used unbleached, though that shouldn't make much difference, I don't think.
I refrigerated the dough overnight (about 13 hours), and making the balls and rolling them in the confectioners' sugar was actually kind of fun. I wish I had more than one cookie sheet, because this really did make about 4 dozen cookies (24 servings of 2 cookies each), and it took a long time to bake all the cookies. Oh, and I baked them for 12 minutes, the high end of the range given.
The Woman I Love tried the cookies, too, and wants to give them a 5-star rating. I also gave a couple of dozen cookies to her co-workers, who also raved about them. I only give them a 4-star rating because I'm a perfectionist, but these are very yummy cookies - a little soft and brownie-like, and kind of attractive. And very easy to make. Thanks for a great recipe, which I'll be passing on to The Woman I Love.

I did make this I did have to bake them for 17 minutes. I do need to figure out how to make them again and have them not be so flat as these cookies are supposed to be a bit fluffy as well and crunchy. I have made these in the past following the instructions exactly and they turned out perfect but I was also at a higher elevation at the time as well. So I believe that the elevation that I currently reside in is the reason they were so flat. However, the picture for this recipe does have them being flat so maybe it is the recipe
