Delicious! This is so easy and I just love it when a few ingredients you have on hand combine to create something really good. This sweet butter spead is great on toasted cinnamon raisin bagels and warm pumpkin bread! This is perfect for the fall season. I can see a lot of uses for this stuff....

I was excited to try something new to serve with rolls at Thanksgiving, but I was not impressed with this.  It was too sugary...maybe less brown sugar would've made a difference.

I skipped the honey (didn't have any on hand) but I thought it was really tasty. I made it to go with the Downeast Maine Pumpkin Bread. Everyone really liked it. Thanks for the recipe!

This was awesome.  I took it to a brunch where the hostess had pumpkin pancakes.  It was a beautiful compliment.  Can't wait for sweet potato season.  It will be a perfect topping on those as well.

Was rather dissapointed, even with reducing the honey/sugar it was overpoweringly sweet. And the honey flavor was  bit too prominent. With a bit of tweaking this could be a very good recipe.

I used real maple syrup and left out the brown sugar so it wouldn't be so sweet, as the above reviews stated.  I also used 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice in place of the other spices and gave it a spin in the food processor.  Very light on flavor, which was what I was looking for, I will definately be keeping this recipe to "play" with.

I've edited this recipe with various herb-infused honeys. Lavender honey makes this butter AMAZING, especially to use in baking recipes. Rosemary honey makes this butter delightful with pancakes. Delicious on it's own merit and fantastic to play around with. Thanks so much!

Quite good and fast to make. I tried a little bit of the seasoning mixture with a low cal spread. Bad idea. It doesn't mix well, so use butter as per recipe

So simple and extremely good.  I cut back on the sugar and only used one Tbsp of honey. Grated fresh nutmeg and cinnamon but used ground ginger. Ate it with buttermilk biscuits. Yummm!

Very Good! I used this on a sweet cardamon bread and it was wonderful. I will be making this again for use on future sweet breads. I did cut the brown sugar down to half.

Wow, this was really good! You don't need nutmeg if you dont have it on hand, and changing the amount of spices doesnt make a difference. I made this to go on the Apple Cider Pancakes on this site. Fabulous. It's very strong however....if you dont have a big sweet tooth you should cut down the spices. But it's very good.

Fantastic! Super simple to make, and delicious! I used it today on simple chocolate muffins, but I can see it being good on rolls, toast, corn bread...anything!

Cut the sugar and honey to 2T and 1T, approximately, did not really measure any of it closely.
Served with Dr. Michaels Yeasted cornbread for a potluck, it was a hit.

it was sweet, but way to runny for my use.
