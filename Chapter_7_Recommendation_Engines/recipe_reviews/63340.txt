One sure way to ruin Brussels sprouts (or almost any vegetable for that matter) is to overcook them. This was perfect cooked for 7-10 minutes rather than 15.  This is a good, basic recipe, made even better with the addition of garlic, sliced shallots,and crumbled, fried bacon. A little chopped, fresh, red bell pepper would be a nice splash of color too.

We prefer the Brussel Sprouts somewhat less tender at the start...We add some crushed garlic, and just steam the Brussel Sprouts about 5 - 6 minutes....Then saute all in a large frying pan till they are crisp tender...Also, can add some halved cherry or grape tomatoes at the end and sprinkle with parmesean cheese.

My husband is not a picky eater, however, he does not care for Bruseels Sprouts.  I made this tonight for dinner and he actually went back for seconds!  Very tasty.  Thanks for the recipe.

Recipe was ruined with cooking instructions...to boil for 15 minutes.  I took them out after 12 minutes and it was already overcooked.  Otherwise the recipe has potential, but have had better brussels sprouts.  Try sauteed brussel sprouts with garlic or shallots, add a little liquid (chicken stock or wine).

This was really good! I used olive oil instead of butter and steamed the brussels sprouts instead of boiling them until they were fork tender (about 7-8 minutes). I also used sliced mushrooms instead of whole. Very tasty! Will definitely be making this again.

Very good!  I really loved the presentation this dish made.  Next time, I'll try this recipe using fresh parsely and real lemon. (I used dried parsely and lemon concentrate.)  The mushrooms seemed too big to leave whole so, I cut into chunky slices, which turned out excellent!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  4/2/06  I made this again, this time I grilled this dish and used about 2 cloves of fresh garlic, canned mushrooms, no lemon juice, and seaoned with onion powder, salt and pepper.

This was very good. I couldn't get fresh brussel sprouts so I used frozen and it still came out good. Next time I will use less butter. I don't think it needed that much.

This was an excellent way to serve brussel sprouts.  The presentation is beautiful and I will make this again for my family although my 3 year old would have nothing to do with it.  I'll also make this for company as it is yummy AND pretty.  The key is the FRESH parsley and and lemon.  Do not sub dried herbs or bottled juice.

I was looking for a brussels sprouts recipe, and this was delicious! I used Olivio instead of butter, and used less than the recipe called for. I also used dried parsley, and stirred some halved grape tomatoes in at the very end. I will definitely make this again.

This was great!   As other viewers suggested I....  steamed instead of boiled (which is better nutritional value), added garlic, and cut the amount of butter.   Thanks for the base recipe!

Pretty good.  I used frozen brussels sprouts, and cooked according to the package - simmer in some water about 7 minutes.  For sauteeing the mushrooms, I used 2 Tbsp. olive oil and only 1 Tbsp. butter.  It was just the right amout and had great flavor.  I also added some fresh minced garlic, which I think is a must!

I've tried frozen and fresh... Definitely go with fresh if you can!! Makes a big difference. I hate soggy veggies.

Being diabetic and always looking for something healthy AND yummy, this has become a staple in my diet. However, I Highly recommend cutting them in half after steaming or boiling them then cooking them on high heat flat side down in the butter. That would make it five! Personally, I like it with garlic salt and omitting the lemon juice. Delicious.

I love this recipe and so does my entire family. Whenever we have a family gathering, they always want me to make this dish. I add a little more salt to the water when boiling, but that's just me. This recipe is great! For those of you who didn't "care" for it, well that's just your opinion :)

Very good.  After reading some other reviews, I also added garlic, veggi bacon, and onion to the butter (and olive oil mixture).  It was really good, especially since I am not a brussel sprout fan.  My husband practically licked the serving bowl clean, although my kids wouldn't even touch it.  They were mortally offended that I added sprouts AND mushrooms to their dinner plate.  Oh well, what can you expect? =)

Nice simple way to spruce up brussel sprouts.  After reading reviews, used sliced mushrooms & steamed brussels instead.  Will definitely make again.

Great recipe, thanks!  Of course I already love Brussels sprouts and that helps, but this is a great way to prepare them.  I made this for Thanksgiving and heard words like awesome around the table!  I agree with others that it's important to not overcook Brussels sprouts.  I always cut the largest ones in half and then steam the batch til tender and bright green.  Mmmmn.

I made this exactly as written (besides boiling the brussels sprouts for about 5 minutes) and it was excellent! I used sliced baby portabella mushrooms. Can bacon and garlic be added like everyone seems to be doing? Sure, but I actually wanted to taste the brussels sprouts and mushrooms. Bacon and garlic will cover a lot of that earthy flavor. The lemon juice was a great touch and gave the perfect amount of tartness.

My brussel sprouts were a little mushy.  Next time I won't cook them so long.  I used a whole stick of butter and added a few more mushrooms.  This was a GREAT recipe.  Even my boyfriend who doesn't like brussel sprouts enjoyed this dish.

I like Brussels Sprouts but my spouse doesn't like them. This recipe changed her mind. In fact she is making this recipe as I write this! Since I am following Weight Watchers we substituted light smart balance for the butter - turns out to be 1pt/serv.

Really easy and sooo good. Didn't have parsley so I didn't add that. It all came together so nicely as one of our Christmas sides with ham.  Will do this one again for sure.

Love this recipe.  I never quite liked brussel sprouts until trying them this way.  I usually saute sliced cremini mushrooms with half of an onion(diced) in a mixture of olive oil and butter.  Fresh or dried parsley depending on whats in my refrigerator.  Good with or without the lemon juice.

I will steam the brussel sprouts next time, rather than boiling. Couldnt get enough of the moisture out for my liking. Great idea, though. We enjoyed it!!

This is great!  I used about 3 Tb (total) of olive oil and butter.  (Would have been greasy for my taste with 5 Tb.)  Added a clove of garlic, and skipped the parsley because I didn't have any.  I did find the cook time to be too long.  7 minutes was plenty.  Yummy way to cook brussels sprouts!

This was a very rich dish, and maybe a little over the top in that sense.  I used the full 5 tablespoons of butter the recipe calls for, and even with 5 cups of brussel sprouts and double the mushrooms (I love mushrooms!) my husband and I thought I still could have used less butter.  In the future, I'll probably cut the butter in half for our own family dinners.  But, I'll probably keep it the same if I'm entertaining.

This recipe is quick and easy. I never thought of adding lemon juice but it really brought out the flavors of the brussel sprouts. My husband went back for seconds! I will use this recipe again and again plus share it with my friends and family. Thank You.

The only reason I am giving this 5 stars is because for it to be brussels sprouts it was GREAT!  My son ate them like candy.  I am not really a brussel sprouts person but there were none left on the plate.  Definitely will cook again!

Two things... 1) Don't boil for 15 minutes unless you want mush, I boiled for about 5-6 and finished in the saute pan.  2) There is no need for 5 tbls of butter, about half is plenty.  Overall pretty good, I had all the ingredients on hand to use so it worked, not sure if I'll make again.

We love this recipe - even my husband, who does not like brussels sprouts, loves it!  I have made this several times, but this last time I steamed the halved sprouts & sauteed some chopped onions before adding mushrooms to the pan.  I didn't use the parsley or lemon juice & it was a HIT!!!

This was only my 3rd time eating brussel sprouts let alone cook them.   I really loved them!   The only thing different I did was add some garlic and eliminated the parsely since I didn't have any.   The lemon juice on top was delicious!   I did clean off the outer leaves and then steamed them in the microwave for about 7 minutes.  Delicious!

Yummy!  I love brussel sprouts, just steamed, but all of us need to jazz things up a bit and this was great.  I went much lighter on the butter and chose margarine and a lot less of it since I am watching fat and calories.  I also went a little heavy on the lemon juice simply b/c I love acidic flavors.  I'll be making this often!

We liked this recipe as far as brussel sprouts go. I cut up my mushrooms into slices,after I started with the whole mushroom and then noticed that only the tops were browning and not cooking the bottoms. Maybe I was suppose to pull out the stems because that would work too. Anyways, good recipe!

Easy and tastes good.  I don't really care for brussel sprouts, though.

I never would have thought to put mushrooms together with brussel sprouts, but they were delicious.

Very good recipe. I've had to learn how to correct cook brussel sprouts. My pickiest eater asked for seconds.

Excellent recipe except for cooking  time.  I didnt 'ding' the recipe for that because I seldom follow cooking times and temps (because I know how to cook).

For me, steaming until bright and slightly tender was the way to go. 

I did substitute lime/lemon, but only because I didn't have the lemon.  My twin boys (8) love it as did I.

I have just started loving Brussels sprouts in the past few years. This recipe is fantastic! I used about 2 Tablespoons olive oil in place of all that butter and added about 1/4 tsp. dried thyme.  I do believe these were the hit of my dinner!

Wow! I was looking for a way to get myself to eat these.  It was one of those "Eat your vegetables," when growing up, so I would see them on the produce isle and speed past.  This recipe was amazing! It tasted nothing like the terrible vegetable I remembered. Thanks for the great recipe!

I had never tried brussel sprouts before.  The combo of the mushrooms with them was good.  I seasoned the mushrooms with garlic salt.  I think if I make brussel sprouts again, it will be this way

This was the perfect side for my filets this Christmas.   I, too, sliced the 'shrooms, and steamed the sprouts, added some shaved garlic, and added a minced pickled jalapeno pepper... the lemon and butter brought it all together in fine form!  BIG HIT!  Thanks for a delicious submission!

I steamed the brussel's sprout instead of boiling- taste great and it was not bitter! I will definitely use fresh parsley next time. The mushrooms definitely had to be sliced. I also thought a sliver of sliced, roasted almonds would really dress this up and bring out the gourmet taste!!!!

We love Brussels sprouts and didn't think they could be improved... but this was yummy!  I started off trying to be healthy with only 2T of butter, but ended up adding another 2T because the mixture was dry.  Like a previous reviewer, I cut the mushrooms (we used baby bellas) in thick slices.

This is a really good side dish.  I hadn't had Brussels sprouts in years and wanted to find a good recipe for them and this worked very well.  I think next time I may put some butter on the Brussels sprouts as well as the mushrooms.

Changes I made to this recipe: sliced the mushrooms instead of cooking them whole, cooked the brussel sprouts for 10 minutes instead of 15.  The vegetables looked nice when served, and my husband liked it.  I though they tasted kind of bland but am not sure what was needed to give them more of a zing.

This was my first brussel sprout recipe and I loved it.  My husband, whom I made this for, said he prefered just steamed sprouts but I figured I needed something added to stomach these veggies.  I LOVED THEM! and ate them for leftovers the next day!

Very good! It was refreshing having a recipe that didn't alter the taste of fresh veggies. I did have to halve the mushrooms I used because they were a bit large. I didn't even add the parsely.

Roasted instead of boiling to save flavor of sprout. Used same seasonings  plus garlic though! Excellent!

I used the suggestions from other reviews. Boiled 1/2 the time and a little added red bell pepper, green onion and sliced turkey bacon to the sautéed mixture. This was my family’s favorite Brussels sprout recipe  thanks!!

This was delicious! I boiled the brussel sprouts for 12 min instead of 15 they came out perfect. Also before I melted the butter I put a little olive oil in the pan, seasoned it with salt/pepper and sauteed 2 cloves of minced garlic then continued with the directions melting the butter and adding the mushrooms which I sliced, not sure why it didn't mention slicing them. Even my Mother who doesn't like brussel sprouts loved this dish. For sure making this again and again!

I cut the portions back to three and steamed the brussels sprouts for 5 minutes like a few other reviewers. The earthiness of the mushrooms plays nicely with the bitterness of the sprouts. We enjoyed this and I will probably make it again.

I boiled the Brussels sprouts for about 10 minutes and it was fine--maybe even 8-9 minutes would have been perfect. They turned a beautiful bright green, and I think cooking for longer would have made them dark and dull.  I also used only half the amount of butter, and more mushrooms (we love 'em). Good recipe, but better with the alterations mentioned.

This recipe needs no changes .  I made  it just as shown.  Simple, beautiful and  delicious. Will definitely be a regular in our house . I've been cooking for 40 years and  never made fresh brussel sprouts. Now I won't  go back to the ones in the box.

I think this recipe is good, but needs a little something....I do not know what it is. I did like the fact that the lemon reduced the bitterness of the sprouts very well....in fact, this is the first recipe in which the Brussels sprouts' did not have the faint bitter after taste. I might use less butter next time though

Made this last night,  only difference was I added prosciutto (which I sautéed then added butter) came out great.  Would definitely make again.

I never would have thought i'd like mushrooms and lemon, but this is delish! I'm not sure I would have combined the brussels with mushrooms. Great recipe. I steamed the brussel sprouts first instead of boiling. Worked great.
