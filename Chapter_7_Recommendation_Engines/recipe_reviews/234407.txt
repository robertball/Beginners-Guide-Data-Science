I cooked this after work one night, and did not use the slow-cooker. I browned 90% lean burger with onion and garlic, then drained well. I used frozen vegetables instead of canned - I always use fresh or frozen, never canned - and made my own beef broth from a powdered broth base/seasoning, instead of already-made. Instead of tomato sauce, I used fresh diced tomatoes. This recipe needs a lot of seasoning, because it is very bland as written. I was very generous with garlic salt, pepper, and dried parsley. I also added a tsp of Penzey's Beef Roast seasoning and used 1 tbsp of Melissa's fresh parsley paste. Season your heart out!! Next time, I'll be using two cans of diced tomatoes and adding half a bag of pearl onions.

My mom would always makes something called Campers Stew when we camped.  It was much like this but a can of alphabet soup instead of the tomato sauce!!  YUM.   Making this for my little campers tonight.

Kind of tasteless, and it was too fatty.  Might want to brown the ground beef first: it was completely inedible because of all the fat when we tried it fresh, had to keep it in the fridge to skim the fat off the next day.  Followed this exactly except for the can of green beans (doubt that would have made a difference).

Easy and flavorful recipe. And the great thing about Hobo or Camper stew is it's great for substitutions... whatever you have on hand. Did it exactly by the recipe but it'd work with any meat and can change out vegetables and type of onion.

The only thing I did different was that I cooked the hamburger first before putting it in. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a T and it came out great! Thanks so much for the recipe!

This was good!! Cooked meat before as it was not sirloin, added carrots but forgot peas ( was gonna use frozen). Made the base from beef bouillon since thatâ€™s what I had. I thought flavor was great, hubby thought it needed a bit more. Will make again!

I used a lot of different vegetables in this, frozen Asian vegetables, frozen green beans, I can of sweet corn, some cauliflower and red pepper because I forgot to get the canned items at the store.   I also added a lot of black pepper and a lot of garlic.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this on the stove instead, brought to a boil then let it simmer for an hour. Left out the peas but added barley. Great meal for the changing weather. Even my kid enjoyed it, ate his whole bowl.
Will definitely make again

I am one of those people who modifies a recipe so it's a bit unfair to review it.  However, this was a hit with husband and daughter so here are my modifications.  I didn't have celery seeds or parsley so omitted them and instead added thyme and marjoram (I dump some of each into my hand and judge whether I think it's enough so can't say exactly how much of each - maybe a tablespoon).  And I used a family size bag of frozen mixed vegetables - the brand which has sliced, rather than diced, carrots.  Otherwise I used the same ingredients and amounts.  Makes a nice large pot of soup so there are left-overs and it freezes well.

We really like this Hobo ground beef and vegetable soup.
I added cabbage cut in small pieces.

This was yummy, but I made a few changes.  To the beef broth I added red wine, about a cup or more, seasonings like parsley, oregano, taco seasoning, dill,  and sweet potato, along with all the other ingredients. I should have put more salt in it. I served it with garlic cheese biscuits and it was very good. I will make it again!

Made this today and doubled recipe so I could freeze some. This is very similar to my mother's recipe which I had lost. I did brown the ground beef first and drained off grease. I didn't add any salt either since it was mostly canned veggies I added. As one reviewer mentioned it seemed a bit bland so added Worcestershire sauce and more black pepper. The grandkids and hubby loved it!

I used canned chicken breast instead of beef. It was delicious. None left over. Will definitely make it again.

I made this for my 94 & 97 years young in-laws, who could eat soup every single day.  I did use a bag of frozen veggies in place of the canned, as the submitter suggested.  Made as written, it is good, and my MIL will love it.  But, for my DH and I it is a little bland.  I froze a large, medium and small container for quick meals for them.
