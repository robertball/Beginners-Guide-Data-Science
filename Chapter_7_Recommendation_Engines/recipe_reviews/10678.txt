Hard to work with. The dough was too crumbly and once cooked the marshmallow oozed out of the cracks of the "crackle cooke" which is what it was - not a puff. I tore up big marshmallows to mini-marshmallow size. The tast is decent so with the second batch I got a 9x9 pan put half of the dough in the bottom sprinkled marshmallows on top and then pressed the remaining dough on top and made marshmallow puff bars.:) It was MUCH easier and the results were just as good. I likely cooked it for 20-25 minutes? I do not advise the ball route. All in all probably won't make again but thanks for putting it up!

While making the cookies was an easy process this took me a long time. I don't think I did anything wrong but the cookie dough was crumbly so it was hard to form around the marshmallows. And in the baking process the marshmallows melted and disolved into the cookie leaving a little hole in the center. That part was VERY diappointing. But overall the cookies were a huge hit. Everyone in the office loved them!

Really good! I cut the recipe from 30 servings down to 20 servings but still used 2 full eggs. This made the dough perfect. They did keep well in a rubbermaid container. The kids loved the process of making these.

I had success with this recipe. My suggestion for anyone dealing with crumbly dough is to add a little bit of milk. For me the milk made the dough perfect to work with and kept them moist! I also got creative with the decoration and rolled them in different colored granulated sugars! Great flavor!!! I have a photo I will try to post!!
