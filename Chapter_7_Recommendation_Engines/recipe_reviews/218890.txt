I make mine a little differently, but same concept. I cut the ends off the watermelon leaving the center flat on both sides, remove the rind to form an actual cake shaped watermelon and then decorate with other fruit using toothpicks to secure the pieces that need to stay in place.  For the leaves, flowers, stars or other shapes I use cookie cutters or just a paring knife. 

Great alternative to a traditional cake and everybody raves about the look. It takes me about an hour to make, mostly cutting up all the fruit; putting it together is fun, easy and kid friendly. Any leftover fruit goes in a side bowl for fruit salad. My family always eats the bowl first saying the cake's too pretty to eat..

This "100% Fruit Cake" was a huge hit! I made mine 3 hours in advance and placed it in a pie plate by chance because I was taking it to a picnic. A lot of fruit juice seeped from the fruit, but fortunately the edges of the pie plate caught the excess fruit juice so I didn't have a big mess. I just "drank away" the excess juice with a straw. From now on when I make this recipe I will place the cake in my flan pan both to catch the juices and so I can stack up lots of fruit for garnish. Thank you InTheKitchen for sharing your recipe.

This was a great alternative to the traditional cake.  However, don't let it fool you, it isn't as easy as it looks!  Worth the effort though.

I made this for a friend’s birthday “cake” and she loved it. It doesn’t take any longer to make than plain fruit salad. The results are worth the time.
