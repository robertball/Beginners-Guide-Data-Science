This was beyond exceptional - I loved it! As other reviewers suggested I added a can of coconut milk an hour before it was finished cooking. The flavors in this dish are layered and complex and yet simple to prepare.  I tasted every spice and nothing more prominent than the other, this was simply fabulous. I know I will make this again as we finished all of the chicken tonight and thats unusual for a first time dish.

This recipe is so wonderful, my husband loves it, I love it not only for the taste but for the sheer fact I can start it at noon and not have to worry about it. The only change I made was in the last 30 mins to an hour of cooking I add coconut milk which gives the sauce a wonderful creamy texture. I serve with brown rice, naan bread, mango chutney & chopped  onions. Definitely a keeper. Thanks.

It's hard to find good slow cooker chicken recipes without a lot of added fat (creamy soups, sour cream, cream cheese, etc.)  This recipe is low fat AND very yummy!  I dredged the chicken in flour as others suggested, and used only 1/4 tsp. of the cayenne pepper because I was afraid my kids would think it was too spicy.  It turned out very well.  My husband had seconds and my 6 yr. old said I should make it again!

Made for a church pot-luck and got raves, especially from the former India missionaries!  Definitely: flour the chicken; add the coconut milk; increase the amount of curry powder and ginger.  I also added a hefty dose of dried sage, a couple of dashes of garlic powder and a couple of Tbsp dried onion flakes, and served with jasmine rice from my smaller slow cooker (ratio of 1 cup rice to 1 1/4 cups water on Low for an hour or so).  Even better the next day.  Ethnic and comforting!  Thx much.

We loved this recipe. We added the coconut milk and a thing of frozen spinach since I am always looking for ways to sneak in veggies. I shredded the chicken and served it over rice- it was stew-like.

This was an awesome recipe!! I'm not a huge fan of rice...so i use a great pasta called Orzo...it looks kinda like rice, but i like the texture much better. I also added a can of coconut milk near the end, which was great! I'll probably use half the cayenne pepper next time...it was too spicey for us. It kinda over powered the other flavors, but over all it was a great dish!! (also i may add more currey next time, it wasn't a very strong flavor. The sweet orange was the best!

I was a little put off by the negative reviews, but I tried this recipe anyway. The result? I loved it, and it is the first time after a year of using recipes from this site that I have been motivated to leave a review.

I always get annoyed at people who review a recipe and talk about the changes they made to it, but I did make some changes to conform with my tastes and what I had on hand. Instead of the boneless skinless chicken breasts, I used 2 large chicken breasts with bone and skin (about 2 lbs.). I also used a 15.5 oz. jar of marmalade (Publix low sugar, no artificial sweetener), a little bit less than a cup of stock, 1 Tbsp of curry powder, 1/2 tsp of cayenne, and no ginger. 

I cut 3 Yukon gold potatoes into eights and put those in the bottom of the slow cooker. Then I cut the breasts into thirds, rubbed them with salt and pepper, and put those in. I poured the other ingredients on top and then added a sliced large yellow onion and a chopped red pepper. I let it cook on low for 7 hours.

The chicken was delicious but slightly dry; 6 hours would have probably been better. The skin and bones came right off. The sauce had a wonderful flavor. In fact, I refrigerated the liquid, skimmed off the fat, and will use it to make rice. The most pleasant surprise was the flavor the onions and potatoes had. The onions were sweet/savory, and the potatoes were like the perfect marriage between a potato and sweet potato.

I love this recipe. It's a definite keeper for me!

In the end I really liked this.  I say it that way because when I got home and lifted the lid on my crock pot the first thing I thought was oohhh this is way to sweet and I thought I have to cut back on that flavor somehow.  I started off with the original recipe with the addition of the coconut milk right away (I wasn't going to be home 1 hour befor supper)I had also cut the cayenne way down to begin with so I added about 1/8 of a tsp. more at a time.  I think I ended up with about 3/4 of a tsp. in total.  The heat of the cayenne helps with the sweet of the jam I think.  The other things I used to cut back on the sweet flavor were chopped onions and a tsp. or so of toasted cumin seeds.  I know other had used garlic, but I didn't want to stray too far from the original recipe.  It does lack color if you serve it with white rice, so I will serve it with a green veg. of some sort and a cucumber yogurt dip of some sort to cool the pallet.  In the end I'm left with a sweet spicy dish that reminds me of India which I'm happy with and will make again.  It took a bit, but I'm happy with the result.

I combined this recipe with another and made a couple of changes.  I cut the chicken into chunks and tossed it in flour before I put it in the slow cooker.  It cooked a lot faster this way - probably about 3-4 hours on low.  I also left out all of the spices except for the ginger, since I didn't have them in the cupboard :).  The sauce was a little runny, but I didn't measure the ingredients exactly, so I might have put a little too much chicken stock in.  My family really liked the flavor.  It was sweet, but not too much.  I served it over rice, which turned out great.

This was a terrific recipe!!  I did make some tweeks.  I used a 3lb bag of frozen chicken breast tenders - skinless/boneless.  I also used a jar of mango chutney because I did not have orange marmalade on hand.  I added 1/2 cup orange juice, 1 tsp chopped garlic and 1 onion chopped.  I also upped the ginger from a pinch to 1/2 tsp.  Then1/2 hour before I was ready to serve I added 1 can of coconut milk, 1/2 cup chunky peanut butter and 2 cups instant rice because there was a lot of liquid in the pot.  It was one of the best dishes ever.  My whole family loved it.  The kids (ages 7 and 9) really liked it and my husband said it was one of his new favorites.  I can't wait to try it with the Orange Marmalade next time.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

I thought this turned out nice. I forgot to put in the pingh of ginger. I also thickened it with 2 tbls. of cornstarch mixed with 2 tbls. water. I took the chicken out and stirred the mixture in and let it cook on high for a bit to thicken the sauce up. I will have to try adding the coconut milk next time. We served it over rice.

This was excellent.  I am really surprised at some of the negative reviews.  If you are expecting an EAST Indian curry you will be disappointed.  This is more of a West Indian curry and is sooooo tasty.  I made a couple of modifications:  I used peach apricot preserves since that is what I had on hand and I only used about 9oz.  I also used Madras Curry Powder and doubled it.  I used fresh ginger root about a tablespoon and I put in a couple of cloves of garlic.  I also added potatoes and green and yellow peppers.  Yummy!

Delicious! I’m only giving it four stars because I change the recipe some- I add a whole can of coconut milk to the crockpot before cooking. Totally amps up the flavor!

Instant favorite!  With just minimal adjustments this dish was perfect.  I served it with carmelized onion naan over a bed of rice and quinoa.  Lots of flavors here..I had fun as my wife tried to identify the different tastes in it without knowing the ingredients (she couldn't put her finger on the marmalade).  The modifications I made are as follows:  1 250 ml jar marmalade, 3 teaspoons curry powder and add 1 can coconut milk 1 hour before it is done.  I did NOT find this dish too sweet or too spicy at all...just right.  I will be making this many times over.

I loved this chicken. I didn't have marmalade so I threw in a jar of kumquat jelly, I was afraid that would make it too sweet ( smelled it while it was cooking) so I threw some Teriyaki sauce, mustard, and some other spices (can't remember what all now) on top. It came out great! I think even if I had left it the other way it would have been terrific! I served it over rice and my hubby and picky kiddos ate all of it!

I used a store-bought marmalade and I think that contributed to the dish being waaay too sweet.  In the end, I added heaps of veggies (potatoes, carrots, ocra, red peppers, onions and garlic) and poured in a half cup of cream to thicken because it was watery and wasn't sure what I could eat it with (whether rice, bread or noodle).  My hubs didn't enjoy it though he finished it to encourage me.

I like the idea of curry and fruit but maybe not something as tart as marmalade.  Jackfruit or pineapple would be lovely.

I would think long slow cooking would make for tender chicken, but not so. I started with only semi-defrosted chicken and so I cooked on high for 4 hours. Maybe that was a food science faux pas, but the chicken is very dry and tough. The marmalade flavor doesn't really permeate the meat, but is pretty sweet (almost too sweet). The cayenne is also quite strong, but the curry doesn't come through much at all. I'd be interested to try the coconut milk idea, but I'm really not sure I'd risk wasting another bunch of chicken breasts and a jar of marmalade on this recipe.

Smuckers makes a Low Sugar orange marmalade that does not have artificial sweetener. I used this bc I didn't want the recipe to be too sweet and it was delicious!! I made no other changes except that I used 3 bone-in chicken breasts cooked on High for 3 hours. I will definitely make this again!

Loved this!  I made just as recipe states.  The chicken was dry though, as others have said, not sure why...maybe I overcooked chicken...maybe the sweet citrus marmalade sucks the juices out of the chicken?  But will make again!

I made this, halving the recipe, with the addition of (lite) coconut milk in the last hour of cooking as others recommended. I had already increased the quantity of both the ginger and the curry powder, and it was still lacking somewhat in flavor. Served with oven roasted carrots, red peppers, onions, over brown rice. Additional salt improved the taste, but overall, we didn't love this dish, despite its simplicity.

Great recipe.  followed other reviews and added coconut milk.  Would've given 5 stars if recipe was written w/ that in it.  So easy, tasted great, and leftovers were gobbled up by coworkers.  Everyone asked for the recipe.

Thanks for sharing this recipe. My husband, who can be very picky about his curry, loved it! I followed others' suggestions, and this is how I modified the dish. Dredged the chicken in flour with salt and pepper (also cut up the chicken into bite-sized pieces). Used half of an 18oz jar of marmalade. It was still a bit too orange-y for my taste so I know to use less next time. Used 2 tsp curry powder (a bit more next time - we love stronger curry flavor). Used only 1/4 tsp of cayenne, and I'm glad I did because it had just enough kick and wasn't too spicy for my kids. Added half a can of coconut milk the last half hour. The dish came out creamy and had so many layers of flavor in it. My husband said it's a definite repeat!

My husband said this was the best chicken I have ever fixed and that's after 43 years. I fixed it pretty much the way it reads.  We got home late from work so it was well pased ready and it was still very good.  Served it with rice and sautéed spinach on the side.  I have been more impressed with some of my other chicken dishes but they were a world more work.  This takes the easiest and best record.

Yummy. A little on the sweet side, but has a nice kick from the cayenne. I added the coconut milk as well. But, I'd like to try it without and compare.

I had high hopes for this recipe based on the reviews but my end result was dry and overly sweet.  I didn't think the amount of marmalade seemed right but I still followed the measurements per the recipe.  I had also added about a can of lite coconut milk so maybe this added to the sweetness.  But overall it was the orange marmalade that stood out too much even after I added a tablespoon of curry paste.  Next time I would use half the marmalade and only cook on high 2 to 3 hrs.

Not a hit with my family--they ate it, but not with rave reviews.  The flavors melded well together, but we thought it was too sweet.  If I could find a no-sugar marmalade I might make it again.

Attempted twice- 1st Attempt: I put my slow cooker on LOW for 7 hours but unfortunately, the chicken was REALLY dry and the sauce more like carmel...2nd Attempt: Tried it in a neighbor's slow cooker on LOW for 5 hours and same results...

I had to leave the skinless, boneless chicken breasts in the cooker for almost 10 hours due to work.  Chicken was super moist and very flavourful, it just wasn't a flavour that my family enjoyed.  Way too sweet.  I did the recipe just as stated.  Perhaps using coconut milk and thickening up the sauce would help.  Not a keeper for us.

Delicious! One person said too sweet but I disagree. the marmalde/curry/cayenne pepper make a sweet/hot combo.  And I only could find a high fructose marlmade and it was great. Its a pretty colorless dish. I will add peas and chunked sweet potatoes next time for color and some veggies. Huge hit!

This is a pretty easy recipe and I liked it a lot.  However, I made some minor changes.  I doubled the chicken stock and by the way, it was still spicy. I love spicy, so I did not mind.  Next time I will not double the stock.  I thought I needed to since I was using extra chicken. It was the perfect blend of sweet and spicy in my opinion.  I added the cornstarch (1 TB) to make the sauce thicker.  I also added fresh basil and the juice of half a lemon.  It REALLY made the sauce come alive!!!!  I served this over orzo pasta with steamed broccoli. It was all so good together.  The broccoli was fab in this sauce.  I love this recipe b/c it was not full of fat and creaminess  like a lot of slow cooker recipes.  If you don't like spicy, you should still try this and just cut the cayenne in half.  I did it with the full amount and my husband still liked it although he usually won't eat spicy food.  I felt like this was a fun way to cook the chicken while getting an extremely healthy veggie incorporated, too.

Did not like this at all.  I added the coconut milk as suggested and no one in my family would eat it.  For some reason the chicken came out hard too.  Not tender like the meat usually does in the crock pot.  Not sure what went wrong.

This is an awesome recipe that you can really make your own.  I only added 2 tablespoons of marmalade instead of a full cup.  I also added hot sauce and 3 tablespoons of curry instead of 1 1/2.  I used about 1/4th of a cup of corn starch to thicken.  I also found that using chicken WITH bones/skin added a lot more flavour as it cooked.  Once the chicken was "fall off the bone" I pulled it out and chopped it up, then threw it back in for about a half hour.  Enjoy!!

I followed the recipe and cooked the chicken on low for 7 hours and the result was very dry chicken and the sauce had basically evaporated and carmelized. I will not prepare this dish again and I had such high hopes!

This is an awesome dish.  Followed the recepie almost exactly.  Put a little less marmalade init.  Used legs and thighs.  cooked it on low for 6 hours.  Put it over rice. My husband liked it.  His suggestion was to maybe add some jalapeno peppers to make it a little on the spicy side. Something i did not know was that the coconut  milk is down the international foods aisle in the store. Will surely try this again

It was my own fault, I should have followed my gut feeling but after reading so many positive reviews I had to try it.  This is NOT for people who like a spicy,non-sweet curry. The marmalade overpowers the entire dish. But I'm glad so many others have enjoyed it out there!

I may have cooked this too long, as it was on high when I thought it was on low, but the taste was great.  It was soupy, so I wonder how it would do without the broth.  Love the taste thought and would do it again.

Made with apricot jam as I can lots of that and 1 cup of chicken stock as I only used 8oz container or jam. After 5 hours on low took chicken out , put 2 teaspoons of corn starch mixed with cold water and mixed and returned chicken for another 30 minutes.  Very flavorful without being overpowering. Husband loved it.

I liked it.  Super easy and a lot of flavor.  I used apricot preserves b/c I did not have marmalade.  It was not too sweet for me, I do have a sweet tooth.  I found the spices were fine but i may add a little more cayenne pepper next time.  I cooked it on low for about 4 hours and than shredded it in the crockpot.  i let it cook about 1 more hour at low.  I always shredd crockpot chicken so it does not dry out and is not bland.  I would like to try adding the coconut milk but my husband hates it and I really do not need the extra calories.

This was good. A great change of pace from what I usually make in the slow cooker. However, I didn't find the slowcooker to be a benefit. I made something very similar and just as good in 15 minutes on the stove.

Wonderful recipe and very simple to prepare. I added an extra tsp of curry and coated the chicken in flour. I also added chunks of potatoes, a few onions and 2 tsp of minced garlic. I cooked it on low for 4 1/2 hours and then added a can of coconut milk to make the sauce creamy. Everyone in my family loved it except for one of my sons who "doesn't do anything with oranges"...boy did he miss out!! We served it over steamed rice with corn on the side. The only change I will make next time is to add a bit of cornstarch to thicken the sauce just a wee bit. 5 hours was definitely enough time...any longer than 5 1/2 and I think it may dry out the chicken.

Nice flavour, but it came out dry for me.  I stuck to the recipe more or less, but used only about 70% of the amount of marmalade that is called for (because it came in a 250 ml jar), and doubled the cayenne peper because I figured that this would come out too sweet.  I also just used two fairly large chicken breasts, dredged in flour first.  There was enough sauce to cover them.  In the end, I still found it too sweet, but thought that the mild heat from the cayenne and the sourness of the orange marmalade was a nice touch.  I will try it again and reduce the amount of marmalade and maybe add some red wine vinegar to try to increase the acidity.  Hoping that this might help minimize the drying out of the chicken.  As is, the sauce absorbed into the chicken, but I think the amount of sugar in the marmalade is what dried the dish out for me.

Delicious!  I did as others did and floured the chicken before placing in the slow cooker, to thicken the sauce.  I added veggies (brocoli, yams and peas) and a can of coconut milk about 1 hour before serving. It was especially good the next day.

Love this combination of marmalade and curry.  I have also used it with shrimp,  but peel them first or you loose all that  delicious flavour on the shells.

I did find this too sweet for my taste, but with the addition of a Tbsp of apple cider vinegar to offset the sweetness it was much better. Also increased the ginger to 1/2 tsp. Used 2 huge chicken breasts cut into strips, cooked on low for 4-1/2 hours. Served with rice and stir fry veggies, and there was lots of sauce to cover all.

Tried it with 6oz. of apricot jam instead of the marmalade and it was really tasty. Also used less of the spices but did add onion. Served over brown rice. Thicken sauce with a little corn starch before serving.

Good starting point for orange-flavored curry chicken.  As others have said, it is too sweet and needs more spice heat.  I like that it is low in fat.  I added steamed green beans to it just prior to serving with Balsamic rice and Nam bread.

I added in coconut milk towards the end like other reviewers suggested and that really seemed to make the dish.  I'm considering adding in some vegetables with it next time, but I'm not sure how that will mix with the other flavors.

My family really liked this.  My husband likes curry, and I appreciate it when it's subtle.  This satisfied us both.  I too added coconut milk, and will make this again because it's so easy.

This was FANTASTIC. I added half a can of coconut milk and used curry paste instead of powder, then served it on top of some basmati rice that I cooked with the remaining coconut milk & chicken broth I had left from cooking the chicken. It's got some great flavors, sweet & spicy with just a touch of heat. I'm adding this to my favorite slow cooker recipes!

This is pretty good, a little to orange peely for me though, I didn't get to try the can of coconut milk because I forgot to get it at the store, maybe that takes it away and evens out the flavors cuz the orange over peels over power it, i'll make again though cuz my sister and dad loved it. I probably will try halving the marmelade though

I love anything curry, but apparently not mixed with marmalade. Not sure if I did something wrong, but this really was not good. In fact, it was pretty funky tasting. Husband was not a fan either.

This one's a keeper.  I've made it twice now - once with just breasts and once with skinless leg thigh portions.  Both were good but the dark meat turns out moister.  I did follow one piece of advice offered by another reviewer and that was to dredge the chicken in flour before placing in the crock pot.  I think this helps to thicken the sauce a bit.  I also added some chopped onion and sliced red bell pepper to the dish.  We will no doubt be having this one again.

we too enjoyed this receipe very much.  i used 6 breasts, halved the cayenne and added the coconut milk.  the time was a factor for me, as 3 hrs was too little and 6-7 was too long, so i cooked it 2 hrs on high and the next 3 1/2 on low.  the chicken came out a little dry, but i think it cooked it a little too long. in the end, it was delicious and my wife and daughter & son IL raved about it.  if i had used the recommended amount of cayenne, it would have been too spicy even for me and i love spicy food.

Made it with 3 chicken breasts, cut up into bite-sized pieces. Adjusted seasonings to taste, but otherwise followed the (scaled) recipe. It was fantaculous! Enjoyed by all. Next time, for variety I'll try pork and a bit of coconut milk. By the way, I'm new to slow cooking, and really appreciate the Allrecipes.com resource, along with the contributions from readers. Thanks!

Nice dish! Included the Spicy Sweet Potato Fries as a side along with a salad. I got a little creative with some of the marmalade for my salad dressing and it was excellent. (Mixed 2 tablespoons of orange marmalade, 1 tablespoon of light mayo, splash of olive oil, 1/4 cup of fat free cream and a 1/2 teaspoon of papkrika).

Love an easy recipe like this.  Added chopped onion, celery and orange peppers to this, served over brown rice.  Would like to try again, with the coconut milk suggestion.

This turned out better than I thought.  I took the advice of some of the reviews and added some coconut milk  to the recipe  with about an hour left.  I used chili powder instead of cayenne.  I am very new to cooking and am slowly figuring things out.  Next time I make this I will add more curry and more chili powder and reduce the amount of coconut milk.  I used a whole can and I think that deadened the curry and chilly powder.  I could still tell it had curry and chili powder and there was a bit of heat but I would have liked a stronger curry flavor and a bit more heat.  Lesson learned and the taste was amazing.

I have made this dish over 20 times now and it is gobbled up every time. I have modified it slightly as per my family's taste. First, I have never added coconut milk, we can't have it here. Secondly, I have never used the suggested 12 oz. of marmalade, I use about 6-8 oz. , or 1/2 to 3/4 of a cup. I have always made this on the stove in a large covered frying pan. We love curry so about 2 tsp. goes into the pan. I place skinless, boneless chicken breast into the pan frozen and dump everything else on top. I chop 2 cloves of garlic and about 2 tsp. fresh ginger, with 1 med. onion and 1 sweet red pepper for colour. I let it sit on the stove about 2 hours before I turn the burner on.  Cooking medium heat until peppers and onions are soft. For the last 10 min. I combine 1 Tbsp. corn starch in 1/4 cup water and pouring it on top, increasing heat to get a slow boiled and see the sauce thicken.  I serve this over black beans and rice with a green vegetable.

Delicious!  Made an excellent one pot meal if you add extra cup of chicken broth  at the beginning and 2 cups of quinoa 30 mins before the end.   I also used chicken thigh instead of breast.  This will become a staple.

This was ok, I found the sauce too runny, I like thicker sauces for toppings and I assumed adding coconut milk would have given it more full flavour and texture but still fell flat.

I was really disappointed with this recipe. The chicken was dry and the flavor was odd. We love Indian food but my family hated this and most of it ended up in the garbage. I followed the recipe to the tee except added a can of cocunut milk at the end as others suggested.

Finally an "orange chicken " recipe that really tastes like orange! I was a bit flexible with the recipe as I cook for two. I will make it again with the addition of rice vinegar and soy sauce as well as 1/4 cup coconut milk. I did not add the chicken broth, so needed the extra salt and liquid. The orange sauce really stuck to the chicken breasts. Even though I seasoned as directed it did not taste Indian. However, we both liked it very much

This recipe was ok. A little bland. I doubled the curry and added half can of coconut milk. I also floured the chicken.  Still a little bland. I decreased the cayenne pepper some and still a good bite to it.

Pretty tasty. I increased the cayenne pepper by about 1/4 teaspoon and next time would probably decrease orange marmalade to 8-10 ounces. I also added onion and bell pepper at the beginning along with the chicken, and after 3 hours on high, I added broccoli, mushrooms, and a half can of coconut milk. Served over brown rice.

In the end I really enjoyed this recipe, but I did make  few changes to it - the cooking times and proportions were perfect, but I decided to add more stuff - green peppers, ginger and some coconut cream to make it a sweeter/spicy curry. Overall, curries should have some flexibility - add a little or a lot of many things to suit your moods and this recipe is perfect for that!

ok. whenever I see such a well reviewed recipe that I think is terrible I generally assume I screwed up  somewhere.  maybe that is the case here, but this turned out awful for me.  The chicken was barely edible.. very tough and dry, the sauce was unusable.  Perhaps all due to too high of temp on my slow cooker.  I cooked medium temp for about 4 hours.  What I did taste I did not like the orange flavor and thought it was too spicy and I generally like hot things. We did not end up eating it and I am trying to salvage the chicken tonight.  It is probably pointless as the chicken is flavorless on the interior (the outside was blackened with the sauce and had all the flavors) and too dry to really eat.  I won't be making this again.

Dredge the chicken and use the coconut milk as others have recommended.  Do not use rounded or generous scoops of spices or this recipe will quickly become out of whack and overly spicy.  (But then again, maybe you like a little extra spice.  I do not.)

I loved this recipe, i love orange flavor which this had the perfect amount of. I took the advice & added a can of coconut milk at the last hour or so of cooking, i also added a dash of ground ginger. Next time i will add more curry.

My 2 year old and I enjoyed this chicken, but my husband thought it was too sweet.  I even made sure to buy unsweetened marmalade.  If you don't have a sweet tooth, you might find this recipe too sweet.  Give it a try though it's easy and the chicken will be super tender and flavourful!

This was a really great recipe...the only proble I had with it was the sauce was too thin...and I didn't have time to thicken it when dinner was served.  But I had leftovers and I tweeked the recipe and it was really good.  I just pulled the chicken I had apart then thickened the sauce added a bit more curry and marmalade and simmered it for a few minutes and served it over brown rice, really good.

A definite recipe to repeat!  So simple, cheap, and DELICIOUS!  I wish the broth were thicker, but I served the chicken over rice and poured the broth over both, allowing the rice to soak it up.

I liked the flavor of this, but I found myself wishing the sauce was a little thicker.  I served it over brown rice and would have liked it more if it had clung some to the rice.  Nevertheless, it's a good dish, and easy to prepare.

The chicken was a little bland and I just felt like it needed a little something more. The sauce runny. It was ediable, but I probably will not make it again.

I liked this recipe, Im always looking for good slow cooker recipes (I put it on at night, wake up, its done and I pack it for lunch)...However, I had way too much sauce for the amount of chicken. I did not find it too sweet but I used "no sugar added" marmalade. I added cornstarch to thicken but still found it to be too much and too thin. Will probably make again, but with less liquid.

It was good, 2 out 3 kids ate it...but I changed the recipe a lot!! As others suggested I floured the chicken and as well as salt & pepper I seasoned the chicken with garlic powder, chopped up 1/2 of an onion, added 1/2 can of coconutmilk, teaspoon of sage and since the store had no curry powder I used about 2- 3T. of curry paste. I also cut the chicken into strips. At the end I had to add a T. of corn starch to make it less runny

Like others, I found the broth to be extremely thin.  I simply scooped out a cup and added some flour to make it more like a gravy for the chicken and rice.  Flavor-wise, it was delicious!
