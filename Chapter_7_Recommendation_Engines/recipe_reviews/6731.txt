A new favorite!!  So moist.  The chocolate layer is very rich and chocolatey and the zucchini layer is nice and spicy.  I love how moist it is without tasting like oil, like some zucchini breads do.  I forgot to swirl it but the 2 layers looks pretty too.  This is going into the family favorite folder right now!  Oh, for 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice use:  1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ginger, 1/8 tsp allspice and 1/8 tsp nutmeg.

This is a very good bread with an interesting look. We are trying to cut down on fat, so I used the equivalent amount of applesauce in place of the shortening and it turned out beautifully.  I didn't feel as guilty about the chocolate chips then!  I love the layered look.  I also sifted the cocoa powder in to the batter to avoid clumps.  This will be a repeat recipe in our house. Love this recipe and have shared it with family and friends. Thank you!!

This zucchini bread recipe is yummy and a keeper.  Although, next time i think i will use 2T. cocoa powder instead of 3T. because it is very chocolatey with the addition of chocolate chips.  I made one loaf of this recipe last night in addition to two loaves of my own recipe.  Everyone absolutely loved every last bit of them.  For a variation, try adding 1/2 c. shredded coconut plus 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. almond extract to the batter and you will be in for a delicious suprise.  I do this with my other recipes sometimes.

Very good recipe!  Instead of making the wave, I made it marbled.  Alternate droping the plain batter and the chocolate batter by the tablespoon full into the loaf pan.  This makes a beautiful marbled effect.

Absolutely delicious!  Baked this loaf twice.  The first time, the loaf burned on the outside before the center was cooked.  Discovered that my oven is about 50 degrees hotter than it says.  Second time I baked the loaf, it turned out perfectly, with the needed temp adjustments.  Took 1 hour and 20 minutes to bake.  I sent the good loaf with my boyfriend on a 4 day hunting trip with 3 other men.  I hear that it was gone in 10 minutes, once opened.  I really enjoyed the pumpkin pie spice in the recipe.  The men loved the chocolate chips.  I followed the recipe exactly.

I've made this several times now and it's always nice and moist.  I prefer to put the chocolate chips in the white side.  Since I never seem to have pumpkin pie spice, I use cinnamon or nutmeg.  Once I tried doubling the recipe.  It turned out, but doubling the sugar was a bad idea - it was way too sweet.

Wow! This was fantastic! I made a double batch, had a little batter left over and made six muffins....I barely let the muffins cool before I had to try one, they smelled soooo good! And the flavor didn't disappoint! This recipe is delicious! I did make a couple of changes for healthiness points: used applesauce instead of shortening, 100% white whole wheat flour (from trader joes), dark chocolate chocolate chips, and an extra cup of zucchini. I will definitely make this again! Thanks for the recipe!!!

What a delicious change from regular zucchini bread!  The two flavors (chocolate and zucchini) blend together so nicely...looks nice too...would make a great gift.  I liked this recipe so much I think I will do this with my favorite banana bread recipe and make chocolate - banana wave bread.

This is the best zucchini loaf ever. Everybody loved it. I had to make another one two days later. I loved the wave effect. I also made it all chocolate, just added more cocoa to the entire batter, then poured half the batter in the pan then added same amount of chocolate chips to remaining batter. Excellent either way.

A very delicious sweet treat! I found the chocolate batter to be difficult to spread evenly because it was so thick but the flavor after baked was very pleasing.

Was REALLY good! Eventhough I added a bit more salt on accident and no one even knew because of the choc.  The fact that you can have a vegt. and choc. is a great thing when it comes to a dessert!  I layered the two doughs and than just drew a butter knife through, back and forth 3x and the swirl efect I got was quick and easy and looked great when cut and served on a platter.  Thanks!  Would recommend this one for kids!  Just don't tell them what's in it!

Delicious!  This recipe works just fine if you use regular size chocolate chips instead of minis, as I did.

WOW! We call it "Zed Bread" and it has become a staple in our home. My nine year old requests it all the time. Pretty impressive from a kid who says that zucchini makes him gag.

Great recipe!  Only thing I did different was made more layers of batter before swirling.  What an awesome presentation it made on the platters for my customers!

I can't help myself to change recipes a bit. I always try to make them a little healthier - I never have everything on hand. I made a double batch and did 50/50 whole wheat and whole wheat white flour.  I used canola oil instead of the shortening and decreased the oil by about 25%. Only had about 1/2 cp. white sugar, so I topped off with lt. brown sugar and decreased by 25%. I used allspice and a walnut, almond, peacan blend.  My breads were crisp on the outside - moist on the inside at 54 minutes.  Absolutely delicious.   I marbled them in 2 different ways, but I think layers were the way to go. The chocolate dominates the bread with it marbled.  this is a keeper.

This is a wonderful bread and a different way to use up zucchini. I made one change to cut back on calories, and that was to use 1/3 c. cinnamon applesauce + 1 tbsp veg oil in place of shortening. I really didnt miss the shortening at all. This will be going into my regular zucchini bread rotation along with my moms recipe! Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely delicious. I didn't use quite as much chocolate chips and I subsituted pecans because I didn't have walnuts.  I thought it was very moist. Next time I might add both nuts just because I like more crunch.

Really, really good!  I leave out the nuts because of allergies, but it's still great.  I do line the bottom of the loaf pan with waxed paper because I had a problem getting it out of the pan intact the first time I made it.  Works great!

YUM. Gotta love using veggies to make something sweet and delicious! Being a dietitian, I can never leave a recipe alone...so here are my modifications: canola oil for shortening; decreased sugar to 3/4 cup; used 1/2c AP flour, 1/2+1/3c WW flour, and 1/3c oats; for spices used 3/4t cinnamon, 1/8t cloves and 1/8t nutmeg; mixed pecans and walnuts together and toasted them; and finally...flax paste for eggs (for EACH egg, mix 1T ground flaxseed plur 3T water in a saucepan and boil until gooey, eggy consistency...then mix into batter like you would the eggs).  Just need a little extra baking powder (heaping spoon). Turned out great!!

I'm gonna give this five stars even though I changed the recipe and it came out less than ideal. That was my own fault. This bread is REALLY YUMMY! Mine ended up very dense and sticky and did not rise much, but that was my fault. I used half whole wheat, half white flour, reduced the sugar a bit, used cinnamon applesauce instead of shortening, and flax eggs (I'm not vegan, I just didn't have any eggs, lol!) I also didn't have any chocolate chips, and I didn't feel like putting nuts in it because I wanted to take some to work and didn't know if people had allergies or maybe just didn't like nuts. I shredded one HUGE zucchini and had enough to double the recipe!! I should have let my flax eggs set up a little longer, and maybe used more baking powder. I also forgot to add the water! But it still was delicious. I also did not pour the batter in layers, I hap-hazardly alternated "bloppy" spoonfuls of each type in the pans til they were full. Anyway, I really don't think you can fail with this recipe. Your results might not be as perfect as the pictures, but how could this NOT be yummy, ya know? Try it!

Delicious! I love zucchini bread but was unsure about the addition of the cocoa but I'm glad I tried it it was to die for and my very picky 9 year old loved it! Will definitely be making it again, soon!

Doesn't need shortening - replace w/ applesauce, you won't notice the difference.  I followed the recipe for all other ingredients and only thing i would change is maybe reduce sugar by 1/3 cup and replace w/ 1/3 cup shredded coconut.  Comes out very sweet and moist, a delicious bread!

I'm always looking for new zucchini recipes! I liked this one because it's a little different with the chocolate marble effect. Only made a few small changes: butter instead of shortening, no nuts, reduced sugar to 1 c., 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice & substituted some whole wheat flour for the 2/3cup of all purpose. Mine was done in 50min.

Living in a remote part of Costa Rica I did not have pumpkin spice and was not able to find it, but had 5 Chinese spices on hand. This was absolutely delicious and I can not wait to share it with my friends and neighbors.

This was the best Chocolate Zucchini bread Ive had, moist and flavorful! I doubled everything in the recipe except I held back 1/3 cup sugar and didnt double the cocoa or add walnuts as we have a nut allergy in the home. 
Awesome and does store well in the fridge!

Hands down the BEST FREAKING Zucchini Bread EVER!  The only change I made was replacing the 1/3 cup of shortening with a 1/3 cup of apple sauce.  Oh, I added white chocolate chips to the chocolate layer  :O)  Drop everything and bake this bread now!

I followed one reviewer's advice and left out a small portion of the sugar. I won't do that again. I would consider doing as another reviewer said and just adding the cocoa to the entire batch. The amount of cocoa mentioned is plenty, almost too much for just one half of the bread.

I've made this twice and it was devoured each time by kids -- they have no idea they're eating zucchini!  I made it a little healthier by using egg substitute and Promise (butter substitute) for the shortening.  I did not add the walnuts for allergy reasons.  Highly recommend this recipe!

I baked these into 5 small/mini bundt cakes.  The flavor was pretty good, but nothing outstanding for a zuccchini bread.  I tried to layer the cake like is said, but found the chocolate layer ended up being heavier and started to sink down into the original batter.  I have had better chocolate zucchini recipes before, but this one is alright.

Love this recipe.  The flavor combination is awesome.  The only change that I make is reducing the butter and using applesauce instead (probably 1/4 cup each).  I bake these in mini-loaf pans so they are done quicker and bake more evenly.  I love when I have a bunch of leftover zucchini because there are so many different kinds of breads to make with it.

Would definitely make again.  Used butter instead of shortening, added 1/3 cup wheat germ. About 1/4 cup more zucchini too, packed down. Looks soo strange when its mixed up b4 U add the dry ingredients. Turned out just fine and cooked in 1hr. GREAT with chocolate nutella spread on it! Didnt have any choc chips to add tho.. so the thinly spread nutella adds YUM! SOO pretty! TIP: Dump out half of the batter into the pan and use the same bowl to mix in the cocoa! Save yourself a dish! :)

Really flavorful and soft! I added about 1/4- 1/3 cup extra zucchini. Also, I didn't have mini chocolate chips so I processed normal sized ones in my food processor. Worked out well!

Very good.  Pressed out as much water from the zucchini as I could, and it was quite a bit.  Not sure I would have needed to do this plus add the additional water the recipe called for.  So-so on the pumpkin pie spice.

I give this 4.5 stars. It has great taste and moistness.  Next time I would put parchment paper on the bottom of my loaf pans though as someone else sugessted-I did put quite a bit of shortening on the bottom, but it still got a little hard and almost rubbery. As long as you cut that off the rest is wonderful. Also I doubled the recipe and used 1/2 white sugar an 1/2 brown, used 1/2 applesauce 1/2 shortening for the fat content and because my EXTRA large zuccini had alot of juice in it I did not have to use the water at all so I would suggest watching that-if I had added the water it would have been way too watery a batter.    Thank you Lisa for the recipe, it is one my whole family said to keep and remake.

We love this recipe.  I substitute the oil with applesauce, to make it a little healthier. I double the chocolate and make it all chocolate, it's better than brownies.

Easy, great recipe.  I substituted sweetened applesauce equivalent and decreased the sugar to 1 cup.  Bakes very nicely, moist and fun for the kids to spot the "wave".

I love this recipe! I have made it the traditional way twice, with gluten free flour once and as muffins once all in the last two months because I have had a lot of zucchini. I prefer to put chocolate chips in both the chocolate and normal mixture. these are beautiful and delicious however you make them.

This recipe was awesome. I served it with a bowl of chocolate frosting to be applied as wanted.  It was a total smash hit.  That is saying something, as this was in a place where the fresh zucchini is abundant and there are "lots" of excellent recipes around.  Yum yum!

This was my most favorite recipe all summer. I had a wonderful batch of zucchini this year and made this over and over. It went to every summer party and was eaten very quickly. The kids loved it at camping. It was such a rich treat for everyone.

Used butter instead of shortening b/c I had it on hand, added coconut as per another reviewer and instead of pumpkin spice added cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg & ginger. It baked 1hour and 15min in my oven but is so moist and delicious that I will make again forsure! If someone isn't a fan of zucchini they would never be able to tell that this bread has it in it!

It was good. Mine turned out kinda mushy. Zucchini was really "wet" so maybe I should have omitted the water. I use cinnamon because I lacked pumpkin spice. At any rate it was eaten up fast by family. I most certainly make again.

I made SIX loaves of this. I made the recipe AS is with only two slight changes...I added about a half cup more of zucchinni because I didnt want to waste it and I addes some brown sugar. This recipe is fabulous! It "Waved" perfectly. I gave away loaves to family and friends and ALL of them said they loved it and asked for more!! I froze some as well and used it a few weeks later and it was just as good...I am making another batch this weekend. DELIGHTFUL recipe...You would be hard pressed to even know there was a vegetable in this bread!

very moist and good! I used whole wheat flour to make it healthier. Also, I substituted nutmeg for pumpkin spice and margarine for shortening because that's what I had on hand! it still turned out well!

This bread was amazing! Non veggie lovers will be surprised to find that you have snuck a veggie into their diet. I stuck to the recipe exactly but next time I may just mix it all and just make it chocolate zucchini bread. Thank you for sharing this amazing recipe.

This is good.  I didn't have any pumpkin pie spice so I used cinnamon.  I only used a small handful of chocolate chips.

AMAZING! So moist and delicious. I've made this a couple of times, most recently for my students at school and they all loved it. The only thing I changed was to leave out the walnuts as we have a nut-free policy at our school due to allergies. Definitely a favourite!

I really wish I could give this recipe 4.5 stars. I used applesauce and fat-free sour cream in place of the shortening to cut out some of the fat, and I substiuted some of the sugar with honey, but I forgot to put a little (more) baking soda in it to neutralize the bitterness, so the bread had a bit of a funny aftertaste. But it was still delicious. I didn't halve the batter accurately, so I ended up with more chocolate dough than regular dough. I layered the two mixtured, which was quite attractive in the final presentation. I'll definitely be making this again.

Love this recipe! I just emailed to the few people who I shared it with.
I also added a bit more baking powder and soda. I also saved a step and put bottom half of the batter into the pans, and then added the cocoa and chocolate chips. This saved washing another mixing bowl.

The first loaf I made was gone in less than 24 hours - very yummy!  It took 1 hour 10 minutes in my oven.  Do the toothpick test like in the recipe, to be sure it's done.  A very moist and delicious bread - almost like a cake.

Was a good alternative to traditional zucchini bread. I will try again with 1/2 the chocolate and coco powder mixed in only a 1/4 of the batter. It was almost too sweet.

We loved this!  A good way to get extra veggies in my family!  My husband said yuck when I told him I had made chocolate zucchini bread but I made him try it and he loved it.  He told me to put extra slices in his lunch for the next day so he could let some other people try it!  Too funny!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Really yummy bread, but mine stuck to the bottom of the pan.  I used nonstick spray.  Maybe next time I'll put parchment in the bottom or try the PAM-With-Flour stuff.  Otherwise an excellent zucchini bread and one I'll make again!

Very good. I followed the recipe exactly except for the nuts. It turned out very moist and tasty. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I think next time I would want more of a chocolaty taste and would make the whole thing chocolate. Very easy recipe though, and a great way to use up summer zucchini.

Delicious, more like cake.  I made cupcakes with it, and I just mixed the chocolate in.  I also iced them with peanut butter frosting, and they were great.  I used oil instead of shortening.  I will try the applesauce suggestion to reduce the fat.  I also used whole wheat flour, and they turned out great.  An excellent way to sneak some nutrition into cupcakes.

This was so moist, and incredible tasting!  Even my husband (who said zucchini BREAD????!!!??) loved it!  I also put the chocolate chips in the white layer.  I think next time I make this I will try the chocolate layer on the bottom....

I did the recipe a little bit differently. I added 1/2 cup regular, sweetened applesauce instead of the shortening. I also added half white and half whole wheat flour. (I added more applesauce because of the whole wheat flour. I also added a little more water.)Then, I made them into muffins. I filled the muffin holders first with the regular batter and then with the chocolately batter. They take about 9-12 minutes, depending on how full you fill them. I ended up with 19 muffins.

This turned out really nice looking. It was very moist and I really liked the chocolate part. I did use butter instead of shortening because I don't like using shortening. I decreased the sugar to 1 cup and I was out of pumpkin pie spice so I used 3/4 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg. I also omitted the walnuts but added some chopped pecans to the plain half. I think next time I will leave out the nuts all together and forget about the spice, so it's more of a chocolate/vanilla type of thing. But I'm not huge spice lover so there you go. This is a very good zucchini bread though and I'll probably be using this recipe anytime I have some zucchini to use up! *UPDATE* Ok, I've been eating this all week at this is a seroiusly good zucchini bread! I really like it! Now I think the spice is fine, but I will still leave out the nuts.

My first experience with zucchini in baked goods and it was delicious with a great moist texture.  I decided to put the chocolate chips into the lighter bottom half of the loaf so that I could have chocolate in every bite - but beware to let the loaf cool completely before turning it out because the melted chocolate chips made the bottom split. (still tastes good, though).  I made two loaves - one regular and one vegan. I only changed the second by replacing the eggs with 1/4 cup oil and 1/3 cup cooked tapioca, and I got some vegan chocolate chips.  This didn't yield as fluffy a loaf, but I liked the denser one just as much.

This zucchini bread is awesome! My husband and my son loved it and so did everyone else. Instead of doing the wave effect, I alternated the chocolate batter with the plain batter and made a nice-looking marbel effect. It looked great and tasted even better.

This is nice.  I followed the recipe.  I put the chocolate chips in the white batter and swirled the two batters together alittle with a knife. A very nice presentation when sliced.  Update: This time it really stuck to the pan!  I didn't swirl it either as before, just topped the white with the chocolate.  It's so good and moist.  THX

We liked this bread since it works as a snack bread or even dessert.  I'm with the other reviewers, the chocolate wave effort wasn't worth the trouble.  Next time I'll lump it all together.

This bread was so very dense, fudgy and sweet that I almost can't call it bread. But I will call it yummy!! Very very good recipe. My kids and husband ate this bread and had no clue they were eating zucchini. I shared it with some family and friends and all raved about it. I would highly recommend this recipe.

I used butter instead of shortening, regular size chocolate chips instead of mini chips and did not add the nuts. I put the chips into the white batter and then used an ice cream scoop to alternately plop the chocolate and white batter into the loaf pan (almost like a checkerboard pattern.) It turned out beautifully and was very good. Thanks for the great recipe - will definitely make again.

This was very easy to make and the flavor is really good!  I did use shortening to grease the pan and it stuck on the bottom.  I tried to cut it for presentation and it kind of fell apart a little.  Maybe I will add just a bit more flour next time.  But I WILL make it again.

I would almost give this a 5 but it was my first time making zucchini bread so I have to leave the field open.

I thought this recipe was outstanding.  I altered it to make it gluten free by changing the wheat flour to brown and white rice four and adding xantham gum.  Everything esle was the same, and I made muffins.  It is the most flavorful and moist zucchini bread I have ever had!

This is a delicous bread and you can expect compliments and requests for the recipe!  I've made it with and without nuts - yummy both ways.  It keeps moist for days and freezes well too!  One more way to get the little people to eat zucchini  :)

I've made this twice now, and wouldn't change a thing (other than leaving out the nuts, since I'm not a fan). Whoever said it was too much chocolate was crazy!

Yummy! Some of it stuck in the pan, but that's all my fault. Next time I'll make sure I do a better job greasing the pan!

This was good, had good flavor, but my husband kept saying the chocolate layer was too dry, said the texture was too much like cocoa powder.  Maybe I didn't split the batter evenly?  It was good and I might make this again, but I'll probably continue looking for another recipe.

I don't know what happened. It probably had a lot to do with using applesauce and Splenda - I don't usually have much luck in decreasing the fat content with these two ingredients.  I know one thing... I used the last of the Splenda and I'll never buy it again.  So unfortunate, as this looked so nice and sounded so yummy.  I also didn't like the chocolate chips in the chocolate batter, for some reason.

This was just mediocre. I added more cocoa than what was called for and it still wasn't really chocolatey. Maybe the flavor would have been improved if butter was used instead of shortening? This gave me 12 muffins and a small loaf of bread.

Delicious!  I made this for a potluck brunch and it was a hit - even the kids liked it.  Another way to get them to eat some veggies!  Looks just like the picture - tastes yummy and will take care of a chocolate craving if it hits you!  Perfect as is - I might try a full 2 cups of zucchini next time. Thanks a bunch for the recipe!

I for one loved the "wave" part of the recipe and didn't feel it was too much extra work.  I layered the two different batters diagonally from one corner to the other and rotating corners with each flavor.  After slicing, I truly saw a "wave" throughout the bread.  My family loved the bread and the pumpkin pie spice was a really nice compliment to the chocolate.  I will definately make this recipe again!

Great recipe. My son's on chemo & its a struggle to find foods that he will eat. He's had 3 pieces today alone! Made a few minor changes: used cinnamon instead of pumpkin, replaced 2/3 white sugar w/ brown, replaced tsp. vanilla w/ 2 tsp. brandy & used lowfat milk instead of water. Thanks!

I thought this was a great zucchini recipe, but I did make a few adjustments. I couldn't find our loaf pan so I used a square 8 x 8 in pan and cooked it for only 1/2 an hour. Also, I used 1/2 the sugar it said to use and the rest I substituted with splenda. It came out moist and full of flavor. I might recomend using more chocolate chips though.

Deee-licious. I only used 1 cup sugar and it was plenty sweet. I don't have pumpkin pie spice, so used cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and ginger instead.  I am ready to make this again tomorrow when the first one is gone! I will use more zucchini (therefore reduce water) next time.

I made this all-chocolate instead of layered by doubling the cocoa powder.  Also, I used grated apple instead of zucchini - it turned out great, and I think you could substitute just about any fruit or vegetable, such as pear, carrot, or whatever.

This is a very good recipe. I decreased sugar to 1/2 cup and was still delicious. I didn't do the marble effect correct, it came out like a chocolate cake, but that is my fault.  Will definitely make again

It came out perfectly. I doubled the batch and cut out 1/3 of the sugar. It looks and tastes amazing. My house smells wonderful.

The second time I made it  I reduced the cocoa to 2 Tablespoons as we thought it was a little too chocolaty (and I'm a chocolate freek!)  The family ate 3/4 of the loaf in one day!

I didn't use the pumpkin pie spice at all.  It allowed the non-chocolate layer to have a nice nutty flavor from the walnuts to balance the chocolate layer.  I used dark chocolate coco powder so the chocolate layer was not as sweet.

I make this without separating ingredients, so it's all in one, and usually leave out the chocolate chips, it's great either way.

This was my first time making zucchini bread;  I found this recipe easy to follow and the result  AWESOME! In fact, I made 4 loaves in three days! I was concerned at first about using shortening because I almost always bake with butter, however this bread is so moist and not greasy or oily. The only thing I did differently was I used black walnuts. Black walnuts have such an intense flavor and coupled with the chocolate, the bread was simply decadent. My husband has brought me more zucchini in from his garden - I'll be making more for sure!

Imagine if gingerbread and brownies had a baby and here we are! I brought this to work for a treat, and everyone raved about it! So moist and delicious, and simple to prepare. I was skeptical about pumpkin pie spice with chocolate, but it works. Will definitely be making this all through zucchini season.

Excellent zucchini bread. The bread is nice and moist, and soo chocolatey. Definitely will be making again in the future! We cut the amount of sugar to 1 cup, and might even cut it some more - 1 and 1/3 cup of sugar in that tiny loaf is just too much! We also used unsweetened apple sauce in place of shortening to make it healthier. Delicious!

This recipe is amazing and everyone loved it! The chocolate and the pumpkin spices make it so tasty. Teenage kids said it was "bomb" and very good!  I will definitely be using this recipe every summer  when I have so much extra zucchini from my garden.  Put some loaves in the freezer for later! 
 I doubled the recipe, used 5 Reynolds new parchment lined 5 3/4 X 3 1/4 foil pans and baked for 45 minutes.  Convenient and easy to give out to all my family, friends and neighbors.  
Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe!

This was the first time we tried zucchini bread.  It turned out very nicely.  It was moist and tasty.  We really liked the pumpkin pie spice.  I was not sure about how wet the zucchini was after shredding.  The directions did not mention it, but I wondered if I was supposed to dry it out somehow.  It was delicious but perhaps it would have been better if I had dealt with the moisture.  Thanks for the recipe, it was fun!

Really wonderful!
The texture is fabulous, flavor right on point, and the look is so unique and beautiful. I made a few changes based on ingredient availability at my home.
1. I didn't have all purpose flour, so I used white cake flour
2. I cut the sugar down, only adding one cup (I find quick breads to have too much unnecessary sugar)
3. instead of two eggs, I used one egg and one flaxseed egg(1TBS of ground flax seed, 2 TBS water) Good VEGAN substitute.
4. I omitted the nuts, and the chocolate chips. I'm just not a fan of either.
They came out absolutely perfect. My family went crazy for them. I  will be making again and again!
My pics are the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th pictures as of now.  wanted to give everyone a look at the bread sliced, unsliced,  and a close- up on texture. LOVED!

Very moist and chocolatey loaf. Made as directed with great results. I substituted shortening for canola oil as that was on hand. Also used just cinnamon. Omitted the nuts, only because I had none on hand, they would be great added next time!

The cake is easy to bake and so moist.  The next time I bake it again I wouldn't devide the batter in half again instead, I will mix it all in the chocolate powder.  My boys love it so much and can't wait to eat it as soon as it was done baking.

Great recipe! Very moist and great if you like the cinnamon and chocolate flavor combination. Every one loved it!  I made ganache and poured over the top.

Loved it !  I added a crumb topping because my family loves everything with a crumb topping.  I added 1/2 the amount of pumpkin spice and it was wonderful.

I loved it.  I didn't have shortening, so I used butter, and cut the salt amount in half.  It came out perfect and DELICIOUS.

This recipe is FANTASTIC!!! The only substitution I made was using raw pumpkin seeds instead of walnuts, only because that's the only nut I had. Hahaha! I will definitely make this again!

It was very tasty, and very moist. 

On instinct, I did not add the pumpkin spice, as this combination does not work for me.  It turned out fabulous: golden layer, with creamy chocolate layer going throughout. 

Comes together incredibly fast, and is a great, easy treat to whip up if you know company is coming. 

This is a keeper.

Family loves this! I had way too much zucchini so I made up several batches and froze the batter, a bag of plain and a bag of chocolate. Just let it thaw and bake once the batter is room temp.  Skipped the nuts, chips, and water.

Very good! This is a good hearty bread, made it just as it says and came out amazing.  I cooled it overnight in the fridge and my 3 kids and I had it for breakfast.  The kids all gave it a thumbs up and said it was awesome.  Definitely making it again.

great recipe!! Awesome, I added cinnamon in place of pumpkin spice and it was still divine.  Read an article about drying the zucchini first, maybe next time.

I've only ever made muffins from this recipe, but I'm sure the bread is just as good.  An even better twist was to make the whole recipe in chocolate (don't split the batter & double the amount of chocolate, etc.) - YUM!

I love Zucchini bread and I love chocolate, but I didn't think the two complimented each other very well. I'm always trying new recipes but no one in my family cared for this one.

This bread tasted fine but it didn't look very nice at all.  The chocolate layer sank into the plain layer and pushed it out of the pan all over my oven.  I'm not sure exactly what happened.

This is delicious!!  Next time, I'll just add an extra tablespoon or two to the whole thing, and forget able the layered effect, which didn't work too well for me.  And I know there'll be a next time!

This recipe was great!  I tried it without swirling the two batters, but I think it would be really neat that way.  The chocolate chips made it even more wonderful!
