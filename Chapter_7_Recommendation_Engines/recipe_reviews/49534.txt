This recipe was pretty good...even my son liked it!

I did make a few adjustments: I only used 1/2 a red onion and that was plenty. I added a can of black beans. The sauce seemed a little bland, so I added more hot sauce, a splash of cider vinegar, a dash of taco seasoning (I already had it out for another recipe) and some cumin.

It was a hit! :)


A tip for de kerneling the cob: use a large bowl and a small bowl. Turn the small bowl upside down and put it inside the large bowl. Stand the ear of corn up on the upside down bowl and run your knife down along the edge of the cob. All of the kernels will fall into the bigger bowl, instead of all over your counter. :)

This recipe was delicious and so easy!  The only change I made was to use frozen corn instead of fresh, and I grilled it on my George Foreman grill.  Turned out fantastic with much less work :)  The cilantro dressing is amazing.

This was a GREAT recipe!  I'm not big on green peppers - so I added chopped tomato and avocado.  I served it as a salsa with homemade tortilla chips.  You could add just about any vegetable that you like.  Everyone loved it!  I will make this again and again.

I made this exactly as the recipe suggests and found it a bit bland. I added about 3/4 ts of cumin and used about 1 ts of sriracha hot chile sauce.

This recipe was time consuming and just plain in taste. I have other recipes with black beans and corn that require so little time and are big on taste. Save the time and expense of this one.

Great salad, the dressing is perfect. I used a bag of frozen corn that I thawed vs. fresh to save on time.  Other than that I didn't change a thing.

Very tangy - and colourful, too! I make this as a salad with a base of arugula and baby endive, using the bell peppers, onion, and corn as more of a garnish. Yellow bell pepper is a great addition, too.

Hubby made this last night.  He used canned corn but no other changes and it is delicious.  Very fresh and crunchy!  And colorful presentation.  Would love to try it with the roasted corn!

I gave it 5 stars because I could eat the whole bowl for dinner. My husband said it was better after it sat for an hour or so and I have to agree. I added an avacado and more hot sauce. Next time I'll add finely minced Jalapino. Pretty time consuming so I don't know how often I'll make it.

My husband LOVED this recipe.  I didn't care for it at all, but I don't like peppers or onion so go figure.  It was very potent, but he loved it!

Excellent recipe and a nice alternative to the usual summer salads.  I used frozen corn and sauteed in until some of the kernels started to turn brown to try and get a roasted look and taste.  I also left out the cilantro as my Mom does not like it.  It was a big hit at my party.

Excellent .....used sugar substitute instead of real sugar and reduced olive oil to 1/4c. So flavorful and fresh.  Fresh cilantro is key. A great summer salad. Also added some sliced yellow cherry tomatoes.  Family loved it!

This is a great corn salsa that I like to use on fish tacos. I adjust to my families personal likes. As written, it's a great baseline to go by!

This was great!  I was looking for something different and this hit the spot.  Also good with fresh parsley for those who don't like cilantro.

Great side dish.  Very flavorful and easy to prepare.  The more char you get on the corn, the better it will taste.

Tried this for dinner tonight as a side to bbq chicken and it complimented each other well! I did have to alter it a bit, though. I used canned corn & frozen bell pepper strips, which I tossed with some chopped white onion (didn't have red) & 1 tbsp olive oil. Baked it on a baking sheet for about 25 minutes. Cooled it & mixed with chopped cucumbers, a dash of red pepper flakes, & dressing from recipe (minus cilantro because of not having any) and chilled. It was still amazing! Corn salad with a bit of an extra kick! A new favorite! Thank you!

The salad is great for a summer BBQ, I added more garlic to the recipe and less onions than the recipe called for. I used the leftover portion in a green salad the next day..really added a lot of flavor!

I had a lot of family and friends over for a BBQ last Sunday.  A good share of them do not care for unusual tastes or anything new, but they all loved this one (except my mother-in-law).  Oh well, one our of fifteen is pretty good.  We loved it.  Will make it again.  Thanks Kim!

A great way to kick off summer! I left out green pepper and cilantro because I am not a fan of either. I added in half a jalapeno, and some cumin, chili powder and red wine vinegar for more flavour. A great idea for picnics and bbq's. You can add black beans, you can fresh lettuce and even shredded chicken. :) Thanks!

My daughter loves to cook so I had her make me a salad. She changed or added vegis to suit her, but used the dressing. Turns out, that is what is important. This was excellent.

This was very good. It started pouring rain as we got the grill going to I used steamed frozen instead of corn off of the cob. Next time I think I will use  little more hot sauce. Wasn't a hit with the kids but the adults enjoyed it!

I really enjoyed this!  I used Trader Joe's roasted corn, a little jalapeno instead of the hot sauce.  My husband would like to try it with black beans next time and a dash of that vinegar suggestion.

Made this up last night as a side for our chicken enchiladas and it was a big hit with my husband.  We had some roasted corn left over from grilling last weekend, so I wanted to use it up and this was the perfect way.  I omitted the green bell pepper as all I had was a red one and it turned out just fine.  Allow it to sit in the referigerator for a while before serving so the flavors can meld together.  We grill our corn without the husks after soaking so they have a nice caramelization on some of the kernels.

Really so much better than I  thought it would be. Great dressing! I broiled my onion since I like carmelized onion.

Whoa, this is amazingly good! I switched it up a bit to suite my taste. I didn't use the red pepper but used diced tomato instead and also added a jalepeno and avocado. I used about 1/3 of a red onion. I also used 2 cans of corn instead, but it was still awesome! I didn't have hot sauce so I used a little bit of cayenne pepper.

Tastes great, made it 3 times now, and have been asked for the recipe at least once each time, 3 times yesterday. I use 10 ears of fresh corn, cut off the kernels and brown them just a touch in a little olive oil, then follow the recipe from there. Some may find it a little spicy and may want to cut the hot sauce a little, but try it as is first. I think the sauce helps bring out some of the other flavors.

This salad had a really great blend of flavors - very fresh and yummy.  I made the mistake of serving it just a few hours after putting the dressing on.  It was very limey and although good not quite perfect.  However, after letting it set overnight it was absolutely fabulous.  The lime flavor mellowed and was really, really good.  I would make this one day before serving when I make it again.

Such a fresh flavor!  I love the cilantro lime dressing.  I cheated and used frozen corn (not quite sweet corn season yet).  I just cooked the corn in a little water, let it cool, then tossed with the other ingredients.  It's best if you make ahead of time to let the flavors meld together.

I often make a salad like this in the summer.  Especially when there's left over grilled corn.    Omit the sugar if using sweet corn and it's fresh.  Sometimes we add a can of cumin flavored black beans too.  But this salad is GREAT as it is (minus sugar.)  Great, fresh flavor.  We give it  five stars.

I halved this recipe.  Too much lime and too much
garlic.  Otherwise I thought it was terrific.  I 
love roasted corn recipes.

This was awesome!  I tried it tonight with a Mexican dinner w/ chix burritos, refried beans and Mexican rice.  This salad was a hit all around!!  I did change it by using 1/2 of the oil it called for and it was still delicious.  Also, the recipe isn't clear about after you soak it and remove the silk part, then wrap it back up in the husks(I had never grilled corn before).  I will definitely make this again, and it is perfect for a Mexican theme, or as it states, for a summer bbq.  Try it!

Great salad!  Made it numerous times for personal use and for many guests..  The favorite of my wife.  I would maybe (if you like your salad a bit "hotter") replace the hot sauce with a jalapeno or two depending on your taste.

Delish!!  I will be making this as it is a great summer dish! Not being a fan of green peppers, the second time I made it I cut back on the green peppers, added black beans and avocado.  I also love cilantro, so I kicked that up and added more.

I didn't enjoy this as it's written.  I tried doctoring the dressing to take away the blandness and it became just okay.  Won't make it again.  There are other recipes I'd rather try.

We ate this recipe every day for a week and I was sad to see the end of it. Don't try and use frozen or canned corn- it's totally worth cooking it on the grill.

Wonderful taste - and wonderfully versatile. Added rinsed can of black beans, little bit of broccoli, little bit of carrot, and a little extra sugar as my juiced limes were a little overpowering.

I used canned corn (Trader Joes) as a shortcut and it tasted great!  Roasted corn is probably better, but I can't resist such a timesaving substitution.  I also like it spicy so I added additonal hot sauce.  I'll add diced jalapeno's next time for a fresh, crunchy kick. Recommend reducing the olive oil just a bit. Will definitely make again for my next BBQ.

This is worth a try! I had some limes and cilantro to use up and came accross this recipe. I served it as a side with steak (not really mexican but they worked VERY well together). I sauteed all of the vegies together so they were cooked then added the sauce to it. For the hot sauce, I used some stuff we got on a vacation in St. Lucia and it is VERY HOT! 1 tblsp made this a very hot dish! The sauce has a sweet, hot mustard taste and complimented this dish well.

Fantastic.  I also added grape tomatoes, and in the future I will add bacon.  It would be great served warm if all of the vegetables were roasted in the oven for 15 or 20 min prior to serving.

The crunch of those peppers sent chills down my spine. The only bad thing about this salad was that it made all of the colours of the world seem less bright in comparison to it's natural glow. The corn...oh the corn. Before this salad, I saw corn as just another food. Now, I see it as a vessel to my eternal happiness. Eat this southwestern roasted corn salad of wonder, and I can guarantee it will change your life.

Tried this for the first time for a group of 12 -- teenagers and adults all loved it!  Great flavor!!  We ate it as a side salad with our bbq, and then ate the leftovers the next day as dip with tortilla chips.  Will definitely become a staple for the rest of the summer.

I loved this salad as it had such a fresh and summery taste to it!  Perfect for summer BBQ's :)  The whole red onion was a bit overbearing for my kids, so I would suggest if you are serving it to children or a crowd, to only use half an onion.  I am thinking about adding some black or pinto beans, extra lime and some jalapeno next time and making it a corn salsa, served with chips! YUM!

Did not have cob corn so we used frozen and it was just delicious.  Also had to leave out the red onion due to family allergies. The dressing is wonderful and flavors are so fresh.

This is delicious.  I eyeballed everything, and used Frozen Corn because College Living doesn't let me have a grill (or the time to grill and de-cob corn).  Quick, Easy, and Yummy.

Perhaps I added more cilantro than others, but the dressing really turned the salad a greenish color. Color aside, it tasted fabulous and everyone was asking for the recipe. I'll definitely make it again!

I wanted something different to take to our boat club picnic and this fit the bill.  I especially loved that it did not have mayo so I did not need to worry about the heat.  Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe!  Instead of fresh corn I used one bag of thawed Birds Eye frozen Baby White Corn.  It was fantastic!!!

I made this for a block party and it was gone fast!  I love the freshness of the veggies and cilantro.  I will definitely make this again.  I added fresh cut cherry tomatos and it was delicious!  My husband couldn't keep out of it long enough to get it to the party!

This is a great idea on how to use up leftover grilled/roasted corn.  However the flavors just don't blend well.  If I make this again, I will  measure the lime juice. I had three limes and the taste of lime was overpowering - also, too much cilantro - initially no one in my family liked this recipe.  It took a lot of adjusting to get the flavors to blend into a dressing that I could actually serve and not kill the taste of the roasted corn - if you're not a "foodie" then you could save a lot of time by using your favorite citrus dressing as a substitute for the homemade dressing.  My next go will be with a cream/mayo based dressing with a little smoke flavoring added to enhance the roasted corn.

This was an absolutely yummy recipe.  I didn't grill the corn because I had already removed the husks, so I boiled it and then fried it for a couple of minutes with a little butter.  I lucked out with some very fresh, sweet corn.  Loved the flavors - I might have added a little extra hot sauce ;)  I also found the cilantro was key (if you like cilantro).  Thanks for sharing - this will become a mainstay in our household in the summer!

Everyone who tries it asks for the recipe. I don't roast the corn, just boil it for 7 minutes. I also don't use a full cup of cilantro in the dressing as I find it too strong.

Loved this!  We used roasted corn from a previous dinner.  I added a can of black beans and chopped jalapeno.  Next time I'm throwing in diced avacado.  I think it'll go great with the dressing.

Made for dinner last night and everyone really enjoyed this. It did take time to grill corn, but using fresh sweet corn really makes this dish. I'm not sure it would have tasted the same if I had used frozen corn.

Just finished making and it is awesome!  I omited the green pepper and used spanish white onion instead of red.  I only had frozen corn so I cooked the corn, onion, and red pepper in a pan with some olive oil.  I also didn't have any cilantro so I used parsley and added a little cumin to the dressing.  Tastes wonderful, will definately use again.

Did as others suggested and used frozen corn to start, then roasted it.  Made no changes except to add a handful of feta cheese to the dressing as it spun in the blender, which made it creamy and a bit richer. Tangy and bright tasting the first day- a bit bland the second after refrigeration.

Took others' advice and added 1 tbsp apple vinegar, 1/2 tsp cumin, some extra hot sauce, and black beans (I used less corn).  Five stars with the additions; will definitely make again!

I have made this four times now in the last month.  First as written, and it was great.  Then incorporated variation of suggestions in comments.  This is a delicious  recipe on its own and a versatile base recipe for adapting to you and your families tastes. Regardless of the variations you make, be sure you make it a day ahead.  It is incredible the next day and for days after.  Using the recipe, comments and my personal tastes, I used 2 cans, drained, roasted whole kernel corn and 1 can drained and rinsed black beans, 1/2 each diced green and red bell peppers, 1/2 diced red onion, and 1 Tbs. diced jalapeno (the rest of the jalapeno I put in the dressing).  For the dressing...I follow the recipe then add 1 tsp. cumin, Sriracha hot sauce to our taste, the reserved jalapeno...as for cilantro, I have used fresh when I have it and the wonderful cilantro paste (Gourmet Garden ) I can find in my grocery stores.  My folks liked it when I added other additions (the next day) like crumbled Mexican cheese, diced avocado, and or quartered grape tomatoes.  Thank you Kim Fusich for posting this inspirational recipe. Your recipe inspired me to post my first review.

Great flavors and textures but unlike the photo the flavorful vinaigrette is solidly green making the appearance slightly less vibrant.

I've never had a corn salad so I was a little hesitant, but this was very good.  Raw garlic bothers my stomach, so I used garlic salt.  Consequently I was able to just mix the dressing in a small bowl.  This salad is summer in a bowl.

I made this recipe exactly as written, and it came out great. The salad was fresh-tasting  and colorful with a slight bite which worked beautifully with my BBQ summer cook-out.  Because the corn was cut off the cob it did not come out as "cleanly" as the picture shows, but small matter - it was delicious!

This salad is delicious. I grilled the corn with the husks off which added a great char taste to the sweet corn. For the sauce, I added several dashes of cumin which balanced out the acidity of the lime.

This is an amazing recipe. So easy. The flavour is refreshing. I used canned peaches and cream corn with a little more hot sauce. I love the lime citrus taste. Such a great summer salad.

I made this and it was a big hit. Loved the roasted corn and I felt like roasting it gave the corn a great flavor.  I don't care for cilantro so I substituted parsley. Only complaint I have is that I think the prep time is more than 20 minutes (or maybe I am just slow). With all of the chopping, soaking the corn, husking the corn - it took me more than 20 minutes to put this together.

Does take a bit of time but amazing flavor!

I used avocado oil and put the dressing in the Vitamix (whole cilantro stocks and all) - came out creamy and delicious!  this is a great summer recipe that you can add any fresh veggies too.  Second time I made it I added fresh arugula leaves and red and orange bell peppers.  Highly recommend.  I have made this several more times since.  For those who don't like Cilantro  replace with fresh parsley it takes away some of the zing but I have found many people have a cilantro aversion. ;)

Delish!  Hubby loved it and he usually finds corn boring.  I used frozen corn because it's  what I had on hand.  Probably a lot better with grilled corn.  I'll try that next time.  The cilantro dressing that goes on it is awesome and could be used for other dishes as well.

Wonderful recipe. I didn't add any hot sauce because I don't really care for spicy. I also used a bag of frozen roasted corn from Trader Joe's. I added more cilantro because I had tons left. My family loves it, especially my 16-year-old daughter. Thanks, Kim :-)

I made this for a party and had LOTS of fresh corn. It was so popular, people were eating just the sauce and trying to figure out what it was once the corn mixture was gone. I added black beans and salt and pepper and hot sauce to taste. Also used orange pepper, poblano pepper (this is what I had). I'll definitely make again!
