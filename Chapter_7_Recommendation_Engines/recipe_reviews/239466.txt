Delicious. And very easy to make, just takes a bit of time to cook. I made a few changes.... Being a vegan I swapped the stock to low sodium vegetable stock, and when there was about 20 minutes left to go I added some frozen peas and frozen spinach because I'm always looking to add more veggies in a dish. Also I covered it so the beans would cook better. I will definitely make it again.

Cooking time inadequate. Should have been covered while cooking. Came out so so.
