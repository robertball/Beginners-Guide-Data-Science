This was delicious, though I left out the pickle relish because I don't like it and replaced the mayo with olive oil.  Next time I make it, I'll use salmon in only  half the filling.  I think the plain filling with a smoked mussel on top would be delicious for the other half.  Non-seafood eaters could pick off the mussel.

I liked this recipe,but I must say if you dont let people know that there not regular deviled eggs you will be in big trouble. One person gagged and another person hated seafood.They just didnt expect the salmon.Just lable the tray before setting it out before consumption.

These are absolutely delicious. Since only my two-year-old and I eat fish, I halved this recipe (the kitties didn't mind!). I had a bit of extra filling, which I put on  a slice of bread with some lettuce -- You could totally just dice up the eggs and have a delectably different salad. I did skip the relish as well as one other reviewer. I just didn't have any, but I don't feel that it's necessary. Amazing without!

I made this for a party and it got rave reviews. One of my eggs had a double yolk so it was cool to have for everyone to see.

Wonderful twist to the traditional deviled egg. My husband and I really enjoyed the flavor of the smoked paparika. This would be a great appetizer to serve for dinner guests.
