Mike and Jill did a great job on this one.  Pretty close to my version:  2 oz. vodka, 1 oz. Rose's Lime Juice, 1 oz. Cointreau (instead of Triple Sec, more expensive, but much smoother), and the juice from 1/2 a lime.  Definitely shaken and strained though.  An interesting variant is to replace the Cointreau/Triple Sec with Blue Curacao for an electric blue looking drink that tastes nearly the same.  A classic cocktail with a bad reputation (identical recipe to a classic Margarita with vodka instead of tequila).  Don't let sour mix get anywhere near this one!

It's kind of girly, but easy to handle as a shot.

This is a very pleasing and delightful drink.  My girlfriend loves this drink the most.  But most of all it's not one that requires a lot of practice.

Solid four stars with Spunky Buddy's variation of an old classic from the '70s. I remember this as being a somewhat vicious bar drink served as a shot from many years ago.  I substituted Keke Key Lime Liqueur for the bottled lime juice and kept all else the same...except for pouring it into a decidedly classier mini martini glass.  The key lime liqueur made it creamier while not compromising the boldness of the fresh lime juice.

I tried my first Kamikaze at my reception and it has now replaced the margarita as my favorite drink.  This recipe is excellent.  It normally takes 3 margaritas to do what one of these does.  Thanks so much!

This is great! We just made these tonight (in January!) but I think they would be very refreshing in the summer heat!

I rimmed a martini glass w/ raw sugar (if you haven't tried it...do so...great flavor & even better visual appeal), poured it in & garnished w/ a slice of lime. It's very good but it REALLY packs a punch.

I only used 1.5 oz vodka and 1.5 oz triple sec but it was still great!!! I'll definitely make this one again!  Possibly my new favorite! :)
