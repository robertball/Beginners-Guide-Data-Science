A lot of people are having trouble with candy recipes.I discovered a few years ago that candy recipes involving a thermometer do not work unless you use PURE CANE SUGAR.If you read the labels on most store brands they list "other sugars", this is sugar beet sugar. It is chemically different from cane sugar and has different boiling points.( remember chemistry class?) The different stages of candy making soft ball, hard crack ,etc. were created for cane sugar.Beet sugar had not been discovered yet.

I made this with flavor extract and food coloring instead of the drink mix. If you choose to do that, cook it until 256 degrees so it won't be too soft. Also, I found that it helps to wait until the taffy's pretty cool to try stretching it. I made peppermint, banana, maple, and coconut--all wonderful! My husband said the banana was just like laffy taffy.

I used this recipe however I had absolutly no koolaid or soft drink flavoring, but I did have jello.  My first batch I used 1 sm. box of peach jello powder it was about 1/2c. I reduced the sugar by that amount.  It came out perfect but little flavor.  The second batch I used 2 boxes of Apricot jello, and also reduced the sugar by that amount.  It was absolutly wonderful.  There are so many different flavors for jello, you really must try it.

I think there are two keys to this recipe.  Temperature and stretching.  Candy takes patience.  I let it reach 255 degrees before removing from heat.  I didn't want it too soft or to hard.  I used two large buttered metal cookie sheets.  Split the mixture between the two.  I waited only until the candy was cool enough to touch (maybe 5 minutes) then i started stretching.  I made cherry and the candy went from a dark red to a light pink by the time I was done stretching.  I don't think it would have turned out nearly as good had I not stretched it so much.  Also, make sure you have two people to stretch.  By the time I got to the second pan it was already setting up.  It still worked but was much harder on my arms!  I may add two kool aid packets next time.  My husband loves it.  Also, I did NOT butter my hands before stretching.  There was no need.  It only stuck to itself.  There was enough butter from the pan, I guess.  I didn't want the candy to be butter flavored or coated in butter.

AMAZING! Great recipe and definately fun to make. When pulling it and making the pieces, you will probably need more than two people. My husband had to run next door to grab the neighbors to help. Wonderful smooth texture, just like salt water taffy.

This was nothing like taffy!  After following steps 1-2, I buttered a baking sheet and poured the liquid taffy onto it, let it sit for about half an hour and finally it turned as solid as rock!  I am SO glad it didn't ruin my baking sheet.  It didn't even have a good favor!  I hope it works next time I try it.

Now I know where the name laffy taffy came from! I had a hard time getting any of our burners to heat the mixture over 225 degrees so I had to partially cover the mixture. We took it out right when the thermometer hit 250 and added 2 packs of grape kool aid. We let it cool, and it was still very soft. My kids and I butter our hands and tried to "pull" the taffy, but it wasn't exactly what we had in mind. It was very sticky and even after 30 minutes of pulling it never really firmed up. 

We ended up having to put this on wax paper in big globs, and smash it down like laffy taffy.

We had a blast making this, and even though it was very messy and didn't turn out like we had hoped for, the flavor was good and it was a lot of fun to make with the kids.

Super easy and tasty.  My kids and I make this all the time.  A huge hit at birthday parties, I do the cooking in advance, then let the kids pull it after it cools.

AWESOME!!! I made two batches. The first one turned out a little hard, so I tried to figure out a way to make it a little softer. I used a little more corn syrup and and starch to try and soften it up. I also only streched until it turned white. Another hint for making it cool faster is sticking and buttered icepack on top and another on the bottom. Don't leave it on too long, or else the candy will harden and you can't strech it. Still makes a good hard candy too. (Picking it out of the pot, ;) )

I made this with my two children (ages 7 & 9) and it turned out great! We actually used 2 kool-aid packets instead of one and it had lots of flavor. I will definitely make this again.

I used a sugar free packet of cherry limeade mix, since i dont usually have koolaid in my cabinets, and the flavor was amazing.  it was a sticky mess for quite a while and the butter wasnt working on my hands very well, so i kept spraying my hands with a little water when the taffy became sticky and that worked well.  i pulled for a good 10-15 minutes until it became light in color, then i rolled it out and cut it with my kitchen shears.  my husband loved it, so i will definitely make this again.

Loved it!  I let the temp go to 260 degrees, just a little bit under the hardball stage (anything lower and it would have been to soft).  Used a metal cookie sheet with high sides.  My flavors: grape/lemonade koolaide, orange koolaide, and peppermint extract.  Very tasty!

Turned out great with cherry koolaid. Be sure to use a LOT of butter when pulling. I used half of the recipe and got 63 peices of taffy...:)

The texture and consistency of the taffy was great! However, we put half on a metal cookie sheet to cool and half in a glass 9x13, and the half on the metal cookie sheet didn't work at all. The half in glass was beautiful. Also, we need to make this again to give it a fair review as the flavor was terrible using Strawberry Kool-aid! I am giving it 4 stars because the taffy worked wonderfully (cooled in glass) and I am sure with better flavoring it would be fantastic.

I believe the secret to the sofness is the cup of corn syrup and not exceeding the 234F soft ball stage. I am a professionally trained pastry chef and have worked many times with sugar pulling making center pieces etc. I am a firm believer of using a QUALITY candy thermometer. My grandmother always used the ice cold water soft ball technique but the thermometer is a NO FAIL given! Candy making is an art and it involves significant knowledge and skill.

This turned out really well--especially for being my first try making candy.  I too didn't have kool-ade, so I used jello (I cooked the jello with the sugar).  It lacked flavor, but I am currently making it again, but with kool-ade to see if we can't get some grape taffy.  The kids loved helping out with streching it.

I used the new tangerine flavor Koolaid.  The resulting taffy was bland until I added 1/2 teaspoon of food grade citric acid.  Now it really has some flavor.

I tried it and it turned out rock hard. I read a different review and it said that the type of sugar mattered. I used cane sugar and it didn't work. :( I'll try to boil it to a different temperature next time! Maybe 225 or something. I used molasses as flavoring and it tastes great, it's just hard candy form ;)

I tried making this taffy two times. The first time, I got impatient(because I used a smaller pot) and poured it out too soon. The second time, I used a large pot and poured it out exactly at 250. I thought it would be okay, but it was much too hard. Perhaps this is because I used extract instead of KoolAde mix. Was it too hard because I added the extract and coloring after It had cooled? 
Usually, hard taffy doesn't stop me, but I'm afraid I might pull out my braces.

I made this with my kids.  Had to let it sit 4 hours to firm up enough to scrape off the cookie sheet.  It never got to a taffy consistency, just to soft to deal with (although hilarious to see kids with webbed fingers) until it was too late. It also stuck badly to any wax paper used to wrap it.

Awesome Recipe! Family Loved it! A missing direction. While cooking, constantly mix to keep sugar from forming crystals. I also only had 3/4 corn syrup, so I added an extra 1/4 cup water & 1 tablespoon of Vanilla Extract.

I will definitely make this again. Instead of one package of kool aid, I used two. I also pulled it off the heat just before it reached 150°F but after it reached 145°F. PS. Only let it set for 5 mins or it will become too hard. Also the next time I make it I will wait for the taffy to cool after I cut the pieces.

Had some issues at first. Best advice to give anybody is patience it will get to 250 to 255  on medium i have regular stove top it takes time.It always sits at 225 for awhile I waited 5 to 10 minutes and it was up to 250 . I heated it to around 255 to makes sure it was not too mushy. You have to pull it to get it to firm up also. I pulled it for a half an hour.  The only thing I changed is i used parchment paper otherwise it sticks too much to the wax paper.

ALthough this recipe is delicious, mine came out rather firm and hard. I think next time instead of cooking until 350 I may try 340-345, softball stage. Also I used two packages of koolaide in mine ans it was a great flAvor!  I made lemonade.

I haven't tried this recipe but I had to comment on the review by FOA, regarding beet sugar.  That's about all they sell in our stores, since we live in beet sugar country.  I don't have problems with candy recipes as long as my thermometer is accurate.  imho
