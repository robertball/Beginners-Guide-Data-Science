this recipe was great but... the longer it sits the better it is!!! so if you are not in a hurry let it sit over night... it is so much better!

I've made this twice now, and have received many compliments.  It serves a lot and you don't have to worry about the cheesecake cracking because of the chocolate topping.  I used lowfat cream cheese and sour cream, and splenda to make it a little bit more diet friendly.

I have made these once for a church event and the  problem with them is that there is never enough! And now I get asked every time if I am making my cheesecake squares.

I made this recipe exactly as is, and it turned out DELICIOUS. I brought it to a dinner party and every single person that tried them said they loved it.

Another winner!  After chilling it overnight I was disappointed when I tasted it cold the next morning.  Later that day I took it to my Tuesday night dinner group and we ate it at room temperature (everyone loved it)!!  By the next day it tasted good either way (straight out of the refrigerator or at room temperature).  Will definitely make this again.

DELICIOUS!  Made this for a potluck and it disappeared almost as soon as it touched the table.  Didn't make any changes at all...it's perfect the way it is!!

Sooo good! Followed recipe exactly, except for the chocolate topping- I used chocolate chips instead of baking squares.  Finished product looks just like the picture! Tastes best the day after, once it's completely chilled and set. Tip for easier cutting- after topping with chocolate, let dry for 5 minutes or so, the draw knife through cheesecake into amount of pieces you want, cleaning knife after each cut. Then it will be super easy to separate each piece after it is chilled! Otherwise, getting through the hard chocolate can be difficult.

Oh wow... These are awesome!!  I didn't change anything but the amount of topping - as written it wasn't quite enough to cover the bars adequately.  I upped the chocolate to 6 squares and added close to the same amount of butter.  Everyone wanted the recipe! :)
