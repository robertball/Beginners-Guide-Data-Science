It is a great way to use leftover ham! I used peas instead of asparagus because I didn't have any and used a light mayo dressing as it was more liquid. I also used half Italian breadcrumbs and half panko. Easy kid friendly. Thanks for this recipe!

Awesome awesome! Double the cheese and add some juice. Any kind of juice and more butter and OMG don't use anything but fresh asparagus tips! Awesome! I used leftover ham from Sunday dinner. The flavor is SENSATIONAL! And so easy too for a weeknight meal. Add soft yeast rolls and that is ALL you need! Thanks for the recipe!

Loved it. Cut the macaroni in half and added a cup of beef broth. I made this ahead of time and cooked it in the oven for 60 minutes.

My son and mother in law loved this. I used the recipe as a guide but we had spinach instead of asparagus and I added yellow and red bell peppers plus double the cheese. I didn't have bread crumbs so I substituted crushed Ritz crackers. 4 of us ate the whole pan in one meal.

Not bad, but a little bland. Needs something added to it.

Made a couple changes. Used lemon pepper and garlic salt. Crushed potatoe chips in place of bread crumbs. Great way to use left over ham.

Really good but it sure was a lot of food for two people:-). Guess I should have cut it in half. I only gave it 4 stars because I'm not a big fan of ham or asparagus but my husband is. However I love pasta so it was a win-win.

Going to revise my review. My son who wasn't home for dinner the night I made it ate it the next day and thought it was the best thing ever! It really is according to what you like. Its really not bad cold. I told my husband as I was making it.. this is not enough liquid.. and he was saying that is just too much pasta. In the south we like casseroles to be casseroles not cooked pasta tossed salads. It might be fine dining for others. But for us.. It was SO dry and the onions weren't cooked. It was like you tried to toss a salad of cooked pasta and ham with a sliver of cheese.

After looking over the reviews I took some suggestions: I added 3/4 cup broth sauted onion first I used both asparagus and some broccoli florets (as I didn't have enough asparagus) added a tsp garlic powder doubled the cheese and I used egg noodles instead of macaroni. It was great! Fed all 5 of my family with leftovers for lunch. My 10yo had 3 helpings. Husband added a little sirracha to it and said it was fantastic! I gave it four stars only because of the edits needed but it's otherwise a great base recipe!

Very dry. Only using mayo for a sauce did not turn out well. Bland too. Won t make it again.

We liked it! I halved the recipe( since my husband can be a little unsure about new recipes) but added extra ham and asparagus and adjusted the other ingredients accordingly. I'll make it again!

A good stick to your ribs dish that is easy economical and feeds a crowd. I made a double batch to donate along with buttered wheat bread and a tangerine to a group that delivers meals to the homeless three nights per week. I did have a small bowl myself and would make again for my family. The only change I made was to use frozen peas in place of asparagus.
