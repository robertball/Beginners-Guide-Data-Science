These eggs have become all the rage among sous vide addicts! I've seen differnt times and temps and this one is my favorite. They really are easy and the best part, you don't have to sit there watching them in a simmering pan on the stovve, nevermind the mess they sometimes make in the pan. you just put them in your sous vide container and let them cook and it leaves you time to prepare other foods at the same time.

This begs for a video. They look beautiful but I cannot visualize. Rating was requited—and I am sure that is what I will give this recipe when I make it! Thank you.

This is way more trouble than necessary. I cook perfect poached eggs : bring an appropriate-size shallow pan of water to a low boil. Add 1 tsp whit vinegar. Crack eggs, One at a time, slowly add to water so they don’t spread too much.  Lower heat to a simmer. Cover and set a timer for 3 1/2 minutes. Remove with slotted spoon.

Yep, this works nicely.  It's the best sous vide recipe I have found.  I've tried the 74C 15 min recipe from another siteand it didn't work as well as this 75C 13 min recipe. I've tried a bunch of other ones too, over the years.  This is the best.
