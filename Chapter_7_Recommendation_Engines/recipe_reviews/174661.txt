Hmmm...okay so this is not what I had pictured in my head as to how the finished dish would look. I thought it would be more golden in color but now that I am reading back over the ingredients, the dark color makes sense. This is why I am a firm believer of putting "faces" to recipes that don't have one. I think it is important for people to have an idea what it looks in the end. I followed the recipe to the T and even though it didn't look pretty, it was VERY tasty. I sprinkled some green onions and peanuts over the top for looks.

Loved this recipe! I did add 2 cloves of pressed garlic to the marinade and used regular chili paste (its all I could find). Paired it with some white rice and soy sauce yum! Thanks for the recipe!
