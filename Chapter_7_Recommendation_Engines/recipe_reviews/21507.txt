This recipe worked out really well after some revisions based on others' suggestions.  Here's what I did:

1/2 box of small shell pasta,
12 oz. can tuna,
16 oz. fresh mushrooms (sliced),
2 cans cream of mushroom (10.75 oz.),
1 3/4 cans of milk,
1/2 cup bread crumbs,
3 tbsp. butter,
seasonings to taste,

Other than that, I cooked in the oven for 60 min. All other actions were based on the recipe's suggestion. Will definitely make again.

This is so easy! It is also a recipe that converts to low fat! Use the 99% fat free cream of mushroom, semi skimmed milk, a smaller amount of butter and low fat saltine crackers for the topping. My husband couldn't tell the difference.

I can only give this recipe a three stars.  There were so many bread crumbs called for that it dried out the casserole.  My husband and I ended up scraping off the crumbs and eating the casserole.  I will make this again but will sprinkle cheese on the top as a topping and I will use peas inside the casserole with the mushrooms.

Tasty, easy recipe.  Tuna & mushrooms together have a nice, homey flavor.  As others suggested, I reduced the breadcrumbs to about 1/2 cup, and also stirred shredded parmesan cheese into the tuna mixture.  This added a lightly cheesy, savory flavor to the dish.

2 cups of bow tie pasta didn't sound like much (some casserole recipes are odd in this regard), so I used the whole 12 ounce box. I kept the liquid the same, and added a little more tuna, used a larger casserole dish.  I baked for 30 minutes ( instead of 40) and then added a little shredded cheddar on top ,returning to the oven a few minutes to melt. We thought it was good; wasn't dry even with more pasta. You could add some color with pimentoes and/or peas, or just serve a colorful vegetable on the side. I would make again.

This is an easy recipe for your typical tuna noodle casserole, just what I was looking for.  I made recipe "as is" except I added a small can of drained peas and forgot to add thyme to the crumbs.  Yeah, there were alot of crumbs, I didn't put them all on top.  

Tuna noodle casserole is nothing exciting, it's just tuna noodle casserole, so that is why I gave it 3 stars.  The bowties rather than noodles made it look pretty on the plate though.

My husband LOVED this recipe.  He also likes mushrooms and tuna a lot, but I think the combination of everything is what made this dish.  I used egg noodles instead of bowtie.  GREAT.

I orginally made this for a friend who had just had surgery (It was during Lent) who asked for a Tuna Fish casserole.  She called me the next day to ask for the recipe as her whole family loved it.  I have since made it again, and agree.  This is the one for us.  The only thing I changed was to sautee the mushrooms first then add them.  I think once I even added just a wee bit of tarragon with the mushrooms before I added them to the casserole and also really liked the addition.  You can't go wrong with this one.  Thanks Amethys.

I made this tonight for my husband and I. I altered a little since we had different supplies. I added more pasta to yield more and added cream of celery to it. This turned out great! We were on the last crumbs in our pantry and this was exactly what we had. I think if I would've had cheese I would have added it.

This is a good twist on the usual Tuna Casserole. The second time we made it I added frozen peas. We will make this often.

I followed this recipe partially-I halved it for 3 servings but used a full can of milk, poured straight into casserole bottom, mixed with soup and seasonings, mixed in 1 can tuna, layered wheat rotini into sauce then covered with sauted veg I had on hand- white onion, green onion, celery, zucchini- no bread crumbs or cheese *(keeping it healthy) and added cayenne.  Peas can get a little plain, so this veg combo kept it classy-

My 8 yr old son loves this Casserole. I substituted frozen veggies for the mushrooms and added a bit or red pepper for more colour. Yummy.

This is great because you can use ingredients on hand to make this. My husband loves it and he is picky pick picky! I did change this a bit however. First I used shells instead of bow ties. I used 1 can of marinated mushrooms (adds just enough zing) I was out of milk so used 1/2 & 1/2. I also added a can of cream corn (adds more creaminess). While boiling shells added everything but bread crumbs and butter. Add thyme to soup. Bread crumbs were already seasoned so I didn't add any seasonings. Last I added cheese on top of the bread crumbs and butter. With respect to the milk and butter the ingredients can be kept on hand for a meal in a hurry.

Great, except - Only use 1/2 a cup of bread crumbs - eyeball it, and mix it into the mixture instead of covering the top with them.

This is the first time I've baked a tuna casserole...all these years I've only made a sauce and served without baking (that's the way my husband's mother made it, think "comfort food"). Imagine my surprise when he suggested I bake it!  It was very good...I did follow other reviewers advice. I cut the bread crumb mixture in half, added peas and I used sliced fresh mushrooms (sauteed in a little butter and salt). I used whole grain penne pasta since that's what I had on hand.  It was very tasty and the texture was good, but next time I will add a little more soup and milk to make it wetter as per my husband's suggestion.  Also, the thyme was a little overpowering, I will cut back on it.  A half teaspoon should be sufficient.  Overall, we enjoyed it very much (even the picky kids)!

Very good.  I added a little cheese under the bread crumbs just for some extra taste.  The only thing I would change is to lessen the bread crumbs.  There were WAY too many.  Good recipe though.

As others have commented, the amount of bread crumbs was far more than necessary and turned out dry in spite of the addition of cheese to the topping. In spite of that, however, this comfort recipe is tasty, easy, and easily adjustable.

I used thin spaghetti noodles, since that's what I had on hand. I omitted mushrooms but added frozen cauliflower, broccoli, green beans, carrots, celery, and onion. I sauteed the vegetables in olive oil while the pasta was boiling. Just before the pasta was cooked, I added 2 cloves of minced garlic and the tuna to the vegetable mixture. 

I also added a dash of celery seeds to the topping along with Parmesan and cheddar cheeses, a little garlic powder and onion powder

After reading reviews I omitted the bread crumbs all together and added 1 cup frozen sweet peas and 1 cup shredded mozzarella. It still needed some extra flavor. Next time I will make with sauted onion and a few cloves of garlic. Good way to use up what I had in my pantry though.

This is a great recipe! I used sage instead of thyme and it tasted like turkey stuffing. I also used rotini instead of bow tie pasta and found I needed to double the amount used to feed 5 people. I ended up adding another half a can of soup and another half cup of milk as well.

This was so yummy! I added a handful of shredded cheddar cheese to the mix for a cheesy flavor and also added an extra can of tuna (I love tuna!). After reading all the other reviews I decided to just guestimate on the bread crumbs, I know it wasnt a full cup not quite sure how much it was but it turnd out yummy! Then I added a little shredded cheddar cheese to the top! YUM! :)

Hubby and even picky toddler loved this recipe. I am so glad to find something else to do with tuna besides make tuna salad. I substituted the thyme for Italian seasoning and used fresh mushrooms instead of canned. This one is a keeper.

This was a good recipie with a few minor modifications. I grilled the mushrooms first with garlic and added a lot more spices to everything. I would also add another can of tuna next time. I thought it was kind of bland but an easy meal to put together quickly.

Delicious!  The only changes I made was to add more seasoning.  Easy and fast.

I modified this recipe slightly. I used fresh sautéed mushrooms, frozen peas, egg noodles and two cans of tuna. I omitted the topping and just mixed together a few bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese for the topping. Very good!

I added a little Italian Seasoning and used Italian Style Bread Crumbs. It added a little more flavor.

PS I needed to use a 1.5 liter casserole because I could not fit it into a smaller one.

There was way too much topping on my 1 quart casserole. My husband gave it a thumbs down. The thyme was entirely too overpowering and the rest too bland. Maybe if I had just sprinkled the topping on instead of using the entire amount as the recipe called for it would have been as others rave. 2 tsps is a lot of thyme as is a cup of breadcrumbs. I had to scrap the top off and throw it away, then sprinkle some cheddar on it to salvage the dish. Otherwise, the flavor was okay, just way too much thyme.

This was a great recipe. So good, one of my roommates ate my leftovers and lied to me about it. What are you gonna do? Will definitely make again now that I live alone.

Ok I rated this 4 star because I added more seasoning to make it 5 star for us. As a basic recipe, it is very good but adding garlic salt, dried dill and a handful of extra old orange cheddar to the liquids made it explode with flavour. Oh and I used crumbled ritz crackers for topping.

This is the WORST recipe that I have ever made!  It honestly tasted like something from the freezer section that you would microwave for 2 minutes.  Sorry I wasted the time and the money!

This turned out pretty tasty.  I cut back on the bread crumbs and substituted about 1/3 cup of French's fried onions on top, along with the bread crumbs.

I liked this recipe.  I did alter it a bit.  I used a can of cheddar cheese soup instead of the cheese slices. I didnt add the breadcrumbs until the the last 5-10 minutes and then added about a 1/4 cup milk poured over it all evenly.  It did take about 20 minutes to bake as someone else wrote.  I will definately use this recipe again!  Thanks

I liked it but didn't love it just didn't have enough taste. It needed more spice or something. I would make it again if I needed to make dinner quick or without much thought since it was so easy to make.

I didn't like this at all. Too much bread crumbs made it dry, although the thyme in the topping added a nice taste. There wasn't enough mushroom soup to so it ended up dry.

This was okay.  The flavors didn't seem consistent with what one would think of a tuna cassarole.  I think it would be a lot better with chicken.  It was decent.

I didn't care for this very much. I've had better tuna casseroles, this lacked flavor.  The only pasta I had was macaroni, but I don't think that would have made that much of a taste difference.  Definitely don't use the published amount of bread crumbs, that is way to much.  Half is plenty.
