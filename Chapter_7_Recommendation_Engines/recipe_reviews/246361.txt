I  like pesto and this was a really good lower carb alternative for your Italian food fix. Mine yield up a lot of water so next time I will try roasting the squash in a 450 degree oven for 40 to 50 minuets. Place squash in the roasting pan cut side up. The higher temp should result in a dryer more roasted squash that should cut down on the extra water that many reviewers reported. For longer strands try cutting the squash width wise in half. This really makes a big difference. Smaller squash will take less time. This will give you a more roasted and dryer squash that will not water down the recipe. Layout stands back on the parchment paper sheet,  turn off the oven and place back in the oven to further dry out.

I'm always looking for ways to use spaghetti squash, especially since I grew a ton this summer. I substituted a  good, homemade marinara sauce with sausage and skipped the pesto chicken this time. It was super tasty and cheesy. I'll definitely make this again, with and without pesto chicken.

My family loved this dish when I made it for them!! One suggestion would be to layer the spaghetti squash to better coat it in the marinara.

This turned out really well. The recipe was follows to the tee. The flavor was fantastic!!! I will definitely make this again. I think I may add sun dried tomatoes next time.

This was good and healthy but too much pesto. I will cut p stop in half and add onion and mushroom to it. I added a twist with fresh spinach layer on top then the mozzarella cheese

Delish!  I used a 2.5 lb. spaghetti squash, which provided the perfect amount of veggie base.  Used almost a whole 16 oz. jar of marinara sauce, and it probably could use a bit more than one cup of ricotta cheese.  But overall the flavors blended well.  Takes a good bit of prep, so allow some time on this one.

I gave it a 4 because I made some changes to fit in better with my weight watcher diet.  I used my own homemade basil pesto which I make with a scant bit of oil and mostly water for moisture.  I left out the mozarella cheese and only used grated parmesan cheese.  I substituted well drained greek yogurt for ricotta cheese and used less.  It turned out wonderful.

I found this recipe to be rather long and involved for an end product that wasn't very polished. While it was plenty tasty, there was a lot of extra moisture and the layers all blended together. The spaghetti squash gets compressed and just looked like any other squash by the end, so don't expect a noodly result. On the plus side it would probably be easy to sub a summer squash in if spaghetti squash isn't in season.

I actually missed a seasoning step and it still came out very flavorful. If you're worried about blandness, my recommendation is to use brands of pesto and marinara (or home-made if you have that kind of time I guess!) you know can carry a dish. You could use a tomato-based pasta sauce of your choice in place of marinara to further adjust the flavor profile. I would also suggest seasoning the squash layer (salt and pepper will do, maybe some garlic powder), subbing chicken thigh for breast, and throwing some parmesan on top with the mozzarella, for a couple extra flavor boosts.

Very good flavor, helped by the pesto. Rather mushy though. gjmstarman suggests roasting squash. Worth a try.

This was a terrific Fall recipe. We loved the chicken and pesto combo and we added lots sautéd mushrooms, diced onions and garlic. It turned out perfect. Once the fresh squash is out of season we plan to use angel hair spaghetti noodles.

Delicious. Did no chicken and instead did zucchini. I had company over so made it vegan style. I did shred some Parmesan. It is a keeper.

Probably one of the best dishes I have made. I didn’t have time to bake the squash in the oven, so microwaved it for another 5 mins and was absolutely perfect. To prevent watery lasagna I used 1 layer of noodles (dry) after the squash, added a layer of marinara sauce after that, one layer of fresh spinach, another layer of dry noodles and then the chicken. No ricotta. I added a bit of heavy cream to avoid the chicken from drying and baked covered for 45mins. Tourney out fantastic!

Really good! We substituted pork chops that we grilled earlier in the week for the chicken, fresh mozzarella instead of ricotta, and added mushrooms and spinach. We cut the squash in half and baked it for about an hour before addding it to the casserole, and used a whole jar of marinara sauce. Skipped the egg. Turned out great and will definitely make again!

LOVED this!!  My husband was wrinkling his nose while I was making it....but in the end told me it was really good and went back for a big second helping. And, my 21 year old son even had seconds and took it for lunch the next day.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this the other night and my husband loved it, he even ate all of the leftovers. The only changes I made was instead of marinara, I used four cheese alfredo sauce, it has fewer carbs than marinara.

I made it as is with store bought pesto and spaghetti sauce and when baked in the oven added sliced mushrooms on top, not covered, to lose the moisture.  It turned out great.

The only  change I made was to sub in cottage cheese for the ricotta.  This dish was very time consuming to prepare.  After baking the squash I let the shredded strands drain in a colander where 1/3 cup of water was removed.  Then I dried the strands with paper towels and got more liquid out but after serving the finished dish even more water pooled in to casserole dish.  Don't know any other ways to attempt to prevent spaghetti squash from releasing lots of water after cooking it.  The flavors were bland and disappointing.

My daughter and I loved this.  I made no changes at all.  I definitely will make this again.  Of course, you do have to like the taste of pesto.  Maybe next time, I will use 3/4 cup of pesto instead of 1 cup; otherwise will keep the same.

Robust flavor; but soupy. Wish I had used a 2 1/2 lb to 3 lb spaghetti squash as mine was under 2 lbs and I couldn't taste it often enough. If I were to make this casserole again, I'd do one single layer of each ingredient for better flavor identification and easier spread. Also, lessen the 1 Tbsp of Italian seasoning in the ricotta to not overwhelm it.

This is very tasty & I will make again. A few others felt the pesto was too overpowering. The pesto gave the normally bland spaghetti squash the strength it needed, in my humble opinion, & I liked the balance.  Mine was also juicy, as another suggested. I baked the spaghetti squash & chicken the day before so I could throw this together quickly.  Thanks for the recipe!

This casserole is very good, but also requires a good deal of preparation.  I felt it was a little heavy on the pesto, but my husband, who is not a big squash lover, really enjoyed it and felt it was worth making again.

Full of delicious flavors!  I made as the recipe was written, ok maybe I put extra mozzarella on the top!  Definitely will make this again!

Yum!  Did come out a little soupy, not sure why. Still tasted great, though. Will definitely make again!

Very good and healthy.  Pesto made it a little oily but not a big deal. Thanks! :-)
