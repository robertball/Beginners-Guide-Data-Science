I’m in agreement with the other reviews. The flavor is lacking something and the texture is very dry. I did try increasing the garlic, but it didn’t really help. Maybe it needs something tart like citrus.  I will not be making this again.

I agree with Jordan. Did you ever figure out what needed to be included to give it a bit more pizzazz? Do you think swapping out the olive oil with sesame oil would help?

Rather boring. A modified version of this recipe with something to add a bit more moisture to the mix would be appreciated. Will experiment and post with results.
