Great googly moogly these are good! I used Sriracha's Chili Garlic Sauce, made by the same company, in place of the milder Sriracha. I even used 1/2 cup of the sauce. This recipe is an absolute keeper. These would work in various salads, sandwiches or even used for deviled eggs. Thank you LilSnoo. *Update* I followed the recipes as written except this time I used the entire 8 oz. jar of Chili Garlic Sauce. PERFECT!

My husband wanted pickled eggs and finding a spicy version sounded great to him, so we (having never made pickled eggs before) chose this recipe. We made it completely as it says to, although my husband started 'testing' them after 2 days :-) After 4 days I tried one, my first ever pickled egg, and I must say, it was pretty great! After 5 days they were even better! Making more right now, and the only thing I will add this time around is garlic!

Added lots of garlic and sliced red onion and 1/4 cup more siracha. Make a double or triple batch - they are addictive!

I believe that making people wait 48 hours to eat these eggs is considered cruel and unusual punishment. So, I used quail eggs not just because they are bite-sized, but also because they get penetrated by the brine faster than hen eggs. Therefore, after 24 hours they were flavourful and delicious. I made one jar using the Huy Fong Foods Chili Garlic Sauce and one with the regular Sriracha. Both are exquisite. I also used Jan's Homemade Sriracha Salt (on this site) instead of regular salt. These make perfect gifts...if you can bear with giving them away. I found that 18 quail eggs is a good substitute for 12 hen eggs. Thank you for the recipe.

The only things I changed were the number of eggs, I used 5.
I used Franks Extra Hot Sauce, and this recipe turned out great!! I will make this again, but I will use a different hot sauce.
Change things up a little.

I love pickled eggs and I love Sriracha and knew I had to give these a try. I made as written except that I used quail eggs so that I would not have as long of a wait time and also so that I'd have bite sized eggs. These are excellent! I ended up sharing a jar with the lady who sold me the quail eggs and she asked me for the recipe the next time I saw her.  I highly recommend this recipe for all of you pickled egg fans out there!

These are pretty good. I added a teaspoon of cayenne pepper and some garlic, but I think I followed the recipe to the "T" otherwise.  I waited a week to try. I think they will be even better if left longer to permeate the center of the egg. I think my favorite part is the onions - this pickling brine will go good with vegetable like cauliflower or carrots as well.

I'm generally not a fan of pickled eggs but these may have made me a convert.  I used them in place of plain boiled eggs in a Chef Salad and they added just enough flavor to be interesting.  I like the idea of egg salad too.

I love Sriracha and pickled eggs so this immediately got my attention. I made it exactly to recipe and I love it! Next time I will try adding more Sriracha though because I like it spicy.

3.8.17  Had some friends over who are pickled egg lovers, but not totally into hot, hot  food.  These went over like the BOMB (their expression), they loved them, and I’m making more today.   Winner recipe, going into my Favorites folder!

I switched the water and Sriracha measurements omitted the onion (simply because I didn't have one). I also added 1 teaspoon of liquid smoke. The sauce tastes great! Time will tell after the juice soaks into the eggs.  I expect it will be delicious!

Just made these, well last week anyway to give them time to flavour up. Made as directed and they came out really tasty. Perfect for a low carb snack. So now I Can add garlic and I thought they would be much more spicy, sadly not so. Some one suggested chile garlic sauce. I'll go up a step and try Sambal Oelek. It's made by Huy Fong the Sirracha people. Now just to perfect the mix.              LilSnoo thank you very much.

My husband loves these eggs!  He's a huge sriracha fan so he can't get enough of these.  
Update:  I made these again and didn't have room for the water and also didn't have an onion to add so i left out the water and added garlic salt instead of sea salt and no onion.  My husband asked what I did and said they were way better.

I left them for 4 days before trying and they didn't get their pickled egg texture. They weren't very spicy either. I did like the sriracha flavour, but I was hoping for some nice spice to go with.

I thought I'd be adding another great review.  'Not bad, just didn't wow me like it did others.  I waited a week or more to try.  I didn't see what was so special.  'Glad i tried though.
