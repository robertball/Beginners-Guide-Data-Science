excellent flavor! very highly seasoned--probably the best prok roast i've ever made! DO be careful to add the potatoes with about 2 hours cooking time left or they'll be mush...very good mush but mush. i also thickened the sauce to gravy but totally not necessary!

Great, easy recipe. I did purchase the porketta seasoning in bulk food section so just rubbed the pork & added  beef stock.  Potatoes too mushy so will do separate next time. I had to make this a day ahead of time so was cold when I cooked it. 3.3 lb roast took 8 hours. Delicious & very tender. Will do again. Lots of stock for gravy.

Delicious!  I added the potatoes 1.5 hours before the roast was done.  When the potatoes and roast were finished cooking, I removed them from the crockpot and put foil over the platter to keep everything warm.  I then turned the crockpot up to high and added some water with cornstarch to thicken - voila!  Yummy gravy to serve over the meat and potatoes.

I made this today and it was everything I remember from when I briefly lived on the Iron Range in northern Minnesota. My pork roast was 7.5 lb. so I doubled the spices and used whole fennel which I prefer. My butcher was nice enough to de-bone the shoulder roast, so I seasoned it and tied it myself. Thank you for sharing such a great recipe.

Decent pork roast recipe-- a good change up from using Boston Butt for pulled barbeque.  I didn't have any fennel so I didn't use it, and the seasoning was still good.  I couldn't find a roast any smaller than 4 1/2 pounds, and 10 hours was still plenty of time to cook it thoroughly and make it tender.  I followed advice here and added the potatoes with a few hours left before cooking time was up-- the only problem with that was that there was no way to fit them all down into the juice and below the roast, so they didn't cook evenly.  Honestly, I'm not sure what to do about that other than just use less potatoes (the amount that will fit).  I guess you have a choice of either a bunch of mushy ones or a few well cooked ones.  At the end, I removed the roast and turned the cooker to high, then added a corn starch slurry after it had started boiling to thicken it up.  Seasoned well with salt and pepper.  This was good served with braised cabbage.

Solid but not great.  The meat just isn't overly flavorful on the inside, a solid but boring roast.

very flavorful. For my tastes it had a bit too much sodium though. I will make it again but would probably cut the salt in half.

Wow ! Another keeper.  We loved this roast with the slight hint of fennel.  Made gravy with the juices and served with the potatoes and some Brussell Sprouts.
