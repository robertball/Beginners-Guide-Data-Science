I made this a second time and it was fabulous! The first time I did not mix the berries and the creamed mixture. What a difference and what a great dessert. My entire family loved it. Just make sure to mix the berries and cream-not layer them as I did first time around.

being from nova scotia myself, I had to try this recipe. I had the inlaws over for supper and it was a HUGE hit!! I was concerned cooking it because when I took it out of the oven, it was still really "jiggly". so I left it in the spring pan and put it in the fridge for a couple hours. It firmed right up and tasted WONDERFUL. I will be making this agiin, and maybe trying to substitue different fruit!!!

Listing this as a cake recipe is a misnomer. It is in reality more of a tart. I would describe the crust as more cookie like than cake like. I have a recipe with the exact same ingredients and directions, but it is called "Sour Cream Fruit Tart" with the possibility of interchanging fresh fruits as the star of the dessert. I have made it with peaches and red raspberries to rave reviews. My only addition has been to change the amount of sugar mixed with the sour cream from 1/2 cup to one cup when making the blueberry version. This is simple to make with incredible eye and taste appeal which makes people think you are an incredibly talented baker. I have read all the comments about this recipe and noticed a few bad comments about this recipe. One: You must use the exact pan size called for. Two: Never use the new non stick or glass bottom spring form pans. Stick with the old cheapo regular spring forms. You will get better results. Three: Never ever use frozen or canned fruit with this recipe. You just don't get the same results.

This is a fantastic recipe!  I followed the advice of many other reviewers and mixed my blueberries directly into the cream mixture before pouring over the crust.  I used frozen, rinsed and thawed blueberries and it turned out beautifully.  We actually preferred it that night while still warm but it was good chilled the next day too.  This is a great alternative to pie when you just don't feel like going to the trouble.

This was VERY yummy!!! And very easy to make!!! I also made/baked this the night before, let it cool, and then put it in the fridge. took it out an hour before serving the next day. The whipped cream on top really makes the cake!!! Also want to note. I cooked it 65 minutes and the whole cake never browned, just the edges. It was perfect!

I have made this recipe many times with great success.  I have also mixed raspberries with the blueberries and the result is awesome.  This recipe appeared on the side of the boxes at Blueberry Acres in NS for many years.  Thank you Paul for posting it because when I moved to Ontario, I didn't bring those boxes with me.

Incredibly Easy and Delicious - was a hit at the party. I would suggest folding the blueberries into the sour cream mixture before pouring on top of crust.

First off, let me say I made this recipe just as written. It does not specify 'fresh' blueberries, just 'blueberries', so I used some I had frozen and thawed. There are mixed reviews on doing that - some say it does not work, and others have said it does. I am here to add my vote for NOT. Although, having not made it with fresh blueberries yet, I have no basis for comparison. I think this is another classic example of how important it is for a recipe to be written as specifically as possible, so as not to leave the cook guessing, thus increasing the chance for disappointing results. While this was delicious, not too sweet, and very refreshing, it was also very 'wet' and not that attractive looking. As another reviewer pointed out, the cream does seem to curdle with the blueberries. I cannot understand why many reviewers chose to mix the berries in to the sour cream, as the mixture seeps down into and around the berries, creating much the same effect as mixing them in anyway. Also, as others have mentioned, it does not seem to be fully baked when it's time to remove it from the oven, and in fact is still very liquid. However, after it has chilled it will have set up. So be sure to make this ahead of time. I will attempt this again some day and use fresh berries. As I say, it was delicious.

great way to use up blueberries....and it only took 15 min to throw together before putting it in the oven.  like the other reviews, I put half the blueberries onto the crust, and folded the other half in the sour cream mixture.

This was good, I'm in Nova Scotia and had some frozen NS blueberries left over from last fall which made it even better:) 
The only thing was the cake bottom was a bit hard and the top a bit wet (maybe because the berries were frozen?) I think next time I would dust the frozen berries with a bit of cornstarch to help the topping firm up.

I found that 4 cups of blueberries was a bit too much. 3 cups would have been good. The blueberries were too tart, so next time I would sprinkle sugar over the blueberries before spreading the batter over the berries. Other than that my family loved it for our 'cake & coffee' Sunday

After reading a couple of bad reviews for this, I was a little nervous about trying it, but I'm so glad I did!  Everyone seemed to love it, and my husband (who is not usually a dessert person) was still talking about it the next day.

I used a dark spring form pan and had no problems with it being burnt on the bottom or anything.  In fact, I had to leave it in for an extra 10 minutes.  I think my oven tends to run cool, though.  If you think your oven runs normally, or hot, maybe lower the temperature to compensate for the darker pan.  

I would definitely recommend mixing the blueberries in with the sour cream mixture.  I happened to be 1/2 cup short on the sour cream and it didn't seem to matter.  I made this cake the night before and refrigerated it until I was ready to serve it.  I made a big bowl of whipped cream and poured it directly onto the cake.  My spring form pan was deep enough to accommodate this easily.  The leftovers went back into the fridge, and if anything, it's better today!  The bottom layer is very similar to a shortbread.  I loved this and I will definitely make it again!

Followed the recipe,. except mixed the blueberries in with the sour cream mix.  This is the perfect dessert, sweet but not too sweet, rich but not too rich.  For those concerned about the apparent problem with the jiggly top, I cooked this on the middle rack for 65 minutes.  When I removed it from the oven, the edge was set, but not the rest.  Once it chilled, it was all firm.  Don't be afraid, try this.  You will be glad you did.

Fantastic. Folded in the blueberries as others said to do.  Used frozen blueberries and defrosted and dried with paper towels to decrease moisture and sprinkled cornstarch on them (very little) and it turned out beautifully.  Cooked at 350C for 75 min and then at 375 for 10 min to brown the top (had a dark spring pan and bottom didn't get too dark at all.)  It was amazing!

I love this dip.  I usually put it in a bread bowl and use the cut out bread as a dipper.  It's great with crackers too.  Everyone that has tasted this dip loves it.

The top took forever to look cooked which made the bottom way too overcooked!!! I used a tephlon/dark coloured spring form pan which other reviewers said ruined the cooking process, I totally agree.  All my other spring form pans are metal/silver looking and I have never had that problem before.  I even used parchment paper on the bottom to try and avoid the problem but that didn't work!!!  I think if I had the right pan it would have been good.

I made this for the first time and I am eating at this moment. Its really good. I made one modification. I added cream cheese in with the sour cream mixture. 1/2 of the creamed mixture went into the blueberrys and 1/2 on top. very delightful.

This was okay.  Easy to make and looked great but not the best blueberry dessert I have ever made.  Brought to a BBQ, some people loved it, some thought it was just okay.  Folded in the blueberries as other reviewers suggested but I think I would have liked the layered "look" better if I had not.

Love love love.
I ended up using huckleberries instead of blueberries because we still had a ton in our freezer, I also mixed the topping and berries together. 
Turned out soooo great, going to so make it again.

I would not make this again. I did take some liberties, adding more eggs and oil in the crust as I was using whole wheat flour as I had no white. However, I just did not care for the taste of the berries with the sour cream nor for the fact that by the time the top had got even slightly brown the bottom was very dark and hard. not very impressed. Should have made blueberry crisp instead.

This was very easy to make, the crust was very good but I was disappointed with the blueberry topping, I found it bland.

I made this tonight and served it warm to my friends. It turned out great! It was a little soft on the top, but I think it's because I didn't let it cool.  A delicious treat! Not to sweet, and very tasty!

Easy to make just as written, but next time I would try mixing the berries with the sour cream as suggested by reviewers. It taste like a cheese cake with a shortbread crust. Fast and great.

The cake/crust layer seemed too thin.  It seemed to have way too many blueberries in comparison.  It was tasty, but I am wondering if the recipe is correct.  Thanks,

I made this for Easter dinner for company and it was a hit!  I used an 11 inch springform pan and customized the recipe for 13.  In addition I added another tbsp of sugar to the sour cream mixture and it was perfect.  Not too sour and not too sweet.  I also refrigerated the cake after it cooled and took it out 1/2 hr before I served it. Easy to make, can make it the day before and it's delicious!

I added lemon zest to the crust for more zing. Great way to use those fresh blueberries from Coscto. We love this. I did refrigerate it before serving.

Although recipe says to cool, I suggest to put in the refrigerator until set. The blueberries ran and it was a little messy. But the recipe itself is delicious and definitely will make again.

I chose this recipe because it was easy to make, quick and truly yummy sounding for a dessert... It met my criteria for something creamy, crumbly and fruity at the time. I substituted greek yogurt for the sour cream and used Stevia sugar to make it a more guilt free dessert, mixed the blueberries with the creamed mixture and cooked it for 60 mins in 190 degrees, let it cool and chilled it overnight and it was perfect! Cookie crust was just the right sweetness and and golden brown. :) Would definitely keep this recipe in my collection :)

I modified the recipe to individual tarts/cupcakes. 1 tbsp crust in each cup, 1 cup additional blueberries, & had to make another 1/2 batch of the sour cream mix. They were baked for 40 mins, till top crust was light brown. I used foil cups which allowed the bottom crust to brown nicely. Next time I'll probably flour the inner cups for easier removal.

I followed the recipe, except that I did mix the blueberries with the topping, as other suggested. I've decided that ruins the three-layer look. It turned out fine, but for presentation, I'll have the three distinct layers next time.  The blueberries peeking through the top of the sour cream mixture, once cooked, just didn't look very appealing. I wouldn't suggest doing it. 
Some reviews mentioned a runny or watery top layer with the blueberries.  I used fresh, and I dried them thoroughly prior to using them in the dessert. 
It's wonderful tasting, and not too sweet.  We loved it!

This is a great basic recipe for any fresh fruit (In the photo I used chopped fresh peaches) and you don't need the special cookware. I made it in an 8" parchment lined cake pan, let it cool in the refer and then simply lifted it out by the paper and transferred it onto a serving dish. The cooking time or amount of the ingredients was not adjusted. The crust has the density and flavor of a scone. As some of the comments suggested, I added a bit more sugar to both the crust and to the cream mixture. I mixed the fruit with the cream. I've also made it with frozen blueberries, thawed, drained onto a paper towel (Don't use wet fruit!) Also I added the zest of one lemon to the crust. I served it with creme fraiche whipped with powdered sugar so it would be more like blueberries with creme - but it's fine without any topping at all. It went over quite well!

Holy Moses, was this ever good. Even without the whipped cream. It looked and tasted fantastic. I did take the common suggestion of mixing the blueberries with the sour cream mixture and it turned out very well. My family gave it rave reviews at our Easter dinner,... so much so that I made it again for Easter brunch! Fabulous recipe. Even I couldn't screw it up! Thanks for sharing.

My mom was never a great cook, she's an amazing artist and admitts that cooking/baking has never been her strong suite. She was however able to make this recipe perfectly throughout my childhood... nice to see it on here, it's a tasty one and a must try for beginners as it is fail proof.

I've baked this 5-6 times over the last couple years. It's a delicious recipe for fresh blueberries. I always get compliments on it and it's very easy to make. One suggestion; always use a light colored pan to bake in; a dark one overbakes the crust; it comes out too browned. I only made this mistake once...........It is now July, 2012...I have made this numerous times, have one in the oven right now. I have made one change to the recipe. My blueberries are grown in our yard and are tarter than what you buy at the grocery store (better in my opinion) so I add 1 cup of sugar in the sour crean mixture instead of 1/2 cup, makes it even better and still not too sweet since my berries are tart. Oh, and for the ones that said their crust was hard, make sure you lightly pat crust into the pan just like the recipe calls for. If you press it in too firmly it will be hard.

I also am from Nova Scotia and this is a popular dessert.   Never fails to impress and even for me it is good and I don't care for blueberries!!!!   Raspberries can be substituted.
Nice to see it in print.

I made this for my family yesterday and it was a HIT!  I made it as written and it was perfect.  My kids were thrilled to have something with blueberries that they picked themselves.  Thank you for a great recipe.

I thought this was so simple and delicious.  If you want a super sweet dessert, this is not it.  I mixed the blueberries into the topping.  Serving with whipped cream(I used lite cool whip cause that's what we had in the fridge) is crucial--it really sets it off.  This is an easy and great-tasting dessert that I will definitely make again!

I didn't really care for this cake. My daughter liked it though that's why I am rating it a 3. I didn't like the cake crust at the bottom. I was expecting it to have more of a pie crust consistency, boy was I mistaken. It turned out to be a cake bottom and a pie top. If that's what you're looking for you will love this cake, otherwise I would pass.

I made it per the recipe. I was very good. I would toss the berries with sugar when I make it again tomorrow, as my  berries were a little tart. Otherwise it is delicious. Very simple to make.

I loved that it was a different from the usual blueberry cake. This is not the prettiest cake, but it is saved with a dollop of whipped cream.  It had just the right sweetness for us. The family enjoyed it.

Great recipe. Made for a friends Birthday, huge hit. I always read the reviews before trying a recipe and I did follow the recommendation from another baker indicating to mix the blueberries with the sour cream mixture then pour onto the crust. Good call! I'll make this again!

I'd not made changes.  The crust was sooooooo hard we had a hard time cutting it. The top tasted good but when I took off the springform pan, some of the liquid has not gelled and it leaked. By the way, it had been in the frig overnight.  Just plain disappointing.

Made this for my husband.  Actually made 2 small ones,  one with peaches  and one with blueberries.    Both came out good.  My husband loved it with peaches.   Will definitely make again.
Made this again with peaches and blueberries together.  Oh So Good!

I almost doubled the sugar for the crust or bottom layer which next time I will cut all ingredients in half to make less crust email and double up on sour cream  and blueberries. I used frozen blueberries and it turned out wonderful one of the best uses for these berries they got tough even just heating them and sugar or syrup

Fantastic, the crust was like graham cracker crust. I will try it with different types of fruit. I tried strawberries - fantastic. Just slice the berries an substitute it. Next time, I am trying it with peaches and nectarines.

I have made this recipe at my place of work, to rave reviews. Have even doubled and tripled the recipe as per demand. It doesn't have to be cooked in a ring pan, a large 9X12 worked great. Also, for fruit, we usually had fresh apples and pears left over that couldn't be sold, so I diced them up and add a bit of honey. What a wonderful taste!!One of my favorite Go To's.

I, like many others, mixed my berries in with the sour cream mixture. After 70 minutes at 375 it was VERY jiggly. After about 30 minutes it the fridge it was still warm, but mostly set. I topped each piece with a large dollop of freshly whipped cream. It was good. My husband thought it was excellent.

I made this cake last night for my sister and brother-in-law's birthdays.  Instead of using blueberries I made it with strawberries, chopping them into small pieces.  It was fabulous!  Don't skip the whipped cream on the top - I think it's a necessity.  Thanks for a dessert recipe I'll use over and over.

Great tasting "cake".. BUT the "cake" part was pretty hard and more like a cookie than a cake. Don't get me wrong, everyone raved about how great it was.. but a softer cake layer would've made this five star!

I just love this recipe. Easy to make and if you are a blueberry fan like I am it's a must to try. The only change I did to this recipe is that I folded blueberries in the sour cream.

Made it and mixed the blueberries with the sour cream mixture as suggested. Fantastic result. Tried it warm and again the next day cold. Fruity, not overlyl sweet, light dessert. THEN tried it zapped in microwave for 30 seconds and served with a dollop of whipped cream and I died and went to heaven.

Well that was different!
Not sure what went wrong but the top was sure runny. I baked at 360 instead and cooked about 10 minutes longer. Also used low fat sourcream(Maybe that was the problem?)
The idea is good and I would have to try again....
Okay, Okay.....sooo I needed to let it cool!!
Changed from a 3* to 5*. Taste as good as pictute looks. I sprinkled top with cinnamon before putting in the oven.

I had too many blueberries and some sour cream leftover from a party, and there was no way I was going to eat them all before they went bad. I found this recipe and decided to try it. It's not the most attractive looking dessert I've ever seen, but the taste is just lovely.

I was attracted by the photo and old-fashioned style of this recipe and it did not disappoint. I used my 9-inch bright shiny springform pan, and the only change I made was to mix the blueberries with the filling. 60 minutes was enough time in my oven to brown the edges, and while the centre was still jiggly, it firmed up after it cooled as mentioned in another review. I put it in the fridge after it reached room temperature and took it out just before serving time. It was great, but next time I'll leave it out of the fridge to see how it tastes when it's warmish or room temp. I loved the thickness of the shortcake-like crust because it balanced perfectly with the filling. I pressed it down lightly as stated, and it was not tough at all. I made it for guests and everyone just loved it, from the beautiful appearance to the lovely taste. I served it with fresh whipped cream flavoured with 2 tbsp sugar and 4 tsp fresh lemon juice. Thanks for sharing a keeper!

Not really feeling the love here. This recipe does have potential and I may try again and adjust the recipe adding a LOT more sugar ( probably double the amount) to both the crust and the filling. In our house the whole point of dessert is to have something sweet.

I made this last night. Mine came out mushy and all the blueberries leaked out of the pan on my beige counter top and yes it stained it and I had to bleach it out.
Not happy and not sure what went wrong  I never cooked it on 375, that was way too hot for my oven so I cooked it on 360 and that was too hot also . Everything else I followed exactly.

I thought this sounded so good and it was fairly easy to make, I followed the recipe exactly  but, just not what I thought. The crust (more like a cookie type crust) was a little too thick for me and not enough blueberries. The topping didn't add much so I may just mix it in with the berries like some others have done. Also, this is just my opinion but I thought it was just a little too sweet.
Overall it was ok and since I still have a lot of blueberries left I may adjust the amount to make less crust and add more blueberries.

Ok, I just looked at the recipe again when a reviewer mentioned 4 cups of blueberries. I put in 2 cups! No wonder there weren't enough berries. Even so, the rest of my review still stands. I'll try it again.

Pretty good recipe and easily adjusted with healthier ingredients too.  Switched sour cream for non fat Greek yogurt to cut the fat.  But definitely a long wait before it can be enjoyed with an hour baking time and about that to cool.

Maybe I shouldn't have mixed the berries into the cake mixture as another reviewer had suggested because my cake turned out way too runny although I left it in the oven longer than required by the recipe. Maybe it's just way too many berries for this recipe. Either way, I did not like that combination at all!

Followed the recipe exactly as written and the "cake" turned out wonderful. I didn't mix the berries with the sour cream mixture, as some have suggested, but instead carefully poured the mix evenly over the blueberry layer and this cooked up beautifully. The next time I make this I will cut back on the crust amount just to thin it out a bit and I will also increase the sugar in the sour cream mixture, as it did lack the sweetness we Americans are accustomed to in our deserts. An easy, impressive desert.

4 cups of blueberry really was too much (could cut out 1-2 cuts and still be okay).

Why didn't my sour cream layer rise?  Not even a centimeter!  I used a 9" spring form pan and it looks delicious but not even close to the photo.  Any suggestions?  Thanks!  It was still delicious, though!

Every summer I pick many gallons of blueberries at an organic farm near my house. I am always looking for new recipes that use blueberries. I tried this recipe last summer and it is one of my all-time favorites. Everyone I have served it to has  liked it. I am anxiously awaiting this year's crop of blueberries. Nova Scotia blueberry cream cake will be the first recipe I cook!

I made as directed.  Plain tasting.  Crust burned some in less time than directed.  Crust was bland and dry.  There are much better recipes out there.

I only had half the blueberries so I halfed the cream recipe as well.  It was still plenty, it probably would have overflowed if I used 4 cups of these blueberries.  I thought it was very good. I ate it for breakfast the next morning even.

This was awesome!  Easy to fix, looked great, and got rave reviews at a dessert party I hosted over Labor Day weekend.
