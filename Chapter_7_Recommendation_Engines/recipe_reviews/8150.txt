My mother loved this cake. Very dense and moist. Very easy to make. Also good with chocolate chips.

Well, puddings aren't really supposed to rise.  That moist dense yumminess is why I love traditional puddings (the "give me some figgy pudding" rather than the jello variety).  While this recipe doesn't have a steam bath and isn't made in a pudding mold, it does approximate a traditional pudding nicely.  And persimmion pudding is always my favorite!

Cake did not rise at all and was tough. Taste was not bad.

Sorry, but I have to agree with the other review.  Cake did not rise.  It got done in about 45 minutes rather than an hour, and it needed more spices or something.

This is definitely a pudding (as in plum pudding) and not a 'cake' as most would think of it. My persimmons were a bit dry and didn't quite make the volume of pulp so I added applesauce and it was very good.  My only problem was that the flaming brandy I added didn't flame.  Oh well, so much for presentation, but it was delicious.

This was indeed dense and delicious.  I took Bachers suggestion and added 1 t. nutmeg and 1/2 t. cloves.  I chose this recipe rather than some of the others because it had a lower sugar content than most of the persimmon desserts I saw.  It did rise, but it'ts a small amount of batter for the size of pan suggested, so it was low but pretty. (see picture)  I may try without the spices to see if I taste the persimmon more.  Thanks Kiana!

Good pudding recipe, no fat, very low sugar, just a few ingredients and so easy to make.  My guests loved it.
