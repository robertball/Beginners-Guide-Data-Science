I often find that cinnamon can overpower, but there's just enough in this smoothie to add a little bit of interest.  This not only tastes good, but it's also a real winner nutritionally.  You may have to adjust the amount of ice to reach your preferred smoothie consistency, but other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks, Cindy, I drink a lot of smoothies, and this one will go into my morning smoothie rotation.

I replaced the honey with agave nectar and the banana I used was not frozen.  I do not think frozen ingredients provide the same flavor and it seems cold enough to me.

Delicious and nutritious! I love the combination of strawberries and banana. Very easy to make and perfect for a cool, refreshing breakfast on the go. I did cut back on the cinnamon a bit but other than that it was fabulous!

I got a new blender for Christmas & I made this smoothie. The first one I've ever made myself. I'll be making more.

I didn't have flax seeds or chia seeds at my local grocery, so the first few times I made it without, most recently I found flax. I don't know the difference in flavor... 
As for my review.... this is one of my favorite morning smoothies pre-workout. It wakes me up better than coffee does. I didn't know that cinnamon has that affect on some people... but I love the flavor and I love the energy boost it gives me. I have them frozen in my freezer in mason jars and I just pull one out the night before and it's ready pre-workout.

I cut out on the protein powder, flax seeds and cinnamon. I also only used a 1/2 cup milk because I like thicker smoothies. Next time I think that I would skip the honey but other than that itâ€™s good!

Strawberry and banana.. what's not to like. I changed the servings to 1 and had to revamp. Because 1/4 cup of liquid isn't nearly enough for a blender...so maybe the serving size should be 1 or 2 for  the entire thing.? 
For one serving I used 1 cup of liquid (half water half coconut milk) 4 large strawberries  half a banana 1 scoop of vanilla protein powder, 1/2 teaspoon chia seeds,  2 large ice cubes. I omitted the honey and flax seeds.
Taste was great. Measurements for servings is odd.

I didn't have the seeds so I didn't include those. I only had pumpkin spice instead of cinnamon but I'll try it without the spice tomorrow and see how that goes. Very yummy and zone friendly. Thanks!

Love this! The cinnamon is great! I substituted coconut milk for the almond milk and it tastes delicious.

Very good.  I can't give it a 5 star only because I didn't use all the ingredients. (only the first 3) Will try again with all ingredients except maybe not the ice cubes.

I used frozen strawberries and banana, so I added 1/2 cup water and did not add any ice. I should have cut back on the cinnamon.
