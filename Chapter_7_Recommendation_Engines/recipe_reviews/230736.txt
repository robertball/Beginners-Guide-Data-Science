I had some leftover Italian bread and this recipe was a great was to use it up. I added some over ripe bananas that I needed to use up also, and it came out nice.

4.5 Stars:  It took getting used to it being thin, but it is supposed to be like French Toast, so it makes sense. I assembled and refrigerated for 8 hours.  Very good and no sugar-free flavor at all.

This is wonderful.  I have been looking for a way to lower the fat and sugar in things and I sure did not miss them in this.  I like it as is and have done the cream cheese dollops as Paula did the second time I made it.

I let it sit overnight in the fridge, like the recipe suggested.  I also put a few little pieces of 1/3 less fat cream cheese cubes (about 2 ounces total) over the top.  It was good, but I did have to pour the syrup on it and sprinkle it with powdered sugar to give it a sweet enough taste for me.  Maybe I just have a sweet tooth!

Youâ€™d never know it was sugar-free!  Loved saving all the calories.   Enjoyed it with fresh berries on top. Yum!  Will definitely make it again. Thank you!

Doubled and made for family vacation--so easy and quick. The sugar is negligible, so I used premixed cinnamon sugar.

The flavoring was wonderful and the top layer was amazing...but no matter how long I baked it, the middle was still mush. I will be trying it again though, but I'll use a baking pan next time.

No changes and voila -perfect!!!
Can serve with fresh fruit on top and still nutritious!
The better the bread the lower the glycemic index/go for it!

This was very good.  I changed it up a little,though.  I left out the sweetener and put all the cinnamon in the egg/milk mixture.  I only baked it for 30 minutes and it was good, but I think it would be better baked the full 40 minutes.  I served it with sugar free maple syrup and it tasted plenty sweet.  I will try adding raisins next time.

Really nice. Tastes exactly like skillet french toast. We WILL be putting this on the "regular" menu. I love that I can make it ahead and leave it overnight in the fridge for Shabbat.

This was delicious.  I accidentally forgot to add the cinnamon and sugar with the milk and eggs so I sprinkled all of it on top and it still turned out.  I did add the cream cheese pats on top.  Either way, it would be delicious though!  I will definitely make this again!
