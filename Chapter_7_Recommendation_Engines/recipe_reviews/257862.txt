Very refreshing and festive for the holidays.
My kids also enjoyed them as a virgin cocktail while mom and dad indulged on something a little stronger. ;)

This is delicious as an aperitivo. I ran some fresh cranberries through my juicer instead of using bottled juice. I little splash of white rum or vodka would go well here. Thank you for the recipe.
