I doubled the potatoes, and omitted the eggs. Then added 1 heaping tablespoon butter and 3 heaping tablespoons sour cream while mashing. I also added dried parsley and a cup of shredded cheddar cheese while mixing. Before topping with the fried onions, I covered the potato mixture with more shredded cheddar. There were none left!!( this made a 9x13 ) My family is begging for more already.

This was fantastic... everyone asked for more, even the kids!  I did as others suggested and added a bit of garlic and some grated cheddar cheese.  
Delicious!

I have been searching for a good "make ahead" mashed potato recipe. THIS IS IT! I followed the recipe as stated except I added garlic but you could easily omit the chopped onion and the Durkee onion topping. They were creamy and not at all dry like so many make ahead recipes. A definte keeper.

Great recipe!  Potatoes were very smooth and creamy.  I used 5 lbs. of red potatoes and I boiled several cloves of garlic with the potatoes and mashed the garlic in with the potatoes.  My daughter, who isn't much of a potato eater, couldn't get enought of them.  I will definitely make these again!

Everybody really enjoyed these, I thought it went a little overboard on onions, so next time I may use half of a raw onion.  I also make a recipe similar to this with just mashed potato and cream cheese, which is comparable.  I also added some fresh parmesan cheese, I would make this again.

This was the perfect recipe for leftover mashed potatoes i had in the fridge! All i did was add the ingredients and bake. instead of the onions on top, i topped it with a little bit of garlic salt and a blend of mozzerella and asiago cheeses. delicious! perfect match with a meatloaf

Really liked these potatoes!! I was just going to make "plain" mashed potatoes to go with the pot roast I made for supper b/c that seemed the easiest.  It was my male roommate who found this recipe and suggested we try it. Since I had all the ingrediants and it was't difficult, I thought why not? The french fried onions are a GREAT touch and I am sinceer when I say I have never thought to add them to mashed potatoes before but they add a great touch. Although they certaintly did not need it, on our second helping, we tried some gravy over them and they're good that way too (but the gravy did mask their original taste).  Would make these again!

This is an easy recipe to make.  My husband liked it but it wasn't so popular with the kids.  I think the eggs give this make ahead potato recipe a fluffy airy texture.  Like some of the other reviews, I added some garlic for a little extra flavor.  I have a similar potato recipe without eggs that has cream cheese and sour cream.  As a matter of personal taste, I'll probably stick with that one in the future but this one has the potential to be a big hit if you like a really fluffy texture.  The french fried onions on top are a nice extra that I will try out the next time I make my usual recipe.  Thanks for sharing it!

This was really creamy and delicious, if a bit labor intensive.  I used scallion cream cheese because I had it and it turned out great!

This was excellent!  We had my parents over for dinner and everone loved it.  I did cut back on the onions and only used about 1/4 of one and I also cut up 8 potatoes instead of the required six. However, next time I'll probably just use 6 because I did have a bit left over.  Thanks for the recipe.  I'll be making this one again.

I added sour cream to the mixture, and instead of cooking the onions baked them in the mixture, final touch was Italian breadcrumbs topped with Bruschetta. Delicious. It was the side dish for Saged Pork chops, yummy.

These were good, but I think it would probably be better to tweak it a bit if I make them again. I will cut down on the cropped onion!  Way too overpowering for me!  Maybe also use a bit more potatoes/less cream cheese.  And definitely add some shredded cheese on top.  (Bacon would be good too.)  Really, it wasn't bad as is; it just could be better.

The potatoes came out pretty fluffy but the taste was a bit off. We ate it for Christmas but will not make again.

Very good. I use the cheese under the fried onions and that adds a little to this.  Can't quite bring myself to use that much cream cheese, but if I use half it's still good.

These had a weird texture. I didn't add the onion since I thought it would be too much with the fried onions on top.  It was a lot of work. I'm a housewife so I have the time, but if I had to go to work all day, I prob wouldn't want to come home & spend all the time doing this. Like I said the texture was weird. We didn't really like it too much. Maybe it was the eggs. Thanks.

Fantastic, thanks! I actually used 8 red, minced onion, threw in some garlic and added a splash of milk. Really nice to have a different way to serve mashed potatoes. Will make this over and over and over and over.... .

These are quite good, but I think I'd have to agree with the reviewer of 4-10.  I'm not sure they're significantly better than regular mashed potatoes to justify the extra work and expense.

Good...but not remarkable enough to justify the time spent.  I'd definitely recommend the garlic to give it a little more flavor.  It comes out quite fluffy, but I've had better mashed potatoes.

These were nice and creamy, but I guess we are just mashed potato lovers.  There is a lot of onion so I would suggest cutting back a little if you are not onion fans.  I also added 2 cloves of garlic for flavor.

I wasn't really thrilled with the flavor, and this wasn't something I could reheat (we tried, but it smelled and tasted funny because of reheating the creamcheese and eggs I think). I also tried to re-use leftover mashed potatoes to create the recipe, and I think that was a bad idea. I would start with fresh potatoes, and cut down on the minced onion next time, and I would only make enough for that meal next time as well, I might also cut out the eggs!

This is an excellent way to use up left over mashed potatoes! However, it doesn't seem to be quite as good as a leftover itself. Definately worth making again.

Served this at Christmas dinner. It was a big hit! Even the fussy teenagers liked it.  I doubled the recipe...and did not add onions. Everyone wanted the recipe! I was hoping for leftovers....but the casserole dish was scraped clean.

Good, but a bit rich.  Would cut back on the cream cheese a bit next time.
