This is the best egg salad I have ever eaten. I prepared it yesterday for a club meeting and MB is right, everyone raved and wanted the recipe!  I went exactly by the recipe, didn't change a thing.  Will definitely make again and again.  Thank you so much for sharing. Moss

I tried this recipe today with a reduced amount of eggs in preparation for the "after Easter" left over boiled eggs.  I shared the sandwiches with a neighbor and we both loved it!  We agreed that it had less of an "eggy taste" than most recipes.  May be a little spicy for children, but we adults need egg salad too!  Sandwiches or served in a chilled scouped out tomato - or in any number of serving vehicles, let your imagination guide you.  Thanks, I know a lot of us older children will appreciate this recipe.

Pretty good recipe, however, the sweet relish just didn't do it for me. Next time I'll use a savory relish. Didn't have any sour cream on hand, so I just used a lite mayo. I used olives that were stuffed with jalapenos which added to the "kick". Thanks!

I, too, tried to like this recipe but was very disappointed. It *sounded* tasty, but in the end was very overwhelmed by the paprika. It was not even close to a normal egg salad recipe.

This was horrible -- I'm so sorry.  I really looked forward to making this because I thought the outcome of the dish would be terrific.  It had an odd taste that grossed me out!

VERY GOOD recipe. My sweetie is very finicky about his egg salad and he just scarfed down 2 sandwiches! Just make sure celery is "finely" chopped or it's a bit crunchy.

This is a great egg salad recipe!  I couldn't stop eating it...yum!  I had a hard time finding the Chinese hot mustard, so I substituted Plochman's Premium Spicy Peppa mustard.  I omitted the olives (since I hate nothing more than olives) and chopped up some Zinger pickles to use along with the pickle relish.  I also LOVE eggs, so I put another egg in mine and used Miracle Whip for the Mayo.  Will definately make again!!

I am not sure if I did something wrong, but I did not enjoy this egg salad at all. It was actually fairly bland to me, and the taste of the olives and paprika was overpowering. I will try to make it one more time using less of those two ingredients because the recipe does look good and other people seem to love it.

Best egg salad recipe ever!  Folks who rated this recipe 1 star don't understand the meaning of "a kick".

Not the kind of "kick" I was looking for.  Too funky tasting.

I really recommend skipping this one.  While it did not have a typical "eggy" taste, the taste it did have was simply odd.  You must love olives and eggs together to enjoy this fully; a combination we did not appreciate.

This does have a kick--nice!  I wasn't impressed at first until I realized I forgot the hot mustard.  Once I added it, it was better.  The hot mustard sort of hits you in the back of the throat, but it's pretty good.  I just used Chinese hot mustard from a packet in take out Chinese food.  I didn't have any celery so I left it out.  I also added another olive or so and used a dill pickle spear instead of sweet pickle relish since I prefer dill.  This is nice on a sandwich.  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved this.  Only thing I did different was omitted the celery just because I didn't feel like celery.  So good.  I love egg salad and this is one of the best.

I really liked the hot mustard idea.  Unfortunately, I didn't have any so instead I added hot wing sauce.  I also added fresh dill, cilantro and parsley because I had it.  Replaced paprika with smoked because thought it would be more interesting.  It was good but not as good as I'd hoped.  Thanks for the recipe though.
