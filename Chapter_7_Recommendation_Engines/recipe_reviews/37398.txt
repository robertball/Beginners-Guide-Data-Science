This recipe has now become a staple in our summertime menu.  We use a lowfat half and half.

I thought that this pie was great.  It had a great flavor & even without meat, my husband really liked it!  I might try adding cooked bacon to it next time.  This recipe was easy & relatively quick.  I did cook this pie 10 more minutes than what it called for & that was all it needed (in a gas oven).

oh my GAWD!  Yum!  I just made this recipe....and while I planned to eat at 8, and it's now 10 and I've just finished - it was REALLY good.  I highly recommend it...just ignore that pesky 45 minute cooking time.  At 45 minutes, start CHECKING on it.

I had made this receipe before from the Southern Living Magazine but had lost the recipe.  So glad I found it again on this website.  Made it last night and came out great.  Good time of year to make it because the tomatoes are ripe for it.  Used Monterray Jack and extra sharp cheddar cheese and it came out delicious.

I've been making quiches like this for years, and they are sooo good! I definitely recommend using extra-sharp cheddar, also combining this with Gruyere and/or Emmental cheeses (they're a little expensive, but the flavors are wonderful). I also sometimes omit the tomato, pepper and basil and instead sautee a handful of mushrooms with the onion, and add a little more garlic. This is a great recipe that can be adapted however you like!

This is an excellent recipe that can be prepared easily with help from a food processor.  I have been making it for about two years and my husband and family always considers it a treat.  The recipe can easily be made into 2 pies, one for now and one to be served later or given to family.

Good recipe...I didn't use onions (husband doesn't like.)  I made two pies because I had two piecrusts.  I divided the two cups of cheese between the two pies-so each pie had 1/2 the cheese that was recommended and it still came out very good and not overly cheesey.  I was then able to freeze one.  FYI-you may want to spray the bottom with Pam.  I didn't and it stuck a little on the bottom (I used throw away tins.)

This is the best quiche recipe that I've tried.  It's so good that I make it all year long, not just during the summer as the name suggests!

Definitely a keeper! I used colby/monterey jack cheese and dried basil and it still came out great. I didnt have any problems with the crust getting too done. I'll be making this one again.

Really really tasty. Had no problem reducing the recipe for a smaller pie pan. I covered the edges with foil for the entire 45 minutes while it baked. Came out looking, smelling and tasting great. Highly recommended!

Delicious and nicely spiced.  More like an omelet in a pie shell than a quice or pie.  It took mine an hour an a half to cook though.

Really good I didn't put the tomatoes on top as I wanted a veggie quiche without tomatoes as my daughter can be funny about tomatoes. I also used a bit less cheese. Probably one cup. Will make again. Thanks.

I like a really intense tomato flavor. The last time I made this, I cooked 1/2"-3/4" sliced home-grown tomatoes on a cookie sheet at 200 deg. for 4 1/2 hours. They had a sweet, intense flavor that we absolutely LOVED!!!I layered them heavily over the top of the pie.
Next time, I think I'll add some bacon to the recipe. It's a great recipe!!!!

I really enjoyed this, and so did my guests. I used zucchini instead of the red pepper, white cheddar instead of the Monterey Jack and Gruyere instead of the Parmesan. I made it in a regular 9" glass pie pan, which was all I had (it didn't quite all fit, but almost) and had to bake for about an hour until it was set (the last 15 minutes or so I covered the whole top with foil as it was already well browned). I will definitely make this again.

Delicious! I have been making this since it first appeared in the magazine. This is easily customizable with ingredients including cheeses. This is great for any meal of the day. Thanks!

I made this for my mom on Mother's Day- it was a hit with the whole family. It was the first time I'd made a quiche, but it was super easy.
