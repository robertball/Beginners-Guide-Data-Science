This is a fabulous recipe; simple and fast!  I have made this five times now.  Even my hard to please mother in law couldn't complain about it! The best thing to do is steam the vegetables in a steamer basket.  Put the carrots in first until they are about 3/4 of the way done, then add the pea pods to the steamer basket.  As soon as the pea pods are in, take a small sauce pan and make the glaze.  Usually the vegetables are ready right when I get the glaze finished.  Then just dump the vegetables into the sauce pan, stir lightly so you don't break apart the pea pods, and Voila!  I can't thank you enough for this wonderful recipe.  :-)

This was great, and beautiful too!  I used baby carrots, steamed for about 7-8 minutes, (not boiled), then added the pea pods and only steamed for 45 seconds.  This was a perfect amount of time.  Then continued with the recipe, leaving out the cornstarch.  This went great with garlic salmon and brown/wild rice. My kids (aged 4 and 1) loved this too!

A good way to prepare carrots and pea pods. After reading the reviews, I cut the butter back to 1 tbsp, which was plenty. I also added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, 1 tbsp of balsamic vinegar and a grind of salt and pepper. Great flavour.

This recipe is really good. I used the tiny sweet baby carrots so no need to slice or chop. Tossed a few sliced waterchestnuts. Next time I will try a little horseradish with this recipe. Very yummy as is, though. Thanks for another tasty treat Michele.

I love this recipe, thanks so much for posting it Michele.  I made it for the first time as a healthy lunch for myself.  2 carrots and 4 large handfuls of sugar snap peas were perfect.  I feel so healthy!!  I used enough butter to coat the bottom of the saucepan.  I didn't find the honey overpowering (I used 2 tablespoons as per recipe) but added some kick with 1 and 1/2 tsp of garlic powder in with the cornflour.  I sprinkled celery salt over the dish just before serving as well.  This is a great meal on its own!!

I really liked these!  I used "tastefully simple" (a product from a taste testing party) honey mustard and WOW was I impressed with the outcome.  It was a great along side of a pork roast.  Thanks Michele, I'll be using this again!

THis was a great glaze - especially on the carrots.  I wasn't crazy about it on the pea pods - but maybe that's just because I prefer carrots.  I will keep this recipe and just use carrots next time! :)

AWESOME!!!!!  I used 2 cups of whole baby carrots and a sandwich baggie full of snow peas because that's what I had on hand.  It was very easy and tasted wonderful with our grilled meal.

Fairly simple but usually the best things are!  Ingenious putting the cornstarch in the butter.  Makes the "sauce" cling where most others just fall the bottom of the pan.  I may use that technique for other recipes.  Thanks for the great recipe.

WOW! This LOOKS and Tastes WONDERFUL!  Adding the Cornstarch to the melted butter really helps it cling to the veggies and the honey adds just the right amount of sweetness! This will be a MAINSTAY in our house!  I'm sure you can use the same technique with other veggies as well.

Very easy to make. I used baby carrots, because I am lazy. I steamed the veggies. I thought it was a tad too sweet, but everyone assured me it was just fine. They certainly disappeared! I used unsalted butter. Next time I will use salted. Thanks!

Everyone Enjoyed these.. I made mine with frozen mix of peas and carrots I had left over from a chicken pot pie night.  I wanted some more than plane steamed veggies and this was wonderful.  My husband who doesn't care for peas and my son that doesn't care for any veggies gobbled this up!  Thanks a lot a keeper.

Great! I only did carrots. It was like eating candy! The first time I made it I followed the recipe, but the second time I reduced the butter and honey and it was still yummy.

Very nice recipe.  I made it for company and they all asked for the recipe before they left! A nice mild sweetness, not overpowering.  I will make it again!

No carrots, just frozen sugar snap beans.  Microwaved for a while, then added to the dish the butter, cornstarch and honey.  Microwaved a little longer.  Nice glaze and great taste.  Easy.  Thanks!

I agree that this was a little on the bland side. And much better on the carrots than on the pea pods.

These were good except I over-cooked.  Probably should only cook another few minutes after adding pea pods.

Delicious! My family gobbles it up! 

I took the advice from another reviewer and steamed a small bag of baby carrots in a basket steamer for about 8 minutes, then tossed the snow peas on top of them and steamed for an additional minute. I also used half of the butter, cornstarch, and honey, which made for a nice and light sweet glaze.

I loved this sweet dish. My hubby did not like it at all. He said if it had been only glazed carrots then he was all in, but he sure didn't like the peas and honey. Too bad because I really liked this. I used regular peas and carrots. Thanks!

I thought this had a nice flavor and presents vegetables well. I used half the sauce to cut back the sugar and sat. fat. I am glad I did because for some reason the sauce didn't get as thick as my usual vegetable glaze so even more would have gotten wasted. Plus, the sauce was quite a bit sweeter than my regular recipe. I peeled the carrots and cut them into matchstick slices and couldn't find snow peas so I used frozen whole green beans. With my other recipe I microwave the ingredients so I just did that. It took about 8 minutes, covered with plastic wrap and about 1/4 inch of water, in the microwave. I also melted the butter in the microwave to and just stirred in the rest of the sauce ingredients. I then heated everything together for 1 more minute. Saves on washing dishes anyway.

Very good and simple. I used sweet peas in the pod instead of snow peas. I also added a dash of salt. Would make again!

I could only find frozen pea pods so they were rather limp and bland. I will try again this summer with fresh from the garden.

Excellent.  I had sugar snap peas instead of snow peas, but they were great.  That is the glory of this recipe.  Easy, tasty, and versatile!  A "keeper", as my family says.

Excellent!  We get so tired of the every day veggies!  This was crisp, refreshing and easy and quick to make.  We loved it!  I did add 1 tsp of artificial brown sugar.  We liked it just a little sweeter.

This turned out awesome.  Only thing I changed was I added about a TBS of soy sauce to give it a hint of salty too.  Oh, and I also didn't add the snow peas to the cooking carrots, I jsut added them at the end when I put the carrots in with the glaze.  Turned out awesome!  Will for sure make this again.

Good even without honey - as I was making this, I realized my honey had gone off and I couldn't use it.  Will try again with honey, but was good with just butter.

Even for a spicy palate like ours, this tasted pretty refreshing. Since, I had no pea pods, I used a frozen carrot, bean, pea mix. I covered and let the glaze cook a little with the vegetables on low heat for about 15 minutes. Thank you for a very simple recipe.

Quite good- I only did the carrots as DH won't eat peas. Loved the carrots though! The consistency was a bit strange though- the cornstarch left it a bit chunky...not sure if perhaps I should have stirred more before adding the carrots? But the taste was great. Thanks for sharing!

My family and I really enjoyed this dish.  Very nice way to get the kids to eat veggies.  I used baby carrots and snow peas.  I always follow the original recipe the first time I make a dish and tweak if needed.  This didn't need anything for us.  Perfect as written.  Thanks!

The cornstarch ruined these for my family.  Made it gooey in a bad way.  I think it's better to leave it out.  Even butter with a little brown sugar would make this combination way better.

I was looking for a honey glaze for my baby carrots and liked the reviews on this one.  I steamed my carrots since I just find that easier and then glazed them.  My family really enjoyed these.

I would definitely recommend steaming the vegetables as opposed to boiling them, especially if you prefer them with a bit of a crisp/bite to them. 

I saw lots of reviewers had mentioned that it was kind of bland so I went ahead and added some soy sauce and thought it was a great combination. Didn't thicken up as much as I'd like, but that could very well be me.... cornstarch and I don't always get along!

An easy and fresh side dish - will absolutely make this again.  I went with another person's suggestion and added the snow peas after I drained the carrots so that they cooked just slightly.  They turned out perfectly this way.

I have not eaten glazed carrots since I was a kid.  I made these for my toddler to encourage him to eat more of his vegetables.  He gobbled these straight up!

I fixed this with sliced frozen carrots and fresh pea pods. The contrasting colors and shapes adds much to the visual effect.  I rate this as excellent.

Very fast and easy!  I didn't have pea pods the first time I made this, so just used carrots, and everyone loved it.  Have since made it with pea pods too, and that was also delicious and colorful.  I'm saving this recipe, however, as my standard "fancy" cooked carrots recipe.  Have made it twice for company, and they thought I was "putting on the dog," even though I used large carrots, sliced quickly in the food processor in the morning, and whipped up this simple, colorful side veggie dish in a heartbeat.  LOVE IT!

I was excited to try this recipe because I like the simplicity of preparation ,quick cook time and healthy cheap ingredients for my family. But I'm honestly sorry to say that the "wow factor" in the flavor just wasn't there for us.
 I did not use 3 TBL of butter like the recipe stated. I am watching my cholesterol and frankly it only needed 1 TBL anyway. The flavor is very much there and the corn starch had enough butter to dissolve in to anyway. I did add some black pepper, at the end, only because I felt that the flavor was sorta ok but it really lacked something essencial. 
I served it stir fry style over white rice. My husband was ho~hummed by the flavor and so was I, Hence only a three star rating.However,once I added a splash or two of Soy Sauce over the veggies and rice, the flavor  improved the whole dish immediately. I Loved it! Because I tasted the sweet and saltyness of the veggies and truely it tasted it better. But until we doctored it up, it was  missing something and tasted kinda bland.

I made this as side dish for thanksgiving and it was a huge hit. Even though I insist on rating a recipe as it was written I must confess to using baby carrots instead of cutting full size ones, it was thanksgiving and time is a commodity that day!

This was good.  I just had some fresh carrots and wanted to add something special to them.  I think I will do this every time I have carrots from now on! Did not have pea pods, but no big deal, great taste anyway.

Very easy and flavorful.  Make sure you keep the veggies to "tender crisp" - they should still have the crunch factor after heating in the sauce,  Very colorful and helps create a colorful dish depending on the meat / fowl / seafood it is servied with.

EASY, not to sweet, just right. My husband did take others advice & steam the carrots & then added pea pods near the end. A nice change from plain frozen or canned veggies. Really spruced up the meal.

I was disappointed in this recipe.  The honey was nice, but the butter tasted overwhelming yet it provided the right texture so I wouldn't lessen it...  I usually caramelize carrots with brown sugar, so I think I'm going to stick with that.

Excellant way to use carrots. The little bit of honey was just perfect to accent the peas and carrots. Will use this recipe over and over.

This was delicious.  Unlike other recipes, this used ingredients that most people already have lying around in their kitchens.  Very simple to make, and yummy.  My husband, who doesn't like vegetables, loved them.  Kids like the sweetness from the honey.  A great way to get them to eat their veggies.  Highly recommend!

FANTASTIC! I added just a bit more honey cause I like them really sweet. I did not have any pea pods but will have this again soon w/ the pea pods. My sauce was pretty thick. Just the right consistency, in my opinion.

Yummy!  The family loved this - and they're not big on veggies.  The glaze was a little thin I'll probally try using less butter next time.  I also steamed my vegies instead of boiling them.

Made this for an anniversary dinner with steak.  Thought it was very good.  I really liked the honey taste on the veggies.  I used frozen peas and carrots and they still turned out yummy.  I also added some sliced orange peppers because my husband and I like them.  I think I used more honey than the recipe called for.  I just free poured it until I thought it looked like everything would get coated.

Very yummy! I think I cooked my snow peas a little too long though (I like them crisp). I used the baby carrots in the bag instead of slicing big ones.

Make a small addition.  I added some zucchini as I had a small amount left in my fridge.  Turned out very good.  I steamed the carrots first and then added the peas and zucchini.   Turned out very tasty.

Good base recipe. Added Balsamic at end as mentioned by another reviewer and cut butter back to 2 tbsp. Nobody likes overcooked peas so it is a must to cook only until bright green and shock in ice water bath to stop cooking, do this and your peas will be professional chef perfect, crisp/tender and very bright green! I matchsticked the fresh carrots to 1/4" and pulled from steamer at 2 minutes.

Surprisingly delicious and so pretty.  I used regular carrots cut on the bias as I have found whole carrots taste so much fresher and sweeter than the baby carrots .  The colors of the two vegetables together were bright and very pretty.  I served them with Scrumptious Salisbury Steak in Mushroom Gravy from this site and mashed potatoes.  I think my grandchildren will love them.

It was ok. Didn't taste the honey and unfortunately cooked it a bit too long and the snow peas were mushy (my fault). Not saving this recipe.

I made this twice and it is quick, easy and tastes great. I used baby carrots and steamed them until all most done then added the sugar snap peas. My husband likes them and requested them the second time I made them again. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a great pairing of vegetables and the sauce was very good with just the right sweetness and consistency.  I would not change anything and my teenage boys ate them all quickly.  Perhaps I should double the recipe.

Very good.  I've always just squirted honey onto my carrots before serving, and added a small pat of butter,  but this makes more of a sauce that would stick to the veggies.  For those reviewers who complained about a clumpy, gooey or thin sauce, remember - you have to bring the cornstarch to a boil so that it thickens the sauce -then there are NO clumps and it's a consistency that will stick to the veggies better.
Thanks so much for the cornstarch idea - I should have thought of it years ago!!

This was a perfect recipe! I followed it exactly except I only used baby carrots (I didn't have any peas). I will make this again and again, don't change anything, nom nom.

I had a large bag of snow peas from the Farmer's Market that I didn't know what to do with.  So I tried this recipe, and hubby and both loved it.  I might try steaming the veggies next time, but it was really delicious prepared in a saucepan.

This was really good.  I grilled one chicken breast, cubed it and added it right before serving over a bed of white rice.  Complete meal.  Will make again but will add some garlic to the mix.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is the best and easiest recipe!  I'm not a fan of cooked carrots, but made this way I'll eat them all (and so will my family).

This dish was very flavorful and a nice update to the everyday peas and carrots. The sauce was just the right consistency and sweetness. I steamed the vegetables instead.  I served this with Bourbon Baked Salmon and rice pilaf.  It got rave reviews, so I am making some for Thanksgiving.

So yummy!!!!!  My boyfriend who absolutely hates eating his veggies actually ate this and liked it!  I'm new to cooking still, and I managed to make this, so it was very easy.  This is definitely something I will make again.
