Seemed like there was too much flour. The egg whites collapsed under it, even adding a tablespoon at a time. Will try again and stop adding the flour mix when we get to ‘lava’ consistency.

wayyy too much flour/powdered sugar mix. had to up the egg whites to 9 and a cup of sugar for that amount to get to a workable consistency. 

if/when i try this recipe again im going to cut the flour/powdered sugar by 1/2 and add another egg white
