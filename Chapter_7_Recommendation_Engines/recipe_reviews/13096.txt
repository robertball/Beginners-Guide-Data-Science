Excellent!  As good as any mushroom soup I've had in a restaurant.  I did change it a little and made it a easier.  I sauteed the onions in a little butter and oil until the onions were soft and clear.  Then I added sliced baby portabella mushrooms with a little salt and cooked on low about 5 minutes.  I think this step brings out the sweetness of the onions and flavor of the mushrooms.  Then I added the chicken broth.  When I don't have time to make the broth I use a good quality soup base that has chicken listed as the first ingredient on the label.  This is as good as any broth you would make, not like bullion cubes. I skipped step two because I like whole mushrooms.  I like it better this way and it also saves time and mess.  To thicken the soup I just used my tupperware mixer and mixed the flour with a little water.  I added this to the soup mixture then added the half and half and the sherry.  I used the fat free half and half and no one had a clue.  Everyone loved it! Next time I'll make a bigger batch.

I took others' advice and substituted heavy cream for half and half. Also, only pureed 1/2 of the mixture so that I would have large chunks of mushrooms in soup. Very yummy taste and easy to make! (5 cups was approx. (2) 8 oz. mushroom containers)

Wowza! I couldn’t wait to review this. When it comes to the soup and sandwich deal, mine always comes out of a can and cream of mushroom is a casserole ingredient. But break out of your rut and serve this one to company! Not hard or time consuming to make and simply fabulous restaurant quality fare. The Soup Nazi would be proud of this one.  I had all the ingredients including the sherry (a miracle) and made this exactly as the recipe stated except pureed only half the mushroom broth mixture as other reviewers suggested.  One 8oz. pkg. of mushrooms yields about the 5 cups needed. Unexpectedly, my butter and flour got thick like mashed potatoes. But after you stir it all in with the liquids its fine. The thyme is the secret ingredient. It’s a unique flavor way beyond any canned and compliments the mushrooms perfectly. 10 stars!

FABULOUS!!  I had a soup just like this in Kennet Square, PA and have been desperate to find a similar recipe.  This ended up being even better than the restaurant soup, but exactly what I had been hoping for!!  

I used fat free half and half, vegetable broth, 20 ounces of pre-sliced mushrooms (half baby portabello, half traditional grocery mushrooms), only 1 TB of butter and 2 of flour (although next time I'd use less).  I doubled the onion to 1 cup sweet onion, added a bit of extra black pepper, and finally, used about 1/3 cup white wine instead of 1 TB sherry.  I also added 1 TB crushed garlic, which was a nice touch.  I only blended about half of the mushrooms and onions and left the rest solid.  

This was a fantastic soup, and I am so glad I used this recipe!!  Thanks so much for sharing!!

This is a pretty good mushroom soup recipe, with a little tweaking of course. I saute half the mushroom/onion/seasoning mixture - no broth yet - then I added a little half and half and put it in the food processor. Never add salt to mushrooms until they've already browned or it won't happen, but other seasonings are fine. I made my roux (that's the half butter/half flour mixture) at the same time. You're supposed to whisk it for a few minutes until it doesn't smell like flour anymore, and the "mashed potato" consistency another reviewer mentioned is desired - a roux is a thickening agent used as the base of many soups. Then add liquid SLOWLY - otherwise it won't mix into the roux well, and you'll get lumps. Once it gets to a cream sauce consistency, you can add your puree if you're using one. I keep the other half the mushrooms chunked, and saute those off as well. I hit them with the sherry, let the alcohol cook off, then dump that into the soup. I use equal parts chicken stock and half and half , until the consistency is how I like it. I've never measured, so I can't tell you the exact amount. Add salt and pepper to taste, I use red pepper flakes as well, and you're good to go!

I tried this recipe three times. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and the texture and appearance were awful. Next, I sautéed the mushrooms and onions in the butter instead of simmering them, and I didn’t puree anything. This was a big improvement. However, I still thought it seemed more like mushrooms with sauce than soup.  The third time was the charm, I doubled all the ingredients except the mushrooms, onions and sherry, and this time I loved it.  I also tried stirring a little left over Uncle Ben’s long grain and wild rice into some of the soup and thought that made a great addition.

C'mon, people.  If you change the recipe and add a little of this and that and take away a little of this and that, then it isn't the original recipe you're rating, is it?  This author went to a lot of trouble to put this recipe up and it should be rated as is.  The recipe is great and needs no tweaking.  If you change it, then submit your CHANGED recipe as your own.  Thank you for submitting this just-finne-as-is fantastic recipe.

Absolutely delicious, delicate, creamy flavor! I had the very good luck of coming into some fresh organic shitake mushrooms. I chose to spend them on making this soup, and it was the best decision I could have made. I followed the recipe exactly but only used 2 T. of flour and butter to thicken, since I knew the shitakes would produce less moisture than other varieties of mushrooms. The consistency was thick but good. For sherry I bought a medium dry amontillado, which lent the soup a delicious subtle finish. Don't skimp on the sherry. I do wish the onions had melted into the soup better. Maybe I'll saute them first next time, as some reviewers have suggested.

This is truly an excellent recipe.  The soup was very tasty, and had great texture.  I have used both fat free half and half as well as the real thing successfully.  I found that two 8 oz. containers of sliced mushrooms broken up made about the five cups the recipe called for.  Many friends have requested this recipe since I made it for them, so it is a keeper.

The reviewer suggesting that the amount of mushrooms and onions be halved while the rest of the ingredients remain the same was the most helpful and right on target.  So, for a mere three servings (with no leftovers!) I doubled the recipe to “12 servings”  using 6 cups of mushrooms (2- 8 oz. pkgs. - one baby bella and one regular button mushrooms) and 1/2 cup of chopped onion.  Cooking the mushrooms and onion in broth did not appeal to me – rather, I sweated them in the butter, then added the flour before adding the broth, sherry and cream.  I removed some of the mushrooms, pureed the rest of the soup, then returned the mushrooms I reserved back to the pan.  The end result was a flavorful and enjoyable soup but the necessary adjustments to get it there were fairly significant.

I found this soup to be simple and tasty. I can understand someone adding maybe an extra teaspoon of something but, if you're going to alter and add so many things, it's no longer the soup that the contributor published here. If you're going to alter it, then pay the extra for a membership fee and publish your own version as "customized". The option is available and I feel pretty sure most contributors would probably appreciate that, too.

Just as a few people have said, this soup is fantastic AS IT IS! If you are going to create your own soup then get a membership and submit your own recipe. It doesn't make sense for people to give it any amount of stars after they have changed almost every aspect of the recipe. If you don't like this recipe as it is then give it the according stars it deserves. I made NO changes to Karena's recipe and it turned out perfect. Thanks Karena and happy cooking!

I thought this was an excellent version of a soup I have made probably a thousand times. The only changes I made were to keep half the mushrooms sliced for texture and to add a few kicks of cayenne. Great recipe!

Just made this recipe. Very good. Added a little garlic, used half beef stock/half chicken stock..be cause that's what I had on hand. Only pureed 1/2 of it, because we like it chunky. Came out delish! Thanks for a great recipe.

This is delicious!  I added 1 clove chopped garlic , 1 extra tbsp sherry, and an extra 1 1/2 tbsp butter to the ingredients.  I started out by sauteing the onion and garlic in 1 1/2 tbsp butter until onions were almost clear.  Then, I added 1/2 c. of the broth and the mushrooms, and sauteed them for 5 minutes, then added the rest of the broth and thyme and simmered for 3 minutes more before continuing with the rest of the recipe.  Pureed 3 ladles worth in a food processor, although you do not need to.  Also, I confirmed with other reviews that 2 8oz. containers of mushrooms = 5 cups.  Thank you for this great recipe!

I make this recipe often. Very good recipe. I use mostly white mushrooms, but add in portobellos for a stronger flavor. I do not add the sherry - I'm not a fan of it. The soup still tastes great.
I've tried completely pureeing the veggiesand also having very large pieces of mushrooms, but I find the best is as you suggested - puree leaving some chunks of vegetables in it. I use a hand held wand blender and it works great.
thanks for the terrific recipe!

I have never made  mushroom soup and I  have been  missing out. Who would eat  that can stuff after this ? This recipe alone is delicous, but I  read  some other  recipes and took some  hints to add to this one. I took it up a notch----so I added  minced garlic  2 cloves, nutmeg 1/4 t, a coupleTblsp sour cream and more sherry-- wow- yummy! this recipe  will become a favorite for sure.

Same ingredients, different method, turned out great. Used the required amount of butter to saute the mushrooms and onions in. Added broth. Pureed only half that mixture with required amount of flour plus whole fresh parsley and thyme. Returned to pot with cream, salt, pepper, and only 1 tsp. sherry. Only thing I'd change is to use heavy cream instead of half and half.

Delicious! Has a nice earthy, subtle flavor. Made the following adjustments: used baby portabellas, omitted the thyme, added fresh garlic and sauteed the garlic and onions in a little EVOO before adding broth, and then pureed only 1/2 the mixture to keep it chunky. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a delicious soup, however, it served 3 luncheon size servings - not 6 as indicated. I followed the recipe exactly. Next time I will use less flour and more chicken broth. I used cremini mushrooms and the flavor was great. It is a very good base for experimentation. With a little imagination, it could be many different soups.

Fantastic Soup! I did make a couple of changes. I used beef stock and about 1/2 cup of sherry, 1 tbls is not nearly enough. I also went heavy on the black pepper and added some "Essence" to give a touch of heat.

Simply Awesome!  That is what this recipe is…simple (tasting and to make) and awesome at the same time.  Don’t change a thing and it will be great.  Buy the sherry…there is no substitute and it gives this dish just the right amount of flavor blending.  I tried it with and without the sherry.  The sherry is the cherry on top.  Try letting your guests add a touch upon serving.  Fun!

OH MY GOD!  I think I died and went to heaven!  This is scrumptious...I had to see for myself after reading all the reviews.  With so few ingredients, what an amazing flavor...I didn't have any sherry, but I have some marsala wine...I poured off a cup and put a few drops in, so to compare the flavors...definitely with the wine, but just a few drops...going back into the kitchen for another cup!

This has become my favorit soup so far.  I prefer the mushrooms chopped in large chuncks or sliced.  I have modified this recipe and used with shrimp and also with chicken and poured over noodles for a different kind of stroganoff.

This is super delicious! I've been trying different mushroom soup recipes lately and this one is my current favorite. My only changes were to sauté the onion in a little extra virgin olive oil before I added the mushrooms and broth. I also added a tablespoon of white wine because I don't keep sherry around. I can't wait to eat this! It's a cold, rainy evening and fresh soup is going to hit the spot.

Used dried wild mushrooms that I steeped in hot water.  Then used that water as the base.  Caramelized the onions, then added garlic and thyme. Blended soup until creamy smooth.  Tasted and re-seasoned.  Pan seared some button mushrooms in bacon grease and freshly cracked black pepper.  When browned, I chopped them up to use as a garnish for each bowl.  De-LISH!

Do NOT puree the mixture! I did and it was grainy and lumpy. Next time I will definately leave it whole. Otherwise, the flavour is great!!!!!!

I did this with milk not even half and half and it was wonderful.  I too did use butter with the onions waiting till translucent then adding mushrooms and a little salt. I made a smaller amount to go into a roast.  This taste so much better than store bought.  And btw I also did like others and just did a chop to them as well.  Will definately make again!  I do not even like cream of mushroom soup from can but tried this before pouring into ROAST and OMG ;)

I love soups! I tried this one and found it very delicious as is. At first  I thought the flour mixture was too thick but as others said keep stirring. It didn't get too thick for soup consistency. Very delicious. Oh, I already said that!

This recipe is delicious!!!! I recently sought out a cream of mushroom soup recipe because I dislike buying canned soups. The salt content is too high, and I'm trying to remove BPA products from my kitchen. I came across this recipe and I will never go back to canned cream of mushroom soup.  I made it for another recipe which calls for cream of mushroom soup and I'm surprised any of the soup made it to the crock pot I could not stop eating it. 

I made a few changes. First I doubled the recipe, but only used 1/2 onions. Like other reviewers I sweated the onion and mushroom in butter. I also added garlic. Then I added the flour. Next I added the cream, chicken broth, and sherry, then the seasonings. I also did not puree the mixture at all, because I like it with the large mushrooms and it's one less thing to clean. I pretty used all her ingredients just in a different order. The flavor is amazing. Great base recipe, just needed a few tweaks.

Delicious! Chose to use milk for the sake of time and effort living in a foreign country makes various ingredients more difficult to find, such as half and half. A great addition to my scalloped potatoes and creamy chicken pasta.

wow wow wow... i am extremely pleased with this recipe... of course the first time trying it, i used the reviews as a helper.  I scaled down the recipe to 4 servings, becuase i didn't want to use a can and a half of soup... hate wasting.  I actually didn't have enough fresh mushrooms but i did have some raw cauliflour in the fridge i just added maybe a half cup of that.  I sauteed the onions and mushrooms in just butter first until the onions were translucent. forgot to add salt at that time.. NO BIG DEAL! I added it later. I followed the rest of the steps according to the directions, Didn't have half and half but i had whipping cream! and I used a little chardonay instead of sherry because thats what i had... I'm not complaining on the results... I can't imagine it tasting any better with sherry or half and half.  thanks for the recipe! I only had one bite and I started my review! hahaha I hope it didn't get cold!

This made a delightful soup! I doubled the recipe and used button and baby bella mushrooms. I did saute the mushrooms first and ran half of them through the food processor, other half went right into the soup. Didn't have any sherry so I subbed with Marsala. Mmmmm good!!!!

I loved the flavor!  My only issue was the thickness, so I diluted the soup with another 1.5 cups of chicken broth.  Perfect!

This soup will be on my ‘MAKE OFTEN' list from now on. I had half a Costco-sized box of mushrooms that needed “using up.” We were having beef steaks for dinner, but I wanted to try something different than the usual 'fried-mushroom & onion garnish', so I was out looking for a new recipe. 

This mushroom soup recipe worked up quickly, and tasted great. I didn't have any sherry, so I omitted it without a qualm. I didn't have dried thyme either, but I had an 'Italian blend' that included rosemary, marjoram, and thyme that I substituted in its place. To make a long story short, it WAS popular with everyone (hurray.) Since it has a pretty bland base, I’ll work up some variations that should make some of the ‘less popular’ vegetables palatable with younger eaters.

I wouldn’t want to put something on my ‘Do Often’ list if it wasn’t popular with everyone eating at my table. Thanks for the recipe. It WILL be visiting our table regularly. I hope it does yours.

I made this soup for my husband's birthday party yesterday. It was so easy and delicious, and the guests literally devoured it! It was a huge hit! My mixer couldn't quite get the mushrooms to a creamy consistency, so additionally used an electric hand chopper while the soup cooked in the pot, still not completely 'creamy', but it went over well with the guests anyway! I didn't have thyme, and in the end it didn't seem to be missed. I added a tad more sherry and cream than called for. Also used all varieties of mushrooms. Will definitely use this recipe again!!

What a fantastic soup! I was cooking it for our main meal, so I doubled the recipe. I used ½ cup of milk and ½ cup of heavy cream because that’s what I had on hand. I sautéed the mushrooms, garlic, and onion then added the broth. I used thyme, Italian seasoning, and basil. Didn’t have quite as much mushrooms as it called for, but it was fine, and I didn’t use the sherry. Next time, I’ll leave out about 1/3 of the mixture before I put in the blender, it wasn’t as chunky as I would’ve liked. It is an “ugly” soup, but you forget all about what it looks like as soon as you taste it! Excellent recipe…thanks Karena, it’s a family favorite for us now!

This was good but next time I'll leave most of the mushrooms sliced not chopped. I'd rather have large pieces. Had a very good flavor though.

Delicious and very easy! For the most part, I made as is. I sauteed mushrooms and onions in butter before adding broth to bring out the flavour of the veggies. I also didn't puree as I love big, delicious chunks of mushroom. I didn't have any sherry so I omitted but I will try this way in the future or maybe with some white wine. I will definitely be making this again! Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this yesterday, used portebella mushrooms, didn't have enough so I added a can of mushrooms drained. Used 1/2 C. cream, and 1/2 C. half & Half. Only pureed 1/2 of mixture.  
It was SO GOOD.  I had to hurry & freeze some before my husband ate it all.
I used to get cr. of mushroom soup in Pennsyvania at a tavern that was known for their soup.  Since I've moved never ate it again until yesterday, brought back fond memories.  Will keep this recipe handy, and make again....

I halved this recipe using 8oz minibella mushrooms, no butter, all three T of flour and no sherry.  I was adding it to a casserole rather than the boughten kind.  It tasted great.   highly recommended.

This soup was soooo good.  My hubby and I both loved it.  I just made it a night ago and have plans to make it again, doubling the recipe.  It is tasty and thick.  The perfect amount of flavor.  Much better than anything I have found in a restaurant.

What a great recipe, I made this to use in a stroganoff recipe and I was impressed how good it was on its own. What a great alternative to the canned stuff. All I had was an 8oz pack of mushrooms, I didn't puree the veggies, I used whole milk and I didn't have Sherry.

Recipe was great! I was short on time, so I subbed in 1 can of mushroom stems & pieces for the fresh ones. I also added some cooked bacon slices to the soup to add a smokey flavor. Highly reccomend this recipe!

I love this soup. It is better than anything you could get from a can. I sauteed the mushrooms with the butter, flour, and onions. Like one user said, I would leave out the sherry, I tasted it before adding that ingredient and it was much better without it.

Didn't really care for this. During cooking, you can't really taste the thyme, but it is overpowering once cooled.

I was underwhelmed by this recipe when made as-written.  Flavor was OK, but was missing something, no depth, very one-dimensional.  I was able to turn it into 5 stars by adding a cup of white wine, more seasoning, and a little dash of red pepper flakes for flavor.  I will continue my search for the to-die-for mushroom soup recipe, this was not it.

I used portobello mushrooms for this. I also did it with 1% milk instead of half and half. I did it a slightly easier way in that I thickened the flour/butter/milk in a separate pot from the main one then put them together and used an immersion blender. This was pretty good, I would make it again, very easy. I upped the sherry content too :)

Wow!! Superb recipe! Easy peasy!

I used white button mushrooms and swiss brown mushrooms. 

I saute the onions, garlic and mushroom before adding the broth.  I think this helps the mushroom to tenderize easier and emits it's lovely aroma.  I followed the rest except for the flour which i cut down to 2T.  I didn't have sherry on hand nor any other subsititue eg wine. It tastes so good..just like how fancy restaurants cook theirs.

This was a very good cream of mushroom soup.  I made this using an 8 oz. package of sliced button mushrooms along with a 4 oz. combination package that included a mix of baby bella, shitake and oyster mushrooms.  Although the recipe didn’t instruct you to cover the mushrooms while simmering, I did, because I didn’t want all of my broth to evaporate.  The sherry in this is a must!  In fact I might increase the amount a bit next time.  I disagree that this will yield 6 servings - mine only yielded about 4-5 cups, probably 4 modest servings.  Another small negative for me is the color.  Mine was a very unappealing grey!  But, if you can get past the color, this is a very flavorful soup!

I halved the recipe because only one person would be eating it.  One 8 ounce package of button mushrooms ended up being 2 1/2 cups of sliced.  I also used beef broth because it is what I had open.  It makes a beautiful soup and DH says it is delicious.

This is very simple and tasty. I substituted vegetarian base for the chicken and added an extra cup of whole milk. I only only pureed the mushroom onion mixture lightly so it still had some chunks of veggies in it. It's definitely a keeper!

I made it a little differently.. I cooked the onion and mushroom in 1/2 cup of chicken stock, used another 1/2 cup when making the puree, and stirred in a heaping tbs of cornstarch into the last 1/2 cup when doing step 3.  No need for butter/oil or making a roux.  I used heavy cream instead of half and half (what we had) and I also didn't add the sherry (I didn't have it in the house).   Smelled and tasted devine.

This is so good.  I substituted the 1/2 and 1/2 with organic greek yogurt and added some skim milk to it and it is STILL just as wonderful with the calorie-wise ingredients substituted for the others.  I also doubled the recipe and used 1/2 portabello mushrooms.  It's great left over and it also makes a great green bean casserole.

This was so GOOD!  I am not one to give 5 stars to many things, but this deserved it!  I did what the others suggested and blended half of the mushroom mixture and it was perfect.  The sherry gives it a very nice flavor.  This is my new favorite soup!

Excellent and flavourful. My wife is allergic to Thyme so left that out and I don't have sherry. It all tasted great still and both of my sisters want the recipe now. Used 2% milk instead and it was still fantastic...this one is a keeper...thank you so much.

Made this tonight for dinner and it was delicious! I'm rating this a 5 stars even though I tweaked it ever so slightly - I'm sure followed as is would also be just as delicious. I cooked my onion in a little oil and butter and then added some Shitake mushrooms for a bolder flavor (1 pack). I'm a vegetarian so I used vegetable stock (about 3 cups). I love mushrooms and since it was a cold night I wanted to make a lot. I bought 2 large packs of white mushrooms and threw those in once the Shitake mushrooms cooked a little (about 5-10mins). I quadrupled the Thyme and tripled the sherry since I was making more, but everything else stayed the same. My 9yr old had a big bowl of it and my husband commented multiple times on how delicious it was. I served it with warm, crusty french bread and what a fabulous meal on a cold night. Thank you so much for a wonderful, quick and easy meal. Definitely a keeper!!!! Really looking forward to another huge bowl tomorrow night...

This soup was OUTSTANDING! It was perfectly seasoned, when I followed the recipe exactly as written. We omitted the sherry because we are a no-alcohol household and it turned out superb! I made this 3 days ago, and will make it again tomorrow because it was THAT good. Thanks so much!

This was delicious!  Like other reviewers, I only pureed half of the mixture and was happy with that result.  Next time I will add a bit more chicken broth (about 2 cups).  It was just a bit thicker than I like.

I thought it was too mushroomy, and not soupy enough for me.  I probably wont make this again, but if I do I will double everything but the shrooms, and flour.  But thank you karena for sharing your recipe.

What a fantastic recipe! I have never tasted anything so good.. My only changes are that I saute the onions, mushrooms and thyme together for about 5-7 minutes before adding the stock. I then allow it to come to a boil, then puree in my blender (I puree the whole pot but only slightly! So it is still chunky). Otherwise I keep the recipe the same down the line and it turns out great everytime!

Very tasty!!  Mushrooms & onions were sauteed about 15 min; no processing; oregano instead of thyme (don't like it); + 1/2 c broth; + some milk (I found the recipe VERY rich, but I had simmered it down quite a bit) -- it's a keeper for me!

I didn't have enough fresh mushrooms, so I added some canned ones. I also used 1% milk instead of half and half. It was still terrific, even with the lesser ingredients. Like others, I skipped pureeing the mixture, as I like the whole pieces. Super easy and delicious. Will definitely make again!

The best cream of mushroom soup I have ever tried. Everybody just loved it. I cooked the onions with garlic before adding the mushroom and the chicken broth. At the end instead of the sherry, I added a splash of white wine and it was really amazing. I will always make this recipe and I will never buy again cream of mushroom in cans.

OMG! this ws sooooo good! I didn't have thyme and used milk. It was still perfect. I needed this soup for the green been casserole that I wanted to make. I almost change my mind about the casserole to have just the soup. Yes, it was THAT good.

Loved it!  LIke many others though, I ended up putting it through my food processor and wished that I hadn't.  I think maybe I should've just done half that left the rest of the mushrooms just diced small by hand.  All in all...fantastic!

Made this several times, have always wanted a good cream of mushroom soup.  I think 5 cups of mushrooms is hard to follow, just use one package.  Best part is, you can adjust the consistency to your taste.

This was a fabulous find!  Great way to use up mushrooms & so rich and flavorful.  I even cut the butter by one tblspn and substituted about 1/3 cup of 1% milk for half & half.

Yum!  Followed everyone's advice...pureed half the mushrooms, chunked the rest. Added garlic and sauteed in butter instread of broth.  It is an ugly soup, but one I will make again and again.

I have made this several times and it was a hit!  The flavor is fantastic! Instead of sherry I use red wine and quite a bit more.  I think wine adds wonderful flavor to most recipes.  One of the best soups I have ever had!

Absolutely FANTASTIC!  I am a huge mushroom fan, and this was just SO good.  I left some fairly large chunks in this, along with the pureed portion, and I really prefer it that way.  This recipe reminded me of a Mushroom Bisque that I ate at a five-star restaurant in southern California.  DH was VERY impressed.

This is an quick, yet delicious soup.  My husband loved it!
I used portebello mushrooms mixed with button mushrooms and it gave it a great flavor.  I also added a little garlic (I put garlic in just about everything).  This one's going in my recipe box.

Very easy recipe to make and good. If you want to prepare it ahead of time. Make the soup up to the point of adding the cream. Just before serving add the cream and sherry.

I made the recipe as is except used 2% milk. I used a few varieties of mushrooms, just because they were 1/2 price.  This is a delicious soup.  I will be my ‘go to’ mushroom soup.

This was very good- I had some mushrooms to use up (baby Bella's) and this was perfect. I added a bit more salt and pepper but otherwise, pretty much stuck with the recipe. I will make this again, maybe using a variety of 'shrooms and a hearty red wine instead of the sherry to give it a little more depth.  I have an immersion blender (don't use it often but when I do, I fall in love with it all over again!) and kept a few chopped mushrooms aside, blended the hot soup, and then added the reserved chopped mushrooms back to the pot.

I have made this recipe as is and absolutely love it. This is the second time I have made it and I doubled the recipe because my friend tried my last batch and loved it so much she wanted a portion! I usually make this for my lunch for the week! Pureeing the mushrooms is a little time consuming but well worth it since it makes the soup so creamy and thick. A staple in my regular recipe rotation just as good if not better than any mushroom soup at a restaurant.

This is delicious!!!!!!  I used smart balance spread in place of butter because I'm watching my cholesterol.  I went strictly by the directions and I used baby bellas.  I added some white pepper at the end because I like a little heat in my food and it was just the perfect addition.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Really good simple recipe that I have made several times.  I've made it exactly as directed, but have also substituted skim milk or whipping cream for the half and half.  I've even omitted the sherry or substituted white wine.   It still turns out great.  I no longer buy canned mushroom soup.  Thank you for sharing!

Delicious! SO much better than the canned stuff. I will make this again really soon, but will double so MAYBE I'll have some leftovers this time. Also I used homemade chicken broth and to save on calories I used 2% milk instead of half-and-half.

Perfect.  I only had heavy cream on hand, so I used it in lieu of the half and half.  I will never ever use canned mushroom soup in a recipe again.  I'm going to make some and freeze it so that I have it on hand when needed.

A very good and simple recipe. I usually make it vegan by substituting soy butter, almond milk, and vegetable broth. It is quite delicious. I have also made the original version for non-vegan people, and they loved it. When I do the vegan version I add the almond milk to the roux and cook it until nice and thick before adding everything else. Otherwise the soup will not be thick enough.

Thanks, Karena, for a great soup recipe.  I liked it enough to rate 5 stars but ended up making tweaks.  To avoid being admonished, I made the recipe as close as possible to as written as I could except I made the roux in a separate pan and added it just before the 21% fat cream (half and half is not very common in Germany).  The result was nice, and WAY better than any canned stuff you get off the shelf.   This recipe was easy, not too time consuming and was genuine, not processed.   BTW: Cooking the onions and mushrooms in the broth makes it easier to multitask in the kitchen, helpful when cooking a full meal or preparing for guests.  Sauteing may be a good option but requires more oversight.  

However good the baseline soup was, I had to tweak from there to put my personality into it.  I doubled the salt, pepper, sherry, and thyme, then added a pinch of cayenne and one tsp of garlic powder, but that wasn't quite enough for my palate.  I then added one tsp of Maggi seasoning (European soy sauce, available at most large supermarkets) and that took the soup over the top.  If I would have thought about the Maggi sooner, I would not have added the second tsp of salt, though, as it made it a bit salty.

All I can say is "wow!"  This recipe was so simple yet full of flavor.  My only substitution was using vegetable broth rather than chicken.  Also, omitted the sherry as I didn't have any on hand.  May add a splash of white wine next go 'round.  My husband RAVED about it, and that has never happened before.  Mmmmmmm!

I wanted to try this after having the one at La Madeleine. It was very good, but too thick. I added more half and half and butter. I'm sure I could have done that with stock, I will try that next time. The soup is great with crusty bread.  I used baby bella and button mushrooms so I could get more depth to the flavor.  I am a big meat eater, but found this soup very satisfying. I will make this again.

This soup has great flavor, I loved it!  I sauteed the mushrooms and onions in the butter, then added the flour and stirred until it absorbed the butter, then added the other ingredients (I used heavy cream because I like a creamier soup, and omitted the sherry because I don't like it) then just added some garlic salt to taste.  Different method than the recipe, but it worked great and the soup was ready to eat in 15 minutes from start to finish.

This was absolutely amazing with only a few minor changes.  We sauteed the onions and mushrooms with a touch of butter before we added the broth and fresh thyme. We did not blend completely as it tastes better chunky. We used half heavy cream and half & half. At the end we thought something was missing, so we added some garlic powder to taste.  I bet it would have been equally tasty if you add fresh garlic when you saute mushroom and onions.  Also we didn't have Sherry so we used Madeira.  I think if the recipe called for garlic originally this would have been a five star! a couple more things this made about 3 1/2 cups of soup so double it up and use some for a green bean casserole! We used baby bella mushrooms once sliced we used about 12oz which was a about a 1 1/2 pkgs (8oz whole baby bella). Hope that helps!

I MADE THIS  TODAY BECAUSE I HAD AN EXCESS SUPPLY OF MUSHROOMS ON HAND, WHITE, BABY BELLA AND SHITAKE. I USED ALL THREE. THE SOUP WAS WONDERFUL, HOWEVER THE RECIPE ONLY MADE 3 SIDE SERVINGS, FOR A SOUP AND SANDWICH MEAL. WILL ABSOLUTELY MAKE AGAIN, BUT MAYBE DOUBLE THE RECIPE FOR LEFTOVERS!

Not enough broth in this soup... it comes out looking unappealing, more like a mushroom smoothie than a soup. It tastes "okay", but would not bother to make it again.

I will never buy canned mushroom soup again!  This only took a few minutes to prepare and is so much better than canned.  I would give this 10 stars if I could.  The sherry is a must!  I tasted before the sherry and after, after was much richer.

I followed the recipe almost exactly. The only changes I made was I sauteed the mushrooms and onions in butter first and only pureed about two-thirds of them. I also cooked the butter and flour a bit (basic roux) My wife and I thought the flavor and texture was excellent. I used a good Amontillado sherry and next time I might add a little bit more, it really adds depth to the flavor.

This turned out fabulous!  We needed a mushroom soup base for a slow cooker venison recipe and I snuck a taste before I sent it to the crock pot.  Yum!

On a side note people...  Don't listen to the rants of other reviewers who change the recipe around.  It's self serving an quite childish. I only pay attention to those that follow the recipe and rate it accordingly.

I use pre packaged, sliced muschrooms to save time.  Tastes just like the mushroom soup at La Madeleine in Dallas.  Love it.   And very friendly for my low carb lifestyle!

I just finished making this soup and I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was.  Following the advice of some of the other reviewers, I pureed about 3/4 of it, which was a mistake in my opinion.  I think next time I'll leave everything as is.  Otherwise, fabulous soup with a fabulous flavor.

I plan on trying this.  But also wondering, have you ever canned it ... as in a pressure cooker?  I can my own mushrooms (the white ones from the store).  They taste sooo much better than the ones in the cans at the store & these are grown here in USA.  Thanks for you r recipe & help.

Very good base recipe.  I added in criminis and porcinis for a darker, earthier flavor.  Plus I always use half beef base and half chicken base when making mushroom soup.

Outstanding recipe - all i used was white wine instead of sherry and a little garlic to change the recipe. My only complaint is that one serving is about a cup, which wasn't enough for us vegetarians. If this is your main course, you will want to double up.

Cream of Mushroom soup is one of my favorite "comfort food," and this recipe hit the spot! The only thing I did differently was use beef broth instead of chicken broth.  This is a very tasty and filling soup.  Yummy!

Very, Very good soup!  I did saute the onions and mushrooms with the thyme in a little bit of butter as I thought they were a little tough the first time I made this. I also used whole milk instead of half and half and it turned out wonderfully. The second time I made a double batch as we could not stop eating it!

I accidentally forgot to buy chicken stock so I used the only thing I had, Cream of Broccoli Soup. It was delicious. I added about 1/4 cup more water to the Cream of Broccoli and about a half cup more cream to the final product for my soup as well as bacon. It was AMAZING! I can't wait to try this recipe properly :p

Guests were stunned and the compliments flowed...  Don't be afraid to throw in extra mushrooms--or to vary the variety.  I added some leftover portabellos (~2C) to traditional white button mushrooms.  Put the cooked mushrooms through my food processor and left little bits and some small slices.  Perfect. This is a fantastic soup that lets the flavor of the mushrooms shine.  Thanks for the recipe, Karena!  Oh, almost forgot my only change:  used vegetable stock to make it vegetarian.

This recipe doesn't need tweaking. Add a clove of garlic if you must  and use wine (either white or red) if you don't have sherry in the house. But really it is pretty good as written!

This soup was 1st rate.  However I did switch it up from the recipe.  I used 5 cups mushroom's but I like a more liquified soup so I doubled all the other ingredients.  Also I like chunks of mushrooms but no pieces of onion so cooked the onions seperate, then when blending time came I blended about 1/3 of the mushrooms with all onions and returned to pot to simmer.  It was really very good, thank you for the recipe!  I will be making again.

This was phenominal!  Since I'm on a low carb diet I omitted the flour.  Instead I sauteed the mushrooms and onion in the butter until softened.  I then added the spices, chicken stock and half n half.  After the soup was cooked through I added 2 TBS of a dry white wine since I didn't have any sherry.  I used my immersion blended and blended up all the big chunks, this left the soup a nice thick consistancy.  Yum!!!!!

I was actually looking for variations of my own soup - this is a good recipe.  A couple of thoughts, for better or worse:  I start with sofrito/mirepoix - onion, carrot, celery, which gives MUCH more flavor, and then use broth, too.  A TV recipe roasted the shrooms first, which I don't do but it looked good.  I put a handful of (rehydrated) dried porcinis in, which gives it a real kick and depth.  And I NEVER use flour in soups - as one said here, "It's just like Campbell's!"  I reduce the soup to get a natural thickening, plus it concentrates the flavors.  Chunky  or no is a matter of taste, and this is good with or without cream, too.  Make sure it has enough salt, it's the secret to a great soup, in general..  Good stuff.

I made this because I didn't want to use canned soup for my greenbean cassorole. It is FABULOUS! I did make a couple of changes just based on my experiences cooking:  I used heavy cream instead of half & half Omitted the flour Omitted the sherry  Pureed the mushroom mixture right in the pot with a stick mixer Added the butter, cream, and spices directly to that pot and simmered for 5 minutes.  My greenbean cassorole will never be the same!  THANK YOU!!!!!

This is by far the best soup I've ever made!  I must have made this 15 or 20 times so far for dinner parties and even just for lunch and it's always a huge hit. I sometimes change it up a bit, 1/2 baby bellas and 1/2 cremini mushrooms, I double the fat-free 1/2 & 1/2, and then puree the entire mixture for an incredibly rich and tasty treat.

This is the best cream of mushroom soup I've ever had.  I've made it several times and it always turns out amazing!  I've also frozen it to use in other recipes instead of canned soup.  I can't imagine ever using canned soup again!

Ohmygoodness-this soup is so good! We love this in our house. We get mushrooms at the end of the day from our local grocer when they clearance them and make a huge pot of it. My kids even love it. I try to make this at least every other week-whenever I can get a good deal on mushrooms. I have used all kinds of mushrooms-oyster, portabellas, baby bellas, shitaake, and regular old button mushrooms and it always turns out great. I do make it with fat-free half and half to make it healthier and it is still delish! I have made it with the cream as well and I can really hardly tell a difference. I don't put any of the soup through the blender-too much of a mess for me and I just chop the mushrooms fine enough for our tastes anyway. I also used cooking sherry-because it is just what I have on hand. When I run out of that I will buy some good stuff and I am sure it will be even better. I also freeze the leftovers in 1 quart baggies and use them when a recipe calls for cream of mushroom. Delish!

great recipe! i did sauté the onions first as others suggested and pureed all the mushrooms, some were saying only do half, but it just depends on what texture you would prefer, it's not going to change the taste. but overall EXCELLENT! next time i am going to add in some different kinds of mushrooms!

This soup is phenomenal! My husband doesn't even like mushroom soup and he scarfs this up.  I changed it a bit, too.
I use 1/4 tsp Thyme and about 1/4 tsp Marsala.  In the blender I use the "chop" cycle just briefly...it leaves nice chunks of mushrooms.

This recipe was great! Just what we needed after a long rainy weekend.

We did a few things differently- my husband suggested adding potatoes, which was a great idea because it made it a much more hearty soup. We used 4 potatoes, chopped, and added them when we put the mushrooms and onions in.

We only pureed half of the veggies and set the other half aside to put back in later.

We didn't have any sherry on hand so I used a little bit of cider vinegar, which I thought tasted good.

After the changes I gave it 5 stars but my husband says 4.5...I told him that he would have liked it more if he put the cider vinegar in his bowl! (He didn't want any so we added it separately).

I love this recipe. I have been so enamored with fresh mushroom soup in general that I have been making it once a week just for myself. I have tried several other recipes and this is the one I prefer. The choice of blender use is personal. Personally I prefer some good size chuncks in my soup of mushrooms so I keep some of the soup out when I put the rest through the blender. All and all a wonderful soup for any occassion.

Very good and super easy to make.  I actually made 2 batches of this.  The first one I followed exactly and found it too mushroomy for my liking so the 2nd batch I added much more 1% milk and chicken stock and about 1/2 the mushrooms.  Then I mixed them together and enjoyed it much more.  My coworkers loved it!

I made this soup last night just as a cold spell hit Illinois.  I must say it was surprisingly tasty.  I agree with others that you might want to wait and add the seasonings to taste.  Mine came out a bit peppery even with only 1/4 tsp. pepper.

I prepared as written, I thought it tasted great and was so easy to make.  Yes, it is extremely thick, next time I'll skip the half and half and use milk instead.

I'm not one for liking soup, but I really ended up liking this (and so did my husband).

I fried the onions in a bit of olive oil to start, and then added the broth (I used part chicken broth, part vegetable broth) in. I didn't puree anything at all, just chopped the mushrooms up, nice and big, as I like texture! 

I used half and half as well.

Really great flavour, and definitely better then anything from a can.

So many recipes I use require a can of cream of mushroom soup and I am trying to watch our sodium intake so I decieded to make my own.  I'm so glad I did, this turned out great.  I'm not a soup eater, but my boyfriend ate a bowl and loved it. I used the rest in the tipsy chicken recipe from this site and it was wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is my first review on All Recipes. I get lazy, and I never bother to review. But this? Absolutely worth reviewing for!
I substituted milk for the half-and-half, and I didn't add sherry. INCREDIBLY AWESOME! I definitely will make this again and again!

Great basic recipe.  Some changes I made: sauteed onion, 6cups of mushroom (half white button and half shitake), and 1 minced garlic in butter before cooking in chicken broth.  Pureed 2/3 of veggies, saving 1/3 to give soup some texture later.  I added one can of chicken broth to the flour and butter mixture and cooked mixture on medium heat until it boiled.  Then added the pureed and whole veggies, salt and pepper, 1cup of heavy cream, and about 1/4 cup of sherry (since I increased the chicken broth).  Yum!

This was very easy and very tastey!  Do be careful when blending hot liquid.  I had a nice mushroom shower when the heat made the top pop off.  I was using the vent to keep it from building up pressure but I looked away at the tv and the top sealed up and POP.  So be careful.  Very creamy and yummy recipe.

I thought this recipe was good, but it needed more flavor.  I plan to try it again because it was a pretty good base recipe, but I plan to add more onion and thyme, and I plan to sautee the mushrooms and onions in a little butter before I add the chicken stock.

I only had 4 cups of fresh mushrooms, so I used 2 - 4 oz. cans of mushrooms to make that which was called for in the recipe.  This is easy to prepare and comes together quickly.  The volume of this recipe is quite small; families beware.  If it makes six servings, those servings must be very, very small!  This recipe conveniently serves two, but not much more than that.  The sherry is a crucial ingredient, lending a mysterious edge to the soup.  I did use 1% milk, because it's what I had available.  Next time, I will use half and half or cream; no doubt, that will "kick it up a notch."  I did feel the need to add a few dashes of salt, upon completion.

My husband rated this (as I'm not a fan of mushrooms) after eating more than half of the soup, so I know it's good.  I cut down on the butter and flour by a tbs each, used f/f half & half and it was still thick and creamy.  I had some wild rice leftover from the previous night's dinner, so I added about 1/2C.  I know I'll make this again and again.  A big thanks from my husband!

We just became vegetarian and I promised DH that I would still make satisfying, tasty food. I made this for supper and it was excellent. Instead of chicken broth, I substituted 2 cans of vegetable broth. I used 1% milk rather than 1/2&1/2 to save on calories. Also, I used 1 package of oyster mushrooms and 1 package of button mushrooms. It is so yummy, just perfect. When I told DH what I was making for supper, he said he'd just eat a sandwich. But after smelling it, he couldn't resist and had a bowl. He's eating the third bowl as I type and says it's a keeper. Thanks a million!

This is absolutely delicious! Loved it! And it's so easy to make, just can't belive something so simple can be so good. I omitted the sherry and used milk, because I didn't have half & half on hand and it was just great.

Mine came out very thick. To remedy this I added more half and half, probably at least another cup. I only used 8 ounces of portabello mushrooms and that was plenty for my taste, actually more than I like. I like creamy but thin soup. If I make it again I will use less mushrooms and more chicken broth.

Awesome flavor!  I'm only giving it three stars because it was way too thick, like gravy.  I added an extra cup of milk to it and still could have used more.

Absolutely Wonderful!!! This was great, My husband raved. Just as good, if not better than quality restaurant soup. I left it chunky like other posts mentioned. Not that appealing to the eye but definetly to the palate. Thank You!!

I have made this recipe a few times now. The first time I made it as the recipe says except I sauteed the mushrooms with the onions as some people suggested and it was excellent. The next couple times though I wanted to make more of a meal out of it. I added some diced turkey breast and a pouch of the Uncle Ben's premade wild rice. WOW! Better than anything I've ever had in a restaurant.

This recipe is great, my finicky wife (who peels fat off of bacon) absoultly loved it. I didn't have any sherry, however I did find a bottle so I cooked it with this, however none of the wine actually made into the soup.

Excellent! Made according to recipe but reserved about 1/2 the mushrooms to add after processing. Thanks for sharing! I will make this one again!

Very tasty, simple mushroom soup recipe. I followed some of the suggestions in other reviews - I did not puree the mushroom mixture. I left the mushrooms and broth in the pan, melted the butter in the microwave, whisked in the flour, and added the butter-flour mixture to the soup pot. I used fat-free half-and-half and the texture was very rich and creamy. I thought the sherry taste was a little strong, next time I will only use half a tablespoon. As indicated in the other recipes, I only ended up with two good-sized bowls of soup, nowhere near the six servings indicated in the recipe.

This recipe gives a flavorful and sustaining Cream of Mushroom soup. It would be perfect, except for a few minor annoyances. First, I needed to add an extra half cup of chicken broth to bring the liquid to approximately 3 bowls worth of soup. There were no leftovers. Second,  I'd recommend puree-ing the mushroom/onion/broth mixture in a blender rather than a food processor, as it smoothes out the texture of the liquid.

Made this last night, and I wish that I would have read more of the reviews that said to double the recipe.  This is an awesome soup.  Thick, rich and delicious.  I made it exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing.

I wish I could give this more than 5 stars! I used a combination of portobellos, white button and dried shitake mushrooms (and added the soaking liquid).  I puréed about half the mixture with a hand held blender.  It was SO delicious! Never again will I used canned.  Thank goodness I doubled the recipe! Wonderful!

Very simple and very tasty. Finely chopping the mushrooms worked fine, as well as mixing varieties. Also works great with lamb stock.

I cut this recipe in half, and it was just enough for my husband and I.  I used milk instead of half & half, and it was still very good.  I'll make this one again.

This recipe is fabulous. I used the food processor to do the slicing of the mushrooms so they would be paper thin.  I did not puree any of the mushroom/onion mixture as recommended by another reviewer and was very happy with the results. My family loved this soup!  This recipe is a definite keeper. Thank you Karena!

Simple and delicious! I was never a big  Cream of Mushroom soup fan until recently. A friend ordered some when we were out to lunch one day, and it was surprisingly good. So, I gave this recipe a try. It's simple and delicious. I will make it again.

The only change is I didn’t purée the mushroom mixture.  Hubby wanted a bunch of mushrooms in the soup so I just set the whole mixture to the side when making the cream part.  I used the liquid from the mixture and added to the butter, flour, half and half....came out delicious with a bunch of mushrooms in the soup.

My son and I loved this! I read reviews and used double broth and thyme. I also added 2 cloves of garlic and sautéed the onion and mushrooms in a tablespoon of butter along with the garlic. So tasty.

I prepared exactly as written with one small change.  My wife is a vegetarian (she will eat dairy though) so I swapped out the chicken stock and used low salt veggie broth.  It was absolutely delicious!  Only problem with this recipe is there's not enough leftovers.  It all goes in one meal.  Next time I'll double or even triple the recipe.

Great rainy day soup!  I stuck to the directions but browned the onions separately for more flavor and added a some dried porcini mushrooms.  We had leftover barley so I put it out as an option to add to the soup.  With leftover garlic bread, this soup is a filling meal!  I will be making this again.

I don't like mushrooms. You might be wondering why I would make this then. Well, more than hating mushrooms, I hate wasting food, and the boyfriend wanted mushrooms for his steak last week and I had all of these mushrooms left over...so what did I have to lose?  This soup is GOOD. Try it, even if you're not a fan. 800+ reviewers were right. This soup was worth my time.

I made it and it turned out excellent. The only difference was that I used my slow cooker. I cooked the mushroom, chicken broth, thyme and onions for an hour on High setting in the slow cooker. I emptied the cooked mushrooms and broth mixture into a bowl. While butter was melting in slow cooker with flour added, I pureed the mushroom-broth mixture. As soon as the butter was melted and the flour was stirred into the melted butter, I added the pureed mushroom mixture, Half & Half, salt and pepper and stirred it all together. I let it to cook on High setting for 2 hours till it was done.

I am giving this soup a five star rating! This is the second time I have made this recipe and it does NOT fail in taste, and consistency! I did NOT alter the recipe at all. It is my feeling that if and when a chef begins to "tweak" a recipe, that's fine! There is nothing wrong with making a dish that suits your individual palate! However, it is unfair to rate the recipe once it has been altered! Folks need to be reminded of that fact!

Okay, so, I had to do substitutions, my husband is a heart patient and everything has to be low sodium. First, since I'm using this recipe for green bean casserole,  I used the water from the "no added sodium" can of green beans instead of chicken broth. I know, canned green beans? Actually, I prefer the consistency to fresh or frozen and I don't have to snap them! Then I added some of the butter into the broth while cooking the mushrooms, then cheated by using dried onions.......lazy. Then, I was lazy again and just used my electric hand blender right in the pot so I didn't have to wash the glass blender. Not transferring all that saves time, too. Then I just added the flour right into the vegetable mixture. Had to substitute 2/3 cup milk and 1/3 cup heavy cream for the half and half.  It was just fine. Then, no Sherry in the house,  so I just used a little Worscestershire sauce, (green bean casserole calls for it and is less sodium than soy sauce) and a couple of teaspoons of apple cider vinegar. Mrs. Dash for the herbs and extra garlic powder, too. I know, so many substitutions, but the measurements and base structure of ingredients in the recipe is there and it came out superbly! I tried it with a little salt to taste and my eyes rolled back into my head! I basically tried to lick the pot clean!! Thank you so much, it's way better than when I made some last month for Thanksgiving.  And it turned out so good, we were blown away. I will never use a can of mushroom soup agai

We made this tonight.  I chopped up the mushrooms and onions pretty small so we wouldn't have to puree them and also didn't put in sherry, because we didn't have any.  We did put some garlic and dried chives in it, because the cook doesn't cook without garlic.  It was yummy.  It looked like a lot before we started cooking, but it cooked way down.  We will be making this again!

Delicious. For the broth, I used beef shanks and simmered them for a few hours with some onions, celery and garlic, then chopped the meat up fine and added it back to the soup, and I also added a little worcestershire sauce because it needed a little brightness.

Made as directed and it was wonderful.  I always have it in restaurants but this was my first time making it.  I did add a little more sherry.  Hubby is not crazy about mushrooms but loved the soup.  Thanks for the recipe.

I make this to save my husband from eating soup from a can, and he likes this much better!  The recipe is great as written, but I do often make changes based on cost and what I have available.  I sometimes use chicken bouillon with water instead of chicken stock, I replace the onion with onion powder, and I use fat free half-and-half or even just milk for the dairy.  I like to add some garlic, and I don't usually puree the mushrooms.

I don't usually change recipe's the first time I try them, but necessity forced me to. Didn't have sherry, used a bit of white wine and used 2% milk. This soup was awesome:)  A keeper for sure. Enjoy.

Really nice and surprisingly quick to pull together. 
I 'accidentally' spilled 1/4 c of sherry in the soup.  Oops/Yum.   It's also great with a bit of garlic and nutmeg. Thank you so much for submitting this recipe.  I will use it again and again.

Will only use can in a pinch now, the can is no comparison to this. This is delicious! If you freeze this flat measured out by 1 cup size, can be consumed later for lunch or used for other dishes, such as with Gravy Baked Pork Chops by jennipoo (can be found in AllRecipes). 

I used homemade chicken broth (found in AllRecipes) which has a lot more flavor than canned. Also, made a half/half substitute with butter and whole milk to make it a little healthier, substitute sherry with white wine since I usually don't have sherry on hand. 

Have made this more than once and still no complaints

I didn't have sherry, but other than that I made no changes. Super good! Wasn't sure how much 5 cups of mushrooms would be, so I just used 8 oz of baby bella mushrooms, and that seemed right.

Made this exactly as stated except I used fat free half and half  as that's what I had on hand, and I used my immersion blender instead of food processor.   Excellent!  I am not a fan of canned cream of mushroom soup but this would make any recipe that calls for it even better!  Thanks for sharing!

I tried this recipe tonight for dinner. My whole family loved it!! I didn't have any sherry so I left it out and it was just fine. To me I thought it was a little in the spicy side...next I would put less pepper. I just don't like spicy things. My husband and son didn't mind the spiciness. It was super good. We are a gluten free family so I used gluten free flour and it came out just fine. This is a must try!! :)

This is my go to recipe. I love the simplicity and ease of preparation.  The only difference I made was to add about 1/4 tsp. of freshly ground nutmeg, just because I like the flavour of it with creamy dishes.  Everything else I left the same.

Great quick and simple tasty recipe. Use sliced portabella mushrooms and unsalted butter. Substitute heavy whipping cream for half-and-half. Skip the blender/food-processor. Beef broth can be substituted for chicken broth (if desired).

I used the ingredients shown, but changed the methods.  To concentrate flavours, I sauteed the onion and sliced mushrooms in a shallow pan with the butter until they were lightly browned (I added one clove minced garlic towards the end).  I transferred the mixture to a soup pot then added the flour and cooked for a couple of minutes.  Whisked in the broth, added thyme, salt and pepper, then brought to a boil.  Added the half and half, then reheated slowly before adding the sherry.  Before serving, I used a stick blender to roughly chop the mushrooms.  I then added some chopped Italian parsley for colour and a bit of texture. If the soup is too thick, a splash of chicken stock would be useful.   It is good to offer salt and a pepper grinder at the table in case anyone wants to correct the seasoning to their taste.  Delicious.

I just made this soup and it is Excellent!  I used Portobello mushrooms and whole milk for the white sauce (which I made in the microwave).  I used an immersion blender and quit before it was all blended. Doubled the recipe and am so glad I did. This will not last long in this house! Thank you so much for this recipe. It is easily the best mushroom soup I have ever eaten.

I have to say, This is the Best Mushroom Soup I've ever had! I couldn't stop eating it. The slight taste of sherry was a nice touch.  I kept the recipe just as it read except, I did use a hand blender(much easier) and I did add a little more half-n-half at the end to make it looser.  I will be making this many times.  ***I just made it again(the next day), so my daughter could try it.  She agrees, about the best soup she's ever had.****made again, but for some reason I had to add extra seasoning and sherry, maybe I had more mushrooms than before.  Still a Great Soup!!!

I have made this soup at least half a dozen times per instructions, and it's always incredibly delicious! Tonight for fewer calories & less fat, I used 1/2 cup regular half & half and 1/2 cup of Trader Joe's fat-free half & half, and I can't tell the difference. I also added five Golden Yukon potatoes to the "finished" soup, after chopping them into soup-sized chunks and boiling them for about ten minutes in a separate pot. The new cream of mushroom and potato soup tastes great!  But Karena's soup is the best I've ever made.

I made this soup a couple of hours ago, and I love it! I used crimini mushrooms and used one medium onion. I will be making this again. So simple to make too.

This recipe is absolutely AMAZING as it is! Of course, if you're concerned about calories, you can substitute half-n-half for regular or skim milk. Otherwise, I would not change a thing about the recipe.

Loved this!!  Super easy and a crowd pleasure.  Made a double batch so I could feed a crowd.  Left out the sherry which did not detract from the taste at all.  Loved the tip to leave some of the mushrooms whole which made it really "meaty" and delicious!

Excellent, I didn't have Sherry, so I just added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. I also didn't have thyme, so I added a clove of garlic instead.

Really yummy!  I altered the recipe a little because I was actually looking for a homemade cream of mushroom gravy for smothered pork chops.  I sautéed the 1/2 onion and 16 ounces of mushrooms with a little EVOO, salt, thyme and pepper.  I puréed the mixture in the food processor for no more than 5 seconds to keep the mushrooms slightly chunky.  I put the mixture back in the pan with the butter and dusted it with the flour plus a little extra and whisked it together.  I added about a cup of whipping cream and about a half a cup of chicken broth until I got the desired consistency.  I didn't have the sherry, but that would have been a nice addition.  I will use this recipe again, adding more mushrooms and I can just keep adding the liquid at the end to make a nice soup.

I didn't want to use canned mushroom soup for a recipe as I was trying to cut the sodium, so I looked up how to make it. I tried this recipe and ended up eating most of it before hand, it was good. I did still use the remainder in the other recipe. It worked great. More trouble but I controled the salt content, I used a broth that was reduced sodium and then I didn't add additional salt as called for in this recipe. Tasted great. I will sometimes make this soup to add to a casserole instead of canned.

The recipe is basically easy to follow... But I would suggest the following adjustments:
- omit the salt if you are using chicken stock as it is salty enough
- increase the amount of mushroom stated
- omit the flour as the purée is thick enough after adding the pure cream (I don't have any half & half)

Great cream of mushroom soup!  I left out the sherry (didn't have any on hand), and it made a very nice, basic soup.  Even my 13-year old daughter loved it.  I'll definitely make this again!

Just made this soup for lunch and loved it.  To cut the fat a little I used half milk and half cream.  It was a little thick, but I added more milk/cream and it was perfect!  Thanks.

this is going to be the only mushroom soup i ever make!  i followed the recipe almost exactly, only because i have whole milk instead of cream, and i used a chianti vinegar because i don't have sherry.  i used a mix of portobellos and cremini mushrooms (yum!), and tossed in a big handful of fresh picked basil leaves near the end.  so easy, i whipped it up on my lunchbreak, and my toddler loves it, too!  thank you!  next time i might add some garlic and green onion to see how that goes :)

This recipe is a KEEPER. I have other cr of mr recipes but this is the winner of them all. I cooked the first 4 ingred. and then took my pampered chef chopper and broke it down. I think the food processor would have made the bits too fine. I did use brown rice flour for a thickener. Tasted great before sherry but after sherry was added--just incredible! Am using this recipe instead of a canned MR required for another recipe.

This recipe is FANTASTIC.  The entire family loved it!  I used fat free half and half (couldn't even tell it was!) and also used a mix of fresh mushrooms (portabella, cremini, etc.).  I took only half of the mushroom mixture and pureed because I wanted to keep some chunks left in the broth.  Also, I didn't have sherry so I substituted a premium brandy instead.  This recipe was terrific - everyone in the family gave it a "5 star" rating.  I'm so excited to use this recipe base again....I'm going to try to make it with zucchini (instead of mushrooms) today! Thanks for sharing.  It's a keeper!  (NOTE: I doubled this recipe.  Very thankful I did.  It didn't last long.  I'd suggest doing the same or even quadrupling it if you want to keep and freeze leftovers for later date and warm up!)

I believe there is a gross error in this recipe. No way does 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth and 1 cup of half & half make 6 servings !!.  I used 32 oz. of chicken broth , increasing the butter to 4 Tbs and 6 Tbs. of flour. With my tweaking, it was delicious.

This is good recipe, few changes added about 1 cup more of chicken broth and 1 tsp more of salt. Everything else the same. Great flavor and texture.

This was a wonderful, easy recipe.  I didn't have half and half so I used 1% milk.  I also added 3 cloves of garlic and eliminated the thyme.  It came out perfect and was very flavorful.

I really like this soup!  I made it almost exactly as is except a few very minor changes.  I doubled it and it made about 8 cups of soup.

This is an incredibly easy recipe and the soup turned out great. I followed the suggestions made by SUHANSEN in the review of the 'most helpful critical review'. I agree with not pureeing the mushrooms. If your mushroom have a lot of dark 'fins' then you soup will turn out ugly. I left mine in very large chunks and used button mushrooms with had very little fin development. I added a little garlic. I'll try again using cornstarch instead of flour.

Ridiculously delicious! I love mushroom so I bypassed the "blender/purée" step. Since I'm not a big sherry fan, I reduced to 1/4 of a teaspoon. I'm hooked!

I really liked this recipe as a base for making mushroom soup. It's basic, so I feel like it leaves room to experiment, which I did!  I made a few modifications: I added more broth, added some of my personal favorite spices, and added some larger chunks of mushrooms. I also cooked the onions in a little bit of pork fat just to add some flavor.Overall this is a very good recipe.

Great simple recipe. Sauteed the mushrooms and onions in garlic butter first, and only sauteed half the mixture for texture. Other than that followed the recipe and it turned out great!

What a great soup. Easy to make and easily modifiable to make any amount of variations. I use the leftovers from this soup to make hamburger stroganoff. I posted the recipe with pictures the last time I made it to give you an idea of how it came out.

Fantastic recipe!  I have also added shallots in with the onions and a little cayenne pepper for a deeper flavor (just a touch gives it a little more hearty finish).

This was excellent.  I made as is and used it for my Thanksgiving day sides, in lieu of the canned soup. It took my dishes from being really good to completely awesome.  I used portabellas, so it wasn't as pretty as the canned stuff, but it was incredible.  I'm not sure about all the comments re: how much work this was, really it didn't take that long to prepare or cook.

Very good. Probably would get 5 stars if I had sherry to add. A bit time consuming (even thought I bought presliced 'shrooms), but worth it. Next time I'd add a little minced garlic for a kick. Didn't make that much; about six cups. I recommend it.

Very good - made "low fat/low sodium" version using regular store bought mushrooms and two portabello's combined with 2 cups low sodium chicken broth and 1 cup fat free half and half (and all remaining ingredients. Put alittle over half in the blender to puree and saved the rest for a chunkier soup. Really turned out good.  Defintely a recipe I would make again.

The taste was great although through fault of my own, the soup came out like mushroom puff.  I over pureed the amount of mushrooms and should have left more off to the side.  I also include several variety of mushrooms and it wasn't necessary because it was all blended together.  I will make again using my lessons learned and will probably add some white pepper. Thanks for the recipe!

This soup was fantastic!  I added some mushroom broth along with the chicken as I only had the white button mushrooms to work with.  And added a bit of milk in addition, to thin it out slightly.  I can't wait to make this again it was so good!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe :)

Made this with crimini mushrooms and it turned out wonderful! The only thing I did differently was added a little more half and half. YUUUMMMMMO!

Great recipe! I was looking for it. I add some cream to it and use 1/2 chicken breast instead of chicken broth.But it was too much,I think 1/4 is enough.

The BEST cream of mushroom soup! Made it for my Thanksgiving green bean casserole. Will never go back to canned. Super easy too. I made it with Silk and Earth Balance (soy butter) because I cannot have dairy and it turned out so yummy. Got rave reviews of my casserole, threw a little crumbled cooked turkey bacon into the casserole and every one said it was the best they had ever had!!

Yummy in my tummy.  Once I'm through with simmering the mushroom/onions, I take about half a cup of the mushrooms out and then use my stick blender on the remaining -- much easier than cleaning up a food processor or regular blender.

Great recipe! Easy to make. I used whipping cream because I did not have half-and-half and it turned out too thick...should have made my own half-and-half by mixing 1/2 cup whipping cream and 1/2 cup milk.

A very good basic recipe that can be tweaked to your liking! I made this for dinner tonight.  I expanded it a bit, made about 6 servings. I sliced half of the mushrooms and chopped the other half, sauteed them in butter with onion and garlic. I did not puree any of it. I used heavy cream instead of half and half and beef broth instead of chicken broth. Thickened it with xanthan gum since I can't eat wheat and am on a low carb diet anyway.  This was delicious! Even my four year old ate some! :D

Used ff half and wheat flour which contributed to a slightly sweet soup.  Next time I will use vegetable broth and a combination of mushrooms instead of all white.  Overall a very tasty soup that we'll have again; I'd rate it at 4.5 stars if I could.

This recipe is just great, especially for beginners like myself! I'm just starting to learn how to cook/bake, and this recipe was really easy to follow. i substituted half-and-half for low fat milk (for a healthier option) and it turned out fabulous anyway! thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.   Used this recipe on father's day and my whole family loved it! (:

Wow. Really amazing. The only minor change I would make is to precook the onion so it's not underdone. Someone said they added cream rather than half and half-totally unnecessary-it's creamy enough as it is!

Loved this! almost a perfect homemade version of Campbells if you dice the mushrooms. I browned diced shallots before adding the mushrooms initially and added chicken chunks for substance and it was a wonderful meal!

This was so good.  I will never buy canned again. To cut back a bit on fat and calories I used half cup fat free half and half and half cup skim milk.

This was really yummy.  I chopped up my mushrooms pretty small  and sauteed my      mushrooms and onions in butter first.  And just to keep it all in one pan I sifted the flour over my mushrooms and mixed very well, making sure to not get any lumps.  I then added the broth and brought to a boil.  I didn't have any half and half so I mixed heavy cream and milk together.  I didn't have sherry on hand so I used some white wine I had.  This was the perfect way to use up some mushrooms I had on the verge of going bad.  Perfect for a cold evening in!

I wasn't sure I would like the mushrooms after they were in the food processor so I kept some out and added them  after I processed most.  It was great!  To get the full 6 servings I had to add more of the broth ,cream and seasonings so next time I will double or triple the recipe right at the beginning.

I just served this at a dinner party, and the guests went wild!  I used 1/2 button mushrooms and 1/2 bella mushrooms.  Topped with a tiny amount of sour cream, and some chopped chives.  Thanks, you made me look like I really know how to cook!

So yummy!!  A bit time consuming but worth the effort.  This was my first time making any cream type of soup and I was very pleased with the result.  I will say it needed a bit more "flavor" more salt or something that seemed to be missing.  Regardless of that I will be making this again and again.  My kids Loved it!  So much better than the store bought soups!!  Thank you for the recipe!

I thought this cream of mushroom soup would be similar to the can version but with more flavor. It sure has more flavor from all the ingredients, but it is less creamy and thick. Blending it helps to make it thicker, but still not so creamy. I may try to add a bit of flour next time to really thicken it. It has good flavor, both hubby and I enjoy it.

This was very good!  The only thing I did differently was add about an extra 1/2 of milk (I like thinner soups) and doubled the sherry.  Very good, and it's one I'll make again and again.  I think it would be equally good if you substituted broccoli for the mushrooms.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Mixed reviews here, it didn't taste as rich as I'm used to with cream of mushroom soup in finer restaurants, but it wasn't bad either. I did finely dice half of the mushrooms and the other half I just chopped and didn't puree because I like texture. I then sauteed the mushrooms and onions in a little butter before simmering in the broth which I think was a great extra step. The recipe said season to taste and since it seemed a little bland, I added freshly ground sea salt, extra thyme, garlic salt and onion powder. I didn't have any sherry (we don't like it) so I stirred in some white wine instead and that added a great depth ot this recipe. I think I'll try some type of mushrooms other than the everyday variety next time, maybe portabello/shitake mix, etc. I'm also planning to try another recipe on this site "Golden State Mushroom Soup" to see if it turns out more to my liking.

Hmmm, tasty. Iv always loved cream of mushroom. I didn't blend all the soup cuz i love chunky stuff. also, its a good idea to maybe add a little sour cream in there to add more texture. I didn't use half-and-half, just milk. it worked fine still!! Thanks again for a non-canned-soup. MMMM.

I am so happy that I found this recipe.  The only thing I did different is saute extra mushrooms with diced garlic in olive oil and added them at the end with Marsala wine..that's what I had on hand (about 5T) I served it the next day and it was fabulous.

This is the best Cream of Mushroom soup I have ever tasted!! Yummmy! I didn't have Sherry so I used Apple Cider Vinegar- I also used a variety of mushrooms and full cream since I didn't have half and half. It was simply delicious. Thank you!

I believe I uttered the words 'ridiculously good' while eating this.  =)  I followed the recipe pretty closely, with the exception of measuring the mushrooms and onions.  Additionally, I wanted mushroom slices in my soup, so I sliced them all and then blended only about half.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Took 2 trys to get this the way I love it - but very much worth the trouble.  Here are changes.  Used 1 Pkg sliced baby bellas (8oz) and 1 pkg sliced white mushrooms (8 oz).  Reserved 1/3 - 1/2 of veg. mix for big mushroom parts in soup.  Did not puree veg. mix.  Pulsed 2-3 times to get a diced look w/dark liquid.  Did not use sherry.  I love the way it came out.  Color is nice, each spoonful is full of sliced and diced mushrooms.  Taste is perfect.  Thank you for your recipe!  Will enjoy for years to come.

Very good! I only had half the amount of mushrooms needed so I subbed shredded green cabbage for the other half. My teenage son really like it as did I. Thanks!

This was very good. I added a couple of cloves of garlic - but I add garlic to nearly everything I make. Other than that, I didn't make any changes. It was easy to make and tasted delicious. I'll be making it again.

I made this today and got a bit of a shock, next time I will use button or closed cup mushrooms as the results though very tasty and a little on the thick side were- gray.. not far off looking like cement! I followed the recipe other than the sherry and don't see how this would make six serving's on my count three or four, next time I will use button mushrooms and add at least another 1.5 cup of stock and also use 1% instead.

Honestly this wasn't my favorite.  I just thought it was very thin and kinda bland.  My husband said he really liked it though, so maybe it was just my taste.  I will keep looking for a new recipe.

This soup is pretty darn good and really easy to make if you don't screw up the blending part. I changed the recipe and added 2 cups of broth and 1/2 cup of red wine instead of the sherry. *Be careful when pureeing the soup, only put 1-2 cups at a time into the blender. I put too much and hit the switch and it blew! Blending hot liquids is different than cold (I think!)

While this was good, I've had better Cream of Mushroom soups. It just lacked a lot of flavor. I might try and spice it up with something else later on.

This was delicious!  I added cooked brown rice at the end and used light cream instead of half and half.  I ended up having to thin it out some with more broth but the taste of this soup is incredible.  I will be adding this to my own cookbook.

This was a very simple, tasty recipe.  I sauteed the mushrooms, onions, and thyme then added vegetable stock instead of chicken broth.  The only suggestion I have is to add the salt to taste at the very end.  Other than that, I can't believe how easy this was.  I'll definitely make this again and freeze for winter. I'll also try to use it as a sauce for pasta.  Yum.....

This was so good, and so easy. It does not make enough for 6 people, maybe 3 or 4. I did not have any sherry, so I just leave it out. I normally make this on Sunday, so I will have it during the week to use in other recipes as well as a bowl for lunch on monday. I have not frozen any yet, just because it is so to make and we eat all of it before I need to freeze any.

This recipe is phenomenal! I followed other suggestions and added onions, then sauteed the onions with the thyme and mushrooms in 1 tsp of butter before adding the vegetable broth.  This recipe was fantastic! I was making it for a romantic dinner with my boyfriend but I couldn't wait for him to get home from work, so i already had a bowl.  The comments are right that the serving size is not a meal size.  But it's perfect for a starter or to accompany with a sandwich.  This will definitely go in my Recipe Box and will be a favorite this fall/winter and whenever I want something quick (it took me a 30 minutes to make, including prep time). Oh, and the sherry is a must! Definitely boosts the taste. Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!

This is a very good and creamy soup.  I didn't have enough of the required amount of fresh mushrooms on hand, so I added a can of sliced mushrooms, which can sometimes make a mushroom soup taste strange.  However, I added 2tbsp. of butter and added a bit more pepper, and the canned mushrooms blended well w/the rest of the soup mixture.  I also used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth b/c I had no chicken broth on hand.  Good recipe, and effortless to make!

This is wonderful ! I have been looking for a replacement for the canned soup because of MSG. If you use this recipe for that reason, make sure you use organic chicken broth, as the regular does contain a high MSG content.
Next time I will chop the mushroom first instead of using a food processor.

This was really good for something so quick and easy. Not as good the second day though. We will never eat canned cream of mushroom soup again!

If I could give this soup 10 stars, I would.  The only thing I changed is that I didn't have sherry, so I substituted marsala wine.  This soup has forever ruined canned cream of mushroom soup (even the gourmet variety)!!!  Thanks for a fabulous dinner!

Excellent ~ easy to make, tastes great. This was my very first effort at making soup and it turned out great. Very happy. Just a little note ~ just the little bit of sherry that the recipe calls for made all the difference to the taste

This was OK but just did not suit our taste for a Cream of Mushroom Soup.  Will try again omit the thyme and sherry adding garlic and serve with a crispy Grilled Cheese made with deli sourdough bread.

This was a great soup.  Didn't add the sherry and didn't put it through the food processor.  Was great just that way.  Actually ended up doubling the recipe to have enough for dinner and leftovers for lunch at work the next day.

The basic flavors are great, but I changed a couple things.  Didn't have thyme, but since I had a huge bunch of mushrooms from the farmer's market I made at least a double batch.  Used chinese rice wine cause that's all I had.  Used heavy cream and a little full-fat half & half.  The cream made a big difference.  The soup didn't get as thick as I wanted, but that's because I used so much veggie broth made with "better than boullion" stock. Used oyster mushrooms that I hydrated in the broth and then chopped.  Didn't puree the other mushrooms because I was afraid they would just float on the top of the soup since I could tell it wasn't going to be super-creamy and thick.  The flavors were great - don't skip the wine.  Next time I will not use so much broth, but I wanted lots of leftovers and could tell the amount called for would barely feed us for dinner.UPDATE 3/11/09: If you are using king or regular oyster mushrooms, I recommend adding some oyster sauce. It adds complexity to a really good soup! I have been making this from this base recipe for about 3 years now. VERY GOOD!

Wonderful recipe and very easy to make! I substituted veggie broth for the chicken broth and the result was wonderful. I especially enjoyed it served over wavy egg noodles. I will make this recipe often!

This soup was excellent! Cream of Mushroom soup has always been a favorite of mine. I'm thrilled that I can now make it from scratch. My family and I enjoyed it so much that, when we ran out, I made another batch a couple of days later!

I've made this soup MANY times, and believe me, it's yummy as it is.  However, I've had to tweak it a bit to make it even better.  First, I use vegetable broth instead of chicken.  My vegetarian friends appreciate this a lot.  Second, I usually use fat free half and half to cut out some of the calories and fat.  I have yet to notice the difference.  Third, I usually take 2T of butter and 1T of olive oil and saute the mushrooms and onion first.  Then I add a couple of cloves of garlic (I'm a huge garlic fan), salt, pepper and the thyme during the last minute, and then add the flour after it that to create a roux.  Since I rarely use cherry, I usually add a 1/4 white or red wine (whichever I had on hand) and the veggie broth.  Once this starts to thicken I add the half and half, and there you have it.  Delicious!

My husband loves my homemade mushroom soup but I wanted to get other ideas to enhance the flavor.So, I hit the jackpot with this one! Do your self a favor, DON'T  omit the sherry even if you have to make a special trip to the store to purchase it. It adds a wonderful flavor to any mushroom dish.

delicious!

Very tasty. We had some fresh from the forest chanterelles and I was tired of just sauteeing them and using as a side dish. I used fat free half and half with no problem! I cooked the onion and mushrooms in the butter and skipped the pureeing step until the end, when I processed half of the soup, which adds nice body and mushroom flavor throughout the soup but doesn't remove all of the mushroom texture. My husband says to leave all the mushrooms whole next time, he didn't like the puree (I admit it looked kind of unappetizing after I blended part of it.)

Incredibly easy and delicious.  I used several types of mushrooms and the results were fabulous!  I did saute the onions in butter to start, (I think) as you should in a recipe like this.  Try this savory soup, you won't be disappointed.

i put the onions, mushrooms and ham (some left over picnic ham) into the blender, then scoop out everything into the pot with butter, stirred for about 5 mins then i put in the broth, the milk and at last the flour (i forgot about it) so i whisk it for a while and viola, my hubby loves it! very easy to make and a very forgiving recipe with missing ingredients (no sherry) and wrong order of cooking!

This is an outstanding recipe.  This is hearty enough for my husband and I to eat as a meal, therefor making 1 batch serve only 2 people. I omit step 2 because we like big mushroom slices.  I use fat free half and half to suit our lighter diet.  This is a wonderful comfort food share with a sick friend or loved one.

This recipe is great! I did made a few changes though. I used low fat evaporated milk and more thyme! And also i added canned chopped mushrooms as well besides the fresh ones. I didnt whisk the flour in. What i did was that i took the flour and added it when the milk is added and boiling and stired the flour in. It was really good! My bf had second helpings and he asked for the recipe! Im not going to give it to him though. It will be something i can use. A ways thru a man's heart is thru his stomach! LOL

Since I can't eat most canned soup because of wheat allergy, I was very happy to find this recipe on this site. I make a bunch then use it in casseroles, etc. It is so much better than canned, the flavor is amazing. The thyme and the wine make it so much more flavorful. I used evaporated milk and whatever cheap wine was in the cabinet instead of cream and sherry, and it worked perfectly.

I tried this soup recipe last night and took everyone's advice to double the recipe. I also didn't puree the mushrooms, just left them whole, and I used fat-free half & half. It was creamy and delicious. My husband and one of my sons loved it. It was very easy to make and I will definitely make it again!

YUMMY!!!!  So good I had to lick the bowl!  :-)  I didn't have chicken stock, so I used a beef bouillon cube with water, and I liked the flavor.  I made a double batch and simmered the mushrooms in a dutch oven so I could use a hand-held stick blender--much easier to clean than a blender or processor.

This soup was the best I've ever made.  It tasted great.  I used sliced mushrooms right from the grocery store and did not puree them. I didn't have thyme so I didn't use any.  Also used cornstarch instead of flour as thickening agent. My husband and I loved it!!!  Will make again and again.

My husband and I had homemade cream of mushroom soup at a local restaurant that was delicious.  This recipe is sooooo delicious too and tasted just like it.  Easy to make.  A real keeper.  I doubled the chicken broth and used 1-1/2 cups of half and half.  I will definitely make this again and again.

Excellent flavour in this soup.  I used half portabellini mushrooms and half white mushrooms and turned out wonderful.  I left it quite chuncky.  I'm planning to use the leftovers as a sauce for a pasta dish.  Very good!

This is a very tasty version of mushroom soup.  Next time though, I would not put the cooked mushrooms in a food processor.  Texture of the soup would be much better with just sliced mushrooms.

This is the best mushroom soup.  I used "everyday"
mushrooms last night, tonight, I think I'll try it
with some portobello mushrooms.  Very good.
I don't have kids, so I didn't "kid rate it".

It really is quick, easy and creamy, with
ingredients readily on hand.
I only rated one card for kid-friendly
because my son does not like mushrooms
and wouldnt try it.

I have made this soup 4 times, after the 1st time, I doubled the recipe. In my opinion (and based on consumption in my home) this recipe only makes 3 servings.  This is delicious EXACTLY as directed.  No changes necessary.

I added a few dried wild mushrooms to the chicken broth and simmered them for 15 minutes.  1 also used 1/4 cup heavy cream with 1/4 cup half and half.  I prefer a little more sherry but the soup/bisque was very good!

I followed the recipe except for one very minor tweak - I pureed only 1/2 of the vegetable soup. I left the rest intact for some dimension. I will say that the end product needed another flavor level. It was very earthy and stark. Next time I would add twice the sherry and a bit more salt. I think I might even prefer to use a beef stock as opposed to a chicken stock, just for a heartier flavor to match the richness.

Great recipe with ingredients you probably have at home! I have made this twice now. The main thing I would recommend doing differently is to saute/brown the onions and mushrooms in butter/olive oil before adding them to the broth. I used a stick blender to blend the mushrooms. Tried it both fully blended and also with some whole mushrooms... great both ways. I didn't have sherry, so I used brandy and white wine. I would thin it a bit with chicken broth if you want to add noodles, rice, or potatoes. The addition of parsley at the end was a game changer. The soup is great as is... adding parsley makes it pop!

This is the BEST freakin soup of any kind that I have EVER made! My best advice is to follow the recipe exactly with one exception...I added a quarter slice of butter to every bowl.  Simply fabulous!!! I mean SIMPLY FABULOUS!

Beyond amazing, this recipe was perfect! I didn't have any sherry so I used rice wine vinegar instead but I am still blown away by how good this was!!

This was a huge hit at my house.  I went a little heavier on the thyme, using both dried thyme leaves and ground thyme.  PERFECTION!

This is a great cream soup recipe.  I only changed a couple of things:  I added half a can of cream of mushroom soup for added creaminess and used half a bag of mirepoix instead of doing the chopping.  I don't think the mirepoix made much of a difference in taste, but it sure cut down on prep time.  I will definitely make it again.

I followed suggestions and cooked the onions and mushrooms a little before adding to chicken broth.  It was a tiny bit salty for me, so I'll back off on salt next time...but there will be many more next times for this one!

I measured the 5 cups of sliced mushrooms (per the recipe) but I chopped up the sliced mushrooms before I measured the 5 cups.  Chopping the mushrooms intensified the mushroom flavor.  I would suggest the mushrooms be measured by the ounce or the gram instead of by the cup.

This recipe turned out great. I used a combination of white and portabella mushrooms. As good as any I have ever had in a high end restaurant. The next day I used the remainder in green bean casserole. It was the best ever! I will never buy canned soup again.

It was delicious.  I didn't have cream, so I used evaporated milk.      To make it taste like Lowrey's Steakhouse mushroom soup, I added 1 tablespoon of Worchestershire Sauce.  Yum!

Loved it!  First time Imdid t have any sherry so used port.  Second time I used part half and half and part heavy whipping cream.  Used sherry this time.  Just as good as the first batch!  Definitely recommend this recipe.

I used shitake mushrooms for half the amount and it added richness and meatiness. I also added 1/4cu of sauvinon blanc and an additional 1 1/2 cu of stock. I used pacific vegetarian stock instead of chicken. I added 1tbsp of white wine vinegar.

In the food processor I left the veg chunky not pureed. I kept aside some 1/4" diced shrooms and added them when everything was mixed. I simmered the whole mix for 30min to gel the flavors. 

Amazing!

I made this twice yesterday, once according to directions.  I was thankful I had extra mushrooms.  The first time turned into a gelatinous mess.  It tasted ok, but the consistency was awful.  The second time I made it, I fried the mushrooms and onion together and blended the flour mixture with the liquids then added some of the mushrooms and used my hand blender to chop up the mushrooms.  Then added the rest of the mushrooms.  I found this recipe just a little too mushroomy and too thick for my liking.  It was just ok.  I will try another recipe that I saw on this site calling for a little more broth and less mushroom.

I’ve made this a fair amount and it always comes out amazing. I follow the recipe except for getting some extra mushrooms and once I’ve made the soup nice and creamy either adding small chunks or really thin slivers for a more varied texture

Excellent as written!  Great with some buttered crusty bread.  I used my immersion blender right in the pot after the veggies had cooked, then added the butter/flour/cream portion to that.  I took the advice of another reviewer and added a clove of crushed garlic to the mushrooms/onions/broth/thyme mixture.  I would add two next time.  I also subbed some red wine I had on had for the sherry.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Sauteed onions in butter and used heavy cream.  Other than that just by directions.  Excellent and will make again.   Reduction in liquid and used chicken stock base to use as substitute for canned.  Thyme is the key.

This soup was, easy, quick and simply delicious.  The best I've had. There were so many mushrooms that I had to double the liquids, but I'm so glad I did. I like my soup chunky so didn't puree the 'shrooms. I will only use half the thyme next time though, and I did add garlic.  I will only use this recipe from now on, it's the best I've had.

Turned out great!   Could have added more mushrooms for more flavor.  I used what I had, but not the full five cups.   Used a low carb flour so it didn’t thicken as fast either.  Had to let it cook a little more.  All in all, a good first try!

Super easy! That being said...mine was too thick. I added some more broth just to thin it out. I didn’t use sherry either. Very tasty though.

I definitely want to try this recipe again with a few tweaks to thin the soup and add more texture. Using heavy cream the soup was very thick. Too thick, in fact, so I thinned the soup with 1-cup of 2%-milk, but I think water may make a better "thinner".  Also, my wife suggested not pureeing all the mushrooms, but save some slices for the soup as texture.  It's an easy recipe that I will try again for sure!

The only difference I made in the recipe was to saute the onion and mushrooms before adding the chicken broth.  It was delicious.

This soup is easy and delicious.  I added a clove of garlic and used fat-free evaporated milk instead of half and half.  So much better than canned soup!

Excellent! I used Portobello mushrooms which I cooked a bit in a dry pan to intensify the flavor before adding the broth. Per suggestions here, I added a large clove of garlic, although I don't think it made much of a difference, and won't do that again. When whisking together the flour and butter, let it cook a bit, stirring constantly, to get rid of the raw flour flavor. Actually, you can make the mushroom paste ahead of time, and finish the soup at dinner time. But 6 servings? Small cups maybe. It was so good, I decided to make it dinner!
Definitely a keeper!

Really searched for the number of servings, to no svail. With 1.5c stock and 1 c thickened dairy are yon figuring on the sliced mushrooms (5.5c) to bolster the liquid? Don't thinks so.
Suggest saute of mushrooms to develop more flavour, and more stock for volume.

This is sooooooooo yummy!! Creamy, rich, flavorful and down right delicious. I'm not a huge fan of thyme as a single herb so I add a few more to complement it. This is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, my tastebuds did not like the thyme all by itself.

This soup is delicious! I followed the recipe but since I didn't have cream or half and half I used one cup of canned evaporated milk and a tsp of cornstarch to thicken. It was perfect and we ate it so fast I forgot to take a photo!

Great soup! Simple! I definitely will make it again. I changed it up a bit. I used Shallots and Beef Broth instead. Was so delicious. Will try with chicken broth next time. I felt the beef broth would go nicer. I also put in fresh thyme, and added some Aleppo Pepper for a nice kick, as i like my soups a little spicy.

I am lactose intolerant so used lactose-free milk instead of half-n-half. Upped the flour by a tablespoon and used 16 oz mushrooms.  Needed to add a little extra salt to make up for the sweetness of this type of milk. Sauteed the onions in butter by themselves first for about 5-8 min, then added mushrooms and thyme.  Cooked until tender then added the flour. Cooked for 3  minutes to take the raw flour taste then added the broth, sherry and milk.  Blended  with my immersion blender leaving about half the mushroom pieces.  Added a little balsamic vinegar as I just had the store brand sherry. Yummy!  Definitely will have to double next time and use real sherry.

I adapted the recipe. Did not use food processor. Sautéed the mushrooms and onions in butter and then in a separate bowl mixed one cup of broth with flour and condiments..added this mixture to mushrooms and simmered and then the remaining broth..2 cups in total and then half and half. Really like the slices of mushrooms being more substantial.

I didn’t change any ingredients, just the preparation method. First, I cooked the onion in butter till soft, then added the mushrooms and cooked them down till all the liquid evaporated- that gives the soup a more concentrated mushroom flavor. Then I added the flour to the mushroom and cooked for a minute, Added the broth and cooked a few more minutes, then added the sherry and half and half. InStead of a full purée, I only puréed half the soup, to give it a little chewiness. It was delicious!!

I thought this was a tasty soup! I did sauté the onion and mushrooms without the broth. I also used beef broth instead of chicken for a more meaty favour.

This super easy recipe made a delicious dinner!  I did sauté the mushrooms at the start, pulled about 1/3 of them out and pureed the rest.  Honestly this is the best mushroom soup we've ever had.

Excellent recipe and easy to make.  I used baby portabella mushrooms (2 8oz pkgs) that were pre-sliced thick, so they had to cook about 25 minutes to get done.  I used unsalted chicken broth, 4t. melted butter + 1 c. milk instead of half-and-half and didn't have sherry so substituted with rice vinegar.  This made 3 bowls for my mother.  Thanks for sharing.

I didn't set aside any mushrooms to chop up as I wanted a smooth soup. Added a bit more broth to blend vegs,  more  thyme to the finished soup and cilantro.

Followed comments from others and sautéed onions and mushrooms in some butter first, before adding stock.  Used button and baby Bella mushrooms-really added nice flavor! Delicious recipe and will make again! Only made about 3-4 bowls though as a main course.

I didn’t have any sherry on hand, so I substituted balsamic vinegar and it worked well.

My mom is taking Chemo. Won't eat anything but soup and needs low sodium. Been making all sorts of soups. And I cook on cooking days and store for the bad days when no time to cook, but still scratch. This recipe was Fast and Easy AND I can make the base and freeze before adding any dairy to it. I do this a LOT with cream of anything soups. Then It won't separate. Didn't need to change anything. Doubled the batch and froze 1/2, then added the cream and milk to the batch I will serve tonight. Thank you for the recipe.  It is really yummy. I would have used garlic but did not because it did not call for garlic. Loved the touch of thyme and Sherry. One more thing, my daughter is gluten free. Thickened with a little gluten free Flour and corn starch, added the corn starch when I blended and it came out great.

Followed the recipe exactly- it was ok but nothing I will keep as a go to. It was the wrong kind of chunky for me. I prefer a very creamy base with diced or whole pieces of tender mushroom and a more buttery cream flavor vs milky (like a bisque).

Same  ingredients but after processor I blended small amounts to reduce the coarseness ....after finished I pan fried a few mushroom pieces for finished soup. Sherry definitely added great flavor.
I also doubled batch and will freeze batches.

I used Mushroom broth, and cut the cream to 1 cups and pureed it so there were few chunks of mushroom.  It was very good, and it made 4 large bowls of soup.

8.22.18  Only modification I made was using fat free half-and-half (what I had on hand), and this still turned out well.  Would recommend not omitting the sherry at the end, I think that’s important to the overall flavor of this soup.  I used an immersion blender which gave me exactly the chunky texture (not a puree) I was looking for.  Only one comment about the number of servings.  If you’re looking for a “bowl” of soup, you won’t get it with this recipe.  IMO what you’re going to end up with is, realistically, a small-appetizer serving. Finally, I must say that I like the way this breaks down nutritionally, but is still full of good flavor.

Great base to start off of but I did sauté the onion and mushroom in a bit of butter and added the fresh thyme to that. I used an immersion blender on the sauté mix prior to adding to the soup base. I added a bit of garlic powder and a bay leaf to the soup and it is perfect. My kids hate mushrooms and they even loved it.

I didn't have any half and half so I used some milk and sour cream instead. I added more milk to make it thinner. It was very good.

Yummy!  I don't think this is really 6 servings though.  Not if you like cream of mushroom soup.  I will make it again but will probably double the recipe.

I followed recipe exactly except I only had heavy cream so I used that.  If I had known how easy it was to make I’d have done this a long time ago. Had the notion in my head that it would be an all day thing.  There I go thinking again!  It really is as good as the best mushroom soup I’ve had from fine restaurants.  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe. I will make it often!

This first time I made this soup, we likde it but I needed to make some changes. We found the chicken stock and thyme overwhelmed the soup. The second time I made it I used 3 lbs mushrooms, white and brown, 1 1/2 onions, 1 can evaporated milk, 2 cans of water, vegetable Better Than Bouillon, onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper, Mrs Dash, bay leaf, savoury and parsley. This was a hit with my son, this is his favourite soup!

I made this exactly as written the first time, and it came out way too thick for me.  I thought maybe I messed up the bechamel quantities but no.  Anyway, I added an additional half cup of half and half and a half cup of chicken broth and it came up fine.  Second time I made it, along with my additional liquids I added a clove of garlic to the mushroom and onion mix, more thyme (I agree it is the secret ingredient) and about 1/8 tsp of Cayenne pepper. Just a couple of suggestions if you are looking for a slight modification.

The best cream of mushroom soup recipe. The only thing I do differently is add 1/8 of a teaspoon of nutmeg and 1/8 of a teaspoon of cinnamon. Delicious!!

Excellent. I made this AS-IS, made ZERO changes and am rating it as such. Thanks for the recipe!                                    By the way, this recipe is similar to David Letterman's mom's which is also good.

Great,  solid base to start with...  I've made changes that suit the taste preferences of my family and have been thrilled with the outcomes but that all evolved from this recipe as a starting point.

Made this today and it's delicious.  
No one else likes mushrooms in my family so I don't have to share.  I have it all to myself. :)

No changes in the recipe.  This was a delightful recipe that my husband and I both seriously enjoyed.  We are making it again this week and I can't wait.

I made this recipe for a beef stroganoff since  my daughter is lactose intolerant and can't have the store made versions of mushroom soup. the only thing I did to this recipe was add more mushrooms, which I did not puree, just kept in larger slices, added a little bit of parsley and lactose free cream.  it was absolutely delicious!!  will definitely be making this again.

Pretty blah. Ended up adding more salt, chicken base, and a touch more thyme. Next time I’d sauté the mushrooms and onions in butter to add more flavor.

Oh so delicious, only change I make is using apple cider vinegar instead of sherry. It is sooooo yummy, I crave this from time to time and make a no knead bread to go with it.

This is the best mushroom soup! As good as any fancy restaurant could serve. I made it last weekend with portabella mushrooms because that is what I had at the time and I don’t have Sherry so I used white wine. Thank you so much for sharing this with everyone. I made it again tonight with plain mushrooms and light cream I’m in love and my Husband loves it too!

I absolutely loved this mushroom soup!!  It had wonderful flavor with a very rich velvety taste. I almost always change a few things when I make something new but not with this. I’ll definitely be making this time and time again.

THIS IS THE first time I have taken the time to write a review. This soup is amazing and so easy to make. However, I added a lot more half and half then it called for. Maybe 3 cups. I like my soup soupy...it was very thick. i used 8 oz of shiitake and 8 oz of baby portobello. I sautéed my onion and then added the broth and mushrooms. I had white dry wine on hand so used it instead of sherry...but definitely a needed ingredient. Just an amazing soup!

No changes to the recipe. It tasted as good as the last restaurant cream of mushroom soup I had.  Left overs tasted great as well a couple of days later.

First of all, I am tired of people complaining when other folks add their own twists to a recipe. Otherwise I would have to look up 500 recipes for mushroom soup if folks did't offer helpful advice.  THANK YOU FOR ALL ADVICE AND SUGGESTIONS! And for those of you who don't like it-stop whining and just read the recipe as is.

I used extra mushrooms and onion with spread instead of butter and coffee creamer instead of half and half (heart healthier for me).  I left out the salt and pepper and substituted Better Than Bouillon (chicken flavored) instead of liquid chicken broth.  It came out good and I might make it again.  Thanks Karena.

I coarsely chopped my sliced button mushrooms and sauteed them with chopped onion for a couple of minutes in the butter first, sprinkling with salt, pepper, and the Thyme. I used fat free half & half and prefer mushroom chunks so I didn't puree anything. I will use this recipe again, thanks!

This was so delicious I can't wait to make it again for family and friends.  I did substitute 3/4 cup cream and 1/4 cup milk for the half and half.  Nest time I will blend half of the mushrooms instead of leaving them all whole.   If you like Cream of Mushroom soup you must try this

I just wanted to leave a quick note thanking the original recipe provider and all of the people that took time to leave a review documenting all the changes they made and how it worked out for them. That is really what makes this site so great. I often don't have all the ingredients for a recipe or see ingredients I don't like but I know I can find some helpful changes in the reviews and hope everybody keeps up the great work. Thanks!

This soup was delicious. I used whole milk instead of cream and I didn't add any sherry because I didn't have any.  Also, I was having a craving for paprika, so I added a little sweet Hungarian paprika, sprinkled on top.  I'll make this again soon!

This is a delicious recipe.  I used two containers of gourmet mushrooms and two of  baby bellas.  My husband, an avid soup lover all year long, declared this soup one of his all time favorites.   Thank you!

Made this according to the recipe and I loved it.  I used about half the butter and flour to thicken and found that it was thick and rich enough to my liking.  Thank you for this recipe!

I have made this twice and it's been wonderful both times. The time and the little bit of sherry makes a big difference.  I usually make it whenever I find mushrooms on the special and I've done it with button mushrooms and baby portobellos

I've never made homemade cream of mushroom soup but had a container of mushrooms that needed to be used, so I chose this soup to make. So easy and quick. My only issue I had was that it seemed to be thicker than I preferred, so I just added a little skim milk and achieved the right consistency for me. Surprising flavor for as few ingredients as called for.

This is an excellent recipe, and I use this as a base for any  other recipe that has condensed cream of mushroom soup as a base. I did make a couple of changes after making it the way it is written the first time. First, I put the mushrooms in the food processor before cooking them in the chicken broth. This gives you a chunkier consistency and make the mushroom flavor more noticeable. Also, I add about 1/8 tsp more thyme, and I add the sherry to the mushrooms and chicken broth so it cooks more into the mushroom mixture, not the cream. This is a great recipe overall, with just the couple of minor tweaks to fit my tastes.

Sautéed mushrooms and onions before adding broth. Used homemade chicken broth that I had in freezer. Sadly didn't have sherry so substituted a splash of dry vermouth. I plan to add wild rice. Next time I'll double recipe.  Other recipes look a bit more interesting, but this was easy.

This is a great starter recipe for cream of mushroom soup. It was a little bland so I added some more salt, garlic powder and red chili flakes, and it tasted AMAZING! 

Beyond the original recipe, I also added some cubed chicken and cooked it all together with some extra chopped up mushrooms (mostly for texture). But this is an addition for another day.

I will definitely be making this soup again, with my original changes with the extra spices.

I love this soup! My only change was I sauteed the mushrooms and onions for about 5 minutes before adding broth, per another cooks review. I froze 1 cup portions in bags to take to work and every time I eat it I say to myself how awesome and tasty it is!

I had to make two substitutions bec I had no onions on hand, so I used dried onions, and I had no half and half, so I used 1/3 c butter with 3/4 c milk.  I loved this soup! I didn't puree it though bec I love big chunks of mushrooms, but this soup is oh so good!  Thank you for the recipe, and next time I'll make sure to have everything I need on hand so it'll be even better!

I made this twice now. The only variation was that I didn't add sherry. It is very good and rich even without sherry. The first time I made it so I could make green bean casserole. I live in the Holy Land and I can't find canned cream of mushroom soup. Naturally this was far better than canned. I made it again for lunch today and loved it. My wife loves it as well.

This is a simple, delicious soup. I've made it twice for our traditional  Polish Catholic Wigilia meal. The second time, I processed the mushrooms too much. Next time, I'll leave more of the large slices. My family loves this!

I just finished making this for the 2nd time,  my husband and I really enjoy this. I tend to make larger batches of things and this one was no exception. I used all the same ingredients but used 2 packages of fresh mushrooms, 32 oz carton of chix stock and 32 oz of half & half. I probably used more sherry than the recipe called for and the only other thing I did a little different was to cook the mushrooms and onions longer in some of the chix stock (about 35-40 min) to draw out more of the mushroom flavor, then I used my immersion blender and blended up the mixture into small pieces, then continued with the roux and used whisk to blend all together in stock pot with half & half and remaining chix stock. I like to let mine cook on VERY low setting for about an hour to give all the flavors a chance to meld and adjust salt/pepper to taste. This is likely to become a "go to" recipe in my house.

mmmmm SO Good! I think it would have been 10 stars with 1/2 and 1/2 or heavy whipping cream, but this is what I did- I used 1 pound of portabella mushrooms that I sliced into 3'rds or 4th's depending on size. I used 1 stick of butter to saute the mushrooms and 1 chopped onion in for about 20 minutes or so, then added about 6 T. flour, salt, pepper and thyme and sautéed on medium low for about 5 more minutes, then added 3 C. chicken stock, simmered about 5 more minutes then added 2 C. whole milk and stirred on low until thickened (maybe 5 minutes) I was doing housework between all the steps and so it might not need to be that long at each step, but that's how long I was busy...........added some parsley over the top and more black pepper and served with saltines.....I didn't use the stick blender or food processor as I wanted a chunkier soup.....Also,  I didn't have sherry or wine so skipped that- still delicious! .will make again when I get a sale on fresh mushrooms......SO MUCH BETTER than canned....takes a little more time though, but definitely worth it if you are eating as a soup instead of a casserole ingredient....I would even serve it to company along with a salad and  No Knead Artisan Bread (On this site- so easy and so delicious!- just plan a day ahead...) Yum!!!

I doubled the recipe and it came out velvety smooth and delicious. Followed recipe to the letter, but added few cloves of garlic to mushroom onion, broth. This is a keeper!

Our go to cream of mushroom soup recipe! Easy and much tastier than the canned stuff.  (I do, however, sautéed the mushrooms and onions in butter rather than boil in broth).

I quite enjoyed this recipe as is! However, from some of the reviews here, I noticed most tweaked it a bit. those of us who cook a lot and know what a recipe will tasted like by reading it, we always put our own little twist, a little more (or less) salt, a different herb, it's all good!

I love this recipe, which I've probably made at least 8 times thanks to Kroger putting mushrooms on clearance. Keep your eyes peeled - if mushrooms expire on the same day, I can often buy for $1/lb. Negotiate with the produce manager if necessary! =)

If I slightly change anything regarding ingredients, I make a half and half substitute with butter and milk since I don't keep half and half in the fridge regularly. Otherwise I still keep to the original measurement needed. I do sauté the mushrooms and onions in a little bit of oil first, then add the sherry to deglaze (and then add chicken broth, etc).  

If there's anything I change procedurally, I melt butter in the microwave in a Pyrex measuring cup and then just add other ingredients and whisk (with the flour etc) in the cup. I don't want to use a sauce pan because I am lazy LOL. I then dump the milk/butter/flour mixture into the pot with the mushrooms, broth, etc. Keeping everything in one pot, I then use an immersion blender to get the desired consistency. 

I freeze in ziploc bags in ~10oz portions so that it's easy to pull for recipes requiring cans of cream of mushroom soup. This is definitely my go to recipe for this soup. Forget buying store bought cream of mushroom soup!

This soup tasted great and had a lot of flavour! The only thing I would change next time is using more broth or half & half to give the soup a more liquid consistency. Mine came out very thick and I only ended up with 3 servings. I definitely plan to make this again though!

The type of mushroom to use wasn't specified, so I used a mix of white  button and a "special blend" (per my local grocery). I followed the recipe as written, and was disappointed at the lack of a strong "mushroom-y" flavor in the end. I don't know much about mushroom varieties - perhaps there are some that carry a stronger flavor? I may try it again...may not.

So glad I was out of mushroom soup in the can! I didn't have any half and half so had to use skim milk and a couple T. of sour cream.  Delicious on my pork loins with apples and onions. Rice pilaf on the side.  I would never have thought of using thyme, one of my favorite herbs. Thanks so much! Sharing this with my daughter, too.

Was driving through the Brandywine Valley, PA. at lunchtime and saw a quaint little restaurant with a big sign for Mushroom Soup. It is one of the first beautiful Fall day's and I decided that this would hit the spot, but they were closed. I stopped on my way home for some mushrooms and picked up light cream, too. Followed the directions, substituting the light cream for the half and half. I also added some fresh grated nutmeg and fresh thyme from my herb garden. I've never made Cream of Mushroom soup before and am wondering why, as I have been cooking since I was seven years old. This has a beautiful light flavor and is surprising easy to make. Perfect for a crisp fall day with a fresh warm baguette.

I sauteed the mushroom and onions with pepper and thyme, to deepen flavor, but it still came out rather bland. Took the idea from one of the other commenters and used it as a sauce on grilled pork instead.

Wonderfully tasty soup. Very happy with how this turned out. Minor changes I made:  took about half the onions and mushrooms and blended them with the chicken broth before cooking. Cooked the other half of the onions I. A little butter until translucent, then mixed it all together and proceeded with the recipe as normal. This just allowed some of the onions and mushroom slices to stay through till the end.

Excellent recipe!  Every bit as delicious as the mushroom soups I've had from high-end restaurants.  About once per year I buy a cartload of mushrooms and spend an entire day making many, many batches of this.  I then freeze it in individual containers and use it throughout the year in recipes that require cream of mushroom or cream of chicken soup.  It dramatically enhances every recipe from the standard can cream soups that the recipes usually call for.  I puree only half of the ingredients to allow larger chunks of mushroom in the soup.  Other than that, I make exactly as written and it's phenomenal!

I  was sharing this recipe with my sis, and realized I have never reviewed it, even though I've made it for years. This is in my top two favorite soups. I've made it with different mushrooms for variety, but the plain white grocery store mushrooms are still wonderful and it is an excellent soup. I served it recently to vegetarian company and they loved it too. Served with a salad and fresh bread it is a perfect meal. Especially love how easy it is to make. But the resulting delicious soup is why I give it 5 stars.

This was very good but next time don't add salt.  It's better for people to add it to their liking. Very yummy!!!!! I added some chopped up red skinned potatoes and it was so good!! Also used evaporated milk instead.

I made this soup exactly according to the instructions, except I used used sliced bananas instead of mushrooms. Instead of flour I used baking soda.
I had no  sherry, so I substituted creme de menth.
I had no milk on hand so I used powdered. I also didn't have any bullion cubes to make a chicken stock, but I did have chipotle cubes and used them.
 
I ran out of thyme, but figured alum would work just as well.

This was the worst soup recipe I have ever tried. It came out way too bananaey.  My dog wouldn't even eat it.


But seriously, the recipe is very good. The only thing I do differently is to sautee the mushrooms. I make this soup regularly. It's cooking right now.  I also use heavy cream instead of 1/2 & 1/2.

Had I known that homemade mushroom soup was so simple, I would have made this years ago.   I cooked the onions, and then the mushrooms in the butter and added a some garlic as well.  I used regular mushrooms but had some cremini and shitake on hand so threw those in.  I then added more like 2.5 cups of stock.  I pureed using a stick blender but left lots of bits to maintain some texture.  Other than that, I reduced the amount of cream to 3/4 cup and added milk to make it 1 cup.  When I poured them together, the roux got lumpy so I used the stick blender again and it worked like a charm.  Topped it off with some chives from the graden. We loved it.  Even my mushroom hating daughter tried a bowl.  I'll make this again

I Had never done creams before But my brother loved cream of mushroom so I tried it was delicious! The only funny part was  that I assumed I added flour only to realize it was actually panckake flour! I used purple onions and I never did find The sherry in The store :( thanks for The recipe was really good!

Made exactly as written with the ingredients- though sautéed the onions and mushrooms in butter.  Used a combination of white, baby Bella, and shiitake mushrooms. Added a few shakes of cayenne for some heat. Used the food processor to chop but not purée the cooked mushrooms.

This was AMAZING!  I was already cooking before I realized I did not, in fact, have milk to mix with the heavy cream I had in order to make half and half,  so it was extremely rich.  It was good by itself, and even better for dipping bread.  I loved the thyme with the mushroom flavor.  This was my first crack at from-scratch creamy soup and I was very happy with it.

The best cream of mushroom soup ever! I'm usually not a big fan of cream of mushroom soup as it just seems kinda plain to me. But this soup right here.....WOW! Only change I made was that I used some shitake mushrooms with the regular white ones. Will be making this regularly.

Followed direction to a T, it's excellent. In the past with no sherry I just used a squirt of red wine vinnegar, but go easy and add to taste..... it's pretty strong, thus easy to put in too much

This is a really good recipe as is. No more canned mushroom soup at our house. We  like our soup chunky so I skipped the blender part. I finely  chop some mushrooms and leave others thinly sliced.

Fantastic soup! We've made it a few times, but most recently we discovered we were out of thyme. We substituted basil and it still tasted great. This is a favorite and is requested often!

A great simple recipe!  For the people that gave negative comments...maybe your skill level has not progressed past opening a can. As for changes, I added  a tablespoon of butter and sautéed the onions first for 5 minutes, then added the mushrooms and thyme and cooked for another 7 minutes letting the mushrooms give up some moisture. At that point I added my homemade chicken stock. For my taste, I added 1/8t of white pepper. Came out great! I will use the leftover to make tuna casserole.

This was a great soup!!  Definitely restaurant quality. I made it dairy free and used coconut half and half and coconut oil instead of butter.  It is thick but its a cream soup and in my opinion should be thick,

My girlfriend was craving scratch made mushroom soup. My objective going in was to try find a match to the killer wild mushroom soup served at a local restaurant. I read a dozen or so of the reviews, decided on a few alterations, but basically stayed true to the original recipe. Oh my goodness, this recipe rocks! My GF love love loved it.

Perfect - with the following changes. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. I doubled everything except the mushrooms, plus I added 2 cloves of pressed garlic (add it to the melted butter when making the roux), 1 Tablespoon of Herbs de Province.

Fabulous... Very easy recipe to make, and I tweeked it a bit to suit my tastes...
I sauted the onion in some evoo and added a small minced garlic clove, then put that in with the broth & mushrooms - I used beef broth because that is what I had! I used my immersion blender right in the pot too... Just delicious... I think it didn't really need the sherry because it softened the flavor of the mushrooms. I won't use that next time because I like strong myshroom flavor.
Yummy!

I sautéed the onions in some butter first and then added the chicken broth, mushrooms and thyme.  
Also I used heavy cream rather than half and half thus eliminating the need for flour making it a low carb soup.

made just as directed, but rather than serving as a soup 
( which would have been delicious) used it as a sauce for penne pasta and diced cooked chicken.  Baked with some shredded mozzarella on top- home run!

I made this exactly as the recipe states and it was terrific. I chopped the mushrooms a bit fine when I was prepping and did not use the blender so the texture was more coarse.

Great recipe!  Make minor adjustments to suit your own tastes if you want.
I agree, don't rate this recipe if you are going to significantly change it so that it is really another recipe entirely.  Job well done--thanks for submitting, Karena!

I doubled it. Used heavy cream, fresh thyme, and garlic. I sauteed the onions and mushrooms in butter and oil prior to mixing with broth. And, pureed about half of the veggie & broth mix. REALLY good.

Out of this world! Very meaty flavor and very hearty. Very simple. I like the browned mushroom flavor so I browned the onions and mushrooms before cooking in broth. I also used vegetable broth instead of chicken. Since everyone agreed it didn't look good 100% pureed I did half and half. I cut half of the mushrooms extra thick and it gives it a nice chunkiness. Also I pureed half for the heightened flavor is gives. The thyme (I used fresh.)and the sherry made the soup. Watch the salt though I think they use a lot.  I think it comes out to just the right consistency, thick but not too. Wow thank you for letting us in on this one.

This was really good. I don't know if I did something wrong, but the texture wasn't what I expected. It was just ridiculously thick and felt more like a purée than an actual cream. Seriously it had the thickness of mashed potatos. Still, the taste was excellent and exactly what I was looking for. I'll just know for the next time that I should add milk maybe and it will definitely be a 5 stars.

LOVED This! So yummy! I used vegetable broth instead of chicken because I'm a pescetarian.  Turned out perfect. Very simple too! :) I used Crimini and portobello mushrooms . I also sautéed the mushrooms in the butter first, then I used leeks.

Will definitely make again. I will need to cut mushrooms thinner so they cook faster and leave in processed longer so they are creamier. But the taste was great!

Unbelievably good!  I used 2% milk since I didn't have half n half and I threw in some cauliflower as I was short on the mushroom.  Wonderful buttery flavor and great texture.  Ate some and then used the rest for hamburger casserole!

This was delicious!  The only thing that I changed was sauteing the onions and mushrooms first  and using heavy cream (next time I am going to make it with half and half and see how much of a difference there is).  I also only pureed half of the mixture since we like to have some mushroom pieces..   Everyone loved it.   This will be a recipe that we use many times!

Followed some of the suggestions, doubled the mushrooms, used baby portobellos, puréed 1/2 of them, used FF 1/2&1/2, sautéed the mushrooms and onions first, added some garlic. Excellent. Will definitely make this again.

Very good soup! i used a combination of shiitake and portabella mushrooms. chopped them finer and did not put in blender - we like ours chunky. Thinned out some using chicken stock.

I think this is a pretty great recipe as is.  We are gluten free so I used rice flour instead of wheat flour.  The only other thing I changed was to add a little bit of white wine and a bit more salt than called for.  I should have pureed the mushrooms a bit more to improve the appearance, but my husband liked it a lot.  I will make it again.  Might try it with beef broth and red wine for a deeper version.

This was very good. I made double the recipe and served it as a main course. It was enough for four adults with a little bit left over. I did cook the onions in butter with the thyme for a while. I also added three cloves of garlic. Then I added the mushrooms and cooked them down for 10 or 15 minutes. I used portobello, oyster, shitake and regular mushrooms. I really liked the variety of flavors and textures. Next I added the chicken broth  and again allowd it to cook for another 10 or 15 minutes. Once the remaining ingredients were added (except the sherry) I blended about 1/3. Then I added that to the flour/butter (I used 2 1/2 TBSP of each) in another pot and the remaining "chunky" soup. Brought it to a simmer until it thickened a bit. Just before serving I added 4 Tbsp of Port (I didn't have sherry). It was excellent! I did not find it overly thick as some people mentioned.

I made this to replace the canned stuff and it was great.  I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I altered it a bit.... I substituted gluten free all purpose flour which does not make a difference in the taste.  I  did not add the Sherry at the end because I didn't have any and I don't think that it is missing anything without it.  Finally, I sauteed mushrooms, onions and garlic in a touch of olive oil and then added the chicken broth instead of boiling it all in the chicken broth.

This recipe is very good as is. I just had to rectify the salt content and that was it! Hubby loved it very much too! It is easy and surprisingly quick however if you are like me and love slow simmered soups prepare it and put it to simmer for about an hour or so to get that creamy and rich tasty flavor to develop. Just watch that you keep it at a very low temperature while it simmers so the liquids do not evaporate too quickly.

Incredible! I pureed a little more than 1/3 of the mixture and left the rest of the mushrooms and a little more sherry than called for. It was a huge hit and I will certainly be keeping this as my go to recipe for mushroom soup!

good. Husband said it was easily the best soup I've ever made. 

Had to make a couple substitutions, merely because I didn't have any heavy cream or half and half or fresh mushrooms. Ended up using a can of mushrooms we had kicking about and 3/4 cup 3% milk and 1/4 cup sour cream. It worked. :)

Also left out the sherry, but only because we didn't have any and sautéed the onions and mushrooms with a clove of garlic, just 'cause. 

It's a very adaptable recipe :D

Delish! Didn't have sherry so added a dash of nutmeg and a dash of cumin. "A delicately nuanced soup with layers of intricate flavors  for the discerning gourmet." I made that up myself. It's just real, real good!

I made this as written the first time and didn't serve it.  The texture that the soup had was gritty for lack of a better word.  However the taste was great so I made it the next night by chopping the mushrooms into a rough chop and proceeding with the recipe as written with no pureeing and it was very good!

I preferred to saute the onions/mushrooms (rather than boil); it just seems to bring out the flavors more. I used a combination of sliced mushrooms and 1 oz of shitakes. After soaking the dried shitakes, I reserved some of their liquid and used that in combination with the chicken broth. I pureed only half of the finished mixture, wanting some mushroom pieces in the soup. I think this will be better as it stands in the next day or so. Thanks for the recipe! UPDATE 6/9/19: Besides about 1/2 cup fresh mushrooms, I used two small bags of dried mushrooms that I soaked in water for 30 min. Also used that liquid (2-3 cups) in place of the chicken broth. Simmered for 1 hour to soften up. Then added about ~1 cup of chicken broth as the water evaporated while simmering. Will let sit a day or two before having.

Earthy deliciousness.  The mushrooms are the star of this soup.  We have spent the past year eating less and less processed junk so our palette is adjusted to real food.  This was lovely.  We did omit the sherry.  I still feel this is a valid review even without the liquor as there are many who cannot or do not cook/drink alcohol.  In my case, we cook late at night & alcohol sales are illegal at this time in my area so I did not have the legal option to cook the recipe as written.  It's still a valid review.

If you're looking for a recipe that tastes just like the tinned MSG-laden "cream of mushroom" soup then your palette probably won't fully appreciate the nuanced flavors of this soup.  For everyone else, however, it's a really good version of mushroom soup.

Excellent as-is, or tweak it for your own taste.  I like to use some dried mushrooms with the fresh, and use the (strained) water from the reconstitution with the chicken broth.  My husband doesn't pester me for much, but he pesters me for a batch of this soup!

This recipe is delicious. I don't know why I've never made this before now; it was as good as any I've ever had! I used my own chicken bone broth, baby bella mushrooms and 2/3 whole wheat, 1/3 white flour.  Since I didn't have sherry, I substituted red wine.  Easy, since it was already in my hand! :) 
I will definitely make this again!

Mmmmmmm!  This is the first time I've ever made cream of mushroom soup by scratch. I subbed 2% milk for the half and half and added 2 tbs of coffee creamer to make it more creamy. I also subbed a tsp of rice vinegar for the sherry. The only thing is I over processed the mushroom mixture but it still tasted perfect!  The flavors blend very well!

This was absolutely fantastic!!  While I added a little more mushrooms, which cause me to have to add some more broth and half/half, I followed this recipe as written.  It is a keeper!!!

I made this for my husband, he loved it. I just had to add a bit more flavor. The addition of
Better then Bouillon Vegetable worked great to liven it up a bit.

I made this this morning for the first time and it turned out awesome. I use 4 large portobello mushrooms. I put Italian dressing on the underside of the caps and grilled them over charcoal them until tender. I sautéed the chopped onion in a saucepan and add the chopped portobellos at the end. I added the chicken stock added the mushrooms and puréed with my stick blender.  I mix it all together with the half-and-half and simmered. I didn't have any Sherry so I used apple juice.  I definitely will make again probably a bigger batch. Very good!

Delish recipe. I didn't blend it as I wanted just the sliced mushrooms in my soup and it was superb.

I loved it!  I used 1 small onion (perhaps 1 cup diced?) but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I blended approximately half.  It looked like cement sludge but tasted *AMAZING*  Next time, I think I'll saute the onion and mushrooms first before simmering them in the chicken stock.  I'll probably also experiment with fat-free half and half.  It was soooo good!

EDIT: I've made it with fat-free half and half and thought it was just as delicious.  Every time I've made it after my first try, I've always sauteed the onion and mushrooms before adding the broth and much prefer it.  I've also tried dill in it with delicious results.  I did use beef stock one time when I realized I had run out of chicken stock and didn't feel like running to the store.  The beef stock really overwhelmed the flavor of the soup--definitely stick with either chicken or veggie.

I ended up using about 3/4 cup of dried mushrooms because thats what I had on hand. That meant that I also needed extra liquid but I ended up adding less than I thought I would need - about 1/2 cup. Mine turned out incredibly mushroomy but very delicious.

This was very good!  Made as directed with the exceptions of adding a clove of garlic, using arrowroot powder to thicken (mixed with a few tablespoons of water, then added to soup pot with purée, remaining mushroom chunks, and 10% cream), and using white wine (what was in fridge) instead of sherry.  Arrowroot powder allows this to be frozen to be used in place of canned soup in other recipes.  The purée was amazing... It turned into a mousse in my blender that would be divine in tarts, all in its own.  Thank you for the recipe!

Turned out great.  I had a shallot to use up so I diced a bit in with the onion and thyme as I sauteed it in butter with mushrooms.  Didn't have sherry so I substituted a little dash of Marsala. I liked chunky slices of mushrooms instead of a puree style. Very tasty.

I use this mushroom soup recipie whenever another recipie calls for canned mushroom soup. This taste amazing on its own and makes it easier on my to stay away from processed food. Sometimes I leave half the mushrooms sliced others i purée the whole thing depending on the recipie it's going with! Thanks for great flavor added to my recipie box!

I LOVE this recipe.
I'm big on cooking ahead, so I made the two "sections" separately, and before adding them together I froze them each in their own little takeaway containers. Then when we wanted amazing cream of mushroom soup I defrosted, combined and finished the recipe.
mmmmmmmmmmmm!

Loved it ! I didn't know it was this easy. 
Beats the heck out of all the bad stuff they put in canned cream of mushroom soup, sodium and preservatives. The only alterations I made were adding a 1 tablespoon of grated parmesan cheese and a pinch of garlic powder - delish ! 
I used my Ninja to puree 2/3rds of the mushroom mixture. I like a little bit of texture. Great recipe, I'll definitely make this again.

This was a good base recipe. Easy to make. I added Jane's Krazy Mixed Up Salt (1 teaspoon), Adobo (1/2 teaspoon) and Old Bay (1 teaspoon) and that made it pop for us. Now I feel like I should make a batch just for freezing to use in recipes. That can crud just ain't gonna be the same any more...

Received some beautiful portabella's in my CSA box so I made this for my hubby. I am allergic to mushrooms which means I could not taste as I went along. I had to rely solely on the submitter's recipe. Hubby said it was great and rated it a 4. This is good coming from him. I did things in a different order and sauteed the onions and mushrooms in the butter first. Made a roux of flour and the broth that already started in the pan, then added the stock and slowly the cream. I will make again. Thanks Karena!

Excellent, super quick and easy.  I had 3 packages of button mushrooms to use up and this was perfect.  Rinsed them under water, quartered them and followed directions.  Made the mistake of adding 3/4 tsp thyme to the pot (had a brain blip from the computer to the kitchen and only enhanced the flavor.  Used corn starch instead of flour and only a bit of heavy cream.  Voila!

Excellent! I made it in the afternoon to go with dinner and I've already eaten 2 bowls! I hope I can save some for dinner. 
  I tweaked it only a tad. I added a little minced garlic because well, I love garlic and as others suggested, I pureed a little over half the mixture is all. I like a few good chunks of mushroom. That's it, great recipe!

Tried this today.  Great beginning. Small changes .. used chicken flavor soup powder and water, added chicken chunks, pureed only 1/2 and used milk instead of cream. Lower calories that way. Thickened with a little corn starch. All gone!

I don't eat mushrooms but I needed a recipe to use use for green bean casserole. I made this by adding garlic  and omitting the mushrooms and it was perfect. I also skipped the chicken broth since I wanted a thicker sauce.

I was making Tuna Noodle Casserole, which calls for cream of mushroom soup. I only had s can of cream of broccoli and thought I'd go with that, but decided to look up a recipe on this forum, and found this one.

It was excellent and my wife and myself had it as starter while the casserole cooked. 

Also, it went well into the Tuna Noodle Casserole. I'll use it from now on being it's healthier and has less sodium than the commercial brands.

Absolutely delicious, just what I was looking for. I did it few times and everybody in my family loved it. I added little more sherry, just because I like stronger smell and sautéed onions with mushrooms as was recommended in others reviews. Great and so easy recipe.

I found this recipe years ago, and when I need cream of mushroom soup, and I don't have any on hand, this is my go-to recipe, I love it as it is, the only I don't do is puree the the soup, I love this soup!!!

I make this about once a month for the cafe I manage and it is a hit!  It is creamy and full of flavor. I made it with Marsala this time because we were out of cooking Sherry and it was still yummy! The Red Bird Cafe, in Brockport, New York 14420 highly recommends this savory soup!

I plowed ahead with this recipe even though I lacked a couple ingredients. Instead of an onion, I used three cloves of garlic; for want of sherry, I splashed in some Irish whiskey and my wife's homemade crabapple wine. It still turned out splendidly, great consistency and everything. It's all I can do to keep from wolfing it down tonight, rather than rationing it for a week of lunches.

This is fantastic! Rich and creamy and full of flavor. I did sauté the mushrooms in butter with a bit of the broth. I then lightly pureed the mushrooms and remaining liquids before adding it to the butter and flour roux to thicken. Fabulous!

Excellent flavor, thick as creamed mushrooms. 5 cups of mushrooms? That's a lot for the amount of liquid. My soup was the color of dirt.

This recipe was truly bland.
I don't know what else to say about it. It was quick to throw together, which I was truly impressed with. But when I sat down to eat, it was not what I was expecting. 
If I ever attempt this recipe again, I'd sautee the mushrooms with garlic and onion first, then puree half that mixture. I find that puree'ing the mushrooms with the chicken stock made the soup way too thick. So I'd sautee the mushrooms separately after they are cooked, and then add the chicken broth with the other final ingredients (cream flour butter) and let it simmer til the desired thickness.

I made this recipe using roughly 8 cups of morel mushrooms. I doubled the recipe. Only thing I did differently was used a heavy cream/milk mixture because the store was out of half and half and I used a splash of moscato because I didn't have sherry. It actually tasted very good using that wine so I think you could use any wine you think tastes good.  

It turned out delicious. The morel flavor was very rich. I froze it in 2 cup portions and have been using it to make recipes that call for a can of cream of mushroom soup. Morels by themselves don't freeze well so if you find a lot of them this is an excellent way to preserve them and to incorporate them in many different dishes.

I need more stars for this recipe!!  I've been making it for years and it is delicious.  I sometimes tweak it and make a lighter version by subbing milk for the half and half, but rarely as this soup is a real treat and it's worth the extra calories.  Thanks Karena :-)

This was my first attempt at mushroom soup and it was very good.  I doubled the sherry and the half & half (I had a lot of mushrooms) and next time I think I would only puree half to 3/4 of the mushrooms, leaving some in larger pieces for appearance.  Overall very good and I would make again!

I sautéed my Mushrooms and Onions in the Butter then added the Flour to that, rather than cooking mushrooms in broth. then I added the Broth and half and half other ingredients. I also added some heavy cream and about a half spoon of Nutmeg powder (secret ingredient).....It was Great!

I made this almost as is. I left out the sherry and instead of half and half I used sour cream. We love it I'm making a double batch right now. Good job.

I made this soup exactly as written, and the flavor is fantastic. I didn't expect to like it as much as I did. I'll be making this one again and using it to replace can soup in other recipes.

Of course will all recipes I find on the site, I make exactly according to recipe and then decide if I think any changes are in order... None needed here. Don't think I will ever buy commercial C.O.M soup ever again. Next batch I am going to double so I can freeze some for later use

I made eight batches to take to a bridal shower.  Like other reviewers, I sautéed the onions and mushrooms in the butter first, then added the black pepper, thyme, salt and flour to make the roux.  Once that was thick and browned a little, I added the chicken broth and sherry...then slowly stirred in the half and half at the very end.  I also ran about half the mixture through the processor and left some mushroom slices in tact.  I did add some extra sherry here and there. Just my personal preference.  I used both the pre sliced Button and the Baby Bella mushrooms.  Will definitely use this recipe again!

I Love the Recipe. I only had Beef broth to use. Then I used a little canola oil & beef broth to mix the flour as I do not mix dairy with meat. An amazing recipe! The sherry is an added bonus! Loved, Loved, Loved the recipe!:-)By the way, I used Portabello mushrooms, porcini and white mushrooms combined.

Wonderful flavor!  We ended up using a little more broth then it called for, just to use up what we had and we left some mushrooms not pureed, other then that, went with how it's written.  We loved it!

Great recipe. I made it vegetarian by using vegetable stock (never really sure why mushroom soup isn't already vegetarian). I also used dried wild thyme (just added a bit more aroma to normal dried thyme)...and a bit more than the recipe said.

Just made this. Would have used the instructions as written, however, I only had whole milk and didn't have any thyme or sherry. I substituted the whole milk for the half and half and omitted the sherry and thyme. Really delicious. I normally do not salt my food, but found this recipe did need a bit of salt and pepper as per the instructions.  I'll definitely make this again.

I've made this recipe for my husband about 4 times now and he LOVES it! I have used cremini & white mushrooms alone and also used a combination of cremini, white, oyster and shitake. He loves the one with the four mushrooms! Thanks so much for the super-simple recipe. Changes I made? I use 1 can of chicken broth which is a little more than 1.5 cups and I also use more flour to thicken.

This soup is incredibly easy to make.  I doubled it but followed the recipe closely except that I did not have sherry so had to leave it out. Oh - I used double cream.  I added a total of 1c cream even though I doubked the recipe.  It was plenty for our tastes.  In fact, I added almost another cup of chicken broth, both to thin the soup some and to dilute the creaminess.  It was perfect for us then.  Once you make the roux and add the mushrooms/onions back into the pot, you can use your own judgment about how much and what proportion of broth and cream (or combination of milk and cream) to use for your family's tastes.  I also did not puree the mushrooms/onions at all. Try it. Regarding the chicken broth, I had recently cooked a whole chicken so had the stock from that to use.  I had frozen some of it in silicone cupcake pans, about 1/3 cup in each. Very convenient.)  As i said, very easy and very delicious.  Thank you for sharing the recipe

As we say in the south, this is slap yo' mama good.  I made it according to the recipe directions, using a blend of maitake, shitake, baby bella and white mushrooms.  (All but the white mushrooms were organic.)  My original plan was to make it and freeze it for use in recipes.  However, we just may have it for dinner instead.  If I were doing it again, and making it to eat as a soup instead of as an ingredient in other dishes, I would only puree about half of it.  That's the only thing that I would differently.  It is perfect the way that it is.

I used half white and half baby portabella's. Great flavor. I used tarragon instead of the thyme and it was excellent.

It was an excellent mushroom soup. I substituted half and half with milk, since that all I had. My children were excited and liked it so much. Thanks!

I know, I know, we're supposed to rate the recipe as is, but even though I didn't have sherry or half and half, I wanted to share that this recipe was STILL amazing! I used heavy cream instead of half and half, and I skipped the roux making step (I just added the flour to the already cooked vegetables and stock and thickened it up that way), but it was still so tasty, and much, much better than canned. As far as servings, it made about  5-6 cups of soup, so if you want more of this deliciousness, double the recipe! Definite keeper!

Wow, I will never use canned soup again!  I sauteed the onions and mushroom and thyme in butter until almost done, then added white zin because I didn't have sherry.  I allowed that to boil off for a few minutes then set to the side before I made the roux.   The depth of flavor is amazing in this soup.  We used it Christmas and Thanksgiving as the base for green bean casserole but it could easily be eaten by itself.

Good base recipe, but needs some tweaking. As many said, saute onion, then garlic (the base for everything savory!), then mushrooms in butter or olive oil. I use at least 4-5 lbs of mushrooms at a time (it's no more work than a puny 5 cup recipe, plus you'll want leftovers), and put about half through the food processor on the shred disc, and very roughly chop the rest. Mixed mushrooms is delicious, but at the minimum, use something more flavorful than plain white. Shiitake, cremini, bellas, woodears, whatever you can find (except enoki; their delicateness is lost in this soup). I then add a carton of broth, puree a few swishes with the stick blender, add the roux and (for my volume of soup), 1-2 c heavy cream. This soup is wonderful with plenty of s&p.

This was amazing! I like my soup really creamy so I used 1/2 cup half and half and 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream. I also had a bunch of garlic and butter that was sitting on my stove from escargot being broiled and I thought "why not" so I threw the butter and garlic in. I made this for thanksgiving for the green bean casserole but ended up eating so much of it (cause its amazing) that I was short for the recipe I had intended it for haha. I'm making this again today for dinner cause its just WOW! I'm using portabella mushrooms for mine and sautéing them in butter, onions, and garlic then adding them to the recipe. I'm sure this recipe is great the way it is but I love to experiment with food :)

YUMMY and easy.  I made 1/2 batch and only changes was to decrease the thyme (not a hug fan) and added a roasted garlic clove (leftover from last night).  WOW.  Oh forgot the salt & pepper as I usually add those after tasting.

Wow, this was delicious!!! I used fat-free half and half.  Also, couldn't find sherry, so purchased and used Marsala (?). It was absolutely great.  Thanks for the recipe, will def be making this again.

Came into possession of 3lbs of mushrooms and had a craving for soup. Just made it, just tasted it and love it. Of course I tweaked a little; added four large cloves of garlic, sauteed the onions, garlic and mushrooms a little before adding the broth, didn't puree as I wanted mushroom slices visible, combined a little milk with the flour and added this mixture directly to the simmering veggies and simmered a little longer before adding cream. Delicious!  Thanks for this, will definitely make it again.

This soup is thick and hearty enough to use as a sauce over rice, chicken, etc.  The flavor is excellent--and so many mushrooms!  Very easy to make.  The only change I made was to use white pepper instead of black which left a nice subtle heat.

My boyfriend and I had a dinner in one of a finest restaurant in Stillwater. I asked for soup and the waiter suggested cream of mushroom soup which is one of their specialty. It was so delicious that it made me keep on going back just to have the soup. I tried making this recipe and it taste like the same. Superb!! Thanks

I made this according to the recipe but used 1/2 heavy cream and 1/2 half and half because that's what I had.  I didn't have any sherry so I left it out.  Adding some cooked brown rice at the end as well as some toasted walnuts.  Super yummy!

This was really good. I followed it as written except used 2 cups of chicken stock, simmered it for 30 mins, and added 2 tbsps of sherry. It was really easy to make, and I will use this recipe again.

My family and I loved this recipe! Had a ton of mushrooms after shopping at Costco. The ONLY adjustment I made was to use gluten free flour. Well maybe I accidently added a teeny bit more sherry than called for. Would have been great even without the sherry! Only wish I made more!

I made it dairy-free with unflavored almond milk, a little corn starch to thicken it, and vegan butter! Turned out great and could not even tell that I did not use any dairy! Husband couldn't even tell! I also didn't puree the mushrooms! Yum yum! Thanks again! =)

Wonderful! I only made minor changes to suit my taste - garlic powder instead of onions (don't like them) and gluten free flour to thicken (am sensitive to gluten). I also sautéed the mushrooms and seasonings before adding broth. To make it easier, I just gave it a few pulses with my stick blender since I like mushroom chunks. The sherry and thyme give a great flavor! Thanks for an easy recipe with simple ingredients!

It is a cold day here so I just made this soup.  The only change I made was using a leek instead of an onion.  It was perfect.  Great soup!!  Will make it again.

Oh so good!!!  I made this almost exactly according to the recipe, with a couple of minor tweaks.  First, I added a couple cloves of chopped garlic with the veggies.  I also sauted them for a few minutes before adding the chicken broth to let them cook completely.  Lastly, I used fat free half and half.  For this first time, I used regular white button, baby bella, and shitake mushrooms, but I imagine it would be delicious with any types.  Karena, thank you so much for the amazing recipe!  It at least ties, if not beats, the to die for soup we had on our honeymoon cruise last year!

Delicious!  My boyfriend said it was the best mushroom soup he ever had!  I did reserve half of the mushroom mixture and added directly to the soup because we like the whole pieces. I also sautéed the mushrooms and onions first.  I can't wait to make again!

I love Cream of Mushroom soup, but I love it thick and rich.  I boiled leek (in place of onion and I needed to use it up), carrots and celery in the chicken broth first, then blended them into a puree. This is was the base for my stock. Other than using the required chicken stock, this was wonderful on the rainy day I made it!!!! Normally I use a rue to create this texture, but this did the job with out gluten or the fat and butter!

I just finished making this soup for my first time, and just had to review it ASAP.  IT is so amazingly delicious I couldn't stop eating it!   I did some very minor tweaking...  I doubled the sherry, and added a little more onion.  I also sautéed the onions and mushrooms on their own, and added the broth later.  I will definitely make this again.  It's better than any Cream of Mushroom I've had in a restaurant, incomparable to canned soup, and so EASY to make! This recipe is a KEEPER for sure!!!!

One of my children is on a gluten free diet.  I used to use store bought cream of ..... to make all kinds of things.  This has such a small amount of flour in it that I just use 1/2 amount of cornstarch or gluten free flour and use it in my favorite recipes that call for cream of mushroom soup.  I actually like this better than what we buy.  It is really easy to make:)

I made it the way it called for and I thought the flavor was really great.  However, for me this was a little too thick, in my opinion.  So, this time I did add more of the half and half after trying it first.  But like I said, I loved the flavor.

One of the best and I've had. 
A few small notes, you can substitute cognac if you don't have sherry. I doubled the half & half and chicken stock (organic), and only pulsed four times to retain larger mushrooms. I also used fresh ground pepper, and unsalted butter.
Simply great, thank you for sharing.

Just learning to like mushrooms and decided to make this. The soup is absolutely delicious and simple to make. I will make it all through the winter.  The only thing I had to change, out of personal preference, was adding 2 cloves of garlic with the mushrooms and onions.  Thanks!

Oh my this was fantastic.  I used portobella and fresh shitaki mushrooms which were a bit chewy, next time I will take the extra step and pop it in the blender.  Only makes about 4 cups.  Which is purrrrrrfect for my family of 3.  Not sure how well this would reheat.

Easy, simple gourmet Cream of Mushroom Soup.  I followed recipe exactly except used 2 portabella mushrooms (browned), sliced Crimini mushrooms (browned) and then white mushrooms (browned).  Probably used about 6 cups mushrooms cooked.  Adjusted half & half & chicken stock to get the consistancy I was looking for.  Wonderful soup.  Will become a staple.

Very good soup!  I did saute the mushrooms and onion together with minced garlic until soft and clear.  I made the sauce (butter flour milk) in a separate pan and then added it to the mushroom mix.  I then simmered the whole thing together with the broth and thyme and pepper.  (no sherry) It was wonderful!

I really like it but felt like it was missing something.  Next time I think I'm going to make it with mushroom stock and see if it's better.  I rarely use Chicken stock in my recipes because I'm a vegetarian but since I made this for my dad I decided to go according to recipe and then try some of it for myself.  Also I didn't puree all the mushroom mixture I took about 3/4 cup of the mushroom/onion out and I garnished with a bit of parsley.  I also used Crimini, Oyster, and Shiitake mushrooms for about 3 cups and the other 2 Button mushrooms.

Oh my goodness, this was delicious!!  Exactly like La Madeleine, which my 10 year old daughter loves.  I used regular white mushrooms.  If you want to be totally decadent, use all cream, but serve in small portions becuase it's so rich.  Also be mindful of hot food in the blender; I cracked the top a bit to let the steam out and just pulsed so no explosion would occur.  Great recipe, thanks so much!

I love mushrooms and this was my first attempt at Cream of Mushroom Soup.  It is delicious, rich and creamy.  I added a little extra half and half, and a little extra broth, as mine came out very thick.  I also used vegetable broth instead of chicken. As for mushrooms, I used half white and half portobellos  Perfect with nice, crusty bread on a cool fall evening!

I follow the recipe exactly except I use unpasturized goat milk instead of the half and half. Makes an excellent sauce as well as a good hearty soup.

I have made this soup near a dozen times and my family LOVES it!  I follow the recipe almost to a T except I add broccoli into my vegetable puree which my kids this is fun to eat a green colored mushroom soup.  :) I also add about a teaspoon of minced garlic cause we love garlic.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

WOW!  I have been looking for a recipe for Cream of Mushroom soup that tastes like the soup from La Madeleine.  I have found it! The only thing I did differently was saute the onion and mushrooms for 15 minutes.  I will make this again and again.

Great recipe!  I must admit that I don't like mushrooms, so I just omit the mushrooms and the fist step and I still come out with a great cream soup base.

OK...this is sooooo good... and extremely easy and actually fun to make...  I added a bit of white wine since I didn't have Sherry...and it was incredible.    I also used veggie broth instead of chicken since we are vegetarian and used soaked cashews instead of cream.  Olive oil instead of butter.... incredible!!!

I made this for my husband and son.  Since I was cooking it I had to do the taste tests.  I really don't like mushrooms but this was fantastic.  I didn't blend the soup but just chopped the mushrooms really finely.  It turned out really well.  The only issue that arose was that it was a little on the salty side because I had to use boullion.  I added liquid whipping cream to the soup to tame the salt while keeping it on the thick side.  It was very good and I'll be making this again!

Awesome. Used 5 different kinds of mushrooms (oyster, shiake, portobello, enoki, and regular white button) and it was delicious. I served it to my parents and my in-laws and got rave reviews. This is now our go-to mushroom soup recipe.

Great recipe.  Very simple and easy to do!  I love Cream of mushroom soup, but since we try to stay away from the stuff with so much MSG.  this Recipe is just perfect for Low Carb to with some minor modifications (use Low Carb Thickening Mix instead of Flour)!!!    We didn't have any Sherry, so I used Sauterine wine and it worked perfectly.

Beautiful soup! I did double the roux and the liquids to get six servings from this,( but that was because I knew I would love it).I can now stop looking for a mushroom soup recipe. Ignore the hackers that totally reworked it, this is lovely as is!

Outstanding!  Served as the first course of Christmas dinner and it was the clear favorite of the whole meal...even of my teenage sons who don't like mushrooms. I used porcini, portabello and shitake.  I chopped them a little (nice bite size) before starting and reserved half of them before blending.  The only thing I omitted was sherry.  Before serving, I sprinkled fresh chives on top.  Delicious!!

The only change I made was I doubled the thyme.  It was perfect I will double this next time.  This soup is simply amazing.  Nothing compares!

I used reduced sodium chicken broth and thought it turned out great!  Often times the canned soups in stores are salty, which I am not a fan of. All I need now is a food processor that can puree the mushrooms a bit better and it'd be perfect.

So good and easy! I used fat free half and half and just blended it with an immersion blender in the pot.  Can't wait to make it again.

Flavor was wonderful! Used Chanterelle mushrooms. Seemed a little thick, so added about 1/2 cup 1% milk. Add spices to your own tastes.

Excellent! just be careful not to add to much thym, but it's an amazing soup! Enjoy! p.s. I did the cream base differently, put 2 tbs of cornstach into the cup of cream and added directly to mixture in saucepan (after using a hand blender to blend it up) It's great!

I just made this soup and it's delicious!  It's not as mushroomy as it might have been had I adjusted everything to match the fact that I only had about 3 1/2 cups of mushrooms, but even with the shortage it tastes good!

GREAT FLAVOR! I used this recipe to substitute the canned COMS in "Best Green Bean Casserole." Absolutely delicous! With the original recipe, I added 1 more cup of half and half and thickened it up with some cornstarch. I had enough for my green bean casserole and 3 cups to go in the freezer. This recipe makes me wonder why anyone would use the canned stuff. SO FLIPPING GOOD!

I made this soup using button mushrooms and accidentally poured in twice the amount of half & half required. Also, I didn't have thyme or sherry on hand so I just skipped them. It still turned out good, but was a little too rich for me. Next time I'll omit the butter and probably cut down on the onion as well, since I also found that the onion makes the soup a tad too sweet.

I wanted to follow this exactly, but I didn't have some ingredients so I had to substitute. Don't think it made a HUGE difference but here goes: used heavy cream instead of 1/2 and 1/2 but next time, I'll go for fat free 1/2 and 1/2. Also, i used white cooking wine instead of sherry because i didn't have sherry. And last but not least, I sauteed the onions before. Next time, I won't do that as it requires to add oil (unnecessary because you are blending up the stuff anyway!). Hubby gave it a 4.5. I give it a 4 because it was a bit thick for me. Next time, I'll just add more broth!

Very good soup definitely a 4 1/2 star recipe so I will bump it up to 5. I think it could be VERY great by adding the finely chopped celery and shredded carrots and some different types of mushrooms. Fantastic for a basic cream of mushroom soup recipe, I will never eat canned again!

Very Yummy. I was looking for a cream of mushroom and artichoke soup I had at a restaurant recently. I used this recipe and added about 1/2 cup of artichoke hearts. I also added some minced garlic and pappy's seasoning. I used marsala wine instead of sherry. I used an immersion blender right in the pot. It was very creamy and very yummy!!!!! Will definitly make again and again.

Wow, this was delicious!  I used homemade chicken stock and added a minced clove of garlic and more thyme than called for, also was out of half/half, so I used 1% milk and some unflavored coffee creamer (!) and it was wonderful!  Next time I make this I'll add the sherry; I didn't have it today.  But we gobbled this up, and it was so easy to make, too.  Thank you for the recipe--this goes in the permanent rotation.

I made it a little differently because I have an aversion to the texture of mushrooms cooked in broth.  I fried them up with a little butter, took them out of the pan and made the roux, then added them and the broth back in.  I used a lot more wine than they called for and I subbed half and half for fat free evaporated milk.  Perfect!

Yummy yummy!  Followed the recipe for the most part with the following additions/changes.  I did 1/2 regular white mushrooms and 1/2 baby bellas.  Add the salt to the mushroom mix while it's cooking AFTER the mushrooms have been sauteed a bit so that the salt gets 'into' the mushrooms.  I only put half of the mushroom mix into the processer to add a little more texture to the soup.

I was very excited to try this recipe based on the reviews but it wasn't what I was hoping for.  It was a fine soup but didn't have enough flavor for me.  I used 3 TBLS of Sherry (followed the rest of the recipe exactly) to help increase the taste but it only helped a little bit.  I will keep looking for a different recipe.

Amazing - as good as any restaurants.  I used 2% milk as I didn't have half and half - was still very creamy tasting.

This is a great recipe but could use a little tweaking. I sauteed the onions and mushrooms first until golden. I added extra broth, half and half and 1/2 cup sherry as I like the flavor. Overall, very delicious, but as written is a little bland to me. Thanks for sharing!

Very tasty! Best cream-of-mushroom soup I've made. It's now my go-to recipe. 
I do have to add, though, that I modified the recipe a bit. First, I sauteed abt. 2 cups chopped onions and abt. 1 tbsp. minced garlic with 1/4 tsp. dried thyme, then added all the sliced mushrooms (which made up abt. 7 cups); when these were softened, I added 2 cups organic chicken broth, abt. 1-1/2 tbsp. vegetarian "chicken" soup powder from our local natural foods co-op., and cooked up the mixture for abt. 15 mins. I did NOT puree it as I like mushrooms pieces. 

Meanwhile, I made the roux with only 2 tbsp. butter and 2 tbsp. flour (whisking it constantly), and since I didn't have cream I added abt. 1 1/2 cups organic sour cream and the same amt. of organic whole milk. Seasoned with pepper and brought to a boil, cooked a bit till thickened, and added to mushroom mixture. I added another splash of chicken broth and also milk to thin it out, though that was pretty optional. 

After cooking soup for a little bit, I finally added about 1/4 cup dry sherry, then cooked a bit more till done. Yum!

Great soup!  The rich, creamy flavor distinguishes it from the stuff in the can.  This came in handy during my first few weeks post braces.  I added carrots and potatoes and pureed with all of the mushrooms.  This soup would be great on a cold day as it's nice and warming!

Very easy recipe to make, the only difference that I made after scaling it to 12 servings was to add a half cup of red wine. All in all what my family would consider a "Keeper"

This one's a keeper. Followed the advice of others and saute'd a mix of onion, garlic, and leek, then added the mushrooms for about 5 minutes before adding broth. Used cream, not half and half...because we do not fear the real thing! Thanks for a great recipe!

It is not fair for me to rate this recipes since I changed so much, but it was an excellent guide and I think I would have enjoyed it as is.  Anyway, I added Bok Choy and celery.  Next time I'll probably just use Bok Choy.  I also didn't have thyme so I used Oregano and Basil.  I had to add a cup of chicken broth.  And I threw in some chopped green onions.  I used skim milk and light sour cream instead of half & half (1 cup milk, 1/2 cup sour cream).  At the end added a little cheddar cheese and only a teaspoon of the Sherry.  I don't think I'll add cheese next time.  I also had to add some garlic and garlic salt.  I'm a salty person so I like my things with a bit more of it.  It suited me perfectly when I was done!  I always try to add veggies to soups.

Pretty Good Soup. The Sherry made a difference. Very simple to cook and it all cost under $8 to make. Will cook it again.

Delicious!  Just 2 changes.  I only added 1 tbsp. of flour and at the end, with the Sherry I added 1 chicken bouillion cube.  Less flour makes this soup great if you are following the Atkins low carb diet.

This is an excellent soup.  I just made it for the first time and it came out perfect!  I don't have a bender so I didn't puree the soup, but it still came out perfectly.  I won't be touching the canned stuff again ever.

This was good, but I doubled the recipe and found it almost too creamy.  I would cut back on the cream next time and increase the broth.  I would also add some garlic next time.  I substituted sherry with regular red wine, which was great.  Overall, a great recipe.

This was so much better than the can. I love mushrooms, so I was able to add as much mushrooms as I wanted.  I was also able to control the salt portion being that I am dieting.  One thing I changed was I chopped the onions and I did not puree.  I wanted to keep them chunky.  Other than that, so delicious.

I'm giving this recipe three stars because we were a little over-ambitious with the 'shrooms.  Less is more, and next time I'll stick to the quantity the recipe calls for.  Anymore than that, and you end up with glop instead of soup!

Fast, easy, delicious!  The hardest thing you do for this recipe is chop the onions.  I made it after work one day.  I was in by 6:00, eating by 7:00.  So simple.

I like my soups a little thinner so I decreased the flour and added more broth, as well as another cup of mushrooms and a smig more half/half.  As recommended by other reviewers, I pureed only half of the mixture, but next time I'll omit that part altogether for a hardier soup.  This is an excellent recipe I'll make over and over again.  Enjoy!

First time I've made homemade mushroom soup and I love it!!  Adjustments:  Didn't use Sherri(didn't have any); used half chicken broth, half beef broth; added 2 cloves of garlic along with the onions; and used 1% milk instead of half and half. I also added about 1 cup more milk in the end. Can't wait to try other types of mushrooms out.

This was a delicious, simple, and satisfying soup.  The only change I made was to add more sherry, about 4 oz (I like to taste my sherry!), and used white pepper (lots of it).  Calories be damned, next time I think I will use heavy cream for a richer, thicker soup.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  Yummy!

EXCELLENT!  I chopped my mushrooms instead of sliced, which gave me more mushrooms actually when measuring!  Still plenty of liquid!  A "DO-Over" for sure!  Good on these chilly nights!

This was good, eventhough i used chicken and vegetable broth. The reason i gave it 4 stars is that i decided to follow the cooking directions the other reviewers gave. Overall, good!!

I thought this was a terrible recipe.  I tasted it a couple of times and threw it down the sink. It had a bitter, off taste to me.  Maybe it was the mushrooms I used.

Very good and very easy.  I did omit the sherry but will try it next time.  I did double it and had no problems with that.  Will make again and again.

AWESOME soup recipe!! my in-laws LOVED it! husband thought it tasted like a really good mushroom soup we had at the bearfoot bistro up in whistler. i made a couple modifications though - added italian herbs and basil instead of the thyme, and used homo milk - i just eyeballed it to the right color and consistency. i also ommitted the sherry. yummy! i now use this recipe asa base for all other vegetable soups. i tried it with asparagus and it was great!

I made quite a few changes, but the basic recipe was the same. I used 1/2 c milk and 1/2 c sour cream instead of half and half, which gave it a tangy flavor. I also only had 4 cups of fresh mushrooms, so I chopped up carrots and used a cup of those. Finally, I didn't have any thyme so I used a little sage, some fresh rosemary, and 2 cloves of fresh garlic. I think it really needed the seasoning, so it turned out great. If you're going to use this as a main course, it makes more like 3 or 4 servings, not 6. Overall, a great basic soup!

Can't believe how easy this recipe is to make or how tasty it is.  I too sauteed the mushrooms and onions before adding to the chicken broth.  I also added 1 grated carrot with the mushrooms and onions.  Results were excellent!  I have also doubled the recipe - again, excellent result.

This is a keeper. Although I sauteed the onion and mushrooms first and used brandy instead of sherry. I also added a drizzle of black truffle oil while the soup simmered.

Used wheat-free, gluten-free flour in place of the regular flour and a good quality fat-free half-and-half in place of the full fat stuff.  You couldn't even tell the difference!  Don't worry as you make this if it seems as if there won't be enough liquid in this soup--the mushrooms add enough and make it perfect!

Very Nice! Of course I didn't have fresh mushrooms or fresh onions but I did have dried Shiitakes and minced onions. It took at least double the chicken broth, but boy, it turned out fantastic! Love the addition of the cooking sherry and I also added chives (I didn't have any fresh green onions) for some additional color and flavor. YUM!

This recipe was delicious!! I doubled the recipe and used portabellas, shitakes and white mushrooms. I sauteed the mushrooms, onion and thyme first and then added them to the chicken broth. I mixed the remaining ingredients in a saute pan and then added the mixture to the soup. The sherry was a nice touch at the end. I had to add more salt and pepper at the table. I served it with fresh baked bread. Yummy!!!

This was very easy to put together. I had some fresh mushrooms that had to be used up and decided to leave them as slices instead of putting everything in the food processor or blender. Next time, I will go ahead and do this step because there was "too many mushrooms" and it was harder to eat. I also added some fresh chopped garlic and used heavy cream.

very good. I did puree about 1 cup of the mushroom mixture which made it more easy to eat and creamy. I used some white wine instead of sherry and some fresh thyme. I would sautee the mushrooms and onion first then add the flour to it and add the broth and mushrooms next. It was great. Also used whole milk,( about 2 cups)and did not feel cheated.

This was my first Cream of Mushroom try.  After reading many of the reviews, I took the advice of sauteeing the mushrooms & onion before simmering in the broth, as well as not pureeing the entire lot, because I, too, enjoy the "chunks"!  For my first attempt, it came out great, thanks to all of you!!  I also doubled the recipe and have some for the freezer to enjoy later on!

Very good! I used 1 lb. white mushrooms, 6 oz. of baby bellas, and a pkg. of mixed, dried exotic mushrooms. Also dumped in the soaking water from those. Will keep this recipe as my husband and I both liked it very much.

I had about 7-8 cups mushrooms, 1/2 chopped and 1/2 sliced, so I increased about 2 1/2 batch of the other stuff; used cream and milk both, sauteed the onion (3/4 cup) (and added 1 tbsp of pounded garlic) until softly fragrant, added the 'shrooms for about 5 minutes and then the broth, simmered 15 minutes. In separate pot, did the 'roux', added the dairy (need more of either water or milk - too thick for me) and when smooth, added the 'shrooms mixture to it. Forgot the thyme in my anticipation, omitted sherry, added freshly ground black pepper to taste during cooking, and as you can see, I did some of the tips given, thanks Karena and all. Didn't do any puree of anything at all. Had about 15 decent sized servings. Definitely better than campbell's, and this is a campbell soup house. Good good one.

This is a great soup but the color leaves alot to be desired.  After blending the mushrooms and onions I was left with a grey goo.  The final soup was the color of concrete.  The flavor however was worth looking past this and my customers agreed that this was the best mushroom soup Ive ever served.

Awesome soup!! Better then that canned "stuff". Family loves it...eating it for lunch as we speak. I used white button and portabella mushrooms...left a few chunks. The smell is fabulous...perfect for a chilly afternoon. Thanks Karena for a great recipe!

This is the best!! I didn't have sherry on hand so I used Marsala. To lower the fat, I used 1/2 cup of fat free half and half and 1/2 cup of regular hald and half. Great taste.

Excellent!  Extremely simple!  I added dried porcini and shiitake mushrooms.  This gave it an extra richness and depth.  I over doubled the recipe and used Land O'Lakes non fat, non dairy creamer instead of cream.  I bet silken tofu would work too.  Thanks.

Fairly quick and easy.  The sherry makes it, so I aded a little more than in the recipe.  I also used all sorts of exotic mushrooms for a complex flavor.  The fat free half and half worked wonderfully!

What a great recipe! I didn't feel like digging out the food processor so I skipped that part. This is fast easy and perfect for a cold winter's day.

I made this last night for a "quick" dinner, it was wonderful!!  It made enough for my Husband and Myself with just a little left over for lunch the next day.  I would double this recipe the next time around.  I used milk instead of the cream and also used Marsala wine (that was all I had). Even with the subsatution's it turned out great.

This soup is so good!  I used evaporated skim milk, and added about a half cup more than called for, and I didn't puree the mushroom mixture.  It's one of the best mushroom soups I've ever had.  The sherry adds a wonderful flavor.

Good tasting soup.  I found that the liquid content did not scale to 6 servings.  Either double the recipe or add more broth.

I tried this recipe because of all the great reviews.  And we really liked it, too!  My husband raved, as well as my grandma.  I substituted evaporated skim milk for the half and half, and it was still just as good!  Definitely a keeper!

This DID NOT take 50 minutes prep/cook time!  It was super fast.  I figured it would be hard because I had never made a cream soup before.  This was easier than baking the potatoes for dinner.  I did not puree the mushroom.  I sliced them in pretty large pieces.  I thought the slices of mushroom were very pretty and it did not change the consistency at all.  The soup was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.  I  was quite amazed at myself!

This recipe was everything I'd hoped for--quick, easy, and delicious!  To cut the fat, I substituted an equal amount of evaporated skim milk in lieu of the half & half, and no one knew the difference.  This one's a keeper!

I would puree half of the vegies and leave the other half sliced. I used 1% milk and did not think it made any difference. I threw my old recipe away. This was fantastic.

A++  This is a very tasty soup.  I only chopped some of the mushrooms before I cooked them, and left the others in slices or chunks.
