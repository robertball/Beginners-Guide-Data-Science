This was the first time that I can recall having used fresh marjoram, and we loved the flavor--though I went a little short on it because I wasn't sure about it.  I watched the video first, and I loved the idea of the little well in the center of the mushrooms to saute the shallots and to add the creme fraiche.  I'm certain that using Chef John's Creme Fraiche added to the wonderfulness of this recipe.  I wasn't able to find the variety of mushrooms he recommended, so I had to rely on criminis and whites, but they were really good.  I'll look for them next time!  I used brandy and Champagne vinegar.  Thanks for yet again another great recipe!

I made this with the ingredients the recipe called for, but I wanted more sauce so I doubled the broth and creme fraiche. It didn't thicken as I had hoped so next time I will use a little less broth. We ate it served over grilled chicken. This was a test run and next time I am going to serve this over pretzel dumplings. When I was in Germany I had them with a mushroom ragout and I've been anxiously awaiting recreating that dish.

delicious! I didn't have the creme fraiche, so (based on another recipe) I used ~1 cup sour cream, one clove of garlic, one onion and one shallot with 40 oz of mushrooms (white and shitake). i cut the cognac down in half. the idea was to have hints of flavor - alcohol, garlic - without any one flavor dominating I also cut the soup because my mushrooms were pretty liquid.

This recipe was very good.  I did wind up making the creme fraiche- which was really good but you could easily substitute sour cream and come up with very similar results.  I added the leftovers to a roast pork that I made a day earlier and it was a HUGE hit.

Fabulous recipe! My husband picked some gorgeous Chicken Mushrooms this past weekend and I had no idea how to cook them (besides the boringly obvious butter saute of course) and once again, Chef John has come to my rescue! 

We wanted to use what we had, so we substituted leeks for the shallots, brandy for the Cognac and vinegar, heavy cream with a little sour cream for the creme fraiche. The creme fraiche sounds Awesome but since I wanted to make this dish tonight, I wasn't going to be able to make the creme fraiche in time, but next time I am definitely going to make it in advance. 

We used about 8 oz of chicken mushrooms (which looked identical to the lobster mushrooms used in the video for this recipe, btw), 4 oz of shittaki, and 6 oz of portobellos.

1st time, had to improvise a little substituting sour cream for the creme fr.. and I used shitake and oyster mushrooms. Tasty along with osso buco and polenta.

Served  this over polenta(4cups/12cups fluid, 9x13 pan) so I needed a mushroom ragout with a little more sauce. Added 2 cups of vegetable broth with 2 T. flour whisked in to thicken(would have doubled this to serve with remaing polenta). Increased the other sauce ingredients too. Also added garlic and used sour cream. Had to substitute dry marjoram as the grocer did not have any...next time. Great vegetarian main dish. High fives by everyone!

Made this twice. I made no changes to it. Compliments steak very well. Family loves it and ask that I make this regularly.
