These were delicious! I threw 2 chicken breasts in the slow cooker with a bit of chicken broth and taco seasoning the day before, not having a clue what I was going to do with it when it was done. I looked around for what needed to be used up, and I saw an open package of tostadas in the pantry. Did a quick search for "tostadas" and saw bd.weld's gorgeous photo of this recipe and had to make it. I love the sweetness of the mango with the hint of heat from the jalapeno. Super yummy!

A perfect appy or light lunch that's easy to make. I served this up on 4 inch tostada shells.

This is one of my favorites! I slice fresh tortillas into fourths and bake them till crisp. The combination of the avocado and the fruit is what makes them so good, even if there's no chicken. Really delicious with fresh pineapple, too. Everyone I've served them to has loved them. Thanks for the recipe!

I tried to follow the recipe exactly,  but I ended up with two accidental changes. The first was that my mango had a lot of bad spots. I only had about half a mango that was usable.  The second was that I didn't read closely.  I put the juice of both limes in with the chicken mixture. Fortunately, I had another lime for the avocados. 

We enjoyed this very much.  We will definitely be having this, again. I'm looking forward to having it with more mango. Next time I'll buy two mangos just in case!

My family loved this... I used a rotisserie chicken and put the mangos and avocado on the side for the kids.
