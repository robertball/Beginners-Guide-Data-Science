Chef John I want you to know that when I need a great recipe I now search for Chef John. This dressing is fabulous, and since it's February and I only have dried herbs from my garden I used those and it's still excellent. Your creamy horseradish sauce was the absolute hit of Christmas dinner, and I served it with ham recently too, delicious! Please keep em coming!

Fantastic. The Tarragon / Parsley and citrus combo just slaps your 'buds with a big tangy-fresh hello. It's like eating the colour green while sipping on cream.

This was delicious! I made a trial version per the recipe, with the exception that I had to substitute white wine vinegar for the rice vinegar as I had forgotten to purchase it. I found it too tart so the batch I made for the event (as an alternative dipping sauce to shrimp instead of just cocktail sauce)I cut the vinegar and lemon juice in half and the recipe was divine!

This sauce is absolutely divine!! I had to omit the anchovy as my husband is prone to gout and anchovies will bring on an attack almost immediately. But, even so, this was so amazingly good!  Keep 'em coming, Chef John. You're the best!!

Outstanding dressing!  Never knew how to replicate Green Goddess Dressing, til now.   If you are lucky enough, to either have your own herb garden or have access to fresh herbs, you must try this!  ( Sorry, dried herbs are just not the same!)  The combo of herbs is brilliant!  I use this as a dip, a dressing, and even a sandwich spread.   I might sub non fat Greek yogurt for the sour cream next time, just cuz!  If "nature" had a taste, this would be it!
UPDATE...made this again using non-fat Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  It reduces the calories and tastes just great!!   PS....If you don't want to buy a whole tin of anchovies just to use a few, get anchovy paste instead.  It works beautifully and keeps in the frig for months!

This was exceptional!  I made it the first time because I was tasked with "bring(ing) a salad" to a dinner party and everyone raved about it.  I was invited to a Labor Day bbq by the same people and they again asked me to bring a salad while saying "and that dressing from last time would be perfect".   I think that Chef John's Green Goddess dressing was the *real* invitee!

I made it exactly as written without any changes.  It is perfect as written.

I was very pleased with this dressing. I used plain Greek=style yogurt instead of sour cream, and unfortunately I did not have chives on hand. But other than that, I followed the recipe. I appreciated the texture most of all. It was thick enough to coat my salad, but not heavy like many store-bought dressings are. This is a great use for my homegrown herbs (I need to plant some chives now...)

Made precisely as written, as chef John never fails me. Never. Out of this world.  Next time I might add a couple chopped up anchovies.

This is fantabulous!  I could practically drink this stuff.  I love the green color from all the fresh herbs and the whole family gobbled up salad and everything we served with this!  A keeper recipe for sure.

LOVE IT!!!!! I am currently using this as a dip for fries, and the family is gobbling it up. The kids will eat fresh herbs right out of the garden, so I knew they would love this. I did not have any tarragon, so I did add in some cilantro and basil (yes, I know it's not the same thing, but that's the beauty of this dressing, it's a great way to use up a plethora of garden herbs). Oh, and I used light mayo and light sour cream. I will def be making this again and again~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

Chef John you never fail me!  I had green goddess dressing for the first time in a restaurant a few days ago. This was better!  Thanks.  I'm growing herbs in my garden and had everything needed to make this terrific dressing.  This is now a permanent addition to my recipe collection.

I forgot to buy anchovy when I went to the grocery store. I researched a substitution on google and found that Worcestersire sauce is often used to substitute anchovy. I did a few drops and followed the rest of the recipe to the letter. It was a hit and guests of the party I was at all asked me for the recipe. The fresh herbs are the key to this recipe and make it super flavorful.

Lovely & easy to make, but I thought the tarragon overpowered everything. 1/3 cup seems like way too much. Next time I’d do way less.

This is an amazing dressing! Don’t let the sardines deter you, they really give it a nice subtle flavor. I don’t measure my herbs and just use what I have on hand...dill, cilantro, scallions, etc. Any green herb can go into this! You won’t be disappointed. Everyone I share it with is in love with it!

This is incredible !!  I made it with plain yogurt no sugar, and 1/4 cup of pure mayonnaise instead of the S. Cream, and added dried tarragon, and a pinch of rosemary to the list and it is excellent a 10!

I really liked the dressing.  I made  the dressing basically just as the recipe was written.   It had a bit more overpowering mayo taste than I prefer.  I think next time I might use more sour cream or divide mayo in half and use plain yogurt for the balance to add richness without as many calories.  The dressing did have a lovely green fresh color.

Changed tarragon to basil, but still kept one tsp fresh tarragon. Used green onions instead of chives. Made it with anchovy and without anchovy. Without is better, but requires more salt.  I was generous with pepper and that’s good. Didn’t used rice wine vinegar, just generous with the lemon juice. THIS DRESSING IS DELICIOUS!  

I’m going to try adding some dehydrated cucumber and a bit of mint.  We shall see.

This recipe is awesome.  I forgot what homemade dressing could be like.  We are trying to go back to basic eating with low sodium and no high fructose corn syrup or too much sugar.  I did use fresh parsley, however it wasn't Italian parsley.  I used low fat sour cream and since I did not have buttermilk, I added 1 tsp of lemon juice to 1/3 cup of 1% milk.  I did not have tarragon and didn't add the salt.  All in all, I think this dressing is delicious and it will be my go-to recipe for Ranch dressing.

I didn't have fresh tarragon so I used half the amount of dried. It was still very delicious. My family inhaled it! I'm making it again this weekend and will search until I find the fresh tarragon as I'm sure it will be even better.
