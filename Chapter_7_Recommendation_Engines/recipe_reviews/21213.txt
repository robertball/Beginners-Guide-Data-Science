This dish went over really well at our house, Geri.
I sauteed my onions and peppers first, because I prefer them to be "uncrunchy". I beat the eggs with a bit of sour cream, added a few drops of Tabasco Chipotle Pepper Sauce and used a Mexican blend cheese. We didn't have the jalapeno, so I used some diced green chiles instead.
Keeper recipe. Thanks so much~

this was good but if you kinda fry the tomaotes and onions and the other ingredients in the butter (or oil) first and then add the eggs you get more flavor from them.  just somethign i've learned. :)

very good!  I added a little milk to the scramble to make 'em a little fluffier.  Also, sprinkled a little Southwest seasoning.

This was quite delicious! I added a bit more cilantro than called for, but that is just a personal preference. This would be fabulous if you threw in some chorizo sausage. Yum!!

As a beginner chef, this dish gave me no problems. It turned out good, but i would have rathered there been a lil less tortillas than i had put in (4 eggs, 1 corn tortilla torn to pieces). I'm picky when it comes to different textures of food. I sprinkled shredded cheese right when it was done and that added flavor. I also add pieces of bacon while sauteeing(sp) the onions and bell peppers.

It does need salt and pepper..but I didn't think this was bland at all.  My family loved it!

I did use red bell peppers for a little color.

Soooo good!! My husband raised an eyebrow at me while I was cooking but then ended up getting seconds. I only omitted the bell pepper otherwise made like the recipe says.

I added a splash of milk to the beaten eggs, and I too seasoned it with salt and pepper. I used a combination of Monterey Jack and extra-sharp Cheddar cheeses. Not bad at all. Thanks, Geri!

you need a salsa with this dish as it is quite bland and a little pepper would not go a miss.  It is very filling though and with the extras quite nice.
