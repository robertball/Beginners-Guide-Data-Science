This is an excellent cake recipe! I doubled the brown suger, pinapple and melted butter, and it turned out fantastic! I also baked it in a large bundt pan, it took about an extra 12 minutes, and it worked out very well.

This was delicious and I served it for a birthday party and everyone raved.  I love the crushed pineapple on top rather than the rings.  However take my advice and DON'T make it a day in advance.  The cake was a bit dry.  Next time I will make this the day of the party.

Good cake but too big for us so it halves successfully.   I substitute butter for shortening and the taste is deeper and texture better.   This, of course, is to suit our tastes.

Wonderful taste, and simplicity itself.  We couldn't find a bakery that made Pineapple Upsidedown Cake and this recipe was the best one we've tried.
If you like too, add double the amount of brown sugar, butter and juice for
the topping to really indulge yourself.

I did not like this cake at all..I think it calls for way too much flour because it's very dense, almost like you're eating pudding. (It's definitely not undercooked...just very dense.)  Too bad I made it for a luncheon today. :( lol

I altered the original recipe and new version is a 5 star, according to my guests.  (1) Buttered 2 layer cake 9" pans w/melted real Butter; then melted 4 Tbls. Butter divided into 2 Tbls. separately into 2 small bowls of 1/2 Cup packed Brown Sugar w/1 Tbls. Pineapple Juice in ea. small bowl. Mixed each well, then placed sliced Pineapple 1/2 circles onto mixture in each pan. (Used 1 and 1/2 cans 15 oz. each Sliced Pineapple)  (2) I used "Duncan Hines Moiste Deluxe BUTTER Golden Recipe" cake mix in which I used 2/3 Cup Pineapple Juice instead of water, 3 Eggs, 1 Stick Real BUTTER softened; beat 4 minutes at 150 strokes per minute; poured 1/2 of batter into the 2  9" pans over the Pineapple/Sugar mixture.  (3) Baked 350 oven 20 min.  Cooled 15 min. Turned out perfect even though I did not have cherries on hand.  This was prepared to serve guests and it was a hit.  Far better tasting cake than found in stores or bakery shops! Submitted Oct. 7, 2010

The cake part is fairly bland, I added about 1/8 to 1/4 tsp of almond flavoring. Improved the taste! The Pineapple bottom is yummy.
I still prefer the Dunkin Hinze recipe that uses boxed yellow cake.

This cake is rather time consuming for such a simple recipe.  If more flavorful, it would have been worth the extra effort.

PERFECT. I knew this was the recipe for me b/c of everyone saying it was too bland. My fave versions are fluffy and biscuity and not really cakey... this was awesome. The #1 trick is to get the brown sugar, butter, and pineapple cooking while you make the cake and when it's bubbling pour the batter on, it makes a big difference.

I made this for a friends birthday as a healthier birthday cake, and everyone loved it, and could have cared less about missing the sugary frosting and icing! I sived a small bit of brown sugar on the bottom of the pan to give it a more "crystally" appearence and added some green and red marichino charries, quartered into the mix to give it a bit more color.

I baked this cake for my dad's 75 b-day. It was very good and I would have given it five stars except that it makes too much batter to fit the specified pan and is not quite as moist as a good cake should be. 

  The juice in the batter gave the cake a nice flavor and the glaze was yummy. I wish I had made extra to drizzle over the slices. The texture baked up rather pound cake-like. Everyone enjoyed it.

 I was sorry I had not greased the pan as recommended and as noted by another reviewer; I sprayed it with vegetable spray and although I let the cake cool for quite awhile, some of the pineapple and glaze stuck to the pan. No matter. This is a great version of the traditional favorite.

I loved this cake but did make a few changes; I doubled the brown sugar and used one can of crushed and one can of pineapple tidbits for the topping. I omitted the cherries - too sickly sweet for me. I used butter instead of shortening and  I also doubled the vanilla. After reading the reviews, I  was concerned the cake was going to be too dense but it was just perfect - light and airy with just the right sweetness. What would I do differently next time? I would caramelize the brown sugar prior to mixing with pineapple. I would also like to try this with either coconut or almond extract - both work so well with pineapple. Note: I did not give it a 5 because of the adjustments necessary to the recipe however with the changes made  - it was def a 5!

Loved the cake! It was my first time making this cake one spontaneous Saturday and I think it came out pretty well. It was a little too sweet for me, so the next time I make it I will probably decrease the white sugar by maybe a 1/2 cup. Overall it was moist and most importantly homemade.

I absolutely love pineapple.  There aren't too many ways you can serve it that I won't eat it, but I was not at all impressed with this recipe.  It came out more like a shortcake and was way too dry.  I waited a day as the recipe suggested and still wasn't happy.  I will definitely be looking for another recipe.

This recipe makes the most delicious cake! I halved the recipe, used oil instead of butter (making sure to cream the sugar and oil together very thoroughly with an electric mixer), baked it in an 8x8 pyrex pan and it still turned out great! This is possibly the very best cake I have ever tasted! Thanks for this great recipe!

I didn't read these reviews until the cake was in the oven, then turned down the temp to 325, then 300, to try to avoid overcooking and dryness that other reviewers have noted. Cake turned out good, not dry, but definitely too sweet. If I make it again I will cut back the suger significantly

I added 1/4 cup extra water and baked an extra 5 minutes since lots of people complained it was dry... It was an ok cake, looked a mess out of the pan so I didn't bother taking a picture.  I think I'll keep looking for one like my Mom used to make.. Taste was different!

This cake is delish! Probably one of the best upside down pineapple cakes I have made. I put the batter in a 9 by 9 inch pan instead of a 9 by 13 and it rose high and beautiful. I did not spray my pan enough, thinking the butter in the syrup would be sufficient, so about half of the brown sugar syrup was left in the pan when I tried to invert it. So, it did not look as pretty as I wanted it to be. I made a brown-sugar, pineapple glaze to cover up the bare spots. All in all-some mistakes on my part-but delicious!

This recipe is a no brainer! I'm a that's close enough type of guy. I used about a cup of butter flavored Crisco. Pretty much the same measurment for the rest of the stuff. Came out perfect! It was quick, easy and even tasted great! Will do this one again! It's a keeper folks!

Makes a very large cake, and tastes like flour! When I flipped the cake the whole topping stuck to the pan, so i had to scrape it off and spread it back on! The only way my family would eat it was with custard or ice cream. Will not make again.

WOW!!!  So moist and flavorful!  I made it in a Bundt pan rather than 13x9, so it took a little longer to bake, but it was sooooo good!  I will definitely be baking this again!

I just made this kind of cake for the first time.  I halved the recipe and it came out perfectly!  I did make a few adjustments: I used pineapple rings instead of crushed pineapple and near the end I added powder sugar because the batter didn't taste sweet enough.  I also ran out of vanilla so used almond extract for about 1 t.  I put the pineapple down before I put the sauce down, but it still came out great.  It was like angels food cake and was delish!  I highly recommend this for those who want a nice dessert to share!

A beautiful cake, but I must agree with some of the other comments... The cake itself is bland on its own. All it has for flavor is a little vanilla and sugar.  Next time I'll try some of the variations with crushed pineapple in the batter.  I also like pecans and extra brown sugar-butter mixture for the top...

This was very good.  Moist and tasty.  The only thing that went wrong was the cake cracked in 3 places when I flipped it out of the baking pan.  It was still very good though.  Maybe if you let it cool in the pan a little longer it wouldn't do that.  Also, I used pineapple slices instead of crushed pineapple and put cherry halves in the middle of the slices.

Complete disaster!  While the cake and topping had a good flavor, the whole thing fell apart when I tried to remove it from the pan.  I would recommend using a well-seasoned cast iron pan or at the very least, round 9-inch cake pans.  Also, consider sliced, not crushed pinapple.

4.9.13 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/8406/pineapple-upside-down-cake-iii/ ... So weird how submitter's names change.  Originally, as in 2003, when I first tried this, it was from Nancy.  No big deal, I guess.  Just need to remember to save all recipes.  Ha!  Save all recipes, allrecipes?!? ... okay, okay ... :D ... I subbed sliced peaches & 2/3c peach syrup & 2/3c milk for the part where you add water to the pineapple juice to make 1 1/3cups.  Also added 1t salt to balance the sugar, which I reduced to 1c in the cake part.  This one is better than my Good Housekeeping Illustrated Cookbook one I've been using.  Thanks!

This was the first time I've ever made this cake before. Everyone loved it and it tasted great! I did double the brown sugar and butter as others suggested and if I didn't I don't think it would have tasted as good. I also substituted half the milk with pineapple juice and it came out very moist. Will make this again next year!

i halved the recipe and used butter instead of shortening. pretty yummy if you ask me! the cake part coud be bland but if you use a coconut extract instead of vanilla or a dash of rum you can liven up the flavor! i used a tsp of rum with the brown sugar and pineapples. so good!

I did not like this cake at all, the cake part was so thick that I could not even taste the pinapple on the bottom.  Maybe if I half the recipe for the cake? My hubby and I both had one piece and threw the rest out, dont think I will make this recipe again.

I'm excited because, even though I made a few changes, this cake turned out great! My only criticism is that the author put "shortening" and "butter" in the ingrediants and then referred to "margerine" in the instructions; it was confusing.

although the directions said a 13 x 9 pan, the picture shown is of a bundt pan, which i wanted to make because i liked the way it looked versus a rectangle.  it took alot longer to bake, almost 20 mins, and it's too much batter.  so if anyone wants to use the bundt pan, just make a small round pan in addition.  otherwise, DELICIOUS!!!!!

I didn't really care for it...my husband and daughter liked it though. They said it wasn't their favorite, but it was okay.  Made exactly according to original directions. It has potential, but I would look and see if anyone offers small changes.

Very straight forward. The pineapple topping was too much for the pan I wanted to use so I used the extra in place of the water that was to be added to the drained “juice” to make 1 1/3 cups. I also don’t use shortening so I replaced that with nearly equal parts coconut oil and left over mashed potatoes (from scratch). I also added half of a vanilla bean and 1/2 tsp cardamom.

I always make it from scratch. No matter what recipe I use, I double the brown sugar and butter and cook until smooth, caramelized. I use sliced pineapple, maraschino in the middle of the slices and put the crushed pineapple around filling all the open spaces so everyone will get pineapple!

I made it an I wasn't nt really impressed with it, I couldn't flip the cake because the crushed pineapples were to moist after cooking and stuck to my glass pan. If I make it again I'll use while pineapples and increase the sugar a little both sugars.

I substiputed butter for the shortening, 3/4 c of honey for the sugar, and gluten free flour for the regular flour.  I loved the texture and the honey gave it a mild sweetness without being overpowering.

I made this recipe twice. The first time I made it I did just as the  recipe called for and like the other reviews I did find it to be not a very flavorful cake and although plenty moist it almost tasted like it was going to be dry. So I doubled the vanilla and I also beat the shortening in the eggs together first to get some air into them which is what I do on a carrot cake recipe I have and it actually makes the cake be a little less heavy and more airy.  I also doubled the topping that someone had written. I used one can of crushed pineapple and one can of the pineapple tidbits and it came out great.

This Upside down cake is to die for.  It is so good!  It is not to sweet  with the right balance of fruit and sugars.  It seemed to me to be a lot of sugars and butters.  But to my surprise it was perfect.  Definitely reminded me of when I was a little girl at home.  Try this one tonight.

Very easy recipe if you have the ingredients. I also cut the recipe in half. I used butter instead of shortening & increased the butter, brown sugar and pineapple in the 1st part of the recipe. Yum, Yum!

Ohhh boy!  I made this for Thanksgiving and it disappeared amidst a table of amazing pumpkin pie, a variety of cheese cake bites and other Thanksgiving dessert deliciousness!  

You gotta make it! 

The most moist cake I have ever made!!

I made no changes.  

Next time, I would just decrease the amount of sugar since the brown sugar and pineapple topping makes it sweet enough!  and mayble I'll ad a bit of rum!

ENJOY!

I used fresh pineapple crushed in my food chopper. I sifted dry ingredients twice yet the cake itself was that of a baking mix I'd use for blackberry dumplings--that is what it tasted like; which, if it were any better, the cake would have disappeared quicker. Some cakes are better the next day. The edges of the cake has a delightful crunch on the edge and the brown sugar and butter complimented the sweet pineapple. Next time I will use 3/4 C. less flour, but will add 1/3 C. corn starch to lighten it up.

Holy heck! This recipe is delicious! I didnt have butter or shortening last night so I used vegetable oil, instead. I used half dark brown sugar and half liht brown sugar since that was all I had left. I also used a second can of fruit that I wont mention and combined both the second can of fruit juice and the crushed pineapple juice together. I didnt measure the juice but I assumed it was 1-1/3 cup of juice. I added no water at all. 

Then I read the reviews while it was baking. I read that some people's cake came out dry, that there was too much flour, that they doubled up on brown sugar, that it was too sweet, that ot wasnt sweet enough, that they used three eggs instead of two, or that theirs was not undercooked but it was dense and too wet, or undercooked. 

So therefore...

When it was i finished, I checked it and it was moist and undercooked a bit. I turned the oven off and put the pan back in for five minutes, checked it again, put it back in for five minutes, then checked it, then put it back in for five minutes, equaling fifteen minutes and it was perfectly done. Waited five minutes, flipped it, and it was great! 

This cake is delicious, moist, baked to perfection, stayed moist today (i put it in the fridge over night), light yet dense, and ADDICTING. We cant stop eating it! 

You have to be passionate about food when following a recipe and use your instincts. Dont give up on something because it didnt turn out correctly. I want to make this for a pool party this w

I looked over several recipes and reviews before choosing this one. I made this exactly as stated, except I used solid coconut oil in the recipe instead of shortening and it was the best tasting pineapple upside down cake ever!  It was very moist and flavorful and so easy to make that I no longer need to look for another recipe! My husband now wants this every year for his birthday cake...

I made this cake as is except added cherries.  It was just ok...  I was unable to flip the cake out of the pan because it there was too much liquid on the bottom.  The cake part was done.  There seemed to be too much flour.  My cake overflowed a little.  It had more of a cobbler look than a cake.

This cake tastes delicious and is light and moist, but I've made it twice in 2 different kinds of pans and when I turn it upside down, it falls apart.  I followed the instructions about preparing the pan and letting it sit for 5 minutes and the topping just sticks and the cake falls apart.   Maybe it's just me??

I made this with a proportion of 1 cup Stevia and 1/2 cup sugar. It worked very well. The cake tasted just like it would had I used regular sugar. The texture was not affected by the trade out either. If I had not said anything, no one would have guessed. I did not use Stevia in the pineapple topping mixture, I kept the same proportion of brown sugar in the pineapple mixture as the recipe used.
Also, due to the fact that I didn't have my big platter available, I made it as a "right side up" cake, baked it and added the pineapple mixture after baking.. It worked very well and I was able to serve it right from the 9x13 pan. Family loved it!

PROS: I substituted 2 sticks of butter. Delicious, easy to make, VERY moist, fits perfectly in a 13x9 pan, feeds a crowd. This will be my new go-to recipe for yellow cake! (I made it the traditional way, with the pineapple rings.) 

CONS: We found it too sweet for our personal taste. So I made it a second time. Used 1/2 cup brown sugar in the topping, and decreased the white sugar in the batter to 1 cup. Perfect for us! Thank you for sharing!

I thought the flour would be too much (3 cups) but it was fine. Be sure to use all the juice and add enough water to make 1 1/3 cups of liquid as per recipe. However, even after letting cake cool for 30 min. rather than the recipe's 5 (as per other's suggestions), the toppings stuck to bottom of pan. Perhaps i will butter the pan even more heavily next time; don't know why else it would have stuck like that. Tastes good, though!!

This cake is delicious and reliable, and it scales easily. It may have too much baking powder, though. It leaves a strange skin on your teeth. Also, it does much better in a flatter, wider pan. The deeper the pan, the less likely it is to bake all the way through before the surface gets too brown. 

Depending on the pan, you can easily make the topping as per recipe, but reduce the batter by 1/3 (keep the eggs the same).

The topping was delish! but the cake for me was not good. I added the almond extract as some suggested, which did give it a nice flavor. Some of you said yours was very dense, mine was really flaky but just lacked flavor. My husband on the other hand really likes it.

I thought this recipe was very good. I took other reviews advise and doubled the butter, brown sugar, and pineapples. I also used whole wheat flour.

Easy to make! I read the recipe so fast I didn't realize it called for Crushed pineapples, so I ended up using the sliced circles. Worked out VERY well for me. Accidently had the oven rack too high and the top (bottom?LOL) started to burn a little, so I put some foil over it when it had about 15 mins left to cook. Turned out Excellent!! It's a great dessert. My whole family loved it! We will add this to our menu! (It's not a rich and powerful dessert, but it's great tasting, easy, and quick (quick as far as completely home-made desserts go). Thanks so much!

I was disappointed with this cake.  I read the reviews and most talked about its great flavor, well I followed the recipe but the cake did not have alot of flavor.  The first time I made it with pineapple in it's own juice so I thougth that was the problem.  I made it agian with pineapple in heavy syrup, double the brown sugar and butter for the topping and double the vanilla extract.  It tasted a little better but was still missing something.  Maybe I'll try again and add salt.  I really liked the texture of the cake very moist but not heavy.
