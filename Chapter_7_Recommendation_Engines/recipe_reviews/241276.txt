Tastes great, make sure you dry your spinach well.  I didn't on the first batch and it was a little runny instead of creamy, just added another avocado and it was fine. My husband loves spinach, but could take or leave avocado.  I love avocado, but could take or leave spinach.  We both loved this recipe.

One word - YUM!  My garlic clove was BIG and if you're not a fan of garlic, use a small one.  I love garlic so it's just fine for me.  I have a friend who likes Guacamole dip but says it's "too fattening".  I told her about the fresh spinach - she's hooked on it now and makes it with chopped tomatoes & Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and dips her veggies in it.  One of the first appetizers to go at my get togethers'.  Thanks for sharing!

I highly recommend making a double batch, this is that good. Just the right amount of spiciness from the jalapeno and hot sauce.

I didn't have lime juice so I used lemon. I didn't have low-fat sour cream, so I used regular. I didn't have a jalapeno, so I used green pepper. I didn't have a red onion, so I used a yellow. But it turned out just great . . Ha-Ha! 

PS, I didn't use it as a dip, I used it on a pizza . . Great with fresh mushrooms, hamburger and mozzarella!

I had to amend it a little due to what I had in the cupboards, but it was delicious and I can only imagine that the unaltered version is even better.

Followed the recipe to the letter and will in the future. I can't imagine this getting any better. I would like to think the use of my homemade smoked hot pepper sauce took it from 4 stars to 5, but we'll never know.

I didn’t add the jalapeño, and used a yellow sweet onion instead of the red, but otherwise I followed the recipe. It was so fresh and delicious!  We used it on burritos and in sandwiches, and it added so much flavor and creaminess! Will definitely make again.

Great and nutritious.   As long as you cover it with plastic wrap (lay the plastic wrap directly on the dip and push out as much air as you can) it holds up very well and resists browning in the refrigerator for something with avocados in it.

Very easy to make if you have the ingredients. A little tart for me. I would use a little less lime juice next time.

I processed this in a 1 1/2 pint regular mouth jar on the blender base. It took that much with the raw spinach volume, but made one pint of utter deliciousness! Love. This. Recipe!

Not a fan, but it is just me.  Couldn't really taste the avocado--- kind of tasted like a weak hummus.  That said,  I love the idea of it and plan to try it again and tweak it.  Maybe add more lemon/lime juice?

I added everything except the pine nuts. I was looking for somersetting with spinach and this met the requirements. The balance of the ingredients was exceptional.

Very good. Even my my-way-is-the-right-way, mother-in-law enjoyed it. Made slight alterations: used superfood power greens, used Forager Cashewgurt, less onion, no peppers. Wanted to make it palatable for my picky kids...and animal-byproduct free.

I made it by the recipe except for using full fat sour cream. It was delicious, my guests loved it. Next morning,  served it over scrambled eggs in pita bread, also good. The recipe makes a lot, but I think leftovers would be good over baked chicken or even pork. I would try it over fish, as well.

Delicious! I will be using this as a vegetable dip, to put on hamburgers and anything else I can think of. I didn't have the peppers on hand so I just used a dash of cayenne.

I added more acid, salt, and cream to try to balance it out and knock down the strong avacado flavor. I won't be using this recipe again :(

This dip is wonderful!  I  subbed a Serrano pepper for the jalapeño,  using the whole thing., but otherwise followed the recipe.  This was very well received and I'll definitely be making it again!   Thanks for the recipe!

This was good, we would have liked a little more kick and so next time might add just a little chili flakes or any other type of heat. Avocado was the primary taste.

We enjoyed this a lot. I made the mistake of just squeezing a lime into the food processor bowl instead of measuring.  That was not the thing to do as it overpowered the flavors of the spinach and avocado.  I added more avocado to try and balance the flavors out, then added some cilantro when that wasn't quite enough.  So the next time I make this, I will measure the lime.  My additions made it taste like guacamole which was ok for our Mexican themed dinner but next time I will definitely follow the recipe.  We had this topped on Veggie Burgers (the ones made with oatmeal) from AR and enjoyed the flavors.
