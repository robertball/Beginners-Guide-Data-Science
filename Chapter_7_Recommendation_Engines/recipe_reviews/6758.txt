i've used this recipe to make dinner rolls for several years now and have always been foolproof.  the directions may be a bit strange but it works.  After working with this recipe for a long time, i've done some tweaking: i add the salt only after i've added the flour.  Salt retards yeast growth.  Also, when the dough is way too sticky to knead, just add flour a little at a time til it's workable.  To this basic recipe, I sometimes add in 1/2 cup grated cheddar cheese together with the margarine to make cheese flavored rolls. Yumm! Also, i avoid making the dough rise in a too warm place (i don't know with other bakers but the too warm environment just makes the "yeasty" taste stronger.  you definetely don't want that).  When shaping them into buns/rolls, pound out all the air bubbles that have formed during rising (and when we say pound, i mean POUND!).  This makes for a much milder tasting roll.

This recipe is the answer to my love/hate relationship with making bread.  Love the taste, hate the work!  This is a great recipe.  If anyone's results were biscuit like, then you did something wrong.  Here's the thing with bread recipes...don't worry about the recipe's rise times.  Use your judgment because invironment, yeast age, etc. plays a huge role in how long it will take.  I added less than half a cup of flour at the end, during the light kneading...yes, it was still sticky, but my rolls turned out beautiful, light, and airy.  I alse brushed the rolls with egg wash prior to baking to create a lovely shiny top.  I made 24 small rolls and 5 large sandwich rolls with this recipe.  If it didn't work for you, try again.  It's a great roll...just be patient with the rise times...sometimes it takes longer than suggested.  Also let the dough be a little sticky...it allows lighter rolls.

Great recipe- nice and fluffy rolls.   After reading the reviews on this recipe, and seeing that many had trouble getting them to rise; I decided to try this recipe changing a couple of the methods used. 1st I proofed my yeast using the 3/4 cup water called for in the recipe- get it hot out of the tap- if it feels too warm to take a shower in then it's too hot  and will kill the yeast.  Put 1 tpblspn of the 1/2cup sugar  and the 5tsp of yeast into the warm water, and give it 5 minutes.  The yeast is ready when it's foamy if it doesn't get foamy try again, and if it doesn't get foamy a 2nd time- your yeast is probably too old.  I never use the stove to heat ingredients for bread recipes- it's too hard to control the heat.  Heat the milk in the microwave, 30 to 50 seconds- again if you stick your pinky in it and it feels too hot to take a shower in- it's too hot.  I then mixed my milk, yeast water and sugar and eggs.  I put the salt in with the flour, and followed the recipe exactly after that.  I made my rolls quite a bit smaller, and got 36 nice sized perfect rolls.  The whole family agrees this is one of the best roll recipe they've ever eaten.

 Note to  Bowie 112- most roll or bread dough can be frozen before the last rising. Shape as desired, put on wax paper on baking sheet,spray the wax paper with cooking spray to make frozen rolls easier to lift, when frozen put into zip locked freezer bag. Pull out the number you wish to use in the morning,  put on baking sheet,

For JOYCEMOSER - you questioned why your rolls turned out hard - you might have killed the yeast with your heated mixture being too hot when combined with the yeast.  When heating liquid for a recipe - make sure it is not hotter than 105-115 degrees F.  The other thing to check is the expiration date of your yeast - old yeast will not rise.  (I've even found old yeast on grocery store shelves - so check it before you buy it.)  HOpe this helps!

Unbelieveable? Yes, ma'am! I used my Kitchen Aid mixer to make these rolls. I proofed the yeast (two packages, for those who wonder how much yeast to actually use) with the warm water and sugar for ten minutes, then added the milk (I used lowfat buttermilk), melted butter, eggs and all the dry ingredients. I did need just a touch more flour than the recipe stated to get it to form into a ball and jump on the bread hook. I kneaded it in the Kitchen Aid with the dough hook for about five minutes or more, adding more flour when the dough would stick to the bottom of the mixer bowl. I set it to rise in a greased bowl on my heating pad for an hour, then formed them into rolls and plopped them into greased muffin tins (about a heaping 1/4 cup for each roll?), covered them and set them to rise on my heating pad until they doubled. Right before baking, I lightly brushed them with a little melted butter. 400* for 15 minutes was absolutely perfect. HUGE dinner rolls that were soft, fluffy and absolutely wonderful. Bakery quality. What a wonderful recipe! NOTE: Watch these in the oven, they do have quick minute or two where they could burn. I almost had that happen but I caught it just in time.

These live up to their name! They are tender, buttery, melt-in-your-mouth balls of heaven. As for people who can't seem to make them "fluffy", I have a couple of tips (as a former pastry chef). First, yeast is VERY Sensitive to High Heat. Make sure that you heat up the liquid and sugar 'til it's "Very warm" but not HOT! Otherwise, you'll kill the yeast. Also, add the yeast and mix it completely. Then add the eggs. Also, I substituted butter for margarine

I have never made rolls before so I tried this recipe because of so many glowing reviews.  I tried this recipe twice, and was disappointed both times.  My rolls really didn't rise, and they were coarse and heavy.  I suspect the problem is with me, not the recipe. Can someone tell me what I did wrong?

I hope that this will help some of you out there making my roll recipe.  I think the basic problem with making these is the temperture of the water and milk recipe.  Do not let it exceed 105 to 110 degrees. I also add the sugar and salt and stir to disolve before I add the yeast and the eggs.  I do use heated water from my hot water dispenser and then add the milk to it and it always seems to be the right temperature.  Also perhaps the eggs should be at room temp as they can cool down the milk/water liquid too much and the yeast wont work as well.  Another hint is to stir well so that the flour is incorperated almost to the point of kneading after you add the butter and then sprinkle with a bit of flour so it doesnt stick to the bowl.  I knead as little as possible and only when I turn it out on the board to make the rolls.  Let it rest a bit if you think you knead too much so it can relax again.  To make cinnamon rolls, I spread with 1/2 cup of really soft butter, sprinkle with 1/2 to 3/4 cup brown sugar mixed with 1 an 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon and then add chopped nuts. I hope this helps those of you who are having problems.  It is a fun dough to work with for making many different things.  Please check out the photo of the cinnamon roll made in the mini bundt pan and you will see what you can make.  These turned out delicious and crusty all the way around.

I just finished baking these rolls and my house smells wonderful. They look and taste great too.
I read thru the reviews and I'd like to offer a little help to those who had difficulty with this recipe: you MUST use margarine NOT butter, & add more flour while you knead this dough a bit. This is not a Baking 101 recipe, if it was, there'd be more detail. These were delicious and I hope you give them another try, as my family really liked them. They are a "keeper" - thank you Sherlie.

Well, i made these rolls and I gotta say that I was definately disappointed. I followed the recipe to the T. They rose beautifully and looked wonderful, but when I bit into them, they were dense, too sweet, and just not appetizing. Sorry, I was looking for a softer, fluffier, and more savory dinner roll, Im gonna stick to our family recipe.

Very tasty, but my roll required more that a light kneading.  Also, I added at least an extra 1/2 cup flour through the kneading process.  I then put the rolls in a muffin pan to help them keep shape.

They look better than they taste, big disappointment! They look great but taste terrible, but they do not taste bad enough not to eat them, but they taste bad enough not to make them again. I guess it is because of the egg, but eggs usually taste good in rolls, but the combination tasted bad, even with buttering the rolls.

These are SUPER EASY and lovely. I hate to rate these at all as I made quite a few changes, but honestly, so good.  The family is BEGGING for more, but they have to wait until supper. ;)  I used part whole wheat flour plus a couple Tbsp. vital wheat gluten to lighten them up.  Also, cream in the place of milk.  And I totally forgot to add the 1/2 cup fat (of which I used a combo of butter and shortening) to the mixture before I stirred it all together, so I just poured the melted fats over the already mixed dough and used my hands to fully incorporate it in the bowl, then kneaded it for less than 5 minutes on an unfloured counter top...with all the grease, no flour was necessary!!  I returned it to the bowl for the 20 minute raise, overturned it on my already greased counter, cut it into 16 portions, rolled each piece around under a cupped hand on the counter top for perfectly rounded rolls, placed 1 inch apart on a parchment lined cookie sheet, covered loosely for the final 30 minute raise.  I brushed it with an egg wash and baked for the 15 minutes suggested.  Perfect! Perfect! Ok, texturally, PERFECT.  Flavor-wise, these are a bit on the sweet side.  Easily modified, but for those who have a dislike for sweet bread with your... soup, for example, this might not be the recipe you are looking for. Just sayin'. UPDATE: Made these again for Easter dinner using only 1/4 cup sugar and they were PERFECT - texturally and tastefully perfect!  LOVE this recipe!!!

I've made these twice.  I followed the recipe per the previous review. - proof your yeast for 5 minutes in warm (like bath water) water with a tablespoon of the sugar required for the recipe.  I then heated up my milk in the microwave for about 40 seconds and added the eggs, remaining sugar and milk to my yeast.  I accidentally (this last time) added in the melted butter before you had to let the yeast mixture sit in the flour for 20-30 mins.  I also make sure my flour is room temp or warm.  I keep my flour in the freezer, so I take out the 5 cups and heat it up in the microwave until its warm to the touch (I heat it 30 seconds, take it out and stir and heat again for another 30 seconds, repeat as necessary) and then add my yeast mixture once you create a funnel in the flour.  I then follow the recipe as stated.  When I let it rise I preheat my oven to 100 degrees and let it sit in the oven.  I think next time I'll add a touch more salt.  I like to have my rolls a little buttery/salty.  I suppose you could also add salt into the melted butter that you can spread on top of the rolls when they are finished.  This is a fantastic recipe!  Last year I tried at least 5 different times to make yeast rolls.  This was the first recipe that I actually succeeded at :]

These rolls have a great taste and are very light, even though mine were a bit flat looking.  I don't make bread very often, so I wasn't sure how much kneading is required for a "light knead".  The dough rose beautifully, but the rolls weren't nice and round and puffy looking like the picture posted.  I would make these again though. NOTE: I just read up on kneading technique on the Allrecipes site and I don't think that I kneaded the dough enough to get the buns to puff up.  I will try this again but knead for about 8 minutes.

Wonderful flavor, great texture- the only thing I will do differently next time is lower the temperature on my oven to 375 since the bottoms of my rolls started to smoke at about 10 minutes into baking.  It is critical that you do not heat up the milk mixture or the melted butter too much- this will kill the yeast as other reviewers have said and ruin the batch.

These came out awesome. I had to add a little flour to make sure they weren't to sticky but and I would definitley cook them for less time (my ovencooks really hot, so the bottom crust got burned, but no matter, cut them off and ate them anyways). They were terrific fresh out of the oven, but even better the second day as a sandwich. They came out light and fluffy (but not crumbly)and with a great flavour. My husband loved them and I will definitely make these again and I can wait to try them as a loaf. Thanks for the great recipe.

I made half cinnamon rolls and half dinner rolls.  This recipe made the best cinnamon rolls I've ever tried, however, my dinner rolls were "rocks" - could have just been me, though.  Roll out two squares to make cinnamon rolls and  brush with melted margarine.  Sprinkle LOTS of cinnamon mixed with sugar on top.  Roll each square and cut 1/2-inch slices brushed with melted margarine and bake at 375.  Make powdered sugar/milk/vanilla icing and enjoy!  Kids loved it, too.

I'm mean with a cake or cookie, but a complete novice with anything involving yeast.  The few times I've tried before have been barely edible.  But not these!  I followed the instructions and ingredients exactly, with two exceptions: 1) I added the salt later, as another review suggested, and 2) I did one more round of kneading right before I shaped them into rolls and put them on the cookie sheet.  I did that because the dough didn't seem to have that elastic, springy feel that I know it's supposed to have.  In just a couple minutes they had that elasticity I was looking for so I stopped.  The dough was still a little bit sticky when I shaped the rolls.  I barely fit all 16 rolls onto my sheet, and they turned out perfect.  They are light inside, and while I can sort of see why some said it had a biscuit-like texture inside, that's a bit of a stretch.  All I can say is, for reviewers who say theirs didn't rise, or they were dense or hard, that's a user error.  Try again.  This rookie made them and they turned out just like the photos posted.    These were great with honey butter and tea.  These were good as buns for sliders.  These were good sopping up soup.  I can see how these would be very good dough for cinnamon rolls.  I think next time I may add some flavor to the dough; garlic or onion powder, some herbs, and try for something a little more savory, just to see what happens.

I made this recipe for the holidays and everyone loved them. If you are using packaged yeast use 2. Very light and great taste, used my mixer to knead the bread. GREAT RECIPE!

I have tried hard to find a good roll recipe, because we like to try to be healthy and rolls typically have a lot of butter to make them flaky. This one my husband (whose mother makes good rolls) approves of very highly. It is sweet probably due to the milk and easy to shape. I love the lack of much cleaning up to do afterwards. The only thing I had to change was putting it in a warmed oven to let them rise. Otherwise they don't rise and are too dense. But with that change, they come out perfectly.

This recipe was an unbelievable boon to me.  I have recommended it to several others.  When my mom made rolls, it took hours.  I was looking for something tasty, simple and easy.  This has become MY roll recipe.  BTW, I use rapid rise yeast for these.  I've tried it without, but they don't come out as light.

WOW!  I finally found a recipe for rolls that rates out of this world with my family!  THANK YOU!  I ran out of white flour and used 1 cup of wheat so they had a whole grain flavor.  I can't wait to make cinnimon buns tomorrow :-).

These rolls are the best. I have used them many times now and I get rave reviews everytime. I do brush the tops with a little melted butter just before baking, it gives them a little extra buttery flavor. I have also used this recipe to make bread loaves. Instead of making them into rolls I split the ball of dough in half and put into two bread pans. I let them rise 20-30 minutes and make a slit down the center of each loaf and drizzle some melted butter down the center of each loaf and bake for about 15-20 minutes. Makes a very yummy bread.

I will have to say that these rolls are better than the other rolls I made on here.  If your looking for a easy and less messy roll recipe this is the one.It is the easiest recipe for bread that I have tried and will make again.

I made these for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone was amazed!  I doubled the recipe and made the rolls into a rosette shape.  It was super easy and everyone loved them.  The recipe made more than I thought though.  I think I planned on having 32 total, but I ended up with 42 and they were huge!  I will definately make these again.

I didn't have any luck with this recipe. I've made buns several times and a lot of bread in the past and I've never had a failure like this. I followed the recipe exactly but they didn't turn out very well. The buns wouldn't roll into balls on the counter so they weren't smooth at all. I found them to have a strange taste to them too - I don't know if it was yeast but whatever it was, it wasn't good. After making a pan of buns I decided to try a small loaf of bread and a few cinnamon buns as well. The bread rose nicely but I don't like the way it tastes. The cinnamon buns were the only thing that turned out decently, but things usually do when they're covered in sugar and butter. lol I really wanted to like this recipe because it was easy but it just didn't work out.

I made these for the first time today & they came out wonderfully light and fluffy. They look EXACTLY like the ones pictured here.  The only thing I would do different is add more salt or sugar (as my family likes bread with more of a distinct flavor). I might even try cheese or garlic next time. As did another reviewer, I let my yeast sit in warm water & a tbsp of sugar before I mixed it with the other ingredients ("just-in-case"). Other than that, I followed everything to the T. Also, I wasn't sure what the difference was b/w using an egg wash & just butter, so I tried half with butter on top & the other with egg wash. The egg wash made the bread brown faster and quite shiny. The butter required a longer cooking time to make the rolls come out brown...but not much shine. It also made it crispier/flakier on top (I think).  Either way, they both came out really good.  Thank you so much for the recipe! P.s.: I didn't knead the dough for very long either. Just added flour & kneaded until no longer too sticky. Then stuck back in the bowl for another 30 minutes. Amazingly easy for this first time roll maker! :)

Wow these really are fool proof! If I can make them, then anyone can! 
I thought for sure they were going to be awful as the dough hardly rose, and I'm pretty sure I didn't knead long enough, but sure enough those little babies went in the oven and came out looking like bakery ones! 
Tasted great too! a little yeasty but I can deal!

I too am very disappointed both my mother and I made these rolls in two different houses for Thanksgiving, had "non- expired" yeast and followed the directions to the T and both recipes made by two different people never rose. Disappointed ! Glad we are going back to the family recipe that takes the equal amount of time.

I made this in my bread machine on the dough cycle.  I mixed all the liquid ingredients (with heated milk of course) and mixed in the remaining ingredients as directed by the manufacturer.  I also used butter and bread flour for its higher protein content.  Turns out I only needed 5 cups exactly as stated in the recipe.  The dough came out elastic and slightly sticky - perfect for forming dough IMHO.  These rolls bake up as perfect spheres and have a subtle buttery taste (didn't taste sweet to me).  I had to bake at 350F for 11 minutes though - must be my oven or my flour because 400F @ 15 minutes would've burnt my rolls.          UPDATE: I've made this a few more times now, and I've noticed that the dough is more manageable and holds it shape better with BREAD flour than all purpose flour.  Definitely use real butter for flavor.  You can turn these into hamburger or hot dog buns or even submarine rolls.

These did not turn out for me. I think the recipe needs to be specific. For example, how warm should the milk be? Can I use a glass, metal or plastic bowl? Does it matter if you use margarine or butter? My dough was as sticky as biscuit dough, but I didn't know how much more flour to add. Should I do a tablespoon or half cup or what? This was too much trouble and rather than trying to figure it out myself I'll stick to other yeast roll recipes I've had better luck with. Thanks anyway :)

I cook for our church supper every wednesday night, about 45-60 people. They LOVED these rolls. I had little old ladies wrapping them with napkins and stuffing them in their purses to take home. Well done! so so so easy. Thank you for sharing. If yours were biscuit like, check your yeast, or maybe your water wasnt hot enough. Mine were perfect and very easy to make

I made these because they sounded like they would take just a bit less time than my bread-machine of 2 1/2 hours. 
I took these to my parent's yesterday and was very pleased with the out come! Along with everyone else - surprising enough, there were actually two left, when it came time to pack things up, which my Dad insisted on keeping!
Thanks for a great recipe!!

I couldn't find one thing wrong with this recipe! And that's the truth. I prepped this recipe for several batches and found that I tweaked a step...didn't change any of the ingredients nor did I remove any ingredients. I did follow the process of steps. However, sifted my flour before making my well. I lightly beat my eggs and tempered them with the hot wet millk mixture, so that the eggs weren't thrown into the wet mixture and started cooking before the recipe was fully mixed. Then added the yeast to the mixture and THEN poured into the well...6 batches of rolls later. Every one of my batches were light, fluffy, flavorful and lightly brushed with butter as the exited the oven! I will make again...no more brown and serve store bought rolls EVER again. I made these into Parkerhouse shaped rolls and various other twisty shapes. Recommend Recommend!!! YUM!

Heat milk,water, and sugar in microwave until tepid. Stir. Add and stir yeast, then eggs, then salt. Brush before baking with more melted butter. Check the rolls after 10 minutes baking.

I just tried these for the first time on Thanksgiving Day. I was short on time and I was able to get them finished quite fast. Unfortunately they came out a little more dense and "biscuity" than I would have liked, and the flavor just isn't quite there. However they are still good, and with some melted butter I know they will be enjoyable with our little feast.

Not only was this bread fabulous to the tastebuds, but it was also incredably easy! I used this recipe to make my very first ever homemade bread,without the bread machine I might add. I was so incredably happy when the bread not only turned out perfectly but my children and husband enjoyed it sooo very much. I put some in my husbands lunch today :)

ADDED ON March 29,2001:
I've been making this recipe over and over again and still I get the same fabulous results...But I wanted to add that this recipe also makes the best loaf of bread ever. It is slightly sweet, moist, and not to mention beautiful to the eye. The recipe also is versitile...I add a tsp. cinnamon and extra 1/4 cup sugar and a cup of raisins and make the best raisin bread I've ever tasted. I've given this bread to family members when the come for dinner and they don't believe that it's not store bought!!! This recipe is really great and I give the person who submitted this recipe five stars *****

This is my "go to" rolls recipe.  ALWAYS perfect!  I use the microwave to heat the milk & water.  Place the eggs out the night before to come to room temp(or place them a dish or hot water (whole raw in shell) to unchill them.  When making cinnamon rolls I add a little extra sugar & 1/2 tsp of nutmeg or apple pie spice to the flour.  This is extra flavor.  When I have made garlic knots, I added 1 to 2 TBLS of garlic powder to the dry ingreients (you could use fresh.  You can add big flavor by adding deiced chili, crushed red pepper dried onions.  I have added a number of flavorings to the dry to take these AMAZING Unbelievable rolls to another level.  I use my kitchen aid mixer.  Proof my yeast & have ingredients at room or warmer temp.

These were awesome! I made them for hamburgers and I loved the soft and light texture they had. Followed the recipe exactly until I went to add the margarine and found I was OUT!! So I substituted oil for it and they turned out beautifully! Next time I'm using butter!

I have been using this recipe now for the last few years and my family just loves it. You have to be careful not to over heat the yeast mixture because if you do, your rolls will not rise correctly. I did that just once and now I am very careful. Love this recipe. Thank you for sharing..

been making rolls from this recipe for years.  it always turns out great!  everybody begs for them. tried it with 3 cups whole wheat flour and 2 cups regular bread flour -- hubby loved them.  everyone else seems to prefer the original recipe.  i whip up about 1/4 cup honey with 1 cup country crock or equivalent for a great addition to these.

These are the lightest and fluffiest rolls I ever had!!! I made it as written except I only used half the sugar. They were perfect! I had to keep adding flour to keep the dough from being too sticky during rolling. I made half the recipe which used 1 packet of yeast. I can't wait to make these for guests!

Fluffy, warm, spongy dough heaven!  These were amazing right out of the oven - truly "unbelievable".  One caveat though, the instructions are tricky as written so the first thing I did was throw them out.  I stuck with the traditional method of making bread:  1) mix yeast and warm (not hot) water until bubbly.  The water temperature should be somewhere between lukewarm and bath water warm. 2) microwave milk and butter one minute until warm (not hot) 3) mix dry ingredients 4) once yeast is thick and bubbly (about ten minutes) add dry ingredients and wet ingredients to it in several intermittent steps. These rolls turned out great and I see a lot of these in my future.  

One other consideration is they don't keep well so try to get them out of the oven around the time you plan on eating them.  The next day they were dried out and not very good, but the first day they were out of this world.

I don't know what went wrong with these rolls.  They were were so easy to make and rose perfectly.  However, they were so dense, and yeasty making it very hard to swallow. These were not the light, fluffy dinner rolls I was hoping for.

I followed the recipe to the "T", but the rolls didn't rise. I am going to read the reviews and see other people's suggestions and maybe try again. Sorry for the bad  review, but I spent 2 hours anticipating wonderful rolls and didn't get any :(

In response to one of the reviews - I always, always, always use butter when making bread and/or rolls. Neither butter nor margarine will have an effect on the outcome of these rolls except for flavor, and I firmly believe that butter gives any recipe superior flavor.

I have been making these rolls about once a week since I found this recipe right before Thanksgiving.  The first time I made them, which was the first time I ever tried to make bread of any kind, they turned out like biscuits.  I know I did something wrong (although I'm not sure exactly what) because when I made them again following the directions very carefully, they turned out perfect -- light, fluffy, and amazingly tasty.  My 15 year old daughter, a novice baker, made them and they turned out perfect for her as well.  Yeast packets typically indicate that regular yeast requires disolving in liquid around 110 to 115 degrees, while rapid rise yeast is put into the flour and liquid is added at around 120 degrees. I tried the recipe once using rapid rise yeast and while they turned out pretty good, they suffered a little in the translation. So I continue to make them the regular way with regular yeast and liquid at 115 degrees.  Also, I tried substituting buttermilk for the milk and it turned out wonderful. I've used this dough for rolls, mini loaves, and best of all, cinnamon rolls.  For cinnamon rolls, I roll dough out to a rectangle, spread about a 1/3 cup softened butter on the dough to about 1/2 inch from the edge, and spread a mixture of 1 cup brown sugar and 2 1/2 tablespoons cinnamon over the butter.  Roll up, pinch edges, and cut about 1/2 inch thick rolls.  Let them rise for the last time, and bake.  If you turn the pan upside down when they're done baking, all the m

This is a quick and easy recipe.  I decided to  make it 10 minutes after finding it online.  The rolls turned out perfect.  I got 18 rolls total, and didn't need to bake them as long, only 12 minutes.  I'm happy to say I posted the photo of them.

These rolls are amazingly easy.  After baking, I froze half the rolls, defrosted them a week later (and warmed them up in the microwave for a few seconds) and they were just as good as fresh.

A wonderful base for rolls. Unlike many recipes, this one yields (and then some) the sixteen rolls indicated. For added flavor, I use honey (1/2 cup) instead of sugar and reduce the water by 1/4 cup. After shaping, you can brush the tops with an egg-white and water wash and sprinkle sesame or poppy seeds before baking. Be careful when warming the milk solution not to exceed 115 degrees farenheit. Bon Apetit.

MMmmm! Great recipe! Thank you! I couldn't believe the recipe when I first read it.  I use this also for cinnamon rolls and just add melted butter, cinnamon, rasins, and, ch chips and walnuts after the second rising.  Thank you again...I can't believe some had difficulty with it...I wasn't that accurate or punctual and they are still great!

Just what my taste buds wanted. It was easy and I had no problem.  Only thing is, I didn't realize how much the recipe made.  It was enough maybe for 10-15 people and it was just the two of us.  I froze the remaining batch.  Reading is fundamental...hahaha

These are amazeballs! I've been making homemade bread for about 15 years so I just followed the instructions using typical bread-making techniques. "Warm" liquid for proofing is about 95 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit. I just microwaved my liquids for about 1 minute. The dough was sticky so it got a very light dusting of flour whenever it started sticking to the counter. I don't think I added more than 1 to 2 T total for kneading. Each bun was about 3 oz of dough for 16 rolls, and they are sizable and could easily be used as hamburger buns. The taste was buttery and the texture was light and airy. I did decrease my oven temp to 375F and 15 minutes was perfect.

The recipe is good. I did a couple of things differently. One, I only added the salt near the end with the melted margarine as salt is a yeast killer. Two, I brushed melted butter on them as soon as they came out of the oven to keep the tops soft. Due to the high temperature and high sugar content, it browned very quickly and I took it out after 15mins exactly. In my opinion, it's a bit sweet to be a dinner roll. It would make an awesome breakfast roll with butter and jam.

Half way through making this recipe I decided to read some reviews on it, because it has a couple of unconventional ways of making bread. So I wanted to see what other people had to say about it. I got a little worried, but my batch did come out fluffy and rich and delicious. If I was just judging on flavour and texture this recipe would get a 5, but because the instructions were not very detailed, I found myself doing a bit of guess work. 
1. The yeast wasn't proofed before adding to the dry ingredients, so if your yeast happens to not work for what ever reason, the whole batch would be ruined. 
2. The water and milk heated on the stove doesn't mention how hot. I guessed lukewarm because every other yeast recipe uses lukewarm liquid to activate the yeast, too hot would kill the yeast.
I also tempered beaten eggs with the warm milk because I wanted to avoid scrambling. 
3. The dough turned out to be more of a batter, I added 1c extra of flour just to get it to look like a very sticky dough, definitely to wet to knead by hand, so I mixed it in a stand mixer for about 3-5min, just until it looked like it was fully incorporated.  
If I was to make this recipe again, I think I would tweak it to the point where its a whole new recipe. All in all it produced very tasty rolls.

Here's the thing, these rolls taste like some of the popular steak house rolls which is a good thing; while I like a sweeter roll now and then, I don't want sweet ones all the time. These are somewhat difficult of a dough to work with; due to stickiness and adding flour. I added about 1 1/2 cups more flour and still sticky. May be somewhat daunting for "baking newbies." I'm an avid baker so just giving a little advice. Please read other reviews for help with these before tackling them as you will need some tips. I baked a larger cake panful with sides touching and also buns on a sheet pan. The cake pan ones rose beautifully, but the ones on the pan were not as high as I would have liked. Next time,  I will try letting them rise longer. Hopefully, that will take care of the problem. My yeast was fine. The method is odd and interesting for making them and the flavor is quite good. But they may be too sweet for some.

Simply AWESOME, I made them for the first time, without really any "dinner roll" baking experience and every body was impressed.  I didn't change anything, but the servings and the recipe was, as I said "AWESOME!"

So I made these rolls today for dinner. Took about 2.5 to3 hour's from start to finish. I do a lot of baking. Im a stay at home mom so baking rolls 2-3 times a week sometimes more is nothing for me I I feel I know my way around. I made two changes. One by mistake and one I meant to. I forgot the instructions call for the butter to be added after you let the milk and yeast sit in the flour for 20-30 min.'s I added mine in the milk along with 2 table spoon's of shortening. Other then that I followed the directions as written. Brushing shortingig on top before puttin in oven. I have found my carbohydrate nervana! Everyone loves then even the dog who sat begging at my feet for a roll. Thanks so much. :)

These rolls just didn't work out, I hate to say.  When they failed the first time I thought I must have done something wrong so I made them again.  After going step-by-step and following the recipe EXACTLY, they still came out awful.  It's like the dough never rose; it remained heavy and dense.  I don't know what happened.  I'm sure they would have tasted good if they didn't turn out like hockey pucks.

This is by far the very best recipe for dinner buns. 
Its very easy, truly delicious, very popular, and the dough is versatile enough to be used for other 
purposes. Its excellent for hamburger buns, and 
hot dog buns. They turn out better with real butter
than they do with margarine;they always turn out
wonderful. I'm always very pleased and proud of the way they turn out. This will always be my very
favorite white bun recipe.

Just made a half-batch of these and gotta say they're pretty good. I used bread flour but otherwise didn't change anything. Didn't have any problems with rise or density but I will agree with other reviewers in saying that this is a very sweet roll so just be warned.

These are GREAT!!  I use my bread machine to do everything except form them and put them in the oven. I just ate 2 right out of the oven. They would be great for sandwiches or hamburgers all depends on how big you form them. Thanks Sherlie great recipe.

These are a very yummy and easy to make.  I didn't follow the instructions at all...I just threw it all together in a bowl and kneaded it once in a while.  The buns had lots of good flavor, but they were fairly heavy.  They make tasty sandwich buns and my family gobbled them up and asked for more...I just wish they had been a little fluffier (maybe if I had followed the instructions they would have been...but that seemed like too much work)=:)

This was the easiest yeast dough I have ever made!  I took other reviewers advice and made cinnamon rolls from the dough. They were delicious.  This will be the only dough I use from now on!  For the people who had trouble with this recipe, the key is the temperature when you add the yeast, if it is too hot the dough will not turn out. I am making the dough for rolls tonight with barbque pork, Yum!!

Thank you so much for solving my fear of baking and bread. I love these rolls!  Easy, fun, predictable (if you're familiar working with dough) and my only tweak is more butter. about 2 extra tbs makes them a little softer a little sweeter and amazing overall.

THANK YOU SHERLIE!!!  I've never made homemade rolls before.  I bake a lot, but have always been hesitant to try bread.  These are simple to make & taste absolutely amazing.  The texture is soft & tender without being gummy.  The sweetness is perfect!  I made this for Thanksgiving & the whole family LOVED them!!! I wouldn't change a thing.  :-)

I also gave 4 stars because I didn't want to ruin such a great rating, but I did not have a good experience with these. The dough didn't rise, and the rolls were super dense - like biscuits. How do I get the fluffy results that everyone else is raving about? I felt like the directions were a bit vague in regard to how long to knead the dough - but that couldn't have been it, could it? I was thinking that maybe because I added the yeast to the milk while it was still warm... but I am a beginner at bread making. I'd like to try again.

the recipe does not tell you must wait untill the mixture is luke warm before adding yeast. ( I knew because I have baked bread before). If you do not let it cool the hot mixture will kill the yeast. if you are new to baking don't worry, the amount of sugar in this recipe WILL activate the yeast! Other than that a great roll.

I was very impressed with this recipe. First time I have tried to make homemade bread and I was so excited when these turned out so good. The only trouble I had was how sticky the dough was. I did add some more flour but found if I kept my hands floured it was fine. Felt like a real cook and got good reviews from company. Definately a keeper, thanks for sharing!!

These are delicious!  Makes a lot of dough.  I have half of it in the freezer that I'm going to use for cinnamon rolls.  As dinner rolls, though, the recipe worked beautifully.

My husband and I made these rolls for Thanksgiving dinner. We had to add a lot more flour because of the stickiness of the dough. I thought they were a little dense, but they we both thought they were good. Everyone at dinner seemed to like them. They were easy to make. Thanks for the recipe, Sherlie!

This is the BEST roll recipe I have ever tried. And it was soo easy. I agree with other users. Don't add the salt to the liquid mix, add it to the flour and stir it around. If you add it to the yeast mix, it might screw up the whole recipe. Only heat the mix on the stove to about 150 degrees. When you add your eggs it will cool off a bit. Don't add the yeast if its too hot. The wet mix should be just warm on your finger. Follow the recipe exactly though. The rolls were flakey and great. I brushed mine with melted butter when they came out and everyone was shocked that I baked something soo good.

These rolls are simple and delicious!!  So flexible!  I made some as dinner rolls and some as garlic bread sticks.  Today, I made them as sausage kolaches. (Cut a half cup of butter flavored shortening into the flour mixture to make the rolls flaky.) Wonderful!  My new favorite roll recipe!!

I had lost my old recipe for this and was glad that you posted it! Thank You

I add 3 tsp of garlic powder to the dough and before I let it raise the last time I add 1/2 cup of x-tra sharp Cheddar cheese. This make a great accompany to Spagette or Italian meals or sandwiches like Hoagies or Subs.

Try adding the salt AFTER the first cup of flour has been mixed in.  Yeast does not like salt.  Also keep your milk/water mixture to warm - not too hot.  These are great for hamburger buns as well!!  My family loves them  Double the amount you'd use to make a regular roll and flatten slightly.  Let them rise and then brush with an egg wash and sprinkle with sesame seeds before baking.

These rolls were absolutely amazing - delicious and extremely easy!  I was so intrigued by the the unique process that I had to try them.  The dough was rather sticky and I also had to add some additional flour, but they were so light and fluffy.  I used very lightly oiled counter to roll out pinches of the dough to form the rolls.  This eliminated the need to add more flour to keep them from sticking to my hands and becoming tougher.  I doubled the recipe in order to get 32 rolls, but this made 50 generous rolls!  These will be a favorite recipe from here on out.

I have made this recipe for different family gatherings and people have just raved about these rolls and want the recipe.  When I read how they were made I was worried if they would turn out but they sure did.  My granddaughter entered these in a fair for 4H and the judges were impressed.

Well........I'm scratching my head over this one. I have made LOTS and I mean LOTS of bread and rolls over the years, with no problem. But this recipe was a complete failure. I decided to try them because of the majority of good reviews. Well, they didn't rise, and I always turn my oven down at least 25 degrees, because my oven runs hot. And these BURNED! So, they didn't raise and they burned. Why? I haven't a clue.. But at least the birds were happy.

I made these rolls for my Mom & Dad who are visiting. I've made my share of breads & rolls but I have never come across one like this. I followed the recipe exactly, I also gave them an egg wash just before they went in the oven. It made 16 big rolls a few big enough to use for sandwiches. They are wonderful light and airy just a touch sweet. This will be my go to roll recipe.

I warmed my milk in microwave just a bit warmer than lukewarm. Added lukewarm water and only 2 Tbsp of sugar and yeast. Proofed it then added eggs and the flour and salt. I used half organic whole wheat and half organic white. Mixed it in my Kitchen Aid. Transferred dough to oiled pyrex bowl and put tin foil loosely on top. After that I placed it in preheated oven (250 F), I turned it off and left door ajar and waited for dough to double in size. Shaped the dough into twelve balls and repeated rise. Then baked  at 400F for 15 min. All done.

We thought these buns tasted great. I used my kitchenaid stand mixer and needed a scant quarter cup more flour while it was kneading. I only used 1/3 cup sugar. Next time I will divide the dough into more than 16 portions; they made pretty big buns!I let the dough rise in the oven with the light on and it worked well.

These are amazing! I've made them twice now, and both times they were fantastic. I warmed up the milk mixture in the microwave till just warm, added the yeast to it right away. Other than that, and this time I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 4 cups white flour, I followed the recipe exactly as written. No kneading at all, and most of the time is just waiting for the dough to rise. Yes, the dough is a little bit sticky, but I think that may be why they are so good! Don't worry, they get light and airy as they rise the second time. They make 16 LARGE buns, or you can even make 24 smaller dinner roll sized buns. They are light with a little hint of sweetness. A very easy and adaptable recipe. I may try adding herbs or cheese next time.

Very easy and fast. Dough is very easy to work with. I did sub 1 cup of whole wheat flour and cut sugar in half as I did not want a sweet dough. They still were very lite textured. Will make again.

Just made these rolls for the first time. They turned out beautill and taste delicious. The only change I made was to use real butter instead of margarine and I used my bread machine to mix the ingredients. I just hearted the liquids a little in the microwave before putting it in the machine and then added all the other ingredients. You might have to add a little more flour to get beyond the real sticky stage. You can let the dough rise in the bread machine or put it in a bowl to rise. I will definitely be adding this recipe to my favorites list. Thank you for sharing it, Sherlie

I just tried this recipe today my very first rolls ever! They turned out quite well but were yeasty tasting and not as light as I expected. But for my first try they were stellar! I did find them a bit too sweet so I will omit most of the sugar the next time round.

I made these today and they are wonderful and so easy! My son & husband loved them also. I'm the designated "roll provider" for Thanksgiving this year and can't wait to share them with family & friends!! I was able to get 24 decent size rolls from this recipe even though it says it yields 16 rolls. I will be making these again!!

The rolls came out very beautiful looking and the texture was perfect, but they were incredibly bland. Going to try them again with double salt and hope that doesn't mess with the consistency too much!

I have terrible luck with yeast breads and these were simple with excellent results.  Do be careful with the temp of the heated ingred...and watch the baking time, I had to pull mine out at 13 min.  I followed the recipe exactlly and I am really pleased with the product....try 'em even if you are breadphobic like me.

I've been looking for years for a bread recipe with just right amount of yeast taste and sweetness to replicate rolls we used to have at school lunch when our schools all had their own cooks and kitchens and made their own bread.  This is it!   I make the rolls in aluminum cake pans and can get two dozen out of this recipe.  I have discovered that I need to add quite a bit of extra flour when I start mixing--up to 1 1/2 cups.  These are amazingly delicious and easy.  I made them for family meals at Thanksgiving and Easter this year and my family loves them.  I have taken them to church meals and gotten compliments on them.  They also remind me of the rolls at the Liberty Tree Tavern in the Magic Kingdom at Disney World.  They would be great with some plum butter.

The rolls were a bit sweeter than I expected, but had a fantastic flavor. My roommate and I couldn't stop eating them! For the second batch I froze most of the rolls and reheated them in the oven individually; this worked great. 

One tip: brush with butter before baking for a delicious taste.

These are the best rolls I've ever made. All four of my kids AND my husband loved them, and that's not an everyday thing!  I also made the recipe again, rolled the dough out, brushed with melted butter and sprinkled with brown sugar and cinnamon to make the best cinnamon rolls EVER!

I Have made this recipe several times now, everytime I make them there are never any leftovers. My family now asks for them as well as my friends. This is a truly fool proof roll recipe in my opinion. You do have to be very careful when using yeast and these rolls I found to be extra sensitive. Be sure you have to water at only 110*. I have found that by pouring the mix into a glass bowl and adding the eggs BEFORE adding the yeast helps with overheating and/or over cooling the yeast. Also when rising on the pans, I have found it helps to have them covered and placed in a warmer area (like the stove top while oven is on) it doubles the size. When making these for Thanksgiving or any large event, I always make the day before. They rewarm wonderfully. I love this recipe. Thank you Sherlie for posting it.

My Sister and I made these rolls for our Christmas party that we had on Sat. it was the first time that we have made bread and it was easy and they turned out grate. I have another Christmas Party this weekend and I'm going to make them for that one too. No more store bought rolls for me.

I made this recipe twice today, after messing up the first batch.  I think a lot of people are making the same mistake I did the first time.  I heated the milk mixture & the melted butter to a temperature exceeding 120 degrees, which killed the yeast. My first batch came out hard & heavy, and took a while to bake.  My second batch was awesome!

Please tell me what I did wrong! My rolls turned out  totally wrong, very firm and dense.  I followed the recipe exactly! This is my first experience with bread from scratch and I would really like some input so I can be successful next time! Based on previous reviews, I'm sure this  is a great recipe so I just gave 4 stars.

These are just like the rolls I used to eat in elementary school. As I moved up in grades, the schools stopped serving them, so I couldn't try taste testing them. I haven't been able to find a recipe until now. Thanks for sharing!

These turned out great! My thought for the people who had a bad experience is perhaps they don't know the basics for bread/roll making. All ingredients at room temp. the more you mix the dough the denser it becomes. I will be using this recipe from now on. I did add the salt later and decrease the sugar just a littl thanks to other reviews :)

I'm giving this only 2 stars because mine turned out like dense little balls. They had great flavor so I will try to make them again but, I think that this recipe might turn out better by kneading the dough longer and allowing more time for the dough to rest and rise.

These rolls were awesome. I used butter instead of margarine. I baked these in muffin pans. In each greased muffin cup I put three small balls of dough. That way the baked roll breaks easily into three pieces - perfect for butter/jelly. I also made some cinnamon rolls with this dough and they were terrific.

These rolls are great. I made a batch last night, and they are all gone! This is my first attempt at making dinner rolls, and they were a hit with the whole family. I did brush the tops with egg wash, and they came out looking awesome. Also, I was low on AP flour so I used about half & half AP and bread flour. Easy recipe and tastes great, these are going to be on heavy rotation!

I LOVE bread, but I've never had any luck at all with rolls or biscuits.  I decided to give this recipe a shot though because it looked easy enough, and now I can say that as a bread 'connoisseur' who until now hasn't been able to make good bread herself, these are awesome!  I followed the recipe exactly except I added the salt to the flour, not the wet ingredients.  I did add some extra flour, but I left my dough very sticky - so sticky that I couldn't actually shape it into balls.  To 'shape' my rolls, I just kind of dropped dollops of dough onto my cookie sheet.  =)  I brushed them with a beaten egg before baking to brown the tops and then put some butter on them as soon as they came out of the oven.  They were perfect and delicious - definitely not dry or heavy.  I will absolutely make these over and over.

I am always skeptical when it comes to making dinner breads and rolls, but this was a very simple recipe that resulted in wonderful tasty rolls.  They remind me of the yeast rolls that you get at Barnhill's or Ryan's.  They are so good with honey butter (I just mix real butter with pure honey to taste).  Try them, you will love these!

The rolls were really soft and tasty out of the oven when they were warm then they got super hard.  They were "unbelievably" hard.  So I froze them but now I don't know what to do with them.  Any ideas?

I just made these to go with our Thanksgiving turkey.  They were easy and delicious.  I baked them on parchment paper with room between them and brush them with egg white to give them a shine and to help with browning.  I raised them in a warm oven once they were formed on the baking sheet.  I made some larger ones so that we can make leftover turkey sandwiches with them.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are perfect.I had to add 1 additional cup flour, and they rose perfectly. These did not last 1 day,and I  will make for Thanksgiving. It seems to be the milk that makes the difference. Thanks!

I must have done something wrong.  I ended up with dense "hockey pucks" rather than fluffy rolls.  I am giving this recipe a three because my unbelievable hockey pucks tasted good and I think it was more my error than a bad recipe.  This was only my second time making a bread product so maybe with some practice I will become more consistent.

Update: Someone suggested that I warm up the milk and water to 110 and then mix with sugar and yeast rather than doing it on the stove b/c it is difficult to manage the temperature which is crucial with bread.  This time I ended up with wonderful fluffy rolls. :)

I have made this recipe several times and my family raves every time. This is my go to recipe for rolls. I do bake them at a slightly lower temperature than the original recipe calls for, so the bottoms don't brown too quickly.

So easy to make and so yummy! I made these rolls to have leftover turkey sandwiches after Christmas, but they're good even just warm with butter. I followed the other reviews and mixed the salt with the flour, and also brushed them with water and sprinkled with flour before baking, and yummy yummy yummy! My son won't eat sandwiches on bread at school, and these were so easy to make, it seemed like more effort to get in the car and go to the grocery store to buy some! I'll be using these a LOT!

I have been using this recipe for the past 2 Thanksgivings and me and all 30 family members loved it!! Last Thanksgiving I had to double the recipe and they didn't last either. Needless to say I will be making them again this year x 3!!!!!!

These are pretty good, however, I do agree with a few previous reviews I read that said they're more like afternoon tea rolls. Thanks :]

Delicious! I had never made rolls before with much success...but carefully read the reviews and followed other peoples advice on keeping your yeast alive and happy. I served mine with honey butter and they were devoured in no time. I halved the recipe and regret it now!

this recipe was so easy to throw together. you do need to have plenty of time because you have to let it rest several times, but the actual work involved is minimal compared to other yeast breads. these rolls are excellent hot out of the oven! they are a little dry the next day but pop them in the microwave and they soften up a lot. the entire family loved them!!!

These were great. They didn't rise as much as I would have liked so I'll try a couple of the other suggestions next time. But the flavor was superb. My family had demolished them all within the day (my son was even hiding them to make sure he got more)!

My mom is the bread maker in my family.  I was a bit nervous making these, but they turned out good.  Almost like my mom's.  I will make these again and again.

I agree that this recipe could have slightly more specific directions, but mine did look like the picture.  It says 16 servings.  Was that supposed to be 16 rolls or 2 rolls per serving.  I was able to make 32.  Anyway, I cooked mine 15 mins and they were a bit dark on the botton and I put them on the center rack.  They taste so much better the second day.

These rolls turned out very nice, they were high and very fluffy.  I have made this recipe several times.  I have made cinnamon rolls out of the dough and I have also made two small loaves of bread out of the dough.  Thank you for this great recipe!!

This is similar to an overnight sweet sourdough recipe.The lid blew off of my bowl during the 1st resting period...but I knew my yeast wasn't old when it did! The dough was a bit sticky and more flour was added.Whoever said this recipe made 16 rolls must make the biggest rolls ever!(or maybe I make the smallest) I had a 9x 13 pan with 24 rolls and an 8x8 pan with 16.They were tasty and we enjoyed them . I like the fact that they can be put together so fast and in 1 bowl. I will make them again...oh and I didn't cook them as long, 10-12 mins.

These were really good and so absolutely easy to make.  I halfed the recipe, and let them rise 1 hr for first rising (I went for my daily walk), and about 45 minutes for the second rising.  I shaped them to make cloverleaf rolls.  My husband complimented me on this one without any prompting.  I'll be making these many times to come.

These did rise nicely but still came out dense and biscuit-like.  I felt guilty giving my husband one in his lunch the next day!  Perhaps they are just not as "easy" as the recipe says.

I am a mother of 8 and love to cook for them.
i rarely use shortcut and love cooking from scratch. This recipe is awesome! It is SOOOO easy and the family thinks  I have been baking all day. They are light and fluffy. I have even substituted part of the white for whole wheat ( about a half a cup) and still had wonderful results. It will never replace the traditional dough but has a fluffy wonderful yeast taste with a crusty exterior. You will also love this recipe because it is sooo easy and it really makes itself.

I love these rolls! the first few times I made them they came out perfect... But now I can't get them to rise.. I changed the recipe some by using all milk instead of water and using a little more sugar for a sweeter roll..I don't know if that has something to do with it our not, but I wish someone could tell me! Thanks for the wonderful recipe Sherlie! I hope I can find someone that can tell me how to get them to rise again...

Excellent recipe!  So little work, and you end up with tasty, fluffy rolls.  I did get 16 rolls, but they were huge!  Everyone loved them, and I can't stop nibbling on them today.  I guess it depends on your oven, but mine were done in 10 minutes when I baked them at 375.  They were perfect when baked this way.

These rolls were excellent and very easy to make. I followed the ingredients and directions to a T and they came out fluffy and perfect! My only concern was how to portion them out. I divided the dough in half then half again until I had approximately 30 pieces. I shaped them and put the tucks and seams on the bottom. Brushed with an egg wash and baked at 375 for about 12 to 13 minutes. I would highly recommend these!!!

I read tons of reviews before I made these and here are my tips. Bloom yeast in the 3/4 cup of warm water (between 98 and 105 degrees F)  and 1 tablespoon of sugar from your 1/2 cup. Let that get all nice a foamy, then add the rest of the sugar and the eggs. I put 3/4 tsp of kosher salt in my flour instead of putting a full teaspoon in my yeast mixture (salt and yeast are not friends). Make sure your eggs are room temperature before you add them. I used 1 stick of salted butter instead of margarine and made sure to let it cool for about a minute before I added it to my flour.  I mixed this by hand and had no trouble. I added about 1 tbs of extra flour directly to the dough and kneaded in an additional tablespoon and a half. I only kneaded this until it formed a single piece of dough and didn't rip immediately upon stretching- it was not smooth and it was still tacky but it did hold together.  Make sure both rises are done in a warm environment or this will not rise properly and watch these in the oven, if you can smell them you need to check  right away, the tops brown very quickly. This is not a beginner recipe by any means but the rolls are delicious and fluffy on the inside and I will definitely be making them again very soon (seriously if I didn't have to bring these to a get together later today i could have eaten the entire pan they're so good!)

This is a fantastic roll recipe - the lightest, most feathery rolls ever! I made 24 - put them in six rows of 4 on a jelly roll pan, and it made perfect pull-apart rolls. I love how they are ridiculously easy! Who would have thought such an unorthodox method could be such magic!?
A few notes:
I heated the water/milk liquid mixture in the the microwave - much easier to control temperature.  The liquid should feel comfortably warm, not hot. 
THEN I added the yeast and proofed it in that mixture. 
Then add the eggs.
The rest I followed exactly. I let it rise in a big tupperware bowl with lid. 
I brushed an egg wash on the rolls before baking.
15 minutes was perfect.
Such a wonderful recipe! It will be the one I make from now on.

Perfection every time! I change nothing but cooking time for this recipe. I cook at a little less time because I found the time a tad too long. I cut back by maybe five minutes. As soon as they are light golden I take out and butter baste. These don't last a day in my house :)

Very good but it calls for 3 rises and I omitted the 2nd rise. They came out just the same and saved me time. I used 2 packets of instant yeast instead of 1 packet of active dry yeast, but still followed the recipe as written for active dry yeast. The 2 packets was just what it needed to produce a very yeasty tasting roll which my family prefers.

I made these as written. There is no need to proof your yeast first, that's not this recipe. If you're a stickler for proofing yeast, please find another recipe. Heat the milk, water, salt and sugar on the stovetop, and use an instant read thermometer to test the temp. Another reviewer said to use 2 packets of yeast to get 5 tsp. A packet of yeast has 2 1/4 tsp....2 packets would be 4 1/2, leaving you shy 1/2 tsp. A jar of yeast, better yet a brick of yeast is much cheaper, and you can measure out 5 tsp. Also, this dough reminds me of a no-knead bread, except you're lightly kneading this dough. All you need is a wooden spoon to stir it all together, and a clean work surface to lightly knead it. There wasn't a need for my Kitchen-aid stand mixer with dough hook. This isn't a classic dough that's going to grab onto the dough hook, unless you're changing this, that and the other and still giving this 5 stars and calling it "Unbelievable". These are an easy and very tasty roll when made as written.

OMG!! These were AMAZING!!
So. The only change I made was the sugar, because I never use/add it in anything. My side of the family loves their sugar though, so I just reduced it by adding just over half the amount. 
I went with 20 minutes to rise every time because I was in a hurry, and the mixture was extremely sticky when I put it on the sheet, but, truth...when they were done, they were gone. My sugar-loving family from the other side of the country LOVED them, and so did my fiance and I. The texture and taste was perfect, and they looked so pretty you'd never guess I was a cook and not a baker. They were so easy to make and so darn delicious. I will definitely make these again. Thank you, Sherlie!!

This was my first time making rolls!  This is a wonderful recipe.  I read through the reviews but decided to make them per the recipe, at least for the first time.  These rolls were great.  I would have liked them to be just a little lighter, but like I said, this was my first time making rolls so I may have done something out of step.  I will make these again and again and again.  Thank you!!

These rolls are so easy just make sure you only warm the milk a water mixture, too hot an d you will kill your yeast. These rolls are so light and fluff the family can't stop eating them.

What I did was I used real butter and honey instead of sugar.  I mixed all the liquids with the yeast and pour into the flour as the kitchen-aid went on the lowest setting (I never proof my yeast, I know it is good).  Let it go for about 8 minutes.  It is a wet kind of sticky dough.  Almost greasy, I don't think you want to add flour to make it ball up like your standard white loaf, just not that type of dough.  I greased up my hands to form a ball and let rise in the oven in the kitchen aid bowl after getting the chill out of the oven first.  It just did not want to rise on my counter, too chilly I guess.  I knocked it down once and then knocked it down an hour later and divided it in to 6ths with greased hands.  I put three per greased round cake pan after rolling into a ball and giving a little smoosh.  Beat an egg and brushed the tops and sprinkled with sesame seeds before letting the buns rise.  In a kitchen hot with cooking they rose in no time and were huge, baked even bigger taking up the whole pan.  We used these for pulled BBQ.  They were so good, giant, soft, tall, tender and flavorful.  I think the real butter and honey made it.  I am just not a huge fan of sugar in my bread.  I am going to try it my way on kolachies next.

I bake my own bread, rolls, and pastries often.  I was looking for a quick recipe and the reviews were very positive.  I don't know what I did wrong, but the dough didn't rise, and so my rolls ended up like heavy hockey pucks.  The flavor was good but I certainly couldn't serve them.  I checked my yeast and it is good and  I checked the temperature of my liquid so I didn't kill the yeast. I did make a double batch so I'm wondering if that could have even the problem.  I ay or may not try this recipe again.

This recipe is phenomenal. I make large rolls for my husband's sandwiches and he just loves it! I have also made smaller rolls for dinner and each time they turn out great. I even skipped the "letting it stand" part of step two and just gave the dough a little additional rising time and it still turned out fantastic. This is going in my use all the time file.

UPDATE: I made a double batch of this recipe over the weekend and made 12 LARGE sandwich rolls (froze dough for 8 of them before the second rise), 12 cinnamon rolls and a loaf of bread. It was absolutely fantastic and so versatile. I also made a pork loin roast ($1.89/lb on sale woo hoo) and the hubby now has roast pork sandwiches and incredible rolls to take for lunch this week.

Use these instructions in lieu of Step One:
Combine the 3/4 warm water (from the tap works fine; it needs to be around 110° give or take) and 1tsp of the sugar, then sprinkle the 5tsp of yeast on top of it to "proof" the yeast. All this means is that you're "proving" that the yeast will work. If it's active, it will all foam up within 10 mins. If it doesn't foam, your yeast is probably dead and your rolls won't rise.

Heat the milk to around 110°, beat the remaining sugar (I cut it down to 1/4 cup) and 2 eggs into it, then mix it with the proofed yeast.

Follow the recipe instructions beginning with step two.

If you reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup or less, you can make lots of great things, like:
Garlic rolls
Little pizzas (breadier than pizza dough, but it works)
Cheese rolls
Honey butter rolls
Cinnamon rolls
Pecan rolls

Quick and easy recipe, considering these are raised rolls!

these rolls are awesome my feonce loves them!! and hes a picky eater. the only problem i had was the bottoms burned, but i did bake them on wax paper so that probably has something to do with it. so note to anyone new trying this recipe *DO NOT BAKE ON WAX PAPER!* other than that i'm not the best cook in the world but these tasted really good :) i will make them again!

The absolute best recipe ever!! Making them for the 3rd time today and did not change a thing!!! These will be the only recipe used from now on in this house!!

**update** Have made this recipe numerous times since my post, always a hit and amazing EVERY TIME!! Today, I realized I didn't have any white sugar on hand so used brown sugar instead...WOW!!!! Used the same amount it called for, but what an incredible taste and did not change the texture at all!!

This is my first time making dinner rolls and they came out wonderfully. They were not as light as I had hoped but at the same time were not too dense and the taste was amazing. Two things I'd really change is how much yeast was used. It's a bit too much. And after mixing and kneading, I'd ball the dough and place it on the baking sheet to raise, then put them directly into the oven. That would make them a bit fluffier.

These are unbelievably easy,they turn out light and delicious.  I've been making these at least once a week since I first tried them several weeks ago.  I get more than 16 rolls out of the recipe, and as others have suggested, I add the salt to the flour rather than the wet ingredients.  A keeper for sure!

I was the baker at a middle school for a few years and made some amazing rolls and have been searching for a good roll recipe since...well, I made these today and they taste exactly like those did! I did not change a thing! I like to pat the dough out slightly and cut it into portions before shaping into rolls. I put them in an oiled 9x13 pan so they'd rise high and they sure did! I made 20 big, fluffy rolls...the only recipe I'll need from now on!

I thought Angie's Perfect Dinner rolls ( also from this site) was very good... But this one is even better! So soft and fluffy even when cold. After reading reviews, instead of warming the milk mixture in the saucepan, I just popped it in the microwave. That way, I know it won't be too hot for the yeast. Yeast will die in too hot surroundings and your rolls won't rise and may end up with brick hard rolls. I find this recipe easier too.  Not too much kneading required. Sorry, Angie, your recipe been replaced :P

well just pulled these out of the oven, and had my 1st one, and boy are they good! This was my 1st time making homemade buns of any kind, and im really proud! I did add the salt with the flour based on other reviews, and also used butter in place of margerine(just cuz i prefer butter in any sort of baking). Before popping them in the oven i did a egg wash on them aswell. I got 24 decent sized buns! Will definatly be making these again, maybe adding some cheese and or bacon to the dough before shaping them into rolls, for something different, or topping them with honey for a sweeter roll.Thank you for sharing!

This rolls came out perfect the first time I made them!!! The only thing I changed was butter instead of margarine.  I did however place a pan of water in the oven, with the rolls rolls while baking.  I made an egg wash to go on them right before baking them. They came out shiny.  I gave them to my Husbands boss!!  I am going to make another batch for us.  In a 9" by 13" it made 15 large roll!!  Just follow the directions and they will come out perfect!!

I just made these for the first time and they turned out FANTASTIC! I halved the recipe, making 8 rolls and they came out amazing! I am new to baking breads and have tried a couple other recipes with little success (they were usually too tough or didn't rise properly). I kneaded the dough for quite a while, until it was rather blistery in appearance and then I brushed them with some melted butter before baking. They came out absolutely light and fluffy. Even halving the recipe the rolls came out quite large, about the size of hamburger buns! They're going to be great with clam chowder for dinner tonight! :) Thank you!

Turned out awesome. It was my first time making buns at home with out any help. Came out with great taste super soft inside and just the perfect amount of softness. I cheated and used quick rise yeast because its all i had on hand. I was worried that they would come out right because of it but by just leaving it rest for 10 minutes for the first two resting times they came out just right. They cooked up a lot faster in my oven and browned up more than I would have liked but I'm sure thats my ovens fault. I rubbed butter on when taking them out to keep the tops nice and soft. Will definitely be making these again

This recipe turned out great! A few things i did different, i added the salt to the flour instead of the milk mixture and i used 2 cups of whole wheat flour and 3 cups all purpose flour. They came out perfect and when it came time to knead i only added about 1/2 cup flour to it. A couple helpful hints: 1)make sure your milk mixture is at a good temp, too hot will kill your yeast, too cold and it wont poof, if its expired it wont serve any purpose! 2)before you start kneading rub a little vegetable oil on your hands to keep the dough from sticking completely to your hands.3)when you knead your dough, make sure the surface you are kneading on is cold, otherwise your dough WILL stick to it! Great recipe!

These are the most amazing rolls I've ever had and my husband and daughter agree!  I was a bit confused with the directions so I fussed my way through, took advice from other comments, and can't believe how wonderful they came out.  I added the milk mixture to the flour and mixed it a little, then added melted butter and mixed all the way.  I needed quite a bit of extra flour to get it less sticky and then let it rise in the oven with the light on.  After 30 minutes, I took the dough out but couldn't roll it because it was still too sticky.  I did the best I could and figured they'd look like drop bisquits.  They came out awesome though, just huge.  They browned beautifully but I still sprayed butter on them when I took them out of the oven.  Thank you!

One thing I did was to use an instant read thermomater to check my milk/water/sugar mixture before adding my yeast. I made sure it was around 110 degrees and my eggs at room temperature as well. I put my oven on the lowest setting before making my rolls and warm the bowls as well. I also sifted the salt into the flour using a large, fine sieve mixing it through with a whisk to get it thoroughly mixed in. I also used real unsalted butter instead of margarine as I don't care to use that much margarine. Sure it's more fat, but it's healthier than the chemicals in margarine. These proofed well and needed very little kneading. They came out light and fluffy and nice, shiny brown from an egg wash. I froze some as it made too much for us to use up in just a few days, but the ones I had left over that I only refrigerated were actually better the second and third days! I can't wait to make cinnamin rolls and savory rolls with this recipe. Good recipe to play with!

I tried the recipe twice and was disappointed each time. The end result was not light and fluffy, maybe the yeast I used was out of date. :(

I love to make rolls/bread and have tried dozens of recipes. This is unbelievable. Do exactly what it says and do not let any liquid get too hot - over 120 degrees. It is not as warm as you think so get a therometer.

This is a delicious recipe, but the sugar is way too much.  I cut it down to 1/8C which was still a nice sweet flavor.  I actually prefer savory rolls so I would cut the sugar down even further next time.  If you like a touch of sweetness, stick with 1/8C it's perfect (in my opinion).  Also - I made the dough in my BREAD MACHINE for those of you wondering if you can successfully do that :)  It worked like a charm!  Thank you Sherlie!

Fantastic rolls just taken them out of the oven and they smell gorgeous,  followed some of the tips, put a little less sugar, made sure liquids were not too hot, put salt in with the flour, added the fat last, used margarine didn't have any butter, I cut them smaller so I have 30 rolls an OK size for kids. This is my number 1 top recipe for rolls from now on, so easy anyone could make them.

This is a wonderful recipe! I used half white and half wheat flour, added some gluten, and made Navajo tacos. They fried up very nice and was perfect for dinner.

I'm an avid baker, and I wanted to try something new.  I chose this one due to the many reviews.  The rolls did not rise as much as I would have liked, and when I baked them, they came out too dense and heavy.  Perhaps it's because I had to add so much extra flour.  I did not add more than a cup, but apparently, it was still too much.  The dough was way too sticky and difficult to work with.   I'm deleting this recipe from " recipe box".

Used this dough for cinnamon rolls and they were amazing!  It was such an easy dough.  Can't wait to try it for rolls.

The magic of yeast and flour (and sugar)!  I will repeat what many reviewers mentioned about the lightness, fluffyness, and flavor.  I used butter instead of margarine and coated my baking pan with butter.  These rolls were fabulous!  I also needed to add at least 1 1/2 cups of additional flour to the final kneading process due to the stickiness and the dough was still somewhat sticky, but this must be the secret as others have said.   I doubled my recipe because I wanted to freeze some rolls.  It was harder to work with so much dough and I kept running out of baking trays, but believe me, it was worth it. With so much dough, I made my rolls BIG!  This is a wonderful recipe and there is no need to look elsewhere. I will be making these again.  Thank you Sherlie for sharing this with us!

Wow. I made these with half whole wheat and half all-purpose flour, and they were AMAZING. I forgot to grease the pan so they stuck a little, but they still came out okay and tasted wonderful.

Pretty much the easiest roll recipe I've ever made. The rising & baking time is very short, unlike most recipes. Easy and delicious.

Very unusual method, but it works.  Dough did not seem to rise much when on counter, but did rise while baking.  Very different roll.  Had the taste of a baking powder biscuit (don't know how with no baking powder) but the texture of a yeast roll.  Very good.  Will make again.

This is the only roll recipe I ever use.  The recipe doubles well when you change the serving size.  A few family memebers request that I make extra for them to have some to take home.

These were easy and delicious!!  Taste just like the ones I used to buy at the grocery store.  I did watch a tutorial on You Tube on how to shape a roll...it helped quite a bit.

These taste okay but they are a horrible pain!  i have never been so annoyed making bread before.  I had to add so much flour later on and they were still always so sticky. The directions are very different from any others i have ever used so i am not sure that it works just right.

Really good, basic roll considering the uniqueness of the recipe. Little on the dense side so I will either make smaller rolls or loaves next time. Won't be making any other changes, they were very good!

These rolls were amazing I was little concerned on how they would turn out after reading all the reviews I had no problem getting them to rise also I did not have to add any extra flour. When the rolls were done I broiled them a little to make the tops golden brown then buttered them and served them with chili my family loved them I defiantly recommend this recipe and don’t let the reviews scare you try them for yourself yummy stuff great with chili.

They had a good texture and looked beautiful. They tasted great but are a little sweet for a dinner roll.  I bet this would make a great dough for cinnamon rolls.

The rolls did not taste like much of anything. More sugar should be added to give it a little more taste/flavor. Although I followed the directions to a T, i think that they could have been better somehow. Maybe I will try to make them again but, overall I was not impressed with this recipe.

Awesome!!  I didnt brush with egg as I like a softer roll...I also used the dough to make Scary dipping fingers for my little ones......They loved them.....Huge hit in my house.....I made the dough as per instructions except I added salt later (thanks to a review) and I made the dough in my bread making machine and turned it out to finish in the oven......Cant say anything bad about this recipe

Beautiful looking buns! I mixed them up using the traditional method, and let the dough proof once for an hr, before shaping and letting rise for an extra 1/2 hr. They rose even more as they baked. Just a tad dense for my liking; but that may be the extra couple tbsps of flour I added to the ever so sticky dough.

These were very dense and yeasty. I had to put garlic salt on top after baking to make them somewhat edible, like bagels but very bad bread gone wrong bagels.

These rolls were fantastic!!  I've made this recipe several times now and every time I do people can't keep their hands off of them. This recipe also makes great breadsticks.  I just brush them with some garlic butter and then sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and parsley. Thanks for the great recipe, I will be making these again and again for years to come!

I've only made rolls using the bread machine - nervous about yeast and kneeding. But I made these tonight and they were DELISH! I followed the recipe to a T.  I got my milk to about 115 degrees.  I also kneeded the dough a little bit (adding some extra flour) before shaping into rolls.  Easy!

This is the first time I've ever made dinner rolls and the results were surprisingly delicious! I halved the recipe because I only had a 2 1/4 tsp package of yeast, and still got 12 large rolls. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written. Just don't forget to use a plastic bowl!

These rolls were edible, but I really did not like the taste at all.  They were a little too dense for my liking as well.  I'm glad I tried them once but I'll try a different roll recipe next time; I won't be making these again.

MMM!  I made these rolls for Thanksgiving.  And, while everything turned out well, I think these rolls were my favorite.  They were really moist and fluffy.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Best recipe for anyone who is first learning to make bread. I've used this recipe for ten years and am amazed at how perfect this bread turns out each and everytime. I used this recipe to make loaves and not rolls, and I also use this recipe to make cinnamon raisin bread. I've taken this bread to work and have requests ever since.

All I have to say is Yes! These rolls live up to their name. I have to admit, as I read the method I was thinking to myself - "What?! Oh well, I'll give it a try anyway!" I am so glad I did! These are my new favourite rolls. It was so delicious, soft, light, mmm! I did use a candy thermometer to measure the temperature of the milk mixture before adding in the yeast and egg. Thanks so much for sharing!

These are terrific.  I used a candy thermometer to make sure I didn't get the milk mixture too warm, and kneaded more than "lightly."  I also replaced 2 cups of the flour with whole wheat flour.  They're light, fluffy, and just the right amount of yeast flavor.

Great recipe. Very light rolls with a good flavor. I only had 2 packets of yeast, (2 1/4tsp per packet), and even with being a little short on what the recipe called for, I had no problem getting them rise.

The title says everything!  These are unbelieveable!  The best I have ever ate.  The only change I made was that I added a little more sugar, but they were perfect even before doing that.  My husband just has a sweet tooth.  You can't go wrong with these.  I was making them 3 times a week we liked them so much!  Thanks for this recipe!!!!

These were too dry. I am a pretty experienced baker, so I was careful with temperatures of all of the ingredients, but it still didn't turn out the way I had hoped.

I'm in the middle of baking these right now.  But I just wanted to note that I am following this recipe with minor changes.  First I let my dough rise in a cool oven with a pan of hot water in the bottom, and also let it bake with the pan of hot water as well. As for the recipe, it was super easy, I didn't knead it very much and left the dough sticky.  I let my kitchenaid do the work.  It rose to double it's size within 40 minutes and then I buttered my pans and my hands extremely well and shaped the dough.  ...now I am going to finish this in 11 minutes when the rolls are done.  but so far I am a fan of this easy recipe!!  :o)  .... Umm... Yumm.  Very light and fluffy.  they are a tad sweet, but i bet they would be scrumptious with butter.

I always have a terrible time trying to make hot rolls. This recipe worked out for me.  The rolls were a little to heavy but it could have been an error on my part. I took half of the dough and made cinnamon rolls and they were fantastic!!  I say give it a try

Everyone RAVED about the rolls at thanksgiving dinner! Easy to make, easy to plan so they came right out of the oven as we sat to eat! Only things I did differently was: all organic ingredients, unbleached wheat flour (I prefer spelt but couldn't find any), real butter was used, and of course organic evaporated cane sugar. Perfect recipe... thanks Sherlie!

WOW. Thi recipe is the BEST dinner roll recipe ever! I actually did mine in my new Kitchen Aid Mixer. I just warmed the liquids minus the eggs and butter and added it to the mixing bown and added the yeast to that, mixing with the dough hook. Then i mixed the eggs and the melted butter and added that to the liquid mixture. I gradully added the flour until the dough was no longer sticky. Yum yum yum!

These rolls were the first I have ever baked. They turned out great! The only problem was that they were just a tiny bit dense, but I think that was because my yeast is kind of old, so I can't blame the recipe. I did listen to the advice of others and proofed my yeast first and added the salt to the flour instead of the yeast mixture. I used butter instead of margarine due to personal preference. I have always been scared of baking, but this recipe has turned me around! I only made two to test it out. Can't wait to make a whole batch for Thanksgiving tomorrow!

Delicious and incredibly easy!  I actually rolled my dough out to about 3/4 inch and placed the circles touching in a buttered 9x13 pan.  I buttered the rolls before and after baking.

I'm rating this recipe a 3 due to its simple instructions, however, I apparently did something very wrong because my rolls tasted somewhat like a biscuit and weren't very soft. I made sure to read many reviews and make mental notes of suggestions. I was so excited to try the recipe but disappointed at my results. I guess bread making is not my thing:)

In the words of my daughter, "These rolls are awesome"! Little caloric pieces of heaven. Not for those watching their weight. I used butter instead of margarine because I never use the stuff. They are very moist and a bit on the doughy side when you butter them. I had to add a lot of extra flour at the kneading stage. I've been making bread for over 30 years and these are pretty easy but you have to "know your dough" or you might get a flop.

These are good rolls.  I did follow the recipe, but not the process.  I took warm enough water to even out the cold of my milk, not to kill my yeast.  I also made sure my eggs were not cold and I just dumped it all in and mixed.  I did store in my large Tupperware bowl with lid for rising.  These make alot more rolls that the recipe states, depending on the size you like.  I saved some of the dough in the fridge overnight to make cinnamon rolls.

These were so easy to make and tasted so good!  I rolled them 2 different ways, some just like the recipe says and for the others I used a muffin tin and stuck 2 balls of dough in each hole.  I let them rise on a heating pad set to low. I don't know why but the ones I made in the muffin pan turned out better, they were lighter, than the ones I rolled the regular way.  Both were good though.

A very easy recipe that made excellent rolls.  I made the rolls smaller and baked them in a rectangular roasting pan as pull apart rolls.  I brushed them with melted butter when I took them out of the oven.  Will definitely make these again

This is a great recipe, especially for beginners with yeast! I cut the recipe in 1/2 and ended up with 11 big buns. half of which i inserted chocolate in the middle and they turned out great! by the way, I lessen the dry yeast to 2 table spoon because i am using instant yeast. (4 tblsp for the full recipe)

I was really really surprised at how well these turned out. Considering the bare-bones instructions and weird technique, I wouldn't have thought they'd come out good!

For those who crave details in recipes (I do), here's what I did:

1. I used instant (or bread machine) yeast
2. Heat milk to around 110 degrees. Much hotter and you'll kill your yeast (instant yeast could have been added to the flour directly, as it does not need to bloom like regular yeast)
3. I made 16 rolls, but they were quite large. Softball sized! This works ok, but you could easily get 32 smaller ones.
4. Used butter and it worked and tasted great. Margarine is never an option in this house :)
4. Add just enough flour to make the dough workable to form. For me, this was about 1/2 cup, plus some on my board when I was forming the rolls.

This will be the only recipe I use for rolls from now on! Yes, the directions are seemingly a bit odd compared to my other recipes I've used in the past, but the rolls were fluffy, tender, and baked beautifully!  It helped that I read other reviews first, and some of them clarified some of the recipe instructions a bit... and I followed the clue about the salt and added it on my last knead before I shaped and baked the rolls.  I believe that helped tremendously.  Around here, we like to pull our rolls apart, but these bake better and prettier with a little space between them.  Also, my only complaint (and no one else agreed with me except my fiance') is that there was not quite enough salt in them.  I'll be adding 1.5 x the salt. OHHHH, and it said 16 servings... so I doubled the recipe without reading ingredients first or I'd have realized it was going to make more than sixteen rolls. LOL  I make my rolls small, and we ended up with about 7 dozen rolls.  LOVE this recipe, and if it doesn't work for you - maybe read some more reviews to catch some hints from seasoned bakers, and make SURE you check the exp date on your yeast.  I had bought some without looking at it in the store and it was already expired. Also, if it has encountered extreme temps it won't be as good.  Keep those things in mind, because this IS virtually fool-proof.

These were really easy to make, they looked nice, and they made my house smell fantastic, but both times I've made them I haven't been able to *taste* them.  After all the great reviews I was expecting them to taste fabulous, but even after adding a ton of butter to the baked rolls, I couldn't get them to have any flavor.  I don't want to add cheese or spices, as I wanted a plain, but not plain-tasting, dinner roll.  I've never made a bread that didn't even taste like flour before.  If anyone knows how to give it a "bread" taste, please let me know!

I may use this recipe in the future when I want to make garlic cheese bread, but I don't care for them as-is.

I hate giving bad reviews, and I'm sorry.  I'll give them one more try, and if they turn out, I'll edit my review.  Thanks anyway.

I hate kneading and now I don't really have to!  Instead of adding more flour, I just put a little butter on my fingers and was able to handle the dough fine.  They were fabulous.  They have received rave reviews.  Two people have even deemed them possibly the best homemade rolls they had ever had.

This makes a lot.  I cut the recipe in half, made 8 rolls, and they still filled a 9x13" pan.  I brushed butter on them right as they came out of the oven and they were pretty tasty.

Excellent! My hubby loved them. I halfed the recipe and used a 0.25ounce package of dry active yeast instead of 2 and 1/2 tbsp. It turned out very well.

This roll recipe is so versatile.
Initially, I thought it was going to be a hassle because it has to sit 3 times. I prepared the rest of the meal working around the rest periods. Next time I will make cinnamon rolls. They remind me of the pan de sal rolls from the filpino bakery in weight and texture. Thanks!

These turned out nicely, but the sweet dinner rolls recipe on this site turned out better for me.  These were not as light and fluffy and flavorfull as the other recipe.  But still very decent.

These rolls are good but the dough is so sticky!!! I couldn't move my finger while trying to knead it and that's after adding 1/4c. extra flour! And forget forming balls; I had to scrape what I could off my fingers to form as much of a ball as I could. I had myself laughing the whole time! They are sweet but not overbearingly sweet. I was hoping for a fluffier texture so I will try another recipe. These are good though. Not my favorite and my husband likes them but he says the same....something about them could be better.

These rolls seem to change flavor a lot in one day. The first day I thought they were too sweet, but still good. After that they started tasting too floury for my liking. Plus, I tink 5 tspns of yeast is too much. I let them sit for about an hour each time, cause I had always thought that the longer the bread rises, the better it would taste. Maybe I'm wrong. Or maybe I killed the yeast by overheating. Either way, I will try these again, since I believe it's my fault.

Due to being low on milk and all-purpose flour, I substituted buttermilk and 1/2 bread flour 1/2 all-purpose. It made no difference in the quality of dough or taste. I used my KitchenAid mixer for kneading and it came out sooo soft and near perfect. I had to keep adding more flour-probably an extra 1/3 cup. All in all, they came out well but not what I would call a dinner roll. They remind me of an afternoon tea roll. Oh-and they made way more than 16-probably about 24. Next time I will use the dough for cinnamon rolls.

These were nice, but definitely would not make for dinner again. Very sweet bread, it reminded the family of brioche. Great rolls that looked gorgeous, but are definitely more of an afternoon tea sweet, rather than a dinner roll.

This was wonderful and easy.  I made oval-shaped rolls, wet a serrated knife and made a length-wise cut half way down the center.  Next time, I am adding sunflower seeds.  Thanks, Sherlie!

These were yummy rolls - they looked a little like biscuits because I didn't take the time to shape them nicely, but they tasted good.  I especially liked that there was very little clean-up since you can do all of the mixing/kneading in one big bowl.

AWESOME!!!!!!!!  My husband LOVES these, and company has always eaten more than one.  If you didn't find these "unbelievable" then you must have done something wrong.  We love the slightly sweet tase, and they have a great texture to them.  They come out a bit large, so we usually cut the recipe in half.

A great classic recipe to have.  I put all the ingredients in my bread machine and made the dough and then shaped the dough into rolls.  It makes a lot of dough, though.  My 2-pound machine was bursting with risen dough.  For the finishing touch I melted butter and dipped the tops of the baked rolls into the butter.  Mmmm...

I think I screwed these up.  I followed the recipe, but my dough came out so soft that I couldn't shape balls out of it.  I did add about a cup and a half extra flour, but was worried that much more might ruin the recipe.  Any advice?

FANTABULOUS!!!!!! they are goof proof, as long as you make sure your yeast is activated nicely, you will have delish rolls, or a loaf of moist bread, they are sooooo good, and taste better then any of the "bread machine" breads I have made.. infact I made them this turkey day, and I had to bake more after dinner, everyone was asking where the bread went, the texture of these so perfect, I also make the best cinnamon rolls with this bread dough...  10 stars!

I give it 4 stars, but my family gives it 5+ I am sure:) I thought these tasted a bit like store bought rolls. But, they weer easy and actually sort of fun to make :) I made 12 cloverleaf rolls ( and they were huge-rose quite a bit!) and one small batch of cinnamon rolls. DH said I outdid myself-LOL! I replaced 2 cups of the flour with wheat flour and I also did not use all margerine--I replaced about half with olive oil (and since I eyeballed the oil, I am sure I used a couple Tbs less than needed...). I think next time I will cut out some of the sugar as these seemed a little (just tad) to sweet (but then that worked well with the cinnamon rolls:). I of course, due to popular demand at my house, will make these again :)

I have made bread before, and although this was not any easier than any I have made, it was simply delicious!  Light and fluffy and eaten in one sitting! A keeper.

Hurray!!! This was my first time making rolls from scratch. They came out perfect! I just heated the first mixture shortly- just till it was warm. ( not anywhere near hot) I also bravely tried this margarine I found at Whole Foods- "Buttery Sticks" by Earth Balance. They have no trans fat, are not hydrogenized, & have 1/2 the saturated fat of butter! Needless to say, they turned out great!!! I made 24 cloverleaf style rolls by forming 3 small balls of dough & putting them in each muffin tin. I still had leftover dough, so I made a small loaf of bread with that. I can't wait to try to make cinnamon rolls with it! Thanks so much for this easy yummy bread recipe!

These rolls were fabulous!  I had a little dough leftover after filling a pan with 24 rolls, so I decided to try making cinnamon rolls with the rest.  I made little mini cinnamon rolls that were just like candy with this dough!  Also, I like this recipe because of its staged process.  I can do just a little bit at a time on it while I'm cooking the rest of dinner.  It works out great!

I didn't really care for these rolls. My husband and I thought they were a little too dry.  They were very easy to make, but rather time consuming if you are a busy person.

I'm sorry but I must have done something very wrong with these. I was not at all happy with the way they came out. They were very dry and course. I'm sure it was just me and I'm gonna give it another shot here soon. All was not lost tho, I ground them up and am using them for bread crumbs.

This recipe wasn't that good. I've made better rolls myself, but since there was so many good reviews for this recipe, I decided to try it.  Not again though.  These rolls were more like biscuits than dinner rolls.  My family did like them, but suggested that I go back to my usual recipe.

Even though these didn't rise for me (I'm sure it was entirely my fault), and came out kind of heavy, they had an excellent tate.  They were so big, I wonder how large they would have been if they had risen.  I will definitely try these again.

These rolls are a perfect consistency! I will add a bit more salt next time though - they are a little on the bland side. I will say that they are on the short list for Thanksgiving dinner!

The cinnamon buns came out perfectly, everyone loves them and say they are the best they ever had.  I halved the recipe and baked them in stoneware.  I icing them with store bought cream cheese icing right when they come out of the oven.  Perfect every time!!

Although I cook a lot, this was my first attempt at homemade rolls.  I have always wanted to, but was a bit intimidated.  But, after reading all the rave reviews I decided to give this recipe a try.  They were wonderful!  And, it was so easy.  They were soft and buttery, exactly what I was looking for.  And, boy, do they smell good baking!  My entire family loved them.  These Incredible Rolls will definitely become a regular part of our meals.

This recipe did not turn out well for me, but I think it was the baker and not the recipe. It was my first time making rolls. I am going to watch my mother-in-law make rolls and then give this recipe another try. I will let you know how it turns out.

These buns were great looking and texture was perfect, BUT they were too sweet ( more like brioche than the bread rolls I wanted). Very good french toast, though.

If you have trouble getting these to rise a couple of things that help me. After adding the yeast let the liquid sit for a few minutes and you should see the yeast start to work, little patches of bubble filled tan splotches...if no action it means the liquid was too hot or the yeast too old.
I also ALWAYS put my yeast mixes on an electric heating pad like you use for muscle soreness.  I do this even when in Florida when the temp hovers in the mid 70's Sheath the bowl in a plastic grocery bag,,easy and less annoying than cling wrap. Use a big bowl and the bag never touches the dough, 15 years of constant yeast baking has taught  a few tricks 

These are the rolls I have been trying to make for 10 years. Excellent. First couple of times I made it I used butter,now I use coconut oil ,,I love butter but have started using coconut oil lately for something different.  A little difference in taste but noticeable.  Made these 12-15 times and good every time.  I added the butter once at the wrong time,,into the liquid instead of the flour,,I didn't notice any difference in taste or texture

I've made these rolls twice mow! This the best, most flavorful recipe. I read the reviews & put the salt in the flour rather than with the yeast mixture. Be careful not to over heat your milk & sugar, that will kill the yeast & your bread will never rise.

I have tried to make rolls for two years and they never turned out right. Thanks to this recipe and the advise on how to get my yeast frothy, they turned out perfect!! I did buy a thermometer and check the temperature. I think I was killing my previously killing my yeast with water that was too hot. Thank you everyone!!! I feel so accomplished now!!!

First time I made these, I measured. Second time I weighed. Second is better.
First time the dough was sticky, second time I added 1 Tablespoon more flour. 
First time I weighed 2.5 oz. Dough to make buns. I thought they were to big for my needs. Second time I weighed 1 oz to 1.4 oz. Much better. 
First time I didn't use parchment paper or a silicone mat. Second time I used both. The buns got to brown on the bottom with the parchment paper, perfect with the silicone mat.
The flavor and texture are OUTSTANDING

Everyone loves this rolls! I use it weekly for get togethers and for making cinnamon rolls. I don't use as much yeast as the recipe says when I double or triple the batch and it doesn't seem to be a problem.

This is my go to recipe for rolls!!! I'm thankful that I found this about 6 years ago and make it often. These are foolproof and very very tasty!!!

What this recipe died not tell you is that you heat your milk mixture to only 105-110 degrees!! Overheat and it will kill your yeast where your bread will not rise!!!!

In love with this rolls! I made them before breakfast and my family was in awe!!!. They are super easy to do, just follow the recipe but applied a few tips from others like putting the salt after the yeast not before.

This is THE roll recipe! My only issue is the process/directions. Start with 3/4 cup of warm or slightly hot water and a tbsp of the 1/2 cup of sugar, put your 5 tsp of yeast in there and whisk, then let it sit for 10 minutes or more, it will bubble up into a fluffy mass, you'll whisk it down later. This is "feeding the yeast" in bread making. Once you do this you don't have to worry about the cold milk and eggs or salt, your yeast is stable and ready to go. Add the rest of your wet ingredients (and sugar and salt) and whisk well if doing by hand (I still do with the mixer for good measure, I want everything well combined, but you don't have to) then go on with adding your flour and kneading/adding more flour. If you are using a stand mixer use an extra cup of flour (total of 6 cups, edit: I actually need the extra cup only sometimes, start with the 5 and see how it does) this is the perfect amount. Dough will be tacky and still slightly stick to the bowl (especially on the bottom), this is ok, if your dough is dry your bread will be too, we want it to be good and moist, so stickiness is good. Do your tbsp of oil for the rise, to keep your dough ball moist and oil the bowl to prevent sticking. Also recommend melted butter on the tops before and after baking, really takes it to the next level. Always super happy with these rolls, they are fabulous!

I made this recipe and as I suspected I am assuming the warm/hot milk killed the yeast no rising ever occurred and I bake a decent amount of bread so I do know that this yeast was alive and well just a few days ago. I will try the recipe again and maybe allow the milk to cool for a while before hand.

So fluffy ! I loved these. I made into smaller rolls,about 30. I used my kitchen. Just proofed the yeast by adding the sugar and the milk to it in the bowl of the KA. Then added the rest of the ingredients and let the machine knead the dough for about 8 minutes(I needed to add another 1/4c of flour). Let it rise in the same bowl  till almost double the volume. I, then made into rolls. I put little bit of avocado oil in a small bowl and kept dipping my fingers in it to oil my hand before handling each roll which helped  release the sticky dough from my hands and made the rolls smooth and easy to shape . I let the rolls rise a 2nd time and then brushed with an egg wash. I baked at 375 for about 20 minutes. I am planning to make these often, and thinking of reducing the sugar, increasing the salt and adding some dried herbs for a more savory rolls. These can also be made into hamburger or hot dog buns..

Great recipe, only changes i made was 1/4 cup more flour, let it proof in a hot humid room (i run an open kettle in the laundry room for 5 mins to make it hotter but the humidity keeps it from getting too hot) and i had to bake for an additional 5 mins (also kneaded more than the recipe called for)

This was a hit with my family. The rolls were very tasty and pretty dense. The dough was shaggy, not smooth, so I was afraid they would turn out too dry but they did not.

I don't understand people's need to tear apart and alter the recipes on this site.  This dough is amazing just as it is.  The only thing I would say is to watch out for the vague directions on heating the liquid over "medium"heat.  Remember, yeast is alive and heat will kill it.  I just warmed it up and stuck my finger in the liquid (my hands were clean) to just feel warmth.  That's all you need.  The yeast mixture bubbled up perfectly in the covered bowl on the counter.  I used the dough to make cinnamon rolls and you couldn't ask for better rolls and dough.  This recipe is simple and easy.

Does not rise at all, bricks that are under baked in the middle and burnt on the bottom should be the name of this recipe.  Ive made breads and rolls for years and never had such a Horrible experience have no idea how anyone gave this more than one star.

Only gave this three stars because it is not an easy recipe for beginners. I do some baking but bread baking is my new challenge. I have tried some bread recipes in the past and they came out well. This one did not. I will definitely use the tips from the reviews and try it again.

These are the easiest and most delicious yeast rolls I have ever made. Not much kneading required which can be done right in the bowl. For those new to working with yeast, make sure the milk and water mixture have cooled enough so the yeast will breathe and the rolls will rise. I made 24 large rolls with this recipe for my 2018 Christmas dinner. I slightly over cooked them because the middle roll still seemed rather doughy and raw when I tasted it after 15 minutes. I will definitely make these again. The flavor is wonderful.

OMG-these rolls are absolutely amazing! Look no further. I was determined to make the rolls for Christmas and I tried two other recipes, that I was underwhelmed with, and am so happy I found this one. They rise beautifully and taste like a brioche roll...so flavorful and rich. After reading the reviews, I made two very minor changes. I added the salt to the flour mixture and not the liquid and I also brushed them with an egg wash before baking so they browned perfectly. I wound up with 15 rolls in a 13x9 dish. And they rose so much they were actually larger than I would have liked. I’m going to bake them on a cookie sheet next and plan on about 20.

I absolutely love this recipe. Can I make the rolls up a day before then bake them the next day? Everyone loves these, doesn't matter if they're dinner rolls or cinnamon rolls.  I want to make cinnamon rolls for work but I want them hot when I take them to work not cold. And really don't want to have to get up 2 hours early to make them.

Followed the recipe. Didn't have much experience making bread with yeast, mostly just sweet breads like banana.
they turned out well. I made sure to activate the yeast. the rolls were still a bit heavier than I'd like. not sure if this is because of the recipe, or because of something I did/didnt do. they also turned out kind of dark. all in all, like I said, they turned out well, but I wouldnt use this recipe again.

I have tried A LOT of roll recipes. My husband and I love the flavor & texture of this one most. They poofed up beautifully. I do recommend checking that your milk mixture is 105-110 F before adding the yeast. It will kill the yeast if too hot. I'm allergic to eggs so I used an egg replacer and it worked perfectly. I brushed with melted butter right out of the oven to give a little crisp & shine to the tops. Followed the rest of the recipe exactly. I will be making these for Christmas Eve dinner along with my late grandmother's preserves. Thank you for sharing!

Taste is good.  Batter goes together so easy.  Texture more like a biscuit than a roll.  The instructions are missing details like how many rolls to create and how far apart on the baking sheet. So I winged it.  probably would make this recipe again.

Perfect texture, but I did punch the dough down three times. Five teaspoons of viable yeast is a lot, and it rises very quickly. I just wasn’t ready to bake yet, so I punched them.

Instead of water, I used buttermilk. Once It was finished cooking, I slathered melted garlic butter on it. Warmed, it was Sooo Good :D

I proofed the yeast in the water before adding it to the milk. I had to knead it for about 10 minutes to get the right consistency. Made 8 beautiful rolls for hoagies.

Yummy! Ended up needing more than an additional cup of flour than what the recipe specified, but besides that the recipe worked out wonderfully. Definitely rolls I will make again! We bagged the leftovers & they were still soft & chewy the next day—success!

Substituted 1 cup of flour with wheat flour to change flavor and texture a bit.  This is a good recipe.  I would recommend it to those looking to please their food friends.

The only change I make to this recipe is using real butter instead of margarine and omitting the salt so as not to  the yeast. I also add 1 1/2 cups of whole milk instead of half water half milk. This rolls are truly unbelievable and I use them to make pretzel rolls (wash in baking soda and water before baking), cinnamon rolls (simply roll out dough into giant rectangle and brush melted butter, brown sugar, cinnamon then roll up, slice, bake and top with either homemade buttercream or cream cheese frosting), and even just large weekday loaves of sandwich bread. All purpose wonderful!

When following a recipe there should be exact instructions, like how warm is that mixture etc.  Sadly when followed as written these turn out like hockey pucks.  Dense and taste is horrible.  I'm thinking the higher ratings are due to people changing the recipe then rating with their change.

Everything worked very well.  I found them browning a bit too quickly so I covered them with foil for the last few minutes.

Simple and easy.   While I didn't make the actual buns, I used the recipe for pigs in a blanket and they turned out great.  I would definitely use it again.

Turned out great!! Made exactly as directed. Fluffy and beautiful!! These rolls are on the sweet side; perfect for peanut butter or Nutella sandwiches.  If you don’t like a sweet bread, I would reduce the sugar in half.

I liked this unconventional recipe, and the rolls were very tasty! I have two questions: does 16 servings mean 16 rolls? And, my rolls did not brown on the bottom, did any one find that also? I am thinking that they need to be closer to or right on the bottom rack of the oven? I set my oven for convection for 400 degrees. I made 15 rolls, and left them in for an additional 6 minutes to try to brown the bottoms. They did not overcook, were not dry.
Thanks for your thoughts.

Perfect every time.  This recipe is great for cinnamon rolls.  I was skeptical about filling the well and leaving it covered, but it works. I do not have a stand mixer, everything by hand, and this turns out every single time with minimal effort.

Very easy to make and I didn't burn it or make it where it was a brick :)  Will make this again.  Mine were huge though.  They weren't the size in the picture they were about 3 times the size.

Super easy, super yummy! Got rave reviews at Thanksgiving and requests to make them again. The result is very much like my grandmother’s rolls - slightly sweet, slightly dense but not heavy. We put a little butter on the tops while they were still warm to keep them a little softer. This recipe made about two dozen for us. I can’t wait to try it for cinnamon rolls.

Made the dough a day before thanksgiving and let it have its first rise in the fridge overnight and baked it the next day. They turned out great! Had pretty good flavor and the texture is in between fluffy and dense. Everybody liked them at dinner.

Not so foolproof. I’m not a professional but I do a decent job in the kitchen and it has been years since I had a failed recipe. Not anymore! Happy Thanksgiving to me and mine. I followed the recipe exactly. I’m good at following directions... perhaps too good because this recipe was too vague for me. 2 hours to get rock hard hand weights! Perhaps something more specific than 20-30 mins to rise times three. That’s the difference between an hour of total rise time and an hour and a half. Chef Boyardee  is more specific than that with a boxed pizza crust.  And how much flour if it is sticky? If the recipe is for bakers only and not just people who can follow a recipe... please let us know up front so we don’t have to be this years “no thank you rule” victim!

this recipe is outstanding i only made two changes. 1. i replaced one cup of flour with coconut flour. 2. i steamed them in place of baking. then i buttered the top once they cooled a bit and put under the broiler to brown the top. this made them so airy but the recipe is amazing definitely will keep this.

The dough was easy to mix and work with. I proofed the yeast first and then added the eggs,  milk,etc. The dough rose quickly- -I gave it 40 minutes just to be sure. I formed the dough into 16 rolls, and they were pretty big.  Next time I'll make 20.  I think you could get 24 if you were doing cloverleaf  rolls or butterhorns. Very tender.

My husband and three-year old son loved these. I'm always trying to find a good, easy roll recipe and this one will be a staple. I didn't make any changes to the ingredients, but I did let the dough rise for an hour instead of the 20-30 minutes. Definitely a keeper, but I will say they are a little yeasty tasting.

I made this recipe as stated. Yummy! I was very surprised at the first time results and I didn't read the reviews until I had already added salt in the egg/yeast mixture. They still rose well. They turned out light, fluffy and absolutely delicious! I noticed some people said they had to add more flour. Well, the directions stated you might have to add more if too sticky. I did have to add some but no more than a fourth cup. For those that may be having problems shaping the rolls due to stickiness, I suggest spraying your hands with cooking spray or buttering your hands. You don't want to compromise the texture of your rolls by adding a bunch of extra flour. I added a picture but don't let the ugliness of my rolls deter you from using this recipe. I got 18 good size rolls it of this recipe and in 15 minutes I have less than 10 rolls left. That should be a testimony for the taste! Now, to savor the work of my labor! I will definitely be making these again and thank you for the great recipe!

I live in Australia and would call this a brioche roll and they are very special here. Some restaurants would call them gourmet and serve them with pulled pork or specail meats and special desserts. So, yes they are a beautiful soft texture and a little sweet. I will reduce the sugar next time. The recipe turns out perfect and they would be great with any kind of gravy, soups or stews or sweet dish. This was my first attempt so I will definitely recommend this recipe and thank you!

I made this yesterday for a large crowd, and they have a great flavor but I wasn't crazy about the texture -- they came out more like a biscuit. I did make some changes so next time, I'll follow recipe exactly. What I changed was: Heated milk & sugar in microwave then monitored the temp till it was 110 then added yeast & let it proof. Also, I used only milk, not water. Once foamy, I beat the eggs and added them with the salt to the milk mixture.  At that point, I followed the recipe exactly. Maybe all these little changes affected the texture. Will make and rate again:)

These came out great. I did not follow the instructions only the recipe. I used a bread maker to mix it and then let the dough rise on the counter with a damp towel over it. I formed into rolls in round pans. They are light and fluffy.

First off, I think there is too much yeast in this recipe. That being said, this is very similar to a  recipe I've been making for years. Tupperware FIX N MIX BREAD: 4 1/2 cups  AP flour, 3/4 cup scalded milk, 3/4 cup cold water, 1/3 cup sugar, 1 tsp. salt, 2 beaten eggs , 1 pkg. yeast, 1/2 cup melted butter; very similar directions. The FIX N MIX dough makes the easiest ever, and most delicious, cinnamon rolls!

Very good recipe. I increased to 24 servings and they're was ample dough for 16 dinner rolls and a dozen cinnamon rolls. I would give it 5 stars but I didn't care for how the bottoms of the rolls were a bit hard. It may be because I  moved the pans to the bottom rack of my electric oven to give the bottoms some color. Maybe a paler bottom would have been softer. I will make them again for sure, so will try that. Very soft and tasty though.

I changed some things.  I set the oven to bake at 375.  I bloomed the yeast in the water with some of the sugar, didn't add the salt in until I was blending the wet ingredients with the flour, and I used coconut oil instead of margarine (I could have used butter but I just wanted to try them with the coconut oil for laughs).  These are wonderful and chewy rolls!!  I baked them on two separate sheets and next time I make them I think I'll put them all on one big sheet so I have more soft areas and not as much crust.  I brushed them with a butter+olive oil combination during baking.  They are WONDERFUL and I'm definitely saving this for later.  If these are heavy you're doing something wrong with the yeast.  Yeast is so temperamental so I always bloom it first no matter what the recipe says.  great recipe, thank you sooo much and I'll save this whenever I make my pulled chicken barbeque!!

WOW! I have never made rolls before in my life & this recipe worked so easily and perfectly! I didn't think they were rising enough but put them in the oven anyway, thinking I have enough time to try a different recipe if they don't turn out. Amazing! I'm looking at them and omgosh! they look so pretty that I had to try one even though I don't eat carbs (usually) and especially not margarine.  I must say, they are very fluffy and wonderful....or maybe I'm just impressed with myself . But YAY this recipe is a keeper :)

If you are looking for a light and fluffy soft roll this is not it. I made it exactly as written. I made sure my milk and water mixture was less than 110 degrees  so I am sure I didn't kill the yeast. I proofed my yeast in warm water and sugar first so I know it was active and alive. However the rolls didn't rise very much and turned out dense and heavy. They are also sweet.  As far as the flavor goes they would be good with honey butter, but not really with a savory dinner. The texture is just not very good. I make bread all the time, including yeast rolls so I am not a novice. This recipe just isn't very good.  I believe it might need a little more rise time for both the first and second rise.  I believe it may also need to be kneaded more than a "light knead" to develop the gluten so they will be puffier.

I followed the directions to the T and they came out perfect!  I noticed that some folks had a hard time...the directions said to just WARM the milk mixture, not make it HOT. My family enjoyed every bite of these unbelievable rolls.  I made these twice and both times were perfect!

Made it for the first time for a family Christmas dinner - risky, I know, but sometimes I'll serve a new recipe if I trust the ingredients. Thanks to the post from the cook who said she made this twice and the rolls didn't rise, I checked to make sure the milk-water combo didn't get too warm - when I tested the temp it was between 110-115 degrees f - so as not to kill the yeast. (I have done that before!) These were lovely rolls.. Made about 20 - some smaller than others to suit my family. They went fast and I got the compliments. The only possible problem: I may be the "roll-model" for many Christmases to come.

AWESOME recipe!!! never made rolls or any bread before and I'm very proud about my rolls!!! They came out better than expected! Thank you for shearing this great recipe! 

For the ones whose dough didn't rise enough or took longer to rise. It is also important that  you let your dough rise in a warm area. I was baking something in the oven and I let my dough sit on top of the stove and it rose beautifully and faster than the recipe said. 

BTW, can anybody tell me if I can  store some of the dough in the refrigerator for another day? This is a lot more dough that I needed for one day. I already made a dozen rolls and I have enough to make probably 5 dozens more!

Too bad Sherlie wasnt able to amend the original recipe. Letting the eggs come to room temp may have been my problem. Wouldve been good info to know right from the start. I didnt have a sticky dough- mine was too dry. Im still in the process so Im not sure if adding warm water to the dough will help or not. (Im obviously not a baker). I read quite a few reviews but stopped one or two prior to Sherlies. Used a lot of the recommendations such as proofing the yeast and so on.  We, lets hope for the best!

While I understand the "strange" instructions of letting the slurry ferment in a well within the flour (to eliminate yet another bowl being used, and to ensure 100% mixture), I wish there was a specific temperature listed for how warm to heat the milk to. I think I did mine too hot and killed the yeast. My rolls didn't rise at all. They were dense, but not terribly so. The flavor was still astounding, but I would have liked light and fluffy rolls as I was expecting. I also ended up turning the oven down about 25-degrees and cooking them about 2 minutes less. This gave the bottoms a firm and golden brown bottom, instead of the near-char the first batch produced at the temperature/time listed.

I will be trying this recipe again, with a few variations. If I change several things, I'll end up listing it as my own recipe-variation.

This is a recipe that is easily made well if you have any bread making experience. Just don't overwork the dough and you come out with a wonderful bread that reminds me of potato rolls, but less work.

I've struggled for years to make good dinner rolls consistently. These were super easy to do, and turned out light and fluffy. A big hit for our Thanksgiving! You want the dough to be a little sticky. Coat your hands in flour as you roll them into balls. The sticky dough makes them fluffier. Use salted butter or add additional salt to give these more flavor. Excellent overall!

I would rate it 4 stars for easiness, but they turned out more like tall lumpy biscuits for me, so i am thinking I didn't knead well enough.  Used rapid rise yeast, everything started out at room temperature, and the rising was good.  I will try again, though, as the folks I fed liked the idea homemade rolls more than the purchased ones I had as back up.

This is the best roll recipe I have ever made! I used butter instead of margarine and brushed the tops with melted butter, before rising, and then again when the rolls were done baking! This is superb! Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Excellent flavor and fairly easy to make. The container used needs to be seriously airtight. I have found that it sometimes doesn't rise as well as other times and found that it had to do with the container. Otherwise, this really is a very good recipe. I am going to make it for our belated Thanksgiving today and will add garlic and oregeno for some extra flavor.

I made these today, pretty much as written (only change I made was to proof my yeast beforehand in the water with a tablespoon of the sugar).  They turned out excellent! Soft, yeasty (in a good way) and fluffy.  Thanks for the great (and easy to follow) recipe!

Had to use quite a bit of extra flower when it came time to knead the dough. A little egg wash before throwing these in the oven and you're good to go. 11 minutes worked perfectly for my gas oven. Awesome recipe.

This was my first time making homemade rolls and this recipe was perfect! The only problem I had with it was that it was too sweet. Would using less sugar ruin it? Or does anyone have any tips on how to make them less sweet? Otherwise they were perfect!

Dough is sticky, but some doughs are. I did not add any flower, just used extra when forming rolls. Texture was one of the best ones, taste is excellent, only way too much sugar. Second time I used half sugar.

Use hottest water from the tap, add milk, warm it up in microwave if it is not warm to touch (it should be comfortably warm, NOT burning hot). Add sugar and eggs and mix, add yeast. I add my salt into flower and mix it well.

Mine took more flour, but the dough was so easy to work with and the results were tender and tasty. I would definitely use this recipe again. It made a dozen rolls and a loaf.

My rolls always come out kind of dense and with a thick crust. Also, when pouring the mixture into the flour, do you cover the liquid with the flour before covering it up?

this recipe was amazing thank you for posting. I followed Sara Jo's directions and it well so well. Thank you Jesus !  After other failed attempts ,this one finally prevailed (could have been the prayer but...)
  the only thing is i  did a egg wash on the buns, once before they baked and  just before i took them out, the second egg wash i put honey just a little. Also, i used evaporated milk because i didn't have reg milk. thanks again.

this was my first time making rolls, so I was worried that they wouldn't turn out well. I doubled the recipe and it worked perfectly! I will definitely make these again.

These turned out beautiful!  Could not believe the instructions, but somehow it works.  My only problem was not getting them all closer to the same size, but they all baked beautifully.

First off - a huge THANK YOU to Sherlie for an awesome, literally foolproof recipe. 

Bread is the one culinary bane I have. I'm enthusiastic but rarely ever success. This recipe, as long as you follow it to the letter is idiot proof. 

Two things. I replaced the margarine with butter as I like the taste of butter better and I used a kitchen thermometer to make sure the wet liquids weren't too hot. If they're over 105-110F, you'll murder your yeast before you start. 

I used med heat on my stovetop and still had to cool the liquids for 5 mins before the temp was right.

Brilliant recipe! Thankyou so much!! I can FINALLY make good dinner rolls!!

I've tried so many times over many years to make bread with mostly disappointing results. This is the first time I've ever made absolutely perfect bread! I'm so excited! I followed one reviewer's advice and didn't add salt during the first rising.

I made this recipe for the first time this morning for a catering job.  They were amazing.  I followed the directions exactly (accept that I was making them for 120 people),  and they turned out light, fluffy, not too sweet and delicious. 
Thank you so much for this recipe, it will be be my go to for rolls, every time!

I've never received so many compliments in all my years of bread baking. I made the rolls up until the final rise, shaped them, put them in the refrigerator overnight and when I took them out the next day let them sit for a couple of hours before baking.

Very easy and I made sure to watch that my milk wasn't to hot for the yeast. I did use butter instead of margarine as some recommended.  They doubled in size, I will make them smaller rolls next time.

These are amazing! I followed a few suggestions. I proof the yeast before adding it to the milk and eggs, combined the salt with the flour and I used butter. I also bake them divided between two 13X9 baking dishes. These are my go to rolls!

Absolute family favorite! When we have our big family dinner (weekly) I double the recipe. I end up using 2lbs and 8 oz of flour and divide it into 40 rolls. The dough is pretty sticky but I sprinkle each roll with flour before I shape them so it doesn't stick to my hands. I follow the directions most time and it's delicious. I've been playing around with the order and when I mix the ingredients together and so far they've turned out wonderfully each time!

My last attempt, nearly 20 years ago, baking buns did not go well so when I wanted to try again, I was very nervous.  For the beginner  this recipe is excellent, easy and quick.  The buns turned out very well and I would recommend this recipe in a heart beat.  For a beginner, I also really went out on a limb and made a filling of cooked hamburger, onion, sweet peppers and seasonings to taste.  I rolled a 3" x 3" section of dough flat and added about 3 Tbsp of the hamburger mixture and and wrapped the dough around it before making it into a bun and letting it rise the second time before going into the oven.  I also made a wash of egg and milk to give the bun a nice shiny finish.  Lovely, Lovely recipe.  Thanks for posting!

There's always something I need to tweak after making a recipe for the first time. But not here. I don't do margarine so I substituted butter, otherwise this recipe is just about perfect as is. Awesome. Definitely a keeper!

The direction did seem a little strange, but I did try these. They are great. This will be what I make all the time now. Next time I think I will put a little Rosemary in the mix when I pat them out.

I did it!!! I've never made bread or rolls before and wanted to give it a shot (I had store bought rolls as backup) and they worked! I followed the recipe with a few changes I had taken from some other reviews like making sure my water/milk mixture was 105 degrees, eggs at room temp  and adding to salt to the flour.  I even double the recipe and they are soft, fluffy and delicious! Thank you!

Deliciously divine rolls. A tad sweet for our taste buds but they rose perfectly. The rolls were buttery and moist and we'll certainly make these again (with a smidgen less sugar!)

Oh my god I made these rolls following the exact steps (not my first time making bread, rolls, etc) and they came out tough, flavorless, and really bland. The taste was SO BAD, I don't know but I'll just stick with my traditional recipe cause these rolls turned out so horrible I couldn't eat more than half of one.

Note to self: this recipe makes perfect rolls if you keep the dough sticky instead of adding flour to fix the sticking. Adding the extra flour makes the rolls taste more like thick biscuits.

I followed the directions exactly and they came out great.  If you like a sweeter roll, then you'll love these.

I have searched a long time to re-invent my Grandmother's recipe.  I will never be her, but this is a perfect start for me to pass on to my children. The work involved creates a bonding time for us.  Thank you!

Excellent! I made these in conjunction with "Angie's Perfect" rolls recipe on this site as well for my dinner party and most people preferred this one. The dough was SUPER sticky (almost a soup!) and I was forced to add about four more tablespoons of flour to make it manageable. But it turned out marvelously.
My only complaint other than the additional required flour is they weren't close to done at fifteen minutes...I appreciate accuracy.

I've made these 5 times now. My family didn't believe they weren't our grammas recipe....it's virtually the same ingredients but the no knead aspect is life!  I made stand alone rolls (cookie sheet) and clover rolls the first time, and changed to the "regular way" in a 13x9" pan the last 4 times, for whatever reason they're better made in the pan for sure.

This is a great tasting, simple to make dinner roll! I made it following the recipe almost exactly (I didn't have margarine so I used 5 tablespoons melted butter and 3 tablespoons vegetable oil instead). I made 22 rolls and baked them for 14 1/2 minutes. I'm looking forward to making cinnamon rolls using this recipe, as well.

These were so easy ... My 12 year old son made a batch and they turned out pretty good! (My job was just to read the directions.) We made 2 dozen. I noticed the batch on the light colored baking sheet seemed fluffier than the ones on a dark pan. Also, my yeast "best by" date had passed by a few months but we made sure the milk mixture wasn't too hot and it seemed to work fine.

These rolls were excellent and very easy.  Slightly sweet and very tasty.  I will definitely make them again and again. I used butter instead of margarine, didn't  have any margarine, and I feel they turned out great. I will try margarine next time to see if there is a difference.

I used butter instead of margarine. My rolls were too brown (but edible) after 14 minutes in the oven. They tasted great. I used bread flour. Will make again.

I  made these and it's really easy.  I read the review that said to  pound the  dough as you  form each of the rolls to reduce the yeast flavor.  I promise I pounded each roll.  I didn't get the "yeasty " taste to lighten. But my family (most importantly my handsome Honey Honey) loved them!

This is an excellent recipe! I make these all the time and always get requests for the recipe. The directions do seem a bit strange but they work! When heating the milk mixture, make it a bit warmer than what you would want it to be when you add the yeast so when the cold eggs get added they will cool the mixture just enough so you can add the yeast and the mixture will be the right temperature. Do yourself a favor and use butter instead of margarine. Butter is always better!  Also, minimize the amount of extra flour you add when the dough is sticky. Instead, use vegetable oil or olive oil to make it more workable. This will prevent the rolls from getting too heavy and dense and keeps them from sticking to your hands.

Awesome Stuff right here - I replaced the regular sugar with Truvia Baking Mix to bring down the sugar content (trying to make it a little more diabetic friendly) and doubled the recipe. I used half of it for cinnamon rolls and the other half for regular dinner rolls. Amazing! I did have to stir it up though - I may have made my "well" too deep. However, I also did not need to add hardly any flour at all after mixing, and the kneading was very minimal. All around, a very easy way to make a new favorite!

Great roll, yes the dough is sticky (wear a plastic glove and it's not a problem). I only had to add a sprinkling of flour at the end, I'd rather my dough be on the wet side, I think you get better bread. I only used one pack of yeast and got nice rise, they multiply you know so no need to waste another pack. I microwaved the milk and water to proof the yeast, Finally I used Olive oil, I just can't bring myself to use margarine...It's just not natural

I thought they were similar to sister shubert rolls. They were pretty large but I'm sure I could make them smaller in the future. The flavor was pretty good.

Hands down best recipe I have used yet. I have been cooking breads as a hobby for almost 20 years. Most come out hard, some over proofed, flat and 3 out four times I have perfect rolls. This recipe is now a standard in my box. Unbelievable is right. I warmed my milk mixture in the microwave and when I added the eggs and yeast and checked with a thermometer @ 100 deg I set in the microwave for 8 seconds (1100 watts) to heat up the cool down mix. The yeast proofed perfect during the bowl time before mixing. Hats off to you sherlie on this recipe. This is a keeper. 3 more stars.

Made it last week and was very satisfied with the result.  I did not bother to heat the water and it worked just fine.  As with other bread recipes I have tried,  I have always used water or milk at just room temperature even though the recipes specified warm water.  I live in Manila and our ambient temperature this summer is usually 85 to 100 deg F.

The first time I tried this recipe I did something wrong and my rolls came out more like a biscuit.  I knew from reading the reviews it was my fault. I don't have a mixer to mix the dough and had to do it by hand. I figured this is where I went wrong. Went on you tube and watched a few videos to see what the dough should look like when coming off the dough hooks and to see how long the dough was kneaded. I tried the recipe again today and using my new found knowledge. Everything came out perfect this time.  The rolls were light and fluffy with incredible taste.  I made cinnamon rolls, a strawberry cream cheese braid, and dinner roll and a couple of cheese danish all with one batch of this recipe.  I used an egg wash on the bread and it all came out beautiful. This one is a keeper.

Fantastic recipe-the first time I made them I forgot the eggs(I was rushing) and they still came out great. Everyone raved over them so I didn't mention my goof.

I made these for Easter today. They came out nice and soft, and everyone loved them. I used butter instead of margarine purely because that's what I had on had. Made as instructed, and when it was time to shape them I put them almost touching on a large stone pan/cookie sheet. They all fit on one which made things easy for me. I bet this dough would indeed make good cinnamon rolls as well.
UPDATE:  Used this recipe yesterday to make homemade hamburger buns!  I halved the sugar because I didn't want them as sweet.  They turned out awesome.  Also, for both the rolls and the buns, I cooked for about 10 minutes, and then laid a piece of foil over them while they cooked for five more minutes to keep them from getting too dark.

I followed the recipe exactly as written. Within 8 minutes of being in the oven, the bottoms of these rolls burned while the tops still needed to be baked longer. The whole recipe is in the trash.

This recipe is definitely a keeper. It was so easy to make. I'm going to try making cinnamon rolls with this recipe next. It had been years since I'd made bread from scratch, so I wanted an easy recipe to get me back in the swing of things.

Absolutely amazing rolls. I make them with full milk and with Trumps High Gluten (bread) flour. It add a little more structure to the roll. I make these all the time at a 1/2 recipe strength in my bread machine, but I proof the yeast and milk and sugar and butter first and pour it in last. So, I layer high gluten bread flour at 2.5 cups, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 egg, 3/4 c warm milk/yeast (2.5 tsp)/sugar (1/4 cup)/butter (1/2 stick, or 1/4 cup) mixture. Warm as a hot shower, but not to scalding temps. Use dough setting. Would make a great pizza dough too, with reduced sugar. Watch the bottom, it burns FAST. Pizza stone seems to work best.

These are THE BEST ROLLS EVER. ever. ever! I have been making rolls for about 5 years and have never made a roll like these. They are hugely fluffy, golden on top, and flavorful. They're even good the next day (and the next) which is sometimes hard with homemade breads.
I do make 1 minor adjustment: I substitute 2 of the cups of flour with bread flour. 
I've also made this recipe with less yeast (about 4t.) and I've skipped the last rising time (in a rush) and they're just as good. 
Also, I've made these for Thanksgiving dinner and everybody raves about them.

This recipe turned out great for me the first time, but not so good the second. However, that is only because I did something very different the second time. The first time was on thanksgiving and I had to cold put them in the fridge after the last rising while I waited for the oven to be empty. The second time I didn't do that. So the next time I make them I will add about thrity extra minutes before they are baked to cold proof them. My husband couldn't complain about them at all on thanksgiving and the kids were still loving them the next morning. They turned out golden and moist and done (for me that's a challenge) with the cold proofing. I recommend the cold proofing to anyone who tries this recipe.

I made these rolls this week for dinner. My family absolutely loved them. They came out perfect. I'm so glad i came across this recipe it was exactly what i was looking for. I did tweak the recipe a bit but with those changes they were amazing rolls. I will not be making any other rolls other than these. Thanks for sharing!

I have used this recipe several times, both for dinner rolls as well as cinammon buns. The whole family loves it. For anyone with a sweet tooth, using it for the aforementioned treats is great. I take a wee bit of the sugar out when making dinner rolls. I think that's about the only change. Oh, and I never use margarine. I'm a butter gal!

This is the best roll recipe that I have found. My rolls tend to turn out a little thick and not always fluffy not matter what the recipe says. These were perfect. I would suggest not letting the milk mixture get too hot though, or you will cook your eggs a little (I did it the first time and had to start over), but other than that, this was a SUPER easy recipe. My over is a little finicky, so the top rack had extra brown tops and the bottom rack had extra brown bottoms, but no burnt ones. Might cover the tops next time to see if that helps.

These were SO EASY and delicious! I used 1.5t regular yeast, 2T brown sugar, 1/4c coconut oil for 1/2 the recipe & a plastic bowl with a lid as suggested. I baked the 8 sandwich sized rolls in the toaster oven at 400*, but covered the tops with foil after 7 minutes, as they were browned enough. The top of the plastic mixing bowl kept popping off during the "rests", but the dough didn't rise too much (I guess the gas from the yeast was doing it?). The dough was easy to handle and I will definitely make it again, even for burger/hot dog buns because it's so quick & easy.  Thank you so much, SHERLIE!

Prepared as written - not so much success.  Read the reviews and proofed yeast first, turned out great.  Have experimented using this as a base and have made as rolls and bread with cheese, nuts, whole grains all turned out great.  Thanks

These were good for a quick roll. They were best when they were warm from the over, but but lost something when they cooled. Serve these fresh and  warm, if possible.

Amazing recipe - I followed the recipe as written and only replaced the margarine with butter because I didn't have any margarine.  Fluffy and light with a touch of sweetness.  Make sure to use quick rise yeast and that your milk mixture is not too hot (less than 100F).  Will definitely make these again!

This was an incredibly fail proof recipe.  My dough was very sticky as I wanted them to turn out tender I did not add additional flour.  The end result was tender but not as light as I wished for.  Will play with this recipe as it is a keeper due to its ease.

I'm not sure what exactly that milk is doing to that flour while you let it sit there for 30 minutes, so I don't really see the point in the odd instructions. I did, however, follow the ingredient measurements to a T and put them in my bread machine on dough cycle, according to manufacturer instructions. I didn't melt the butter, just cut it into small bits and added it to the warm liquids at the bottom of my bread pan. Once the dough cycle finished, I continued with recipe instructions. I made slightly larger rolls to be used for pulled pork and OMG was it delicious!! I also did an egg wash (1 egg white + 2tsp water) prior to baking because...shiny! Anyway, the taste and texture of these rolls are amazing and I will definitely be making these again!

These started out WAY TOO STICKY to work with and when I added just enough flour that I could touch it, they ended up quite dry and hard. Have been making rolls/bread from scratch for 15 years and never had the issues that I had with this recipe. Sorry!

I made these for thanksgiving 2013 and EVERYONE loved them. My SO and our son even asked me to make them again today. I did, but today I was so distracted that I forgot to add the eggs! Oops! Know what though? They are still delicious and no one even noticed!

I'd say these turned out pretty good, can't comment on the taste as I can't eat them but the fam said they liked it, sadly our oven decided to cook hot and burnt a few of them other then that they turned out well.

I am making the dinner rolls for Thanksgiving. I am nervous about the process of waiting for the yeast in the bowl. I have never make my rolls homemade. Usually, my rolls are store brought from the freezer section. I look forward to the deliciousness. So I am excited and nervous too. I will rate my rolls later.

I tried this recipe for the first time tonight, the rolls came out looking beautiful, they rose very well. They were very light and fluffy, the only disappointment was that they were much sweeter than my family likes them. I will definitely use this recipe base again, but with less sugar. Overall a great recipe, these are great if you've a sweet tooth. I'm satisfied because this is the first roll recipe I've made that has turned out with a roll texture, thank you Sherlie for the wonderful recipe! :)

EXCELLENT rolls! Very easy recipe, and I am a seasoned bread baker. This recipe makes VERY large rolls if you make 16 as per the recipe. One could easily get 24 smaller rolls from this. The taste was GREAT!

These were awesome, but I did make them the more tradition way. I heated up the water and a teaspoon of the sugar in the microwave for one minute and fifteen seconds.  I then I added the yeast (a packet) and stirred it to make sure it was all dissolved.  I waited for about 20 minutes for that to rise/foam up, then I heated up the milk and butter and salt.  I put it in the microwave for about one minute and 15 seconds, just enough for the butter to melt.  Make sure the mixture isn't too hot or it will kill your yeast. Then I added the milk & butter/salt mixture to the yeast and water, then I added the eggs and the rest of the sugar and I mixed it by stirring it. After that I add the flour (I used self rising flour) about a half cup at a time stirring to blend it until it is all in there. This mixture is very sticky, so I coat my hands with butter or oil and it makes it not stick to my hands while I knead it with my hands for about six to eight minutes. Then I let it rise in a dark warm place.  I usually warm up a cup of water in the microwave for two minutes, then shove the dough (in its bowl) in there with it for about 30 to 60 minutes (all up to your patience).  Then I fold the dough down, some people call it punching down, but I feel that is too rough.  Then I let it rise again for about 30 minutes, then I take it out and form it into ball, while coating my hands again.  I cooked it in the oven for 18 minutes.  Turned out perfect, fluffy, but dense enough with great flavor.

I have made this recipe many times over about a 14 year period, It is absolutely a wonderful recipe for rolls and very versatile, I usually make a crescent type roll with it by rolling 1/2 the dough into a circle, then using my pizza cutter to cut the circle of dough in half then in quarters and depending on the size of the circle cut quarters into thirds or halves. If you want them more like Croissants then you can make flaky layers by spreading butter (not margarine) on the circle then folding in half spread butter then fold again repeat then roll into a circle again, you will have layers and the rolls will be more flaky. When you cut the circle into pieces and are ready to make your rolls roll from the larger side of the wedge. make sure than the point is down against the pan, Baking time is about the same 12 to 15 minutes watch closely after 12 minutes, ovens vary.  Enjoy, we do, my Grandson requests these rolls. When making I follow the recipe exactly, except for what I choose as a method of presentation. ALTHOUGH I do after reading some of the other reviews agree that leaving the salt out until after the proof or proofing the yeast first with out the addition of salt. Makes for a better dough. The possibilities with this recipe are absolutely endless it is very versatile.

Great recipe for experienced cooks and those not in high altitude areas.  I made them and substituted only one thing...margarine is out of the question.  Using butter means it actually bakes into the rolls much better, IMHO.  I really like recipes for experienced cooks so this was quite simple to me but it is not for someone who doesn't know what temperature "warm" is for adding yeast.  Also, the temperature in your kitchen and the humidity level can all affect the outcome.

I proofed my yeast and it was very foamy, and otherwise, followed the directions. The rolls didn't rise much after I rolled them into balls and placed them on the cookie sheet. I let them sit in a warm place but after about 40 minutes, I decided to bake them. They didn't rise really at all in the oven. They wouldn't have been too bad, but they had no flavor other than a mild sweetness. It was an odd taste for a dinner roll. What saved them was I took the remaining dough (I only made a dozen small rolls) and made sticky buns with some of it, and monkey bread with the other part. I let those sit in a warm place for another hour or so, and they rose some more. (maybe the added warm sauce they were in helped?)Anyway, as sticky buns, they were great. The monkey bread was also good, according to my husband. I was too busy eating sticky buns to taste the monkey bread.

I am not that good at making rolls, but I have to say I tried this recipe and the rolls came out excellent.  Light and tender melt in your mouth good.  I used my bread machine on the dough cycle.  I warmed the milk, sugar, water and salt in the microwave first making sure it warm and not hot, then I added the eggs and then the yeast.  Then the flour and butter and they came out great.  If I did this wrong you would never know it because they were Super Good.  This is a keeper and I will make again and again.  Thanks Sherlie!  I may try cinnamon rolls next.

added 1 tbsp honey and used dazedoo's method to make these rolls, they are pretty quick to make, as far as breads go I made half rolls and put the other half of the dough in a loaf pan.  I sliced up the loaf bread and make some yummy croutons with it.

The directions are weird with pouring the liquid into the flour and letting it sit w/o touching it, but I've made this recipe a few times now and it's foolproof! Rolls turn out beautifully! Make sure your liquid isn't scalding and recipe should work. I let mine rest each time for 30 mins. Putting them on a flat baking sheet makes a nice rounder roll, while putting in a 13 x 9 pan makes them rise taller as they are more squished and makes stunning tall, fluffy rolls. I use my kitchenaid stand mixer. When it's time to mix and knead I mix with the regular attachment just until it comes together, then I switch to the dough hook and literally only knead for about 20 seconds. Works for me!

This is a very good recipe. Something fast and easy to cook up. My children were very impress on how good they were. My mom and sister even enjoyed them that they have asked me to make them for each of our family dinners. Im not a huge bread maker but I am when it comes to these.. Thank you for sharing.

I have made these rolls twice, following the recipe exactly and they have been amazing both times.  I have not had any problems with stickiness of the dough - which may be because I'm a more experienced bread baker - and find it easy to knead into a silky soft dough.  Easiest rolls I've ever made; very light and full of yeasty, delicious flavor.  I do like to brush the tops with an egg wash before baking to get a shiny golden crust.

These were 'meh'...I've made many a bread recipe and this was nothing exciting. I made mine into larger rolls for sandwiches and my boyfriend said it was a delicious sandwich bread...but I'm not so sure. Will be trying other roll recipes.

Meh.   Very bland and more of a biscuit than a yeast roll...which is what I was looking for.  I've worked with yeast for years, so it's not that I didn't know how to proof it, etc.  Didn't vary the recipe at ALL.  They looked great, and rose nice.  But definitely a biscuit...not a light and fluffy type of roll.  Not bad...just not what I wanted and lacking in flavor.

Keeper!  Simple with great results.  I warm my milk, water and sugar in microwaveable mixing bowl rather than on the stove top and don't add salt until I add the flour.  I have found that I have to add extra flour and have done with part wheat flour with success.

These turned out great!! The only changes I made were cutting the sugar down by half - don't like sweet bread too much - and brushing with an egg wash before baking. They were perfect and surprisingly quick!

Very easy, and tasted great.  I think the egg wash taste the best (I tried a milk, an egg, and a butter wash).  Will be making these again!  Thanks for the recipe!

These are unbelievable! Just made these and I love them. Soft, moist and delicious. Can't get my 2 yr old to stop eating them. I used 1c whole wheat flour and 4c of all purpose. Followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Can't wait to make them again.

I used this recipe in my bread machine on the dough cycle and it came out AWESOME! I warmed the milk, water, sugar, and salt on the stove. Added it to the bread pan, then added my eggs, flour, and dry yeast in the center on top of the flour, and hit start. After it was done in the machine I shaped into balls on my pan and let it rise for about 20 minutes and it was perfect. I topped with a little honey butter before placing in the oven. My oven cooks a little on the hot side, so I baked at 375 for 10 minutes. Will make again, and again!

Excellent roll recipe! I made a few modifications. I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup and used 1/4 cup Splenda sugar substitute (I have diabetics in my family). I mixed the salt in with the flour instead of the wet ingredients, and I used butter instead of margarine. I let them rise longer (about 45-55 minutes between each step) because I had plenty of time on my hands. Then I brushed the tops with a beaten egg right before baking. I then dipped the tops in melted butter after they came out of the oven. Everyone loved them & they looked great!!!

I made these as directed.  I used less than one cup of flour for kneading/shaping, the dough was delicate, not intended to be made dry and smooth as with most breads. I formed 24 rolls and put in a jelly roll pan (greased).  I brought them to a neighbors for Thanksgiving, with great reviews.   I did use an egg wash after the final rising-one egg white, one T. water, they were gorgeous.

I used 2c wheat flour 3c white flour... next time I would do a 1:4 ratio.  Don't over kneed... mine came out a little heavy.  Overall great taste though!

These were very tender rolls, inside and out.  My recipe ended up changing due to my not realizing I didn't have all the ingredients until I was in process of making the rolls.  I didn't have eggs I found out after I made all the wet ingredients.  Not wanting to stop and waste it, I looked up substitutes.  Flax came up often, and I actually had some I'd used once before.  Really wondering if this would taste good (and truly thinking it would NOT) I used 2 T. flax (ground fine) plus 6 T. Water.  Of course after reading the reviews AFTER I had the wet ingredients realized I didn't have margarine so I used 1/4 cup shortening and 3 T. butter plus a T. Olive oil.  I was very very surprised that they tasted good and were pillow soft.  They tasted like rolls, with a very slightly nutty flavor which actually enhanced the rolls flavor.  My husband and I were extremely surprised, we both thought that they'd end up in the garbage.  These did have a yeasty flavor, I think next time I'd reduce the yeast.  This also made an incredibly huge amount.  I made one pan of 12 rolls, which is enough for my family of 4, and had probably 3 more pans of dough left, but we didn't use it.

These are delicious.  They are the death of me though.  I tried two times before with the letting them sit times.  I live in Houston, TX so we have a lot of humidity that works against rising times.  They were good, had to let them sit for 45 mins in between.  Maybe longer next time!

If your looking for a soft dinner roll this is it. The only thing I changed was no sugar instead I used honey, two heaping tablespoons.

These made really great cinnamon rolls. I also made dinner rolls and they were more dense then I would prefer. I was worried because so many peoples rolls turned out like biscuits, and I have never used yeast before, but follow the directions and you will be very happy.

Guess what? These really are unbelievable! This is probably my new go-to recipe when I want to make rolls. I will say though that they are very "yeasty" with 5 teaspoons of yeast. I personally like that in a yeast roll, but if you don't you might want to keep looking. I needed a little extra flour as well. And this makes A LOT. I like big rolls, so I made 12 rolls, and they were indeed BIG. Thanks for the recipe.

These weren't as fluffy as I imagine they would be, maybe they didn't rise well enough but they were sort of like soft hockey pucks. :(  I'll make dough in the bread machine next time.

Someone else did these scaled down, so thank you for saying so...gave me the nudge I needed to try these out for just two of us at home. I scaled to 6 rolls, and used a small egg. Anyway, as a dinner roll, though light, it was not the taste/texture we like for dinner rolls HOWEVER, these make fabulous sandwich buns. We'll be having these again and again, I think. Moms with lunch boxes to fill...these are a winner!

Really good - slightly sweet, soft.  I made them smaller than the recipe calls for - made a batch of about 50, and used them for mini cheeseburgers at an appetizer party.  I made them ahead of time - they freeze well.

Beautiful!!! I'd used these for a garlic/cheese roll base; tried both kneading the cheese and minced garlic through the dough as well as rolling out the dough as you would do with a cinnamon scroll; tried placing each both on a baking sheet as well as in slightly greased muffin tins - just different presentation; either way came out perfect!!  I'd used Colby cheese; and it turned out wonderful; not to sharp, not to mild; and over the top of the roll I'd brushed a bit of beaten egg white for that wonderful golden colour.  Will definitely make these again; with different fillings and as the recipe is actually written by itself - the seal of approval was my very finicky 7 year old went back for thirds!  (As did my hubby!)  Thanks for this beautifully tender, flaky, roll!

I thought these rolls were awesome.  I used highly active yeast and added a bit more flour as the dough was too sticky to roll.  I also used bread flour and sifted my flour.  They turned out wonderful.  As for some of the reviews saying these were dense, the yeast may not have been fresh or not sifting flour seems to make them dense to me.  They cooked a little faster than the recipe says.  I bought an oven thermometer to check to make sure my oven heats correctly.  Thanks for the recipe.  I am going to try them with cinnabon rolls.

Very easy and yummy rolls! Family loved them. I did add my salt to the flour mixture instead of on the stove. Brushed with melted butter right out of the oven.

I have made yeast breads before but I've NEVER made it like this!  I thought the recipe was worth a try because I liked the convenience of the one-bowl preparation, minimal kneading, not having to flour my counter, etc.  Mine turned out ok, not great.  They were very dense but that's probably because I rushed the rising time and I crammed too much into a pan that was really too small.  It is definitely worth a try to improve on my technique because it was a very easy way to make fresh dinner rolls.  My girls love rolls so if I can perfect this recipe, we'll be having these often.

For Thanksgiving I wanted to attempt homemade bread rather than store bought.  I have never cooked bread or used yeast so I was unsure how they would turn out.  I used the 1/4 oz. packets of Fleishmann's highly active yeast.  Each packet was enough for the 16 servings.  I read a few of the other reviews and as for me I used a regular white plastic bowl (like you use for cakes)for the entire process and the milk came straight out of the fridge. During the setting times I went with the full 30 mins. to be on the safe side.  After doing that the 3 times as instructed, the prep is time consuming but well worth it.  I also pre-beat the eggs because it's a little difficult to do that in the flour mixture.  When I take them out of the oven I immediately brush melted butter on the top.  The recipe was simple and the rolls were great!  Everyone loved them and I've made them several times since Thanksgiving. They reheat beautifully in the microwave.  I just cover it with a paper towel and heat it for 15 seconds.  They also make great ham or sausage "biscuits" the morning after.  As for the shape being like biscuits, I rolled mine into balls and after tucking the sides underneath, they came out perfectly.   Thanks for sharing this one!!

these have the slightest hint of sweetness flavor, and they are beautifully shapes! the only problem is that the temperature may be a little high, or maybe the length of time cooked is too long, because the bottoms were black, but the rest of them were perfect! (my cookie sheet is heavy-duty and good quality, and they were right in the middle of the oven)

If you want a light, fluffy dinner roll, this isn't the recipe.  I was disappointed, although they tasted great, the texture was too dense - almost biscuit-like.  The dough was so sticky I had to keep adding flour.  I'm not quite sure ut must have added 3 or 4 more cups of flour before I was able to work with it.  Next time I'm going to try adding the salt after the flour is added; like another reviewer suggested, and also try using with self-rising flour.

WOW!  These were FANTASTIC.  Typically, I don't like making yeast rolls, I'm always scared that they won't turn out, but these were simple and tasted GREAT!  Easy to do and were gobbled up faster than anything at our Thanksgiving dinner.

Very good, I followed the instructions exactly, except to put them in the refridgerator an hour or so before I was ready to bake them.  They were WONDERFUL.  I did have to cook them a few minutes longer only because they were chilled.  My husband and kids loved them as well.  Very easy to make.

I made this in the bread machine so I added 1 1/2 T. vital gluten and 2 T. dry milk, and halved the recipe. They were wonderful! I proofed the yeast first. Light and tender, the perfect roll.

Okay, this is my first time to review a recipe but these were fantastic!  I was looking for a recipe for rolls for Thanksgiving and since my KitchenAide mixer is broken I needed one I could easily do my hand.  You truly only need to knead this lightly and the rolls are sweet and tender.  I can see using the dough for sweet rolls like sticky buns or cinnamon rolls.  The only thing I may do differently next time in make smaller rolls these got so big while baking I think 20 - 24 makes a better size for dinner rolls.

I have never made dinner rolls before and this was sooo easy.  I shared them with my brother and some of the girls at work and they were all impressed.  I had to email the recipe to them all!  On a side note, I also had to add quite a bit of additional flour to the dough in order to knead it because it was REALLY sticky.  But the end result was absolutely worth it!

This was the first bread recipe that I have ever attempted. I thought the rolls turned out good. I read over some of the reviews and took the tips on keeping the temperature of the milk mixture warm- not hot/boiling. I also needed more flour during the kneading process. This recipe was pretty easy, tasted good, and looked very pretty. I would definitely make this recipe again.

I loooove these rolls. I make these for special occasions and holidays, and they usually don't last the whole meal. I usually make a half-batch (which means a 2-1/4 tsp pkg of yeast is just about right!), and instead of a baking sheet, I make 9 smallish dinner-sized rolls and place them in a lightly-greased 8"-square pan. So excellent... Thanks for sharing, Sherlie!

Oh. 
My. 
HEAVENS!!! 
This was absolutely AMAZING!!! 
AHH! 
I wish I could rate it higher!
Wow.
They were so good, and so easy too!
I will totally be making these again. 
Since I doubled the recipe, I didn't have a bowl big enough that had a lid, so I just put plastic wrap over the bowl (carefully not letting it touch the bread, as well as being almost air tight).
Thanks so much!!!
Oh, and BTW, I cooked them in cup-cake (or muffin) tins. They worked great. Make sure to put the oven on convection if you’re cooking on more than one rack though. The convection setting on my oven is broken, so the tops of the rolls on the top rack were browned, while the bottoms of the rolls on the bottom rack we almost burnt. 

Y. U. M!

These were a very dense roll. The taste was good, and our guests ate them up, but I guess I prefer a more light and fluffy dinner roll. I was worried about the amount of sugar in these, but they weren't too sweet. They would be good served with a cinnamon/sugar butter.

These rolls are easy and fantastic! I froze half of the batch after the last rise and cooked half of those 2 days later. Just stuck them in a 350 degree oven until they were golden and they tasted like they were just made. Great recipe that will be used again and again.

Awesome and easy!!  This the first succesful roll recipe I have ever used.  I added more salt and less sugar, just because my husband doesn't like sweeter rolls. Great recipe- thank you.

Very good. Couldnt keep hands off of them. I ended up with 3 pans full. I must have made them much smaller. Reheated well. I cant give 5 stars as I have had better but these are SO easy and very good!

I would have to agree that these were pretty unbelievable! My husband loves Sister Schubert's frozen rolls on Sunday's. I made the rolls very small and put them in 8" cake pans so that the rolls were touching. They were soft and delicious. I also froze half of the rolls for later and those turned out great too! They even heated back up in the oven 3 days later and still tasted great. Better than any other recipe I have made for this type of roll!!

I totally screwed this recipe up!  I think I messed up with the whole yeast process...and trying to follow everyones directions.  These rolls gave out really heavy...but they had a really good taste.  I will try this again...I used my kitchenaid mixer and maybe I let it go for too long.

I didn't follow the directions, but then I almost never do bc I never read them (it's a fault of mine, I know). . . anywho, I put in a bit less sugar than called for (abt 1/4 c) and thought they were a bit sweet still.  So, I'd cut the sugar down a bit more.  I didn't heat the milk or melt the butter--just put everything in my bread maker and hit start on the dough cycle.  Baking times were spot on--very nice and golden when done without any egg wash or water.  These make very large rolls, so if I want smaller dinner type rolls next time I'll halve the recipe and still make 16, or make 32 rolls.  Nice size for sandwich rolls as written.  I made  them for a friend; she's surprising him for Father's day, but bf snagged one and he loved them.

awesome recipe!  I have made these rolls twice now, the first time i made them i rushed them and they didn't turn out so good....insead of letting them rise on their own in the last step i put them in a proof box to help speed it along, and this did not turn out so good, the extra moisture from the proof box made the rolls brown too fast in the oven...almost burning them before they were done.  The second time was flawless....i basted them with a garlic, parm cheese and butter mixture!

I am dumbfounded. I totally screwed this recipe up and these rolls were still good. Then, I had to make them again and they were amazing. This is a great first-timer recipe; if it's not fantastic the first time, it was easy enough and good enough to try it again. I couldn't believe how little time and effort they required. Truly unbelievable!

I love bread but this was just too "yeast" tasting for me.  My husband took them to work for a potluck and they used them as sandwich buns.  His co-workers did like them.

This is a very good sweet roll recipe.  Rather than knead lightly, I just stirred very aggressively to sortof knead the bread against the side of the bowl.  I made nice large rolls which we were able to use as sandwich rolls as well.  The taste to me is similar to the Hawaiian rolls you can get at the grocery store.

These rolls are super easy to make! They are good but not GREAT. They are a little bland to us and seem to be missing something. Its a great recipe though, and i'll probably play with it a bit and try to figure out what it needs. Its worth a try, but not extraordinary.

I definitely appreciate bread recipes that don't take all day to make. I used amaranth flour and oat bran in place of part of the flour and they still turned out quite nice and light.

OMG....These rolls are so good! I made some honey butter to put on them and they taste like something you got out of a restaurant! I too added the salt with the flour and used 1 1/2 tsp. I am not a baker and these were so incredibly easy. Thank you for sharing! Awesome

This is the first time I've ever made any type of bread, they actually came out quite well. I will say, though, I was a little disappointed with the flavor. They tasted quite bland to me. I think I will try adding a bit more salt next time and may be try adding some shredded cheese.

I made these rolls with my Christmas dinner, everyone thought they were okay, but a little heavy to have as a dinner roll.  I also found them a little on the dry side.  Probably will not make again.

If you like "hard rolls", this is the recipe for you!  These were pretty dense, but maybe that's because I put in an extra cup of flour because it was so sticky?  Or maybe because the salt gets mixed in with the yeast at the beginning.  I think I'll try another roll recipe next time.  I'm looking for something light and fluffy and I think these are just a heavier roll.  I also was disappointed with the recipe's directions and the amount of things it leaves out and makes you guess (such as how long you should cook the milk mixture - I assumed we were looking for around 110 degrees - and how much more flour I should do).  The taste was good enough though and my dinner guests liked them.

These turned out wonderful -- and they were my first try at making rolls and using yeast.

I cut my batch into four and rolled them out to circles to stuff with (cooked) sausage, then folded shut.  I highly recommend them that way -- easy to eat and tasty too!

These turned out ok. Besides the fact that they tasted "yeasty" and a little bitter...Im sure I can work with this recipe. At least the next door college boy liked them. I gave him ALL my rolls that I made.

These are very good plain white rolls, tender and somewhat light, but not stand out of the crowd good.  Nice recipe for plain rolls.  I might try with honey next time.

I love this roll recipe. It is even buffyproof. I usually forget about bread, but with this roll recipe, even if I forget, they still taste amazing.
Thanks Sherlie.

These took a fair amount of time, but were easy to make. They came out more dense than I thought they would, and didn't rise much after being shaped into rolls. But this may have had something to do with the temperature of the yeast mixture possibly being too hot, or my inexperience in shaping rolls (I've never made rolls before). That said, they had a nice taste and disappeared at the dinner table when I had guests over.

The best recipe for rolls I have ever made.  I have tried many.  These remind me of the ones from the steakhouse.  It makes a large batch, I fed my entire family of 6 plus had leftovers.

These rolls were a hit with my family.  Really delicious and very nice texture. They disappeared very quickly straight out of the oven.  I even tried it with wholemeal flour and it worked perfectly.

I followed the recipe just fine, and they worked just fine, but there was nothing "unbelievable" about them.  I was hoping for something really unbelievable for the holidays, and instead they tasted like the prewrapped ones at the grocery store.

These rolls are delicious! Doubling the size of each roll they make awesome(huge!)burger buns. For more fiber in our diet we substitute about half the bread flour with wheat flour and add about a quarter cup of wheat bran. Our family can't get enough of them! Thanks for the recipe.

I gave this one only 4 stars because when they came out of the oven the looked to much like bisquits and couldn't really taste the yeast in the bread. After about the 4th or 5th try they got a little better.

Yum! I had never made rolls before I tried these.  They were perfect.  Especially with a little butter brushed on top as they came out of the oven.  The recipe says to cook for 15 minutes or until done and mine were done in about 7 minutes.

I made these rolls for a dinner that I cooked for my boyfriend's family. They came out really good!! They rose so big, I think I'll make the balls smaller next time. Also, instead of brushing with eggwhite, I might use butter..will add some more flavor to them. Great recipe!

I was hoping these would be the perfect Thanksgiving roll to pass around.  How glad am I that I prepared these a week early to try out.  They never completely rose the first 30 minutes.  And then didn't raise at all the second 30 minutes and look flat now that I've got them out of the oven.  I will not be recommending this to anyone.  I followed the directions to a "t" and still no dice.

These were awesome rolls! I am a young baker who lives in Hawaii, and these are the best rolls I have ever made! They were perfectly tender and fluffy, and disappeared within a day! I would not change this recipe a bit! Thanks Sherlie for the fantastic recipe! =)

I thought this was a real easy recipe to follow, however I wasn't all that crazy about them. They were ok, but nothing special. I put them in muffin pans and got 12 and the rest went into a bread pan. It may just be me or maybe that I let my kids assist me in making these, so I may make these again and try putting more dough in the muffin pans so they will be bigger and keep the kids out of the kitchen. I will rate it again once I try again.

These are absolutely wonderful! They're so easy to make and they taste great. I used this dough to make cinnamon rolls and they turned out better than any I've ever tasted before. Just stretch the dough out like you would with pizza,(DON'T use a rolling pin) spread a thick layer of spreadable butter on the dough and sprinkle generously with cinnamon and sugar. Cut into ropes and roll up. You won't regret trying this!

This was the first time "ever" that I made homemade rolls.  I couldn't believe how easy it was.  It was so good that I made it twice over the Thanksgiving holiday.  The second time I made them, I used more of the batter for each roll.  I was worried that they wouldn't cook all the way through, but they did perfectly!  This recipe is great because there is no "rolling out the dough".  Also, it tastes great!  I got rave reviews.
