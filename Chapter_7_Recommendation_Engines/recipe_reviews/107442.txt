Everyone loved it! Used balsamic vinegar instead of brandy.

Good flavor.  I did add about 1/4 tsp. of dill to the yogurt/cucumber sauce.  It adds a nice flavor to the sauce.

This was really good it craved my desire for gyros.  Although my local grocery store didn't have any lamb shoulder so I used a lb of sirlion, the marinate made the meat full of flavor.  I wasn't to crazy about the sauce I don't know if it was the plain yogurt or not enough seasoning it just seemed like it was missing something.  All in all really good, next time I will find the lamb and make it with that.

I have made this recipe many times over the past couple of years and love it. Actually, I like the meat preparation method here better than that for traditional gyro meat (using ground lamb, etc.) Here are the changes I make to the marinade part of the recipe: (a) substitute extra virgin olive oil for the vegetable oil; (b) omit the brandy completely (usually I add a little extra lemon juice and no more than a couple of teaspoons of balsamic vinegar); (c) drastically increase the marinade herbs (i.e. 1 tsp. each of rosemary, thyme, oregano, pepper, and marjoram along with an extra clove or so of garlic); and d) add a teaspoon or so of dried chicken broth granules to the marinade. If it's available, I buy fresh cubed lamb stew meat for this recipe--saves a lot of time cubing meat and trimming fat away. Also, I don't bother with the skewers when roasting the lamb. They really aren't necessary as long as you have some way of draining the fat/juices off of the meat while it's roasting (e.g. using a broiler pan). Finally, I like Yia Yia's Tzatziki Sauce(on this site) better than the tzatziki recipe given here. If the tzatziki is too bland for your taste, try adding in a little freshly ground pepper, rosemary, thyme, garlic powder, lemon juice, and/or olive oil. Finally, don't skip the feta cheese (even though the recipe says it's optional)--it adds wonderful flavor to the finished product. These gyros are GOOD! Thanks for the recipe!

This is a WONDERFUL marinade for the lamb! It was incredibly flavorful. I used leg of lamb because it is less fatty and just cubed it. I actually prefer a little sauce so did not drain it out completely. I didn't have any marjoram and just subbed in a little more oregano and added some coriander and paprika. So delicious! Thanks...we are huge fans!!

Excellent and not too difficult!  I got the wrong cut of lamb so it was a little bit difficult to deal with but it still turned out excellent.  Will use again with better lamb cuts.  Thanks!

This was absolutely amazing.  I didn't use the brandy, and I used flatbreads instead of pita pockets.  I think I would also prefer thin strips of lamb instead of chunks, so I will try to do that next time.  But overall, it was so, SO delicious.

So I actually use this for the spice mix.  I rub it on leg of lamb whenever we have it, and it flavors the lamb perfectly.

It was ok, the lamb needed to be cooked a little longer than stated.

Great recipe. I used goat meat instead of lamb, which was a bit tough but very yummy. Also I used a slightly different tzatziki recipe, and spinach leaves instead of shredded lettuce. The marinade for the meat was just divine!

For our taste, the marinade just wasn't flavorful enough. I added some dill to the cucumber sauce, as another reviewer suggested. and that helped, but the marinade did not win us over.

This marindade is spot on. Gave the spices a couple of turns in the spice grinder to wake them up. It seemed I had too much spice and too little liquid for the amount of meat, but it turned out perfectly. Marinaded around 24 hours in a zippy bag and it made for a quick weeknight meal the following night. Will definitely be using this one again.
