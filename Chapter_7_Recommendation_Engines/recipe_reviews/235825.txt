The cranberry caramels are a little softer than the pineapple ones. Roll the cooled cranberry caramels into balls and chocolate dip them. They make a wonderful soft center chocolate!

I made the cranberry and the pineapple caramels for Christmas last year and my family loved them.  Made the pineapple this summer.  My grandson in the Navy has requested a care package of these caramels.
