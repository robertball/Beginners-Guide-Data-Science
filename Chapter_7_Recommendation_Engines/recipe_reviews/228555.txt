This is a great dish and easy to make. The instructions didn't mention whether to add the syrup in with the fig preserves, and I was worried it would make it soggy, so I strained the figs before adding. I should have included the syrup, or at least some of it. The cobbler was delish but a little dry. I will def make it again and include the syrup.

I had made "Real Fig Preserves" by Dee last year. They are very good. The BF wasn't crazy about them on his toast for breakfast, so the jars sat in the pantry. He likes more of a fig jelly. Anyway, thought I could use them up in this dish..... seemed perfect, because this particular fig preserve recipe called for cinnamon and cloves. Which translates into great cobbler ingredients for me!  I used a 8x8 casserole and 3 8oz jars of the figs with most of the syrup. It seemed thin at the start, but came together. The BF said it was, "Heavenly". Thank you, will make again
