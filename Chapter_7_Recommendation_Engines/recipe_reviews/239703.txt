Perfect blend of flavors and just the right amount of heat from the jalapenos. This is so easy to make. Will definitely be making this again.

I've made it 4 times now. Doubled the jalape√±os on this last batch and let it cook low and slow for about an hour before serving to let the heat really get in there. Easy to make and so delicious. Loved by everyone I've made it for. Will make it again and again!

This is such an easy recipe to make! We love it in our house. Because I freeze all my own corn, I use frozen corn instead of canned and just add about 1/4-1/2 cup of water if needed. This is such a great side dish for any choice.

I used frozen corn instead of canned corn and added some milk and it was amazing! I have tried several different recipes for creamed corn and this one is by far the best!

It was pretty darn good. I think next time I would like to grill my own corn instead of canned and add extra jalapeno. I think the grilled corn would up the game a bit.

Super easy, super flavorful, I can spice up or down depending on the mood, and it disappeared in a hurry.  I had put some aside and it was possibly better the next day.

I accidentally added to much cheese (probably 2 cups). Not a good idea the cheese is over powering. 3tbs of jalapenos and I feel I should have used more. I also drained my cans of corn.

Just got done whipping this up and It is awesome!  I keep going back and tasting it, while the rest of our dinner cooks.   Super easy to put together.  The only thing I did different, was to use frozen corn as I had some on hand.

A new family favorite. 
Made this for Thanksgiving after searching for something new to break up the stale, decade old Thanksgiving menu.
I tossed this into a small crock and set it aside.
Super simple to make.
The family loved it.
Had 4 people request it for Christmas dinner.

This dish was made for a get together, and numerous people raved about it. Rather than use canned corn, I roasted fresh ears of corn on the Big Green Egg using this site's 'Corn on the Grill' recipe. This gave the corn an added smokey flavor. Doing this created added work, and only worth doing for special occasions. This recipe is fantastic if just followed as written. If using frozen or canned corn, I'll probably add a little smoked paprika when making this again.

Have made many times, I sometimes added 4 pieces of cooked, drained, crumbled bacon.  Either way, my family and I love it!  Will make this a keeper!

Easy to make and taste was perfect. It wasn't hot. Jalepenos just gave it flavor. Definite do over.

Made this for an unconventional Thanksgiving dinner this year and it was a hit! Everyone at it and there wasn't a bite left. Simple, quick, and delicious!
