I love guacamole but never thought to use green onions or seasoned salt. I usually use red onion myself, when I have it.

Loved it! I doubled the recipe and added 1 jalapeno and about a half a cup of sour cream. Also, we like onion so instead of the green onion, I just diced a medium yellow onion. I'd love to try it with a sweet onion though.

After trying 3 recipes(2 from here,another from another place) for guacamole this week, we finally found a 5 star!  I say this 3rd time was the charm.  Love it.  Stuck to the recipe except for one slight thing, out of green onions so I used a scallion I had.  Made it again, but this time I used green onions and Adobe with pepper for the seasoned salt.  Still a great dip!

I'm a guacamole minimalist.  Just avocado and lime juice.  This is really good, though.  Just leave out the salt and add a bit of Mrs. Dash, if you must.

I'm not a fan of cilantro so I substituted fresh parsley.  It came out great! A fresh tomato diced small is also a nice addition.

I was hesitant as to how this would turn out because it didn't have tomatoes in it but my husband SPECIFICALLY requested I make it without tomatoes .  It was REALLY really good!!! I used a red onion as that was all I had on hand.  I will definitely make again.

I doubled the avocados and green onions to four, using same amount of other ingredients and loved it, even my first-time-to-try-guac adult son thought it was great.  A bit peppery but I like pepper.

I've never made guacamole before but I mixed up a double batch, following the directions exactly (except that I left out the cilantro because my family doesn't care for the flavor). Everybody loved it!

I didn't have everything, so I improvised (onion powder and no cilantro). Everyone loved it including people that claim to hate guac.

I have never added pepper to my guacamole.. but boy was it good! Between that and the seasoned salt I was amazed at the different in flavor than my normal go to guacamole. Might add some red onions next time for crunch if I want it to be a touch different.

This is our family favorite guacamole recipe because the ingredients are in such good proportion that it always tastes delicious.  On occasion, I sometimes substitute finely chopped sweet onion if I donâ€™t have the green onions.

Way too salty! I put in less than half a teaspoon of Lawrey's seasoned salt and it was almost too salty. Served with tortilla chips so even more salt there. Caution needed!

I liked this, and it was good with my quesadilla. However, it's not my favorite. I just sprinkled in some black pepper and seasoning salt, as I thought it called for too much of each. I thought the seasoning salt was a bit odd and prefer using kosher salt or skipping the fresh garlic and using garlic salt. I like trying new guac recipes though, so thank you!

I felt that 1 teaspoon  of season salt was to much I think the next time I will use 1/2 teaspoon of season salt. I like the dip and will make it again just less salt.

This was very good and easy to make, but too much seasoned salt to make it a 5-star for us.  I only used 3/4 tsp. and next time I would only use 1/2 tsp.  I added more lime juice to help counter the salt.  I had the recipe made in less than 10 minutes - you gotta like that.  Good flavor, I will make it again, just with less salt.  It was served with 'Lettuce leaf Tacos', 'Refried Beans Without the Refry' from AR and fresh fruit.
