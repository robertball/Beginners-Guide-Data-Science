I used one packet of Starbucks VIA coffee, Truvia instead of sugar and homemade sugar free chocolate syrup. I threw everything in a pint Ball jar and shook until all the ingredients were combined and the coffee was dissolved. This is good but for me, I think I'd omit the cocoa powder next time.

I'm really trying to like this recipe because it has everything in it that I love...coffee AND chocolate. The submitter told us to play with the ingredients to make them to our preference, so I did. I made it per the recipe the first time, subbing in Splenda and skim milk, and found it too weak in flavor and watery. The skim milk could have been the reason for the thin, watery taste. The next time I used a mixture of fat free half and half and skim milk, added instant espresso powder, doubled the cocoa powder, and used only 4 ice cubes. It was stronger in flavor but still watered down tasting...but better. For my taste, I believe the ice cubes dilute the milk too much, so a full fat milk is definitely needed. I'll keep playing with this recipe, though, because I think it has potential.

Yummy, especially on a hot day. I used 2 tsp of instant coffee, 5 ice cubes, Hershey's special dark cocoa powder and drizzles the chocolate syrup in with the other ingredients to be blended in. Very tasty, thanks for the recipe:)

I liked this. I did follow the recipe exactly. My only complaint is that it is not real sweet. It kind of seems like the chocolate syrup, should have been added directly to the drink while it was blended. The second time, I did do that and I liked it better. The texture, which is both slightly creamy and icy, is very good on a warm day. TY

This was very good, but my blender is terrible so the last couple servings had big chunks of ice in them...  I multiplied the recipe by four for my family drank it up!  Delish!

Too bitter for my taste. Next time I would cut the cocoa powder in half and add the chocolate syrup to the blender.

This was so good! I made it to the "T" but with cashew milk, cocoa powder and Nesquik chocolate powder mix. Literally 3 minutes to prepare and sip yourself silly!

I substituted sugar free French vanilla creamer for the milk, sugar, and vanilla extract. I also substituted decaf. Instant granules. I also omitted the whip cream. Everything else was done according to the recipe. When done I had a decaf sugar free mocha frappe that was delicious

I was so impressed with how this turned out! I used Starbucks via lightly sweetened instant coffee mix and I skipped on the chocolate syrup in the cup. It was delicious, definitely making again!

It was okay. . If you want something sweet, this is definitely it. If you need to substitute for the instant coffee, use one cup of fresh brewed.

This was pretty good.  I had a little bit of chocolate ice cream left in the freezer, so I added that to the mix as well.  Like another reviewer said, it was a bit watery, but the ice cream fixed that right up.
