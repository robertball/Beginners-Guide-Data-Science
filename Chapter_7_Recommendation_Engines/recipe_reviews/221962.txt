This recipe was delicious!! The tenderloin was cooked to perfection. The sauce was pretty good but the tenderloin would have been delicious without the sauce as well.

I've made this twice.  The first time I followed it to a tee, except I screwed up and added a bit to much salt.  The second time, I made a couple of changes/additions, and it turned out to be one of the best things I've ever tasted.  I used red wine instead of the vinegar, used a little less tarragon, and I stirred in 2-3oz of goat cheese right at the end.  The goat cheese totally changed the taste of the sauce from really good, to amazing!  When doesn't goat cheese make things better?  Thanks for a great recipe!

A superb recipe, and my family would give it 10 stars if we could. As I didn't have some of the items I improvised :) I used a Topside Beef Roast, I couldn't find Taragon Vinegar, so used Red Wine instead. Also didn't have fresh Taragon so used approx. 3/4 tablespoon of dried Taragon. Everyone LOVED it. It was so tender and the sauce is excellent. This is a definite keeper. Thank you so much for sharing it with us.

This roast is so delicious. I followed the recipe to a T (as I always do with Chef John's recipes) and it was so simple to make. The sauce was divine and my family likes a lot of sauce so I doubled the sauce and it was PERFECT. Now I am just hoping Chef John can post another recipe where I can get rid of the rest of these porcini's :)

Wow!  This was amazing!!  Absolutely as good as you would get in a 5-star restaurant.  I followed the directions exactly.  Had to go to a couple of grocery stores to find veal stock and tarragon vinegar, but I think using all the recommended ingredients was key.  This was our Christmas dinner this year and everyone raved.  Can't thank you enough!

I am considered a very good cook, but when I made this beautiful roast it surpassed anything else I've made.  My company was raving days later that they had never had beef as delicious or tender and this was.  I also didn't have tarragon vinegar so used white whine vinegar and couldn't find dried porchini mushrooms so used a combo of 3 kinds of mushrooms.  I will find the correct ingredients next time.  I had just sharpened all my knives and felt like a professional butcher following instructions for trimming and tying the roast.  Took the roast out at 128 degrees, let it sit for 40 minutes tented....true perfection.  Thank you so much Chef John!

Chef John’s method of cooking this cut of meat is awesome, and it really was fool proof. But I gotta say, the flavors of the porcini mushrooms and the tarragon vinegar and tarragon really overpowered this dish.  Next time I’m going to substitute just regular mushrooms, add more chicken stock (instead of mushroom water), and use white wine in place of the tarragon vinegar. At the end I will add a little bit of parsley as opposed to fresh tarragon. All that aside - the meat was perfect. My tenderloin was 2.8 pounds. I seared it for 5-6 minutes per side and had it in the oven for exactly 45 mins. My thermometer read 130 - the meat was perfectly rare but not purple.

the roast was tender, but when I combined the cream with the vinegar and broth, it appeared the cream curdled, what did I do wrong??

I made this for our Christmas Eve meal.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I made more sauce than the recipe called for.  My son-in-law started to calculate how much we could sell this meal for!  It was awesome.  I substituted regular mushrooms for the porcini mushrooms.  I also added Gravy Master to darken the sauce.  This was without a doubt one of the best meals I have ever made.  I used Chef John's mashed potato recipe, and served it with baked Brussel sprouts.  Thank you Chef John, you continue to amaze me and my family with your excellent recipes!

Interesting recipe actually.....a bit time consuming to prepare....I used balsamic vinegar instead of the tarragon vinegar because I could not find any in the grocery store.  Sauce was excellent....the meat is a beautiful cut of meat but so expensive....we will try it with a different cut of meat and see how it turns out.  Tenderloin is definitely great for special celebrations though.  Quite good and it deserves 5 stars in my book.

Recipe is easy to follow and since tenderloin can be expensive this is a great recipe to use.  I have prepared this several times for Christmas and Thanksgiving dinners and it is cooked to perfection!  Everyone raved on the tenderloin and the sauce.

This recipe was amazing!  I tried to adhere to Chef John's recipe with a few exceptions because of availability.  First, since I cooked a lot of bacon that morning I reserved the filtered grease from the bacon to sear the tenderloin.  Next, since I couldn't easily get tarragon vinegar I used regular white wine vinegar.  Also, no veal stock available so chicken stock it was.  One hitch for me was that the shallots did not deglaze my pan as the video suggests so I added the vinegar just before the shallots were done.  I served this with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and Chef John's asparagus, ham and lemon.  Even the kids gobbled this up!

This was amazing! Definitely will make it again. I personally added a little too much salt, but the tenderloin and sauce were so good.

I followed the directions EXACTLY. Wow, what a wonderful roast. I've never made any roast before and was so happy with how it turned out the very first time. This was our holiday main course, I'll be making this again for special occasions!

This was wonderful. My family loved it. I watched the video first, which was very helpful.  The tenderloin was just like the video and the sauce was full of great flavor. By having the ingredients measured and ready, everything went together easily. Except for the fresh tarragon, some of the sauce ingredients could be substituted with "like" items, without losing the basic flavoring. Will include this in my favorite recipes. Will make again and again.

I had a 5.4 lb  standing rib roast so I doubled everything.   I also added 3oz of goat cheese at the very end to the sauce......omg......absolutely phenomenal!  Here r my changes only because I didn’t have the stuff......definitely use a meat thermometer.....we like medium rare so I pulled it at 125 and let it rest for 15 minutes under foil.    Used white balsamic vinegar instead of tarragon vinegar, I used chic stock instead of veal stock.  Note.....I had a angus beef ribeye boneless roast, not a roast beef tenderloin.   Only difference is to leave it tied up until plating.  Don’t cut string before plating.

WOW! WOW WOW WOW!!

I made this dish instead of the traditional Thanksgiving turkey and my whole family loved it. The meat came out a perfect rare/med rare. The sauce..... ohhhhhh so silky, rich, and delicious. The porcini mushrooms give it the most delicate earthy flavor and I have always believed in the magic of shallots. I used chicken stock since veal wasn't available and it was still fantastic. This recipe is a keeper!

I am a below average cook and I made this for Christmas and it was WONDERFUL!!!  So helpful to have the video to watch. I had the roast trimmed and tied at the store where I bought it which was really helpful. Can't believe I made something so delicious, it really was not difficult at all.

I made a few substitutions: a ribeye roast instead of a tenderloin, 10 oz of fresh chopped baby bella mushrooms instead of porchini and beef stock instead of veal stock.  This came out perfect!  I followed the cooking instructions and invested in a digital probe thermometer since I didn't want to ruin the roast.  Will double the sauce next time since everyone loved it.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner last night and it was absolutely amazing.  It might take a bit of hunting to find tarragon vinegar but if you can get it by all means do so.  It adds a piquancy that blends perfectly with the shallots.  The only thing I couldn't find was veal stock, so I used chicken stock instead.  Chef John did the same thing in the video, which I encourage you to watch, too.  Make sure you don't overcook the roast.  The recipe calls for roasting in the oven for 45 minutes, but I took mine out of the oven after 35 minutes and let it rest for 15 minutes; it was perfect.  This is another brilliant recipe from Chef John and it's easy to do, too.  Definitely a special occasion dish due to the expense of the tenderloin roast but well worth the splurge.  I cannot wait to make this again.  Thank you Chef John - this was fantastic.

This is a fabulous recipe.  I've made it twice now, the first time I didn't have the tarragon or tarragon vinegar so I substituted red wine and herbs de Provence, which is one of my favorite herb blends and it was so good.  The second time I decided to follow the recipe exactly and it was even better.  The beef is so tender and it absorbs the flavor all the way through the meat.  I was curious as to the cost so I made my grocery trip specifically to pick up the ingredients, which came to around $65 total.  I will do this again, probably for a special occasion meal.

This recipe is unbelievably good.  I've cooked it twice now and everyone raves about it. I used a white balsamic vinegar the first time and it was amazing.  The second time I used a mix of red whine vinegar and cider vinegar and it was a bit too strong of a flavor.

This dish, simply put, is the most delicious thing I've ever eaten. I didn't have tarragon vinegar and substituted with balsamic, with fresh tarragon sautéed in before the roast went into the oven, and then added more tarragon in the stage that renders the sauce after the roast came out of the oven. I made some mascarpone mashed potatoes and the sauce with this roast was a perfect combination with the sweet, creaminess of the potatoes.

While I did not follow this to the letter, the video on how to dress the beef was invaluable. So delicious!

I made this for Christmas dinner last year and it was incredible! The meat was fork tender and the sauce added a very good flavor to the dish. I roasted Russian finger Potatoes under the broiler with some EVOO and added them in after everything was done, just like the main photo. I followed the recipe to a T except the veal stock which I could not find so I used beef stock.

An excellent recipe!  The beef was perfect. I had to substitute for a few ingredients I could not find like tarragon vinegar, fresh tarragon, and veal stock but I don't think it affected the taste. Highly recommend this for a special occasion

followed the recipe without making any changes. Turned out fantastic, tender, juicy, perfect medium rare with a delicious savory sauce. We impressed the pants off our friends.  Making it again tonight for a holiday dinner. Highly recommend!

Very Good.  Made it for New Year's Eve.  The technique to slow roast the meat worked beautifully.  The result was tender, juicy and flavorful.  I think the sear on the meat could be accomplished at a lower temp in less time per side than the recipe recommends.  I got more of a char on the bottom of the pan than a fond.  Between the char and the tarragon, the sauce had a lot of bitter notes.  Still tasted good, but not out of this world.  May have been my fault for overcooking on the sear.  It was a great meal, but the sauce did not live up to the meat on this single cook.  At the expense of this meal, it is hard to recommend the experiment, but it was a tasty plate of food.

This was incredible! Used bone broth (because my local butcher makes and bottles it and recommended it) , and I used Madeira wine because I had it. Everything else was done to the letter and let me say, this was definitely restaurant quality. Roast was 3 pounds and was roasted in a convection oven for 45 minutes and tented for 10. Turned out perfectly medium rare. My guests are still raving about it 2 weeks later!!! 

I highly recommend this recipe.

Honestly cannot say enough about this recipe. Fantastic flavor and the meat was perfectly seasoned with  the correct degree of "doneness". I did substitute rosemary for tarragon as I did not have access to it either fresh or dried. May just try it with tarragon next time.

I've made tenderloins for years, on the grill and in the oven. This one is a favorite b/c of the excellent ability to control the core temperature! I used fresh mushrooms and chicken stock, but love the tarragon! I also used a little corn starch to thicken the pan juices just a scosh!

I didn't have veal stock nor did I have the tarragon vinegar.  Substituting with beef stock and red wine it still turned out to be a fabulous meal. My husband was leery about cooking it this way but it was perfectly done.  For me it took long than 45 minutes - so using a thermometer was important.  I'll do it this way again and again!

My family agreed that this was the best meal I ever made, and it was really very easy.  I couldn't find tarragon vinegar, veal stock or the right kind of mushrooms, so I used red wine vinegar, beef stock and portabella mushrooms. I would like to try it the way the chef made it, but I really can't imagine it being better!

I  made it for New Year's Eve for some friends. They raved about it! So tender! Best gravy ever!
I used spiced rice vinegar instead of tarragon vinegar and substituted dried shallots for fresh, and sour cream instead of heavy cream. The flavor was out of this world!

VERY easy recipe to follow and the mushroom sauce was excellent.  The only thing we did not use was the tarragon vinegar because we couldn't find it at the store.  We followed another review and just used the white wine vinegar.  Love all of Chef John's recipes!

I used this cooking method for a small top round roast that I got for one of our holiday meals. I combined two of Chef John's recipes, using salt, pepper, and Herb de Provence to season the meat. Since I hate tarragon, I used sherry vinegar. I chopped an onion and used button mushrooms. I thickened the gravy with a cornstarch slurry once the roast came out of the oven. The cooking method worked very well, producing the best-roasted beef I've ever cooked. Just make sure to cut against the grain of the muscle in order to serve tender meat.

Ladies and Gentleman, 
This was the first time I was ever cooking beef, and I made this recipe for Christmas for 10.... triumphantly!   Essentially I doubled the recipe and followed the modifications in the video (chicken stock and white wine).

The beef was absolutely delicious, and I received raves.

However - I was faced with some timing and juggling issues - we have one oven, and my husband was doing potatoes that needed 375degrees.   I don't have a skillet that can also go into the oven.  So, I put my big roasting pan on the stove and it worked just fine for the searing and starting the sauce.   And it went into the oven at 375 for about 25-30 minutes.  When I checked it for temp, it read 130-140, which was on target for this recipe, but higher than my butcher suggested for medium rare.  

In the end, it was cooked about medium, but that's how I like it - I'm not a fan of too bloody - and the meat was soooooo tender and cut like butter.  (...which was great because I didn't have steak knives).

I wonder if the expense and search-time for the dried porcini mushrooms was worth it.  I imagine I will use this method again, but perhaps with some less expensive investment with the porcini mushrooms....

This recipe is amazing! I just made it for Christmas dinner today, and my whole family loved it!  I am not the most experienced cook in the world, but for the most part, I followed the recipe, and everyone at the table raved about the tenderloin throughout dinner. It was spectacular, even cooked slightly longer than suggested since no one in my family likes rare or medium-rare meat. It was still so tender and flavorful. I did substitute the veal stock for chicken stock. Others who reviewed wondered why you wouldn't use beef stock, but  I stuck with the chicken and it worked out VERY well. I was able to find the tarragon vinegar, and I was glad that I did. I do not agree that it was overpowering as one person said. I doubled the recipe for the gravy...I would suggest this...it's so delicious. I did not, however, use a 1/2 cup of the mushroom soaking water for the gravy, but I added another 1/2 cup of the chicken stock. I didn't have anything to really strain it with and I thought it might make the mushrooms just a little too pronounced. Other than that, I'm pretty sure I went by the recipe. My cream did curdle a little. I thought that it might since someone else mentioned it and because the sauce is acidic with the vinegar. It forgot to read up about this before I started, but after some reading tonight it seems that maybe my heat was too high. I would try to lower the pan temperature at the end next time to see what would happen. Nonetheless, I would HIGHLY recommend trying t

The best filet mignon. If there were 10 stars, I would give this recipe 10 stars. You really want to follow this recipe carefully. The internal thermometer is a must.

This roast turned out beautiful and was so easy!  Make sure you take off that silver skin.  It makes all the difference in the world.    

Like a few others, I used chicken broth, regular mushrooms and champagne in lieu of the vinegar.  I keep small bottles of champagne, white and red wine for unexpected guests or for cooking - whichever happens first.

Thickened the sauce a little with cornstarch and doubled it.  Perfect!

Love Chef John's recipes.

I am not sure what happened but my cream curdled twice :( what went wrong? I was having a bad kitchen day! I ended up not making  the sauce because I was not trying a third time and cooked the beef as instructed. I should have tied my beef more but it was perfectly cooked.

Couldn’t find the tarragon vinegar at my local store and used red wine vinegar instead. Was very pleased with this recipe. Delicious.

Take care not to overdo the vinegar. A dry white wine may actually work better than the vinegar and I'll try that next time. It's definitely important to reduce the liquids by half, otherwise, it becomes a "mushroom soup" of thin broth. I did 3 whole tenderloins at once, though it's probably better not to  or triple just because there's just so much liquid. It then becomes logistically complex, time wise, to reduce, and get it all in the oven. It worked out with persistence, and eventually, 16 guests enjoyed very delicious, tender roast beef tenderloin and lovely beef-porcini sauce with which to anoint their garlic mashed potatoes, to raving appreciation.

This was absolutely delicious - thank you Chef John! I made this recipe for my husband last Sunday and it was a huge hit. I doubled the sauce recipe based on suggestion from other reviewers but ended up with far too much sauce. However, I bought another tenderloin roast for dinner tonight so I can use up the extra sauce, really looking forward to roast tenderloin again tonight!

My husband and I made this for Christmas. We live very rural with not too much choice of good grocery stores. Thank goodness for Amazon, we were able to get everything we couldn’t get locally. Tenderloin, we were able to get from Costco. My husband watched the video and learned to trim the roast. This was one of the best things we have ever tasted. The sauce was spectacular. We made no changes to recipe at all.
We also served bernaise on the side. Try this, doubt if you will regret it!!

I did not have tarragon vinegar so I put fresh tarragon into dry sherry and let it sit while I prepared everything. It turned out great! I only wish there was more of the sauce...it was outstanding! Thank you for recipe...it is a keeper!

Perfect as written..    used an Angus tenderloin. Sauce was a great hit. Some skill required to prepare meat ...Mostly really sharp knife.. Watch video!... Fresh Tarragon essential.

Had guests last evening and I made this recipe.  It was a little time consuming but I think it was because it was my first time making it and I followed the video to a "T".  It wasn't' difficult at all and next time I will have a better idea of how it flows.  The meat came out perfect and tasted delicious.  I used a top round and doubled the recipe...with 4 boys in the house we love leftovers.  Also I wasn't able to get percini mushrooms so I used shitake.  Nevertheless, it was delish and I would definitely recommend it. (It think the secret's in the vinegar. Lol.)

My husband is still raving about this incredible Roast Beef Tenderloin recipe!  Perfection...and I might add...I even messed up with the directions here and there and it was still amazing.  I think this is probably the best recipe I've ever made from "allrecipes".  I've always been a big fan of Chef John's recipes, but this was a Ten Star recipe (five stars just isn't enough)!

Easy, somewhat forgiving (I was forced by one of my guests to over cook to medium well and it was still delicious). Agree, this is more in the five to ten star range.  Why?  Because it hits all the keys. It will turn a poor piece of meat into a decent meal and with a great piece of meat you have a restaurant quality meal.  Add to that the ease and flexibility of the prep (I didn't have veal stock, no problem - still great).  Would recommend and make again.

Excellent!! I substituted balsamic for tarragon and green onions for shallots. no milk or cream and so I thickened the sauce with flour as a roux. It was delish!

Some of the ingredients in this recipe can be hard to track down (tarragon vinegar), but it is well worth it. As everyone else has said, this is amazingly tender. 
I did find that my roast was past medium rare in 30 minutes (as opposed to the 45 suggested in the instructions), and I do have an oven thermometer, so just keep in mind the size and shape of your tenderloin, as this will influence the cooking time as well.  It was still wonderful, so as long as you take into account your specific cut of meat, this is a fantastic recipe.

This is BETTER than restaurant quality!!   I bought the tenderloin already tied up at the butcher counter.  I could not find dried porcinis, so used dried shitakes instead.  I also used half tarragon vinegar and half red wine.  I doubled the quantity of the sauce, which I was happy I had done, but we did have extra sauce in the end.  Otherwise, followed all directions as written.  It was beyond delicious!  Made this for our Christmas dinner, and everyone agreed it was the best roast they could ever remember having.  It will be our new Christmas dinner tradition!!  Thank you Chef John!!

Wow! This was amazing! The best beef tenderloin! The meet cooked to perfection. 
Absolutely as good as you would get in a 5-star restaurant. I had a dinner party of 12 and I double the ingredients. I followed the directions exactly and I got 10 stars comments! Excellent!

It was absolutely as advertised...just wonderful. Of course, I changed things to suit the ingredients that I had, but everyone raved and the (few) leftovers were delicious too.  We don't eat red meat often, but when we have beef tenderloin again, this is what I'll do. Thanks, Chef John!

I little bit of work but well worth it.  I made this for Christmas Eve.  My family liked it so much, we had it again for New Years Eve.

This is a great dish.  I followed the directions as much as possible.  Unfortunately the directions are poorly written.  Even though the dinner turned out well, I'm not sure that it turned out the way John really intended it to be.

I changed this quite a bit for personal taste and what I had on hand, but it's a great recipe and I'm sure it would be great as written.  I left out the mushrooms because I'm not crazy about them.  I used 1/2 an onion and 2 cloves garlic instead of shallots.  No tarragon vinegar, so I sub'd a mixture of Balsamic vinegar and red wine.  And I used Beef stock instead of the veal.  It came out great!  Done perfectly.  We'll definitely make this again.

Fantastic.  Even though I had to substitute a few things because I didn't have them (balsamic vinegar, beef stock), this was one of the best roasts I have made.  Highly recommend trying!

This is the first review I have ever posted.  Made this last night for a party of six, using a three pound tenderloin.  Followed the recipe exactly, though I did double the sauce recipe.  As with all the other Chef John recipes I have tried, this was incredible.  Everyone raved throughout the entire meal.  Thank you, Chef John, and also appreciate your videos!

Delicious!! I would have used a little less salt in the sauce. Best to do a taste test when seasoning. Otherwise fabulous recipe. Everybody loved it.

I made this beef tenderloin last night.  All I can say is "Oh my goodness!!".  Everyone at the table talked about the meal all night long.  This has such fabulous flavor.  The only sub I had to make was using chicken stock versus veal stock as I couldn't find veal stock.  All steps followed as written (step 3 should state to remove the beef to make the sauce, then add it back in step 6) and all other ingredients used (no subs).  You will not go wrong making this. It is excellent!  Bon appetit!

Ohhweee! This was a keeper! We made this for Christmas this year and what a dinner it was!  My wife and I both agreed it was about the best tasting tenderloin roast we've done. We didn't mess with the recipe, simply did what it said. It was extremely easy to make and the flavor was exceptional. As a side we had a scalloped potato dish and asparagus made with toasted almonds. 

I pulled it at 120 degrees and after the rest in came out as a perfect medium rare. The sauce was killer on this and I wouldn't change a thing. The funny thing is, this meal was even better the next day! I am tempted next time to make it a day ahead and then serve it. The flavors really infused into the meat and the sauce was even better.

Do yourself a favor and just make it as intended. No need to get creative substituting this and that. You'll love it.

My family just told me this was the best roast beef they've ever had! Even with numerous improvisations (I didn't have porcinis or tarragon on hand) it was so moist and the sauce SO flavorful and delish! Thank you so much for a wonderful Sunday night special!

I made this with a couple of substitutions as I could not find the right mushrooms (used brown) or the veal stock (used chicken), and I also used balsamic vinegar.  It still turned out really well.  Next time I will find all the ingredients in advance, but this recipe is definitely a winner.

This is mouthwatering good, tender, juicy, and earthy!  I did make alterations due to some items not being available and writing down a wrong ingredient.  Had to substitute beef stock in place of veal stock, Red wine vinegar in place of tarragon vinegar, 4lb tenderloin, and white onion with 1 tsp garlic powder for the shallots only due to the fact that I wrote down chives instead of shallots for some reason!  I also grilled this with hardwood charcoal at 350F for 50 minutes rather than roasting in the oven, then checked with an instant read thermometer (130/140 in two different places), will make this again using the exact recipe.

AMAZING!  I love, love, love this recipe.  It turned out perfect. I was nervous about cooking the roast in the oven thinking it wouldn't be moist but boy was it ever.  It was so moist you didn't even need a knife to cut it.  The only change I made was using red wine vinegar instead of tarragon vinegar simply because I couldn't find any. This is a definite must try because anyone you follows the directions will not be disappointed.

Could really be a '5' because the mushroom drippings are excellent, but the meat while good was not outstanding.

I love the perfect timing and the video for a first timer.  I elected to make a horseradish sauce so I wouldn't still be in the kitchen until the very end!
