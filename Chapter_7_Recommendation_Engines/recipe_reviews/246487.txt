7-30-2016  ~Great flavor, pretty on the plate, this plays a great supporting role to any grilled or roasted meat or fish.  I love the addition of both the carrots and the peas, which added color and interest.  The turmeric, too, contributed beautiful color and flavor beyond the simple, basic rice dish.  Neither the pine nuts nor the sunflower seeds spoke to me so I omitted them.  Omitted the cayenne pepper too.  I preferred not to cook the peas with the rice, which in my opinion would have overcooked them.  I simply stirred them in at the last, just before serving.  We both enjoyed this with Key West Chicken, also from this site and some fresh sautéed Swiss chard from my garden.  In a word, Hubs called this “interesting.”

Great! Easy and fast. I used extra turmeric and cayenne, and had no peas so I subbed in bell pepper. Yummy!

I made this last night.  It’s very pretty -presentation is great.  It just didn’t have enough flavor for me to be making it again.  Good but not great

I was really looking forward to this. I didnt care for it much and neither did my husband. My daughter loved it but not enough to put this on the rotation list. Somehow, it was bland and just okay
