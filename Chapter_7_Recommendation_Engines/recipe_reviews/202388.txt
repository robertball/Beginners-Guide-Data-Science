great recipe! I made this recipe without the onion (bf doesn't like onions), but everything else as written and it turned out great with good flavor. it's hard to find good Chinese food out here in Colorado, so I was glad to find this recipe so I can at least make some good Chinese at home. thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe for a Chinese Lunar New Year party and they disappeared in minutes. Everyone loved them! I didn't have fresh ginger or garlic on hand, so I used powdered. I also substituted dry sherry for Chinese rice wine, but they tasted just like the ones you get in a restaurant. I'm definitely making these again!
