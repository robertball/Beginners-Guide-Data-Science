I was looking for something different and low fat as a "dip" for veggies as light snack and came across this. I cut way back on the servings and just "eyeballed" the ingredients leaving out the MSG.  Overall this was quite tasty with cut up celery, carrots, and red pepper.

I used "Trim" cottage cheese, one packet of Truvia instead of using sugar and I omitted the MSG. I did not use this as a dip, I "piled" a few tablespoons each on two white cheddar rice cakes. I liked the caraway seeds, chives and celery salt combination. I'd make this again but omit the sweetener next time and add in fresh ground pepper. NOTE: If you throw the ingredients into a food processor or blender, you CAN make a dip out of it. Just puree until smooth.

LUMPS of cottage cheese in a dip for veggies?  Didn't work!  Then tried blending it to make it a smoother dip, but the taste still didn't complement the vegetables.  Also, the spices were completely overwhelmed by the caraway seeds; not a "delicate flavor" at all!

If anyone ever went to the Alpine Village Inn in Las Vegas years ago before they closed, this is the dip they served before the meal.  No, it's not your normal sour cream/mayo based dip, but it is delicious!

The Alpine Village Inn was a favorite restaurant to locals in Las Vegas. It closed now.This spread was served as an appetizer with crackers and assorted breads. I remember gingerbread being in the collection. The spread is light and tasty. I have been looking for the recipe for years and am happy to have finally found it. If you don't like the lumps you could always whir it up in a food processor. I don't mind the lumps. It would be good on a baked potato in place of sour cream.

Yes, cottage cheese is lumpy. So if "lumps of cottage cheese in a dip for veggies" is such a turn off to you because it was "lumpy and it didn't work" then why would you even prepare this dish? It was served at the Alpine Village Inn in Las Vegas for many years and was a very popular appetizer.

I have the original container in which this spice mix was sold.  The  ingredients, listed in order, are as follows.  MSG,  sugar, caraway seeds, minced green onion, salt, black pepper, celery salt, oregano .  You may want to experiment with the quantities based on the recipe on this site.  MSG should be the greatest quantity and Oregano the least.

The cottage cheese texture is fine, but the taste is a little lack-luster.  It tastes good, but not great.

I left out the MSG, of course (yuck) and was still disappointed with the taste. I think it was the mix of sugar and caraway seeds. Just not good for my purposes.
