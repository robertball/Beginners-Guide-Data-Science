This recipe was really great! I don't have a bread maker so I will tell you the bake version. Let yeast, 1/2 cup warm water & sugar in bowl for 10 minutes. Combine the other ingredience including the 3/4 cup water. You will need this extra water. knead. Place in a clean bowl for about 2 hours or until it doubles in size. Punch down the dough and knead lightly. Place in an oiled bread pan and let rise for 1 to 2 hours. Lightly coat top in Olive Oil. Bake for 40 minutes. Yum!

This has been the BEST bread I have made so far with my bread machine.  The only thing different I found was that I needed to add a bit more water. The recipe calls for 3/4 cup of water, but that didn't seem to be enough. I added about 1/4 cup more water and the dough then started looking better.  Thank you for submitting this recipe and sharing it with us!

This is a good recipe, but indeed it needs extra water (approx. 1 cup).  I also ended up using a wheat blend flour for 2 of the cups (it's what I had on hand) and it worked just as well.

This recipe is wonderfully moist and toasts great. Add some garlic and basil for a flavorful twist.

I just made this for the first time today, and I will have to agree with some of the other reviewers..there is not enough water. It was good I looked at the bread machine after I started it and before I went out for the day, otherwise there would not have been bread at all!  Once I got the extra water in (probably to total 1 to 1 1/4 cup), the dough formed fine and it made a light and fluffy bread. Good flavor. I may tweek this recipe a bit. I prefer more potato flavor, and a sweeter dough. Otherwise though, this turned out well.

I used double the potato flakes instead of dry milk and added an extra egg yolk for more moisture and density ...first time EVER using my NEW 12 year old bread machine....worked great

I am making this bread for the first time.  Watching the bread machine, it seemed like it didn't mix well.  So I added water.  Then it was sticking to the side of the pan.  So I started adding more flour.  I've wondered if I should've melted the butter, but it didn't say so.  Maybe I should've added more potato rather than flour.  We'll see how it turns out.  There are other potato recipes out there.

This is a horrible recipe. It did not turn out at all and I am an experienced bread maker. The ingredients did not mix thoroughly (I have an excellent bread machine). It seems there is not enough liquid. I removed dough from the machine and tried to hand knead it but it still turned out horrible. Total waste of ingredients and time.

pretty good over all, but I like a little more patato taste.
