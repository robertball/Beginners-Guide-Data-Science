I sautéed the zucchini first so it wouldn't be watery. For added flavor I used box rice with a cheddar flavor and I skipped the egg and only added a half cup of milk to make it more thick like a casserole. I thought it was great the way it turned out with my added tweeks. I read the other ratings that's why I tried it this way.

Great recipe! skipped the margarine & used olive oil to saute added chopped onions, portobello mushrooms, & chopped red & yellow peppers to give it some color.  Added salt & pepper and it turned out great!

This recipe was good enough, but I would jazz it up a bit if i make it again. We are trying to reduce our meat intake and this recipe came up with my search for rice and zuchinni. I like some of the suggestions. Thanks.

Really good. Took longer to bake, about 45 minutes. It would be good with onions and peppers.

Not bad-- actually it turned out better than I thought it would. Changes: sauteed the chopped zucchini (and yellow squash) in a bit of butter with salt+pepper and drained; added a bit of spring onion that needed using; used Zatarain's yellow rice; used sharp cheddar; added red pepper flakes; baked for 45 min and let rest for 20 min or so.
I think I'll try again with a different type of cheese.

This was good! I do think it could use some more seasonings...salt, pepper and garlic powder maybe. Also, I had to bake mine longer than stated, about 1 hour. This did make a nice side and is a great use of zucchini. I would make this again, with added seasonings. Thanks for sharing. :)

I didn't read the reviews before I made it so didn't add anything.  It needed to remain in the oven an additional 30 minutes to set.  Next time I'd add some onions and seasoning. Once it was cooked through, it was pretty good.

As written, 3 stars.  The pluses of this dish: it's a creative way to use that bumper crop of zucchini, and sneak a good veggie into food the kids will eat.  The challenge: zucchini is a very watery vegetable, and the flavor in this recipe is bland (which probably makes it more kid-friendly, but...)  Based on reviews, I chose Cream of Mushroom Soup with Roasted Garlic; added 1 teaspoon of garlic; and used Extra Sharp Cheddar Cheese.  I think this elevated the flavor from 'bland' to 'mild'.  I would do this again, and probably throw some chicken into the mix , also.  To make this again though, I need to find a way to control the moisture......  I cooked the dish for 50 mins. + 5 mins. cooling time, in order to get it to "set"..... and this was still 'barely'.  Next time I will try with only 1/2 cup of milk.

Utterly delicious!  The boys loved it and I doubled the recipe. NOTE: if doubling the recipe, double time and a half the cook time and raise to= 1.5 hrs cook time.  400° F

I really didnt much care for this. It came up under the search for leftover rice and zucchini. I havent cooked with canned soup in forever, but this just looked to easy and used up what I had. I followed the ingredients and steps, only subbing butter with olive oil for regular butter. It was what I had and a small amount anyhow. It just didnt have any flavor, or seasonings, and the zucchini added so much water. I would suggest sauteeing the zucchini first. I thought to do that, but was pinched for time so I followed the recipe as is. I let it rest like 2 hours to absorb the liquid and that greatly helped. Still a little too salty and oily for my pallate.

This was a hit at Thanksgiving today!  I would have given it 5 stars except, like a previous poster wrote, I think it needs additional spices to bring out the flavor.  I added garlic powder, garlic salt, and black pepper.  It was a mild flavor but a good one!
