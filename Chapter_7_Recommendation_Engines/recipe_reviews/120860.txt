NOTICE! To those of you wanting a REAL brioche recipe, this is *not* it. This is a good egg bread recipe but does not have the rich, buttery quality of brioche. Real brioche has more butter and the butter is kneaded into the dough.

This recipe came out perfectly the first time I attempted it.  I have a bit of a sweet tooth, so I dusted the top with a bit of cinnamon and sugar prior to baking.  Delicious!

This the best recipe for making sticky Buns, Sweet Rolls and cinnamon topped Kuechen. I have been making these  almost every week for over 50 years. For the last 7 years, I have used my Breadman for mixing. I do add 1/2-1 cup extra flour though. May be due to the egg size. After the machine mixes for about 5 minutes, I check for texture and add the extra flour. After the dough cycle of 90 minutes, I form the rolls or kuechen. I don't refrigerate over night. Absolutely the best. I use butter, never margarine.

This is a great recipe and I was suprised and pleased to see how simple it was to make a good brioche right at home. I recommend that when pushing an indention into the center of the main bun, make sure that the indention is pretty deep and that the smaller bun nestles well into it. I didn't do that the first time and while the brioche rose beautifully, the little buns on the tops all sloped to the side, making lopsided brioche.

I omitted the lemon peel and let the bread machine do the hard work.  I made loaves instead of buns and after a couple of days, I made french toast with brioche slices.  So good!

What a delightful change from the normal "eggs and meat" breakfast!  I've never really tried brioche, so I'm not sure what it is suppose to taste like, but I am ECSTATIC at how these turned out!  Rich, moist, a little sweet and dense.  
I actually messed up the recipe from the start, by combining all of the flour and dry ingredients, rather then portioning out the flour.  So after I mixed all the dry ingredients I spooned out what was needed according to the recipe.  I added closer to 2 tsp of lemon peel, as that's what I had grated.  The morning of baking I split the dough in half.  With 1 half I cut it into 8 pieces, rolled them into balls and them put them into a bread pan.  With the other half I cut it into 6 pieces and rolled them into balls and placed them in a round cake pan.  I baked both at the same time and they turned out SO YUMMY!  
Be careful to not overbake them though, 20 mins. was just a little too long for the ones in the cake pan, but just right for the loaf pan.  
Try it plain before putting anything on them, as they are very flavorful on their own!  My girls liked it best topped with cream cheese and raspberry jam, the boys liked it with gouda cheese and smoked turkey.  I liked it all, even with just a little butter and a hot cup of coffee!

Thank you for this recipe! It truly made me feel like a baking genius! I've made this a few times already and every time they come out great. I was nervous making them the first time since I wasn't sure if I wasn't experienced enough but I followed the directions to a T and they were a success. The second time I made them I made the mistake of not checking the freshness of my yeast and could not get the dough to rise much more for the second rise, but my mother gave me a good tip to place the dough, covered with a moist towel, on the stove top with the oven preheating so that the heat could give the yeast a little bit of a boost. It still didn't double but they came out delicious nonetheless. Absolutely love these toasted with strawberry marmalade the next morning with my tea!!!! THank you again, makes me wish I baked for a living.

I may have done something wrong, although I tried to follow the recipe exactly as written, but the bread came out very dense. I am used to a lighter brioche. I'll continue to look for a recipe that produces a lighter, fluffier texture. I have lots of experience making rolls and breads and have usually been successful - although I have had a few failures. This may have been one of them!?

This turned out really dry for me.  I would like to try it again and see if the cook-time is a bit off.

Wonderful brioche!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  I haven't tried to make this type of bread in years and this recipe turned out perfectly light and eggy.  Very simple, even tho there are several steps.  Just the right amount of sweetness.  I thank you and my husband, who grabs one of these every time he goes into the kitchen, thanks you!

Really hard for me to do a review... I made a coconut swirl loaf, and somehow, there was an air pocket in it, so the air expanded while I baked it, and the whole loaf deflated when I took it out to cool. (it took forever to bake too!). I don't know if this is a good recipe or not... the texture of the bread seems okay. The rising time took forever..! and the end product was bad but that was my fault. Maybe I will try again.

I would use less zest and push the balls into the indents more firmly.   

Delicious though!
