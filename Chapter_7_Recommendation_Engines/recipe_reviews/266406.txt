8.26.18  Made the sauce in the morning before heading out to do yard work, and just reheated for dinner, making this an extremely easy meal in the evening.  I did add some red pepper flakes and a little red wine to the sauce and had to use a can of basil, oregano, and garlic canned tomatoes (what was on hand, need to buy canned tomatoes), otherwise, followed the recipe.  This is the first time that I’ve ever bought frozen cooked chicken, and it actually was pretty tasty.  Honestly, although not difficult, I doubt that I’ll make the sauce again, as I’m not convinced it was worth the effort.  You can buy a jar of good-quality marinara sauce that measures up pretty well, doing nothing more than seasoning to suit your taste, and at the end of a busy day, it would be a much simpler way to enjoy this tasty, crispy chicken.  It was a nice dinner, enjoyed with a simple salad and hot baguette.

This was a nice balance of convenience and homemade. Great for a busy weeknight! The only one thing I would change next time would be to blend the diced tomatoes. Great recipe and one I will make again!

This was very tasty.  It is easy to make.  I could get used to making this on a regular basis.  Great job Tyson for coming up with a great quick chicken parm recipe.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  The sauce was so tasty until I added the salt.  Next time I make this I will reduce the amount of salt.  Otherwise it's a great recipe.

My family loves Chicken Parmesan. This recipe was very easy to make and didn't take long to make. I would definitely make it again.

We really enjoyed this recipe!  Because I only make Chicken Parm from scratch, I was skeptical of using frozen, prepared chicken .  To my surprise, the chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  Delicious!  I do have  a confession though, I had a a container of homemade sauce already in my freezer, so I used that instead of the sauce this recipe called for.  Afterall, the the chicken was really the focus of this recipe and it really was, not only convenient and much less of the hassle of breading it myself  and all that,  the chicken itself was definitely the star of this dish.
Since I will be making this again, I will make it using the sauce it comes with, using less salt as another reviewè suggested.

I rarely use precooked meat but this turned out very well.  The sauce was fresh tasting and because I didn't need 8 servings, I used half the sauce for an accompanying eggplant parmesan.  The chicken was a little spicier than I would have wanted for a chicken parmesan, but everyone enjoyed it.  I love the crispy exterior and plan to try it out in another recipe.

Delicious! Using the pre-cooked chicken tenders was a really tasty shortcut.

Huge hit! I was leary of using these to make chicken Parmesan because we always make the chicken from scratch. This turned out wonderful! Very easy and so tender, moist and flavorful...delicious! What a great time saver for busy weeknights with back to school approaching! This got a thumbs up from everyone in the house, which makes this recipe a keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Really nice balance of convenience (breaded chicken)  and homemade (sauce). Quick and easy dinner option perfect for busy nights. Made the recipe as written except didn't have fresh roma tomatoes on hand, so added another  can of chopped tomatoes to substitute. I liked the crunch the breaded chicken gave to the dish.  Giving this 4 stars because it's quick, easy and delicious, but nothing spectacular. Will likely make again.
