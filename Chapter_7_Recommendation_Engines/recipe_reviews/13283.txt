I agree that the bouquet garini spice ball reference was vague.  So I googled it and there is a website called Sara's Secrets that gives great ideas for what spices to use.

This was a tasty and filling. I changed it by using the beef cubes for stew instead of dealing with the bones. That one change saved me a lot of time.

I REALLY like this soup.  It's a perfect meal for a busy, chilly day.  I made some alterations, not because I thought it needed it, just because I didn't have everything on hand.  Instead of making a bouquet garni, I just added 1t of thyme and 2 bay leaves along with the parsley.  I didn't have any barley on hand, so I simply added 1/2 c. of quinoa.  SUPER good.  Next time I won't add as much salt.  Thank you for sharing this easy recipe!  Even my kids lapped it up! : )

Could be a good slow-cooker version, but I think the soup bones need the traditional browning and slow-roasting to really extract all the flavor and make this a great recipe.

Next time, I will just use beef broth from a can and put the barley in it.  This recipe, I think, was unnecessarily time consuming.  Tasty, though.

One of the best soups that I have made.  I omitted the garlic, but it was still good with the other seasonings.  Also, I added more beef to mine.

Though this recipe doesn't take much in the way of preparation, it does not make for a quick fix.  The slow cooker method took way too long.  It ended up taking me two days with my busy schedule to make this recipe.  Then after the long wait, I didn't find it all that appetizing.  I do not reccomend this recipe.

This recipe works well when wild game is used and likely will produce a lower fat more flavorful product.

I made this with 1/3 the salt . Time to get creative with spices and herbs to replace the salt!! Try using lemon/pepper shake to replace some of the salt...or minced tarragon.

We really enjoyed this hearty soup, and I will be making it often in the winter.  Wonderful with thick-sliced homemade bread.

Only change was the bacon. I used a pack of the Oscar Mayer Bacon Pieces instead of frying my own bacon and making the mess. It also makes a nice freezer meal. Potatoes and carrots freeze well raw. I have made this 5-6 times in the last couple of years. Stick to your ribs, great, great stew!

Very Tasty!! I didn't have barley so I substituted 2 cups of brown rice and put it in, in the beginning. Also added a little bit of meat seasoning that I use on steaks and such. Kids also are enjoying it!!
