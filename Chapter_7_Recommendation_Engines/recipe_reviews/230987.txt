I used the measurements just as stated but used an orange because that was all I had. I also diced some of the oranges and added them. It was great and oh so easy! Thanks

I used just 1 tsp of both the mayonnaise and the sour cream for 1 apple and it was more than enough dressing.  Some tangerine segments tossed in would be nice too.

Super easy! Added orange segments as suggested by other reviewers. It was a big hit with my family.

This was very good and worked well for a quick fruit salad.  I didn't have tangerines so I used juice from a can of mandarin oranges.  The sauce was pretty runny, so like another reviewer said, it might not be necessary to add the 2nd addition of fruit juice.  The citric acid in the mandarin oranges worked well by keeping the apples from browning.  I ended up throwing some mandarin oranges in too.  By the way, my picky kids and husband asked what the sauce was.  I told them it was "a kind of sweet cream sauce".
