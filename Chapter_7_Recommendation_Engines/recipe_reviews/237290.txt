In addition, I put  some cumin. Served it  with "moros y cristianos" (rice cooked with black beans), fried ripe platain slices and avocado. I felt like in Havana!

This was really good. I didn't change a thing. I think this makes a great summer dish. There was quite a bit of juice in the crock pot. So I pulled servings out with a pair of tongs, and served this with lime cilantro rice and black beans. I garnished this with a avacado and lime. it was a bright satisfying dish.

Used peanut oil (high heat tolerance) to brown the roast.  Added one blackened/peeled diced poblano to the other 3 peppers (red/orange/green) which gave it just a hint of smokey spice.  This was fabulous - and provided leftovers for lunch the next day, which tasted even better.

I never give reviews but I had to on this one. By far the best slow cooker recipe I've tried from this website. It was PERFECT. I paired it with rice and beans. I loved it! I was born and raised in Miami Florida so I know a good ropa vieja when I taste it and this was delicious??. I couldn't find avocado oil so I had to use olive oil but still extremely flavorful.

This was excellent!  The sirloin tip roasts have almost no fat and the dish was a big hit with my family. Even my young granddaughters liked it.   I made this for our Mother's Day meal today as I had recently made a trip to Cuba and tried this in a restaurant.  I doubled the recipe for 11 people and then added another small 3 lb. roast.  We did have some leftovers.  Excellent!!

when I make this, I use a jar (8 oz) of our homecanned salsa, some hot aji limon peppers, and frozen peppers and onions that we grow ourselves. A little 1/2 teaspoon of cumin is nice in this too.

I made it pretty much following the recipe, though I used a rump roast and some old wine instead of vinegar. This is pretty tasty.  If I make it again, I'll up the spices (cumin, mainly), as my preference is for more rather than less.

I made this for my wife and I during a weeknight as we both work. I had a 2 lb chuck roast  in the freezer so I used it in stead of flank steak. When I arrived home from work I removed the beef and shredded it, then added some whole olives. 

My wife  walked in and said the house smells great. Served the  Ropa Vieja on heated tortillas with sour cream, salsa and guacamole.

Let's just say I scored brownie points.

My family loved this and it really is an all day dish, which is great for a work day. They had their's in tortillas as burritos, I just ate it in a bowl like a stew and it was very satisfying.

I like it! It was very easy to make and it tastes good! I would make it again for sure. Would probably add some more seasoning like white pepper, paprika and a little cayenne.

Turned out great and the whole family liked it! We had it with texmati rice and corn. Leftovers will be drained and used to make baked enchiladas with refried beans.

I used poblano peppers, very good. Don’t see a reason to drain the tomatoes since the juice would create more sauce.

Personally, I’ll leave out the tomato paste next time. The canned tomatoes were enough when cooked low and slow. Also: I’ll add more heat, likely via a hot giardinera.  But it was great! The meat was so flavorful!

I have a 3-qt crockpot and this recipe was too big for it.  I ended up having to leave out half of the onions and one bell pepper and it was still too full -- the thicker tomato paste that got poured on top couldn't seep down to the meat, so I had to do some massaging halfway through when I realized what was going on.  Despite this sizing issue, this recipe was amazing.  The only modification I will do in the future is to halve the recipe to fit my pot (but don't halve the tomato paste)!

made it exactly like recipe called for.  I screwed up by not draining the tomatos before adding them so it was too acidic for my tastes.  However everyone I served it to loved it and I will definitely make it again.  No one but me noticed my goof

My finicky son asked for seconds!  I followed the recipe exactly but used London Broil because I couldn't find the sirloin it called for.  This recipe is very easy and filled the house with a warm, cozy feel all day.  This is a keeper.

Absolutely delicious!  I used a less expensive meat, rump roast, and it was perfect. Served with cilantro lime rice like others did, and they go perfectly together. Impressed my husband; hooray!

Made it as directed except added some onion powder, salt and pepper to the finished product. Served over white rice. Yum!

This was delicious!  I started the putting the recipe together when I realized I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used white wine instead.  Also, my roast was twice as big as this recipe calls for (4 lbs instead of 2) but it was just fine.  I kept everything else the same measurements.  At the end, I made a slurry of some of the liquid mixed with some corn starch to thicken up the sauce a little.  Served it with cilantro-lime rice on allrecipes.  Will make this again.  It made a lot and it was gobbled up!

Fantastic!  I wanted to review because as I had to go to work the next  day I followed recipe instructions to the letter,  but added all the ingredients to the crock pot the  night before - and it was still fantastic!  Husband/kids loved it, will definitely make again.   Wonderful flavor, served over rice for a simple, easy weekday dinner!

excellent.  The only change i did was grapeseed oil (high heat tolerance) instead of avocado oil.  we loved this and would make it again.
