I was very happy with this recipe.  I was looking for a well balanced, healthy meal that I could take to work for lunch that I didn't have to worry about heating up.  This fit the bill perfectly with lots of protein & veggies.  It reminded me of cold fried rice, but without all the oil and fat.  The only thing I substituted was brown rice for the white rice.  Thanks!

i really simplified this recipe b/c i was making it while camping.  It's so easy and versatile.  i omitted the chicken and egg, but added chopped carrots.  i used brown rice (cooked according to the package) and used a low-cal italian dressing instead of the oil/vinegar.  it was really tasty and i received many compliments.

The vegetables remarkably bring in the flavor with this dish. I doubled the dressing because it was very light otherwise. I also steamed the broccoli for one minute then blanched it in cold water (tastes better than raw broccoli). Refridgerating this for an hour blends the flavors. I added walnuts at the end. I will make this again. Thanks.

I made this with brown rice.  I'd never cooked brown rice before, and NOW I know it takes much longer than white.  I also just used a bag of frozen broccoli and chopped it up.    I made this yesterday and can't stop eating it!  Perfect for my husband to  bring to work.  I will try to freeze individual servings, then at lunch time it will still be cold, but defrosted.

I really like how the yolks from the hard boiled eggs break down in this to make  it a little bit creamy (not really creamy, but I'm using that for lack of the correct word).  I replaced the chicken with a can of chick peas to make it vegetarian and diced up a green pepper instead of using the corn because that  is what I had on hand.  We prefer these kinds of salads with lots of red wine vinegar, so I added quite a bit more than the recipe calls for.  I also added some diced up fresh parsley because I wanted to use it up.  Delicious!  Thank you for sharing!

Tried this recipe and found it to be great.  I originally made it as written.  I also tailored it for an everyday salad by leaving out the chicken.  Both ways this is a salad worth the effort of making.  I will be using this many times throughout the warmer months.

Love this recipe!  We have leftover rice quite a bit and this is a great way to use it and leftover veggies in the fridge for weekday lunches.  I fried my eggs and chopped them into the salad and accidentally used more vinegar (misread and added a TBSP instead of a tspâ€¦whoops!) and it was delicious.  I could see using water chestnuts in this, also, for crunch.  My co-workers were all jealous when I told them what it was and were surprised it wasn't takeout.  Will definitely make again.

I made this according to the directions, using Minute Rice, without the chicken. Took it to a family gathering and everyone loved it! This is now my new "go to" for summer gatherings or when we want a cold side dish to remind us of summer. Give it a try!

Love this salad.  Have made it a few times before, always changing a bit.  Sometimes brown rice, sometimes shrimp instead of chicken.  Great dish to bring to a BBQ!
