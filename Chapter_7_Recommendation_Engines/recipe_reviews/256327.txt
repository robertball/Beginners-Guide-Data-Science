This was excellent!  A little hard to keep it all together once everything is piled on but that is my only complaint. I used regular swiss cheese and that worked just fine. The recipe description mentions red onion but sweet onion is listed in its place down in the ingredients. Either will work but red makes it really pretty. Keeper!
