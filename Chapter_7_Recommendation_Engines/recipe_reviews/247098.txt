I have been making ceviche for many years and I have never heard of boiling the scallops. Ceviche is raw fish or shellfish  'cooked'  in lime juice. So I skipped that step and let the diced scallops marinate  in the lime mixture. This was tasty, but different,  with the addition of the chiles poblanos. I think I'll just stick to my regular ceviche recipe.
