This is really delicious!  I never would have thought to put bok choy in a salad, I just thought it was for stir fry.  I thought it would be bitter raw but it is not at all! I just kept eating it like it was a snack food.  Highly recommended for a change from the usual salad.

This was a great recipe. I substituted half rice vinegar for the cider vinegar (for a more asian flavor), and added a little sesame oil at the end to give it a nuttier taste. I also added about 3 Tablespoons of toasted sesame seeds for a little nutty interest.

The first time I made it, I used the 2 tsp of chile paste (which I love) and I was the only one in my house that could eat it. Too spicy for my husband and kids, but the second go round, I used about half a teaspoon of the chile paste, and while it was a little bland for me, those with more sensitive palates LOVED it.

Make sure you accomodate the taste buds of those you are cooking for, but with that in mind, we make this regularly.

This was a wonderful, light salad for a hot summer day.  It went well with barbecued Halibut.  The left-overs went to work with me and received rave revues.

I really liked the vinegarette this recipe made,  and it had a little zip.  I made a salad with ingredients from the farmers market,  and used this to dress it,  and it was wonderful.  I also used Nappa Cabbage and Bok choy combo and it was good.

I agree with the previous reviewer that this was WAY too vinegary and not hot at all.  Kudos for the idea of using bok choy in a salad.  But I'll need to work on this one before I'd serve it to anyone.

Simple and excellent flavor. I made a couple of substitutions, including using shredded spinach instead of bok choy and chili-garlic sauce instead of chili paste and minced garlic. (It was what I had on hand.) My dinner guests enjoyed it very much and agreed that spinach might even be better than bok choy (my husband, though, wasn't a huge fan... he has very tender taste buds and I might reduce the heat for his portion next time). I served it with Indonesian Chicken Satay, another recipe I found here, and got excellent reviews all around. Thanks for a delicious and unusual salad creation!

This recipe was barely edible - way too vinegary for our tastebuds.  Even after a day in the fridge, the vinegar only got stronger.

Instead of using Bok Choy I used a bag of Broccoli Slaw. It had more of a cole slaw texture plus the color was great. I loved the dressing and it went great with grilled salmon

Very tasty. I used napa cabbage instead of bok choy and rice wine vinegar instead of cider. I might have gone a little heavier on the spices too. I liked that this slaw didn't have mayo for a change of pace.

After reading the reviews I cut way back on the vinegar but that is the only change I made. This was a very nice change from your ordinary slaw. It was very colorful and pretty dish too. Thanks for the recipe!

This was really tasty!  I used pre packaged shredded cabbage instead of bok choy.  I thinly sliced red and yellow peppers and added the green onions.  I used 1 tbsp less of cider vinegar, and added two shakes of hot sauce.  I used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil.   Delish, hot and tangy!

I do not know how so many people liked this. It was way too vinegar-y.  I found it also to be barely edible...  what a waste of some delicious bok choy!

This got rave reviews from my husband (and from me).  He told me I should hide the leftovers so he couldn't find it!  I used about 3 heads of baby bok choy, and 1/2 c white vinegar because I didn't have cider vinegar.  I used ground ginger because I didn't have any fresh, and I used the Vietnamese Sriracha sauce.  I also made it pretty late - about 15 mins before dinner, so I kept tossing it while the rest of the dinner was cooking.  It was great!

I did not have good luck shredding the bok choy, so I just chopped it. The chili paste and ginger root make this dish. A very welcome change from cabbage slaw! I served with bulkogi (Korean beef) and rice for a nice oriental meal!

Made with red cabbage & adjusted the oil, vinegar and mustard to be more like salad dressing- 1/3 c oil, 1/4 c tarragon vinegar,  2T Dijon, omitted hot sauce, 2.5T brown sugar and added some sesame seeds. Great base to use with with ever you've got on hand-- could add tomatoes, cilantro, cukes, broccoli,etc. saved in my salad folder for future reference. Yummy!

What a great slaw to serve with an asian salmon.  I used 2 heads of bok choy, but kept everything else the same.

This slaw definitely lives up to its name, although it's more sour than hot. It was a little too much for my taste--I love cider vinegar and dijon mustard, but unfortunately it seems I'm just not too crazy about them together. I did like the dressing when I tasted it before pouring it on the slaw, so it might just be better in small doses, rather than as an entire salad entree. My boyfriend liked it, though.
