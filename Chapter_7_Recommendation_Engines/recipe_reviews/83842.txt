This recipe was just "okay."  A good way to use up my overabundance of cucumbers, though.  Next time I think I'll add some crushed pineapple.

Took the advice of the one reviewer of this recipe. I added the pineapple and it was very good. Also it does't need the extra sugar. I diffently will make again. Will freeze extra zuchhini and make in the winter months.

I made 1/2 recipe, with no changes.  It was a hit all around!  I was concerned about the dill pickle, and used 2 "Clausen" spears;  but it was GREAT and everyoneI loved it.  Wish I could give it more than 5 stars!!!

I have made this salad for many years.  It's one of my favorites.  However, I don't shred the cuke, but chop it.  I also add sliced green onion to it.

I made this for mother's day; it was lovely I used a butterfly shaped cake pan, as our get together was in wooded setting. It is very good and has set me on a search of other molded vegetable salads.
