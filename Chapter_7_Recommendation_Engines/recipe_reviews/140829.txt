Delicious and a keeper in my recipe box!
I had no Marsala so used red wine with a shot of whiskey and a chicken bouillon cube instead. I also cut down on the mushrooms because I didn't have enough - didn't hurt the taste a bit. I didn't want to stir the sauce while the pork chops are still in the skillet so removed the chops into a baking dish, cooked the mushrooms, garlic and wine for 5 minutes in the skillet, poured the sauce over the pork chops and baked in the oven at 350° for 10 minutes.

Not necessary to measure precisely, as I'm sure the submitter would agree.  Excellent combination of ingredients resulting in an excellent dish.  Rather than stirring in extra Marsala as suggested by the submitter, however, when the sauce became too thick, I thinned it out with chicken broth. Indescribably delicious.  Serve with a simple, lightly seasoned pasta.

My husband said they were the best chops he'd ever eaten and to give it 5 stars.  I didn't have any mushrooms but since the chops are THE THING it worked out well.  BTW - I brined the chops in 1/4 cup table salt to 1 qt of water for 30 minutes.  It makes them juicy and not dried out when cooked.  Just rinse them off after 30 minutes, blot with a paper towel and proceed with the recipe.  It will NOT make them salty.  Brining works with chicken too.  I also added some heavy cream the last 5 minutes of cooking time.  Excellent recipe.

I'm a simple man on a quest for good food that's easy to make.  I won't sacrifice taste to appease my laziness, but easy is important.  Once we reach the double digits on ingredients, I get nervous.  When I set out to make this, I thought it would be a challenge...especially with that ever present fear of ending up with dry pork.  My fears were unwarranted.  This was insanely easy.  I used thin sliced, center cut pork loin chops so I didn't have to pound it thin.  I even mixed the flour and spices in a ziplock baggie, and threw the meat in so I didn't dirty another bowl.  Threw in a pre-sliced package of baby bella mushrooms so I had almost no work at all.  For those contemplating taking the meat out while the sauce thickens out of fear of overcooking, fear not.  The wine in a covered pot apparently takes care of that.  Last fear was that the marsala would be a strong flavor.  Nope.  It blended beautifully.  Easy?  Absurdly so.  Taste?  Delicious.  That earns it a solid home on the regular rotation at our house.

This recipe is super easy and tasted great. I subsituted cabernet for the marsala so I didn't have to buy a whole bottle of wine and it tasted almost the same. My husband said it was resturant quality. I served it with red smashed potatos with feta chesse and sweet carrots. Prefect meal.

Made this for dinner this evening and I have to say it was fantastic.  The pork was truly the tenderest I have eaten, cut with the fork tender.  I did remove the meat & let the sauce simmer by itself to let it thicken a bit.  I served it with "smashed" red potatoes  which were made with chives & sour cream.  I paired it with a cabernet sauvignon which offset the sweetness in the Marsala sauce.  This is on my list of favs.

I made this recipe the other night and even my picky grandchildren loved it!  I used fresh garlic only.  I seasoned the pork with salt and fresh grounded pepper before I fried it.  That was the only change I made to the recipe.  YUM YUM!  Will make again and again!

Very good!!  I made this last night using thick, bone-in chops.  Obviously, since they were bone-in, I skipped the pounding.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, but did cut back quite a bit on the flour, butter and olive oil.  I did change the process by first sautéing my mushrooms and removing them from the pan.  Then I seared the chops and removed them also.  I sautéed my garlic until just fragrant and deglazed my pan with the marsala wine.  Added back the mushrooms and chops, covered and simmered for maybe 10 minutes.  We enjoyed this and would make it again!

I thought the change from chicken to pork was great idea.  I can't say I know exactly what the original recipe tastes like, as I made some changes.  I added a 1/2 cup heavy cream and reduced the the marsala to 1/2 cup as well.  I also saute'd the mushrooms (crimini) with butter/olive oil and garlic prior to making to the sauce.  At the end I added a ts of lemon juice and 2 more T of marsala wine.  It tasted great!

My family loved this recipe. I have made chicken marsala many times before but I never thought about doing it with pork. I followed the recipe closely. The only changes I made were that for the sake of time and mess I didn't pound the pork. I breaded it with a mix of whole wheat flour and regular flour. I cooked it at a low temp for a longer time so it would cook through. And at the end before putting the lid on it, I added fresh parsley and a little Parmesan cheese. It was great...thanks!!!!

Delicious! I used pork tenderloin as it was what I had on hand. I cooked the pork, added the garlic, a lot of mushrooms and stirred briefly. When the sauce thickened, I added a little chicken broth to loosen it up to my liking. A lovely dish this is! The pork is tender, juicy and seasoned just right. The sauce is flavorful and savory. I love the taste of the marsala in the sauce.  The mushrooms are a nice addition and gave this sauce an earthy flavor as well as texture. I served the pork marsala right over angel hair pasta (lightly seasoned). I further complemented this dish with, "Green Beans with Smokey Bacon Vinaigrette," also from this site.

made this tonight and followed direction as well as ingred. to a "T" and it was delicious. I made garlic mashed potatoes to go with it and steamed broccoli. I can't rave enough about it. Good thing I pounded the chops. They were so tender. Had to add a little water to the sauce, it was too thick but other than that it was delicious. I thought the garlic was a nice touch.

My husband and I really enjoyed this entree as a weeknight meal.  I used the ingredients as listed, except for cutting the butter and olive oil about in 1/2.   Bought Marsala from the liquor store for about $5 instead of buying more salty Marsala cooking wine from the grocery store.   Cooked in a nonstick electric skillet at 325 degrees. The result was a moist and flavorful chop.   Yum!

I made this for my picky husband last week and he loved it! He requested it for dinner again tonight. Because of our busy schedules I just threw everything but the flour in the crock pot for about 5 hours, then added the flour just before serving and it turned out wonderfully!

Excellent! The pork is fork tender and the sauce is so good! Followed the recipe with the exception of using a little seasoned salt in place of the garlic salt (I am out) and used 3/4 cup Marsala and 1/4 cup chicken stock in place of 1 cup Marsala due to shortage of wine on hand. I won't hesitate to make it exactly like this the next time. For our taste, this amount of wine was perfect. Quick, easy recipe with outstanding results. Thanks for sharing!

We didn't like this at all. The flavor of the Marsala was overpowering. Net time, i might add 1/2 cup of the wine to 1 cup of gravy.

I have to say this was a surprise - I thought the recipe sounded good but it was better than good - it was excellent!  My hubby gave it 5 stars - I'd have given it more if possible.  I followed the recipe pretty closely.  I used boneless pork loin slices which started out about 3/4 inch thick and pounded them to about 3/8".  After pounding I sprinkled each with some seasoned salt before dredging in the flour/spice mixture - I didn't add salt to the flour mixture because of the seasoned salt.  Then proceeded as the recipe states.  I added some extra mushrooms because we love them.  I served this with steamed basmati rice and steamed, buttered broccoli.  I'll keep this one for easy quick meals and will also use it for company.  Thanks for a great reciepe!

This was good, not great and needed much more seasoning.  I thought the pork/sauce was bland.  In fact, I thought the sauce needed a little more umf to take away the sweetness of the marsala wine.  Thanks for sharing.

This is the best recipe I have tried on AR.  I followed the recipe except I added a little more garlic (we love garlic at my house).  I had friends over and they loved it and asked for the recipe.  A definite keeper.

My husband and teenage son loved it! I used some Merlot I had on hand instead of marsala and a small can of sliced portabella mushrooms instead of fresh. It took a little longer than I thought but was worth it!!

You use what you have in the cupboard if you can. But I use fresh ingredients if possible, and season the sauce with some sort of broth or stock or bouillon. Also, I find the meat is much tastier if I first marinate it for 30 - 60 minutes in wine, garlic, salt, Worcestershire, black pepper, and basil.

Easy to make and flavor delicious.  I pulled the pork out first in order to cook up the mushrooms and garlic.  Then moved to the side to add the pork to bottom. Moved mushrooms on top, added the marsala wine, covered and cooked for the 15 minutes suggested.  Perfect taste.  Thank you for this recipe.  Will make many more times in future.

Quite tasty.  Men in family thought is was terrific. Fast, easy to prepare recipe. I sliced pork tenderloin into 1/4 inch medallions, and did a quick pound with the knife blade. Came out fork tender. Served with mashed potatoes and fried squash. A good combo. The flavor lacked something for me, but I cannot put my finger on it. My brother says this is a keeper, so I will try again.

This was a "Hail Mary" dish.  My family gave it 6 thumbs-up!  I did add 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream to the marsala sauce.  Added some chopped green onion and red onion.  Followed one review which suggested not cooking the chop in the sauce, although I may do that in the future....just wanted to makes sure everyone liked the taste of the sauce.  Thank you Junnieann.  Great Recipe!

One word - DELICIOUS!  Made this for dinner last night and my DH and I ate all six thin chops.  I do not usually fry food but I really wanted to try this recipe.  It is very easy to make and your meal will be on the table in a matter of minutes. The only change I made was to not use any salt but followed the recipe to a "T" the rest of the way.  Would definitely make this again.  Thanks Junnieann for the marvelous recipe.

there is a lot of garlic in here/I was a little afraid but I did make it as instructed (mostly). In the end there is not too much garlic in it. The one change I did make was I used white wine plus 2 TB sherry (for a bit more body) since that is what I had on hand/drank the last of the red wine last night! I think with the mushrooms and "white" meat/pork using the white and sherry worked just fine. I only had 2 thick cut pork chops on hand so I cut them into thirds and pounded the "downsized" chops out thin. Like the other posters, I browned my chops separate from the mushrooms and added the chops back in at the end.

This was good, and relatively simple to make. Only real change I made was that I browned the pork, then removed it from the pan. Once the mushrooms were cooked and the sauce was reduced, I added the pork back in.

Loved this recipe. Like most comments pork was so tender you don't even need a knife!! A perfect easy recipe as is, but I did add a little splash of heavy cream at the end just because we love cream. Definitely a keeper!

Outstanding Recipe.... The only thing I will do different is having the center cut chops custom cut 1/4 inch thick so they get super thin when pounded out.

This is a great entree for a romantic candlelight dinner!

This did not work out well for me.  I was pretty disappointed.  The sauce needs something else like stock because the wine overpowered the dish.  My pork turned out tough but that is my fault. I've made chicken marsala many times before and I was excited to try it with pork.  Unfortunately, it didn't work out.

I have been looking forward to trying this recipe, but wound up a bit underwhelmed.  I make Chicken Marsala and really like it, but the recipe I have for that includes the addition of some dry Sherry and heavy cream to the sauce.  Really makes a difference.  This wasn't bad, just wasn't AS good.  The only change I made to this recipe was because it calls for salt, garlic salt, quite a bit of garlic powder AND then also minced garlic.  Yikes!  So I cut that down a bit.  I'm going to give it another go eventually, but adjust it to my preferences.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Delicous!!  I had to cook in two batches of pork because my frying pan wasn't big enough  I think it is impotant to use a metal pan for the browning part.  Teflon just doesn't work well for browning. Great recipe!!

Absolutely FABULOUS! Choose mushrooms wisely...use crimini mushrooms or good gosh if you can get them morels would take this to another planet!  Don't use marsala cooking wine.  It's way too salty among other things.  Use the drinking stuff.  This might help you from ending up like Sue1.

Delicious!  My family loved this!  I used a pork loin, sliced thin and then tenderized/pounded thin. I served it with oven roasted asparagus and parmesan/basil orzo. The flavor was amazing, and the pork was fork-tender. Definitely a "Do Again"!

Yeah so FYI if you make this exactly how it's worded the pork will come out over cooked and dry.  After you sear the pork take it out and tent with foil then turn the heat up to high and boil the sh#$ out of that sauce for like 7 minutes.  Then put the pork back in and lower heat to simmer for 5 minutes.  Flavor is good.

This was easy and delicious.  I had a similar recipe but I like this better.  Next time I will skip pounding the chops and buy thin pork loin chops with the bone.

Full of flavor and so easy! I usually do not make anything new when I am having company over but I had a bunch of pork chops that needed to be used up and this recipe looked fast and easy. It was great! None left and everyone asked for the recipe. Will certainly put on my favorites list!

Followed the recipe exactly with the exception that I didn't have enough Marsala so I used Burgandy wine. It was easy, fast for a work night meal and my family enjoyed. I served it with rice and fresh french bread. The only reason I gave four stars is because I think it could use alittle more seasoning. It was subtle and I like more bold flavor. But it will definitely be added to my rotation.

I was looking for something different to do with the pork roast I had today and saw this recipe. I gave it 4 stars for originality, but thought it was a bit heavy on Marsala flavor so I went 2 for one beef broth to wine. Much more subdued flavor but got rave reviews. Instead of chops I cut the roast on a bias to make 1/2 thick "steaks" Really tender, also used portobello mushrooms. Thanks for the idea, turned a ho hum pork dinner into a meal we'll have often.

This was really good. I didn't have garlic salt, so I used extra garlic powder. I added some chicken bouillon powder. I also added a pretty generous amount of pepper.  The sauce wasn't thick enough once the pork chops were done, so I took the pork chops out and let it cook out a little bit so that the sauce would thicken, then poured the sauce and mushrooms on top.  I will definitely make this again!

AWESOME!   I did follow the other hints in regards to sauteeing the mushrooms & garlic first, then pushing them aside adding the meat. I could see it needed more sauce. I had some leftover gravy from a pork roast and added it to the pan after the meat was nearly done, but before I added the marsala.  MARVELOUS FLAVOUR!  Thanks for sharing

I really liked this recipe, the kids weren't so hyped about it. Basically anything with wine in it my clan shy's away from. Next time I'm gonna try it with white wine to see if they like it better.

This was SOOOOOO good and easy. I didn't use all the butter though, I just let the sauce reduce a little longer and added a touch of cornstarch to thicken before serving. Can't wait to make again!

New family favorite, definitely going into the repetoire.  almost embarrassingly easy (so you can wow your guests / friends without killing yourself) and easily modifiable by using chicken instead of pork.  Used marsala cooking wine; daughter and husband both had seconds -- recommend doubling if you have a family of 4 with big appetites.

This was very easy to make and tasted great. I had three (cooked) medium roasted potatoes in my fridge that I sliced and added along with the mushrooms.  Other than that and extra garlic, I did not change a thing. Now for the important thing. I had leftovers the next day and it was even better - the sauce seemed thicker. I might even make this a day a head in the future since the taste was much richer. This dish would probably be great in a slow cooker too.

EXCELLENT! I used sirloin chops th I did not pound, and they were perfect for this. I cooked up all the components, threw them into a baking dish and baked them @ 350 for about 30 minutes...perfectly moist and tender.Will def make this simple, yummy dish often! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is an easy and fast recipe. Did not make any changes. Cooked in my electric fry pan, so this helped with easy clean-up. My husband and son truly enjoyed the pork chops. To make life easy I served with baked potato and peas. Thank you for submitting this recipe. Will be making again.

Amazing.  I added two pinches of cumin.  Only other changes are less oil, you don't need 1/4 cup.  No garlic salt but 4 crushed garlic cloves.  Instead of marsala wine (not a huge fan) I used 1/2 cup red wine and 1/2 cup chicken broth.  And I added whipping (heavy) cream.  Perfect and amazing on egg noodles!!!  Will make again and again.

Excellent recipe. Not being a big fan of pork, it took me a while to try it. I made it exactly as it's written but with double the ingredients, using portabello for mushrooms. It was so good I immediately have requests for a repeat.

Oh my goodness.  This was SO good.  The only thing I did differently here was remove the pork chops after browning, and cooking the sauce on its own for a bit.  I returned the pork chops to the skillet and simmered it with the sauce.  Wow.  Served as other suggested with red potatoes, and some spinach on the side.  Will definitely make for company.

Tasty and Easy! I have added this recipe to my middle of the week menu.  I made 2 lbs of pork and substituted a sweet sparkly red wine but was still amazing.  I will add a bit more garlic next time and maybe corn starch to the sauce, was a bit thin. I really loved this recipe! I will make many more times to come.

Quick, easy, delicious.  I used about half marsala, and half cooking sherry, as that's what I had on hand.  Everyone enjoyed this.  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Turned out great, but sauce was thin.  My raw mushrooms wouldn't fit in the skillet with the meat, so I had to saute some of them separately. When I added them to the meat, I think the additional butter might have caused the sauce to become too oily/thin.  My whole family still loved it, and the pork was surprisingly tender as others have mentioned.  I will certainly cook again, but with a larger pan :)

This dish is wonderfully full of flavor. The pork turned out tender and juicy every time I have made it. There is only one small change I have made and that it to add a few cloves of sliced garlic along with the onions.

Very good!  served with mashed red potatoes and oven baked asparagus! yumm. The Marsala flavor was way to strong for us, so I opened a can of low sodium beef stock(chicken would do) added the left over flour from pork chops to made a very nice mushroom gravy. I also added fresh finely chopped parsley to this gravy. yummm!!

Really good!  The pork turned out really flavorful and tender.  I made only very minor changes...since I didn't have fresh mushrooms, I used canned mushrooms instead.  Also, I didn't have any marsala wine, so I replaced that with the same quantity of Sherry.  I also brined the pork chops as another reviewer had suggested (1/4 cup salt in 1 quart water for 30 minutes).  After, browning the pork chops, I removed them from the pan before adding the mushrooms.  Once mushrooms were soft, I put the pork chops back in and added the sherry.  Delicious!!  Thanks for the recipe.

Easy, delicious and the chops were fork tender.  I needed to add salt (at the table) to cut the sweetness of the Marsala but my husband loved it just as it was.

The best Marsala I ever made. I used what I had, pork chops on the bone and portabella mushrooms. Definitely restaurant quality

Made this as directed and it was very good.Seemed as though something was missing. Maybe another herb in the mix. Would also try the pork in medallions. Still very good flavors and simple to make.

The flavor was real good but the sauce did not thicken up like I expected.   The pork was real moist & the more mushrooms the better because of the way they cook down.

I thought that this recipe was very good and my family agreed.  I made the recipe as is except that I added sliced onion and cooked the onion with the mushrooms and garlic.  Prior to cooking the onions, garlic and mushrooms, I removed the pork to another dish.  I made the pork earlier in the day and the cooked vegetables with the Marsala wine early as well and put them in the refrigerator separately until later.  I then combined the meat and Marsala mix in a covered Dutch oven and heated them in a 350 oven until warm.  Next time I will try this recipe with chicken.  Quick and good recipe.

Delicious. I look forward to making this as given but adapted to Instant Pot this time...and had to use 3/4 C red wine and 1/4 C brandy. All other ingredients and proportions were the same. Pounded, coated and sauteed pork; removed from IP; added mushrooms and garlic and stirred for five minutes; added remaining seasoned flour; added wine; placed meat in IP on top. Turned Saute off, Pressure cooked high for 8 minutes. Slow release for 10 minutes, fast release and serve.

I used chicken, tripled the garlic & salt,  doubled everything else. I tasted as I went along. I made plenty of sauce to serve over Pappardelle, an Italian egg pasta.
I used 6 chicken thighs. 
I will make it again with pork next time.

I really liked this recipe.  I did not pound the meat, but found it to be very tender.  I followed the recipe because this was the first time I made it.  Used all the portions stated in the recipe and it turned out great.

I think this dish was very tasty, but next time I would use about 1/2 of the masala wine. I don't drink alcohol, and I felt the alcohol taste was a bit strong for me.

Outstanding, only change would be to cut the Marsala with chicken broth, 50/50. Otherwise a bit sweet.
And 
I always make more gravy, great on the noodles.

I made it exactly as called for.  The flavor was good, the meat was tender, but there wasn’t enough sauce when it was done.  It needs some broth in the recipe.  I won’t make it again because I wanted sweet marsala gravy.

Awesome! I thought for sure I ruined it by over cooking the pork chops before adding the mushrooms and garlic but I was so wrong! I removed the chops so I had space to cook the mushrooms and garlic well, once the sauce started coming together I put the chops back in to simmer in the sauce. So much flavor! Not dry or overcooked at all! The sauce really makes the dish amazing!

This is so easy and delicious.  I've been making my pork (chops and loin medallions) like this for years.  The only difference is that I use Taragon instead of Oregano.  I also use Taragon in my Chicken Marsala.  If you don't have Marsala wine, try it with a dry white wine and instead of the oregano or taragon, use thyme.  Soooo, good.

Good dish and I would make again. Of course I made changes. I had to add corn starch to thicken a little. I also added cherry tomatoes cut in half for color and a little acid. My wife suggested string onions (good idea). I did not have the wine so I mixed dry wine with brandy: ration 1/4 cup wine to 1 teaspoon brandy.

Had to use a smaller skillet, but it turned out perfect. In my opinion, this is the best dish I've made since I've started cooking for my household a few months ago. Will be making this one again.

Agree with those who found the amount of Marsala too much.  Based on my experience making chicken Marsala, next time I think I'll use 3/4 c. chicken broth and 3/4 c. Marsala.  I also added a few grinds of black pepper.

Last review posted before I was ready. Oops! This is a family favorite! We’ve modified the prep just a bit for juicy, tender, melt in your mouth chops: soak the raw pork chops in water with a handful or two of rock salt for about 20 minutes before you bread them (I usually let them soak while I’m setting up for everything else). I also bread a bit differently for breading that sticks really well and doesn’t slide off when you grab it with the tongs: Dip in egg & milk first, then in the seasoned dry flour mix, then back in the egg, then in some seasoned bread crumbs. Works like a charm!

Easy and tasty recipe. I follow the ingredients accordingly and the only difference that I made is to cut Marsala wine in have and I mixed it with beef broth. I also added a little  gulp of light creamer.  It came out absolutely delicious

Fantastically easy to make and one that even pleased my picky 16 year old son. I served ours with some buttered cauliflower & sweet potato "rice" and steamed broccoli. Will make this one again.

Followed the recipe to the letter and it was a hit.  If I were to modify it in any manner, I would substitute pork with chicken breast.  Very nice.  Thanks!

Tried this just for something different to do with pork, plus I love veal marsala.  This was just as good.  My husband loved it and we have served it to guests.  It tastes like a lot more work than it is.  I served it over noodles.  We didn't find the marsala taste overwhelming, but I did cut down on the garlic just a little.

Good flavor and a tasty flavorful recipe.  I served it with some packaged Gnocchi pasta from our health food market, and they were very good together.  The only problem that I had, was that the sauce never thickened up like it was supposed to, but a little extra flour helped to thicken that up before serving.  It was still slightly runny, but the flavors were unaffected.

This was very good. I made the recipe with a pork loin and seasoned  and browned it and put it on another dish in the oven. I then sautéed cremini and shiitake mushrooms with a scallion in olive oil, added the pork back in the pan for a little. I added some of the Marsala wine, but thought it was too sweet.
Overall,  this recipe was very easy and good.

We love it. I gave this recipe to a friend and she loved it too.

This is an easy recipe.  My husband loves it,  and it is such a nice change from chicken marsala. I only add a little extra garlic.

This was AWESOME!! I made it exactly as it was written, and it turned out beautifully. Next time I would add more garlic and more mushrooms but this is a delicious dish. I came home from work, and threw this on the stove, steamed some broccoli and re-heated rice while this was simmering and had dinner on the table in about 30minutes or less. I can't believe how tender the pork chops were! I will be making this dish regularly!!!!

I have never cooked with Marsala wine before. (Recently single) This dish impressed the guest. I will add nothing but to this the next time I cook it. Mangia!

I had high hopes for this recipe, as I have done almost the exact same thing with chicken and loved it. After we began eating, I had to return the pork to the pan for 10-15 more minutes, as it was underdone. Perhaps I should have done better at checking on the donenes. Also, my attempt produced no sauce! I followed the directions exactly. It only took a fraction of the seasoned flour to thoroughly coat every piece (1 lb total). Instead of a sauce, I just had coated pork swimming in butter and oil- with the occasional tiny flour glob, even when I attempted to 'thicken' it with additional flour. The flavor was still good, so I'll probably try it again. Next time I will cook the pork much longer, remove it from the pan, then add flour to the butter/ oil/ wine until it makes a sauce, then return the pork to the pan, and cook it all a little longer.

Very good. I used thick pork chops and cut in half. The sauce was a little two thin so I added a little flour at the end to thicken. Next time I will add sooner. I only needed to cook for 10 minutes.

Maybe it was the brand of Marsala I used, but this was way too sweet as written.  I corrected the flavor with lemon juice and salt.  The texture of the pork was tender.  I was glad that I really browned the pork before adding the mushrooms as this helped to provide a depth of flavor.  Served with asparagus and cooked carrots.  My family declared it good enough to make again.

I love this, have made several times and even my kids like it.  Today I made it without the flour because I'm cutting out wheat.  It turned out great - I just added a little cornstarch at the end to thicken the sauce.

I don't drink or cook with wine, so I used beef broth.  With that said, take this review with a grain of salt.  We liked it, but didn't like it *that* much better than the mushroom chops I make with condensed 
cream of mushroom soup, and that ones much easier.

this was very good and a nice change from plain pork chops. I overcooked them too long (I'm notorious in my family for doing this) so they were a little tough. The sauce was very very good. I served over whole wheat rotini seasoned with garlic, butter and parmesan cheese. Next time I will cook them for less time to make this the ultimate dish.

So easy.  Looks beautiful and complicated when you serve it.  When my husband says a restaurant couldn't do a dish better I add it to the menu.  I didn't have pork so I used lean chicken thighs and half the butter and oil to make it lighter.  It's delicious.

This was to die for! My husband and I adore Marsala but He hates mushrooms. I omitted them with no substitutions and this was still glorious, it still thickened well, and made a delicious sauce for going over rice with that extra liquid leftover the mushrooms weren't there to absorb. I used seasoned fried chicken flour as I was out of all-purpose and it was not too overpowering on flavor, in fact it made it just a touch better with that hit of paprika.

This recipe is very tasty, though I also removed the pork while the muchrooms were cooking and put it back for the remaining 15 minutes.  Pork was tender; everything had a nice blending of flavors.  I made it with egg noodles.  Very nice meal.

Super tender and good! I bought thin cut chops and did not pound them out due to time. I only had Cabernet wine so I used 1/2 c. Cabernet and 1/2 c. Beef Broth. Everyone loved them!!!!

Made this the other night.  I thought it was great, especially since this was my first attempt at making a marsala dish. My friend did not care for it, so I am rating it 4 stars.  I took the advice of other reviewers and used half wine and half chicken broth, loaded up on the mushrooms and added a bit of sliced onion.  I would feel confident in serving this for company.

I just made this the other night and not only did my husband and I enjoy it (minus the mushrooms since we don't care for them), but the kids even ate it.  The pork chops I used were thin cut so we didn't need to pound them any, but they came out tender and flavorful.

I made this at home and came out really good.  I used chicken broth instead of the butter for a little bit of a healthier meal.

A few things: first, substituted chicken breasts, pounded thin as my pork chops weren't thawed in time. Delicious!  Like the other reviewer, I expected the sauce to be a bit creamier but it did thicken nicely towards the end of the simmer; I'll add a little heavy cream next time. All in all, a definite keeper.

It is just wonderful when something so delicious is so quick and easy.  I made this with pork tenderloin and marsala.  I followed the directions almost exactly.  I may have let is simmer a few extra minutes to thicken the sauce.  Great dinner, will definitely repeat.

This was pretty good.  I would suggest using a more tender cut of pork,  or maybe mine just wasn't very tender.  I prefer a cream marsala sauce.  But this was good and I will make again,  probably use chicken however.

This turned out WAY better than I expected. I used very thick pork chops (didn't bother to pound them) and ended up pan-frying them for about 40 minutes on low (turning every ten minutes or so). I was worried they were going to be tough but I couldn't have been more wrong. The meat was SO tender and succulent, and was perfectly complemented by the mushrooms and Marsala. Awesome recipe. Thanks, Junnieann!

My husband couldn't get enough of this recipe.  I love garlic so I added about 3 cloves garlic, minced.  It was so juicy and flavorful....honestly the best pork I've ever had.  Definitely worth making!!!!

Nothing was wrong with the meal as far as cooking and the likes of that.  I don't think Marsala is for me and I can't score something low because of my tastes when trying something new.

I used this recipe to revive a, super dry, smoked pork tenderloin. It TOTALLY fixed it! I used a can of condensed mushroom soup instead of fresh mushrooms though. baked it all, covered with foil for about 30 mins at 325F and it was SUPER TENDER AND MOIST.

Delicious every time. I've made this many times. It is the only Marsala recipe I use. I've made several ways; with chicken and pork, with or without mushrooms, and with potatoes, rice, and pasta. It never fails.

good. Made it after cutting up the pork into chunks and served with rice and broccoli on the side. quality marsala is key here. I also added about a half cup of beef broth to the sauce.

I cooked some redskin potatoes in a separate skillet, wish I had cooked them with the chops and shrooms and marsala in hindsight. Still very delicious. Ladled the gravy over the potatoes. Very good!

Everyone loved this dish. Thanks for a quick meal. FYI...marsala whether chicken or pork does NOT have gravy. You have to use a quality marsala or your dish will be overpowered. Thankfully the first time I made marsala chicken, I had a wine guy explain that to me and which version (dry or sweet) to use based on my taste.

This was an easy recipe that we enjoyed. I did not use any olive oil at all, only three tablespoons of butter. I use extra thin pork chops that cook quickly. I will make it again.

quick, easy, delicious.  Followed the recipe, I did follow another users recommendation to saute the mushrooms and garlic separately first.  Used Masala wine, sauce was delicious, had to thicken with a bit of flour and cornstarch but otherwise fantastic.  This is a keeper and will make again soon.

I love to cook. I had pork chops that needed to be cooked or frozen (yes I cut it that close) and Marsala wine that I never got around to using for chicken Marsala. I figured why not pork Marsala? This recipe popped up and it has got to be one of the best meals I’ve ever made. Family was mad there were no leftovers! Thank you for sharing. It’s in my rotation now for sure.

I wasn't a big fan of the sauce.  I couldn't get it to thicken when making the sauce.  But the taste it added to my pork was amazing.

Easy and so delicious! A favorite at our house. Good with chicken instead of pork also. I use about 1/2 the olive oil but that’s my only modification.

It was very tasty but I’ll probably add more butter and more salt to taste. Was wonderful over rice. Can’t wait to try it again.

I tried this recipe because I like both Veal and Chicken  Marsala.  I can't say the same  about. Pork. The ingredients aren't properly balanced -- way too much mushrooms and Marsala. I didn't like the taste of the Marsala with pork, maybe a dry white wine would be better.

This was excellent. I followed recipe exactly which I always do first time out. Restaurant quality. I served it with garlic mashed and garlic cauliflower. Yum! This is a keeper. May consider using this recipe for a chicken Marsala.

Despite using Marsala cooking wine instead of bottled Marsala from a liquor store, and having only half of the wine called for in the recipe, this recipe turned out really well. My family loved it and I can't wait to try it again with a stronger wine essence, or possibly another kind of wine. I used thick chops. Obviously, with thinner chops one would need to reduce the cooking time so the chops don't become too dry.

The recipe is easy to follow and the dish turned out amazing. I love the fact that I can use it for pork or chicken and if I substitute beef broth I can use it for beef as well. It's wonderful!

I love this recipe and will definitely be making it again!!! I just added more granulated garlic to the dredge and several more cloves of fresh minced garlic to the sauce. I used vegetable broth to make more gravy! Everyone loved it and I’m sure you will too.....

Five stars for the spices. I made this a low- carb version. I used chicken thighs because that's what I had. I'll use pork chops next time. I used almond flour instead of white flour. I fried the chicken until it was crispy them I baked it for about 45 minutes. I served it with mushroom/cauliflower "mashed potatoes".

Didn't bother hammering the chops, just cooked them a little longer. This recipe has tons of potential, lots of room for playing around.

This is a restaurant quality recipe!  Don't change a thing and make sure to use Marsala wine.
My husband loved it and it is so easy to make and quick too.  A wonderful change from chicken marsala which we love. I used  thick cut bone-in pork chops.  Next time I may buy a whole pork loin and cut it into thick boneless chops.  
Thanks for this great recipe - it is a real keeper!

Missing 1 step after adding the wine simmer 5 minutes to burn off the alcohol then add 1 cup of stock let it simmer for about 5 more minutes and add the pork back in  this way you will have plenty of gravy. Otherwise  this recipe is spot on...

I loved it! Usually have had  dry pork chops and this recipe was so flavorful and chops tender!  Next time i need to brown the pork chops  a bit more and then pour in wine and  mushrooms to simmer. Delicious! Great for company.

I have made this dish and it's great. My rendition  is cooking a thicker pork chop at 220 F for 2 1/2 hrs. with just salt / pepper rubbed with olive oil then finishing  with rest of recipe pan fried high temp to crust and mushroom wine sauce gravy  in a nut shell.  sprinkle fresh cilantro and a glass of red California wine  from Napa Valley and good company.

My guests loved it!
I used thick bone in chops which I sautéed about 5-7 mins each side to brown up. Then made the sauce with shiitake mushrooms and let thicken before returning chops on a low simmer til cooked through.
Also used minced shallots rather than garlic.
Left overs tasted even better next day.  I will make day before next time!

I don’t know what I did wrong but the sauce didn’t thicken up at all nor was it dark. I welcome suggestions please. The mushrooms took most of the flavor, leaving the pork bland in comparison. Please help. 5 stars because I don’t want my errors to take away del

I stuck to the recipe for all steps but the garlic salt (doubled for taste), and was pleasantly surprised at how delicious it came out. Husband approved so we now have a new staple.

Unfortunately, I didn't have any fresh mushrooms and used canned button mushrooms.  I think this dish really needs fresh mushrooms.  I can imagine that fresh Shitaki mushrooms or a nice Morel  would really kick this recipe up.  I will make it again soon...with better mushrooms.

I used this as a foundation since I didnt have any mushrooms and only cooking Sherry.  After I browned the pork I added some of the left over flour, minced garlic then sherry for a sauce.  Then added a store bought packet of pork gravy to a cup of cold water and poured that into the sauce.  Once thickened,  I ladled it over the pork and let sit on very low at almost no simmer for about a half hour.  YUM!  :)

I took the chops out of the pan before adding wine and mushrooms to avoid over cooking the pork. I had to substitute for the Marsala and added a full TB of salt. Delicious!

This recipe is easy and delicious. The hubby was getting a little burnt out on pork so I decided to try this recipe. It's now one of our favorites! Even my 4yo daughter loves it and now claims mushrooms are her favorite vegetable. Win for the whole family!

This is a keeper. The only change I may make in the future is to find dry marsala rather than sweet, it was a bit too sweet for me. I used part white button and part baby Bella mushrooms, delicious. I cooked wide noodles and stirred them into the sauce and mushrooms after removing the pork.

Wonderful flavor.  I used bone-in chops, which I think are more tender and flavorful.  Also, I simmered them a little longer than the recipe calls for -- I really don't like tough pork chops!  Very good recipe.

Picky Family loved it! Only substitution was cabernet sauvignon for Marsala because I had it on hand.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

I've always cowered away from pork chops from childhood experiences that were less than appealing.  These turned out juicy, tender, with ample sauce and mushrooms for all.  Truly a keeper!!  I wouldn't change a thing.

Delicious and so easy to make.  I adjusted recipe to make 2 servings and used thinner loin chops.  Total cooking time for the chops took about 10 minutes.  I did not use mushrooms because my husband won't eat them.  This  is such a yummy  way to prepare pork chops.  The only thing I would change next time, is to use slightly less olive oil.  The sauce was a little oily.

Good stuff! I would add a few small changes:

Use half the marsala
Use a small amount of chicken stock and flour for the sauce/gravy

Otherwise it tastes excellent and pork is half the cost of chicken these days!

Turned out great!  My boyfriend doesn't like mushrooms so I left them out and added shallots. I also reserved a little of the flour mixture because I wasn't sure if the sauce would be thick enough and it wasn't so I added a tablespoon to the sauce and that did the trick!

This was surprisingly good. The recipe and directions are perfect though I made some changes.  I bought pork chops with the bone but followed the recipe for cooking as described (but didn't pound them flat) and they were moist and delicious.  I did take out the pork chops from the pan once I browned them so I could quickly saute the mushrooms and garlic. Once I added the wine I put the chops back in and simmered, covered about 12-15 min. The only major change I made was that I used sherry instead of marsala because that's what I had in the house. I was worried that the sherry wouldn't taste good but it was great. This will be made again for sure.

4.5 stars.  We had this tonight for our 21st anniversary of getting together dinner.  No Marsala in the house, I used Merlot.  So, we drank Merlot also and had a zucchini casserole (also on this site) and fresh grape tomatoes/cucumbers from the garden.  Made as written, it was very good.  I didn't have any problem with the sauce being too thick, in fact, in was thin so I had to thicken it with a flour slurry.

The flavor was amazing, but they were very dry. Not entirely sure what I did wrong. The family decided to let me try it again one night, I'm going to try putting it in the crock pot. I'll update next time I try it.

This was super-easy and had a nice subtle flavor. My only complaint is that it was much too wet. The sauce didn't thicken up and reduce the way I expected, and I even left the lid off the pan for the last part of the cooking time. Still, I would make it again, but perhaps use less wine and less oil.

Made exactly as recipe stated. No sense rated it if I changed something I would be rating something different. The Marsala flavour was quite strong but very good. I would make it again but cut back a bit on the Marsala.

Recipe turned out fabulous, have made Marsala chicken breasts before but never with pork chops. This is definitely a keeper.

Great recipe. Came out delicious. Definitely a keeper. The only thing I changed is I took the pork out, then sautéed mushrooms and garlic with Marsala. After, I placed the pork back in and let it simmer a bit.

OMG, this was delicious !!!! You think kids are picky  Well, I'll tell you my husband has them beat !!!!  I made this the other night FABULOUS !!!!  EASY-PEASY !!!!  No mess.

The only thing was it didn't say after you browned the meat to take it out before you put the mushrooms and garlic in, I don't know if it was a mistake or not, but I think it would be too hard to stir all that stuff together.  I did take the meat out while I browned the mushrooms and garlic.  I put the wine in brought to a boil and put the chops in.  Now here is the part that scared me a little.  I thought OMG, I'm putting in pork chops for 15 min. and I already browned them and they are probably almost done anyway and I'm going to cook them for another 15 minutes?  They are going to be sooo dry !!! They were the most TENDER AND JUICY chops we ever ate !!!!  Yes, my husband said "it's a keeper"  I VERY RARELY hear that.  He is strictly a plain meat and potatoes man, and mostly cooked out on a charcoal bar-b-Que grill.  So definitely try this one, well worth it.  I would make it for a dinner party.  **If you didn't want to use wine, you could also use chicken or beef broth, you wouldn't get the sweetness of the wine, maybe add a little sugar to the broth.

I thought is was great and husband also liked it.  Used a whit wine I opened and did not like that much as it was a bit sweet and it was perfect.  Added some shallots to the mushrooms and also served with mashed potatoes and veggies.  Will make again.

I  couldn't find marsala wine at Aldi, so I used cabernet sauvignon. I used bone-in chops and removed them from the pan prior to cooking the mushrooms and garlic. I added them back before simmering everything.

Definitely a keeper. Very easy and nice presentation. I didn't have enough Marsala so supplemented with Sherry; I'll try again with just Marsala-such a unique flavor that I'm sure it will be better with just Marsala.

I really liked this recipe. It was very good. Unfortunately I did not have Marsala wine, so I used red cooking wine and it was perfect. I boiled some mini potatoes with rosemary,thyme and a pressed garlic clove. Then, added a tblsp of butter to the potatoes and served as a side. It was very good. It is a warm kind of place, so it will be an excellent option served during the cold months!

This recipe  was easy to make and came out tasting very good. The chops were tender and moist. The only change I made was to put the flour and spices in a plastic bag to coat the chops.

This was really good - I couldn't find marsala so I used 1/2C sherry with 1/2C sweeter white wine - the rest exactly the same.  My kids loved it, my husband ate 2!

My guests thought it was delightful but perhaps they were just being polite. While tender, I thought the  pork Marsala was just ho-hum. Was looking for a richer flavour with the Marsala wine contribution. Who knows - it just might have been Cook burnout after an active day

It turned out great! I did have to let it cook down a little longer for the Marsala sauce to thicken. But it went well with grilled asparagus and I did a butter/herb farfalle side.

In its' original state the Marsala was overpowering.  I added about 12 oz. of chicken broth to the sauce in an attempt to tone it down.  After adding the broth I let the sauce reduce to about 1/2 before adding the chops back in for the last 10".   When I make this again I will reduce the Marsala to 1/2 cup and add 1 cup of chicken broth instead.  I like to allow the sauce to reduce in order to intensify the flavors.  This is a quick and easy answer to, "What's for dinner?"

Yes we made some changes to the cooking method.  We did the  mushrooms in the skillet before the meat and took them out while we did the meat.  Then took the meat out while I deglazed the pan with wine.  Added all back in to simmer for 15 min.  Next time add more salt too.

Butter,  olive oil a bit much--drained off some before adding the Marsala--used this with some of the flour mixture as a slight thickening agent as the sauce didn't thicken. Taste was good.

I used a tenderloin roast and sliced thin pieces.  Doubled the amount of mushrooms (we like 'em).  Reduced the runny-ness of the sauce with a cornstarch paste and chicken broth, plus added a 1/4 cup of chopped fresh parsley.  Easy recipe that I will prepare over and over!

I followed the recipe except for the garlic salt, i used all garlic powder instead.  It looked and tasted great. I will make it again.

I found this to be straightforward, delectable and relatively quick to do.  Instead of using pork loin chop, I had about 3/4 lb pork tenderloin to use.  I made four medallions about 3/4 inch thick and the more narrow end of the tenderloin to create a fifth piece of meat, thinning them out as directed, which worked out nicely.  Decreasing the rest of the ingredients by about half (using only 3/4 cup of Marsala wine) but the full two cups of mushrooms worked out very well and made a perfect dinner entree for me and my wife.  Paired with sautéed thinly sliced zucchini with diced/cut green pepper and green onion, we had an enjoyable, nutritious (to my reckoning) and tasty meal.

This was delicious and easier than it looked for such an elegant dish.  Usually I make changes to most recipes but I prepared this one exactly according to the directions and was very pleased with the results.  I served it with basmati rice to capture the wonderful mushroom gravy.  This recipe is a keeper that I will definitely make again.

After reading reviews from others, I reduced the Marsala and only used 2/3 cup, I also added a cup of chicken broth; after it cooked down a bit, I threw in maybe 3/4 cup more chicken broth and sprinkled on more flour to thicken (we like lots of sauce!) Served with mashed red potatoes  and sautéed Brussels Sprouts and carrots. Was delish! Will definitely be making this one again

Delicious!  I removed the pork before adding the mushrooms and garlic.  Sautéed them first then added the pork back and finished cooking.  Needed to add a little more salt at the end.  Everybody loved this.

Instead of using pork loin, I used Prk Tenderloins cut in to cubes and pounded thin, makes a much better pork Marasela.
I also cook the tenderloin cuttlet first, then add it to the killet and let it simmer for 45 minutes, makes the pork so tender.

You can do this recipe with any thin cut meat. The cooking is quite simple once you have all the ingredients together. Also I vary the types of mushrooms as a change up.

Terrific, easy and one pan!  This can be elegant enough for a dinner party or a quick week night meal.  Oh, one major difference is I thought I had pork but it was chicken - it was still great.  Thanks for submitting.

I'm not big on the whole "measuring" thing, so I treat most recipes as kind of a starting point or a series of suggestions. Followed these "suggestions" with a few little changes. Used far less butter than the recipe calls for, no garlic salt (there's already garlic AND salt in the recipe?), and ended up adding some apple juice to cut the marsala a bit. Because the sauce needed to be cooked down for a while and the thin chops were done pretty quickly, I removed them to the oven at 200° while I let the sauce continue to simmer. 

Delicious chops, almost TOO full of flavour (served alone with salads, as we usually eat our chops, but I will serve over rice or noodles next time). This one's going into the repeat file.

5 stars for super easy, fast, and inexpensive. I have a "better" recipe for pork Marsala,  but it is more labor intensive. This is great for weeknights and all seven of my family members, ages 5-88, loved it. Thanks for the recipe and it has become a regular part of our dinner menu cycle.

I made the recipe as written. The flavor was good but the sauce was more greasy than anything. Next time I might cut out the oil and just brown the pork in butter then add some broth with the wine to reduce.

I thought it was great and would probably make it again! Don't use garlic powder or garlic salt so substituted minced garlic.

Excellant dish. I did add a little cream in the last 5 min of cooking. It wasn't too thick, and as a matter of fact I thought it would be thicker from all of the reviews. My husband & son loved it. It was very easy to make and I served it with some Basmati rice and snow peas.  It's been added to my list of favorites.

Made tonight for dinner. Bought a pork loin and sliced it into thin chops. Followed the recipe other than sautéing the mushrooms in a little butter first and adding pepper to the flour mixture. The pork was tender and delicious. Served with brown rice and steamed broccoli. Definitely will make again!

Make sure to pound your porkchops paper thin, as it will make the difference between a good dish and a great one! Made two batches tonight, the second batch I used a little less butter and a little less olive oil and they browned up much nicer. I added a tsp more of garlic to them and omitted the garlic salt and table salt. You don't need to simmer for 15 minutes with the lid in as they are not as tender, 8-10 minutes was just right. I served these over mashed potatoes as others recommended and it was a hit! I splurged for the $12 bottle of wine verses the $5 bottle as I made three batches of these to have for leftovers or to freeze for later. My son wanted these as his nighttime snack .

I made this last night, and my husband and I both loved it! Very flavorful and tender! I did make a few changes.  I didn't have any mushrooms, so I substituted yellow onions.  I cooked them first in the oil in the pan, then added my boneless pork chops to the pan (I didn't pound them, but they were sliced thin. I used Merlot wine as I didn't have Marsala.

We really liked it. It was very fast and used ingredients that I usually always have on hand. I added a little more minced garlic but I didn't change anything else in the recipe. I did use a semi sweet merlot that I picked up from Trader Joe's that I opened and thought was too sweet for me to drink. Everything turned out great. I served with cous cous and green beans, but next time I will serve with a browned butter and Parmesan pasta.

The sauce was not as creamy as restaurant version that I am familiar with.  Next time I will try adding a bit of heavy cream.

I make this often. It is a family favorite. I use canned mushrooms just because it is what I always have on hand. Still tastes great.  I use a nice big can since we all love mushrooms. This is great with some egg noodles or on a baked potato. Delicious and I make as written. Yummy and easy enough for a weeknight meal but good enough for company. Definitely a keeper.

It was delicious. The sauce wasn't thick enough to my liking so I shook up some flour and water, poured it in, simmered a few more minutes and it was perfect. I added fresh spinach in there as well and served with long grain and wild rice.

This was relatively easy to make and loved it.  I added a couple tablespoons of capers for some extra zing. I was out of garlic salt so probably should have increased the regular salt a bit. Other than that it was a hit.

Followed the recipe to the letter, absolutely delicious! My only complaint is that the breading coat was very slightly mushy, I think it needs a touch less sauce or to cook slightly longer. The flavor was spot on however, the mushrooms were heavenly. I served it with a lightly seasoned pasta... however, I think it's so savory it needs a nice sweet touch. Next time I make it I plan to serve it with a tomato/basil salad instead. Simple meal with a touch of elegance and class, perfect for company.

This was delicious. I used thin cut pork chops and pounded them down and they worked great. The entire dish was sort of perfect. Not salty at all and the meat came out extremely tender. The sauce was just thick enough and provided good coverage to the meat. Was great with roasted potatoes and green beans as shown in the photo.

Had to change my meal plan last minute so I made this quick dish. I didn't have Marsala so I just dredged slices in flour mixture and fried. Nice light coating and was ready in no time. Will certainly prepare it again.

I've made this numerous times.  I use either thin cut boneless pork chops or I cut thin slices off of a pork loin. Thin is the key as I've used thicker pork chops and they were tough.  I use garlic out of a jar and canned mushrooms.  Tastes great. I love this meal.

Easy to make, easy clean up.  Needs a little something, not sure what.  Also,  pork was not  as tender as I would have liked. Did find the sauce and mushrooms yummy over the angel hair pasta. Go ahead and try it you may  like it.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

The best pork chops I've ever had. I followed the recipe all the way through, except for the garlic salt, because I didn't have any. Although I pounded the chops thin, I left the bone in them for added flavor. They were absolutely the best! I wouldn't change anything in the recipe.

This was good, but not as good as another marsala recipe I use.  I don't know if it was too much flour, but I found it lacking in flavor.  It wasn't disgusting and it was gobbled up by my family, so I'll give it four stars based on that.

Absolutely loved this very very simple recipe.  I used pork chop that has a bone.  I added 1/2 can of chicken broth and only 1/2 cup of wine.  I used a very cheap brand of Merlot since I didn't have Marsala.  Chops were very tender and the gravy/sauce was  tasty.  I served over rice.  Will definitely cook this again because it really only took about 20-25 minutes to cook entirely.

This meal is amazing!  Made it a couple of times now and we love it!  Only change I made was not to add the flour to the spice mix. I then sprinkled the spice mix directly on the pork and then dredged the pork in the flour. I feel this  keeps more of the spices on the pork. Enjoy!

Delicious! I used twice as many mushrooms and no butter. I used olive oil in place of butter and cabernet in place of Marshall.

This recipe was delicious! I added a little Adobe to the flour mix, browned the cops then added some chicken broth and white wine. My daughter is very fussy with food (32 yrs old) and she raved how great it was! Kudos, will be making this more often.

I liked this recipe . It was a good example to follow. But then again I also like to substitute. When I don't have ingredients.  instead of Marsala . I used sav blanc  . Turn out very nice including texture and taste.

My mum and I made this (because she had made it before), using pork tenderloin (on sale) and baby portabella (cremini) mushrooms.  Served it with roasted cauliflower and whole green beans with with toasted walnuts.  Truly a 4.5 star restaurant meal.  It's good enough for company!

Super easy, super fast! Not to mention delicious!! Used thinly cut pork loin on the bone. I think the marrow adds so much flavor! Typically have all ingredients besides the pork in my pantry so super inexpensive!  My family loved and devoured it! Great dinner to make last minute!

We loved it!! I just wish I had flour my sauce end up too thin and I had to use bread crumbs on the pork. I also added some steamed broccoli on the last couple min just to make a more substantial sauce.

This was outstanding. I read a lot of reviews about these before deciding to make them. One suggested brining the chops prior for a really juicy result which I did and it was incredible how moist they stayed. She also recommended adding some heavy cream, but half and half was my wonderful addition for a little bit of creaminess to the sauce. I also cooked them in a cast iron skillet and what a lovely sear that created on the chops and it made for a very tasty result. I served this over al dente penne and my man went crazy over them, as did I. Thanks for sharing this amazing recipe.

Fantastic! I substituted a cup of onions for the mushrooms, and added a tsp of dried thyme to the flour coating. I had bone-in chops, so I did not pound them. Great flavor, very nice gravy, and pretty easy. My new go-to recipe for pork!

Due to the note about adding wine if the sauce was too thick, I was expecting a thick sauce. It was not. Other than that, this is definitely tasty and definitely a keeper! I served it over brown rice. Only thing I would do differently is to keep some of the flour mixture to thicken the sauce since there was no visible thickening while it simmered.

Outstanding!  I only used 2 pork chops and had barely enough sauce to cover the boiled potatoes on the side, but it was delicious!  The recipe hinted that the sauce might get to thick - I will use 2 cups of sweet Marsala next time. And be sure to thick cut your mushrooms, or they will turn into a soggy mess.  Loved how few ingredients it called for and how simple it was to make.  Highly recommend as written.

I made this with just a few changes, I browned a chopped whole purple onion with the garlic in the oil and butter first. I drained the onions/garlic on paper towels and continued the recipe as written, adding that mix back in towards the end. My husband liked the tenderness of the pork but didn't care for the sauce. I will try this again but will try using cooking sherry instead of the Marsala.

Fabulous!  The meat was tender and juicy and the gravy/mushroom combo was a hit.  I used white wine combined with Brandy in place of the marsala.  Great recipe... thanks!

My entire family LOVED this!!!  So good!!!!  (We did have to make it in two pans, since the chops were HUMONGOUS when pounded out!)  :)  Served with roasted brussels sprouts and fingerling potatoes.

I made this recipe the other night and it was AWESOME! I thickened the sauce more with the breading mixture + Marsala to add a bit of sauté to the brown rice I cooked it with. I served with a steamed cabbage salad consisting of red cabbage and home-grown white cabbage dressed with sesame oil, sliced almonds and a dash of salt. Delish!

Excellent and easy!!!  Pork chops were very moist!  I baked them in a 350 oven for 15 minutes.   I omitted the mushrooms as I don't care for them.

This dish was really good and well received by my family. My three year old even enjoyed this dish too. I didn't have any Marsala wine so I substituted sherry. It smelled and tasted just like marsala to my husband and myself. I only gave it four stars because I didn't have the exact ingredients. Although the taste was worthy of five stars.

I made this recipe the other night and oh my god was it good! I followed the recipe to the TEE.  I see others did all these tweaks and substitutions, no need to.  Make sure you use a good Marsala wine such as OPICI ($5.99 in my liquor store). Don't use one of those crappy ones from the supermarket.  This was so easy and came out delicious.  Served it with egg noodles on the side.  Thanks so much for this recipe.

My family just loved this dish. I did make a few changes. Instead of dredging in flour, I dipped in egg whites and breaded in Italian flavored bread crumbs with a little added parmesan cheese. I also added a splash of sherry to the mushrooms while they were cooking and added a little more marsala than the recipe called for. I was afraid the sherry and the marsala would be too much but the flavors worked well together. I will definitely make this again.

I like chicken Marsala so I knew I would like this. I cut the pork into bite sized pieces after it was cooked and stirred cooked rice into the pork and sauce so that it would serve easier at a pot luck dinner. This was tasty and easy to make. I will use this recipe again.

Amazing!  I partially cooked the pork, then used the pan to make the sauce.  Put the chops in an oven safe dish and poured the sauce over it and booked it in the oven on 350 for 10 minutes....just to rewarm!  Amazing sauce!

This was delicious. Whenever I make a recipe that uses pork chops I tend to buy a boneless pork ribeye roast and slice it.  It is always so tender and never dry like pork can be at times. The floured pork chops did not thicken the sauce enough for me so I mixed a little cornstarch and water and simmered for about a minute and it was perfect. This is a keeper.

I took a pork roast, and cut it up in thin strips for this recipe.  I also used merlot instead of marsala.  Very good recipe!

My family loved this! I substituted Mocsato instead of Marsala since that is all I had and the store was out also. I used canned mushrooms, again, that is all I had. I sauteed mushrooms and onions in the oil and butter first, removed them and then follows the rest of the steps with Moscato. It is amazing and so tender! I served it over thin spaghetti with green bean casarole as a side. Next time, I will do it the same way as I did this time. Thanks so much for this recipe!

This is delicious and great to serve with rice. :) I made it in a large cast iron skillet which helped greatly with the browning. I will make this again.

If you like Chicken Marsala, you will just Adore this recipe! My husband said he believed it was the best thing I've ever made -- and he loves most of my cooking. I don't tend to finish food and I ate every single morsel.

Love this recipe! My husband does not like mushrooms so I used a sliced onion in its place. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and my family loved it! I will be making this often. Thanks for posting!

How did anyone fit 4 chops and mushrooms in one pan?? In the end I put it in the oven, it was the only way to get everything to fit together. Didn't seem like anything special to us. I increased the oregano and mushrooms, and omitted the garlic salt, and decreased the butter and oil.

Fantastic recipe!  I upped the dosage and cooked a big batch for our house, and substituted in a somewhat fruity Paisano wine since I didn't have any Marsala.  Came out delicious, but the portions can be a little small, so we added some asparagus and a raspberry vinaigrette salad onto the side, plus a loaf of bread, and it really came out fantastic.  Definitely looking forward to making this one again, everyone cleaned their plates in seconds!

I have come to really like Marsala at the local Italian restaurant so when I saw this recipe, I was very excited. My only variation from the recipe is that I used pork tenderloin tips instead of using pork chops.  The recipe was very easy to prepare and the flavors were delicious.  We are defiantly keeping this recipe handy for the future, even though we do not make many recipes more than once.

Made it twice and got rave reviews from 2 adult men. The picky children even ate it. Used whatever red wine I had on hand. I did remove the pork completely from the pan while making the sauce. Great recipe!!

Delicious!  I halved recipe using very thin boneless porkchops which I browned then removed from pan.  I proceeded with the sauce using 3/4 cup Marsala, 1/4 cup water, the full teaspoon of garlic, and a 4oz can of mushrooms (I know, I know, but it was all I had on hand).  My only change after letting sauce reduce a bit was to had a healthy squirt of tomato paste for a little more body.  For a side, I sauted some brocolli and carrots, spooning a little of the sauce over the veggies for added flavor.  Returned the chops to pan for perhaps 3 or 4 minutes and finished by serving them over steamed rice.  I *almost* made egg noodles instead of the rice, but am so glad I stuck to the latter.  Will definately make again.

A little too much marsala for my taste, so will probably reduce the amount next time. This also desperately needs to be placed over pasta or a bed of rice to give it more substance.

Can't say that I had ever tried Marsala anything before making this, so I don't have much to compare it to. I have an strong aversion to mushrooms. :) My husband, however, loves them so I decided to give this a shot. We both enjoyed it. I cut the mushrooms up big enough so that I could easily pick them out and we were both happy. It was easy to throw together and had a great flavor. I think this is a nice company dish, also, because it presents well.

This makes twice that I've made this dish. Let me say that it is rare that I review anything...but this recipe is worth my time to review! When you consider the time and ingredients involved (all of which I had on hand)...you just can't beat this one for flavor and ease! I LOVE to cook and this was a great fun quick recipe, though I imagine a novice could turn out the same results! TRY IT...you won't be sorry! De-lish!

I made this exactly as the recipe listed and it was very good. The sauce has a wonderful flavor that went perfectly with the natural flavor of the pork. Kids and hubby all loved it and hubby snatched the leftovers for lunch the next day! I'm not a huge pork chop fan but this recipe I will keep and reuse.

Really loved the ease of this one!  I did change it a bit by adding baby bella mushrooms and cream to the sauce as my kids love mushrooms and cream. Plus i ran out of oregano and used tarrgon which gave it a unique flavor. But def. a two kid keeper! Thank you!

This recipe is great as is. I usually replace the oregano with a teaspoon of thyme (I don't like oregano), and add a finely chopped onion or shallot. You need to be a fan of marsala, obviously, and don't overcook the pork.
I pair it with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and onions baked with rosemary from this site.

Make sure you use the right kind of marsala and make sure to simmer it long enough so it isn't bitter. Then it tastes delish! One of my hubbys fav's.

This was delicious & everyone in my house loved it! Along with the cup of marsala wine I added a cup of chicken broth. At the end I thickened it up a tiny bit. I served it over thin spaghetti.

This was fantastic!  The best pork meal I have made in a long time. I did make some adjustments based on other remarks. I brined the pork first. I didn't have the Marsala wine, so I substituted 1/2 cooking sherry and 1/2 chicken broth. I also sauteed the mushrooms and garlic first  and omitted the oregano in the flour. Because I doubled the recipe, I removed pork from pan, added liquid, stirred up bits and then replaced the meat. I also tried another persons suggestion regarding cream and added a little bit of 1/2 and 1/2 as I didn't have cream, but it worked just the same. I served this with egg noodles.  My picky kids who HATE sauce LOVED it! Going in recipe book.

This is a great recipe! The pork was so tender, and the mushrooms were divine. I tried this same recipe again this week with chicken (because that's what I had on hand), and it just wasn't as good. I'm sticking with the pork.

The sauce in this recipe is truly delicious. I was not familiar with Marsala wine before but its unique flavor really rocks this dish. Unfortunately I over cooked the pork both times I made it--drat!

SUPERB. Easy and flavorful. I cut out the butter because it wasn't needed, and I used a skoch less than the oil called for. This was an absolute, overall PLEASER and I will definitely make this again! Thanks for the recipe!

This was very tasty. My husband and I lvoed it. Will definately make again. I personally like to see my pork a little grilled so I probably would brown on both sides and then do the butter, oil and add in the other ingredients. But would highly recommend.

I made this last night and loved it.  It does need some more seasoning - can't think of exactly what, maybe black pepper.  I thickened the sauce at the end w/heavy cream and a touch of flour.  I used way more fresh mushrooms than the recipe called for because we love mushrooms -- plus they shrink during the cooking process.  We had it w/freshly made mashed potatoes - delish!  My husband thought the pork should have been cooked a little longer ... to give it more flavor, but I loved it just the way the recipe said to cook it.  I had leftovers and can't wait to have it again.

As written, I can only give this two stars.  I felt that the marsala wine gave the sauce a bitter taste.  I first added 1/2 cup light cream and it still tasted bitter so I then added one cup of chicken broth.  I also thickened the sauce with some of the left-over flour and I added more of the seasonings.  With these changes, the pork tasted very good and worthy of five stars.  I served it over tortellini.  If I make this again, I will cut the marsala by half (or more) and use chicken broth and or cream as a substitute.

Will try again, short on wine so I did not have a lot of sauce (definitely need more than 1 cup).  Flavor was ok but not amazing.

It is a great versitle recipe.  However for hunters and families of hunters, many of these recipes can easily be adapted to game.They also can be tasty.    I made it with venision chops.  The sauce complimented any game flavor.  I served it with a barley pilaf and a honey tossed fruit and berry salad.  The presentation was great.

Really good. I substituted Melot for Marsala because I wanted to drink the rest of the bottle. I thought it would be a good recipe but as I ate it it tasted better with every bite. 2 thumbs and 10,000 taste buds up!

Very good. Personally, I found I didn't pound the pork thin enough, and I did add some extra salt and garlic.

We served this to a guest and he said it should go on our guest menu. The only adjustment we made was to not cover it as it cooked down. The pork came out very moist and tender. Excellent!

Due to interruptions, this cooked longer than it should have.  I'll need to make again to give a true rating, but it did have good flavor.

This is a delicious and impressive meal.  I used a pork loin roast which I cut up into bite size pieces and served over pasta.  I also didn't have marsala wine so I used Sweet Vermouth instead...our company loved it and wanted the recipe!!

I gave this four stars because I thought it was very good but not something I would fix again in a heartbeat. I shook the pork, flour and spices together in a ziploc bag to cover, I also doubled the spices. I didn't thin the tenderloin chops, the were fine thick. Will save to make again!

Made this last night, but I didn't have any Marsala so I used Pinot Grigio.  One of the  BEST pork recipes I've ever made.  Even my son, who doesn't eat pork, loved it!  It was quick and easy, too.  The only thing I did differently was that I didn't cover it after I added the wine.  I was afraid everything would get soggy.

I loved this because I love the flavor that the Marsala wine gives it.  My husband isn't much for pork, but he said he would eat this again.  I'm always in search of a new pork chop recipe, and this one is a keeper.
