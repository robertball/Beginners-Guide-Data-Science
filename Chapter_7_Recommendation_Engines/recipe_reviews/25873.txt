This has become a favorite in my home.  I usually use fresh seafood, but my fiance bought a 2-lb bag of precooked shrimp and we rinsed it under cold water for 3 mins. to defrost and it worked out great.  I substituted the parsley with cilantro (added a much better flavor), and garnished with sliced avocado on top and saltines on the side.  Delicious!

Excelent...I used cooked schrimp and small scallops in this and it was a big hit. Loved the citrus flavour.   I cut down on the spanish onion (personal preference) and served with corn crackers.

Made as written and this lacked something for me. Maybe hot sauce or something spicy to offset the sweet ketchup?  Also, the recipe did not state to do so but I think the canned oysters needed drained. The end result had no eye appeal and it dominated in oyster flavor to the point it was overbearing. I think draining and rinsing the oysters would be the key here.
