I don't know about this one folks. I guess the flavors just didn't taste right. Easy? Yes. Yummy? I'm afraid not. I really wouldn't recommend this one.

Chicken is overcooked in the twenty minutes and the sauce tasted like molasses.

If you like spare ribs then you might like to add the sauce from the ribs to the cooked chicken pieces otherwise I would not bother.

This recipie was simple and very good. I almost always have honey and Worcestershire sauce in the house. I can never leave a recipe alone, so I added just a few things. I added some more pepper, a little garlic & onion powder and some red pepper flakes. I like spicy, and the red pepper flakes were just enough to add a little more kick. I also didn't drain off any juices, I tasted the sauce and wanted to keep it all, I just added the remaining honey and cooked it a little while longer till it was nice and thick and sticky. I will be making this again!

I know followed directions right but i guess my taste buds just weren't up to it. my husband wouldn't eat it and my house smells funny due to the cooked honey. i liked it but after the first few bites it wasn't that great.

My family said that it was okay, but they don't want me to fix it again.  I was only able to eat about 5 small pieces of it.  It is very sweet and not spicy at all.

Did not like the taste combination. Scrambled to try and salvage the chicken as we couldn't really eat it the way it was. Had to rinse the chicken and try to save it with a mountain of other flavours..lemon, garlic, onion, basil, etc.

I thought this was great.  I added chili flakes for some spice, and I also added garlic salt and onion powder.  I started off following the recipe but then as I cooked the chicken I kept adding more honey.  Eventually, I had a good amount of sauce so I poured everything over white rice.  It was fantastic!

Strange. Can't quite get my taste buds around the flavours. Honestly I don't think the honey and the wostershershire work together at all. Way to sweet, with conflicting flavours. The texture was the only satifactory thing about this recipe dish, but on that basis alone, not worth it.

This was ok, I'm not a big chicken fan, but I'm always looking for recipes.  This isn't the best, but certain not the worst!

Thought this recipe was fast, easy and good! Great served over rice. I'd reduce cooking time though- 20 minutes is a bit long. Perfect for those nights when I need to get something on the table fast.

Did anyone try eating this once it was made? 20 minutes plus continuing to cook till chicken was sticky is a long time unless you like your chicken really dried. Awful, waste of money and time.

I added some garlic powder and extra pepper for added flavor, and came across a good modification by accident. I didn't have enough Worcestershire sauce, so subbed in some soy sauce. I didn't add the salt the recipe called for since the soy sauce had plenty.
