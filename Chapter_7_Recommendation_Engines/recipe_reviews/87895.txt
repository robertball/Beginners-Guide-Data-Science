My wife, a native of  Erie, PA, is the only person I ever heard say "Pennsyltucky", so when I saw this, I had to try it out on her. I did make a few modifications.  I used sirloin steak, chopped into small cubes, instead of ground beef. Once I got everything together it seemed a bit unsubstantial, so I added a couple of peeled, cubed potatoes and about a cup of frozen green beans. The flavor was wonderful and it was a huge hit with both my wife and my son.

Although it smelled great - it was way to "peppery"!  I think if I would make it again I would only add 2 teaspoons of black pepper instead of the 2 tablespoons it called for.  I used rotel instead of the red chili peppers, jalapeno and anahein chile pepper.  I also used 1 1/2 teaspoons of cumin.  I took the advice of the other reviews and add some potatoes to the mix.

I made this soup last night when it was about 12 degrees outside.  It was absolutely delicious; hearty and easy to make!

Great recipe. I have the 'wife doesn't like hot spice' issue so I left out the jalepenos. Also I added diced rutabaga instead of potatoes as other reviewers have. I just like what rutabaga does to soups and stews.

This is an excellent stew for those that like things on the spicy side.  The addition of a few potatoes was a good idea.  We'll make this one again.

This is great. I modified it a bit: I am vegetarian, so I used no beef or condensed beef broth. I used all condensed mushroom soup instead; next time, I will add rice or lentils to make up for the body the beef would have given this stew. Even without, it was still great! I used Serrano peppers and a habanero instead of an Anaheim chile since I really like spicy food. I also added a little bit of cinnamon for contrast. Will definitely make again.

I made changes to this stew because just looking at the anaheim pepper, the jalapenos and the red chili peppers and 3 tablespoons of pepper?? I said no way. so i substituted the red chili peppers with 3 chipotle in adobe sauce ones and did not add the jalapeno pepper and made it less watery - didn't add the 1 1/2 cups of extra water.  I used 2 cups of beef broth and the soup and tomatoe sauce, about 8 oz because that's all I had and it cooked down to a nice sauce and was really good.  No added black pepper. It just didn't need it. I would make it again for sure.  You could even add a few cut up tortillas (4 or so) and let it cook down for a great tortilla soup!

Yum! And, perfect for our family w/multiple food allergies.  I did modify the recipe to work with what we had on hand and it turned out fab!  2 lbs pastured ground beef, 1/2 red onion well cooked (I have a sulfur allergy and red onions can be problematic, white onions are a no-no), 8-10 small to medium red potatoes cubed, 3-4 cups organic frozen corn, handful of organic red-yellow-orange mini bell peppers, 1 tsp ea. of 2 different varieties of chili powder, 1 1/2 tsp of cumin, several pinches of curry, 3 tbsp worcestershire sauce, 1 can organic tomato sauce, 1/2 can organic pumpkin puree, 4 cups homemade beef broth (GAPS diet recipe including fat and morrow).  Cook following the same ingredient order in the main recipe (I put all spices in together at the earlier time mentioned). Entire family loved it...expect the oldest who said it was a bit acidic for her throat (we typically don't use that much tomato sauce).
