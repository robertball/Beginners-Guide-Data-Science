These cookies are  awsome! i did make some  minor changes though, i used 3 eggs, substituted milk for the water, and added 1 1/2 cup of peanut butter. They were not to cake-like and not to crumbly! perfect in between!

This was the BEST peanut butter cookie recipe I have ever made!  My husband and kids loved it and so did my company!  :)  It was VERY easy, and quick to make.  I did add more peanut butter to my recipe though, I think I put in 2 cups instead of the 1 cup it calls for.  This made a more peanut-buttery taste to the cookies. Try this one, it is easy and the cookies FLY off your cookie rack the second they are baked!  :)

This recipe was so quick and easy.  I made them as bars.  I crisscrossed them with a fork and then baked them form about 18 minutes in a 9X13 metal pan.  Then, when I took them out of the oven, I loosened the edges and turned them upside down onto a cookie sheet and cut them with a pizza cutter.  Yum!  I used almost a whole jar of pnut butter, too!  Thanks for a great recipe, Janet!

EXCELLENT!!!!This is the recipe that I have been searching for. After reading other reviews, I added 1 1/2 cups peanut butter, and baked for 8 minutes, and they came out absolutely wonderful! The kids loved them.

Absolutely fantastic- I added a little bit more peanut butter, peanut butter chips and chocolate chips and they were by far the best cookies I've ever made!  My family couldn't get enough of them!  Be sure to bake them a bit longer for firmness.  Enjoy!!!

This was a very quick and easy recipe.  I cut down the cooking time just a bit in order to have a softer cookie.  It was great.

These were so easy, and had a great taste!  They also were very soft.  I added 1/2 cup more peanut butter, and to half the batch I added chocolate chips.  My family enjoyed these and I'll be making these again when I need some cookies quickly!  Thanks Janet!

These cookies were very easty make. I think I might add a little more peanut butter to them though. I also think that I will try different kind of cakes mixes to get a differnet taste. I think Chocalate might be good!

Excellent easy cookie! The only change I made was to use applesauce instead of oil.  But they turned out perfect. I sprinkled with Pensey's Vanilla Sugar when I took them out of the oven.  YUMMMM!

This recipe yields some great and easy cookies! However, I strongly recommend, as others have, using 1.5 cups of peanut butter and 3 eggs.  I also sprinkled with sugar before baking, and baked for 12 minutes. Adding the extras yields 5 dozen cookies. 4.5 stars.

I thought the idea was great, but the cookies were a bit too 'cakey' and not peanut buttery enough.  I modified the recipe by using devil's food cake mix, and doubling the pb (plus used reduced fat).  They are AWESOME!  My 3 Year old is not a sweets kind of kid (doesn't get that from me), and he LOVES these cookies.  Thanks so much for posting this, and giving such great ideas.

Nice peanut butter taste, but I followed the directions for baking time and they turned out really dry.  They break really easily and have almost a powdery consistency.  They're not all they're cracked up to be.

Good basic cookie.  I added more peanut butter as many suggested.  About 2 cups.  Still wanted more peanut butter flavor.  Hint:  To keep cookies moist put a slice of bread in the sealed container with the cookies.  They will stay good for days.

Like other cake mix cookies I've made, I use a melted stick of margerine instead of oil. I used Skippy Super Chunk peanut butter and added a pkg. of Reese's Pieces. Came together in five minutes and my son made these almost by himself. Great for using up those lone boxes of cake mix in your pantry. Next time, I might use chocolate or devil's food and peanut butter M&M's.

I was looking for a Peanut Butter Cookie recipe & came upon this one. I love trying new recipes & it was so delicious. My cookies didn't turn out anything like the picture shows. At first my boyfriend wasn't impressed with these because he didn't think there was much of a flavor & I did add the extra egg and an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter too, but once the cookies were cooled off, oh my gosh, then it was a whole different story behind this recipe. I think the key to these cookies is to allow them to cool before serving them to get the full flavor.  My future inlaws came up for my birthday & I put a plate of these cookies out & they loved them!!!  I even sent a bag of cookies home for them too.  Thank you for posting this recipe.

Because of some of the reviews, I did add 1 teaspoon peanut butter extract (Watkins) to enhance the peanut butter taste.  Prior to the extract addition, the cookie batter did have the distinct flavor of the cake mix.

This recipe was Ok..the cake mix overpowered the peanut butter a bit.  A very soft cookie and super easy to make.  I altered a batch by using applesauce instead of oil, and I made a thumbprint in the center & added jelly.  Need to cook a minute or two longer than recomended.

These came out great!!! I followed the suggestions of using 3 eggs, but I only had 1 cup of regular peanutbutter (which I used). The next jar I had was the Honey Peanutbutter (JIF), so I only added a 1/4 cup of that not knowing how the honey would affect the cookie. The cookies taste great - add I am sure they would be even better with some chocolate chips. Love the soft texture too!  I used the double pudding Classic Butter cake mix from betty crocker.

I tried this one because I had all the ingredients and it looked easy.  WOW!  I didn't change any ingredients and I made the cookies really big.  I had been proofing some bread in my oven, so I left the pan of water on the bottom when I baked the cookies.  I baked the cookies on a metal sheet with a fiberglass baking mat on it and WOW!  These cookies were MOIST, scrumptious and not at all crumbly!  The edges browned but they didn't get crispy.  Mouth-watering!  The second batch is in now with fork marks & sugar!  This will be THE peanut butter cookie recipe for our family.  AMAZING!

This is a very quick and delicious recipe. Instead of flattening with a fork, I dropped teaspoons of the dough in mini muffin pans. I baked them at the same temp and time as the recipe said. When they came out of the oven, I immediately pushed an unwrapped peanut butter cup in the middle. Let cool before removing from the pan. DELICIOUS!!!

Absolutely scrumptious!!  We were out of yellow so we experimented with lemon cake mix instead.  The cookies turned out surprisingly well.  The tanginess of the cake mix added an extra kick to the recipe.

What great cookies. Very easy and delicious.  I added an extra half cup of peanut butter but it still wasn't peanutty enough for me.  I'll try more next time.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Good cookies. Needs a little more peanut butter added. My husband liked them. I will make again with more peanut butter.

It took almost twice as long to cook as the recipe said.  I thought that the cookie didn't taste very peanut-buttery, and it seemed to have a funny aftertaste.

They were kind of dry and didn't have much taste.  I could barely taste the peanut butter.  My family agreed.

I made these for my dad for Father's Day because he likes soft peanut butter cookies and my own recipes are all "sinkers" as he calls them--hard and crunchy.  I justs put all of the peanut butter I had on hand, which turned out to be about 1 1/2 cups.  I forgot the water but I didn't need it.  Formed them with a 1-inch cookie scoop and placed them on parchment lined sheet.  Baked exactly 10 minutes at 350.  REALLY GOOD RECIPE!  One thing I'm goining to change for next time: adding 1/2 tsp salt.  Going to put this one in my personal recipe collection!

Meh. It was okay, but I'd prefer even store-bought cookies to these. They were easy to make but not even really worth the effort. I'll stick with from-scratch cookies from now on.

This recipe was good, though I recommend, as others did, to increase peanut butter to 1 and 1/2 cups instead of just one cup.  I added about 1/2 to 2/3 cup chocolate chips, and I dropped them by the tablespoonful. (Not teaspoonful)  (This made larger cookies - looks better).   I would DEFINITELY NOT bake for the prescribed time of 10-12 minutes. Start checking at 8 min., which is when mine were done.  Overall a decent recipe when something is needed quickly ...

Nice soft cookies. Would like to add peanuts or more peanut butter to the mix but other than that, it was a nice treat. I used White Cake batter and it turned out fine :)

Huge hit with the kids. Just o.k. for me. On taste, I give it three stars but it is so easy I had to give it four stars over all. I mix all the other ingredients together first, then stirred in the cake mix. Much easier to stir together. Especially if you have a little helper with you. I did follow the advice of others and increased peanut butter to 1 1/2 cups, increased eggs to three, and sprinkled with sugar. Oh, and I dumped in about 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips. Even with the increase in peanut butter these seemed pretty mild to me. When I tried to make it easy on myself and dump it into a 9 x 13 pan I did not have much success with cooking it. The edges got to dark while the middle stayed raw. Devil's Food sounded like a good idea but they aren't sweet enough. They taste like a shortbread, so that's what I called them   ;)

What a good idea to use a cake mix!  It kept them moist and gave a different texture to the standard peanut butter cookie.  I didn't have yellow cake mix so I used Lemon Supreme instead.  It's an acquired taste but I thought it added flair.

The cookies are soft, chewy and delicious! They're so very rich too! To make its texture more interesting, I added about a cup of chopped mixed nuts (almonds, pecans, walnuts). The more, the merrier!

After searching for an easy & quick peanut butter cookie recipe, I tried this one!  I recently purchased reduced fat peanut butter-which tasted awful- so I wanted to find a way to use it so it didn't go to waste.  As another reviewer mentioned, I used 2cups of reduced fat peanut butter (basically, the whole 18oz jar).  They turned out great!!!  They are super easy to make - just make sure you use a large & deep mixing bowl if you are using a hand mixer.  I rolled them into balls in the palm of my hand, then let me 3 year old make criss-cross marks with a fork dipped in sugar.  I baked them about 10-12 minutes as directed & checked them often since other people mentioned the tendency to dry out & crumble.  They have a nice crispy edge & soft (but not mushy) center.  Will keep this recipe on hand for future use!!

Wonderful recipe.  I just added all ingredients to a bowl and used a hand mixer to blend.  Made it even faster!  I added a bit more milk, though.  Easy, fast, and my baby's first peanut butter cookie!  She loved it, too!  Thanks.

I love these cookies. I think that they are pretty rich for a peanut butter cookie. I read some of the reviews before making them so I watched them very carefully and took them out of the oven a couple of minutes early and didn't have any problems with them being dry or crumbly. I did another batch for the full amount of time and they did end up a little dry. I also used only half the amount of peanut butter the recipe called for and they were still delicious.

The cookies came out very dry and chalky and it crumbled very easily.  I didn't like it at all.  Although, my 2nd and last batch was alright.  In this batch I added 1/3 cup of brown sugar and a bit if margerine and some chocolate chips.  It made it taste a lot better and a bit more moist but it still crumbled.  I threw away the first batch and kept the last 2.  I'll probably not make this again.

These cookies are great.  I also think they are best a little underbaked.  They stay really soft.  I sprinkled sugar on the tops before baking and it was delicious.

Terrific.  Dough holds together  very well.  Nice and crisp on the outside and soft and flavorful on  the inside.

My grandmother has been making these peanut butter cookies with cake mix for decades.  I never knew why mine didn't turn out like hers.  Today I learned her secret.  Yummy, super soft cookies!

I used Nutella instead of peanut butter but otherwise followed the directions. They turned out great! I'll definitely try this recipe as written as well. Thanks, Janet!

I never thought these would be as good as they turned out!  In a pinch for time, I made these, but desiring more richness, added a cup of mini milk chocolate chips - put on the pan in small "balls" and baked for 15 minutes- PERFECT!  I could not believe they came from a cake mix box.  I read the other reviews afterwards and agree that if I were to not add the chocolate chips, I'd increase the peanut butter to 1 1/2 cup.  Not super peanut buttery - but with the chips, perfect!  This will be a staple in my recipe collection!

This is such a great and easy recipe! I would also recommend adding more peanut butter (one half to a full cup more). Other than that, it is wonderful!!

This recipe was really good!! It was very quick and easy to make, and I had all the ingredients already in the house! I followed what many people sugested and added 1 and 1/2 cups of peanut butter. I also added 3 eggs. I found that the cookies were just "peanut butter-y" enough, so that amount was sufficient. However the cookies, were kind of caky for my style. My cookies were perfect after 10 min. in the oven.

Not bad, and a good use of cake mix. However, I think my standard peanut butter cookies are better (basic recipe with peanut butter and no flour).

I used two cups of peanut butter to add more flavor, and the taste was good. The recipe was also very easy, however, it was not the best ever. The cookies came out looking wonderful, but even completely cooled they just fell apart in your hands. I ended up with half the batch in pieces and crumbs.

I loved these cookies!!! 
The way i made them better was by rolling the dough into a sort of flattened ball and sticking a hershey's dark chocolate kiss inside of it and then rolling it into a ball, covering the kiss completely. Serve warm for the inside to be warm and melted or serve room temperature to have the cookies more like a candy.

This was quick and easy!  I used crunchy peanut butter instead of creamy.  I also used milk instead of water.  My husband turned up his nose when I told him what I was making, but now I can't keep him away from the cookies! Excellent!

Yum!  Used a banana cake mix (did not have yellow on hand).  These are terrific and so easy.  Left out water as it was already loose with the oil, eggs & peanut butter.

I'm not sure what to put for the rating because I altered the recipe by using a reduced sugar Pilsbury yellow cake mix and I added chocolate chips and a bit more peanut butter as previous reviewers sugggested.  My cookies came out dry and not sweet enough...so I turned them into ice cream sandwiches which turned out better.

Easy, yummy cookie. I tried it with chocolate cake mix and confetti cake mix. :-) The peanut butter taste doesn't stand out like previous reviewers have said. *update* I rolled the dough into round pillow shapes (basically just skip flattening with a fork), baked for about 10 minutes then pressed a mini peanut butter cup into the middle. Also, subbed milk for the water. To die for! :-)

I had never made a cookie recipe with cake mix before so thought I would try this one. It was easy, but I prefer "regular" pb cookies. These were too light, soft and sweet. Will stick to cookie recipes w/o cake mix in the future.

Surprisingly, I did not care for this recipe.  I found the cookies lacked that "cookie" quality.  They were too light, too bread like, and I did not care for them at all.  I LOVE peanut butter cookies, but found these lacking.

I was very excited to try this recipe, especially after making and loving lemon cookies made from cake mix, but I was so disappointed with this cookie that I tossed out the dough after baking up the first dozen.  As others mentioned, they tasted too much like the yellow cake mix, so I'll be sticking with more traditional PB cookie recipes.

I gave this recipe 5 stars for the peanut butter flavor of the cookie and the easy method of using a cake mix.  I also added 1 1/2 cups of peanut butter as well as 1 tsp vanilla.  I'll consider using the extra egg the next time to see if it makes any difference in the crumbly-like texture.  I was pleased that there was not an after taste of the yellow cake mix. I will make these again!!

The flavor of these cookies are very good, but they were very crumbly when I made them.  I think next time I will try 1 1/2 cups peanut butter, 3 eggs and 1/4 cup water or milk to see if it helps.  I gave this 5 starts because the flavor is good, they are easy to make, the kids at VBS LOVED THEM and I think with a little tweeking of the recipe they will be perfect!

I halved the recipe since my family is not really a cookie eater.  I was a little dissappointed.  The cookies smelled and looked really delicious but the peanut butter flavor was too weak.  I will, however, make this again and add 3 cups of peanut butter and replace the water with milk. Maybe with these changes the cookie would taste better...hopefully!

Very easy. Ok, if you don't mind the taste of a boxed cake mix!

I tried this easy recipe hoping for a winner, but the cookies are dry and have a terrible artificial aftertaste from the mix. I knew something was wrong when I noticed their odd appearance when baking. They are easy, but are not anything I would ever make again.

This recipe gets 4 stars mostly for convenience.  They were SO easy to prepare, and were really tasty.  The cookies crumbled a lot... I may add more liquid next time.

Not the "perfect" peanut butter cookie, but still really good.  I'll make them again.

These were soooo easy and tasted excellent, very moist.  The ingredients are things you'll always have on hand.  We added chocolate chips to the batter & it was great!  A definate keeper.

I found this recipe to be rather dry and the cookies crumbled easily.  It had a nice peanut butter taste, but was not as moist as I had expected.  I added chocolate chips and I think it helped the taste.  However, I am still searching for the ultimate yet easy peanut butter cookie recipe!

Every kid that has tasted these cookies LOVES them.  It's a great recipe that is super easy to make.  Personally I like my peanut butter cookies a little chewier than these turn out, but you really can't go wrong with these...especially when making 4 dozen for a 4th grade class.

Very easy, however it did not have much flavor.  Needs brown sugar or something to be added to mixture to make it sweeter.  Just kind of bland for a cookie.

These were super EASY cookies to make, and they taste sooo YUMMY!!!  I cut the baking time down to 6-7 mins because I love my cookies soft.  If you like crisper cookies then 8-9 mins should do it.  Thanks for sharing this one, it's my new #1 PB Cookie recipe.

I made this with a chocolate fudge cake because it was all I had, and it was wickedly good! This is now my favorite cookie! Also very easy to make! I double the batch because they disapear so quickly! If you slightly under cook them they will stay very soft with a fudgy like center! :o)

These are probably the most idiot-proof cookies you will ever make.  Just mix all the ingredients together and bake. I love the softness of cake mix cookies, but if you prefer crispy cookies these aren't for you. I took the advice of some here who recommended using a cup and a half of peanut butter rather than just one, but now that I've made them I should have just used the whole 16 oz. jar. They had a very mild flavor, not as peanut buttery as I would have liked, nor as sweet as I expected either. My experience with cake mix cookies has been that they are always a little too sweet, but that wasn't the case here. I even sprinkled sugar on the tops as some have suggested, but that didn't really add to the sweetness. Overall, a good, serviceable, get-'er-done cookie, but if I really wanted to impress, I'd go with a from-scratch recipe.

My family loved this recipe! The cookies came out wonderful! I was able to make 2doz at a time placing one sheet on  the higher oven rack for lighter cookies and one sheet on the bottom of the oven for darker cookies. This way everyone had cookies they liked. I used the Oxo Good Grips® Small Cookie Scoop (2tsp) and it made 4doz 2in cookies. I would like to try crunchy peanut butter next time or add nuts. Thanks!

So good and so easy!  My mom has always made cake mix cookies, but had never thought to do an easy peanut butter cookie!  This was fabulous!  I did add more peanut butter and I added a theater sized box of Reeses Pieces!  Yum!

When you initially bite into this cookie, you taste peanut butter but as soon as you chew--it is all cake mix. I am not a big fan of peanut butter cookies but I decided to make these for a friend's birthday.
I used 3 eggs, milk, 1 1/2 cups of peanut butter and 1/2 cup of oil. They were in about 10 minutes.

These cookies are good but I found the cake mix to be a little too overpowering. I actually thought I would not mind the cake mix before I made since I love cake--but it just does not have a strong peanut butter taste.

My sister who is a very picky eater really enjoyed these so I guess it just depends.

Not too crumbly and a good texture, I would just prefer something with more of a peanut buttery taste!

I followed the recipe exactly and found these to be very plain with a pasty yet crumbly texture.  I even tried adding choc chips to the second batch to give more flavor but we did not like the texture.  Husband nor I liked them at all.

My kids and I are chocoholics, so I substituted chocolate cake mix instead of yellow cake mix and used about 1 3/4 cup of peanut butter.  The cookies were awesome and such a time saver!!!

Awesome, easy recipe!  Made these last night for an office party for Valentine's Day...followed the recipe with the exception of adding 1 heaping cup full of CHUNKY peanut butter.  Would have preferred to use creamy, but still good cookies.  I am giving these 5 stars for the simplicity of the recipe and the fact that they are fabulous right out of the oven.  These are definitely "first day" cookies...this morning they are a little on the hard side.  Hubby and kids LOVED them!  Thanks for the keeper recipe!

I love peanut butter cookies and I enjoy this recipe b/c I can make the cookie quickly. It can be adapted to suit your tastes. Of course we could make cookies from scratch but if you work all day and have a family you do not always have that option. It has a soft texture like cake and it tastes like peanut butter but it is a neat recipe.

Delicious. Just made a few changes. I used a cup and a half of peanut butter, three eggs, and sprinkled them with sugar before baking. Wonderful recipe!

These are great.Iused a lemon supreme cake mix so they had a slight lemon flavor and added a half cup of peanut butter chips.I also made them quite large so that changed the timing and the amount of cookies I'll certainly make these again.

I searched the internet for a simple rescipe with flour in it and I was very pleased with this one. I added a bit of cloves and cinnamon to liven it up a bit more. This is a keeper!

These were really good, although I added 2 cups of Peanut Butter. With so much Peanut Butter, adding and extra egg helps to keep them from crumbling. I will definitely be making these again. They were so easy!

This is a good recipe, but you need to play with it to get it to work!! A reviewer mentioned to put the cookies in muffin tins, it's a great tip!!!  I used Devil's Food cake mix so if you do that, reduce the amount of peanut butter, OR use the peanut butter without sugar in it.It is awfully peanut buttery  with the full cup . So if one uses Devil's food reduce the peanut butter to 2/3 of a cup. Also using The Devil's food cake mix causes this cookie to taste like a mock peanut butter cup.

Very quick and easy to make, but I didn't like them at all. All I had on hand was chocolate cake mix and I added extra peanut butter but they still had no flavor. My 1 and 3 year olds had no complaints.

I sent this recipe for my Grandmother to try and we both came up with the same results.  They were somewhat dry tasting.  I felt the flavor was good and chewy.  They were very crumbly, though.  I put the crumbled cookies on top of vanilla icecream.  It made for a yummy dessert!  Not sure why they came out dry - I added a bit more peanut butter and baked them a minute or two less, but it didn't seem to help.

Thanks alot Elaine,  I made these for a church function and had a hard time letting them go.  I do agree however that they needed more of a peanut butter taste to them but I believe they were mild enough for everyone.  Even my Aunt who doesn't like peanut butter cookies liked them.  I will be passing this one on.

This peanut butter cookie was a hit in my christmas cookie giftbag.  It has a great soft/crunchy texture.  The cake flavor was a bit overwhelming for my tastes, but everyone else loved it.

I love this recipe.  I like smaller peanut butter cookies, so I changed the time to 6-7 minutes. And with only a few ingredients anyone should be able to make this anytime needed.

If my 20 yr old boyfriend and 57 yr old father count as kids, these cookies are wonderful!  They stayed moist for the 2 days they lasted, and I am "required" to make more next week!

wow, these were amazingly easy and really yummy too!  I like my cookies crispy so i left them in for about 15 minutes to get that cruncy texture.  oh yeah, i used chunky peanut butter too and it was delicious!

These cookies are extremely easy and very moist.  I made them with crunchy peanut butter and they were a big hit.  They only lasted two days, but they kept their moistness for their short lifespan!  I also added a little extra peanut butter, and I think that the extra peanut butter helped with the superb softness.  A great recipe to keep!

It's hard to find a p.b. cookie recipe where the cookies don't get hard in a day!  This recipe did the trick!  The cookies stayed nice and moist and didn't last much longer than 2 days around our house!

FABULOUS!!!!!!!!!  The reviews I read were indeed accurate.  These cookies were eaten instantly and quickly!  I took one reviewer's advice and underbaked them.  I baked them for 7 minutes and they stayed soft.  Wonderful recipe.  I'm going to try it with Devil's Food cake mix.

Totally awesome cookie and I'm not a big peanut butter cookie fan.  Moist, peanut buttery, and simple.  I had an order for 3 dozen and they were a hit.  I'm adding them to my baking list!  Thank you very much.
