My son has made these repeatedly for gatherings hes 12 so its pretty easy to make. Follows directions to the T. Reminds me of girls scout cookies somoas but fresher tasting. Its basically short bread cookie with caramel,  pecans, coconut and chocolate chips. I prefer mini chips or just not to as much chocolate its very rich.

Absolutely delicious!  The only problem is cutting into it.  The condensed milk cements to the sides of the pan.

Made as written.  Extremely sweet so be ready!  Easy and nice combo of flavors/textures.  I used dark chocolate chips and if you drop them on the warm caramel and wait 10 minutes you can spread them with an offset spatula.
