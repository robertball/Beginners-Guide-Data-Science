This turned out great, but I added a few ingredients to the sauce for added flavor; 1/4 cup of white vinegar, 1 chipolte pepper and a couple of dashes of hot pepper sauce. The flavor was fantastic and I would make this again!

This was everything a slow cooker recipe is supposed to be: easy, not a lot of ingredients, and great outcome.  Next time, I will probably brown the meat before adding to the slow cooker just to give it another layer of flavor.  Great basic recipe that could easily be customized to be more spicy or more intense, depending on your flavor buds.  This also would be a great dish to serve at a party - it appeals to many different palates.  Thumbs up!

Slow clap.   I used as a base, as i do most recpies I get.  I love garlic, and spicy items.  I modified it to fit my taste.  I think without it it still would have been great.  I love this and it showed me how to really cook the roast and have the true shred to the meat.  Cant thank you enough.   Exploding high 5.

Great recipe!!! I had to alter it to fit into a weeknight menu as most people are not home to stop the cooking process after 4 hours. So what I did was follow the direction my only change was cook my meat on low for 8 hours. After that I followed the directions and returned it back to the crock pot for 1 hour on high... I also added a good amount of garlic salt to the meat when it was cooking on high, it gave it such great flavor.. This is an amazing recipe and tastes so wonderful!!!! You will be so happy you made it!

I followed all the instructions and after I tasted the paste I had second thoughts about putting it on the meat. I did not marinate, just added paste and covered the pan. My 12lb brisket was in the oven 5hrs and 40 mins. I discarded the juices and made tacos with corn tortillas, cilantro, tomatoe, Mexican crumbled cheese, chopped onion, lime juice and added homeade salsa! These were DELISHiOUS!! My Caucasian family loved them! Thanks a bunch for this great recipe! I will have pictures posted:)

This was very tender and moist.  It was seasoned enough for our palates so I added additional garlic salt and some chipotle chili powder to liven it up a bit.  We made burritos with it the first night, and used the leftovers in quesadillas!  It's a great alternative to the standard pot roast! I'll definitely make it again!

Super simple and easy.  This is great in quesadillas, tacos, burritos, etc.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was fantastic!!  I think next time I might add some chipotle in adobo for extra heat as I like it a little spicier than most.  Excellent!!

Fantastic!  Another hit with the entire family.  Used a little less chili powder and cooked all day in the crock pot to give it that extra tenderness.  Served with black beans and fideo. Perfect meal.

THIS WAS AWESOME! I used tomato paste instead of sauce and I swapped the chile powder for 5 dried chipotle meco peppers that I had run through the food processor with the tomato paste.
This tasted exactly like tacos from Chipotle Mexican Grill. I will make this again and again. Just fantastic.

This was just ok as written.  We like ours a little sweeter, so ended up adding a bunch of brown sugar at the end, and some cumin to help round out the flavor.  Will probably make again with those changes.

Amazing! Based on another review I added a few splashes of smoked chipotle tabasco sauce to make it a little spicier-this is truly delicious and I can't wait to make it again! Serving it with taco fixings tonight!

My husband and I did not care for this recipe at all. It has too much chili powder and a tomato bbq taste that's is nothing like I would expect when making a barbacoa recipe.

The only thing I changes was I added chipotle peppers in adobo sauce.  My husband melted over it.  :)  Put it in a burrito.

This was so yummy!!  A tad spicy, but we like it that way :-) I did add some beef broth to the crock pot after adding the chili powder because the sauce became really thick.

It took a couple of hours longer than recipe indicated to get all the meat tender enough to shred. Next time, I'll use a mixture of chili powders to give it a bit more flavor.

Made as directed.  This was not as spicy as I thought it would be but it was acceptable.  It does indeed fall apart and makes a great topping for nachos, cilantro rice, filling for tacos,  etc.  The vinegar flavor is too strong.  I think the recipe should be changed to either remove the vinegar or change they type to red wine / rice etc. and add a dried de-seeded Ancho pepper to steep alongside the bay leaves.

Slow Cooker Beef Barbacoa Haiku: "Mind-blowing, so good! I've had this several times now, no changes needed." I think it's just great the way the recipe is written. I've made it b4, just hadn't gotten around to reviewing it. Sure it's not authentic barbacoa, but as far as ingredients, method, and end results go, it's tasty, and terrific over tostadas or tucked inside flour tortillas w/ all one's desired fixin's. I prefer it simple - cilantro and red onion, occasionally some grated cheese.

This was easy recipe. I doubled the recipe and it came out great! I also added a little ground cumin durning the 2nd half of the cooking time and it added a little more flavor. But that's just my personal preference.

This was simple and a terrific base for doing lots of other things :)  I made it up last night, added a cup of corn after it was finished cooking, and wrapped it up with some cheese in flour tortillas to make chimichangas.  Next time I do it, I'd like to add some chopped ancho or anaheim chilies to make it spicier.  The texture came out perfectly and it was a terrific treat for supper.  Thanks so much for sharing, lizbot!

Not bad, but I added 1 chipotle pepper, and I used 2 cloves garlic instead of garlic powder, and I  added 1 tsp cumin, and I omitted the tomato sauce, and chili powder.

We made this and my family loved it!  We just added a little more garlic powder when we added the chili powder and tomato sauce.  Very flavorful and not to spicy.

I thought this looked too simple to be very tasty, but I had the ingredients on-hand so thought I'd give it a try. It turned out to be soooo good! I used El Pato tomato sauce, which gave it a much spicier kick. I might have added a little extra vinegar too. We ate it with tortillas, cilantro and a little sour cream and had refried beans on the side ... delicious!!!

Good, but not quite the flavor I was hoping for. When I make it again, I will use apple cider vinegar and less tomato sauce.

I knew I wouldn't be home in time to do the 4 hours and 2 hours on high, so I set the crockpot on low while I was at work ~8.5 hours. When I got home, I followed the directions for the last part.  It turned out so tender and delicious and I have plenty of leftovers!

I've never tried beef roast like this before. We liked it. Great by itself or put into a tortilla. I cooked this on low 8 hours and then turned to high for just about a half hour after I shredded the meat and added the last ingredients.

I've now made this twice and it's a big hit with my hubbie.  Delicious in flour tortillas with lettuce, cheese,  sour cream, etc.  I did add a couple of jalapeno peppers to spice it up.

This was a great recipe for shredded beef, like we get in our local Mexican restaurant.  I really thought the amount of chile powder might be too much, but it turned out great.  We had burritos, tostadas and tacos from this meat and love every meal!  I might change the chile powder I use next time I make it to see how it changes the overall flavor.

Pretty darn good, and simple to make.  Just be careful to read the directions well.  I didn't pay close attention and dumped everything in at the beginning.  It still turned out really well.  Will be making it again!

Really good, made some adjustments.  Didn't have bayleaf, so I used a roast beef season which has bayleaf ,coriander, garlic salt, also added rotel tomatoes well drained  (your choice has to how hot ) along with a teaspoon of liquid smoke or to your liking. Other than that as recipe states.  Wife loves it!

Is it "authentic" barbacoa, not reallly.  Then again, show me a slow cooker recipe that is.  However, it was tasty and the kids devoured it.  For me that equals success.

Made it...used a couple TBSP chipotle and ancho chili powder along with the regular chili powder...i like it spicy. It's was like spicy shredded beef. Very easy ...very tasty...very quick. I keep meaning to buy a timer for my low cooker plug. I would think next time i cook it on low for about 8 hours..timer would make it easier to go to work and not worry about it.

Wow!  So freakin good!  I did as other users and added extra garlic and cummin.  I used Apple cider vinegar since I had no white and I cooked the meat in chicken broth verses water.  Amazing!!  I just love how easy it was too!

Turned out great. Rather than go with the "high" setting, I put my slow cooker on "low" and doubled the time. I also added fresh cloves of garlic and went with a white onion instead.

Recipe was good but I made a few changes. I added Chile California Powder instead of the Chili Powder because the first time I made it, it came out much too spicy for my kids and husband. I also added onion powder instead of the whole onion, same portion as garlic powder.  The changes I made were to make it more to our liking but the cook time was the same. We loved it and this is how we make it now.

Very good. I ran out of time to start this on slow cooker mode so instead I pressure cooker it instead for 40 minutes. We then followed the next steps, but reduced the amount of chili powder, added some dashes of chipotle pepper and used the slow cooker mode for 2 hours. Served with tortillas, rice, beans, Mexican blend cheese, and avocado. This made 7-8 servings for a 2 3/4 pound roast.

I had a good ol' Trusty Chuck (roast) in my fridge.  My family tends to like the same few things over and over, but I wanted to do something different.  I turned to A/R for some ideas.  This recipe caught my eye, so I decided to give it a go.  The rest is history!

Great tasting, super simple recipe. I added a bit of the new Tabasco Sriracha to my marinade and it was fantastic. I ate it as a nacho topping.

I made this for Father's Day. Every loved it. I did use apple cider vinegar and chopped garlic instead. I cut the onion in thick rings and placed the meat on top of the onions. I also cooked the meat on low for 7 hrs as I had to leave the house. I probably used a tad more meat than called for too. I added a can of chopped green chilies during the last 2 hrs of cooking. I will definitely make this again.

I altered the sauce a little. I use chipolte powder, a little bit of cumin and oregano. I also use a little agave. I don't use water and I put everything in the crock pot and let it cook away. I actually use pork roast instead of beef because it's much less expensive.  My husband really enjoyed this and that is sawing a lot as he is Mexicano.  He said it tasted authentic.

I can make a mean roast, but I wanted to add some 'options'. This recipe is great - made it to a T the first time and it's delicious. The bay leaves to add something to the end product, don't skip!  Cons - it's not really a "set it and forget it" meal so you need to see what timing works for you. Pros - GREATEST thing? When you put it in the fridge and have it for dinner the next night, it is even better - more flavor and bite.  We even had enough for lunch on Day 3 - and it was tastier than day 2!

Next time I'll add a bit more flavor with peppers or sauce.

For our tastes, I felt the chili powder was a little overwhelming in this dish.  If I were to make it again, I would probably decrease the amount by at least a tablespoon or two.  Also, I would probably not drain all the liquid next time, as I felt it needed some for flavor and for moistness.  We used this in soft tacos and also in rice bowls for a nice, filling meal.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, lizbot1.

I had barbacoa at a couple Spanish restaurants in my city and I always loved it. I searched for a recipe and found this one! I used all the same ingredients but the Only change I made is I didn't discard liquid because that's how they make it here in va. I made a lot of rice, put some in a bowl and poured the juice and meat over it! So delicious! Tasted just how I like it! Update--06/2017--I am still making this every few months or so. I always have leftovers because I make more than what it calls for in recipe. I put the rest in freezer and heat it up when I want it again. Thanks for the recipe!

Tastes great, but after 7 hours the meat was not shred-able. So I cut it into small chunks, and ended up with something like fajitas. Next time, I'll marinate it overnight before cooking.

Very easy and very tasty. Great for parties. Set out tortillas and let your guests make street tacos. Friends kept talking about how good it was.

Though I prefer to take this a little spicier, this is my favorite recipe for beef barbacoa. It goes really well in my homemade taquitos!

This was good using pork for burritos. Added some extra garlic,  garlic salt, and some Frank's hot sauce. The kids liked it pretty well. We adding some rice and added lime juice after it was cooked. J thought some black beans with it would be good.

We really enjoyed this.  Were worried that chili powder might be too much but really worked.  Had it both on tortillas and on a salad.  Even if it isn't authentic, it is good.

I have tried many recipes for shredded beef similar to what I've had in Mexican restaurants, but nothing ever tasted quite right.  I think the secret must be the cooking in vinegar, because this is the flavor I have been trying to duplicate. Excellent and easy.

My family all loved this recipe. They are picky and to find something they all agreed on was a blessing! I put it in a tortilla and put cheese in it and sprinkled cheese on it. Melted the cheese in the oven. Delicious!

Reminds me of the Chipotle Resturant Barbacoa.  Make your own Burrito Bowl at home and add all the toppings on top of the barbacoa. Really easy to make and tasty too.
