I followed the recipe without any changes. I wouldn't change anything about the roll recipe. It is exactly what I wanted. However, while I really like the crunchiness and texture of the topping, I really disliked the taste. Particularly, I thought it tasted too much like the active yeast. Meanwhile, my partner thought the sugar made the topping too sweet. I'll definitely make this again but with adjustments to the topping. Thanks for sharing this! Our grocery store always runs out of these, and I'm happy to be able to make them at home.
