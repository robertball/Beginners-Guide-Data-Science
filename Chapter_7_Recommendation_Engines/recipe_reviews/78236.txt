I couldn't find the graham cracker pie crust in the supermarket so I made my own using graham crackers and butter. The next problem I had was trying to spread the pudding mix into the pan. It didn't want to spread at all. It acted like a ball of bread dough. After finally getting the mix in the bottom of the pie crust, the cranberries spread really easy but when I tried to spread the remaining pudding mix, it wouldn't spread so I added more milk to thin it down. Even that didn't help. When I was finally done spreading the pudding mix on top of the cranberries, the pudding mix was mixed with the cranberries making it steaked with pudding mix. To make it look better I put all the walnuts on top to hid the purple and yellow mixture. That helped some but it still didn't look very apealing so I added the rest of the cranberries on top of the walnuts then covered the entire thing with the whipping cream.  It did look a little more apealing.  It did set up really nice after four hours in the frig.  My wife who loves cheesecake and also loves cranberries liked it and said it tasted really good. I personally thought it was to sweet but she said that's the way cheesecake is supposed to be. Anyway I gave it three stars because it did taste pretty good but it isn't a recipe that I would recommend because it is really messy to make.
