Ok, this is my own recipe, but i have to "rate" it in order to make some adjustments. Firstly, a roasting pan is what i recommend using. Second, red AND yellow capsicums are lovely for this. Third, the potatoes might even take 10 minutes, just cook until they pierce easily with a knife.

Before tossing the finished salad, mash up some of the garlic to add to the dressing.

Bon Appetit :)

Fixed this last night and we loved it!  The fresh herbs were wonderful with the roasted vegetables and tomatoes.  Tossed with the spinach, pine nuts and Balsamic vinegar, this was a fantastic combination.  I'm going to serve this next time we have company.

This was really good! I made it to bring to a friends house. I was asked to bring a salad, but didn't want to bring a traditional lettuce tomato cucumber bla boring salad. It's a cold snowy February day, I wanted something roasted and hearty. Wah-La! I Omitted the tomatoes, they are terrible this time of year in MA. I also opted to skip the pine nuts. I am not a huge fan, and I was on a budget. I used mini yukon potatoes cut in half. The person who submitted this recipe also rated it to add some suggestions. She is right, you will need to nuke the potatoes for about 8-10 mins so they are just fork tender. 3 mins is not enough. Also, I took some of the roasted garlic out and mashed it into the vinegar like she also suggested, and tossed everything together. O man was it tastey! I tossed in sliced mushrooms to roast with the other veggies  cus I had them and i LOVE them. YUM YUM YUM! and really healthy! My husband and I are eating the left overs tossed with chicken tonight for dinner. Can't wait! Thank you for sharing this recipe. It was exactly what I was looking for!

ONE OF MY FAVORITE SALADS! I love this recipe and have made it many different ways! That is the best part that you can use almost any vegetable that you have on hand. I also like to add a dash of crushed red pepper flake. I get compliments every time I make it and it always makes the house smell lovely! Works great if you throw the veggies on the grill instead of oven as well!!!

I think it's a 5-star if you adjust to your taste; I left out eggplant, added fresh CORN at the same time as cherry tomatoes, used more potatoes cut into quarters instead of halves, used WILD ARUGULA instead of spinach, and added FETA.  Yum!  This is good warm or cold.

Firstly, I only roughly followed this recipe. (I don't care too much for RULES) But I really loved it! I did the veggies in a clear glass pan, and they didn't take nearly as long as the recipe indicated. I would just keep an eye on them until everything is cooked. I served this cold, over spinach leaves with balsamic vinegar, but it also tasted great alone hot!

I thought this was good but not exceptional.  The rest of the family didn't like it.  I liked the left-overs better than the first day.  Probably won't make again.

I know some people chose to go with frozen spinach but I thought the fresh wilted quite nicely. I threw some oregano on top of the veggies after adding the tomatoes and I served it with some feta on top and a crusty bread. Loved it!

I don't understand how anybody could think this taste good.  I may be far from a good cook but I did follow the directions to the letter.

Was making this for two only so scaled down the ingredients except for garlic. I kept 4 cloves of garlic because I can never have too much garlic and chopped it to a fine paste.  I didn't have fresh thyme so I used a little mrs. dash and white pepper.  During the last 5 minutes of roasting, I oiled some pita bread, salt and peppered it and threw it in the oven. We stuffed the pita bread with the roasted veggies and devoured it. It came out delish!! Thanks for the ideas!

Fabulous! I wouldn't call it a salad. With some brown rice on the side it was a great meatless meal.

I used corn as someone suggested, frozen, and roasted.  The corn was very crunchy.  I will cook it a little first next time.

Super flexible recipe.  I made all sorts of substitutions.  Used one large sweet potato instead of red potatoes.  Did not precook in microwave, just cut into small cubes. Buttered foil to keep from sticking.  Used one red pepper, no pine nuts or thyme,  handful of arugula instead of spinach and handful of cherry tomatoes from garden.  I did use eggplant as this was why I cooked this in the first place- needed to use up eggplant.  Really good, light and fresh tasting.  Yum!

Totally changed the veggie ingredients because of what I had on hand, but the flavor was AMAZING. I'll use this as a guide when I need to clean out the veggie drawer. Thanks!

I didn't add the potatoes, and instead made a side of mash. I made these to accompany the roasted sherry duck. Everything was fantastic. Love.

For the price of the ingredients, this recipe was too soggy and the pine nuts were a total waste.

Awesome!  I roasted it on the grill (on high)  in a large roasting pan and it turned out great. (I put foil under the pan.) I stirred it every 15-minutes and used the same cooking times. I used zucchini instead of eggplant, doubled the garlic, and added some fresh oregano along with the other herbs.  Also sprinkled with feta cheese along with the pine nuts.  I thought it was going to be too much spinach but it wasn't. Delicious!
