This recipe turned out very good after a couple of modifications. I added 1 tsp of cayane pepper, 1/4 tsp paparika and a 1/2 tsp of cumin to give it more of a kick. I also used canned garbanzo beans, drained. It didn't need the extra liquid. Next time I would reduce the lemon juice to juice of 1 lemon. It was a bit too tart and I didn't even add the 5 oz. My 8 and 5 year olds liked this too.

I love anything with pumpkin in it but I was a little skeptical about this.  I cut the recipe in half and used a 29 ounce can of chickpeas.  That seemed to be a good ratio because it tastes excellent.  My husband loves it too and he tends to dislike things that are nontraditional.

I love that there is a healthy alternative for holiday food.  I made this hummus for a Halloween potluck.  As is, it is a neat mixture between sweet and savory.  I will also try it with the cayenne, paprika, and cumin as recommended to see if it turns out differently.  I did add about a teaspoon of salt in order to bring out the other flavors.

Oh, man how I love hummus, and I've never been able to get it just exactly right when making it at home. That changed with this recipe! 

I gave this 5 stars with the admission that I didn't care much for the pumpkin pie spices and will not use them next time I make this.  I divided the ingredients into 2 batches because it wouldn't all fit in my blender, but forgot the spices with the first. It tasted divine! Next go-round I remembered the spice, but was disappointed in the result. I didn't bother adding spice to the other half, so the flavor was diluted by the time I combined the mixtures. To further cover it up, I added a couple dashes of cayenne and paprika. OMG this was spectacular!
 
The pumpkin flavor is VERY subtle, but adds a creamy texture and richness that definitely makes it a worthwhile addition. (Healthy, too!). Definitely remember to add salt to taste at the end to help bring out the flavors. You can't believe how much this small addition helps things along!

 After reading other reviews, I held off on the full 5oz of lemon juice and added it gradually to taste instead. With the omission of the spices, this is now my go-to for hummus.  I made this as a dip with pita triangles for a farewell potluck at work, and my biggest challenge will be to stay out of it long enough for my coworkers to get any!

YUM! I was skeptical, but I had some leftover roasted pumpkin and the reviews won me over. I couldn't stop eating this! Aside from using fresh pumpkin, the only change I made was to use two cans of chickpeas. The best way I can describe the flavor is like a savory eggnog (weird, I know). And the texture is so smooth and creamy--the smoothest I've ever made. Absolutely wonderful!

This is a great recipe. I incresed the spice to 3/4 tsp each and added a considerable amount of cayenne pepper. With these modifications, this is the best hummus I've ever had. I love the pumpkin flavor.

I've made this twice in the past three months. The second time I doubled the recipe. Even without doubling, it makes a lot. However, it freezes very well. 

SOOOO much better than store bought hummus.

I did not care for this recipe mostly because of the cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice. I enjoy more traditional flavors for hummus. Not sure if I will try this again.

This recipe was pretty good, definatley not for the safety-food crowd. I left out the tahini and lemon.I would add the lemon next time. It was really great on pita chips, pumkin dinner rolls, and unsalted seed crackers.

I thought it was good, but I'm not sure it's something I would make again. I like other flavors of hummus better. I'm pretty picky about hummus though.

This pumpkin hummus was great!  I made this recipe as is, but I added quite a bit more pumpkin so there would be a stronger pumpkin flavor.  I took this to a Halloween party last night, and everyone loved it!

I make traditional humus all the time and after trying this recipe, the pumpkin is a delicious addition. I used pumpkin puree that I made last Halloween and froze. The pumpkin gives the humus a rich warm color. My family is not big on pumpkin spices (cinnamon, allspice, etc), so I used them sparingly. If you totally omit the spices, the humus tastes like raw pumpkin. I will definitely make this recipe again since I usually have a lot of extra pumpkins.

My first experience with homemade hummus (and already looking forward to making it again).  We added the extra spices so our hummus definitely had a kick though I didn’t really think it tasted strongly of pumpkin.  It’s really important to make sure you have blended the beans to a puree – my boyfriend didn’t quite get there the first time and the consistency was terrible.  We added back in a significant amount of the water/liquid and finally got it to the correct consistency.  Don’t forget to add salt at the end!  I’m not a huge salt person but it definitely needs it (unless you are eating it with salted pita chips).  Also – it makes a huge serving (possibly the equivalent of two large tubs of hummus or something along those lines).

This was good hummus, but I think I prefer other flavors.  It wasn't a big hit at the Halloween party.  Maybe I should have labelled it...

Followed the recommendation by "bgoat" by adding the other cumin, paprika and cayenne pepper.   However, I would reduce the cayenne pepper by half.   It was very tasty.   My husband and 19 month old loved it, but my 3.5 year old was not very fond of it.

Okay, so the taste was pretty good.  I took others' suggestions and added cumin...pretty good but not sure if it was necessary.  My only complaint is that this was a complete mess!  I don't know why but this made enough to feed an army!  All of the ingredients were overflowing in the blender.  It was not exactly what I had in mind.  If I make it again (*doubtful), I will definitely scale it back quite a bit.

This was a hit at Thanksgiving, and could be served any time really.  I added cayenne pepper, fresh ginger,  ginger powder and more garlic to give it more zing and it was perfect.  I also used canned chick peas.

I found this to be very bland, even with the pumpkin spices.  But in fairness, I did start with a plain store-bought hummus instead of making it by scratch.  I prefer hummus that's really garlic-y though, and since I didn't think that tons of garlic would go well with pumpkin, I bought a plain flavor.  The spices and pumpkin puree didn't really add enough flavor for me.

Crazy amazing!  I've always made my own hummus...I have always experimented with different ingredients to add in to make it unique..  never, have I used pumpkin and I don't know why!  PUMPKIN IS AMAZING!  thank you thank you!  I have to say when we want hummus I'm not about to soak beans.  I take the short cut and use Goya canned chick peas.  amazing flavor!  watch it great pumpkin...I'm coming for you!

Not a huge fan of this recipe without tweaks, but I feel like its not because its a bad recipe, but more of depends on you taste buds kinda thing. I ended up drastically decreasing the spices and lemon juice. I increased the garlic, plus added garlic powder (I love garlic), added cumin, more salt, and chipotle powder. I think I'm just not a fan of sweet hummus, but to each his own, it was great inspiration as I never would have considered it!

Simply delicious!! We're dieting at home and having hummus ready is a great snack alternative to eat with veggies. I used a whole bag of dry garbanzos cooked in the pressure cooker and a large can of pumpkin puree (don't like to waste and that's all I had on hand), sauteed the garlic, and skipped the tahini since didn't have any, added pumpkin pie spices. I adjusted all the spices to taste.

This recipe is awesome!  I halved the recipe and even with just 2 cans of chick peas, I still used the whole 15 oz can of pumpkin.  Also added 1/4 tsp cayenne.  It is a great consistency and just plain yummy!

This is delicious!  Will definitely make again.  Took to a gathering with kids/adults and everyone loved it.  I did take the advice on the "adds" and it couldn't have been better.  Served with fresh pita bread.

My kids and I LOVED this recipe! Although I like to make everything from scratch, my time is pretty limited right now, so I added the pumpkin and spices to a pre-made container of hummus. Needless to say, it turned out amazing! Not to mention, it was SO quick and easy. Huge recommendation- serve with Stacy's cinnamon flavored pita chips, it perfectly compliments the hummus!!!!
