I did make some changes. I served it over a bed of steamed spinach with lemon and made a dressing from mayonnaise and Dijon mustard for the patties. It was excellent.

Make exactly. DO NOT use fresh tuna or salmon, it will turn out dry. Use canned and pour out liquid.

I have never heard of adding tuna to salmon so I was curious about this. My boyfriend who said he hates them well devoured 2 quickly and declared “He never had them like this”. I was intrigued so finally tried it and I don’t think I’ll make it another way. I did add a tiny onion to it and coated them in Italian bread crumbs instead of flour but wow. This will be my go to. And the reviewer that used fresh salmon and tuna def use the canned. I can see why it would be dry. This recipe is not meant for that. Cheap and easy comfort food. Thank you so much for a new twist on salmon patties. I’ll use this over and over.

I added chopped onion, garlic, parsley, and paprika.. I also reduced the saltine crackers by half. Both my husband and I love them and I will definitely be making them again.

Nice taste blending tuna with salmon and like crackers instead of breadcrumbs.

I liked the idea of this recipe, but, um, modified it.  I used ground fresh salmon and tuna instead of canned, 2-1/2 sheets of matzo, 2 T each of fresh chives, parsley, and garlic mayonnaise, and the egg, and salt and pepper to taste.  Pan fried for 3 to 4 minutes per side.  Good taste and crispy exterior, but a little dry overall, even with the added mayonnaise.
