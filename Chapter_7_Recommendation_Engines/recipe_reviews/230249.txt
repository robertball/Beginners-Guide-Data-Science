I really enjoyed this recipe. I follow a ketogenic diet, so traditional pizza is on my forbidden foods list. I decided to peel the eggplant, slice as directed, and then toss in salt and let stand in a colander for about 30 mins (to pull water out of the eggplant). I was surprised by how much liquid came out and I'm really glad that I added this step because my end product was just barely dry enough to be firm underneath my toppings. If I would have skipped the salting I think my pizzas would have been mushy. I topped mine with lots of cheese, bacon, and sausage...piled on high. Delicious. Thanks for sharing.

This was good! I baked the eggplant on parchment paper (less messy), first coating it with olive oil and spices (salt, pepper, garlic, oregano, parsley, basil...). Bake it until you can easily pierce it with a fork. We cooked sausage and added it to the topping with tomato sauce and a shredded Italian cheese mix. Will definitely make again.

i used this as insipiration, along with Julia Child's method of making eggplant pizzas, to come up with our version of this recipe.. i sweated out the eggplant rounds for 30 min's, precooked them with a thin layer of olive oil for 20 min's, then topped with homemade pasta sauce, parm and mozz.. cooked until the cheese was melty and bubbly.. these were good on their own but i also topped some with a bit of greek yogurt.. so delicious.. ty for the beginning of a nice lunch

This was my first attempt at cooking eggplant and I'm very happy with the results (and so were my mom and grandma!). I'm a college student, so cooking anything is a big deal and this recipe was easy enough for me to follow and not screw up hahaha! I pre-salted half of them to remove the water, and it did not need it. My variations on the recipe: 
1. added garlic powder with the parmasean 
2. used pizza sauce instead of tomato sauce
3. used mozzarella cheese
4. topped it with diced tomatoes and spinach

Served it with a spinich side salad with feta cheese and raspberry dressing. Made for a really yummy and healthy meal!!

This was my first time ever cooking eggplant... I'm in the process of limiting wheat and gluten and this was perfect... I coated with olive oil, fresh garlic, Sea salt and pepper... Baked about 7 minutes... Added my pizza sauce sharp cheddar... Red and yellow peppers, red onion... And baked for 12 minutes...  They were perfect... Next time I'll add some baby portabello mushrooms. I'm in love with this recipe!!! Thank you!

SUPER easy to prepare and cook--the longest part of the prep time was waiting for the over to preheat. This is the first time I've made them so I just followed the recipe exactly as it says, next time I will probably add some pepperoni or sausage topping. I will say (as I learned from experience) be careful not to cut the slices thick. The thicker sliced ones I made were really tough and not near as good!

It was fairly good on its own but a few alterations really perked it up. 1. garlic added to the Parmesan cheese 2. Italian seasoning added to the top of the cheddar cheese. It was almost perfect after that.

I've never had eggplant before, so I went through the recipes and came by this. I'm so glad I decided to go with this one. It's delicious! I added some basil, ham, and garlic powder. Will definitely be making this again.

came out great!   I just added oregano & basil at the last few minutes of baking and for cheese I used a nacho taco blend that I had around the house. I  think I'll add a few more minutes to the initial bake time since I can't for the life of me cut eggplant evenly.

very tasty and healthier than pizza.  I followed the recipe except added a few minutes to the 5 minute eggplant bake. Next time I may add some pepperoni or mushrooms.  Very good

It's similar to eggplant parmesan it just doesn't have bread crumbs.  Wasn't my favorite,  for sure will stick with Eggplant Parmesan.

These were really good. I took the advise of one reviewer and sprinkled them with salt and let them sit to draw out the water before baking them. There was a lot of moisture that I wiped off of them. Next time I will also peel the skin off. I added red onion and chopped mushrooms and added the cooking time because of that.

Made this last night as a side & must say it came out awesome.  Followed the recipe with two minor changes, used Romano instead of Parm. & used Italian cheese blend to top it off rather than cheddar.  The bake time took a little longer as my eggplant slices were thicker.   Baked it earlier and microwaved it to heat up & still was fantastic.  Not only healthy, but beautiful for company.  Thank you for posting this great recipe.

We made this over at a friend's place and loved it!  We treated it like real pizza though, and added bell peppers, onions, and sliced tomatoes under a topping of mozzarella and grated Parmesan cheese.  We also doubled the recipe.  I actually let everyone choose their own toppings.  I made my own pizza sauce with 1:1 tomato paste:water (about 5 oz. - 1 small can), 1 tsp. Italian seasoning, and 1/2 tsp. sugar.  I sprinkled basil over top the cheese.  It was wonderful!

This is such a great recipe. I cut the eggplants lengthways instead of in circles and even did a fully loaded version with sweet peppers, pineapple, sausage, and tomatoes. It was absolutely delicious.

Took advice to salt and let water seep for 30 minutes.  Made extra without the toppings so that I have a great little meal in minutes during the week!

I really enjoyed this as a side dish. My husband was not a fan, he thought something was off.  I did use soft mozzarella instead of cheddar, but that had made more sense to me for a pizza. Will make it again, but add more sauce for my husband taste.

Noto very good to our family.  I don't think 1 T> oil is sufficient, and iit was too chewy, even after a longer than normal baking period.  Maybe needs to be covered with foil?

I’m so going to do this again. I’ve never been a fan of eggplant but I’ve been cutting back on bread lately so I had do something to fix my pizza crave. This totally did the trick, the eggplant flavor was so mild that it was easily overpowered by the traditional pizza toppings that I used. Pepperoni, onion, mushroom and of course, since I live in New Mexico, Green Chile!! Try it, you won’t regret it

Excellent idea for those of us who want avoid bread! I poached the eggplant slices for a few minutes before baking just to make sure they are properly cooked, and it worked. Wonderful taste

I will make this again. It was very easy to make. Anything both healthy and yummy should be made often. 10 minutes on each side is better than 5. I didn't have parmasean but used provolone and mozzarella on top. Grilled chicken would be good too.

A nice alternative to high calorie dough. My husband and I are not that keen on eggplant but we decided we needed to give this a try. We followed the recipe but added sliced mozzarella balls instead of the grated cheddar and then we added diced yellow pepper, diced tomatoes, sliced olives and little chunks of chicken breast. Delicious! I think it's the eggplant skin we really dislike.

Husband hated it. I loved it.  

I baked for 5, then flipped. Added sauce, mozzarella, Italian sausage, spices. 

Baked for 13 min. 

I've never made eggplant before and I thought it was good. Husband didn't like the texture.

I used pizza sauce instead and adding some turkey bacon to top it off. Very flling. The only thing is the eggplant is a little watery and not  like a pizza crust. I'll probably cook the eggplant longer next time.

Soggy as could be.  skins would not even cut apart with a knife.  practically choked on them.  It was tasty enough.  I used mild salsa, which gave it more flavor.

i was trying this and because of the elevation the original person who posted this said i was looking at other recipes of this online to.. i messed it up.. i salted the eggplant.. and precooked and i wished i hadn't done that..lol i was trying to sweat it out.. and i didn't put paper towels over it..and it was to salty and i might had cooked the eggplant to long.. it came out mushy..lol what i had eaten of it that wasn't salty was really good.. and i like the idea of the recipe so i am going to try to tweak it more.. i did some with bacon, and some with hamburger,  used four cheese spaghetti sauce, mushrooms (i might need to saute the mushrooms ahead of time as that might had caused the mushy also...lol) and i had american cheese on it..

I didn't see the note about the original recipe being done at 6000 feet. I'd cook it for a little  longer or slice the eggplant  thinner. I need to tweak it a bit more to figure out how to make this work better. It's a good base, but keep in mind it might not work exactly how it's written, depending on where you live.

maybe my oven runs a little cool but 5 minutes wasn't enough for the first baking. The edges were a bit under done and the skin was rubbery. Al dente but good:)

Flavor was wonderful. Was hoping for a firmer base since it's called 'pizza' but the only ones that were crisp were the thinnest that kinda burned prior to being topped. Will definitely make again for the healthiness and good flavor.

I added salt,pepper and basil before putting the eggplants in the oven. And also I put some pineapple tidbits ham and eden cheese to taste more like a Hawaiian pizza. It turned out delicious.

I also baked this on parchment paper. I added sauted mushrooms and onions . Mozzarella cheese was my choice instead of cheddar cheese. Added oregano with salt and pepper. This is so good.  I don't really like eggplant,but was given one, so I decide to give it a try. So glad I did.

Really great ! I added pepperoni between the two layers of cheese, used regular pasta sauce, and used Swiss cheese for a different kind of taste. It was deeeeeeeeelicious (and SO easy to make). Try cooking your eggplant closer to 10 minutes if you want it softer (provided you cut thicker eggplant slices). I also did the cheese/garlic powder mix before adding it, very good! 
Will make again!
Enjoy!
