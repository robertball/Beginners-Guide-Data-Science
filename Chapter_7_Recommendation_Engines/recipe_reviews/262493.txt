We really liked these. They were so simple to make and they really did taste like a pot pie! I added a little garlic powder salt and pepper to the filling and used cooked chicken that I already had in the freezer b/c I just can't do canned chicken, lol. I sprinkled some everything bagel seasoning on the top, which was a nice touch. The family liked these a lot, so I will be making them again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Won’t make it again.  Too much biscuit for each dollop of filling, plus the filling is definitely not good.  I’m thinking it’s probably the cream of chicken that dooms it.

I used a rotisserie chicken instead of canned meat and it turned out really well.

Really a good way to use left-over / extra roasted chicken. I like the biscuit idea better than other prepared dough items. I like to make these up and freeze (cooked) for  later.

Christina!!!  OMG  What an AWESOME idea!  I always put off making CPP bc it takes so much time. (Lazy-bones)...  But my husband likes to have crust on the top & Bottom so this will fill that need easily!  I might try using ref. piecrust as a substitute for the biscuits and see how he likes that (he is a picky crust person and doesn't like soggy anything LoL).  Thanks so much Christina and love your sweet pictures!!

I used crescent rolls instead of Grands because they were already flattened out.  The biscuit flavor ruined it for me. I'm used to pot pies having a different flavor. Won't be making these again.

I gave the recipe four stars only because of the technique used and recommended for the canned bisquits. They were alot of work to get thin and large enough to handle a reasonable amount of filling. On a second attempt, I used a glass as a rolling pin, with a floured surface to work on. This was much better. However, I believe I might go with refrigerated dough the next time to make the pockets larger which will hold more filling. Fewer but larger pockets. Or, maybe use two bisquits rolled thin per pocket. The filling was absolutely delicious as is. I did use premium, canned pulled chicken which happened to be on sale.

Excellent recipe to make with the kids. Used chicken thighs and added some finely minced garlic. The family loved it and the kids requested it be added to our  regular weeknight meal menus.

Flavor was good, added additional seasoning (21 Seasoning Salute from Trader Joes) to bump up the flavor, used can chicken, but it took FOREVER to flatten these out enough to handle enough filling to be worth it. Also took a few tries to figure out how much filling I could fit  in and still seal it. I was actuallly  able to fully bake the first 8 in the time it took me to prepare the second roll of biscuits. Definitely impossible to do in the amount of  time indicated.

I did however tweak this recipe!!  I used freshly sauted chicken breasts that were then shredded.  I cooked them in butter, garlic powder and salt and pepper. I also added about 1 tablespoon garlic powder to the filling; and I used fresh, finely diced carrots, celery and potatoes.   I also did not use Grands or anyone else's biscuits.  I made a quick pie dough and using 2" circles, filled them with about 2 -3 Tablespoons of the filling and then folded in half like you would do for a real empanada.  They came out really great.  Two of them were a meal.

Family loved it. Three out of five family members gave it a solid five stars. My picky daughters gave it four stars. Which is a good rating for them! I will definitely make again. One suggestion, don’t use store brand biscuits.

The  only issue I have with this dish is that it is difficult to get the dough rolled out large enough for a decent sized pie.  Otherwise, it was great.

Not a fan, flavor is good but  the putting them together  was a huge hassle, I would not do this again.  Might adapt the recipe into a regular pot pie.  The filling was simple and tasty.

I added sour cream instead of cream of chicken soup, then put in long grain & wild rice with it.  The taste made up for the fact that I couldn't get the dough to work for me.......

These are great but just make sure to really stretch out the biscuit dough, or whatever you are using to put the filling in,  so you are getting enough filling in.

I liked this recipe. I made half the recipe and ended up with technically 18 hand pies. It was a mistake of mine as I let the biscuit dough out of the fridge for too long. However, as I made the hand pies I figured out the issue many people complain about: putting in the proper amount of filling. My advise is simple: Use about a teaspoon per biscuit. You will be able to close each pie without trouble. Also, sprinkle some flour to a rolling pin and the surface where you will roll the biscuits. This will also help you to figure out how big of a circle you will have to roll the biscuit to have no issues at the time of sealing the hand pie. My only problem was with the baking time. Next time I will just bake them for about 20 minutes or as soon as I see them getting golden I might just leave them 5 more minutes and will take them out of the oven. Mine came out too browned using the lower baking time and a light colored baking sheet. For some reason my oven burned the pies a bit despite the thermometer reading of 350F.

Great recipe to do with the young chefs in your family. Not only was it fun, it was delicious.   Easy to assembly and everybody loved them.  We will most certainly have these again. I sprinkled a small amt. of everything bagel spice on the crust.  Feel free to try your favorite spices.

This is such a cool idea but they were a let down. 30 minutes was waaaaaaaay too long to bake and they were too brown, and also bland. As written (with chef’s approved change of using fresh chicken) they were inedible. I made the second batch with a butter/egg/garlic wash on the outside prior to baking for 15-20 minutes and that helped a little. Also helpful is having the filling chilled when assembling. Helped them look neater and hold more filling. They were still bland, but they were at least edible and appeared more appetizing  this way.

The filling was ok but I wont be making this again simply because it was more time consuming than just making the real deal. I only mage it because I liked the idea but with no children in my home it isnt a recipe I will do just for the fun.
