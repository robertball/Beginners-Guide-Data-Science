Do not make this if you are alone.  Unless what you really want for Christmas is a butt like a polar bear.  This is so good!  Had to update this review:  I took this to a recipe swap and several of the ladies used it as a creamer for their coffee. I'm not a coffee drinker and didn't try it, but they raved about it.

I really like this recipe! My husband couldn't tell the difference between this and eggnog. It is extremely quick and easy. I have to fully agree with the author's statement...in this particular recipe it is imperative that you only use FRESH grated nutmeg. I had just purchased whole nutmeg from Penzey's spices (yum) and it was excellent. This is a keeper for sure.

I have to say this is very good. Taste just like eggnog but without egg. There is a slight hint of apple from the cider ... just enough to add some spice. The nutmeg is a must (I did not use fresh) as this brings it all together. I used half the sugar called for and for half of that I used dark brown sugar.

This was pretty good. It tasted similar to eggnog, but I think I like this more. The only things I really didn't like were the big chunks of grated nutmeg and the high calorie content:) A nice holiday drink nonetheless.

Oh my gosh. This was soooooo good!  They're right, it's addictive.  I hesitated making it because of all the cream, but after I tasted it, I couldn't have cared less what the calorie count was.  Way better than egg nog, I can't wait for Christmas to make more!

This was very good. Tastes like a melted milkshake with nutmeg. It was too sweet for me so I added another cup of milk and cut back the sugar by 1/4 Cup.

Very delicious! I've made it with just milk and it still tastes good (though not as creamy). Remember to use chilled apple cider, because hot will curdle the milk-yucky!

WOW. I may never buy eggnog again although I think the eggs were the only thing remotely good for you in eggnog and this doesn't have any! Definitely an indulgence! Not quite the same texture as eggnog but still very good. I whipped up a half batch of this in about 2 minutes, I put all the ingredients in a quart size drinking bottloe and just shook it up until the sugar dissolved. First 5 star rating from me on AllRecipes!

This recipe is great for those who do not care for egg nog. It almost tasted like banana. It was, however, way too sweet. Next time I would cut the sugar in half and add a little bit more apple cider. The heavy cream and sugar really over power any good that comes along with this recipe. But with some tweaking it could be great.

I'm not a big nutmeg fan. I used fresh nutmeg but reduced it to 1 tsp. It was delicious.

I will definitely make this 1 million times before stopping! I lightly dusted the top with cinnamon and used powdered nutmeg instead.Great recipe!;)

Was too sweet for me, would add much less sugar next time.
