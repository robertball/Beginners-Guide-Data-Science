Super simple and tasty recipe!  We were getting sick of leftover Thanksgiving turkey, so I substituted that for the rotisserie chicken.  I also added two chopped carrots and stalks of celery that I had on hand. Next time I’d probably add in some chicken bouillon or seasoning salt as the broth by itself was fairly bland (though I’m sure the seasoning on a rotisserie chicken would also help enhance the flavor compared to the turkey I utilized). 
Will definitely be making again.

Loved this soup the first time I made it and just made it again. I bought a larger bag of tortellini, so I multiplied the recipe to make a big pot and freeze some into smaller batches. It's a great base recipe too - you could easily add or sub lots of other fresh garden veggies like carrots, zucchini, and okra.

It was good but I think it needed a little more onion and garlic

I omitted the celery and added a small jar of sun ripened tomato pesto to the recipe. Also added about 2 cups, give or take, of water since the pesto thickened it up a bit. I finished with some half and half to make it creamy and sprinkled with parmesan cheese. Will make again soon.

This recipe was a home run!  I made this for dinner tonight.  The tortellini package that I bought was 10 oz. though and not 8 oz. as the recipe suggested.  The only additions I made were to add 2 sliced carrots, and some chicken boullion because we like our broth to taste a little richer than basic canned broth. I also needed to add an extra can of broth, probably because of the carrots that I added, and the extra 2 oz. of tortellini in the package I bought.   We will be adding this delicious soup to our winter rotation, for sure!  Thank you for sharing!
