A wonderful noodle recipe!  Adding the baking powder makes for a delicious buttery noodle.  Made these with my young grandchildren who loved getting their hands on the dough. We did use a pasta machine to roll them out and made two sizes of noodles.  One thin and one nice and thick.  This dough is so easy to work with!  They were dried on a clothes rack set up in the kitchen.
They went into a a wonderful turkey broth using up the last of the Thanksgiving turkey.  TRY THIS RECIPE!  It will not disappoint! 






 Made these with my young grandchildren who loved getting their hands on the dough.  We used leftover turkey from Thanksgiving, with chicken broth, carrots,celery, and onions.  We did use a pasta machine to roll the dough out and made two kinds of noodles.  One thin, and one thick and plump.  This dough is so easy to work with.  Noodles were hung on a folding clothes rack to dry.  What a wonderful filling meal they made.

I made these very easy noodles for the first time ever and they are great!  I put them in homemade chicken noodle soup and my husband said it was the best soup he had ever tasted.  These will be made every time I make chicken noodle soup for sure.  Thanks for the recipe!

These noodles are the best in homemade chicken noodle soup. They are very easy to make. I don't let them dry. I just make them up and throw them in. Great noodles!

these noodles were great!  Just like other reviewers said, they were very easy to roll because the dough didn't snap back when rolled out.  I rolled them out very thin and put them in chicken noodle soup.  Very, very tasty.  Thank you for the PERFECT noodle recipe!

Ditto to previous reviews - they were easy to roll out and tasted great.  This is the first time I have made noodles in years so will try different recipes to compare.  But this one tasted GREAT!

This is the BEST homemade noodle/pasta recipe EVER!!! I've tried many pasta recipes but none of them compare to this one. I mixed the dry ingredients together and put it in the food processor and started mixing as I poured in the wet ingredients. I used half the salt and added lemon pepper seasoning. (The food processor takes the work out of making the dough!)  I let the dough sit for about 20 minutes then rolled it out. WOW! It rolls beautifully and I could get it quite thin. I loved that it didn't stick together and that it was so easy to handle. This makes very light noodles and the texture was wonderful and didn't turn soggy when boiled.  This will be my base recipe for all my homemade pastas from now on!!!! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!!!

Like all of the other reviewers...I agree these are fantastic.  I followed the recipe exactly making beef & noodles.  They were excellent.  My long-time recipe for noodles is now in the trash.  These were tender & yummy.  It was a real surprise that they were so much easier than any noodles I have ever made.  I really liked that the dough was so easy to work with.  When I hung them up on clothes hangers to dry I kept expecting them to fall apart & was sure I would go back to find them all broken and laying on my countertop.  Well, that didn't happen.  So, like I said, I will be using this recipe from now on and will be passing it on as this Grandma's "favorite" to my granddaughters.  Thanks for the great recipe!!! mj
This is my second review of this recipe.  I made these wonderful noodles again today and I added 1/2 tsp. of tumeric to the eggs, blended them with a fork before adding the butter and dry ingredients.  This makes the noodles nice and yellow and there's no taste of the tumeric.  I also add tumeric to egg yolks when I'm making deviled eggs making them nice and yellow.  This is a great alternative to yellow food coloring.

These were very good, I used half whole wheat flour and half all purpose but that's the only change. I thought when I was rolling out the dough that I had it really thin but when it came time too cook them it was clear that they could have been thinner - but it's well worth trying these again - practice makes perfect lol

perfection.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I made this for "10 servings" size (i luv how the calculate button adjusts the indredient amounts).  Used the noodles for my "Rich and Creamy Beef Stroganoff by SanFranCook".  Note: when I divided the dough into thirds, I then seasoned each (1 with Paprika, 1 with sweet basil, the 3rd with cardimon seeds)... then I ended up with 3 different flavored noodles for my stroganoff.... sensational!

These are the best noddles I've ever eaten.  So easy to make.  They freeze well too.  I'll never buy store bought noodles again.

I made these yesterday and oh my goodness, they not only are fantastic but also so easy to make. The dough is delightful to work with unlike others I have tried. I used a noodle cutter rather than rolling the dough to cut and the noodles separate so easily. I cooked them about 20 to 30 minutes and the noodles are so tender they literally "melt in your mouth." Love making them so much that I have another batch drying now to put in the freezer for later use. I cannot praise this recipe enough and thank you for posting it. I will only use this recipe from now on!

I make noodles a lot and these were the easiest ever to roll out.  I have never added melted butter to my noodles before.  The only thing I would do differently next time is not to let the dough dry for more than 15 minutes because the one sheet that dried the longest cracked and fell apart when I cut them, but otherwise great noodle recipe.

This is sooooo good. I have made the noodles two times and turned out great both times. I mix the dough in my food processor and it turns out fine each time. My husband and I both thought is had to much salt so I only put in 1/2 of the salt the second time. I will make this again and again.

I've tried several different noodles recipes, they turned out pretty good, but I was always turned away by how much time I had to spend rolling them out (only to have them continue to spring back.)  THIS RECIPE is my favorite by far!!! The noodles were tasty, had good texture, weren't too tough or chewy.  And the best part about these were how wonderful the dough was, it reminded me of the way sugar cookie dough feels and acts.  It was soft, managable and rolling it out took seconds!  This will be the only noodle recipe I will use.

I have made other noodles but these are a keeper.  I don't even dry them, though.  Cut them and in the pot they go for dinner.  I also add other spices to the dough to add some flavor.  I like to add garlic powder, onion powder, parsley, and poultry seasoning (depending on what they are going to go with).  I have made them several times and they have turned out great.

Because I'm on a low-sodium diet, I used sodium-free baking powder.  The noodles remind me of what my mom used to make in the 1940's. Thanks for the great recipe.

Cut the recipe in half and didn't dry them...just threw them into the chicken noodle soup. I didn't have any butter, so used margarine. The flavor was fantastic!  I love the flavor the margarine adds, and I can only imagine how awesome they will be with butter!

This recipe is amazing!  One of the very best I've tried at all recipes.  The whole family loved these noodles.  They have so much flavor.  I rolled them out as thin as possible, and then cut them in to strips.  Then boiled them in water with sea salt.  Everyone helped themselves to the noodles and poured home made chicken soup and veggies in their bowls. The leftover noodles were kept seperate from the broth, just covered them in seran wrap in the fridge and they tasted just as yummy the next day--and still al dente.  A huge keeper!  I am going to make a big batch now to store in the freezer!

I've been making this recipe for about 3 years now. I tried a few others on this site, but this was the easiest to work with and really good. My husband also said it was the closest to the great noodles one of his aunt's made. I use it for chicken and noodles. 

I also like to double the recipe for a about 2 lbs of noodles. I let them dry and then freeze them. To freeze them I layer them on baking sheets covered with waxed paper and freeze overnight. I then place into a large plastic zipper bag. It's great to have extra on hand for last minute chicken soups.

Thank you, thank you, thank you! Awesome noodle recipe. The flavor of these noodles is phenomenal. And, if that's not enough, I have never worked with a dough that was soooo easy to work with and roll really thin. My homemade noodles are usually a little too thick for my taste but I could get these rolled out very thin. Thank you so much sharing such an awesome recipe!

These noodles are fantastic!  I substitute garlic salt for the salt in the recipe and it is excellent.  I use them in chicken noodle soup, for beef and noodles, or by themselves with a little butter.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Also - i made ravioli with it and it was amazing.

This was my first attempt at making noodles and this was the recipe I was hoping for.  They were easy to make and a breeze to roll out.  The flavor was great and reminded of the noodles of my youth.  I look forward to making these again.

Loved this recipe and it will be my go to noodle recipe now.   Loved that the noodles didn't shrink back when rolling out and they didn't stick together after cutting either. Cooked up so tender as well.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!

Increased to 12 servings to make 7 lasagna noodles. Worked perfect! Used noodles for "Lasagna Alfredo" and it tasted awesome!

The BEST noodles EVER!!! Seriously! The butter makes it absolutely rich and savory. I used whole wheat flour and had to add a little milk because of that, but still amazing!

The most delicious noodles I have made, HOWEVER.... I put them in chicken soup and they were perfect the first night.  The next night we had left over soup and the noodles disintegrated!  They melted away!  I suppose they're not meant for soup???  Does anybody have any ideas?  Thx!

Yum - I made a double batch today for chicken noodle soup.  I used half whole wheat flour and half white flour and two eggs and 1/4 cup water instead of 4 eggs because I'm not fond of the super eggy flavor of egg noodles.  These were the best I've ever made.  They held together nicely, were tender but not soggy, and my husband couldn't believe they were homemade.  I'm not sure if that was a compliment or not, but I thought they were fabulous.

I made noodles like this in school and my boyfriend asked me to make homemade noodles the other day so I found this recipe. It's great! He was eating them while they were drying and ate almost the entire batch in one sitting! Now he asks me to make them almost daily!

This dough is really nice to work with and rolls out easily.  The noodles are delicate and taste great, even as leftovers.  I didn't realize I was out of butter so I had to sub margerine, but I'm looking forward to trying with butter soon.

I made these noodles one day and the next day I boiled chicken, cooked some onions & celery in a little butter and then put this into the chicken broth and added half a bag of frozen mixed veggie.  Once the veggies were cooked, I added the noodles to the boiling water and after they were  tender, I added one can of cream of chicken soup & one package of philly cheese.  This was a hit for sure - but it was the noodles that made it "great". I added salt, pepper and some poultry seasoning and just a little Tony's Cajun spice. Noodles take a  while to dry but are worth the wait.  I will be making them again and again.

Awesome, easy to make recipe.  This was my first attempt at making noddles by myself, the last time was with my grandmother almost 25 years ago!  One note - don't use Kosher salt.  Not a huge problem, but I had to think about what those flakes were in the noddles while they were drying :)

My boyfriend got me the pasta roller, fettuccine, and spaghetti cutter attachments for my Kitchen Aid stand mixer, I have been wanting them for a long time and have never made pasta before.  I chose this for my first recipe because it was rated so highly.  I used my blade attachment to mix the ingredients together and then used the roller to roll the pasta out (used 4th setting for egg noodles).  I added a 1/2 tsp of dried basil to the dough but otherwise made as directed.  These were so tasty for my first attempt at making pasta (there was a bit of a learning curve on how to roll out the dough using the attachment!!!).  My boyfriend and I ate the entire pot of pasta in one meal.  Definitely will make again.

Made just as called for. Delish! Did need to cook a bit longer than it called for, but that may have been because mine were not as thin maybe.

This is the BEST homemade noodle/pasta recipe EVER!!! I've tried many pasta recipes but none of them compare to this one. I mixed the dry ingredients together and put it in the food processor and started mixing as I poured in the wet ingredients. I used half the salt and added lemon pepper seasoning. (The food processor takes the work out of making the dough!) I let the dough sit for about 20 minutes then rolled it out. WOW! It rolls beautifully and I could get it quite thin. I loved that it didn't stick together and that it was so easy to handle. This makes very light noodles and the texture was wonderful and didn't turn soggy when boiled. This will be my base recipe for all my homemade pastas from now on!!!! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!!!

These were the best noodles that I have ever made. Unless another noodle recipe beats it, it's Queen of the Hill and my go-to noodle recipe. I do wish that I could give it more than 5 stars. 

I followed the recipe as written, and the dough was lovely to work with. I did a 10-minute knead and really liked the smoothness, texture and flavor of the cooked noodles. They were just as good, if not better than anything I could buy at the store. I usually add more baking powder and was tempted, but I resisted. 

I'm going to make them next weekend when I have company, and may need to make a double batch. Thank you Momofaddy for posting it. 

If you want to try making noodles, or already make them, I can highly recommend that you try "Grandma's Butter Noodles."

Nothing is better than chicken and homemade noodles. This recipe is great! I serve mine like my mother did, with mashed potatoes, corn, and cole slaw. I like to mix the corn in with the mashes and noodles.

These were great. So easy to roll out.  I had never made homemade noodles before.  They were a hit.  Will do again and look forward to making flavored noodles as others have written.  What a huge difference from box noodles. I needed to double the recipe for 6 adults.

Easy and delicious, used in chicken noodle soup made with leftover rotisserie chicken. I didn't allow drying time and I think they turned out just fine. I used lots of flour when rolling and cutting.

Wanting to try whole wheat? This is the easiest fastest roll-on-the-counter whole wheat dough ever, mixing & rolling thin in no time. (If you have the space, sprinkle the dough w/flour every time you turn it over while rolling; move to the next bit of dough while you let that dough sit on the counter; later, cut the noodles using a pizza cutter; use a cookie sheet to keep cuts straight'sh). I finally read all the reviews after making these & noted that someone else who used WW added milk. Since I'm moving away from animal products a bit, I noted another poster mentioning olive oil. I'll try those changes. If neither works for us I'll still love this recipe. Another poster mentioned cutting the salt. Agreed. My daughter rolled some of this dough in our pasta maker. Her efforts worked wonderfully as well. At least without adding milk, the whole wheat made these noodles more grainy then other whole wheat noodles I've made. HOWEVER, what I love, love, love about this recipe is that this dough does handle well FAST. Better yet, it left my youngest son not wanting any more WHEN THE NOODLES WERE GONE, even though a little soup was left (okay, he's spoiled *sigh*). To me, these noodles were almost more like having whole wheat crackers (a more grainy texture than noodles) but then, at least in chicken soup, I didn't miss regular noodles or crackers at all. These were simple, quick, and yummy.  Thanks so much for the recipe!!!

So very easy to make and even the picky toddlers wanted seconds. I will never buy store brands as this was easy and well recieved by my family. I made for stroganoff and plan on making today for chicken soup.

I used the Popeil pasta maker and had to add 1 1/4 cups of flour when doubling this recipe. When just doing according to this recipe I need to up the flour to 2 cups and add a tablespoon of warm water. Thanks!

Wonderful noodles, exactly what I was looking for.  I made them exactly as written and they do roll out beautifully.  I haven't made noodles for years so had forgotten what went in them.  The butter was a brilliant idea.  My husband doesn't much care for noodles and he loved these!  Thanks for sharing your Mother-in-law's recipe.

Instead of using the 2 tsp of salt, I used 2 tsp of chicken boullion crystals and a touch of garlic powder. Gave the noodles a good rich flavor along with the chicken broth. YUM! LOVED this recipe-much easier than the one I've made for years! I also used just a little yellow food coloring just to enhance the color of the noodles...

Don't cook for 7 minutes. Bad idea. Too much dusting on the work surface can be trouble also. I use a sifter with about 80% of the bottom covered in masking tape. Despite the old wives tales, salt your noodles while cooking. 

What makes this recipe work is the baking powder. And this recipe works much better with a pasta roller. Also the high egg content makes this pasta good for soup. 

Don't even attempt to dry these noodles for later use. Wrong recipe. 

Four stars due to the over the top cook time.

I made this recipe exactly as described to use in our chicken noodle soup. I just boiled up a test batch, and they taste like boiled eggs! Nasty for soup. I'm going to try to tweak it and get rid of the eggy taste.

I would have given more stars if it were possible.  These noodles are far superior to other noodle recipes I've tried.........sooooo tender but hold their shape when cooking.  Yummmmm.  Good with beef tips or veggies and chicken!  Definitely a keeper.

very good. I have made this quite a few times and everyone loves it! Hard to go back to boxed pastas. The buttery taste works well with a red sauce but not so much with an alfredo. I use my bread maker to mix it while I prepare the rest of dinner and it fits this recipe doubled (8 servings). I haven't tried letting it dry out a bit and rolling and cutting. I guess I've always done it the hard way and cut it all without rolling it. I used a pasta wheel for a fancy edge just bc it was easier than a pizza cutter and mine has two blades.

A fairly simple recipe. 
I added another tablespoon of butter and a tablespoon of garlic powder. In addition, I added about a half cup of chicken stock. No baking powder so I skipped it.

Due to these additions, to make the dough form, I added about a half cup of flour as I was incorporating the ingredients.

When the dough seemed right I kneaded it out to about 10 x 14, then rolled it to about 14 x 22 to get it to 1/16" thick. let it stand for 15 minutes, cut into strips with a pizza cutter and let it stand 15 more minutes. Then I cut the strips in thirds so the noodles were around 6 inches. with a thin, sharp knife I sliced them off my butcher's block and turned them over. I turned the heat up on my stock and gathered the noodles with my fingers and scattered them on the surface. When the stock was hot I loosely gathered the noodles a dropped a handful at a time into the stock.

Next time I will add a pinch of cinnamon.

Very pleased with the results. My wife said they were the best I have made.

I love these rich, chewy, buttery noodles. Sometimes I’ll use leftover garlic butter to give a garlicky flavor. They are pretty as well. A big thumbs up!!  Thanks for sharing a family recipe!!

I could have sworn that I left a review of this recipe a long while ago, but guess not. When I was a girl my grandmother would visit from out of state and spend a day making noodles just like these. Back then you could buy a "stewing hen" and she would cook that old chicken for hours to make a thick broth in which to cook the noodles. Since my mother didn't make them, I always thought they must be so difficult that only my grandmother could do it. Well, not so. I love the texture of home made noodles and this recipe is so evocative of my childhood. Here's a hint for cutting them to size; a pizza cutter is ideal.
