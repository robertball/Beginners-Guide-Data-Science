This is exactly what I was looking for: corkscrew noodles, cream soup, staple ingredients. I did substitute peas and mushrooms. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I thought it didn't have enough sauce as written. So I made 1/2 a recipe more of the sauce: 1/2 can soup, 2 T milk, 2 T sour cream, 1 T parmesan. Thanks for the great recipe!

A bit bland as written. I sauteed 1 tbsp of minced garlic with the onion, and added 2 tbsp of Italian seasoning and 1 tbsp of garlic salt to the sauce mixture, as well as a few more shakes of Parmesan cheese on top of the pasta when it was served. Wish I had made more of the sauce, it got a little lost in the pasta.

Quick, easy and delicious. I like that the ingredients are all common kitchen staples. I omitted the carrot because I didn't have any, and I added some seasoned salt and salt to give it some extra taste. I also used whole-wheat pasta and non-fat plain yogurt to make it a healthier choice. Husband loved it too.

Added the 2 cloves garlic and mushrooms as suggested by Melissious, and also added a little Italian Seasoning. Since my family watches carbs I served this with baked spaghetti squash instead of pasta, they loved it!

This recipe is very bland and my family didn't like it without the condiments piled on. It has the makings of a good recipe, but it is still missing something.
