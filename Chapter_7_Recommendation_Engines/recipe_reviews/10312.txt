these were so hearty and good. I cut the recipe in half and made smaller cookies i got about 28 and cooked them for 15 minutes. These are perfect for hiking or just snacking. The second time i made them i also did half applesauce and half butter and used all whole wheat flour. They still came out amazing.

OH...YUM!!! These are BY FAR the best "health" / "trail mix" cookie I have tasted. I have been searching a long time for a recipe that will make me never want to buy bars again and this one has blown me away. I couldn't stop eating the dough haha! I used all spelt flour (LOVE the taste of it and it's so healthy!) and only half the amount of molasses because I ran out. The flavors are so complimentary to eachother. I tried lots of add-ins like chocolate chips craisins walnuts pecans golden raisins... YUM! Also to 1/4 of the batch I added 1 small banana with walnuts. MMMM it tastes like REALLY GOOD flavorful banana bread!!! Thanks so much for a recipe that will be a forever favorite:)

These are very dense - but delicious - cookies. I've made them several times and recently used mini-kisses instead of chocolate chips for a more intense chocolate flavor. I've also used crunchy peanut butter rather than smooth both milk and semi-sweet chocolate. They're very easy to modify and still taste great!

I used all whole wheat flour cut the chocolate chips down to 1/4 cup (to save calories) and used 1/2 banana instead of applesauce (since I didn't have applesauce). YUM! Tasted like a little banana bread cookie. Be sure to flatten them--otherwise they stay little balls when they cook.

These are fantastic cookies! We've actually dubbed them "muffies" here at home because they are somewhere between a muffin and a cookie as far as heartiness goes. With a banana and a glass of O.J. they make a great quick breakfast. I cut the butter down to 2/3 cup and added some cocoa to the batter but otherwise baked them as written. Love them!

These are great! You can change them to your liking and they still turn out fine. I always do something different usually using organic crunchy pb unsweetened carob chips mix in some ground flax only 3/4 cup sugar and 1/2 cup butter 1/2 cup applesauce. These are excellent for breakfast or on a hike!

I also substituted 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 butter and used crunchy pb. I used 1/8 cup to drop the cookies instead of 1/4 cup. I might try half the sugar or maybe 3/4 the amount. The cookies are NOT too sweet I would just be interested to see what I could get away with to cut back the sugar. These cookie are my new FAVORITE!!

These were good especially for being a healthy cookie:) I didn't have raisins or walnuts so I left them out. Like a lot of others I reduced the sugar and replaced 1/2 of the butter with unsweetened applesauce. I made the cookies smaller than called for (that way I can eat more of them!). Also just as a note I only had blackstrap molasses - the flavor was very strong in these. If I use the blackstrap again I would probably reduce it to 1/2. I would imagine that other types of molasses would work better for this recipe as it covered up the other flavors and what's the good of adding all those yummy ingredients if you can't taste them?!

This is a good recipe. They are on the more on the sweet side than what I was looking for but that is no fault of the recipe. Definitely more of a cookie vibe here so it was very popular with the kids!

love these cookies I subbed honey for the molasses. Not too sweet soft chewy just the way we like them. I froze half of the dough for use later will post an update and let others know if the dough cooked well after being frozen UPDATE: took out frozen dough yesterday thawed first and baked with same wonderful results

I wanted to make these without refined sugar so I ended up altering the recipe quite a bit. The result was a scrumptious soft cookie. 1 cup unsalted butter 1/2 cup honey 1/2 cup pure maple syrup 1/3 cup molasses 12/2 cup crunchy peanut butter 2 eggs 1 1/2 tsp vanilla 2 cups whole wheat flour 1 cup toasted wheat germ 1 1/2 tsp baking soda 1/2 tsp salt 1/2 tsp cinnamon 2 cups rolled oats 1 cup raisins 3/4 cup no-sugar carob chips 1 cup chopped pecans

I just made your recipe for the first time and the recipe called for 1 cup of raisins. I changed that to 1/2 cup raisins and 1/2 cup dried cranberries. I added a full teaspoon of cinnamon but left everything else as written. They came out very good. Thank you Thea.

I tried to make them into bars but they came out kind of dry. I think that I ll used applesauce and 1 cup of rolled oats to help keep them moist. Still very good flavor and texture reminds me of my nana.

I've made these 3-4 times now and they are excellent! I substitute 1/2 the butter for applesauce. I leave out 1/2 cup of brown sugar and I also skip the walnuts and raisins - personal preference. I put in just a handful of chocolate chips. I don't flatten them and I cook them on the light side. Sooooo yummy!!

These cookies did give a lot of energy:) It was my first time making a healthier cookie with whole wheat flour and wheat germ and I was impressed. I will surely make these again sometime. Thanks!

My kids love these and I'm glad to have a healthy cookie for their lunch snack. I followed the recipe exactly and made cookies. I also tried them in mini-muffin cups to simulate "Aussie bites" a treat we buy at Costco. These are just as good and way cheaper. Next time I will probably decrease the brown sugar as they are quite sweet.

I started a tradition of making these for every tournamount this season. It was alot of fun! For one important tournamount I could not attend I attached a little note of encouragement to every cookie and the girls realy appreciated it. Thanks! Also I never refrigerated for an hour ahead of time... I just changed the temp to 330 and cooking time to 14 minutes and they tasted the same-- delicious! I also made smaller cookies if that effects it.

I think these might possibly be the best cookies I have ever made! I cut half the butter with applesauce and nixed the walnuts to lower the calorie content. However to half the batch I added dried cranberries and slivered almonds. Fantastic and especially good as a breakfast cookie!

Delicious if you like oatmeal raisin cookies. I read the reviews but decided not to change a thing just to try the recipe as it was intended. The brown sugar is way way too much. That is all I can taste defenantly do away with it unless you want to eat oatmeal raisin cookiies and ther are much easier recipes for oatmeal rasin cookies. Next time I will use all whole weat cut the sugar in half and leave out raisins and add more nutty items like sunflower seeds etc. by the way hubby loves them. He would give them 5 stars. I only give them three because I expected to taste more than sugar.

I added a dollop of yogurt for moistness because I cut the butter to 1/2 cup as suggested and added 1/2 cup of applesace. Although i love nuts the prices for them are so high right now so I used 1/2 cup nuts and 1/2 of sunflower seeds. I gave the oats a quick toast as well. I used dark chocolate chips as a healthier choice. Makes a great on-the-run breakfast instead of expensive breakfast bars!

Very good with the modifications suggested (replace half the butter with applesauce). I didn't have walnuts so I used pecans. I also threw in some flax seeds. They have a very strong molasses flavor even without using blackstrap. Also - make sure that you make them large enough. I made smaller ones and they were very dry and not so good. The larger ones retain their moisture much better. I used a good 1/4 cup measure. I will make these again and experiment with all applesauce and honey instead of molasses. They are healthy for you with modifications but with chocolate chips they are also a treat! I'm making them again today.

I don't use my oven in the summertime if I can avoid it because it heats up my whole house to the point where it's cooler outside! But I love to bake and when the cold weather finally arrives this cookie recipe is one of my favorite things to make! I don't feel as guilty making/eating these cookies because of the wheat germ molasses oats raisins and whole wheat flour. Just wish I had come across this recipe when my kids were younger as I baked a lot of cookies in the 1980s-1990s! But I have shared this recipe with them.

These are also really good as mini muffins... perfect for what I was looking for... a healthier snack for my kids than a handful of cereal or crackers. They're 2 3 and 7 and they love these! I also really like the texture. Also these seem to taste better "the next day" than fresh made... When they first come out they seem to have a "healthy" taste to them... I used almonds and cranberries for the walnuts and raisins.

These cookies are fantastic! I was afraid they would be too "healthy tasting" for my husband but he LOVED them. So does my toddler (not that that's saying much) and I don't feel guilty letting him have two because they aren't so bad for you. I made the cookies about half the size though and cut the cooking time a little. These will be a regular in my house.

These are ridiculously good! I had my doubts...I mean wheat germ and molasses? I've tried many "healthy" recipes that incorporate those types of things and eatting them was almost a chore. But these were incredible. I also replaced 1/2 butter with applesauce (as many other reviewers). I also added cranberries with the raisins...fabulous with cranberries. I've set them out for breakfast treat...they are really filling (with some wholesome ingredients) and will be a easy to grab on our way out the door. Thanks for posting!!

An excellent everyday sort of cookie! I really liked the mix of flours and wheat germ - it give the cookie just the right kind of heartiness. I added some sesame seeds for an earthier flavour but everything else about the recipe was just right.

Wow! I wasn't sure about these at all. I thought there was way too much dry ingredients to go w/ the amount of fat & liquid but they came out beautiful. I followed the recipe pretty closely except subbed crunchy peanut butter and left out the raisins and walnuts. These will make a great cheaper alternative to granola bars. Thanks!

I love how many healthy ingredients are crammed into this recipe - while it's not low in fat it's high in nutrition and that's what I really care about in a recipe. Makes a huge batch but they taste so great (and keep well) that dh and I won't have any trouble finishing them ourselves.

Oh man... these are fantastic! I'll keep making them just because they're delicious never mind healthy:) I subbed applesauce for half the butter like folks said and the PB as well (I don't like it). Two other changes - I used equal parts 7 grain mix wheat bran and white flour - just because it was all I had but yum! Also added cranberries and almonds and I think that really worked... Oh these are so good! I'm going to try making these again with different kinds of grain - maybe buckwheat? Thanks so much!

THis is a WONDERFUL cookie recipe! My neighbor made them and I had to add them to my recipe box. They are healthy delicious and kids love them. Best of all you can add whatever sounds good to you. Often I will throw in mashed bannanas applesauce and decrease the oil honey and decrease the brown sugar shredded apples and all wholewheat flour instead of half white. They are wonderfully soft and moist. I baked them for 14 minutes. Your family will thank you for making these cookies!

So far my family loves these cookies. I added sunflower seeds coconut and milled flax seeds. Next time I'm going to omit the molasses because for me that ingredient only suits gingerbread cookies. Other than that they are great.

Loved them! It was fun deciding what to put in the dough--I used dates and less chocolate chips and used blackstrap molasses. The molasses was a little rich for me might cut back on that for next time. They are so dense and hearty excellent for this time of year!

These are great cookies - like another reviewer said the thicker ones do have a bit of a "muffin texture." I didn't change much but did not use whole wheat flour (didn't have it) and used a mix of raisins and cranberries. My one complaint would be that on day two they already seem a little hard but that may be because I hadn't stored them as tightly as I could have. Great recipe!

Awesome cookies! My fiance was getting half his calories from Oreos. I found this recipe while looking for a healthier alternative. These are perfect. They have a lot of nutrition but still taste good - to both of us! I dislike most cookies because of the post-sugar yuckiness I feel in my mouth after eating refined sweets. These are great and versatile - you can use different nuts and dried fruit. Although some kids may not like them because they're not terribly sweet my 4 year old adores them. And I don't mind giving them to him! Since they're more nutritious than many breakfast cereals or bars I'll give him one of these cookies for breakfast on occasion and he thinks he's getting a very special treat! which he is:) Thanks for this recipe!

Honestly these cookie are a lot better than I thought they would be. They have a lot of flavor and they are good for you. I only used 1/3 cup of white flour and wheat flour for the rest. I didn't have any walnuts and only used 1/2 the amount of chocolate chips and these were still very good. My kids loved them and I don't feel so bad about giving them a cookie.

These are great the way they are but I didn't like the fat content so I tweaked them this way. Cut the butter to 1/2 cup cut the brown sugar to 1 cup increased the peanut butter to 1/2 cup (I like chunky) added 1 cup of ground flax seed 2 scoops of chocolate protein powder 2 bananas 1 cup of applesauce and increased the raisins and choc chips to 1 1/2 cups. I also use slivered almonds instead of walnuts (personal taste). They cooked up a bit darker but are chock ful of goodness!

I'm not sure how on Gods green earth these turned out as I only put 3/4 cup butter a spoonful of applesauce 1 cup dark brwon sugar few huge scoops of peanut butter no raisins double carob chips and I never toasted the wheat germ. Next time I think I will add more peanut butter and try some banana's and skip the molasses altogether.I cooked mine 12 min and they were plenty done and used a ice cream scoop to make my mounds. My daughter thought these were "good kiki's mama" As always thanks for sharing.

I have made this cookie many times and made some changes and it has turned out great each time. I have subbed 1 cup of ground flax for the cup of flour and added an additional 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. Since I dislike raisins and nuts I added craisins and chopped apricots and it really added a lot of flavor. If you don't like molasses use honey. It's milder and just as dense. This cookie is very versatile and can withstand all kinds of changes. Enjoy!

Even those these are "healthy" cookies they are sooo delicious!! I adhered to the recipe except left out the nuts because family are not nut fans. So I don't think I would change a thing next time! This is my first review but I knew I would make these again and again so just had to let others know how good they were. They are so moist even with all the fiber rich ingredients! Its great to feel good about giving your kids healthy cookies(and yourself too!) Give them a try!!

Wow! These are delicious! The batch I made turned out a whopping 35 (medium sized) cookies and between all of them I used only 1 C. of brown sugar (and one packet of stevia). I used 1 C. of whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup of millet (ground in coffee grinder). I used sunflower seed butter instead of peanut butter. I also ground up half of the oatmeal (my 2 and 3 year old like them less lumpy) and used a cup of dark chocolate chips. I also left out the raisens and used a cup and a half of finely chopped walnuts. Substitute half of the butter with applesauce. These are the only "healthy" cookie recipe my kids will eat. LOVE THEM!

healty and good! I used 1/2 cup less brown sugar and replaced with stevia one dropper full. I made four cookies for us and the rest rolled and put in the freezer for fresh baked healty goodness over the next few months! Oh and left out fruit because we were out but next time I think I'll add chopped apples. Yum!

The family liked these. I think the molasses added a different cookie taste. I made the smaller size 1/8 cup of dough each which made 47 total. Watch carefully hard to tell if they burn because of the dark color.

Granddaughter and I made these for annual hike with grandpa and family. They seemed to really enjoy them. They are pretty healthy and good tasting as well. We used a cup of granola cereal instead of the wheat germ as I didn't have any wheat germ and they turned out great. I think you could substitute liberally and come out OK.

I have been making these for years for my athletic kids. They are perfect in their lunches especially if they have a game after school. Here are my changes: Instead of 1 cup unsalted butter - I use 1/2 salted butter and 1/2 applesauce. Sometimes I use honey instead of molasses. I substitute 1/2 cup flaxseed meal for the toasted wheat germ. I've added a ripe banana before and creamed it with the wet ingredients. When creaming: first do the butter sugar molasses and peanut butter AND THEN add the applesauce. I don't typically put in raisins or nuts because I have picky eaters. But they LOVE these cookies! I even make extra for their coaches and they are always happy to receive them!

Although these are a very dense cookie they are very good. I cut back on the nuts a bit to my taste but followed the rest of the recipe as is. They are a very filling cookie & have just the perfect amount of sweetness with the chocolate chips.

I halved the recipe and not sure what I did wrong but I had a hard time to put these cookies together. There were too much chips and walnuts(I didn't even put raisins) left and the dough was also falling apart. The cookies are not as dark as in the picture it's soft but not chewy. Not too sweet so it suits my taste.

Of course I had to mess with the recipe a little bit - I used half butter/half applesauce dates instead of raisins 2T soy flour with the AP flour a little coconut not as much chips and walnuts as called for and processed the oats a bit first. My pickiest 3 year-old actually ate 3 of these and he eats nothing that looks out of the ordinary. I took these to a meeting and everyone loved them. I will definitely keep this recipe. I'm always trying to add a little of the healthy stuff in cookie recipes and this combination works very well! Thanks!

We loved this including the kids(age 3 & 6). I did have to make some substitutions & it is well suited for some lightening up using some light margaring/apple sauce & egg beaters - the peanut butter ensures it doesn't get get a styrofoam texture using too many light ingredented. Subbed honey for molasses & fiber 1 cereal for wheat germ based on what I had on hand.

These were so good. I made them exactly according to the recipe with organic walnuts chopped extra fine in a chopper big delicious raisins and grain-sweetened chocolate chips. Oh I think I put a bit less than a cup of brown sugar but nonetheless they were excellent cookies. I took them to my mom's and they were gone within the day. My sisters couldn't stop eating them!:)

I'm pregnant and have been looking for a "good" snack I won't feel guilty about. These were perfect! I used half butter and half applesauce craisins pecans and eliminated the chocolate. My 3 yr old son loves them too! I love how only one cookie will satisfy you unlike most other cookies.

Packed with good things. They tasted good but you can only eat 1 since they are so dense.

Fantastic cookies! Everyone loved them! I substituted 1/2 applesauce for 1/2 the butter as suggested by others and didn't miss the butter at all. Today I'm going to make them with all applesauce and no butter and cranberries instead of raisins. Can't wait! Also love them on the trail!

awesome! i discovered these after my husband asked if i could make "healthy cookies". you can't get much closer than this and still have a great cookie. i made these throughout my pregnancy and they made perfect snacks. i left out the raisins and added more nuts and high quality chocolate chips. i'll be making these forever.

This is the first review I have ever written but I couldn't continue to use this recipe without saying that if is fantastic! We are totally addicted to these cookies. I love to have one when I don't have time for breakfast. The only change I've made is to use pecans instead of walnuts; either way is great! I enjoy sharing this recipe with family and friends.

Very tasty and addictive cookies. If you have a convection oven don't cook them for the amount of time mentioned in the recipe. Lower the temperature or cook for less time. My first batch was a little to hard so the next batch I cooked for less time and they turned out nice and chewy. Also I used pecans instead of walnuts.

I like how thick these are. They are a little dry though. Are good with milk or coffee. Mine only took about 11-12 minutes to cook because my oven always cooks quicker than recipes state anyway.

My husband is not a breakfast eater...but I can get him to take a couple of these "energy cookies" with him in the morning. Eating something is better than nothing. These cookies are great!
