This surely is a delicious holiday pie. Instead of a pinch each cinnamon and nutmeg, I added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. The taste of combined spices and orange rind makes it almost perfect. May add some more cranberries and increase a little bit cooking time, but will definitely bake it again.

My husband adored this pie. Even though I'm not a big cranberry fan, I thought the flavor and texture were exceptional. I did find, however, that I had to bake the pie for much longer than recommended in the recipe--nearly an hour and a half--for the filling to set.

I use this recipe for tarts as opposed to pies (easier to eat) and have taken them to several gatherings, where I have been asked by at least 7 people for the recipe.  Thanks for sharing Sara.

This was a really nice surprise.I didn't expect it to be as good as it was.The only thing I'll change next time is cook for 5 to 10 min longer.

This was a great ending to a special dinner.  The pie tasted like a sweet cranberry bread and had the consistency of a tollhouse cookie pie.  Everyone loved it with whipped cream on top from my two year old to grandpa.

This wasn't quite what I expected, but it's very good.  It's more like a sweet custard pie with a layer of cranberries.  I used two cups of frozen cranberries for a stronger flavor.  This is a great way to use up those cranberries.

My vet and her staff love anything cranberry.  Of everything that I have made them, this is their all time favorite and it's so easy to make.

This was so tasty! I loved the combination of cranberries and orange zest. Yum! I actually made mini-pies out of this (lined muffin tins with pie crust, added pie filling and baked for 35-40 minutes--watch it carefully in the last few minutes), and plan on baking a full size pie this afternoon.  This recipe will be the first one I go to whenever I'm in charge of bringing a pie to something.

I prepared this pie for Christmas dinner. I used a homemade pie crust and followed the recipe with the addition of a few extra cranberries and walnuts. The inside had a consistency to that of pecan pie which wasn't my taste. I feel it drowned out the taste of the cranberries. I cooked it in the oven for over an hour. I didn't get many compliments on the taste of my pie by the guests.  I prefer the taste of a Nantucket Cranberry pie to this. I won't make this again, but thank you for the recipe.

I really enjoyed this recipe and plan on making it again the next time I have an excuse to make a pie.  My pie came out with a nice creamy texture and it was delicious.  I tweaked it a tiny bit for personal preference by cutting the cranberries in half and letting them sit for a while mixed with 1/4 cup of the sugar called for- I think this mellowed the sweet-tart contrast a little without making it bland by any means.  I did only use a bottom crust for mine, and even still it took a bit longer to set than the recipe states. I have a few slices in the freezer for later- they take a while to thaw but are just as good even after storing which is great if you're the only cranberry fanatic in your house like me. Thanks for this recipe, it's a keeper!

I liked the pie I added a bit more cranberry's and it gave it a sour taste i love sour. at first I thought it wasn't going to turn out. Then when it came out of the oven it was so pretty.

My family loved this pie. I used 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I baked it until a toothpick inserted in center came clean. Wonderful!

this recipe made me sad, it looked so good and i thought it was perfect until it cooled and i found out it was still super runny. i ended up throwing the whole thing out because i was worried the egg was still raw. i cooked it 45 minutes and it look like it set up, but it was so runny i couldnt possibly imaging eating it. however it was pretty and smelled great. i would like to try it again but dont know if i will get around to it now that i would have to go back to the store for more ingredients.

I didn't actually taste this but instead baked it and sent it off with my husband on a visit home.  He and my MIL pronounced it "fantastic" saying it travelled well (from VA to MI via car).  They also commented on how well it kept given the last slice was as tasty as the first from almost a week before.  

I used less sugar in the recipe and sprinkled the top (with festive pastry cutouts) with turbinado sugar for crunch.

This pie does require additional baking time...I baked for over an hour (had to cover the whole pie w/ a piece of foil as it was getting too golden). I added extra cinnamon & nutmeg as well as a tsp of pure orange extract. After the pie had baked, I sprinkled it w/ a bit of raw sugar & garnished w/ some frosted cranberries. Loved the sweet/tart aspect...thanks Sara!
