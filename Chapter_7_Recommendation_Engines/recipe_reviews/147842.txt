I'm always very wary about coporate sponsered recipes, but these are excellent! I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose, and therefore doubled the milk. I used only the brown sugar and was plenty sweet. Added some salt. Made plain recipe and put in 1 cup each chocolate chips and chopped pecans. Will absolutely make all the time!

Very good light and crispy cookie. Proof that 'good for you' doesn't have to mean 'sacrifice'. I used whole wheat flour in these as I knew I could use it successfully, having baked many tasty whole grain cookies before. I also used canola oil in place of the margarine,  1/2 cup, as it works better with whole grains in baking. They are fairly sweet so I think the white sugar could be left out. I went with the suggested spice cookie additions and my kids went crazy over these. I made the slices thicker than suggested and baked them on an insulated sheet for thick and chunky cookies.

These are super delicious, I'm very surprised, I watch the video on how to make these, great help. I thought since they were made with with bran cereal they wouldn't be so good , boy was I wrong. the texture is chewy, the taste is delicious. I added  2 cups raisins and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon they taste just like oatmeal raisin cookies, (don't over cookie) these are some of the best home cookies me family and I have ever tasted, the kids also loved them.
