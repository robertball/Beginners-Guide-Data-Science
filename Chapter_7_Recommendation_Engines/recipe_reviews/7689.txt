I made cupcakes and was disappointed.   It was exceptionally dry and doughy.  If I had folded in the egg whites without the additional 1/4 C. milk, I don't believe the batter would have accepted the egg whites without utterly crushing them.  The cake did have a nice rise to it, was a very nice white/ivory color and browned just slightly. The flavor would have been better with almond rather than vanilla as it might have helped mask the odd smell.  Also, I expected a 'marshmallow' flavor, but the only similarity to its name was the light rise of the batter.  Lastly, the directions say to fold the vanilla and the egg whites into the batter.  However, the vanilla separated out from the egg white and, I thought, ruined the integrity of the whites' firm peaks.  
The result is till edible, I suppose, but I won't be bringing these to share anywhere and I won't add the recipe to my permanent rotation.

This is lovely, made as the recipe instructs.  Light, sweet, slightly sponge-y, and will be perfect with fruit.  It is quite sweet, and not everyone will want a sweet frosting on it.

Do NOT add extra milk; it will weigh down the cake and ruin the texture, if not the flavor.

I did sift the flour before measuring, then sifted it again as instructed.  It's an older recipe, and that was how I learned to make cakes as a girl, so it seemed natural.

I will admit that I didn't "fold" in the beaten egg whites.  I whipped them in by hand, and the batter came together beautifully.  I might have been able to use a low setting on my stand mixer to the same effect.

Thank you for sharing!

This was very good, although it tasted like corn bread to me.  Was it supposed to taste like that?  I put fruit dip on top with fruit on the side.  It was delicio!!:]
