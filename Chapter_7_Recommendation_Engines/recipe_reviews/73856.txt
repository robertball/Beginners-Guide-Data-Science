This was very nice! I didn't have any vermouth so I used white wine. I served it over brown rice.

This has a nice flavor. It was easy to make. Ingredients are on hand so that makes it even easier. I didn't have any vermouth. So I used Gin instead. Ended up tasting okay to me.

I followed this recipe to a T with the exception of adding a dash extra Vermouth and it wasn't good at all. The tomatoes were too overpowering. Perhaps using fresh tomatoes would be a better option but even that wouldn't help with the fact that there wasn't much else to the recipe.

I didn't alter this recipe at all except for serving the tomato mixture over pasta instead of rice but it really didn't have much flavor at all. It wasn't bad but this is not something I'll make again
