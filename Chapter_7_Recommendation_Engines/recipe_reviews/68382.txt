excellent recipe - my kids and husband loved it.  I recommend adding garlic and I also doubled the honey.  I covered the baking sheet with foil for half the cooking time and then uncovered for the last half to get the glazing.  I served with rice and broccoli.

We all LOVED LOVED LOVED this meal it was fantastic! Because I was feeling too lazy to chop the onion I THINLY sliced the onion and made a bed of it for the chops to lay on and poured the sauce over the top of it all.Once the chops were cooked I strained the drippings and made a sauce by making a roux with 1 T. butter and 1 T. flour then added the drippings. The onions were an added treat (if you don't mind cooked onions). So sweet and tender. Served with Japanese-Style Sesame Green Beans (also on this site), mandarin oranges and plain white rice. WOW. As another suggested, it would be great to mix some of the sauce in with the rice (rather than just piling it on top). SO SO SO Yummy.

This was GREAT! I made it for company tonight (which always makes me a little nervous, trying a new recipe with company coming) but it turned out exactly as I was hoping. The only change I made was to use half soy sauce and half teriyaki sauce instead of all the soy sauce that was called for. It was sweet but not too sweet, and the meat was so moist! It tasted like I had marinated it. I did only end up cooking it for about 40 minutes and it was completely done, even a little more dry than I would have preferred.

Very delicious! I just made these for dinner tonight. I did as other reviewers suggested and added more honey to the sauce. I went an extra mile and marinated the chops for three hours in honey, garlic salt, and manderain juice. Cooked it covered half the time, flipped them, and then uncovered it for the final ten to fifteen minutes of baking. The frying part in the recipe DOES help so DO NOT SKIP that part. I served the chops with garlic red potatoes and salad with homemade dressing. Fantastic!!!

Yummy! Has a good sweet taste. I will surely use this recipe again. I did cut the recipe in half,it would have been way to much for my husband and I. I also flipped the pork chops half way through cooking to get both sides cooked in the sauce. I think it would be even better if it was marinated over night.

This was a fabulous recipe.  I did add worchestshire sauce and green/red peppers to the sauce.  Everyone love it.  I plan to try it with pork tenderloin next time.

Thank you!  This was really simple and very tasty.  I didn't pan sear the pork chops first and they turned out very well.  I would suggest using very little water, if any.  The flavor is really wonderful, and my husband loved them, too.  This is a keeper.

I thought this was fantastic and it smells so good when baking!  I didn't change anything about the recipe except I only used 4 chops (well, tenerloin boneless chops) but kept the rest of the portions as written.  I didn't really measure the honey (I'm sure it was about 3-4Tbs), either, but I wouldn't change a thing!  I covered with foil for the first 30m, then took it off till the meat reached 160, which took about 40m more - my chops were about 1.5" thick.  Delicious!  Will be making again!  Oh - I didn't brown in the pan first, but that's just b/c I didn't want to wash the additional pan.

First I had to scale this to 9 chops, but then followed exactly except I didn't have onion. My chops were on the thin side so I only baked for about 25 minutes. Definately a tasty dish, also I did flip halfway through to get both sides coated well w/ the sauce. Will make again, and I might add more honey so that flavor comes through better.

We thought it was great. Something different and will defiantly make it again. I made some little changes ...I added the juice from a fresh mandarin and twice the amount of honey to the sauce. Marinated the meat in the sauce for 1 1/2 hours. Put garlic powder on the chops before frying. I baked 3 chops for a little over a hour. My Husband said 5 stars for sure. It was not too sweet just a nice flavorful combination.

Sound recipe! However, try using a "bone-in" chop. The bone will add more flavor and tenderness. Pork can now be eaten a little less cooked these days due to science, sear the chop on high heat to get the crust, 3 minutes tops each side, then bake! Remove at 150 degrees and let rest, in about 5 minutes it will done!

I was disappointed in the thin consistency of the sauce, but this was very flavorful, moist and juicy.  I take reviews with a grain of salt and often just blip right over the ones where the reviewer has made so many changes that the end product doesn't even resemble the recipe.  In this case, though, I'm glad I took the advice to reduce the browning time to three minutes per side (plentyof time), double the honey (and then some), slice the onion and place the slices on the bottom of the baking dish, and reduce the cooking time.  I turned and basted them after 20 minutes, and spooned the sliced onions on top.  The chops registered 160 degrees after 40 minutes, and the onions were nicely caramelized.  Everyone liked it and they want to have it again.

WOW!  Totally loved this recipe.  I didn't really feel like pork chops though so I made something totally different.  But it was great!  I hate the reviewers on this site.  Make your own  recipe if you can do it differently and better.

Also did this with chicken!  In fact I have tossed chicken pieces in a freezer bag with the sauce and froze it.  Popped it out of the freezer bag while still a block of Ice and put it in a baking dish.  Set the oven to come on and bake it.  Cooked rice when I got home.

These are great as is, but for an even more bold, fuller flavor, I replace the water with bourbon and they turn out absolutely great -- better then five stars. I cover the baking dish with foil and bake the pork chops for 30 minutes on one side. I then remove the foil, spoon some sauce over the chops, and bake uncovered for another 20-30 minutes (depending on the thickness of the chops), to an internal temperature of 160 degrees. Make sure not to over cook. I take a temperature reading when I turn the chops to get an idea of how much longer they should bake. Serve the chops with any extra sauce spooned over the top. Thicken the sauce with a little cornstarch and water if you want.

Good start... leave out the 
honey (too sweet), no water, no onion,no pepper, increase the oil to 1/2 cup, increase the ginger to 1 tsp., and add 1 tsp. garlic.  Marinade all for at least 3 hours and grill, frying is soo unhealthy.

This was such a delicious pork chop recipe!!  I added some Garlic, the tiniest bit of Sweet Chili Sauce (like 1 Tbs or even less)  And Red Bell Pepper.  I also kept this originally suggested amount of sauce and used it for just our 2 pork chops..  After baking the pork chops in it, this left me a good amount of the delicious sweet sauce to pour over the rice. It made a delicious meal!

I thought these pork chops were great. However, I altered the recipe a bit. I added some grated garlic, teriyaki sauce and pineapple juice. About half way through, I added a pineapple to the top of each pork chop. I made this for friends, and they devoured them.

Had to wing it with this one because I didnt have the time. Put the oil in the pan, sauteed the onion for a few minutes then added the pork chops. Browned on each side then added the rest of the ingredients. Covered and simmered for 10 minutes on the stove. Removed the meat raised the heat and added a little corn starch. Meat was probably not as tender as the oven would have been but the family (all 5) loved it. Ready in 20 min.

Oh my gosh!  Thank you for making me the queen of pork chops tonight!  I halfed the recipe, as we only had 3 pork chops, but I used all 3 tbsp of honey.  The onion I minced really fine, and added to the sauce.  I didn't even have to turn them over halfway through, just brushed some of the sauce back on them.  These things melt in your mouth!  The onions get their own sweet flavor when they carmelize in the oven, and it blended so perfectly!  Everyone loved them, definitely a family favorite!

Both my boyfriend and I love this recipe.  I sprinkled the pork chops with a little garlic powder before frying for 3 min per side, and my boyfriend suggested that I add about a tbsp brown sugar to the sauce. Also I only baked them for about 50 minutes. Absolutely delicious!  Thank you!

These are wonderful. I made them on a night that we had friends over. Everyone thought they were great. I did use bone in chops as that's all that I had on hand but the flavor was wonderful. Next time I will be using double the sauce however. Thank you for sharing.

This was excellent! I followed the directions exactly and it was very tasty. A light sweet taste to it. I think the 1/8tsp of fresh cracked pepper was a nicer touch then already ground pepper. Will for sure make again.

When I made this I didn't have very good quality pork chops so even though I adjusted the cooking time they turned out tough. However the sauce was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!! I can't wait to try it with better chops and maybe even chicken!!

This wasn't all that good - certainly not what I expected based on the reviews.  The pork was seriously overcooked and dry and the sauce did not have any substance.  The flavor of the sauce wasn't bad, but it would need to be thickened to be effective, I will not try again, but if I did, I would eliminate the water.

Excellent recipe, I only modified by adding 1 tbs balsamic vinegar and 1 tsp of Dijon mustard to the sauce.  After cooking thicken sauce with 1 tsp dissolved cornstarch in water and served over rice. Thank you this one is a keeper.

So delicious and easy! We are a fan of spicy more so than sweet, so we added a teaspoon or two of hot mustard in the sauce...we really liked the result.

I only cook for myself, so I'm always looking for easy recipes. This is a good one! I set the servings to 2, but then I added minced garlic, doubled the honey and increased the water a bit. I lined the pan with tinfoil to make for easy clean-up, and I put in thin-sliced onions as a bed on the bottom (as recommended by another reviewer). The pork chops came out perfect and delicious!

Very tasty. I marinated pork chops overnight and since I did not have any onions, I used 2 garlic cloves like others had suggested. I did not brown the meat first and I only baked it for 45 min. I will make it again and next time I will brown the meat and maybe thicken the sauce at the end to pour on top of it.

This recipe did not turn out as I expected it to. The sauce seemed really thin... My husband and my sisters boyfriend LOVED it. I myself did not care for it and most likely will not make it again, unless the hubby requests. 
 P.S I'm also 6 weeks preg so my taste buds may be off! I might make it again after the baby just to make sure! ;)

I didn't find these to be all that great. I added garlic powder to the rest of the ingredents and I covered them for the first half of the cooking time. I found them to be a bit dry. My husband said they were good but I don't think I will make these again.

Awesome! My 7 yr old couldnt stop telling me how great it was, which is rare. My husband thought it was gonna be dry, but it was very moist. I didnt brown the meat first, and it still turned out moist. I think it would be even better if it had  marinated for a couple hours first but overall this is a great recipe. I used pork steaks instead of chops.I didnt have ginger, and i tripled the recipe since the steaks were so big. Perfect recipe, easy and delicious. Highly recommended if you dont want to stand over the stove. Thanks for sharing!!

tried this tonight,   was a little concerned about the cooking time,  I was right.  Brown for 5 mins and then bake for 1 hour +,  are you kidding me it was worst than leather!!!   You don't need to cook pork to death anymore.

I made twice the amount of sauce and baked rice in the pan with the chops. The taste was great and we will use this sauce recipe again maybe even with chicken or shrimp.

These were very good, and the sauce is very nice.  I will definitely try these again, but will not use a thick center-cut chop like I did the first time.  I think this is one of those recipes that give a good starting-off but needs to be tweaked to your personal tastes, know what I mean?!

Yummy recipe.  After tasting the pork chops my son said "That a recipe to keep"  I did use olive oil instead of vegetable oil and instead of cooking in the oven I cooked them in the crock pot on low for a few hours after brown the chops on each side.

the sauce tasted fantastic, but i would suggest brining your cut of pork before making this, as mine turned out a bit tough, cooked as per the instructions above.

Really good!  I used 4 chops browned, put the 1/2 cup water in the pan where I browned the chops to get the good juices from the meat and mixed all the liquid in there and then poured it over the meat.  Also used the same amnt of sauce but added 2 more T. of honey as in the recipe for 6 chops.  Served over rice with the sauce.  Yummy!

Good flavor, but the sauce was thin and not a lot of flavor transferred to the meat.  I think either thickening the sauce or marinading the meat overnight would help.

I cooked this yesterday and I was pleasantly surprised.  I like sweet so I used only 2 tbs of Soy sauce.  I marinated the pork chops for several hours. This was a great recipe.

This was fantastic.  I marinated thin boneless chops for 24 hours with the sauce and onions.  Added some chopped garlic too.  Baked it then sliced it up and served it mixed with Jasmine rice and sauteed french green beans stir fried in sesame oil.  Sprinkled the mixture with toasted sesame seeds.  My Hubbie, 2 and 3 year old could not stop eating it.  No leftovers!!  A keeper for me.

This is a great recipe...only thing to change...you don't need to bake it for 1 hour...I baked it for 45 min. at only 300 and they were great...also, when I pan seared, added salt, pepper, and some ginger--great! Will cook again!

ok, maybe i'm being one of those annoying people that rates a recipe and says they changed everything about it... BUT, my husband wanted to grill some nice, thick pork chops tonight, so i made this sauce without the water and added about a teaspoon of hoisin sauce, and they were FANTASTIC!  we just kept mopping the sauce on them every few minutes and they were SO tender, and the honey was so great all carmelized on the chops... mmm.  thanks for a great sauce recipe!

I'm a bachelor and I owed some hospitality to some lovely ladies in my apartment building who often feed me very well indeed. I made this, served it with rice and the Splash of Color Skillet from the site. I am now officially rated as a Master Chef by my friends. Loved it!!

Read a lot of the reviews about blandness and dryness.  Thought that searing the meat before adding the sauce might be a mistake.  Searing locks in juice and other sauces out.  I used the sauce as a brine for 3 hours mixing twice.  Then seared my boneless pork ribs and added back to the sauce.  I did double the sauce recipe and baked on 325 degrees for a half an hour covered and 15 minutes uncovered.  I used a bread pan so the sauce would completely cover the ribs.  Family loved the flavor.  Some of the bigger pieces were pink inside but I like under done vs. over done.  The flavor definitely penetrated the meat.  Love to hear any other ways to make this.  It was delicious!

Pork chops  were great they just fell apart. My kids loved them and so did my dad who is a very fussy eater. I did add a little more honey to the recipe as a reviewer suggested. I served it with mash potatoe and used the juice for the gravey not bad. Thanks for the recipes!

Simple recipe and very tasty. Love recipes with minimum ingredients. I baked for only 30 minutes after pan frying. 
There was a lot of sauce leftover in the tray after, so i poured it into a saucepan and added some cornstarch to make a gravy. That topped it off. So yummy. Will definitely make again.

We love these. I bake mine covered with foil and take that off for the last 10-15 minutes of cooking- the chops seem to stay moister that way. 
Great recipe! Thanks for sharing.

I am rating on the sauce only because I just have zero success baking boneless pork chops. I instead browned them on both sides, removed from the pan. Then sauteed the onions till tender and then added the sauce ingredients and pork on top. Cooked on medium for about 6-7 minutes. removed the pork from the pan, and cooked down the sauce for a few. coated both sides of the chops and served with sauce poured on top. The taste was very good and my chops were perfect. would make again.

Might have been better if my husband had been home when they were done, which was after 30 minutes, not 60 minutes.  I never bake pork chops that long, but thought maybe with all the sauce they would need additional time.  They did not.  The sauce was liquid, even after an hour, so I mixed in 1/2 Tbsp of cornstarch and water to thicken it.  It was ok, but I have better recipes.  Won't be making again.

I gave this 3 stars because its' appearance didn't turn out like I had hoped; glazed and brown.  But, I am happy with how it tasted.  It was flavorful and my family liked it.  They even ate the leftovers I had later.

I just made these for dinner tonight.  Followed directions exactly except for suggestion to cover part way then uncover and this turned out perfect!!!  When my husband took his first bite all he said was OH MY GOD and eyes rolled....that is enough to give a definite five in my book.  Made rice with broccoli as side dish the sauce left in pan is delicious served over rice.  I will be making this again very soon.

Very good.  Covered in foil for first 30 minutes and uncovered for last 30 minutes.  Next time I might thicken the sauce a bit, but it was still really good over the prok chops and rice I made with it.  I added garlic like some suggested and a little extra honey.  Saw someone mentioned sesame greeen beans as a side dish.  To save time I used Green Giant's frozen ones with the almonds.  Perfect side and the sauce tasted good on those too!

Taste was nice but the pork chops came out a bit dry. If I make them again I will modify the recipes - perhaps letting them cook in a skillet vs. in the oven.

Very tasty, but the cook time was way off, especially if you fried them even briefly.  I pulled them out of the oven after 40 minutes, and they were dangerously close to dry.  Flavor was great-- poured extra heavy on the honey, and I tried half soy sauce and half teriyaki like another reviewer suggested and they came out beautifully.  Next time I'll fry for just a couple minutes on each side to seal in juices, then yank out of the oven after 30 - 35 minutes.

This recipe didn't turn out properly for me.  I followed the instructions to a tee and my pork ended up tasting more like french onion soup than like something asian inspired:(  And the 1 hour cooking time was WAY off..... my dish cooked at the proper temp and was done in 20 minutes!!!  Thank goodness for meat thermometers cuz if I hadn't set mine while the meat cooked, and had set it to the specified time instead, my pork would have been WAY over done!   I had high hopes for this recipe, because of the simple ingredients and easy instructions.... I think I will try this again but make a few modifications to make it less salty and oniony!

Delicious!  I've made these twice now and have followed the recipe exact.  The only thing I did different was baked for 40 minutes instead of an hour; didn't see the need for the extra 20 minutes since the chops were done.  Served these with rice and broccoli, pouring the sauce over the top; excellent pork chops with an oriental flair!  Thanks for the recipe.

If I could give it 3 and a half stars, I would.  It was good. but not great.  I should have listened to the previous reviewers and doubled the honey; I coudn't taste it.  I used 1/2 and onion and that was all I tasted.  I also added a minced clove of garlic.  They weren't very tender- they weren't tough, but a little chewy.  Maybe I'm a little picky because I'm pregnant.... but they could have been better.

this was very moist and easy to make. i am a new cook and i was able to make this on the first try!  i didnt sear the meat and found it was done after 45 minutes in the oven. i would double the honey next time as that is the flavour i like best and found it was lost with the other flavours. there was lots of sauce left over for the rice. i will be making this again!

Easy, fast, moist, and delicious! I sliced the onions and placed them in the bottom of the baking pan, and covered for the first half of the baking time, as suggested by a couple of other cooks. Don't know if it made any difference in the moistness, but didn't think it would hurt, and feared the dreaded dry chop!

Love this sauce! I used chicken instead of pork. I made the sauce the night before and let my chicken marinade in it over night, then I grilled it on my indoor grill. It was incredible, it has become a regular recipe for my family.

These went over so well last night with my fiance and company. I didn't have any ginger so I used 1 clove of garlic minced. I added about 5 drops of spicy brown mustard (love sweet and spicy together)and sub'd olive oil for the veggie oil. My chops were a bit on the thin side so they were done in about 35 mins. Had I cooked them the whole hour they would have been a bit too dry. This is a keeper, thank you so much!

My whole family enjoyed these.  I doubled the honey as suggested by others.  I also put lemon pepper on chops before cooking them on the griddle.  I then cooked for 30 minutes covered in oven and 30 minutes uncovered.  Used corn starch and water to make gravy out of juice.  Yummm.

The sauce was marvelous but the pork chops were very dry.  I should have gone with my first instinct and not have cooked them for so long.  One hour was way to long to chops, twenty minutes to half and hour would probably have been plenty of time.  Will try again but will cook for much lell time.

I LOVE this recipe. I even use the base sauce as a light glaze for pasta...I stir fry the sauce ingredients along with some mixed veggies in a skillet; then add cooked pasta.  WOW!! Thanks :o)

These were excellent -- very flavorful. I did not marinate ahead of time and instead of baking them, I browned the chops in a pan and then added the sauce ingredients and simmered covered on the stovetop for about 30 minutes. The chops stayed very moist and were full of flavor. My kids (4 and 6) ate them without complaint! :)

This is good. I think you can just brown the pork chops on the stove and brush the sauce on the chops or dip in the sauce. I would double sauce if you bake or cook the chops on the stove. One more thing, you do not have to add the water.

This recipe turned out very well for me, in spite of a near-disaster.  I made a few changes:  First, since pork chops are typically so lean and can dry out easily, I borrowed a technique from another recipe.  I heated three tbsp of olive oil in a small skilled with a couple of cloves of diced garlic and a teaspoon of ginger.  Once the oil was hot, I let it cool slightly, poured it over the chops and rubbed it into the meat.  I covered the chops and refrigerated them for a couple of hours.  Something about the hot, seasoned oil on the meat works to keep the chops super moist.  I followed this recipe, but leaving out the water and onions.  Once the chops were in the oven, I ran out to pick up my daughter from an activity.  Should have been home in 20 minutes tops, but things ran very late and we were gone for over an hour.  I got home ready to pitch the overcooked chops and order pizza, but when I took the chops out of the oven I was shocked that they were still moist enough (not perfect) though certainly completely cooked.  It's the hot oil treatment, I'm sure of it!  :)  They were very tasty, so I'm looking forward to making this again some night when I can take them out of the oven sooner.

This was awsome!  My picky husband loved it, and could not beleive I did not marinate it for hours!  My picky 5 year old asked for seconds. I used pork tenderloin instead of chops.  I will definately make this again.

This was really good.  I was in a rush so I did it all on the stovetop.  I sauteed minced garlic in the oil (I used olive) for flavor, then after I browned the chops- which I had sprinkled on both sides w/ salt, pepper and onion powder- I dumped the oil and added the other ingredients to the pan.  My changes- I added 1/4 cup teriyaki sauce, 1/2 tsp jarred ginger in addition to the powdered, a generous sprinkle of red pepper flakes for heat, minced onion instead of chopped (I was out), and cornstarch to thicken the sauce during the last 5 minutes. I cooked the chops and sauce 15 min covered, and 10 min uncovered. I tossed in a small, drained can of water chestnuts right at the end. I served with peas in brown rice. Yum!

I too was very surprised by how much we liked this.  Be sure to use a meat thermometer early on in the cooking time.  My chops were over an inch thick.  I browned them a lot so they were done baking in about 20 minutes.  I set the chops on a plate and covered them to keep them warm.  I then poured the leftover sauce into a Pyrex, added 2T Wondra, and poured it back into the pan that I browned the chops in.  The result was a nice glaze that went really well with the chops and the brown rice and broccoli.  Thanks a lot for a very simple but very yummy dish!  I only had three chops.  If you have six and like sauce, you might want to double it.

I used boneless pork chops.  I only cooked approximately 30 minutes, and they seemed dry.  The sauce was very thin and didn't glaze like I thought.

FANTASTIC!!!! just two changes! hope this helps those who thought it was to sweet. I marinated chops in mixture for an hour. Instead of soy sauce I used Terriyaki sauce and I added minced garlic and basil to the mixture. i tried a piece when it was almost done and it seemed a little too sweet for my taste. I cooked some bacon and put half slice on top of each chop and baked for five minutes before taking out. The salt from the bacon made the chops less sweet. Served with back beans and saved the sauce from the baking dish for a quick lunch recipe tomorrow with chicken. Will add in routine dinner schedule! thanks! 

Oh and, I put the chops on the plate and then the beans over it, Chops werent that sweet... the blend of the beans and the sauce was very delicious!

Well now....these chops were perfect in a pinch and then some!  My chops were thin so I reduced the oven temp to 300 degrees for one hour and they turned out tender and tasty!  Thank you for this post...it is indeed a keeper!

I used the boneless porkchops with this recipe. I also used 2 teaspoons each of garlic powder, onion powder and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper on the meat before browning in the oil. I then covered it with foil, after a half hour I basted the chops, recovered and then basted again and took off the foil for the last ten minutes. Once this was done, I placed the chops in a air tight plastic container with the gravy to keep the moisture. I served this with Rice Pilaf and Mixed vegetables. A good recipe that I will make again.

Great recipe!  My husband and I were very impressed.  I added 2 extra tbs of honey and turned the chops over half way thru as suggested.  I also used onion powder because I didn't have an onion.  I will definitely make this again.

It was easy and had a nice flavor.  I didn't make any adjustments.  My partner really loved it - I thought it was OK.  He has more a sweet tooth than I do.  Would make it again.  I served this with Smushed Apples and Sweet Potatoes (from this site) and corn on the cob.

I just made this recipe two nights ago and it was darn DELICIOUS!!! I used about half cup of honey and I marinated the mixture overnight.  Instead of pan fry,  I put the 1 inch thick chops with the mixture  in the oven at 350* for an hour and 20 minutes. These pork chops were very tender and juicy. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. Will definitely be making this again and again.

Very delicious. I sauteed the onions and a clove of garlic in avocado oil, instead of veggie oil. I only used 2/3 of the honey. Turned out great!

My family is pretty picky when it comes to getting recipes from the internet, they think it will taste bad. But I am happy to say they absolutely loved this recipe. I did what others said and doubled the honey and it was really good. Definitely a keeper. Thanks!!

These turned out great. The sauce is VERY sweet, and cooks into the chops nicely, keeping them from drying out as well. Even my wife, who hates onions, loved this dish.

This was so easy and so good.  I could see doing the same thing with chicken breasts.  Next time I might thicken the sauce with a corn starch slurry and top with minced scallions.  Really good.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe. I used 4 bone-in pork chops and they still came out amazing. The only thing I would do differently is less baking time, since you brown then anyway. A big thumbs up on this one!!!

Awesome flavor!  I love the mixture of sweet with the bit of spice from the ginger.  I also halved the recipe, but used double the amount of ginger, added a dollop of maple syrup and also added fresh chopped tarragon and rosemary.  My cut down version called for 1/3 of a cup of water but I only used 1 tbsp. I'm going to try this with chicken and salmon, too!

I made this last night and the only change I made since I did not have honey, I substituted it with brown sugar.  OMG so delicious.  I left my 5 year old try it before I started serving dinner and she kept wanting more before I even made her  plate... Thanks for this recipe definitely a keeper.  I did as other reviewers as well and flipped half way through the cook time...

Simple and delicious. I made a few changes to suit my taste:

(1) I used boneless, thin sliced chops (the pan fry variety). I baked it covered for about 15 minutes and un-covered for another 5 minutes ( both at 325 degrees)

(2) I followed the advice of other posters and added an extra two teaspoons of honey.

(3) Also added 3/4 tsp of garlic powder and one fresh garlic clove (smashed in a mortar with a pestle). Did the same with fresh ginger

(3) After removal from the oven, I strained out the liquid, added 1 tbsp. of all-purpose flour and 1 tbsp. of butter. I quickly simmered this and added it to the onions I had removed. This made for a great glaze.

(4) I also very quickly pan-fried the pork chops (after removal from the oven) on a very hot skillet.This was to sear the exterior.

(5) It was a little more effort, but this recipe is amazing enough to be tinkered with.

Followed recipe exactly except to bake for an extra 15 minutes.  Made a really thick boneless chop, and it needed the extra cooking time.  I did slice an onion and lay the chop on top of that - yum, delicious with.  Served with some kind of stir fry Japanese noodles I had, drizzling a  little of the leftover sauce on them, and adding the chop/onion slices on top.  Applesauce rounded out the meal. Have a bit left that will just fill the bill for my lunch tomorrow.  Sauce is a keeper for future reference.

I made this for dinner with just a couple of additions. There are only two of us so I had two very thick pork chops. I sauteed the chops as the recipe indicated and added 4 strips of bacon to the saute. I also cut 4 large carrots into 1/2" strips. I put everything (Bacon on top of the pork chops) into a 9"x9" baking pan and followed the recipe directions from there. It was so delicious! The carrots baked in the mix were amazing! It was kind of like a pot roast with the carrots in the sauce. We had steamed cauliflower on the side and when we saved leftovers, we put the carrots, pork and cauliflower together in the sauce. We think it will be perfect for lunch tomorrow! Great recipe!

It is a good recipe. Hassle free. I made a paste of 1 onion with the rest of the ingredients and spread it on the chops after browning it for 3 minutes each. I did add a splash of sweet chili sauce, but it wasnt hot enough for me.. would add more hotter sauce the next time. I was out of ginger so I used roasted garlic flakes. It was good.

Made it with the Japanese Sesame beans like Ryann did and added the Mandarin oranges as well and it turned out GREAT. I used Pork loins not chops and they were about an inch thick so they had to brown and bake a little longer, but overall a great meal!

This was SO easy to make and items that most people would have in the house. The pork chops were tender and I poured the sauce that the pork chops cooked in over rice. Great, a keeper. Would be good with chicken too!

This was amazing! I've made it twice now. The first time I followed almost exactly just omitted the ginger. The second time I used more honey, still omitted ginger, and marinated the pork and skipped the sear. Both turned out really delicious and will definitely be added to regular menu.

made these the other day for dinner they were a big hit, husband and pre-schooler both had seconds. I did not have any ginger though, so i used onion, and garlic powder. Also two chops would not fit into the baking dish so i quickly mipped up another batch honey mixture, this time i added 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, and abouth 1 tsp of ancho chili powder.  These were great too.

Very good recipe! Don't skip the pan searing, double the honey (at least), and also I deglazed the pan with the marinade before pouring over the meat. Then when it was done I took another users advice and made a 2 tbsp roux and added the juice from the chops. It thickened nicely and I poured it back on. Delicious! Next time I'll use boneless chops.

I made this as a double batch to have leftovers and it was great the first night and just as great the second night. I also doubled the honey and the sauce was wonderful. Thank you!

This recipe was easy & had a lot of flavor!! I, too, added more honey to it (4-5 tblsp). My husband doesn't care for pork but liked this recipe! i will definitely be cooking it again....maybe next time i'll not put in so much soy sauce.

I think this is the first dish that I've made from this site that I didn't have to substitute something. I had all the ingredients here in Bolivia. That being said, I did do some things different. Being a garlic lover, I took the suggestion of others and added garlic (5 cloves). I also made the sauce + 1/2 batch more. I soaked the pork in the sauce for 1 hour and then proceeded as written, except when it came time to pour the sauce over the pork, I reserved (more or less) the extra sauce I had made. I poured that in a saucepan (the same one I had seared the pork in) cooked it for a minute or so, added 2 T more of oil and some cooked white rice and let it 'fry' for around 8-10 minutes over medium heat. It needed a little salt to finish it off. Then when I took the pork came out of the oven, I poured the sauce into a saucepan, sprinkled in some flour and stirred it real well. I let it cook over high heat until it thickened some and served that over the pork. It was a very tasty. The wife, 5 year old, and 2 year old gobbled it up! My 2 year old beat all of us and asked for more meat!

These were delicious! The only thing I changed was to double the honey.  Next time I will add little or no water to make a thicker sauce and get a better glaze.  I used thin chops and they only took about 25 min to bake.  Thanks for the terrific and simple recipe!

I made this exactly as described.  It was delicious!  I served it with cooked pasta.  However, I do not recommend this.  When I ate the chops with the pasta, I thought they were bland and did not plan to make them again.  When I ate them the second time without pasta, they were delicious!  The pasta kind of masked the flavor of the chops!

I made this and it was really good! The only thing I would do is double up on the sauce an marinade it for at least 30 minutes before baking. The sauce is great for gravy!

It was good as far as moisture but not a whole lot of flavor.  Maybe if you marinade it before it might have more flavor.

Awesome tasting and tender!  It's a keeper recipe that I'll be doing again.  I ran out of ginger from making gingerbread at Christmas so instead I added some garlic and a bit of pumpkin seasoning.  Delicious!  However, when I get my ginger, I plan on making it again with that instead so I can try the original recipe.

the flavor is fantastic but like many even upping the honey and decreasing soy and water the sauce was very runny.  there are too many reviews to read as to how to solve it and to experiment with cornstarch etc seemed risky as i didnt want to unbalance the flavor.  ill need to work on this one :)

Delicious, but the cooking instructions are WAY off.  A pan sear of 2 minutes per side and 20-25 in the oven would be better.  If you sear 5 per side and bake an hour your destroying your meat.

I baked the pork chops for 45 minutes instead of an hour because they were boneless.  Unfortunately, they were quite dry even though they had been cooking in the liquid.  My husband did like the sauce and the onions, though.  I would consider trying this recipe again and maybe grilling the pork chops instead.

This was great, I browned the chops with a little flour dredge seasoned with ginger, garlic, onion, salt and pepper. Next time I plan on making a roux and thickening up the remaining marinade/glaze into a dipping sauce for the pork.

I made this last night and served with Japanese-Style Sesame Green Beans found on here--great combo!   I used butterflied pork chops which didn't take as long to cook.   I took some of the sauce and poured it over rice when I served it.

Very good recipe and easy to make with ingredients readily available and usually onhand.  I added a little crushed garlic to the onion mixture too, and upped the ginger a bit (just bc I like ginger.)  Thanks for the recipe!

It was good, and I love the combo of the recipe, but the sauce is WAYYY too thin and blah in taste. Next time I will do several things differently.  1.  Omit the water.  They do not need it! 2.  Add cayenne pepper- and additional spices to ramp up the flavor 3.  After browning the pork chops, I would saute the onion and all the sauce makings to make a roux to start, THEN pour it over.   4.  I would add carrots and red pepper and sesame seeds

I don't really care for oven-baked chops but love anything with soy sauce...so I marinated the chops with the below ingredients except I left the water out, doubled the pepper, used dried onion (about a TBS) and soaked for 30 minutes. Cooked in the skillet just long enough to cook not leatherize....excellent taste and texture.  I am giving a 4 because I didn't quite follow instructions...

There was nothing redeeming  about this recipe. The sauce did not reduce as the chops cooked.  Had to put it on the stove to reduce. Oven temp was too low to caramelize  chops to look  like picture. The favor was acceptable but once again I don't understand the great rating. I may do again without the extra water as it seemed to dilute the honey, soy and ginger.Water didn't add anything.

Very tasty!  Sweet, but not too sweet...served w/ fried rice.  Before browing chops, I sprinkled them w/ sage, onion powder, garlic powder, and black pepper, just for more flavor.

Very Good! I used 4 thick chops, browned in olive oil, added some minced garlic, and baked it in the same skillet.  Great with garlic mashed potatoes.

Great recipe, loved the flavors. Just stick to the 325 oven temp. I tried to up it because I had baked potatoes going at the same time...not good. Because of the honey in the mix it darkened and caramelized.

Good recipe. Nothing spectacular, but great for an informal weeknight meal. Mine turned out much more dry and tough than I'd prefer using the cooking method listed. I think I might keep the marinade but use my regular method of baking covered in water for fork-tender chops. Great basic marinade recipe, however.

Use this recipe as a starter, but did a variation of it.  Pretty much just mixed together some olive oil, low sodium soy sauce, and honey in a dish.  I only used two pork chops so I eye balled amounts and did enough to baste both, also sprinkled some pepper.  Then baked in oven for 8 minutes each side, depending on thickness. Came out very juicy and delicious.  Used remaining sauce to coat some roasted carrots I made as a side.  Will try this again, thanks!

Definitely a keeper! I added just a little hot sauce to the mix because we like things a little spicy. It was just right. We served the extra juices over couscous and it was delicious.

Wow! Surprising deliciousness! It's really a simple recipe and nothing radical -- there are a lot of sweet pork chop concoctions out there -- but this one just gets the proportions of ingredients spot on. Had it with a zucchini carrot tomato sautee, potatoes, and beer. A great, easy, filling meal.

This was an incredible recipe. I added some brown sugar and garlic. When I tried it, something was missing, though. My brother suggested mustard, so I added a couple teaspoons of some superhot Asian mustard. It was just what it needed! Next time I think I'll add even more hot mustard, though. I served it over a bed of white rice and the sauce was soooo good with rice.

I made this tonight for dinner and followed the recipe exactly. It was excellent. All of us enjoyed it and my son asked me to make it again very soon. We had it with rice and the sauce was very good on the rice. My husband and I are looking forward to having the leftovers for lunch.

Yummy flavor. One thing I would change is to cover the chops while baking, to help them tenderize. I will definitely make this again.

Very nice.  I used thinner pork chops so make sure you keep an eye out.  One hour would have been way to long.  Also probably could have used a bit more soy sauce!!

Personally I wasn't too crazy about these based on the recipe for the sauce. I thought the soy sauce overpowered a lot of the other ingredients but after a lot of modifications it got better and once I actually baked them, they were tasty. My husband loved them. I added in 2 heaping tablespoons of brown sugar, added water and some more honey. Then I covered them and let them bake flipping once. I will make again with less soy sauce and definitely adding the sugar in.

I would marinate next time b/c it lacked deep flavor. I followed recipe to a T & it was dry (I cooked -covered- for 45 min). I gave 2 stars b/c the sauce had potential, but was too thin. It didn't thicken enough to stick to the chops which would have helped add more flavor to meat.

This recipe did not turn out how I expected. I used the suggestions such as cut back on the soy sauce, use more ginger, let the chops marinate and add flour to the mixture to thicken. The sauce still did not stick to the chops and it became clumpy after baking. I used chops that had the bone in. They did come out tender because I covered them like someone suggested. I also only let them cook for about 45 minutes. I even browned them before baking. I don't know I was just disappointed. This is not a keeper for me.

Very, Very good.  I did not change a think other than using boneless chops.  If followed the recipe EXACTLY and they were very moist and very good.  The sauce is amazing.  I served with some a nice side of rice and veggies with a nice green salad.  Very Good.

This was tasety hwoever teh meat was a little dry. I did not cook as long as the receipe called for due to other comments but hte meat was still a little dry. Next time I will take the advise of marinating meat. Also, I did score the meat before cooking so as to soak up the juices.

This was good.  I think it may have been even better for it to marinade for a few hours.  The only change I made was to cover it while cooking.  I tend to think pork just comes out more tender when covered in the oven.  Great recipe!

Delicious!! I made this dish with 1 inch thick porkchops, so they took a little longer to cook in the oven. I served it with rice and the sauce was wonderful with the rice. I put more honey in it like som people suggested. 
I will definitly make this again.

Very good and very easy.  Used 6 tablespoons honey and uncovered the dish during the last 1/2 hour of cooking to brown.  Had to move our stars from 5 to 4.  This time, we used the boneless chops and have to agree with some of the others - not  much flavor and kinda dry.  Still doubled the honey - even the sauce seemed lifeless this time around (:

This recipe was just delicious!  The only changes I made, was I added 2 cloves chopped garlic to the sauce, I marinated the porkchops for 2 hours before cooking and, I added 1 tbsp. cornstarch mixed in 2 tbsp. water to sauce to thicken it up.  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing!!!

Just made & ate these. Pretty good. Not spectacular but good flavor. Re: other reviews - go easy on the soy sauce & definitely increase the honey. Don't be afraid - it doesn't get too sweet. Added minced garlic to mix. I sauteed sliced green peppers, then added to the chops about 10 min into baking time. Also took suggestion to thinly slice onion & layer under chops - loved this. Finally I did the roux thing, spooned on top of chops & white rice. Ate with sliced fresh tomatoes and a little S&P. Overall, easy & quick (I only made for 2).

Very good, but I wouldn't necessarily call them honeyed pork chops.  The ginger and soy sauce are more powerful than the honey flavor.  I also added 2 cloves of garlic and a dash of Worcesteshire sauce.

Edible but not very good. The sauce was really watery and it didn't mix too well with the juices from the pork.

i was looking for a different way to make pork chops and decided on this one, was very pleased with it. the pork chops were very tender and moist with a great flavor. the only change that i made was to use balsamic vinegar in place of the soy sauce because i was out of the soy sauce.

This is an excellent recipe.  I also took some tips from others, I used 1/2 teriyaki sauce and 1/2 soy sauce.  I also added a little bit of hit chili sauce.  The taste was really good, somehow my pork chops got dry?  not the fault of the recipe though.

The flavor was great (I used real ginger), but it was VERY watery. We put some on noodles & broccoli and that was great. I also only cooked them for 30 min. I am shocked to read how many people would cook them for a whole hour, maybe a whole tenderloin for that long would be ok - not chops. Mine were a hint of pink on the inside and cooked to temp. and they were very juicy. Next time I may reduce the sauce to make it more glaze-like or reduce the H2O.

I used the sauce as a marinade and then cooked them on the grill. Awesome, moist and flavorful.

I just tried this last week. The sauce was really tasty but an hour was WAY too long. I only cooked mine for 40 minutes (half covered/half uncovered) and they were dry. I think that with pork in general you really have to be careful though. I also think that this might have been better if I would have marinated the pork in the honey sauce for a few hours. I did like the flavor and plan on trying it on chicken (marinating it, of course) and grilling it!

These were awesome! Based on previous reviews I used 1/2 soy sauce and 1/2 terriyaki sauce. I used bone in pork chops and covered my baking dish with foil in the oven after browning. This kept them from drying out too much. Leftovers were really good too!!!

This was an easy recipe that my husband and my children enjoyed. Even the 3 year old!  This is a keeper.  I didn't bake it quite as long as what was called for because my chops were only about an inch thick.  Quick enough even to prepare on a work night.  I shared the recipe with co-workers and they loved it as well.

Excellent recipe.  Next time I make these I will skip the browning (they were a little dry) and perhaps marinade the chops.

This was way too salty for me though I do feel the recipe has potential.  Next time I will use half the soy sauce and add more honey.  I will also decrease the baking time.  I used boneless pork chops that were pretty thick but one hour baking time is way too long as my pork chops came out a little dry.  Hopefully with these modifications, my next try will yield better results!

This recipe was great.  I was a bit nervous because I'm not always a big fan of ginger but this wasn't overwhelming.  It blended very well.  After browning I cooked the chops in the oven for about 35-40 minutes and turned half way through baking to get the sauce baked into both sides. Delicious!

Great taste! I used a little more honey, a little less water and less soy sauce, less onion and less ginger. I cooked it about 10 minutes shorter too and it still was a little dryed out. But the flavor is WONDERFUL and I will be making them again.

Excellent recipe!
I did not marinade the meat or flip it while cooking, but basting it every 15 minutes made a huge difference! I also used bone-in chops.
I will definitely make this again.

This recipe sounded great.  I wanted something easy that I could just put together and kinda "forget" about for the hour it needed to cook.   They smelled great as they were cooking.  When I took them out of the oven I was so dissapointed.  The pork chops were very dry and didn't seem to absorb any flavor from the honey/soy sauce mixture.  I didn't even brown them for the recommended 5 mins per side as I thought that seemed too long if I was to bake them for an hr.  30 mins would've been more than enough time and the chops were a good 2-3 inches thick.  I would probably make the sauce again, but as a marinade and then either grill the pork or bake for a shorter period.

Good flavor and very simple.  I did season the pork chops before browning with garlic powder and black pepper. I would suggest checking the chops after about 30 minutes, they very dry after cooking for an hour.

I made this with 4 thin chops and pretty much halved the sauce:  it came out really tasty.  If you don't like soy sauce, this one isn't for you!  For my thin chops I baked for 40 minutes and that was too long.  I'd try 30 next time.  I served with mashed potatoes and peas because they were milder and complemented the stronger flavored pork chops.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I did use apple juice instead of water and added minced garlic.  The flavor was very nice!  The only improvement I would perhaps make next time is to thicken the sauce slightly and/or marinate the meat a bit before hand as others suggested.  This would be great on a tenderloin as well! Mmmm.

We really liked the flavor of this dish, even though the sauce didn't thicken as I would have liked.  Next time I'll thicken it on the stove w/ cornstarch, perhaps.

I don't know what I did wrong, but I was not at all impressed with this recipe. I did half it, so that might have been the problem. The pork was dry and the sauce was watery and didn't stick to the chops at all.

Very good.  However, I would marinate the pork chops the next time.

These pork chops are sooooo good! My husband and I just loved the flavor.  Our girls, ages 3 and 1 1/2 loved them too!  This is surely a staple on my menu.  I made some rice and mixed the sauce in it and served it as a side with the chops.  Yummy rice, too!

They turned out dry and I only baked them for 45 minutes.  If I make them again, I would definitely marinade them overnight and bake for only 30 minutes.  The sauce was very good but the taste did not transfer into the pork chops.

This was a very tasty recipe.  I had used cheap, thin sliced pork chops, and only cooked them for 20 minutes (after I had browned them).  They were a little overdone, so I probably won't brown them again.  I also followed a previous posters advice, and added 2 cloves of minced garlic to the mixture.  I also thickened it up on the stovetop with some cornstarch.  It was so good! I made some fried rice to go along with it, and my husband AND picky 4 year old ate it all up!  Thanks for the recipe!  This one's a keeper.

Delicious and simple recipe! The flavor was a big hit in my house. I used minced garlic in place of the onions. My pork chops were med. or even on the small side, so they were well done in far less time...about 25 minutes actually. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was delicious.  We didn't have much time, so instead of baking we broiled chops about 4 min. each side.  I thought a sauce would be nice, so I used same pan to scrap up bits with chicken stock and simmered in fresh garlic, onion, ginger and a little cornstarch.  We ate it all up!

Very nice taste! I used some rather small/thin chops, though and still managed to overcook them a little, so will use some thicker ones next time.

I have made this recipe several times  and changed it up a little each time. I usually use thick center cut chops. This last time, I used boneless country style ribs, (on sale!). I doubled the sauce,marintated them for about an hour and then baked covered for about 2 hrs basting and turning frequently. To brown them I removed from oven and placed on a broiler pan. Then I poured the sauce into a pan, thickened slightly with corn starch, and brushed on like bbq sauce. Put under broiler for a few minutes turning and basting once. They were very good. I look forward to playing with the recipe some more. Thanks

Very good....i made them as directed. I used thick cut boneless chops. They turned out very moist and tasty. I basted them with the sauce several times while cooking and turned them midway. I will be using this recipe again.

Very good - very moist.  I used more honey and since I only had really skinny chops to work with, skipped searing and baked for 25 minutes instead.  Would like to try again on thicker cut.  Glaze was sweet and had great flavor.  Boyfriend loved them so I would make again for that reason.  Thanks!

This recipe also makes a good salad when used with chicken breasts. I slice the chicken serve them over a romaine salad drizzled with some of the liquid.

I thought these were soooooo good. I am not a huge ginger fan so I left that out, but even so they were amazing, and the taste just melts in your mouth.  My sister is a picky eater and thought they were a bit sweet, so I may cut back a bit on the honey next time.  Thanks for sharing!!! :):)

Very good recipe.  I didn't fry the steaks first, just marinated for a ehile in sauce and then put straight into over.  When it was done, I strained the onions out and put them on top of the pork chops, it was a big hit!

I doubled the sauce amount for this and skipped the pan browning part all together and marinated the chops for about an hour.  I always use very thick pork chops and don't know if it made a difference, but mine were very dry even with the sauce almost covering them and turning them half way thru.  I think the sauce tasted pretty good overall, but still need to get my chops to come out moist which is the whole point of making any pork chop recipe in my opinion.  Maybe it was the omission of browning them, i guess next time i will have to try to make sure.  Thanks

Sorry, I just did not care for this.  I added extra honey and still it wasn't as sweet as I expected it would be.  Just had an overwhelming onion flavor to me.  Hubby thought it was OK but I won't be making this again.

Made without the onion, since I don't care for it much. I also used thin chops, so the timing was off and they turned out a little tough, but excellent flavor! Will definitely make  these again!

I made this tonite and although the house smelled great and the sauce was good with my own variations, the pork was not that soft after sitting in the oven for an hour.  I did cover it with tin foil which was unclear in the recipe if you covered it or not when it went in the oven.  The pork was also more white after putting it in the frying pan first and cooking for 4-5 minutes a side.  It does not have the same color as the pic shows.   I'm an experienced cook, usually do my own thing and thought I'd just try this dish but was disappointed.  Nothing special.  Just being honest.

I have made this a couple times – Honey should be cut in half  or third (compared to my family's taste for sweetness).  Also there is way too much liquid – which the second time I made this I turned it into a gravy for the chops and the mashed potatoes on the side.

Not impressed. Maybe it would be good/moist if you triple the sauce recipe, add garlic and cook in the slow-cooker. Flavor was ok, but VERY dry. Even after cutting down on the baking time.

Excellant! There were no details on when to add the onion, so I just sauted with the last 5 minutes of browning the pork chops. I wouldn't change anything. We loved the flavor!

Bob, Larry and I enjoyed. I didn't thicken sauce, followed recipe,  except reduced onion to 1/2 medium onion. Browned chops first then in oven at 325 for 40 minutes, didn't dry out!

Great flavor! As other reviewers, I doubled the honey, and added 4 cloves of garlic. I also added 1/2 tsp Worcestershire sauce and 1/2 tsp Liquid Smoke! I marinated the chops for about an hour and a half. Baked 'em for 45 minutes. Enjoyed it with some broccoli rice casserole and cornbread. Perfection!

Thank you, BOOKCHICADEE, for a delicious recipe. I have made similar dishes before, often with pineapple juice or orange juice or even jelly as the sweet ingredient, but never with honey. This was so good -- hubby raved! I used lower sodium soy sauce, doubled the honey, and cut the water to 1/4 cup. I sliced the onions instead of chopping them. My dish only required 30 minutes of baking after searing the chops for 3 minutes per side (I used 1/2" boneless chops). I also sprinkled the chops with garlic powder before searing.

Pretty good recipe. I added red pepper flakes and dried cilantro to the wet ingredients. Also added a teriyaki ginger rub to the chops before searing in the pan. It turned it very well.

Love these!!! I have never seen my family inhale their dinner like they did tonight. I took the advice from previous posts and doubled the honey and added garlic; I also added a little bit of sesame oil. Flipped them halfway through and they were done in about 50 minutes.

I loved the flavor (and added a little Chinese Five Spice to make it even more interesting), but the chops were a little dry. I baked them covered for the first half, then uncovered for the rest. Next time I will reduce the baking time and try leaving the cover on the entire time.

I used all of the ingredients except for onions (only because i can't stand the stinky things), and i didn't use the oil because i don't eat fried foods & i would like for this to be as healthy as possible. lol. I have mine marinating in the fridge & was wondering if you would still need to cook it for an hour or no?
but just with the few ingredients i used, the sauce is AMAZING!
When it comes to my family, it's kinda backwards. My husband is a chef and has the most amazing talent when it comes to cooking, and me? well, lets just say you'd rather starve than eat my cooking sometimes. haha. I always get nervous when trying out new recipes, because in the past i have failed miserably. So I'm really hoping this one is a success!

Love this recipe,  have made it many times, always a family favorite.  Have cooked it as written but have also used the crock pot,  either 4 hrs on high or 7 hrs on low.  The gravy is great either on rice or mashed potatoes.  You can thicken the gravy but it is not necessary.  Try this recipe you will not be disappointed.

Very good, did quicker version with broiler and no pan fry. Just soaked quick, broiled high top rack five minutes each side with brushing on marinade in between, then sprinkled bread crumbs one side and 2 more minutes with broiler. 15 min and done!

I just started cooking a couple years ago, so things have to be stupid-simple for me to handle it. Just tried this tonight. I doubled the honey per the other reviews, as well as seasoned with garlic powder and pepper while browning. I used only about 1/4 cup red onion and added baby carrots. When the oven time was done, I drained most of the sauce into my sauce pan and thickened it with corn starch/cold water over med-high heat. It made a great glaze. I think the cook time was too long, but otherwise I thought everything was great! Next time I think I will cut back the cook time because the pork was a tad dry, but very tasty!!!

These were super easy to make and I listened to other reviews and doubled the honey. They came out delicious but the only thing I would change is that a hour is too long. They came out a little tough. Served with Snow Peas that were drizzled with the marinade, it was a good dinner.

So good.  Istead of baking, first I browned the pork chops.  Then I added the onions and remaining ingredients.  Bring to a medium simmer and cover and cook about 30 minutes.  So tender and much faster and easier than baking.  Made this many times and it's always so good!

I made per recipe but used bone in pork chops, as that is what I had.  Good flavor, but next time I will not add the water, use more honey, and leave out the chopped onion; it did nothing for the recipe.  Stir fried veggies in the pan I browned the chops with some soy sauce, and served over brown rice. Yum! Will make this again.

This was scrumptious!  Next time I make this, once the pork is done in the oven, I will add some thickening to the sauce before serving.  Perfect with rice or noodles!

This is by far my favorite way to make pork chops!  I bet it would be just as good with chicken too.

I was looking for a new way to prepare pork chops when I found this recipe. All I can say is "My oh my".  This recipe was delicious!  My family loved them and told me we have to have them again, soon.  I doubled the honey, as others suggested and used a little less water. Other then that, I followed the recipe exactly. Thanks so much for sharing.  We felt like we were dining at a high end restaurant, they were that good.  I served this dish with the Kickin collard greens recipe, from this site, and mac n cheese, and corn bread.

Love this meal.  Super tasty.
I added an extra tbsp honey, dash and garlic.  Browned the chops first. Added only 1/4cup water.  With four chops, had plenty of sauce,probably because I covered it for the first 40min.
Baked for 40min, covered then turned chops and baked another 15min at 325 uncovered.  They came out moist and delicious
Omitted the ginger, not sure I would like it, but the next time, I will add it along with garlic and dash
Thanks for sharing and will make it again.  Served with rice

A solid recipe that I would make often. I think the point is that these are simple and good - if you are expecting a fancy dish you might be very disappointed. I marinated the pork overnight (not sure what the difference in taste is). The sauce and drippings basically end up at the bottom of your dish when baking, so I think it's best to take those drippings and add it to a roux (1 tbsp butter & 1 tbsp flour) and add another tbsp or however much you want of honey to sweeten it up. Baking time is questionable. It probably depends on how thick your pork is, but definitely cover it with foil for at least 20 minutes and then check it frequently after it's uncovered.

These were the best pork chops I've ever tasted and my family agreed. The next time I make them I will not use the water in the recipe. It made the glaze too thin. Still tasted wonderful, a definite keeper!

i havent eaten it yet, but after browning the chops on both sides for 5 minutes, my chops were cooked in 26 minutes.  They were 1 1/4 thick.  so i would suggest checking the temp every 15 minutes.

This was a great recipe.  I did bread the chops with flour and bread crumbs and fried them in a little olive oil before baking with the sauce tho. No leftovers on this one, my Husband polished off even the small pieces on our daughter's plate.

Great recipe! Followed the directions exactly... only substituted the ginger for garlic because I didn't have any ginger. :P

The pork chops came out great and super moist.  Would cook again!

Flavorful and tender pork chops with an excellent glaze! My family really enjoyed it. My only change was to substitute 1 small onion for a handful of green onions chopped small. I think that added better to the Asian flare that these porkchops had. Definitely one to keep!

Evidently, my chops were too thin to be in the oven for an hour.  Chops were tasty, but a bit tough.  Next time I will check after about 35 or 40 minutes.

Maybe I should be rating my own recipe, but I made some changes.  I used double the honey, added garlic, olive oil and fresh lemon grass.  I also used fresh ginger too.  I marinated the chops in the sauce for about an hour before placing them on top a bed of sliced onions.  I omitted the water.  I actually broiled the chops about 9 minutes each side and they came out great! Sauce was disappointing though.  Should of followed some of the other reviews and added some cornstarch to thicken it.

Made this with a couple of minor changes mentioned in the other reviews ... Doubled the honey and I also doubled all of the other sauce ingredients.  Sliced the onion and put some under the pork chops as well as on top when the sauce was poured on.  This is great served with rice and will definitely make again!

This recipe is a keeper. I didn't flip the chops, and it had a lovely baked-on glaze. So much more tender than skillet fried. I like that this recipe is so simple to make.

The only thing I did different was the type of honey used.  After putting in the water it was too runny.  Without the water the sauce was too thick.  I am presently using the top of the stove to cook it.

You know, I have the hardest time cooking a good pork chop because it seems they always overcook or all the taste is all on the outside. This was the best pork chop I have had in a long time. I was proud I made them and will definitely make them again. Loved the flavor.

This was quite good. We enjoyed the asian type flavor and it was simple and easy to make. Served it with brown rice and broccoli. Only negative I can say was it made a whole lot of sauce that never really thickened up at all. But good flavor!

First off, definitely do not need to bake these for one hour.  I only baked for 45 minutes and they were still dry.  I think I'll shoot for 30 minutes next time.  Other than that, these chops had good flavor.  I basted the chops with the sauce about 3 times and also baked them on top of slice onions instead of putting the onion in the sauce.  The onions were so good served along with the meat.

I had saved this recipe for the next time I remembered to buy honey.  When I finanlly remembered to buy honey, I didn't have pork chops.  But I did have a pork roast!  I baked at 350 in a high sided glass dish just large enough for the roast so the liquid covered much of the roast.  Basted a few times with the chopped onions winding up on top.  The result was one of the most tender, moist, flavorful pork roasts I ever tasted.  Yes, I will try with pork chops, but this could not have been better.

I have to admit I did not make as directed because I discovered I had no ginger.  I did not substitute - just made it without the ginger and it was delicious.  I served it with baked acorn squash, and my husband kept pouring the juices into his squash.  He has asked me to make this recipe again.

This recipe was easy to make, and taste great! My kids loved it. The flavor was really good. I am not big on the taste of honey, but I could not taste it :). I will use this recipe again.

Turned out great! Doubled sauce and added garlic and crushed red pepper.  Baked for 45 min and turned out tender and yummy:) Served with Baked Acorn Squash.  I'm always looking for new ways to use honey since my family loves it.

I made this according to the recipe, bumped it up for 8 chops. It was very tasty, the honey was not over bearing adding only a bit of sweetness. The onions added some nice flavor.

This was pretty bad. I followed the directions exactly and the meat was so dry! The pork had no flavor. I added cornstarch and water to the liquid to make a glaze. That made it bearable to eat but I will not cook this recipe again.

Next time I will make it in the slow cooker and dust the pork chops with flour prior to browning them. Even though I added corn starch the sauce was too thin, but very flavourful. I added garlic  too.

OK.  I little disappointing.  We liked the flavor, but the sauce wasn't thick enough when done.  I'll try thickening the sauce next time with corn starch.

I had to cook them an extra 15 min. or so before they got tender enough, and by then they were a little dry for my tastes.

LOVED this recipe!  It was super easy and very tasty!  I recommend using a little less soy sauce than the recipe calls for as it was almost too salty.  But overall it was great!  Will definately have it again.

I had some Country pork ribs that I wanted to BBQ, but decided to use them on this recipe. Glad I did! I really like to follow recipes to the T, but per the suggestions from the other reviewers I took a chance.  They were tender and moist! And the flavor was delicious!  I added more honey (6-7 TBS) and 1 chopped garlic clove, per suggestions. I didn't cover them. In the second half of cooking (after 30 min) I turned up the heat to 350 for another 20 mins. I should have taken a picture, I will next time. :0) They came out PERFECT! Served them up with Jasmine rice and broccoli. Thank you!!!

Wonderful, I use 4 tablespoons of raw unfiltered wildflower honey. The first time I made them 3 didn't seem like enough. It depends on how sweet you like your pork chops. I also used a medium sized onion as it adds a lot of extra flavor and is a nice contrast. A nice alternative to the usual apple brown sugar chops (which are good too but so is variety!)

YUM! These were great, only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that I followed a few suggestions from previous reviews. I sliced half a red onion and covered the bottom of the baking dish and put chops on top. I basted the chops every 20 min, drizzling additional honey when I did so. I flipped the chops once, half way through. I had somewhat thin chops so it only took about 45-50 min. They turned out moist and delicious. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

I've used this recipe many times. It's always a hit and my husband asks me to prepare it often.  Instead of mixing onions with the bowl with the other ingredients, I use a couple of tablespoons of shallots to give an intense flavor. I sprinkle the onions on tip of the chops and them pour the mixture over them.  It truly is a great recipe.

This was absolutely delicious!!!!! The only deviations I made from the original recipe were to rub the chops with brown sugar before searing, watching them closely, and flipping every minute and a half or so to keep from burning while in the frying pan, and throwing an extra squirt of honey on top of the chops once in the baking pan as well as an extra TBS of honey into the soy mixture. I made sure to flip once during cooking to thoroughly saturate the meat with the YUMMY honey/soy mixture, and when doing so made sure to throw an extra honey squirt onto the exposed top again. Once this was done cooking I threw 2 TBS of butter into a sauce pan over med-low heat, whisked in 2 TBS of flour and a splash of milk and then added the liquid from the baking pan. It got a tad thick so I just added an extra TBS or 2 of water, whisking it all together for an amazing sauce/gravy for the meat and side dish of white rice. To compliment the sweetness of the dish I chose a balance of tart with my vegetables and prepared roasted garlic/lemon broccoli. HUGE hit - will DEFINITELY make again!!!!!!!

Very good!! I added a touch more honey, and I didn't have onion so used a bit of onion salt, it was good, but would still be good without the onion, also had it loosely covered the whole time. Got a good review from a very picky eater! This one is keeper!!

We have this quite often.  Quick and tastey.  I make it with 2 chops or pork cubed using other ingredient amounts for 6.  The extra ingredient amounts make a wonderful sauce for the rice.

GOOD ASIAN FLAVOR- MY ONLY CHANGE WAS I USED FRESH GINGER THAT I HAD ON HAND AND I ADDED A TEAS. OF MINCED GARLIC- MINE TURNED OUT TOUGH- I THOUGHT THE PORK WOULD BE TENDER- MAYBE I WILL COVER NEXT TIME- HUSBAND DID NOT LIKE AT ALL BUT HE DOES NOT LIKE ASIAN FOOD- THE SAUCE IS LIKE A MARINADE I USED TO USE- MIGHT ALSO TRY AS THAT- THANKS

Like many others, I marinated the chops in a honey; soy sauce; white wine & olive oil mix for about 3 hours prior to cooking. Then, instead of baking, I put the chops into my Emile Henry crockpot, covered them with the ingredients almost exactly as per the recipe ( except I doubled the amounts & halved the soy sauce ) & slow cooked in the oven ( 120 C ) for about 2 and a half hours. Absolutely  great and the drippings made a fantastic sauce after reducing for a few minutes.

Excellent.I didn't change a thing and my husband loved it. He is a creature of habit and finds fault with every new dish. BUT this one he raved about. Even took leftovers for lunch. That's a real thumbs up.

My whole family loved this! The only thing I did different was that I floured and browned my pork chops, and I added an extra tablespoon of honey. This was so amazing! We will definitely have this more often!

We thought this was great.  Followed all ingredients exactly, but marinated the pork in the mixture for about 8 hours instead.  Then took the pork out, browned both sides and put in baking dish with the marinade.  Very delicious and flavorful.

My husband couldn't get enough of these. He told me it was a 5 star recipe and he's a tough critic when it comes to food. I did add garlic and doubled the sauce. I also marinated them longer than stated in the recipe.

Added garlic and a chopped red chili, plus a bit more honey than called for. I'm not very good about measuring and probably added too much water, but found the sauce a bit thin. Flavour very nice- would up the ginger a bit next time.

This was ok.  Aside from increasing the amount of sauce for rice, I followed the recipe exactly.  I thought the marinade ingredients would really come through, but here was just no "wow" factor.  Husband felt the same.

I'm not sure what I did wrong.  I browned the pork.  Made the glaze.  Put it all in a baking dish and baked for 30 minutes uncovered.  The pork was DRY and the glaze was just liquid and the meat did not have any flavor at all.  It was TERRIBLE and we DID NOT EAT IT. I would love suggestions because I really had high hopes for this one.

These are pretty good. I didn't have ginger so I had to leave that out. I only cooked for 40 minutes then added some flour and butter to liquid and made a gravy.

Only thing I added was to sprinkle cinnamon and a salt/herb combination on the chops before doing them in the skillet. Very, very tasty chops - lots of compliments.

Excellent! Added a bit more honey as other users suggested and it was a big hit. I also added onions and red/green peppers for visual effects and served over rice. Will definitely make again.

An excellent recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and the only negative of the dish is the pork chops were a bit dry/tough. Serve with plain rice and broccoli.

I didn't follow exactly but the original recipe would have been perfect too. I used chicken breast as I didn't have any pork at home and added some minced garlic and cayenne pepper to the marinate. I cooked this in the stovetop and served with rice. YUM!

Very good! The texture was amazing and the sauce was nice and tangy. I added some bell peppers but otherwise left the recipe alone. I do think it would be better marinated, but we used the sauce as dipping sauce and it was awesome!

Sorry but I nor my family like it.  The pork chops we're dry and too sweet.  I followed the directions perfectly.  They looked and smelled good.  But no one fininshed their meal.

Great!  I marinated the chops for 30 mins before I put them in the pan.  I wish the sauce thickened up a little bit more - but it was great, regardless.  (I didn't have any onions around, so I added 2 tsp. of chopped garlic, instead.)  I would definitely make this again.

I was looking for something fairly quick and easy to throw together as it was one of my son's baseball nights...this seemed to fit the bill!  I browned my boneless pork sirloin with some garlic and pepper, left them in the skillet, added the other ingredients (used fresh ginger instead and no onion).  Let them sit 'marinating' while we were at baseball.  They cooked in about 40mins or so and had really nice flavour.  I was actually surprised at how nicely the 'sauce' thickened somewhat during the cooking as it looked quite watery at the beginning.  Nice recipe!

This recipe was FANTASTIC!!!  I wanted to find a new way to do pork chops, and when I told my fiance that they would be "Honeyed Pork Chops," he gave me that look that said...please do not mess up good meat.  When it was done, and we finally ate...HE LOVED IT!!!  I also took the advice of another reviewer by doing half soy sauce and half teryaki sauce in place of the full 1/4 cup of just soy sauce.  Overall, THANK YOU!!!  This was wonderful!  I will be doing this recipe again especially on chicken!  I will be sure to make enough now that my fiance loves the recipe!

So good! The changes that I made:
Marinated the pork chops for about 3 hrs and baked for the recommended 40 mins. I turned them over half way through and also redressed with the sauce a couple times while it was cooking. I did not use ginger. Added 1 more TBS of honey.
It was not at all dry like pork chops usually are and was very delicious!

One of my favorite pork chop recipes!!  I love the combination of the sweet and salty flavors from the soy sauced and honey.  The onions add to the dish as well.  I have made this dish many times and serve it with white rice and steamed veggies!  Delish!

Great recipe! I didn't add all the soy sauce and increased the honey by another tablespoon. Went great with brown rice. Next time I will serve with a veggie...maybe snap peas.

Absolutely delicious!!  I've made it twice so far and the family loves it more each time.  I double or triple the sauce or everyone fights over it.  I make this with white rice and use some of the sauce over the rice.  Definetly a keeper!

My pork came out flavorless and dry. I used garlic as recommended by others but apparently it made no difference. I didn't even save the leftovers. Maybe it's me???

I decided to try this recipe in the crockpot, using the full amount of sauce, but only three pork chops, since I cook for two adults. I put the chops on a bed of chopped cabbage, sprinkled the onion, sliced, over top, and then poured the sauce over all. 

The only change I made to the sauce was to use half teriyaki/half soy, instead of all soy. 

I was afraid the cabbage would scorch, so I added some chicken broth to it, but I think that made it too spouy. The sauce and the condensation from the cooking process would probably have been plenty of moisture to cook the cabbage. And the pork came out wonderfully cooked--and moist! A very nice recipe.

Very Good. I needed them in a hurry so I kept them in a simmer on the stove for 20 minutes in the sauce after frying them up a bit. We covered mashed potatoes with the sauce also. Yummy!

THIS RECIPE DIDN'T COME OUT THE WAY I THOUGHT IT WOULD.  I EXPECTED A MORE STICKY HONEY GLAZE RATHER THAN A THIN SAUCE, ALTHOUGH THE FLAVOR WAS GOOD.  MY TEENAGE SON THOUGHT THE CHOPS WERE A LITTLE DRY.  NEXT TIME I WILL REDUCE THE COOKING TIME OR USE BONE IN CHOPS.  ALSO, I'LL REMOVE THE CHOPS AND REDUCE THE SAUCE UNTIL THICKENED.  MY HUSBAND LOVED IT JUST THE WAY IT WAS.

This was good.  I sprinkled pepper and garlic salt on the chops while they were browning.  I agree with others that the sauce should be used as a marinade.  There wasn't a ton of flavor from it without marinading.  I baked them for 30 minutes and that was plenty.

Great flavor!  I'm not a big fan of ginger however so next time I'll use less. The remaining liquid is great drizzled over white rice.

EXCELLENT!!!  Added some garlic.  Otherwise, followed recipe exact.  Generally I am not a fan of soy sauce.  However, loved the sauce and the pork was tender.  Husband liked it too.  Will definitely make again and again

I was extremely impressed and delighted by this recipe! It was fast, easy and wonderfully tasty! I omitted the ginger powder and added some garlic powder instead. I also added some sliced green peppers and increased the water/honey content. I added 1/2 tablespoon to give it an extra sweetness and flipped over the pork chops halfway through. Absolutely wonderful and delicious with plain rice! Thank you for the yummy recipe!

This was fine- alittle heavy on the soy flavor for our taste though.  After baking, I strained the onion, added flour and made a nice thick glaze.

This was very tasty. My husband is a very fussy pork eater, always complaining it's too dry. Everyone ate every bite of this. I used fresh ginger instead of dried. The sauce was delicious!

So here are my changes/additions:
Before pan frying the pork, I sprinkled it with garlic salt.  I also added garlic to the sauce.  I added more honey and ginger, and half the water to the sauce as well.  I cooked the pork 20 min covered and 20 min covered.  At the end of that, the sauce was still very thin, so I took the pork out and kept it covered and then transfered the sauce to the pan I originally browned the pork in and let it reduce down on medium high heat, adding a bit more honey and also adding some hot sauce (the asian one with the rooster on the bottle).  
Okay, now for the taste!  The meat was a bit dry - I think I'd leave it covered the whole time.  Also, I only made two chops with the whole sauce recipe and then some, so I tink with 6 chops you'd want to make more sauce.  Also, I think it was too sweet, but I also added more honey, so well, I wouldn't add more honey next time!  Other than that, this is a keeper.  I really liked it with just a little hot sauce and ginger and then boiled down so it was nice and thick to smear on the chops.  Very good.

Excellent recipe.  I'll add a bit more honey next time I'll prepare this dish.  I added a bit more ground ginger than suggested.

It was a huge hit w/ the family. I added extra honey, brown sugar, and cooked 20 min covered and 20 min uncovered. I cooked 4, for 2 adults and 1 child and didnt have enough.mmmmmm

This sauce was very good, but my pork chops were very dry.  I see that other reviewers didn't have the same problem, so it must be something I did.  My pork chops may have been too thin, or I may have needed to cover them in the oven (I did not assume this and left them uncovered).  But other than them being hard and dry, the flavor was delicious.

This was a great recipe that I will serve on a regular basis. I did increase the honey and made sure to marinate. I also added roasted chiles with it which gave it a bit of a sweet but mild bite. Thank you so much for the recipe.

I made this last night and it was very good. My only issue was the sauce was too thin for my liking. I thickened it in a saucepan with a cornstarch paste. Very tasty. Thanks for the recipe!

Mouth watering! Couple of modifications: seasoned the pork chops with accent, pepper, salt, and garlic powder.  Second major change is I cooked it all on the stove top, did not bake in the oven.  The sauce: same indgridents but added 1/8 teaspoon of nutmeg, about 2 tablespoons of light brown sugar, and about 1 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon. I also used apple juice instead of water. I cooked the pork chops in about a tablespoon of olive oil and cut up red and white onions in with the chops and cook for about 5 minutes on each side.  I mixed the sauce in a bowl and cooked in the microwave for about 5 minutes.  Then I added the sauce in with the chops and cook it for about 50 minutes on low heat, 25 minutes on each side. Like always taste to make any changes! You will love this one!

This was really good!

I skipped the ginger, added minced garlic and a bit more honey, and cut the water in half.

Fabulous - I will definitely make this again!!

The sauce ended up being way to thin and runny, but still very tasty.  Next time i will either cook it down a little or half the water.  I also added brown sugar to the top.

This was really good. I am all about big bold flavor and these came out quite flavorable. I can only imagine that these would be even better if they were also marinated in the sauce before 
cooking, as suggested by others. Thanks for this great recipe!

My fiance loved it!  I thought it was pretty good.  I must have done something differently, because it was not as sweet as everyone was complaining about.  I thought it tasted really strongly of the soy sauce.  I will not use so much next time, and I might increase honey a little bit.  I will definitely make it again, though.

Quick and delicious, though I put the chops on the skillet longer than 5 minutes on each side because I don't like my meat pink in the inside. I also added a dash of garlic salt. If you're looking for a quickie with quality-this recipe is it!

I'm sorry, but the spices just didn't seem to go well with the pork.  I think ginger was overwhelming for us.  That might be a personal taste issue.  Edible....but not enjoyed.  Sorry.

I was really disappointed with this since the reviews were so great.  I followed the recipe as written, but not only was my pork overcooked, but the glaze was more like a watery broth.  Also it was WAY too sweet!  Sorry but I won't make this one again.

My 4-star rating for this is probably more for personal preferences.  I didn't like the honey and onion tastes together.  I found it to be a little sweet, too, even though I only added 2 tbsp. instead of 3 of honey.  I didn't cook the pork for nearly as long either and my chops were very thick.  40 minutes and they were perfect.  Do thicken the sauce with some cornstarch for a nice glaze.  My kids and husband devoured this dish!

The flavor was just ok, chops turned out a bit tough and sauce was very thin.  I would give this another chance using other user suggestions.  Thicken sauce, cook the chops for half the time and add more honey and garlic.

I found the flavor too cloying, like bad incense. Cutting half the honey and substituing vinegar sounds insane, but makes it tangy and delicious with the soy sauce and ginger (which by the way is way too little).

This dish was so easy to make. I did cook the pork chops the full hour and they came out just fine. My boyfriend loved them and he has many dietary restrictions and these fit everything I look for in a receipe perfectly! Thanks for the wonderful, easy to make dish!

This was SO good!  I do agree that thicker pork chops would be better, as the ones we used were thin cut (on sale), but the taste was excellent.  I followed the recipe exactly, other than shortening the cooking time due to thin chops (I think I did about 30 minutes.)

I made this last night and it was fantastic. Based on the other reviews, I added a little garlic powder and marinated over night. I also used low sodium soy sauce (trying to lower my sodium intake). My husband raved about them and I just had to have seconds, which I try not to do. I can't wait to make them again!

I agree that one hour cooking time is way too long, but then it may depend on the thickness of your chops.  I used a meat thermometer and it only took about 30 minutes.  My husband liked them, but my son who is always hungry and will usually eat anything wasn't impressed.  I'm going to use the leftover chops along with the sauce to make some stir fry.

Didn't have any honey, so substituted 4 tablespoons of sugar + 1/4 cup of water.  Also seasoned chops prior to browning w/onion powder and garlic poweder, and added 1/4 clove of garlic to sauce.  It was ready in 30 minutes. Hubby loved it.  It's a keeper!!! :)

I was skeptical that this would taste good with so few ingredients, but it turned out very tasty.  I was unsure of the powdered ginger, but it was a very mild flavor and not a weird taste. I did add about 4 cloves of garlic to the sauce.  As with other reviewers, my pork chops were done in about 30 minutes (meat was not too thick or thin).  I did have to pour the sauce back into the saute pan and reduce down to thicken it a little and it turned out great.  We will be making this recipe again, maybe with a little less water to hasten the thickening of the sauce.

I made this recipe last week and added a bit of hoisin sauce to the sauce. I did not coom the pork chops ahead of time, and used fresh garlic instead of onions. My husband LOVED this recipe. He said it reminded him of something you might find in Malaysia!!!!! Great recipe

I thought this was good. I seasoned my pork chops before frying and i had to pull them out of the oven a few min early, the honey was burning in the pan. I will cook it for less time next time. These had good flavor though

Wow, that turned out really great. Even my 4 year old (picky eater extraordinaire) liked it.  I think I might try it with a little more honey next time, but it really was great.  Now the kids think Dad knows how to cook too!  Served it with white rice, and the sauce was wonderful with the rice.

I tried these the other night but added 1 tbsp. brown sugar and 2 cloves of minced fresh garlic to the sauce. Then I poured the sauce into a saucepan after they finished baking and thickened it with corn starch, then spooned a little over the chops before serving. I think it turned out ok. It's definately kid friendly but my husband and I thought they were just ok. Not the best but not the worst I ever had. I think the cooking time should be reduced to 45 minutes because an Hour is too long, My chops came out a little tough. Don't think I'd be interested in making this again.

I doubled the sauce and turned the thick pork chops over halfway through cooking.  I thought they came out juicy, flavorful, and tender.  I will definitely make these again!!

I also added some minced garlic and marinated my chops for about 4 hours. I used thin boneless chops and if I made this again I would use thick ones only. Seared my chops and then poured the marinade over and cooked for about 25 min at 325 and I thought they were overcooked - wished I would have served them from the skillet and thickened up the sauce and served atop (ended up thicking it up anyway after the oven). Sigh. I agree this will be great on chicken! So basically, ditto what IMVINTAGE said. We liked the flavor and will try again in some capacity.

Delicious & Tender. I always try to make a new recipe as stated, however, I did not have the exact ingred's.  I substituted teriyaki sauce for the soy, scallions for the onion.  I sauteed the scallions in the pan drippings & put half of them in the bottom of the casserole and the other half on top of the chops.  I would also marinade the meat while at work.  I served with Sazon Goya flavored rice and steamed broccoli.   This was a wonderful blend of flavors.  We ate it all!

Awesome. I marinated the meat in the mixture all day and then followed the recipe.  This was my first time making pork chops and they were amazing.  So juicy and flavorful.  A keeper in my recipe box.

I used bone-in chops, added 3 cloves of minced garlic to the sauce & marinaded for a few hours. The addition of the garlic made this recipe very similiar to a recipe I use for pork tenderloins (honey garlic ribs ...from this site).  I did thicken my sauce up a bit, while the pork chops rested, by reducing & then adding some cornstarch mixed in cold watter.  The sauce was extremely tasty but the pork didn't come out as tender as I would like (my chops were very thick)...from now on, I think I'll stick to the tenderloin & use this recipe for chicken, as suggested by one reviewer. I served these w/ Daddy's fried Onions & corn (from this site), a cuke & onion salad, & steamed sugar snap peas w/ fresh mint. I will use the recipe again but will sub chicken for pork.

Like another reviewer stated "eh" It was OK, nothing to stand up and cheer about.  I even put garlic powder on them before frying, as another reviewer recommended, but they still tasted sorta bland.  They didn't dry out, but I was expecting them to be more tender.  The Sage Porkchops recipe found on this site is MUCH better.  Everybody was disappointed that I did not make those.  Sorry, won't use this recipe again.

These were great!! Very nice flavor, moist and tender, too. I took the advice of another reviewer and did not skip the browning first. I think that seared in all the juices. I did marinate in the sauce for about an hour first. Very nice recipe! Thank you!

Very good! I will be making this again.  I had thin boneless chops, and baked them for 30 minutes.  I went by the recipe for the ingredients, baked them covered for 15, uncovered for 15.  The whole family enjoyed it.  Next time, I'll marinate them. I just love the honey, ginger, and soy taste!

This was great! Very tender. I took the advice of a shrewd reviewer & covered the dish for the first half of cooking & then uncovered it for the last part-giving it a nice glaze. I also added garlic & scaled the recipe for 4 servings. Thanks!

Awesome recipe! I made this for my boyfriend & his parents and they loved it! His dad's words were, "I can eat a whole pile of these!" Perfect the way they are, so juicy & tender they fell apart! Being told I have to make again!

My family absolutely loves this recipe. I even made it without the onion, and it still tastes great. This one is sure to be a family favorite.
