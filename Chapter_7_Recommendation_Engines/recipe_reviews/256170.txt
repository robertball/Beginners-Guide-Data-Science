This was exactly what I was looking for on a cold wintery day.  Prep was straightforward and the end result was excellent. The soup was delicious with plenty of goodness in every spoonful!

I skipped the food processing and added some garden tomatoes. I had 12 oz of salt pork I was going to use for a New England Clam Chowder so I used it in this recipe. Great ingredients and directions. Tasty chowder !!!

I doubled the recipe because I was sharing with a friend who is going through chemo. We  substituted a leek for the celery because it was on hand. I added the juice from the clams with the other liquids and simmered for 10 minutes and then added the 9 cans of clams plus half a pound of shrimp and half a pound of Tilapia to make it more of a seafood chowder. I simmered for 10 more minutes.  I added Cajun seasoning at the end to taste for a little kick. Excellent.

I used 1/2 teaspoon of dried basil in place of the fresh and I thought it gave it too much flavor of the basil.  I wish I would have left it out, altogether.  I made this on a Friday for a Sunday church luncheon, so I did not add the potatoes until Saturday evening , as I didn't want too much of the soup broth absorbed by the potatoes.  I used 4 cans of minced clams and 3 large stalks of celery. Otherwise I followed the recipe but I am not sure I would make it again.
This is my first attempt at making manhattan clam chowder from scratch, but I don't know if I would use this recipe again.  Perhaps it is better with the fresh basil and next time, I will be sure to get it, if I do make it.

The family said this is one of the top 3 soups I've ever made.  I would agree as I'm very picky about good soups. Mhattan style is sooo much flavorful vs. New England style...ridiculous I waited this long to make it. We added another can of clams as you can never overdo clams. Added Chipotle Pepper (1/2 teaspoon)  & Old Bay (1.5 tbl spoons) to our desired taste.  Asking for only 1 tablespoon of olive oil didn't work well...carrots took forever to soften. Next time will add more or goto butter. Also added 5-6 dashes of Worcester.  Will make a double batch next time.

I made this up the other night. Not having a food processor I used a whisk to finely chop up the stewed tomatoes and the soup came restaurant quality! Lot of work but well worth the effort!

I didn't put the full 1/2 of the vegetables in the food processor, just about a quarter.  I recommend you cut up the stewed tomatoes before adding.

I also added an additional can of chopped clams and a can of diced regular tomatoes.  It is very good and easy when you want a quick satisfying soup.  I will make it again.

the only change I made was out of necessity. I misread the recipe and only bought one can of stewed tomatoes...so I used a large can of crushed tomatoes to even things up and added some extra salt and peppers. It came out delicious! Will definitely make again! My husband loved it.

This is delicious, simple to make chowder. I'm always been a New England Clam Chowder person (and, boy, do I still love that too) but after trying this recipe, I find myself craving this kind frequently as well. I follow the directions pretty much down the line (though I don't really measure most of the ingredients now, after having make it several times) and it is wonderful. Try it!
