I did not care for this recipe. I recently moved back to the states from Korea and was craving some authentic Galbi-Tang. I followed every step and all ingredients to a T and after spending more then an hour and a half prepping and cooking this dish the broth was plain and while the meat was tender enough to fall off the bone it was bland.
