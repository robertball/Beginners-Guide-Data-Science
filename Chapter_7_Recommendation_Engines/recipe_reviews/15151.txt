This is a great coconut CUSTARD pie....but maybe I am missing something.....but a Coconut CREAM pie is different. We enjoyed this, but I was looking for the cream pie, not the custard. Just an fyi.....

This was a pretty good coconut cream pie recipe. I followed the recipe as it was written with the exception of two things: putting toasted coconut on top, and adding a little bit of water to the cornstarch (then thoroughly mixing the cornstarch and water together to prevent lumps from forming). There are a few things that I would change to make this recipe a 5 star recipe:

-Use twice as much cornstarch

-Use twice as much coconut inside of the pie to give the pie a better coconut flavor.

-Cut the Vanilla down to two teaspoons. In my opinion, four teaspoons gave the pie too much vanilla flavor.

-Put between one and two cups of toasted coconut on top of the whipped cream. The toasted coconut on the top makes the pie complete.

Again, I think that this is a good pie without those changes, but it would be a spectacular pie with those changes. Thank you :)

This pie was wonderful. I asked my husband to rate it on a scale of 1 to 10 and he gave it a 10. He's very picky and said this pie tastes just like any bakery. I didn't change a thing to the recipe but do make sure you have a deep dish pie crust because my filling filled the entire crust. A keeper recipe in my family!

Coconut Cream Pie is my husband's favorite pie, and he's so particular about it that he would only eat it at a restaurant we went to.  Since I have found this recipe he has been ecstatic because he now can enjoy his favorite pie at home!
It turned out great and was delicious!!! A keeper!
I used the French Pastry Pie Crust and just halved the recipe, so I only had one pie crust. A fabulous combination!

My Husband and I loved this rich pie, we've made it twice already. Delicious and super easy. We toasted the coconut in the oven and added extra to the top.

I made this with 2% milk not too sure if that was the issue or not,was a tasty I will say that I also used coconut extract instead of vanilla which made it better.I had t put it in the freezer to form it so I could cut it.Next time I will put more corn starch in it to see if that helps with the firmness of it. I will try one more time to make this pie. If you want a pudding though it is really good.

This was my first time making a coconut cream pie. I followed the recipe as it was written and it was FANTASTIC!  My family loved it.  I am making three more this evening, one for my family and two for a church dinner.  I am going to try and add meringue on these.

My husband's birthday was the same day that we were hosting our couple's card group and he requested a pie rather than a birthday cake so I made this. Everyone raved about it. It's definitely a "keeper".

I followed this recipe ALMOST exactly to the letter.  I thought 4 tsp of vanilla sounded like an awful lot, and after reading some other reviews of how it tasted very vanilla-y and not so coconutty I changed it to 2 tsp vanilla and 2 tsp coconut extract.  I made sure I packed the coconut into the cup, too, plus I added meringue and toasted coconut on top.  (For the meringue I used the egg whites that I separated from the 4 egg yolks called for in the recipe and I added it before I started to cool the pie.)  This pie wasn't runny at all.  I think the trick is to make sure it's completely cold before you cut it, so I would recommend refrigerating it overnight before you serve it.  It turned out great!  I took it to church for a potluck yesterday, and one of the ladies there (who has to be in her 80's) said it was the best coconut pie she'd had since her mother passed away. I took that as a very high compliment!

My family loves this pie! I exchanged part of the milk with a can of cocunut milk and made up the difference with 2%.  I also use 2 extra tbls of cornstarch, with toasted coconut on top of whip cream topping...I never have any left over!

Yummy!!  This pie is great!  I'm particularly happy with it because it's not loaded with sugar and it doesn't leave an unpleasant taste in your mouth.  It's very nice.  I did make a few changes according to other's suggestions.  I only used 2 tsp of vanilla and I did add a bit more coconut.  I used the egg whites to top the pie with meringue ("good meringue" recipe off of this site, but with only ~1/4 cup of sugar) and it turned out wonderfully!  Thanks for the recipe!!

This Coconut Cream Pie was more like custard than cream but it was fantastic to say the least.  Only thing I changed was one extra tbls corn starch.  I made it twice in one week, both times it was devoured.  Thanks for this one.

This is some good stuff... I used about a cup of coconut milk and 2 of regular... and also less butter because coconut milk has a decent amount of fat.

This was great! I loved this pie. There were just a couple of things I did differently. As suggested by another reviewer I doubled the amount of cornstarch and coconut in the pie. I also used only 1/2 the vanilla, although I don't think that change made much of a difference. Because I like chocolate, I used a chocolate crust and drizzled melted chocolate over the cool whip and toasted coconut. It was great!

I made this last year for Christmas, and I will be making it again this year.  I got a lot of compliments on this one.  Yes, it is more like a custard, but it is wonderful!

For my first cream pie ever, this was a big success!  It couldn't have been easier to make, and the flavor was excellent.  My only point of contention was with the shredded coconut throughout the custard -- I wasn't a big fan of the texture.

I had to make changes to this in order for it to have a better flavor: I did NOT add any salt, used 2 cups coconut cream and 1 cup milk, used 1.5 teaspoons coconut extract and 1.5 teaspoons vanilla, added in 1 extra cup of coconut, and used 2 extra tablespoons of cornstarch. With these changes, my pie came out wonderfully flavored and creamy yet stable enough to slice.

I have to start out by saying that this really is a 5-star recipe. I know this because my daughter made this pie first. In fact, within 2 weeks she made 4 pies. All of them were consistently perfect. I think the problem lies in my preparation of this recipe. I'm lost as to where I made my mistake. My pies tasted great but were much too thin, even after several hours of refrigeration. So, don't be afraid of trying this recipe. If it turns out right it is well worth the effort.

I made this for my husband, who loves a particular coconut cream pie at a fancy and expensive local restaurant. I made this with a whipped cream topping (using only 1/2 cup of liquid whipping cream). On top of the whipped cream, I sprinkled 1 cup of shaved white chocolate (Callebaut).  My husband loved this pie and is asking when I'll make it again!

I made this for my husband for Fathers Day and he said it was even better than his mom's and sister's homemade Coconut Cream pie. That is a major compliment. I thought it was great too. Simple to make. I did add and extra cup of coconut and it did make 2 pies. It is worth reading all the reviews to get some good hints like this one. I did not add the whip topping until it was time to eat it. My husband said he liked it without the topping so I'm glad I refrigerated without the whipped topping. Great recipe thanks.

As per one of the other reviews, I made the pie as directed, but only used 2 tsp. of vanilla and increased the amount of coconut to 2c. To get the right thickness I used 1/4 c. + 1/8 c. + 1 Tbsp. of corn starch. I also made a simple meringue to go on top instead of using the whipped cream. The pie was simply delicious. Creamy, yet flavorful.

This recipe was delicious, but the pie did not travel well.  I got it to the party and the whole thing had turned to mush.  Definitely not a show pie - or traveling pie - but the filling was certainly delicious.  Next time I'd just make the filling and eat it as pudding.

Very good. Reminds me of the one I use to bake (lost the recipe).  I did decrease the vanilla and added a bit more coconut.

This is the best dessert I have ever made, hands down. I followed a few suggestions others made and doubled the corn starch and coconut in the filling and then added whipped cream and toasted coconut to the top.  I also skipped the traditional pie crust and made a graham cracker crust instead - this was AMAING!!!! Everyone I fed it to loved it and it will be my new "go to" dessert. yum

This is VERY sweet!  Still good, but a little too sweet for my taste.  Next time i will cut down on the vanilla and add a little more coconut.  I also toasted some coconut and sprinkled it on top for a little more coconut flavor.  I will definitely use this recipe again, just without so much vanilla

Made this for a church event. No one seemed to want it but my husband ate some when I brought it home and he said it was good. I found the filling didn't set that well and was a bit runny.

I originally got this recipe from my sister-in-law and have been making it (with rave reviews) for years.  There are lots of different coconut cream pie recipes on this site, but to me, this one perfectly captures what a coconut cream pie is--creamy, coconutty goodness!  The only thing I do that this recipe doesn't specify, which adds a lot to the eating experience: top the whole pie with a layer of homemade whipped cream, so that your lwhipped cream is a good 1" thick--or more!!  If you use lightly sweetened whipped cream, it really offsets the sweetness of the pie perfectly.  Each bite is a like a dream!

Being my first attempt to make a Coconut Cream Pie, I took some reviewers' tips and decreased the vanilla to 2 t. and increased the coconut to 1 2/3 c.  Results were delicious!  Since I don't know the secret to a great meringue (weeping problem),  I opted for whipped cream topping.

I have to start out by saying that this really is a 5-star recipe. I know this because my daughter made this pie first. In fact, within 2 weeks she made 4 pies. All of them were consistently perfect. I think the problem lies in my preparation of this recipe. I'm lost as to where I made my mistake. My pies tasted great but were much too thin, even after several hours of refrigeration. So, don't be afraid of trying this recipe. If it turns out right it is well worth the effort.

Excellent. Rich, creamy, not too sweet. I followed it exactly. Next time, and there will be a next time, I will use 1/2 vanilla & 1/2 coconut extract, and toast the coconut for the top. I may consider using a bit more cornstarch.

Excellent and super easy pie!! I love this recipe and will add it to my recipe box. I added a half of teaspoon of coconut extract to the filling because I had it on hand and figured, 'why not'!! Make sure not to rush the process and keep stirring the custard the entire time. I used the Stabalized whipped cream recipe from this site for the topping and I would recommend that because you don't want a runny topping. Love it, thanks!!

This pie was very good, but i did cut down on the coconut, I just put half a cup in, one cup was a little to much, but I thought it was very good.

I personally can not stand coconut, but my father and brothers love it! this past Thanksgiving I made this pie and they went crazy!!! fantastic recipe! and as a side note...my dad doesn't eat sugar so I substituted about 1/2 of fructose (you could use splenda too) for the 2/3 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of unsweetened coconut for the sweetened (this can be found at any health food store). It was still a very sweet tasting pie and even my brothers who hate sugar-free foods raved! Thanks again!

This is a delicious dessert. For dramatic effect, I recommend toasting some shredded coconut and covering the whip cream on the top with it. Looks as good as it tastes!

This is an easy recipe to follow but I made the mistake of listening to a review and cutting the recipe in half.... so I had a very shallow pie. Next time I'll follow the recipe as given.

I made this pie for my bf and friend and they both thought it was really great! It set nicely and was really easy to make. I agree with the other user that this pie is a coconut CUSTARD pie, not creme. Also, something I should add (and is the reason I only gave this a 4/5) is that this recipe makes way too much filling for a 9" crust! I used TenderFlake 9" pie crust and this recipe filled TWO pies perfectly.

Taste is good but the ratio of corn starch to milk wasn’t right. Should have been 2 cups of milk to 1/3 c. Corn starch.

The person saying this is a custard pie is confused. This is a classic cream pie recipe, and it's good! That person maybe needs to Google the difference between a custard pie and a pastry cream pie, because they are wrong. A pumpkin pie is an example of a custard pie, where the egg based filling is poured into the shell and baked. In this recipe, you make a basic vanilla pastry cream, add coconut, and pour into an already baked shell. I added a little extra coconut because that's how I like it.  Top with whipped cream and a little toasted coconut. Yum!

Added a bit more coconut,  but that was it.  Tastes like an old fashioned pie.  Rich and creamy.

I'm rating this based on my changes - 1/2 coconut milk, 1/2 almond milk in place of regular milk; 1/2 maple syrup, 1/2 honey in place of sugar. Next time, I will only use 2 1/2 cups of the milk mixture to account for the extra liquids I added to replace the sugar. The taste was out of this world! My granny and my other half really enjoyed this, I will make this again. Thank you!

OMG so good!  Used 1 can coconut milk and 1 cup 2%, no butter, 1/3 cup corn starch and only 2 teaspoons of vanilla. Followed another reviewer and microwaved in 1 min increments, whisking after each. for 5 minutes total. Added 1 cup coconut , then 1/2 cup toasted coconut on top of the light cool whip

This pie is super easy and the taste is amazing! It got rave reviews from my coworkers.  I bake for them a lot and this was a favorite for sure. I did take the advice on another review and increased the amount of cornstarch. I also used 2 tsp of coconut extract and 2 tsp of vanilla.  I will be making this any time I want a coconut cream pie.

I did as COOKINGMAMA suggested, but with a Corn Flakes crust:  "This was a pretty good coconut cream pie recipe. I followed the recipe as it was written with the exception of two things: putting toasted coconut on top, and adding a little bit of water to the cornstarch (then thoroughly mixing the cornstarch and water together to prevent lumps from forming). There are a few things that I would change to make this recipe a 5 star recipe: -Use twice as much cornstarch -Use twice as much coconut inside of the pie to give the pie a better coconut flavor. -Cut the Vanilla down to two teaspoons. In my opinion, four teaspoons gave the pie too much vanilla flavor. -Put between one and two cups of toasted coconut on top of the whipped cream. The toasted coconut on the top makes the pie complete. Again, I think that this is a good pie without those changes, but it would be a spectacular pie with those changes." To avoid calories, better use the whipped egg whites as a cover.

I must agree with the first review. It tasted very good, but I was expecting a pie and it was more like a custard. Thanks for sharing!

I feel that this is more of a custard pie. I was really nervous about making this because I don't like coconut. As I was making the pie I really wanted to taste, but I can't stand coconut. In the end my little sister taste tested she loves coconut and approved. My mom even ate the left over custard.Turned out great I will make it again.

This pie was a HUGE hit! My family loved it so much, my mother told me to make one for our next holiday. it was very smooth and creamy. My sister an I had a bit of difficulty with the consistency at first (which was most likely because of the quality of the cornstarch)but after my mother went and bought a better cornstarch it looked much better. To make it look more like a cream pie I had limited options so i drowned it in canned whipped cream at the last minute. :) which made it that much tastier.

I altered the recipe, adding  one and a half cup coconut milk and one and a half cup evaporated milk rather than the three cups of milk. I put it back in the oven for fifteen minutes. It smells great. Can't wait to try it.

First of all who puts salt as an ingredient for a coconut cream pie recipe anyway, I expected it to be the sweetest pie I would ever taste; but I was way off. I was looking forward to making coconut cream pie, until after it was set with all that salt in it. Now I don't feel the same way about pie anymore, after I just opened myself to pie. The only thing that was good was the crust, coconut, and whipped topping. Take my advice and FORGET to write down "1/2 salt".

re: cookingmama's review on 11/10/03, this recipe IS a cream pie because the ingredients are placed in a precooked shell.  While the ingredients may lean towrds that of a custard, the method is what defines it as a cream pie and not custard.

I thought this recipe was too eggy and too much vanilla.  The texture was not as creamy as I was hoping for.  It was slightly gelatinous .

I'd read other reviews about the pie not setting up properly, so I increased the cornstarch to 1/3 cup.  The filling set up beautifully, and was creamy and quite good.  I spread a layer of chocolate chips over the bottom of my pie crust while still hot, and then put the coconut filling over that.  Yum!

not sure yet...i followed the instructions but was short a tad on the sugar so maybe that is what made it not as sweet as i like so next time i'll add a bit more sugar.  also, it's not very firm so after refrigerating it for several hours and not being able to cut it without it being mush, i now have it in the freezer. it tastes pretty good but not what i had in mind. i will try making this again..maybe  more corn starch...?

This was the greatest recipe, and I disagree with the statment that it is a coconut custard pie. The only thing I did different was add two tsps. of coconut extract and then two tsps. of vanilla. My family went crazy over it, and now everyone wants the recipe!

This was delicious!  I'm allergic to flour so I used a pre-made gluten-free shell.  I doubled the salt because my husband likes cream with a bite and toasted the coconut.  We also covered it with a stiff whipped cream with a splash of rum.  Can't wait for another reason to make it again.  Thanks!!

I don't know what went wrong. It just didn't seem to set like I expected to. I wasn't that thrilled with the taste either...but I keep thinking it might have been the nut behind the wheel!

Very tasty. I added a meringue topping to finish it off (I think whipped cream would make it way too sweet...it's already very sweet!) and toasted some coconut and sprinkled it on top.

This pie is almost like "grandma used to make".  It was a nice firm pie that my husband and kids loved.
