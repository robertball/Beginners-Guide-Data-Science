I made this for Thanksgiving, with changes, and it was terrific.  I omitted the condensed milk and the sugar, and made a 1/2 batch of the topping.  It was a delicious side dish with just enough sweet that you could still taste the squash.  Next time I will make with evaporated milk to save a bit of the expense.

This recipe was well-received at the dinner I brought it to.  I, however, did make quite a few adjustments.  I left out the sugar, increased the sweetened condensed milk to 3/4 cup, added another egg, some cinnamon and nutmeg and at least doubled the amount of pecans in the topping.  It was a hit, but I heard lots of jokes about hardening of the arteries because of all the yummy butter in it.  My husband says it tastes like a cross between pumpkin and pecan pie.

OH MY WORD!
This is the best butternut squash I have ever had! I made it last Christmas and probably 6-7 more family occasions since.
Everyone loves it! My mother in law actually asked ME for the recipe! Trust me, that says alot.

MMMMMM made this for Thanksgiving, it was so good I did not eat the mashed potatoes (my favorite!) so I could instead have a second helping of this! I changed it and this is what I did: 3 c squash, 2 eggs, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup whole milk, 1/4 cup butter, 2 tsp vanilla. Baked as directed. Great texture, not too sweet, still tasted like squash. My kids LOVED it too!

5 star recipe!  Absolutely wonderful!  The only thing I didn't know if it was to be served cold as a dessert or hot as a side dish.  I baked mine a few hours ahead of time so it was just warm when serve as a side dish.  YUM!  Every one of the dinner guests made a comment how good it was and asked for the recipe.  I was a little leary about the topping that goes on the top but it is a must.  The guest loved the topping.  I did cut down on the sugar as suggested by other reviewers and I did have to bake mine at least an extra half hour or more.  The end results were great.  Thanks for the recipe.  This recipe goes in my recipe file as a keeper.

I thought this recipe was amazing with some changes.  The first time I made it, I made it as written and it was incredibly sweet.  I completely cut out the white sugar and cut the butter in half.  I topped it with half a package of ritz crackers crushed.  It was easier than making the topping and not so fattening.  I got great feedback when I made it this way.  It was the dish of the evening.  I will be making it like this from now on.

Yummmmmmmmmmmm!  My five-year-old even liked this (I told him 
it was pudding).  I was out of Eagle Brand, so made my own (using the
famous Heloise recipe).  I didn't even have whipping cream, so used
evaporated milk.  I forgot(?) to put the topping on and this was still
scrum-diddly-umptious.  I'm going to do the topping next time.
Thanks Jiniwin.

I thought this was a side dish first until I added the sugar... 1 cup?!~ Oh, then I realized that it is going to dessert! =) Turned out really good, and we really liked it. (Can't make it too often, though, since my dh is trying to lose weight.  Ha)

This recipe was a hit and a miss.  People generally liked the initial taste but found it so incredibly sweet they couldn't/didn't eat much of it.  Those who didn't like squash to begin with weren't converted by this one.  The topping was really good.

This tasted fantastic!  And it got my picky 2-year-old to eat squash!!!  It was just a little too sweet for us.  I reduced the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup, and even that was too much.  The vanilla also seemed to overwhelm the squash flavor.  I will definitely be making this again, but next time, I think I will reduce the amount of vanilla to 1 tsp, and will be reducing the sugar to 1/3 cup.

Definitely a winner! I had to substitute the heavy cream with butter milk and used a bit less sugar. I also used a carnival squash, as I imagine this recipe would work well with any squash. My kids and husband loved this dish so much that I plan to make it every year and start my own family tradition of serving this sweet side dish along side our other holiday favorites. Thank you very much for sharing this recipe!

OK, but next time I'll cut the sugar way down to 1/3 C. and reduce the vanilla. And, I'll add the topping which I didn't have time to do. This is definitely a company side dish (or dessert pudding?) and disguises the natural sweetness of the squash.

I have now made this 2 times, both times with the suggestions: (1) no topping, (2) excluding the last 1 cup of sugar. The first time was because I'd been given 2 large butternut squash and wanted something to do with them. They were exceptionally well received at our pot luck and again at our Thanksgiving dinner when I used them with some acorn squash I had remaining. It is very sweet without the additions and the texture is much like a pumpkin pie without the crust. My guess is just about any kind of gourd-like squash could be used, including pumpkin.

I made this for Christmas but made some major adjustments and it was a big hit (the original recipe was tooooo sweet).  I omitted the white sugar - cut the butter down to 1/4 cup but kept everything else the same (although I did not use all the topping - just a thin spread).  IT WAS GREAT!  Thanks for the recipe - will make it forever.

This is a very good recipe, but needs adjustments as mentioned by others to remain a vegetable dish! I cut sugar to 1/4 cup and switched to brown sugar instead, cut the butter to 1/4 cup, and I will use milk next time instead of the heavy cream; also, I increased squash to 4 cups. Very good-

I made up two different squash dishes this year for Thanksgiving (Canada).  I made this one and then made just plain mashed squash in case no one liked this one.  This recipe was devoured and no one touched the other!! Holy Cow this was good!!! I omitted the sugar completely though and it was still plenty sweet-just right.  My mom says she'll never eat plain squash again.  If you're considering this recipe-TRY IT!

Magnificent. Very sweet and delicious. I made this for a fall harvest party.  Everyone gobbled it up.  I had to make copies of this recipe to send home with everyone as they left the party.

My family refuses to eat squash...until I made this and didn't tell them it was butternut squash.  It's very much like the sweet potato casseroles all southerners are familiar with.  Leave out the sugar and cream and just put a whole can of sweetened condensed milk instead.  I did add about 1/4 cup brown sugar and a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg.  I also used ground flax seed in the topping in place of flour.

This is a delicious dish! It will definitely appear on my Thanksgiving spread this year! Just a word of caution - I thought it was a little too liquidy. I'd maybe cut the liquids/butter just a bit. Could maybe double the topping mixture. I also added cinnamon, nutmeg & double the nuts to the topping.

This was a 5 start dish with some changes, reduce white sugar to 1/4 cup, no sweetened condensed milk and 1/2 the topping is plenty.  If you like a very sweet dish then follow recipe but my husband and I and guest found with the above changes it to be plenty sweet enough while still knowing it was sqaush!

You just don't need that cup of sugar in this recipe because the sweetened condensed milk makes it sweet enough.  I make this every year at Thanksgiving as a side dish and everyone loves it!

I made this non-dairy so I used margarine and soymilk instead and it came out great! Squash is just yummy no matter what.

This was the first time I ever prepared squash at Thanksgiving dinner. I thought it came out pretty good.  I kept asking my boyfriend to try it but he was busy with guests.  Later that night after everyone had gone home, he got a chance to try it.  He finished the whole bowl.   Didn't even leave any for me.  I guess he liked it.

I'm glad I tried this recipe before I became more health conscious, because I would never try this now.  However, knowing how amazing this is, I look forward to making it about once a year.  It's wonderful!!!  I especially love the optional topping!  I have found that it is just as good using milk in place of the heavy cream to make it just a bit lighter!  I will be trying other substitutions as well.

My husband disliked squash until he gave this one a taste. He even went back for seconds! We served it for Thanksgiving dinner. The neighbors and all the kids loved it! A+ recipe!

This was AMAZING!  The one thing I learned is to not blend with a mixer.  Blend it by hand with a spoon so that it's nice & think rather than baby food texture.  :D  Absolutely wonderful!  I made a double batch of it for Thanksgiving & love it so much that I used the rest of my squash to make us a batch of it for dinner tonight!  :D  Oh, and it was so good without the topping that I didn't even bother with that, although I know it would be even more amazing!

This was wonderful.  I omitted the sugar and it was more than sweet enough, also ommitted the heavy cream.  It was like custard.  Yummy!  This is definately a keeper.

Outstanding!  I don't consider myself a good cook and I know I didn't get things exactly right (because I had 2 cups of squash to work with) but even with eyeballing remaining ingredients it came out great and I am having trouble not eating it all!

This is SO delicious. Adjust to your taste. I used 1 C milk instead of the condensed milk and cream. Omitted butter. Used 1/2 C brown sugar instead of 1 C white sugar. Also tried it with 1/2 C milk and 1/2 C plain yogurt. I have made it with and without topping - both are good. Once, I also added three eggs and left in the oven too long and ended up with a delicious squash cake! I make this at least once a week!

This is the best recipe ever.  Yes, I realize how super sweet and full of calories it is...  I cook this for Thanksgiving and Christmas every year.  Everyone ask for the recipe, even my mother-in-law.  I double it, but dont double the toping because it makes plenty and cook it in a 9 x 13 pan.  It usually take about an hour and a half to cook at 350.

My family can't wait for the butternut squash to come in season. I seem to have to cook this a little longer than it calls but it is so delicious. More of a dessert than a side dish. It is very good.

Not so good.  I was looking for a long lost recipe and came upon this one which appeared similar.  I tried it with all of the fixes and it still came out way too sweet.  I'll have to search harder and submit my own.

I've made this for every major holiday almost for the past couple years. I've always left the one cup of sugar out of the recipe and it was plenty sweet. Always a big hit. I can never seem to make enough of it and people always request the recipe.

My first attempt at this recipe wasn't too bad at all.  =)  

The topping is deadly, and I'll leave it out the next time.  I had only a small amount and needed a large glass of milk afterwards.  It was delicious - but oh much too sweet.

I'm looking forward to making the recipe again, perhaps with some of the adjustments other reviewers have suggested.

This recipe is delicious - but incredibly rich.  If I were to make it again I would cut the sugar in half, and reduce the amount of condensed milk.  It is decadent, but you lose a lot of the natural squash flavor.

This recipe was sooooo good! It was different than the usual sweet potato casserole and everyone loved it. My husband was sceptical but after taking a tiny taste, immediately got another scoop. I'll be definitely using this one again, but only for special occasions as it is RICH! Next time I'm only using half the topping as well. It was good but a little much. Thanks!!

This recipe was outstanding.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  It served 12 of us - I used it as a sweet side dish for a holiday meal.  It was a hit and I would definitely make it again.  I only used 1/2 cup of sugar as was suggested and it was fine!

I used this recipe for yesterday's Thanksgiving 2002 feast.  My turkey was super moist, my macaroni and cheese was a huge hit, but nothing (!) received more raves and demands for the recipe than the butternut squash.  I even had guests who wanted more squash for dessert instead of a choice from several pies.  Thanks for a wonderful new Thanskgiving "tradition" dish that I'll be making for years to come.

I made 2 adjustments. Only used 1/2 cup of sugar as I thought 1 cup was a bit much. Plus instead of pinch of brown sugar I used 1/3 cup.

This recipe was yummy. I did cut back the sugar to 1/2 c and I'm glad I did, it was very sweet and more of a dessert as other reviewers mentioned. My squash was a bit smaller also, so I skipped an egg as well. We opted to omit the topping, because the recipe was a little funky written. I think next time I will use a different recipe for the topping and add it. It's a great base recipe.

I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of 1 cop of white sugar, added approximately 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice.  Next time I will use less butter since I had to use a paper towel to soak up excess after baking.  Very similar to a sweet potato casserole I have made.  Very good, more of a dessert than a side dish.

Everyone LOVES IT!  I have been making this for years and just realized I never reviewed it. I always serve it at Thanksgiving instead of sweet potato casserole to cut down on all the starches.  The only change I make is I only use 1/3 cup of sugar.  I have made this the day before Thanksgiving -- just pour it in the prepared casserole dish and refrigerate.  The next day I sprinkle on the topping and bake.  I have also doubled the recipe many times. Just watch the sugar.

I made this with a few changes. I had  an acorn squash and a butternut squash I needed to use up so I used both.  I want to tone down the sugar a bit so I made a cobbler topping instead of the sugary one. This recipe was awesome, a lot like the Cracker Barrel recipe for  Sweet Potato Casserole only better. Thank you for my new addition to our Holiday table.

When I made this I doubled the recipe. I added some flour to squash mixture to firm it a bit. I also added Cinnamon and Nutmeg to the topping mixture. My 14 year old son wants me to make it again already. Thank You for a Great Recipe :)

Four stars because I modified it.
I simplified it,  for less sugar and better mix of oils. 
I used ....
One squash, 
One can sweetened condensed milk, 
Two eggs , a
Dash of cinnamon, then 
I used Half of the  butter, and substituted the other   half  with coconut oil.

I did not do the topping.  

Done,  and it was sweet and delicious

The family enjoyed this but my stepson said it tasted more like dessert than squash.(for him this was a complete compliment). The only reason I didn't give it a five star was that it was terribly sweet. I'll try next time to reduce the white sugar. It did also take longer to cook than 45 minutes in order to set up. But it was a great complement to a pork roast.

I love this recipe. I've made it for the last 3 Thanksgivings and it's been a huge hit! I have done a few things differently to make it my own. First, I sprinkle candied pecans on the bottom of the casserole dish before pouring the squash in. Also I use the pecans for the topping and I add a dash of pumpkin pie spice to it. So delish!

WAY too much sugar!  This was actually painful for some of my family to eat.  I added an extra cup of squash.  I will reduce the amount of sugar next time.  I enjoyed the creaminess of the squash.  I will also reduce the amount of topping as mine spilled over.

I thought this recipe was excellent. I used a hubbard squash in stead and it turned out great. I made exactly according to the recipe other than that and it was delish! Thanks a lot for the great recipe it will make a yummy addition to the holiday table.

Yumm!  The first time I made this I made it as written and it was very yummy although a little too sweet.  I have made it a few times since and I completely cut the sugar out and this last time I didn't have cream so I just used a little milk (it was even skim!) and it was fabulous! Even my young kids (6,4 & 1) ate this up when prepared this way and it's a little healthier without the sugar and cream.  Thanks SOO much for this recipe!!

This is a good alternative to candied yams for the holidays.  It was good, but sweet.  I didn't use any white sugar and less butter than the recipe called for and it was still sweet but not overwhelming.  I made the topping but only used a little bit, I wish I had put more of it on because it was good and enhanced the dish.
