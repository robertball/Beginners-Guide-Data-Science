This was fabulous!  My family typically does not like pumpkin pie.  All four kids and hubby LOVED this.  We at it in one sitting. I did not use the graham cracker crust, I just made a simple pie/tart crust (w/ real butter of course) and pre baked it ahead of time.  The flavor was perfect, not too rich, extra light and melt in your mouth fluffy!  Yummmm! The pie was not as set as I would think it should be but I'm sure it's either that I didn't cook/thicken it on the stove long enough or it didn't chill long enough.  My family was so excited to try it we only chilled it for about 3 hours.  I'm making it again tonight and will chill it overnight this time, again using the pre-baked crust.  Now, how do I politely tell my in-laws that I don't want them to bring pumpkin pie to Thanksgiving dinner because we like this one better.  : )

Ginger snap cookies are a good alternative to graham crackers to add more flavor.

A family favorite. I add some fresh nutmeg and increase the cinnamon. My family has been making this for years and I was glad to see it on Allrecipes.

This was just delicious. I made for Thanksgiving today and my husband loved it. It's light and fluffy, not runny. I used a pre-made shortbread cookie pie crust and sprinkled toffee bits on top. It's not as dense as regular pumpkin pie, so it's great after a heavy meal. Thanks Mary!

my goodness, why are there all these great ratings! I've been cooking for 30 years, and this recipe lacked significant instructions ; like cooling the cooked pumpkin mix, before folding in the egg whites, no wonder one person's came out runny. Another person said it was easy?

Excellent recipe! Easy to make with pantry items on hand. Light, refreshing and delicious. My husband is raving about it. Next time I make it (which my husband demands will be soon!) I will use brown sugar in the filling. We like the complexity brown sugar brings to pumpkin pies. Thank you very much for sharing your yummy recipe!

I'm so happy to find this recipe on allrecipes.com.  My mother made this for years and years (she's been gone for 25 years)and I make it now every Thanksgiving and Christmas.  We're not fond of heavy pumpkin pie, but love this one. Try it. You'll like it.  I usually don't use a graham cracker crust but a regular baked pie crust.  Mother always made hers from scratch and wondered why anyone would buy one when they were so easy.(!)

My Mother made this pie for us every year since the fifties.  She has passed away but this recipient has been passed from family to family.  It is the only pumpkin pie my family will eat
I use a traditional single pie crust, just bake it first.

My mother used to make a pie like this but I couldn't follow her cryptic recipe. Found this and it's almost identical. High calorie and tons of sugar, awesome! This is the best Thanksgiving/Christmas pie I have ever had and it's just like my mom used to make.

My family raved about this recipe, and loved it.  The only change that I made was to use cream instead of milk.
