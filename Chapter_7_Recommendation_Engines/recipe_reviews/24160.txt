I read many of the reviews for this recipe and I took the comments that others made into consideration.  Many said that their complaint was the potatoes still being a little too hard and undercooked.  I decided to use a package of frozen hash browns instead.  The recipe turned out wonderful.  It was delicious!!  I will make this one again and again.

This recipe went over well with my family.  My husband really enjoyed it.  I couldn't find any cheddar cheese soup at my grocery store so I used a can of cream of mushroom in it's place.  I also took the advice of another reviewer and added a can of cream of celery soup as well.  I used small "new potatoes".  I microwaved them for a few minutes (5 minutes for 14 small potatoes) before I cut them up.  I used bite-sized potato chunks rather than slices and it worked out well.  I don't know if I would use the cheese next time as I didn't really notice the cheese in the sauce at all.  Maybe because I used 3 cans of soup (onion, mushroom and celery) that the chesse wasn't as noticable.  Great recipe.  Easy to assemble and to clean up afterwards.  Thanks.

It was really good.  But as many have said, the potatoes don't get cooked all the way (I even sliced em real thin).  One thing you can do to alleviate this is stick the potatoes in the microwave for 1-2 minutes prior to peeling/slicing, and thus cook them a bit this way.  

I also used 1 can each of French Onion, Cream of Celery, and Cheddar, which makes it a little more saucier and keeps the meat covered well.  

And it is very good with biscuits.

I have been making this recipe for many years in the crock pot!  Spray the crock first, layer potatoes, diced onion, salt and pepper, soup( I have used all sorts of creamed soups, prefer celery or asparagus) cheese then pork chops. Then another layer of potatoes,onion,salt and pepper, ending with cheese.
Cook on LOW  for about five or six hours. It's really simple and yummy. 
We are only two , but adjust cooking time to size of portions.

I changed things up quite a bit i sliced my potatoes almost paper thin and cubed my porkchops. Instead of a can of onion soup i used cream of mushroom and added 3/4 of a can of milk to soup mix. i layered potatoes, then soup mix, then pork chop repeated until i finished with a final layer of potatoes then soup mix baked according to temps and times then sprinkled with fine cheddar cheese. another great tip is to use just a little bit of cooking spray on the pan. My family loved this and there was nothing to save for leftovers

Loved all the suggestions, I also used shredded hash browns on the bottom, leftover pork tenderloin meat, then put Golden Mushroom soup on top, baked for 30 min, added Pepper Jack Velveeta cheese with dried Fried Onions on top and baked again for another 5-10 min uncovered.. YUMMY.. my kids added barbeque sauce to it on their plate, we loved it!

Two stars because there's nothing technically wrong with the recipe. It cooked as promised.

No stars for taste and I should have known better. I keep trying these "easy" meals that use soup for flavor and keep not liking the bland, salty results. Know your preferences before trying this recipe.

This was actually really good!  My husband says that all I ever make is chicken, so I have been trying to branch out.  I was very happy with this recipe and my husband loved it.  Will be making it again soon.  I used hash browns that I had in the freezer which made the recipe really easy and the potatoes cooked perfectly.

I took into account other reviews so I:

1.  peeled 2 large potatoes and boiled them whole for 8 minutes.
2.  Used the mandolin to get VERY thin slices on the potatoes and also sliced an onion.
3.  I baked for about 75 minutes and never touched it.

The potatoes were still not done.  I took out the pork, put the oven to 450 and let the potatoes back in for about another 30 minutes!

For the trouble and end result, I will not be making this again.  The pork chops would have been better pan fried with mashed potatoes!  Live and learn.

This is a super easy recipe! I did a can of cream of celery, a can of french onion and a can of the cheddar cheese soup. I also cooked the potatoes for 5 minutes each and then sliced them up. Everyone loved it!

This was not a big hit -- The pork and potatoes cooked unevenly - so that the pork was dried out and the potatoes still crunchy -- even though I cooked it much longer than the recipe called for.  I did like the flavor of the cheese and french onion soup together, but I won't make this one again.

Mmmm...  This was a fabulous recipe!  My very picky 3-year-old even ate some of it.  My only suggestion is to cut the potato slices VERY thin, otherwise they won't be done when the pork chops are.  We had to remove the pork chops and cook the potatoes longer on 450 degrees to get them done.  Otherwise, it's perfect!  One of the best pork recipes I've ever tasted!

I tried this recipe after reading reviews.  I put potatoes in microwave for about 6 min. on bake, seasoned them with garlic powder and  cayenne pepper , placed 6 slices of pork loin (1/2 in. thick) on top.  blended 1 can cream of onion, 1 can cheddar cheese and 1 can cream of celery soup plus a half stick of butter and spread over top.  Then baked for hour and a half at 350.  It turned out absolutely great!!  the meat was fork tender and the potatoes were like the best au gratin ever.

I too used hashbrowns since I was afraid potatoes wouldn't cook right. I had just enough frozen hashbrowns to layer the bottom of my pan, then laid four pork chops on top. I'm not a huge fan of onions so I only used about a half cup of the broth to dampen the hashbrowns. Then I mixed a can each of cream of cheddar and cream of potato soups and poured that over the chops. Baked at 350 for an hour, then bumped it to 400 for another 20 minutes because the chops weren't quite done. It came out so perfectly that I didn't need to put any more cheese on top. The bubbly sauce is quite good and definitely makes enough for another meal - perhaps over chicken or even plain boiled rice. Great recipe that lends itself to tweaking based on preference (and even better - it's a one-dish meal!) I'm giving it four starts only because it's a bit on the salty side between the pork and all the canned soup. Will definitely make again!!!

My family loved this recipe!  I sliced the potatoes thin after reading reviews about the potatoes but I'm sure microwaving them for a few minutes to par cook would work also.  This will definitely be served again!

We liked this dish very much but I made a few changes.  I boiled the potatoes with the skins on for a few minutes to speed up the baking time.  Then sliced and put in dish.  Also, I sprinkled some cajun spices on the pork chops.  The potatoes and chops were tender and very good.

I thought it was great. I will make it again...for company next time.  Be sure to cover while cooking with foil, and allow the cheese a few minutes to melt (underneath the foil) before serving.

This wasn't bad, but wasn't as good as I thought it would be either. Pretty much taste like box au gratin potatoes. And the cook time was way off we had to cook it much longer then it said too.

This is an awesome way to change up your ordinary pork chop dinner.  I seasoned my pork chops with natures seasoning salt before putting them in the dish.  It turned out very good, and I will definitely cook this dish again.  Thank you!!!!

This was FABULOUS!  It was very quick to throw together and pop into the oven.  Due to not having all the ingredients I did have to substitute.  One, I had to double the recipe for my large family.  Two, I didn't have any potatoes so I had to rummage through the freezer.  I came up with a bag of tater tots and a bag of Fire Roasted Veggies from Schwan's.  I thawed those put them in the bottom of the pan, then followed the rest of the directions, with the exception of fresh cracked pepper on the pork chops before pouring the soup!  The fire roasted veggies added some great flavors to the dish and my husband thought the leftovers were even better the next day!  THANK YOU!!

This was very good. I put 7 small potatoes in the micro for 6 minutes. 3 or 4 would have been fine. I browned the chops. Using no salt but plenty of pepper. After removing from skillet and pan still hot, I added a little bit of water and scraped the drippings, I added to the Onion and cheese soup mixture.I also used the V-slicer and sliced potatoes thin. I added some Monterrey Jack cheese prior to adding the chops. Poured soup mixture over, covered and cooked for 1 hour. Used the remaining jack cheese to melt over top. Very good. Family loved it.

This was easy and tasted very flavorful. Rather than slice the potatos I grate then so they would be very thin and cook properly. So many people complained that potatos didn't cook all the way and this fixed the problem. I added 1 cup of milk and used only half of the onion soup and added 1/2 cup of fresh diced onion. This also helped take away some of the saltiness. Cooked to and hour and u was litterly perfect!  Live his recipe. So easy to toss together. Everyone enjoyed this recipe. Tha I you for sharing. Cheddar cheese soup...genius.

This was really good.  Baking the chops this way did keep them moist.  Instead of french onion soup, I used the Healthy Choice Cream of Chicken (lower salt and fat) and one can of the cheese soup.  Seasoned it just a little bit.  I sliced the potatoes evenly using a slicer and nuked them for 4 minutes before I put them in the bottom of the pan.  I thought the soup was very thick, so I added a little milk before I poured it over the dish...don't do that...it does thin out, so my added milk was a little too much.....but still...pretty good chops.

Taste was delicious!  Very flavorful.  The potatoes weren't quite done  all the way.  Maybe try cooking them alittle before you add the porkchops!?

I have made this 3 times and for a family of 6 I had to make adjustments but they all love it!! I use boneless pork chops(10), Schwan's cheesy quick tators(in place of the potatoes), cream of cheese soup & cream of chicken soup. The kids won't eat the French Onion, so I had to change that. It has come out perfect all 3 times and it will continue to be a recipe in our house!

Used 2 cans cheddar soup and 1 can french onion.  Although the potatoes cooked well and the sauce was creamy, (cooked about 1.25 hours b/c chops were extra thick), I didn't like the taste of the onion mixed with the cheese.  Leftovers got tossed.  Used a sprinkle of shredded colby jack on the chops - this was interesting and good.  Wouldn't make again.

I was really looking forward to a cheesy recipe, but the onion soup was all you could taste.  It was good, but not what I expected.  Tasted just like as pork roast instead of cheesy.  Probably won't make it again because you could use low fat cream of mushroom soup and get the same flavor.

I also used the frozen shredded potatoes, along with a can of French onion soup and a jar of ragu double cheddar ( the store was out of cheddar cheese soup) also added a sliced onion on top of the potatoes. Added about a half cup of milk to the soup and cheese mixture before adding to the pan. Forgot to add the shredded cheese but everyone said it was good with out.. Was told I need to make it again.

All thumbs up at our house, even my picky eater!  My husband raved over this recipe, which I made as directed except for substituting hash browns as so many reviewers suggested.  My husband did say, and I agreed, that as much as we loved it, it needed just a little something more.  For the leftovers, I sprinkled on a little Mrs. Dash and it made it even better!  That was all it needed.  A few other reviewers added cracked pepper or lemon pepper.  Whatever your personal preference is, add just a little spice and this will be worthy of any company, even your mother-in-law!

This was fabulous. Although I changed a few things. I added cream of celery soup and instead of the French onion soup I used about a cup and a half onion soup. Instead of sliced potatoes I used frozen cubed potatoes with red n green peppers. The recipe turned out amazing. Even my very picky kids liked it.

I prepared this recipe exactly as it was written.  I sliced the potatoes thin and they came out perfect.  The chops on the other hand were horrible.  They were so dry it was like chewing jerky.  The flavor was good so I would be willing to try this again if I knew how to get the chops to come out more moist.  Maybe I will try it with a sliced tenderloin.

This was just sloppy due to too much soup. Next time I'm going to make this with a bechamel sauce, fresh Cheddar and sauteed onions in pork stock. And because the potatoes cook too quickly, I'll make mashed potatoes and serve them on the side.

This turned out great! I sliced the potatoes very thin and they were perfect.  I did not have any french onion soup, but used cream of celery instead. It gave a great flavor.  Visually it looked like a mess and my son said "ewwww" but after he ate a bite, he ate everything on his plate. Will be a commonly cooked meal in my home! thanks

I took what others had wrote, and went with that.  The cheese soup seemed a little too cheesy for me.  Instead, I used cream of mushroom and cream of potatoes.  Also, I substituted the potato slices with frozen hash browns.  This combination of ingrediants worked well, so I will definitely make it again.  I give this recipe 3 stars for giving me the inspiration.

This recipe was pretty good.  I had taken the advice of some other reviews and used one can of cream of mushroom soup (every store in my town seemed to be out of cheddar cheese soup!), one can of cream of celery soup, and one can of french onion soup.  This made the recipe WAY too soupy.  I also used hashbrowns instead of sliced potatoes.  It looked more like a hashbrown soup by the time it was done cooking.  I would make this again but I would only use one can of cream of mushroom soup and one can of french onion soup next time.  The chicken was very good though.

This recipe was just okay.  The pork chops were very tender and good but the potatoes were hard (I'd suggest microwaving them a bit before cooking as suggested by other reviewers).  It was a good dish but not sure I'd make again.

Excellent. Don't forget to top with cheese at the end. I did, but threw it on when we went back for 2nds. The soups made a tasty flavored gravy & great flavor. Would recommend seasoning pork chops with a bit of pepper before baking. Thanks!

This was not what I expected. It was quite salty, and I never did find the "cheesy sauce" that was in the description. I agree with the people who said it tasted a lot more like French onion soup than anything else. The pork chops were tougher than usual, too.

Well this wasn't as big a hit as I thought it would be with my husband.  He didn't like all the cheese on the chops.  I thought it was ok and thought the potatoes were great.  If you slice them thin enough and don't overlap the potatoes they will cook in the time alotted.  Guess I won't be making this one again.

I can not believe how good this tasted.  My roommate hates onions, but, loved this recipe.  Said it tasted almost like a pot roast. I will have no problem making this again.

Excellent recipe.  As another rater suggested: don't try to shorten the cooking time - even with thinly sliced potatoes you need all the cooking time stated in the recipe.

My husband and I absolutely love this dish!!! I did exactly as the directions said and it came out wonderful. The chops were a little tough but I think I just needed a little more sauce. I also added a bit of black pepper...mmm it was tasty.

This is an easy and very tasty dish, I'm so glad I have it.  I do use 6 pork chops and more potatoes.  There's plenty of sauce for it all.  This recipe will definately stick in my family. 

Thanks!

I have a 12 year old who would have pork chops every day if I let him, so I was glad to find something a little different.  I made it with 8 chops, he ate 4 in the first sitting with about 1/3 of the potatoes.  He was disappointed when the leftovers were gone.  I now make this once a week.   Thanks!

I wasn't too crazy about this.  It's edible, but it's nothing special.  I would only make it again if the ingredients were the only thing I had in the house and it would save me a trip to the grocery store.

This was pretty good, I used cream of chicken dijon soup instead of French onion. My son hates anything with onions. I also used two cans of ea. soup and poured one of ea. over the potato and then added the porkchops and poured the last two over all. Also used mix of colby/jack cheese. Will make again. Thanks for the recipe Jeff.

It didn't turn out as I thought, but that was my fault. I didn't slice the p[otatoes thin enough and they weren't cooked all the way. Otherwise, the taste was good.

I would probably add some spices or seasonings because it was bland and yes cook the potatoes a little before you add the pork because boneless dry out rather quickly and you can get stuck with some uncooked potatoes.  Thinking this would work better with chicken instead.

I had to cook it approximately 45 minutes longer than what the recipe called for. Neither the potatoes nor the chops were anywhere near ready.  The finished dish didn't look anything like the photo, but what dish ever really does?  ??

That said, once everything was cooked it tasted delicious!  It was even better the next day, after it had a chance for the flavors to mingle.  I'm not sure I would make it again.

Used red potatoes, pork tenderloin, and sharp cheddar (cause that's what I had).  Seasoned the potatoes with salt and pepper and a few dabs of butter. Tasted great.

I loved the sauce on the potatoes but cheese and pork just doesn't work in my opinion.  I microwaved the potatoes for 6 min, sliced with mandolin and they were perfect.  My chops were 1" thick and they were overdone after an hour. If I made it again I would only change the baking time... 45 min. My family didn't like it so I probably wouldn't make it again.

It was easy and delicious.  I used bone in  pork chops as that is what I had. The only problem was it took an additional 20 min for the pork to be done. ( no longer pink.  I do not like pink pork).  This may have been because of the bone in pork chops.  Otherwise I recommend his recipe. My parents especially loved  it.

The flavor was good, but I put in too many potatoes and many of them were under cooked.  Will try again in the slow cooker and not use "4" potatoes if the ones purchased are  a decent size and only use enough to cover a couple of layers.

I thought it was too ‘soupy” and rather blah tasting, needed some onions and seasoning.  I think I sliced my potatoes too thick and the didn’t get quite done.  Not a keeper for me.  Sorry

I added Uncle Joe's seasoning sprinkled on top of potatoes and pork and added 1/2 cup sour cream to soup mixture and poured over top. It was excellant! Definitely will be making this again. Next time will be adding more potatoes  or an additional vegetable like chopped carrots.

This dish went over well with my family. My local store was out of canned french onion soup, so I used dry soup mix with 1 cup of water. I followed another suggestion and used hash browns. I also put a light rub on my pork chops and seared them prior to putting them in the oven. I would make this again.

There are so many recipe bloggers who have no understanding that all cooks getting these recipes do not live in the US. The common soups found in every store are not available here. The most common soups here are  Campbell's chicken noodle and cream of mushroom. As a nutritionist, one would never find an onion in my house. They start to decompose fifteen minutes after ingestion and are entirely rotted by the time they leave the stomach. It is nearly impossible to find hash browns or tater-tots, although frozen french fries are in nearly every store. When having breakfast at a restaurant, even those run by Americans, you will never find hash browns with the meal. I really wish people would realize that not all of us have access to packaged products and list alternatives. This particular recipe is not one of them and I've found some alternatives from posters, but so many seem to think everyone has this availability to buy things common in the US. I will make this recipe according to the comments.

We sliced the potatoes thin and fried them in a skillet before layering.  Also, we did not have french onion soup, so i softened some diced onion in butter and oil and added a cup of beef broth and a bit of thyme and let simmer for about 15 minutes.  Combining the beef broth/onion mixture with the cheddar cheese soup, we cooked the recipe the same as instructed, except at the end we added the jack cheese and french-fried jalapenos and baked a few minutes longer.  My family loved it and it's great left-over too.

A few minor changes... I browned the pork chops first, used (thawed) frozen hash browns for the potato base, put French fried onions on top of the potato layer (under the chops) and on top of the cheese layer, and added a can of cream of mushroom & chicken soup in with the other 2 cans.  So yummy... the meat comes out very tender, and the potatoes are almost like mashed by the time it's done!

This dish was absolutely delicious and a big hit with the family! I did make quite a few changes though. Instead of boneless I used marinated bone in chops. After reading some other reveiws I quartered my potatoes with the skin on and boiled them for a few minutes before putting them in with the chops. And finally I didn't use any canned soups. I made two soup substitutes from scratch on the stove. 

This dish was lovely and I will definately be making it again.

I hadn't read the comments before making this. I should of.The pork took longer than an hr. and the potatoes {which I cute very thin} didn't want to cook at all. The flavor thou was great, I have family of 4 { kids are adult age} that never all like the same thing. This they did. I will make it again but will do something different with the potatoes, the pork took a hr. and 20 mins. I did mixed cheese and added some during cooking, than more at end. This worked well

Browned the chops, then baked the whole thing (covered) for 1 hour at 400 rather than 350 to make sure the potatoes would be done.  Turned out very well.  I will make this again.

I read the comments and made two changes: 1) Yukon Gold potatoes sliced thin (softer, faster cooking) and 2) substituted Ro-Tel Tomatoes (partially drained) for the french onion soup + ground pepper medley to zazz it up.  Very Tasty!!!
Actually 3 changes if you count the Mexican cheese blend I used instead of 100% Mont Jack

a great recipe.  my family loved it.
I did make some changes: diced the potatoes instead of slicing them, used cheddar cheese instead of Monterey Jack (I didn't have any).  Also, reading the comments now, instead of before, I can agree that some of the potatoes were not cooked through.  I would recommend microwaving them first.   Will definitely make this recipe again.

Great dinner recipe! I followed the recipe excactly as written since i couldn't find frozen already cut potatoes. I slice the potatoes really thin which helped! It did take longer to bake though - 1.5 hrs. Over all it was a hit and the potatoes tasted really great with the french onion and cheese sauce! Yummy will deff make again!

Good potatoes - not so good pork.  The two don't have the same baking time so pork is overdone when potatoes are just right.

Was very disappointed.  Flavor was good but chops were not tender and potatoes were not done after 1 hour, cooked another 1/2 hour. Finally put in to a covered roaster for another 1/2 hour.  Was ok but the sauce was like water and the pork chops were not really tender.  Only thing I did different was I had pork chops with the bone.

I read the reviews and made the suggested changes, more seasoning and cooled it longer.  Loved it.

My husband loved this!  I followed the others by peeling the potatoes but microwaving them for 5 minutes before slicing them.  I also seasoned the potatoes with garlic salt before putting the pork chops on top of them.  I didn't have cheddar cheese soup so I combined cambell's carmelized french onion soup, cream of chicken and cream of celery.  The flavor was amazing!  I have a convection oven so I wouldn't cook for the full hour next time.  I added a slice of monterey jack cheese to each pork chop before serving.  Delicious!

We liked this quick and easy meal.  I used my  Pampered chef mandoline to slice the potatoes thinly and everything cooked evenly. Flavors  blended well.

Turned out really well.  Used a small bag of frozen hash browns and seasoned the chops with lemon pepper.  Mozzarella instead of Jack because thats what we had. Buttered green beans and applesauce closed the deal!

This was good and my bf loved it. Since a lot of people said the potatoes didn't cook I just boiled them a little bit first and they came out just fine. Definitely need to peel them though. I didn't and I wish I had. Really easy to make too.

We liked the flavor a lot but I didn't read about the the suggestions until after I made it.  I used 3 large potatoes cut thin on a mandolin and they were not cooked all the way (probably because the layer was very thick).  I just microwaved the potatoes to finish them up.

This was really easy to throw together which was nice, pork chops came out real nice and tender and the potatos cooked through nicely. Only problem is it was a bit sloppy, it didn't thicken up like I thought it would.

Not a fave. The points are for ease. Husband said he could taste the cheese soup too much. We agreed it was VERY salty. I thought the pork chops turned out with a strong pork flavor. Probably won't make this again. Pork chops and scalloped potato recipe was much better and equally easy.

Great recipe! I did put it in for longer than an hour (about 1 hour 30 minutes) and flipped the pork chops after an hour and left the cover off. It would have gotten 5 stars if it had bacon in it :)

I thought this was super easy and very good.  My husband and kids ate it right up.  I only had redskin potatoes, but they worked fine and I used shredded cheddar instead of Monterrey.  I also microwaved the potatoes about four minutes before slicing them.  They were perfect.  I will definately be using this recipe again.

Only complaint- even with the cheese I poured on, this dish almost exclusively tastes of the French Onion soup. The meat and potatoes came out great, but would've liked a bit more flavor pep.
My boyfriend said he'd eat it again- I just can't imagine craving it.

This was a GREAT recipe.  After reading the other comments I cooked the potatoes for 3 min. in the micro.  I would suggest peeling and slicing the potatoes prior to micro waving . . .hot on the fingertips.  The dish has a pot roast taste to it.  My boyfriend wants me to add carrots next time.

Well..I did something  wrong.  The flavor was wonderful, but the chops were horribly tough and dry.  I know it wasn't the cut, they were boneless loin chops.  I was the only one here with teeth good enough to chew them!!  I did notice that the chops were not "in" the sauce, but above it as they baked.  I'm going to try it again next week, putting the chops in first and the potatoes on top, then flipping and serving "upside down cake" style, with a sprinkling of melting cheese as it's served.  The taste was wonderful and the potatoes were perfect.

I would make it again, but I would probably improvise and add a few more seasonings. Not a favorite, but not bad.

I doubled the recipe because I was using left over pork from a whole pig we just cooked up over the weekend.  It didn't look very appealing but it tasted good!  Biscuits would have been excellent with this!

My whole family absolutely loved this.  My 4 year old ate her pork chop and then started in on her brothers!  This one will be made again and again!  Thanks for the recipe =)

I had to improvise and use an electric skillet but it didn't change the flavor. It was easy and really didn't take that long. I will cook it again!!!!!!!!!!!

Good recipie but takes a long time preparing the potatoes and then cooking for the potatoes to be good and tender.  Still a great recipie
