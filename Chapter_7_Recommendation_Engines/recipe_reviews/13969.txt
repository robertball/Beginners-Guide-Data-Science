I made this twice last winter, and my husband and I loved it both times.  This first time I soaked the beans, the second time I bought them canned, and it made the process much easier, and tasted better, too.  I used Tofu crumbles for "meat" that was seasoned to look just like hamburger.  I even served it to my nephews (the REAL test) and they couldn't even tell it wasn't ground beef.  This is an excellent chili!

This was truly a wonderful chili.  My whole family loved it.  I used the amount of TVP called for and it seemed like way too much, though.  I would use less next time, or possibly try flavored tofu crumbles.

This is a spectacular chili, vegetarian or not. I am not vegetarian, but used to eat at the Cornucopia all the time during my lunch hour when I worked at a law firm in South Bend and always ordered their chili. (several times I was too late as they had sold it ALL) I was so thrilled to find this recipe as I have missed it ever since they went out of business. You can't go wrong making this chili even for finicky eaters. Just don't tell them it's vegetarian! They will never know I guarantee!

Very tasty. I didn't soak the beans, it saved me some time - however, those who have sensitive stomachs should soak them.

This is decent chili, but not my favorite. If you love a heavy tomato & bean base, then this is for you. The dried beans came out way too mushy. Canned beans taste much better. Also only used 1 10oz bottle of chili sauce & it still had a kick.

This was the best chili we've ever had...with some changes *g*.  We're meat eaters, so used 2lbs of ground beef.  Mmm, mmm, angus beef makes some great chili.  Left beans and seasonings the same, except for using a couple garlic cloves instead of powder.  The tomato part just seemd like too much (plus didn't have a pot big enough).  So, used 1 jar of chile sauce, the can of puree, and only one can of diced (fire roasted, mmm).  Came out thick and hearty.  If you wanted it thinner, by all means add the recommended chile and diced tomatos.  Also added some heat with red pepper flakes.  Man, this is one awesome pot of chili.  Would be perfect for a crowd.

I can't believe this recipe was on this site.  I went to this restaurant many year's ago when it was open in South Bend and loved this vegetarian chili!  I was looking for my recipe card today and couldn't find it and went online and found it on this site!  I haven't made it yet but I look forward to making it this weekend.

This really makes a ton if you don't scale it down!   I used less TVP than called for and it was still too much. Did fool everyone but was still a lot.  Mine had to simmer for about 2 hours before it wasn't too watery but had a good thick chili feel to it.

I think I might just be used to saltier meaty chili. I tried using tofu instead of TVP which I don't think helped any. The white tofu chunks don't make it look good at all. If I were to make it again, I'd add more chilli sauce and use ground beef.

I was looking for a good chili to experiment with TVP for the first time. The chili turned out great. Halved the recipe to 8 servings. We used 2/3 of the recommended amount of TVP and it was plenty thick. MSG is quite common in TVP, so make sure you choose a brand that does not have MSG! Instead, add some extra salt and hotsauce, and a good  couple tbsps of barbecue sauce to the chili. It makes things super tasty and free of questionable chemicals! Thanks!

This has been my favorite chili since I was a little girl! My mother used to work at the Cornucopia and I remember being there and "helping". Today I was delighted to be able to make this memorable recipe thanks to you posting this here. My mother thanks you for it too since she did not have it committed completely to memory. It is FANTASTIC!!! As magical as I remember it!! Thank you!
