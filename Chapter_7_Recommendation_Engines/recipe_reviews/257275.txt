Great recipe that was not only simple but quick too. I used pita bread as the recipe submitter mentioned and also added some sliced mushrooms. I wanted a little acidity to mellow the tomato paste so I added a couple of banana pepper rings on the top. I know what I'll be doing with leftover pita bread from now on. The best part is that you can change up the toppings based on what you have on hand. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!
