I made these yesterday for the grandkids, and I couldn't keep my hands off of them!  I think I made a mistake in mixing in the dry  by using my KA, because the batter was wetter than I expected, and the cookies baked up flatter than I wanted.  I, personally prefer a softer cookie, but these were very good, and I can't fault them for MY preferences.

Very good cookie, but a tad too sweet for our taste. I think I would not put in the maple syrup next time to cut the sweet. I did chill the dough to firm it up and I underbaked them...for about 10 minutes to achieve a soft center. Nice texture and nice cookie. Thanks so much for sharing Patricia

Very good, and very peanutty.  Last summer, at a 4th of July picnic, I used these cookies to make ice cream sandwiches...they were a hit!

I didn't have any syrup, peanuts, or peanut butter chips, but it was still wonderful.

Very pleased with how these cookies turned out!  My husband ate 7 of them and he doesn't even like sweets!  I found that chilling the dough in the fridge for 30 minutes helps to easily form the balls and keeps the cookies from spreading too flat in the oven.  Also I used butterscotch chips instead of PB chips because that's what I had and they were still very good.

What I didn't include: peanuts and syrup. What I  added: 1 cup chocolate chips. What I changed: 4-5 teaspoons of vanilla rather than 1 tablespoon. I also bring the eggs to room temp (in a bowl of warm water) before adding them. The result was DELICIOUS!

These are delicious! I did add an extra half cup of flour because dough was too sticky. Then I did a"drop" cookie instead if rolling them in balls. Much easier! I baked about 11 minutes. Let set to cool on pan a couple minutes before removing because they're so soft and gooey when warm!

Followed the recipe, using chunky peanut butter and ommitting adding additional peanuts.   The batter was a bit sticky but baked a sheet of them to give it a try and they were pretty flat.  Tasted Fabulous, but I decided to add about 1/4 cup more of flour and they turned out perfect.  Excellent flavor, this one goes into the recipe box for keeps!

Very yummy cookies!! Had all of the ingredients home except for chopped peanuts. Added the new "butterfingers baking bits" and some chocolate chips instead! Also swapped out maple syrup for agave syrup. I would recommend putting the dough in the fridge for a bit to make sure the cookies come out firm and don't spread out while in the oven. Easy recipe to work with!

These are the best Peanut Butter Cookies you will ever find. Don't even look for another recipe. I use extra peanut butter chips instead of crushed peanuts because I like a softer texture. Everytime I make these they dissapear right away. My husband loves them so much I named them "Will's Peanut Butter Cookies".

I did exactly as written and felt the cookie was just a passable peanut butter cookie.
