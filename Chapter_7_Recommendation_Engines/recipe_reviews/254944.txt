Really tasty, ate along side some caprese salad and some garlic bread, and it was delicious. However, the gnocchi took FOREVER to cook. Much longer than it said in the video and on the recipe. We think it was because we did not drain the ricotta because we just bought some cheap, not fancy-basket ricotta, but did not read the note about having to drain it.
So, if you do not buy basket ricotta, make sure you drain it, otherwise the gnocchi will take forever!

I had gnocchi at a restaurant once that changed my life. I never imagined I'd find a comparable recipe! I doubt I will ever buy store gnocchi again. This is so much softer and delicious! I will definitely look harder next time for the dry ricotta. My dough was a little hard to work with because of the excessive moisture.

Who knew gnocchi was this simple to make... The basil was so aromatic but like someone else said it turned brown in the blender even after blanching in warm water. No way did it look as green as chef John's. Made the ricotta from the epicurious recipe. I rolled the dough into rolls and cut it to save time rather than scooping one by one into the pan. These were super easy, quick (if you make the ricotta ahead of time or buy it) and tasty. Will be making this again and again - thank you for a fool-proof recipe!

It needs a little more flour than it says.  The puffs are huge once they are in the rolling boil.  They were good but better for a side dish.

These were fantastic and very simple to make.  My gnocchi shaping skills definitely need work. The only thing I found weird was that after I blended my egg and basil, the concoction turned brown. Not sure what happened, but it did not affect the finished product. Thanks Chef John!

i would use much less salt, maybe omit it completely.  the parmesan adds the needed salty kick.  and i added a healthy dose of ground pepper

This was the wettest recipe for gnocchi, that I thought it was labeled in error and was supposed to be a spaetzle.  I dusted the dough generously with flour in order to cut and shape them, and then it was still a challenge.  Chef John is usually right on target, but I think he missed the mark with this one.

My first batch came apart during the boiling. I scooped them on oiled wax paper lined pan and stuck them in the freezer for 30 minutes. They fared much better. So I would recommend doing them ahead of time and refrigerating or freezing for 20 mins to an hour.

The consistency was really off  but it was very tasty. My attempt to boil in batches and hold the prior batches caused it to get very mushy. Then when I attempted to brown them’ they completely lost their shape and looked more like mashed potatoes. This requires a lot of hands-on time so pair it with something that doesn’t.

Turned out great, followed the recipe exactly. Mine were green, light and fluffy. However, it’s very rich in flavor of ricotta and I’m not sure I can eat more than a couple at a time. I do think they taste better without frying but that’s just me! A perfect recipe if you love cheese and dumpling!

As the other reviews have said, the store-bought ricotta *did* have a much higher moisture content, and the gnocchi took *much* longer to cook. I also messed up and used the entire 32oz of ricotta.....soooo I ended up adding more of all the other things and making a bit bigger batch! Still, they were *great*, and wow'd the crowd.

I loved this recipe!!!
Next time I would not fry them in butter once they are done - besides that, they turned out great!

We followed this recipe to a T and ended up with a pile of sludge that wouldn't hold shape long enough to be boiled. There is some ingredient or technique he isn't fully explaining to get the same results he shows in the video. If you follow what he says you'll end up with garbage. Total waste of time and money

Made exactly as described, lots of Parmigiano-Reggiano is essential before serving these. They are kind of plain tasting but we enjoyed them! Also reheat quite nicely.

Followed recipe exactly and it was delicious! Not nearly as difficult as I was afraid it might be. My gnocchi were a little bigger than the ones in the video but still turned out fine.

This is hands down the most unsuccessful recipe I've found on the site. I followed the recipe exactly as stated and ended up with a gloppy mess that could not have been shaped by Houdini himself! Ended up driving to a fast food drive through. Ughhhhh....

We weren't able to get these to cook through by boiling, even though we boiled them 3-4x as long as recommended. So, we browned them in butter. We found them exceptionally difficult to make and basically flavorless, along with a texture that we did not enjoy. We only made a few of them, so the rest of the batter will likely be wasted.

Awesome! My husband, bless him, made these for dinner last night. They didn’t turn out as pretty as Chef John's, but they sure were delicious. Great summer meal with a green salad.
