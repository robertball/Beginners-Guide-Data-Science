delicious!!!  I use a bacon ranch dressing instead of adding all the extra fat from slices of bacon.  I think i've made this 3 times this week for lunch.  
First time I made it, I mixed it all at night and ate the next day, but the avocado will start to brown so the next time I made it, I mixed the chicken with the bacon ranch dressing, added dill and brought a container of cashews and a half avocado (add lime on it and it wont brown).  When Im ready for lunch I add the cashews and avocado, mix and its perfect!! great meal. Lower in carbs, high in proteins

With just a few changes, my fiance can't get enough of this chicken salad, and he doesn't even like chicken salad.  I omitted the cashews and ranch dressing.  Instead I used mayonaisse, some sour cream and very little spicy mustard.  I also used canned chicken breast because it's already nicely shredded, and Oscar Mayer real bacon bits.  I served on croissants, with a side of green olives and potato chips.  Perfect for picnics.

This is an incredible chicken salad, for those who don't like chicken salad! I made a few changes and it came out as one of my families favorites. I crumbled up the bacon and put it directly in the salad. And instead of the overpowering taste of ranch dressing I used some sour cream and a little bit of mayo and added a few scallions. I serve this on fresh bakery bread w/ the melted swiss and some romaine lettuce and this is mouthwatering!

I love this salad - I just add a little bit of chopped green onion to it and include the bacon (chopped) right into the salad. I don't eat it on bread (saves a little on carbs).  Wonderful lunch!

I really like the flavor of these ingredients minus the bread, blended together. For a slightly different twist, I tossed everything together with lots of lettuce, and increased the ranch dressing. Whoala!! A delicious salad.

This recipe makes a great salad. In an attempt to cut the fat and carbs I left out the cheese and cashews, and used only half the avocado. I added celery and green onions. This is a keeper. Thanks Cathy.

This was so wonderful! I made it tonight for dinner and it was a HUGE hit! I made a few adjustments. I chopped the cashews, added some fresh minced garlic, some green onion, and added 1 tsp. fresh lemon juice. I used homemade ranch dressing and just added until it was creamy enough for me. I did not use dill, just didn't think it would need it, but is probably great with it too. I spread the salad mix on toasted buns and melted shredded swiss cheese on each one. I left the bacon as optional as some of my family members don't care for bacon. This was super easy to make and delicious! It would be great on it's own or on a bed of lettuce or on rolls or breads. Thanks for a great recipe! This one is a keeper!

I like this as a salad served on greens with the baguette slices on the side rather than as a sandwich. I also prefer mayo instead of Ranch dressing, so I made my own mayo mixed with seasonings dressing. Love the combo of cashews, avocado, chicken, bacon and swiss cheese cubes-I served with cherry tomatoes and black olives as a garnish.You can adjust the ingredients to suit your own tastes.

You really have to make this and eat it right away, which is not what most people do with chicken salad. The avocados go brown really quickly, nusts get mushy, etc.

I make this for showers, luncheons and special occasions and it's a huge hit- incredibly delicious! (I buy real bacon bits and use them instead, otherwise I follow the recipe as is.) Serve on croissants for even better flavor!  Thanks!!

This is just a perfect recipe as is!  The second time I was going to make it I didn't have the same bread I used, so I boiled up bowtie pasta and basically put all the ingredients in the pasta (shredded the cheese and added a bit more ranch dressing).  Made an awesome dinner to die for!!

Really Really Good! If you are making up more than what you will eat at one time, don't forget to save the avocado seed and throw it in with leftovers so that you don't have ugly brown salad for seconds!

Yum.  Poached chicken breasts in low sodium chicken broth, cooled and shredded.  Added a little light sour cream and miricle whip to the ranch dressing to make it creamier.  Tossed avacado in fresh lemon juice to prevent ugly browning.  Lots of dill, kosher salt and pepper!  Served with sliced tomotoes, lettuce and toasted baguettes.  My mom and I really enjoyed this salad!  Thanks :)

Refreshing and delicious salad Cathy. I'll admit, I didn't use the ranch dressing as we don't really care for it, so I just went with regular mayo. I chopped the cashews very finely and added some minced onion. Gave half of sandwich a quick broil to melt the cheese. This is a keeper and thanks so much!

I usually only make the recipes with 5 stars- but this one had 4 and I made it anyway. This was excellent! I can't get enough of it. I made it for a luncheon and received RAVES!!!
I'm glad I didn't miss it!

(might i add it doesn't seem fair to change a recipe and then  rate it badly? maybe the extra ingredients or the omissions contributed to the recipe not being as good as it could have been)

Amazing!  This was spectacular- i made it for about 30 people for a bible study and it was wonderful.  I mixed the whole thing with a green salad in a bag, and served as a wrap with tortilla shells.  My grocery store didn't have very firm avacados, so instead I made a basic chunky guacamole and served it on the side.  I think this is the best recipe i've ever gotten on this site.  You can tweek this recipe in so many different ways-   Fabulous!  Thanks so much!

The texture and taste was fantastic.  I used canned chicken breasts and found the recipe to be terrific.  After an initial taste of the original recipe, I added a finely diced stalk of celery and one green onion (so as to not overpower the dill).  A slice of lettuce gave it real sandwich appeal.  The recipe's inclusion of avacado was simply genius.

I have made this many times for as few as two and as many as 20 people.  Everyone just loves it.  The salad has such a great taste I don't normally bother with the cheese or bacon. I usually end up adding some more dressing - I just start with what it says in the recipe and add until it's how moist I want it.

What a delightful combination of flavors. I will definitely make this again and again. Thank you for this recipe. It was a hit with the girls at our little tea party. Every one of them asked for the recipe.

I made this for a bridal shower, so instead of making the individual sandwiches I crumbled the bacon and cubed the cheese and mixed it all together.  Very good! (I used 2 avacados and more ranch dressing - enough to bind it together)

This recipe is awesome. Try adding grilled/chopped pineapple for sweetness/chopped dill pickle for tartness. Both my husband and son, who is a foodie, loved it.

Perfect!  Used bacon bits & bacon/ranch salad dressing- ended up using a tad of regular mayo too.  Left out the salt since the cashews were salted & with the bacon it would have been too much.  YUM!!!!!!

Indulgent but can be made lighter.   I use Nature Own's Lite Sour Dough (it taste more like white than sour dough) only 40 calories a slice.   I use lite/fat free Ranch (I prefer the taste of lite, I also increased the Dill a bit, since my dressing had less of a kick)   I use reduced fat swiss. (or skip the cheese)  For me these three steps lowered the calories and fat without altering the taste. Of course there are more dramatic steps you could take like eating it open face, skipping the bacon, or using a healthier nut (though I would avoid nuts with a strong/distinct flavor like walnuts). I would also avoid replacing Regular Bacon with Turkey Bacon. There is little difference in the calories and fat, but Turkey bacon has a ton of sodium. It's one of those foods people think are healthy but aren't.

My husband really loved this recipe.  It was very yummy, and easy to prepare.  However, I did prefer it without the bacon - and we added lettuce.  I didn't have enough ranch dressing, so I used the ranch dressing recipe from this site & it was all delicious.  Will definetely make again & again!

This was a huge hit in my house.  I made it on Sunday for sandwiches throughout the week.  I added a little lime juice so the avocados wouldn't turn brown.  I crumbled the bacon right into the salad.  For the chicken I through about 5 breasts into the slowcooker with some stock for 3-4 hours and then it shredded beautifully and had more flavor.  Only thing I'll do different is to use unsalted cashews.  Thanks for the recipie :)

I would give this one a five star but the dill was not a good flavor to add to this.  I will definitly make this again and again but without the dill.  I used this on top of a lettuce salad as well as wrapped in a warm tortilla.  Very good and easy.

I love avocado and this recipe really hit the spot! I also love dill, but couldn't really taste it as much as I wanted to.
I crumbled the bacon and added 2 avocados because that is what I had and it was a little dry....
We toasted ours with fresh crusty buns.
I think next time I will half this for my husband and I as it was just too much to try to eat in a couple of days.

This was SO delicious! In an attempt to cut back on calories, I mixed up a little lite mayo with dry Ranch dressing mix; I also only used one slice of bacon. I made these with toasted English muffins. Outstanding! Thanks, Cathy!

This was frikkin' fantastic. My husband has really middle-brow taste in food, hates avocados (and gee, nearly everything else...) and he actually liked it. I didn't add any dill, because I forgot it at the grocery store, and I would advise against using overly ripe avocados because they tend to mush up into the dressing a bit too much. I have no idea why other reviiews claimed this was dry, because it was just about perfect.

I liked this very much.  I increased the ranch dressing a little, and used basil instead of dill as my supermarket was out of dill.  
I didn't find it dry at all, I thought the consistancy was ideal for sandwiches.  And although it's on day two now the avocado hasn't started to brown, maybe the other ingredients are preserving it somehow.
Two thumbs up from my fussy husband too.

Wow, yummy Yummy YUMMY! A great combinatons of flavors. A new twist on Chicken salad. So different, so wonderful.  I used Mayo instead of Ranch and Honey Roasted cashews instead of plain (loved the sweet taste it added). I also added the bacon into the chicken mixture.
The changes were to my perference. Will make for a luncheon, it is that special, and the presentation is very appealing.

I have never been so torn on a recipe. It was good. I made as written. I did add a bit more dressing(MY husband says he has the saliva glands of a raccoon) It is good but the flavor did not pop. We after trying it added a bit of white onion.  It is good but not as good as I thought it could be. I will make again but I may tweek it.

The cashews, avocado, and chicken were all definitely interesting flavor profiles to put together and make an absolutely excellent lunch dish. I, however, did not care much for the dill, and will probably omit that in my recipe next time. I will compensate for that with added scallions (probably around 2 tablespoons of chopped scallions). I did substitute the ranch dressing with sour cream and mayonnaise like other reviewers had mentioned. Served on whole wheat toast with a slice of Monterey Jack and Canadian Bacon. Excellent.

I should have known that 1/3 of a cup of ranch dressing was not going to be enough to moisten all the shredded chicken. I couldn't taste the avacado or the swiss cheese. The bacon and cashews were a good idea but the dryness of the mix took away most of the flavour. Sorry I was ery disappointed.

I just loved this recipe.  I never had a chicken salad like this.  The only down side is it doesn't look pretty the next day, and for me I have to watch my salt and fat intake.  But I do wish I could eat this more.

My husband told me to review this as he said it was the BEST chicken salad I have ever made. I did omit the cashews as he doesn't like nuts in food. I did add curry powder and I think that made the difference. We both loved it. Will make again and again.

My husband said this was the best chicken salad I have ever made and I've been cooking for him for 30 years!  I did not make a sandwich so I just put pieces of bacon, cut up swiss cheese, and also added 4 eggs to it and we ate it like a salad.  I also used the light Ranch Dressing to save a few calories.

Good! I ended up crumbling the bacon and shredding the cheese into the chicken mixture. It was easier to serve with kids that way. I also served it on whole wheat pita bread and that worked well.

This was very good.  I found it just a little dry, but extra dressing fixes that in a snap.  I chopped and fried up my bacon then added it to the chicken mixture.  Very good.

Scrumptious! Too hard to eat as a sandwich though, it falls apart easily and I didn’t want to add more ranch because of fat. The wrap idea sounded great. For those who feel the dill is to overpowering, make sure you are chilling for 30 minutes before eating. Great, quick recipe!

Not one of my personal favorite recipies.  It isn't bad just not anything to write home about.  It seems like it needs some major flavor boost.  I added lemon to the chicken before baking and a shot of lemon to the avocado.  It still needs something for flavor.  I probably won't make again.

This didn't have enough flavor for me. I added more ingredients and it just didn't come together. Maybe the addition of some raisins or grapes.

This was excellent!  Very easy to make and tasty! We were hesitant about the dill - but it really adds a nice flavor.  Not sure how much Ranch we used - just eye-balled it.  Thanks for sharing!

The only thing to consider changing would be to add more dressing.  The flavor, textures and total package are all very good.  I tried it with sharp cheddar and Muenster cheese and it was awesome.

Sorry... This one didn't thrill me.  I like dill but didn't care for it in this recipe.  Instead of making as a sandwich, I served over a bed of lettuce with diced tomatos and additional ranch dressing on the side .  My husband and I both liked it better with cheddar cheese instead of the swiss but, it still felt like it was missing something.

perhaps it REALLY needs the bacon?  i'm not a fan of bacon, so i left it out, making this recipe just rather interesting.  it definitely needed something else, which may have been the bacon.

I made this for a bridal shower because I don't really like the traditional chicken salad with the grapes & onions (which is weird).  Everyone made a comment about how good it was.  I thought it was really tasty.  Especially because it had avocados in it.  I used 4 cans of canned chicken, 2 avocados and about 1/2 c. of  ranch dressing.  It was really dry with just a 1/3 a cup.  We used bacon and put it on a croissant roll.  Very tasty!

I used canned chicken and I think that is where I went wrong. Don't make my mistake! I love avocado and cashews but this had an odd taste. Worth trying again with a diced up grilled chicken breast, I think I would get better taste and texture that way.

I made this low carb, by rolling the chicken salad into a slice of swiss cheese.  It was very yummy, and I will make this again.  I also chopped the bacon and put it into the salad.

This recipe was FANTASTIC! its easy & delicious. I didn't include the cheese (just bc my hubbie doesn't like cheese)we loved it! I also used the recipes as a slider topper...mmm. You know, little buger instead of the chicken, it was good but not as good as this recipe!

I liked this, but thought it was rather dry so I had to add more dressing.  Also, the avocado browns the next day since there's no acid in it.

My fiance and I liked this recipe.  It was fun & easy to make, with little to no mess.  I used Light Miracle Whip instead of Ranch.  I also substitued pork bacon with Turkey bacon, used Dill spice instead of fresh dill, and I light crushed the cashews.  I recommend this recipe!

My husband loves this and it was super easy!  I didn't add the cashews, and served it on toasted sourdough,  it was terrific!  Great for a lunch or quick dinner.

This is pretty good, though was a little dry so I added a little bit of mayo.  The only thing is that you have to eat it just as written, with the bacon and the swiss.  If you run out of the bacon & swiss & try to eat it, it's not so good.

This was absolutely delicious.  I cooked up the bacon and crumbled it in the salad and served it on homeade rolls.  I didn't add the cheese.  It didn't need it.  My husband and I loved it.  Thanks so much for a great recipe.

Fabulous - I didn't have fresh dill do I just used the bottled - also didn't want to buy cashews - I'd have eaten the leftovers!! So I used chopped pecans - other than that I did as the recipe called for - very good - even better the next night where my hubby and I inhaled it all with crackers.  Truly better as it sets and gets cool. THANKS - will use this for any chicken salad recipe from now on!!

O.k.  I thought it lacked in taste.  I read other reviews and didn't change a thing based on theirs but to me, it could use a little something.

I loved it. The flavors worked well together. I used canned chicken and it turned out great. The family was skeptical at first, but they liked it too!

Pretty Yummy. I didn't wait to put it in the fridge for 30 mins and thought that it was okay but after having some the next day thought that they tasted a lot better.

This wasn't the greatest recipe although I was very optimistic given that I love avocados and ranch dressing. I added some scallions, but that really improved the flavor rather than took away from the dill. I may try this with cilantro next time. Mine turned out a little dry since I think I overcooked the chicken, but that would not have improved the flavor. Thanks for sharing anyway.

Wow! this was great... Loved it cut a tomato up where the bottom stays connected and stuffed the tomato.  I bet on a crossant it would rock to.  I added celery, onion, sweet and dill the second time and was just as great. I now prepare it half way with dressing,chicken and freeze it after it defrost I add the other stuff so it taste fresh and is so easy  Thanks Cathy

Really delicious and unusual mixture, the avocado helps keep the whole salad moist. You can definitely substitute a different type of nut - I used pecan slivers & they worked well.

i've tried variations:
* used chives instead of dill
* eliminated bacon
* topped on a bed of salad with shredded swiss
* added curry powder
advice:
* instead of ranch, use mostly yogurt with just a teaspoon of ranch
* eliminate the cashews
* cut avocado into /big/ chunks, and do NOT overmix

I wasn't fond of this.  It was very dry, so I kept adding ranch dressing, to get it to a good consistency.  I didn't have the bacon (darn husband, using it and not adding it to the grocery list), and my swiss cheese had mold on it, so maybe with those two items were the "key" items...
Noneteheless, I don't think I will be making this again.  Thanks anyway!

Really didn't like this recipe at all. The ranch was way overpowering, and the ranch dill combo didn't mix. Like others mentioned was also very dry.

I made this and ate it over three or four days.  It went well in toasted sandwiches with cheese, or pita bread, or just with a fork.  Even my cat liked it.  It tended to dry out quickly so keep the ranch dressing or mayo handy to refresh it.

This was only ok. I added about twice as much ranch dressing as recommended and still thought it was quite dry. The flavor was good, however.

This was a great recipe, and really easy. Highly recommend it.  Only thing is that I really don't like dill, but it definitely needs something in place of the dill, I just haven't figured out what yet.
