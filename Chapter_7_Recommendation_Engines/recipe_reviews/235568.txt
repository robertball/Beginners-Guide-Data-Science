I used mayo, soy sauce, lemon juice and dried basil. Yum. I even used this sauce to dunk artichoke leaves.

Really good..made it with steak..had to use some anchovie paste as that is what I had and it works well in this.  Like to have anchovie paste in the frig as it keeps a long time and is good in many applications like caesar salad Yumm. Anchovie paste comes in a tube.  Chef John  no fear for me as I love my steak well seared but RARE!

I made this recipe following the exact ingredients. I even used the same Harissa and oil from canned anchovies. I'm OCD what can I say! Anyway once again I was not disappointed. Great blend of flavors and so easy to make. It didn't have a strong fishy taste either. Just a hint if. Just right. We had it on hamburgers and it was awesome! I'm looking froward to trying it with steak.

This was great Chef!  The way you worked in a Humphrey  Bogart  theme referring to his former wife.   So this weekend I'll be searing a steak served with your sauce for our "dinner and a movie".   The "Falcon"?...'naw, save it for the  fall.  "Casablanca"?  Wait for a more romantic mood.   Ha! I got it.... "Key Largo", it is (now) hurricane season.  I do believe the cabin cruiser in that film is called the "Santana"?  I'll look it up. 
Thanks

very good! I unfortunately did not have all the ingredients called for but followed to the best of my accurateness in intention. I only had mayo. The rest of the ingredients I had on hand were pickles' water and Dijon mustard, fresh green onions, and olive oil. I put it on the side of a fillet mignon....HEAVENLY!

I made this to go with a tenderloin that we had a Christmas.  I used Siracha instead of harissa and added some garlic juice.  It was outstanding.  My family aren't anchovy fans (so they thought) and didn't flinch after I told them what was in it.

I did add capers, soy sauce, and sriracha.
Used it for blackened salmon.  Very good. Will make again.

I used the variant option, Soy, Hot Sauce, Garlic, and Lime Juice. Really jazzed up that mayo I had.

Simple but very tasty. Used left over sauce on boiled eggs. Will make again.
