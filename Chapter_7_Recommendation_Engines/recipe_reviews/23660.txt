I've been having huge problems with buttercream.  I only bake amateurish cakes for people's birthdays, but even I care what the cake looks like.  All the buttercream recipes I've used so far-- calling for all sorts of stabilizers like egg yolks and egg whites and shortening--have ultimately been melty messes.  Tasty messes, yes, but messes nonetheless.

That should be a poem.

Anyway, this frosting, like all the others, passed the taste test.  More importantly, it hasn't melted, and instead keeps its shape when piped and looks lovely and firm.  It hardens up only the tiniest bit, just enough to keep its shape, but is silky and tender underneath only the slightest crust.

Kudos on this simple but effective frosting recipe!  I look forward to trying it out with other flavors.

This was very good I work in a bakery that used buttercream frosting and this is VERY similar to their buttercream. - what I loved about it the most was that it only called for 1/2 cup butter! So many buttercreams call for margarine or shortening - yuck! and has great flavor - not overbearing sweet and very nice consistency - you can just add more powedered sugar to stiffen it or add more milk to make it creamier.  Very good and easy to make.

This is almost miraculous.  The ingredients are so few and so simple that you really wonder if it will work.  Well, let me tell you - it does.  This frosting is absolutely fantastic and incredibly easy.  It's a classic buttercream with an excellent balance of cream and sugar.  Nice texture, too.  I'll be using it to frost my sister's wedding cake.

This was WAAAAAAY to sweet even for buttercream frosting. I might make it again trying to use 1/2 of the powdered sugar.  IT looked pretty and was easy to make but just overpowering sweet.

Forget tubs of greasy flavorless expensive storebought frosting!!!  This frosting is so easy and so good.  To make the luscious chocolate frosting, if you don't have baking chocolate on hand, mix about 1/4 cup cocoa powder with 2 tablespoons of melted butter and add to frosting.

This is a good, easy recipe.  I used it to frost Mary's Sugar cookies from this site.  I had more than enough to frost all of them.  Good and buttery, just like a buttercream frosting should be (I don't get recipes that are titled "Buttercream frosting" and call for 2 cups of shortening and no butter at all....)

Finally! I keep trying to find a good tasting buttercream recipe that also makes a good decorating frosting. This is it. It was so easy to make. I measured the sugar, then sifted it before mixing. I also mixed it for about 5 minutes on medium speed. Perfect! I got tons of compliments on how light and good it was. And best is that there isn't that aftertaste you get with shortening buttercream recipes. Definitely my only frosting recipe from now on!

For a simple and easy buttercream this is quite good. It doesn't replace more involved buttercreams, but it worked well piped onto cupcakes.  One of the secrets to its success, I believe, is to beat it at medium speed for a good few minutes.

I did everything I could to mess up this recipe. I used old, chunky icing sugar. I "softened" my butter in the microwave and forgot about it and ended up with a butter puddle. I skipped the milk AND vanilla, and added instead some Mango Smoothie juice.  Oh, and all I used to mix it with was a fork - no mixers or spatulas at all!  
    Despite my best efforts, this icing was delicious (albeit slightly lumpy due to the age-old icing sugar and the fork-only mixing technique).  Definitely give the mango juice a try, I used it to ice a chocolate cake with ganache filling... YUM!

This was my first time attempting frosting, and it turned out quite well. It was a bit sweet for my tastes (but I find most frostings too sweet anyway, so it's probably just right for everyone else) so I ended up adding a couple pinches of salt at the end. You could just use less sugar, or add more butter if you don't like your frosting very sweet. I found that I had to add more milk to make it the right consistency for my use (I was frosting brownies and wanted a very thin layer), but that's easy enough to do. This sure beats the heck out of the store-bought canned stuff!

This recipe is easy and tastes great!  However, I recommend reducint the vanilla flavoring to 1 teaspoon.  Two is a bit overwhelming.

This is a wonderful basic buttercream recipe that comes out absolutely delicious and silky. Sometimes I substitute 1 1/2 TBSP coconut oil and 1/4 tsp of vanilla to get a wonderful coconut cream flavor! Thanks for a great recipe.

This is so much better than canned frosting; it didn't have that nasty oily mouthfeel for starters. I replaced the margarine with butter.

This is so EASY!  I will never buy frosting again.  It's a really sweet, so I may cut back on the sugar a bit next time, but it's a classic buttercream and I love that it has no shortening, like most of the recipes I had to sift through!

The best buttercream recipe I've found. The only change I made was to add an extra teaspoon or two of vanilla and a bit of extra powdered sugar to help it keep its shape when I piped it onto the cake. I usually don't like icing and just scrape it off when I eat the cake, but this is really good.

Awesome buttercream frosting! Yummy, buttery, and the perfect consistancy for a cake. I used it to frost my daughter's 3 layer birthday cake, but I needed a second 1/2 batch to finish the job.

A quality icing! It effectively hid how poorly my cake tasted.

You can also add cocoa powder to chocolify it. Compensate with extra liquid.

This is a very easy, simple, delicious recipe. I might add a touch more vanilla next time, and double the batch because I like a lot of frosting! Be sure to use unsalted butter.

You can cut the sweetness of this, and any other, butter-based frosting by adding a few drops of lemon oil or extract in addition to the vanilla. This is our standard birthday cake frosting. It's still too sweet for my taste, but the lemon helps and children really love it.

Very easy and simple to make. Practical and economical. Texture was not as luscious as I would have hoped, but everyone seemed to really love it! Iced a coconut cream pound cake with it, topped with marshmallow fondant, all from this site. Really good, thanks for sharing!

Very sweet but that is what buttercream is all about I guess.  I think next time I will scale back a 1/2 cup of sugar.

Great frosting!  It’s everything you want to frost a cake.  If you like frosting, you might want to double this recipe for a 13x9 size cake.

This is exactly the basic, simple, delicious vanilla frosting I remembered from my childhood and had trouble re-creating.  Very sweet, goes well with chocolate cake and sugar cookies.

I love this frosting.  If you are having problems with clumps in the frosting, it might be helpful to sift the powdered sugar before adding it to the mixture.  I used yellow cake and made cupcakes and frosted them with this buttercream frosting, and it was awesome.

Delicious! this will be my frosting my now on - no more store-bought with all the mono- & di-glycerides and other ! This was the first time I ever made buttercream and I was nervous about choosing the right one, having poured over many recipes for it, all with various measurements of the same ingredients. This one was simple and perfect.

Yum!  This is a great, fast and easy icing recipe.  Like previous reviewers, it's not a thick enough consistency to sit real pretty on a cake, but if you are icing cupcakes, the top of a cake inside a pan, cookies, etc, this is great.  Very sweet.  Thanks!

REALLY easy and REALLY fast to make. The flavor was good, but (don't lynch me) I really like the canned buttercream better. I know, it's heresy.

I wanted to eat this right out of the bowl!!  Used this to frost "simple white cake" recipe from this site.  I've only made cream cheese frosting before, so I am not sure about consistency.  Seemed kind of runny, but then hardened up after putting it on cupcakes.  Cut the recipe down to 6 servings - generously frosted 6 large cupcakes and had leftover.

This frosting tastes delicious! Unfortunantly I had a very hard time decorating with it. Next time maybe I will cut back on the milk. I needed it to be more stiff. I usually use a recipe that calls for butter and shortening. But if you only need to ice a cake with this, and not decorate with flowers, stars, borders, etc, this is a great recipe. Otherwise you may want to add milk a little at a time to get a better consistency! Great buttery flavor

Every time I've tried to make any kind of  frosting before, it was a TOTAL disaster.  This was so easy, and soooo good.  I put the frosting on 24 cupcakes for 8 people and there wasn't a single cupcake left.

I made the chocolate version, and figured that when I added the melted chocolate, the disaster would happen but it did not.     I'm not sure if order matters, but I creamed the butter, added the melted chocolate, then vanilla and slightly warmed up the milk in the microwave before I added it.  I let it mix in my mixer for a while until it began to smooth out, then slowly added the powdered sugar.  TOTALLY AWESOME!!!

ooober good! I used clear almond flavoring to keep the frosting as white as possible and because I used it on a red velvet cake (chocolate and almond...
YUM!). Super easy to make. I tried to make a half batch the second time and it didn't seem to stiffen right so make a whole batch and use the rest for um well, snacking:)

Easy, beautiful and tasty - I found it to be very sweet, but I used it on Spiced Cocoa Cupcakes which is not very sweet so it worked well.  I added about 1/4 tsp orange extract to brighten up the flavor.

This is a good basic recipe.  However, I found that the milk amount was not nearly enough, and after mixing it, I had to pour more in to get it to a spreadable consistency.  Be careful, though, not to add too much.  I probably put in about 2 tablespoons extra.

I used this frosting to frost a cake (from a mix...) for a co-worker, and it's been about an hour since we all ate the cake.  75% of my staff has now lapsed into a diabetic coma.  This frosting is SUPER sweet, so you may want to tone it down a bit.  I am going to have to do some experimenting...

This frosting is wonderful!  I made it as directed, then added some additional flavoring.  I added 1/2 tsp. lemon flavoring and a touch of yellow food coloring to use this on a lemon cake ("Lemon Cake" on this site) and it was divine!  For a chocolate cake, I made this frosting and then added 1/2 cup melted semi-sweet chocolate chips.  The texture was still great and the taste was amazing! (as my teenage daughter would say) Both cakes received high praise at the family potluck!

This is a fantastically simple but wonderfully-flavored buttercream recipe.  The balance between the butter and sugar is perfect--not too buttery, not too sweet--and the consistency came out exactly right for piping onto cupcakes without any adjustments at all.  I made a lime version of the lemon variation recommended, and it worked fabulously with the Champagne Cake I recipe on this site.  This is definitely my favorite buttercream recipe now!

Tasted store bought and not at all what I wanted.  Frosting became hard right away and was overall one of the worst frostings I have tasted in a long time.  But it was easy to make, which is why I give it a 2 over the 1 star.

This makes a very nice icing--smooth, creamy and tasty.  It also makes a generous amount.  Be sure to add the milk gradually, stopping when it reaches the right consistency.  I found it did not require the full 1/4 cup.

I've made this recipe for years. One variation: add 1/2 to 3/4 cup creamy peanutbutter and just slightly (tsp or so) more milk. Wonderful! I always put peanut butter frosting on banana cake (A-Number One Banana  Cake on this site).

There aren't enough stars in the galaxy for this one!  Three minutes to prep and perfect consistency.  Simply luscious, indeed!  I could see this frosting saving a dry cake or botched brownies.  After prep'ing, it's soft enough to drizzle from a zip-top bag if you want just a little something extra on cookie bars, and it will harden up in the fridge.  A keeper, for sure!

I only give this 4 stars because it wasn't exactly the type of buttercream I was looking...however, with that said it is a delicious and so simple to make frosting, I will be using this recipe again!  Also, I don't have any kitchen appliances yet and mixed it by hand (for 2 hours!) but it was satiny smooth when finished and I was grateful it could be done!

This turned out good! I did use less powdered sugar, but I didnt cut back on the milk so it wasnt as firm as I would have liked it to be. That was my fault though, so now I know for next time :)

This is a GREAT Buttercream Frosting Recipe!!  I used it to make three seperate cakes for my sisters' baby shower plus a test cake, and I got rave reviews from many!  Also a plus, there are no eggs in this recipe, so it is prego-safe, which is what I was looking for!  Easy to make, easy to use, tastes great!!!!

This recipe is very similar to one on food network. We used it to frost Carrot Cupcakes on this site. This was a delicious frosting! So buttery and you can really taste the vanilla. Will make again!

Followed the receipe exactly and it turned out great.  I added some food coloring for easter cupcakes.  I didn't think it was too sweet and I like the fact that it's homemade.  No more store bought icing for me.

Excellent recipe. I have made it several times in the original and chocolate flavor.  They have always came out great and I have had no problem decorating with it.  If I want a stiffer frosting I either add a little more sugar or whip it longer.

Just like you would get at a bakery.  I made it twice this week.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was a bit grainy at first, but it didn't remain that way.  Once it set up on the cake, it was fine.  Today I made it again and used less sugar, probably about 2.5 cups because that's all I had and it turned out fine.  I had no problems with it being runny and no problems spreading it.  I'm sure I will use this again and again.

This recipe was downright awful! I added EXACTLY what the recipe called for and what I got was grainy, powdered sugar goop. The consistency was not spreadable, even after refrigeration. In fact, after refrigerating, a thick crust developed and did not look appetizing. I kept taste testing the frosting each time I'd add some more butter or milk to try and make the frosting more smooth, to no avail. The powedered sugar was overpowering. 

I was pretty bummed because I printed out this recipe and used it the day I needed the cake, obviously not the greatest idea. I ended up running to the store last minute and buying good ol Betty Crocker frosting from the jar. I wasn't pleased with the result, and was a little embarrassed because I had promised the family a from-scratch recipe. Grandma's birthday wasn't ruined, but I wouldn't dare try this recipe again.

I substituted soy milk for regular milk and added 1 tsp more vanilla.  I must not have had the milk measured properly because the frosting was not runny at all .- perfectly perky!  Made a half batch to frost 12 cupcakes, worked perfectly and tastes great. A much better alternative to store-bought frosting... I like controlling my ingredients!

This recipe tasted good but the consistency was off for me...it tasted grainy (like powdered sugar). I beat it for long enough, and even tried putting the mixing bowl in a pot of warm water and then letting it re-solidify to room temperature. It might be something with the powdered sugar here being weird, though.

And, this icing was SUPER easy, if not as tasty and smooth as some other butter cream icings. It would probably be great on cookies, where the texture wouldn't be as obvious.

I made this exactly as written, and it was WAY too sweet, even for frosting. I added two teaspoons of salt, which helped, but if I make this again, I'll definitely only use 2 or 3 cups of powdered sugar instead of 4. The frosting was also too runny to spread immediately over a cake. As others said, it dripped down the sides. Fortunately, only my boyfriend and I will be eating this cake, but I wouldn't recommend using the frosting immediately on one that you want to look perfect. I think the frosting should probably sit in the refrigerator for a few hours before it would be a more spreadable consistency. This frosting wasn't a total disappointment, but it could be improved upon.

This is SO easy and SO delicious! Exactly what I was looking for - and no shortening or margarine (so no trans fats)! I followed the recipe exactly and it was the perfect consistency for frosting my cupcakes with. Everyone at work loved it! Update: I tried this with the spreadable butter with canola oil right out of the fridge, and it worked wonderfully - even better than regular butter! I think this is because it was soft, but still cold.

I made this frosting for Valentine's day to ice a cake I had made. I did the chocolate variation, and had read another cook's comment to use cocoa powder and melted butter if you don't have baking chocolate.  that part worked wonderfully! but when i made the frosting itself it didn't turn out the way that I had anticipated.  I only used about 2 cups of powdered sugar, and used only half of the milk that the recipe called for.  and i used an electric hand mixer to try to whip it up. It tasted Great and got pretty creamy, but when i went to spread it on my layer cake it sort of ran off the sides.  Not what I was looking for. So i add about a quarter cup of powdered sugar to it and it still didn't thicken up. Luckily I had bought vanilla frosting from the store to decorate the cake, and i added a few tablespoons of that to thicken up the frosting and make it spreadable. After adding the frosting it was great. but I was very disappointed that I couldn't get my frosting to the "luscious" state.  It tasted great, but I would imagine that if I had used the whole 4 cups I would still be in a sugar coma! Personally I'm not too sure if I'll be making this one again...

It spread well when warm, but once cooled it hardened a bit. I prefer my frosting a bit more soft, and though still complimentary to my lemon cake in flavor, it was somewhat grainier than hoped.

I made this for my 5 yr old's birthday cake. I hate buying frosting with the oleo base and was looking for a butter recipe I could make myself. This was perfect! It was just right for piping and added just a touch of milk for spreading. It tastes great, too. Thanks for sharing this one! I will use it from now on.

my first attempt at this frosting turned out great! I made cupcakes and needed a really good icing, and this one fit the bill. I followed it just as is, except I doubled the vanilla cause I like a stronger vanilla taste. It had a really good consistency, not too running but not overly stiff. I did use a block of margarine that I kept in the fridge overnight, so it wasn't hard, but not soft but the hand mixer had no problem with it.It was very easy to spread. I am definitely going to keep this recipe and make it again.

It was okay tasting I thought. I thought it was too sugary though, so next time I make it I'll use 2 cups instead of 4. I tried to make it taste better by adding cocoa powder which really made a big difference. I also added a heaping spoonful of lite Cool Whip to make it fluffy. I would make this recipe again using my own modifications

LOVED this recipe. Used 1/2 cup President's Choice margarine. So simple and tasty. Trick is to beat at medium for about 2-3 mins. as stated and comes out smooth. I recommend putting in fridge before using. I will use this again. All other b/cream recipes are too complicated. This one is short and sweet.

hooray! FINALLY. I've tried several different buttercream frosting recipes over the years, and have never been truly happy with any of them. they were too buttery, too sweet, too soft; never quite right. and this one is PERFECT. I just used it to frost my son's first birthday cake. I made a double batch and let it chill in the fridge for about 10 minutes to firm up a little bit, and then beat it again to make it smooth. I realized at the last minute that I was out of milk so I made a batch of powdered milk and used that - still delicious. THANK YOU!

This is the most amazing Butter cream frosting I have ever used. It has a wonderful taste, and the texture is perfect for frosting & decorating any cake. I used it on my Brother's Wedding cake, and now my son is requesting a Wedding cake for his 10th Birthday, he says it's the best cake ever.

Very good taste, nice texture.  Use clear vanilla if you prefer white icing, otherwise it will be slightly off-color...not too much of a problem if you are tinting it to decorate.  It seemed a bit stiff to me but I probably could have added a bit more milk to make it flow better for decorating...it picked up a lot of "crumb" from the cake.  Got lots of compliments on my Steelers Super Bowl cake!  Thanks!

My experience with this recipe doesn't match up to the other reviews, so definitely try this one on your own and make your own judgment.  I found the frosting tasty but very runny and difficult to spread (it just dripped off the cake).  I will probably go back to the buttercream recipe on the box of powdered sugar.

Fabulous frosting! Best I've ever had. So glad to finally find a recipe that uses butter (not Crisco) that really holds its' own. You won't be disappointed.

Great frosting!  Very easy to make - we followed the directions exactly and added some festive food coloring - perfect!  Easy to work with and spread nicely (on chocolate cupcakes), too.

This is pretty good. Not quite as good as real buttercream, which has, um, cream in it, but still mighty tasty. The chocolate version is swell too.

Very simple frosting, great for mixing into different colors for decorating! Light, creamy, and quite tasty too!
