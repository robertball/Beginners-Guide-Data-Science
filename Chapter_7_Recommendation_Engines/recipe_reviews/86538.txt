I was feeling lazy and didn't separate the egg whites from the yolks - also, I didn't have buttermilk, and once again, feeling lazy, didn't feel like making the substitute, so I used 2% milk instead.  The waffles STILL came out delicious - this has been the best tasting recipe that I've tried since getting the waffle iron - and we've tried several different recipes.

As someone who grew up on Belgian Waffles (mostly Bisquick) I have to say this is most definately a 5-star recipe.  ***** I whipped the egg whites first (used my KitchenAid mixer the whole time), that way I could use the same bowl to mix everything in after I took the whites out.  I used SmartBalance spread instead of butter and upped the cinnamon to 1 tsp or so.  I also used instant buttermilk powder & water.  **** I have a giant waffle maker that makes 4 large Belgian waffle squares at one time.  I was leary about the original yield of this recipe...only 3?  Who eats only 3 waffles in a family?  This recipe yeilded 8 big fat squares, not just 3.  Being pregnant, I ate 4 squares and my daughters each ate 3 between them...with 1 left for my hubby when he gets home.  lol! **** Anyway, this is a superb recipe.  Make sure to mix the egg whites in very well (gently).  Finding large egg white clumps is not the most pleasant experience.

I doubled this recipe. I used "soured" milk and I upped the baking powder to three teaspoons. Also, my "pinch" of cinnamon is probably bigger than your average pinch would be. Other than that, I kept to the recipe. Out of a doubled recipe, I got 12 full sized regular waffles (and that means that I used one of those four-count basic wafflemaker and none of them were cheated out of batter). These waffles were crisp on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. I served these with Absolute Best Pancake Syrup, which is also on this site. This was one of the top waffle recipes I've tried from this site, I think the buttermilk and the touch of cinnamon make this recipe.

These waffles were fantastic and very easy to throw together.  I would recommend, as some other reviewers have, of increasing the cinnamon to up to 1 teaspoon.  I didn't have buttermilk, so I just used regular skim milk and they still turned out just fine.  Delicious with cinnamon-flavoured syrup.

You'll never buy frozen waffles again! They're actually better after they've been frozen. Defrost them in the microwave then pop 'em in the toster. Just sprinkle a little powered sugar on top instead of syrup and you won't overpower the waffle. But if you must use syrup, then splurge on "real maple syrup" instead of bottle of fake "pancake syrup".

I substituted 1% milk with 1 TBS. of lemon juice for the buttermilk, increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp. and added a sprinkle of nutmeg.  They're light and tasted good.

These were very good.  I doubled the recipe and there were only two left over by the time my boys got finished with them.  I did not have time to worry about separating the eggs so just put them in whole; however I do think they would have been fluffier had I beat the egg whites as instructed.  I also increased the cinnamon (we really like cinnamon) and added a dash of fresh grated nutmeg.  We will definitely make these again.

Light, crisp, delicate.  These are very very good.  I've tried many waffle recipes and this is the only one I haven't been disappointed with.

These are the fluffiest, best tasting waffles ever! I use whole wheat pastry flour, which ends up having the same consistency as all purpose but is much healthier. I also use a tablespoon of honey instead of sugar.

Also, I've had success using half milk half Greek yogurt/sour cream if I don't have any buttermilk on hand.

I was actually very dissapointed with this recipe- it's not that it didn't taste good- as far as home made waffles go it's ok- but I usually make whole grain waffles with a quarter of the fat and healthy flour and oats- nutritionally way better for you and the taste of those waffles are far superior to this recipe- I was expecting something miraculous tasting with all the white flour and butter and it just fell flat for me

Don't judge by the somewhat unappetizing picture - these are WONDERFUL!!! We loved them and will definitely be making them many times. My only addition - used about 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon instead of a pinch, and could have used even more. Terrific!!!!!

I can't tell you how many times I've made these waffles, they have been a definite mainstay for at least a year. Their only drawback is that they use 4 bowls to make this and it takes a while with the melting and whipping but they always turn out great!

This is the first Belgian Waffle recipe I have ever tried and it was delicious...light, fluffy, and crispy.  I used King Arthur Unbleached White Wheat flour.  It is a lighter, milder 100% whole wheat flour and my family didn't notice it wasn't bleached, all-purpose flour.  This is definitely a keeper!  I don't feel the need to try any other Belgian Waffle recipes.

I really liked the way these turned out. I had seen a small package of belgian waffles last weekend at a wholesale club for like six dollars and was determined to make my own. I liked how easy the recipe was to follow. I did dirty quite a few dishes, but they were small bowls for the most part. I didn't have buttermilk so I made a mock buttermilk and it worked fine. I sprayed the waffle maker with pan spray and had no problems with them cooking. I followed the method suggested, in the recipe, to wait until the steam subsides. the recipe made 4 waffles in my round waffle maker. I ate 3/4 of one plain and was full. They aren't really sweet, but so many things can be added to them. Edit note: I froze the rest in a ziplock bag and they taste great, from the toaster, esp. with fruit sauces and whipped cream. Next time I will more likely make extra, while I already have the waffle maker out, to freeze for later.

This was my first time making Belgian waffles and beating the egg whites separately before incorporating them into the batter.  They were light, but still had substance and had a great crisp to them.  The cinnamon was subtle, not overpowering, but still noticeable.  These were a huge hit in this house and a recipe that will be used again.  Just a note, I doubled the recipe for my family of 5 and got 7 waffles.

Very good. Fluffy in texture. I'm use to crispy waffles. I think I will just cook them longer to accommodate for that.

I omitted the cinnamon and added a tad more vanilla. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing. The stiff egg whites really make these airy and melt in your mouth. My husband asked for seconds and thirds!! I will be making these divine waffles again and again!

One of the better recipes I have tried. I like this one because it is not so heavy on the baking soda. I used half whole wheat flour, half all purpose, and I whipped the egg whites, which really made a difference in texture.

Good recipe.  I compared the taste of the waffles to the taste of waffles made from a boxed mix and they were almost identicle.  I did substitute  2% milk in place of the buttermilk.

I have used a lot of mixes and recipes for waffles, but this is the best. Even people who are not really waffle fans devour these in minutes. I always use 1 tsp of cinnamon. These are so fluffy with a light crust on the outside. Perfect!

The waffles were really good except that I felt that Belgian waffles should be slightly crunchy on the outside and chewy soft inside.  While almost all other waffle batters I've used have delivered the slightly crunchy outside, this end result from this recipe was an excellent tasting waffle, but not the right consistency.

Yum! I didn't have buttermilk so I made my own: 1 tablespoon of lemon juice plus enough milk to equal one cup total. Let it sit for 10 minutes. I also used 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon instead of a pinch, but it could have used more and wouldn't have been overpowering. I actually doubled the recipe for our family of 5 and it made a total of 8 waffles. Topped them with whipped cream, a Nutella/milk sauce and strawberries. My son loved it as his birthday breakfast! Yummy, yummy, yummy!

Between this recipe and Emmas Begian Waffle recipe (this site), I believe I found perfection. I only used 1 "jumbo" egg. Added 1/8 C of cornstarch to flour for crispy outside. Didn't bother with baking soda. Used 3 tblsp Splenda type sweetner (2 blended with egg yolk mix and 1 with egg white while whipping). I let my batter rest for at least 30 minutes or up to an hour. Also, only a pinch of cinnamon? I used 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp fresh grated nutmeg. Yea yea, I did alter somewhat but...I get no fail waffles every single time! Light, crispy, a touch sweet and very yummy. Now my mouth is watering! LOL

These waffles were great. Light, fluffy and crispy without being crunchy or hard. I use 2% milk but will try buttermilk next time, just to taste the difference. I actually was just looking for a basic waffle recipe and omitted the cinnamon and they still tasted perfect. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

After a long afternoon of snacking, I was looking for a nice light meal for my family.  These were super easy to make and tasted SO good.  I put chopped pecans in my husband's and he wanted me to make another batch just for him.  Very light and tender and perfect flavor!

OMG!  I am never gonna buy waffles from a store or restaurant for the rest of my life.  These are so BOMB.  I did not have buttermilk so I used milk with vinegar.  The vinegar did react with the baking powder which made them really fluffy.  Thanks for the formula.  These will be made in my home again.  Thanks again for the meal for my family.

Spectacular!  Best waffles I have ever tasted.  Take the time and whip the egg whites.  Makes the waffles the lightest I have ever had.  A little prep time, but not much and so worth the results.  My husband loved them too.  Did add a little more cinnamon than calls for as we love it.  Thanks Stephanie for a great recipe which will be used time and again.

I was looking for a recipe last minute to make breakfast for my mom and sister who were visiting from out of town.  I doubled the ingredients and it made 7 total waffles.  I used 1 c all purpose flour and 1 c Bob's Red Mill Oat Bran Cereal.  I did not bother separating the yolk/whites either.  I also put a LOT more cinnamon than the recipe called for b/c I love cinnamon.  I suggest you do too!  Thanks for the recipe.

They are very easy to make and smell really good. However they were way to greasy and did not taste like cinnamon AT ALL. They almost had no taste at all, our syrup is what saved it.

I followed the recipe exactly and these waffles came out perfectly!  They are light and fluffy on the inside and crunchy brown on the outside. The cinnamon pushes them over the top. I wouldn't change at thing! Outstanding; I will be making only these from now on!!

These were great for a quick bread being as most other Belgian waffle recipes call for yeast and rising (which in my world means I am being eaten by hungry children who can't wait).  We had a problem with it seeming a little strong on the baking powder taste, honestly I didn't have a problem but others claimed to taste it...  The batter was VERY runny but we tried it anyway. WOW!  Totally unexpected fluffy beautiful waffles.  I use a WaringPro restaurant style double waffle iron~ I have used several others and never had as much success as I do with this so if it doesn't work out, it might be your machine. We served ours with home made "honey syrup" also from this site and sprinkle of powder sugar.  May play with it a little to adjust the soda taste which again, I didn't taste at all.  LoL

Super good!   I didn't separate the eggs and I upped the amt of cinnamon to 1/2 tsp. I wanted to take a picture but couldn't.  They went too fast. Well done!  Nice recipe.

These were great!!! I did not separate the egg yolks from the whites just mixed the wet ingredients and the dry ingredients separately then added them together.  I did up the cinnamon to 1-1.5 tsp.

Amazing! I followed the directions exactly, and the texture was perfect... Fluffy and crisp. My only addition was to add the full 1tsp of cinnamon and I added a dash of nutmeg as others suggested. I doubled the recipe and froze the extras.  We will definitely make these for guests!

These were truly heavenly.  I was a bit skeptical at first at all the rave reviews because it seemed that these were just ordinary waffles with cinnamon added but boy I am glad I was wrong and that I gave them a try:)  I did up the cinnamon to 3/4 tsp and did 1 Tbsp of sugar.  Also, these made 5 belgian waffles for me.  These are too good and they fill your whole house with THE best smell ever! YUM!

First time ever making waffles. Followed recipe as written except added 1 tsp. cinnamon and used powdered buttermilk. They were very very good. Only ended up with batter for 2 batches(4 waffles each) plus 1 waffle by itself: total of 9 small waffles.  Will definitely make again!

The best waffle recipe that I have tried so far.  I used 1 full Tbsp of sugar and a little more vanilla.  Also didn't have buttermilk, so I made my own using 2% milk and lemon juice.  Also did not whip egg whites; just added them in at the end as-is.  Even with these changes, the waffles came out good.  Will definitely make these again (may whip the egg whites to see if it makes a big difference).

We made this just as it is (only substituting sour milk for buttermilk since we didn't have any), and we loved it! It was a little eggy tasting, but I think that's just because I didn't mix in the egg whites quite enough. We'll totally be making this recipe again!

These were rich, soft and fluffy with wonderful waffle flavor. The 4 stars is for the complete lack of cinnamon flavor. Increase it substantially if you desire cinnamon waffles. Otherwise, terrific recipe and one that's a keeper. Make sure you use actual buttermilk and not the home- made replacement, or you won't achieve the best results.

Easy to whip up and I had all the ingredients on hand. I thought it tasted just a tad "eggy." Could have just been the eggs I had. Will definitely make again.

These are very light and delicious!  I used 1 tsp of cinnamon to make sure the flavor came through and I used milk instead of buttermilk.  I served them with strawberry jam since I don't like maple syrup. Excellent!

I finally found a great waffle recipe! Crispy outside...soft inside.  I left out the vanilla extract on accident and used regular milk (did not have buttermilk) and they were good..I can just imagine how good they will taste when I make them according the recipe.

I made a double batch of these this morning for my husband and two of his friends.  I got tons of compliments on them and they were very filling.  I did not have any buttermilk and had to use regular milk instead.  My "pinch" of cinnamon was about a teaspoon.  These were great.

This is the second time I made these. (I always make the first batch to the authors EXACT specs, and THEN modify) All this recipe needed was a bit more cinnamon. I used a tsp, maybe even could've used more but I didn't want to over do it. Make sure to whip the egg whites and if you don't have buttermilk (who keep buttermilk in their fridge???), use either a tbsp of lemon juice OR a tbsp of white vinegar in an 8oz measuring cup and then top the remaining off with milk to get a total of 8oz. Let sit for 5 minutes and voila! buttermilk.

I am horrible at making pancakes and waffles, and these turned out perfect.  The hint of waiting until it stopped steaming worked great.  The waffles turned out crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.

Our waffle iron doesn't have temperature control.   These waffles have a very egg-y texture. They're very moist and spongy. These are not like a typical waffle flavor. The recipe says to cook them until no more steam comes out. Mine never reached a point where the moisture had been cooked away enough for the steam to stop coming out. They were dark-golden and crisp on the outside when I first took them off the waffle iron, but after 2 minutes the inner moisture made them just barely crisp. If I had cooked them longer, I'm afraid they'd be burnt on the outside and rubbery on the inside.   We found them enjoyable, but if I made the recipe again, I'd only use 1 egg in the batter and I'm not sure if I'd go through the trouble of separating the egg and whipping the whites and folding them into the batter.   If you like crepes, custard and other spongy, egg-y foods, you will love this waffle recipe.

My family loves these waffles!  They are so yummy!!  They are light, fluffy, crisp and have excellent flavor.  I add 1 Tbsp extra cinnamon, but follow the rest of the recipe to the tee.  This is the best waffle recipe that I have found.

Excellent recipe. These are easy and really delicious. Thank you!
I ran out of buttermilk and substituted Half & Half - it was fine.
I make extra and put them into the fridge or freezer. I then pop into the toaster, and my kids have Belgian Waffles any day they want them. They are great with Nutella on them too.
And if you aren't into strawberries, you can make a healthy syrup out of any berry you have on hand - fresh or frozen. 1/4 cup fine sugar (regular sugar whipped in the blender). Then add (thawed) blueberries, or any other berry on hand. Blend until liquid. Tastes really great, and good for you too!

I didn't read others review before making them, as I tend to find most people make a lot of modifications and then give it a high rating... So I made them, exactly as stated, and they were absolutely wonderful. I might increase the cinnamon next time just for more flavor, but they were great! Light, delicious, wonderful waffles! This is going in the permanent recipe file! I have read the review now and am happy to see others really didn't make big modifications... it really is a great recipe as written!

I made these last night for the first time. Amazing. Didn't split the egg yolks and whites just used whole eggs. Only thing I changed was I put more cinnamon in them and when they were all done sprinkled powdered sugar on top. Excellent. Making them for breakfast this morning.

I did modify these a bit...no buttermilk so I used plain yogurt instead and I added more cinnamon - almost double.  Plus, I added a smidege of pure orange extract.  Served with homemade black raspberry-peach jam and strawberry jam and homemade whipped cream.  The texture was great and the waffle itself had a nice flavor.  With the toppings, it was sublime.  The kids sighed with pleasure when they ate it:-)

This was the best waffle recipe I've tried so far! I even subtituted the buttermilk with soy milk and it came out great. Three boys - two of them not really into waffles - gobbled them up quickly. Very good with cinnamon sugar butter (just blend the two) and Vermont maple syrup. Will make again. Thanks!

These came out perfectly!  The only changes I made were upping the cinnamon as others suggested and I added a tbsp of white vinegar to lowfat milk since I did not have buttermilk.  I will definitely be making these again.  

Also, Others commented on the recipe making more than stated.  This depends on the size of waffle maker you have.  I have a kitchenaid pro waffle maker that does two big round waffles at a time - one on top and one on bottom.  I doubled this recipe and was able to get 5 1/2 waffles.

We have made these waffles many times. Better than any mix you can buy! For convenience, we substitute skim milk w/1 tbs. of lemon juice for the buttermilk.

I couldn't find my old waffle recipe so I had to find a new one and came across this...I have never been so thankful to have misplaced a recipe in my life... These were the Best ever.  So light and fluffy. Omg and delicious.  Only had had 2 tlbs  of butter so I added a little olive oil to it to give me more and I added cinnamon to taste but everything else was the same. great recipe, won't ever lose this one!!!

This recipe is great!! It is now my go to Belgian waffle recipe, taking the little bit of extra time to whip the egg whites makes a light waffle, crispy on the outside and light on the inside.  I omitted the cinnamon since my husband doesn't care for it, still great. Great with berries, syrup or whipped cream. I cooked a bit longer in the Belgian waffle maker to get a nice and crisp waffle. I always double the batch, they are great even frozen and put in the toaster.

Very nice.  It makes exactly 3 waffles in our small belgian waffle maker.  Hubby was concerned bc the batter was thin, but it made lovely, chewy waffles.  he went to town with the toppings:  nutella, peanut butter, butter, syrup, and peaches.  I just had peaches and a small bit of butter and syrup.  Thank for the recipe!

Yummy!!! I made these and they were gobbled up!! I added more cinnamon, so I dropped a star, don't think it would have had enough with just a pinch. I ate mine with pumpkin butter, family ate with boysenberry syrup or strawberry syrup. Delicious, will definitely be making again!!!

Very tasty! I used about 1/3-1/2 whole wheat flour in place of the all-purpose, and we love cinnamon so I threw in more than just a pinch. It didn't make too many so it was perfect for just a couple of us, but if I'm entertaining I'll double next time!

Pretty bland and tasteless compared to a regular buttermilk waffle.  My kids didn't eat more than one (1/4 of Belgian waffle).  Was very disappointed.

This was delish!  I added a lot more cinnamon than what the recipe called for and I also added about a 1/2 cup of pecans.  So good!  This is so much better than a box mix.

Although I prefer to make my Belgian waffles with yeast, this is my go-to recipe when my daughter surprises me with a request for waffles early in the morning and I don't have the time to wait for the dough to sit for over an hour. These waffles are nice and quick, and taste delicious! I make mine with 2% milk instead of buttermilk, half wheat flour and half white, and a teaspoon of cinnamon.

It's a quick and easy recipe compared to the traditional yeast-based Belgian waffle recipes. One thing I noticed is that there seemed to be a lot of moisture in the batter. My waffles came out crispy but got slightly soggy very quickly. I'll try to set my iron on higher temperature next time and see if that keeps the waffles crispy for longer. Overall it's a good recipe. I'll use it when I don't have time to wait for a yeast batter to rise.

These are fantastic! My 3 year old ate 1.5 waffles! Ususally we're lucky if he eats half. I took the advice of others and used 1 tsp of cinnamon. I also bumped up the sugar to 2 tablespoons. Perfect! And topped with cinnamon infused maple syrup-even better. Next time, I may cut out the baking soda because they didn't turn out as fluffy as I expected...gotta love cooking in high altitude:)

Wow great recipe. Only thing is, I like a sweet waffle. So I added 5 tbs of sugar and 1 tsp of cinnamon. You'll be able to eat it with no syrup.

I am not good at making waffles. Infact since I bought my iron almost 2 year ago I have barely broken into it. This said after trying this recipe, it was an instant it with my family. I did change the sugar amount to 1 tbsp and added much more cinnamon. It was really good and I plan to make it again.

These are really yummy. My husband loves them. A little time consuming, as most tasty things are, so they are a Sunday special breakfast. I made the recipe exactly the first time. The second time I added a tablespoon of pumpkin puree. It didn't change the wonderful texture and added a deeper flavor.

I gave this four stars because it was rather time consuming, but the waffles are excellent!!! My kids LOVE them, one batch is barely enough. Sometimes I make extra and we put them in the toaster over the next week, still excellent! Really great recipe!

Good.  Light and fluffy to eat, but aren't what I think of as true Belgian waffles.  They don't hold their shape well and are not as crispy on the outside as I would like.  The are not very sweet (which I like).  Would make again, but wouldn't expect Belgian waffles.

Followed the directions exactly, except for adding 1 tsp of cinnamon instead of just a couple pinches.  The waffles turned out pretty good!  I am, however, disappointed that they still didn't seem to be flavorful enough and that I couldn't get them to crisp up.  Maybe there is a secret to getting waffles crispy that I haven't heard of yet?  Anyway, the family really enjoyed them and I will be making them again (of course, by adding more cinnamon and some nutmeg)!  :)

A winner with my family. Had no buttermilk so I used a mix of yogurt, 2% and skim milk. Used a bit more cinnamon than specified.

These waffles were yummy!  Perfect for a weekend morning or when you have a few extra minutes to prepare the egg whites.  You do have to dirty a few extra bowls, but after you taste them, who cares!  We also added about 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and I ended up using about 1/2 cup fat free evaporated milk and 1/2 cup buttermilk, just to use up the evap milk.  Still delish!  Made exactly 3 in a thick restaurant style Belgian Waffle maker.  My boys loved them and said definitely 5 stars.    Great recipe, thanks!

Excellent recipe, Stephanie! I've made these waffles exactly as written (adjusted for a serving of 6) and they were wonderful--4 stars! I've also made them more to my preference by adding substantially a bit more cinnamon because I love it and it's great for controlling insulin since I'm insulin resistant. It's a big hit when smeared with pumpkin butter and whipped topping. My favorite has to be making this recipe and using a butter blend, honey, and cinnamon for the topping. Fluffy, flavorful, and so aromatic! Paired with some savory reduced-fat sausage and you've got some scrumptious eating! Thanks for sharing!

I made these using my gluten free mix and they turned out nice and fluffy still.  I left out the baking powder and soda since it was already in the mix.  More cinnamon is needed for a cinnamon flavor.

This turned out really well, but I changed it a little... used 1/2 cup whole milk & 1/2 cup buttermilk, whole eggs, added 1/4 cup sugar instead, and 1 tspn cinnamon. Everyone enjoyed them.

These were really good!  I didn't have buttermilk so I substituted 1/2 cup of lowfat yogurt and 1/2 cup of whole milk.  They were very fluffy and delicious.

Wow, wow, wow! I feel like such a beginner. I didn't know what a difference whipped egg whites could make. It was an amazing lightness. I really enjoyed and will take the extra step from now on.

I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong here, but I followed the recipe strictly, and my whole family complained that they tasted like eggs. :/

Very good, fast and easy.  I used the 1T lemon juice in skim milk as a substitute for buttermilk and 1t of cinnamon, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I used a regular waffle iron. We all loved it!  Thanks for the great recipe! Will make again for sure.

I began eating these waffles without anything on them and they were good, although, I have to admit they were even better smothered in whipcream and raspberries. I have a very picky family but everyone loved them. If you are still debating over what to make, this is the one recipe you should try!

Excellent! I have made many different homemade waffles and this recipe is the best by far. I followed the recipe exactly, no changes. I served with apple butter. Apples or any fruit would be perfect on these waffles.

I've never reviewed a recipe before, but these were so great that I just had to!  All the kids loved them, even the picky one.  I used lemon and milk instead of buttermilk, increased the cinammon and sugar a bit.  They were fantastic!

A tasty brunch recipe. I took the advice of other reviewers and added more cinnamon - 1 tsp - as well as 1/8 tsp of freshly grated nutmeg. I'll make this waffle recipe again.

I got my new waffle iron and couldnt wait to make a  batch, but i used a box mix and I was so disappointed.  I tried this recipe and everyone loved it. I like that i didnt have to wait for the yeast and mess with all that. thank you

This recipes yields a very good Belgian waffle...however even with 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, it was not at all "cinnamon-y" in its flavor.  I will try again and use more cinnamon.

I'm rating on behalf of my husband and 3-year-old daughter...they loved these! I found them a little too eggy, but they thought they were great. I agree with the poster who said the picture didn't do these justice--mine were much browner, and crispy all around. Great recipe for true waffle lovers!

Best waffle recipe I've tried.  I doubled the vanilla, cut the salt in half, and added 1 T malted milk powder for flavor.  I also reduced the buttermilk to 2/3 c and added 1/3 c club soda to make the batter even lighter.

Everyone starts salivating for these on a lazy Sunday morning. I'm all about the butter and brown sugar and always add some vanilla and extra cinnamon to the mix. The other thing I do while the waffles a waffling is whip up a peach compote to ladle on top. Yum can't wait for Sunday.

Fantastic recipe.  I would also recommend adding a little more cinnamon, but that's personal taste.  This one goes to the top of my breakfast list.
Apparently, buttercream mamma didn't read the recipe before making it because it doesn't meet her high dietary standards.  I always feel sorry for people like her - if I'm going to get run over by a pulp wood truck this afternoon, I had a great breakfast.

Thought these turned out great. They were nice and light. I used smart balance in place of butter and added chocolate chips to one batch. Recipe made 8 regular sized square waffles.

This was the recipe I've been searching for! I usually use a store mix and add milk, egg, and oil, but I wanted something that would replace that. Tried other recipes and they were NOT right. As soon as the batter touched the iron, I knew from the aroma that this was it! Light, fluffy, and delicious! Sure, it's more work than a mix, but it's worth it, and still easier than a yeast recipe. My changes are that I make the buttermilk with regular milk and vinegar, and I add a whole tsp. of cinnamon (which I add to store mix too) for extra flavor. I made a double batch to have leftovers to freeze. I might add more vanilla or a pinch more sugar next time, but these are great the way they are!

A fantastic recipe!  One tip if you don't have buttermilk.  Use regular milk and add 1-2 teaspoon of vinegar.  Let it stand for 10-15 minutes.  Also, it's important to not add the whipped egg whites until the other ingredients are mixed together.  I missed this step the first time around.  ENJOY!!!

This was wonderful!  It was cold and rainy last night and this really was comfort food.  I mis-read the sugar amount and added 1/2 cup instead of the 1/2 Tablespoon.  I feel that had I made these as written they would be fabulous too.  I will make often.  Thank you!!

My son asked for waffles this morning and since it is a holiday I  had no excuses to offer!  I found this recipe and it was great!  The waffles were very fluffy and has a nice flavour.  Not too sweet or too bland (which is my problem with most waffles).  I had to use soured milk and I did increase the cinnamon slightly (about a 1/4 teaspoon instead of a pinch).  

This recipe does take a bit of time, but well worth it.

This is my new go-to waffle recipe!

they came out delicious, I didn't have buttermilk but used homemade organic kefir, I reduced butter to 3 tablespoons, didn't have time to separate and foam egg whites. I used naturally white whole wheat flour. and added 1/6 of ground flax seeds. I will reduce even more butter next time as I feed healthy athletes teens who are limited on the amount of fat they can eat.

I've had better homemade waffles, and I've had worse.  They weren't as light and fluffy as I thought they were going to be.  Kind of dense for a waffle.  Also, I agree with other reviewers that you have to up the cinnamon.  Also, the recipe says it makes 3 large waffles...it only made 2 for me, and that was pushing it...they both had gaps in them because I was trying to stretch the batter.  Probably won't be making these again, sorry.

Yummy, yummy, yummy! Great consistency. Not hard to make. I loved the subtle cinnamon flavor that didn't overpower the waffle.

This recipe tasted exactly like what I was hoping for!  It converted well to Gluten Free waffles... I used my own GF flour blend (1/4 C tapioca starch, 1/4 C potato starch, 1/2 C brown rice flour, Plus 3/4 tsp xanthan gum), and followed the rest of the recipe exactly...well, actually, I used soured milk instead of buttermilk... but even then, the texture was amazing... crispy, chewy... delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly. The waffles were so good, light and fluffy. I made these for my three children and were all eaten up. The recipe uses common ingredients and was quick to make. This is now a family favorite.

These are delicious, but I would double the recipe next time as they do not make very many to be worth all the trouble making them. I put more than a dash of cinnamon and used plain yogourt instead of buttermilk.

I've been making Belgian Waffles for many years. If you take the time to beat the eggs and fold in these will be far and away the best you'll ever make.

Great waffles! I love the cinnamon, they're light  and taste almost like french toast, a nice twist on classic waffles. My batter was lumpy, but I think that s how it is supposed to be. I cooked mine in a standard size waffle maker until the smoke stopped and they were perfect. I made 4 1/2 waffles. Great recipe, will make again!

Very good, even without the cinnamon. In fact, I double the recipe, omitted the cinnamon, and added chopped bacon that I cooked the night before (enough to flavor but not overpower the waffles). A total hit!

This waffles are amazing - nice crisp outside. I always whip the eggs separately - Williams Sonoma has this great hand-operated egg beater which makes it a breeze. Unfortunately, this doesn't make much. I can get two rounds of waffles in our Belgian waffle maker (or 8 individual waffles). That's about one waffle short of what our 3 person family would like to eat :)

Pretty good waffles for my first attempt. I used gluten- free all- purpose flour because of wheat allergies and they turned out delicious! Before I made the waffles, I made the strawberry syrup on this site. Both of them together, Phenomenal!! A.  must.  try!!

These were excellent! My fiance and I recently received a waffle iron as an engagement/wedding gift, and instead of using the booklet's recipe(s)---which was, in all honesty, more complicated---I looked about allrecipes for a better one. This recipe made for perfect, delicious waffles. Thank you!

Call me an idiot but I actually thought these waffles were too airy and fluffy! I mean, you bite into them and poof, they're gone! I loved the taste though. And they came out crisp on the outside. But I suppose my waffle iron deserves the praise for that! Hubby loved every thing about these. I will not be folding in the beaten egg whites next time. I'll just beat everything together to decrease the fluf factor!

Left out the cinnamon and doubled the recipe. This is a very good basic waffle. Every waffle came out perfect, but I like a little extra crunch. Next time I will substitute a few TB whole wheat flour for a few TB white flour and add some chopped pecans. Thanks for submitting!

I tried this recipe and it did not come out nearly as good as everyone raved it to be.  Granted, I am a tough critic when it comes to food. I was disappointed. I also tried it with wheat fluor.  Def not going to repeat that one either.

This was delicious.  Like others, I did not seperate or mix the eggs aside, just mixed the moist ingredients in my mixer and mixed the dry ingredients in a seperate bowl, then blended them together.  I added a bit more cinnamon, about 1 tsp, still was not a strong cinnamon flavor.  Excellent recipe, will use again and again.

These waffles were amazing! I picked them because I was short on milk (I added one tsp vinegar to 1 C milk to make the buttermilk) and I sifted 2 Tbsp of cake flour into the dry ingredients. I just can't say enough about how delicious they were. And the smell could raise the dead. Almost. Try this.

We just bought a belgian waffle maker and were looking for recipes.  This recipe was perfect!  The only changes I made were to use skim milk instead of buttermilk and added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon.  We were able to get 3 and 1/4 fluffy belgian waffles.  And it was super easy to put together last minute!  Thanks!

I have tried a few waffle recipes, and this was amazing!  I substitued the white sugar for brown sugar, and then topped it off with some apple topping, so good! (apple toppings, were just chopped up apple heats in a skillet with butter and a bit of brown sugar).  Delish!

This was my first attempt using a waffle iron and I was intrigued by the cinnamon.  I used more cinnamon like many others have and I just used whole milk instead of buttermilk.  I may try the buttermilk next time and maybe less egg as the waffles are very egg-y.  Overall a great recipe.

Delicious waffles!  An easy recipe to halve for one (or even two!) people.  I made half a recipe and had leftovers for breakfast two more mornings by just popping them in the toaster.

Fantastic and incredibly easy.   I didn't have buttermilk so I used 1tbsp white vinegar and then added 1 % milk to make 1cup.   Definitely seperate the eggs because the egg whites make the waffles light and fluffy! Thanks for sharing, this ones a keeper!

these are delicious! I followed the reviews and added a full teaspoon of cinnamon. I think these taste better toasted, or eaten immediately after they are taken off the waffle iron. Mine always tend to get soft (even when I layer paper towels between each). This isn't the recipe's fault though, just my own issues with waffles. ;)

This is the best belgian waffles I have made. The recipe is easy and they freeze wonderfully. Just pop them directly on the rack of a preheated 325 degree oven for 5-8 mins. I did double the recipe, which does include 4 eggs and 1/2 butter, but it made 7 waffles. This one is a keeper!!!!

This is the perfect light and FLUFFY waffle. I'm going to try a few other recipes to see if I can find one this tasty but a little heavier/more substantial... however, if you like your waffles as light as the whipping cream on top of them, look no further.

Forgot the cinnamon, but these were still super yummy. The key is to eat them the second they come off the waffle iron.. so light and crisy! Great flavor too-reminds me of the inside of a popover.

Wow this has to be the best waffle recipe ever. They were so moist! I will never buy the boxed Belgian waffle mix again. I did use 1 tbs sugar (since I was upping the cinnamon) and 1 tsp cinnamon. PERFECT!

This recipe was extra yummy, even altered for wheat and dairy allergies. Instead of wheat flour, I used spelt, and in place of the buttermilk, I used water with 1/2 Tbs apple cider vinegar (this reacts with the baking soda in a similar fashion to buttermilk). All 5 of us loved them!

I'm a waffle novice, but this recipe worked out great! I was a little scared about whipping the egg whites, folding them into the batter, etc., but it really wasn't hard. The waffles turned out light and crispy around the edges -- very yummy with whipped cream and cherry pie filling on top!  :o)

My husband says these are the best waffles he's tasted, and that is high praise from a picky man! I made a few alterations: I substituted soy protein powder for 1/4 c. of the flour, and used half all-purpose flour, half whole wheat graham flour. I also used a tsp. of cinnamon, and a little more buttermilk, because the alteration in flour made it a little too thick at first. I have a big family, and I have to double this recipe. We love it!

Great recipe!  I too did not use the buttermilk, just used 1% that I had in house.  Also, upped the cinnamon to 1 tsp.  Made 3 waffles, just as it said.  Husband really liked alot too!

Having tried many recipes to use for my Belgian waffle maker, this one has been the best.  Especially the ease of mixing without yeast. My 4-year old loves waffles and I will make this one again.

This was a great, light recipe. I doubled it and got 5 1/2 waffles. The only reason I didn't give it 5 was that it was a bit finicky to make. The result was worth all the effort though.

Very, very good and easy.  My 4 yr. old loves them, and I'm pleased to find something quick that he will eat in the morning.  Like the other reviewers, I would definitely recommend adding more cinnamon.

I was very disappointed when I made this recipe. It is very egg-y in flavor. It also didn't crisp up even on the highest setting  of the waffle maker. I'd use only 1 egg and use more flour if I were to try this again, but I think I'll just keep hunting for a great recipe instead.

These are light and fluffy and have a good taste (I added 1 tsp. cinnamon, which was perfect for us) but as others have complained, they are very soggy with no crispness.  Dropping it in the toaster for a min. or so helped immensely but is impractical when making for a large group.  Keeping warm in the oven may help a little (200º on a cooling rack with foil loosely placed over top.)  They only made 3 waffles, as the recipe states, so I would double or triple for a larger group.  I think I'll stick with the recipe I already have and just add cinnamon to that.

Excellent taste! The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because they weren't very crispy, and we like our waffles crispier.  But the taste was phenomenal, and I will surely make these again!  The only change I made was to add more cinnamon.

Not bad, but I've tasted better.  This made only 4.5 large round belgian waffles, so if you have a big family, you might want to double the recipe.  I think I would add more than a pinch of cinnamon next time, too.

Wow, this is a very good recipe, nice and crisp on the outside, tender on the inside. My husband says rate this a 5 star!! He had 2 1/2 waffles if that says anything. And my kids actually ate this morning so that is always a plus. I liked that this had a nice buttery flavor.

I wavered between four and five stars. In the end, I give this recipe five stars, because they taste so good. The only thing I would like is to have them turn out a little crispier. I will try to add cornstarch in place of some of the flour next time, like a previous reviewer suggested, to make them a bit crispier.. I made these on a cold, rainy Southern California morning. I didn't have buttermilk on hand, so substituted skim milk with a 1 1/2 tsp white vinegar (let the milk and vinegar sit for fove minutes - voila! buttermilk substitute). I also added lots extra cinnamon (1 tsp.) and added extra sugar (about 3 tblsps.). We served with a warm fruit topping (frozen mixed berries, water, a bit of sugar, lemon juice cooked on the stove - add water/cornstarch mix in the end to thicken). Thank you for the recipe!! The whole family enjoyed.

Wonderful, the best tasting I've had, and I've tried man! It's a thick batter, but that's what it's supposed to do. It also doesn't soak up the oil so you don't have to oil the iron as much.

These waffles were the best i've had in ages!  This recipes made 7 square waffles for us, so there was plenty to go around.  I used 1% milk instead of buttermilk and had no problems at all.  We at these with maple syrup and whip cream, YUM!

I can see why people would like them but for me it was too light and airy and had too much of an egg taste.  I need a little thicker batter so I feel like I am eating something and not just air.

I have made this recipe countless times and have it commited to memory - it is so easy to make, smells so wonderful when you make them, and they taste just awesome. Want more proof - just ask the WMCC club - I made them on a weekend get-away for everyone - and they just loved them too!

Strange...but it was kinda salty.  I think the amt of salt in the recipe is wrong.  And it wasn't sweet enough.  I'm not into too much sugar, but I thought it was still missing something sweet.  But it's soft and like the rest, I added cinnamom and nutmeg to mine.  Overall, not bad, just go easy on the salt and add a little more sugar.

I just made these for a Mother's Day brunch and my guests couldn't stop raving about this from the time that they came in my front door.  I would definitely make these again.  We added more cinnamom which was a nice touch.

these were good good good....we had extra and we froze them, and for once, bothered to eat them later.  in fact, they didn't even last a week in the freezer before we got them out and ate them!  my husband wants to add more cinnamon next time, but i thought they were good like they were.

These were great!! I didn't have buttermilk so I used 2% milk but added a little bit of lemon juice to thicken it up and give it that kind of sour buttermilk flavor. These waffles have amazing flavor, definitely a recipe I'll use again!

The waffles alone were a little bland for my taste even though I added a lot of extra cinnamon.  I served them with fruit salsa and fat free whipped topping and it made for a delectable breakfast!

I tried this recipe and substitued the buttermilk for regular milk, maybe that made the difference but the taste was more like french toast.  The waffles cooked up nicely, but I was hoping for more of a belgian waffle taste.

Believe it or not I don't know much about waffles (we were pancake people growing up) but I asked for a waffle iron for christmas.  I tried two recipies.  This one was lighter and I liked the cinnamon flavor(I never pinch anything :0) but how do you keep them crispy without burning.  I have decided a cooling rack in a slow oven to keep warm until all are cooked is my next move.

I was disappointed in this recipe.  The waffles were easy to make and look nice, but they got really soggy after taking them off the waffle iron.  I cooked them the normal amount of time... perhaps these need extra time on the iron?  Anyway, the soggy consistency wasn't tasty, and neither my husband or I particularly loved the flavor.  I'll keep looking for a great waffle recipe.

I used 1 Tbsp. cinnamon as other reviewers suggested.  Didn't have buttermilk so I used skim milk with a bit of lemon juice.  I did separate the eggs and think that beating egg whites does make a difference in the lightness of these waffles.

We enjoyded this today as art of my husband's birthday breakfast. Like others, I kept the eggs whole and I subbed skim milk with a bit of lemon juice for buttermilk. I used 1 t. cinnamon (would use 1.5 t. next time). I also added diced banana to each waffle as I poured them on the iron. Yummy!

The taste of these waffles is excellent.  My only complaint is that I like a little more texture to my waffles.  These are very fluffy, almost spongy.  So, taste wise, a definite 5, texture wise, a 3, so I'll give them a 4!  They're yummy - you should try them!

These came out great! I used 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and the flavor was perfect.  They browned well and did not get soggy after sitting a while. Also, I did not separate the eggs but added them whole.

My first time making waffles from scratch.  Very easy, but the cooking time took a little practice.  I made some without the cinnamon and added blueberrues, delicious!  Later, I added a tsp of cinnamon.  Fabulous aswell!  Thanks for a great recipe!

THESE ARE SO DELICIOUS! They are perfectly soft and fluffy! This is also such a simple and quick recipe and I was able to make it for a spur-of-the-moment breakfast while being pressed for time.
I made slight modifications: I added a little bit of honey along with the sugar because our family likes to sweeten waffles with honey, and I used milk instead of buttermilk because we did not have buttermilk. They still came out perfectly!

Awesome waffles, cannot wait to make them for the grandsons, going to try adding just a bit more cinnamon and maybe a touch of nutmeg next time

I realized today we had a waffle iron and put this recipe to the test! Perfect! (Though I didn’t use cinnamon bc I didn’t want that strong flavor). Otherwise, I followed the recipe but didn’t do the separating yolks from whites— super unnecessary: still tastes delicious and looks great!

These were great!  I made a couple of minor alterations: 2 Tbsp of vinegar to sour my milk and 1 tsp of cinnamon.  They made 3x 7” round waffles using 2/3rd Cup of batter for each.

Wow! Best waffles I've ever made, and I've made a lot! I used a couple Tbl of oil instead of butter just to cut down on fat, and added 3ish Tbl of water to the egg whites before beating them. I discovered this trick by mistake when making something else. It makes the egg whites puff up huge, and they don't deflate as much when you blend them into the rest of the batter. I made this for me and my two little girls, but I will definitely double it when the husband is home because he eats a lot! So light and fluffy, and with a fantastic flavor!

Delicious recipe! I just got an All-Clad 4 square Belgian waffle maker and used this recipe to make my first batch of waffles. These were so good! This recipe made 8 waffle squares using about 1/3 cup of batter in each square. Served them with real butter and maple syrup, plus fresh blueberries on a few. I’ve saved this to my favorites and will definitely make this again.

I thought the waffles were excellent. Only negative thing is I grabbed a huge "pinch" of cinnamon, maybe, "punch" would be a better name eh? Regardless, the pinch and punch amount was not enough cinnamon flavour. Not even a microbe of flavour. Now I'm the type that loves a an explosive amount of flavours like gingerbread waffles for example. 
Stephanie recipe gets 5 stars, even the plain waffles were delicioso.

This is a light and fluffy waffle that is crisp on the outside IF you let it cook until it quits steaming.  Ignore the green light on your waffle maker and just watch for the steam to stop.  Yummy.  The beaten egg whites add to the lighter texture so don't skip this step...unless you are in a bit of a hurry, then skip it because they will still taste great!  I never have buttermilk on hand, so I always add a bit of vinegar to my milk and let it stand while I prep the rest.  I have made this many times and have always had great results.  It takes just a bit longer than using a box mix but is so much better and worth the little extra effort!

This is by far our family favorite! The waffles are light and fluffy. Just the right amount of sweetness. There are a few steps but well worth the effort. This recipe made for 10 inch waffles.

Made this twice before reviewing. First time the batter was SO wet and runny and took over 10 minutes to cook and still came out rubbery. Second time I made with 1/2cup soured milk instead of whole cup and batter seemed more typical of belgian waffle batter I think. Cooked perfect; crispy on the outside fluffy and eggy tender on the inside.  Flavor is little bland and needs more cinnamon as other reviewers suggest.

I was excited for this recipe because reviews are so good. I made it exactly as it calls. It’s good if you like a strong “egg” taste. It’s less dense than your typical waffle, it’s airy. The recipe doesn’t make very much so double it if you have more than 2 people. It was good, just pretty eggy.

I was not wowed by this recipe. My favorite waffles are ones I make from a sourdough starter, but unfortunately I don't have one going right now so I had to find something different to make. I knew they would not be the same, but these just didn't satisfy. They weren't bad tasting, and the texture was OK, but it was just that. OK. I think I need to just get on the stick and get a new sourdough starter going again.

These turned out perfect! The only change I made was I added a Tablespoon of vinegar to one cup of milk ( as a substitute for the butter milk ) and I added a teaspoon of cinnamon instead of a pinch. This recipe made 4 perfect thick fluffy waffles! These are the best waffles I’ve ever tasted!

Pretty yummy!  I did 1 tsp cinnamon like others suggested, but I actually found that it was a bit too much.  It wasn't the flavor... it was the texture, almost like I could feel the powder in my mouth after eating the waffle.  I'll lower it next time.  The egg whites made the waffle fluffier, I really liked that addition.  I used my Dash mini waffle maker, and it make 11.5 mini waffles (probably could get it to the full dozen next time).  My husband had 4 and I had about 2.  I'd make this again with some small tweaks.

These came out nice and crispy. I used about a teaspoon of cinnamon as I made a double batch. Doubling up worked great no need to add any extra.

Made it as the recipe called for, but as one of the reviews suggested I used one teaspoon of cinnamon.  They turned out perfect, just what I was looking for.

These waffles were a hit for a recent breakfast with friends who are 'waffle/pancake connoisseurs'. I was impressed on how quickly the waffles browned and yet remained fluffy.

My expectations were high for these and the final product didn’t deliver for my tastes. These came out mediocre for the effort that I put into these by whipping the egg white and folding it slowly into the batter.  My husband liked these pretty good ,but I’ll keep searching for a Belgium waffle recipe. I followed this recipe exactly as written too, with the exception of making my own buttermilk as I didn’t have the real stuff. I really don’t believe that using homemade buttermilk instead of real cultured buttermilk would have made any difference to the taste. I will not make again.

I doubled this recipe, used vanilla paste instead of vanilla extract and upped the cinnamon to 1 tsp. Topped them with butter and maple syrup, and my family gobbled them up. These will definitely be going into our weekend breakfast rotation.

I love this recipe and have made it many times!  I always freeze my buttermilk then thaw as needed for cooking and baking.  I made only minor changes to the recipe:  brown sugar instead of white and 1 tsp. cinnamon instead of a pinch.  I use 1/4 c. batter for @ 4 in. square waffle.  Cook about 1 minute.  Makes 10 waffles.  Freeze in a gallon zip-lock bag with a paper towel between layers to absorb moisture.  Thanks for the recipe!

Needed a recipe for our 4th of July brunch to keep everyone satisfied until the evening's BBQ.  This was perfect.  Made them without the cinnamon and added fresh berries and whipped cream for a festive red, white and blue version.  Everyone loved them!

Deeelicious and easy! I didn't have buttermilk so I used 1% and that didn't even ruin it! The cinnamon taste was faint but perfect. Not too sweet. Will make again and again.

These waffles were good. But I have to say, i wish the directions said to reserve the egg whites when it called for the yolks. I didn't look back at the ingredients at that time and forgot it called for egg whites. I ended up discarding the whites and had to crack additional eggs. Total bummer I hate wasting food. Otherwise, these turned out nice. It made two full-size waffles in my KitchenAid waffle maker. They took about three minutes to cook.

These are by far the best waffles I have had in a long time. Super easy recipe. As someone else commented, I also did not separate the eggs first. But I did use buttermilk. I highly recommend this recipe.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. I followed it to a T, but it was a miss. The batter was extremely running, so you couldn't  "fold in" the egg whites. It ended up being a little too airy and and didn't taste like it had much substance. But the flavors were delicious! Maybe a little more flour or less milk would fix that. Unfortunately, I do not plan on trying this again.

Pretty good, but needs a little more for my taste. I like a lot of spice and flavor in my food, and the "just a pinch" of cinnamon doesn't really do it for me. I've made this twice now, adding rather more cinnamon the second time, and it needs more. The flavor comes out best for me when I turn my waffle iron to the highest setting, so do consider that if you're aiming for maximum flavor. It's a good base for experimentation, something I look forward to doing in future--another reviewer's comment about nutmeg sounds like a great idea that I look forward to playing with.

Pairs exceptionally well with cherry preserves if you're looking to add some fruit and sugar.

My family devoured these! I doubled the recipe and it made 12 large Belgian waffles.  I skipped separating the eggs and instead whipped them, then added the other wet ingredients. Added a 1/4 teaspoon of almond extract. Perfection!!

I followed the recipe except that I used whole milk instead of buttermilk. They were slightly rubbery and had an eggy taste. I would not make them again.

Separating the egg yolk/whites makes these incredibly fluffy and delicious! They are sooo flavorful and the perfect texture. This has become my go-to waffle recipe.

Best waffles I have ever eaten! Really not a lot of work, very much worth the effort. I did not have the buttermilk so used milk with lemon juice, still awesome.

I really enjoyed these waffles. They are really soft and chewy. However, I found them to be a little too eggy for my taste so I removed one egg white; unfortunately, this made it taste less soft and also, strangely, more tasteless overall. I would definitely make it again!

We saw this recipe earlier and I promised to make it for Mother's Day brunch.  Gosh we were happy we did.  We didn't have skim milk so used 1% but other than that dutifully followed the recipe.  The waffles turned out excellent!  There is no question that we are going to make this many more times!

Made these for breakfast this morning. They cooked up nice and soft. The exterior was crispy when I removed them from the waffle maker but softened up after a few minutes... not sure why. They had a nice flavor. I added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.

Although this was a good waffle, it was so much work to get the same thing that a box of waffle mix has already in a 10th of the time.  Just add vanilla and cinnamon and you have the same thing.

Perfect recipe! A hit with the whole family! I didn't have buttermilk and used whole milk and lemon juice instead. (1c milk + 1 tbsp lemon juice). Nice, crispy, tasty! As I made them, I kept them warm in the oven at 200F. Keeper! Thanks!

The recipe was very good. My concern is that we label these type of waffles as "Belgian Waffles." I understand it will always be so. However,  there has never in history been such a thing as a "light and fluffy" Belgian waffle, prepared from batter. A Belgian waffle is made from a sweet dough, and resembles what we call Belgian Waffles ONLY in the sense that it is baked on the same type of waffle iron.

The waffles where easy to make and very good.

I did not have buttermilk, but I have been told to add fresh squeezed lemon juice to the milk to make it close to buttermilk.   I used teaspoon of cinnamon but I will use 2 next time, as I do in a pancake mix I use.  I will increase the vanilla to a teaspoon too.  But overall, a good waffle.   Mike

This recipe is down right delicious. When I made it everything went wrong. We were out of milk so I tried to sour some powdered milk. Then I accidentally read it wrong and put in way too much baking soda. Seeing my mistake I tried to scoop it out. I think I scooped out the baking soda and powder by accident. With all of these mishaps (and trying to make it gluten free) it turned out amazing! Thank you for the recipe!

By far the best waffle recipe I've tried to date! The only thing I changed was I added chocolate chips instead of cinnamon. I love chocolate chips in my waffles! I will definitely be using this recipe again!

In search of the perfect waffle recipe. This one was a great base recipe, producing really light and airy waffles.  

I had to make a buttermilk alternative by adding lemon juice to milk, and I used half white flour, half wheat flour. I also decided to throw in some some chopped pecans. Will definitely make some version of these again.

OMG by far the best waffle recipe I have made yet. Frist one is just as good as the last one that's been kept warm in a 200 oven. I tried it both ways with the egg whites not whipped and whipped. I think its worth whipping the egg whites and folding them, in makes a much better waffle.

Easiest and best Belgium waffles I've ever made according to my husband and I've been making homemade waffles for over 30 years! Only thing you should be aware of is that this recipe only makes 4 Belgium waffles, so if you have a crowd, you're going to have to make it times 4 or 5 times.

These worked well.  I would have liked them a little crispier so next time I will coat the waffle iron with a little crisco.  I just sprayed it with Pam this time and it tasted great!

Loved the taste! Out of vanilla and refuse to buy buttermilk; I used 1 C. 1% milk + 1 Tbsp. vinegar instead. I'm picky, but I'm saving this to make again!

I changed it up a bit. This time, I added 1/2 a cup of pumpkin & added a teaspoon of nutmeg & allspice & 2 pinches of ginger. I also substituted & used 2% instead of buttermilk & I added a 1/4 of cup sugar to sweeten the pumpkin flavor. I ended up having to make 2 batches. My family couldn't get enough of them!!

Absolutely loved this recipe. Made a couple as the recipe says then substituted the cinnamon for HERSHEY'S COCOA POWDER. Tasted amazing both ways. For toppings I used Icing Sugar for both types. Again, AMAZING!

Best Waffles Ever! I followed the recommendations of a few reviewers and upped the cinnamon to 1 tspn, after I put the batter in the waffle iron I added chocolate chips on top. I also made some whip cream with my kitchen aid mixer to finish this masterpiece off! Along with a little butter and syrup and a side of turkey bacon, this breakfast will be made again!

VERY good!  The only changes I made was I accidentally put 4 tsp of vanilla (doubled the recipe) and added more cinnamon. I doubled the recipe and made regular waffles which made about 8 waffles. I put some in the toaster this morning for my son and they smelt so good and came out crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. I will for sure use this for my waffle recipe.

This recipe was Awesome.  I doubled the recipe and then doubled it again because they were running low.  I made my own "buttermilk" with 1T of white vinegar with the milk to make 1 cup for each recipe.  I used margarine in place of butter.  I also added real BACON bits to a few and quickly realized they preferred these better.  I fed 6 teenage boys, 1 teenage girl, and a 10 year old boy and still had 5 whole waffles left to freeze for later.  I kept them warm but putting them in single layer in a 200 degree toaster oven.  They were crispy!!!

Easy to whip up, delicious, and freeze well. These are everything I look for in a waffle and these hit the mark. I did add quite a large "pinch" of cinnamon and they were amazing.

Turned out great. Cooked for just over 3 minutes in rotating waffle iron. Will add a touch more cinnamon next time. I did not have buttermilk, so I "made" some by adding a couple spoons of sour cream to the measuring cup and then filling it up to one cup- with 1% milk.

Another great waffle recipe from this site and also a nice alternative to the yeasted Belgian waffles.  The only minor change I made was to mix milk w/ white vinegar to make buttermilk.

These were delicious! I ignored the other reviews about the servings and doubled the recipe anyway (for me, my hubby, and 3 kids). I would say that was a mistake because it made so many (15.5 regular size waffles. Yes there was a "half"- I wasn't about to let that last little bit go to waste!), but I couldn't stop eating it and in the end there were only 2.5 left. I ate four and had to stop myself. My 5 year old ate 2.5, which is a LOT for her. She usually barely eats 1. The only thing I would change is to add more cinnamon. I could barely taste it which I thought was odd since they are called "Cinnamon Belgian Waffles." Next time I'll definitely put more.

I loved this recipe.  I had to double it since it didn't seem sufficient. I made it with ww flour since its our preference but I kept the rest of the recipe the same. It was crispy outside and soft in the inside. Really delicious.  Thanks for sharing!

I've never made waffles before but after receiving a hand me down waffle maker I was excited to try it out. I followed the recipe as stated, only I used sour milk instead of buttermilk (I never have buttermilk on hand) I thought it tasted alright but my husband said it tasted eggy. Next time I'll leave the eggs whole and add more cinnamon. I served ours with sauteed apples and it was very good, the waffles freeze well too, I think they tasted better after being toasted

Very tastey waffles. It seems best to serve them straight from the iron to the plate so they're crispy. Stacking makes them a less appealing soggy.

These waffles were fantastic. And I'm not a huge fan of waffles. I followed the recipe exactly as written. They came out perfect. My boyfriend had a second waffle. Definitely five stars :)

I made these waffles this morning for our guests, I doubled the recipe and added 1 tsp of cinnamon. I did not have buttermilk so I added 1 Tablespoon,vinegar to 2 cups of milk, added an extra cup of flour, and mixed the baking soda in with the wet ingredients. They were absolutely delicious!

Good flavor. Sweetness was nice. Maybe our waffle iron isn't hot enough but the only way they'd brown was if they burnt too. Other than that pretty good.

Oh, wow!  So happy I chose this recipe for the first time I made homemade waffles!  These were crispy on the outside, but very light.  Not at all, dense, just the way I like them!  I didn't measure the cinnamon or vanilla (tend to be a bit heavy-handed with those) and added a dash of nutmeg.  Yum!  I can't wait to make these again!  I even doubled the recipe so that I could freeze leftovers and toast them tomorrow.

I just replaced my old conventional waffle iron with a new Belgian waffle iron and this was the first recipe that I tried.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of increasing the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon.  The result was simply delicious.  

Note that in my case the recipe yielded four of the thick Belgian type waffles.  Thus I suspect that the reports of eight to ten waffles by other reviewers is due to their using a conventional waffle iron rather than a Belgian waffle iron.

This recipe was REALLY good! I used honey in place of the sugar. I also used half whole wheat flour, half all-purpose flour. I used 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, which is just right! I've made them at least 3 different times...one of which I didn't separate the eggs, and it turned out just as good.

This recipe worked out well for me.  Me and my girlfriend loved it! The only additions I added were an extra pinch of cinnamon,a pinch of nutmeg, and 1 tsp of brown sugar.  The batter came out very thin, but if you pure enough into your waffle iron, it fluffs up very nice and didn't even spill out.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.

I've made these 5-6 times now (every weekend since getting my waffle maker!). LOVE THEM! I quadruple the recipe because I have 6 kids and it makes 16 belgium waffles so there's a good amount of left overs for them to eat throughout the week. I froze them the first time but realized since they only last through the week there was no point but they did freeze and reheat quite nicely. Some tips: I use a stand mixer and start by whipping the egg whites. I then transfer them to a bowl and set aside for later. Also I never have butter milk on hand so I make sour milk to start (recommend making this your first step so it has a good amount of time to sit): 1 TBSP vinegar to make one cup milk (pour vinegar into measuring cup and add milk to equal 1 cup). Oh I must say too that I personally have never added the cinnamon (some of my kids wouldn't care for it). I've never tried another recipe and probably won't, these are just to yummy and easy!

What set this recipe apart from others were separating eggs, whipping the whites until stiff and using buttermilk. I had buttermilk that needed to be used – so that factored into my choice! Researching other waffle recipes – I used ½ cup all purpose flour ½ cup oat flour added ½ cup of ground flax seed. I also used 2½ teaspoons baking powder (there’s a recipe using a lot of b. powder, figured with heavy ingredients more b. powder would lighten results). As cinnamon fans I used 1 teaspoon cinnamon extract (Silver Cloud Estates brand) and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. When folding beaten stiff egg whites in – leaven of the baking powder and soda – it was clear these waffles would be fluffy.

I have made these twice now. 
First time I added lemon juice because I didn't have buttermilk and upped the sugar to 1 tablespoon to accommodate our tastes. They turned out perfect. 
Second time, I realized I had no white flour after I got started so I used whole wheat pastry flour instead. I increased the leavening and sugar by half. These were not as good as the first time but still very good. 
I think I will go 50/50 on the two flours next time and see how we like them.

A solid, very safe waffle recipe. Light texture with enough chew to make it interesting. The flavor...well it's good, nothing incredible but certainly not bland.

Holy moly, these waffles are good. I've made them 3 times now and the only change I've made was to add chocolate chips. Well what can I say, these are better than restaurant waffles! Oh I just remembered, I added more sugar than it called for. Didn't measure. Just kind of poured lol. But they would have tasted great without the extra sugar too.

Very good waffles! I substituted the Buttermilk for Almond Milk and Parkay Liquid for melted butter, due to a dairy allergy in our household and you couldn't really tell.  They seemed to be on the softer side, rather than the crispy waffles you would get at a breakfast out, but I had no complaints!

Fantastic!  The only change I made was to increase the cinnamon from a pinch to 1/2 tsp.  Next time I might try even more cinnamon.  Served with fresh peaches and maple syrup.  You can't go wrong with this recipe!

This is the only recipe for Belgian waffles I ever use! It is fabulous just as it is written!! For a Sunday School breakfast, I multiplied it by 6 and got 30 waffles using my round rotating waffle iron. Everyone loved them!

I did make substitutions, but they turned out awesome!! I didn't have vanilla, so I used almond extract. I also used 1/2 of plain lowfat yogurt and 1/2 c skim milk w/lemon juice for the buttermilk. I also did 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 ap. I used sea salt, and upped the cinnamon to 1 tsp. I also added 1 Tbsp ground flaxseed for health. They turned out SOO good!!! The cinnamon flavor was not overwhelming and they were so light!! I think the egg whites makes all the difference!! Great recipe!!

These waffles are incredible! I've made them twice, both times for company and everybody raves. They're light and fluffy with the subtle hint of cinnamon. Mmmm. I'm committed to this recipe when I want homemade waffles. My only complaint is the servings... 3???

These were very good waffles.  I doubled the sugar, and used a heavy dash of cinnamon, probably about 1/4 t.  I don't usually have buttermilk in the house, so I combined 1 T lemon juice with enough milk to make 1 c and let it sit for 5 minutes or so.  I don't have an actual belgian waffle maker, just a regular one, but these came out crispy, tender, and fluffy.  The hint of cinnamon was really nice.  Thanks - I'll keep this recipe in the file!

We use the batter for pancakes, and they are the best ever. I do not like cinnamon much, so I leave it out, and they are still fantastic!!! I have made this recipe so many times over the last few months it is ridiculous. I was not a big fan of pancakes, until I made these for my hubby, and now I crave them just like he does!

Did not make very many waffles at all.  Tastes very egg-y.  The touch of cinnamon is a good thing, though.

GREAT waffles!  I used my round Belgian Waffle maker and was able to squeeze out 4 waffles, but 3 of them were not full waffles. :)  I didn't separate the egg yolk s and whites, and they were still delicious...but they would have been even better if I had whisked up the egg whites separately.  I'll do that next time!

This recipe is pretty good. I liked it because the waffles came out nice and fluffy. My husband wasn't crazy about it because it had more of an eggy flavor than he likes. I'll probably try one of the other recipes next time. Worth a try though!

I love the recipe. I just make some simple changes, because we like our waffles very sweet. I change the sugar to 1/2 cup of sugar at least and the pinch of cinnamon I change into 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. My family loves them.

I, too, was lazy and did not separate the eggs and I used whole milk. I did substitute 1/4-C corn starch and 3/4-C all purpose flour for 1C flour to make them crispy. They were very good and the vanilla and cinnamon gives the house a Christmas scent.

I made these waffles for breakfast this morning.  After reading other reviews, I added 3/4 tsp of cinnamon.  They really did not have much flavor.  I won't make this one again.

very good, my family thought it was from a mix it was so tasty. don't judge it by the pale waffles in the picture.  It really tastes great.
