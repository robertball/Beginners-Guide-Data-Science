I really love these and yes, they do improve in flavor over time-if you can wait that long! I think the problem with recipe is the wording regarding the measurment of the cookie crumbs--it says 1 1/8 cup of cookies, crushed. It should say 1 1/8 cups of cookie crumbs--it takes 2 cups of cookies to make the 1 1/8 cup of crumbs. If you measure the cookies instead of the crumbs you will only end up with about 3/4 of a cup of crumbs. Then yes, your mixture would be way too juicy.

I loved the orange flavor. It's very strong. My only complaint as well was that the dough is not workable as is. It is too sticky. I added quite a bit of extra powdered sugar until the dough was no longer sticky. These are fabulous!

My mother-in-law and I make these every year around Christmas time. The family can't get enough of their orangey goodness! Definitely serve chilled though. The people saying the dough is too juicy to form - put the dough in the refrigerator for an hour before you attempt to form into balls it makes it a lot easier.

These were really yummy! My complaint as it seems was the same for others is that it was to juicy and sticky. Impossible to work with. After I added almost an additional cup of powdered sugar I decided to double the rest of the ingredients except the OJ. I think the original OJ amount of 6 oz is incorrect. I think for a single batch it would of come out right with 3 oz of OJ concentrate.

This is a favorite recipe that I grew up with. My mother made these every Christmas and I am continuing this delicious tradition! One thing that should be mentioned however is that for the best flavor they need to sit for at least one week and should be at room temperature before serving.

Made these and they are YUMMY! Even my mom said she thinks I found my calling. Only complaint is the dough is really "juicy"...I doubled the recipe and that might have been the problem...no one else mentioned any kind of problem like that so probably just me. I'd never heard of this recipe before but I will DEFINITELY make them again...they are WONDERFUL!

These are a wonderful change from rum balls. My family doesn't like coconut so I substituted toasted pecans that had been chopped fine in the food processor. Also I doubled the recipe which made perfect use of the whole box of vanilla wafers. I agree that the dough was a bit sticky but I used powdered sugar to "flour" my hands for the rolling and that helped a lot. The "1/2 (6 ounce) can of OJ" ingredient is confusing- I think it means for a standard recipe use 3 oz. of OJ; a double recipe would be 6 oz. These started out tasting like a strong creamsicle and have mellowed over the days.

These were amazing and so easy to make. This recipe is so easy to make. I took them to a morning get together and they were one of the first items to disappear! I will definitely keep this recipe!

Love this recipe. A friend gave it to me years ago and it's great for parties or get-togethers. Plus you can freeze some to have on hand for a treat.

I love these. I add a small dash of cinomen into my mix. It adds a little extra flavor. I also figured out if your mix is to sticky to role pore more powdred sugar into the mix. This removes the sticky.

Delicious! Perfect for a cool summer treat! Beware these are not for those who do not like strong orange flavor. The reason it got 4 stars instead of 5 is because the ingredient amounts are off. I used 2 cups powdered sugar and a little extra crushed cookies (I used animal crackers =vegan)

The amounts are off and the "dough" isn't really a dough. Very loose and sticky. If I were to make these again I'd definitely up the powdered sugar and cookies. Also I think I would enjoy the flavor more if I used orange soda rather than orange juice.

I crushed a 12 oz bag of vanilla wafers and it was the right amount. These had too much bite for us. The oj is very tart.

I give this a 3 star because no one was interested in eating these yesterday. Guests eat one to try then walk away. Won't make these again.

This recipe was so good that my mother (who eats veggies and only healthy stuff) couldn't quit eating them which is strange for her. Everyone loved them this is really EASY to make the ingredients are easy to get you probably have them in your pantry or frig already. Try this one out I'm sure you will not be disappointed..............
