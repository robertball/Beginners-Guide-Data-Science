USE THESE CHANGES!

... and make a fantastic Key Lime Cheesecake!

Use 3 8-oz pkgs. cream cheese instead of 2 1/2 pkgs.
Use 1/3 cup lime juice instead of 3/4 cup.
Use 4 eggs instead of 3.

The above changes will give you superb results!  Additionally, when you take the cheesecake out of the oven and set it on a cooling rack, set a timer for 10 minutes.  When the timer goes off, use a paring knife to gently separate the edge of the cheesecake from the pan.  Continue to cool, and then chill 5 hours or overnight.  The cheesecake will not crack and will easily come free of the pan, and look picture-perfect!  Top with fresh whipped cream, (heavy whipping cream whipped with a dash of vanilla and just a tiny bit of powdered sugar).

Thanks to all of you who wrote your comments to use MUCH less lime in this recipe!  You saved me from making a drastic mistake, and now this recipe (with my alterations), is my favorite cheesecake recipe!

This cheesecake was excellent and loved by everyone!! Make the following changes and it will taste wonderful with no cracks. For the crust increase melted butter to 6T and add 4 T coconut. Cake: Use 3- 8oz cream cheeses, 4 eggs and 2/3 c. lime juice. I used Rose's sweetened lime juice, avail. in the cocktail isles of grocery stores. Add 2 drops of blue food coloring to give a lime green color. Bake cheese cake in a hot water bath (put cake in larger pan and add boiling water to larger pan before baking). After 50 min.of baking, open oven door and allow to cool in oven.  Chill overnight. Garnish with 8 oz. cool whip, grated lime rind and thin slices of lime.  This looked beautiful and tasted even better!!

This was great!  I did alter it though so that I could use 3 full packages of cream cheese instead of 2 and 1/2.  In order to compensate for this, I added an extra egg, 1/2 tsp extra vanilla, 1/4 cup more of sugar.  And I used my own crust recipe.  

I kept the key lime juice the same, however and found it more than adequate in the tartness department.  Note to anyone using fresh key limes:  It will take about 20 key limes to equal 3/4 cup of juice.  Popping them in a bowl in the microwave for about 15 seconds will help them to release more juice when squeezed.  I used a fork to pulverize the membranes as well.

Although it does seem like I changed a lot, the methods involved in the preparation are sound, and the taste yields a very refreshing tang.

I made this cheesecake for Thanksgiving.  It was just great.  The texture was creamy but you could cut pieces and serve them without the whole thing collapsing.  Changes:  For the crust I did use 5 tablespoons of butter.  For the filling: I used 3 boxes of cream cheese, about a 1/2 cup of key lime juice (I tasted it at 1/4 cup and it just wasn't "limey" enough), and about a 1/3 cup powdered sugar too.  I used 2 drops of green food coloring that gave the finished product a lovely color - just be sure to mix very well or you will have green stripes! Did not bother with the hot water bath.  It turned out just fine, with two very minor cracks.  I will be making this again for Christmas and I may try the coconut as others have suggested.  I'll let you know how that works out.  Thanks again for a great recipe!

My favorite dessert is the Key Lime Cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory Restaurant and this had the same wonderful tart/sweet flavor. The only changes I made were using 24 oz of cream cheese and 4 eggs. This is a recipe that I will definitely add to my favorites.

My 13 year old made this recipe for her father's birthday. She took the advice of other reviewers and cut back on the key lime juice to 1/2 c.  The cake turned out great. Light, creamy and very flavorful. She frosted it with whip cream and added a little lime zest.  The cake had just the right amount of tartness.  Also, she did make this a day ahead.

Nice base recipe. I followed others suggestions by using 4 eggs, 24 oz of crm cheese and 1/2 c of key lime juice. I also added Key Lime zest & about 1/2 c of sweetend coconut that I toasted in a pan first. I also use chocolate graham crackers for the crust and sprinkle a bit more toasted coconut on top of filling before baking. Very yummy cheesecake!
Update 11/2/10: When making this for the 5th time - when the oven temp is reduced, I accidentally dropped it to 350 instead of 250 for 30 minutes. I turned the oven off & let it be for an hour. Still turned out great even with oven temp mistake. I may do that again, haha. No cracks either.

I recently returned from a trip to Florida and was looking for more ways to use the Key Lime juice I brought back with me.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!  I made the following changes and the cheesecake came out light, fluffy and tasty - got lots of rave reviews from those I served it to:  increase eggs to 4, use 2-8 oz. pkgs light cream cheese and 1-8 oz. pkg reg cream cheese, decrease key lime juice to 1/2 cup.  The cheesecake baked up beautifully and held it's shape very well.  Make sure to cool completely in the pan.

A bit tart with the full 3/4 cup of juice.  Cake itself has a nice texture and was easy to prepare.  I reduced the juice to 1/2 cup and also added 1/2 cup powdered sugar.  Really helped lighten up the taste.  Definitely a good cake recipie for use with any flavoring.

I loved it! Since key lime juice is much more tart than normal lime juice, I would recommend cutting back by half of the juice if you want the true key lime taste. This is a wonderful cheesecake though. I also cut the cooking time down by five minutes and then froze the cake overnight. The next day I brought it out of the freezer and served it after 20 minutes it was very refreshing ice cold!!

Excellent recipe! The cheesecake came out creamy, firm, and delicious. It had a nice, tart, limey flavor that wasn't overpowering, and contrasted nicely with the cream cheese. If anything, it was a bit too tart...a bit more sugar might be a good addition. I didn't have key lime juice, so I used regular juice from fresh limes. To make them prettier, I added a couple drops of green food color. I also baked these in my mini cheesecake pan...one recipe made about 2 1/2 dozen. I baked these at 325 degrees for about 20 minutes, or until they weren't jiggly anymore. After chilling in the fridge overnight, I popped them out of the pan, piped on a rosette of whipped cream, and topped with a tiny lime wedge. They were very well received at the picnic I took them too...I would make this again!

I made this cheesecake and it was YUMMY!! My 1st time ever making a cheesecake and I was impressed. Everyone enjoyed it. While it cooled it did crack in the center, but i used a lime/whip cream decoration to hide most of it.

Unfortunately, I was not as impressed as I hoped I would be... for one reason:  the cook temperature turned out to be too low for my personal taste.  The cheesecake turned out too creamy/custard-like instead of the texture of New York cheesecake.  I've made lots of cheesecakes at lots of temperatures but this one just didn't work for me.  I did make the alterations of using 3 packages of cream cheese and 4 eggs.  I also added a tad more sugar because I kept the 3/4 cup of lime juice (I'm pregnant, I love lime!).  I also added lime zest to the mixture.  It TASTES amazing, but the texture doesn't work.  After baking at 250 for 60 minutes, I took it out wanting to give it a shot at setting up.  It only cracked and didn't change texture, so I put it back in the oven at 300 for 15 minutes.  That did the trick... luckily I don't care about cracking.  Haha.  Overall I would recommend this, but with previous suggestions and upping the temperature if you like hard cheesecake like me!

This was an awesome cheesecake!  Thanks to everyone who reviewed this before I baked it - I made the changes as suggested and it turned out great. I used 3 pkgs cream cheese, 1/2 cup of lime juice (Nellie & Joe's), 4 eggs, and a little more than the 1 tsp of vanilla.  I also used 5 tbsp of butter for the crust as well.  I also used the suggestion of baking the cheesecake with a shallow pan of water on the rack below it.  This prevented my cheesecake from getting any cracks when baking and it looked great!  I topped with whipped cream and decorated with sliced key limes. Would definitely make this again!

YUK!! I'm not sure what all these other people quantify as delicious, but if you like BITTER cheesecake--then this is the recipe for you!  3/4 cup of Key Lime juice makes this cheesecake beyond tart.  If you are still determined to make this cheesecake with Key Lime juice, take some advice.  Start with 1/4 cup of the juice and taste.  Add a little bit at a time until it's at a tartness you like. --Better yet, stick to Key Lime Pie.

I had seen some comments that the recipe did not yield a full-bodied cheesecake, so I substituted one 14 oz. can of sweetened condensed milk for the cup of sour cream.  I also did not add the full amount of key lime juice - I used about 2/3 cup plus added fresh lime zest.  I followed the recommendation to use three 8 oz packages of cream cheese and 4 eggs.  It was superb.  My most excellent husband juiced about 20 tiny key limes for the double recipe we made and it was well worth the effort.  Delicious!!!

This received good reviews  from my friends with some of the previous changes mentioned.  I used 1 1/2 lbs cream cheese, 4 eggs, and decreased the amount of lime to 1/2 cup.  This was better after it sat in the fridge for a few days.  The next time I make this I will up the oven temp. because the cheesecake was softer than I like.

Very good and refreshing for a summer BBQ! I too did 3 packages cream cheese, 4 eggs, upped the sugar to 1 C and did 1/2 cup key lime juice with about a teaspoon of zest. Instead of a graham cracker crust I processed about 2/3 of a package of vanilla Joe Joe's (the Trader Joe's brand oreos without the hydrogenated oils) and it was soooo good!  Perfect crust! No butter needed because of the cream filling in the cookies. Try it!

Follow the tips from other cooks - 3 pckgs Cream Cheese, 4 eggs, 1/4 cup key lime juice, and advice for taking it out - it will prove to be the most delicious and easy cheese cake you've EVER made!  I also found that it tasted best 24 hours later, the texture was the best.

Sorry ~ those who said to back off on the key lime juice (I used the bottled type Nellie and Joe's Famous Key Lime Juice), and I needed what the recipe called for and then some.  I kept tasting and adding.  I did increase the eggs and cream cheese though.

This recipe had to much lime juice or needs more sugar.  I used fresh key limes.  Just a bit to sour for my taste.

I made this cheesecake for Easter, following the recipe exactly.  I felt this was way too sour.  Everyone who tried it said it was very good, they enjoyed the sour taste, but I felt it was way too overpowering.  I enjoy lemon squares, key lime pie, so I am not one who dislikes tart desserts.  However, this one was way over the top.

CUT DOWN THE LIME JUICE. I made this recipe for a customer. She was so dissatisfied! I did not add the juice a little a time. I added the whole3/4 of a cup.The lime was over whelming.She asked if it was supose to be Key lime Pie. I have made Key lime cheese cake before  I will use my recipe which has 1/4 cup of juice and 1 table spoon of rind.If I want more lime flavor I add it a little at a time.

I would use about 1/2 cup of key lime next time... It was VERY good but a little to tart for my tastes!

I did opt to use 3 bricks of cream cheese and add an egg as the others mentioned.  I didn't however decrease the juice (I used Nellie and Joes key lime juice) and personally found this very tart.  It is however a solid recipie if you tweak the tartness to your liking.  It bakes up very creamy and does not brown.  Next time I will definitely use less juice for my own personal liking.

Followed suggestions on adding extra egg and cream cheese, less key lime juice(2/3c), plus adding some powdered sugar(1/4c) and lime zest. Cooked in water bath but had to cook about 15 minutes longer than suggested. Texture was awesome and didn't crack at all, but I would have preferred a sweeter, less tart cheesecake. Next time...

I kept the same amount of key lime, added one egg and increased sugar 1/4 c. and vanilla to 1 1/2 tsp and cream cheese to 1 1/2 lb. as per recommendations. We LOVED the amount of citrus and it wasn't sour at all.  The sugar was just right, too.  Everyone raved at our Easter celebration and had seconds.  Even those who just wanted a "bite" went for a whole slice.  It was great.  Will make this over and over again. 

Thank you Cindy for such a lovely dessert.  I can't wait to eat more. Hmm...maybe I shouldn't thank her.  lol

Yummy! I was hesitant to change my traditional "just key lime pie" recipe, but I was in the mood for more of a cheesecake.  This was wonderful!!!!  However, I added 1 can sweetened cond. milk and went ahead and used all three packs of cream cheese.  My family loved it.  I used Williams Sonoma key lime juice!  Why squeeze limes when you can just buy them? Not too limey.  I zested one regular time too!  Served with lite Cool Whip.

I am a huge cheesecake fan!  I've never had a key lime cheesecake before so when a friend of mine asked me to bake one, I turned to my source, All Recipes.  Yet again, they did not let me down.  This was very easy to bake.  The only thing that I did differently, was I added coconut to the crust and used 1/4c of sweetened lime juice instead of the amount listed.  Based on the previous reviews, I too thought that it would be too much lime juice, and coconut added a little twist to the crust.  It was a success!  My friend took it to his job and it was used as a birthday cake for a co-worker who loves key lime and from what I heard, there wasn't a slice left!  I would definately make it again.

Love this cheesecake.  very refreshing.  I did add 1/4 cup more sugar.  I tried reducing the key lime juice but that reduce it's zest.  I wanted it tangy but a bit sweeter.  Everyone that taste's this cake just loves it.

I reduced the lime juice to 2/3 cup.  It was still tart, but very refreshing on a hot summer day.  I think the amount of juice is really a matter of personal preference.  The cheesecake itself turned out perfectly.  I had never made one before, and this one looked beautiful (no cracks).

I made this for our neighborhood diner's club and it was a BIG hit! I started with 1/2 cup of key lime juice and added a little at a time until it tasted just right - I think I used about 2/3 of a cup. I also put the shallow pan of water in with the cheesecake while it cooked and it seemed to help with preventing cracking. Very good and I will be making it again!!

I have been looking for a good Key Lime Cheesecake recipe for a long time.  I thought I would try this one for Christmas, and it was a big success.  It was easy to make, it turned out great, and it tasted wonderful.  That sweet, tart taste just can't be beat.  It was also light enough to eat at the end of a big meal.  I followed a helpful hint that I had found on another recipe website:  I put a shallow pan half full with hot water on the lowest rack in the oven while this cheesecake was baking.  Its supposed to keep it from cracking, and it did the trick!  I would definitely make this one again!

I made these for a New Years Eve party and they came out great.  I did add the extra egg that has been mentioned in the other reviews along with 3 full 8oz cream cheese packages and the zest of a lime in the batter.  Because this party has so many people, I chose to make these in cupcake tins (paper lined) so that the cakes would be individual.  If you also want to try that, cut the baking time down to 15 min @375 and then 32-40 minutes @250 depending on your oven. Batter makes approx 24 cakes.  Chill overnight :).  Loved this.

This cheese cake is really great...the reason I gave it 2 stars is for extreme tartness. I used real Key Limes in 1 cake and added 1& 1/2 cups of sugar. The batter tasted OK.After baking...way too tart for company. I happen to love Tartness. I tried again with bottled Key Lime juice and added 2&1/4 cups of sugar...a little better, but not much.Could not serve company. Also the 10" spring form pan it WAY to big...8" is much better. Pan was so big it dried out the cake.  Also 3/4 cup butter is better in the crust.  And it is a MUST that a large pan of water be put under the cake as it bakes or cake will crack. Also you need to seal the bottom of the pan with tightly wrapped tinfoil or it will leak all over. You can also put the cake pan "in" the pan of water or "water bath" if you wish.  I really don't think I will make this cake again.  Like I said..I love tart but not very many other people do and it just is way to tart to serve to company to take to a party.

FOOLPROOF CHEESECAKE!! Here's what I did: Added three 8oz boxes of cream cheese; 1/3 cup of keylime juice; and 4 eggs. I also used a store-bought shortbread pie crust. It turned out wonderful! Not too tart. The perfect balance of cream cheese and keylime! I highly reccomend this to all. I call it fool proof because after it was devoured, the next morning I found the 1/2 stick of butter still in the micro... Ha! I forgot to add it but you wouldn't even of noticed! Great flavor and texture! Thanks so much for this recipe!

Fabulous recipe!  This was only the 2nd cheesecake I've made and it came out perfectly - no cracks at all!  I did modify the original recipe as other suggested...adding 4 Tablespoons of coconut to the crust, and then adding an extra egg & 3 packages of cream cheese.  I started with 1/2 cup of bottled key lime juice and found it wasn't tart enough, so I did add the entire 3/4 cup of juice.  The texture of the cheesecake was great and I had comments that it tasted better than the Cheesecake Factory version!

I followed the alterations using 1/3 cup of lime juice and the extra cream cheese--this was just perfect and delicious. I skipped the water bath and it did crack a little when I took it out of the oven. I'd recommend just letting it sit for an hour in the oven to cool and set a little after it's done baking. Don't even open the door for an hour, it's still quite jiggly. Taste and texture could not be better though.

I used someone else's suggestion to use half lime/half lemon juice to replicate key lime juice (key limes are v. expensive in MN), and it was just great.  Two of my husband's favorite things, key lime pie and cheesecake, in one dish!  I always use a knife to separate the baked cheesecake from the pan before letting it cool, and it hasn't cracked on me yet!

The cheesecake was only about an inch high, but it had some kick to it! I used regular lime juice instead of key lime, and it came out fine.  The preparation was a bit much though.

This cheesecake is fabulous!  I was craving the key lime cheesecake, so we went to Bakers Square.  Nothing about it screamed, so I made my own.  The only change that I made was that I used a little more crust and about 1/2 cup of unsalted butter.  I have never made a cheesecake before, but I did it exactly like the menu (with exception to the graham crackers and butter), and it tasted wonderful!  Very creamy inside.    Perfect!  I will definitely make it again!!!

Yummy!  Recipe is perfect just as written.  Used fresh lime juice.  Tart taste of lime balances sweetness and creaminess of sugar and cheese.

This is a great recipe, I prefer slightly less cream cheese and in the case of this recipe sour cream, it adds a nice tart note. I have used this as a "base" cheesecake recipe, and have substituted the lime for pureed strawberries, pureed mango, chocolate, or lemon. So from this one recipe i have been able to make a number of different flavours.

This made a really nice cheesecake with the changes another person suggested like 3 packages cream cheese,4 eggs and 1/3 cup lime juice.  I still thought it was a tad to limey but some people liked it! Very nice cheesecake.  Just make these changes!

Very tart but nice and tasty!  The cake baked up beautifully and looking amazing.  It tasted good, but gave me a pucker face more than once!

I made this for V-day and my boyfriend LOVED it...so did not family and co workers when I brought in the leftovers the next day.  Like others, i did not add the FULL amount of key lime since I am not too keen on very tart stuff and it turned out great...!!!

Very tart, but just right with lightly sweetened whipped cream.  Excellent texture; very easy to put together.  Would definitely make again!

3/4 of a cup was way too much lime juice for this as it gave a bitter taste rather than a pleasing tartness.  Reducing it to a 1/2 cup might improve it, otherwise, load it up with whipped cream to cut the bitterness.

This was my first key lime pie so it was hard to rate. I very much like the fact that it did not have milk in the recipe.  Next tiem I will keep simmer longer for thicker filling.

This receipe for Key Lime Cheese Cake is absolutely WONDERFUL!   I recommend U watch the Graham Cracker Crust while in the oven.  I only need about 4 min. in my oven. Otherwise the crust gets too dark.
I've also melted Seedless Red Rasperry Jam with 2 sticks of Butter.  Pour into a squeeze bottle in order to drizzle the Raspberry Sauce onto the Key Lime Cheese Cake.

Followed the recipe exactly as written. The cheesecake turned out perfect but the next time I'll add a full cup of sugar as it was just a tad tart for my taste.  We'll be serving it to guests tomorrow. I'm going to top it with fresh strawberries in a sugar syrup. Hopefully that will go well with the tart lime flavor.

I have made this cheesecake 6 times already! It is fabulous!  Everyone that I make it for wants another one. I do add a few extra touches to take it over the top. I make the cheesecake by this recipe with the entire amount of key lime juice., and top it with a slight sweetened sour cream topping, made with 1 c., of sour cream blended with 2 T., of sugar and 1 tsp., of vanilla. After the cake has completely chilled overnight I add a fresh lime curd to the center and spread not quite across the circumference of the cake. Then I whip some Bettercream frosting with a little bit of green food color to make it a pale pastel green, and then pipe it around the outer edge. I then add some melted lemon and lime flavored chocolate wafers that have been melted and broken into pieces to top the Bettercream rim. It is to die for, the topping and the Bettercream help to cut the sharpness of the cake and the lime curd just helps to keep it extra tart.

I make this cheesecake with chocolate cookie crumb crust. I also heat seeded raspberry jam and spread this on top when the cheesecake cools. The jam will thicken and set as it cools. The raspberry jam helps to offset the tart lime flavor.

I made the changes others suggested using 1/2 cup of lime juice and and 3-8 oz packages of cream cheese and 4 eggs. I cooked it on 350 for 55 minutes . Despite these changes, it was still very custard-like, which was wonderful to eat, but it did not plate well at all.

Following the comments, I changed it up in this way:

Used four eggs.  3 bricks of cream cheese.  ½ cup + a little more key lime juice.  1-½ t. vanilla.  I also used 6 Tbsp. butter in the crust.

Extraordinary.

my absolute favorite cheesecake recipe! flawless every time :) I also use 4 eggs and 3 pkgs cream cheese, I use fresh key lime juice (takes a lot of time but so worth it!) so I taste the batter and have added an extra tbsp. or two of sugar if it was too tart...its a family fave!!

This was a very good cheesecake! I did change it a bit increasing the amount of eggs from 3 to 4, increased the amount of cream cheese to 3 boxes instead of 2 1/2, decreased the lime juice down to 1/4 cup, and added just a few drops of green coloring to make it festive.

Yesterday, I tried this recipe. I didn't change the ingredients. Beautiful texture, but a bit too sour for my taste.  Tonight, I'm gonna try with a Passion or Mango Fruit Coulis.  If I redo this recipe, I'm wondering if  is it a good idea to use condensed milk rather than sour cream & 1/3 cup of lime juice.?

I wish I'd payed closer attention to the previous reviews, as I usually do.  I didn't have key limes, so used regular limes, and I used 3/4 cup following the recipe - made for an extremely tart cheesecake.  Probably will make again, but will use less lime juice, and more sugar.

I made this recipe and used suggestions made by earlier reviews...used 4 eggs, 1/2 cup powdered sugar, and a little less lime juice.  I really liked this recipe. It was very tart and tasty.  I am only giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I had to make the changes to have it come out as good as it did.

Very moist and flavorful the day after making it too!

This was a very easy recipe...but  a little on the tart side.  I used 2 lbs. of cream cheese instead of 1 1/2.  The crust is delicious!

This was really yummy and not hard to make.  Mine cracked, but then ALL my cheesecakes crack; no matter what I do.  Best to have a garnish ready to hide the cracks if they do appear.  I used lime candies; although I like the idea that another reviewer used; Cool Whip.  I also found that 1 drop of green food coloring was not enough.  I used 3 or 4.  Overall an excellent recipe.

What a great, tart, summer treat!  I halved and sliced key limes and garnished the top of the cake with them (along with whip cream rosettes).  I made two of these and took them to two different events last week.  Men seemed to really like it, and several people asked me for the recipe.

This is a super cheesecake if you love key lime pie.  The prior review said it did not set up, but mine came out just perfect.  I especially loved that it was not real sweet.  I served it for Easter and everyone loved it.

The cheesecake never set up so it was like really soft lime pudding.  When you cut it the sides fall.  Other than that the taste is wonderful.
