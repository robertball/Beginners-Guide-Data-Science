We were feeding 11 people with this recipe so used 4 pounds of chicken breasts and had enough marinade without doubling it. After making the marinade as stated in the recipe, I thought that it was a bit bland for our liking so I added some ingredients.  To the marinade I added 1 tablespoon sesame oil, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 tablespoon light brown sugar, 1 tablespoon hot pepper sauce, 2 cloves chopped garlic and 2 teaspoons lime juice. I stirred it up, put in the chicken breasts (cut into strips), and let the marinating chicken sit in the refrigerator, in a covered bowl, for six hours. In the meantime I soaked the skewers in water so they wouldn't burn on our gas grill. After marinating for 6 hours, I put the meat on the skewers (ending up with 40 skewers), and grilled them in our gas grill, on medium high heat, on a piece of heavy duty foil (lightly sprayed with cooking spray). They came out golden brown as well as tender and juicy.  We served these with Thai curry rice, fresh string beans from the farmer's market and "The Best Thai Peanut Sauce" (also on this site - awesome 'as is'). The meal was a big hit...delicious! the reason I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the changes made to the recipe. I will definitely be making this recipe again.

I made this recently to entertain and the prep was very well suited for it. By marinading then skewering the chickend pieces I was able to tackle other dishes and throw these on the grill right when people were ready to eat. I don't keep fish sauce around muh, so substituted soy sauce - It worked out perfectly fine with it.

This satisfied our craving for satay. I didnt have all the ingredients so I substituted but kept it as close as possible. I cooked it in a pan with the marinade instead of grilling because I didn't have skewers - It was really good but I think grilling or baking would be better. My children didn't like it, which was fine because my husband and I ate it all. I served with homemade fried noodles and a peanut sauce from this site. Added: I have grilled the chicken on skewers and it is amazingly better, really really good.

I followed this recipe very closely, but as it's the middle of the winter, I cooked the chicken on the stove in a skillet. I imagine that it's tastier when grilled, but I have to tell you this was absolutely to die for, even with the change. When the chicken was almost done sauteing, I threw in some frozen green beans so they'd pick up some of the sauce. I served it with "Thai Peanut Butter Sauce" over rice. My boyfriend said that he would have paid for a meal like this. Soooo good! Thank you for sharing.

I added to this. I added Champanions(spelling), Corn Cuts & water chestnuts. I did add more curry paste & added garlic. I served  this with Thin Noodles. Was Delish!!!

YUM!  I used the Peanut Sauce 1 recipe, but cut it in half for my family of 5 and it was plenty.  Also, don't leave out the cilantro.  It truly adds a delicious touch!

Super good and easy to make! It tastes like the chicken satay at Cheeseburger in Paradise. Can't tell the difference. I served with coconut rice, which is super good.

My husband has used this sate several times now.  It is YUMMY.  We have tweaked it a little, since we like things more spicy than most folks, but over all, this is a great recipe.  It works well on chicken AND beef.  Beef is my fave.  We serve it with his famous peanut sauce.  Always a hit.

My boyfriend makes this twice a month, at least. It's wonderful! I like it so much that I asked him to make it for my office, where it quickly disappeared. The only difference between how he makes it and how the recipe is written is that he doesn't use the skewer (which helped it keep pretty well in the buffet setting on our slow cooker when I took it to work). Sometimes we add chopped up sweet peppers, too. That adds a nice relief from the heat.

Marinated for almost 24 hrs. Came out flavorful, and like satay I've had in restaurants. But I kinda wanted it to be even more packed with flavor since it marinated for so long. Very messy putting onto skewers, so be prepared for that. Don't cut too thin or it won't thread onto the skewers. I broiled mine - actually first time ever using the broiler! it came out a bit dry - so I probably overcooked. But it was yummy and there were no leftovers.

Huge hit.  I substituted Red Curry powder for the coriander (since that is the primary ingredient in the RCP) and chili sauce instead of chili oil. Otherwise I made the recipe as described. My husband said it was one of his favorites and my kids 8 & 10 yrs gobbled it up wanting more. I served it with rice & a cabbage, carrot, & green onion salad with a sesame & rice wine vinagrette. A simple but delightful meal!

After having been too daunted by the thought of making satay at home for years, I decided to give them a try. Guess what? They are way easy to make. This is a good recipe which I followed precisely and got family-pleasing results. I will definitely be making them again (and often). Thanks!

Great recipe! Used it with Thai-style peanut sauce instead of a store brand and it was delicious!

It was a lot of work to make but tasted pretty good with the peanut sauce - a bit bland without.

Very good! Forgot the peanuts, oops. I used chicken tenderloins and broiled them on the middle rack at 400 for about 20 minutes - perfect. I served mine with the vinaigrette from the Grilled Prawns with Peanut-Lime Vinaigrette and it was excellent. Thanks!

The chicken itself was somewhat bland.  You really need to have a knock-out Satay sauce recipe to perk up the flavor.

I think i will double up on the spices next time(if there is a next time). It was ok, nothing special. Definitely needs a longer marinading time than just 2 hrs. Somewhat bland when eatin by itself.

So amazingly delicious!! I only made a few alterations. I used 1/4 tsp cumin instead of coriander, because i didn't have any. i didn't use cilantro, because i don't care for the flavour. I marinated for around 2 hours, and sauteed the chicken instead of grilling on skewers. I also used some of the thick coconut cream from the top of the can, along with some sesame oil as a base in my fry pan before i sauteed the chicken. added such a nice flavour! definitely a keeper for thai night at our house!! thanks for a great recipe!

I didn't have fish sauce so I used soy sauce, I added a little lemon juice, and instead of chopped peanuts, I used a couple tblsp creamy peanut butter. Really tasty!

I had high hopes for this one-chicken was moist (marinated all day) but pretty flavorless. We like the Thai Barbeque Chicken much better.

I've made this twice.  Once with low fat coconut milk and one time with regular.  Low fat was good.  Regular was fantastic.  Fresh cilantro a must.  I put chopped up leftover chicken satay over homemade minestrone soup and it was a delicious surprise.  Who knew it would be so versatile and tasty.  This one is staying in my recipe book.

This definitely had the right flavors but for some reason it didn't really soak into the chicken.  I only marinated it for about 30 minutes.  I'll definitely make this again and marinate for longer.

This was very good, and a great introduction to homemade thai cooking.  My picky son even liked it because it had peanut sauce to dip it in!  I omitted the cilantro and peanuts, but that was because I didn't have them on hand in the house.  thanks for sharing!

So flavorful! I followed the recipe and it is a delicious taste explosion when served with bottled Thai peanut sauce to dip. I did not skewer, I cooked the pieces quickly in a grill pan and the chicken was juicy and addictive. One of the best allrecipes I've ever made! Fresh cilantro is important.

The flavour of this chicken complimented the homemade peanut sauce I made. Yum!

Have made this twice already!  It's a very easy recipe for entertaining as you can prep everything ahead of time.  Just throw it on the grill for about 5 minutes.   I don't even bother with the bamboo sticks if it's just my family.  I make this with Peanut Sauce ( I like the kind that simmers for a few minutes). Also can be made ahead. Add a cucumber salad and some jasmine rice and you're done!  If you have any lime leftover from your sauce, squeeze a little into the marinade. It gives it a nice complexity. This is such a simple recipe. The hardest part is gathering the ingredients, but I keep all my Asian stuff together anyway.   Outstanding!

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great!  It's better than what I would get in a thai restaurant.  Authentic flavor and the chicken is very moist.  It is easy to make and calls for only the necessary ingredients for a satay... unlike some I've seen on this website.  Will definitely make this again.

This was super easy and the closest to restaurant satay we've managed to make at home. Great for big parties. We marinaded overnight, skewered in the am, and then relaxed and enjoyed our guests instead of prepping all day. I'll totally make it a regular.

Loved this recipe! I added a table spoon more of the yellow curry to the marinade and let it sit overnight! Fabulous! The chicken came out better than the satay we get at our favorite restaurant! My wife wants me to make this at least once a week now!

I would NEVER sub soy sauce for fish sauce....it's not even close in taste or aroma. Invest in a small bottle.

Didn't like the fish sauce.  Second time I omitted it and added 1 tsp garlic powder and 1 tbsp peanut butter.  Liked THAT a lot better.  It really needed garlic.  thanks for sharing, a basic recipe, that we can each tweak to our liking.
