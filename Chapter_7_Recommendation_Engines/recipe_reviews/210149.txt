This was a pretty good recipe.  It was really simple and very easy to make.  I thought there was too much chicken for the recipe as a whole, but overall it was pretty good.  I'll probably make it again.

This recipe is very good, even better the next day for lunch.  I used chicken broth instead of the wine.  I also used the chicken broth to eliminate the jarred alfredo sauce and thickened it up a bit.  I cut up the chicken breasts into bite size pieces and added to the pasta, I use angel hair.  I had pre-cooked bacon in the fridge, it was much easier and less grease.

Recipe was so quick, easy and tasty!  Modified it slightly by adding some minced garlic to sautee with the onion.  Also cut up the chicken in to bite sized pieces.  Made a great Valentine's Day dinner!

This was nothing like the carbonara I recently had but it was convenient and very easy to make on a weeknight. I had some fresh broc. I wanted to use up so I used that in place of the frozen peas. Very good. Served with some angel hair pasta.
