I'm sorry but this recipe was extremely disappointing.  I made it for my mother's birthday and I couldn't serve it.  It was completely flat!!!  And the taste was simply mediocre, nothing exciting.  Not making it again, sorry!

the recipe i have calls for 2 c. flour 2 c. sugar 2 tsp. baking soda 1 large can of crushed pineapple.. i use a 9 x 9 in. glass baking dish and it comes out just yummy... and i put a cream cheese frosting on top and keep it in the fridge...it is just delicious that way...putting it in a 9 x 13 regular cake pan i find the flavor isn't as good...try it in a glass baking dish and see if that works better for u!!

I would think that this recipe needs about 1/2 teaspoon of salt to activate the baking soda.

I am sorry to say that this cake is one of the greatest disappointments I have encountered in my 40 years of cooking.  Maybe something was left out of the recipe, but I found it dry and not flavorful at all.  Only an inch high and basically the quality of a Hockey Puck.  Not worth to have the name Amish in front of it.  I have Amish Cookbooks and never have I had such a disaster as this one.

This was light, refreshing, and full of flavor. A healthy twist for my kids to enjoy. We topped ours with flaked, sweetened coconut during the last 8 minutes of baking...yummy!

This cake came out beautifully - even though I had no eggs, I added 4tbsp butter and 1/4 c. milk instead.  I had no trouble with the cake not rising.  It was fluffly and moist.  Thanks!

This is more the texture of a quick bread than a 'cake' - as other reviewers have said, it doesn't rise and is rather thin and dense.  The taste is fine and it certainly is quick and easy to make.

I thought it was very good!  For the people that said it didn't rise: you added your baking powder to soon.  If you add it too long before you put it in the oven, all the bubbles from the chemical reaction will have already popped, leaving you with a flat cake...

My son and I really liked this recipe, but I made it in a bread pan, instead of a 9x13, because I wanted to slice it like bread. Really nice.

Loved, loved this recipie.  The only change I made was to cut the sugar back to one cup (the pineapple adds lots of sweetness) and added about a tsp of fresh ginger - really balanced the taste.  Added a little salt as a previous reviewer suggested and it rose just fine.  One of the best cakes I've ever made - didn't even need icing!  Delicious!

my recipe also calls for 2 cups of sugar, but NO eggs! This recipe has been a hit everytime the cake is served! I have customized my recipe w/a cream cheese icing, also! It's GREAT!!

It was definitely different, very very sweet for sure. Doesn’t need any frosting of any kind in my opinion. Doesn’t rise like other cakes if your looking for that sort of thing. Perfect if your looking for a simple cake to serve while entertaining guests over coffee.

I made this today....I thought it came out very well. Great taste, easy to make. It may not rise like other cakes, but, it's an Amish cake and that is the way they make it. I had a can of pineapple rings and just put them in my blender and that was just as good. I added 2 extra tablespoons of sugar, since I read that someone thought it not sweet enough. I think next time I will not do the 2 tblespoons of sugar. I baked it in a 9 x 13 coated baking pan and it was just fine. Will make this again and possibly try another fruit. I also only used 1/3 cup of slivered almonds...not a nut person with cakes....maybe pecans.

I have made this many times over the past 10 years for my kids they love it . The trick to a very moist cake is not to drain any of the juice off the crushed pineapples. The first cake I made turned out awful!!  I asked an older friend that baked a lot she  asked me if it said to drain the pineapple  juice off. I rechecked the recipe and tried again I got a wonderful cake. I also used a pineapple whipped cream recipe for the topping it was amazing I used butterscotch pudding instead of vanilla.

This was a pretty easy to make cake that tasted good.  The only things I changed in the recipe were I added a pinch of salt, only 1 cup of sugar, a pinch of ground ginger, and I baked it in a 9 inch square glass pan.  Was a hit in my book club, and my kids liked it with a dollop of whipped cream.
