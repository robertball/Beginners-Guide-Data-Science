I used cocktail wieners instead of frankfurters then took the dish to a church fellowship.  Several people told me that they really ejoyed the unique flavor of this dish. There were no leftovers!

I've done this with cocktail franks and even sliced turkey kielbasa - it's awesome.  I also mix in a little brown sugar - to taste, add a little bit at a time.

I found this recipe for a last-minute football appetizer, and it was easy and delicious.  The best part is I already had the ingredients!

Love this recipe it is so easy and delish.  I use a mini crockpot and just dump it all together, but I substitute frankfurters for cocktail wienies.
