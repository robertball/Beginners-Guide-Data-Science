I thought this was ok, but everyone else thought it was really good.  (I'm not a big fan of cool whip)  My biggest problem with this recipe is that the prep time is WAY off.  Fortunately I chose to make the crepes ahead of time, because it took at least 45 minutes just to cook the crepes.     Add another 10 minutes to mix up the crepe batter, plus time to chop all the fruit and mix up the "sauce" and you are looking at a good hour and a half of preparation before chilling time.  
I put the finished crepes on a plate, covered with foil, in the fridge overnight, and they were good as new next morning.  I also used frozen blueberries, partially thawed, and that worked well too.  (Tip: 16 oz strawberries is about 2 C chopped)

After reading about the time it took people to make the crepes, I decided to try something else.

I replaced the crepes with croissants.  If you up the servings to 12 and use a 9x13 baking dish, a canister of rolled out croissant dough will fit just about perfectly. (You will need 1 canister for each layer)  Pinch and seal the perferated triangles so that it's one big rectangle of dough.  Stab holes in it with a fork so that air vents out and the dough doesn't rise.  If it matters, I put holes in my dough about 5 or so minutes into baking it.

I made this for a work luncheon and people seemed to be pleased with it.

So good! Made this for a brunch and it was a hit! I made the crepes the night before and they kept very well. I used the entire package of vanilla pudding on accident but I think I'll do it that way from now on! Great recipe.

This was really delicious!  As other reviewers have said, the prep time is way off.  It wasn't hard to make, but the crepes were pretty time consuming.  I accidentally bought cook & serve pudding instead of instant.  I just mixed it with the OJ and sour cream and cooked it according to the directions on the box, and then chilled it and it worked out fine.  So, if anyone else makes the same mistake, don't panic!

This has a very light, good taste, but wasn't very filling.  My daughter didn't like it at all, my husband loved it.  This was good, but not my favorite (I don't like sweet things for breakfast though).  I made the crepes the evening before as another reviewer suggested.  They were simple to make, just took a little time.  The rest of the recipe was quick and simple.

I gave this a 4 b/c it takes a very long time to make when you factor in how long it takes to prepare all those crepes! However, it is DELICIOUS! When I make it again I may take the easy way out and buy the crepes at the grocery store...all the fruit and whipped cream mix would mask any store-bought flavors anyway.

I thought this was very good and different.  I didn't have blueberries so I just added more strawberries.  Thanks for the recipe.  :)

Wonderful!!! I took this to a birthday breakfast at work and everyone loved it. It was the first thing gone! I rated this recipe a four b/c as another reviewer said the prep time is way off, it did take awhile to make the crepes. Other than that this is a keeper for sure, will make again soon!

This recipe was so refreshing, with perky flavors that really catches your attention.  I didn't have any orange juice, but I had an orange-pineapple blend that I used instead.  The way I am going to fix this next time, to take to a potluck dinner is putting a couple of tablespoons of the fruit mixture into the middle of a crepe, and making little bags, closing the tops with toothpicks holding fruit in the toothpicks.  Great idea, Huh. Debbie Webre

I have never attempted to make crepes and wouldn't dare try unless I have the right non-stick pan...but the filling for these sounded so interesting I came up with an alternative!  I baked 2 rectangle sheets of puff pastry and put the filling in-between, then piped some fresh whipped cream stars to fill up the top layer and decorated with strawberries, blueberries & kiwi.  I opted to use kiwi in the filling as I feared the bananas would get icky.  It was delicious & beautiful, lots of oooh's & aaaw's when it arrived at the table! :-)

very good and easy to modify, a little time consuming but making extra crepes and freezing them makes this recipe shine.  Great for hot day desserts

Really good, and easy. You can make the crepes and the filling at the same time, doesn't really take that long. I only used strawberries and bananas,  - blueberries didn't look good at the store. You don't really have to make it into lasagna form if you don't want to, you could also put filling on each crepe and roll "enchilada" style. I would make it again

Used plain no sugar added yogurt instead of sour cream. I’d imagine plain Greek yogurt would work too.

I loved this recipe! I made this for a breakfast with several guests and my family, and everyone loved it. The sour cream and orange juice was actually very good together. For the fruit filling, I used raspberries, strawberries, blackberries, blueberries, and banana. In stead of making a lasagna-style dish, I rolled the crepes with filling inside (more like a taco) and it was delicious. The only downfall (that I found) to this recipe was the crepes. They were delicious, but hard to make. I poured the batter into a frying pan and let the batter spread out by tilting the pan, and it was fairly difficult. I made the crepes the night before and the filling in the morning, and it saved loads of time and the crepes were still just as fresh and delicious as the night I made them. Thanks for another great recipe! I'll be holding on to this one to make again and again.

This is my husband's favorite thing for me to make him. The filling reminds me of an orange Julius.
