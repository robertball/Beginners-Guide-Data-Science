This should read 2 1/4 cups milk and the recipe will turn out OK. Someone try it and rerate this recipe. I rate this one star because of the glaring mistake in the recipe.

I love this stuff. I had it in the Army for years. I have always had it with hamburger though and that's what I use when I make it. Not the sausage. Try it that way. Once you try it, it more you like it.

If you had a zero that's what this should be rated. I'm a very ameture cook (ie-I try and follow recipe)and had to try and rescue this abomination by adding much more milk and trying to get out the onions. My wife had to help to make this junk edible. She's a good cook and she failed

Made this for my monthly Men's Prayer Breakfast.  Everyone raved about it.  Made 10 servings and used 3 cups of 2% milk.  Not much left when chow was over.

This was exactly how my mom made this for us growing up.  Dad was AF and he loved this.  Its the same recipe, and my family actually loves it once in a while for a change of pace.  Its also, very budget wise.

I did have to use more milk but it made for a quick and easy dinner to make,  which is much appreciated.  I’ll give it a five for it’s easiness.
