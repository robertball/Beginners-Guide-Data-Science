Great recipe! I was craving some peanut butter with my chocolate so here is what I did... I used a fudge type brownie mix with no nuts. Melted about 1/2 cup of peanut butter and poured it over cooled brownies, waited for that to cool before pudding, then I topped the cool whip layer with crushed reeses. Perfect! Thank You!!!!!

If the "Better than S*x" cake is the Queen of Trashy Desserts, the Brownie Pie is the Princess.  Simple and not only uses common pantry/freezer items, but is a real people-friendly put-together dessert. My boys loved this. Super simple and trash heaven. NOTE: Instead of chocolate shavings over the top, I squirted chocolate syrup. Worked out great.

I made this for a going away party for friends of ours.  There was no leftovers...I was disappointed.  I wanted to take the extras home for myself. These were great and now I need another excuse to make them.  Thanks for posting.

I put chopped Andes chocolates on top for a minty twist.  It was really yummy but it wasn't spectacular.  Next time I'll probably double the pudding.

All my friends wanted the recipe for this one!  They absolutely loved it!  I took the advice of other inputs and just used the 3-personal pudding cups and crushed oreos for the topping.  I also refrigerated and served the next day. Extremely fast and easy.

OH MY GOD! This was sooo good. If you are a chocolate lover this one is for you. I made this for a Christmas dessert and everybody had seconds. I used crumbled Oreo cookies as the garnish (my fiance's idea). And wow...so easy to make.

5 stars across the board!  I thought this sounded kind of boring, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It was very easy and tasted really great!  I took it to a friends house and everyone loved it, especially her 3 yr old.  Changes I made:  regular brownies (no pecans) and used crushed Oreos on top instead of wafers.  My husband thinks it tasted even better the second day.  A definate keeper!!

In all the time I've been a member, I've never left a rating, but this time I couldn't resist.  I used a sugar free brownie and pudding mix and a lite cool whip.  For the chocolate morsels, I used a couple tablespoons of the mini morsel toppings that come in a shaker.  Delicious!

My trick w this type of dessert is to pour a tiny bit of milk in the bottom so it's very moist.  If I don't do this then I need to make the dessert a day in advance so the bottom layer has time to absorb some of the pudding for moisture.  I followed this exactly except for the added milk at the bottom.  Of course it was yummy...chocolate, chocolate, n chocolate.  How can u go wrong w that!!

This is a simple to make yet very satisfying desert.  I, like a few others, added about 1/4 cup melted peanut butter over the warm brownie before adding the pudding mixture.  Delicous!!! I can't wait to make again for the holidays!!

Pretty yummy, and a nice way to turn something plain like brownies or pudding, into something more interesting.  I used non-instant pudding since that's what I had, and let it cool in the fridge for about 15 minutes before spreading, then let the pudding finish cooling before topping with whipped cream.  We used leftover mini chocolate chips for the final layer.  I can see where kids would love this, but it's pretty good for adults, too!

I took this to a potluck at work today, and there wasn't a crumb left!  I modified it with mini choc. chips, chopped nuts, and maraschino cherries on the whipped topping.  For my family tonight, I made individual parfaits using chunked brownies, pudding,and whipped topping.  Repeat layers, ending with whipped topping, mini chips, and ,of course, a cherry on top.  That was a big hit, too.  If you are a true chocoholic, a drizzle of chocolate sauce could be used as well.

Outstanding! I usually make what we call "Symphony Brownies" but decided to jazz them up a bit and use this recipe - used a 9x13 brownie mix and baked in an 11x7 pan - layer of brownie mix, pieces of Hershey's Symphony Bar, top layer of brownie mix. After that baked/cooled, spread 3 pkgs of pudding snack cups on top, then the cool-whip and crushed oreos (may try Heath next time.) So sinfully delicious and simple - thanks!

This is a good, quick dessert recipe to have on hand for when you have to bring something to a potluck.  My kids really loved it.  I don't love to cook with boxed mixes so I'm only rating it 4 stars but considering it isn't from scratch, the result is pretty good.

OMG, this is to die for! I used a box brownie mix without nuts. On top of the cool whip I put crushed oreo cookies. This was so rich and delicious! There wasn't a square left! Thanks.

My family loved this.  I happened to have some of the new chocolate Cool Whip in my fridge, so I used that, and then sliced some strawberries and a banana and scattered those on top instead of the shaved chocolate.  Very delicious and disappeared quickly.

Yummy. I didn't have any whipped topping and I don't really like it so I just left that out. I mixed in some mini semi-sweet chocolate chips in with pudding and topped with crushed chocolate wafer cookies. Yum. I bet this would be good with vanilla pudding as well.

THANK YOU for such a great tasting and easy recipe! I made it for co-workers and family.  Everyone liked it. Only my husband had a small complaint, that he did'nt like the whipcream on the top..although it's also funny that he ate the most out of everyone...!I will make this again.

Very good. Took this to a get-together and there was only one piece left by the end of the evening. I think next time I made it I'll double-up on the brownie... was a little too thin for my liking.

Very good, especially considering how incredibly easy it is to make.  I also added a layer of melted peanut butter under the pudding.

I never in my life thought I would be complaining (just a little) that something was "too" chocolatey and sweet, but this was.
However, I made it for work and everyone loved it with coffee.
Overall--good.  I'm not diabetic, but I think an insulin shot is called for right about now!

I made the brownies in a round pie pan, which  usually means there is two pans worth. This is good for my family, because not everyone wants whipped cream on their pie. I also don't use pecan brownies and top the pie with mini chocolate chips.

What a guilty pleasure! I used Ghirardelli Brownie mix (not too sweet) and Hershey's instant dark chocolate pudding. I hope it's available in everyone's area - it's much smoother than Jell-O brand. Just a sinful dessert and thanks for sharing.

Make sure you lay ALL your ingredients out before starting. I accidentally skipped the pudding part. There I go scooping all the whip out of the pie only to add the pudding and then layer the whip on top again. I could not find pecan brownie mix so I used original brownie mix. I also did without the garnishing. I used left over brownie crumble for garnishing. Made this for our pie contest at my church. There was not room to place my pie. I finally just brought the pie to my table to personally eat it or take it home. As I walked to sit down, I cut a piece for my friend. Then many people started asking me for a slice, then another slice until finally there was only 1 slice left. When I went to see the other pies, people only took 1-2 slices of their pies. Darn it!!! This pie should have won 1st prize!!! It seems too easy but this recipe is the bomb.com! Next year I'll make it again and I'll make sure to arrive much earlier.

This turned out a mess for me.  First of all, the picture shows a round cake yet the recipe calls for using a 9x13.  To me this makes a huge difference in the moistness of the brownie base and cooking time.  Secondly, the pudding mixed with only 1 cup of milk was not spreadable on the brownie base at all.  I think I used 2 cups as per the pudding package directions.  The whipped topping and the crushed mints chocolates I put on top were delicious tho!

OMG This is Heaven! I saw a recipe very similar to this, except they added a cream cheese layer to the brownie first before the pudding and whipped topping (combine 1 pkg cream cheese with 1 cup sugar, then mix with 1 container whipped topping - meaning you will need 2 containers of whipped topping ... put this on top of the brownie, then the pudding, then whipped topping). It adds a nice tang with the cream cheese and it makes it so much more decadent! This will be a recipe I make more than once - I'd like to try it with different puddings, too! :)
