very tasty dish - husband especially loved the salsa.  The fresh herbs and citrus juices add a nice contrast to the smoky chipotle.  We like a lot of spice, but I only used 1/2 tsp of chipotle paste and it was plenty.  I also cut down the amount of oil in chicken marinade to 1/4 cup, and next time will use even less.  This is a great recipe to prepare with the gf grilling machine, too.  I want to give it 5 stars but it is probably too spicy for kids.

I've made this recipe a couple of times and have had great results with it.  I've made it for a dinner party with my neighbors and got compliments from everyone about it.  The combination of flavors is perfect. The second time of making the salsa I used the mid-sized can of crushed pineapple (drained), omitted the lime juice and added some of the pineapple juice, and I increased the cilantro to two heaping tablespoons of cilantro. I highly recommend setting the chicken up in the morning.  I didn't use the 1/2 cup of olive oil, as recommended.  I only used 1/4 cup for six large chicken breast (skinless/boneless) and it was plenty.

Excellent chicken! Beware the chipotle in the salsa is very hot so start out with a little and add more if you like it hot!

I would say this is a good recipie if you're looking for something different. I would NOT add it to favorites.  I preferred the chicken without the salsa.  My husband however thought it was fabulous, he added more spice than i originally made it with.  Also, i served with rice, and he wanted more "broth or juice"  to pour over the rice.  Another review said they used crushed pineapple...this would be a good suggestion. If you want more broth...i would bump up the oj and lime juice too.  Hubby said *five star,  I rate *3 star and my 7 year old son did love the chicken w/o the salsa.  Oh, i marinade chicken a day ahead of time,and with conflicting schedules I didn't make til 3 days later...tasted great.

We really enjoyed this!  I'm not usually big on fruity salsas, but this one is necessary because without it the chicken is (believe it or not) very bland.  We tried the salsa two ways:  in big chunks like in the recipe, and with all the ingredients pureed, and liked both versions.  We served the dish over plain couscous, which was an excellent choice because it helped keep the salsa in place, and it really added to the texture without overpowering the flavor.  Best of all, there are lots of shortcuts to make this quick to prepare (pureeing all the salsa ingredients, buying adobo puree instead of whole chipotles, buying thin-sliced chicken breasts, and broiling in the toaster oven instead of grilling).Thanks for this great recipe!

Gorgeous.  The pineapple salsa really makes this dish.  I've never heard of chipotle peppers (I'm from Yorkshire in England) - I just used an un-named type of green chili pepper they sell in my local store and it was wonderful. I didn't think the red bell pepper would be missed if it was left out - it just made the salsa look pretty.

I enjoyed this dish a lot!  The pineapple, chipotle and cilantro are essential and made this dish really kick - sweet, spicy and cool.  The flavor is so unique!  Of course, I would advise to go easy on the chipotle, tasting as you add, because, combined with the bite of the paprika, your mouth could be on fire before you know it.  Even if a little sip of the salsa juice doesn't taste too hot, keep in mind that the effect is a lot hotter when you get a mouthful with your chicken.

This is AMAZING!!!! I use chipotle tobasco instead of making my own chili rub- works great!!! It's also pretty good if you add canned peaches to it (but don't cook them)

Loved this recipe!! My guests couldn't stop commenting on it. I used chipotle hot sauce instead of making my own puree. It was great.

I liked everything about this recipe until I added the chipotle puree. Combined w/ the pinaeapple it had a funny medicinal taste. Would make again w/o it.
