This recipe caught my eye because we love all of the ingredients!  The pizza had great color and eye appeal and the flavor was good - next time I think I would add some spices to give it more kick - maybe some garlic and italian herbs.  Also, my sundried tomatoes were quite crispy, not sure why they were charred!  Nonetheless, this was a very good recipe and I will probably make it again, albeit with a few tweaks.

This was delicious.  We used Betty Crocker's Pizza Crust Mix on a 12-inch round cookie sheet and put the toppings on the uncooked dough except for the salmon (which was put in later to prevent overcooking).  I would suggest more sundried tomatoes and a longer cooking time (we did 20 mins) for a crispier crust.  We also use part-skim mozarella to keep it healthy-ish, and that woked out great

Great appetizer...quick and easy. Used a thin crust store bought pizza and added some fire roasted tomatoes. Husband loved it and said next time let's add a salad and have for a quick week night dinner!

So good.  Served at a party and it was gone within minutes...I only got a corner piece that had the tiniest bit of salmon.

I didn't make the crust. But I used all the toppings on a frozen California Pizza Kitchen Tomato and Cheese Pizza and it was delicious.

Would make again. Swapped out 1 cup of shredded mozzarella for sliced pieces of fresh mozzarella.

Oh...so good! I had a leftover salmon filet, not smoked salmon, so I added a couple of ingredients to bring out the flavors. I spread out most of the cheese first and then sprinkled a few chopped red onions on top of the cheese, followed by the artichoke hearts, sun dried tomatoes and salmon.  Then I topped it with some fresh cilantro, the juice from half a lemon and the rest of the cheese.  My husband loved it and never asked for the crushed red peppers...usually a must on his pizza!

If you happen to have smoked salmon and ready made pizza crust on hand this is your dinner. I did not modify the ingredients, but did slightly modify the procedure. I brushed the pizza dough with the olive oil my homemade sundried tomatoes were packed in and pre-baked it for 5-7 minutes (we like it crispy). Then because we like our smoked salmon as is, I added all the ingredients except the salmon and proceeded as directed. When the pizza was done, I scattered the diced salmon over the top and served. Done this way, the salmon is so rich, you really don't need a full cup. Thank you MelissaReNea for an easy elegant pizza!
