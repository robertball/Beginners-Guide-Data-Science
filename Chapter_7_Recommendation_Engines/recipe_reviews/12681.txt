I love this recipe!  I went to an apple orchard and got jonathan apples and scaled back on the water called for to 5 cups and increased my apples to 24 cups as orchard apples tend to be juicier.) I found this out by trial as my first batch came out a little heavy on the sauce and light on apple pieces.  By doing this, my apple pie cut into neat pieces (when it cooled) without all that sauce oozing out onto the pan between slices. (Since you have decreased the water, you should also decrease your cornstarch by 1/3) I like this recipe so much that I have made 4 batches of this pie filling to freeze so I have it all winter.  This was a 5 star winner on taste, texture, appearance, how it made my house smell, how much my kids loved it, althought they hated peeling all those apples. A definate recipe to use over and over and over...and to pass down to your kids.

This makes the best apple pie filling ever. I cut the water back to 8 cups and increased the cinnamon and added more nutmeg. I have made pies both from the fresh mixture and frozen mixtures. I always make it with an oatmeal brown sugar crumb topping (different every time, just mix brown sugar, oats, butter, cinnamon, nutmeg and a little flour to help hold it together until it feels right) and have rave reviews.

I also reduce the water, but by almost 3 cups.  I make the recipe as a double batch in a 20 QT pot, so the fresh-from-the-orchard (key point) apples always make a lot of their own juice. I have found that 1 cup of apple equates closely to 1 apple, so it makes measuring them less tedious.

WONDERFUL!!!  We kept original recipe to make apple topping every year (new addition to our cupboard so we were very happy).  Our biggest mistake was not beginning the 6-8 minute cooking period immediately after apples were added to sauce (we overcooked).  That first attempt began our new tradition of apple topping !  YUMM-O!  Next we made the filling as other reviewers (24 cup apple & 5 Cup water), and lowered sugar since we were not using Granny Smith.  We began timing apple cooking IMMEDIATELY upon adding apples to sauce and only cooked 6 minutes which left apples firm - Now we have perfection!  THANK YOU FOR THIS WONDERUL RECIPE!

OH MY GOSH, this is great!!! I am a professional baker and am always looking for new formulas.  I found this to be very easy to follow and easy to prepare.  I reduced the nutmag by 1/2 and used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 granulated.  I followed the formula for the amount of apples and it didn't look like enough, so I added 3-4 cups more apples.  After the mixture cooled, I filled the pie crust and baked, the shop smelled so good.

Based on other reviews about how it made a scanty 5 pies, I increased the recipe to make 64 servings. So glad I did... it filled my 6 pie plates perfectly. I cut the water in half and for that half used 1/2 apple juice - 1/2 water. I also decreased the sugar by a cup and slightly increased the cornstarch because there is nothing I hate more than a watery pie! Everything smelled and tasted delicious. I lined 6 foil pie plates with saran wrap, then portioned out the filling. Into the freezer they go, then when frozen I'll pop them out, wrap them up and when its time to bake I can place the pre-formed filling in the crust and bake. The foil plates are slightly smaller than a traditional pie plate, so the fit is perfect.

This is a wonderful recipe in the fall when apples are so plentiful. This year, I made this recipe a few times and I have a freezer full of wonderful pie filling to use all year long. Makes a great pie! And since the apples are already cooked, the crust doesn't get overcooked waiting for the apples to cook down. I will keep this recipe forever! So great! Thanks, Terri!

I have an apple tree in the backyard and had heard you could freeze apple pie filling but never had a recipe. When I saw this recipe it was perfect timing.  I took the advice of others and reduced the water to 6 cups water to 12 cups apples. In a peach filling recipe on the website, they suggested to freeze the peaches in a foil lined pie plate with foil on top. When it froze, remove it from the plate. Cook in oven at 425 degrees on the bottom rack then lower the temperature. I tried this with this apple pie filling and it was marvelous. I look forward to another apple pie this holiday. Thanks for the recipe.

I love this recipe.  I have now used it twice for Thanksgiving pies, and everybody always loves them.  I do think that there is too much liquid, so I reduced the amount by about 1/2 cup and then when it came to a boil I let it evaporate some.  The end result was great...you could eat the filling alone it is soooo delicious!!

A great recipe, changed up the spices a bit to our own liking and used 5 cups of water. Try freezing in 5  1gallon zip bags. Place bags in the size aluminum pie tin you intend to use, so they freeze pie shaped. Then when you want to make a pie, simply line the pan with the crust and plop in the "filling puck", cover with top crust or crumb topping and bake....saves a step! Great recipe I Will definitely make this again!

Easy to make - came out great!  I used 2 *Tbs* cinnamon, but we like extra cinnamon.  The sugar needs to be adjusted - both for personal tastes and the sweetness of the apples used.  As others have said, this can be used for so much more than just making a pie - our favorite is the apple enchilades.

Very simple and easy to make.  Time is all-lots of peeling and slicing.  I used 26 apples, only 4 cups water, 1/2 brown and 1/2 white, extra cinnamon and nutmeg.  Smells wonderful.  Tastes the same.  The kids want to just eat it out of the pot!  I used a stock pot since that was all I had, worked well, just needed longer to cook.  I am going to use this to make an apple pancake, also from this site.  Also plan on using for topping for french toast.  I won't actually be making any pies!  family does not like them.  There was a bunch of extra fluid, even reducing it as much as I did.  I let it continue to cook down after removing the apples, I now have a nice jar of apple syrup!  Ready for those pancakes and french toast!

Very flavor-full!!! My daughter tried a spoonful and said it tastes just like the apple pie filling we use in our crepes! No more canned filling for me! 
I brought the water to boil and then added 2 c flour since I didn't have cornstarch or tapioca. I whisked out most of the lumps and then added 2 c white and 2 c brown sugar, 2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp all spice. You really need to watch this boiling because it will stick to the bottom. I added the apples after 2-3 min of the sauce boiling but I didn't leave the apples on the full 6-8 minutes since I wanted my apples a little more firm and the mixture was already really hot so it helped soften them just be mixing them up. I used golden delicious apples from my local orchard. Most of the "notes" are for me personally so I can remember what I did. It came out amazing - you really should try it. You won't be disappointed.

This filling is perfect.  I wouldn't make any changes to it.  I used granny smith apples and they ended up being just right, not too sweet and not too tart.  Also, the filling may seem a bit runny, but, after you bake it in a pie and it cools and sits, it stays in the slices of pie.  If you thicken it up anymore than the recipe calls for, I think you may end up with pie filling that is entirely too thick once you bake it into a pie.

Excellent filling. Could use a bit more spices and LESS WATER. Six cups was perfect for us, seven would probably be fine too.

I used the other reviews to make this recipe, then put it in pie tins like the frozen peach pie recipe.  When I needed to make a pie, I simply slipped it in the pie crust.  It turned out great.

I used half the water and sugar, doubled the spices using half cinnamon and half pumpkin pie spice, added a splash of vanilla, used my immersion blender to mash up half of the apples, used the filling for apple pie pops.
This is what I do now: 9 large apples, 9 regular sized apples, 1 1/4 cups white sugar, 2 1/2 cups apple juice, 1/2 cup cornstarch, 1 tsp salt, 1 tbsp lemon juice, 2 tsps cinnamon. Bring everything except apples to a boil, add apples, bring up to a boil, boil for 5 minutes, turn off heat and let sit for a few minutes, then I can or put in freezer containers. I make tarts, cakes or use as a topping for pancakes, waffles or crepes with this not pies as I like fresh apple pies better.

I had about 9 cups of apples that were from my grandmas back yard. I had read other peoples reviews and so I cut way back on the water. I only used four cups and I also used my slow cooker. After about 3 hours my house smelled wonderful! The kids were eating right out of the slow cooker. I let my apple filling cool and then scooped it into individual ziploc baggies. I placed them in the freezer and now when I make pancakes for the kids I unthaw a bag and pour it over thier pancakes. Delicious! Thanks for the great recipe!

Need to know when you take the filling out of the freezer, do you thaw it out before putting into pie crust and then bake or bake the filling frozen?   And, what temp and for how long.  Thanks

WOW! What a great recipe! The last time I made an apple pie, it came out too tart >:P But THIS recipe is JUST RIGHT :D I scaled the recipe down a bit, and used half brown sugar/half white sugar.   But I have a question about when you freeze the filling...When you take it out of the freezer to use, do you need to defrost it first? And can I just refrigerate the filling instead of freezing it?  Thanks for posting this recipe :) I will be using it from now on...maybe even with a homemade pie crust :D

Since I had just bought a 1/2 bushel of fresh Granny Smith apples from the orchards up in N. Georgia Mountains. I followed the advice of a couple of different ladies, because of the juice in the fresh apples. I reduced the water to only 5 cups and went with 24 cups of sliced apples and decreased the amount of cornstarch by 1/3 cup. I have to say that was BRILLIANT. It came out perfect. I used 3 tsp. of Apple Pie Seasonings, and 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 reg. sugar.  Wonderful

I've never made an apple pie before but this filling gets 5 stars from me. I cut the recipe in half and let the apples sit in a bowl filled with lemon-lime soda instead of lemon juice. Thanks for this recipe!!!!

I scaled down the recipe and added some extra cinnamon and a little vanilla.  This is a great recipe but I agree with everyone else who says there is too much water. I will probably have to "drain" the apples a little before I use this as pie filling. If you want it for anything else like the apple enchiladas (which were great) or to pour over cake or pancakes use the full amount of water.  EDIT: after the filling sat in the fridge for a few days I made a pie and did NOT drain off any liquid, the pie set up perfectly and was excellent! As a personal preference I would have liked a few more apples in the filling but this was perfect for my husband! It was not runny at all after being baked!

I had fewer apples, and rather than do math, I just went all screwy with proportions. So I ended up with a lot more liquid than I wanted.  To solve that, I scooped out the perfectly cooked apples with a slotted spoon, added a little more cornstarch and simmered the liquid a few minutes longer.

I made and froze this in September, when we went apple-picking, but didn't use any until yesterday.  It was very nice not to have to peel apples on Thanksgiving morning!  I also followed the advice of other reviewers and reduced the water to 5 cups (but didn't reduce the cornstarch), and increased the apples to 24 cups.  I prefer a sweeter apple for my pies (Cortland (doesn't brown too quickly), Fuji, Rome Beauty) so I will reduce the sugar to 2 to 2 1/2 cups the next time I make this (I usually use streusel topping, and this also adds plenty of sugar).  Also, my favorite filling includes ginger and mace, so I will be including those spices the next time I make this.  I will definitely use this recipe as a starting point.  Thanks, Terri! Updtate: One of my boys wanted an apple cake for his birthday, so I used one of my containers of this filling: 1/3 blended into a yellow cake mix along with a bunch of cinnamon, 1/3 to fill between the layers, and 1/3 to top the cake (sort of like a German Chocolate Cake works). Then I frosted the sides with a tub of purchased cream cheese frosting, to which I had added more cinnamon, some ground ginger, and a little nutmeg. It was beautiful, and tasted fabulous!  I've got to upgrade my rating from 4 stars to 5.

Great recipe. I agree with previous reviews... there is too much water, but I encourage you to make it "as is". When I make a batch, I take out about 1-2 cups of the liquid and put it in a dressing bottle (the kind that you get for free when you make itallian dressing). It makes a great topping to icecream, pancakes, french toast... you name it! I put the rest in pies or the freezer. When I bake it, it holds together wonderfully and tastes phenomenol! I encourage you to try this recipe and tweak it to your needs :)

This filling tastes good, but there is way too much water called for. I made the 24 serving amount and had to add about a cup of flour to thicken it enough to be a pie filling. I ran out of corn starch since I only had enough for what the recipe called for. I also doubled the cinnamon and put in less sugar: 2 cups instead of 2-2/3.

Yum-E!  I made this last night with the extra granny smiths I had from the tree out back.  I added an extra 1/2 cup of sugar since the apples were so tart and used only 5 cups of water.  I did use 1 tblsp of cinnamon, but I still don't think that was quite enough (I'll be adding more when I use it in a pie).  I also added 1/4 c of unsalted butter to give it a little richness.  I only wish the recipe included a bake time for a pie using this filling.

This was great, but I did end up with about 2 cups of liquid apple starchy goo that wouldn't fit into the pie, so water/cornstarch could be seriously reduced.  I've been using the goo to make oatmeal.  I also had trouble with the baking...first it was frozen in the middle, then over cooked.  I'll have to experiment some next time.  I also prefer to thicken my pie with flour instead of cornstarch, but that is easy enough to fix.

2011:On my second year of making it.  On the advice of other, cutting down the water is a must.  Flavor excellent.

An update 2017: I still make the original but this year I also tried it with pears. It came out great. I cut down on the water and probably could have done more. 4 cups would have been perfect. I also cut down on the sugar, 3 cups used. My pears were very ripe and juicy so there was no need for the extra liquid or sugar. I only heated until the pears were warm so they didn't over cook when making a cobbler or pie later.  I will definitely make it again with pears.

Absolutely amazing apple pie filling. I used some of it the same night and it was a little watery, but not bad. Consistency is much better after freezing overnight and then thawing. I'll definitely be going apple picking this fall and make a big batch!

This is a fantastic recipe for those of us who don't can, but want to preserve an abundance of apples.  Depending on the variety of apple used, I tend to adust the sugar accordingly, as more can always be added to suit the intended recipe.  Sometimes I substitute equal parts apple juice for the water which imparts a more apple-y taste.  Thanks to this recipe, I now have 7 quarts prepared apples in my freezer.  Pie anyone??

After carefully looking through recipies for this, I choose this one, but used others suggestions.  I only used 8 cups of water because I had orchard apples.  This came out soooooo good.  To save space (and containers) I storred them in heavy duty zip top bags and put all of the small bags into a larger freezer bag, so they are all in the same place. If this tastes the same after freezing as it does now, I will be using this recipe every year!!!

I really don't like apple pie, I've told myself that for years... 
The other day my wife asked me to get some apples so I bought some USA Granny Smith's which were quite sharp and put to one side... My wife began having a craving for apple pie two days ago so today I bought all the ingredients and made the apple-pie filling. It's absolutly delicious!  I surprised myself... and my wife...

This really had all the perfect proportions except I made it with 2 cups of water for every 2 and 1/2 cups of water in the recipe. I also cooked it for double the time, but maybe that is because I sliced my apples a little bit thicker.

I cut the water back also.  I always put the filling in a pie plate & freeze it.  When frozen, free it from the plate and slip it into a plastic bag.  Store in the freezer until ready to bake.  This way it is all ready to place in the prepared pie plate.

I cut the sugar back by half and easily could have scaled it back to one cup.  The first batch I made had too much liquid so on the second batch I added another four cups of sliced apples....that made it perfect.  Either add more apples, or reduce your liquid.  I used an extra 1/4 tsp of nutmeg.

I LOVE this recipe. I agree with previous raters that it does need to have a tiny bit less water, but only because the fresh apple slices have so much juice that they make up for it. I also soaked the heck out of the apples (they were golden delicious and a bit sweet to start with) this helped keep the recipe a little bit more tart than sweet. I also added a teaspoon of apple pie spice for a little bit stronger apple pie flavor. I've made apple pies, apple pie in a jar, and used this for ice cream and waffle topping. Its sooo yummy! I'm bad with leftovers, so I converted it to about one pie size (8 servings US), and added about 2 more extra cups of apple slices, and it was sooo good! I highly to everyone who likes apple pie. Thanks for the submission! ^.^

I wanted a nice apple filling for an Apple Coffee Cake I'm going to make this week and this is fantastic. Cortlands were not available at the market so I used Macintosh. Hard to believe a slug like me can produce a filling like this. Thank you, Terri - we'll be thinking of you when we're all enjoying our coffee cake :D

Recipe is very easy and tastes very well. I did though add a bit more cinnamon to the recipe. Can't wait to make a pie out of this filling.

This was a very nice recipe. My orchard apples where very juicy even though i cut the water to add down to 5 cups i still had way to much liquid.

This is a lovely filling! Sweet and tasty, but could use a little less water, like many reviews have mentioned. I scaled it down to make enough for just one pie, since I didn't have enough apples for the full recipe. I also added extra cinnamon for that great, "warm up the house" scent, and it wasn't too much at all! A great, easy easy easy recipe! Thanks!

I followed the advise of one of the reviews and decreased the water to 5 cups and increased the apples to 24 cups. It was PERFECT!!  This is a delicious, great recipe and a wonderful way to use 50lbs of apple from the orchard!

EXCELLENT!  I have finally found a use for the numerous amounts of apples that my tree produces (well another use besides all of the neighborhood kids throwing them at each other - HA).  This was easy, delicious, and very universal in that it can be used for pies or just heated with ice cream on top.  Thanks so much Terri!

Very good apple pie filling.  I halved the recipe, using nine cups of apples, and also halved the recommended amount of water, starting out with 2.5 cups water.  The addition of 1/2 cup cornstarch made a thick syrup, so I added water a total of one additionaal cup water for the consistency we wanted.  I subbed allspice for nutmeg.

Yum!  This is perfect as written.  I had 25 c of apples, so I adjusted ingredients accordingly. My daughter and I like cinnamon, so we added 3 tsp per recipe.   My kids want to eat it out of the pot!  Thanks for a great recipe.  I will be doing this one again.

This was good, did not have nutmeg used allspice and cardamom.  Someone mentioned using full liquid amounts and using reserve for ice cream.  Must do.  I put my leftover liquid(of love) over vanilla bean ice cream.  I made yummy noises every bite.  Will make again.

I have made this a few years in a row with the apples from my neighbor's tree.  She doesn't spray them, they look awful, but they are delicious.  Hubby loves this because he can take one out of the freezer and make his own pie when the mood strikes.

This was great tasting and easy to make. I would rate five stars, but I had to boil them a bit longer than the recipe called for to get the apples as tender as I like.

I used 25 apples and the same amount of liquid and found it to still have too much sauce. After draining a little off I had enough of the sauce to add pears for 2 more pies. But the flavor is excellent.

I used Splenda instead of sugar for my grandpa who is diabetic and it worked out great! the flavor was perfect the only thing is it came out a little runny (two much water) which I noticed other reviewers experienced so I don't think it was because of the Splenda so Ill use less water next time. This was surprisingly easy to make-the apple prep took the longest (which you have to do anyway) but the rest of the recipe was a breeze just a lot of stirring when you put the sugar corn starch cin, salt and nut meg together to boil. (if you don't mix consistently it clumps up so don't skip on mixing. I will make again thanks!

This was good. I cut the sugar by half. As another reviewer mentioned, the amount of sugar you use can depend on the sweetness of the apples and personal preference. It will be nice to have this in the freezer ready to use.

I just made this for the first time today.      I also reduced the sugar to 2 cups and the water to 4 cups      The next time I would probably reduce the sugar a little more (maybe 1 1/2) and leave the water the same or even reduce it a little.  If I keep the water the same, I would add a little more cornstarch.    I also made a second batch with Splenda and was pleased with the results but would alter the recipe the same as mentioned above.

I changed a few things as well based on other people's reviews.  Used 20 cups of apples, but should have used about 22-24 cups as there was lots of sauce.   I used 8 cups of water and kept corn starch at 1 cup.  Also added extra cinnamon and nutmeg as husband said it "needs more kick".  Turned out really well! Would have rated at 5 stars if I hadn't needed to make changes. :)

I definitely plan on using this recipe again! I doubled the amount of apples tho, the filling was too runny. I froze portions of it and use it all year round. Just empty it into a pie shell and add 3 more freshly peeled apples and bake! Perfect!

I used my own home canned apple slices to make this filling. I skipped the lemon juice and nutmeg (not a fan of nutmeg). Basically, I boiled the ingredients without the apples until it came to the right consistency and then threw in the apples. My apples were already cooked so this took me maybe 5 minutes. Tasted just like apple pie straight out of the pot!!

Incredible!!! I used 5 cups water for each batch (i did a double batch in my large stockpot) and 1 cup apple cider and i doubled the cinnamon in each batch.. but it was absolutely incredible!! and the best part is i have enough for 10 pies! i individually froze each pie portion so i can just take it out of the freezer every time i need a pie. It tastes wonderful! Thank you for the great recipe!! My friends and family are raving over it!!

This is by far the BEST filling. I didn't change a thing. However, next time I may add a few more apples since mine were small apples. The taste is excellent. It's not too sweet! Thank you so much for putting this up Terri.

I made this a while back because I was gifted with quite a few apples and they were starting to go bad. I froze some of it and just used the last batch. Let me tell you, this is great! It was so delicious in the many different recipes I used it in. It is not highly spiced, so it leaves room for you to add in more cinnamon if that is your preference (it was surely mine) But I will definitely use again when the need arises. Thanks for sharing.

Very nice! I didn't make this store...I wanted to use it immediately so I cut this down to 8 Servings. Also, I had a graham cracker crust on hand, so instead of using a regular pie crust (as with all apple pies) I used a graham cracker crust. The crust was baked for approx 10 mins. I allowed the pie filling to cool before pouring it into the crust. And then I popped it back into the oven for anoth 5-6 mins. When eaten immediately, I found that (as is obvious) the graham cracker crust doesn't hold up really well) but after leaving it in the fridge for a while it set completely and there was no crumbling. Lovely. I didn't have any left over crumb but otherwise sprinkling that over the pie before the final baking would make it lovelier!

I have made this several times, and it's always been great.  I do think that the recipe as it's stated has too much sauce for the amount of apples, so I cut the liquid amount in half and use more apples than called for.

Delicious!!!  I made this per instructions except I only added 6 cups of water which was plenty.  I froze some and used the rest for filling in apple enchiladas recipe from this site and it was amazing!!  This would also be great on pancakes or even topping for vanilla ice cream.  I hate the taste of canned filling, ick!! This was so worth making it instead!!!

I was looking for a good freezer recipe for the ton of apples we picked at the orchard this fall.  We spent all afternoon making a couple batches of this along with another recipe on this site for applesauce (sarah's applesauce), which both turned out really good!  The only thing I would do differently on this recipe is to not overcook the apples.  They were a little on the mushy side after I baked a pie.  Other than that, this was a tasty and good way to use all those extra apples!!  Thank you for the recipe!

Great standard recipe, good for beginners. Use less water though. As other have said it can be very water, but still tasty. Freezes well.

I was given a bunch of apples and I wanted to make an apple cobbler to take to Bible study tonight.  I scaled the recipe down for two pies.  I did as other reviewers suggested and cut the amount of water in half.  This is by far the most beautiful cobbler I have ever made and the flavor is out of this world.  I will be using this recipe to do up the rest of the apples for the freezer.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Wow!!  You saved the day, or at least dessert!  I was making a fruit pizza & crust was done...everyone already psyched for apple but then found out, no canned filling!  Scaled it down to 8 svgs. & this was so much better!  Used lg. 1 Pink Lady & 3 med. Gala.  Didn't measure the nutmeg so prob. added extra.  Easy & so good!

I would suggest cutting back on the amount of water. I added more cinnamon, just because it's a personal preference. Otherwise, great recipe, my family loved it.

Just made this with my backyard apple tree, pink ladys. I had approximately  16 cups of sliced apples. I also after reading many of the reviews, cut back the water to 5 cups. I did 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 granulated sugar.  Cut back the corn starch to a heaping 1/2 cup. The rest I followed the recipe except I added a few shakes of vanilla powder. Oh I did increase the cinnamon to a heaping 3 tsp. Yummy!

Very tasty! I followed the recipe except to halve the amount of water and cornstarch used like others suggested. This gave it a very nice apple to sauce ratio.

Made 5 of these pies (one recipe) for my church's big fund-raiser.  I did the 2 c brown sugar 2 c white w/ 1 c cornstarch, 2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp allspice.  I used 6 c water, and then gradually added more at times when it looked too thick, or was heating up too fast (all those apples to peel!).  

Also, I originally only made four pies (7 large granny smith apples, 2 medium gala apples and 9 small 'premium' apples).  It was enough to fill four 9" foil-lined pie plates albeit to a low enough level that I worried they would end up sunken when baked (they didn't, they were flat but fine).  

However, I had so much left-over 'syrup' that I decided to make a fifth pie for us.  8-9 smallish granny smith apples filled up a 10' deep dish glass pie plate.  All I had to do was add some water and re-heat the 'syrup', then make it the same as before.

Also: I used the Make Ahead Pie Crust by SUPERMOMOF4 for these pies and it worked well--see my review of it.

My only issues with this filling is two: one, it takes MUCH LONGER to bake frozen filling.  I tried the 15 min @ 450, 35 min @ 350 time and NOPE--the filling would be barely lukewarm.  I always ended up sticking it back in for another half hour.  Upping the time at 450 resulted in an overly-browned crust, so by the time I was baking the last pies I went with 15 min @ 450, 50 min @ 350.  

Issue two: this filling simply doesn't compare in taste to Grandma Ople's (also on allrecipes).  It's good, but a little bland; it doesn't explo

I made mine with just 8 cups water and it was still too much,....! Cut water back by 2-3 cups and subtract 1-2 cups sugar as well! Make a slurry of the corn starch with COLD water, than add in a drizzle, whisking constantly,.....adding the apples last.

I love this recipe. . I have 2 apple trees in my yard and needed to find an easy yet amazing recipe, I have found it! I did some adjustments though. . I only used 6 cups  water but did 1/2 apple juice and  1/2 water and I did use 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar.. It turned out great. I have since used this recipe several times now!

made this recipe taking into the advice from other reviews and used half the water and 24 cups of apples sliced and so far so good! super simple recipe but I have one question, what temp and for how long should I bake the pies when ready to do so? I am new to the world of pies and am not sure the normal baking times and temps I should use. Thanks :)

Delicious!!! I absolutely love this apple pie filling! Thanks to others who mentioned filling a foil pie pan and freezing it... it was so easy to pop right in the pie crust and bake. I used this filling with French Pastry Pie Crust from Allrecipes.

Update: I made some Jack-o-Lantern Apple Hand  Pies. First, reduce the recipe to 8 servings. Only use 1/2 cup of water. Cut the apples in small pieces. Follow the rest of the directions. Make your own pie crust or use store bought pie crust. I made 12 hand pies using a 3 inch biscuit cutter.  Add about 2 - 3 tsp. of filling in the middle. Add a stem use water to wet dough to add stem. Use a small sharp paring knife to cut a pumpkin face on the top of one of the circles. Use your finger to wet the rim of the bottom circle. Add top and seal. Crimp edges with a fork. Brush the hand pie with an egg wash. Sprinkle orange sprinkles on top. Spray a foil lined pan with cooking spray. Bake for 14 min at 375 degrees or until done. To freeze pie filling: This  was an excellent recipe. I did follow the suggestions of other people who reviewed this recipe. I used 1/2 of the water, increased the cinnamon and added nutmeg. The pie filling came out perfect.  It was the first time freezing any type of fruit filling. Next Fall, I will get a bushel of apples and make some pie filling to have for the whole year.

Great recipe I cut it down to 10 servings to make two apple pies. I add a bit more cinnamon, nutmeg, and I add a bit of all spice. Every time I make it, it comes out perfectly.

We love this recipe! Of course I read the other reviews and adjusted the water and maybe the sugar (after a while, recipes run together lol). I did make one addition, I added cranberries to 4 of the quarts I made. I just bought more cranberries so when I make this again, I will have them on hand to add to the whole batch! The pie with the cranberries lasted overnight before it was gone

This recipe was so easy and was perfect way to use a bunch of apples. I did add a 3rd Tablespoon of cinnamon and I doubled the nutmeg since I like a spicy and rich filling.

Just made this today. The warm filling tasted wonderful in the pan-I can't wait to prepare my Thanksgiving pie with these! I did decrease the amount of water and halved all the other ingredients because I didn't have 18 cups of apples(I approximate about 12 cups). This is just the recipe I have been looking for.

We picked a ton of apples at an orchard last year and I needed to use the apples quickly before my youngest was born, so I made this filling to put in the freezer for an easy pie or other dessert.  I just pulled some out of the freezer yesterday (yes, a YEAR LATER) and it was delicious!  I made an apple crisp with it.  The only issue I had was that there wasn't enough "sauce" when I finally baked it..which is probably why people thought there was too much water in the recipe.  I cut down on the water like other reviewers said, but I don't think that they took into account what the freezer process would do to the sauce.  Next time I would add all the water to it so that it has a lot of sauce and then when I baked it, it would be the perfect amount.  DELICIOUS!

Wonderful flavor but....  I cut the water to 8 cups and added 2 more cups of apples... was still way too much liquid.  I did add a heaping teaspoon of vanilla after cooking... All in all a VERY good recipe.

This recipe is Awesome!!  I cut it back cause I only needed the filling for one pie.  Next time I will make as listed and freeze cause it is that good.
I admit, it was a little saucy, but I like the sauce while my husband likes the apples.  So having some on reserve for myself is Great.  I also had a couple spoonfuls of sauce after I put the reserve in a bottle and am at this moment eating it on toast.  Yum! Yum! Yum! and did I mention Yum!?

I have to say, I'm impressed!  This was the first time making a pie filling that was to be frozen.   I froze them for about a month and just opened one today.  I loved how thick the filling was, with just the right amount of apples.  I used a crumb topping on this and it was TO.DIE.FOR!!  I'll definitely be saving this, as we own an orchard and always have an abundance of apples!  THANKS for such a great recipe, that's easy!

Just cooked this up. It's cooling now!! SO glad I reduced the water to 5 cups. Left all the rest exactly as is!! I picked apples last weekend on an apple farm where my mom lives. They are Auvil Fuji's. The filling is DELICIOUS!! Can't wait to make my first pie!!

I never knew that I could make my own pie filling like you could buy in the store. I always just added my ingredients into a pie shell and baked it.  I love the way this turned out.  I did change the amount of apples to about 24 cups, added 3 tablespoons of corn starch, increased nutmeg to 1 teaspoon and added a teaspoon of cloves. It is absolutely delish! Thanks for the recipe. I'll be making this one again, and again.  :)

Used apples we got from my friend's apple tree (granny smith?) Made good pie filling but was way too much water, I think. I cut back to 7 c and it was still very saucy. 5 would be good, but adjust the cornstarch accordingly or it will be glue. I used 2 c. white sugar and 1 c. brown sugar. Heavenly.

Made this exactly as instructed and froze. Still enjoying this months later! Everyone LOVES it. I make mine "French" with a brown sugar and butter topping instead of adding more crust on top. I'll be making more to freeze for this next year, as this was a hit!

I first tried this recipe when I rescued dozens of  apples after a blow down (before the squirrels cold make off with them!). My pies got such raves reviews that now it's my Go To recipe for apple pie. I find that it only fills four pies, but I think that's because my home grown apples (of a forgotten variety)  are on the small side :-).

Very good. Nice balance of spice without being overdone. I thought there was a little too much liquid to apples once it was cooked but that was easily fixed, I simply removed a few spoonfuls (I would rather have too much than not enough). I used this pie filling to make an Apple Spice cake that called for apple pie filling. Loved using my own instead of buying a can.

This was really easy to do and I scaled it back to make only what I needed. I prefer to add extra apples, as if it's too saucy it's a bit too sweet for me. Plus, I add ground cloves. Great recipe though.

For Thanksgiving I am thankful for this recipe b/c it was a hit. A+, Very very good. And if you have guests that are diabetic, or are lowering their calories, and sugar intake I replaced the sugar with Truvia baking blend (just follow packaging measure conversion), it was wonderful and with no aftertaste. And as for the water just put in enough water to cover your apples, and add more/or less depending on the type of apples used. and don't forget to change the serving size to edit your measurements for the ingredients (the above recipe calls for 5 pies)

This is so easy and so delicious.  It is better than the canned filling from the store because there are so many more whole slices and not so much of the jelly

The flavor is great!  Despite the problems I had with this recipe, I'm giving it the 5 star rating for the flavor, and because I know how to fix my problems. Based on other reviews, I used 8 cups of water instead of 10, and decreased the cornstarch from 1 cup to one half cup. I used 3x 3lb bags of Granny Smith apples, and even with the amendments, there was a quart of juice left after using all of the apples to fill my pie shells.  I have decided to use 4 bags of apples next time  (each bag is about 8 cups), keep the water at 8 cups, but use the entire 1 cup of cornstarch.  I filled 3x 9" pie shells plus an 8" pie shell.  When this recipe says it makes 5 pies, it must mean 5x 8" pies.  My husband loves the flavor, so I know I have ended my quest for the perfect pie filling recipe.

I scaled this recipe down to one pie's worth of filling. It sounded pretty bland, so I doubled the cinnamon and quadrupled the nutmeg. I also used sweetener instead of sugar to axe calories. Overall, I found: 1. There was not enough apples for the amount of sauce, and 2. there was not enough filling (apples AND sauce) to fill one pie.

Despite having to add more apples, and make a whole extra batch to fill my pie, I'll give this recipe five stars. I'm an absolute novice cook- engaged, and trying to build my recipe repertoire. This filling is very easy to make, and it seems like it would lend itself well to other pies, if one substituted different fruits and spices- a real keeper. Thank you for posting!

I wanted to make a can of apple pie filling (my recipe called for two) so I scaled this back to 10 and made it with 6 cups of granny smith apples. I scaled the water back to 1 1/2 cups and this made a great tasting filling that was the right consistency to come out of a can. Also cut the sugar down to 1 cup. Thanks!

I wanted to find a recipe online that didn't involve the long process of canning. I found this recipe and I am glad I did. It was very good. On another note like the other reviews said this yielded too much liquid. I only had 5lbs of Golden Delicious apples so I used Allrecipes conversion caluculator to figure out ingredients. I ended up cutting out 3/4 cup of water because I had no idea how much to take out. I could have taken a little more out. Also I could have cut out a little bit of the sugar since I used golden delicious apples. Overall this is a great recipe. I will make this again. 
*This makes a great apple crisp filling.

Due to a bumper crop of apples at a neighbor's house I decided to try this recipe. Absolutely great! I was first concerned that the spices would not be enough flavor but still followed the recipe as written. WOW! We probably will not get the five pies out of it as one containers is in the refrigerator and is half gone (warmed in the microwave for ice cream topping and a side dish to pork.) Thanks for a great recipe Terri, a definite "keeper." Now onto applesauce and apple butter for the season.

I have a macintosh apple tree in my back yard and was dreading what to do with them. I searched and found this recipe. I loved the reviews so changed it a bit myself. I used 2 1/2 cups of brown sugar, 2 cups of white sugar. Increased the apples to 22 cups and reduced the water to 8 cups. Amazing. I think I'll make a couple more batches.

Reduced water as so many others suggested.  It was very easy to make and made my house smell wonderful!  I just used some to make apple crisp for my family and this is the BEST pie filling!  Yum!

THIS sounds Dee-licious!!  ; ) We go to the orchard every year, so I think we'll make up a few batches of these for the freezer! And some of the reviews also sound good for this recipe too! Thanks Terri for a great recipe!!!

A little too much water for me. Good flavor though. Next time I will cut down on the water and add more cornstarch.

I just made the filling and it tastes so good!  I only had enough sugar for 2 cups, but this is the perfect sweetness for me.  I can't imagine how sweet it would be with the full amount, and am glad I only did 2 cups.  I am excited to freeze the batches and use it in apple crisps and other yummy apple desserts!

This is great!  I have used it for pie, dump cake and pancake topping.  I also plan on using it in muffins!  A great way to use extra apples at the end of the season.

This was so wonderful! It tasted great and the cinammon was just the right amount. The sugar is adjustable depending on the sweetness of the apples you're using. I think this was just the right dessert for a Christmas dinner. I read some of the other people's comments, and they said the sauce was too liquidy. I think they used the sauce either freshly made, or after 30 mins of cooling. I skipped the cooling and simply put it in the freezer for 45-50 minutes. The result was outstanding. I definitely recommend it to anyone and everyone. Thank you so much for this recipe! I have to pass it on through the next generations of my family.

I made pie for the very first time, and your filling recipe made it a success! The aroma & taste were perfect.  (I give this 4 stars though because of the excess water, I cut down the water in half - thanks to other reviewers, but I found that it was still a lot, perhaps next time I'll put 1/4th the amount given here) Anyway, this recipe is definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing! :)

I scaled this back to 8 servings to make the equivalent of a can of filling.  I was impressed by how quick it was and i didn't even boil mine for as long as it stated.  i was a little heavy handed with the cinnamon, but it tasted like apple butter so i wasn't complaining!  Next time i will use flour instead of cornstarch..thats just a personal prefernce.  very good recipe

this recipe tastes great and was a life saver when my boyfriend brought home 2 giant crates of apples and asked if i could do something with them.  i did have to reduce the water by almost half... and instead of lemons i used orange's and about 5 table spoons of that.(boyfriend also brought about 30 oranges.)

This had a good flavor and jelled well in the pie, but I would have liked more apples and less filling. Maybe a bit "flour" tasting.

This came out great, even months later, still delicious.  I used apples Jonah Gold apples straight from the orchard.  I cut the liquid to 6 cups (4c. apple juice) which worked great for us.  It made 4 large pies for us - got rave reviews each time, I still have one left.

This an easy pie filling when you want to make just a few batches. I scales it down to 10 servings which was exactly right for two pies. I made it a few days in advance and kept it in the fridge for my company so I can't so how well it freezes; however, it did do very well in the fridge and made great pies!

5 Stars with only 3-4 cups of water. I read other reviews and cut the water down to 4 cups to 18 cups of apples and you could still reduce to 3 cups. Easy to make and turned out great, I used a variety of apples from many different neighbors and it tasted great in the end. I also reduced the sugar to 2 cups as I wanted something on the less sweet side. A great recipe.

This apple pie filling was SOOOOOOO yummy, I was fighting to keep my daughter and her spoon out of the saucepan that I was cooking them in! However, I used it to make apple crepes, so I didn't need as much as this recipe called for, so I reduced the servings & scaling from 40 to 4.  The only other thing I changed about the recipe is that I doubled the amount of apples (I used Golden Delicious) because it was too saucy with the amount of apples the recipe called for.  Apple pie is next and I can't wait to make one with this recipe!  Thank you so much for posting it!   :)

Yummy!  I decreased both the sugar and the water after reading the reviews and produced a delicious treat!  We have enjoyed it warm over vanilla ice cream as well as with peanut butter in a sandwich!  I highly recommend trying both!  I also added some ginger and cloves since we like them in our apple dishes!

I was intrigued by this recipe when I saw Paul's post. I needed to use up some apples, so I scaled this way down to use only 2 cups of apples. I made apple waffles and apple tarts (recipe from the quality cook). Thanks for the inspiration! This is really a great way to make use of apples, though I didn't freeze any.

I really enjoyed i, though it took no time at all to make, only made two servings! Made a small mistake though, used corn flour instead of cornstarch, but couldn't tell so it worked out! will use corn starch next time! since we have an apple tree, there will be alot of next times!

I only used 3\5 of the water and had to add a little more starch, but that may have been because I used Granny Smith apples. It was pretty good and easy, although seemed to be missing something. I will keep looking for other recipe, but would definately fall back on this one.

I, too, reduced the water to 5 cups and added more apples. What a great recipe, though, my husband did most of the work and he was very impressed...I was afraid we wouldn't have any left for freezing after he got his hands on the finished product!

I was looking for a good apple filling recipe that would be good with french toast (pockets), and this was GREAT. Not too sweet just right for my taste and others. I'll be using this again for a other apple recipes.

So I wanted an apple pie filling with some ooey gooey goodness and this delivered exactly that. I changed the number of servings from 40 to 10, I just wanted enough for one pie to try out the recipe. At 10 servings it says 4 and a half cups of apples, I used 5 because I like more apple pieces. It also called for 2 and a half cups of water and I used half of that. Everything else I followed. Made the filling, let it sit and cool a bit while I made my crust, and then cooked the pie like I normally would. I didn't see anyone else using the filling right away so I wanted to try it and let you know how it went...in case anyone else wondered if it would work out without freezing it ??

Made this as stated in recipe and would not change a thing.  SO convenient!  Did freeze in foil pie plates as reviewers suggested.  Totally delicious, husband wouldn't leave it alone.

Best filling  for apple pie I ever had. I actually used gala apples which still had some crunch after I baked the pie and the texture was amazing!

Terrific for apple picking season; I always end up with WAY more apples than I can eat right away.

Just as others suggested, I cut the amount of of water & cornstarch by a third. I also added 1/4 cup butter and 1 tsp more  cinnamon.

Nice and thick. I did 8 cups of Granny Smith apples and did just under 1/2 cup corn flower, I used allspice and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon because I didn't have enough cinnamon. 8 cups of apples is about right for one pie. I also used 2 cups of white sugar and just mixed all ingredients in which worked fine. You can’t really stuff this recipe up to be honest and you can easily make additions to suit your preferences.

This recipe is good for giving a great method for freezing filling but the quantities didn't work for me (as other reviewers have mentioned).  After some trial and error, I found what works for us. 
For 2 pies I used 3 # Granny Smith apples, 2 tsp. lemon juice, 2 1/2 cups water, 1 cup sugar, 1/4 corn starch, 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. salt, 1/4 tsp. ginger, 1/8 tsp. nutmeg.

I made this recipe as written. I did indeed have an excessive amount of liquid. That being said I was able to remove some via a colander and big bowl. Reserving the liquid for later I was able to make pies. The time saved alone in making pies gets me to give four stars the fifth came from the taste. I took the remaining liquid and reduced it until it was nice and thick. I added about four tablespoons of butter and made a nice apple pie caramel sauce. Made the Apple pie ala mode I had even better! Orchard apples are definitely juicier than store bought apples. So if you don’t have the time or patience to make a nice sauce then reduce cooking water to at least eight cups. Adjust corn starch to suit thickness of your sauce. Over all it’s a recipe I will use again and again.

I made a pie from it and used a butter pie crust recipe. It was delicious.  I read the reviews and it seemed a general consensus to cut down the amount of water used. I took the advice and ended up using 6 cups of water and a little more cinnamon than called for.  It was delicious.  I would probably divide the recipe into 3 containers instead of 5. I like deep dish apple pie.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  I'd share a picture, but it's pretty much gone.

As others suggested, I added some nutmeg and cloves and used half white and half brown sugar. I also reduced the water to 4 cups since I was using fresh picked apples. I think I could have reduced it even more. The final product tastes delicious - so much better than filling from a can! I can’t wait to bake a pie!

Very good!  I will be adding this one to my book. The only changes I made was 1/2 the water and 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar. I made 1 pie and put the rest in bags for my seal machine and froze for latter on. Thanks

Way to much liquid, but the taste was amazing. I canned the finished product to save for the winter months. Can't wait to make a Thanksgiving pie with the contents!

Good apple pie filling.  And I love the idea of bulk preparation for freezing  and later quick use.  First dish I made with this was a Apple Streusel that the whole family enjoyed.

I actually cut back on the servings I made with this as I wanted a homemade apple pie filling that made less. I used it in a 2 ingredient recipe which was very easy to make. I thought it had a little too much cinnamon but my husband loved it. Ate most of what I made in 2 days and raved about how good it was. So glad you can scale down recipes on this site if you need to. Thanks for the recipe.

Used Granny Smith apples and made the recipe exactly as described.  Just had 1/2 cup of the apples after they cooled and they are wonderful!  Looking forward to making my caramel apple pies (dot with chopped soft Werther's caramels before top crust) for the Holidays without all of the fuss and mess. ;o)

Great recipe! The only changes I made were to add a half tsp cinnamon and a pinch more nutmeg. I also cut the recipe in 3, as I only had 6 cups of apples.

I really like this recipe and so does everyone in the family. But I agree with some of the other comments about cutting back on the amount of water probably by about a 1/3.

Other reviewers suggested reducing the water by half, which I did and I have a nice thick tasty filling.  May use a little less sugar next time as I like it a little tart.
I used Granny Smith apples from the grocery.

I adjusted the recipe to 10 servings and used honey instead of sugar. Loved it! ? 10 servings will produce between 2-3 pies, depending on how much you fill them. I suggest doubling the cinnamon, or else the flavor will not be noticeable. Also, add an extra bit of cornstarch for a less runny filling.

Besides being a really large amount, this recipe is delicious! I've made it with the recipe measurements and also by cutting it in half. This is definitely my favorite apple pie recipe.

I have made two pies from this recipe (with two to go)! Delicious.  I did reduce the sugar per some of the other reviews and it was just great. I might up the cinnamon next time I make this. The consistency was perfect and did not leak all over the pie plate. A homemade pie crust (using a little vodka) made it the perfect pie that sat beautifully on the dessert plate. I got the crust recipe from a well known instructional cook book.  This is my new go-to recipe when I have lots of apples!

Excellent recipe.  Made twice, first as directed, second time, I tweaked from my knowledge and experience of baking. Two things:

If using Granny Smith apples, keep the sugar.   Any other, i.e. Golden Delicious,  Honeycrisp, etc., consider reducing sugar by at least a quarter.  I reduced by half when using Honeycrisps.

Perfect 'easy' recipe as-is for topping pancakes, french toast, waffles, ice cream, etc.  REDUCE WATER by at least a third (I went half, had extra juicy apples) if using as a pie filling.  Soppy, soggy mess otherwise.Terrific freezer recipe, especially for use as a topper.  Thus, 5 stars for versatility and ease, 4 for flavor and consistency.  I have put away 12 pints of this recipe for use at brunches, breakfast and desserts. Thank you for a great recipe.

I did enjoy this recipe, however, I followed Vicky Gunkel's advice (most positive review) and cut back on the water and cornstarch and added more apples. Loved the filling and it was a great way to make use of our abundant crop of apples this year! Yum!

I made 1/2 batch last year and canned it. It made great pie. I used Mutsu apples which are huge (each apple makes 2 cups). This year I made a full recipe and canned it. Because I  canned it, hot water bath for 20 minutes, I didn't cook it for more than a minute or two after adding the apples.  I got 6 quarts, plus a pint and a half of extra syrup which will be great over pancakes or waffles.

Beautifully put together filling! I absolutely loved it. I used it to fill 2 nine inch pie shells and used a lattice crust to top it. Although I will use less water the next time I use this recipe. Regardless it was an amazing taste.

Great recipe to use up fallen apples. As other reviewers suggested, I halved the water to 5 cups, and it still seemed pretty saucy. Next time I'll add more apples as well. Tastes delicious though!

I will definatly make this again! 
     I didn't have nutmeg so i used, some cloves, pumpkin pie spice and a bit of ground ginger ,vanilla extract  as well as using splenda in place of sugar. It turned out very  good, consistancy is what i was looking for. I cant say if i actually added all 10 cups of water i just put water in my pan, the only measurment i followed was 3 cups splenda. Im really bad at measuring out i just dump. All i know is it is good!

As others suggested, I cut back on the water, about five cups.  Perfect!  The house smelled heavenly while it was brewing on the stove.  I froze it in containers that hold just the right amount for one pie, cobbler, etc.  It's wonderful to get all the work done at one time and then just pop a container out to thaw when I want to make a pie or some other apple dessert.

I cut the water to 6 cups and corn starch to 2/3 (I like fillings heavy on the fruit). Awesome!! Could -maybe did :)-eat just the sauce with a spoon. Delicious!

Way too much water and not enough cinnamon. I would reduce the water by half next time and add 2 tbsp cinnamon rather than 2 tsp. I'd also add a bit of cloves and I used brown sugar rather than white sugar to get a richer and deeper taste.

Awesome recipe.  We cut the white sugar to 3 cups and added 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar.  Makes having a homemade apple pie so easy when you just thaw out the filling & pour it in the crust.  Delicious!  Thank you!

I am a pie maker and decided to try this-  I read the reviews and took the apple liquid drained it and cooked it down before freezing it.   The result was it was still too full of liquid to allow the crust to cook properly.

Great and easy to make recipe! I didn't change anything about it so I ended up with extra syrup which I peeled more apples and placed raw in 2 heated quart jars then added that extra boiling syrup and canned it! I was able to get 5 frozen quarts and 2 canned quarts. Next time I do think I will cut back on the sugar though.

You can freeze this recipe in plastic lined aluminum pie tins. After frozen, put each "pie puck" into gallon freezer bags. When you want to make an apple pie, slip the frozen puck into your pie crust. Preheat oven to 450. Bake on bottom rack for 20 minutes. Then lower heat to 350. Bake an additional 30 to 35 minutes.  (1 quart  filling  =   9" pie)

I used 9 cups of apples and 4-5 cups of water and halved everything else. I did use 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 raw sugar and let the apples simmer for over 30 minutes.
The flavor is great and this is a very easy recipe.

I probably  would have given this 5 stars if it was not for the fact that a standard dutch oven was not big enough for this recipe.  Next time I make it I am going to use a much bigger pot.  Also as myself and my family are not big fans of the "goop" in apple pie I think I may use less water and add  more apples.  I have not tried this yet so I do not know how well it will work.

It was pretty good,  but I found out the hard way that this recipe yields 5 pies. I had 15 cups of extra peeled and cut apples! I have certainly learned my lesson.

I made this with a bag of golden delicious apples I bought. The apples weren't that great to eat out of the bag, so I thought I 'd try this. I took some advice from some other reviewers. I added more cinnamon and nutmeg, and 6 cups of water to approximately 19 cups of apples. I tasted the finisher product and they are delicious! Next, I want to see how they come out after being frozen.

I followed the recipe exactly and put it in my large slow cooker on low for 8 hours to cook down.  I checked throughout  the day to see how soft the apples were and how much the juice cooked down.  I then filled 3 qt jars and let cool.  I then froze it.  1 jar was enough for a 9" pie.  I also used 1 jar with a cake mix, 1 stick of butter and 1 cup water, mixed a little and baked until done then drizzled a little frosting over it.  It made an excellent apple cake.

This is an absolutely perfect pie filling.  It reminded me of my Grandmother's apple pie, and a recipe that she took to her grave 25 years ago.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it was delicious.  I used all the water and really didn't find that it was too much.  I made 2 apple caramel cheesecakes with this filling, and they were so heavenly.  Try this recipe!!

I used 5 and a half cups of water.

I added an extra scoop of cinnamon.

I should of  used 1/3 less cornstarch as suggested. It's very thick while cooling. 

I also used 20 cups of apples. It smells great.

Added less water as per other reviewers. I ended up using 9 cups of water to 20 cups of apples and this still seemed like a little too much fluid. Also used 3 cups white sugar and 1.5 cups brown sugar and added more cinnamon and nutmeg. Used some of the filling in apple turnovers and they were a huge hit! Will make again.

Very good, definitely much better than canned, and a good way to use up extra apples. I personally would prefer a little more cinnamon and nutmeg, and would definitely up the amounts for next time. But I'm looking forward to having pies all winter!

No normal family (mine) has a pot large enough to make this in one batch!  Also, I have no idea how many apples make 18 cups sliced,
so it would be helpful to at least give an idea as to how many are required.  I had to drop everything and return to the store to purchase four more apples.

Good News!!!!  Great recipe and delicious pies and crumbles!!!!

I first made as directed and froze. Have not used in a pie yet, but had some that didn't fit in my containers. I put in fridge and it's wonderful over waffles! Liked this option so much that I made another batch just for that purpose today with 2/3 the amount of Apple slices. Delicious!

Great recipe. Followed other suggestions. Used half apple juice and half water.Cut water by half and it made the filling thick like I like. Cut the sugar by half (personal preference) and used half brown and half white. Used canned apple slices in water that I chopped as that is what I had on hand.

For my 1st attempt, I scaled the recipe down to 8 servings. It worked well however for my 2nd attempt, using the full recipe, I did cut back slightly on the sugar, cornstarch and water to suit my personal preferences. I had never seen a homemade apple pie filling recipe so thanks for this Terri, I didn't realize how easy it was! I froze mine in 20 oz portions to use in Allie's Awesome Easy Spice Cake - great cake but I don't like the additives and glucose-fructose in commercial fillings.

Used Sarah Jo's directions, made Apple Pie Filling in My Recipe Box. Stir together 2 T cornstarch, 1 t allspice, ½ t cinnamon, ½ C sugar*.  (For Dump Cake, reduce sugar to ¼ C.) Bring to boil 2 C water, then stir spices in and boil 1 minute. Add 5 apples peeled and diced with french fry cutter, and simmer with lid ajar for 6 - 8 minutes. Great for Dump Cake! Cool apples slightly then pour into baking dish that has been tempered for heat of apples. Press into apple layer a spice cake mix or yellow cake mix with favorite spices added. Top with 1½ C melted butter evenly drizzled, chopped pecans are optional. Baked perfectly in 30 minutes @ 350 since pie filling was hot. (I pressed cake mix into the filling before adding melted butter.) Serve with Ice cream or whipped cream.  Very sweet even with homemade pie filling!

Excellent! I made enough for just one pie (serving cut to 8) Decreased sugar slightly as per other reviewers and it was perfect. Might even try with the full sugar next time as it was very far from too sweet

I know that this recipe is designed for use in apple pies, but it is so much more than that!  I recently cooked for a community kitchen and I used this recipe as a topping for biscuits with some whipped cream.  It was not too sweet, not too runny and was a HUGE hit!  The only thing I did differently was to cook the apples for a little bit longer because they would not be put in a pie.  Wonderful.  I will definitely use this recipe in the future (maybe even for pie!).

I used  about 24 cups of braeburn apples, and decreased the water to 7 cups and the cornstarch to 3/4 cup, also added the zest of a whole lemon in with the juice, and a drop of clove extract.Smelled amazing and tasted even better!

Made this last night with half the water.  With the brown sugar substitution for half the sugar.  It would have made 4 pies, but the family stole some of it when it was cooling ^_^  (Tasted great over vanilla ice cream.)  I used Ginger gold apples.  And I will be adding this recipe to my life...worst thing was peeling 18 cups of apples. I had a bowl of lemon juice and water while cutting them all and just drained it before adding to the mix on the stove.  Will be reducing the recipe to half size though.

Perfect I love it, decreased the water to 5 cups so it wasn't running everywhere when I cut the pie. I was just wondering if you can replace the ground nutmeg with ginger or would that change the taste completely.

I've made something like this for years.  The kettle I use only holds from 12 to 14 cups of apples, I also only use about 2 cups of water because my apples always are very juicy.  I also cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and about 2 tbls of cornstarch, this really comes out nice and thick, when you cut your pie, it holds it's shape, doesn't run all over. I have Harlson apple trees, they make a great pie.

The recipe is great.  There's something wrong with the formula because I did 18 cups of apples and I only got 2 PIES!! And, they're not very full pies either!  The flavor is delicious though.  I took the apples and froze them in pie plates to keep the shape and make it easy for me later.

I have this cooking right now. I took a lot of reviews and kind of melded them together. I love cinnamon so I used 3tsp instead of 2. I used 2 tsp. nutmeg, 5 cups of water 3/4 cups of cornstarch. I used 2c.brown/2c. white sugars. I boiled all of this a little longer than called for so that it would cook down. Then I added it to the crock pot of apples (18 cups of apples) and will let that cook on low until the apples are softened but not mush. I will let you know how it turns out. I did taste the liquid before adding it to the apples and it was so good. Can't wait for the end result. Well I finally made a pie with this. It was the best apple pie I have EVER made or eaten.  I made the filling a year ago and when it cooled, I thought it was too runny but I put it in the freezer anyway. I put it into ziplocs in pie tins and vacuumed the air out. When it was time to make the pie I just layed the frozen filling in the pie crust and topped it with the top crust. After it was baked and cooled slightly I topped it with a mixture of 1/2 cup powdered sugar, 1T milk, 1/4t vanilla and 1T softened butter. I will never make apple pie any other way! BTW when I cut into the pie the filling was not runny, it was perfect!

This is a great recipe. The first time I made it as is, it was way to much water for the amount of apples.  Second time I made it I used 6 cps of water and 20 cps of apples.  I used just 4 cps o sugar and it is still plenty sweet enough.  I have not made a pie from the filling yet, but it is wonderful on pancakes and waffles.

I've got tons of apples from a private orchard and I just don't have the patience to pare and core 18 cups of them at once. So I did 1/3 of the recipe and the filling is lovely. 

I added some red food coloring in case I decide to make tarts or something festive and decorative. Very pretty.

I made a scaled down version of this recipe to use in ‘Allie’s Awesome Easy Spice Cake’ recipe as I didn’t have a can of apple pie filling on hand.  A great suggestion from Linda (LMT) – thank you.  After trying this recipe, I have no need to purchase apple pie filling anymore.  This had great flavor and was very simple to make.  It had more sauce than what I needed, so my guys reheated the sauce and poured it on their cake.  I can’t wait to try this again and make an apple pie with it.

My brother is tough to give me high ratings, but when I made this, he said it was the best dessert he had ever tasted!!! Great recipe - but I definitely scaled it down. I had set up enough ingredients for the whole thing until I realized it would make 40 servings.

Made this last year for the first time using Cortland apples.  Even after a year, the filling was fabulous and wasn't runny at all even after the pies had cooled.  Was a big hit with family and friends.  Making it again today!

DON'T use cornstarch if you're going to freeze this - it will separate and turn into a spongy glob. Choose tapioca starch or sweet rice flour instead. Otherwise it's a tasty pick me up in February!

I have made many apple pies in my time, and this is by far the best.  I ran out of cornstarch, so just added some tapioka to what cornstarch I had and the pies turned out perfectly.

Great!  Will definitely make this again the next time my apple trees over-produce, as they did this year.  As others did, I made some modifications.  I originally started out to do 18 cups, but I had a few apples left over so I ended up with about 22 cups.  I used 7 cups of water.  I ran out of cornstarch, so I substituted ClearGel, which seemed to work fine.  Next time I will cut down on the spices and use less water, maybe 5 cups for 22-24 cups of apple slices, since my homegrown apples are quite juicy.  (Spice tip--put in a little cardamom for a fresh taste.)

Excellent flavor. I cut the water to 4 1/2 cups and it was still too much although I used 20 cups of apples.  I was disappointed that I only got 3  one quart containers.  Next time will use larger containers as one quart looks a little skimpy for a pie!

Since I wanted to can instead of freeze this recipe, I left the apples in larger chunks and cooked them for just 2 minutes, put up on 5 one-quart jars and did a water-bath.  I have yet to open one and try it in a pie but it looks and smells wonderful.  I ended up with about 2 cups extra syrup but I wouldn't reduce liquid if I made this again because it was enough to cover the apples when I added them to the pot.

Great! I scaled this back to make 4 cups worth of apples when wanting some apple enchiladas one night. I used half brown and half demera sugar instead of white and I increased the cinnamon x3. Easy and beautiful filling!

I needed a can of apple pie filling last night but didn't want to go to the store.  I used this recipe and had it calculated for 4 servings.  It was delicious and also saved me money.  Homemade was much cheaper than store bought and also had more apples in it.  Good recipe!   I will definetely use this again.

If you are using apples that you picked yourself, you can reduce the water by 2 cups as the apples are juicier. I froze this apple pie filling and gave some to my sister and my mother. It was a big hit!

This is really good! I used Granny Smiths and ran out of cornstarch so they had to sit overnight in the fridge. But they turned out great. I used a bit of apple pie seasoning and run extract as well as brown sugar. I only put in about half the water called for and was careful not to overcook. I used my food sealer and put them all in the fridge for the holidays.

This was delicious.  I overcooked the apples so make sure you don't cook them too long.  I used an apple corer/slicer to cut up apples & it helped make it easier.

GRRRREAT! Except, I added 1/2 the sugar (since I used reddish apples instead of granny smith so they tended to be naturally sweeter), but added 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and a couple extra dashes of cinammon, nutmeg and ground ginger! AWESOME!

I used this for the Apple enchilada dessert from this site and it was just perfect!! Not to spicy and not to sweet.
Loved it.

It was good, I would like a little more spice. I used it in the Apple Enchilada Recipe posted on this site and just added a little extra cornstarch to make the consistency thick enough. Will use again

This was great, and very easy.  I made a small batch of it on Sunday morning to serve over crepes, and it took just a few minutes to whip up and impress my husband.  Thanks!
