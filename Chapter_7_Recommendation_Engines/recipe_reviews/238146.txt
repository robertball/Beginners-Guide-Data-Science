I only had regular soy milk so I added 1 1/2 tbs unsweetened cocoa powder and 2 Splenda packets. I used a frozen banana and a little bit less ice. Next time I make it I will make sure I have chocolate soy milk.

First chocolate smoothie I've ever had, and I enjoyed it.  I used dark chocolate soy milk and added a little more crushed ice to reach the consistency that I prefer.

I didn't have chocolate soy milk so I supplemented it with chocolate coconut milk. The combination of flavors created a tasty explosion, even my four year old and two year old enjoyed the smoothie.

I turned this into a protein shake by cutting the recipe in half and adding 1 scoop of chocolate protein powder (whey isolate) to make a delicious post-workout shake. It's also good as a meal substitute. I don't use soy milk though, either regular milk or chocolate milk diluted with regular milk or water (to keep the sugar down).
