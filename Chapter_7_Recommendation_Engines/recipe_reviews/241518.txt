My granddaughter and I stumbled across this recipe while looking for something to make for lunch. Since both of us are fans of the blue box mac & cheese we decided to give it a whirl and the results were spicy goodness. I didn't have blue cheese on hand so I used Mexican crumbling cheese. If your not a big fan of heat I would cut the hot sauce back to one tablespoon.

My kids loved it!  They have been asking for me to make it again!  I only gave it fours stars because I did not add the celery or blue cheese. I do not have either of those ingredients and my kids do not like celery cooked or blue cheese. Instead I added cheddar cheese. A great way to use leftover rotisserie chicken!

Tried doubling the recipe and making it in a 13x9, turned out well. Also shredded the chicken instead of cubing it

I didn't have Mac and cheese in the box, so I made my own Mac and cheese.  Didn't have  blue cheese either, so just topped with cheddar and some panko bread crumbs.   Both my hubby and my son inhaled it!! Thanks!

What a great way to take a plain box of mac and cheese and give it that wow factor.  Recipe was super simple with left over chicken . Hubby really liked this one.
