Made this the other night for myself, i only used one zucchini & instead of olive oil i used butter.. I mixed my bread crumbs with Kraft Parmesan cheese that comes in the green plastic container & basil.. I cooked on 450 for 30 min.. Came out perfect ! Oven needs to be higher and longer cooking time or they will be mushy like pervious user stated !

I have made these several times.  Learned really quickly that they need to be sliced very thin and at higher heat, 425-450.  Thicker ones were always soft.

Unfortunately, as often happens with baking rather than frying, the zucchini chips just didn't even come close to being crisp or even slightly crunchy.  At 15 minutes baking, they hadn't browned at all, so I left them a little longer hoping they would get a little color. They never really reached an appealing color, and although the taste was OK, they were simply mushy.  Sorry for the bad review, I know this is the first one, but we just didn't care for these.

These were wonderful! Mine turned out really crispy. I sliced them thin and baked at a higher temp. 450Â° and watched them closely so they wouldn't burn. I also mixed in some parmesan with the bread crumbs before coating the zucchini. I'll definitely make these again!

I used 1/2 cup of Panko Bread Crumbs (for crunch) & Italian Bread Crumbs (for flavor) mixed with Parmesan Cheese, Garlic Salt, and Rosemary.  I also pressed the sliced Zucchini in between paper towels to get rid of some of the moisture. Dip them in egg before breading.  Baked 25 minutes at 450 (turned after 15 minutes).

I listened to the reviews and cut thin then cooked at 450 for 30 minutes.  I used plain bread crumbs and seasoned salt. This was great.  My husband said save this recipe.

I would listen to the prior reviews on this one. You NEED to cut them thin, and you NEED to cook them on 450 for at least 30-40 min in order to get the crispy factor. Loved it!! Great way to use the extra zucchini form the garden.

What a fun way to use up zucchini!  After reading reviews, I used a chip slicer for very thin slices.  I baked at 350 & they were a bit soft.  I preferred 2nd batch baked at 450.  In the absence of italian breadcrumbs, I used plain bread crumbs with seasoned salt (I always liked the taste of culy fries.)  Overall, I am very happy with this recipe.

Turned out great! Tried it a second time and I added italian and sun dried tomato seasoning to the mixture and used egg instead of oil (also cooked a little longer, don't know the time just until brown on both sides). I enjoyed both ways, thank you for this recipe!

This was really bland for us and we couldn't get them very crispy. Fun to try, but not a keeper for our household.

We really liked these, even our 4 year old ate them. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that I just couldn't get the bread mix to stick to the zucchini, so the 2nd time I made them (they're in the oven now), I just oiled the slices and set them on the cookie sheet, then I sprinkled the bread mix on top of each. The last time, most of the coating came off as I tried to turn them anyway, so perhaps this way more coating will stick.

I tried all the suggestions but could not get these crispy without burning them.  Taste was blah, and I tried adding garlic powder, salt, and extra cheese.    Not worth the effort.

If you follow this recipe as is, these come out soggy.  I added some seasoned panko bread crumbs to the regular bread crumbs, and I baked them at 450F, not 350F.  I had to watch them closely so that they didn't burn.  By doing this, these chips were very good.

amazing. I mixed the bread crumbs Italian style, basil, oregano and Parmesan cheese in a bowl doubled the ingredients. 3 beaten eggs in separate bowl. Dipped them in egg on both sides first. Put them on coated baking sheet and baked at 350 for 15-20 minutes. The egg makes the crumbs stick on both sides. Will make these a lot.

I made a few modifications to this recipe:

I pulverized some herbed croutons in my Bullet Blender and used them for bread crumbs.
I also used shredded parmesan cheese rather than the finely grated powder like style. I loved the out come, the parmesan helped add to the crispness of the zucchini.

LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!! I did not use bread crumbs.  Coated the zucchini ( sliced thin per the other reviews) with olive oil and oregano,, placed on a crisper tray, sprinkled Romano and Parmesan cheese on top   and baked at 400 degrees for about 35 minutes.  They were crispy and flavorful, will be making more tomorrow!!!!

Great recipe, super easy! I took others' suggestion and baked at a higher temp for approx 30 mins. DEFINITELY slice them thinnnnn. I wonder if sweating them for 10ish min beforehand would help too...to alleviate the moisture? I'll have to try that next time. Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

I cut the zucchini into quarters instead of slices.  Throw it in a bowl and mix the oil and seasonings together before throwing it on a pan.  This just makes it easier to get everything mixed easily.  Super simple to make. Kids love this one.

I made these, but instead of layering them in a casserole dish, I lined a large cookie sheet with no-stick foil, and placed them on the tray to bake. They crisped up slightly during the baking. For the added crispy taste, I turned on the broiler for about 3 minutes and they were great! I made the first tray for my friend and her family and the second for ours. They were called "amazing!" by both.

I read the reviews before making this. Followed âLuv 2 Cookâ and they came out great. Turning up the oven to 450, thinly sliced, egg wash, Panko & Italian bread crumbs with fresh herbs made it really flavorful and crisp. Will definitely make again.

What did I do wrong? Bread crumbs turned into clumps by absorbing the oil while stirring.  Otherwise, love the recipe.  

Next time, will sprinkle bread crumbs onto zucchini slices after placing on a baking sheet.

Added paprika and garlic powder.

Used suggestion by Amy and used broil function during last 5 minutes to brown.

Had to use 2 baking sheets so tried adding chopped fresh tomatoes for one pan.  Maybe no noticeable difference.

The taste was good, but they didnât stay crispy. I added garlic salt to the mixture to add a little flavor. Iâd make it again.

I used milk to dredge them instead of oil, added black pepper and garlic powder to the breading and skipped the oregano. Baked them on a sheet pan with parchment paper after spraying the top lightly with Pam. Baked 15 minutes at 425 , turned them over then baked for another 15.

Sounds good on paper. There is some sort of disconnect here though. Prepared as directed the zuke chips are soggy and unpleasant plus this recipe needs at least a little salt. At the specified time and temp this just won't work. Convection would have helped but it really needs at least 400F with convection or even hotter without.  It seems like a good concept, just needs some testing to perfect the method.

Very good and easy recipe. The zucchini needs to be sliced very thin and they were better baked at 450. I also used panko breadcrumbs because thatâs what I had on hand and it gave them a little crunch which I liked.

I had a hard time getting the bread crumbs to stick well to the zucchini just using olive oil, so I dipped them in beaten egg first.  They also needed a touch of salt and pepper, but were otherwise delicious.  I look forward to making this again.

Ugh, forgot to read the reviews. 350 is just too low and they werenât crispy. But the flavor is fabulous. Will do at a higher temp next time around.

I made as directed would have really enjoyed these if I had it turn it up in the last few minutes to crisp them up a little more as suggestedsuggested in other reviews.  I tasted one and thought it was a little mushy in the center so I went ahead and turned it up and ended up burning them.  I will make these again but not turn them up at the end.

I followed the reviews and sliced the zucchini on a mandolin slicer on the thinnest setting. I used a paper towel to pat them dry before tossing in a bowl in olive oil. I used a combo of Italian bread crumbs and panko crumbs with a sprinkle of oregano and spread them on a silicone baking mat on a pan then sprinkled the top with Parmesan cheese and also shredded Parmesan/Romano cheese (we love cheese). Then the zucchini was baked at 425 degrees for 25 minutes. They were good, a bit time consuming to make, but tasty.

I adjusted for gluten free and dairy free needs by using gluten free bread crumbs and substituting nutritional yeast for the parmesan.  I salted with sea salt and baked.  YUM!!

Very good. Added a little extra parmasian cheese, not that it needed it, we just love cheese so I sprinkled a bit more.

We make this often when zucchini is plentiful  Turns out well.  I tried using both zucchini and yellow squash  and the yellow squash was a little softer but still good.

These were delicious!  After reading some of the reviews, I baked them at 450 for 20 minutes or so.  Nice and crispy.  We will definitely make these again!

It was amazing!! I didn't really pay much (any) attention to how much bread crumbs or Parmesan I put onto them, and I may have put too much, but I had some problems with getting them stuck onto the zucchini, not much of a problem though, they were still wonderful!! They came out soft, instead of chips, like I thought. Still amazing, and I don't even like zucchini that much!

I made it per the recipe directions and it turned out very good.  My husband told me three times during our meal that he REALLY liked zucchini prepared that way.  I didn't have Italian bread crumbs on hand so I used Panko bread crumbs and salt.  Delicious.  I could have added Italian seasoning but for my meal, it worked out great without.

I wasn't able to get these crisp, and I am sure it was my fault.  None of my family members liked them and they basically went to waste.  Sorry.
