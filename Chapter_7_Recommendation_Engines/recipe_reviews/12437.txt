This recipe was a flop!  I could not get it to fully cook and way too much butter.  It bubbled over and made a mess. :(

I tried a lot of this kind and they are usually pretty much the same although you change something here and there. I must say this one stands a little apart, because it turns out really true southern cooking as you expect it to be and to taste.

my family loved this pie!  I used store bought shells and had enough filling for two pies.

This recipe calls for way too much butter. It had leaked out of the pie onto the cookie sheet & saturated the crust as well. I would go with 1 stick or 1 1/2 at the most. Also, cut back a little on cooking time- got a little too brown on top.

4 stars because its way too much butter.   Almost ruins the pastry because it bakes out into the crust.  It is very dense and rich. delicious flavor.  I would reduce butter by at least half next time.
