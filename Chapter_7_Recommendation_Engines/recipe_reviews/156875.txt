This was super awesome.  It has an interesting, but very nice, flavor.  I'm transitioning to a vegetarian diet, and this is making it easier.  :-)  That being said, I had to make some changes, partly out of necessity and partly by design.  My garlic looked strange, so I had to use garlic powder.  I didn't measure...I just shook a ton in.  I didn't have 4 stalks of celery, so I substituted a bag of frozen celery, carrot, and onion blend, and then threw in a couple handfuls of onion that I already had chopped.  Because I added more vegetables, I added an additional teaspoon of curry powder (I wanted it spicy).  I also used brown rice and a mix of green and red lentils (it's habit).  Like others, I skipped the blending and left everything whole.  Without blending, the potato seems a bit unnecessary, so I might leave it out next time...and I'll definitely be making this again.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

This was a good soup, even better the next day! I used a sweet potato (instead of a baking potato) and added it to the pot before the other ingredients, cooked for about 7 minutes. I was unsure when to add the broth so I added some during blending and the rest afterward.

i made several alterations to this recipe: 
- added meat of approx. 6 chicken drumsticks
- added a teaspoon of chile oil to give it some kick
- took out potato and used brown rice instead of white
- i didn't use a blender, just put it all in a pot!

it was a great recipe.. healthy, and good to munch on during the weekday.

I changed the recipe a bit.  I used a sweet potato instead of a whit one, and water instead of broth.  I changed the lentils and rice to 1 cup each.  It wasn't until they were cooking that I paid attention and noticed cooked rice as an ingredient, I used uncooked.  In spite of all that, and the need for more water, this is a great tasting soup, more like a stew the way I ended up with it!  Thanks for the recipe!

I used this recipe as a base so that I could add whatever I had in my kitchen to it. I didn't use a blender to puree the vegies and used leftover cooked brown rice and lentils. I also added a sprouted bean trio mix. Great taste and great basic ingredients. Thanks for the recipe.

Honestly, I didn't realize that Curried Lentil soup and Lentil Curry soup were two different things, so I was a bit disappointed in the taste.  Followed other's suggestions not to puree, used carrots instead of broccoli, and cooked orzo instead of cooked rice, just because of what was in my pantry.  For me, needed more curry.  Will find another recipe to more my liking with the taste all around.

Except for sweet potato instead of plain and bacon grease instead of oil, I stuck closely to the ingredients, but I altered the cooking method a lot. I sauteed the onion, garlic and celery until soft, then added all the rest of the ingredients to the pot, brought to boil and let it simmer 45 minutes. Oh, and I used 3/4 C uncooked rice instead of the cooked and upped the liquid by 1.5 C to compensate. After the 45 minutes, it was a soft stew like texture with no spare liquid. I added some more water and blended it up. End result needed salt and I also added a little parsely to jazz it up, but pretty darn good overall.

Overall, we enjoyed it. I followed the recipe to a "T" (except for leaving the skin on the potato for extra nutrients) but the lentils were still only semi-cooked. I left the soup to simmer on low for an extra 35 minutes in addition to the 45 minutes. The consistency was wonderful, while not being too spicy. I will make this again, but maybe next time start cooking the lentils in the veggie broth while I am making the veggie puree...
