I served this on Mother's Day with cheesy vegetables and mashed potatoes. I did alter the cooking and marinating method. I didn't have a bag to marinade the leg in so I did it in a shallow glass baking dish and halfway through the night flipped it over. I used dry herbs instead of fresh. I followed the recipe but cooked it in the same pan (I washed it). I had a smaller leg but it still required the same amount of time to cook, maybe because my oven is an old one provided in my apartment or because the leg was very meaty. The wine flavours was prominent, but I didn't taste the orange juice at all. I used the concentrate which I watered down as I normally would when making it; next time I'll use the concentrate as is without diluting it. It wasn't as tender as I'm used to, but I blame that on my inexperience with cooking lamb and my dinky oven. Overall, the lamb turned out pretty well and I plan on trying this recipe out until I get it right. Thanks for submitting this, as it was a nice change to the usual rosemary, garlic and red wine version!

I recently used this recipe and it came out wonderful!  My variation was after marinating 24-hours I put the lamb with the marinate in my crock pot, added red potatoes & fresh brussel sprouts and cooked on high for 6-hours.  Came out wonderful!

I'd never cooked lamb before I tried this last Christmas. I served it with a rich rice risotto and cranberry green beans, and got rave reviews from the whole family, even my complaint-happy grandmother.

The only thing this was missing was some veggies I tossed with the leftover marinade and put in the roasting pan underneath the roast. I used carrots, onions, and potatoes, but any veggies you like will work. Seemed a waste to throw out the marinade, and the roasting pan seemed lonely with all that lamby goodness dripping into it.

Not bad at all, but the flavors were a little underwhelming. I'll probably try this again with OJ concentrate and more herbs, or maybe cook in a pan and baste with the marinade.

THIS IS MY GO-TO  FOR ALL OCCASIONS!  This is truly the best flavor, scent, taste, ease....oh my gosh, if you like lamb this will knock your socks off.  Enjoy the aroma!  It's almost as good as the lamb.

My granny made this without wine. Just about a half gallon of OJ in the roasting pan. And she put many whole garlic cloves in various deep, pocket slices in the leg.  Basting the leg every half hour or so. Absolutely Delish!

One reviewer posted it was bland so I increased oj to 3/4 and rosemary to 3 TBL.  I used my crockpot and combined my ingredients with a whisk... less than 15 minutes prep!.

Could not be easier and the lamb was so tender!!  Only had dried herbs, and only time to marinate for a couple of hours before roasting, but was so delicious!  Will make this one every time I have lamb.

The internal temp for Lamb is 170F, not 130-135 as stated.
I followed recipe, BUT after done cooking by the pound version, I turned oven off and left it continue cooking, much like a rib roast, an additional hour.  Absolutely perfect.
