I'm Logistics Officer with The Salvation Army's Intermediate Disaster Relief Team.  Red Lobster donated cases of small cooked lobster tails.  I found this recipe for the cooks and they used it with the lobster and fed about 200 people.  Everyone raved.  The cooks received a standing ovation.  Thanks!

Save yourself the hassle of cutting and chopping.  I found that shredded imitation crab meat mixed with Marzetti's Dill Vegie Dip is tastier and easier.  For those of you that don't have Marzetti's in your area, and that is unfortunate for you, just pick up any veggie dill dip and adjust to your liking if needed.  Put this on a big roll and call it a night.  Serve with chips and a soda and you'll think you went to the sub shop.

Made it with light mayo. Added diced red and yellow peppers and onion and garlic powders. I spooned it into raddichio lettuce leaves and sprinkles it with a bit of parprika and served it as an appitizer. I will make this again.

I have been looking forever for this recipe. I wanted a recipe that tasted like the mock crab salad that I buy from the local grocery store. The salad is delicious but is so expensive! When I found this I immediately made it and it was delicious! Thank you for this recipe, I can't wait to make it for a function. YUM!!

Wonderful tasty salad!  Very easy and a big hit with my husband.  I didn't put the carrot in it only becuase I didn't have one!  Still very good.

added 1 tablespoon lemon juice and a small amount of yellow mustard (or mustard of choice) to taste. This was a terrific recipe!

This was delicious! I used regular mayo and I did not add the celery. I also used green onions instead of white. Served on Hawaiian sweet rolls. Yum!

This was great!  I used an 8oz container of real crab (claw meat) and eyeballed the rest of the ingredients.  I also added a chopped hard boiled egg.  This served on a bun was yummy!

I took the advice of another reviewer and used green onion. While mixing it, I thought it needed more, sooo... I added 2 TBSP RICE VINEGAR - (heaping) 1/4 TSPN DRIED DILL WEED - (heaping) 1/4 TSPN GARLIC POWDER. Also, I cut way back on the mayo, using only about one big TBSP and just eyeballing quantities.

This is exactly the recipe that I was looking for that is the closest to the ones that they serve at the buffet deli's that I have eaten at (with out the carrots).  I made it for this New Year's party and everyone loved it!  As an option I served it with Crossiants so that people could eat it as a sandwich.  This will definately be made over and over in my house...Thanks for sharing it with us!!

This recipe is perfect for the kitchen in your dorm room (i.e. mini-fridge).  You don't have to cook anything, and the leftovers taste just as good as the first batch.  Beats ramen noodles handsdown!

I'm not a fan of carrots, so I omitted them.  This was a good recipe, but it is a little heavy on the celery in my opinion.

This is my absolute favorite crab salad recipe.  I have been making this for years except without the carrots. (I am not a fan of uncooked carrots.)  Every time I make this dish people rave about it.  This is a Christmas Eve tradition in our family with prime rib, clam chowder, salmon, and salad.  Wonderful recipe!

This is so good -- I admit I left out the carrot and added dill as another member had mentioned.  Then added some garlic salt  --- An all out Homerun.

A nice base recipe for crab salad.  To brighten it up I added some lemon juice and fresh dill for more flavour.

I made this recipe with canned real pink crabmeat. It came out quite tasty. I used mayo instead of miracle whip so I added cider vinegar and sugar to give it some tang. We served it on hamburger buns.

Very, easy to make especially if you own a nice chopper!  Added bell pepper, a dash of seasoned salt, and pepper to the mixture but omitted the carrots.  I only use Helman's Mayo which seems to give it a nice fresh taste.

Very good crab salad! I followed exactly as written except topping with a little black pepper before serving. I had it with some avocado, as was shown in the photo. A cool and refreshing salad to keep in mind for the warmer weather which hopefully will be here soon!!

Excellent recipe.  Instead of Miracle Whip I used 1/2 mayonnaise (Lite) & 1/2 Ranch dressing (Lite).  Great taste.  Also added Lemon Pepper, & Garlic Salt to taste.  Celery & Carrots a great touch. Everyone loved it.
Thanks

Made per the recipe except that I used green onions and added lemon juice.  This was okay but for my taste I may need to tinker = ) ... the first day, the Miracle Whip was too strong and the second day the salad was just watery:  tasted like no dressing at all. Also, I think I may prefer mayo for this salad.  But I appreciate the recipe; all of the other ingredients are spot on! I will make this again!

I followed the advice of others and added dill and garlic powder.  I went easy on the Miracle whip.  Next time I might use regular or light mayo.  Great on a sandwich or as a side salad!

The rating was for the recipe as is.  It's better if you add seasoned salt and dill weed.  Tried other folks' recommendation of the Marzetti dill dip and it was VERY good.  A little rich!!  It didn't need any extra seasoning that way.  I might try it with my own dill dip recipe which I can control better by using low fat mayo & lite sour cream or maybe sub some Greek yogurt for the sour cream.  With out all of this, imitation crab really doesn't have much taste on its own.  However it is made from Pollock fish which is supposed to be healthy.

I love crabmeat but I didn't think this recipe had all that much taste and the veggies overpowered the crabmeat. I won't use it again.

It was OK, but it needed something.  I put it on bread and found it was a lot better with salt and vinegar chips added.  (of all things!)  Don't think I will make again.

Served this at a company luncheon and it was THE HIT! I did not add all of the onion called for and used shredded bagged carrots. Excellent!

Was looking for something quick & easy to make on a summer night for dinner and this was perfect. Very tasty, carrots give it a nice flavor. I used Hellmans mayo and served on soft rolls one time and on pita bread another. With a fresh tomato from the garden was delicious. Thanks!
