Exceptional egg nog! I made it the day before as recommended by another reviewer. I added rum as I like that flavor. The recipe did not list the  nutmeg but it is in the video.  3/4 teaspoon in the mixture and a dash on each cup of cheer. Wonderful! Thanks for sharing!

DELISH!!!! I made it for 12 servings. I used 100 proof Southern Comfort.  It is best made a day or two in advance. allows all the flavors to come together. it was exceptional.  I made both cooked and uncooked. Both are great.  Uncooked is made the same except no stove time.

So much more flavorful than store bought eggnog. We found that it must be consumed right away though so that it does not separate.

Delicious, but I would double the nutmeg the recipe calls for.  You can barely taste the nutmeg.

I found my new eggnog recipe. I did add more liquor than the recipe called for, but the nutmeg hid the whiskey taste well.  I have made this recipe a few more times and Left out the beaten egg whites.  My family are not big on the foam

I forgot to add that we left out the alcohol since we're not used to that in our eggnog anyway, and used about 1/2 tsp. rum flavoring which was perfect.

I tried a number of different eggnog recipes a few years ago, and this was hands down our favorite. We adore it! Thank you so much.

I have never been fond of eggnog, nor yet made it from scratch, but I had watched CJ's video of the recipe on YouTube in the cooking video binge leading up to Thanksgiving, had time while I was waiting for the last thing to bake Wednesday night, and all the ingredients.
It is amazing. Fairly simple, rich, delicious, and a far nicer texture than the store bought stuff (ymmv, ofc). Splashed up with a generous measure of good whiskey, and some fresh nutmeg it is divine.

This is great.  Make sure you wait until it is properly chilled before sampling.  It is amazing the taste difference once chilled.  One real plus for me is that it makes just the right amount.

It was like flavored milk. Lacked consistency. Added commercial eggnog and was much better. Of course more booze.

Just made this and it smells VERY egg'y.  Definitely more like freshly fried eggwhites than I would have imagined.  I cooked the mix slowly over medium heat constantly swirling slowly with a spatula until the temp hit precisely 172°F. Pulled off, added nutmeg and booze, and chilled sitting in a bowl of ice water until cool.

This is the best eggnog I've ever had. It's not overly sweet, as some eggnogs tend to be, and the flavor is spot on--not too eggy or boozy. I really appreciate that Chef John uses both parts on the egg in the recipe too. Adding the meringue to the eggnog makes it so light and wonderful, that there's just not enough good things I can say about this recipe! Thank you so much Chef John for making an eggnog recipe that makes a non-eggnog-lover (such as myself) enjoy eggnog again!

I was concerned about the raw eggs in this recipe so I substituted pasteurized eggs. Turned out just fine. This is an especially important tip if you have children or elderly people or anyone with decreased immune function drinking your eggnog.

This is a very good recipe. The nutmeg is missing from the ingredient list however. The video says it is 3/4 t plus more for garnish
