These bars are great! Super moist, chewy, and delicious. I used plain Crisco, instead of butter flavor, but didn't notice anything missing as far as flavor goes.  I also used sliced almonds instead of pecans.  I used half vanilla extract, and half almond, which balanced out the sliced almonds. Would recommend highly!

i didn't care for these.  these were extremely cakey and bland.  kinda like a pound cake with chocolate chips in it.  thanks anyway but i'll stick with toll house!
