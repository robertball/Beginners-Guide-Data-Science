The second time I made this, I set the zucchini aside to cool for about 15 minutes before putting it in the blender. The eggs blended better. Even my husband (who doesn't care for zucchini in any form) liked it.

Very tasty!  Baking time was almost 90 minutes.  Green color was actually very pretty.
