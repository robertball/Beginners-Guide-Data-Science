This cake deserves more than 5 stars. This cake is the "BOMB". I added spices to my cake, like cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and allspice just because I alway's doctor up anything I make with pumpkin. I took it to a christmas party and it was a hit, everyone wanted the recipe by the end of the night. I brought the new French Vanilla cool whip to my friend's house who had the party and they all loved that too. They both went great toghether. OH and one last thing, I strongly recommend doubling the filling amount or the cake will be thin especially in a 9X13 pan.

I just returned from a Pumpkin Fest at church in which I entered this recipe into the recipe contest and won first place! I made it in a springform pan and added 10 extra minutes to the cook time. I also found adding the nuts to the crumb mixture made them set very well into the cake! I saved one piece for myself and now look forward to enjoying it with a cold glass of milk on this beautiful fall evening!

This is a great cake.  It is more like a cake/pie....the perfect combination!  The recipe does not quite fill a 9x13 pan so I used a round spring form pan.  Had to cook it a bit longer because it was thicker.  It looked really nice out of the pan because you could see the layers.

My mother gave me a similar recipe 25 years ago and I have been making it for Thanksgiving every year since then.

Our filling recipe varies slightly in ingredients. Mine has 1 15 oz can pumpkin, 3/4 cup sugar, 1 tsp ground cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. ground ginger, 1/4 tsp. ground cloves, 2 eggs, 1 cup evaporated milk. This makes it more like true pumpkin pie in the middle.

Also, when putting the first layer in the pan, pat the bottom slightly higher on the sides to help keep the pumpkin filling in place.

I have made this recipe many, many times already and it's only been a month since I saw it.  My family and friends have asked me to bring it every time we get together and at least 2 people will ask me for the recipe every time I bring it some where.  People who don't like pumpkin pie tell me that they love this recipe.  I will tell you that I substitute the 1 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon for 1/4 tsp. each of ginger, allspice, nutmeg, cloves, and cinnamon.  I also cut down the butter and the white sugar.  I only use 2/3 of a stick of butter for the bottom crust and use the rest for the top instead of using a whole stick for the bottom and almost a half of a stick for the top.  I also cut the sugar down to a little under the 1/2 mark.

The longer they sat, the better they tasted. Will definitely make again. I did use an 8x8 pan because the recipe wasn't large enough to fill a 9x13. The layers looked great when they were cut into bars. Thanks!!

Yummy! Although the topping was a bit too sweet for me. I think that i will use half of the sugar in the topping.Oh, and definitely use the 9x13 pan. I used the 8x8 pan and had to bake for twice as long! I know it doesn't seem to be able to fill the pan, but it expands a lot as it cooks.

Very delicious.  My son doesn't like pie crust so I'm always looking for ways to use pumpkin.  FYI- If you're using a glass 9 x 13, make sure to keep a close eye on it.  My crust started to burn.  Next time will cook at 325.  My fault not yours Debbie, great recipe!!!

Easy recipe to make.  I used butter pecan cake mix and it went very nicely with the pumpkin.  But the bottom cake crust and top cake crumble went soggy/mushy by the next day for when I wanted to serve it.

I made dinner for about a dozen people and served this for dessert, and it was a huge hit!  My roommate borrowed the recipe and made it again just a week later.  I accidentally omitted the 1/4 cup of brown sugar and it turned out fine - it was sweet enough that I don't think I will put it in next time I make the dessert.

This is a HUGE hit with my family and at parties! My children ask me to make this often. My husband actually came downstairs from his office one day...pulled out the yellow cake mix and the can of pumpkin set them on the counter and walked back upstairs...that was his way of subtley asking for me to make pumpkin crumb cake!

I made this, as a copy of something I had at a restaurant, and it was even better. I used spice cake mix, as it is what I had on hand, and it was spicy and had a great pumpkin taste. I used pumpkin pie spice, instead of cinnamon, and it was perfect. Will make again for company, but it was too many servings for 2 people at home.

This is very delish! I made the mistake of following anothers idea of baking it in a springform pan(mine is 9")-it took almost DOUBLE the baking time for the middle to get done &, of course, the bottom & outside crust were burnt. Fortunately, I was just making this for us so we just cut the burnt part off. Proabably would've worked much better in a 10" springform. It's really very good! Next time I'll make it in the 13x9 pan, as instructed. Thanks!!

Oh wow!  This is amazing!  Made as is no changes except for the fact that I used an 8x 11 inch dish.  I took a tiny bit longer than 45 minutes.  This is pure heaven!!!!!!!

I must say- I like the Pumpkin Crunch Cake a lot better. But it's still really good. 
I lost my version of the Pumpkin Crunch Cake and found this while I was looking for it. I though I would try it for a change. It was good, but not as good as the Pumpkin Crunch Cake- in my oppion. But I LOVE pumpkin and pumpkin pie and one of the reasons I like the other is that you can taste more of a pumpkin flavor. This tastes more like sweet crust with a touch of pumpkin- like I said- not bad, just not what I was looking for. My kids loved it though! My be a bit too sugury-sweet for my taste.

eh-alright, this tastes just fine, but nothing I would venture to make again.  Doesnt do anything for me, nor does it have any flavor that makes it stand out above any other pumpkin recipe. Just good.

Wowsa!  Really good after I cut back the sugar by 1/2 cup and it was still pretty sweet!   I added a dash of ground cloves and nutmeg; I had an odd sized pyrex that was 8.5 x 11.5 but it worked out great!   The crust layer was a little hard to work with.   It wasn't so much thick as it was sticky and hard to spread.    This was great about an hour after it came out but wasn't as great the next day after it spent the night in the refridgerator (because of pumpkin filling).  The moisture made it a bit too soft and was no longer crunchy/crumbly on top.   I would make this again! :)

I'm rating based on some adjustment advice I took from other reviews.  I cut the butter substantially - used only one stick for the whole recipe and it was more than sufficient.  I added about 2/3 of the stick to the base cake and the rest to the topping.  Although it seems there's not enough dough for the base, there is plenty - just get your clean hands into it, and spread!  I added lots more spice to the filling, including pumpkin pie spice, and nutmeg, and cut the sugar slightly.  I used about 1/2 of the sugar in the recipe for the topping and I stirred the chopped nuts into the topping before I crumbled it on the pumpkin, might as well make that one step instead of two.  I saw where several people said this was more of a bar.. mine rose just fine & was a perfect CAKE, as written.  This was a huge hit at work tonight, with whipped cream and good coffee.  I'll definitely make it again, with the changes as noted.. and I might add some nuts to the crust level too - I like it crunchy!

This recipe was delicous!! My family loved it even my pickiest eater. The pumpkin filling was like a pumpkin pie sandwiched between a slightly salty/buttery crust. YUMMY! I left out the nuts but added a little drizzle of maple syrup on the top. Perfect recipe and so easy to make!!!!

This is a very tasty cake and my husband really enjoyed it.  However, next time I will decrease the amount of sugar in the topping and decrease the butter in the crust (my own personal taste).  I used the spring-form pan as suggested and it was picture perfect.

This was great!! I ate it warm, but it fell apart easily...as it cooled, it stayed togetehr better. And as other suggested, I used a 8x8 pan - perfect! Very yummy but be prepared - it's VERY VERY RICH!....great pumpkin taste, and all the other flavors came through nicely (you could taste the brown suger - loved that). I used chopped walnuts - which were a perfect compliment. ALthough nuts are 
"optional" - per the recipe - I would NOT leave them out of this recipe...it gives it some  nice crunch. The topping on this too was super! I used a plain yellow cake mix..and it was perfect..didnt overshadow the other flavors in this dish.

Love this!  I skipped the crumb topping due to reports of sogginess, so I added a cream cheese glaze instead.  Pumpkin pie like but without the hassle of the crust

This was excellent but it was more like a pumpkin bar than a cake. The one little change I did make was to mix in chopped pecans for the topping instead of just sprinkling them on top. When I first tried a small piece, the topping seemed to be very sugary, crunchy and was so hard it cracked and came off in chunks as I cut it. I thought I had messed up somewhere along the line. After it sat, refrigerated for several hours, the top had softened up and was no longer sugary! I made two for my son and my daughter to take to their work parties, the night before, and it was loved by all. Thanks so much!

Good flavor and house smelled GREAT! Baked in 10" springform pan...Added about 1tsp of pumpkin spice, I think it would have been bland without it...baked 30 mins at 350 then 20 more mins at 325.  Looked so pretty when I pulled the sides off. Easy too...Thanks for sharing!

5 stars is an understatement!! The BOMB is an understatement! Even a pumpkin hater would love this! I doubled the recipe so that it would fit into a 10X13 pan. The outside edges were perfectly cooked (left it in for 5 mins longer). The inside was cooked but not as tender and cake like as the outside pieces. Inside had more of a pie type texture. Don't get me wrong it was ALL GOOD!!!. Taking it to church for an Octoberfest....very seasonally appropriate! THANKS FOR THE GREAT RECIPE....will make again and again!

This was a really good dessert.  I refrigerated mine after cooling (for me pumpkin pie is always better cold).  I can see why people substitute this for their pumpkin pie, very easy and quick to make and tastes much better than the regular pie.  I forgot to get whipped topping at the store, but I will definitely serve this with it next time.

This is a good recipe for pumpkin lovers and a nice change from pumpkin pie. I personally liked it best the first day, soon after it came out of the oven. I feel it was best either warm or at room temperature and not as good when refrigerated. This was fairly simple to make and my favorite parts were both the bottom crust and the topping.

We made this and loved it, it was even better after refrigerating it overnight!  The only thing is my topping didn't quite turn out.  I will make sure the butter is very COLD and cut it in with a pastry blender next time.  But even without the topping, this was a great treat!

Perfect! The crust I did exactly as the recipe states, but for the filling I only had 30oz cans of the pumpkin pie filling (not the pure pumpkin). I added the three eggs to this and omitted the sugars and spices.  This filled the 9x13 perfectly, it was nice and thick and set up perfectly.  Absolutely no problems with it being too thin like other users noted. I was able to cut them into small bars for my daughter's class Thanksgiving treat and they were a huge hit.  Thank you!  Wonderful, easy fall dessert :)

I brought this to a party and it was a huge hit.  I personally thought the cake mix made it much too sweet and I will probably not make this again.  I still gave it 5 starts because everyone had a least two servings and several people had three.

I like this recipe for pumpkin cake the best. I like the cake mix pressed into the bottom and then part of it on top rather than others that they just put the cake mix on top. The only thing I do differently is I actually make pumpkin pie filling and use it rather than this pumpkin mixture. Love this, it's been a family favorite for years and years.

This was a nice alternative to pumpkin pie.  The crust was definitely thick enough, so I would recommend using a 9x13 pan as the recipe calls for.  I think it would be good with the filling doubled, though it was fine as is.  Definitely add some whipped cream to the top!

Delicious.  I baked it in a springform pan, giving it the extra 10-15 min. the others recommended, and chilled it.  I served it at Christmas instead of pumpkin pie and everyone raved.  I had several desserts but everyone talked about this one.  Even though I love sweets, it was even a bit too sweet for me so I will probably cut back next time, but better too sweet than not sweet enough in my book!

This recipe is fantastic!  My husband and I are not especially fond of pumpkin - at least not in the pie form, but I decided to try this recipe.  I made it for our deer hunting crew last weekend.  We all loved it.  I didn't have a yellow cake mix so I substituted a butter pecan cake mix as I use them often and always have them on hand, and it was great - I would definately do it that way again.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this for guests this weekend and everyone loved it.  A couple changes - I added a 14 tsp of nutmeg and 14 tsp of ground cloves to give it more of a pumpkin pie flavor and halved the sugar in the topping - it still turned out very sweet.
Has anyone tried this with a chocolate cake mix?  My friend bakes chocolate pumpkin bread at Christmas time and the flavor is awesome.

I made this the day before thanksgiving and it held up great. Kept it in the fridge to keep its form. I read different reviews and decided to change some things up. I recommend a spring pan, place wax paper on the bottom for easy clean up. The spring pan adds great thickness for this dish. I used a 20 oz can of pumpkin and added more sugar for it. I also added a lot of cinnamon and all spice seasonings. For the crust I like to mix the pecans in the batter so it can mesh together. My family said it was a 5star professional baked dish. I tried to upload a picture of the final display but could not access the upload.

it came out prettier than usal crumb cakes, what with the bright orange stripe in the middle and all; and it's been appreciated, it's not overtly sweet and it's quite a good alternative to the usual pie; And with the cake mix, it was ready in minutes:-)

I was looking for something quick, easy, and seasonal with Thanksgiving coming up. I tried it out on my Dad and his wife.  They both loved it. It reminded us of apple crisp.  I served it with vanilla icecream.

Easy to make. I doubled the filling  and added some pumpkin spice. Also sprinkled a little cinnamon in the crumb topping while I was mixing it. Baked for 60 minutes until toothpick came out clean. More flavor on day 2. Will make day before serving next time.

I have been making a dessert similar to the "Upside Down Pumpkin Cake" for several years, and I figured that I would try a different version to compare.  I was quite disappointed with this recipe.  The bottom crust has little flavour and the pumpkin filling tastes very bland and "eggy"-- almost like a weird custard.  The best part is the topping, in my opinion, and there isn't very much of it on this recipe.  Other versions use the entire cake mix for the top, which I prefer.  As for the filling, other recipes use evaporated milk and twice the pumpkin which improves the taste a lot.  I won't make this version again.

Easy and delicious!  I brought this to the family Thanksgiving dinner instead of pumpkin pie and got nothing but raves.  I followed previous suggestions to double the crumble topping.  It really is a good substitute for (if not improvement on) the old, standard Pumpkin Pie.  I will absolutely make this again!

This was awesome!  It was cheap and SO easy and made a large dessert!  The only thing I would change is I would not add so much (or any) sugar in the topping.  It was SUPER sweet ontop of an already sweet dessert.  I added alot more nuts on top.  Great recipe!

I made this for a ladies function at church and was asked several times for the recipe. Needless to say there wasn't any leftovers. :) If I was to comment on the prep; the pan should be smaller for the ingredients listed, maybe 9x9. Add more pumpkin to the filling to make the finished product thick enough. It is too sweet as listed so I would decrease the amount of sugar next time. It comes out of the oven looking as good as it tastes. :)

Very good! Can bring to family holidays as crumb cake. Use 8x8 pan instead. That is the only change I made.

This is so delicious.  It is easy to make and is the best of both worlds -pumpkin pie-ish filling with a cake bottom.  I used pecans on top.  I will make this again for sure.

I WAS SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS RECIPE ... AND ... it was only OK.  WAY too sugary, and not enough pumpkin.  Like another poster said, it's half cake & half pie.  After making the dessert, we all said we'd rather have just the pie.  It was a nice try, but didn't satisfy the pumpkin craving.

WOW!  The best dessert I have had in a long time!  This is what I will make every time I want pumpkin pie but don't want the hassle.  I made a few changes based on what I had on hand but would not make it any other way.  1. I used a spice cake mix.  2.  I doubled the filling and used the 9x13 pan.  A must if you want a more pumpkin pie type dessert rather than a bar cookie.  3.  I had half a can of sweetened condensed milk in the fridge so I used it to replace the brown sugar.  4. I also baked about an hour because of the doubled filling.  Trying it warm and YUM!

During the prep process, I could not get the crumble to crumble so I added a little flour and then sugar.  Still would not crumble.  So I put it in the freezer for 5-6 minutes and then it crumbled.  So in saying that, definitely use really cold butter for this part.  The flavour is wonderful.  You better have a glass of cold milk to drink with it because it was very very rich.  I took one star off because of the crumble complication.

Oh baby!  This was really tasty!  The whole family raved.  I cut back on the sugar and ended up MAKING MY OWN YELLOW CAKE MIX as I didn't have one.  That was easy to do so I'll do that again. I also added spices to the pumpkin as it seemed to call for it.  I made it in a spring form pan and am glad I did.  It was BEAUTIFUL but you do have to cook it about 10 min more.  I let it cool completely before taking off the spring-form.  You won't be disappointed.

I used this recipe and made the cake for a Christmas party yesterday and people couldn't stop asking me for the recipe! Delicious yet easy to make. Upon the suggestion of the other reviewers, I did double the pumpkin filling for a fuller, layer-ific cake.

I was loved by all my family for Thanksgiving!   Will definatly make again!  I may even add coconut to the pimpkin mix next time!!!    YUMMY

EVERYONE LOVED THIS!!  Good dessert to bring when there is already pumpkin pie at the table.  There were no leftovers of this.  One modification; I used pumpkin spice instead of cinnamon.  I used actual baking pumpkins for the filling and I also used a round spring form pan.  Turned out beautiful and no leftovers.  Thanks!

I've had this before a couple of different ways and I LOVE it.  I strongly recommend these modifications to this recipe: -use softened, not melted, butter plus 1 Tbsp of water for the base cake -add 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to pumpkin mixture -double the amount of pumpkin, and use fresh if you have it (equals 3 cups or so) -cut the white sugar back by 1/4 cup in the pumpkin mix, and down to 1/3 c. in the topping. -substitute turbinado (or demererra) sugar in the topping - it gives it a fabulous slight crunch  But whatever you do - DO make this - it is awesome!

This was just ok. I followed the recipe as written, but made one exception. I reduced the sugar in the crumb topping like others suggested, but it was still a little too sweet. Also the crumb topping gets soggy after sitting for a while. I think a more traditional crumb topping may taste better.

This cake was way to rich for my families tastes.  Even a little slice made us kind of sick in the stomach.  It had a good flavor other than that but I won't be making it again...

Delicious!!! I did make some adjustments such as adding a thicker layer for the bottom and doubled the filling. It was amazing and I will definitely make it again!

Delish! We enjoyed this more than pumpkin pie! I followed the recipe as is with the exception of baking it in a 9 inch spring  form pan. I think it fills the pan perfectly and makes for a thicker layer of the pumpkin filling. Baked as directed but cooked it an additional 15 minutes at 325 since I went with the springform pan. Presentation was good,taste was yummy and everyone from young to old loved it. I'll be making this next year rather than our traditional pumpkin pie. It does taste great with whipped topping!

Thank you for such a yum recipe! The only changes I made were to add cinnamon, nutmeg & allspice (just a pinch) & a teaspoon of vanilla to the pumpkin mixture and reduce the sugar since the cake mix is always already super sweet. Hubby pronounced this as one of the best pumpkin desserts i've prepared so far.

I only started baking 3 months ago and this was the first recipe I tried. Since then, I've made it 2 or 3 more times and it's been a great success each time--super easy and super delicious. Every time I make it, the crumb on top is lighter & crisper. The only alterations I've attempted are to add a 1/4 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice along with the cinnamon and then lightly sprinkle the crumbing with cinnamon sugar just before it goes to the oven. I think these two alterations will permanently be added to the recipe in our household. Oh, and I've decided pecan pieces or halves are much better than walnuts, but I'm a Texan so I may be unfairly partial to pecans.

Wow!  This cake is wonderful!  It was easy to make, looks pretty and taste fabulous!  I will be having to run a few extra miles to work off the calories I will be consuming in this cake!  I can't wait to grab a cold glass of milk and enjoy another piece!  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

Awesome pumpkin dessert! I made it for a family gathering and everyone loved it. It has a nice holiday goodness flavor. I added some extra spices to the pumpkin mixture, including nutmeg and cloves which made it very enjoyable! This will be a classic fall/winter dessert for us.

I made this today and it was absolutely wonderful! I did not use the 9x13 but a square pan instead..I wonder if you need to actually roll the crust part out to fit the 9x13? Either way it was delicious and I will definitely make this again. I did put walnuts on the top too! Thank you for the recipe!

I used white cake mix and a 9*13 glass cake pan, it was done perfectly in about 40 minutes.  My husband and kids both love this dessert and are already asking me to make it for Thanksgiving which is fine by me, it's easier than pumpkin pie =)

I made this recipe according to my taste and it turned out great.  First, I decreased the amount of sugar in the crumb mixture by 1/2 cup, and it still turned out sweet,without being over sweet.  I heated the pumpkin mix on low, and stirred in the sugars, salt and used pumpkin pie spice rather than cinnamon and let the flavours blend.  I let the mixture cool, before adding the eggs.  I made the cake in a springform pan, which allowed for easier serving and presentation.  I made the cake the day before, as others had said it tasted better overnight.  Before serving, I re-heated the cake in the over, which allowed the crumb topping to crisp up.  It tasted great and was a big hit at dinner.  Be sure to use a drip pan if using a springform pan, just in case of any leaks.

Used 8 x 11 glass baking dish.  Used white cake mix.  Used 1 Tbsp. Watkins Pumpkin Pie Spice AND a generous dash of Watkins cinnamon.  To get a uniformly lightly browned topping I had to bake about 50 minutes.  Now for the taste-test verdict: holy toothache, Batman!  This cake is seriously sweet.  And I have a sweet tooth famous in these parts--I love cakes and candy, the sweeter the better.  The 'crust' and the 'topping' were both too sugary for my liking.  I did appreciate the pumpkin pie-like filling though, it wasn't overly sweet and had just enough spice ...yummy.  I sampled this straight from the oven and I will give it another taste today now that it's been in the refrigerator, maybe that is why I thought it too sweet?  I don't know if I'd try *this* recipe again...but the idea is cool so I will try another variation.  My very picky, very anti-sweets husband said it was an amazing dessert...go figure!

My kids loved this cake.  They are great critics when it comes to pumpkin.  I was laughing b/c some of my good friends always tell me that I like to make things that are in layers... well, maybe they are right but I can't wait to try this one on them.  I did follow the recipe and the only changes I made was to add a little bit of nutmeg and a little ground cloves to the the pumpkin mix and chopped pecans for the crumb topping.  Delicious!

I made this tonight with many variations. I had a huuuge craving for pumpkin & hardly any ingredients for anything I wanted to make so I made adjustments & settled on this. First, I didn't have a yellow cake mix so I search for cake mixes from scratch on this site & found one for spice cake that I used and also varied by leavin gout the allspice for lack thereof and replacing it with apple pie spice. I left out the nuts, and also replaced the cinnamon with apple pie spice 7 a bit of ground cloves since I had run out of cinnamon while preparing the spice cake mix. Then, when it came time to make the crumb topping I added graham cracker crumbs and around 1/3 cup oats and a tablespoon or so more butter to keep it crumbly. I baked it in a bundt pan so of course, had to adjust the time, but I must say it was soooo worth it! the only thing that could make it better is perhaps a layer of cream cheese frosting or cool whip and a cup of coffee! delicious!

Love this!  Followed the recipe as written, except added a 1/2 tsp of ginger and 1/4 tsp of cloves to the pumpkin filling.  Baked in a 9 inch springfrom pan.  It definitely needed extra time to bake in that pan, about 15-20 minutes for me.  Came out of the pan beautifully and makes for a not only a special, tasty dessert, but also a great presentation.  Thank you!

Very good and very easy to make.  Other than making in a slightly smaller cake pan than the called for 13x9, I made it as written.  Everyone at work loved it and asked for the recipe (to make as a substitute to pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving.)  This was extremely moist and had a very nice pumpkin flavor.  The topping was perfect too.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this for my friends one evening. They loved it!! Everyone loved the mix of pumpkin with some crunch on top. I added a pinch of nutmeg to the pumpkin mixture. As others said, I put it ina smaller pan. I'm making it again ASAP for another holiday get together!!! Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe was a complete hit with my family! I made it for my son's first birtday and he gobbled it up!! I will be making this again and again during the holiday season!!! I made this with a 8x8 pan since I didn't have a 9x13. Regardless, I thought it was a perfect pan to bake this in. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This cake was good, but not great.  I made it and thought it wasn't bad but probably won't make it again, which is why I gave it three stars.  I much prefer regular pumpkin pie or even pumpkin bread or pumpkin cookies over this half cake/half pie recipe.  I baked this for a girls night and the consensus was that it "wasn't bad," but the other desserts I made received rave reviews - they were gone while there was a lot of pumpkin crumb cake left.  I did make it in a springform pan (baked it 10-15 minutes longer) and am glad I did since otherwise the pumpkin layer would have been too thin.  I followed the recipe exactly for everything else.

Made this with the ‘help’ of my 4-year-old grandson. Took to a bake sale and they were gone. Making them again tonight. Only thing I’m changing is to add a bit more butter in the crumb topping. It was a little powdery. Extra butter should fix that. They are moist and delicious!

I went with a reviewers suggestion of doubling the filling. Received a THUMBS DOWN on that choice. 
Other than that this is perfect for your family pumpkin competition as many will do the pie and the pumpkin roll this is unique bite. 
I did add the traditional spices to pumpkin to jazz it up.

I thought it was way too sweet and the pumpkin filling was too thin. not a keeper! Way too much work for the result.

Made this recipe EXACTLY as laid out and described.  Made NO changes.  Absolute PERFECTION.  Family LOVED.  If you choose to make, DO NOT change a thing.  Do not add, subtract or substitute.  You WILL NOT regret it.  Pinky swear!! :)

I used a Springform pan as another reviewer suggested and it came out beautifully. It will be a new dessert added this Thanksgiving Holiday!

I won't make this again.  I changed the spices and used spices called for in original pumpkin pie, the pp spice all in one in jar contains allspice and nutmeg which is not in pumpkin pie.  My recipe for pumpkin dump cake using white cake mix instead of yellow is much better!

We didn’t care for this.   The pumpkin taste didn’t come through...more like apple with all the spices.  Did take one viewers suggestion to add a combo of spices vs just the cinnamon.   It didn’t rise much in the 9x13 pan.   Maybe the newly bought cake mix was ‘stale’.

I really had to punt on this one. First of all, there are no cake mixes that I have seen here in Uruguay where I live - nor are there pumpkins! I have devised my own go-to cake recipe that I used in place of the mix, and I used a large sweet potato (cooked in the microwave) instead of the pumpkin. With cinnamon and nutmeg, it tasted just like pumpkin.  We loved it!

Topping:
I doubled the pecans, so I used a cup of pecans and instead of white sugar in the topping, I used brown sugar.  I also mixed the pecans in with the other topping ingredients instead of putting them separately on the top.

My sister found this and gave me the recipe. I make it any time of the year! I will put it in an 8x8 or 9x9 if I want it a little thicker... it's sometimes hard to make the bottom crust to fill a whole 9x13 pan, just make sure it's not super thick. I add typical pumpkin pie spices to the filling (clove, allspice, nutmeg) and it tastes wonderful. Tip on the crumble - if you're like me and you don't keep butter outside of the fridge, don't use melted butter for the crumble. It really needs to just be softened to make the right "crumble" consistency.

This is not a cake. It was more Crom than anything. The topping was too sweet and did not crumble properly according to the instructions. It was too powdery.  I would not try this recipe again.

This is way too sweet. Everyone that tried it said it was good but just too sweet. If I make it again I would definitely omit the white sugar completely and increase the spices by using a pumpkin pie spice mix.  I also used a springform pan as did another user with good results.

The 9x13 pan was too big for this recipe. Next time I will use a smaller pan or increase the ingredient portions. It came out a little dry and not enough pumpkin. I think it will be really good next time and might even look more like the picture if it's made in a springform pan. It just didn't get many good reviews from the family.

Fantastic recipe! Easy to make "as is" or adapted to personal taste. To fill the whole pan I doubled the pumpkin filling & crumb topping. I also spiced up the pumpkin filling like I would a pumpkin pie, and used brown instead if white sugar in the crumb topping. Served cold w/ vanilla ice cream had my very picky Latino in-laws going for seconds!

Yum! I followed everyone else's advice, and used an 8x8 pan. I also added nutmeg in the pumpkin mix (1 tsp), and sprinkled cinnamon and nutmeg on top of the crumble before baking. I think next time, I will do half white sugar/half brown sugar for the crumble. Delicious!!!

I made orig recipe as written, but topping was WAY dry, not near enough butter to make a nice crumbly topping from that much dry ingredient. Someone else suggested cream cheese, which i used about 3 or 4T in addition to the 3T butter. Baked 350 for 50mins in a 9x13 nonstick pan coated in veg spray. Topping was still a little dry even w like 1/2c butter+crm cheese mixed in.

The end result was good, not great. very sweet, like triple pumpkin pie sweet, CANDY sweet. Too rich and more yellow cake flavor than pumpkin. This was a lot of cinnamon, which for me was not enough layers of spice flavors, sort of 1 dimensional, and very little pumpkin flavor. The pumpin was kind of an after taste on your palette, but mostly the white sugar and yellow cake batter overwhelms. 

Next time will try some modifications, a little less sugar in the whole recipe (1/3c ea), and definately double the filling to make in a 9x13 pan. I may even just try Libby's pre-spiced pumpkin pie can mix (brown label 30oz can) because their spice IMO is just right. I might also try a white cake mix and add a touch of vanilla. And I think the topping needs some TLC, needs brown sugar (may try half each brown and white, enough to equal 1/3c total sugar) and a pinch of spices.
--UPDATED--
the next time i made this, used white cake mix and the other modifications i mentioned above. i also used the Lg libby prespiced pumpkin. MUCH better with these changes! i'll upgrade my rating to 4 stars with my modifications.

I have been making this for years when the kids come for the holiday's the first thing they ask is dad making his pumpkin cake. I found that by switching yellow cake mix for Spicecake really makes the other flavors POP and if you cover the cake mix with pats of butter (side by side)  unmelted it will create an awesome crust.

just finished this in class. I ended up baking it for around 32 minutes. I was worried it would be too dark before it was baked through. But my chef told me to let it sit to cool and it would firm up, and it did. my crust was very crisp, and the pumpkin was smooth.

People continually say that there is not enough cake mix but if you look carefully, the cake box mix they list is 18.5 ounces and the usual Betty Crocker or Duncan Hines box of yellow cake is 15 or so ounces so plan accordingly.  If you note that difference it is a fantastic recipe.  I tried it in one of those brownie pans that is "S" shaped so that you get all pieces with edges and it is really fantastic in that!

This is overwhelmingly sweet and trust me I love sweets! I even reduced the 1/2 c. white sugar to 1/3 c. I also used a 8 x 11.5 inch pan which worked well. I changed the spices to 1/4 tsp. each of cloves, ginger, allspice, nutmeg, and 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon which was nice. It would have been better with nuts, but I omitted them due to my daughter's nut allergy. I would not call this recipe-cake, it is more like a layered pumpkin bar. It almost tastes like pumpkin cheesecake. Great recipe if you are making it to serve small pieces to lots of people, but too rich to eat very much at one time!

Absolutely amazing! The only difference I did was adding a tad less butter to the cake and the topping. Everyone loved it. I put the leftovers on the counter instead of the fridge and the cake crust didn't get soggy the next day :) Will def be making again!

OMG!!!!! Loved this, did it for Canadian Thanksgiving this year and it was mouth watering!  I used a french vanilla cake mix and put almonds on it.  I also baked it in a spring form pan as some others suggested.  It took about 55 minutes and it looked aweseome when you could see the layers.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it!!  Enjoy every bite.  It is good with whipped cream or ice cream.  Oh ya, I also drizzled caramel on it just before serving as well.

Made this recipe for bunco and I didn't have the 18.25 oz box of cake mix - just the standard 15 oz box and it turned out beautifully.  Definitely rich and the cool whip did add something extra to it (used the light version).

I used carrot cake mix, because it's already very "spicy," and the combination went really well.  I have to agree that the taste isn't very pumpkin-y, but it's still a great fall recipe.

I give this recipe a five-star because it turned out so delicious and I received praises from my in-laws even though it is the first time I ever made this cake. I did take the advice of previous reviewers and baked it in a 8x8 pan instead of a 9x13. You really would have to double the filling if you want it to fit in a 9x13 pan. And I sprinkled some nuts on the bottom of the crust before I add the filling, as well as on the top of the cake. Wonderful cake. This is definitely going into my favorite recipes collection.

I made this earlier today and it tastes delicious.  I didnt have cinnamon (for some odd reason) so i used a cinnamon sugar butter I had in the fridge with the plain butter!  My crumb topping wasn't as crumbly as I would like-my fault, but it stil tastes great!  I also added a cream cheese icing drizzle instead of nuts!

First time making it.  Everyone enjoyed it and went for seconds.  It definitely did well with chopped walnuts.  I wouldn't make it without them. It needed that crunch and texture.

These were way too sweet for me, and I have a sweet tooth! I made the recipe as written. I don't know how it would turn out if you reduced the sugar.

I would cut back on the sugar a bit.  It was  very sweet and I think for the amt of pumpkin used the bottom layer should be a little thicker... Maybe even double the cake mix.. This would probably be really good if you sunstitued apples and raisins for the topping also. A traditional crumb topping would be nicer also.. But I must say everyone seemed to like it.

Very Good! I just added some pumpkin spice to the pumpkin mixture and a little to topping. Made it in the 9x13 pan and had plenty of cake mixture for the crust. This would be extra good with some cool whip.

this cake was very easy to make and very tasty... i only made a few changes. I did what many others did and baked it in a springform pan, and i also added cinnamon and nutmeg to each layer. I also used a half cup plus a couple table spoons of egg substitute with one egg for the pumpkin layer

My family loves this. It is a really moist crumb cake and if you did not read the recipe you would not know that there was pumpkin in it. The cinnemon neutralizes the pumpkin flavor. You will love this.

This recipe is amazing, I mean really AMAZING. I made it for Thanksgiving and my entire family (even the picky ones who don't like pumpkin) devoured it. I just made another one at my husband's request and he will be expecting more for Christmas. Thank you for posting this recipe.

I made these yesterday to try out the recipe before Thanksgiving... I will DEFINITELY be making these for Thanksgiving, they tasted even better the next day after chilling in the fridge overnight which is perfect because I can make them ahead. When it was still warm, I served it with French Vanilla Ice Cream, and then cut them into bars the next day once chilled. MMMMM and so easy... definitely a keeper!

LOVE this recipe! I did make a few changes, added ground cloves and allspice to the pumpkin mixture. I also like using a springform pan better than 9x13, makes for a great presentation. It was a real hit, took the left overs to work and were gone within a few minutes. I will be making this again for the holiday dinners.

FANTASTIC recipe!  I made it in a 9x13 pan and it was great.  I wish I had whipped cream to put on top of each piece, but I didn't have any.  Great recipe!!

Made pretty much as directed except that I halved the white sugar in the recipe and subbed brown sugar for the crumble topping (also reduced to about 1/3 cup).    My hubby, who does not care for pumpkin, said it was very good.  There were enough flavors going on that he didn't just taste pumpkin.  DD loved her "pumpkin pie cake."  Thanks for sharing a recipe that the whole family could agree on!

This recipes is amazing. I tweeked it some and added a block of cream cheese to the filling and baked it for 1 hour and I added to the crumb topping by mixing it with my Fruit Crisp topping recipe that has chopped walnuts, oats and cinnamon in it. Added 3/4 of a stick of melted butter and a dash of maple syrup. Great recipe!! Definately putting this at the top of the thanksgiving dessert list.

VERY GOOD!  I followed the directions exactly except that I made mine in a 9" springform pan. It turned out beautiful!
The first time I made these, my husband was going to take them to work, but he forgot them, so he ate the ENTIRE plate in 2 evenings! He really likes them!

Delicious!  I made this for 8 of my best girlfriends at our monthly card party and they were raving over it.  My husband was lucky enough to get a piece when the party was over and he loved it too (and he is not a dessert eater at all)

We love this recipie. This will be my third Thnksgiving making this both for the holiday, as well as gifts. I did change two things, I bake it in a spring form pan, which makes a better presentation and cook it for about 15 min. more, I watch it closely and have even turned the oven off and just let it sit.

This came out soo good.  I now want to try different variations of this.  I do reccommend add at least 1/4 tsp of nutmeg as well.  It is wonderful!!!!!! My husband likes this and he is not a pumpkin fan!  Thank you for sharing!!!

Very, very good. The first time I made the cake the topping resembled the picture, the second time it was more like a traditional crumb cake topping - both times this recipe was a grand success.

Very good- Kind of like a pumpkin pie with a crunchy top.  Looks nice when cut into bars and put on a serving platter. I followed recipie exactly. Might add a bit of nutmeg next time to the pumpkin mixture.

I love this recipe. I love pumpkin pie but this is more flavorful. I have made it with a large can of pumpkin...it gives it more of a filling as less of a sweet taste.

This was good but not as great as I hoped. I think I am going to wait and try it cold. I found mine to be VERY sweet. So,if have a sweet tooth this the recipe for you. My husband, daughter, and neighbor LOVED them. I think that next time I am going to use more pumkin because mine tasted mostly of the "cake" crust and topping. Overall good but not great.

This cake is super! My husband told me how great it was right after he ate it, then later asked me if he'd told me how good it was. I had trouble with the topping (cake part)so I'll just add extra nuts for topping next time.

This was a great cake. Everyone really enjoyed this recipe. I don't even like pumpkin and I loved this. I am making it for Thanksgiving dinner. Try adding pecans to the top. I cut it up and made it into bars. It was really good.

We took it to a morning tailgate and it was a hit!  Plan to make it for our extended family one day for breakfast during Thanksgiving week.   Doubled the filling and added extra spices and extra nuts to the top. YUMMY!

Good Morning and Happy Holidays to All!

Made this early this morning to take to work.
Cooked in spring form pan for 1 hr.
Reduced sugar when noted to 1/3 cup instead of 1/2.
Added pecans to the cake base.
I sprinkled pecans on top of the crumble topping and they did burn a little so next time I will incorporate into crumble topping.  

Office thought this was a Winner!!  Thanks for sharing.

I made this for 2 school functions, plus for my family, and everyone loved it!  I get nothing but rave reviews!
The first time I made it, knowing that cake mixes don't have the same number of ounces as the recipe calls for, I added flour to the crust part of the recipe, after I'd reserved the 1 cup for the topping.  The next two times, I bought three cake mixes and made two recipes.  I ended up with extra cake mix, but added it into the crust anyway, and it turned out very well.

Easy enough to make and the combination of crunch/soft bites is perfect. I would put in about half of the sugar the recipe calls for , as it is kind of over the top sweet.

The recipe sounded a little too sweet, so I cut the sugar in the topping in half, down to 1/4 cup.  Overall it's still a little sweet for my taste.  Next time I make it I will try cutting the white sugar in the pumpkin filling in half also, down to 1/4 cup.
Other than the sweetness, I like this recipe.  I would definitely make it again.  Thanks, Debbie.

I followed verbatim except I did 3tsp of pumpkin pie spice because that’s what I had access to.  Turned out great.

I made it as written and loved it. 
It got crunchier the next day. Next time I will cut back on sugar. Thank you for sharing.

I just pulled the cake out of the oven and just had to try it.  Very delicious.  Next time I will reduce the sugar for the topping to 1/4 cup.   My sweet tooth isn't as sweet as it used to be.

Made this in the form of mini cupcakes to take to church for coffee hour.   Per other reviewers suggestions, added 1/2 tsp each of cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice & ginger and 1/4 tsp cloves.  Problem was the mini muffin tins were not deep enough to get enough pumpkin mixture in to get the flavor and crumb mixture would not stay on top of the cupcakes.  Took ‘em to church anyway.   Only two left at the end of the hour... and I ate those.
Made full size cupcakes out of the leftover mixtures and they were scrumptious.

Made this EXACTLY as the recipe states, but I used a Pillsbury gluten free yellow cake mix from Walmart. Absolutely delish! Pair with coffee, hot chai tea, or sweetened almond milk for an indulgent fall evening treat! Will be making this again, probably for a Thanksgiving potluck.

I made it as the recipe outlined in an 11x17 pan.  It was delicious!  When I make it again, i will use less sugar in the topping.  I shared it with neighbors and friends and haven't heard a complaint yet!

My family loved this pumpkin desert.   Next time I’ll follow the advice o read and add more spices to the pumpkin to pull out its flavor.   Will use my pumpkin pie spice for a kick.   I topped mine with pecans to make it extra special.   My son thinks the crumb topping could use some kosher salt so I might try that next time.   There will definitely be s next time.

I was expecting to go to heaven with this cake, but it wasn't as delicious as everyone else said it was. I followed a cook's idea of doubling the filling, but it was too gelatinous for my taste. I've made other pumpkiny treats that were way better.

Wonderful recipe....I did cut down the sugar in the toping to 1/4 cup and will  add less to the pumpkin filling next time.  I baked it in a glass decorative pie dish and it looked great when cut.....nice layers.  Think a 9 x 13 pan would have made it look too thin.  I also followed the suggestion to use ginger,  nutmeg, allspice, cloves and cinnamon totaling the 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon that was called for in the recipe.  Definitely will add this to our Thanksgiving menu for a nice change from regular pumpkin pie.

It's good.  I made as described, seasoning seemed good.   Took a lot longer to cook than expected.  I think it was 1hr 10min maybe?  I used a 9 in cake pan and it filled it nicely.  Was probably thicker than recipe calls for which would account for the additional time it took to bake.   Would have been helpful if the standard instructions for testing for doneness were included.  I had to guess, but this isn't my first time cooking so I felt some confidence in my "guess". :>)

This recipe was a total hit with all ages!  Personally i would double the cinnamon and decrease the white sugar by at least half as it was way too sweet for me. Possibly next time I will make it with all brown sugar and way less of even that.  I got rave reviews from the whole family just as is!

The first time I made it, I screwed up and put the 1 cup cake mix to put aside on the second step with the pumpkin mixture!!!! So then I opened up another box and put 1cup for the crumb part( of the cake mix) and added it to the half cup sugar n the 3TBLPS of butter!!! Crumbled it baked it and my husband LOVES it!!! Im making another batch right now the right way!! well see how it turns out!!!!! Thank you!!!

I prepared this recipe as directed. It was a great  ending to a nice pot roast dinner for company.  Next time I will reduce the sugar as others have suggested which is why I did not give it 5 stars. This was quick and  easy to prepare and a nice change from pumpkin pie.

This was wonderful! I put 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp allspice. I mixed the pecans into the crumble mix and it turned out wonderful. I also used an 8 x 11 pan and left in for an additional 10 mins. My 4 year old loved it even with the pecans!

This is amazing. Didn’t change a thing in the recipe. I should have made 2 batches for church coffee hour today. It was a big hit! ??

I followed the recipe exactly and baked in a 9 x 13" glass pan.  It is delicious but what I would do slightly different is to cut back on the 1 cup of cake mix set aside for the topping and add only 1/4 c of sugar.  I found the topping to be a bit too sweet for my tastes.  

I found I had to bake it more than 10 extra minutes probably because it was in a glass pan as opposed to metal.  

I will make this again.  A big hit with my hubby.

Followed the recipe and it came out PERFECT!! I have another recipe similar to this, but my family thinks this one is a little better..  This is definitely a keeper. You gotta try it if you're a Pumpkin lover.  Oh yeah, add some whipped cream or vanilla ice cream, Delicious!

This is a great recipe. My family loved it. I omitted the white sugar in the batter. and it was sweet enough. Because my cake mix was only 15 oz I made my own topping with 1 cup self-rising flour, 2/3 cup brown sugar, 5 T soft butter and 1 cup chopped nuts. Everyone wanted the recipe.

This was a delicious dessert; my family loved it!  I used a 15 oz. gluten free yellow cake mix and baked in a 9" square pan.  I added nutmeg and allspice along with the cinnamon to the pumpkin mixture.

I'm not exactly sure why but I was not a fan of this.  The taste was ok, but there was something "off" about the texture.  In addition, having three separate layers was quite a lot of work.  I doubt I will make this again.

I almost gave it 2 stars.  I always forget to read the reviews prior to making a recipe.  I saw previous reviews that said the crumb topping was too sweet - yes it was - and I’m a sugar addict.  Another review said if you’re baking in a glass dish, bake at 325...because the bottom can overcook - yes it did.  However, even if I had made those 2 revisions I’m not sure I would like it any more.  To me, other than the overload of sugar, it had no taste

I made a couple of small changes, I added a half teaspoon of nutmeg and a teaspoon of vanilla. I've  made this a few times and it never lasts long. I am not a big fan of anything pumpkin, but this is really good..I will be making again and again.

I'm not sure I would make this again.  It was ok, but it didn't knock y socks off as it seemed to for other reviewers.  I made it in an oval Corningware baking dish approx. 8 x 11.  My cake mix was 15.25 oz., so I added a couple of ounces of flour, 1/2 t. of baking soda and used jumbo eggs to make up the difference of the 18.25 oz. cake mix required.  I did add some more spices to enhance the pumpkin part: cloves, ginger, allspice and nutmeg...along with the cinnamon it all equaled almost 2 t.  We served it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream along side of the cake, and it's a good thing...it really needed it.  I would suggest serving it with ice cream or whipped cream otherwise it's too dull and slightly dry.  If I ever choose to make this again, I would double the filling part for sure...and add even more spice.  I reduced the butter in the cake part by 2 T. and reduced the sugar in the topping by 1/4 c. due to many reviewers stating that it was too sweet.  But I don't think these changes took away from the potential to be 5 star...it's just not a "wow" dessert overall.  I really wanted to like it better than I did.  Sorry Debbie.  I will try other recipes instead.

Tasted good, but I was expecting a little more cake texture. But then again this is the first time making this sort of recipe. My expectations may need expanding to better appreciate this. Not a favorite with the family.

Loved this! I baked it a bit longer than recommended, added traditional pumpkin pie spices to the pumpkin mixture added more butter to the crumb topping, and sprinkled cinnamon in top prior to sprinkling the chopped pecans. All in all this is a really simple and quick recipe.

my husband loved it but for me it was a little too sweet.  Will cut down a bit on the added sugar but plan to make it again.

Wow, this is delight! I made it last night, and it was a half a cake. This morning, I shared a few pieces of cake around the  neighborhood, yes, they want the recipe! Don't be afraid of this recipe, it is really easy. When you try it- eat it in a closet in secret....or, you get writing a lot recipes for everyone. good day

Made it per the recipe. Put nuts on about a third of it. Did not like the walnut portion. The pecan section was better, but prefer it without the nuts.

Wow!  The best, my husband's favorite.  I reduced the sugar 1/4cup for the crust and 1/4 cup of white and 1/8 cup of brown for the filling.  For the topping  1/8 cup sugar.  No other changes were made. Perfect for us.  Will be making this often.

I was not all that impressed. It was just ok. I did cut back on sugar. Used an orange cake mix instead of yellow, because that's what I had. It just wasn't that flavorable in my opinion. I would not make it again.

This is a great recipe.  Like other reviewers, I will cut some of the sugar from the topping, it is a bit too sweet. Other than that this is a great fall dessert.

Made the recipe just as listed and my husband really like it.  I didn't give it 5 stars only because the bottom did get quite dark and I did bake it using the middle rack.  Will make again and maybe adjust temperature just a little

I made this as directed and it turned out pretty good. I stored it in the refrigerator overnight and it held up well the next day.  It was easy to put together too.  However, the topping was too sweet for me and overpowered the pumpkin a bit.

Made this to bring to a Halloween-themed party, and everyone who tried it seemed to like it.  Personally, I liked it very much.  I cut back the sugar by about 25-30%, and like other reviewers, I made it in a 9 inch springform pan and used a variety of spices instead of just cinnamon.  Next time, I'll probably try a rectangular pan instead of a springform pan because the bottom layer seemed a little too thick.  But overall, I think this one is a keeper.

The flavor is great.  I changed nothing and made exactly as directed.  It is super sweet and very moist, almost like a pie filling than a cake.  The crumb cooked perfectly and looks great.  I may try cutting the sugar in half next time though.

This will  now be my signature fall dessert.  I mixed the nuts with the crumb rather than garnish it.  I used a springform pan and baked for an extra 5 minutes.  I'm wondering if anyone add a shot of rum to the pumpkins layer.

This was scrumptious! I cut the granulated sugar by 1/2 & next time will cut the brown sugar by 1/2 as well. Was a little too sweet but still really good. 
Definitely will be making this again.

I turned out great! Everybody loved it. Not difficult to follow the recipe.  I loved because the pumpkin wasn’t overbearing. Lisa

It was a pretty simple recipe to follow and the cake itself is a deliciously sweet crumb cake. The brown sugar gives the bottom layer a wonderful caramel flavor.

I made this recipe as written and it was awesome.
We ate it warm and put vanilla ice cream on top which kind of melted into it.
I would definitely make again. It is very filling too.

I made this recipe last night for my husband's birthday -- a bit of a change from the traditional birthday cake -- and we all LOVED it!!  In fact, I already bought the ingredients to make another one today because my brother came down to visit this morning.  The only thing I changed was to use one cup of nuts instead of half a cup for the topping; I used pecans and it was just delicious -- and I bought butter pecan ice cream that went with it perfectly!!

The only thing I added was a pinch of cinnamon to the crumb topping. I was excited to try this recipe because it just sounded yummy. I am usually left a little unimpressed when my expectations start off high. However, in this case, it was even better than I expected. My family and I loved it!

Used Duncan Hines yellow cake mix and fresh pumpkin I cooked up the day before. To make more crumbs, I added 1/4 cup cake flour and a little brown sugar to reserved cake mix.

This is pretty much the perfect recipe.  It's easy to make, wonderful, and tasty.  I tend to take this to parties in the fall, and it is always a big hit.  I haven't met a person that doesn't love it.  I typically shy away from recipes that incorporate box mixes, but this is the exception!

Good.  But I would like advice about how to keep crumbs crispy. Any crumb recipe I've made tends for them  to get soggy after one day old.  I want crispy crumbs for the life of the crumb cake!  Thanks in advance!

Used a slightly smaller pan (8 x12).  Added one teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice.  Mixed the nuts into the crumble mix as mentioned by someone else.  Definitely a keeper!

I used Spice cake instead of yellow. It was delicious. I served it warmed with either whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. Perfect holiday dessert. Easy to make, but count the items it really calls for 4 eggs and more sugar when you read the instrections.

Rating based on potential.  But not because of the recipes fault! I didn't want a flat, thin, result so i baked in a springform pan. Had to bake almost twice as long and unfortunately the bottom burned. BUT!! It still was amazing!! This will be made again and baked at  a lower temp for longer time.  I think that I'll tweak the pumpkin part-make it more pie like so it sets up quicker. It just took forever to set.

This very easy recipe has made a hit with groups I have served. It is somewhere between a pumpkin pie and a pumpkin cake- moist, very flavorful and great tasting. It's my new go-to for company.

Delicious. I changed it up a bit and used mango instead of pumpkin.  I used 2 cups of mashed  mango with a tsp of cornstarch and the juice of 1 small lime. Great recipe.

I have made this recipe at least a dozen times now.  I do doctor the pumpkin with dashes of ginger, nutmeg, and cloves, as other reviewers suggest.  I've made it for neighbors, coworkers, friends.  Everyone always raves and describes it as "amazing," "divine", "so delicious"!!

A very good desert.  Easy to make.   I made it for a group of people and they went for seconds.  My grand daughter asked me to share the recipe with her mom.  We had it with ice cream, a whipped topping would also be good.  I will definitely make it again, probably for Thanksgiving.

Used an 8x8 pan. Made with gluten free yellow cake mix, omitted the nuts and used cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice instead of just cinnamon. Also used coconut sugar instead of white. I cooked it for 50 minutes and it came out perfect! Everyone devoured it!

Very easy to make and very tasty! I followed recipe exactly except that I added more spices to the pumpkin filling. I added more cinnamon, some nutmeg, ginger and cloves. I'd make this again.

Wow is this good! Easy, made with everyday pantry items too! It's a combination of cake and pie- and that's quite appealing! Moist filling but slightly crunchy topping. Don't just read this review- make it!

It was amazing!  It makes the best presentation, though using a spring form pan.  Also, I bake it on 250 degrees for over an hour or so, the lower the heat, the longer to bake.  It's so much better this way.  Lastly, don't be afraid to slather on the crushed walnuts.!  Oh, and I use a 20oz. can, I believe, just adjust spices, add more cinnamon and I add pumpkin pie spice.  If you want to cut the sugar, go for it, you can make up for the lack of sweet with ice cream and whipped topping!!  Delish! !

This is a fabulous alternative to the pumpkin pie at holiday time. I have to say, I found these scrumptious Pumpkin Spice Morsels (look like chocolate chip morsels except they're orange) and added them to the recipe. TO DIE FOR! I also added a dollop of whip cream to the individual servings.  I can not say enough good things about this recipe.

Pursuant to another review I used a spice cake and this was a WINNER at a fall pot luck.  Next time, instead of using the reserved cake mix as part of the "crumble," I'll use a regular crumb topping and 1 C. of nuts as I didn't care for the one in this recipe.  Otherwise I would have given this a 5 star rating.

This was very moist and rich!  I made them into muffins and the crumb topping fell off, but was very tasty!!  I will definitely make this again.  I used a carrot cake instead of a yellow.

This is a very tasty dessert and easy to make.  I couldn't stop eating it.  I added some blueberries on top and used almonds.  It was great to have very different flavors and textures at each level of the cake.  I highly recommend this recipe and plan to make it a staple.

My husband, who loves pumpkin pie, says this is better than pumpkin pie.  He would rate this a 5. But it doesn't work for me. I would rate this a 3 star. But since hubby loved it I rated it higher. It is good and it is easy. But even after cutting down on the sugar this is too, too sweet to me.  Not nearly enough pumpkin flavor.  The pumpkin is overpowered by the cake and all the sugar. I made this in a 10x10 glass pan. I baked it at 325 for almost 1 hour. The layers do look great.

I made this recipe and the "Great Pumpkin Dessert" at the same time since the ingredients were very similar.  My tasters at the office decided that this one was better, however they really liked the crunchy topping from the other recipe.  I'll have to work on that.  I made this exactly as written; I used the same bowl for the base and the filling.  Very easy.

Delicious and my husband loved it. I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg to the pumpkin filling and 1/4 cup sugar to the crumb topping after reviews said the crumb topping was too sweet with 1/2 cup sugar. It was perfect.

This was awesome! I am a fan of pumpkin desserts but this one is better than pumpkin pie. I will be adding this to my Thanksgiving table. I did change the white sugar to brown sugar for the topping mixture.

I am not a baker by any means. This was simple and such a HIT at Friendsgiving. I did take some user's advice and double the pumpkin filling - it turned out perfect. I added pumpkin spice, all spice and an extra sprinkle of brown sugar to the top layer. Thank you, Debbie!

I suppose I was expecting something more like a crumble or cake, but it was definitely like eating pumpkin pie with a really thick crust. I enjoyed the crumble on top, but it just felt like it was missing something. It might be better with spices other than cinnamon (and more of them!) and a thinner bottom layer. As written, we just thought it was alright.

I took "Sweetcakes" advice and doubled the filling.  I too add spices to just about everything. Cinnamon, Nutmeg and Cloves always with Pumpkin. Because the density was doubled, it took more than twice the time to bake -- but well worth the wait.

I doubled the pumpkin filling part, did pumpkin pie spice instead, and added extra cinnamon. It's hard to over spice pumpkin filling. It was perfect. Loved the crumb topping! I'm just not sure about the crust. It's just like a burnt cake at the bottom. I think I'd appreciate more of a crumb-like bottom as well. it does get soggy the next day, so serve immediately with some nice whipped cream.

OMG!  This recipe is awesome!  I followed it exactly the first time and my husband thought it was great, I just thought it was OK.  After reading all the review, the second time I decided to make a couple of changes. I made it in a smaller pan, an oval shaped, just a little smaller than 13x9 which makes every layer a littler thicker.  Also, for the topping I mixed the walnuts into it instead of putting them on top.  After these changes my husband said it was the best dessert EVER.  I don't normally eat the desserts, just bake them but i tried it and this was definitely one of the best desserts ever!

Really good, but I did cut sugar in filling and topping in half.  I'm so glad I did because it was plenty sweet.  Anymore sugar and it would have been too sweet.  Also, baked in 10x10 size pan which was perfect.  With those minor changes it was perfect.  Young and old loved it.

I have made this probably 10 times now and always as a dessert to share at gatherings. It's a definite thumbs up! I also add 1 tsp. of nutmeg and a half teaspoon more of cinnamon. YUM it's a favorite and requested by family and friends. Also...I've made this with margarine before when I didn't have butter and I didn't like it as well.

I made this again for my family's Thanksgiving dinner with a few changes.  I used a spice cake mix, which really kicked up the flavor a notch.  Like the first time, I used fresh pumpkin puree and pecans.  I added an extra egg and 3/4 bar of cream cheese, but I didn't really notice a firmer texture nor the flavor of cream cheese.  I will definitely make this again!

This recipe is out of this world. I mean it! I think this may be one of the best recipes I have ever made. We polished this off in no time, and I'm running to the store later to make another one tonight. I didn't use a yellow cake mix, though. I used a caramel cake mix with pecans sprinkled on top, and it turned out great. Definitely using this recipe for Thanksgiving! Thanks for posting this recipe!

Great recipe - try with chocolate cake with chocolate chips on top!  You MUST let sit overnight to get best flavor.  I didn't use any sugar in the topping, and cut the butter in half on the crust and it was still wonderful and not too sweet.

Very good!   since it doesn't have evaporated milk in it, it is more dense.   would add more spice as in a pumplin pie for more flavor.

This was fantastic! My family thinks it's better than pumpkin pie and we love pumpkin pie. I had a larger can of pumpkin so I added two more eggs and more spice and only had a white cake mix. I put it in a springform pan and it looked wonderful when it was cooked. Thanks for the excellent recipe.

Very tasty - made as is except used splenda.  Only thing I will do different next time is reduce the amount of butter in the crust by a couple tablespoons.

Very good!! I put whip cream on the top.  I agree with some of the other reviews that it would be better in a spring form pan so there would be more filling.  I will make it this way next time.

This was easy to make and tastes great, just too much cake. Next time I'll definately do something different to make it less cakey!

This was tasty.  I replaced 3 tbs. butter for applesauce in the crust and took out 1/8 c. of sugar.  The crust was more cake like then a dense bar but was still yummy.  I also replaced 1 tbs. butter in the crumb mix with applesauce and used only 1/8 c. sugar and could not tell the difference.  Overall this was yummy but I am not sure if I will make it again.  I also think that it will taste better tomorrow after refrigerating.

Better than 5 stars!!!!I just made this for a Halloween party I went to and the whole pan was gone within 3 hours! I'm not a baker and wasn't sure how these would go over but everyone was talking about them and asking who made them. I don't even like pumpkin that much but these were to die for.

My family is going crazy over this recipe!  My husband cannot stop eating it and my son is addicted to it.  I made it just an hour ago and it's half gone.  I can't really think of any changes other than I might try mixing brown sugar with the butter and cake mix for the topping instead of white sugar.  Great dessert.

I cut this into bars and served on an appetizer buffet.  I was crazy about it, but others weren't quite so sure.  I had a lot leftover.  Very easy and great pumpkin pie taste.

This was very good and easy to make. Better than regular pumpkin pie. My entire family liked it - that's a first!
