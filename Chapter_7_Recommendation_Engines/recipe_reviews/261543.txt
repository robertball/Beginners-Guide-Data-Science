I used Boar’s Head all beef hotdogs and grilled them. The only change I made to the recipe was to buy prepackaged coleslaw that included carrots. I did not add red cabbage. I also added two seeded and chopped jalapeño peppers. 
I bought buns that were split on top and some people put the slaw inside the bun and the hotdog on top for easier eating. I used a fork and knife.  This was a fantastic summer meal. I served with cut up cantaloupe and grapes and potato chips.
