I switched up the nuts & seeds that went in, as well as substituting 1/2 cup apple sauce for the agave nectar and adding a little extra honey.  I also substituted brown rice flour for the brown wheat flour and they stuck together fine! They are earthy and tasty, and not too sweet at all! I think next time I'll try it with dried cranberries and some dark chocolate chunks. Yum!
