This is so good!!! I followed the whole trip to the letter- the only adjustments made were an additional stalk of celery and a cup of peas. I also added an additional 3 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce. I also found that two pounds of beef is way too much to fit in a regular pie pan, I had to use a deep

Super simple and yummy!  I skipped the wine and added edamame and cauliflower in addition to the veggies listed.  It yielded enough for 2 large pot pies.  

Kids just got home and are excited about the good smell!

Wow! This was really good. Even the pickiest of eaters had more than 2 full servings...very unusual. I only made minor substitutions based on what I had on hand. I used Chicken Stock because that's what I had and I only had a 6oz can of tomato paste. Otherwise, as written.  I covered the pot for the 45 minutes of simmer and veggies were perfect. Great comfort food recipe to have on hand.
