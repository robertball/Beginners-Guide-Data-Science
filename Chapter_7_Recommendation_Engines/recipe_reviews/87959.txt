I baked this in a stoneware 9x13 and just used cooking spray, no flour. Pieces came out beautifully. My batter was also sticky but no fear, the cake also came out wonderfully moist. To spread the batter evenly in the bottom of pan, I just dipped the back of my spoon in a little flour each time I spread it. For the 2nd layer of batter on top of the peaches, I just plopped dollups of batter all over; it spread together very nicely. I used fresh peaches which were very juicy. I was worried it would be messy (too wet) but the cake batter cooked everything evenly together. I didn't modify any of the ingredients and comments I received from coworkers were 1) wasn't sweet at all, perfect flavor; 2) very moist; 3) very delicious. Definitely a KEEPER! One of which I'll be making again SOON!

Nice and easy to make and tastes pretty good. It seems to me that it is missing something...maybe some cinnamon mixed into the batter or sprinkled on the peaches. I did have to omit the pecans because my son is allergic to nuts, but the topping tasted good anyway.

Excellent recipe.  Cake came out light and delicious.  I used non fat plain yogurt instead of sour cream.  That was the only change I made.

The batter spreads easily with a metal spatula.  It may not seem like enough batter when you're spreading it - but it is.  Thanks for a great recipe!

As I began to spread the first half of the batter in the pan, I got a little impatient.  So, taking the lead from mominml, I put all the batter in the pan, then topped it with the peaches and streusel.  It did work well, and it was so much easier than spreading the two layers of batter.  The butter and sour cream contributed great flavor and made the cake deliciously moist – so moist, I fear, that if there were leftovers the next day they’d be soggy.  Not wanting to take any chances, I froze individual pieces of the remaining cake.  I appreciated the buttery rich flavor of the cake against the fresh, pure flavor of the peaches, with no other spices or distracting add-ins. I made the recipe with no changes – other than my concern about it getting soggy if it hung around for more than a day, it was perfect just as is.

I cut this in half for and 8X8 pan for breakfast this morning. Huge mistake!!!  I now have another 8X8 pan in the oven baking.  I was saving half of my leftover peaches to make muffins, but everyone loved this cake so much that I ended up using them for another pan.  This is so moist and delicious.  A few changes based on what I had: didn't use pecans in the topping, used brown sugar in the topping because that is my preference.  I also didn't layer the batter.  I spread the batter in the bottom of the pan, placed the peaches on top and then sprinkled with the streusel.  This worked really well for me.  I think that this recipe would work well with other fruits and berries as well and will definitely be trying this again.  Thanks!

This is really good. I needed to make something with my surplus of peaches and this seemed to be the best candidate. I've tried it with frozen and fresh peaches and I much prefer fresh, though frozen was good too. I didn't have pecans so I omit them and I double the streusel. Most recently, I used raspberries instead of peaches and sprinkled a little sugar on them when I put them in the batter. This was very good as well. Thanx for a great recipe!

This was truly delicious !  The texture is dense but light and not overly sweet.  It would be wonderful with your morning cup of coffee or tea.  I did double the topping (left out the pecans) and I am glad I did.  This cake rises to the top of the 9 x 13 pan and it needs the additional topping.  I also added a 1/4 cup brown sugar to the topping ingredients and think it made a wonderful addition.  Will make this again !

This was good, but not great.  If it hadn't take so long (it takes a while to slice peaches, and then you've got to wait the 45 minutes of baking) I would have rated it higher.  But the effort/time to deliciousness ratio was too low for me to make this one again.  It could be sweeter, and definitely needs some more spices - ginger, or nutmeg maybe?  I don't know, but it's missing something.

Perfect!  I made 5 tiny loaf pans.  I had a little left over, so next time I will make 6.  Everyone I gave them to loved them.  I used fat-free plain yogurt.

My sister could not stop talking about this scrumptious cake! It was to die for! And the best part of it all was that I used "Smart Balance Light", in place of the butter, reduced fat sour cream, and lastly Splenda Sugar blend for baking in place of the sugar. And you couldn't even come close to noticing. However, I must admit that I commited two moral sins: #1: I used canned peaches (which when put into context was the only reason I made this cake, because I had so many cans of  peaches!) and #2: I didn't make the to-die-for crumb topping, which I love on nearly everything, simply becuase I was too lazy. Ah well!  But I am going to go out on a limb and say that I did do something to make up for those sins (haha). I made a concotion that turned out to be delicious and complenting glaze for this cake! I took some raspberry preserves and I put them in a saucepan over medium high heat until they become almost "syruppy", persay. Then I added them to some sour cream and mixed the two together with a wee bit of splenda and drizzled over the cake! Yum! The raspberry and peach flavors go divine together!

There's enough batter; it's just a little hard to manipulate.  When I make it again, I will add the nuts after I've cut in the butter.  Fabulous.

Very delicious!  I cut the recipe in half because I wasn't sure the family would like it but after it came out of the oven it was clear that this is definitely a must make again type of recipe!  The only thing I did differently was use canned peaches and sprinkle a little bit of cinnamon and sugar on them before spreading the rest of the batter on them.  Will have to make sure the peaches are drained a whole lot better next time as it was still a little doughy/soggy in the middle.  Extending the cook time a little bit might also help?  Either way, a great recipe and an instant family favorite.  Thanks!!

I replaced sour cream w/ Kirkland plain greek yogurt & used splenda instead of sugar. 
I was worried because the batter was "dough like",
but it turned out great. Definately making this again. It had a great flavour--will try in a bundt pan next time - still have lots of peaches to use up .

Made cake as directed except added 1 tbs. Cinnamon to batter and sprinkled some on top of peaches. I added 1/2 cup oatmeal to topping and used brown sugar. Used extra tbs. Butter because of the oatmeal. Add nuts after you mix in the butter. Yummy.

Excellent and easy.  I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream, and a combination of peaches and mangoes, both frozen.  Got lots of compliments!  Thanks!

used greek yogurt, fresh peaches. was a bit difficult to spread out but using the dollop technique it worked. Double the topping, you wont regret it!  I did add a tiny bit of saigon cinnamon to the batter, as others said it was pretty bland, and I only had stoneground whole wheat flour on me and it was great out of the oven.

Although I am not a big baked peach fan, I had a few to use and this recipe looked interesting.  I didn't have lots of time, so I took the advice of a reviewer and spread the batter in the pan, put the peaches on the batter and then spread the streusel topping on the peaches.  It baked up beautifully and tasted really good warm.  I will definitely serve this at my B&B this summer.   I also think with a few extra peaches it would be a very nice summer dessert - served with vanilla ice cream out of the oven.   Yum - thanks for the posting!

This was a fairly easy recipe to make and quite tasty.  I doubled the topping as many  here have suggested.  The topping was very good in itself, but I feel that it overwhelmed  the peach flavor.  I was looking for a recipe that really showcases fresh peaches.  I'm wondering if adding lemon juice and sugar to the cut peaches might help enhance the taste, especially if they're not highly flavorful? Next time I'm going to put the fresh sliced peaches on top  before baking, use more peaches and perhaps use a sour cream glaze of some sort after it's out of the oven instead of the pecan topping.

We've always loved this recipe.  Recently, we've made it with a bundt cake pan, but had to add 15 minutes to the baking time due to the thickness.  We added vanilla yogurt to the top of it and it tasted wonderful!

Soft, moist, delicious and easy!  I felt like I could have used about 6 cups of peaches at least, instead of just 4.  I was hoping it would be more peachy.  I also sprinkled some sugar and cinnamon on top of the peaches before added the second layer of cake, and it turned out delicious!

I gave this 3 stars because I had to play with it to get a good result.  I used dark brown sugar, 3 cups of chopped peaches, added an extra tablespoon of butter to the recipe and added flavour.  I replaced the vanilla with ground coriander seed and ground clove, adding both to the batter and the topping (and skipped the cinnamon), which was very sparse.  Instead of doubling it, I sprinkled the whole thing with some coconut palm sugar.  And I used oats in place of the nuts.  It was delicious.

Yummy coffee cake. Not to sweet, so you can eat it all day long. I added some ground cinnamon and ginger to the batter and the crumble topping, because I like spices. Makes a bit of a mess of the kitchen, but worth the clean up effort.

Tasty good! The batter came out more like biscuit dough (that you'd cut rather than spread), but it came out delicious. On the advice of some of the reviewers, we sprinkled cinnamon and a touch of nutmeg over the peaches. I don't like having to cut my bites, so I coarsely chopped the peaches instead of slicing them. I didn't peel them, and it was fine.

This coffee cake is delicious. Because others said it didn't have enough "umph", I added 1 tsp cinnamon to the dry ingredients. I also substituted fat free plain yogurt for the sour cream as well as whole wheat pastry flour for the all-purpose. Because it has 1/2 cup butter, it's plenty decadent without the fat from the sour cream. you won't miss it! It took 1 hour and 5 minutes to bake. I thought it might be overdone because it was so much longer than the recipe states, but it's moist and delicious. Totally a keeper!

This is a good recipe and a nice side dish at breakfast time, and looks delicious. The cake was light and moist and the peaches tender -- everything you'd expect a coffee cake to be. But like some others I found the overall recipe lacking in flavor. Part of that (I think) was because my peaches were bland, but mostly I think this recipe needs spices added to the batter and/or sugar/spices added to the fresh peaches. If I make it again, I'd be tempted to make extra topping and add a layer of topping under the peaches. Canned peaches might actually be better because of the extra sugar/syrup would add flavor.   I used my stand mixer and mixed the batter really well till light. Be sure not to put too much batter on the bottom half (layer will seem thin but that's OK) or you won't have enough to stretch over the top. I found that using dinner knives (one to spread the batter and the other to scrape stuck batter off the spreader) did the trick in mostly covering the peaches. Love the topping and it was a satisfactory amount for me. By the way, using fresh peaches, this takes much longer than the 20 minutes indicated to prepare. I used a glass pan sprayed with coating (no flour) and the cake came right out.

I whipped this up with my 8 year old daughter for Sunday breakfast and it was absolutely fantastic! The only changes I made are; I used canned peaches, (1 big can), used plain Bulgarian yogurt instead of sour cream(all I had) with a bit of milk and omitted the nuts. It was delicious, soft and moist with hot peaches oozing out the middle and a nice crunchy topping!   Had the leftovers for dessert with custard the next day, fabulous!

Very yummy!  I little heavier/denser than I was expecting.  I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp each cloves, allspice and ginger to the batter. I substituted brown sugar for white sugar in the topping, and peach yogurt for the sour cream.  I recommend doubling the topping... I will make this again, and will probably double the baking powder.

I thought this recipe was very good.  I made it for a Labor Day picnic and every raved about it.  It was a little time consuming and hard to spread the batter but it was worth it.  The only changes I made was to add some flour, cinnamon,sugar and nutmeg to the peaches for some added flavor.  I will definitely be making this again.

Did anyone else notice that trying to spread half the batter this recipe makes in a 9x13 pan results in a film about ¼ inch thick?  I chose to use the whole amount for the bottom layer and made a second batch for the top layer.  Better, I think, to use an 8-inch round pan and maybe two cups of chopped peaches.  I made the streusel with brown sugar instead of white for better flavor.  And the reviewer who worried that the cake would get soggy overnight is absolutely correct - serve this within a few hours after baking or it becomes inedible.

Delicious, we couldn't stop at 1 slice.  I added 1/4 tsp Chinese 5 spice (per Chief John) & 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the batter. For the topping I used brown sugar, added cinnamon & nutmeg but replaced part of the flour with oatmeal.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

Not what I expected. Made as written. Cake wasn't at all very flavorful and the peaches needed sugar mixed with them.
 Won't be making this again.

My granddaughter just made this cake from some of our fresh peaches.The recipe was simple and I only had to go to store for sour cream. All the other ingredients were in my kitchen. The cake was delicious. My husband and I both love it.The grandkids all tried it and said they liked it, but I don't think it was one of their favorites, so doesn't seem to be a kids kind of cake.I did have to bake it ten minutes longer than recipe said. My oven is not working right lately so I'm not sure if it would need to be baked longer in regular oven. A little cool whip on top really made it hit the spot. I'm wondering if same recipe can be used for apples? We have several apple trees and when they're ripe I'm planning on trying it.Not sure if need to cook apples first. This is one recipe I'm going to use again and again.

Wonderful!   I don't have sour cream so I used skim milk.   It made a wonderful smooth silky batter.  No trouble spreading it in the pan!    And it baked up soft and fluffy.   Tastes great.   I also didn't peel the peaches.   I never do for cobbler either.   I will certainly make it again.   Thanks for the recipe.

Like a lot of other people, I was nervous that there was not enough cake batter, but it turned out great! I bought some bumped and bruised peaches at the farmer's market and tossed them in a little sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg before I added them to the cake.  I also added a about 2 tsp of cinnamon to the batter to perk it up (I'm a cinnamon addict).  It also took a lot longer than 45 minutes to bake-- a little over 1 hour. It was a little long on time and work, but overall a very good cake (I keep "evening it out!").

Everyone loved this cake! It was very moist and soft. I did make a few changes - I only had one egg! So I used the one egg and added about 1/3-1/2 cup of applesauce for moisture. It turned out great, and it was healthier that way too. Next time I think I will add a little almond flavoring to the batter too.

Made recipe exactly as listed. I think next time instead of making a peach layer I will mix the peaches directly into the batter. I'm sorry to say it did not have a lot of flavor but add whip cream and/or ice cream and it was good. FYI: The recipe did not indicate that the finished product required refrigeration. As my husband was cutting a piece the next day he said "did you put blueberries in here too?"  Nope - it was mold.  You savvy bakers are probably laughing at that and couldn't imagine not knowing to refrigerate. Unfortunately, I didn't know.

This coffee cake was delicious!  I was worried when it didn't seem like there was enough batter to cover the bottom of the dish and the top of the peaches, but I put it in the oven on good faith and it came out wonderfully!  I will make this again, but will make a few changes next time - probably a little more sugar in the batter and a brown sugar crumble for the top.  Thanks for a good recipe!

8.12.17  This is a nice coffee cake, but I would do things a little differently the next time.  Instead of layering the peach slices in the center of the cake, I would chop them, mix with a little flour so they don’t all fall to the bottom, stir into the batter, and reserve some slices to go on the top underneath the streusel.   My husband said he wanted to taste the peach more, and I think this way you’ll get more peach flavor in every bite.  But not really complaining, this was moist, tender, just sweet enough, and not overpowered by cinnamon, as many peach coffee cake recipes are.

Great recipe!  We like it because it's not too sweet...but sweet enough!  I used about 2/3 of the batter for the bottom of the cake, then put dollops of it on top of the peaches.  For the topping, I increased the amounts so there was enough to cover the whole cake.

I used fresh peaches that I cut into pieces versus leaving them sliced.  The batter was sticky but I was able to spread the first layer using the tip provided by another reviewer - dipping a spoon in flour first.  The second layer was easier - just put spoonfuls of batter evenly around the pan.  I also added a few extra  chopped pecans  onto the top layer before adding the 'crumbs', since my husband loves nuts.  The finished product was wonderful....not too sweet, not soggy.   Two days later, still not soggy! It has a wonderful flavor and consistency.  Definitely will make again.  I used a 9X13 stoneware pan but after 45 minutes at 325, the cake was not completely baked.   I was running late for an appointment so upped the oven temp to 350, baked it for  5 minutes longer at 350, turned the oven off with the cake still in it,  and left.  When I returned home two hours later, it was cooked perfectly.  Next time I will just bake it at 350 and watch the time.

This turned out fantastic. I did make some adjustments. Used slightly more sugar in batter (just a heaping cup), spread the batter, layered the peaches and the added the topping. Doubled the recipe for topping. The amount in the recipe is not enough for a good layer on a 9X13. Also, had to really play with the time and temperature. Went at least 15 minutes over time at 325 degrees and still up temp at that point to 350 for additional 5 mins. Just keep testing and keep an eye on it.  :-) Enjoy!!!!  I baked mine in a glass 9X13.

This was awesome - is a really good desert - hot with ice cream - or just plain.  Left out the pecans, but the topping still had a nice crunch.  I think I will try it with the pears that will be ripe next month.

Light, not too sweet but satisfying. I also used yogurt in place of sour cream (but it was vanilla!)and an all-purpose gluten-free flour for half the flour (that was all I had). I did use extra cinnamon throughout the recipe!

This has the potential to be a great recipe. First time I made it was as directed and was somewhat disappointed, it was good but not great, as other have said it seemed to be missing something. The second time, I added cinnamon, little extra brown sugar and used vanilla paste in place of the extract. Much much better as it punches up the flavor a bit. Make sure you layer the peaches and cake mixture, it really makes for a better result. It just takes a minute so don't be lazy! Overall a good base recipe.

My neighbor went peach picking and gave me a bunch of very ripe, fresh peaches, so I needed a good recipe to use them for.

I made this recipe, but only half, for I did not want a bigger temptation.  I left out the nuts and substituted almond extract for the vanilla, not for any particular reason.  It was way more delicious than I had anticipated.  Like another reviewer, I kind of just put the peaches on top instead of layering them. I  did that mostly because I didn't have enough batter, using only half the recipe, it wasn't too deep in the dish I used.  (I actually used a pyrex pie plate)

Great recipe... I'm now going to try it using apples!!

Decent recipe, however, I agree with one reviewer who said it tastes like it needs something.  Next time I might add a little bit of nutmeg or possibly allspice.  Otherwise pretty good.  I used canned peaches and it worked out great.  I did not add pecans.  I made it in an 8x4 loaf pan so I had to bake it for 75 minutes to get it done all the way through. It came out light textured and delicious.  It gets better if you let it sit for while before you eat it.  Let it cool completely.

This recipe has lots of potential. I made it exactly as written except I didn't have any sour cream so I used sweet cream instead. The texture of the cake is moist and delicious, but I agree with one reviewer that overall, the cake as a whole is a little bland. I think I will make it again but double the topping and sprinkle half of it over the peaches before I add the last layer of batter. Also, my cooking time was closer to 1 hour. Overall, I would recommend with a little tweaking.

I made this coffee cake this afternoon. It was OK, nothing super spectacular. My only substitute was yogurt instead of sour cream. Like other users I doubled the topping because a butter/sugar crumble is always the best part!

I will try this recipe again, maybe next time I will add some blueberries with the peaches.

Like everyone else, I made it with a few changes.....yogurt instead of sour cream (that's what I had on hand), brown sugar in the topping instead of white.  The cake was moist and delicious.  Next time, I'll try it with the sour cream and will definitely double the topping.  What a wonderful cake.  Will defniitely make it again!

This was great.  I wouldn't change a thing. Everyone loved it, and it's a great way to use fresh peaches.  Mine were really juicy, so I blotted them off just a little bit with a paper towel before I put them on top of the batter.

Very, very good.  The batter smells (and tastes!) so good when you're mixing it.  It took a little longer than 45 minutes for it to bake up for me, but otherwise this was a tasty and easy way to use the peaches from my freezer.

This was good and I would make it again. the only reason it was rated 4 instead of 5 has nothing to do with the recipe. Instead of vanilla extract my helper put in almond extract and I don't like almonds. However next time I make this I will add a little brown sugar and cinnamon to the cake and not just for the topping.

This was wonderful!  All I had was fat free sour cream, which I think made the texture of the uncooked batter a little gluey, but it still worked and tasted so good I would do it the same way again.  I only baked it about 40 minutes and it was perfect - looked and tasted fabulous.  No problems with gooeyness after baking. We loved it!

Great - will make again. I doubled the batch and put it in a large pan. I used peaches from our tree that I had frozen. For the topping, I used brown sugar in place of white and I used oatmeal in place of pecans (doubled). WAS SUPER - kids and adults loved it.

I've made this three times and it's worked out well every time. I have had to cook it longer than 45 minutes, though.  Probably closer to 65 minutes using a toothpick to check doneness. 

Thr first time, I scaled back the peaches because looking at the batter, I thought there was no way it would hold together with all that moist fruit, but once baked, I realized it would have been fine! 

The next two versions, I used blueberries in one and 75%peaches/25%rhubarb in ther other because that's what i had on hand, and again, they turned out great! 

Super moist cake, great flavor and very easy to make!

Two tips:

Line pan with parchment all the way up the sides for easy transfer to serving platter. 

Use water to wet fingers to spread the batter.

I made 1/2 recipe, kept the topping at a whole recipe but changed white to brown sugar.  I used a 6"x10" Le Cruset baking dish and it filled perfectly .  I also added seedless Raspberry AllFruit, which I laid down in second level of batter .  The batter is very sticky but used an offset frosting knife and it worked pretty well . I cut my peaches very thin and just dolloped the second level of batter over them as best I could.  I then used small dollops of the raspberry followed by topping.  To prep the baking dish, I used Baker's Joy.  No problem with release .

I sprinkled a little bit of cinnamon on the layer of peaches, made double the topping and put the pecans in after I cut into the butter.  It turned out so delicious and moist.  Eating it right out of the oven is so delicious! I think next time I will add more peaches. Maybe a cup or two more.  I used fresh, juicy, sweet yellow peaches. I will definitely make this again.

I will probably make this again as it is very good. I didn’t make the layers as the dough is quite thick, just put the peaches and the streusel on top. My peaches must have been very juicy, as I had to add 20 minutes to the cook time.

It was delicious.   Baked up perfectly, it was hard to wait 45 minutes once the smells started filling the kitchen!  Will add this to my breakfast repertoire, especially for company (makes an awful lot for two people, but have no fear, i expect those 2 people will finish it off in a few days).

Made it in a bundt pan for church coffee hour.  People loved it.  I used 3 cups of peaches.   I also put a glaze of 2 cups of powdered sugar and 2 -3 tablespoons of milk on the top. Just before serving I sliced a fresh peach into the center of the cake.  Beautiful!

This recipe was sooo good!  We liked it warm but the coffee cake was even better when put in the refrigerator and eaten cold with whipped cream on top!
What a wonderful way to use your peaches when they are in season!

This recipe has great potential. I used an airbake pan rather than a glass, and I should have added at least 5 min baking time. As it was, things came out a bit doughy in the middle. I would also double the streusel topping and go a lot more heavy-handed on the pecans next time.

Other than that, this had a great flavor for a classic sour cream coffee cake and the peaches in the center made for a nice twist. 

pro tip: to peel peaches, place them in boiling water for 10-20 seconds, then remove them to an ice bath. You can be practically peel the skins off with your thumb that way (but the paring knife will really get the job done fast!)

Excellent cake. Batter is very stuff and I had to pat it into place with a butter knife to cover the whole bottom of the pan. For the top layer, I blobbed the batter atop the peaches and tried to connect it, but it was too stiff. Still, once baked, the batter distributed itself evenly.

Ingredient changes: I added 1 tsp. each of nutmeg and cinnamon to topping. Doubled topping. Used 3/4 cup full-fat Greek yogurt plus 1/4 cup sour cream rather than all sour cream (using up what I had in the fridge, not because I have any objections to sour cream!)

Cooking time: my cake took 1.5 hours to bake. Maybe because my peaches were very fresh and juicy?

A very good coffee cake, using frozen peaches worked beautifully.  If you want the cake to come out of the pan neatly I recommend lining it with parchment paper.  This allowed me to cut perfectly neat pieces on a cutting board.  I made double the crumb topping and was grateful that I did.

turned out simply amazing ! altho instead of fresh peaches i used an equal amount of canned peaches ( harvested from our trees). if you use canned peaches with this recipe be sure to drain off all the syrup otherwise add another 5 mins to baking time

This was fabulous!! Super moist and flavorful! I followed the recipe as it was written. Only change I made was baking it in 3 small loaf pans. So I can give one to my brother since he gave me the peaches.

It was very good.  I used homegrown peaches and full fat sour cream because that was all the store had.  I also added a little cinnamon/sugar to the peaches before folding in.  I had little batter left over for the top, but it was necessary so the crumb topping would have a surface.  My crumb topping didn't turn out well - probably the temperature of the butter.

  I will make it again since we have plenty of peaches, but next time I'll use lowfat greek yogurt in place of the sour cream, and add even more cinnamon to the peaches layer and the topping, since I love that about coffee cake.  I also will try no butter in the topping and just sprinkle on cinnamon sugar for the topping like regular coffee cake.

This cake was moist and delicious...I used 2 loaf pans and they turned out perfectly.  I also used canned peaches because that's what I already had on hand, just make sure they are completely drained. Will make again!

This was AMAZING! I can't believe it turned out so well considering I made many changes....

My mother in law is lactose intolerant so I made this using dairy free, vegan "sour cream" and earth balance margarine in place of butter.  I did use the two eggs so I'm not sure how it would turn out if you did some kind of egg replacer to make it truly vegan.  I also reduced the sugar by half since my husband and mother in law prefer baked goods that are a bit less sweet.  I baked it at 320 degrees instead of 325 because my oven seems to run hot.  I did not have any pecans so I used slivered almonds instead.  I let it cool for a couple of hours....came out just perfect!  Sweetness level was great even with the reduction of sugar.   Would definitely recommend this recipe to others.  Not sure how it will taste in the morning since it won't be fresh from the oven.

Thank you for a great recipe.  I love it's simplicity and it is one of the best fruit cakes I tried.. When I read it I thought (and still think) that there is a typo on the amount of flour needed for the dough.  I used 1 1/4cups flour as the 1/4 cup seemed way too little.   I too used plain yougourt instead of sour cream and made it with fresh nectarines cubed but not peeled (I don't have time for peeling peaches).  It turned out great..Can anyone please advise on the flour for the dough? Has anyone used only the 1/4cup?  How did it turn out?

Are we sure there is only a 1/2 cup of flour in the batter?   My batter wasn't sticky, but runny.  The best part of the thing was the peaches, and most thought they would prefer pie or shortcake.

I only had 3 cups of peaches so I added 1 cup of sliced strawberries...we thought it was excellent. Definitely plan on making it again though I will use freshly picked apples instead of peaches next time.

Really good. I was looking for a coffee cake when I came across this recipe. I didn't have peaches so I used canned pears. I think you can use just about any fruit for this cake. I halved the recipe because I was making it just for my immediate family. It disappeared quickly. Definitely a repeater.

Delicious, light, coffee cake!  Instead of sour cream I used half plain Greek yogurt and half vanilla-flavored yogurt.  I also used brown sugar in the topping which definitely needs to be doubled.  I did not and wish I had.  My cake came out very fluffy, airy, and not real sweet.  It was perfect for me.  For those who like a sweeter cake, I would add more sugar.  I layered the batter with the peaches in the middle as the recipe states and that's the way to go. It looks beautiful when done.  Also, I made a half batch of this and cooked it in a 9" square pan.  That was the perfect size.  I will definitely make this again.

Turned out super great!  After reading one comment about it lacking flavor, I added cinnamon over the peaches before covering with the rest of the batter - PERFECT!

I have decided to bake because I had several peaches left from my homemade iced tea. This Cake seemed easy to bake and it is indeed! As I said I used peaches soaked in black tea with mint. I didn't use any kind of nuts  but instead I put just cinammon and nutmeg on the top and on the peach layer. I baked it more then 45min and I think it would deserve even more but anyway the cake was delicious and fine!! I recommend drinking Arabic coffee with.

Made this tonight and it was SUCH a hit. Moist, but fluffy. The only addition I made to the original batter was the addition of a teaspoon of cinnamon, because others had said it was bland. I didn't peel the peaches and it was fine. I spread the batter in the pan and put the peaches on top, rather than try to split it up and do it in layers - and I also doubled the topping per another reviewers suggestion. This could be lightened I'm sure, but we went with the full on calorie bomb version and were very happy. :)

Five star all the way. Did not have sour cream so I used an 8 oz. container of mascarpone cheese. I also made up a maple cream sauce which I added to each piece of cake as needed. Awesome addition. I poured 1 1/2 cups of heavy cream into a saucepan. Added 5 tablespoons of maple syrup, and 3 tablespoons of light corn syrup over monderate heat till thickened and reduced by about 1/3, about 15 minutes. Refrigerate the sauce till cold and thick. When ready to serve over cake, either let it come to room temp. or microwave it for a few seconds. Yummy!!!

Loved the recipe!  The cake is so moist, and the sour cream gives it a great flavor.  I cut down on the amount of peaches, to 2 large peaches, then added 1/2  qt. of fresh raspberries.  It was so yummy.  I also have done the same with blueberries, and it's a crowd pleaser as well.  I would imagine it would be great with all sorts of fresh fruit combinations.  Will definitely be making this one again!

I agree with naples34102; put batter in pan and topped with peaches and streudel.  Barely any crumbs left after church breakfast.

I have made this recipe a few times, huge fan of anything peach. Yes its a bit fussy trying to spread the second layer in particular. Patience with this recipe is needed,  but its so worth it. 
Its always light and moist and not overally sweet.
I think I will try it with the non fat yougart next time.
It's a HUGE hit at my girls annual cottage weekend. Morning tea and peach coffee cake. PERFECT.

Thought this was fantastic! Better the next day! I only had about half the amount of peaches called for, so I halved the recipe and put it in a smaller pan- 8x8. Will definitely make it again.

We run a B&B and this recipe was a big hit with our guests all season, they even asked for extra pieces to take on their hikes.  A real keeper

Wow, without a doubt the best peach dessert I've ever eaten!! I did, however, substitute vanilla yogurt for the sour cream. Next time I would make 1/2 again of the topping, only breaking the pecans, not grinding. Expect to dollop the second layer of batter, and expect it to look sparse! It'll be perfect. Had to bake it 55 minutes..I think it depends a lot on how juicy your fresh peaches are. Wonderful recipe!!

Hmm, even though I think my recipe flopped on me and turned into something gooey but it was still pretty  good but 4 stars just cause it didn't really match what I thought it would have been

This recipe turned out excellent. I had very ripe peaches and nectarines, two of each, so I made half the recipe (except for the topping, I used the full recipe for that) and put it in an eight-inch square pan. The cake was tender and moist, the peach layer was perfect and the topping added crunchy texture and a more intense sweetness. Outstanding!

This is a wonderful,moist cake that is not too sweet but tender & light.  The fresh peaches between the layers provided just the right sweetness, & the streusal-like topping was perfect! This recipe is a "keeper" to be enjoyed & shared often whenever fresh peaches are in season.

Thank you for sharing this easy and delicious recipe! I added an extra tsp of vanilla extract and substituted homemade plain yogurt for sour cream. I used frozen peaches thawed overnight and strained to remove excess juices. Leftovers are great for breakfast.

This one is a keeper! I used egg substitute and measured for 3 eggs instead of 2. Like another reviewer I also used plain yogurt instead of sour cream.  Also only used 3/4 cup sugar in the batter. Cake turned out very soft and plenty sweet.  Yummy!

I made this cake with one can of peaches in juice, which was all I had.   By mistake, instead of mixing the pecans , peaches, and butter, I first poured on the butter, than the peaches, and then topped with nuts.  This recipe actually worked splendidly, though next time I will follow the recipe more closely.  I think canned peaches though work just fine.  Here in AZ, it is hard to find good quality peaches.

Loved it! my first time attempting to make it and it turned out. I think I overdid the topping a little, reading the reviews on making more lead me to over compensate. It still turned out great and the kids liked it to. I am ready to make more coffee cake.

I was worried that about the batter being insufficient, but it turned out well.  I did not notice it being gooey at all.  It is probably the amount of peaches used, since I only used about 3 cups.  The leftovers I placed right in the Fridge and I enjoyed it the second day as well.  I will make more topping for next time.

enjoyed this recipe.  I read the other reviews first.  I had no trouble with it being gooey.  I would probably double the topping next time.
