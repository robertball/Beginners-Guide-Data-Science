Absolutely delicious! I took the advice from another review and used lettuce instead of cabbage, and fruity (mango) salsa instead of regular salsa. The sweet and spicy went so well together. It was very flavorful. I omitted the cheese for a fresher taste. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a fiesta in the mouth.

Healthy fish tacos that got raves at my birthday barbecue. I was distracted when I was making the recipe and ended up mixing the spices with the lime juice, so I basted the fish with it before cooking and it was still fantastic! I reduced the salt by half and only used a quarter of the black pepper, omitted the cheese and used lettuce and the salsa from the "Fiery Fish Tacos with Crunchy Corn Salsa." Yogurt dressing was stunning with Sriracha sauce. This recipe makes A LOT!

I am not a fan of fish tacos, but my husband is so I decided to make these for him. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!! The sauce is amazing, and so easy. The sauce is definitely spicy so I did use a little more yogurt in the mixture, but this recipe is def a keeper!!

We just made this today and loved it. The yogurt sauce is the difference. We used cabbage, and it added a firm crunch, so don't be so quick to revert to lettuce. The recipe made so much, we took some to the neighbors and still have some for leftovers. There is definitely a kick, but it is flavorful without being overpowering. The cilantro and lime are delicious additions. We had flour tortillas, which were still good. There is no need for salsa. We will definitely make these again. I just created an account so I could comment on this recipe. It was great!

The taco's were absolutely AMAZING.  I usually don't use recipes with very little reviews, but the reviews were high for only 4 people that rated it.  I decided to try it since I had everything the recipe called for.  I did everything as the recipe called for, but I used olive oil to coat the talapia instead of the spray.  This was a hit for the whole family, and made them twice this week.  Thank you for the fantastic recipe.  :)

Fantastic healthy recipe for fish tacos! I broiled my fish instead of grilling about 4 minutes per side.  The sauce is very tasty with a little kick (I used fat free greek yogurt).  Overall, amazing and easy!

You are absolutely correct, rev'd up chef! Thank you for taking the time to perfect it so that I didn't have to add, subtract or substitute one thing! My children loved it. I will make one suggestion to make the tortilla heating go quicker, spritz each side of tortilla with cooking spray (I used coconut oil), place all tortillas on cookie sheet and bake for 3-5 minutes at 425 degrees. I make fish tacos often but this was the first time I used tilapia. Don't substitute anything, people!

These were absolutely delicious! The yogurt sauce is the bomb :) I actually loved the cabbage on it too. These were a great change from our usual beef tacos. Will definitely be making again. No need for salsa.

I made these twice now and they were wonderful.  The first time I used the yogurt as the recipe states and we didn't like it as much as when I used ranch dressing in it's place. I made the dressing from a mix and added quite a few peppers since we like things pretty spicy. I also cooked the fish in a skillet instead of on the grill.  With the fresh tomatoes, cabbage, onions and avacado it was really a healthy and great tasting meal!

I made this for my family of seven. I doubled the recipe and we had plenty!  When I went to start my gas grill, I realized (argh!) the gas was low, so I disappointedly cooked them on an electric non-stick griddle, and they were still great! 

The sauce was a little too liquidy for me. Next time I would strain the yogurt first to eliminate some of the whey so the sauce is thicker.

My husband grew up in San Diego, and he approved these. Even my kids ate them.

Delicious and easy. The thought of fish tacos always grossed me out, but the citrus yogurt sauce made them so much better than I imagined. Thanks!

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for.  I used fresh amberjack from our farmers'  market instead of tilapia and accidentally omitted the green onions.  I made some fresh pico de gallo to serve on top of the tacos.  And I don't care for store-bought corn tortillas, so I used a whole-wheat and corn blend tortilla made by Mission.  The fish and yogurt sauce were delicious and I will definitely make them again!

Yes please. Fantastic, even with no grill (and I wouldn't grill Tilapia anyway -- too delicate and it would just fall into my grill). Try topping your fish tacos with some pickled red onions. You're welcome. But even exactly as is, this recipe nails it.

This was absolutely delicious! The only change I made, was that I added a little sugar to the sauce. Full-fat yogurt is the only way to go.

This was edible, but nothing I will make again. I followed the directions exactly for the sauce and it was bland. I added green onions, garlic salt and paprika and that made it a little better. We just felt like something was missing. I feel like the fish tacos at restaurants are a little sweeter. Maybe I'll try with peach or mango salsa next time.

We really enjoyed this recipe but made a few changes.  I used red snapper instead of tilapia and fried on stove (will grill next time).  For the sauce, I used mayo (didn't have yogurt) and  dried cilantro. I used lettuce instead of cabbage and no cheese.  Will make again.

This is a great all around fish taco. The adobo sauce was awesome and spicy.  I followed the recipe just as listed, the only thing I would change is to step up the rub on the fish as I thought it lacked a bit of flavor.  Other reviews suggested using lettuce instead of cabbage but I love the cabbage and can't imagine a fish taco with lettuce.

This was excellent!  We love fish tacos have had several different kinds....but, these are some of the best we have had.  I made a few changes.  Used halibut--we prefer halibut on fish tacos and it is easier to grill.  Used greek yogurt and had to add about a teaspoon of powered sugar to sauce because I think the Greek yogurt and lime juice made it too tart.  I also ended up adding a cube (1t.) of minced garlic. OH MY, the hubby couldn't stop dipping his chips into the sauce.  Otherwise, prepared and used all other ingredients as listed.

LOVED IT!  The first time I made this, I pan fried the fish.  Tonight, I baked it on a cookie sheet at 400 while I warmed up the tortillas.  When the fish was done, I chopped it up and mixed it all together on the cookie sheet. That way it soaked up all the juices and spices.  The grill sounds good, I'm just not confident that all the fish wouldn't fall through the grates!

Terrific tacos!  Didn't make any changes since it was my first time trying it and it didn't need any. Wasn't so sure about the sauce while making it  .... but it was perfect on the fish.  Ohhh. I did make a change.  We don't eat tilapia so I used cod. Very good fish taco!

I love these fish tacos!  I used cod filets instead of tilapia but followed everything else spot on. I can't get enough of the sauce.  And for those who count points, the only real points in this recipe are from the taco shells.

Made some changes and simplified it, but it came out great. Used rockfish (had to be careful of bones, but that was on sale).
Had no chipotle adobo sauce, so used my home made taco seasoning instead.
Loved the red cabbage, but ended up with too much for 2 servings. Always a challenge to reduce recipes down to two servings. 
This will be a go-to in the future as we have fish tacos frequently.

I've been searching for a fish taco recipe that will satisfy my need for abundant flavor as well as pass the test for the picky eaters in my house (everyone else) - this was the one.  I made some minor alterations: roasted red peppers in lieu of chipotle, I also cut the fish into long strips then skewered before grilling (this made handling on the grill easier and they also slid perfectly onto the tortilla during assembly.  I would give this recipe an extra star if I could.

There was something about the tilapia and the yogurt sauce combo that jet didn't do it for me. Next time I'll try using tuna instead of tilapia- the tilapia is too tender to grill. I may add ground cayenne or New Mexico chile to the seasonings that go directly on the fish and leave the chipotle out of the yogurt sauce, upping the amount of cilantro instead.

I thought this sauce would be great from all the reviews. Evidently they are big fans of the smokey flavor of the aboreo sauce. Not us. Could not get past the smokey smell. I mixed it up and even tried it. Ate the tacos with homemade pico de gallo.

These are the most amazing fish tacos I've ever had! I actually don't even like any type of sea food what so ever but my mother made these for dinner one night while I was over and now it's a weekly must have in my house. My boyfriend and I just can't get enough of them!! The only thing that I did differently is I lightly dusted/sprinkled (not dipped) some flour/bread crumb mixture on the fish after I seasoned them and fried them on very high heat just until both sides are a light golden brown (about 1-2 minutes on each side) but make sure not to over cook them. And you MUST add all the toppings!!!! The first time I tried it I only put the sauce and cheese on but the second time I put everything and I fell in love with them all over again!! You have to try them!

We don't have a grill, but we LOVE fish tacos so I'll admit I fried mine, BUT the real star here is the sauce.  This sauce was so light, so fresh, and so out-of-this-world that I want to just eat it straight. We left the peppers out of the sauce so we could add them individually, as my husband's taste for spicy and my taste for spicy vary greatly.  So, if you're worried about the smokiness, just let everyone do what they want, pepper-wise.  That's what great about this - it's easy to do for a buffet-type dinner and everyone gets what they want!  Lovely tacos!

Amazing!  Loved it so much that we are recipe repeating in a 2 week period - unheard of at my house.  My kids found the sauce a little spicy so will make a minor adjustment on that this time.  Otherwise perfect as is!

Great sauce recipe.  Extremely simple and quick to make in the blender.  Cabbage is a nice touch.  Would be better deep fried than grilled but very healthy.

This recipe is incredible! My family thought it was better than at restaurants. The spicy yogurt sauce is so good! If i'm feeling lazy, I might just make the fish and not do the whole taco thing, as the fish was so good. I used haddock. I did everything the same except I put plain gluten-free breadcrumbs on the fish just prior to frying the filets in a little light olive oil & butter. I also put the fish in hard taco shells, since that is what my family likes. I used romaine instead of cabbage, since that is what I had on hand. My 3.5 and 1.5 year olds gobbled this up without the spicy sauce. I will be making this often!

Wow - that sauce is amazing. Yes, it makes a lot, but I went ahead and used it as a dressing over the leftover lettuce, tomato and onions - delicious!

Great!  Made these tonight.  Yummy healthy dish.  I would consider next time maybe a little less salt, but it was fine.  I used non-fat greek yogurt for the sauce and a pineapple peach salsa.  Cooked on an indoor grill and they came out perfect!  It is spicy though so adjust the chipotle appropriately based on your tastes.

My hubby is fish taco snob but he loved this. I added avocado to the sauce to make it creamier. Huge hit in my house. My 3 year old ate it all up. The hubby said it would be the best sauce he ever had if I added more peppers to make it a little more spicy but I was feeding a 3 year old. I also used red snapper since that was on sale at the fish market. Nice and meeting. YUMMY!

I've made these a few times and they are always good.  Use Greek yogurt if you want a thicker sauce.  The canned pepper in adobo sauce  vary in intensity so you need to add per your taste.  I also add 1/4 tsp cumin, 1/4 tsp chili powder, 1/2 tsp Old Bay and some honey if it needs it. (From another recipe)

Very good. Made a couple of changes: grilled the fish outside instead of frying. You do not need a lot of the chipotle peppers. Would probably omit next time (so I dont waste a can) and just add pepper sauce or jalapeño pepper from my garden. We used white fish instead of tilapia because that is what we had. Worked just fine. Used white corn tortillas and left in the skillet for a little longer until semi-crisp. Make sure to turn them!  Used Greek yogurt also.

GREAT!  I knew these were a hit when my son who HATES fish asked me to make them again.  He even liked the fish with the seasoning on it all by itself.

Overall, this was an excellent recipe. There didn't seem to be enough yogurt sauce to my liking and I was out of yogurt so I added 1/4 c. sour cream and I really like the flavor this added. I served some tacos with flour tortillas and some with corn tortillas and both were very good. The cabbage gave a nice crunch. I substituted fresh pico de gallo for the tomatoes and really liked it.

The sauce was delicious. It’s a much lighter version from my other fish tacos that I coat in batter. Loved it. Will be making again. I added more chipotles in Adobe sauce for more of a kick.

Not bad but still looking for fish taco recipe that hits the mark. Recommend you try it and determine if this works for you. I do not plan to use this specific recipe again.

Start with high quality fish, add the wonderful adobo sauce, these tacos are amazing.  Have made them several times and the family raves.

My family LOVES this recipe!  And some of us don't even really like to eat fish!  The seasoning on the fish is delicious and the yogurt sauce is great (Just REALLY spicy)!  We love to pair it with some mango salsa.  It is WAYYYY better than most fish tacos I've had in all kinds of restaurants.

I didn't make the fish as in this recipe, I used Cod fillets, and used an air fryer that I'm obsessed with, BUT this sauce.. Omgosh we loved it.   So fresh tasting but with the smokey spice of the Chipotle peppers, wow.

This was really good! Don't have a gas grill, so I went 7 minutes per side on my Traeger at 350. Very moist fish! Put too much chipotle in the sauce, so had to cut it with some extra yogurt and a bit of rice vinegar.  Used the cabbage and it was awesome! Will definitely make again!

I love this recipe and will make it again. The only thing I didn't add was the jalapeños as that would of been too spivey for me. So I used mango chipotle to season the sour cream and fish. Perfect amount of kick for me. I used taco bowls as well.  Will make again!

Whole family loved the tacos, although personally I was not the biggest fan of the sauce (on the other hand my 18 month old niece wouldn't stop saying "yuum!") Making again soon, thank you for the recipe!

I made this pretty much according to the exact recipe, The only substitute I made was to use a normal white onion instead of green onions. I had them already chopped up for regular tacos. They turned out awesome, Just enough heat and a ton of different flavors and textures. I will definitely recommend and will make them many more times.

Love this recipe! I frequently make this exactly as is and the cilantro-lime sauce just really gives the fish tacos a nice flavorful kick. I use halibut instead of tilapia though. Just the luxury of being Alaskan. This recipe is fantastic with halibut, but works with any white fish I think.

I have made this recipe 3 times. It is delicious. There was one thing missing according to my son, corn.  I have used defrosted frozen sweet white corn or used a small can of drained baby yellow corn, to sprinkle on top. The three of us have always eaten every bit of it! There is never any leftovers, lol.

FANTASTIC!  I followed the recipe exactly the way it is ( other than doubling everything except fish).  The family raved about this one and I will defiantly make time and time again.  I did grill my tilapia however I think I could achieve the same results from    the stove or oven.  Like other reviewers, I too, do not think you need any salsa for this.  The adobo yogurt  dressing is more than enough and I wouldn't want to hide the taste of it.  5 stars!!

We like it spicy, so I doubled the chipotle pepper to ramp up the sauce; it tasted just like Rubio's  original fish taco sauce - yum! I seasoned the fish with cajun seasoning and skipped the cheese (fish & cheese are no bueno!).  

Simple, clean fish tacos--muy delicioso!

Delicious recipe!  I had been craving fish tacos and decided to give these a try. I halved the recipe and the only change was to use Siracha instead of the chipotles in adobo and used Greek yogurt. Next time I think I will add a bit more spice to the fish before grilling (which I had to do indoors), otherwise excellent!!

I used rockfish (Pacific snapper) and loved the way it grilled. The chipotle sauce was delicious. We enjoyed the tacos.

BRAVO! I had given up on fish tacos after many failed attempts, but these will be in the regular rotation.  Husband, 13 year old, and 10 year old loved, too!  I only gave four stars because it dirties a LOT of dishes.  Couple of notes.  Chipotle with adobo is very spicy so may want to reserve some of the sauce before adding for those who can't handle it.  Plan half a pound of fish per person; these are not very filling.  I served with refried beans on the side, which helped fill us up.

I made this for the first time and I didn't change a thing except halved the recipe and used mango salsa.  So healthy, tasty and very easy to make.  I will be making it again in a couple of days!

Very tasty and easy.  The yogurt sauce is fantastic and has just enough kick. Makes a ton - I halved the recipe and it's been enough for more than two meals for two.  I urge everyone to try mango salsa - the sweet/tangy/spicy combination is fantastic!

Loved the tacos! The spices on the fish (I used cod) were great. The shredded cabbage is a must, it adds a nice crunch. I also used a store bought tropical pico de gallo.  The only thing I didn't care for was the sauce. The flavors in it did not blend together well for me, too much lime maybe. I added a little sriracha, mayonnaise and salt and then it was ok. Otherwise, these were great and I will be keeping this recipe as a part of our dinner rotation.

So delicious! My husband and I love fish tacos and found this recipe to be one of the best we've made. We usually use cabbage but this time I used a green lettuce instead because I sometimes find that cabbage can add a bitter taste personally. The lettuce added a nice fresh crispness. We accidentally forgot the cheese but didn't even miss it! This one's a keeper for us.

great recipe! My first time making fish tacos and it was a hit with my family. Did not change much, but had a couple of hour to marinate the fish in the lime and spices and pan fried in olive oil. saved to my Recipe box for next time!

We really enjoyed these.  I didn't process the cilantro, yogurt, and adobe sauce in a blender because I am too lazy.  I just diced it up, and mixed.   I used broccoli slaw in a bag from the store for the cabbage because I was too lazy to chop some cabbage.  It took me several weeks to make this because there were a lot of steps in the process, but craving won out over lazy! Yum! In the end, it was not too long of a process to make after all.  Thanks Chef! We enjoyed them:) The only thing that would have made them better is if you would have cooked them. LOL

I just made the chipotle lime sauce portion of this recipe to go on grilled mahi mahi tacos.  I followed the sauce recipe exactly and we did NOT care for this.  Perhaps this would work with sour cream but with the plain fat free yogurt, the flavors did not meld at all.  Plus the spice level was through the roof -

This is the best fish taco recipe! I used swai fish fillets and coated them in lime juice then some blackening seasoning. I grilled them in a pan with cooking spray about 4 minutes per side. I also sprayed the corn tortillas with the cooking spray on each side before warming, which worked great to make them soft and delicious! I topped them with the adobo sauce, which is definitely the key to the recipe, and homemade salsa and cabbage. These are as close as I can get to our local restaurant's famous fish tacos which are pretty much my favorite food!

Made this last night, and my family loved it! I cooked the fish on the stove top with a little bit of avocado oil in the pan (4 min each side). I used Greek yogurt for the sauce, and I used Sprout's Artisan corn & wheat blend tortillas (they were larger). These were the best fish tacos I have ever had!

Fantastic! First time making and eating fish tacos. I much prefer these to beef. I replaced the cilantro with some chili powder, but the rest stayed the same.

Fantastic! Being that there are only two of us, I scaled this accordingly (1/2 lb. tilapia / 1 filet). With all the yummy fixins', my hubs and I were completely satisfied. The fish itself is VERY tasty and could EASILY stand on its own (it's THAT good). The sauce was a bit tangy for me tho.... I think I might sub sour cream for yogurt next time - or simply reduce the lime a bit. Because I am watching my sodium intake, I served our tacos with sliced cucumber and jicama that we dipped in guacamole. This made for a fantastic, light meal on this beautiful Midwest spring day. :) Kudos to rev'd up chef for such awesome take on the ordinary fish taco. Thanks for sharing!

Ended up pan frying on a cast iron skillet, came out great. Even the kids liked it. We also used Mahi Mahi, almost any firm white fish would work. Did not use that much of the spice mix, fearing it would be a little too spicy, but could have used more. The nice thing about the yogurt sauce is that you can add as much or as little adobo sauce and chili's to suite your taste. Will definitely make again!

We loved these tacos. My husband loves spice so we added extra chipotle to the sauce. I also made a fresh pico de gallo to serve on top. We will definitely be enjoying these for many more dinners to come.

I made fish taco's for the first time last night and chose this recipe.  I used Maui Maui which was excellent!  The sauce, everyone commented on the sauce, but I haven't read a description of the flavor of the sauce.  I like spicy, huge fan....what I'm not a huge fan of is "smokey" flavors.  This Yogurt sauce was almost overpoweringly smokey from the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce.  That being said, I still enjoyed these taco's very much!  I dribbled about a half teaspoon of sauce on my first taco, but the second got a little bit more.  I found that the avocado helped to even out that Smokey flavor for me!  Very Good.

I made these exactly as stated; I didn't care for these at all but my DH did which is why it got 3 stars and not 2. I will be going back to my other Fish Taco recipe from this site.

I thought these needed a lot more sauce and flavor. Topped with quite a bit of salsa to compensate but otherwise delicious. I'd definitely make these again.
