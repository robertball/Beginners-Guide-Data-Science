Delicious!! The better brands of ice cream make it a better shake. It does taste like cheesecake.

Bad. Bad, bad morning. I made this to feel better. I did cut it down to two servings and I added a tbsp. of instant coffee. This was nice. Thank you.

I disagree that it tastes "just like" chocolate cheesecake, but it was still good.  The cream cheese taste was subtle, which was a good thing to me because I don't think I'd like a milkshake that tasted like cheesecake.  I used chocolate frozen yogurt for the fat reduction and it was good this way.  Something different to present the guests with for a summer get-together.  Plus it was a good way to use up some leftover cream cheese.

I had some creamcheese I needed to use up and was really excited to try this and had high hopes. However, after making it a few different times I was very unimpressed. It tasted just like a chocolate milkshake. I couldn't taste the cream cheese at all, even when I doubled up on the cream cheese the 2nd time making it. I feel it just added all the calories and fat to my shake without changing the flavor. I used a Premium Chocolate Icecream...maybe that was the problem? Maybe a cheaper chocolate would be better, but I'm not sure. I don't think I'll be making it again to test it.

This is delicious! I liked it better thicker when I used only 1 cup of milk. (And it still wasn't very thick; you can easily sip it through a straw.) I think I'll definitely try this with non-fat cream cheese and with different types of ice cream sometime! Awesome!
2nd time: low fat cappuccino chip ice cream with 1/3 less fat cream cheese and skim milk tastes great!!
3rd time: Adding choc chips is useless, they sink to the bottom of the blender and glass.

My wife and I think that this is indeed an easy to make and delicious recipe.  However, there is no WOW factor or kick, so we're going to go with MILD.

I am one of those annoying people who looked at a few different recipes to find a combination of things I liked best. I rate this 5 stars because the idea of adding cream cheese is genius! I basically used 7 scoops of Breyers Vanilla ice cream (it is what I had) with only 1 cup of milk (per other reviews), a 1/2 cup of chocolate syrup, 1 cup of leftover coffee and some cinnamon. I also used 4 oz. of cream cheese. I would like the final product a bit thicker, but the taste was fantastic for me. Thank you for the cream cheese idea! I just happen to be a coffee lover as well.

This was good the first time I made it, but I thought the "cheesecake" taste was lacking.  The second time I made it I added 3/4 of the 8 oz package of cream cheese and it came out yummy!

Good recipe. I added some crushed graham crackers to it and it was completely cheesecake-ified. Also please note that a new word has been invented. Cheesecake-ified N. - To make something taste more like cheesecake to the point of perfection.

This had an odd taste, like drinking milk and cream cheese. Maybe because I only had three scoops of ice cream, but I cut down on the milk and cream cheese to make up for the lack of ice cream. This didn't taste like a cheesecake to me at all.
