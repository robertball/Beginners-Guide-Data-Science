We enjoyed this and were happy that it was low in sodium!!! For low salt it is as good as it gets.

I made this last night and found it so/so. I found the cooking time too long, maybe it would be okay if the steak was a very thick cut. By the time I served it, it resembled shredded beef. I also had to add a lot more liquid when adding the flour as it turned way too thick. The flavour was okay- it did disguise the "livery" taste of the round steak. All in all it really is just a stew without any vegetables with some kick. I did like the flavor of the horseradish, however.

Excellent dish. Made it with cube steak and served it over rice. We will be making this again.

This was really good.  It almost killed the taste of the round steak!  I used jalapenos for the peppers and served it on rice.  Next time if I cut the steak smaller it may actually finally kill the liver flavor.  Yahoo!
