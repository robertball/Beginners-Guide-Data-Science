The taste was good enough, and the preparation was simple and fast.  I had all the ingredients on hand. That's what I logged in for. I simply don't understand people who rate a recipe and then change everything. You might as well call it your own and post it.

Good, but I made many changes to it to ensure it didn't come out bland. Coated the chicken with thyme, salt, pepper and garlic powder. Used a 9x12 glass baking dish, mixed together 1 can cream of mushroom soup, 1 can cream of chicken with added cayenne, then poured on top. Then added a layer of extra sharp shredded cheddar before topping the with stuffing mix, more garlic powder, and black pepper. Baked for 45 minutes (the breasts were very thick), came out perfect!

So easy and so good.  I used the roasted garlic mushroom soup (like another reviewer suggested) and just because it tastes SO MUCH BETTER.  Will definately make again (when need dinner idea and just don't have the time to make it.) Thanks for the post.

This recipe is so fast to put together even though I decided to dip my chicken into egg and seasoned flour and saute until just golden. I just felt the chicken needed a little pizazz. I used roasted garlic mushroom soup which has a lot more flavor than the regular. Next time I'll try this with boneless pork chops. Thank you Allison!

This is a wonderful recipes with lots of flavor.  The only change I made was after pouring the soup over the chicken, I crumbled up French's fried onions and put over the top.  Then I added the stuffing. I did grate up some cheddar cheese and sprinkled it on top at the end!!!  Way yummy!!!!

Excellent!  My whole family loved this.  I used cream of celery instead of cream of mushroom...still excellent.

This really was easy. I cut the chicken breast into chunks and sauteed it, and then stirred the whole lot together and baked it. I did leave out the water and used two cans of soup (one of cream of celery) and added more milk. Everyone ate, but no raves. Husband asked if I was in a rush to fix dinner - not the best compliment. I'll save this for "30 min. dinner nights."

I made this for 30 people and it was still easy! I used fewer chicken breasts (the ones I had were huge) and because I was worried it wouldn't cook through on time I cut them in half along the width while they were still partially frozen - WAY faster than pounding thin. They came out tender and tasted great.  My only complaint is that there wasn't enough stuffing.

This recipe is really yummy. The only thing I did extra was season the chicken with some garlic and pepper. I did double the recipe and used chicken thighs instead, but everyone in the house just raved about it, and it was simple and easy!

This is a great recipe but the chicken needs a little more seasoning for it to really be great.  I added some s&p, thyme, paprika, and garlic powder and that seemed to be a nice combo.  Also, I'm not sure you NEED to add the 1/3c. milk... ours came out just slightly runny and probably would have been fine without it.  Probably a matter of personal preference.  Lastly, took the advice of some others and sprinkled some sharp cheddar cheese on top the last few minutes of baking.  But the chicken came out moist and delicious, and I will definitely make this again!

S.O. made this for dinner and followed recipe to the letter. It was really good, just the thing to come home to after a cold winter walk. But we did find it a little bland, so next time we'll be experimenting with spices.

This reminds me of a recipe my mom used to make.  I suggest sauteeing some celery, onions, and Jimmy Dean sausage and adding as the bottom layer for more flavor.

This recipe is good for what it is, a quick and easy meal. I liked that I had all the ingredients on hand (except milk).  I was concerned about not having enough flavor so I did flavor the chicken with onion powder, garlic salt, celery salt and s/p. Not sure how much it did but it sure wasn't bland. I backed muy chicken for about 40 minutes and I used boned thighs. You also don't need exactly a quarter cup of butter as I was a tablespoon or so shy and it was still good. You could probably get away with just chicken, stuffing, soup and water with some seasoning. I used traditional sage stove top stuffing.

I just made this for lunch and it's AMAZING. I did what other members mentioned and mixed the soup and stuffing together. It comes out moist and delicious. I had to cook it a bit longer but it worked well. :) And about it being bland, heck no! I added a little more seasoning to my stuffing..some salt and basil. Go with your gut. :)

This dish was great! I was able to use ingredients that I had in the cabinet. In addition it was a quick meal which was a huge bonus. Afer reading the reviews, I decided to cut back slightly on the milk and water. I seasoned the chicken using poultry seasoning, salt and pepper and a hint of garlic powder. It came out great! The stuffing was not mushy at all. Great dish! Thanks Allison, I will make this again, it was a huge hit for my picky 5 year old and my husband!

This is a really good quick dish. Ive made it twice and both times it was eaten all up. Its a little on the salty side so I used low sodium soup and that helped.

This was good. My husband loved this dish.  I used the stove top stuffing on top and pan fried the chicken breast with seasoned flour as suggested to lock in the flavor.  Came out great!  Hubby had the left overs the next day.

For such an easy recipe this turned out to be really good. I used a cornbread stuffing mix (which had no seasoning packet) and subbed chicken broth for the water. Seasoned the chicken well with garlic powder, pepper and paprika and drizzled extra butter over my stuffing before baking. Husband loved this and thanks, Allison.

Really liked this recipe for a weeknight meal.  Quick and easy and delicious = can't get better than that.  I used cream of celery just because I can't stand mushrooms.

This was very good and easy to make. I used cream of chicken soup in place of the cream of mushroom.

we thought this was yummy...the only thing i did differently was add some cooked broccoli to the bottom of the pan and season the chicken with garlic powder, celery salt, pepper & onion powder as well as the milk/soup mixture. delicious :)

Very tasty!  I just made a couple small changes - used boneless pork chops I had in the freezer, used Cream of Asparagus soup (husband doesn't like mushrooms), and added some French Fried Onions.  Everyone loved it!

I use a soup can full of chardonnay wine, and put jarlsburg (or swiss) over the chicken and under the stuffing mix before I bake it.  Wonderful over rice!

We really liked this.  As others suggested, I seasoned the chicken with pepper and garlic powder.  And since I needed to use up some onion and mushrooms, I sliced and added them between the soup and stuffing.  My only issue is that is seemed a little more liquidy than what I had expected (creamy).  Any idea why?  It was still delicious.

Sprinkled Pepper and Garlic on the Chicken Breasts and subbed Cream of Chicken for Mushroom - Everything else was exactly done as listed.  Will make this again.  Quick & Easy.  Next time more spices will be added to the chicken. (Maybe Shake-n-Bake)  Kids: 7,10,16 plus myself all enjoyed this dish.

I think this rocks! I think it is awesome, as is, but I did throw in some fresh sliced mushrooms and let me say, it just REALLY took it up a notch. but really, it is GREAT without them, too. I suggest getting a stuffing mix with lots of seasoning, I bought Stove Top chicken flavored stuffing and it added plenty of flavor. YUM! This is a keeper for sure!!

This was way better than I thought it would be.  I used a lb. of chicken tenders, sprinkled seasoned salt on them and topped with some shredded Swiss.  Other than that I followed the recipe exact.  It was delicious.

This recipe was so simple and tasted good.  The only thing I changed was adding some seasoning to the chicken and I would have preferred more stuffing. I will definitely make this again.

I made a few simple additions to this recipe: sprinkle the chicken breasts with an italian seasoning, top with shredded Cheddar cheese, and then the soup mixture.  This was a quick and easy meal for the weeknight.  Thanks!

We enjoyed this dish. Nothing fancy but who needs it to be. It was wonderful comfort food and so easy to make. All I had to do was make a side vegetable. I did season the chicken so it would have more "umph" and the dish itself can be enhanced if you prefer. The stuffing soaked with the cream of mushroom soup was my favorite part. I would make this again. Very easy weeknight meal.

Great and easy go-to chicken dish to fix with veggies. Didn't have any Cream of Mushroom, so I used Cream of Chicken and a small can of mushrooms with the milk. Creamy and tasty- will definitely make this again!

I have been making this since college and always used white wine instead of milk and can substitute cream of chicken soup for the cream of mushroom.  It has much better flavor in my opinion.

This was really good and really easy to make.  I used cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom because of my picky children and it was still great.  I think my chicken must have been a little thicker than normal because I had to bake mine 60 minutes.  My whole family really loved this, even my picky 5 year old.  It is a definite keeper.  Thank you for a great recipe!

This was a great recipe!!! Keep everything the same. I did not have the stuffing that it called for but i did have a box of stove top sage flavored, that had the seasoning already mixed in and it worked out great. But i will fallow it to a tee next time.

it was super easy, but it was really bland. i even used the roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup as suggested by some other members. even after i added some salt & pepper it was bland, and my stuffing got soggy as well.

My friend brought this dish over a couple of years ago and it was so good. Easy too. Sometimes she puts mozzarella cheese on top of the chicken under the stuffing. Mine never came out as good as hers so I was glad to finally find it listed here. Adding the water and butter to the stuffing is what I was missing. Thanks!

This was incredible. I made this last night with a few changes. But I won't post those changes because they were minor and I hate when people do that. Anywho my husband loved it. My teenage boys like it also. My husband ate the last piece [out of eight pieces] for lunch today. I will be making this again. Thanks for posting this simple yet tasteful recipe.

We really liked this one and it's so easy. Great flavor and all the ingredients were at home!  I cooked brown rice and served it on the side but we ended up mixing it in with everything else once we dished up.  Good with fresh asparagus.  YUMMY!

My family raved about this! My 14 yo son who doesn't normally like chicken, loved it & my husband said it was "definitely a keeper, at least once a month!" I did season the chicken with poultry seasoning, curry & salt & pepper but otherwise followed the recipe.

This was pretty good.  It reminded me of a recipe that you might find on a Campbell's soup can - this is not a bad thing, just an observation.  :)  I think the chicken needed a little more flavor, because once the soup and stuffing aren't on top of it it is pretty bland.  So maybe if it was seasoned before baking it would help.  No problems with the recipe though.  Thanks!

This was okay.  I didn't have cream of mushroom soup, so I used cream of chicken, so maybe that was it.  I will probably not make this again.

I was quite surprised by this one. It actually was pretty yummy and the kids ate it. Used canned chicken as a timesaver and two cans of soup instead of just one. Doctored it up with additional spices like poultry seasoning and celery seed. Not that attractive to look at but it tasted good.

I was disappointed with this recipe.  I added a few of my own spices and it still came out bland, and the stuffing came out very dry.  I won't be making this again.

I like to add a thick slice of swiss cheese on top of each breast and cover with the prepared dressing then bake, the cheese melts and adds a nice flavor and keeps the chicken more moist.Easy basic chicken and stuffing-good with steamed brocolli.

Ok but soooo much better done this way...

Put the chicken in the baking dish.  Top with sliced swiss cheese.  Mix a can of cream of mushroom soup with about 1/4 cup of milk, pour that on top of the cheese layer.  Pour the stuffing mix on top.  Then put some parmesan cheese on top.  Put a little melted butter on top and bake.  Super flavorful and yummy.  Been doing this recipe for decades now and everyone loves it.

I'm not sure where I went wrong with this one.  Made as written with the exception of using boneless pork chops instead of chicken breast, which other reviewers have done with apparent success.  Mine was a mushy, raw, gray disaster after 45 minutes in the oven.  Maybe the size of the pan I used?  I probably will not try this one again.

I used the left overs from my Roasted Chicken I served the night before.  I tore off small pieces from the already cooked chicken and layered it on the bottom.  I mixed the mushroom soup with the milk and spread over the chicken and then topped with the dressing.  I only had to bake it until the dressing was crunchy and brown on top and the chicken was hot at the bottom ( about 20 minutes).  A great way to use left over chicken.

This dish was easy to prepare, but it was pretty bad when completed.  The chicken wasn't cooked all the way through.  (So, I had to fish it out of the mix and bake it longer.)  Also, there was very little flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly---not sure why everyone else gave it great ratings.  Hopefully, I'll have better luck with the next recipe!

i found this to be a bit on the salty side but it could be because i subbed condensed onion soup for the cream of mushroom. otherwise still very tasty and easy to make. the chicken turned out super moist!

My husband loved this and it was so easy. I added broccoli so it was really a complete one dish and didn't have to add any extra veggies on the side. I only gave it 4 stars because it was pretty salty even using low sodium stuffing and soup. We still enjoyed it! Thanks for the recipe!

I loved it, but my boyfriend didn't, so I unfortunately will not be making this again. He said it was just too dense and bland, which I think was my fault for stirring up the stuffing too much. Plus, I added a ton of vegetables, which he does not like, so that didn't help either.

I've made this recipe as directed, and really like it. But I recently found out that my daughter has a dairy allergy. So I made a non-dairy cream of mushroom soup. I also had some leftover pork in the fridge, so used that instead of the chicken. It came out pretty good, but I'm going to have to get use to the taste of non-dairy soup :(.

Delicious, and EASY. Per others' suggestions, I mixed the prepared stuffing with the soup and milk, then put it on top of the chicken before baking.

I add frozen peas to the casserole. They taste very good mixed with the soup, and is a way to get kids to eat their vegetables. I have made this many times, always get rave reviews. Every bit is eaten up each time.

Delicious!  I didn't have chicken flavored stuffing so I used savory herbs instead and it came out excellent!  I'll use chicken flavored stuffing next time and may season or marinate the chicken beforehand for extra flavor though the stuffing and soup mix provide a lot of flavor on their own.  Quick, easy and made with items from the pantry; can you ask for anything more?

We all liked this dish. I seasoned the chicken breasts with salt and pepper and topped with about 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese the last 10 min. Yum-yum!!

This is a great recipe! I used pork chops instead of chicken breast and it turned out awesome. I plan on trying it with chicken breast soon though.

I used cream of potato soup instead of cream of mushroom and added fresh zucchini and cauliflower.  I thought it might be too soupy/runny, but it was perfect.  Delicious!

Good for a quick and easy meal. I added jarred mushrooms and seasoned the chicken first with poultry seasoning, onion powder, and sage. It turned out a little runny, so next time I will use less milk.

Good, easy and tastes great with a side of cranberry sauce.  I like using the roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup as others have recommended to give a little extra flavor.  I've made this with chicken breasts, turkey breasts and pork chops.  A great winter comfort food kind of meal.

OK I followed the recipe but instead of the soup and milk I used chicken gravy. I recommend seasoning the chicken or even marinating it because it was a bit bland, other than that it was quick and easy. Maybe using the soup would give it more flavor??

Pretty good stuff.  My husband and Mother in Law both thought it was great.  I did take one rater's advice and dipped the chicken breasts in egg and covered with flour (seasoned), only sauteed to golden brown.  Thanks!

This was absolutely fantastic!  It was tasty and juicy, with crunchy stuffing. It is also extremely easy to make.  The only thing missing is a vegetable. I think that next time I will try dicing some butternut squash and mixing it with the stuffing. I think I will also try some kid-friendly vegetables, like peas, carrots and/or corn. Great recipe.

When I made this recipe, I didn't have any chicken stuffing, I only had turkey. It still came out very good!! If you like your stuffing crunchy, I wouldn't add as much milk and soup. Next time I make it, I will probably add some mozerella. Great recipe if you are in a hurry. Thanks for the recipe, Allison!

Very good.  I used what I had on hand which was chicken legs, cornbread stuffing and cream of chicken soup.  I had to bake a lot longer since I used legs but the outcome was very good and liked by all.  Thanks Allison

This recipe is great when you want something quick.  I added 1/2 a cup of sour cream and only 3 tablespoons of milk to the soup and sprinkled pepper and garlic powder on the chicken before pouring the soup mixture on.  Also I put the stuffing mixture only on the sides as when a friend made this it was soggy on the top.  It is a recipe my family will use over again many times.

I thought this was really great. Just what I was looking for. I added a little poultry seasoning to the chicken before putting it in the baking dish. I assembled mine a little differently than the recipe said--stuffing, then chicken, then soup on top. The stuffing came out a little soggy, so I think next time I will add a little less water. Otherwise, it was great, and for how easy it was, I have to give it five stars. Rarely is recipe both fast AND delicious. Thanks!

This recipe is very quick and easy!I added some onion and celery to the stuffing, also I use low fat mushroom soup, and yogurt spread instead of margarine. Very good!

Quick and easy. Enjoyed by all. Husband described it as “chicken pot pie on crack” Used chicken drumsticks to keep it cheap. Next time will serve over rice to make it go farther.

I will definitely make this again, but add another box of the stuffing.  It wasn't near enough, but we like stuffing in our household!  I also used an additional can of cream of celery soup instead of so much water.

I always read the reviews to see tweaks and/or changes in cook times, etc.  I made this recipe exactly as noted, with the exception of Cream of Mushroom soup with garlic, instead of plain.  I did put pepper and paprika on the chicken before topping with the soup/milk combo.  It's presentation isn't real pretty, but my daughter loved it.  This was an easy, fast and delicious recipe!

Family found the original recipe to be just "ok", but it was too bland.  I made it tonight ,seasoned chicken with sea salt, cracked pepper and paprika.  As for soup, I stepped it up to Cheesy Broccoli soup.  My three female Scorpios really enjoyed this version.   I appreciate the original recipe, but every families tastes vary.  I'm happy people post their changes, it's easier than looking at a similar recipes.

Made this tonight with Cranberry uncle Ben's stuffing mix and cream of celery soup as when I went to the pantry I was out of cream of mushroom. Served it with corn and garlic mashed. My husband had 2 huge servings. My 5 year old LOVED it and so did my 1 year old! Then my parents came over and cleaned up the rest and loved it too! I baked it about 50 minutes and it was perfect

In an iron skillet I sauteed the chicken with onion in oil, then shredded it.  Added a can of peas, cream of chicken soup and 1/3 cup mayonnaise, S&P.  Prepared the stuffing with 1 1/2 cup water and 2 chicken bouillon cubes + 1/2 stick butter.  Put stuffing on top of chicken mixture and baked 10-15 minutes.

I fixed this tonight.  I did season the chicken, garlic seasoning, pepper and a little salt.  I did not use milk, instead used dry white wine.  I also used chicken tenders and it was done in about 30 minutes. I I would fix this again

This recipe was fairly easy to make despite a few additions I made for user preference. I layered the bottom of a 13x9 with fresh mushrooms before I added the chicken. Then I layered some Parmesan cheese on top of that. Instead of water for the stuffing, I used chicken broth. I added a little extra milk as well so the sauce would pour over the chicken better. Also had to cook it much longer because I had 5 chicken breasts that were partially frozen and had added the mushrooms. Turned out great though. I kept the foil over the dish until the last 10 minutes or so.

This was so easy and yet tasted fabulous!  I used boneless/skinless chicken thighs and it was terrific.  The only complaint was there was too much liquid for the amount of stuffing.  Maybe I'll use a larger box of stuffing next time, or omit the milk.

Very good and SO easy!  My husband isn't a huge chicken fan (we raise cattle) but I am. So, he has to deal with chicken of some sort through the week.  He even raved about this meal so I know it's a keeper.  Thank you!

It was simple preparation and tasted great! An excellent way to use up left over stuffing. :) The chicken could use some spicing up but for the simplicity of the meal I'll take it--definitely a keeper! I'll have to try it with pork sometime...

Great recipe - I added garlic to the mushroom soup and fresh mushrooms to it. I had the kind of stuffing that already has the seasoning in it so that was different but worked just fine.  My whole family (kids ages 6,4 and 2) all loved it. It's a make again for sure!

Was perfect supper on a cold and rainy night. Good and hearty. I used cream of chicken soup (didn't have mushroom) and turned out de-lish. I served this with mashed potatoes and glazed carrots with some crusty bread. Thanks, Allison.

It was quick and easy.  I think next time I may melt some cheese over the chicken for more flavor.
