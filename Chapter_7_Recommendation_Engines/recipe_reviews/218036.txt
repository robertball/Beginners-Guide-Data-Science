Throw in a can of enchilada sauce, olives, and chopped onions and a lot more cheddar and you have a great meal I have been making for over 20years.  It's great!

I just made this for the first time and my husband and I loved it. I didn't like the green chilie idea though so instead I used green pepper, onion, and black olives to make it more Mexican. I also used enough cheese to cover each layer. Next time my husband said I should top it off with salsa so I'll see how that adds to it.

It tasted better the next day reheated but my brood hated this :( I didnt think it tasted that bad but it was a wash. Being frugal I saved it for lunch leftovers for me and it tasted better after being doctored with spices. Thanks anyway!

My 4-year-old is a Slow, Picky eater.  We are constantly having to make sure she's eating her food because she gets easily sidetracked.
Well, I made Tortilla Surprise tonight, and she scarfed it down - and asked for more!!!  

This was a wonderful dish!  I did make a couple of alterations - I did not have chiles, so I left that out.  In its place, for the flavor, I added a layer of enchilada sauce on top of the beans.  Also, when cooking my ground turkey (healthy option), I added onion powder for an extra kick.
Yum!!!

I don't like canned soups so I substituted with reduced fat sour cream mixed with a little minced jalapeño and cumin.  I also used a little more cheese.  I stacked mine in a springform pan and garnished the top with slivers of fresh jalapeño. It looked amazing before we dove into it.

Not a bad recipe.  I added onions and used red pepper flakes instead of chiles because it was what I had...and used ground turkey instead of beef.  In the future I will add salsa/enchilada sauce, corn and olives.  I think it would also be good to use chicken slices instead of ground beef/turkey.

I added olives, more cheese, and onions. Excellent! My husband loved it! I'm   sure we will have it often.  Sour cream on top is a plus.

For an extra kick, I reduced milk by 1/2 cup and added a can of rotfl.  I also added sliced black olives.  Have already made it a second time.  Good recipe and kids loved it.
