I used crumbled Oreos instead of vanilla wafers and assembled it in a trifle bowl.  Decorated the top with small candy canes.  Very pretty on the holiday table and it tasted great too!

I was on the fence about this dessert.
It was very easy to make, the candy canes do melt and it tasted pretty good.  It was VERY sweet and gooey with the marshmallows and I chose to sprinkle some crushed up candy canes on the top and I HATED the crunchy texture in an otherwise smooth creamy textured dessert.
I would skip the candy canes on top.
This was neither the worst or the best dessert, but was worth a try!

this was okay.  I think it might be good if you it was frozen & used a real crust (this mostly stayed in the pan like crumbs do.) I may try it again if i am overloaded w/ candy canes again.

I was disappointed in this recipe.  I am a huge fan of gooey sweet desserts and there was just very little flavor to this.  I used green/red candy canes and the colors ran together to make it kindy of a muddy color. I won't try it again.

My family loves this desert.  We love to serve this frozen and top with hard shell chocolate topping.  We also leave out the nuts do to the fact not everyone is a nut fan.  Save your candycanes at christmas and make this in the summer. Its so refreshing.

This recipe was a big hit at a Christmas party.  I had problems finding chocolate wafers, so I used Paul Newman's Chocolate alphabet cookies.  They worked well.  I used mini candy canes and the flavor was perfect.  I saved a few and crushed them with the chocolate cookies on top.  I thought it could have used a little more peppermint filling to cookie ratio.

Not my favourite. I can see how the kids would like it, though.
