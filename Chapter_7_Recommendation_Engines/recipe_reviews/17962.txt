I was browsing around and came across this recipe so I decided to try it. I haven't had Mexican cornbread in ages. This was soooo good! I couldn't find just a pkg of monterey chesse so I got cheddar and monterey. Delicious! It's so easy it's scarey! I plan on taking some to work with me because if I don't I will end up eating the whole pan! 5 stars!

Very good!  It was very easy to make.  I only added half the can of green chilis and I think it could have used a dash of sugar, but it was still delicious and very moist.  I baked it in a small skillet and it took 30 min. to bake.

For those who ended up with soggy, mushy cornbread, you may have added too much cream-style corn.  The recipe calls for an 8 oz. can, which I've never seen in the stores.  I've always bought a 14 oz. can.  I used approximately half of a 14 oz. can. I also used a Jiffy corn muffin mix, which happens to weigh 8.5 oz.  I believe that this is what the recipe submitter intended since the directions mentions cornmeal mix.  I followed the directions on the back of the package (1/3 cup milk and 1 egg) and then added the corn, pepper-Jack cheese, and green chiles.  1/2 cup of milk would be too much.  No added sugar needed if using the Jiffy mix since it is plenty sweet. Moist but still able to eat with hands.

Great cornbread! I've been making a similar mexican cornbread for over 20 yrs, after seeing a recipe on your site, i realized my cornbread was LOADED w/fat & calories. We didn't miss the melted butter & sour cream that was in my old recipe.I will definately replace mine w/this one. i added cumin though.

This was very good and easy.  I agree that a little sugar would improve it.  Next time I will add some diced jalapeno pepper to spice it up a bit more.  I will definitely use this recipe again!!

This was pretty good although I added fresh jalapenos and I think next time I make it I may mashh a can of regular corn rather than add the creamed corn. Tastes good but recipe tends to come out a little more like bread pudding??? I also added a little extra corn meal to try and stiffen mixture up.

This is not a bad recipe, it is just ordinary.  I couldn't even taste the green chiles in it.  I did have to figure out how to substitute for self-rising cornmeal, because my local grocery doesn't carry it, even though it is a major chain.  For others who can't find it, the 8.5 oz. package works out to about 1-1/2 cups, to which you need to add 3-3/4 teaspoons of baking powder.  I will be going back to the other recipe I have been using.  Wish this would have worked out better, because I really like green chiles in my corn bread.

I also used a box of Jiffy mix.  I used the green chiles, the creamed corn, and for the cheese I just used what I had on hand - Parmesan and Extra sharp cheddar.  The next time I'll use a cheese with a little more spice.  My batter made 10 muffins.

I loved this cornbread.  I used pepper/jack cheese to give it a little kick.  You will probally have to shread it yourself, but it is worth it.  I also added about tablespoon of sugar.  Easy and good.  I did not use Jiffy, I just used 1 1/2 cups of self rising yellow corn mill.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious!  It is a very heavy cornbread, just how I like it.  It was also very easy.  I will certainly make it again.

I used the Jiffy mix and followed the directions on the box. I then added whole  corn (didn't have creamed style) about 1/2 cup, some fresh jalapenos and shredded cheese that has taco seasoning. Super easy. Super cheap. Super yummy.

This was the tastiest corn bread I've ever made.  Have been in search of an easy, moist cornbread for years and finally found it.  Normally don't like to use boxed mixes, but happened to have a Jiffy mix on hand so it worked out great.  Will keep this on hand for future use.  Thanks Bea.

This was really easy to make and tasted very good. The only issue is mine came out more like corn pudding than corn bread. Next time I will add another 5-10 minutes to baking.

This was DELICIOUS!  I could have skipped the soup I made to go along with this and eaten as it as meal (you know...a very unbalanced one ;).  I used a box of Jiffy cornbread mix and a combination of cheddar and mozzarella, since that's what I had on hand.  Also sprinkled some extra cheddar on top for the last 5 min or so.  This comes out super moist and very flavorful without being very spicy.  A new favorite in our home to be sure!

We just finished trying this wonderful bread.  I too thought it was like a cornbread pudding, but I realized I used a 14.75 ounce can of cream corn.  Next time I will make it with the right amount of cream corn, 8 ounces.  We still loved the flavor but we had to eat it with a fork.  I added a teaspoon of pimentos and used fresh jalapenos.  It looked Christmasy.

I have seen many variations on this cornbread and this is hands down the easiet and the best! I'm making it to go with a beef stew this weekend. I'll probably add a little fresh jalapeno since my boyfriend and I love the spicy!

I used Jiffy cornbread, jalapenos instead of green chilis. I did not have creamed corn, used whole corn, drained and a little sour cream.  We loved it!! Its not sweet, but I like the kick of the jalapenos.  I would like it cheesier...maybe a little on top right before they are done!! Super cornbread can't wait to make again!

This was a very good recipe, flavor was excellent. However it was slightly dense. I would have lessen the milk to a 1/3 cup. But other then that it was very good.

MMM MMM good! The only change I made was to use Jiffy Corn Muffin Mix (it's what I like), added about half of a diced red pepper, and 1 cup of cheddar cheese along with the rest of the recipe. Then I topped it with sliced jalapeno rings and it was excellent! I love cornbread and I love mexican cornbread even more!! I think you could add regular canned corn instead of the creamed and it would be awesome too!

EXCELLENT! I used the Jiffy cornbread meal and used sweet kernel corn (not creamed)  I drained it but left some juice to make sure it turned out moist.  I also used a whole jalapeno pepper finely diced.  I didn't have montery cheese, so I opted for mild cheddar.  I, too added one teaspoon of sugar.  This comes out moist with the perfect amount of kick!  We served it with home made chili, yummy!  Thanks for the easy recipe!

I've been asked to bring this to every family gathering since I first tried it! I usually omit the peppers though, as many people in my family don't like them. I've also used a variety of cheese, and have yet to find a bad one. If I remember, I usually mix some honey in too, but it's still great when I forget!

I doubled the recipe, but after reading the direction on the cornbread muffin/bread mix, I was concerned the batter would be too runny so changed it slightly by reducing the milk to 2/3c.  I also, substituted a 12oz can of whole corn for the creamed corn.  The texture and flavor was great.  will definitely make again.

This is a recipe that will frequently appear alongside chili in our home.  It was very simple to make and the results are wonderful.  It is not crumbly, as you would expect with regular cornbread, because the creamed corn makes it soft...almost like a slightly spicy spoonbread.

ive madde this twice the first time exactly as directed and it was a little too moist. i combatted that tonight using half as much creamed corn ( freezing the other half the can for next time) and it came out way better. i like this because i can play with it some maybe using cheddar since i dont always have monterey jack in the house but always do cheddar. i did sprinkle the tinsiest amount of cayenne over the top before i baked it and i think it gave it a little something it wasnt hot but it was definitely good.

I gave this recipe a 3 star because of the final consistency at the end.  It wasn't very cornbread-like which is what I was looking for.  I did use the Jiffy Corn Muffin mix and used jalapenos instead of green chiles.  I think next time I will use regular corn rather than creamed corn.  I think the creamed corn made it too mushy.  Other than that I liked the recipe and plan to make it again.

I greased and preheated a black iron skillet in oven for 7 minutes before pouring in mixture. I used cheddar/jack cheese with a tablespoon of diced jalapenos as that's what I had on hand, decreased corn to 1/2 can because I was using a 7oz package of cornbread mix instead of 8.5 (last time I used a full can with the 7oz package and  thought bread was a tad bit too moist)

great recipe!    Like others I used Marie Calenders Corn bread mix,  drained the peppers and mixed kernel corn, peppers and cheese in the mix.  It was perfect!!  My guy was very pleased!

I couldn't find self-rising cornmeal so used a package of Jiffy corn muffin mix to substitute.  It worked just fine.  This is a great recipe.  Thank you.

I've made this three times to rave reviews.  I followed the advise of others and left out the milk, and I did not drain the chilies.  Delicious.

very disappointed .. taste was OK but the texture of the cornbread was WAY TOO "WET".  I think I will stick with the regular cornbread.  Texture was more like a "HOT PUDDING" instead of cornbread.  I will not make again!

This was a great change for a regular cornbread recipe. I made it in a mini-muffin pan, which turned out excellent! I used shredded cheddar for the cheese. So yummy!

excellent easy cornbread. not sweet for those looking for a savory bread. made it in muffin tins and divided it equally between 12 muffins and sprinkled with a little extra cheese. baked for approx. 20 mins. these were amazing with our homemade chili.

A friend of mine made this for a family event and it was a hit! There was none left over... She made a couple substitutions for a little more flavor, but it only added to this great recipe. She used buttermilk instead of milk, and sharp Cheddar cheese instead of Monterey Jack. She also added one chopped green bell pepper.  Have fun with this recipe!

THe flavor was good, but it came out very VERY soft, you could not pick it up to eat it.  I might make it again but cut back on some of the wet ingredients.  I wish I would have red all the reviews before I made this, none of the reviews on the front page mentioned the consistency, now I know better.

Very good.  Made this last night to go with a pot of homemade chili.  I altered it slightly due to ingredients I had on hand.  Used 1/2 cup colby jack cheese, 1 tsp sugar (personal preference), 2 TBS of chilies, thawed frozen corn mixed with sour cream.

Fantastic!  I did not change a thing!  The cooking time of 25 minutes was superb.  For the creamed corn, I actually made it from scratch.  I used a recipe from allrecipes.com called Creamed Corn Like No Other.  Thanx for the recipe!  My spouse thought it was too spicy, however, she cannot handle anything spicy.  She did enjoy it though, but I loved it!

I did something wrong and didn't turn out; it cooked wrong, but tasted great.  Just make sure you don't add to much water.  The recipe is excellent.  I will be making this again, but more carefully!

Chose this recipe since I had cornbread mix in the cupboard - it was great!  Didn't have creamed corn, so used canned whole kernal, and some sour cream.  Still turned out great, I could have put in jalapenos or used pepper jack cheese to make it spicer though.

This is very easy and tasty especially at 2am. I use 1 pkg of Mexican cornbread mix, 2/3 cup of milk, 2 teaspoons of sugar, 2 teaspoons of store bought diced jalapenos, and substitute cheese with a Mexican cheese blend. I leave the creme corn out cause well that stuff is just gross. I also use a muffin/cupcake pan in order to make individual servings easier plus it looks cool when it's done. I have also made this with 6oz of crab meat added in.

The texture and flavor was good but I would double on the cream style corn to make the taste a little softer. It tasted like it could use a little more sweetness.

Cornbread always seems a little dry and crumbly to me...until now!  I made the recipe as written except I added slightly more creamed corn than was called for, and it was fantastic. My son, who dislikes cornbread, said it was really moist and tasty. Thanks for a great keeper of a recipe.

We liked this. It has somewhat of a "pudding" texture." It's very moist, but it tastes good. As suggested in some of the reviews, I used a box of Jiffy corn muffin mix and used only 1/3 c milk as indicated on the Jiffy box.

Another 5 star recipe!  I added 2 tablespoons of sugar and used a small amount of chopped jalapeños in lieu of the green chilies. Served it alongside Allrecipes Slow Cooker Chicken Taco Soup and these two items together turned a simple, easy dinner into something that totally impressed the fam bam. Thank you!!!

Made it exactly the way the recipe indicated and it was delicious. I've never had a cornbread recipe that did not use lard or bacon grease come out this moist. Make sure you read the recipe correctly - it does not call for the entire can of creamed corn! I think some of the folks who have not had success are probably using the whole can.

My husband calls this "crack cornbread"!!!!  He said I "undid" his 3 mile run on the treadmill!!!  We love this one!!! I used a box of Jiffy Cornbread mix. The only substitution I made was to add diced jalapeños (the kind in the jar).  Didn't measure, just added  probably a couple of tablespoons full (drained), straight from the jar.  I also added a couple of tablespoons of chopped pimento (from a jar).  We love this recipe!!!

I have made this many times and it's always a hit.  I usually add a small can of sliced black olives and a little cumin and chili powder. As other reviewers have said, I use a packaged corn muffin mix and add the egg and amount of milk recommended on the package (1/3 cup).  Sometimes I use pepper jack cheese instead of plain jack to add a little more spice.

Instead of packaged cornbread mix, I followed the recipe but used cornmeal, 2 additional eggs & some flour. Really loved the consistency & a different texture to the usual, plain ol' cornbread. For a little 'zing', I also threw in some diced jalapeño & a bit of shredded sharp cheddar cheese. Even the picky little eaters loved this! I just think it turns out & tastes a whole lot better using cornmeal from scratch instead of a boxed mix. Try it out! Still very quick & easy.

Made this to go with chili tonight.  My cornbread mix was 16oz so I doubled other ingredients  and used a full size can creamed corn.  It turned out really tasty and made a loaf plus 12 muffins.

Loved this!! On the recipe it calls for 8 Oz of cream corn but you can only buy 14 oz so be careful not to use it all. I also added sausage to mine! You do have to let it cool down and thicken but it was delicious!!

Outstanding.  Moist, flavorful, just the right amount of heat for my family.  I used sharp cheddar in place of Monterey Jack.  Some folks reported difficulty finding 8 oz sized creamed corn.  Publix sells their own brand in an 8.5 oz can.  Used Jiffy mix.  This will now be my "Go To" recipe for mex cornbread.

I made this recipe using Jiffy Corn Muffin mix and followed the box instructions (1/3 cup milk instead of 1/2). I made sure to use half a can of creamed corn as others reviewers pointed out. I don't have a 9x9 pan (shame on me) so I went ahead and made them in a muffin tin with liners. After 25 minutes of baking at 400 I realized these muffins did not want to rise. What I ended up with was a little paper cup full of corn pudding, which didn't really go with my tortilla soup. I ended up breaking the muffins apart into a bread pan and baking with a little melted butter on top (about 1 tbsp) and some extra shredded cheese at 350 for 20 minutes. Easy way to doctor this recipe for those who end up with mushy muffins like I did. The flavor is good and I will try to make these again as stated in the recipe.

I love this recipe. It was easy and most items I already had. Unfortunately I didn't have any milk on hand so I had to improvise and used 1/2 cup of Mexican Crema. It came out moist. It was very popular at a dinner party.  Huge thumbs up!

I'm glad I read the review about the creamed corn. I would have dumped the whole can in there. It calls for 8 oz., but a regular sized can is 14.5 oz. I also replaced the green chiles with canned jalapeños, and used hot pepper blend cheese. It has some kick! But, I like that & I think my changes made it perfect. I'll be serving it with Mexican beef stew.

I added about 1.5lbs of meat, tomato paste like was mentioned above, no water at all, a lot more chili powder and diced up some chipotles in adobo sauce for the kick it was lacking!!!!!  I also added 27oz pinto beans instead of kidney beans.   Very good and quick recipe.

This was sooo tasty!  The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 was it seemed a little too moist for cornbread.  I will have to try it again and add extra corn meal and see if it lightens up.  We served it with a black bean soup and it was soooo good dipped in the soup.

Having been on a low carb diet the past two weeks, this was a piece of Heaven.  I did reduce the milk to a scant 1/2 cup.  Otherwise, I left everything the same.  I served it with the Salsa Chicken from this site, Mexican Rice and Mexicali corn.  Absolutely yummy on a cold winter night.

This was really good with simple turkey chili from this site!  My BF said this was the best cornbread he has ever had but I thought my grandma's recipe was much better...so I give this a 4!!

We were not thrilled with this recipe. I took the advice of other reviewers and used whole kernel corn instead of creamed corn, but it was still too heavy for out tastes. Also added extra sugar which made it too sweet for out tastes. Perhaps the corn I added was too sweet to begin with. I don't think that I will make this recipe again, but will look for a similar one.

I wish I had read all the reviews first before making. I followed the directions exactly. It turned out a pan of mush. I cooked it longer than suggested and it still was mushy. It didn't resemble cornbread at all. With some tweaking it could turn out better.

This was excellent. I made a few changes, after reading a couple reviews from other testers. I didn't have cream corn, so I did a can of whole kernel corn and added a 1/4 c. of melted unsalted butter. I also added a tbsp. of sugar. I used bacon grease to grease the pan, which gave it even more flavor.  paired it with the Crockpot Taco Soup also from this site. Way to go! Great spoon bread!

I absolutely love this recipe.  Instead of green chiles, I add chopped jalepnoes for an extra kick.

My husband really liked this cornbread, but I thought it was too moist and heavy.  It did get better as it cooled, though.  I would have liked it a little sweeter, too.  Try Absolute Mexican Cornbread from this website - it is the best!

This mexican cornbread was very good.  I was baking it to go with my blackeyed peas and ham on New Years Day so I doubled the recipe.  The only thing was I only added one can of the chile peppers because I was afraid it would be too much heat - no it would have been fine with two cans.  Also when I baked it I used the cornstick iron skillet and the small iron skillet and put a little extra cheese on top at the end of baking.  It turned out perfect, moist and tender on the inside and super crunchy on the outside - with a great kick but could have used a little more heat if I had the guts and added the 2nd can of chilis.  This was gone the same day even though I was hoping to take some to work.

This cornbread was delicious!  However, I can not rate it 5 stars because I made some changes, and without them, this would not have been as good, in my opinion.  I added 4 teaspoons of sugar (we like it on the sweet side) and 1/4 cup of melted butter to the mix, so that it would be nice and moist.  Also, we used jalapenos instead of mild chiles for added spice.  This is definitely worth trying.  Will be making again.

This Mexican Cornbread was fantastic! Extremely easy to make and went wonderfully with the chili I was serving. Not too spicy , so if you want extra kick you'll need to add something extra. It took a little longer than 25 minutes to bake. It was very good and I will make this again.

Tastes great but next time I will drain a little of the juice in the cream corn as it is really heavy and soggy when baked. Great alternative to regular cornbread.

Yummy -- but this is SPOONBREAD, ***NOT*** cornbread!  I made it with Jiffy cornbread mix and pepper jack cheese, and it tasted great (I would call it very sweet, though, so that might be the difference in using Jiffy, compared to what other reviewers said) and cooked it in a 10" iron skillet.  After I took it out of the oven and saw the consistency, I put it back in at 450 for 10 minutes, and it was STILL the consistency of spoonbread -- there is no way on earth you could eat this stuff with your hands, as you would a piece of cornbread.  So, again, it tasted very good but was not at all what I had in mind.

This was pretty good.  I added the extra sugar that some suggested, but I didn't read directions carefully and didn't drain the can of green chiles.  The cornbread came out a little bit soggy/moist because I didn't drain the chiles, but it was still pretty good.

I added a teaspoon of sugar as recommended, cut down the cheese slightly, and used chipotle peppers in place of chiles (that's what I had on hand).  It turned out fantastic!  Great blend of sweet and firey!

This a way better alternative to basic cornbread. It is a nice accompaniment to chili on a cold winter day. I do try to cut down on the wet ingredients for better baking and  I noticed they do not stay as fresh as long as other recipes.

Nice spicey cornbread! I used pepper jack to give it even more of a zing, however, I also added some sugar as I like my bread a bit sweeter. Went over well with the gang Bea and thanks!
