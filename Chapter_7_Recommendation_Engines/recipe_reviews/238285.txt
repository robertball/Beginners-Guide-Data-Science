I'm not vegan but this recipe sounded like a cool one to try. I didn't make the icing because I was too lazy and I didn't have powdered sugar but they were good anyways. I didn't have apple cider vinegar so I used red wine and raspberry vinegar. They ended up just fluffy enough and very tasty. Thanks for the recipe!

These were great...they tasted much more decadent than the ingredients suggest. With the whole wheat flour, they are a nice breakfast muffin (without the frosting.) With the frosting they make a not-as-guilty treat! The texture of the frosting I found to be very strange...way too sticky with the melted butter and peanut butter. I added more cold margerine and powdered sugar (and used rice milk) to make a more traditional-texture frosting, which was delicious. This is definitely a recipe I will be adding to the repertoire!

These were good! My husband and youngest daughter made these as a surprise for my other daughter and I. They found and used this recipe. However, hubby didn't put in the baking soda because it wasn't in the directions (only the ingredient list). He was unsure what to do, so he omitted it. I'm not sure how different they would've turned out with baking soda, but they were good anyway. Next time, we'll use the baking soda. :)

This was an easy recipe. I forgot to add the chocolate chips to the batter, so I put some on the top of each cupcake. The taste is good, the cupcakes are a bit on the crumbly side.  I just had to try baking something vegan, since I had not done that before.
Would try again, but would see if anything could be done so it would be less crumbly.

I will start out by stating that I am not vegan. I made these for my daughter's friend who is. She absolutely loved them! I thought that these were very good. I doubled the confectioner's sugar for the frosting recipe as I thought that it was too soft. This also increased the amount of frosting that I had for the cupcakes so this made them even better. I also added 1/2 tsp. salt to the frosting as I thought it needed some of the sweetness cut after I added the additional sugar. I would make these again for our vegan friends. Thank you for posting the recipe!

Love the recipe! I left out the chocolate chips. And modified a few things for what I had. Also used coffee instead of water. Very yummy!!

I subbed egg for the banana, so it wasn't vegan. But absolutely love the taste of these cupcakes!! Will make again, maybe with banana this time.

If I were vegan, or visiting vegan friends, I'd make this again. Overall quite good and very light, but doesn't hold together as well as if an egg were added. Still good enough even without icing!
