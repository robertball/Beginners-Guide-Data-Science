This dish is unique and amazingly wonderful!  What a great contrast of sweet and hot, soft and a nice texture with the chopped chiles.  I will make this again and again!

12.25.12 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/216548/chipotle-garnet-yams/ ... These were more interesting than good.  No, not bad; just didn't say "Mmmm!" with the first bite.  'More an "Ohhh" :D  I used 3c mashed sweet potatoes, 1T chiles in paste (pureed), 2T each butter & brown sugar.  No heavy cream.  I may try it with corn.  I like sweet & spicy together, but with sweets just didn't grab me.12/12 Tried the corn switch. Pretty good.  Used 2T ea chipolte peppers, sugar, butter, cream with 3cans corn. Still a little too hot to have more than a few bites. 1T w 2cans might work better. 'Glad I tried it. Note4Me: 1# frozen corn, 1T butter, 1T heavy cream, 1T chipotle puree, 1t sugar.  Try 1 1/2t chipotle puree.

Loved it, easy to make, creamy, with personality.  Just because I love chipotle and maple syrup in other foods, I used half brown sugar and half maple syrup (of the 1/4 cup listed on the recipe) and it turned out delicious. Will definitely make again.

Love it!  This is our go to side dish for barbecues.  I follow recipe as posted, but make a sauce of all ingredients except yams.  I pour the sauce over the chunks of baked yams (or sweet potatoes) and mix until some of the chunks are mashed.  We prefer this chunky texture over a puree.

A little too spicy for my kids, would tone it down a bit next time but the flavor is amazing!
