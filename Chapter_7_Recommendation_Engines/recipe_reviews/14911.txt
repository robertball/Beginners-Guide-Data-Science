This dip was amazing! I made this with Old Elpaso's Hot and Spicy Taco seasoning mix. I think it would have been a little bland had I not used the hot and spicy seasoning. I was a little unsure of this dip when it was done as the cheese was just sitting in there and not incorporated, until I stirred it all together and it came together perfectly!

I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of crushed tomatoes, and it worked very well!  I drained them first and added only a tiny bit of the juice.  I used ground turkey instead of beef, and no one could tell the difference.  For a little kick, once the cheese had melted all the way, I added some hotsauce to the pot.  My cheese took a little longer than an hour to melt, so I would recommend starting ahead of time.  Don't let it go too long in the pot!  We had this for new years, and after the toasts at midnight, the dip had gone brown and had a bit of a burned taste (even on the low setting).

This was the easiest and most delicious dip, I've ever made.  I would recommend this dip to anyone.  It needed nothing extra; I served it with Frito Corn Chips.  The only note to make is that it takes much longer than an hour in a crock pot on low.  I had to turn the tempertature to high, so that it would be ready within an hour. Defintely a Keeper.

A friend gave this recipe to me a few years ago, only we use salsa, and call it "dog food".  My husband's friends all beg me to make it for parties, and fight over it.

This was so easy and so delicious. Made it for a potluck at work and everyone asked for the recipe. Will definitely be making this again. Thought I would add that I cooked the meat the day before which I think added to the flavor. Made this at home just for the family too as it is so easy and so yummy!!

We make pretty much the same thing except we use the 2 lb loaf, 1 lb ground beef, 1 pint salsa, taco seasoning or chili powder, a dash of garlic. AND we add 1 can refried beans. It makes it look even uglier, but it goes further, maybe just a little better for you, and it's less salty.
This version was a little lacking in flavor we thought in comparison to our usual dip recipe.

Really good. I didn't let enough of the 'juice' simmer off when cooking the beef so the dip was a little soupy, but it still tasted amazing. Was a big hit and sooooo easy to put together.

I made this for my daughters 6th grade spaninsh class fiesta. It was a hit with the kids.  I substituted ground turkey for beef and used a jar of salsa instead of tomatos. Super simple.

I love queso dip and this dip had just a little extra zing to it. I used Jennie-o ground turkey instead of ground beef and Ro-Tel tomatoes with chilis and it tasted fabulous!! I really liked this recipe and will use it again for sure.

this was a great recipe. I added refried beans in it and it was amazing.  i also used half a lb of colby jack cheese, and half cheddar, and then I put a little mozzarella cheese in it.  

next time i would probably not do this in the slow cooker because it took a very long time.

This was an easy recipe to make at the last minute.  I cooked it in the oven on lowfor about 30 minutes rather than using a slow cooker.  It was eaten quickly at the party I took it to and everyone liked it.

Just to "bulk" this up a bit, I added 1 can of chili. OMG it was so good. Everybody loved it! I had left overs and days later I reheated it and it was still great! Yummers!

Good Dip
Although I think it could use some chopped green chiles to "kick it up a notch"

This dip had great flavor, was easy to make and was eSimlnjoyed by everyone who indulged in it!  Thanks for sharing, MELAINA!  We opted to use the microwave in lieu of the slow cooker and it worked great.  Simply mixed the cooked, seasoned ground beef and tomatoes with the cheese and cooked at 50% power for about 8 minutes.

Simple and delicious!  I didn't have crushed tomatoes, so I used a 16oz jar of salsa instead and I think it's better this way.  Adds some nice spice.  I also cubed my cheese rather than shredding it.  Doesn't make a difference as long as it can melt easily.

I replaced the crushed tomatoes for Rotel but followed the rest of the recipe as called for.  Looks a little weird but taste good and went very fast at the work food day.  Next time I will probably just cube the cheese and put all the ingredients in warm (cooked the meat the prior night).

I use Rotel, no taco seasoning and add in a can of red kidney beans.  I just cook all this in large pot on stove top then place tortilla chips in bowl and pour it on.  Delish!!  Kids love it too

Hmmmmm, I have had better, but this is still good. We also like this with sausage instead of green beef. I use 4 TBS of taco seasoning mix since I buy this in bulk and not the individual envelopes. For tomatoes, we like using the tomatoes that have the peppers in it (Rotel). For the previous poster that didn't know what loaf processed cheese is, picture a box of Velveeta or similar.

Very tasty.  I added twice the amount of cheese called for (I wasn't paying attention) which increased the cooking time a little, but the end result was a super cheesy hit.

Amazing!!!! I am known for my buffalo chicken dip, but when I made this for my husband he said, "This puts your other dip to shame!" I made a slight modification. I used Rotel instead of crushed tomatoes. It turned out perfect, cheesy, and delicious!!

This is so easy and good.  We have even added venison instead of beef, gave it a little more zing!

This was so easy, and everyone loved it!  It could use a little bit more spice, though.  Maybe use salsa instead of the tomatoes?

Great recipe.  I used venison to keep it somewhat lean with all the cheese.  I also used salsa instead of tomato sauce one time and it was great. green chili's are great for those who like a little extra spice.

This was good.  I used canned nacho cheese instead of processed cheese block, because that's what I had on hand.  Fed a crowd, and everyone enjoyed it.

As far as these processed cheese dips go, this is a good one. I had never used meat before, and it tasted great. Be sure to stir from time to time while your guests are enjoying this dip, because the meat will all settle at the bottom.

No taco seasoning and substitute beef for two pounds of spicy Italian sausage. I sautéed onions and also added black olives. Not the typical quest dip. Everyone loved it.

Very simple and very good!  I made this for a unexpected get together at the last minute.  I did add dashes of red pepper to spice up the ground beef/taco seasoning for more spice!  And what the heck is "loaf processed cheese?"  I just added a pound of shredded sharp cheddar cheese*LOL* For the finishing touch and a little more flavor I added chopped green onions, pretty and tasty!  Thank you for a great,last minute appetizer!

This was easy to prepare.  I made it on the stove in the morning and warmed it in an electric fondue pot before my party.  With Frito's Scoops, it tasted good and was finished off.  Next time I'll pick a spicier taco seasoning.  I went mild because I don't like pain, plus I had lots of kids present.  This recipe can stand at least medium seasoning without heating up your mouth.

Yum!!! This was a hit!  I made this on Christmas Day. I used real cheddar cheese which tasted better and worth the extra money than velveeta.  I used a can of drained petite tomatoes instead if crushed tomatoes.  I omitted the meat to make it vegetarian.  We used the remainder of the sauce in baked potatoes, yum!!  I will be making this again.

I made this as instructed except I only used half of the cheese loaf and baked it in the oven for a hour at 250 degrees. It was so good and I liked the thicker consistency with the decrease in cheese. I served it with tortilla chips and sliced bread and my family loved it!

Love this dip!  Made it for Superbowl and a subsequent 4 times and each time guests have asked for the recipe.  It goes great with tortilla chips, bread and even over pasta.  We can't make it too often because we can't stop eating it.  So good!

I added onions and more cheese than the recipe called for. This is a great dip for parties. Its in a slow cooker everyone can serve themselves.  I highly recommend using a slow cooker liner for easy clean up.

This recipe was so easy to make, and it saved my butt the morning of the family reunion I forgot about. Everyone loved it and unlike using a normal cheese I made it before hand and it stayed melted and dipable all day even with the crock pot off! I liked it!
