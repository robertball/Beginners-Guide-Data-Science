This was incredible.  I simply made as a salad bowl and did not go with the jars ( although for on the go I think its a fantastic idea ). I love chicken satay with a peanut butter sauce, but admittedly  wondered if a cold peanut dressing would be the same. I need not have worried it was amazing. A nice change from the normal chicken salad recipes.  I would not change anything here other than perhaps going 1.5X the chicken and doubling the dressing ( but just my taste ). Do try this!!!

This is very tasty, but being 6 servings (although a good meal prep), I think at minimum it should serve 2 peeps for 3 days, 6 days a week for one would be so very boring and it's not the most nutritious recipe out there. Would be great for a group lunch though!

Okay I haven't made this yet, but plan to.  However, the noodles will get really soggy if they sit in this so I would suggest putting them in a small snack zip lock bag and lay on top.  you would definitely need a hardy lettuce or by the 6th day the lettuce is going to be wilted and slimy.    I would put the dressing in a small container and add when I'm ready to eat--this may have been in the directions, but I can't see them and type this. (smile)

Great twist to the "boring" jar-salad!  My significant other loved the recipe as is, but I do not eat meat so I substituted the chicken for chickpeas and it we both loved it!
