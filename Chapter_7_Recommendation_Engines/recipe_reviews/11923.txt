I doubled this recipe and took it to a birthday party.  The dad ate about 4 helpings. I then told them I'd leave the left overs.  It did take a while to chop all the vegetables, I added green pepper because the store was out of red and I forgot to add the tomato.  Which was perfect because the mom does like them at all.  I refrigerated this overnight and added a little extra italian dressing 1/2 hour before serving.  Doubling doesn't really require 2 full bottles of dressing. Save it to zest it up right before serving.  I'm making it again this weekend and    I'm adding the red pepper and tomato.

Easy and fast. I omitted the peppers, changed grated Parmesan cheese to 2 tbls, reduced salt to 1 tsp., added 1/4 tsp. garlic salt & 1/2 tsp. celery seed, used "1 1/2 cups" chopped broccoli and used Zesty Italian dressing.  Delicious:)

I've notice this and it sounds delicious, I just wanted to add that instead of spaghetti...it would be interesting to use linguine and maybe even add Salad Supreme...it's flavorful.

This is excellent and a nice change from "regular" pasta salad. Made it for my coworkers and was asked for the recipe many times. Will definitely make again.

Ok, this salad is WONDERFUL! Ever since making it for the first time (at my wedding reception) I have been asked to bring it to every gathering.  I have changed it a little for the taste buds in my house.  I omit the poppy seeds and sesame seeds and I use whole wheat thin noodles, fat free italian dressing, cherry tomatoes (they don't get everything else tomato tasting) and I add whole black olives. Natalie, thank you for bringing such a wonderful addition to my recipie box!

This was a really great recipe.  I did not use spaghetti, I used Cavatappi pasta instead, as I think long noodles and oil dressing is a recipe for a stained shirt!

Wonderful!  My husband hates broccoli normally but loves italian dressing -- but this dish even had him wanting seconds.

I loved this dish. There's not much to it, which is a positive for me. I used whole wheat pasta, organic italian dressing, and tons of veggies. I feel so healthy and it's so tasty too.

This was great. I get a lot of compliments when I make this. Next time I might add some zucchini.My fave dressing is Wishbone Italian. I omitted the red onion as I just don't like them but I added a little vidalia onion, finely choppped. Our local grocery store makes a really good spaghetti salad and this is very close.

I love pasta salads and this is very good but I thought a pound of pasta was too much.  I used a half pound of linguine instead.  Everything blended beautifully.

This certainly had a great combination of ingredients.  It was nicely seasoned, light, and refreshing.  I liked it a lot--better than other pasta salads I've made.  The boys just thought it was okay, though, so I'm not sure how often I'll make it...but I'm glad I tried it.

This was so good. I mixed everything while I waited for the pasta to cook and I could have ate the whole thing even without the pasta. I did wait though and am glad I did. Thanks for sharing.

i scaled this recipe down for a 4 person serve to have for lunch for myself and my partner. i made it early midmorning and it was good by lunchtime. i used french dressing instead but it still turned out nice. i added more parmisan, cayenne and paprika because i really like parmisan, and the paprika balanced it out nicely. i will definately be making this for a group next time. cheers.

I substituted linquine for the spaghetti, omitted the poppy seeds (didn't have any) and used only 2/3 bottle of Italian salad dressing because the salad would have been drowning in dressing if I'd used the full amount.  Even so, we didn't care for this salad.  It was a very pretty salad, but we felt the flavor of the cayenne pepper overwhelmed the other flavors and not in a good way.

Like others I didn't add the sesame and poppy seeds but I did cut a block of mozzarella cheese into cubes and shaved parmesam cheese instead of grated.  1 whole bottle of dressing is not necessary. It wasn't a "WOW" dish but it is delicious and refreshing. I will make it again.

OMG This was wonderful.  I had a ton of various fresh veggies that I bought at the local farmers market so I thought I would try this. The only small changes I made was I used small cherry tomatoes (makes for a less soupy salad) did not have seasame seeds and only used a half bottle of dressing. Unlike many other reviewers I never had anything like this before. My mom did NOT make this but I love it.  Don't worry about leftovers it is better the next day.  Thank you Natalie for the post

I had to make a pasta salad for a volleyball tournament.  My Mom used to make a version of this when I was young so i searched out and found this recipe which was similar to what my Mom used to make.  A couple of changes - for various reasons...I used 1 lb. of whole grain spaghetti, did not use any garlic powder (mine was all hard from condensation), and I did not add the paprika (didn't have any) nor did I use sesame or poppy seeds.  Next time I make this I will try all of these items in the salad because I think it will add more texture and flavor to the salad.  The version my Mom used to make was much more simple and plain but was wonderful too.  With that said - the version I made was a big hit with adults and teens alike.  I used green onions (matter of preference over red onions) and I used more parmesan to taste (great with more in my opinion).  I also used a bit more salad supreme (didn't use seasoning salt) I did NOT use the whole bottle of salad dressing and I'm glad I didn't because I think it would have been too liquidy and create soupy pasta - which I didn't want.  I made this the night before as we had to be up and out of the house by 5:00am - and it was fine.  I think this salad would be fabulous as is and did not intend to make all these changes - it just happened that way.  Thanks for the awesome recipe - it was a big hit.
