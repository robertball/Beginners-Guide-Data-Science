Superb! Made this for supper tonight (as per recipe, except cooked to well-done as wife refuses anything less). Wife, who is not a fan of red meat cleared this off her plate in record time. "Would you like more?" "Yes, please!" Daughter, who follows her mother when it comes to  aversion to any red meat speaks up, "I'd like some more, too, please." Whoa! I've never heard that before! Asking for more meat?! Served it with "cole slaw" recipe from this site (the one without mayo - wife doesn't like mayo either) french fries, desert was apple pie ala mode with caramel syrup. Big smile on wife's face +  daughter happy = Dad glad. TY Chef John and allrecipes.

Holy Cow!!!! No pun intended!! Where to start, this is beyond yummy. I'm glad I watched the video before I grilled the steak and it was beyond delicious!! I also reduced the marinade and put over the steaks when they were finished. I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical with the combination of the ingredients in the marinade but this is the best I have ever eaten. I made baked potatoes and steamed cauliflower broccoli combo. It was a perfect Sunday dinner. I bow to you sir!!! :)

This recipe was very tasty. Next time, I will let it marinate for about 48 hours to really intensify the flavor but I do think it was a keeper just as written. It sure did dress up an otherwise boring skirt steak!

OK I'm going to be the first to rate this.  I don't think I'm going out on a limb, either.  Chef John makes fabulous food, and in the video, the meat looked perfect.  Think I'll serve it with mashed potatoes or rice to take full advantage of that sauce.

I am compelled to write this review to let everyone know DO NOT LET ANOTHER BBQ SEASON GO BY WITHOUT MAKING THIS RECIPE!!!
Did you hear me??? I mean this recipe's marinade/sauce is the true star.  It is a blend that does not resemble cola, coffee, hot sauce in any fashion in the end, yet combined and set, then cooked resembles a sauce that will make you a star!!!
If you are afraid of heat, then back off the hot sauce, and cayenne pepper.  DO NOT omit them, as they are a intricate part of the flavor, simple add a drop or two of hot sauce, and the pinch of cayenne! 

I served "Roasted Parmesan Rosemary Potatoes" and "Grilled Vidalia Onions" (recipes from this site) with this steak, but I do plan on making this steak many times more this summer.  

I then plan on making this marinade/sauce for a stuffed round steak recipe that I have in the fall and winter!!!

I have followed Chef John for a while now, but I am now a devoted fan!!  Thanks for the easy, flavorful, star making recipe!!!

Very good. I think that it will be marinated longer next time, I did 24 hours, but will do 48 next time. Also, maybe a thicker cut of meat too.

This was fantastic.  I watched the video first and followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfectly.  The steak was melt in your mouth tender.

I prepared this exactly as Chef John directed in his video, and it was awesome!

The only difference was that I did not have any rice vinegar, so I substituted white vinegar.  This was some of the best, most tender, juicy skirt steak that we have ever enjoyed!

I'm going to get some rice vinegar, and we will definitely be doing this again!

Used this marinade recipe for flank steak and replaced rice vinegar with white vinegar. 
My wife and I had two meals.  I adjusted the saved marinade on the second serving for a deeper flavor:  added an additional half cup of coffee and a tsp of starch to thicken. I rate this recipe as 4 stars as is and 5 stars with my changes.

Yes, I, too, am annoyed by reviewers who give 5 stars and have modified the recipe but here I go. I changed but 1 thing: the cola. I used instead Dr. P_____. I had the luxury of starting the marinade process 3 days in advance using a nice piece of skirt steak that I had aged before even starting the marination process. The texture, the flavor and the caramelization of the meat had the guests raving. I served it with a fresh savory dark cherry compote. It was eye candy on a plate and no leftovers. Thanks once again Chef John, you haven't failed me yet.

Although nervous while making this for family from Europe, this was a winner.  Our butcher shop didn't have skirt steak but did have flat iron and it was divine.  Everyone enjoyed it and I breathed a sigh of relief.  We marinated it overnight , at least 18 hours. Highly recommend this recipe.

Really good and easy prep.  I make marinated flank steaks pretty often...usually in some sort of Terryaki marinade...but the kicker on this one is reducing the marinade for a sauce...phenomenal!  I usually broil flank in an oval copper baking (au gratin) pan pretty close to the heat and put just enough marinade in the pan to keep the steak juicy while cooking. Maybe 10 min a side with broiler set to 500.  The marinade can take a while to reduce so if pressed for time I will add a little Wondra to thicken quicker.

I marinated this for a couple of days and my husband grilled it.  With his first bite he said "Wow this is amazing, what did you marinate it in?"  The only thing different from the recipe is I didn't have rice vinegar so I used regular vinegar and I used August in Austin hot sauce which has some fantastic heat and great flavor.  Will be saving this to make again!

I couldn't find a skirt steak so I used a flank steak. Only marinated it for 5 hours and it was STILL yummy. The whole family loved the reduced marinade and made good use of it. Will definitely make this again.

Confession time: Didn't have rice vinegar so I used Sake.

Don't let the name of this recipe fool you,  it's awesome.  I couldn't find skirt beef so I used flap meat.  It was marinated for 24 hours and grilled to perfection.  The reserve sauce wasn't as easy to make as the video indicated, at least for me. My family however are still raving about it and the meat.

Usually love Chef Johns stuff, and this was perfectly satisfactory, but sooooooo average. Followed recipe exactly except used red wine vinegar instead of rice because that's what I had on hand. The steak was very tender and very juicy, but did not think the marinade added anything. It just tasted of watered down sugar water with a little rosemary. It was okay, but certainly nothing special, unfortunately.  Sorry Chef John!

I'm really sorry for this rating...I don't know what I did wrong.  I followed the recipe exactly, watched the video to make sure I was doing everything right...Maybe it was the meat.  Chef John's skirt steak looked bigger than mine, but maybe it was the photo.
After grilling to the appropriate doneness, I let it rest, eager to taste it - it was like jerky and so chewy, neither hubby or I could eat it.  I swear I didn't overcook it!  We tried a few more bites, but gave up and ate our baked potato with the marinade, which was good...
Sorry Chef John, usually love your stuff, maybe it was a bad cut from the meat case...?

Chef, I love all your recipes but this one. I got 3 lb of the good fresh skirt @ 10.99 lb from Reading Terminal market in philly. Only place for great meats around here. It came out perfect minus the taste. The coffee overtook everything I couldn't even season it after to make it taste any different. all went to waste. But thank you for the idea.

Used a nice piece of skirt steak.  Followed directions to a tee including the grilling directions.  Although the flavor was excellent, it was quite tough.  My husband, who is a cooks dream, as he easily pleased and will eat almost anything, was disappointed..so was I.

Wow!!! Crazy day, only marinated 3 hours but, these are amazing!  Got thick rib eye steaks at DD Meats just north of Seattle. Made carmelized onions with Creme de Cassis to go on top and finished with fresh feta cheese. We will be making these again for sure! Thanks for such a great recipe!

This Is a fantastic recipe and the first time that I have tried cooking skirt steak.  I made it according to the recipe with one change.  I had no rosemary and substituted Herbes de Provence.   I marinated it for 24 hours and grilled it on a charcoal grill for about 4 minutes on each side.  It was SO tender and flavorful.  I will definitely make this again!  Thank you, Chef John!  I always love your recipes.

The flavoring was excellent. If I make again, I'll go with a different cut of meat. The skirt steak was not what I hoped for in texture, very chewy. Even my teens with sharp teeth were complaining.

We loved this recipe - except we weren't impressed with the cut of meat we bought! I marinated it 8-10 hours and the flavor was delicious and the reduced sauce was really tasty! (Ive never reduced marinade before. It was easy and turned out really nice!)

Made this for Father's Day for my in-laws and there are no leftovers! My mother-in-law and husband like their meat well-done and so, even though it killed me inside...I let a few pieces cook on the grill for about 10min instead of the recommended 4-6. I also added a little flour to the marinade once it was in the saucepan to really thicken it up.

Perfect recipe. Well done!

We didn't get to marinade as long as we would have liked, but the flavor was still fantastic.  Will definitely make again and can't wait to see how much it improves after we marinade longer.

It was good, a little too sweet for my taste. Next time I will add less coke, more vinegar and hot sauce/cayenne. I marinated 2- 1 inch thk. loin steaks for 48 hours and the marinade was really infused in the meat. Good recipe..

I will make this again. It tasted like it could have been from a restaurant. It was weird at first but after you let it marinate for a while the rosemary, drinks, and stuff mix into something wonderful smelling. Then it tastes great after it's over.

Made it using a Hanger Steak, sans hot sauce and salt.   Marinated the steak for 2 days.  Grilled each side 3 minutes on heat and 1 minute off heat for medium rare,  It was fabulous!  Next going to try it on a Flank Steak.

Waweewowow ! This one would get 10 stars at home, even with my lazzy- extra simple version for 2 : 1/2 can of Coke, same quantity of strong dark coffee, same quantity of ketchup sauce + garlic and chili pepper flakes as taste. Let marinated steaks in it one night or more. Cooked in frying pan and served with mashed potatoes.... I can only repeat waweewowow , it will be a definitive keeper !!! and no one ever guessed the (queer) ingredients of the sauce. How is it possible that so many "bad" things all together make such a fabulous ending ?

I made this exactly as stated.  I left it in fridge more than 24 hrs, but the meat was still tough. The meat tasted like I pickled it, and the marinade smelled like something I clean my kitchen with.   I'm a good cook, but I just don't like john's recipes. Won't use any more of his recipes.

I followed the recipe as written and it was excellent.  Though not quite as fork tender as in Chef John's demo, certainly as tender as any stake you would want to eat.  Served with baked potato and asparagus.  BTW skirt steak is also often called flank steak.

This is the best steak marinade! Everyone loved it! I used red pepper flakes instead of hot sauce, just a few, it gave it a nice flavor and I could control the hotness. Will do this one for company.

The marinade was fantastic. Skirt steak was NOT juicy and tender. Like leather. Will use marinade again on another cut.

I followed this recipe exactly and I have to say neither my husband or I cared for this very much.I will not be making this again.

The marinade/sauce is incredible. My steak was a bit tough but that was my own fault.

Usually, Chef John hits it out of the park.  However, we didn't think this was much of a home run.

The recipe was great! Instead of a skirt steak, I used 4 striploin steaks about an inch thick and we had more than enough sauce for each steak.  But like other reviewers, I would marinate this as long as possible.  I did it for the 8 hours, but would definitely do it overnight or longer.  The sauce was very tasty as well.  Will definitely make again.
