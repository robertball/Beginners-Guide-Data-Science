This was incredibly delicious!!!  I made some slight adjustment in the cooking technique and a couple ingredients, but that's it.  I had frozen chicken breasts on hand so I seasoned them w/ a little bit of granulated garlic and Italian seasoning and I put them in my crockpot along w/ 1/4 cup water on high for about 3 hours and then turned it to low for another 2 hours. 
I made the sauce as instructed w/ the exception I added in the tomatoes along w/ the other ingredients.  Make sure you use a good quality white wine - I used Barefoot Pinot Grigio. This sauce is amazingly simple, packed w/ flavour and I plan on making it again!  Thanks for the share!!!

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because it was quick, easy, and tasted great.
I made a few changes based on what I had in the house... Here's how I made it. 
Added garlic powder to the pepper/oil mixture. The broiling of the chicken really adds great flavor. Don't change that aspect.... Added a squeeze of lemon and chopped garlic to the mushroom mixture.  Also used canned Italian tomatoes as I didn't have any fresh tomatoes.  Served the chicken over fettuccini noodles with Alfredo sauce. Oh my.....

Way too salty! Otherwise delicious.  I will cut the salt in half next time I make this one.

I also used half the butter and will take it down to 1.5 tablespoons next time.

Solid recipe - with some changes to make it healthier. I broiled the chicken just sprinkled with salt, pepper and 2 TBSP of pesto. No olive oil is needed. Flavor on that alone was great!  
Made the sauce with these changes:
Sauteed onions in nonstick pan misted with my olive oil mister. There's no reason to use so much olive oil. Added 3 cloves garlic, chopped, at the end of onion cooking time. I found the recipe to have too much pepper if you/your kids are sensitive to pepper. I used the amount called for but next time would reduce by half.  Also used half the salt (and I'm a salt lover). 
I used chicken broth instead of wine, as I happened to be out of wine (ack!) and did not add any butter in at the end. The flavor was so delicious and flavorful. I am someone who loves ALOT of flavor, and was very happy with the recipe. I served the sauce over the chicken with veggie and salad on the side. The sauce was plentiful, so I plan to use the leftovers tomorrow over some whole wheat pasta.

A family favorite. We had trouble broiling the chicken--the olive oil gets too hot and smoky. I bake the chicken, then put it in the pan with the sauce to simmer.

The flavors of this recipe were delicious, but I had to modify the cooking technique for the chicken.  I tried broiling, as instructed, but my chicken was smoking by the end of the 10 minutes, and the thick chicken breasts were still raw in the center.  Next time, I'll probably bake the chicken, instead of broiling it, and I'll slice the breasts in half lengthwise, before baking.  I also sauteed two cloves of minced garlic along with the onions. Based on other reviews, I reduced the salt to about 1/2 tsp, and this was plenty.

Excellent recipe.  We have an Italian restaurant up the street and this Tuscan chicken is better than the restaurant's.  This is easy to make and has a wonderful flavor.  I use sun dried tomatoes instead of roma's and add some chicken flavor booster to the recipe.  Wonderful

The flavors were excellent. Omitted butter at end. The chicken itself didn't have a lot of flavor so next time I will marinade the chicken ahead of time. Would also add more artichokes but only because I love artichokes!  Otherwise, very very good!

I will absolutely make this again!!! Delicious! Robust w flavor! Substitutions or changes I made were: I had a bag of frozen artichokes. I boiled them until unfrozen and slightly tender. Drained. Added dash of olive oil & pinch of Italian Seasonings. 

I added a little garlic salt & natures seasonings to the olive oil & pepper mixture. I didn't want that chicken to be too bland. 

I didn't have white wine, so I omitted that step all together which also left me wondering if I really needed the calories of the butter.... so I left that out too.

 I added tomatoes a little early to reduce those down and get them nice and tender. 

Also, I used the Italian seasonings from a salad dressing packet for the veggie blend. Worked beautifully!! 

It tasted like a restaurant dish all the way!!! Pour a glass of wine, some fresh hot bread of your choice & bon apetite!! ??????????

We really enjoyed this. I made it without the wine. I'm sure it would have been even better with it.

This was so yummy and easy.  I did tweak the method by browning thin chicken cutlets until cooked through in a saute pan, and did use garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper and italian seasoning on them.  Then I just removed them from the pan and sauted the veggies with minced garlic,  I also added a bit of chicken broth and some sliced black olives, and added the chicken and some cooked spinach linguini back in the mix.  This was light, brothy, flavorful and delicious.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR!

fantastic recipe (big hit at home!) with a few tweaks:
-Marinated the chicken with a different recipe (lemon,chilli,oregano,black pepper, olive oil, vinegar)
-cubed the chicken and cooked it with the remaining marinade (no extra fat) on the stovetop
-used chicken stock not wine
-put the tomatoes in at the same time as rest of veggies so they were softer
-MUCH less salt (only a sprinkle)
-Only one TBSP butter not 6

This will definitely become a regular on our family dinner rotation!

We all loved it - husband and twin boys included!  I used chicken broth instead of wine (none on hand) but will try wine next time.  Also, will add more artichokes - love artichokes!  Thanks for the recipe - it's a keeper!

This recipe was so good!  My whole family loved it!  I made 5 breasts and increased the oil and pepper accordingly.  The only changes I made to the rest of the recipe were I used avocado oil instead of olive oil, I reduced the butter to 4T, salt to 1 tsp, and pepper to 1 tsp.  This will be a meal I make on a regular basis and rotated in with our favorites!  Thanks for sharing!!
