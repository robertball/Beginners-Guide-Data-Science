I'm a well-seasoned baker, but I had major trouble with this recipe. I found it spread much too much, and even with a good serrated knife they were very difficult to cut. After two attempts I'm writing this recipe off as a disaster not worth trying again.

I love this recipe. These biscotti have been a BIG hit with my friends and family. I have brushed them with semi-sweet chocolate for a dark and rich flavour. I have aslo tried adding cherry extract and snipped and well drained maraschino cherries for a mild 'black forest' effect. The dough is very very sticky, but I found it easier when I added a bit more flour and kept my hands floured. The end result is worth it.

Because this dough was so sticky I found it was easiest to work w/ when you keep a bowl of water next to you to wet your hands with while you handle it. I combined the dry ingredients first and then mixed in the wet ingredients last & my dough didn't spread out like other reviewers mentioned... it held its shape just fine. I did take it out of the oven after about 20 minutes to cut it and mine didn't crumble on me, but it think if I had left it in for the whole 30 minutes the edges would have started to crumble when cut. I also reduced the sugar to 1 1/4 cups instead of 2 and it was plenty sweet. Thanks for the recipe!

Turned out great. Thanks for the recipe. I left out the almonds becuase i had everything else on hand, and it was still good. I cooked it 15 minutes one way and 22 longer. They turned out super crisp and crunchy!

This is excellent biscotti!  Be sure to spray the counter surface w/ water and wet your hands before handling the sticky dough and rolling it out into a log shape.  This is the very best way to do it.  Also, do not pat down the "logs" before baking.  They will spread out on their own.  The recipe is very low fat and a perfect biscotti texture.

These were good. The dough is tough to work with - crazy sticky - but cooks up just fine. I had no problem making mine bake up with no burning or excess moisture. I added choc chips - worked just fine. I think next time I'll add more cocoa and perhaps some extra salt to help bring it out.  Otherwise everyone liked them and I will definately be making them again.

I love this recipe!  I have made the biscotti 3 or 4 times for my boyfriend because he is a coffee and chocolate freak and he eats them up every time!  I have never added the almonds as I never seem to have any around, but the last time I made these I added about half a bag of chocolate chips to the dough and they turned out extra chocolatey!

I don't like butter or oil in my biscotti because the more crunchy they are the less likely they are to fall apart in your coffee.  Plus, I just mix the ingredients in my food processor, dump the dough on a lightly floured cutting board, pat my hands in flour and shape the loaves.  Works great for me also makes the dough more manageable and not so sticky.

This is the recipe I've been looking for.  Very crunchy.  I used white chips for a contrast and I added 2 healthy tablespoonsful of Cafe Rica (you could use Kahlua or other coffee liqueur) WOW!!  Even my most Italian friends give it a thumbs up!

I think that there may be a missing wet ingredient, because I ended up with brownies with the grainy consistency of poorly made cornbread.  not a fan.

I just finished baking a batch and couldn't resist piching off a corner of one.  This recipe is, for lack of a better term, DA BOMB!  I added a little (approx.  2tblsp) of Carnation milk and 1/4 cup Khalua to the mixture and I substituted pecan instead of almonds.  I give it five stars and two thumbs up.  The recipe was simple to follow and will truly be a treat for me and my customary night time cup of coffee.  I LOVE IT and will defintely make it again.

I had to halve the recipe and once it was done and I bakd it the first time, it actually took longer to bake. I think it must be my oven that had caused it to be underbaked at the 30 minutes that was required. Other than that, it came out delicious! This is a great early start right now for college and waking up at 5 in the morning for it. I will definitely share this recipe with my Chef (I am studying Culinary).  I will certainly make it again and share with friends! :3  I like how it wasn't too sweet also.

Loved these, though the dough is sticky and  hard to work with.  Mine spread during baking.  I only let them cool 5-10 minutes before cutting..using a pizza cutter as another reviewer recommended (though I didn't add nuts..that might add a different dynamic to how/when you go about cutting them)  In the end mine were tasty an rock hard - just what I was looking for.  Thanks for sharing.

If you're looking for rock-hard, super crunchy, must-be-dipped-in-a-hot-drink biscotti, this is a delicious recipe. If you like to snack on biscotti as plain ol' cookies... not so perfect.

These lacked flavor. I would suggest using sweetened coco powder instead of unsweetened. The taste was slightly bitter. These burn easily so watch them carefully. Try cutting them while they're still hot with a pizza cutter. But honestly, I won't be making these again.

The dough in this recipe was unbelievably thick and hard to manage. Not to mention, there wasn't much flavor to this recipe and that was even after I added extra almond extract. I was really disappointed with this recipe. I will not be making this one again.

I had a hard time mixing the ingredients (it was so dry!) so I added a little milk.  I also didn't have vanilla (which could explain the dryness :/) but it was still a delicious recipe! And pretty easy--just make sure you have time to make them.  Oh yeah, and I used the Hershey's special dark cocoa--delicious!!

I made these last night to give as Christmas gifts.  The only change I made was to add a handful of mini chocolate chips to the batter.  They turned out FANTASTIC.  My husband says they taste just like brownies.  I've never made biscotti before and consider myself an average baker and found this recipe to be very simple.  The dough was a bit sticky to work with, but well worth the results.

My wife and I like them. I made them once exactly as listed and they were wonderful. The lack of oil in the recipe appealed to me for storage. The second time I made them I used egg whites (like egg beaters) for three of the five eggs. We couldn't tell the difference. Next time, maybe for all the eggs.

I just made this recipe. I substituted in pecans because I had no almonds. They turned out tasty, except the dough was hard to manage and when I went to cut the loaves, they completely crumbled. Not sure what I did wrong. But they were good and I might make them again if I remember to buy almonds!!

wonderful! i added too many chocolate chips to replace the almonds, but you really don't need the chips because its flavorful enough. i suggest baking a little longer for the first bake, but overbaking it on the second bake didn't burn it

This is the worst recipe I've ever baked - it was horrible -- I've made regular anisette biscotti all my life and never had them turn out bad one time - but this was a disaster - waste of 5 eggs and other supplies never again

Very tasty!  The dough did seem a bit sticky but dusting it with flour made it a bit less so.  I substituted Almond extract for the vanilla.  I also dipped the bottom in melted chocolate and drizzled the top with white chocolate!!!

Pretty good! Tasted like a brownie :) I didn't add the almonds because I was lazy, instead added chocolate chips. Cook them for a little more than it says to get them hard enough for a biscotti texture.

This dough spread out much too thin and wide, making long thin biscotti. Flavor was good.

Read reviews. Keep water nearby to wet a hands and counter as dough is sticky.  Drizzle melted chocolate and/or dip in nuts. Try reducing the sugar.

These were great! I placed mine on parchment paper and didn't fuss with the dough a lot.  I just plopped it down and built a mound. Doesn't matter much what it looks like since you are cutting it up anyways. I added chopped walnuts and dark chocolate chips...very tasty!

This recipe is way too tricky. The dough was so dry and powdery that I had to add 1 tbsp of water and 2 tbsp of heavy cream to get it all to mix. When the biscotti came out, it was texturally ok but tasted too much of baking soda.

This recipe didn't even come close to making 4 dozen.  I'm curious as to how many others are getting out of this recipe. Otherwise, easy to make, especially when using a kitchen aid mixer.

I also had the too much spreading issue - tried it with the nonstick spray and it spread 8" wide and so I tried putting it on parchment and while it was fine when I put it in the oven by the time I took it out it was only 1/2 high and close to 6" wide.  Totally unusable.  No idea what the problem was because I followed the recipe to the letter.  Really wanted to like this because love biscotti.

This was so easy that any home cook can bake this! I sprayed cooking pray (PAM) on my hands in order to prevent the dough sticking to my hands. To make it extra special, I drizzled chocolate ganache on half of the biscotti.

I like to make biscotti to give as gifts at Christmas but I can never remember which allrecipe I used from year to year. This one yielded great results but the dough was a serious sticky pain in the arse to work with; I don't remember having that problem in the past. I'd give it 5 stars if there were a way to do it that didn't involve ending up with chocolate Hulk Hands and rinsing half the dough down the sink because you can't get it off your hands! Delicious biscotti, though!

I found this recipe a lot of work. There's way too much sugar in it, most recipes for biscotti call for less than 1 cup. Very dry also...I had to add water and oil in order to be able to mix it. Very sticky...And I find baking soda gives it an unpleasant smell. I used baking powder instead. Don't think I'll be making this again.

Delicious, every bite!!! 

I add a few things traditional to my Italian roots from time to time - but, ulitmately, a wonderful recipe  as is and so very therapeutic in making!

It's become a regular in my regular baking - not only a holiday treat!!!

I was leery of this recipe because there was no butter, but since it had good reviews, I tried it. The biscotti came out great. The only change I made was to add about 1/2 tsp. almond extract. Delicioso!
