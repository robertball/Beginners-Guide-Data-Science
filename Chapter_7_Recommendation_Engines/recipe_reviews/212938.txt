This is the Filipino Adobo, so if you're looking for the Mexican/Latino version - this recipe isn't for you.  I love Adobo and my friend's Lola (grandmother in Tagalog) makes the BEST kind!  So luckily I had that flavor memory to go off of. This recipe yields a very vinegary Adobo when following the recipe exactly and takes longer to make than stated.  I added an extra 1/4c soy sauce, 2t sugar and 1 clove garlic to the recipe.  I let the chicken simmer, turning occasionally, for an additional two hours to soak up the new flavor of the sauce.  I just made this last night and after the adjustments it tastes pretty close to what Lola makes.  But the original recipe as it stands doesn't measure up.

I will be making this tonight for the first time but to the person who made the above comment "In Filipino cuisine, Adobo refers to a common and very popular cooking process indigenous to the Philippines where pork or chicken is slowly cooked in soy sauce, vinegar, crushed garlic, bay leaf, and black peppercorns, and often browned in the oven or pan-fried afterward to get the desirable crisped edges. "

This is a good basic recipe for Adobo.  I don't know why people are panning it.  My aunt (from Capiz, PI) always made it with plenty of vinegar.  I use more garlic, and also add plantains.

I agree with the others here that the recipe will be too sour.  I would recommend a 1:1 vinegar to soy sauce ratio - but you must experiment to suit your taste.

This is the simplest adobo recipe I have seen. Found it a tad salty for my liking. Fixed it by adding some chilli flakes.

I agree with previous comments.  Too much vinegar wil ruin the chicken.  Othewise an authentic rendition of a classic.

Chicken adobo is the most common plate eaten in my house and my family just Loves it! This is definitely one of the more interesting versions I’ve tried! I think ill just stick to my family recipe because this one uses more vinegar than I would use. I am half white and half Filipino, so I know how this is supposed to taste. But my grandma makes this with a special recipe and I beg her to give me the recipe but she wont budge. You can really taste the bayleaf and soy sauce. Honestly my family just mixes ingredients together and goes by taste. I am usually the designated guinea pig. Haha. But this is an amazing dish if done right and make to serve with a bunch of jasmine white rice!! This is ultimately my favorite dish and whenever I go to my Lola’s house, she has it prepared and waiting !

Try using rice vinegar instead of white vinegar. This will help with the bitter, vinegary taste.

It was good! My family was pleased. thanks for previous reviews I tweaked this recipe. I used rice vinegar instead and doubled the garlic since I love garlic. Also used chicken broth instead of water. Will definitely be making again I should've took a picture but we are it up fast.

It was not that bad, but next time I'll use 1/2 cup of vinegar. I added potatoes and carrots, so that helped reduce the sourness.

Very good! I took some tips from the reviews (More water, less vinegar) and watched the video. 
And I tweaked it a bit by giving the chicken a quick sear on the grill and by tripling the garlic, and using rice vinegar. Quite tasty! We will definitely make this again.

I use this as my go to adobo recipe for any kind of protein.  The flavors are spot on.  The only change I make is if I want it spicy, I add a half split fresh Serrano Chile.  No pictures because we eat it all!

Not bad. I never made it with onions. I adjusted the soy sauce, vinegar, and water to our liking and everything else unchanged.

This dish was just okay. I did used a bit extra vinegar and soy sauce for flavoring but it still had a good taste to it. I will probably make it again but next time put vegetables with it and perhaps some corn starch in the broth.

Love it, not too much vinegar for my liking.  Second time I made it I did tweak it a little.  I added  more soy, more onions, and about half a head of cabbage it was awesome served over brown rice. I also cooked it down alot just simmering at a good  heat and it was like a good almost Asian kick to it.  will definitely make again.

I read the reviews and my stubbornness ignored them. They were right, it was way to vinegary. But it still alright but maye next time I would add 1/4 of it.
