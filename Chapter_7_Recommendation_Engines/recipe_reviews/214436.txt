This was SO GOOD.  I was hesitant because I'm not a fan of mustard and I knew my husband would roll his eyes(mustard, apples and bell pepper???? YUCK!!!).  WRONG!  He had two kebabs and said it was fabulous.  I only made one minute change--I didn't have dijon, so I used honey mustard.  This is definitely going in the keeper box. I made Spanish rice to go with it.  YUM!

Probobly a 4 star recipie but I'll give it 5 due to the ease of preparation and clean-up as well as the fact that everyone loves them and they fit an active outdoor lifestyle. Last night I made the skewers up ahead of time, put them in a gallon size ziplock bag and took them to the local race track in the cooler & BBQ them on the tailgate.....all the other race fans were jealouse! I had some left over ingredients so I made them again tonight at home and served with coleslaw and home made fries. The ingredients keep well in an ice chest and I will pre-make these again for my next camping trip, day at the track, beach, etc. The apples may discolor a bit so try to get all the air out of the ziplock but once grilled and glazed it not noticeable.

These were good.  My 6 year old wasn't a huge fan.  I have made them twice and the sauce is the best part.  I didn't use CheddarWurst.  I used mini gourmet chicken sausages.  First time I alternated on the kabob and grilled.  second time did kabobs of all apple, all meat, etc and broiled on the oven.  Threw all in a bowl at the end.  It was just easier.  Would make again.

I decided to try this for our Memorial Day cookout. The kabobs were awesome, and just the right blend. I thought we had made way too much, and was worried we would have too much leftover. There was only 1 kabob left when we finished. I will be making these again.

I made this relatively plain, with only cheddarwurst pieces and apples.  It went over well, even with my picky-eater children!  7 cheddarwurst & 2 apples made 6 skewers.  To make it again, I would like to find & try some alternate veggies..... Maybe zucchini?

This was an amazing recipe.  Just made it tonight for dinner and me and my husband loved it.  I added a little more mustard than called for to take away the sweetness of the apricot preserves.  I used a granny smith apple and it had just the right tartness.  This will be another summer dinner for us for sure!

This was fantastic! I made this with my sister in law's family.  they're meat eaters, I'm a vegetarian.  We got sausage for them and Vegetarian sausage for me, and made up skewers for us both! They were fantastic! No leftovers! I'm happy to read the idea of making these ahead of time, I'm going to make them again tonight for a party we're having tomorrow!

This was pretty darn good. My boyfriend was a little weary about it at first... but he said he would try. He loved it. I added zucchini which added more variety. The glaze was just right combination of sweet and tangy. I served with white rice and a traditional salad on the side. Yum. Will be making this again.

oooh--we liked this!  I was surprised, but my kids actually ate these pretty well (not the onions, though).  Nice & simple for a spring week-night dinner.
