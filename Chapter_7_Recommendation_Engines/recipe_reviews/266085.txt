This was excellent.  Take the time to thinly slice the garlic instead of dice it as it makes a difference (especially if you soak up the sauce with a nice crusty bread, which you definitely should!).  Next time, I will make sure I have a better paprika - the regular stuff is fine, but a smoky hot paprika would have been better. I tried to make up the difference with a bit of chipotle tabasco, which was not out of place but could've been better. This is a very simple recipe which I'll definitely make again.

Good shrimp dish. Like most shrimp recipes, this one was quick to make. Kind of reminded me of shrimp scampi..
I can't have any alcohol in my food so for sherry I substituted 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar + pinch of sugar. I served over some buttered pasta.

Only changes were minor.  Shook a few red pepper flakes instead of using a chili pepper.  Fabulous dish!  Don’t forget to use baguette to soak up the sauce.

Great recipe,  I've been looking for this right recipe for awhile now! This is the one. Thank you! The smoked paprika knocks it out of the park!

I lived in southern Spain for 4 years and this brought back great memories.  Just as I remembered it!  I added one more clove of garlic, though.  Spanish Gambas al Ajillo is VERY garlicky.

I don't gave sherry. Replaced it with wine vinegar and made the recipe a bit sour. Will try again with sherry.

Simple yet satisfying! Quick easy to make, definitely serve with garlic bread to soak up the sauce. This made a great weeknight dinner for us served with bread & a salad.

I didn’t care for it. I followed the directions exactly but it turned out pretty flavorless.

Very easy and very tasty. As noted in other reviews, make sure you thinly slice the garlic (not chopped or minced). I skipped the paprika (my wife is allergic), but I'm sure it would have really added to the flavor.

This was super bland. I even added chili powder and extra paprika and sherry. Boring!

This was SO good!  Doubled the recipe for a family meal - served with rice, a baguette and a green salad.  Didn't have hot paprika (just regular) - but I don't like spicy anyhow.  Used sherry cooking wine because that is what I had on hand.  Slightly thickened the sauce with cornstarch at the end.  Will be making again!

Super easy and tasty. I made this exactly as written. I served it over pasta for my husband and over broccoli for myself. Next time, I think I’ll some cayenne or crushed red pepper. We like spicy food.

This was not only easy to make, but quite tasty.  Unfortunately, I didn't have fresh parsley on hand but it was still amazing but it would have been outstanding with the parsley so next time I won't forget it.  I used regular Paprika with a few dashes of Piri Piri (Portuguese hot sauce) and dry cooking white wine instead of the sherry.  This was a big hit with the family and definitely a repeat at our table.

11.5.18 I watched the video, followed the recipe to the letter, and although the shrimp were cooked perfectly, I’m still baffled why I didn’t have that sauce to top the shrimp.  I’d added a crostini to the bottom of the bowl, but just didn’t have enough sauce to drizzle over the shrimp to moisten the bread.  I know I could double the oil and sherry, but then I'd be adding a ton of calories and fat, as well.  Regardless, still delicious and quick-and-easy.

My daughter and I just got back from a trip to Spain and we had the real deal there. Like almost every day it was so amazingly delicious! This recipe is just as good as it was in Spain and so very easy to make.  I had to substitute Marsala as my small town doesn't have Spanish sherry, but it was sooooo good! 
Bread is a necessity to sop up the amazing sauce.
