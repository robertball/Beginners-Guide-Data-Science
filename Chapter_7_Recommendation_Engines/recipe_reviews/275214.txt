Nice flavor, turned out very well. My pork loin was almost 5 pounds, so I added a little more seasoning and an extra sweet potato, but I kept the brown sugar and butter the same.  I also added 1/2 cup apple juice. The sweet potatoes came out really well.

I followed instructions for this slow-cooker recipe exactly, using a 3 pound, 3 ounce pork loin roast. Only modification to the ingredients was rubbing the roast prior to cooking with dried sage, which gave it an excellent aroma and added to the taste. While the cooking time of 6 hours on low was certainly adequate to cook the roast to the required internal temperature,  juices from the roast turned the sweet potato cubes somewhat mushy. The roast itself, while done, was dry and we had to make pork gravy to make it easier to eat.  I would suggest that the recipe be modified to use slightly larger than bite-size pieces of sweet potato to avoid the mushy consistency.

This was delicious and SO easy. I added a Vidalia sweet onion and wish I would have had more of the sweet potatoes. The pork was moist and tender and even my little kids ate it! Definitely will make this again.

Delicious! will use more sweet potatoes and cut them larger so they don't get so mushy. Used leftover pork to make pulled pork sandwiches.

We don’t care for sweet potatoes, so did this one without them - but kept the sugar. Didn’t have the Chinese spice but used a rib rub. Super yummy - best, most tender pork loin I have ever made and no mess! (I used a slow cooker liner.) I made 2 loins so i can mix one with noodles for later in the week.

I made it exactly as stated in the recipe  and it came out very moist.  This time I plan to first marinate the pork first with the salt and maple syrup idea and then use this recipe to finish it to see if I can get a combination of more sweet as well as savory meat.

I added extra sweet potatoes and put in a sweet onion in the bottom.  As this is Louisiana, I, of course, added a bit of spice enhancements!

The only substitute I made was a splash of cinnamon and ground cloves in the pork rub seasoning.  I didn’t have Chinese five spice seasonings and it turned out perfect!

Two changes: I used red and white home grown sweet potatoes. and I made my own pork rub using brown sugar, salt, paprika, cumin, onion powder, and garlic powder.

As others mentioned, the potatoes got done WAY before the pork. I'd probably put everything in BUT the potatoes and cook it a couple hours before tossing the potatoes in on top. (if you use white sweet potatoes, they will turn dark. Having some of the pork fat on top of them might prevent some of it.)

Other than that I made it exactly as the recipe described. I found the Chinese spice a bit too sweet, more like a sweet potato pie which was great on the potatoes, but not so much with the pork. Meat was very tender and savory. I will definitely make it again, but leaving out the 5 spice Chinese blend.

I used 3 sweet potatoes but they cooked down so much, will use more next time, didn’t love the rub mixture, will change it next time. You literally can use anything you want, pork is so soft and juicy!

Pork turned out tender and juicy.  Not at all dried out.  the sweet potatoes, I used yams, were delicious.  I did add sliced onion to the potato mixture under the pork.  This was quick and easy to get going and then it  cooked itself leaving my oven free for corn bread.

Amazing.  Cut potatoes in chunks so they don't get to soft after 6 hours.  I used a rubbed that I smoked in my smoker and added the 5 spice to it.  It was amazing.  I recommend it.

Well I forgot I signed up for  a Crock-Pot cook-off at work until 2 days ago so searched for something I could easily throw together without running to the store and this just came in 3rd to gumbo and cobbler.... Only change was didn't have the 5-Spice seasoning so mixed cinnamon, fennel, cloves, black pepper and sea salt.  Received rave reviews from coworkers and will likely make again.

This turned out to be a very easy and delicious way to do a pork shoulder roast!  I did white sweet potatoes versus the standard orange color two potatoes I cut back a little on the brown sugar and only did a half a quarter of a cup and did not save any of the butter and sugar mixture from the bottom of the roasting pan.  My boyfriends diabetic so we need to be mindful of our sugar intake. This was a very moist roast even days later it’s not dried out and it makes fantastic sandwiches! I would certainly make it again.

Followed this recipe to cook a butt roast.  The recipe is extremely simple and the results were amazing.  The roast was juicy and flavor-packed...REALLY TASTY!  Loved the sweet potatoes, they were equally flavorful and nicely cooked...not too soft...just right.  Enjoyed the leftovers for a couple of days and pork remained moist and tasty.  FIVE STARS...thank you for a GREAT recipe.  Cheers.   BlueWaterSailor

I added a little cinnamon and some allspice to the brown sugar on top of the sweet potatoes  It rounded out the flavor of the sweet potatoes.

Followed the recipe as writing. Pork and sweet potatoes are a great tasting combination! Next time I’ll add more sweet potatoes so that there’ll be more leftovers!

I didn’t have the spice rub that was called for in this recipe so  just used salt, pepper & Chinese five spice. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I’m giving this recipe three stars not because of the flavor - it was ok, and might have been better with the addition of the spice rub - but because the meat, while reasonably tender if cut into small slices, wasn’t moist and ‘fall apart tender’ like I would have expected it to be after 7 hours of cooking. The sweet potatoes held up well and were quite good. I won’t make this exact recipe again.

Meat tuned out a little dry. But the rub was tasty.  I would ad some sort of a sauce or maybe a little beef broth to moisturize a little.  Very easy to prepare!

I usually do not make changes to recipes - they were written for a reason.  The “pork rub” was a little confusing but pork is the “other white meat” right?  I used chicken rub and it turned out fine.  For my 3 lb roast 7 hours was too long.  By the time I got home the meat was 200 degrees and falling apart.  It still was very good but really needed the sauce that developed with the potatoes which were very soft.  This could just be my slow cooker.  Maybe  “low” is hotter than others - I have nothing to judge it by but I would make this again.

Followed exactly. If you like boiled pork, this will be good. Sweet potatoes tasted good.

A definite keeper!  Didn't have the Chinese seasoning,  I couldn't find it. The meat just melted in your mouth
