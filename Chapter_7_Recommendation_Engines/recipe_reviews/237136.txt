Only good things to say about this one! I made it exactly as written and also froze my banana in chunks.  I also stuck my avocado in the fridge before making it. This made a HUGE serving - 3 cups of deliciousness all to myself! It could easily be split for 2 people though, but very filling as a meal for 1. I couldn't taste the cayenne, so I might add slightly more next time, but either way, this doesn't make or break the smoothie. Very healthy! I might even add in more kale next time too.

I tried this recipe and I loved it. To make it a little figure friendly. I decided to just use Kale and Banana, along with some whey protein powder from the health foods store, and water instead of coconut water. This is what I drink after a work out. I love how sweet the banana makes it without adding artificial sweeteners, and the Kale has such a fresh taste, it may not look pretty but it certainly is a really great pick me up after a hard workout.

I should have started making smoothies a long time ago. This was awesome. I didn't think the lemon juice made sense with everything else, but it was really good. I made it with almond milk instead of coconut water.

Instead of Avocado I used oranges and coconut milk instead of coconut water. Only because I didn't have the other ingredients turned out great.

AAAMMMAAAZING!!! I couldn't say enough wonderful things about this recipe! My kids love it, too. The lemon tames the taste of the kale, and the cayenne gives it that yummy zing it needs, and using coconut water instead of regular water just adds to the deliciousness and goodness! Definitely worth the time to try! Best one I've found yet!

Delicious! I think I might add a dash of chili powder the next time I make it as well to see what that does for its spiciness.

I did not have coconut water, so I used 8 oz of water and 8 oz of orange-pineapple juice.  I increased the kale a little bit, and added extra cayenne.  It was great! I will try it with the coconut water when I get some. I think it would be good with a little cucumber added to it.

First time I made it, I was out of cyanne pepper and substituted chili powder .  That added a little kick.
Since then I make it by the recipe unless I need a little "jumpstart".

It tasted better than I expected, but the kale was too strong. I don't think I would make it again.

Good recipe. Used unsweetened almond milk instead of coconut water, can out bit bitter. Added 2 small apples and 1 extra banana, which helped. Added 2 scoops vanilla protein powder, which made it too sweet. Will try next time with unflavored protein powder.

I thought it was so so. Not bad but not GREAT either. Definitely drinkable. Next time I'll try the coconut water. I substituted unsweetened almond milk for the coconut water. I halved all the ingredients since one post said this made 3 cups for her.  Mine made 16 oz. I also added a lil more than a dash of cayenne like she suggested bc I like a lil kick. Although I don't suggest it. It was a lil too much. I ended up puting extra banana for a lil more taste. Definitely give it a try. Very easy to make!
