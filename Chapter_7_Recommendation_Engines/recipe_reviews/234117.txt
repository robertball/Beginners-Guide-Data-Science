Really loved this recipe. The second time I made it used half the butter, and increased the curry powder to my taste. Used an immersion blender; so much easier than batches in a blender container. Made a big batch and put several containers in the freezer.

I used olive oil instead of butter and added a couple of carrots and onions. I also added corn starch to thicken. Simple healthy and delish.

I'm trying to eat healthier so I wasn't excited about the stick of butter. I minimized the butter to 1 TB instead and added an extra tsp of chicken base to make up for the salt in the butter. Amazing! Next time, I'll omit the butter altogether and add a dash of cayenne and pepper. I served this with sour cream and chives on top. Highly recommend! And without the butter, this is seriously low-fat/low-cal!

This was great! 

- I did not use any oil or butter or salt
- I used 2 tablespoons of No Chicken Better Than Bouillon  (instead of real chicken broth)
- 4 cups filtered water
- I added about a half of bag of frozen petite peas for the extra protein and flavor (deeelicious!)
- I added 2 red potatoes, sliced and not peeled
- Pureed soup in a high speed blender and added the soup back to the pot and brought to a simmer to serve ... Beautiful and creamy deliciousness! 
 
-Making this again tonight! :)

Huh. I thought after all the rave reviews this was going to be amazing. I tried to follow the recipe exactly, even weighing my zucchini to make sure I put in the correct amount. I LOVE  curry, but made myself only put in 1 t. Yeah. It tastes kinda weird. I'm taking it to a family party, so I'll report back if they like it better than I do. It seems like something is missing. I'm thinking of adding onions and sour cream to see if it is better.

This soup is so easy and absolutely amazing.  You can get away using 1/3 to 1/2 the butter called for in the recipe.  I also added some chopped onion (about 1/2 cup) and chopped carrot (about 1/4 cup).  I increased the curry powder to 2 teaspoons.  I pureed with my immersion blender and it was perfectly smooth.  After it was done, I added cayenne pepper and black pepper to our taste.  This recipe is easily doubled or tripled.  I made it the first time to see if we would like it  and then immediately made a triple batch to freeze.  When you read the recipe, it doesn't sound like anything special but it is wonderful.

I like this soup a great deal, but I agree with other reviewers that a stick of butter is too much. I only used 2 tablespoons and that was plenty. I also doubled the curry powder and added a dash of cayenne pepper. I may add a potato or a sweet potato next time. One thing I love about this soup is that it is quick to make. A pot of homemade soup in under 20 minutes is genius.

I absolutely love this soup! I was searching for new zucchini recipes and found this. So easy to make. In fact making my second batch already. I did add onions the first time and adding some carrots as well this time. So quick and easy!!

This recipe is simple and delicious! I only used 1/4 cup of butter to cut the fat.  My husband loved it!  Had to make it twice in one week because he loved it so much!  I think the curry power really adds to the flavour!

So easy and delicious.  I think next time I'll try it with less butter just for health reasons.  I used the immersion blender...much easier than my blender.  I also added cayenne.  This soup is an excellent way to use up my giant zucchini from the garden. Love this soup!!!

Delicious! I agree that the butter should be lessened. I used less butter but added a bit of olive oil.

Easy it is, and that's what I like the most about it. I wish I had read the comments first though, because I agree: that amount of butter is overkill, and it could stand more curry kick. It's a good base to customize to your liking. I might try it again with different spices/vegetables. (I did try it again with carrots added, but you lose the nice smooth texture unless you cook the carrots until they're reeeeeeally soft).

Followed the recipe and used a stick blender. It tasted like zucchini! No other ingredients needed; just like Gordon Ramsay's broccoli soup.
(Please include metric measures for international readers). Thanks!

So easy! I have made this several times. I saute an onion in the butter (I use half the butter called for) before adding the zucchini.  I also double the curry powder. Perfect for anyone on a keto plan like us. Goes really well with Dr. Eric Berg's almond flour bread recipe (on YouTube.)

I love this soup because it is easy, quick, and healthy.....I used veggie broth instead of chicken broth, half cup of coconut oil instead of butter with a dash of I Cant Belive Its Not Butter, and I added a little chopped onion and carrots, oh and garlic powder. I took out the carrots with a slated spoon prior to putting everything in my Nutribullet, then added them after. It turned out so creamy and good! We added a little croutons to it and was really good with those. My boyfriend, who is not a big veggie person even liked it! I will be making this again! Thanks for the recipe!

5 stars! I added a small onion to mine but otherwise, followed the instructions without any alterations. The texture reminds me of broccoli cheddar soup but with the yummy flavor of curry. Delicious! I will be adding it to the meal rotation.

I love butter, but would agree with other reviewers and would use less (at minimum 1-2 tbsp. less on the next go-round)--but I do plan to do this recipe again.  I did add a quarter cup + of carrots and quarter cup + of onions.  Great flavor.  Very nice.  Another reviewer mentioned spring onions, which sounds enchanting.  Would love to try that.

Lovely soup! I used less butter and added a couple of spring onions which I fired in the butter a bit, before adding the rest. Served with garlic bread on the side. Delish!

This very versatile recipe encouraged me to experiment in making soup with canned vegetables.  With this recipe I cut the butter down to 1-2 tbs but then added in a little bit of cream or half and half which never hurts anything but the diet.

Really enjoyed this recipe. Super easy, and tasty. I've made it as is, and with increased curry powder, both ways were great. Left overs tasted fantastic as well.

Wow with the flavor! Had some zucchini that needed to be used and I was looking for an easy recipe. This is a winner for sure! I was going to pack it into containers for lunch, but I may just eat it all right now ;)

This came out pretty amazing. I didn't have broth, so I just used a vegetable bullion cube in water, and I didn't have curry powder, but cayenne powder instead. This came out amazing, though.  I'll make this again, and often.
