This was a great side dish. I used olive oil and only used about 1 Tbsp. and added a 1/2 can of drained black beans and fresh lime. Thanks

Hmmm, something different - I've never made anything like this before. I made it exactly as described, and it was good to snack on by scooping it up with corn tortilla chips. I do wonder, though, if this recipe could do with less (or no) butter.

I added lime juice, tabasco and avocado. Took it to a dinner party and got compliments from people who are good cooks, so a keeper for the recipe box! Thanks.

I made this without the peppers and onions. We really enjoyed it and I'm making it again as a cold salad for a potluck dinner. If you like corn and salsa, you'll like this.

A few alterations, did not grill veggies or use butter as I did not think it needed it. Added some black olives and served with Salsa Chicken recipe from this site. Very good.

I was excited to make this as a side dish for enchiladas and beans, but I was pretty disapointed in the lack of flavor. It was nice to have fresh chopped veggies on the plate, but it really lacked seasoning and flavor. I thought the spicy salsa and fresh jalapenos added would do the trick, but it wasn't enough. :(

This was phenominal and easy to make.  I would highly recommend it to everyone.  Add a chopped fire grilled hatch chili pepper to it and put some pep in your friends step.  LOL

I made this with roasted red pepper instead of fresh red pepper, fresh roma tomatoes instead of salsa, and add a can of black beans.  I used the juice from two limes and used 1 bunch of cilantro(love that stuff).  Great summer salad!

This was just okay for us. I didn't really care for it at all, but my fiance thought it was okay. I cut down on the butter, but I still really didn't like the flavor of it in the salad. I was expecting it to be fresh tasting and it just wasn't that. Thanks for sharing with us!

I thought this was good. I did think it needed a little something extra, so I added a little ranch dressing. I will make this again.

The only problem I had with this was that the butter got kind of hard & icky once it was chilled. Maybe just spraying the pan before you saute the veggies would be enough?? It was delicious though and even my skeptical husband was pleasantly surprised:)

This was........very plain. I think with a few more spices (maybe some cumin, paprika and chili powder) and a little lime juice, this could be really good. I even used a good salsa and it was just.....not enough. As is, we weren't impressed. Noone really liked it.

This was pretty good.  Wasn't sure if I should eat it by itself but over some spinach leaves sounded good so that's what I did.  I used yellow bell and oil instead of the butter.  I used a homemade salsa which I think makes a big difference in this recipe.  Very tasty...thanks!

I made this to accompany a mexican lasagna and it was just perfect.  I did add about a teaspoon of sugar to it and I thought it turned out fabulous.  I will make this again when I'm cookin' Mexican.

Modified this quite a bit because I didn't have time to run to the store to get all the ingredients. Heated 1 tbs of olive oil in pan.  Added 16 oz bag of corn and 2 minced garlic cloves and 2/3 of a can of Rotel.  Heated through and served warm.  Easy side dish with lots of flavor.

I found this to be very good as a veggie side dish. I used 1 can of corn (so about 1.5 cups); it would have been better with frozen or fresh, but didn't turn out bad AT ALL so go ahead if you're wondering. Aside from adding 1 can of rinsed black beans, I didn't add anything. I did have to use dried cilantro instead of fresh. Ultimately, this was DELISH. The jalapeno added just enough spice. I served with something un-spicy so it was good. However, my fiance didn't like it cold as much as slightly warm (as in a little zap in the microwave). I admit it was pretty darn good warm too. One other note: this made WAY MORE than 4 servings although I don't know what size of a serving it was intended to be. As a side dish with enchiladas, I think there are more like 6-8 (for people watching what they eat, not teenagers or bottomless pits). I will definitely make this again with fresher corn, but I will always add black beans because I love them dearly.

Recipe was ok - didn't care for the zucchini in it, and I would use a hotter salsa next time.  Might substitute something else crunchy for the zucchini next time and see if it makes a difference.

Great mix of flavors! I paired this with the Healthier Chicken Enchiladas and it make a great healthier dinner! I used a sweet but medium chunky salsa and it worked very well.  The only thing I would change is to use less butter next time.

Something fun and different! Couldn't decide if it was a salsa or a vegetable--and neither could anyone else at the party. I won't make it again for a party, but I'll make it again for myself (and my weird taste buds). Make it your own and have fun with it!

I used Rotel lime and cilantro instead of salsa, used can of rinsed black beans instead of zucchini,  added more lime juice and cilantro and added a whole fresh jalapeno. I called it corn relish and served it warm. AMAZING!

I made this with modifications for personal preferences and we liked it. Served it along side tacos.

This was an awesome side dish. It had great flavor and we liked it warm, rather than cold.

I made this for my family along with some bean tacos. It was amazing! Everyone loved it. I used real fresh, sweet corn and cut off the kernels myself. Messy but so worth it. Canned corn will likely make this taste bland and boring. Go fresh! It makes it so sweet and crunchy, perfect for this salad! Gorgeous colors too!
