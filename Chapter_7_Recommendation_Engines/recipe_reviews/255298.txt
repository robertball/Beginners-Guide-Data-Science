Delicious! My family (with 4 kids)  always eats all of them within an hour or two!   We hardly ever cook gluten-free, but I had almond flour so I decided to try it. My husband told me to buy more almond flour, because these are so delicious.   I used regular sugar and followed the recipe exactly.

Really good cookies from a flawless recipe. Everything written in the description is exact: they are fluffy; they melt in your mouth; and the coconut oil keeps them moist and full of flavor! Thank you for the recipe.

Made it with 1/4 c dark brown sugar (regular sugar) and 1/4 c monk fruit sugar.  Added 1/2 c pecans and 1/2 c unsweetened coconut flakes, to make them like cowboy cookies.  They turned out fabulous.  They baked the full time.

Made it exactly except I didn't have the right kind of sugar and used brown cane sugar instead. The cookies came out incredibly delicious, soft, and not too sweet.  I will definitely make these again!! My fiancee can't stop eating these too. :)

I used brown sugar (gluten free) I follow the ingredients but the last three  I change the order and  I add the almond flour at the end. The dough was so soft and so delicious, I divide it and make one with chocolate chips, other plain and the last one with chopped walnut and cranberries this last one for my husband!  After bake it I try and there are so soft and so good. Thank you.

Just made these cookies and had to try one.  The cookies have a very good taste and so far are not crumbly.  The only substitution I made was instead of 2 cups of almond flour, I used 1 cup of almond flour and 1 cup of Bob's Red Mill All Purpose Baking Mix.  I pressed the cookies out a little bit because  they do not spread with the substitution  I made.  I don't know if they spread with using all almond flour.  I will definitely make these cookies again.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

Used softened butter as I don't buy coconut oil, otherwise followed recipe. Scooped onto silicone lined baking sheets with a 1 1/2 T scooper. Cookies do spread some, but I got 3 cookies across on my regular sized baking sheet. Cooked 12 mins. Made 21 cookies. Mine were flatter than the main picture, resembled more of the regular thickness of a regular gluten free chocolate chip cookie. They were very moist, so I am storing in fridge in a tupperware container. For a gluten free cookie, they are pretty good.

Took much longer to bake than the recipe said. They were pretty good but could have been a little sweeter.

I used normal flour and normal sugar with vegatable oil because I didn't have those things in my house I also didn't use pink salt because I don't own any.

Very good, easy to make, easy recipe to follow. I used a cookie scoop and these donâ€™t really spread so I ended up with domes. The other part of it was that they were a little underdone in the center. I was surprised how moist they are with so little liquid in the recipe. Next time I will squash them a bit, and maybe bake them a little longer (I baked them for 11minutes.)

These are excellent.  I used almond meal instead of almond flour and normal sugar (which is gluten free).   These were soft and chewy and tasted like almonds or marzipan.  Would make these again.

I had to use regular gluten-free flour, not almond flour.  And the cookies came out VERY dry and bland.
