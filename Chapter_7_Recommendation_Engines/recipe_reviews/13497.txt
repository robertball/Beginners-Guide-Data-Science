I knew ahead of time that this recipe would be too bland for my taste buds, so I added a little chopped garlic and a little more chopped jalapeno for an extra kick.  It was even better reheated the next day after the jalapeno had had time to really sink in.

This was a big hit for Christmas dinner and one of the more popular leftovers.  Since it was the holidays, (and we had already blown the diets soooo badly already) I added a few slices of cooked/crumbled bacon and just a touch of bacon grease.  I also baked it in the oven to heat it after preparing it the day before - - -wonderful!

yum! I made half a recipe. I used frozen corn and a can of green chiles, threw it all in a pot on low until warm. I will make this again.

Yummy!  I used a tub of cream cheese with chives (instead of plain).  Very good - will definitely make again!

I altered the recipe to serve one person (myself) as a late night snack. I used low-fat cream cheese, but found that it didn't melt very well. So I heated up the corn in the microwave for about 30 seconds, the cream cheese broke up quickly, and it took about half the time to make. I eventually added many of my own seasonings (salt, pepper, paprika) as I found it to be much to bland. Although, I found the cream cheese to corn ratio to be a bit too creamy, this was an okay dish after all. I would suggest tasting it as the dish cooks, and adding your own seasoning as needed. Also, if you are cooking small quantities, cook on low heat, otherwise it will overcook and/or burn.

This was wonderful and easy! After reading other reviews, I was afraid it might taste too bland. I opted to make the recipe as is and had mild, diced green chiles on the side to offer as needed. This was the perfect solution and everyone's taste buds were pleased. I was one of 3 who found them to be a fabulous addition and it did not matter at all that they weren't heated with the corn. Yummy combination! Two of my guests tried the chiles, but loved the corn as is without adding anything else. I will do this from now on. Each person can add to their personal taste and everyone was thrilled with the dish. I was afraid that my youngest daughter would be her usual picky self and complain that it was just like creamed corn which she does not care for. To my amazement, she gobbled it up (without the chiles) and asked for seconds! Thank you for this great recipe idea. I simply used canned corn and heated it through, drained it and finished with the recipe as written. The cans don't quite measure exactly 3 pounds, but it worked beautifully. This is not meant to be a gormet recipe. It is, however, a terrific spin on serving basic corn for your vegetable and just as easy! You should have the diced green chiles on the side to try them. I was glad that I did because I don't care for bland taste.

I read a lot of reviewers who thought this was bland... but I liked this a lot as written, and my extremely picky children inhaled it! (I used salted butter so maybe that added some flavor) I always cook my veggies "al dente"...and just added the butter and cream cheese to melt. I didnt need to cook any further, and didnt want the corn to get mushy. Even though i liked as is, I think it would also be good with either some garlic salt, or some canned chilis or chopped jalepenos.

This is such a simple recipe but so delicious. I separated into 2 and added diced jalapeños to one.  Cream cheese and jalapeños together are one of my favorites so this is definitely a side dish we make quite often now.

I used 3 ears of corn, 1/2 a tub of chive & onion cream cheese, and the butter...I thought my son and husband were going to eat my pot, they ate it so fast!  Will be making this week as well, with the corn crop still in grocery stores.

I was looking for a way to jazz up corn for a potluck luncheon I had at work.  I found this recipe and thought I'd give it a try, but with some moderations as others suggested.  This is what I did.  I used 2 Pounds of frozen corn, 1/2 can of chicken broth, 1 8 oz package cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp paprika.  I let this cook in the crockpot for about 2 1/2 hours half on high, half time on low and would stir occasionally.  Everyone loved it.

Kind of funky -- sweetish with a strong cream cheese flavor.  I didn't alter at all.  My kids (5 and 8y) really liked it -- might make it again for that reason. A nice change from plain corn.

I checked out the reviews on this recipe before I made it so I was expecting something a bit more tastier than what I actually got.  This corn was just a bit too bland for my taste buds.

This is even better with a sauteed onion and garlic. It's a shame that my family isn't big on it because it leaves a ton leftover. My a@@ can't stand any more attention. ;) Good stuff right here.

Follow the directions.DO NOT use a crockpot, even on low. It's great if you do it the right way! Add a little sugar if you like it the southern way!

I have used this recipie for many many years but I add 2 cups of sharp cheddar cheese to mine and bake it instead of stove top.  Its always a big hit!!  Its even good as a dip for corn chips the next day if you have any leftovers!!  Not a diet food for sure but so good!!

Just like the recipe I was given years ago.  Occasionally have to thin with a little milk.  Very easy in the slow cooker.  Just add all with the cooker set on low....stir occasionally.  yum yum

This can be a little bland. I add taco seasoning to mine to give it a zip. Then it's the perfect side dish to a mexican meal.

I love corn.  I often open a can of corn and eat it as a snack...lots of butter and salt.  I was looking for a simple way to improve basic corn.  Adding cream cheese worked very well....ate nothing but cream cheese corn for dinner tonight.

This is my favorite way to eat corn.  Since no one else in my family likes it, I make smaller batches, but it reheats well too.

I cooked the corn then put it into the crockpot where I added the cream cheese and butter.  It was very yummy but will add bacon next time.

Soooo good. Adjusted for 1 person since I'm the only one in our family to eat veggies all the time. I used canned corn and added habanero Tabasco, minced garlic (dehydrated), salt, and paprika. Cooked in the microwave for 4 minutes stirring halfway through. It came out really yummy!

It tastes exactly like it sounds.  Nothing great, but not bad either!

This is an excellent corn dish that is 'something different.'  I did however make a few changes.  I added some minced garlic, as well as salt and pepper to taste.  I also added diced jalapenos.  I'm a spicy girl so the hint of heat from the jalapenos is a great touch. :)  You can add green chilis instead of jalepenos if they are too hot for your liking.    Delicious!
