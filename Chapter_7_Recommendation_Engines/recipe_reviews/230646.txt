Tastes like Tater Tots stuffed with some cheese wrapped in bacon with a dash of hot sauce.

Off the charts!!!! Skipped the cheddar cheese and cut each slice of bacon into 4 parts which was plenty... served them with BBQ sauce.... heaven!

Turned out very well - we took them to a potluck dinner party and everyone loved them.  We used regular bacon, sharp cheddar, and smoked chipotle flavor Tabasco sauce.  They tasted better after they cooled a bit.

The best thing we had for Christmas Eve. So easy  and it was a party in your mouth when you ate them. I used smoked gouda for my cheese and put them back in the refrigerator to chill back up before cooking them. I think that helped them crisp up better. Will do again for sure.

these tater tots fell apart after cooking - the presentation was poor, as they did not look appetizing.

Oh so good.  The only change, after making them three times, will be to use a slice of hot pepper instead of the hot sauce.  The sauce just seems to seep away with the bacon grease and melting cheese.  So far it is a big hit with everyone as is.
