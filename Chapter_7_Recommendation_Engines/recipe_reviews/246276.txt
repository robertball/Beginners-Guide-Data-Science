Flavors are great, but it's too sweet. I will use less syrup the next time.

Very good, a little sweet but the flavors are excellent. I loved the rosemary & ginger combination.

I just mixed the syrup with tonic for an alcohol free drink.   Yummy. And it smells wonderful.

Such an easy, refreshing and complex drink. Great to make a pitcher of them in advance. I stirred rather than shaked it with ice because of the sparkling water.

4.5 Stars for this one.  Great summer drink. Strong taste of ginger and rosemary.  You barely taste gin.  I followed the recipe very closely and it only made about 5-6 drinks; not sure why.

So good, we're making them for Mother's Day dinner. I didn't change a thing...even added the pepper. Be sure to use a fine sieve.
