These were delicious! I am a blue cheese lover and can eat it by the spoonful. Consequently, I didn't think there was enough! Next time I will add more blue cheese crumbles. Thanks for a great recipe.

We loved these burgers! I omitted the onion powder and upped the garlic and everything came out great. The buns had just as much flavor as the burger and the blue cheese. I also brushed the buns with butter!  Excellent combo and easy to make. Will make again.

There are not enough words to describe how awesome this recipe is. This is by far one of the best burgers I've ever had and I don't even care for blue cheese. My husband who does love blue cheese agrees. At first I felt the bacon seemed to get lost but halfway through I realized it played a big part in the overall flavor and juiciness of the burger. Make these the next time you have a cook out. Your guests  will love you!

This is the best burger ever!!!  It's a few more steps than most burgers but well worth it. My husband said it's one of the best he's ever had. I didn't change a thing, followed the recipe exactly.  Highly recommend making this.

All these things are delicious but together it wasn't outstanding to me. Most of the ingredients got lost from being mixed into the meat instead of added as toppings at the end - I know there was not nearly enough blue cheese flavor in the finished burgers. These are good flavors but I didn't care of the execution of the dish. Thanks for the recipe!

We like all these ingredients individually, but unfortunately we did not care for this burger. My husband said it was okay, but my daughter and her boyfriend each only took a few bites of theirs.  They were overwhelmed by the spiciness of the red pepper flakes and just felt that there was too much going on with these. The Ball Park buns were fantastic however.

4.10.17  A really different gourmet burger IMO, loved it!  Super juicy and tender, and I liked the little kick you get from the red pepper flake burger rub.  Just an interesting combination of ingredients that worked for us.  Felt the blue cheese flavor was a bit in the background, so I'd probably add more in the future.  This is my first time using the Ball Park Buns, and they held together down to the last bite.

First try on this recipe after years of making black and bleu's, this version is pretty darn decent. We liked it a lot. The flavors are nicely balanced. Seared them on both sides and finished them in the oven. Will make again. Yum!!

I wish I could give this recipe 10 stars, it was that good!!  I was skeptical of adding eggs, but it held everything together nicely, and made it very moist.  I was also skeptical of the brown sugar in the rub, but it was perfect to get that blackened effect.  Excellent burger recipe from Ball Park!

Loved this burger! I did have to reduce the pepper flakes because I didn't want it to be too spicy for my girls. I topped mine with even more cheese, lol (swiss) and all the fixings. GREAT combo of flavors/textures! The family raved (we all LOVE Blue cheese)...a keeper for sure~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I made these burgers per the recipe and they were a hit. Two of our friends said it was the best burger they had ever eaten. I will definitely make the burgers again.

This was a delicious burger. I served it topped with blue cheese dressing lettuce and tomato. I will definitely make it again.

These were just OK.  Probably won't make again.
