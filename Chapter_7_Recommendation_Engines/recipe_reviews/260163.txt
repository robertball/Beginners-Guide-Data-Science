To save time I cooked the hash browns in a little olive oil at the same time as the sausage, and then added the sausage with drippings to the hash browns and mixed rather than layer.

I added mushroom, tomato & fresh spinach to the mixture and a layer of bacon on top before I added the cheese. Then I poured the eggs on. Was delish.

Tasted wonderful and comforting. My one concern was after 45 min baking, the egg/milk filling was still a little watery in the bottom of the dish, maybe from the frozen potatoes? I did brown them before putting them in the baking dish as directed.  I used the cubed hash browns, maybe shredded would work better? Was serving this to a picky girl eater so did not add the green chiles, but that sounds yummy for next time. And the leftovers this morning were even better!

This was a really good breakfast dish for Christmas. I substituted the sausage for a turkey sausage and it was really awesome.

This is my go-to recipe for serving overnight guests.  I have been known to vary it some by using fresh garlic or throwing in some green peppers or other veggies, but it is delicious as is.  I make it the night before, then refrigerate to bake in the morning.  When it is bubbly on top and a little crispy around the edges it is done.  Let it set a few minutes before serving.

I’m curious if the sausage should be 1lb, but regardless this is an amazing recipe! I had to add a little avocado oil in order to fry the hash browns because the sausage didn’t render enough fat. This recipe is definitely going in rotation! I halved the recipe and it still made enough to feed 4 people. I loved it!!

I think I will try baking the hash browns in the dish to brown them next time, while getting the rest together.
But the rest was easy and quick and it turned out great.

I made this for a potluck brunch for my daughters volleyball team. It was a hit! It was actually the only Entrée that was completely gone. Had multiple moms ask for the Recipe.  My daughter said it was the best choice at the brunch!!

Left out the garlic and onion powder in the egg mixture. But added it to the sausage as it was frying. Used shredded hash browns and browned them a little bit before putting in the casserole dish. Used 8 eggs and 1 cup milk, should have used either less eggs or more milk; seemed a little dry the way I did it.

I made this for brunch this morning. I was exhausted from hosting last night but thankfully this recipe is easy.  It was a hit even among our slightly varied group of tastes.  I will make this again for other gatherings.  oh, I omitted the green chiles.
