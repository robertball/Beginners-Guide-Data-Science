This is a great quick breakfast, especially for families with husband's who can't sit and eat breakfast on a regular basis. To make this ahead of time, I like to cook the eggs in well-greased muffin tins for a half hour, pop them out, cool them a bit and then build my sandwich. I wrap the pre-made sandwich in a papertowel and put it into a sandwich bag and refrigerate. When my husband is getting ready to walk out the door, all I have to do is take the sandwich out of the plastic bag and microwave it for a minute or so. NOTE: This also is good with those flat sausage patties and other kinds of sliced deli cheese.

Wonderful little breakfast sandwich that's great for "on the go"! Not to mention it's much better than going to a drive-thu! I made these individually vs. all eight at once. Grands biscuits store nicely in the fridge so I made these sandwiches as needed. I microwaved a scrambled egg in a pudding cup sprayed with Pam for about 35 seconds for each sandwich. All that's left to do was top with my favorite cheese and breakfast meat and this was perfect for my husband to take to work. This was so easy to make and and done in no time at all!

To those that wrote low rating responses.... It shouldn't matter to you if this seems obvious, it easy, or if it's not healthy. You should post Ratings based on how good the Recipe is! Make note if you must, that it could be made more healthy (and tell how you made it more healthy). Also keep in mind that not everyone who logs on to this site is an older person with cooking experience. They may be cooking something for the very first time.

These were really good! I can't believe I ever wasted $4 or so for a breakfast sandwich before work or on vacation. These tasted just as good for a fraction of the cost. I made 1/2 recipe, but found the sandwiches needed at least 1 egg per sandwich. So, the full recipe really needs like 8 eggs. To make it quickly, I used pre-cooked bacon. I just popped about 8-10 pieces in the microwave for 50 seconds for half the recipe. When I baked the biscuits I put them on a foil sheet and sprayed the sheet with Pam and the biscuits lightly also. It made them a little crispy and not so soft. Thanks, for showing me how absolutely easy these are really to make.

Nice for a really quick breakfast.  I microwave the eggs in a sprayed ramekin for about 1 minute.  Perfect for an on the go family.

I love it. It was really full filling which made me surprised. I was like this is McDonald's sandwich, but it's not. Your making it your own and see what goes in it. I didn't use precooked bacon, I fried up some and added little extra because it's bacon.

Great quick and easy breakfast- and easy to customize. We don't do eggs, so I added some blueberries to the biscuits, then used veggie sausage patties and some maple syrup and veggie cream cheese.

We really liked these sandwiches.  I did change this a little and used extra sharp cheddar rather than the American cheese called for.  I also put up some of these for breakfast during the week.  Wrapped them in paper towels so we can just pop them in the microwave and out the door.  Perfect!!!!

This is a super easy substitute for greasy fast food! Tastes great even for dinner. I added the 'Quick and Easy Home Fries' and sliced tomatoes. Big hit! Thank you for this recipe. I will be trying it again with different meats and toppings.

I didn't like the chemical taste these biscuits left in my mouth. Would be much better with homemade biscuits.

Very easy quick breakfast and family loves the Pillsbury biscuits!  My reservation on the 5th star is no information on scrambling the eggs.  Without a GREAT scrambled egg, it would lack the flavor and consistency.  I scramble my eggs with the bacon fat and fresh herbs and some of the shredded cheese with another slice in the sandwich.  This is a good recipe for camping as well!

I've made these so many times, and they are always a winner in my house! The Grands Biscuits are so perfect for these b/c they are just the right size, not too big and not too small. I like to make these just as written, but sometimes we sub out sausage for the bacon or add different things to the eggs...the possibilities are endless~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I used turkey bacon and added salt and pepper to the eggs. I didn't scramble, just poured onto the griddle, let it cook, cut it and folded for each sandwich.

I kept the grandgirls last night for a sleepover. They came up with the idea of having a breakfast party. So I decided to have Grands Ham and Cheese Melts, Grandwich Breakfast Sandwiches, and Grands Mini Pizzas. Grands for the Grands breakfast party was a hit! This sandwich was my favorite of all the recipes I made. It is versatile enough to be able to use any kind of cheese and to use sausage instead of bacon.

Nothing fancy here, just a quick and easy breakfast sandwich with good flavor...enough said.  Did two with bacon and two with turkey sausage and will be freezing a couple, so we'll see how they reheat.

This is a great, simple breakfast that's easily adapted to your household's tastes and needs.  We try not to eat a lot of meat in our house so I just made mine with some eggs and cheese (I didn't have sliced cheese, so I threw in some shredded cheese to the eggs while they were cooking!)  I also added just a touch of mayonnaise on my biscuit before building the sandwich.  Top with some salt and pepper and I had a tasty Sunday morning breakfast.  These would be good with a slice of tomato or maybe even some onions and/or bell peppers mixed into the eggs while they cook.

It's really hard to go wrong w/a biscuit, bacon, egg, and cheese...I took the advice of prior reviewer, Sarah Jo, and baked my eggs in muffin tins for easier eating.  This is easy to customize w/your choice of breakfast meats/cheeses.  I like to add peppers and onions to the egg to get a little veg w/breakfast.

I always keep on hand, frozen sausage patties and pre-cooked frozen egg patties on hand. For days where ya want a Sausage Egg and Cheese Biscuit without having to drive to a local fast food place. Always a plus with Grands Biscuits and in less then a 30 minute trip, hot and fresh and ready to go. The cost is a lot cheaper too. Always a keeper and an easy pleaser for breakfast dinners too! TY

I thought these were very good but my husband absolutely loved these.  He added jelly to his and gobbled them up in no time.

How can you go wrong with this? Texture is certainly better with regular bacon (not microwave/precooked). Delicious with a fried egg and cheddar cheese as well.

This is a nice breakfast sandwich.  There is something about this combination that is really pleasing.  If you omit any part, it seems lacking!  I used the Grands Golden Wheat Reduced Fat biscuit, and it was crusty on the outside and tender on the inside, the way a biscuit should be.  Not quite as good as homemade, though!

This was a very simple & easy recipe to get together.   It is just a basic breakfast sandwich, but, very convenient using canned biscuit dough.   Next time I make it I would just make a fried egg to put on the biscuit.  The scrambled eggs kept falling out of the biscuit.

Great for on the go for my boyfriend to take to work. He does not like scrambled eggs so I made these with fried eggs that turned out just as good IMO.

I made these for lunch, and while they were OK with just the addition of cheese, they begged for more to be added.  I would definitely add some condiments or some tasty vegetables to the sandwich.  I do like how easy they are to make.

This was pretty good, but I make something similar using an English Muffin off the griddle and we prefer our sandwiches with the muffins as opposed to the biscuits.  After putting the cheese on, I put them back in the oven for a moment to melt. I do my eggs the same way as Baking Nana-in a sprayed ramekin in the microwave for a minute, with a little salt and pepper beat in.  They come out fluffy, round, and the perfect size.

These tasted like the ones you get at McDonalds but much better!  These are not greasy like the others are and I was able to put the sausage I had on hand in them too!  This is already in my recipe box!    I will be sure to make these from now on.  A healthy breakfast that cand be made ahead???  Where have you been all my life? LOL

Bravo George! You tell 'em. If you want to make this healthier you could use English muffins and veggie sausage patties instead. That's my version. But, I don't think everyone is looking for a healthier version and I personally like them both.
