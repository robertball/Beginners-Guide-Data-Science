This is my recipe, so I wanted to be sure to tell people to leave the peels on the potatoes-it adds a great texture. Also, the potatoes should be the medium-sized reds Thanks so much and I hope you enjoy them!

Oh my gosh, even a woman can love these potatoes!  I had to adapt it a bit, though - we women have to watch our calories!  The changes I made:  increased the red onion to 1 cup (because my man and I love it!), used half regular mayo and half light, used light sour cream, added 1 T of garlic salt (I find that the light mayo needs a bit more salt than the regular kind), and a heaping T of minced garlic.  I used all regular bacon, but after trying this once - and being HIGHLY successful! - I think I could have gone with half turkey bacon and cut the fat down more.  I think I also could have used less regular mayo and more light.  Amazing what you can do with red potatoes! This recipe is a major keeper, congrats, Old Crow!!!!

My husband took a bite of this and said, "Mmm... impressive!"  They turned out very good.  I did make a few changes: I used mircle whip instead of mayo because we rarely have mayo in the house (we just prefer mircle whip), I used cheddar cheese instead of American because that's what I had on hand that needed to be used anyway, and instead of mixing the bacon in with the potoato mixture I sprinkled them on top and smothered a bit of the potato "sauce" on top of the bacon before adding the parm. cheese.  It's been my experience that baking bacon in with a dish makes the bacon very gooey and not crispy which is how I like it.  The only thing I will do different next time is cut up the potatoes a little smaller.  I cut them into approx. 1/4" slices then across four times each and I think they'd be better a little smaller, but that's just personal perference.  I will definately make this again.

Pretty simple potato recipe. I had to improvise with what I had on hand so I subbed a bit. I used about a cup of chopped turkey ham that I had hanging out in the fridge, plain yogurt in place of the mayo, used shredded extra sharp cheddar and added a tsp. of Frank's Hot Sauce and a tbsp. of Jack Daniel's dijon mustard. Smells great in the oven. I hope it's a hit with the three men I share a table with! WE ALL LOVED THIS.

These were really good.  I didn't have real bacon so I used bacon bits!  I used yellow onion instead of red.  Will make again...SOON!!!!!  Thanks for a great recipe, Old Crow!

We loved these!  I didn't want to cook bacon so I just tossed some real bacon bits into the sauce.  I also didn't add onions, because my boyfriend and I aren't fans.  I didn't have any American cheese, but I had about half a bag of shredded Mexican cheese and half a bag of Colby Jack cheese.  I was a little worried that I might be messing with the flavor, but it ended up being delicious!  I also just baked the potatoes for a little over an hour since I already had a roast in the oven, instead of cooking them before adding them to the cheese sauce and then baking. them

Most excellent.  Everyone loved them and said they were better than twice baked potatoes.  I used cheddar cheese and small multi variety potatoes (black, red, white and yellow) and cut them in half.  Used baking grease to season my pan.  The "dressing" didn't look like there was enough to mix through the potatoes, so I just put dollops across the entire mixture to sink in while it baked.

This was very good. Be careful not to overcook the potatoes in the beginning. I cooked a bit too far and they broke apart a bit. The flavor was still heavenly.

I took this recipe and did my own thing with it. I was making it for my whole family so I used 5 lbs of potatoes and 48 slices of American cheese, as well as about 2 cups of sour cream and instead of bacon (since i did not have any) I used Turkey Sausage (1 lb) My whole family DEVOURED them (3 sons and a husband) And I had leftovers that were gone by the next day!! To make the mixing of the ingredients easier and more equal I put it in my blender a little at a time to really grate up the slices of cheese well and mixed well throughout. This is a great recipe. I will make it again, but it sure is fattening  so it will be a SPECIAL OCCASION dish. Thanks for the WONDERFUL recipe!!!!

This was an easy & tasty recipe!  I used cheddar instead of American (personal taste) and I put the bacon on top so it wouldn't get mushy.  I added some cajun blackened seasoning for a little zip & it came out great.  My husband really liked these potatoes so I guess the title fits, lol.

I'm not a fan of potatoes, but my husband definitely is.  So I gave this recipe a whirl and loved it.  First of all the recipe was scaled down to 3 servings, which was just right for the 2 of us, plus a serving of leftovers.  I used Russets rather than red potatoes and cooked them until they were barely tender.  I doubled the sauce and it was just right for the amount of potatoes and eye balled the amount of bacon, red onion, cheddar cheese, and parm. After 40 minutes in the oven, these potatoes were cooked to perfection, bubbly and a beautiful golden brown, not to mention down right tasty.  This one's a keeper!  Thanks for sharing your recipe Old Crow.

Okay, seriously everyone loves this recipe. I make it at all my gatherings. Even people who don't like potatoes love this recipe. I alway get requests for the recipe. I make this exactly as stated, except I use cheddar instead of American cheese.

I cooked these potatoes tonight for dinner and I had to get on here right away to let you know how amazing this dish is! I fell in love with it before it was even finish cooking. The only thing I did differently was the way of cutting the potatoes.. in stead of just slicing them 1/4in think i cut them in differnt thicknesses and different shapes only because it was easier to chop them, But other than that no changes. This is now my favorite potato dish!! thanks for sharing!!

Very good. I forgot to add the sour cream!  I added milk to the sauce to make it creamier and easier to spread. Then I figured out Why i had to do that- forgot the sour cream!  That being said  and sans sour cream these came out great. Doubled the recipe and assembled  it a day ahead of time and baked before serving.

Awesome! I used russet potatoes and doubled the mixture as suggested in another review. I also substituted the cheese in mixture with shredded Velveeta, topped with cheddar cheese and real bacon bits. The next time I will sprinkle green onion over the top after baking; and there will be a next time, starting with this year's Thanksgiving.

I must've done something wrong!  These potatoes were very tasty, and hubs loved them, hence the 4 stars.  But the presentation was lacking.....the mayo and sour cream seemed to have curdled.  Could've been my fault since I didn't boil the potatoes first.  I'll definitely try this again using the stated directions, though.

These were the best! Great flavor. I didn't have bacon on hand, so I cooked up a pound of hamburger and added it in. This made it a great "one pot" meal. Kudos!

I read the reviews and halved the garlic and onion powder, as I thought I wouldn't like that much, and I omitted the bacon entirely. Turned out fabulously, delicious and exactly what I was looking for: more than just fried potatoes and yet not so rich as the usual cheesy potato recipe. Thank you, Old Crow for a "keeper" recipe that I will use often, just with a few preference changes.

GREAT recipe!  I used the grease from frying the bacon to grease the pan.  Everyone loved these potatoes - I did leave the peels on the potatoes and it worked perfectly!  No peeling - yea!!  My dad had thirds with his dinner and my husband was picking more out of the pan even after he said how he couldn't eat another bite!  ;-)  Thank you!

Made these last night for dinner. So yummy. Made two changes. I forgot to get bacon so I put smoked sausage on the bottom of the pan and put the potato mixture on top. Also we are not huge onion fans do instead i sprinkled a little dehydrated onion flakes in with the seasonings. Wow. Will make this again.

This had great flavor.  Living in Tanzania, I had to substitute.  Since mayo is very expensive, I used about 1.5 cups homemade sour cream and 1/2 cup mayo.  The skins on the potatoes are VERY dirty so I always remove them. We had only thick collar bacon available at the time but it was delicious in there. The leftovers were even better! We will make this again and again and again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Instead of American cheese, I used the shredded mexican blend of cheese. At first it was really good, but when it cooled the cheese got hard and crunchy. I didn't like the cheese, but my husband did. I would recomend following the recipe for the cheese.

This would have been much better without the mayonaisse!!! It made the dish greasy/oily and made the cheese curdle. I will try it with cream of potatoe or cream of chicken next time.

I really like the idea of pre-cooking the potatoes before baking the whole thing. I have had trouble in the past getting them done all the way through when I don't do that.

These are AWESOME!! I used Colby & Monterey Jack rather than American (just my preference) and don't regret it, it tasted amazing. I feel like you could pretty much use any cheese and it would come out good. I cut the recipe in half but used the full amount of cheese, I'd recommend that to those who like it cheesy like me! I thought the spices worked very well with the potatoes, it's such a simple dish but the spices really made it pop! Emailed the recipe to my dad right after trying it because I know it's right up his alley. Will be having this again for sure!!

Didn't have any sour cream or onions in the house but I did have some French Onion Chip Dip. (so I also omitted the onion powder) Worked out perfectly. I also skipped the bacon, it doesn't really need it.
Kids said "Make that again please"

Everyone in my family loved this dish. I omitted the onions because my sons do not like onions in their potatoes. Leaving the onions out did not diminish the flavor at all. It came out delicious. I will be using this in my side dish rotation.

I wanted an au gratin potato but didn't have any heavy cream.  This recipe really did the trick.  Very good!  I used 4 Cheese Mexican shredded cheese and like another user, crumbled the bacon on the top when I baked it.  

I also sauteed the onions in butter before I added them to the mixture.

Very delicious take on simple potatoes.  Like the others i too made a few adjustments: 1. Used reduced fat mayo; 2. Used bacon bits (real bacon would've probably made it even more awesome); 3. Used minced fresh garlic; 4. Used Cheddar Cheese ; 5. Used russet potatoes.   All and all the recipe would've been great unaltered, but was still amazing.

I loved it.  I did a little substituting but it still came out great! Instead of sour cream I used coconut milk, and I added a little ground thyme.  Finally I used a three cheddar cheese mix. This is definitely going into my dinner repertoire! Thanks for the recipe!

I'm getting ready to make this for the 4th time.  I get lots of compliments each time I make them - kids, men, women all love them.  They never turn out dry as another reviewer stated. Excellent recipe with lots of possibilities if you want to add a few things to make it your own!

I gave this recipe a 2 star rating only because the flavor itself was good. However, these were the dryest potatoes ever. I followed the recipe exactly (omiting the final sprinkle of parmesean cheese on top because I find it makes dishes too salty). The picture for this recipe made them look very saucey. Mine were so dry that near the end of the cooking time I added another cup of sour cream and some milk to the potatoes and they were still dry. Will not be making these potatoes again.

"Very impressive!" That's what my brother said as he got up for seconds. This was absolutely delicious. For some reason I couldn't find red potatoes and ended up using Yukon golden potatoes instead. I followed the advice of others and topped it with bacon towards the end. I did add real bacon bits into the mix and I am glad I did. I will be making this for many years to come.  Thanks for sharing!!

This is a great base for almost a twice-baked potato casserole, without all the scooping of baking potatoes.  I used what I had on hand, subbed 2 Tbsp dried chives for the red onion (not a red onion fan) and used cheddar instead of American cheese.  Also had shredded parm cheese instead of grated.  I haven't baked it yet, but I tasted the mixture and it tastes like a winner :)  If for some reason it turns out catastrophic I will update my review.

Made these last night and they were a huge hit.  Really nice flavour and there we no leftovers in the pan.  Was a bit concerned that it might be too thick and gooey, but it cooked up beautifully and tasted great.

Great, easy recipe, am  going to make it again for church Thanksgiving dinner.  Used medium and sharp cheddar cheeses, and Yukon Gold potatoes I had on hand.  Also skipped the bacon, but will use it in future.

I made this recipe for a group of 20 men.  I doubled the recipe and they ate every last bit of it.  This is a winner!

Loved this recipe.  I think next time I would increase the mayo, sour cream by at least half and heat it mildly before adding to the potatoes. This way all will be coated.  I didn't mix my potatoes into the mixture as directed, because I preferred a neater presentation of the dish.  All in all, a keeper!!

I made these when the kids came over for dinner  one time and now they’re requested for every get together. 
The only thing I have done differently is add more bacon, because you can never have too much bacon.

Was delicious and a big hit although I did use a shredded cheese blend rather than american cheese.  I have also made this by switching out the mayo and sour cream for 1 cup of creme fraiche and 1/2 cup sour cream - also delicious.

This was really, really, good. My whole family liked it even my wife, who doesn’t like onions. I only had russet potatoes, cheddar cheese and real bacon bits available, but it was still awesome! I will definitely make this again. Looking forward to the next potluck.

I doubled this recipe and put it together the night before.  On BBQ day I put it in the oven and let it cook away until it was brown and bubbly.  Everyone loved it and all the left overs (there weren't many) got gobbled up the next day.  This one is a keeper for sure.

Ok. Changes I made... partly due to what I had on hand and partly to the fact I can't stand to cook with mayonnaise. Used four mid-size russet potatoes and a whole yellow onion. Instead of mayo and sour cream, I used cream of chicken/mushroom soup and enough milk to make 12 oz.  Also, used a full pack of cooked and well-drained bacon. There was a goof that turned out good... I used garlic powder, but messed up and grabbed garlic salt instead of onion powder. Ended up giving it the perfect amount of salt and I happen to really like garlic, so it was good! Will be making this again!

These were very flavorful and relatively quick. I did omit the bacon (too lazy to cook bacon). A bit heavy on the onion, but still delish. Made everything the night before; Cut and boiled  the potatoes and prepped the ‘dressing.’  Then I just assembled and baked it the day of. Turned out great! Will make again.

Absolutely fantastic! Made these for my boyfriend to take to “Friendsgiving” and they were the first thing gone. My potato hating man even devoured his helping! I (almost) doubled the sauce and used half sour cream/half French onion dip as suggested by other users and I really liked the blend. I also cut my potatoes a bit thicker so they could stand up to sitting in the fridge overnight. Love, love, love these potatoes and this recipe is now in permanent rotation.

I followed the recipe as written. Flavor was good, but it was way too oily. Swimming in oil. Everyone liked it but would only take a very small serving because they were rightfully scared off by the oil. If I make it again I'll use less mayo and find lower fat substitutes.

I took a half cup of mayonnaise and 1 cup of sour cream and added the garlic and onion powders, seasoned salt and the pepper and stirred up all together. I spooned a layer of that "sauce" into the bottom of my baking dish followed by a layer of potatoes. Then I sprinkled a layer of cheese, then crumbled up bacon and then some sliced green onions. Then I spooned more "sauce", a layer of potatoes and then cheese. Then I added some grated Parmesan and then a layer of bacon and finally some green onions again. It's now one of our families favorite dishes!

My husband is still raving about this dish! We made it for Christmas Eve to serve along with our ham, and it was a very good choice. The combination of cheese and bacon is a winner, and we even coated the casserole dish with bacon drippings which gave it even more bacon-y goodness! 
I like a creamier style, so I put a dollop of sour cream on top of my wedges when I ate them as leftovers.

Thanks Old Crow! We'll be making this again!

Delicious!  The mixture of mayonnaise and sour cream adds a nice tang that makes this dish a huge hit.  I've added this to our regular meals and have passed the recipes to the many who have asked.  Well done and thanks for sharing.

This is now my "go-to" recipe for a side dish!!  I made a few adjustments.  I used an onion and a couple of garlic cloves, rather than the onion and garlic salt.  I also added MORE cheese... you can't go wrong with more cheese!!!  I used 2 C of Colby Jack, some triple cheddar and parmesan.  GREAT dish

This is the best scalloped potato recipe I have ever made.  I halved it since there are only two of us, and had to substitute three ingredients:
I used Cottage Cheese instead of sour cream.
I used processed cheese and Italian blend cheese.
I used yellow onion instead of red.

When I mixed it up, it was WAY to thick to 'stir in' the potatoes or to 'pour' into the baking dish; it was more the consistency of stiff bread dough, so I added a bit more cottage cheese and mayonnaise, and then added enough half-and-half to make it just a BIT thinner.  Also, to keep them from breaking up in the still stiff mixture, I pulled the potatoes before they were completely tender and baked the finished dish a little longer to get them done.

The flavor was fantastic, and this is now MY  scalloped potato recipe!!

I made this recipe for my husband and some guests and WOWZERS! It was absolutely delicious.  The only thing I did was added fresh minced garlic in place of garlic powder. After that simple mod I followed it verbatim. Our guests were highly pleased with the dish as we were too. Just beware...its addicting. One serving is hard to contain yourself to. We served these potatoes with roasted veggies, filet mignon - rare, and a bottle of merlot. Divine!
Thank you Old Crow for sharing your recipe!

Everyone in our house loves potatoes and I'm always looking for new recipes to try.  I  substituted pepper jack cheese (what I already had on hand) for the American cheese (and added a little more than the recipe called for - gotta love cheese!) and it was delicious!  This is definitely one of our favorites!

This is by far the best dish for potlucks. I've been making it many years for Boy Scout, 4-H and every other potluck where there are lots of kids and parents. There are never any leftovers and its easy to remember the ingredients and direct people to allrecipes. I no longer measure ingredients, because I make it using a bag of red potatoes, a whole package of bacon, store-brand miracle whip, a whole bag of shredded sharp cheddar. You really can't make it too saucy! I purchase all ingredients at Aldi. I think it's a combination of the seasonings, red onion, red potatoes and bacon that really makes it stand out. It's also great heated up later. For presentation I like to add extra crumbled bacon in top. Just seeing bacon entices people to try it. Once they try it... They fall in love.

This was so easy and so good. The only thing I did different was I used 1&1/2 cups of sour cream, 1/2 cup Mayonnaise, & about 2ozs of Velveeta. I put bacon, parmesan, and cheddar on top.Everyone at church loved it!

This was a wonderful way to use up all of my potatoes I had laying around.  I didn't have garlic powder so I substituted the powder and salt with just 1 tbsp. of garlic salt.  I will half this next time but everyone loved it.  Personal preference is all.  I also added parsley for some color.  I made 15 lbs, which made 2 large 9x12 dishes.  I shared with neighbors.

This was good, I forgot the bacon when i went grocery shopping so I'll have to try it again with bacon next time. But I would recommend cutting out some salt. It was a bit too salty for me. Plus I have a picky eater which loves potatoes but hated this recipe because I didn't peel the potatoes. So I will peel them next time around. but other than that it was good! Thanks!!

Not bad, extremely rich . . .but a quick glance at the ingredients will tell you that.  I left off the Parmesan and did not boil the potatoes.  Which, admittedly, made for an extremely long cooking time (almost 2 hours) but dirtied one less dish.  I switched the sour cream and mayo amounts (and used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream) and didn't even notice. As others have mentioned, it sort of curdles in the dish.  Doesn't change the taste, just looks a tad funny.  I'd argue you could cut the mix back by 1/4 and be perfectly fine.  I do think I prefer a roux and Au Gratin potatoes, but these were fun to try.  Thanks for the recipe.

Everyone including the five men at our table loved this recipe. I have since served it to others, and it is always a requested recipe. One change I made is to crumble bacon on top instead of incorporating into ingredients.  This keeps bacon crisp with adds texture.  FYI I have recently begun to try this with other recipes that use bacon, including baked beans.  The difference is amazing as the bacon does not become soft but maintains the crunchy texture which is so appealing to the palate.

Thank you, Old Crow for this recipe! We did make some changes (low-fat Mayo, low-fat Cream, and Cheddar not American cheese), but it was SO good! (Oh, and yes, I bought "real" bacon bits instead of cooking bacon. We had this for Thanksgiving and there were no leftovers!

o good lord, spent twenty years looking for this.  preference changes to suggest:
 drop the mayo and increase sour cream, or use blue cheese dressing or 
 poppy seed dressing - have done all three
  double the onions and followed other folks suggestions about adding green onions as well.
  double the bacon, have done it with ham as well.  
 I use russets, since thats what we raise.
 garlic is not used in my family, I have sprinkled some dried dill, which our family likes.  
  the sharpest cheddar i can find for the cheese.

I loved this, and so did the people at the cookout I took it to! I used mozzarella because I had it on hand, and romano instead of grated parmesan, and added some green onion to the top in addition to the onion that is baked in. Next time I'm going to use some pepper jack cheese mixed with some Mexican shred and add a bit more cayenne to spice it up since I won't be trying to please a crowd ha ha - I like my potatoes with some heat to them! I can think of a lot of good variations on this to keep it changing up all the time. Thanks for a great recipe!

Super yummy! I made a few minor substitutions only because I thought I had the items in the fridge and I didn't want to go to the market while I was cooking. I traded the same amount sour cream for milk. Also since I had no garlic powder nor onion powder I put garlic salt. To balance the extra salt I chose the largest potatoes in the bag and didn't drain the potatoes too long. Maybe the milk helped the most because they didn't come out over salted. Thanks AllRecipes!

These were really good!  I made them with ribeye steaks and coconut shrimp which was a nice accompaniment.  My man was so focused on these potatoes that he didn't even finish his steak or shrimp and kept complimenting the potatoes!  The easiest thing to make out of everything by the way!  Anyway, this dish certainly lived up to its name in my house! Thank you!

I made this for a family reunion. A big hit!! I followed advice of others and cut down the garlic, but I probably would have liked it with the full amount. I added a few bacon bits to the top before baking, more as a visual effect which made it an eye catcher. All I can say is glad I was in first half of line because the last  few did not get a very big taste.

These sure pleased my men! I subbed non fat yogurt for the mayo as I often do with no difference in taste I don't believe.  Also added some minced green onions and extra sharp cheddar towards the end.  Thank you Old Crow!!

Tasted Great! I didn't add the bacon because we ate it as a side dish to a pork roast.  I also didn't boil the potatoes first.  I was running short on time so I put the sliced potatoes and onion in the microwave for 10 minutes. Will make again!

I prepared the recip exactly as listed, and the garlic is WAY too strong- it overpowers everything else. I think it might be perfect if the garlic powder were reduced to maybe 1 tsp...maybe even 1/2 tsp...skip the onion powder altogether and increase the red onion to 3/4 c...I think its worth a shot - bc when I read the recipe it sounded marvelous.

absolutely everyone at my gathering said I have to bring them every time.  The only thing that I changed was that I used 6 15 oz cans of potatoes to cut down on time.  I'm sure with the red skin potatoes it would rate a 6!

Great recipe. I didn't have any mayo so I used miracle whip, which blended with the sour cream marvelously. I myself used Bacon bits, which overpowered the recipe a bit, but that's my own fault for not having actual bacon, and they still made the dish GREAT.

Very good! I took anothers suggestion and added a little franks redhot and dijon and also doubled the onion. I made it up earlier in the day then later just had to pop it into the oven. My husband really did enjoy them and went back for a second big helping. I used fat free sour cream and sharp cheddar cheese.

I liked the texture and the taste was pretty good.  I didn't add the onion. I thought the onion powder and garlic powder was a little strong.  Actually, now that I think about it, EVERYTHING was strong except the bacon.  This is a very flavorful and bold dish. Overall, this was an interesting dish but I will not be making it again.

These are some of the best potatoes I ever tasted! The only thing I change was adding 1 cup of sour cream instead of only a half and crumbling the bacon over the top instead of mixing in.  I made this for a Sunday barbeque and there was nothing left of it!

OH MY GOODNESS !!! Yum, Yum.  My son tasted it before it even went in the oven and suggested using it as a potato salad recipe. Good call !!  Would add chopped celery for that.  Also great w/out potatoes for a chip dip and it hardly takes any time to meld flavors.  Thanks

These potatoes are VERY rich, almost too rich.  The first couple of bites were really good, but after that it was a little to much.  I think I am going to try to make them again with a little less sauce.

I was afraid of too much mayo so I did 3/4 cup sour cream and 3/4 cup mayo. My husband also did the prep work while I was at work and thought I said scalloped potatoes so he peeled and cut the super thin with my kitchen aid mixer attachment. They needed to be thicker, my fault. I worried about the amount of onion and garlic powder but it turned out great and not over seasoned in the least.

We loved this recipe. I made it for a large family dinner and it got rave reviews from everyone. We used light mayo, cheddar chease, and fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder. It was just like eating a loaded potato. We will definetely be making this dish again soon.

The family loved this. I made a few changes. We had no bacon, and I forgot to add the ham, so we added a 1/4 cup of crushed ritz crackers. We doubled the potatoes because they were small, and it was a little dry. We added cheddar instead of American cheese, and instead of the parmesan cheese we crumbled some cheezits on top. It was wonderful! It had a very strong garlic flavor which I love. We will definitely make this again!

This turned out excellent.  My family cleaned the entire dish and wanted more.  I did saute the onions before adding them, but other than that, I followed the recipe.  Will definitely make again.
