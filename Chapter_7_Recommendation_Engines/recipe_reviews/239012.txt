Yummmm! Great recipe the way it is.  I think the next time I make these I'll use brown sugar to sweeten it a little more.  Also a sweet cream cheese drizzle on top may just work or dust with confectioners sugar.   

Thank you for the treat!

This is an amazing and easy to make recipe! Delicious! I did add a few things however just because I thought it would improve upon the "pumpkin" flavor profile. And it did! I just added 1/2 tsp ground ginger, 1/2 tsp. ground allspice, and 1 tsp of vanilla extract.  I also used leftover pumpkin puree that I had made up for a pumpkin pie rather than a can. If you which to use "fresh pumpkin" 15oz was just about two cups worth. If not can is fine, I just had extra. And no the extra water in the puree did not  make the muffins "soupy."  Finally I substituted 1 cup chocolate chips with 1/2 cup chopped pecans and 1/2 cup craisins simply because my boyfriend is not a big fan of chocolate.  I hope this helps! I will be making another batch very soon! Oh and PS: If you are using deep "muffin tins" vs. Shallow cupcake tins that fit cup cake paper you may have to double the cooking time.

Delicious! A perfect texture and height. It would be amazing with some cream cheese batter mixed in (swirled) I used leftover coffee for the liquid and omitted the dry coffee granules and water. I also added vanilla. I will definitely use this recipe again.

These are amazing!  I used whole wheat flour, brown sugar and my homemade pumpkin puree.  I also left out the chocolate chips. They don't need changes but I experimented the second time. I only used two eggs and added 1/2 cup applesauce, 1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt,  1/4 cup oil and added turbinado sugar on the tops before baking. It wasn't needed but made a crispy top.  Still delicious. Just made these for at least the 5th time. Used coconut oil.  Just as delicious as the first time!!

It was full of too much pumpkin and it didn't see to ever be fully cooked. I added extra time and they never 'muffin'd up' so to speak.

i made these delicious muffins. the instant coffee intrigued me and while not discernable as coffee flavour added some depth. i used half whole wheat and half white flour and instead of chocolate chips, i added a half cup each of pumpkin seeds, chopped walnuts and golden raisins. instead of 24 small muffins, i made 12 huge ones.  i had to cook them quite a bit longer ~ 30 minutes than the recommended 20-25. Especially at 325 degrees they needed extra time. i will absolutely make these again!

I made as directed, including the chocolate chips (in my opinion, chocolate is never optional), but I cut all the ingredients in half since I was trying to use up some leftover pumpkin and only had one cup. Instead of muffins, I poured it all in a large loaf pan and made bread instead. Since I didn't have a bake time, I just kept an eye on it. It was wonderful! Coffee flavor was subtle but added a nice depth with the chocolate. A keeper for sure!

I'll definitely make these again. They came out moist and delicious. I added chopped walnuts instead of the chocolate chips, and this morning I sadly ate my last one. Time for another batch!

They were heavy. I prefer something a little fluffier. 5 stars for taste, 1 star for texture and functionality.

I make this gluten free and reduced sugar. I use 2 cups of oatmeal flour and 1.5 cups of Pamelas all purpose artisan rice blend flour. I use 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of stevia. My wife likes these, it is very hard to find gluten free that has both good taste and a texture that does not fall apart or is gritty. I also leave out the chocolate chips.

Only change I made was replacing half the oil with applesauce, but if I made again I would cut back the coffee powder to 3T as it seemed a bit too strong.\

I used half turbinado sugar, half whole wheat and half of the cloves substituted ginger. It was fantastic!  I also made half the batch with pecans so definitely a bit more "crunchy". Also found an orange zest glaze that was really good with them. Enjoy!

Fabulous recipe.  Cut the sugar in half and they were still sweet and spicy.  So yummy.  Will make these my go-to pumpkin muffins!
