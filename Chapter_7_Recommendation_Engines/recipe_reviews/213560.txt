I found this recipe this AM and decided to try it for a late AM breakfast for DH and me.  I have to tell you, I can NOT wait to make these for the kids when they come to visit. Totally delicious, easy.  I mixed a bit of maple syrup into some strawberry preserves to top the pancakes.  Awesome! I didn't think to take a photo until I realized there were none left to photograph.  silly gramma. Thanks for sharing!

Followed this recipe exact, only using lowfat buttermilk instead of skim. Did not overmix the batter, let it sit for a good five minutes so that the oats could soak up some of the liquid and thicken a bit. Pancakes were a bit flat, but flavorful. Both my kids loved them. Husband thought it could use a little more peanut butter. I'll make these again.

My kids love oatmeal, peanut butter and pancakes. So this recipe was a great find! I made it as directed, except I used whole milk and may have added more like 1/4 cup peanut butter. I let the batter sit for five minutes to allow the oatmeal to absorb the liquids before I cooked them on the griddle.

My kids LOVED them! We made them for dinner, then had leftovers and made another batch in the morning. Super recipe, and I like that it is packed full of protein and nutrients from the oatmeal, milk and eggs too.

I tried these this morning.. i used milk instead of skim milk and the batter came up a little thin, so i added more flour. I also added more peanut butter because i love peanut butter. i used boysenberry instead of strawberry preserves and it was Delicious..  I definitely will try this again (with skim milk this time)

These pancakes were delicious and my kids gobbled them up. I used 1 1/2 cups of 1% milk instead of the skim and added an extra tbs of peanut butter.

My husband and I both love these.  I have done it with and without the PB.  I do add a teaspoon of Vanilla.  Just because I love it..  and I do add chocolate chips to the last half of the batter...  Soo good..

Peanut Butter & Jelly Pancakes Haiku: "PBJ pancake! Needs more peanut butter though. A fun breakfast treat." Made these as written, and wow did they smell good; I just wish they had more peanut butter taste! I warmed the strawberry jelly so that it would drizzle nicely, but I think when I make these again, besides increasing the PB, I think I'd rather bananas and perhaps a squirt of chocolate syrup on top. Now THAT's a decadent breakfast!

Very good!  I added a little more peanut butter, and then a little more flour to thicken up the batter, but otherwise made as directed.  Since I was making for my 15 month old, instead of adding jelly, I added fresh blackberries to the batter.    Very unique twist on pancakes - I'll definitely make again!

These are excellent.  I subbed honey in for the sugar and added a little extra peanut butter.  I topped them with a dollop of fat free vanilla yogurt.  All four of my children love these and one of them isn't usually a pancake eater.  These are a little chewy but I feel that the texture added to the flavour instead of detracting from it.  My husband calls them stick-to-your-ribs pancakes.

Exactly as written, the batter turns out very runny (I made a test pancake, which turned out flat--even for a pancake).  I added about 1/4 cup of ground golden flaxseed and allowed the batter to sit for 15 minutes and that firmed it enough.  I topped them with warm strawberry-rhubarb jam.  My daughters loved them, and I'll make them again with the flaxseed.  Finely diced peanuts would also be a good addition and would help boost the peanut flavor.

I was really loooking forward to these pancakes. They smelled delicious while preparing, but anything with peanut butter does. The cooked product had a funky texture and not much taste at all. Probably won't be making these again.

We eat a lot of pancakes, so I like looking for different variations.  We thought these were so-so:  Definitely edible but not memorable.  We probably won't add these to our pancake rotation.

These were great! Only change was to use egg substitute for the eggs, and I only had seedless raspberry preserves on hand.  I actually mixed my ingredients quite a bit, but then let the batter stand for about ten minutes.  My pancakes came out nice and thick and fluffy, but there certainly was a different texture from regular pancakes due to all the oats - a little chewier, I guess I'd say (not a bad thing at all, in fact I liked that aspect of these).  The pancakes themselves were not sweet at all, and I think at first I wished I had increased the sugar to about a tablespoon.  I microwaved the preserves so they would drizzle better, and used quite a bit so of course that made up for any lack of sweetness.  I think this would be a great special occasion breakfast for kids with some chocolate chips added to the batter, topped with sliced bananas and drizzled with chocolate sauce!

Ok, I made it exactly as the recipe asked. They did fluff up to about half an inch, and I was hopeful.  The consistency of the batter was actually thicker than I expected, too. They cook well, and take a little longer to bubble. However, the finished product had a thicker eggy kind of texture that did not convince me that it had cooked through. I like custardy type textures, but I am not sure I like it for pancakes. I wonder if anyone else can relate. The flavor was light, too.

I highly recommend putting the oats and WARM milk together, let sit 5 min, then add the rest of the wet ingredients as listed. Then finish off by not stirring too much.  It makes for a lovely, more moist pancakes (that is great to warm up for leftovers if one or two are leftover). I usually make 3 x of this recipe for my 5 kids. As for the jam: put it in a saucepan with 2 tbsp water to the 1/4 c jam and bring up to the point where the jam melts into the water (about a simmer). More of a lovely syrup to soak into those pancakes without cooling them down.

These are very filling pancakes, and pretty good.  I have to say I wasn't thrilled with the 2 cups of milk, and if I make them again I'm not putting that much in.  I'd try 1 cup and go from there--I really didn't have time, like other reviewers, to wait 10 or 15 min for the milk to absorb into the oatmeal, so I ended up with oatmeal in the middle and flimsy pancakes on the end.  the taste was pretty good, though, so I might try these again.  I liked the idea of using bananas as a topper (from some of the pictures), so I did that and melted the jam in the microwave so it acted more like a syrup.  Good pancakes, thank you.

I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the wet ingredients, and 1-2 TBS of mini chocolate chips with the dry. I let the batter sit, but they still came out a little runny. Next time I will reduce the milk to 3/4 c.  My boys ate them just fine, but the consensus was: not their favorite.

Not nearly peanut-buttry enough.

Mine came out a bit too floppy for my taste, but that could have been just a me problem.
It wasn't bad it just....wasn't good

Really good! My wife thought it could use a little more sugar, but I think she was thinking of peanut butter cookies. Once you top them with jelly or jam they are plenty sweet. I used natural peanut butter (4 heaping tablespoons). If you use a commercial brand there will be more sugar.

We loved everything about this recipe. My husband is a great pancake lover but wasn't keen on leaving the "traditional" pancakes behind. He's a convert now! I used 2% milk and cherry preserves as that's what I had. Delicious.

These pancakes came out great! I did alter some of the ingredients, however. For the sugar, I used agave syrup, and for the butter, I used applesauce instead, to make the recipe a little more healthy, although it's quite nutritious as is. Also, I added a bit more peanut butter than recommended. You could definitely taste the peanut butter in the pancakes. What's good about these pancakes is that they're lower in carbs and higher in protein, which is definitely a plus. I'll definitely be adding these to my pancake rotation!

I really wanted to like this recipe, but these just didn't taste like peanut butter pancakes.  The texture was good - nice and thick, and I liked the addition of oatmeal (although not everyone did).  However, we couldn't taste the peanut butter at all, and that was after increasing it like other reviewers suggested.  These aren't bad pancakes, but if you're specifically looking for peanut butter pancakes, they really don't live up to the name.

It was fairly good. Could have done without the oats but it gave it a "crunchy peanut butter" texture. However, it was a tasty breakfast treat!

I made two changes based on the other reviews.  I cut the milk (1%) to 1 1/2 cups.  I also increased the peanut butter to 1/4 cup.  The pancaked cooked up fat and brown.  The results were so good even my picky 16 month-old liked them.  We didn't have strawberry jam, so we just used syrup.  One warning--if you are looking for a pancake with a traditional consistency, this is not for you.  These pancakes are thicker and heavier than their traditional cousins--perfect for a warm, filling evening meal.

This is a great recipe. The first time I made these, I think that I mixed too long and cooked on too high a heat. The second time they came out perfect. Everyone loved them with strawberry preserves and maple syrup. They are not sweet AT ALL so you want to add something sweet on top. Delish!

I have made this several times now and it is a hit with my homemade strawberry syrup! I cut the milk by almost half though because it was way to thin and we like a thicker heartier pancake. I also added a lot more peanut butter ;)

We love to make this recipe and put banana slices on the pancakes before we flip them instead of using jelly. They are so good and so filling!

These are delicious! After reading other reviews I used 4 tbps of peanut butter instead of 3 and I let the batter sit for 5 minutes so it could thicken. We ate them with black raspberry jam instead of strawberry because that was all we had on hand. Also tried a few with butter and syrup and they were good. Will definitely make these again!

I made this without the sugar, changed the all purpose flour  to whole wheat flour, and used soy milk instead of cow's milk. These are good.  Jam or jelly can be used on these, so I used jelly!
