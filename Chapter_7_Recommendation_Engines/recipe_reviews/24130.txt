This was great!  What a wonderful idea.  I had some leftover wheat french bread and i sliced it into 1 inch slices.  I made it in my stoneware 9x13 baker and it came out really well.  One thing i would strongly suggest is to add CINNAMON to the egg mixture....what's french toast without cinnamon?!

Yhis is excellent and so easy.  I made 2 for Christmas morning - one with cinnamon raisin bread, and one with cranberry orange bread,  They were both delicious - not a crumb left.  This will be a new tradition for holiday brunches!

A bit too sweet.  I had the bread in the fridge for about 10 hours (overnight) and it was too soggy.  Next time I'll cut the sugar back and leave in fridge for an hour.

Simple and Fantastic.  My husband visited Alaska and told me about the BEST overnight french toast he had and bought me the recipe back from the cook:)  The recipe is exactly the same except I invert the pan when it is done cooking onto a serving platter and the syrup/sauce doesn't cause it to harden in the pan and it looks pretty to present dusted with powder sugar and toasted coconut.  I have make this about 25 times for company and holidays, a MUST to eat!!!  Thanks

I've been looking for a good "soak overnight, bake in the morning"
French toast recipe.  It was very convenient to simply pop it in the 
oven, and the tops of the slices browned and crisped very nicely.
However, the lower half of every slice was a soggy mess.  The butter
and brown sugar layer at the bottom tasted great, a nice alternative
to serving with syrup, but I would cut the amounts by half next time.  
Also, I'd leave out at least one egg.  I substituted maple syrup 
for the corn syrup for a richer flavor.

I didn't care for this recipe that much, but the four guys I live
with all gave it rave reviews...go figure!  So we'll probably try it
again, with a few modifications.

I followed the recipe pretty exactly, and it was good, but it does harden fast in the pan.  The thickness and stickiness of the caramel sauce made it hard to eat the last few bites (as it cooled a little).  This was good, but there are recipes for similar dishes that I enjoy much more on this site.

This tastes great.  But, don't let it cool in the pan too long.  The bottom will turn rock hard after about and hour or two.

Normally after we open our gifts on Christmas morning, we grab a quick bite and then rush around getting ready to spend the day with family and friends. To my hubby and children's delight, I made an executive decision to have Christmas at home. Everyone asked me to make a huge breakfast and this recipe was part of my menu. I can't tell you how much this was loved! I used challah bread, only soaked for about an hour and a half, didn't use the corn syrup, added lots of cinnamon and because I had it around for the holiday, I replaced the milk with eggnog. Once done, I turned the  casserole upside down onto a dish. The caramalized sauce ran all down the sides and looked really pretty. Thanks Sarah for a great recipe that didn't even taste like french toast; more like a very yummy gooey pastry. Delicious!

I found this recipe after I couldn't find my mother's recipe for Skiiers French Toast....I love this recipe!  There were many complaints about this recipe, but I didn't have any problems.  Here are some things I did do that weren't clear in the directions....I used the whole loaf of bread making a double layer.  I doubled the syrup recipe, pouring most of it on the bottom and a little in between layers, but not using all of it just in case it would be too sweet.  I did not time the baking, I just kept checking on it while the kids opened their Christmas presents, but I really don't think it took too much time....maybe a little over the recommended 45 minutes.  I just watched it till the top started to brown.  It was not mushy, or too sweet...I really think it was just right.   I did use a Pampered Chef stoneware baking dish, maybe that's why I didn't have any problems with the syrup getting hard after it cooled.  I hate to say it, but I like this recipe better than my mom's!

This is absolutely delicious--I've made it at least 5 times so far. I actually use Texas Toast and layer the ingredients in my 9 x 13 glass Pyrex. 1/2 sugar mixture goes on the bottom, then a layer of bread, then 1/2 egg mixture. I put most of the remaining sugar mixture on top of that, and repeat with the bread and remaining egg mixture. I end up with a dollop of the sugar mixture on each piece of egg-soaked bread and refrigerate. I've never had a problem with hardening sugar on the bottom of the pan this way. (Next time, I may try adding some cinnamon!)

I make a lot of versions of this, so I am pretty hip to the fact that these get soggy.  That said, REDUCE THE MILK!  Eyeballing the milk I put in, I'd say it was about 1/2 cup.  Cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup too.  Added in Almond extract, vanilla extract, Penzey's Cake Spice and then a ton of cinnamon.  Perfect for those rushed holiday mornings!

I tried this with Texas Toast.  Maybe it was the bread-or maybe I did something wrong-but the toast was pretty soggy.  The crust was really good, though!

I chose this recipe for a brunch I was throwing. Since my oven was cooking the Brunch Enchiladas I used my slowcooker instead.

I prepared this recipe exactly as is except using my Crockpot. I cooked this overnight sensation for 6 hours on low. This was soooo good! I think the crockpot add to the flavor.

Everyone wanted the recipe!

I will definitely fix this again.

This is very easy to make but I found it very sweet.  The bread comes out nice and moist. Maybe less sugar next time?

This is one of my husband's favorites!!  He's not a big fan of sweets but asks for this often.  I just finished putting it together for Christmas morning tomorrow(at his request).  I use day old french bread from Jimmy Johns.  I also use regular ol' pancake syrup instead of corn syrup since I always have that in the house.

ok, so i had to write a review because this turned out amazingly yummy!  i realized i had no corn syrup on hand and decided to use honey instead.  i also used regular sandwich bread which is what i had, and added ceylon cinnamon as well.  finally i sprinkled cinnamon sugar all over the top before baking and dotted the top with butter. i did bake for 60 min which was perfect. all i have to say is wow, wow, wow! i will definitely be making this again. DELISH!

I used maple syrup instead of corn syrup, and I added half a teaspoon of cinnamon and nutmeg to the second mixture. Instead of putting the bread slices over the sugar-butter mixture, I coated each slice of bread with this mixture. I think it helped even out the sweetness.

This was really good but I am not sure I would call it French Toast. It was more of a gooey, sweet pastry. I took this to work and there was not a crumb left!

I cut this recipe in half and used 3 eggs instead of 5 and put it in a glass  9x9 square baking dish.  A few more changes I made were adding cinnamon to the egg mixture and replaced regular milk with Almond milk.    After I put the sugar mixture in the pan I sliced a banana and gently set a layer of bananas on top of it.  I used fresh Italian bread and sliced it about an inch thick (about 5 slices fit in the dish).  Baked it on 350 for about 40 minutes.  My daughter said it was awesome and I thought so too.  It was not mushy and the crust was so chewy and delicious.  I will definitely make it again.  Oh and we DID use a little maple syrup on top but it did not need much so apparently it wasn't too sweet for us. :)

Agree with not letting it harden in pan.  Wonderful recipe.  Just test with a knife in center  to guarantee doneness.  I prefer to bring casserole nearly to room temp in warm oven just prior to actually baking.  It's always puffy & done.  For an extra rich casserole, use stale cake or old fashioned doughnuts in place of bread.

My husband would give it 6 stars!  I followed the recipe (thought I did add cinnamon to the egg mixture), but I had a whole loaf of french bread, so I had two layers of bread (about 1 or 2 inch slices). This was awesome because it had a crunchier layer.  I turned the pan over on a baking sheet to let the syrup run over all of the layers and the crunchy was on the bottom, which made it easier to serve, and very beautiful and delicious!

I loved this recipe. It makes a crunchier side with the butter/brown sugar that tastes amazing.Easy to make and only a few ingredients too!! The only comment that my husband made that the texture. When you let it sit overnight gets kind of a creamy texture in the middle (even when cooked well). We both loved it but it is not exactly the same as regular french toast if that is what you are expecting. In my opinion, I like this even better than traditional french toast.

I thought this turned out good. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and layered half the sugar mixture, a layer of bread, half the egg mixture, the rest of the sugar, the rest of the bread & finished with the remaining egg mixture. It could have used more egg mixture as the top layer was quite dry. Also I used real, hefty French bread. A white bread or fluffy French bread would have been too soggy.

Great Recipe! Used day old bread and it worked great. It didn't get hard as the others were mentioning. I would also cut the bread into smaller pieces more like bread pudding for next time. People didn't understand to take some all the way to the bottom and then they missed out on the yummy stuff!

This recipe was delish!!! The only thing different I did was, turn the bread before baking, this ensured that both sides were crispy. Mine did not gte hard even after cooling. This is a keeper.

This was really good.  I used Oat-N-Honey bread that I made from this site and that fit nicely wit the dish.  I also used buttermilk instead of regular milk and added 1 tsp of cinnamon.  I did not have problems with soggyness, nor did the sauce on the bottom stick to anything or get hard.  It was absorbed into the bottom of the bread and came out of the pan very nicely.

Great and so easy! I used cinnamon/raisin bread and cubed it. I didn't have corn syrup and it was fine without it. I made it on Saturday afternoon and put it in the refrigerator and let it sit all night. Such a great dish! Everyone loved it! Thank you!

This recipe came out very sweet and the bottom part of the bread was really soggy.  Maybe it was because I used sliced white bread instead of the french bread.

Fantastic recipe.  Everyone we have ever served it to loves it.  Suggestions:  bake it a little longer - maybe 60 minutes, which reduces the sogginess some other reviewers mentioned; make it with cinnamon raisin bread for over-the-top decadence.

I doubled the recipe for the sauce, but only used 1 and 1/2 cup brown sugar - too sweet.  I used 15. oz of bread (6 mini loaves of French bread). I used 9 eggs and 1 3/4 cup milk, adding 1 T of cinnamon, and used 2 t. vanilla and 1 t. salt.  I let it sit overnight.  The bread beforehand was soft.  I put 1/2 the sauce on the bottom of the pan and 1/2 on top.  I added 3/4 c. raisins in the middle of all the bread.  It turned out great and the people at church loved it.

Substitute pure maple syrup (which has vitamins and minerals) for the corn syrup (which doesn't) and it tastes even better.  Thanks for the tip about inverting the pan early on.

It was  good but not exceptional. It was really nice the have a hot breakfast though, without all the work. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 a cup and it was perfectly enough. The result, if cooked as long as recommended, isn't soggy at all but extremely moist. This was a nice recipe for lazy mornings but it definitely can't replace some freshly made french toast. Thanks for sharing this this recipe !

I made this for Christmas morning last year and although it had good flavor, it was a bit dry if you are using a full loaf of store-bought french bread.  This year I made it for a brunch and added EASILY five more eggs and half cup of milk.  Turned out PERFECTLY moist and fully baked.  Not dry bread on top!  got rave reviews!

I have made this several times and it's always a huge hit and I always get asked for the recipe.  I do not use corn syrup (because I don't want to buy it) and just use syrup in it's place....very good.  I add a teaspoon of cinnamon.  You don't even need additional syrup when eating.

Update:  I have made this countless number of times, including for cooking club.  It is ALWAYS a huge hit and I constantly get asked for the recipe.  

Challah bread makes this dish AMAZING!  I couldn't find any French bread at the grocery store so the baker suggested this.  He told me to double the egg and milk mixture though since it soaks up a lot more liquid than regular French bread.  I decided to multiply the egg and milk mixture by about 1.5 and it was perfect!  I still make this with regular bread but the challah bread is so much better.  I have actually made this recipe (just for my husband and I) with hoagies that had been in the freezer too long and it was still great.  A continued favorite!

4 stars mainly cause the recipe i have used for years with no flaws does not have the syrup baked into it
if you just bake the bread and egg mixture as directed no hardening, just serve with the warm syrup on the side
by reading the recipe yo ushould know its gonna harden because of the cook temp

Fabulous breakfast recipe when paired with sausage. Now a staple when company comes over. I don't put it in overnight though, too soggy. I also add a bit of Jamaican rum extract along with the vanilla extract--yummy! Cinnamon is a must too in both mixtures. Comes out perfect every time!

Updated review:  I used half a few slices of french bread and a few left over slices of cinnamon raison bread.  I also split the sugar mixture and used 3/4 of the liquid on the bottom of the pan and the remaining on top so that it was sweeter throughout.  
This would be really good with a little bourbon added too.  
Like before I adjusted the eggs and milk to accommodate the smaller portion and baked in a 9x4 bread pan. 

You must adjust this recipe based on how much bread and the dryness of the bread that you are using. Like others mentioned I cooked mine covered for 30 minutes and then uncovered for 10 to prevent drying. I only had half an old loaf of French bread so I cut the eggs and mink in half and it was delicious.

Love this recipe but I tweaked it a bit. Before putting in fridge I add cinnamon on top. After letting it sit for a couple of hours, I flip each piece so that the syrup soaks in on both sides. Let it sit over night, then bake as directed and it is delicious!

My family really enjoyed this! I used cinnamon raisin bread. I also added cinnamon and used maple syrup instead of corn syrup. It helped to flip the dish into another pan once it was cooked so the syrup didn't stick tot he bottom. Really yummy and will make again! Thank you for all the previous suggestions!

I've made this recipe for years, and I have never had a complaint.  It is delicioious.  I also recommend it, as everyone can eat at the same time.  You can also be creative and add fruit to the bottom.

Too sweet and soggy and seems more of a sweet bread pudding.  I still prefer mixing milk, egg, cinnamon and nutmeg together to soak thick slices of bread overnight.  Fry like you would a basic French Toast.  Excellent!

Wonderful! Everyone loved it and it was so simple. I used stale homemade wheat bread cut 1 inch thick. Added 2 extra eggs (personal preference) and 1 tsp cinnamon to the egg mix. I layered the sugar and egg mixes and soaked overnight. Baked up wonderfully with a crunchy sweet topping and was not soggy in the least. I think the stale thick bread is the key. (It's what a chef friend of mine uses to make his bread pudding) A very versatile recipe that can accommodate any leftover breads. Raisins, nuts or possibly even berries could be added for a change up. This will definitely be my go-to recipe for my leftover breads. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is an awesome french toast recipe.  I made this for Easter breakfast for my family and they loved it.  I should tell you that I read all of the reviews and was a little hesitant about serving the hot meal to my toddlers, but quickly realized that my french toast was not hardening like everyone warned.  The only thing I can think of is that I cooked the syrup, butter and brown sugar for a longer period of time on low heat to ensure that the sugar crystals melted.  Once I was done cooking this mixture, it was like a caramel sauce.  That's the only thing I did differently.  Hope this helps...great recipe!

Turned out just okay. Good if you don't want to use cream like some of the other baked french toast recipes on the site, but I think I'd still prefer using those recipes with the cream omitted, over this one. I think maybe it might turn out better if the bread is soaked in the egg mixture overnight and then the syrup poured on top right before baking.

Taking the advice of others, I cut the sugar in half, added cinnamon, and used raisin bread cut 1" thick.  Because of the raisins I thought the sweet was just right, but if you didn't have them it would have needed a bit more than the 1/2 C I put in.  I also let it sit only for an hour in the fridge before baking.  Whole family loved it!  Thanks for the great recipe.

Good! Husband really enjoyed it but didn't think it was at all like French Toast. I used a too-dried-out-for-sandwiches Viennese loaf, and the 'toast' wasn't wet or mushy at all. I added a touch of cinnamon powder to the egg mixture. Thanks!

Very easy and delicious. I made it the night before and served it for a Christmas brunch. It made a big hit. Serve with lots of applesauce or fresh fruit!

This was a big success at our brunch today. Deserving of more stars than the 5. Several of our guests asked for the recipe.  Very slight changes: substituted maple syrup for the corn syrup, egg nog for the milk and I added 2 tsp cinnamon to the custard.  For serving, I inverted the French Toast onto a serving serving platter - there was no problem with the sauce hardening.  Like another reviewer I made the Oats N Honey bread just for this recipe.  Delicious - I'll be using this recipe again soon. Thanks for posting BOBSROAD

YUM YUM!!! Easy and delicious. I cut an old french stick into 3cm slices and made per recipe but with 3/4 cup sugar and adding cinnamon and nutmeg on the top. Did not find it soggy at all. Next time i will add some berries around the bread slices or sliced banana in the caramel layer.

Made this and my family LOVED it. It's not soggy if you serve it caramelized side up. Drizzled a little real maple syrup on each piece before eating. It really brought out the flavors. Susan

The caramel almost burned after the recommended 45 minutes. It became so hard that it was almost impossible to break with a fork. The bread didn't set enough so the middle was mushy.

Delicious! I used maple syrup instead of corn syrup. I used french bread that I left out over night to get a little crispy. I also did what others suggested and soaked the bread for about an hour and a half instead of over night. The finished product was nice and crispy on the top and chewy and sweet on the bottom. I will definitely be using this recipe again.

This was wonderful.  I added more egg mixture to it to 'fill' my pan more so.  You have to eat right away otherwise it gets stuck to the pan.

This was really good and the family loved it. I only deviated from the recipe because I had to; i.e. used half n half (out of milk) and 2T. maple syrup (out of corn syrup). Will make again!

I've made this a few times.  A couple with french bread and a couple w/ a loaf of cinnamon bread.  Personally, I liked it better w/ french, but hubby likes it w/ the cinnamon.  It's a great recipe.  Making again this weekend for family coming in.

This was really good and easy to prepare.  For the most part, I followed the recipe except that I used a different kind of bread and sprinkled cinnamon all over the top.  My husband thought it tasted like a cinnamon roll.  Some of the bread was a bit soggy but I didn't mind.  :)

This was fun to throw together the night before and just pop in the oven in the morning. I thought it was pretty good, wasn't thrilled with the flavor - thought it needed maple syrup instead of corn syrup and definitely cinnamon too. I followed the recipe exactly for the first time making it though. My husband and son both loved it though - my hubby had never had overnight French toast and I think he was very pleasantly surprised! The crisp edges are a nice contrast to the moist and tender center pieces. I also suggest cutting your bread into less pieces - maybe more like 10 total pieces. I cut mine smaller and had a hard time fitting them all in the 9x13 pan!

Very tasty, and I will make it again.  The bread that I used was a very crusty sourdough, which didn't absorb all the liquid.  It was delicious, but I would like to tweek this recipe a little so this problem is resolved.  It's a great, make-ahead recipe-- and I love those!

OMG...this is delicious!! I subbed real maple syrup for the corn syrup and the whole kitchen smelled delish when it was cooking. I think that this would be another great Christmas morning goodie! We didn't have problems getting the leftovers out of the pan. Reheated them the next day in the microwave! Try this...it's great!!!!

This was a huge hit on Christmas Day.  I made a few changes: eliminated corn syrup, added ginger, cinnamon sugar, apple pie spice and used Montana Mills/Great Harvest Cinnamon Swirl Bread.  It was awesome!!!

Meh I  guess it was alright, my family really really en joyed it but im not too fond of mushy things, so I think next time I will cut the bread a couple hours before I prepare so it won't absorb so much egg mixure.   And also I used Belgian Bread if that makes a difference.

Absolutely delicious! I can’t recommend this highly enough. It is always a hit with the big family brunches!  The best part is being able to prepare it the night before.  I serve it with berries! Perfect.

I have made this several times and it is always a hit.  I have used other overnight French Toast recipes, this one is the best.

My favorite use is to put it together New Year's Eve so all I have to do is pop it in the oven New Year's Day for all my overnight guests.  None of us feel like cooking the next morning.

Taste great but of course I had the issue with parts being soggy. Not sure if cook time being longer would work (like almost double the time) but that's what I will try next cause this is an awesome recipe. Reminds me of monkey bread.

Great and simple way to get the work done early and enjoy the delicious results in the morning. Rather than french bread on my second dish I used Texas toast and sprinkled cinnamon on top after egg mix is added. Turned out great. Leftover is plated, wrapped and frozen to be heated in microwave when a quick hot breakfast is desired!

This is a great recipe. We call it creme brûlée French toast. We double the syrup recipe in the bottom of the pan and cook it until the top and edges are brown and crispy. Delicious... Not easy on the hips... But delicious!

This is extremely delicious!  The entire family loves it!  I did not have any problems with it getting hardened in the pan.  Perhaps others are cooking the corn syrup, brown sugar and water too long and getting it to the hard crack stage.  Fantastic and easy make ahead recipe.  Takes about 20 minutes to prepare the night before.

Excellent! I followed the valuable tip of turning it out onto a platter right away and it was great. It beats making french toast piece by piece in a skillet!

The adults in the house really liked it, but the kids really didn't.  All my kids said they would not eat it again, but I give it the high rating because I really liked it.

I made this for Christmas morning and almost everybody who tried it loved it and had seconds. I used maple syrup instead of corn syrup and added cinnamon to the butter mixture. The rest was as stated and it came out great. I used a stoneware roaster and multiplied the recipe by 1.5 and layered it. I served it by flipping it upside down. I did not have any parts harden, not even the next day after the leftovers had been in the fridge overnight. It was delicious.

We made this for our Christmas morning casserole and the flavor was bad. It was soggy in the middle, and a strange gooey mixture on the bottom.

Made this this morning. I used brown sugar cinnamon bread added vanilla and cut the milk by 1/2 cup. I let it sit long enough to soak the bread entirely. It turned out fine (not soggy)but was just too sweet(possibly b/c of the bread?) and it wasn't anything special. It wasn't bad, but I'll look for something else to make the next time.

This is the best recipe for overnight French toast I've ever tried.  My kids are on a swim team and we host a meet twice a year.  The people running hospitality just volunteer me to bring this without even asking.  I even did it once with the layer of caramel on the bottom, a layer of cinnamon raisin country bread, another layer of caramel, and the final layer of regular baguette.  It was amazing!  Look no further for a breakfast that will impress.  Jane

Yum!  Very good.  The bottom layer had a caramel flavor to it that was wonderful.  I did not have any issues with the bread being soggy or the bottom sticking to the pan.  Will definitely be making this again!

This is a great idea but need perfecting. I couldn't eat it because the syrup hardened like a rock almost instantly (I am still trying to get it off my casserole dish)and the bread was a little too soggy for my liking. But if using a different syrup and adding a little more flavor to the eggs like some cinnamon it could be good.

Good recipe!  I changed serving size from 5 to 7, and baked in a 10 x 13 pan.  Actually had two layers of french bread, and think it might have been better to not increase and only have one layer, although I had no trouble with both layers getting cooked through, although it's not going to be "firm", even when thoroughly cooked.  I dumped it upside down on a serving tray to make sure it didn't stick, and it didn't ... don't understand the people who complained about it hardening in the pan or turning hard!  Good layer of sweetness, but not overpowering, although no one felt like it needed either butter or additional syrup! Nice to be able to make this the night before and just stick it in the oven when we woke up.

I cut the recipe in half, using two eggs and cooked it in an 8x8 glass dish.  I loved it, next time I think I'll use maple syrup instead of corn.  Very good.

Everyone loves this dish! I cook it for our monthly breakfast at church. Never any left. I also have made it with the gluetin free bread. but it is best to cube it, because the bread is so dense. Still taste great.

I thought this turned out pretty good. I only had sour dough bread tho so that might have cut down on the sweetness. I left in a warm oven so it didn't get hard on me. Was great comfort food.

This recipe was good. I didn't want it soggy, and my family would never wait for breakfast for as long as it took to preheat and cook it, so I made it for lunch, got it ready in the morning. Its true, I love sweet things and usually am not bothered, but this is way too sweet. I could not finish mine. Also, even though mine only soaked for less than 2 hours, it was still very very soggy on the bottom. I don't know how to correct that problem. This is a fine recipe though if you cut back on the sugar. I wonder if it would work to soak it, then flip the bread over before baking? I might try that next time. I love this type of food, just can't get the right consistency.

This is SO easy to make and it is such a hit with everyone I have made it for.  It has become my new make ahead breakfast for new moms! It stores up to 2 days in the fridge before baking and it always turns out yummy. It's the one recipe everyone always asks for when I make it!  Thanks so much for sharing!

The liquid was really too much - I had to syphon quite a bit off.  Maybe I needed a heartier bread(?)  This is really probably enough mix to make two 9 x 13 pans.  Very sticky texture and other than "sweet" just not a lot of flavor.  Although the sugar addict in the house said it was "the bomb."

This was really good!  Definitely sweet so beware if that is not your cup of tea.  I used italian bread because that was all my market had other than that I followed the recipe. I left it the frig for 24 hours.  I was worried that it would be dry but it wasn't.

Simple and delicious!  I made this on Christmas morning (very early) so it didn't have overnight to soak up the eggs and it was still great.  My family truly enjoyed munching on this in front of the fireplace, while sipping champagne mimosa's in our PJ's (our "kids" are grown, while we opened gifts. It will definitley become a family favorite.

I added cinnamon and sprinkled the top w/ brown sugar.  Fabulous!

I bought the wrong kind of bread, but it still turned out pretty good. It was a little too sweet for me, it tasted more like a dessert.

For some reason I’m unable to take a picture,I let it soak only an hour,and I put only 1/2 a cup packed brown sugar,I wouldn’t say this is a breakfast but more of a egg custard dessert,I liked it,the kids liked it,easy,would totally make again!

As per one if the previous reviews, I sprinkled cinnamon on each layer of bread and added it in the eggs. I also cut the cream cheese in extra small pieces. I made it on Christmas Eve, it was perfect for Christmas Day breakfast. The homemade syrup was a hit!

This is a family favourite for Christmas morning. I have made it with both French toast and Texas toast.  If making with Texas toast, both the amount of sauce and the space in a 9 x13 pan works best with  6 slices as they are so much larger than the French toast. I always use maple syrup instead of corn syrup and add about 1 tsp cinnamon to the milk mixture. It really wowed my visitors this morning!

I have made this for Christmas morning for years. I also pop a small baking pan with a single layer of pork sausage (not brown and serve, just regular link breakfast sausage) in the oven at the same time. And the night before, I cook up a pound of bacon in the oven, chill it, and warm it briefly in the morning. Add a fruit salad, and this is such an easy breakfast. My family always votes me down when I suggest maybe having something different,  so that says a lot!  Breakfast practically makes itself while we open gifts!

It might have been because we put maple syrup on also, but we found it to be quite sweet. That won’t stop me from making this again! I found that prep was easy and the pans were in the fridge quickly, so we made a double batch! What’s easier then waking up in the morning, preheat the oven, put pans in the oven, make coffee while it’s cooking. Before you know it, you’ve got hot coffee and French toast, it was as if it was my birthday!

Made it, loved it, and look forward to making it again in the near future. Only thing missing was the corn syrup, and that's because I didn't have any and didn't think it would be a big deal. It was great

I didn’t have corn syrup so I used maple syrup. Turned out delicious and it was a great way to use up a French loaf of bread that was too hard for sandwiches.

This was great! I have made this many times and have finally perfected it. I did only 2/3 cup of milk and 2 extra eggs. I put half the sugar mixture on the bottom. I ripped up the bread into chunks and tossed it in the egg mixture. And then poured the egg and bread mixture onto the sugar in the pan and put the remaining sugar on top. And then lightly tossed the mixture with my hands to mix the sugar in a tad. This is perfect!

The only way I’ll be making French toast from now on! I took the advice from others and added cinnamon. I also used 1/2 of the brown sugar mixture at the bottom of the pan and drizzled on top of the bread before adding the egg mixture. I also used only 1/2 the milk it called for so it wouldn’t get soggy like other reviews suggested.

I used Costco cinnamon bread, used maple syrup instead of corn syrup.  Reduced sugar to 3/4 cup and used 1 cup of whole milk.  I also used another person's advice and flipped the bread after 2 house of refrigeration and then left it in fridge for the rest of the night.   Baked at 350 for 45 min It was perfect!!!  Thank you for the recipe!!

I believe the main ingredient, the bread, is most significant to success. I used a Texas toast style artisan potatoe bread and it was a resounding success.

I used any bread, bagel, rolls that was saved in freezer then thaw them.  Cut them into 1 inches square.  Cookie sheet single layer in oven just to toast (to get the humidity out of it so can absorb the egg/milk mix.

Delicious, easy, and devoured. I used challah bread for a bit of firmness. The only minor negative was that it was too sweet.  I would cut down the sugar next time. There was no problem with it sticking in the pan. Would make again.

I believe the quote of the morning went something like "If you're going to eat carbs, this is the way to do it!" I used light brown sugar and light corn syrup; not sure if that made any difference over dark options. I also had to sub in French baguettes as I was away and French bread was not available. It turned out well!

I used Map,e Syrup instead of Corn Syrup. I poured only half the syrup mix on the bottom and drizzled the remaining between layers. I cut it in squares and left it covered until i was ready for it, maybe 20 minutes. Some of the end pieces were hard but nobody complained as it tasted delicious. and my guests thought so too. I adapted a tip from a reviewer and flipped it onto a platter. It looked like cinnamon buns and a very nice presentation.

Delicious! Make sure you keep the bread pieces thick, and fill in any holes with  bread pieces.
You could cut back on the sugar maybe to ½ cup and should still be good!

It's our go to for Thanksgiving brunch that our family does.   Followed the recipe, but immediately flip it out of the pan onto a serving dish.  (it will harden in the pan.)  it's pretty on the platter and easier to deal with.  this will reheat the next day really well!   it's delicious, but if you are making it for a smaller group, you might still have leftovers like us.  reheats great though.

Perfect for the day after Thanksgiving with extra company! I followed the recipe and used french bread and cinnamon bread.  After cooking, invert on to a serving platter (or baking sheet) so the sauce is on top. It looks great, is easy to cut and as the sauce hardens a bit, it's still easy to cut! Yummy.

Loved it. Great make ahead holiday 
breakfast. 
Second time i lined pan with tin foil for easier clean up. . 
For fall flare: Added chopped pecans to the pan before adding the bread, to the mixture I added 1/3 can of pumpkin, reduce cream to 1 cup, and of course I also added 1/2 tsp pumpkin spice, 1.5 tsp cinnamon.

It came out great with some changes. The milk /egg mixture didn't even come close to covering the bread. I added 1cup more milk & 3 more eggs. Next time I make it I will also add about 1/3 cup of brown or white sugar to the egg mixture. It puffed up beautifully and tasted great. I think had I not added the extra liquid, it would have been really dry.

I used a 9x13in pyrex dish for this, and the milk/egg mixture didn't quite fill the dish as much as I had really expected, so I just added more milk until it filled a bit more, and it still turned out great! I also used a sourdough bread and it added a lot of great extra flavour. The dish didn't get soggy, either, which I've found to be an issue in other baked/overnight french toast recipes. Will definitely make this again, it was incredible!!

Super easy to make, EVERYBODY WHO TRIES IT LOVES IT! Really like this recipe. I have tried the similar creme brûlée French toast recipes here. This recipes uses milk versus cream or half and half which I rarely have on hand so it requires a special purchase. The key to the Carmel sauce staying soft is to only cook the sugar, butter and syrup until the ingredients are combined. The longer the mixture cooks the harder it will ultimately become. I combined the egg and milk ingredients in my Vitamix blender. I sprinkled cinnamon on the top of the French toast. I used a large loaf of French bread and cut it into 8 thick pieces. I let it soak overnight, woke up early and put it in the oven for 45 minutes. I lightly covered the pan in the oven with aluminum foil while it baked, then I removed it for 5 more minutes of baking. (I only had 4 eggs on hand and it still turned out great)

So so good!! I made this today (two hour snow delay), so obviously, no overnight soaking. I did let it soak for 3 hours. I followed the exact recipe except used cinnamon raisin bread. A really quick and easy and DELICIOUS recipe. I look forward to trying the overnight soak.

Awesome!   My family was very hesitant when I told them we were breaking our Christmas tradition of over 10 years and would be having a different overnight french toast.  After tasting this recipe, however, they are hooked and everyone agrees that this recipe will be a new holiday tradition.  The only change I made was to add two additional eggs and about 2 additional tbsp of milk.  I also flipped the toast once after pouring the ingredients over the top, just to make everything soaked in.

The most important feedback I can provide is that it is TOO SWEET!  I used 2/3 cup brown sugar and that was plenty - can't imagine what a full cup of brown sugar would've done.  Otherwise I made it exactly as directed and it turned out very well.

so simple!  love it. ..I used buttermilk instead of milk,  because I loved the eggnog recipe I found on here but sadly it's no longer eggnog season. turned out perfectly,  though did cook it for 10 minutes less.  added cool whip,  strawberries and blueberries on top.  delicious!

Every Christmas I do  brunch for my children and grand children and this was the first time I prepared this dish.  Everybody loved it.  I ended up with too much content for the baking dish and mid stream I had to move it (messy but it worked) to a larger baking dish.   Two days later my son wanted to know if there was any left.  Wonderful, flavorful Christmas dish.  Thank you

well, im a novice cook, its not my passion & even if I was my time in the kitchen is limited, since I make stuff/food ahead for the work week, this was easier w/ less mess than my usual method,  its reheats/cooks nicely. since I reheat with a small broiler at work, I cut it short of being 
fully cooked and freeze several servings for the work week ensuring I have a breakfast. the syrup was a little messy, but it was nice. thanks for posting this recipe. I do recommend using parchment or foil lining in the pan for easy clean up.

Love how easy and tasteful this was!  Just made this and the family gave all 5's.   Reading the reviews were helpful too.  Here's what I did:  Made the original recipe and added 1/2 tsp each of cinnamon & nutmeg with bread slices at 1 1/2" thick.  Pre-made overnight as suggested.  Cooked covered for 40-50 min.  Uncover then cook 15-20 min.  Take out and turn bread over.  Bake uncovered for at least 10-15 min. until lightly crisp.  This will prevent your sogginess.  Take out and let sit 5  min. to thicken.  Serve with warm butter & syrup.  Once the toast starts to cool it will then start to harden, thus the need for knives.  Keep toast in a warm oven to prevent hardening.   This recipe is great for travel too.  Thank you for the great recipe!

Absolutely de-lish!  There is one suggestion, when I make again I will cut the brown sugar by half...somewhat too sweet.
Also, I made two hours before cooking and dish came out great!

Excellent!! Made it for Christmas brunch.  Used two loaves of French bread.  Doubled the sugar mixture and 1 1/2 for egg mixture.  Also added cinnamon and nutmeg to the sugar and egg mixtures.  Definitely a winner!! Thank you!!

I made this night before christmas, popped in oven in the morning, baked while kids opened gifts.  It came out perfect! I used french bread, cut in 1 inch slices, sprinkled with cinnamon.  Kids all loved it, probably will make every year, so easy and good!

This is totally awesome. I used egg nog instead of milk the second time I made it and now is a fav at our Christmas Brunch. Either way is delicious.

Made this Christmas Eve - popped it in the oven Christmas Morning and wow, it filled the house with a wonderful aroma and it tasted wonderful!  I made one addition: cinnamon/sugar sprinkle on top just prior to baking :-)

Followed this recipe exactly (other than sprinkling the top with cinnamon) as it was the first time I'd made it.  It was a huge hit with my family and guests.  I used King's Hawaiian bread cut into 1 inch slices and it was fabulous.  The center of the bread was very soft, but I wouldn't call it soggy.  It soaked for about eight hours prior to baking.  As some others suggested, I inverted it straight out of the oven onto a serving platter and it looked beautiful. Super easy to make.  I think this will become a Christmas morning tradition.

This was so delicious-quite a Christmas morning treat. I also sliced a few slices of bread in half and put cream chess in the middle. Yummy sticky-bun French toast!

Made this for the annual Christmas brunch and it was a hit. Had to modify it a little because my son drank all our milk and I didn't realize it until I was assembling it late at night before bed. I used Egg Nog instead of the milk and vanilla and it came out fantastic.

This recipe was delish, and easy.  I have done this a few times, but by far my favorite substitution was to use cinnamon  bread!  Trying it again tomorrow with just raisin bread... we'll see!

Family loved it!  Very easy to follow directions.  I sprayed the bottom of the pan, so none stuck.  Added cinnamon and nutmeg...thought it was great.  Will make again.

Great recipe! It will serve 8, if needed. This was the first item to go at my breakfast that included five other casseroles. Easy to make but has great flavor and impact. We did not serve syrup on the side.

This is the exact same recipe as my mother-in-laws! I always have people asking for this recipe. Her recipe calls for ENGLISH MUFFIN BREAD though and it doesn't come out soggy! And it will definitely make a difference if you cook it in a glass pan or others. I recommend glass.

I added a special syrup topping on the side.  It was a container of cream cheese blend together with enough maple syrup to make it the consistency of syrup!  It was delicious!

I didn't actually get to try this - I made it for a friend's birthday and I'm trusting her review of this : ) - said it was "to die for, rich and yummy" - the bottom/syrup layer was a bit much, so I'll try cutting back next time. I did use cinnamon raisin bread for a twist (making two layers to use up the whole bread bag - doesn't specify the layering in the recipe, so I guess it's assumed,) and apparently the cooking time was good. Doesn't get any easier, so I look forward to trying it myself soon! (*UPDATE! - made this weekend for a mom/kids beach getaway, and we polished it OFF in one sitting! I was delighted! Used cheap blueberry bread - highly recommend - cut back on brown sugar to 1/2 c., spread that part out in pan, brought milk/egg mixture with cinnamon and a tsp of vanilla in a thermos to the beach and added it on top of the bread once there - baked next morning and delighted in it being gobbled up. My friend's 11 year old asked, "Would you consider sharing this recipe?" : )

We have breakfast Friday's where I work in which a group of us alternate the responsibility.  I always make something instead of buying it, and so I made this for our breakfast today and received many compliments!  I did toast my french bread for about 10 minutes before adding it to the syrup. I placed slices of bread first and then filled in the gaps with quarted pieces of bread. (I used french baguettes) So there was some "crunch" to go with the softer bread at the bottom.  It was a hit!!

My friend was getting married and I was a bridesmaid. we were all getting reday at yher moms house that day and her mom made this for breakfast, it was a huge hit with the nridesmaids. I thought it was delicious and needed to get a copy for myself and will definitely plan to make on my own.
