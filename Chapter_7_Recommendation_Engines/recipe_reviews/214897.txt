I'm the submitter of this recipe.  We love the tartness of lime mixed with the cilantro so this is a personal favorite.  AR edited this before publishing and they say to lay the tenderloin into the lemon juice/broth mixture.  I don't do that.  My pressure cooker has a "rack" that keeps the meat above the liquid so it doesn't actually sit in the liquid as it cooks.  This could affect flavor and texture so I'd be interested in hearing your experience if you cook it right in the liquid.  AR also converted my "a good handful" of cilantro leaves into 1/4 cup.  I use more than 1/4 cup and I also use a heaping 1/2 teaspoon of the red pepper flakes and a scant 1/4 teaspoon of the salt.  As you can see, it's a very flexible recipe!  The original idea for the marinade comes from my friend, Angela, with a few modifications.

This was good. I added a little more red pepper than called for, but will still add more. Think I would add more garlic as well. I have a digital pressure cooker and put the roast on the bottom of the pot, not a rack. It took about 35 minutes on high. The meat was very tender and juicy. Will fix again with modifications.

Made this last night because it's hot and didn't want to heat up the house.  It was quick and easy.  My husband and I both really like lime and cilantro together (we had mojitos to go along with this.)  I added more red pepper, probably 3/4 teaspoon, because we like it with a kick.  I'll be making this again.

I liked this enough to take a picture of it!   I didn't have lemon so I just used lime juice.  I followed Dutchgirl's post more cilantro and red pepper and could have used more.  But the meat turned out nice.  I did it in an electric cooker for 22 mins then I let it the pressure go down on it's own.   It was just right and my roast was 1.74 lbs.  I will be making this again.

In order to accent flavor, we did a quick searing on the grill to the tenderloin (which we pressure cooked to pink inside).  It still lacked quite a bit of flavor but was moist!

Great flavor...I've tried it once and the meat was over cooked, I made it exactly according to the directions.  I will try again and not cook as long.

Made this and wow, so many questions and complements, I changed 3-4 things. First I used a 4 lb  butt roast rather then the tenderloin.  For the marinade I used 1/2 cup of salt and 1/2 cup dark brown sugar, 1tbs 5 spice and marinated about 28 hours. Dried really good and smeared with 1 tbs  honey and 1 tbs brown mustard and let sit for 30 minutes.  Followed the rest of your directions but just set my electric pressure cooker on meat and timer to 50 minutes plus  cooldown. Amazing

This was my first pressure cooker experience. Recipe was easy to follow, quick to prepare and moist.  I will be using my pressure cooker more and try out more recipes on this site. Thanks!

I was amazed at the pork's tenderness in such a short cooking time. After removing pork, I let it rest in a foil tent then added chopped cabbage, shredded carrots, some strips of bacon to the juices. I pressurized the pot again and cooked cabbage mixture for 2 minutes. Cooled and removed. Made an amazing dinner. Thanks for the recipe.

Really liked this recipe! Had to do some tweaking because my cooker is electric and my tenderloin was 1.15 lb. but it still came out great. I cooked it on high for 19 minutes and used a natural release, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and really liked the marinade, it made a nice “sauce” for the meat and side. I followed one reviewers suggestion of cabbage and carrot side (next time I will plan for the bacon too) and had a wonderful meal. Will definitely make this again! Thanks!

Made this today. Terrorized the pork followed recipe & let  it marinade overnight. Followed the directions for cooking in pressure cooker. Very easy to follow. It was tender & flavorful. 
It is definitely a keeper & will be making it again.

I followed this as wrote out, and it always turns out fabulous. This has become a regular in our meal rotation, and everyone loves it! The only thing I would recommend is cutting the loin into fist size chunks. I find this helps with portioning it out at dinner, and helps the marinade permeate the meat better too.  I sometimes can only marinade it for 30 min or so, and I will pierce the meat with a fork or knife before pouring the marinade over it. 

Thank you for a great recipe!

Was delicious. I did follow some other suggestions from other reviews and added more cilantro, red pepper flakes and a little more garlic. I let the meat marinate a little over 24 hours (might have been overkill but cooked it a little later than expected). It was very good, im glad i added more of those few ingredients and the meat was very tender with the pressure cooker.

I needed something kind of fast as I forgot I had this tucked away in the fridge.  I threw the ingredients together before I left for the afternoon and let it sit in the marinade until I got home (about 5.5 hours).  I cooked the 1.5 lb tenderloin at high pressure for 30 min and let it naturally release.  I also placed it on the rack to keep it up out of the juices.  It was AWESOME!  My 13 year old and I had make ourselves stop eating it so there would be left overs for pork carnita style wraps tomorrow night!  I have the other 1.5 lbs marinating in the fridge and plan to freeze it for another meal in a week or two.  I used cilantro I had frozen and had to use some garlic powder as I did not have enough fresh garlic.

I MUST remember to first read the reviews before trying the recipe! Not only did i fail to use a rack, but I also added a cup of basmati and extra broth to the pot. while it was a little bland, I have plenty of spicy condiments for quick fixes. I will try again with the rack next time.

Outstanding recipe. The pork was tender enough to cut with a fork. The flavor was amazing. Quick and delicious.

It was so tasty! I cut up the pork before marinating it for 12 hrs in fridge. I cooked it in my slow cooker for 2 hrs on high ,then an additional 30 min on low. Will definitely make again

We really enjoyed this easy recipe.  The meat was tender and full of flavor.  The juices go well with veggies like asparagus and broccoli.  Will make again.

This was simply awful.  I love citrus but this was too much citrus flavor and not much else.  My kids didn't like it either.
