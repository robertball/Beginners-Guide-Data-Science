This is a great punch! We make a very similar punch at every party -- I have just never written it down! My recipe includes pineapple juice as well:) You can't go wrong with a sherbet punch and there can be so many combinsations!! I made this in the form of orange cream sodas today since we didn't have enough people for a large party:) Great afternoon snack -- same ingredients just sized down to glasses!
