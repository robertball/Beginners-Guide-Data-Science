Read reviews and doubled the ricotta, sauce, egg and mozzarella. Used no-bake noodles and 2 (10oz) boxes of frozen chopped spinach; which I zapped in the micro 4 to 5 minutes (to save time and use less utensils) and also squeezed out all the liquid from the spinach. Baked in a 9x13 pan, covered, 30 minutes; uncovered and baked and additional 10 minutes. Let sit 10 to 15 minutes before serving. TURNED OUT GREAT.

Made this for Recipe Group 12/7/12. I used a 9x9 dish and thought using 6 noodles would help since others said it was a little shy on sauce and/or ricotta. After boiling the noodles (whole wheat), I cut off the ends and used those for the middle layer and they fit perfectly. I ended up adding a splash of milk to the ricotta just to make it easier to spread and needed to double the sauce. I used my colander over the pasta to steam the spinach but it didn't get as done as I'd like so I could only mix half into the cheese blend and then split the rest between each layer. Overall this was pretty good with those two changes in amounts. If using all nine noodles I would need even more sauce and more filling. We got 4 servings with no sides and probably would have gotten 6 if we'd had something else on the table, even with 2/3 the pasta.

This is one of my kids favorites for taste and mine for simplicity. I keep 9 noodles but use use almost 2 jars or 1 family size jar of sauce (which I season up a bit to my taste). Plus I use 15 oz ricotta, the 2cup bag of mozzarella (1 cup for the mix and one cup to spread on top) and finally 2 boxes of frozen spinach, which I microwave and squeeze the moisture out of.  It comes together super fast, feeds a large family, is vegetarian but filling, and I feel like all together, they are getting a pretty healthy meal out of it.

Very good.  The nutmeg went great with the dish.  I never really care for it but for this dish I put in 2 dashes.

I added a bit of crushed garlic to the ricotta/spinach mix for a bit more flavor. Was absolutely delicious! Will definitely make again (with the garlic).

I thought it was great! Delicious & way easier than reg. lasagna! I substituted 1/2ricotta for low fat cottage cheese. 2 jars of sauce. One red one white. No nutmeg because of an allergy...and extra extra cheese! U can never have enough cheese in my opinion!

Recipe Group Selection:  01, December 2012 ~ I made a half batch of this lasagna as my husband is not a fan of spinach.  As I was putting it together I did need quite a bit more spaghetti sauce.  Since my husband is also not a huge fan of vegetarian main dishes, I did fix pork chops along with this.  I know a weird combination.  Well I served him a big piece of the lasagna along side of this pork chop.  He questioned the odd combo, but I let him know I was accommodating his need for meat with a meal.  Well, he ate the lasagna without any complaints, liked it, and had a second helping.  MOTTSBELA that is a huge compliment!  Aside from adding more sauce, this lasagna set up very well and held it shape on the plate. Since I know he will eat the spinach in this vegetarian dish, I most definitely will be making it again.  Thanks MOTTSBELA.

This lasagne was very good, I made 5 individual portions instead of one large one. We are just 2 adults & 1 child so this way I used 3 and put 2 in the freezer for another day. I find this way we are not eating it for a week. The only changes I made to the recipe was to use 2 cups of pasta sauce instead of 1, there just wasn't enough in 1 cup, and I used 1/2 pack of frozen chopped spinach instead of fresh. Great recipe though, will make again.

I Loved the flavors of this lasagna but the two layers weren't enough, I even added extra ricotta and cheese but still ran short.. Also 50 minutes was a bit long, mine was over cooked and I took it out 5 min early. I will definitely try this again! Thanks for sharing!

I made as directed except, I doubled the amount of filling and sauce and omitted the nutmeg because I thought I had some, but apparently did not. Also, since I don't have a steamer insert, I just rinsed the spinach well and put it in a large pot with a lid for about 3 minutes on high heat and squeezed the water out before adding to filling. I think the lasagna would definitely be a bit flat and sad with the amount of filling the recipe calls for, though it might be a decent option for those looking to cut calories. With the extra filling and sauce, it was quite tasty and easy to make. I didn't like it as well as my favorite traditional lasagna, but while this isn't exactly "diet food" it still is more diet friendly than the version I normally make that has much more cheese, in addition to all the meat. My dad who thinks food isn't worth eating if there's nothing that used to have a face in it, rated it as "better than I expected." Not the recipe I'd pull out for company, but a good solid option for when I want something a bit different. Next time I make it, I will try the nutmeg, add some salt and pepper to the spinach directly and make sure I taste the filling for seasoning before I add the egg.

This was my first time trying to make lasagna and I'm so glad I tried this recipe first!  So easy to make, my husband loved it and prep time was very short.  The only thing is I wish I hadn't added the egg to the ricotta mixture before tasting how well seasoned it was, once I added the egg it was too late to taste to see if I had the spices/salt/pepper right.  Although thats  more a critique on me!

Made this for Recipe Group...This was VERY GOOD! The only reason that I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that 8oz. of ricotta was not enough, but I actually bought a 15oz. container, so I was able to add more, and 1 cup of sauce was not enough. I guess you could say that it is a preference thing, and maybe it is, but... Oh, also, I used a box of frozen, chopped spinach instead of fresh b/c I already had that on hand. This was super simple to put together, and the whole family enjoyed the end result. I will be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Please correct title.  This is not a "vegetarian" recipe. Vegetarians do NOT eat eggs.  We do use dairy products.  Vegans are vegetarians who do not use dairy.  I tried a recipe similar to this in Cooks Illustrated without the egg.  Please substitute something for the egg and re-post. Thanks.

Really easy and really good. I used Francesca Rinaldi jarred sauce in the Sweet and Zesty Tomato flavor. I also added a layer of roasted red pepper once. Really delicious and perfect for a quick dinner in the middle of the week.

Very easy to make. I added some fresh mozzarella in the layers. I would also recommend making at least 2 cups of sauce. 
I used frozen spinach and seasoned as if it were a side dish. Very tasty!!

If I would of followed this recipe exact it would of needed way more sauce + cheese. I thought it had enough spinach, I used a whole bottle of sauce and more mozzarella that it asked for and I still thought it needed some more. I still enjoyed it with the modifications I made.

This was good.  Like others, I made more sauce and more of the cheese mixture.  I'm trying to add more veggies into our meals, so added shredded carrots, diced zucchini and mushrooms.  I used low-fat ricotta and low-fat mozarella.  I will make this again. I'm planning to try it next time with Ragu light-alfredo sauce instead of red sauce.

Delicious! Made it for my vegetarian sister's visit. The whole family ate it and loved it. I also used oven-ready noodles and plenty of extra sauce, as those noodles always seem to absorb the sauce, but who doesn't love extra sauce?? I also added sliced portabella mushrooms. Will definitely make this again.

Hello All! I made this dish yesterday. It was absolutely wonderful and fulfilling; however I do recommend the following alterations: I used two jars of pasta sauce, 15oz of Ricotta Cheese or more, 1lb or more of spinach and 1-2 large eggs to expand the ricotta mixture.

I throw in sliced olives and onions. I use 8oz of cottage cheese with 6 oz of ricotta and it turns out awesome. I use 15 oz of frozen spinach, oven-ready noodles, and instead of basil I use an Italian seasoning. My 8 and 12 year olds love this recipe.

One cup of sauce for an entire lasagna is actually impossible, and it was too dry even after doubling it. Kind of disappointed considering all the high ratings

I tried with the exact same recipe and it was lacking the flavor. So second time I made it, I double up the filling and the sauce and used only 6 lasagna noodles, added some sundried tomatoes between the layers, served with some drizzled truffle oil and it tasted fantastic! 
To make it look more appealing to me, I divided the sauce in half and added spinach only in one layer, so every layer has different color when you cut it.

My family loves this recipe and requests it often. I made it as the recipe is written the first time and it was really good. Since then I've added zucchini's, fresh tomatoes, more basil, a lot more ricotta and a pinch of salt and pepper.

This turned out well and was easy to make. My only criticism was that it was kind of flat - the filling didn't take up much space between the noodle layers and it was a little bit bland. I used a 9X9 pan as recommended by some other reviewers. Overall though it was tasty.

I made it last night and it was great and so easy. I did modify it a few ways. I doubled the ricotta, egg, motz, and sauce. I also spiced up the sauce by adding half a can of drained cubed tomatoes, some crushed red pepper and some finely chopped garlic. The tomatoes made all the difference and I would highly recommend it the dish. Especially if you want something pretty easy and delicious.

The rating really would depend on what pasta sauce you are using. Really, the recipe is a pretty standard recipe. It turned out as most lasagne recipes, good.

Based on other reviewer recommendations, I doubled the cheese and sauce.  Because of the needed adjustment, I took away one star.  I didn’t have a steamer, so I “steamed” the fresh spinach in the microwave. I really liked this recipe, but you really gave to like spinach since it is a very dominant flavor.  I think I will try adding mushrooms next time as well.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I generally read reviews before I try a new recipe and based on what I read, I sauteed a big bunch of mushrooms, onions and garlic in some olive oil, and used that as an additional layer in the lasagna.  So it went noodles, cheese/spinach, onions/mushrooms, repeated.  I also used alfredo sauce instead of a red sauce.   We LOVED IT!!!  I'll be making this again and again.

I actually just used this as a guideline of what goes first to last lol. First time making lasagna. I didn’t make any mix. I layered the ricotta, sauce, Fresh spinach and cheese in each layer. I didn’t microwave or precook anything but the lasagna. Things I added:  frozen mixed vegetables, cayenne pepper,  garlic, onion powder. I also used more ingredients (1 jar sauce, 1pound ricotta and 1.5lbs of mozzarella.) Yummy!

My hubby and son loved this (I couldn't eat it myself though, as I was fasting.) I did add a layer of mushrooms just to make it a bit more interesting and cooked it at a lower temperature for a longer period of time. It turned out great!

So impressive, yet so simple! Excellent recipe, directions and measurements. I used about 3/4s of a jarred 4-cheese pasta sauce (parmesan, etc) for the 8X8 dish. Great company recipe, because you could make it, refrigerate, and then bake so it would be fresh. I added some sauteed zucchini slices with Italian seasoning to the Ricotta layer. A little fresh basil to garnish was a nice touch I added.

I added finely chopped veggies (carrots, tomatoes, zucchini, black olives, onion and green pepper) to the spinach mixture and used ricotta. Overall, much of the flavor is based on your red sauce - use or make your favorite. Would make again and use this recipe and 'doctor' to my tastes.

Very good. I used frozen spinach, thawed and dried. Mixed it in with the cheese mixture (used cottage instead of ricotta). I also added some red pepper flakes for a little heat.

Doubled the sauce and subbed out shredded mozzarella for fresh mozzarella (just tore it up and mixed with the other ingredients). I found the amount of cheese to be perfect and the dish was easy to make and very flavorful.

Nice easy approach to vegetarian lasagne. I knew I would want more cheese and sauce based on the amounts in the recipe, so I doubled both of them. My husband and I both liked it...will definitely make it again.

We loved it.  I made it very close to the recipe.  I used tomato & basil sauce.   I cut the recipe in half because there are only two of us.  It barely lasted for two day with lunch being the second day.  I used fresh spinach.

My husband and I really enjoyed this lasagna! I doubled the cheese mixture like I was reading in the comments and I am so glad I did! I make my own sauce with mushrooms in it, which complimented the spinach very well. Will be making this again!

I started by sauteeing a small chopped onion and a chopped red bell pepper in olive oil until softened, then added 2 tsp minced garlic from a jar, salt, pepper, and about 2 pounds of fresh spinach (add slowly as spinach cooks down). Let the spinach cool before adding it to the cold ingredients. I used 1/2 cup ricotta and a 16-oz. container of cottage cheese. I also used oven-ready noodles. Rave reviews for our Meatless Meal, and the leftovers were frozen for later.

This was wonderful!  I used one cup frozen, cooked spinach in place of fresh and squeezed out as much moisture as possible. I doubled the pasta sauce as suggested by others and added a couple pinches of oregano and a pinch of garlic.  It tastes great and I can't wait to make it again.

Loved it - but remember proper Parmesan is not vegetarian! Caught me out once - wanted to share the word!

This was so good! 1st time making ricotta and spinach lasagna and I was blown away. It's delicious. Nice to make my own.  Checked the seasoning (do so before the egg) and I did up it for more flavour. I see what others are saying about the quantity of cheese and sauce, mine was okay but I may or may not increase them both by a half next time. Great, great dish!!!

Very easy and delicious, modified the quantities some but kept the original ingredients. For the first time ever, my boyfriend complimented me on a dish without me asking . That's a win ??

This is super easy and nice tasting.  I use 10-16oz of bagged spinach to make it more spinachy.  I also use 1/2 - 3/4 jar of pasta sauce.  Definitely more than the 1 cup indicated.  It's quick and a nice  meal to serve.

Thank you for the recipe! I didn't bake 25 minutes on the 2nd bake because It was too hard and make the lasagna tastes pretty dry. I tried bake another lasagna not only I sprinkle mozzarella,  I added cheddar cheese on 2nd and 3rd layers.... it tasted super delicious. Love it!!!

I doubled the ricotta, mozzarella and tomato sauce, used 1/2 cup parmesan with the ricotta and spinach, added 1/2 tsp garlic powder and used  12 oven ready lasagna noodles (to  make a larger lasagna), then  baked it at 350 degrees for 35 minutes ( covered with foil) , then continued to bake uncovered for 20-25 minutes more.  It was delicious and everyone loved it!

Kale also went well in this with the spinach. I added a variety of peppers also. Big hit on vacation with my friends, they even asked to take some home.

I really like this recipe. I use organic sauce and simmer that a bit with fresh peppers and onions, and some celery. I also added oregano, and basil to the mix.

I love this lasagna. I did change a couple things. Instead of using eggs I used unsweetned applesauce and instead of ricotta cheese I used Feta cheese. My husband loved it as well!!

i doubled all that delicious stuffing, as noted by other reviewers. I also added in some spices to make it more spicier to my taste.

This was stress free and easy. My son had it for breakfast the next day too, which is a thumbs up. I sauted the spinach with onions and some mushrooms I needed to use up--I could see this dish being a go to way to use up vegetables. I'll put this in my standby rotation :)
