I too was raised on Morels here in Iowa. I am 69 and have honed my methods. I agree, you need to soak in brine just long enough to kill all of the bugs that also love Morels. I quit using cracker crumbs years ago and now use Bisquick. My yearly gorge of all the morels my son-in-law can provide is also fried in butter. Also, morels are delicious when sauteed with rib eyes and/or chicken breasts with a touch of garlic. DELICIOUS!

The recipe as stated has some issues.  First, you must soak these mushrooms in salt water.  Even after doing that I still had some critters that were holding tight.  They are not like button mushrooms that soak up water, brushing won't work with these. I used the spray nozzle on faucet to really get them and sand out.  Drained well. Next, like all the others you must use butter with morels.  I know, it killed me to use 3-4 sticks to fry these - my heart was cringing!  Thank the Lord they only grow in the spring and we enjoy them only once.  I use saltines for fish frying, but I had Bisquick (which I don't normally use) so I thought I'd try that.  I found after trying both methods (first dipping in milk/egg and then mix and then combining all together like a batter)  I liked how they turned out with the batter instead.  Then the mix doesn't clump on the morels and is more evenly coated.  Add the seasoning along with a little garlic salt to the baking mix.

I like to cook my morels this way but in butter instead of oil.  It gives the mushrooms much more flavor.

Interesting. Now, I was always led to believe that cooking morels in anything but butter is a bit sacrilegious. However, I was curious. I fried a few in oil and after trying them, fried the rest in butter. I won't try frying them in oil again. Butter + Morels = Heaven. I also made some morels the usual way I prepare them for my fiance (egg and flour), but he admitted that this breading was pretty tasty. So, 4 stars because the breading was tasty. Bottom line: replace the oil with butter! Thanks :)

As a child i was raised on morels and an addiction to thier special unique flavor was created that I can never get away from.  my parents and i would literally collect large grocery bags of them and she would fry them in BUTTER with a crispy thin batter.  oooh my gosh, i can still taste the flavor of them and never knew the expensive addiction she was creating.  i have often bought $60 or $70 worth of morels just to make a dinner of them (yes i know sick but true. lol). anyway, such sweet memories were relived as i tasted this excellent recipe but i do agree with the above reviewer, frying them in butter is a NECESSITY.

Good recipe, crispy & tasty. However, I still prefer just shaking them gently in a bag with flour and a little salt & pepper, then frying them in bacon grease. Yummm

Good recipe but butter a must! I use pancake batter to coat, adds to the great morel flavor. No egg mixture. My husband likes them cooked longer, almost crispy like chips. I like them fried golden and meaty, seem to have more flavor when not overcooked. Still the greatest side dish and snack!

I'm a native Missourian, so morels are an annual treat, but this was the first year I had undertaken cooking them myself.  This recipe is PERFECT, just like the morels my grandmother used to fry!

My family has fixed Morels for many years. Grandmother ALWAYS HALVED  REMOVED ANY RED, BLACK, OR WHITE DISCOLORATIONS, THEN RINSED IN COLD WATER TO REMOVE DIRT THEN, PUT THEM IN COLD SALT WATER IN SEALED TUB IN THE FRIG OVER NIGHT! This is very important to draw out any very tiny critters living in them! Drain salt water from them and place Morel halves in a colander in your sink, Rinse with your sink sprayer cold water a couple of times. Place on paper towels to drain excess water off of them. They Are AWESOME AND SOOO RICH! Do not eat too many at once or U may get sick.

I've made them with butter or oil, butter is better, but the oil isn't bad.  Rather than crackers, we use Italian or Garlic bread crumbs.  Fry crispy for best results!

Yum! I used regular, thickly sliced mushrooms and this was great.  I didn't have saltines on hand, so I used reduced fat Keebler Club crackers.  I also added some garlic pepper and garlic salt to the cracker mixture.  This turned out awesome. I served w/ranch dressing.

I just got my second batch of morels for the year today!  Rather than salt water, I soak mine in hot tap water for 10-20 seconds.  It kicks the bugs right out.  I then soak in cold water for a few minutes.  While still wet I slice in half lengthwise and toss into a ziploc with whole wheat flour and fresh ground black pepper.  I knock off any extra flour before frying.  I think the egg overpowered mushroom to much.  I fry in just a little olive oil, but thanks to the reviews I will try butter tomorrow.

This is a classic recipe. As with any wild collected food it must be properly cleaned. Butter is a must for frying, but I like to use 2 parts butter and 1 part peanut oil. This provides that great butter flavor, but also allows for a bit higher cooking Temp, which allows for a crunchier result. As far as the breading, they are all good, just a matter of personal preference.
