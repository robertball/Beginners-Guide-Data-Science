To this recipe, I added an extra egg, 1.5 tsp baking powder (it needs to rise somehow!) and a little extra liquid - a touch of milk, a touch of water.  It did rise, though it is a little bland; mind you, if you frost it, it will be yummy - what isn't?  Good basic cake, especially if you have limited ingredients and feel comfortable tweaking it a little.

There's something missing to this - it's flat. I should have read the other reviewer's notes prior to baking. What a loss of time!

I tried this cake and don't know if I did something wrong or not, but it's flat.  It didn't raise at all.I'm just wondering if there should be baking powder or soda in it to help it to raise. It did seem like something might be missing.

I was curious about the low ratings... I can't see why anyone would even attempt to even make this recipe. it does not have the correct ingredients even for a decent chocolate cake!

Although the dough was more like brownie batter... I just added water until it was smooth and then proceeded to add 1 tsp of baking powder. My cake rose and tasted rich and yummy! I frosted it. frosting solves ANYTHING.

I don't recommend this recipe.

I should have read the reviews before mixing as well. I made the batter and doubled up each ingredient because there didn't seem to be enough, and i put them into cupcake molds because I don't have a 9x9 cake pan.

Then i read the reviews, and i agree that baking powder was missing. so with the remaining batter I tossed in some vanilla, a few pinches of baking powder, more flour, more milk and some brown sugar. Then i treated them like cookies.

the "cookies" are better than the above attempt, but still bland.

My husband made this tonight. Sadly it got  3 thumbs down.  It needs more  sugar or vanilla, something to get away from the bitter cocoa flavor

I tried this recipe, when I used it exact as indicated, it was so thick that it mixed into a ball in the bowl and stuck to the beaters, then I added some more milk, but was not sure how much to thin it out, it did not rise and it was a very heavy thick cake. Did I miss something?

I hated this recipe. It didn't taste good at all. It had bubbles on the inside that made arches under the cake, and it was very flat.

So I read all the reviews and decided to try this anyways... it actaully was pretty good. Although I "tweaked" a lot... started with the egg, milk, and oil. Added more sugar than called for (about 3/4-1cp), the flour, the cocoa. Added vanilla extract, baking powder so it would rise and a little bit of almond extract. So used this recipe as a base and added a few extras and it was good!

I would not recomend it AT ALL!!!!!! Seriously! If you want a chocolate cake, I'd suggest going with a different recipe. It didn't taste like chocolate cake!
