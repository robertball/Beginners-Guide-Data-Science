this is the best kalua pork i've ever had and i'm from hawaii.  i had no idea it was so simple to make.  i, too, found out that pork butt and pork shoulder is the same thing.  i used a boneless, 2lb cut and it made enough for my husband and me with lots of leftovers.  it is a little salty, but this is the way it's supposed to taste.  it tastes best served with white rice (shortgrain, like sushi rice, not long grain).  i also used black hawaiian sea salt, which i found at trader joe's.  trader joe's offers black and red.  but i noticed that the black sea salt also includes some charcoal ingredients, which helps it to taste more smoky and barbecued.  i also used reese's mesquite liquid smoke.  the black sea salt made the pork look really unappetizing on the outside, but once it's shredded, you can't really tell.  also, i turned it over more than once; several times, in fact, and after shredding, cooked it on low for about another hour to soak up the juices.  i added about two cups of shredded cabbage in the last hour or so, which is how it's served in hawaii.  my total cooking time was 5 hours on high and 1 hr on low.  great recipe and very impressive.

I was told by the grocery store meat dept lady that a pork butt roast IS the same thing as a pork shoulder roast.  (The, um-m, "other" would probably be called a rump roast!) :-)  So I used a near-6pound pork shoulder blade roast for this (with a bone in it).  Rubbed it with the Hawaiian red clay salt and liquid smoke and had it in the crockpot for 12 hours.  Started it on high for the first 3 hours, then low for the rest of the time.  It was moist, tender, & flavorful.  Although the liquid smoke flavor was fairly subtle, I reducing it to 1tsp would be better...just a personal preference.  When the roast was done, I drained the juices from it, took off any fat from the meat, and returned meat to the crockpot.  I then skimmed the fat from the juices, reserved 1.5c of it, and returned the rest to the meat.  I placed the 1.5c juices in a saucepan, got it simmering, and added a mixture of 2T flour/2T water to make a gravy.  (Could have stood to be a little thicker, but it was fine.)  Poured the gravy over the meat.  Served this with Suzy's Mashed Red Potatoes from this site, homemade applesauce, and peas.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

This is a great potluck recipe.  I put the juices in the crockpot into a container and into the freezer while I waited for the pork to cool enough to shred.  Then I take the hardened fat off the top and pour in the juices oil-free.  That may help make this dish less oily.

Very good recipe!  Couldn't tell much of a difference in the traditional "pig" and this recipe.  Only thing I did differently was to slice open a banana (leave in the peel) and set it on top of the roast while it cooks to give it the taste of actually being wrapped in banana leaves prior to cooking it underground (make sure you remove the banana after the pig is fully cooked).  Sounds weird, but this gives the pig a very SLIGHT sweet taste which the islands are famous for.  After shredding the meat and removing the fat from the juice, I added 1 more tsp of liquid smoke and let the pig cook in it's juice for 1 hour more.  Perfect pig!!!  Served with the Hawaiian Cold Slaw from this site (which was a perfect complement to the meal) and Sweet Hawaiian bread rolls.  If you close your eyes and listen you'd swear you could hear the waves on the beach, smell the lightly scented breeze in the palms, and feel the sand between your toes.  This recipe is that good!!  Thanks so much to Kikuchan for submitting it!!!

Having relocated from Hawaii to the mainland 6 yrs. ago, this is the same recipe we all use (even when in Hawaii, because who can afford to roast a whole pig?).

Pork Butt works the best (because that is what we are used to and it can be found for .99 lb.

Other ingredients to add:

1 Hawaiian chile pepper

and for a change of flavor:  Garlic and Bay leaves.

Since it is impossible to find Hawaiian chili peppers, I use finely and SPARINGLY chopped habanero (about 4 small slices).  It is pretty authentic.  

To those that say the roast is salty:  is because the slow cooker intensifies the flavor, so it is best to add less at the beginning and add more later if needed.  Just a good rub around the pork with Hawaiian Salt will do it.

Happy Grinds!
Aloha!

THIS WAS INCREDIBLE!!! If I could give 10 stars I would!! Thanks to margarita4, I found the sea salt(Ming Tsai brand blue ginger at Target.) At first I was looking for something in a papper package like most salts are in and for something white. But it's in a tiny glass jar and the salt is a pinky salmon color(4-oz. $3.99) I had a 7 lb. bone in pork butt. It barely fit in my crock pot, but I managed! I started it at midnight, flipped it over at 8:30 in morning and let it cook until 4:30. Added 2 tsp. additional liquid smoke. It was done before that, but I kept it going like recipe said and there was hardly any fat in this. Hard to believe only 3 ingredients could taste so good! My sister in law lived in Hawaii for 3 yrs. and said it was just like what they had there. I love pork and have had it many ways, this ranks right up there with pig roasts, it is my favorite so far. I had 8 guests and they were all ewing and awing over this. It was fabulous and will make this often. Thanks Kay for sharing this, I'm so grateful!

Really nice smoked flavor, tender, juicy and so easy.  I found Hawaiian Sea Salt at Williams-Sonoma but check with specialty/gourmet food stores in your area if you don't have time to order online.  Sometimes Hawaiian Sea Salt is called Red Clay Sea Salt and that might help you in your search.  The sea salt that I found has an iron red appearance. 
Next time I will use 1 T. Hawaiian Sea Salt as I found it to be a bit too salty for my taste and that, I am sure, is because I rarely salt my foods. 
Thank you for a very tasty recipe that I will make again.

My pork was to die for delicious.  We had around 30 people over and all they talked about was how good the meat tasted.  I bought an 8.5 lb roast, so it wouldn't fit in my crock pot.  I set the oven on 200 and let it cook in there for 20 hours.  Then when I shredded it, I put the shredded meat in the crock pot, poured some of the juices on it and put the crock pot on warm.  Thanks for the delicious recipe!

I read a lot of other reviews and was concerned with the saltiness others complained about.  I went out and found the hawaiian clay sea salt and when i tasted it, it was quite different from regular table salt and even coarse salt.  I was extrememly impressed by this dish, and having been to many luau's it is very close to what I've had there.  I think the key to the dish turning out well is to buy the hawaiian salt--it's MUCH more mild and I think that's the key.  I found the salt at whole foods market.

This recipe was fantastic!!  It was indistinguishable from the Kalua Pig my dad sends from Hawaii.  I used Trader Joe's Black Hawaiian Sea Salt.  I put a 3lb roast in the crock pot around 10:30PM, turned it over around 9AM, shredded the pork in the juices around 1PM, and had a delicious meal at 5PM.  I put the reheated leftovers over cabbage stir fried with a little soy sauce and garlic powder...and rice.  It was DELICIOUS!!!

I'm Hawaiian and have never made my own kalua pig until this year back in Oct. Since then I've made this recipe several times!  I love kalua pig and my brother was always the expert and I just thought it was terribly difficult.  What a "lolo" (in Hawaiian that means "dork")...this is the easiest thing I've made next to toast!!! I've used Hawaiian, red sea salt & sea salt from my trips to the south of France.  Both are perfect! My mom (who is a goddess in the kitchen) says only use pork butt, so that's all I used and she was right on the money.  Each time I've made it, it was for a large group of people.  I would cook it for 20-28hrs. I've served it with white sticky rice and with Hawaiian sweet rolls, so people can make little sandwiches.  I also put a small dish of Korean BBQ sauce next to the crockpot so people can choose to pour sauce on top. Either way its incredibly good.  At new years eve potluck, my dish was the first to be gone! I plan to make it again in a couple days for a bday party.  Everyone asks me if I will be making it.  Like I said, its easier than toast and will wow your friends and family. I will also add that it was too salty the first time, but since I've made it several more times I've figured it out...1Tablespoon of salt per 4lbs of meat & I add about 1.5cup of water (approx 4-5lbs meat) to dilute salt and add for more juice (to pour over rice). 
Good luck with this "ONO" (good) recipe. 
Hau'oli Makahiki Hou, e malama pono!

Wow!  My family thought it tasted better than the real imu cooked pig we ate at a luau last week.  I followed the recipe ingredients measurements on a 3lb boneless pork butt and cooked it for 10 hours.  After shredding the meat, I put the meat back into the fat oil still in the crockpot, still on at low heat and added another half tablespoon of liquid smoke.  I let it sit for about 15 minutes and it was soooo "ono" (mmmmgoood)!  Mahalo!

This was my third try making this, the first two times it was just okay, and too salty for my taste. However, the first time I only cooked it on high for 6 hours or so, then shredded and served. The second time, I cooked it overnight, then shredded and served. Both times I used white Hawaiian sea salt, but the second time I added apple sider hoping it would give it a little extra something.   I'm determined to get a good kalua recipe for a party I hope to have next month and all my searches kept coming back to this recipe so I had to give it another shot. This time, I followed some of the other reviewers tips and it was great!  Here is what I did differently:  I used a smaller (3 pound) bonless pork shoulder, 1.5 teasp MESQUITE liquid smoke, 1.5 teasp. RED hawaiian sea salt, and placed an unpeeled (but cracked open) banana on top of the roast in the crockpot. Cooked on low for 10 hours, then put the drippings in the freezer for an hour and then skimmed the fat off. Shredded the pork and placed it back in the crockpot with the defatted juices for about another 3 hours (remember I have a smaller roast) and it was so much better this time around! I think the shredding and putting it back to simmer makes a huge difference. This is now my party recipe!  Thanks to all for sharing your tips, it's much appreciated!  note: my husband has a sweet tooth and wanted me to try adding a little brown sugar at the end, so we'll try that as well, for a non authentic but sweeter variation. ;)

Can't believe the complaints this had no flavor, it's pork, salt & smoke, not supposed to have a bunch of different flavors. Does bacon have a lot of flavors? No & it's yummy! (Though this isn't supposed to be as salty as bacon). Also many saying it's way too salty, I suspect they didn't use the right kind of salt. I assume this was written for the big chunky Hawaiian sea salts, which where I shop is sold in a bag right next to canisters of super-fine Hawaiian sea salt (finer than table salt). If you use the latter it would certainly be way too salty. If I don't have the chunky salt I use half the amount of kosher salt & it's not too salty, you still get the yummy flavor of pork. This makes quite a lot of meat, & for us it's 3 whole meals...(day 1) Kalua pork, served with sticky rice & mac salad; (day 2) Pulled pork - add BBQ sauce & nuke, serve on buns; (day 3) Carnitas - crisp up the pork in a skillet with a squirt of juice from a plastic lime, sprinkle of cumin, & fresh cilantro if I have it, served with guacamole & salsa. Love it when leftovers can be made into meals that are so different they don't seem like leftovers, & all 3 of these meals are inexpensive, easy, & don't require hardly any hands-on time in the kitchen!

THIS WAS DELICIOUS.  I MADE THIS THE FIRST TIME WITH SEA SALT AS I DID NOT HAVE THE HAWAIIAN SEA SALT.  IT WAS SUPERB.  I WANTED TO MAKE IT AGAIN SO I LOOKED FOR THE HAWAIIAN VERSION IN THE STORE AND WAS SHOCKED TO SEE THE PRICE OF $14.00!  I WAS SO CURIOUS TO SEE IF THERE WAS SUCH A DIFFERENCE THAT I BOUGHT IT.  SAVE YOUR MONEY, I COULD TELL NO DIFFERENCE!  SERVED IT WITH YELLOW RICE WITH BLACK BEANS...SOOOO GOOD!

Rewrite of review..again :) -  I've been making this recipe since 2002 and its always a winner!  Its gone to work potlucks, quite a few luaus, and for a different change of pace for Christmas (2008), I made some kalua pig instead of ham or turkey for the family.  8lbs of meat (2 - approx 4lb bonesless porkbutts w/out skin...the asian markets have great butchers!) in 2 crockpots.  My family was a little peeved cause we werent having turkey or ham, but once I started shredding the meat...the buzzards (my family) started hovering around the kitchen sneaking tastes of this delicious shredded pork when I wasnt looking.  My tips for this recipe - If you have an asian market in your city, go there for your meat.  Get a bonesless cut (I paid a little more than $11 for 8lbs of meat!). Pierce meat and rub with sea salt and smoke.  I eyeball the amount and never measure.  But I will tell you, do the smoke first and then the sea salt. Go easy on the sea salt as the liquid smoke already has a high sodium content.  Cook low for 10 hours. Drain/shread meat and put back in crockpot to keep warm.  Try to keep your family from eating all the meat before mealtime.  For my grandad, I heated up some homemade bbq sauce (he has problems swallowing and needs everything coated to do gown easier), but everyone (including him) said that the meat was fantastic just on its own. Great recipe!!!

This is delicious! I have vacationed in Hawaii many times and was so delighted to find an easy version to try at home. After reading pages and pages of reviews, and making this several times, I have found the perfect recipe to suit everyone I have entertained. This recipe is pretty much fool-proof, only things I do different are: remove the big layer of fat; I find the marbling throughout the pork butt/shoulder gives off enough juices. Then add about a half cup of pineapple juice to the slowcooker, add my fork stabbed, salt rubbed and liquid smoked pork, then topped with 2 bananas, peels on and just a slit along it length wise. Thats it! After 6 hours I flip it, another 6 and its ready to shred! Juices go into a tall glass and into the freezer while I shred, skim off fat, then return fatless juices to the slowcooker with the now shredded pork. I leave in for about an hour to soak up juices, then serve however I feel like it. One of my favorite ways is to cook this overnight, then for breakfast make scrambled eggs, the Kalua pork, and wrap in a whole wheat tortilla. Yup! I use a 5.5 bone in shoulder/butt.

SIMPLY INCREDIBLE! If it all possible FIND Hawaiian Sea Salt, it makes a difference. A nice pork butt, bone in with some fat, a couple of bananas with a small slice down the side placed on top. Put it in and leave it alone for 20 hours except for a halfway turn. Drain off the fat by either placing in the freezer and skimming or using a fat separator. Pour back in the juices and throw in a little crushed pineapple with some juice and some hot peppers and it's WOW TIME. I'm embarassed to tell people how easy this is!! Thanks so much!!!

This is the real deal! I am from Hawaii and living in the mainland, so no imu roasts in the yard like we had growing up. Slow cooker is the next best thing. This is basically the same recipe I have been using to introduce the mainlanders to our way of eating. Sea salt is a must!  If you use regular salt it will be way too salty. I have just 2 small recommendations. 1) Place the pork butt with the fat side up to start.  2) Mix the liquid smoke with 2 cups water and pour over the top before coating with the sea salt. With the water added, no need to turn the pork.  Just let it cook on high for 8-10 hours and shred. Add the pork back to the liquid because it's loaded with flavor. ...

To really go island style, chop up a head of cabbage and add to the shredded pork then cook until it softens.  May need a little pepper and soy sauce as the cabbage sucks up the salt. Broke da mouth! (delicious)

Made this for my family and everyone loved it.  I did use red hawaiian salt (Williams Sanoma) I used a baggie over my hand to rub the salt and liquid smoke over the pork so my hand didn't smell like liq. smoke.   I cooked it on high for about 6 hours, removed the pork and  the fat and shredded the meat.  I drained the liquid then placed in the freezer to strain the fat.  Added the shredded pork to the crock pot with some of the strained liquid. Cooked for 2 more hours...perfect!

I'm from Hawaii, and this IS a great starter recipe!  Once the pork is done cooking, I remove it from the slow cooker (save the drippings), shred it, and add a small cabbage (quartered), and 1 large sweet Maui onion (sliced). I toss it with the pork and juices, and 1 tbl. shouyu and, add it back into the slow cooker.  I cover it, put it on medium, and cook for an additional 45 minutes to soften the cabbage and onions. If I'm pressed for time, I've also sauteed the cabbage and onions to decrease the cooking time. This also goes great with a nice coleslaw and pineapple salad on the side. (P.S. Choosing a good Hawaiian Sea Salt is important...look for the words "Alae" in the title.  Amazon carries a few).

I had such great expectations after reading all these wonderful reviews.  First I had never used a Boston Butt Roast---Even though I trimmed and trimmed the cut of meat,this dish still was fattier than what I am used to after cooking. What saved the day was the Carolina Bar-b-que Sauce recipe that I found on this site. If it had not been for that sauce this would have been a big flop. And even then it was not as outstanding as these reviews would indicate.

Wow! Seemed too simple to be flavorful. I cooked a 9lb shoulder butt, so I increased the salt and liquid smoke by a smidge. On low it only took 9hrs, not 20. I went to turn it at 9h and it fell apart. I made this the night before a party, shredded it and put the juices from the crockpot in a container in the fridge. Cooled, I skimmed the congealled fat from the sauce leaving the gelatin-like juices, reheated the juice, added another splash of liquid smoke (easy to over-do so go slow) the reheated the whole pot of yumminess. People at this party wanted to know if they should put BBQ sauce on it. I told them to try it first. Needless to say, the BBQ sauce stayed on the table and NOT on the pork. I served it on  King's Hawaiian honey wheat buns, and topped with fresh LIGHTLY vinegared slaw. The sweetness of the buns, the salty smokey pork and crispy cole slaw..Perfect Combo

Absolutely the best.  I did mine with clean banana skins (3) and it was just enough to sweeten slightly.  Reminded me of home in Hawaii.  The banana skin adds that special something other slow cooker recipes lacks.

This is an outstanding recipe, and one I have been making for sometime now. In order to mimic the bannana leaves, I always put a layer of fresh greens (Spinach, kale, etc.) in the bottom of the slow cooker before I place the roast. The greens also make a great accompaniment to the pork. Forget the mesurement of the salt and liquid smoke. Just rub the roast first with sprinkles of liquid smoke and use enough salt to coat. Place upon a hefty bed of greens and cook on low overnight and into the next day. YUM!!!

I've been making this recipe for a long time now but I never had the pink salt so I had been using regular sea salt. It's still really good. However, I finally came across some pink sea salt and made a 4lb roast. I've never measured the salt. Always just rub the meat down well and sprinkle a a little on top. As for the liquid smoke, I've always used Stubb's but sure any brand should do the job. I never measure that either. Just a couple splashes depending on the size of the meat. Doesn't really take much and still does taste very good if you put too much. A pork roast with bone-in to me taste better but still cheaper and very good without the bone. Don't over cook! Can get dry. We like to leave juices in. Get a pack of Kings Hawaiian Sweet Rolls and that's all you need. If not moist enough, try adding Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce on the roll. My husband bugs for me to make this often. Really is a perfect recipe for pot lucks and large gatherings with little work very few dishes.

**To the people who are not giving this a 5 star rating, I seen some used pork loin or regular salt. SEA SALT/HAWAIIAN SEA SALT (the pink Hawaiian sea salt is best), liquid smoke, pork butt or shoulder, a crock pot and a utensil to turn the meat one time while cooking is ALL you need. One of the best tasting and easiest recipes you will ever make.

Extremely tasty!  Try this...  Add a cup of pineapple juice as well as a splash of soy sauce to help with the flavor, (please try this instead of using bbq sauce which defeats the purpose of making Kalua pork). Also add sauteed some cabbage sauteed in soy sauce to shredded pork.    I served with a cold macaroni salad (a simple hawaiian version)  Cook 1/2 lb macaroni the rince with cold water.  Add 1 cup best foods mayo, 1 finely shredded carrot and 1 cup finely shredded chicken breast  Paired on the side of the pork and cabbage over white rice, its delicious and seems to cut the saltiness of the dish. Yum yum!

This recipe is fabulous!! We love Kalua pork, but I made one change:  I used a 4.5 lb turkey breast instead of pork since we don't eat much pork. I followed the recipe exactly, except it only took about 9 hrs to cook the turkey.  It was so good! It was not dry and we used all of the dripping that it produced as it was shredded. It was not oily at all.  The only thing I think it needed a little more salt and maybe a little more liquid smoke (I think pork is cured w/ salt, so maybe that's why the turkey needs more salt). But overall, the flavor was authentic. We live in Hawaii/are Hawaiian. Mahalo for this recipe.  I plan to try it with pork in the future and continue making kalua turkey! :)

This is a great alternative to cooking a pig in an imu (in the ground).  The best way to make kalua pig and cabbage is to remove the meat once it is finished cooking.  Add shredded cabbage to the broth in the slow cooker and cook on high until done.  Put pork back into the slow cooker and mix everything.  Serve on top of rice.  Chili water as a condiment (or even just hot pepper sauce) is the true way to enjoy this "broke da mout" meal.  

P.S. Pork butt can be found in Asian grocery markets.  Do not use shoulder!

Very good as per recipe. You have to try. 
A lot of people 'change' recipes and rate.  Not me.  Want to have some fun with a similar Kalua Pork as well?  Cut the salt to 1 Tablespoon and,  yes this sounds weird but it works perfectly, place 2 UNPEELED bananas with the tips cut off on top of the roast when you start the slow cooker.  By the time the roast is done the bananas will have melted away and you simply remove the leftover banana skins for the trash. Yes it sounds weird and NO it does not impart a nasty banana taste.  It works. Been serving it to rave reviews for over 30 years.

Note to self:  Remake recipe.  Intriguing recipe because of how simple it was!  Do not use table salt or kosher salt, large crystal salt is very important so recipe doesn't come out over salted, I used some grey salt that I buy from the bulk bins at the healthfood store, (very inexpensive way to buy spices!)  Do not be tempted to use even one crystal more salt than the recipe calls for!!!  I know it's hard to believe this recipe will work with only three ingredients but it does!  I trimmed excess fat off the pork before putting in on High for 8 hours.  Great advice from others about putting the juices (there will be a lot of juice!) in the freezer while you shred the meat and removing the excess fat that way once it starts to solidify.  Add the defatted juices back to the meat and mix well.

It's goooood! First time I messed up, because I tried to cut the recipe down to just a couple pounds of meat. Well it overcooked in my pot because I was out of the house and not able to check the slow cooker. My fault. So today I picked up a new hunk of just about 6 pounds. If there's anything that needs adjusting it's the cooking time. Even on slow, it took less than 10 hours and one flip of the shoulder to cook completely. My slow cooker is (6 quarts?) and the extra weight in the shoulder paid off. When I used two pounds there wasn't enough juice in the cooker to tenderize the meat. 6.3lbs barely fit my crock pot, but the juices nearly covered the meat, moistened it with Alea salty goodness, and fell apart. I used to pay $20 for a serving of Kalua pig half this size. We'll be having this often!

wow,  this was as great as everyone said it is.  The first time I cooked it on high for 10 hours and the 2nd time on low for 20.  Couldn't tell the difference.  Next time I'll do the 10 hours so I don't have to be kept awake by the wonderful smell that it gives off.  Found Hawaiin sea salt at a local asian food market.  FYI it's orange in color.

I have made this numerous times now but always forget to leave a review. I am still completely dumbfounded over this recipe. It is ridiculously easy and I still have no idea how it is possible to get such great flavorful and tender meat out of something with so few ingredients and insanely simple. 5 stars all the way!

WARNING:  You may not get any time to yourself if you let your family taste this before you serve it.  My meat-challenged toddler (usually still chewing an hour after dinner) said it was "yummy in his tummy" and he and his little brother wouldn't stop climbing my legs until I gave them a bowl full (placed far enough away from me to catch my breath).  Then I didn't get to sit down because by the first bite my husband knew he was going to want another tortilla which I had to cook.   This versatile dish is fantastic plain, as burrito filling, with BBQ sauce, Trader Joe's Cuban Mojito sauce -- use your imagination.  The cut of meat I used was a pork sirloin that comes from Costco in a 3-pack and weighed less than two pounds (and they don't have a speck of fat on them).  I used 1 t. each of regular sea salt (didn't pick up any Hawaiian yet) and hickory liquid smoke and 8 hours on low gave me a moist, amazingly tender, easy to shred roast.

Can you say delicious? Absolutely delicious! The meat was so tender and tasted so good! Everyone kept coming up with reasons to go into the kitchen and sneak bites before dinner was officially served! I poured the drippings/juice, etc. from my slower cooker into a pan and then added a couple handfuls of ice and placed it in the freezer so that the fat would separate out of the liquid.  I skimmed the fat off the top and then used the remaining juice to create a gravy (used equal parts (1 tbsp each) of butter and flour then added the juice brought to a boil and let it thicken). I poured/mixed the gravy into the shredded pork. It was so-oo-oo good! I will definitely make this again...so tasty and so simple! Thank you for a great recipe!

I made this to take with us on a camping trip this weekend.  It is delicious!  I had never used Hawaiian sea salt before and I believe that is what makes this so good.  I only used a 4 lb. roast as there are only 3 people eating it.  I still used a tablespoon of the liquid smoke and I used almost 1-1/2 tablespoons of sea salt and it has wonderful flavor!  My husband had me make our usual garlic hot sauce we have at our pig roasts, but I don't think I'll be putting any on mine!

SUPER easy, SUPER tasty and this will be a staple in our house from now on. Ended up using Himalayan red sea salt since that's all our grocery stores had (tried 3 different locations!)

We ended up serving ours plain on some King's Hawaiian rolls. Excellent!

Next time, I'll add a little more smoke flavoring, some whole garlic cloves and maybe a hot pepper or two for some kick since we really like that and I might try the banana peel. I did order some red Hawaiian sea salt online since we loved the first try.

Seriously, you HAVE to try this recipe. Couldn't be easier and who would have thought only 3 ingredients would have so much flavor! We did the overnight on one side, flipped and let it go for another 5 hours or so then shredded and let it rip for another 4 hours. SO tender and flavorful!

I thought this was great. Tender and moist - and so EASY! I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out wonderfully. Had it "as is" for dinner one night, then added BBQ sauce and made BBQ pork sandwiches with the leftovers the next day. Delicious. I plan on making this again for the next party/BBQ - an easy and economical way to feed a crowd. UPDATE 8-1-07 I have made this using regular sea salt with equally good results. Also, I now double the salt & liquid smoke to 3 Tbsp sea salt and 2 Tbsp liq smoke for 6 lbs of pork. I've used pork shoulder/butt, even tenderloin with great success. Such a great recipe!

As someone who has grown up eating kalua pig in Hawaii, this is absolutely what you can expect to taste if you were to order it at a Hawaiian eatery.  I've made this exact recipe at least 5 times since adding it, always receives rave reviews at family gatherings, potlucks, office parties, in a word, it's ONO!!

Wonderful and super easy!  Used the pig to make "Kalua Pig Burritos" like we had on North Shore and they was very tasty!  Found the salt online @ The Spice Lab; it's called Hawaiian Red Alaea No. 12.  I purchased the fine grain, but you do have the option to choose coarse.  My pig was done after 9 hours on low - and yes I used the 6# - my crock is pretty new and definately gets hotter (even on low) than my old one.  I was able to shred the pork right in the crock and let it soak up all the delicious juices for an additonal 2 hours.  Just like butta!  To assemble the burritos, place some pig on your large warmed tortilla, add some cooked white rice, carmelized onions, a little cheese and a drizzle of warmed bbq sauce.  Roll up burrito style and enjoy!

Perfect just the way it is. Don't change a thing. I get so many requests for this I went to amazon and ordered a multipack of the hawaiian salt! Thanks for the recipe.

I was born and bred in Hawaii and I have to say that this recipe is DELICIOUS - just like they make back home.

A few minutes before serving, I added in some shredded cabbage and it was very yummy. I also served with steamed white rice.

Even after reading the other reviews, I couldn't believe something so easy could be so tasty, and yet it's INCREDIBLE! I found the Hawaiian salt on the net, no tax, no shipping charges, and followed the simple instructions.  Served with Hawaiian sweet bread rolls from the market, rice and fresh pineapple, and it was a mainland luau. Will do this 'pig out' again!  Thanks for a great recipe.

EXCELLENT! I read many reviews and I agree--extremely simple & tasty! I used a 3.6lb Pork butt, 2t plain sea salt(that was all I could find, even tried TJ's), and 1+1/4t liquid smoke (hickory flavor). I cooked it on high for 4 hours, turned over and added 1/2 of a med. sweet onion that I had in the frig. Cooked it 1 more hour on high then switched it to low for the duration. After 7 hours total, the pork looked cooked--I checked it with a thermometer and it was done indeed. I took out the pork (which was falling apart) and shredded (an easy task!) then placed it back in the crock pot and added 2/3 head of chopped green cabbage and a chopped sweet onion, which I steamed for 5 minutes on the stove (probably would've skipped, but thought we were going to eat sooner). Back on low for about another 1-2 hours to simmer in its own juices. Somewhere during this time I ladled out the juices into a liquid measuring cup, placed in the freezer for 10-15 minutes, and skimmed off the fat, and added a bit of water so that I returned the same amount of liquid back to the crock pot that I'd removed. The pork was so tender succulent and we LOVED this recipe! Served with rice and a Sesame Cabbage Salad found elsewhere on the internet.  We like spicy so added a dab of Sriracha hot chili sauce. EXCELLENT! Also pairs well with Fire Rock Pale Ale from the Kona Brewing Co.  What a spectacular feast!  :)  Thanks for the recipe!!!

I love kalua pork.  I am from Hawaii, and this is the common kalua pork recipe floating around the island.  The only thing I do different is add 1/3 cup of water to the pot, so it doesn't turn out so salty.  I also like to shred an entire head of cabbage about an hour or so before the pork is ready to be eaten.  It's always a hit and everyone always requests it.  This is a fool proof recipe.

My mom is from Hawaii & we only get to eat Kalua pig when we go visit family there, which isn't very often.  So when I saw this recipe & how easy it was I had to try it.  This recipe is absolutely delicious!!! I made a few adjustments...9 lbs Pig Butt Roast, 1 1/2 tbls Hawaiian Salt, & 3 tbls Liquid Smoke.  Cook for 20 hours, flip once.  The Hawaiian Salt was easy to find at Wholefoods...it's a pink color.  The roast fills my whole crock pot & makes the best juices to put over rice or to cook cabbage in.  (I take all the juice from the roast & put it in the frige.  Once the fat is on top I scoop it out to cut down on fat.)  Thanks for this awesome recipe!

This was so amazing. Unbelieveably simple! I never really liked pork much until I ate this. WOW! The pork roast was still mostly frozen when I started this. I used sea salt, next time I'd like to try the Hawaiian salt.

Amazing! So easy to make & delicious!  I cooked 6.89 lbs of pork shoulder butt for 18 hours on low and used Alaea (fine) Hawaiian Sea Salt from Saltworks ($8.95 for 16 ounces and free ship special).  I was hesitant to spend xtra $ but after reading other reviews I decided to use the Hawaiian salt and Im very glad I did - it tastes like authentic kalua pig and was not too salty. I used the recommended amt of liquid smoke and 1 1/2 tbsp. salt but realized my measurement of fine, not coarse salt may make too salty and ended up dabbing some salt off w/ a wet paper towel.  I also placed an open banana in peel on top and 1/2 cup water. Pork was easily shread and skimmed fat off after placing juices in freezer briefly per others suggestions. Put juices and addl tsp of liquid smoke back in shreaded pork & cooked addl 20 on low.  Perfection and extra water gave extra juices needed! Thx for this wonderful recipe!  NOTE:  Recent reviewer gave low stars bc expected "Kahlua", for this "Kalua" recipe.  Shame for reviewing based on your ignorance & not even making recipe!  Look up definitions which took all of 10 seconds "Kalua" literally means cooking in underground oven and is Hawaiian cooking method, NOT "Kahlua" the liqueur.

Really a great recipe. You can use any sea salt, but the pink salt has a little something special to it. I have let it cook the 20 hours and also cooked it 8 hours and both were fabulous.  Serve with macaroni salad for authentic Hawaiian fare.  Yum!

I can't believe I haven't rated & reviewed this recipe before now!  I have been using it for at least three years!  It's my go to pulled pork recipe!  We have it plain the first night, BBQ sandwiches the 2nd night, and BBQ Stuffed Baked Potatoes the 3rd night!  We love it!

I've made this twice.  The first time, I followed the recipe as written.  It was really good, but the juice was very salty, so I added it a little at a time to the shredded pork. The juice is very flavorful so you really don't need a lot to get that smoky flavor worked into the meat. 

I read a review about adding additional items like garlic and bay leaves, and that's what I did the second time I made it.  I rubbed garlic powder on the roast and added 1/2 of a large bay leaf to the cooker after the juice rendered from the pork.  

I don't cook with or eat a lot of salt so I had to cut back on the amount of salt in the recipe.  I used less than a tablespoon to rub on a 6.5lb roast.  The meat wasn't salty. The juice was still salty, but very flavorful so I added it a little at a time to the shredded pork, tasting after each addition, until it was just right.  I'll use even less salt next time.

Also the newer slow cookers don't cook as slow as the older ones. I have a Breville slow cooker that I've had for 6 years, and it will cook the roast in about 8 hours on low.  

I served the shredded roast with braised cabbage and rice.

Islander or mainlander, you're gonna LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe... honestly, I add a touch more "smoke" to mine for my family tastes.  It is perfect!  Don't hesitate on this one! (Also, if you don't have sea salt, regular works.. so don't panic - just use less - salting to taste after cooking is always healthier)  Aloha!

Reminds me of being in Hawaii again! It was so easy to make and the only problem with it was having to wait to eat it! I did only have to cook it for about 10-12 hours before it was ready, as opposed to the 16-20 hours that it suggests.

SUPER YUMMY!!! I've made this dish several times now and everyone loves it!!! I recommend making it with the Island-Style Fried Rice. They go well together. Just don't add the Spam to the rice and you're good to go.

Made this as a trial run recipe for my sister's upcoming luau themed birthday party. If you're going to make this, make sure you have LOTS of time to cook it. I put it on at 5pm and it was done the next day at 8am. I had my husband taste it and he said while it was good, it was a wee bland. Plus it doesn't have that flavor an authentic Kalua pork has, from Hawaii. If you've actually had Hawaiian Kalua pork, cooked in the ground, this recipe isn't even close in flavor. Either way, it was good but for the looong cooking time I don't know if it's really worth it. It makes a ton, which is good. We put Pepper Plant pepper sauce on some of it and made tacos. The other 1/2 I topped with a homemade pineapple based BBQ sauce and making pulled pork sandwiches.

So easy! So good!  Leftovers were usable as pork tacos (just add spanish rice and cheese) and pulled pork sandwiches (just add bbq sauce and a bun).  I did make a 7 1/2 lb roast though so I had plenty of leftovers.  Also, I have a 2010 Hamilton Beach slow cooker that tends to cook faster on low.  It only took me 9 hours max on low setting for it to be done.  We put it on the warm setting until we were ready to eat since we thought we had MANY more hours left until it would be done.  Made me regret getting up before the sun to put this in the crock pot.  I am thinking that the person who made it and posted it originally has a very OLD crock pot that cooks very slowly.  Just keep that in mind when making this.  Hate for anyone else to lose valuable sleep needlessly too.   Other than that... VERY GOOD!  VERY!!!!!

Super , simple recipe. Some cooks ended up with dried out Pork, which is terrible. Since different models of cookers can provide different low/high temps the best way to judge doneness is with an internal temp. Pork is ready to shred at @200 deg, going to 210 will not dry it out, and a little easier to shred!!!!

Unreal and so easy. I'm not usually a big liquid smoke fan but this is outrageous. I needed it to cook while at work and the 20 hr time didn't pencil out for my schedule. So I cooked my 4.5 lb roast for 5 hr on high first. Came home at lunch to check on it and turn it down to low. It was pretty much done already. But I turned it to low for the next 5 hr. It was just past the point of perfection and beginning to dry out. Another half-hour and it would have been ruined. I am thinking that 10 hr on low would be fine. I'll give it a try next time and update my notes with the results.

Update.... in my crock pot (Rival 6 qt) cook time is about 3 hr per pound on Low setting.

This is super simple to make, and is just as good as any of the local take-out places in Hawaii.  A few hours before I want to serve it,  I put the juices in tall cups and put in the freezer when shredding the meat to help remove some of the fat.  Then as I'm shredding the meat, I remove any large chunks - not so much because I am concerned about fat content but because I don't like the slimy feeling it leaves in my mouth.  Then, once the meat is shredded and fat removed, I put it back in the crockpot.  Take the juices out of the freezer, remove the fat that has floated to the top, and add all the juice back to the crockpot too.  MMM.

I've used this recipe for a long time.  Found it originally in a cookbook by Jeff Smith, the Frugal Gourmet about 15 years ago. Coarse grained kosher salt can be substituted if you can't find the Hawaiian sea salt.

We fly my mom (who is Hawaiian) out here and always beg her to make her amazing kalua pig. She slow roasts it in the oven with ti leaves from Hawaii.  Ti leaves are hard to come by here in the Midwest, so I tried this recipe hoping for a little taste of home.  I was not disappointed by the wonderful flavors!  A great recipe and takes almost no effort to cook in the crockpot.  Be sure to use Hawaiian salt - there is no substitute for the flavor.  I have tried it with both black and red(known as Alaea)salt and prefer the taste and color of the red.  Mesquite liquid smoke has a milder flavor than hickory, if you have a preference - I use hickory. Kalua pig should have a lot of liquid so add a 1/4 cup water at the beginning of the cooking process to keep it moist.  If your pork does dry out, add hot salted water to the pot. For goodness sake, don't ruin this delicious dish with barbecue sauce!  Be sure to stir fry some with Napa cabbage and shoyu or throw some spinach in the crockpot in the last 30 minutes.  Must serve over rice!

So good! I didn't even use Hawaiian salt. I just rubbed the roast with kosher salt added one TBSP of liquid smoke and kept it on low for the full 20 hours. I think cooking it that long makes all the difference. Not sure if my crockpot is a bit too hot, but I didn't have any drippings and it started to get a bit toatsy on the bottom, so I just added some water every now and then to make sure nothing burned. I freeze the leftovers and thaw/reheat in the microwave (2-3 mins) in a bowl with a TBSP of water and cover with plastic wrap. You can't go wrong with this recipe!

I have made this recipe many times and have gotten raves every time.
Since I always make way too much, we use this to make other pork dishes too.  Adding home-made bar-b-que sauce makes fantastic pulled pork for sandwiches.  Tortilla chips and shredded cheese with some of the pork (put under the broiler to melt cheese) makes yummy "carnita" nachos.  I also add diced red onions and cilantro to the nachos....fantastic.
Plus this freezes like a dream!

EXCELLENT!!  I've made this twice now using Himalayan sea salt (it was the only salmon-colored one at Trader Joe's) - the only change I made was to add the banana cut in half length-wise (skin on, removed it first thing in the morning.)  Served on small King's Hawaiian savory butter rolls, with Sweet Restaurant Coleslaw from AR.  Wish there were leftovers so I could have some for lunch today! ;)

My husband and I brought back Hawaiian Sea Salt after visiting Maui. I eyeballed this for a long time, but was reluctant to try it, as I don't like liquid smoke. I'm so glad I decided to go for it! I didn't change a thing- and it was perfectly wonderful. I can't stop eating it, and know I will make it anytime I wish to impress someone :) I served it on sandwiches with BBQ sauce for one meal and over white rice with some of the pan drippings for another meal. Perfect recipe!

I made this about 3 weeks ago.  I ordered red Alaea sea salt from Amazon.  I also went to the butcher shop to get the cut of pork butt...I didn't want anything that had been treated with saline or solutions.  I didn't have banana leaves so I put two whole bananas in the crock pot.  Once the pork was cooked I drained the juice and put it in the freezer for about half an hour...you'd be amazed at how much fat settled at the top.  I scraped that off and used the rest of the juice to moisten the meat.  This was easy to make and delicious.  It tasted just like the Kalua pig I ate at the Luaus in Hawaii.  My family enjoyed it so much I made it two weekends in a row.  As they say on the Islands, it was Ono!

Due to the fact that I had to cook 2 huge roasts simultaneously, to the tune of about 15 #'s total, these wouldn't fit into my crockpot. I ended up cooking them together in my dome covered turkey roaster. This was such a simple, carefree, easy thing to cook, I almost felt like I was somehow cheating. I started them at 11:30 pm in a 200 degree oven and by 7, when my daughter woke up for school, she thought that I had bacon cooking. The smell was so tempting and mouthwatering I could hardly stand it. I took it out of the oven about 2 pm and let it rest. I needed it for an event that evening and didn't bother to shred it until almost dinner time. Quickly re-heated it and got rave reviews from all party goers. I served it with fenadeni sauce from this site and steamed rice. Just delicious!

This recipe is how I make Kalua pig, too, and always to rave reviews.  A couple hours before it's done, I add as much chopped cabbage as will fit in the slow cooker on top of the pork, and then serve it Hawaiian style with cabbage and pork over white sticky rice, and with Hawaiian macaroni salad on the side.  Mmmmm!

This recipe is good, but it didn't really taste like the kalua pig / pork that I had in Hawaii.  It's missing a couple dimensions of flavor, although I am not 100% sure what that is...I know a lot recipes call for banana leaves, so I wonder if that's it?  Anyway, the liquid smoked helped a little, but it wasn't a cureall.  Don't get me wrong, the pork tasted good, but it needed "something."  Also, I did not cook it for 16 to 20 hours...that would be waaaaaay overcooked and probably dry out the meat.  I cooked it on high for 2 hours to get the juices going and then on low for 4 more hours and the meat was falling off the bone tender.  (Yes, meat will dry out regardless of whether it's swimming in juices or not when it's overcooked...the meat will lose its ability to hold moisture and you'll have jerky!)

After reading all the positive results, I just knew I would be in the minority and this dish would fail for me. Boy, was I wrong!  I used a 6lb bone-in roast, which looked very fatty to me, dropped it in, put in the smoke and salt, and viola! It was perfect, and almost all the fat had melted away.  
I made this dish once with Kosher salt and once with the Hawaiian Salt. Both times I salted the meat moderately at the beginning, after in the morning, I pulled a piece from the bottom for a taste test and salted it to taste. I skimmed some of the fat off the top of the crock pot, and pulled some of the solid fat out. I was even able to pull out the bone with no effort. When I got home that afternoon, it was perfectly seasoned.

For those who don't know whether it's worth it to go and look for the Hawaiian salt, I can only say it tastes like sea salt- pure, mellow, and natural. It's a fine grain and very good on more than just your roast!

This was so good and simple! I started with 8.5 lbs of pork butt/shoulder and gave it a good wash and pat dry. I rubbed about 1.25 tablespoon white Himalayan salt all over the pork and 1 tablespoon Wrights liquid smoke. I cooked for 11 hours on low and then took the meat out. I poured the remaining pork liquid into a glass bowl (there was so much!) and threw away huge chunks of fat.  Then I cut half a head of shredded cabbage into the slow cooker with the Kalua pork. I poured about 1 cup of pork liquid back in. Cooked on low for another hour so that the cabbage breaks down. The salt and smoke flavor was perfect. Add more liquid if needed! It was so good and easy!!

My wife and I make this frequently. The only difference is that we put about a cup of water in the slow cooker. Also, with a bit of water it only takes around 8-10 hours, depending on size of butt and altitude. I'll try it without the water next time. 

We have done both boneless and bone-in and find the bone-in has more flavor. That shouldn't be a surprise to anyone. 

Of course, the perfect complement to this recipe (and mandatory in my house) is poi??.

This was very flavorful, moreso than I expected with only 3 ingredients!  So easy to make.  My only recommendation is to cut back on the salt by about half a tbsp (to start, may need more) only because the meat did come out a little too salty for me.

My husband's Grandmother is Hawaiian and his brother lives there. He swears this tastes like the traditional pig. I used Applewood liguid smoke and Hawaiian sea salt. It is a larger grain of salt and so you do not need as much. I cooked mine for 20 hours on low and it was fabulous. You can buy Hawaiian sea salts via Amazon, if you do not have a local resource market.

This was AWESOME!!  It is hard to believe that so few ingredients created such a flavorful meal.  The only "mistake" I made was to pour the juice back over the meat when I stored it.  While it kept the meat from drying out, the salt was reabsorbed and it became very salty the next day.  Other than that, it was wonderful!

I've made Kalua pork in a slow oven before (wrapped in banana leaves), and it's always turned out spectacular. I was hoping this recipe would be at least as good. Not so. 

I lined the crockpot with banana leaves, wrapping the entire roast in leaves. Instead of the salt, I used soy sauce. I think the problem was the cooking time. The recipe calls for 16-20 hours. I turned if off at 15 hours, and it was WAY overdone and totally dried out with no flavor. If I try this again, I will check it at 10 to 12 hours.

Hawaiian Salt has the best PR team ever-- because I can assure you there's not a bit of difference in this roast than when I use my regular salt.  The Hawaiian Salt was $11.60 & took 3 trips to find it!!!  Definitely NOT worth it, however, slow cooked pork roast is as wonderful as ever.

I don't care for pork, but I've used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and it turns out great.  Kosher salt works just fine, also. Wonderful to eat with rice or use leftovers in burritos or tacos.

Really good and couldn't be easier. I used Hawaiian Red Sea Salt and skimmed the fat off the cooled "juice" like other reviewers - had plenty of liquid, BTW. After shredding & returning liquid to cooker and letting it go a couple of more hours, we thought it needed just a little "something". I added garlic, adobo seasoning and a dash of browning sauce. Definitely a keeper recipe.

This has become a favorite in my home. I much prefer it to the typical shredded pork smothered in barbecue sauce. The flavor of the meat is the star. For those in my family who do crave the sauce, I serve it on the side.

Amazing, Wonderful, Any adjective I could use wouldn't describe how wonderful this was.  I cooked it overnight in my brand new crock pot and my guest raved about it.  He took most of the leftovers home with him.  I'll definitely make this again.  BTW - I also put barbecue sauce on the table for use but it's more than delicious without it.

I am on Kauai and love kalua pork. This recipe tasted just like all the kalua pig I have enjoyed here. The simplicity of this reciped works. I used Wrights Hickory Smoke and that gave it the flavor I like the best. I have a Hawaiian liquid smoke but the taste is not the same. I also used a black Hawaiian Salt called Black Lava made here. Now I have had some REALLY salty kalua pig - almost inedilble. I did use less salt to cook it because you can always add more. Mine turned out perfectly served over unseasoned white rice. I also cooked it on high for 4 hours, turning it once after 2 hours, and then pulled it apart and returned it to the juice for the next hour on low. Thanks for a great, easy recipe!

By following the instructions to the letter, I ended up with the most delicious, succulent pulled pork that I have ever had the privilege of tasting!!  This dish will be a summer staple.  Thank you SO much for posting this recipe!!  Update:  This is one of the most requested meals that I make, especially in the summer.  I've made it dozens of times since the initial review.  If you want good results, do NOT substitute!  I order my Alaea Hawaiian (red) Sea Salt from Amazon.  It is not as salty as kosher salt, and gives a beautiful pink color to the meat.  Also, don't substitute a less fatty cut of pork, or you'll end up with something dry and inedible.  Use pork shoulder roast exclusively for this, and don't trim the fat -- it's necessary to keep your pig moist during cooking.  You can always de-fat the drippings after it's cooked.  RUB that sea salt into the meat, then rub it again as you apply the liquid smoke.  I start this around midnight on low, fat-side up, then flip it early the next morning.  Using the 6lb roast called for in the directions, I usually shred it at 12 hours, de-fat the broth, add the pork back in with a little more liquid smoke, and leave it on low for another hour or so.  Stellar results, each and every time.

This is by far the easiest and tastiest Kalua Pig recipe I have ever tried!  It is a wonderful dish to share at potlucks and sports parties!   I found the Red Hawaiian sea salt by Hawaii Kai to be one of the best! It is moist and flavorful.   I purchased a bag of their Palm Island brand of sea salt at Whole Foods...try the black too it is wonderful.  Their salt is better then whatever Trader Joes is selling now as it is not as moist and flavorful.   Anyway, not sure how much difference it makes in the end result of the recipe, but I love good salt so I thought I would share!     Loui

This is awesome! Unfortunately I didn't have Hawaiian sea salt & had to substitute fleur de sel, a French sea salt. I've since ordered the Hawaiian salt & will be making massive quantities of this for our family reunion next year. This recipe is going to make me look like a star & I thank you for posting it:o)

Simple & delicious!  I used a 3lb. pork shoulder.  It turned out very tasty and moist.  I cooked some egg noodles and added a little turkey gravy and then the meat.  Unbelieveably good for just using 2 ingredients!  Will make again.  I found my Hawaiian Sea Salt (Ming Tsai label) at Target (food aisle), of all places, in case anyone is interested so you don't have to order online.

Excellent. I had a 3# pork shoulder blade roast that I had to halve to make it fit into my 4 qt slow cooker. The roast does break down and the liquid smoke does its job. It is truly a delicious recipe that requires little effort. It took 7-8 hrs for my smaller roast and I will be making it again.

This recipe is a great recipe and makes super moist pork. We use it for tacos, pulled pork sandwiches and even Cuban sandwiches.

Loved this simple recipe! Used a 8lb pork shoulder and cooked on high for 3 hours and low for 6 hours. Shredded meat and drained juices into a bowl and put in the freezer. Once fat hardened on top of the bowl, scraped off and returned remaining liquid and meat to slow cooker. Added liquid smoke and hawaiian salt to taste and cooked for one more hour on low. Received rave reviews!

This is my second time making this recipe exactly as written and it is fabulous! I will say a couple of things to the newbies:  If you are sensitive to salt and smoke, put less in (you can add more later, if necessary).  I was very happy to hear reviews that talked about defatting and re-adding the juices-that makes a HUGE difference. I wish I had read the review where the cook put gloves on when rubbing the meat before I did that. My hands smell of smoke, for sure.

I am making this for a memorial potluck and am putting a twist on it:  I am providing the pig with Cajun coleslaw and King's Hawaiian rolls for the sandwich.  Also am providing a good quality BBQ sauce for those who might want the southern variety and slaw on the side.

Another thought, but haven't done it yet is to provide a Kim Chee as a side or part of the plate lunch or sandwich.  Anybody??

I believe this recipe to be a great part of a family dinner as well as something to take to a potluck. Made the night before and ready for the next day's evening.  Let me know.

I made this for a recent family party and it turned out great. The meat lovers in the family were raving about it. The best part about the recipe is how easy it was to throw together. I will definetly make it again!

I have lived in Hawaii for over 2 years and this rivals the real deal. I have made it over and over to rave reviews from family and friends. I suggest getting your hands on "Ono Seasoning" if you can. It's a great local blend of salt, pepper and garlic.

There really isnt anything special to this recipe. I was actually quite disappointed on the flavor, the only thing that comes out at you is just the pork flavor. I guess once you have tried other pork recipes such as cuban roast pork, nothing else really compares. This was really dull. I will not be making this one again.

This is an awesome and simple recipe. I made it for the Las Vegas Allrecipes get together and they all loved it. My only change was to add 4 cloves of garlic cuz I love garlic with pork. Absolutely a winner and I will be making this at my next luau. Thanks for posting! UPDATE: I now line the crockpot with cabbage leaves, place the roast on top. Brush with liquid smoke. sprinkle with Hawaiian salt Add a handful of garlic cloves. Cover with more cabbage leaves and cook away. Much more authentic taste. LOVE IT!

This was so delicious and obviously couldn't be any easier. My husband said this was the best pulled pork he ever ate and I agree! My old recipe has 5 times the ingredients and prep and doesn't taste this good. I will be making it like this from now on, thanks for sharing!

The recipe as written yields an overcooked pork that is light on smoked flavor.  I have a new crockpot that cooks the meat in less time and I now add a bit more liquid smoke.

Made this as described - just added a sliced banana on top like some reviews mentioned because I had one handy.  This was EXCELLENT - probably the best pork I've had.  I used to fire up the smoker and make pulled pork a few times a year.  This was better, easier, and completely foolproof.   I'll be making this all the time now.

This is a great recipe.  Very easy, just follow the instructions.  I did add more smoke flavoring 1 1/2 Tablespoons instead of 1 Tablespoon and cut the salt to 1tablespoon (I did not have any Hawaiian Sea Salt).  The prok came out perfect, not too salty but a great pork flavor.  It was the hit of the pot luck.  I also brought along BBQ sauce for those that wanted to add it. As others suggested, I took all of the liquid, put it in the freezer while I was pulling the pork, skimmed the fat off and added the liquid back into the crock pot with the pulled pork.  This kept the pork juicy all night during the party.  The pork was ready in about 15 hours.  Tastes just like the pork that I have tasted in all of my visits to Hawaii.    You do not need to add any liquid to this.  Thank you for a great recipe.

This is such a good recipe!! I used pork carnitas the last time. It was cheaper and tasted exactly the same. We like to increase the smoke flavoring. I highly recommend this recipe!!

This was absolutely amazing!!!  I did as someone suggested and removed the meat towards the end of the cooking time and put the juices in the freezer so that I could easily skim the fat from the top, and then put the juices back in the crockpot with the meat to warm it back up.  A whole lot less grease that way.  My roast was very fatty, so I had to spend some time cutting off the fat.  I disagree with those who thought it was too salty.  I thought it was perfect.  Perhaps they used regular table salt.  I went to Whole Foods and bought Palm Island red gold sea salt (product of Hawaii), which comes in a 6 oz ziploc pouch for $3.99 (my store didn't carry the black).    I used a 7# pork roast and didn't add any extra salt or liquid smoke.  Put it in the crockpot before I went to bed and turned it when I woke up (it was falling to pieces after only 9 hours).  Left it for an additional 8 hours before removing the fat from the roast and putting the juices in the freezer.  I made this for a Hawaiian luau and not a bit was leftover (darn, I was hoping for some leftovers!)

Delicious and so very easy to put together!  I've made it countless times.  If you can get a hold of it, it's great made with pulehu seasoning from Hawaii.  I've served the pork a number of ways, including as a filling for tacos (inspired by a place in Kona that serves kalua pork tacos).  I usually put it in the slow cooker in the morning, and it's ready by dinner (by my estimate, about 8-10 hours on low, depending on when I remember to assemble it in the morning!)

I'm from Hawaii and was craving kalua pig and cabbage.  Found this dish and it it tastes like it came straight from Hawaii.   I used a 4 lb pork shoulder.  I couldn't find hawaiian sea salt at the grocery store and remembered that I had a hawaiian seasoning that my mom had brought up for me.  It had sea salt, pepper, ginger, garlic, and alea salt.  Rubbed that in as well as the liquid smoke flavoring.  Threw it in the crockpot and cooked it on low for about 17 hrs.  I did what another reviewer had said and put the sauce in the freezer and scraped the fat off the top.  I shredded the pork, then put the sauce over it.  Also cut up some cabbage and threw it in there too.  I added a few more drizzles of the liquid smoke flavoring and and about 1/2 cup of water to keep it most.  I put it on low for another hour and it came out sooo good!!  I will make this again when I have another craving for kalua pig and cabbage.  I serve it over rice.

This really doesn't need another review but I simply must put my two cents in.  This is fabulous!  I was skeptical about pork coming from a slow cooker tasting this good but it really does.  I followed the recipe and cooked it for 14 hours.  I will cut down on the salt a little next time.  My husband raved over this and I will definitely be doing this one again and it will feed a crowd!

I did this today.  Last night, I pierced a bone-in pork shoulder roast, rubbed it with liquid smoke, then crusted it with the pink Hawaiian sea salt (coarse grind).  I wrapped it in banana leaves (they were fresh and didn't need blanching), then tied the roast with twine.  This morning I put it in the crock-pot, and cooked it on low for 12 hours.  This was unbelievable!!  It had an earthy flavor & slight saltiness that I have never before experienced.  It was absolutely melt-in-your-mouth tender.  We made mini-sandwiches with King's Hawaiian bread rolls & a little World Harbors Maui Mountain Teriyaki sauce.  I also made some sushi rice, seasoned with rice wine vinegar & sugar.  I've never been to Hawaii, but I've been cooking pork shoulder (butts) for 30 years.  This was amazing!!!  Thanks so much for this recipe.  I was able to get the salt on Amazon--the local grocery carries banana leaves.

Very easy to prep this pig! I didn't have the Hawaiian salt so I subbed French gray salt.  Put this on around 9pm the night before and cooked it until 6 the next evening.  Excellent with or without bbq sauce.  I made Pao Doce bread to go with this.  Will make again!! Thanks for a great recipe!

This is fantastic. Although, I've noticed I can't cook it as long as it states. I cooked a 4lb for 11 hrs and it was semi dry. I cooked a 3 1/2 for about 7 hrs and it melted in your mouth. So I would go less on the time than what the recipe calls for.

So good, I keep salivating whenever I see a large pork roast at the store...  I want to make it again, and I still have some leftovers in the freezer from the last time!  The pork is incredibly flavorful, considering how simple it is.  No need for any sauce, IMO, although the kids added BBQ sauce.  I was a little scared about the strong liquid smoke smell when I first rubbed it on, but turns into a mellow smokiness after the pork is cooked.  BTW, if the roast doesn't fit in your crockpot, you can make it in the oven, with an oven bag or tightly covered/wrapped with foil.  Bake at 325-ish (275 to 350 works) for a long time, 4 to 8 or more hours (the longer time with a lower temp and vice versa), until the internal temp is 195 and the meat falls off the bone.  Shred and mix with juices.  Fabulous!

Awesome! Just awesome. When I removed the roast to shred, I poured the juice into a fat separator. Then combined the meat and juice and let sit for 30 minutes. Yum!

Wow, Wow, Wow!!!  I used a 6 pound pork shoulder blade roast.  I cut the salt down to 1 tablespoon.  Stuck it in the crockpot at 10:00 PM, turned it at 8:00 AM.  At 2:00 PM I took the meat out, drained the juices into a pan and stuck the juice in the frezzer for 30 minutes to defat.  I shredded the pork and put in back into the crockpot.  I added the defatted juice and kept it on low.  I served it 2 hours later for super bowl and it was great.  Very easy and the flavor was wonderful.  The Hawaiian salt and letting it cook for a long time is the secret.  It is done in 10 hours but let it keep going for the full 16.

WOW!  Even without the Hawaiian sea salt (could not find it, so I used Mediterranean) it was fabulous!  I've made it twice, and it's been a huge hit with even the most finicky eaters in the house.

This recipe didn't work for me. We were definitely bummed since it's received so many great reviews.  The meat was super dry and the fat that came out of the meat basically fried the meat that it touched.  I don't know if my slow cooker's low setting is too hot or if we should have pulled it out after 10-12 hours... I recommend keeping a close watch on this one to make sure it doesn't dry out.

I've made this recipe a few times and it is awesome.  I use a little less salt than called for and only cook it for 12 hours, but oh my goodness, everyone loves it.  It really is a taste of home.  You know, once you leave the islands, it's really hard to find good Hawaiian food anywhere, but this is like a little trip home every time I make it.  Next stop - Kalua Pig and Cabbage!

Delicious!  I made this with a 3 pound roast and halved the other ingredients.  I used the hawaiian red clay sea salt, which has a great smoky flavor.  After 10 hours in the crock pot, the roast was tender enough to shred.  After I shredded it, I placed two whole, unpeeled bananas on top of the pork (no stirring!) and let it cook for another couple of hours in the crock pot.  I then discarded the bananas.  I did this after reading that traditional kalua pig is made by wrapping the roast in banana leaves, which I couldn't find anywhere.  My husband and I loved the slightly sweet flavor the bananas gave the pork, and will definitely do it the same way next time.  We served this on hawaiian sweet bread.  We're hosting a luau in a few weeks, and will make it exactly the same way!  Thanks for the great recipe.

I have always “stewed” pork butt in the slow cooker with liquid (vinegar with a little sugar and Old Bay is good). It falls apart and I shred it with BBQ sauce for pork BBQ sandwiches. I was a little leery about “baking” it virtually dry. I was afraid it might burn in the crock-pot but it doesn’t. It came out great. This will be my new pork butt cooking method. As the fat and juices start flowing, the meat has plenty of liquid. The meat with the liquid smoke has a slow smoked on the grill aroma and flavor and a very appealing pork “roast” appearance. Don’t be fooled, this method does take that long and the roast stays intact, suitable for carving or shredding.  The grocery ads showing a sliced butt roast always eluded me until now. I used Mediterranean Sea salt (had some) and I chilled the juices to skim off the fat. The name is deceiving; I was expecting a coffee liqueur ingredient like some beef pot roasts use cola. Ten stars for easy and delicious!

I used a 5 pound pork shoulder roast with bone-in for this recipe. I also used "mesquite" liquid smoke. I had it cooking in the slow cooker overnight(family members had a hard time sleeping with the wonderful aroma in the night)after 10 hours, I shredded the meat added just a bit more salt then cooked it for another 8 hours. The shredded meat soaked up all the juices and tasted even better! I served the kalua pig two different ways-first, as is with dinner rolls then I stir fried a head of cabbage(cut into 2x2 pieces) and added the shredded kalua pig to the cooked cabbage and a little sugar! Served it with white rice and the famliy loved it! Wonderful!

YUK. I grew up on Kalua Pig and we did not like this at all. WAY TOO MUCH SALT. I will try again just because I love Kalua Pig and cannot get the real stuff where I live but I will put a lot less salt and will rate recipe again. SORRY

Amazing! I cooked it for 24 hours in my slow cooker and followed the recipe exactly. This was so good! We put the meat on sandwiches and I added a dash of apple cider vinegar on top. This recipe is so simple but the results are amazing.

I was raised in Hawaii and except for using a crock pot or slow cooker instead of an imu this is the real deal. I live on the central coast of CA where there are banana trees on just about every block so I ask a neighbor for a couple of the leaves. I wrap my pork roast in the banana leaves after rubbing the salt and liquid smoke over it. I however use Kosher salt instead of sea salt. Realistically everything that lives in the sea poops and pees in it, humans empty both treated and raw sewage into the oceans and birds fly over the drying ponds, no thank you. I always use a good sized pork butt because we love the left overs and they freeze well. The amount of salt I use depends on whether the roast is large or very large. Gotta have sticky rice to go with it topped with the shredded pork and juices. The first bite always brings back a flood of memories.

We have made this more than once and love it.  I typically use a pork shoulder.  Until just recently I was making this with regular sea salt, but I now have some Hawaiian salt purchased just to make this recipe.  I wonder if that will change the taste any?  Great for football games, birthday parties and New Year's Eve.  You won't be disappointed with this tenderness and flavor of this pork.

This recipe was super-simple.  I followed the recipe, mostly, but then added some sliced bananas to the top of the roast, which I discarded some time later in the cooking process.  I'm not sure if the bananas actually added any thing to the flavor.  This recipe was excellent on Hawaiian rolls with a dab of quality BBQ sauce.  I bet this would go well in a wrap with some shredded cabbage.

I too am from Hawai'i.  This is the recipe that we always use and it rocks.  I serve it with coconut rice and either stewed cabbage or collard greens.   
I will post those recipies, very simple ones soon.

It did smell pretty good while cooking, the bone came out very easily at the 12th hour of cooking but after the full cooking time (slow cooker on low setting, about 16 hours) there was barely any taste and it was EXTREMELY greasy.

Wow, this recipe is amazing!  I've never been to HI and I've certainly never had a traditional pig roast.  I can't compare it to anything but I don't need to.  It is fantastic!  I've seen this recipe over the years and I looked for Hawaiian sea salt a time or two.  I never came across it at the grocery store or Target.  However, I did see it Williams-Sonoma but @ that time I wasn't going to spend that much on salt.  After this recipe, I would now though!  I needed a no fuss recipe to be done by a specific time and I needed it to serve 10 people.  My daughter found Hawaiian sea salt @ sprouts and the pork butt roast was a little over 7lbs (smallest the store had).  I didn't add anymore salt or liquid smoke to compensate for the extra pound.  As I was adding the salt, I was thinking wow, that's a lot.  But man, when we sat down to it, it was perfect.  My guest loved it and got 2nds & 3rds, my family said its a "do again" meal & I ended up w/2 additional guest which it served everyone and I still had a little left over.  We served the Hawaiian buns and made coleslaw as another reviewer suggested.  Thanks so much for this recipe, I love it!

This is one of the best pulled pork recipes I have ever made! Just make sure that you chose a cut that has a bit of fat on it to keep in moist with lots of flavor.  The first time I made it, I chose a very lean cut and it wasn't as good as the second time when I made it with a fattier cut.

This is a very delicious basic pulled pork recipe for anyone out there who haven't tried kalua pig before. I have read reviews of people saying that it's too salty and even bland tasting, again, for those who have never tried kalua pig before, this recipe is just right with the actual Hawaiian Red Clay Salt or the Black Salt. If you decide to use normal table salt or sea salt, you will definitely find it very salty. To address the blandness, what I do is to add 1 1/2 tablespoon of hickory liquid smoke and that gives it the extra smokiness to the pig. An excellent suggestion was to add 2 bananas slit open and placed on top. If you decide to do that, make sure it's not over ripe or spotted, organic bananas would be great. The bananas will turn black and your kalua pig will have a sweet banana smell and very subtle "island" flavour that will keep your guests wondering what created that fruity sweet aroma. Now again if you find it bland, then I would suggest adding bbq sauce as you eat it or, simply make a BBQ pulled pork instead which would require a much more lengthy ingredient list :) One radical change that I have done twice out of the 5 times I have made this recipe, is that I use the pork sirloin roast from Costco instead of the shoulder/butt roast as stated in the recipe. At the end of the cooking, the texture is as tender and juicy as the shoulder roast but I noticed far less fatty oils in the juice. I also cook this for 10-12 hours on low. Simple cooking tastes the best!

This is a wonderful easy recipie! I followed it exactly, my roast was boneless shoulder. It made so much, I was worried it wouldn't be finished, it was gone in a day! We have a big pool party every August, and this will be  this years star attraction, thanks so much for sharing!

This was so easy to make and turned out great!  I cooked a 4.5 lb loaf for about 8 hours (3 hrs on HI, 5 on low).  I took out the meet and stored the juices in a separate container, then put it in the refrigerator overnight.  The next day, I removed the solidified fat from the juice, put the remaining juice and meat back into the crockpot to reheat for about an hour.   Served it with Kings Hawaiian Rolls and some macaroni salad.  Delicious!  Amazing how only 3 ingredients could make such an excellent meal!

I made this with Mediterranean Sea Salt (I didn't have any Hawaiian sea salt) and then slow cooked the pork roast for 10 hours. This was the best shredded pork both my husband and I have ever ate.  I put sweet honey BBQ sauce on the table before dinner, which is generally a must for my husband when he eats pork. The bottle went untouched for the entire dinner.  My 2 and 6 year olds loved it as well.   Will definitely make it again!

This was SO easy and really good.   I was so paranoid about all the comments of it being to salty that I'm sure I under-salted it.   I used a pork tenderloin that I just happened to have in the freezer, but almost no juice came out at the end since the fat content is so low.   I would probably go with pork butt next time.

Great tasting pulled pork.  I made the vinegar sauce (from allrecipe) to go with it.  I felt it needed a little something.  The pork with the sauce is amazing!  I have been looking for a basic pulled pork recipe and this fits the bill perfectly.  Both kids love it.  I will make this again.

It smelled right (apparently--my significant other is Hawaiian, and that's what he said), but we both found the meat to be kind of plain. It wasn't bad! It was just a bit boring. This is a good start, though, and to be honest, if one is really expecting pit-quality pork from a slow cooker, that's really a bit unrealistic and setting oneself up for disappointment.

This is a wonderful receipe.  I used red Hawaiian sea salt and wrapped the pork in banana leaves - cooked 6 lbs of pork butt/shoulder for 20 hours on low!  We all wanted to go back to Hawaii!!  Thank you so much for this easy to prepare receipe.

This was excellent!  I did have some red sea salt from Hawaii and used about 3 tsp on my meat (which was cut into large chunks).  I sprinkled a small amt of liquid smoke (maybe 1-2 tsp) and used lots of cracked black pepper.  No liquid, but it cooked down into it's own juices and the pieces closest to the edges actually got brown and crispy.  Great for week night dinners.  Love it!

Thought this had a decent flavor, but wouldn't serve it by itself.  First day I made tacos out of it and then later added barbecue sauce to make sandwiches.  Made a ton of food so very economical.

LOVED it.  Didn't change a thing from the recipe as far as additional seasoning goes.  Instead of using a 6lb roast, I bought a pre-packaged package of pork labeled as "Pork Butt/Picnic Ribs".  It was 5 thick rectangular cuts that added up to about 3.5 lbs.  I used a little less Liquid Smoke and Red Alaea Sea Salt as a result.  Cooked for 10 hours on low.  So moist and so tender.  Reminded me exactly of our Hawaiian honeymoon :)  Thanks for the recipe!

I couldn't find the particular salt that the recipe called for, so I just faked it and used Lawry's salt. Still turned out really yummy though, so I'm not complaining.  Nice and moist, and tasted great on home made crusty bread! ^_^

Since I cook for hard core meat eaters this was so easy, and so tasty it leaves me speechless. I used a 10 lb pork butt that I have cut special.  I had to bump up the smoke to "a generous coating" around 4 T.! Haha! I did add fresh ground black pepper and rubbed it in. After shredding the meat I did add more smoke, maybe 6 more shakes. This was Magnifico!! I am yet to have leftovers pass lunch the following day!!

This really is the best !  I made it the first time in 2008 & bought the Hawaiian Alaea Red Sea Salt from Suncatchers of Hilo (just add .com for their web site)  The price's & shipping  are reasonable.   Since then I have given this recipe & salt to my friend's & they have shared with their friend's,  no one has been disappointed !  Thank you KIKUCHAN for the recipe.

Best. Pork. EVER! I got a roast that had a pretty thick fat layer, but i always listen to what my grandma taught me, "fat is flavor", so i cut half of it off and put it on the bottom side that had no fat on it. skimmed off most of the fat that had cooked out before dumping in some chopped cabbage. The Hawiian salt is a pain to find and its kinda pricey over here, but its worth the money. By the time it was ready the bone pulled out completely clean, didnt even have to work at it to shred it since it fell apart the second i tried to pull it out of the cooker. ate with sticky rice that night, and the next day stuffed it into some pitas with a bit of chinese-style bbq sauce and some vinegar based slaw for my lunch. One of my coworkers took half of one and now theyre begging me to bring some in to work. Gonna be making this one a lot ;).

I wanted to try something different for Easter and this was so was simple and delicious!   I used a 6 lb shoulder roast. I pierced the roast, then rubbed it w/ liquid smoke and a little bit of sea salt. I didn't use more than a handful since it is so easy to oversalt. I put it in the crockpot on low (fat side up) at 9PM Saturday night. The next morning about 9AM I checked the roast and it was already very tender. I removed the roast, took the fat off of it and set it aside. I strained the drippings and put them in the freezer to bring all the fat to the top. At that point  the roast was fully cooked and falling apart in chunks. I could have served it that way, but instead I shredded the meat and put it back in the crockpot with the skimmed drippings. By the time we ate at 4PM (19 hours cooking) the meat was very tender. We served it on rolls w/ Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce along with baked beans, a salad and pineapple upside down cake. and it was a hit!   I would also like to try this with the meat chunked rather than shredded, but either way, this is definitely a keeper!

Wow! This is my new favorite recipe. I bought two roasts to total a little over 7 pounds and cooked it on low for 11 1/2 hours--I think my slow cooker cooks a little on the hot side. The pork just fell apart. Living in a small town in Utah, I couldn't find Hawaiian sea salt so I had to order some off the internet and it was so worth it! I took others' advice and served it over short grain rice. I also mixed in a couple handfuls of shredded cabbage during the last hour. I served it with Hawaiian Sweet Bread I and Tropical Salad with Pineapple Vinegarette from this website. I will definitely make this again!

I made this for our Hawaiian luau pot luck in February.  My coworkers were surprised when I signed up to bring a 'pig roast'!  This was a big hit with the group.  It was a big hit with me because it was easy and it traveled really well.

This was the most delicious pork I have ever eaten in my life. I used coarse sea salt and a little more liquid smoke than it called for, maybe a total of 1.5T of both the salt and liquid smoke. Cooked on high for 7ish hours, DELICIOUS. Will try overnight next time. Which will be soon!

THE BEST!!! My husband and I are from Hawaii so we know what Kalua Pig should taste like. This is the fist time i've made it myself. It was so good. I added a cup of water as well, to keep it extra moist!

This is wonderful, just made a couple tiny changes. I used a 3lb roast, rubbed on the liquid smoke, kosher salt, a crushed clove of garlic,a tiny sprinkle of dry ginger, then cut up a small garlic clove & put it into the meat. I cooked it on low for about 7 hrs and it barely needed any shredding because it just fell apart. I did remove the meat from the crock pot to separate the fat from the juices (used someone's tip of  putting liquids in the freezer to easily remove the fat) and added juice back to the meat. I warmed bakery sub rolls in the oven and served bbq sauce on the side which it didn't really need. I may try just a touch more liquid smoke next time, but it was a huge hit! My husband rated it 2nd place to a meal we recently had in Maui, and said it was ONLY because last time we were actually IN Hawaii. Thanks for this super easy, tasty recipe that will be a regular at our house!

This needed some doctoring! It was really bland with only rubbing the outside with salt and one tbsp of smoke. I used a 7 lb bone in pork shoulder, cooked on low for 17 hours it was perfectly cooked, but bland. I even added some chili pepper flakes and garlic powder to the rub before cooking based on other reviewers. i was afraid to over salt based on reviews, and i am super sensitive to salt. It needed more salt. I ended up finding another recipe because i wanted the cabbage with it. The other recipe is more authentic. it called for 1/4 c salt and smoke each, i added it to the shredded meat and it was perfect!! I took some of the juices from the pork and julienned cabbage into 1/8 strips sauteed it in juices with some broth for 5 minutes and served with rice! I wish I had mac salad now!

Made this for a party in Santa Fe and was a smashing success! Be sure to only use the hawaiian sea-salt it calls for and DON'T overdo it,as I did once. It's the most succlent pork you'll ever have!

WOW!!!!!!!  i saw comments on it being too smokey, but it wasn't too smokey for us.  i added another 1/2 TBS of smoke and next time i may try 2 1/2 TBS.  i looked up what alan wong and sam choy (famous hawaiian cooks with chinese names) recommended in their kalua recipes and they say 2 1/2 TBS of smoke and salt for 6 lbs pork.  that may be too much salt for my taste, but the extra smoke will be good.

Amazing!! I threw in two unpeeled bananas in place of the traditional ti and or banana leaves. It gave it that extra note of earthy flavor! Served with steamed cabbage, rice, macaroni and sweet bread. How could you possibly go wrong?!

Very moist & flavorful.  I used a pork shoulder & thought there was just too much fat in that cut.  I removed as much fat as I could after chilling the meat but it was not as lean as I would have liked.  I'll try something much leaner next time.

This is a great way to use an inexpensive cut of meat! Once the roast is done, I shred the meat & pick through to remove any fat. Then I divide meat into 4 or 5 portions - keep one aside for dinner that night & freeze the rest in quart-size zipper bags. I use this as a sub for the pork in "Moo Shu Pork" & "Chilie Pork Tacos" from this site. Also great just by itself or mixed with BBQ sauce & served on rolls. You get at least 5 fast & easy meals for busy weeknights from one recipe!

This is absolutely, phenomenally, fantastic!!!  I will never make a pork roast any other way!  For my crockpot the cook time was about 16 hours.  My stomach kept waking me up during the night because this smelled sooooo good.  Trust me when I say that you will NOT be able to stop eating this.  I agree with the other reviewers in wishing that I could give this recipe 10 stars.  A friend and I are hostessing a jewelry party at our salon in a couple of weeks and I am definitely making this and putting some rolls on the side for mini sandwiches.  Thank you so much for the AWESOME recipe!
I couldn't find the Hawaiian Sea Salt so I used Mediterranean but I don't think it changed the flavor much.

Made four of these for a luau.  First, you can find the correct pork (shoulder/butt--they are the same) at a Warehouse store (Costco) that doesn't have the saline solution, which helps to cut down on the saltiness.  I found the salt (used the black hawaiian salt) at Whole Foods, in a stiff plastic bag with a zip lock type of closure--our Trader Joe's didn't have it.  Definitely separate the fat from the juices before putting the juices back with the shredded pork.  This turned out great-moist and tasty!!  It has frozen very well and we've been eating a lot of it in different dishes since the party!  This will become a staple in our household--it's just too easy not to become one!!

Great! I used about a four lb. roast (cooked ~ 14 hrs) and after it was cooked and fat CAREFULLY and completely removed, I was left with about 2.5 lbs and almost 3 lbs with the defatted juices.  Since no additional liquid was added before cooking, I added a sliced onion to the bottom to prevent sticking and scorching with some garlic cloves. Also, make sure you have a proper working slowcooker as one brand on the market has a potential to overheat.  I just purchased a Hamilton Beech and it worked great.

OMG...If I could give this 10 stars I would.  I actually caught the pork on sale for $.89 per pound so I bought 2.  Thinking I'd use one for my daughters luau and the other I'd roast up in the oven.  Let me tell you, I'm glad I made this first.  It was so good and got rave reviews at the luau that I decided to cook the second one this way too! I couldn't find the Hawaiian red sea salt, so I just used regular sea salt and it was still wonderful. Thanks for such a delicious and simple recipe.

My husband and I honeymooned in Hawaii, and I have been trying to duplicate the incredible pulled pork we had at a luau there, and this is it!!  I admit that I had trouble with this recipe at first, but even the mistakes tasted so good I wanted to keep trying because I could see its potential.  Well this time I got it perfect, and I think I know what the problem was previously:  the slow cooker I used was too big, resulting in a more dry meat and the juices simmered away.  This time I used a 5-lb. pork butt and fit it into a regular crock pot after following the recipe directions exactly (obtained the Hawaiian sea salt online) and cooked it on low for 16 hours.  The result was melt-in-your-mouth, juicy pulled pork that is out of this world, and it even gave me 2 cups of juices to make gravy with.  I don't know if I could make this for guests, because I don't want to share!!  Thanks so much for posting this!

This was delicious. NOTE I did not use sea salt I used kosher by mistake. I served with potato rolls and the Spanish Slaw recipe (I added carrots) on this site. Delicious left over ideas... Pull apart very fine and serve on toast topped with fried egg (cooking egg over easy a must or dish will be too dry) Also Pull apart very fine mix in your favorite mecican seasonings and serve over rice and beans. YUMMMMMY

Very good and very easy recipe!  It tastes just like what we serve here on island.  :)  The only thing I disagree with on this recipe is the time they suggest to cook the meat.  5 hours on high in my crock pot is more than enough time... give it 6-7 hrs. and the meat already falls off the bone.  You can cook it at a lower temperature if you'd like, but the meat will be just as moist on high (and done a lot quicker too).

Made this for a Hawaiian native and got rave reviews, however I had poured out the leftover liquid and got spanked for it - that's the juice that goes on the rice that it's served over.

This was DELICIOUS!! AT first I was thinking, what's the big deal, just another pork roast....WRONG. The meat was just melting in our mouths. Anyone who claims that this recipe is bland was obviously not following the recipe. Found the "hawaiian sea salt" at Trader Joe's. Thanks for sharing!!

This was fabulous.  I only had a 2 pound roast so it looked a little small in my crockpot.  I turned it a couple of times to keep it from drying out, but cooked it the entire 20 hours. I took someone else's suggestion and drained the juices, tossed them in the freezer for a few minutes and skimmed the fat off.  After I put the juice back on, I shreeded the meat and let it cook another half hour.  The roast actually browned in the crockpot, so the meat had nice crispy bits mixed it with super tender pork.  VERY YUMMY.  I served this with Black Beans & Quinoa and sliced avocado with fresh lime juice squirted over everything.  Delish!

Following the directions to the letter, the meat was very tender; unfortunately, it didn't have much taste.  Even using Hawaiian salt, it was far too salty for our tastes.  My husband asked me if I had forgotten an ingredient! I did make a gravy as suggested by another reviewer, and that saved the meal for us. I mixed in some Sweet Baby Ray's barbeque sauce to make sandwiches the next day and everyone enjoyed it more served that way.  ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: After mixing this with barbeque sauce, I froze the leftovers in individual portions for lunches.  I have to say  that, although still a bit salty for my tastes, it was very good.  I would probably make this again with sauce to be used for lunches.**** with barbeque sauce.

This was spectacular. I ordered the Hawaiian sea salt on-line. I am so glad I waited for it. This was so good! I used a  7 lb butt. I cooked it for about 17 hours and it was totally falling apart so, until dinner I put my crock pot on warm and added a little more (1 TBS) liquid smoke,some pineapple juice and pineapple chunks. This was such a good recipe. My daughter requested it for Christmas dinner!!!

This was absolutely the best pulled pork I have ever had. Ever. I knew I wouldn't be able to get Hawaiian salt where I live, so I mixed what the recipe called for, using 1/2 kosher salt and 1/2 sugar. I don't know if it would work for you, but mine was very lightly seasoned (I don't normally use salt when I cook, so I'm used to a low-salt flavor).

I used about 1 1/2 T liquid smoke with an 8 pound butt shoulder cut. It barely fit in my Crock Pot (I think I have a 3.5 qt). I put it on low for 7 hours, then turned it and poured out about half the gravy, and left it in for another six.

I could not believe how juicy and flavorful the meat was! I fed 30 very hungry men a great BBQ lunch with no leftovers. I served it pulled on buns and let them choose their own sauces to put on the meat. With homemade baked beans and homemade coleslaw, this fed a huge number of people for relatively little cost.

Thank you so much! This is a keeper for sure.

Yayyyy!  I just went to a hog roast - the meat was tough and I thought tasteless.  It left me craving good luau style pork, which is what I thought the hog roast would somewhat be like.  I've been to Hawaii many times and the Luau meat is the only pork that I truly enjoy-I'm quite picky about my pork.  After reading the reviews, I added 2tbsp of liquid smoke and a little less than 1 tbsp salt.  After waking up this morning and trying to flip it, it seems to have already shredded itself in the process of flippipng!  It's so yummy that I accidentally ate it for breakfast (along with some nutella puppy chow-oops).  It's not exactly the luau meat, but close enough - I'm impressed, and it was so easy.  I will be making this for parties and tailgating.  Thank you!

My entire family loved this. I even put the meat on frozen solid and it cooked just right. I didn't add the liquid smoke, but did put extra salt. This was just too easy. It tasted like it took forever to prepare. We will definately use this recipe again, and again, and again, .....

I used this with boneless chicken breasts and served this on Christmas. It was the easiest, and least messiest meal that I have made. After it was done cooking, I split the chicken into regular and then mixed the other half with barbeque. If you need an easy main dish with little fuss, this is it!

Very good. For everyone that is confused on the proper cut, Pork butt, Boston butt, are the same thing and what you want for this dish, you DO NOT want a pork shoulder, shoulder picnic, they to are both the same just called different depending on where you live. Been a butcher for 25 years.  Trust me..... the shoulder needs a slow oven roast. You will end up with that delicious crackle skin, however it will not shred like a pork butt.

Follow the directions and ingredients exactly as called for and you won't be disappointed. Pair it with a recipe you will find on all recipes "sweet restaurant Cole slaw" and it's amazing!  I put the pulled pork on a Hawaiian sweet bun and topped with the slaw, perfect!

Oh my gosh this was delicious, my mouth is watering as I type this. I followed the recipe all the way trough. added the shredded cabbage on top for the last hour on low.(made that extra touch)served it over rice. I used a 2-1/2 pound roast and it made plenty for leftovers too.cooked it on high for 6 hours turning once in awhile. the last hour on low when I added the cabbage. next time I will add more cabbage it was that good!! Thank you I will be making this a lot more times.

I went with ES' version! 2.5 lb boneless pork shoulder (Safeway butchers will cut open a package & make a smaller cut if you ask kindly ;-). ) (last time I used 'loin'-same cheapest price per pound) no fork so used paring knife to 'stab' the meat thoroughly  then rubbed in 1  tablespoon smoked sea salt followed by 1/2 tablespoon liquid smoke-mesquite.  Then cooked 3 hours on high turning 1 time halfway through.  Turned to low as sound of cooking fat changed. Checked meat temp & was at 170 already! Cooked an hour on low to see what would happen. Put about 4 cups of shredded cabbage in the juice while I Shredded the pork. Then returned it to the cooker for an hour on low to soak up the juices. -Lots of cabbage since I & my friends are trying to cut back on meats without cutting back on great food! Served with short grain rice. Couldn't find sushi rice so went with basmati. Did not find it too salty, but will put out extra smoked salt for those guests who prefer that. ROCK ON!

This was excellent. I bought raw tortillas and cooked them. Served pork rolled in tortillas, with a great guacamole (recipe on allrecipes), sour cream, cheese and lettuce, and homemade salsa, and rice. Big hit.

I also add a large whole banana unpeeled (or banana leaves) to give it that Hawaiian flavor. Remove the whole banana and disgard once the roast is done. Believe me, it adds flavor!

This taste just like the kalua pork from the neighborhood Hawaiian restuarant. I made it exactly as written the first time and it came out great. But then after doing some research on kalua pork recipes, I found that the pork was wrapped in Ti leaves for more flavor. Since Ti leaves are hard to get, I wrapped it in banana leaves (can be found in most Asian markets) and that gave it a subtle smokey & sweet flavor.

I made this over the weekend, using some tweaks from other reviewers. I put the juices in the freezer for an hour while I was shredding the pork. Then it was really easy to spoon off the nearly solid fat. I put the pork and de-fatted liquid back in the crock pot with extra salt (I had gone easy on the salt at first) and more liquid smoke and cooked it an extra hour and a half. The meat absorbed the liquid and was so succulent that even my picky-eater daughter raved about it. Serving it over plain sticky rice helps balance the saltiness of the dish. My husband liked it so much that he took leftovers to work for his lunch. I'll definitely be making this again.

I checked on this at 12 hours, not the recommended 16-20.  Almost completely dried out, I got about 1 small servings worth in the very middle of my 6 pounds of meat.  Not everyone's crock pot's low setting is the same, so if yours tends to be hotter, make sure you check on the pork after about 6-8 hours.

That center meat basically just tasted like regular slow cooked pig, nothing special.  The expensive salt I purchased didn't change anything, couldn't really taste the liquid smoke.  I gave in and used BBQ sauce.

My suspicion is that the individuals who gave this rave reviews just haven't really done that much cooking or probably haven't made pork in the slow cooker before.

Very good although a bit salty for me until I added bbq sauce on the pork.  I put several individual packages in the freezer for lunch and hectic evenings.

I'm from Hawaii and used to buy this all the time growing up! I finally decided to try making it, and have made/shared it at least a dozen or so times over the years! Below are the changes I make for my version:

I add 1 head of chopped cabbage per 6lbs of pork, chopped into thin 1"-3" strips minus ribs & tough inner parts. After it's all done, I separate the meat from the juice, sautee the cabbage in a few spoonfuls of juice, exchange the cabbage and meat in the pot, and slowly mix in the sautéed chopped cabbage and juice until the consistency and taste is just right.

Perfect with fresh steamed rice! I've gone to a few BBQ's where I brought 10lbs, and discovered it all gone in 20-30 minutes! Always a hit!

5 Stars for great taste and EASY!  I've made this 4 times and loved it every time - as have my family & guests.  Change:  I wrap the seasoned roast with bannana leaves (from Asian Market frozen section) - which adds to the sweetness.  And I have always used Himalayan Salt - as I have yet to find Hawaiian.  Serve with Sticky Rice, Black Beans, Hawaiian Rolls, Tortillas  and an assortment of sauces:  BBQ, Sweet Chili, Teriyaki, etc.  Everyone can find some way to eat this and be happy!  Great for entertaining!

Finally!  A way I can make the real "luau" kalua pork!  This was simple, delicious, and is the real deal!  I live part-time in Hawaii, and I get so hungry for the kalua pork I smell cooking at the Paradise Cove Luau next door every single day.....Thank you for this great recipe I can take back to the Mainland with me!  Don't substitute the Hawaiian salt, though -- it's what makes this dish so awesome.   I served it with the Sweet Restaurant Slaw from this site, it was fantastic!

I've made this ready MANY times and it always gets rave reviews.  I do cook it the full 20 hours.  It is so tender that a knife is never needed.  We pour off the drippings into a bowl, refrigerate for an hour or so, then remove the layer of fat before pouring the juices back into the shredded pork.  We then add lots of barbecue sauce.  Yum!!

I've tried several slow cooker BBQ pork butt recipes, but this was by FAR my family's favorite! And the easiest.  Use the Hawaiian salt - it really makes a difference.  I froze the leftover pork from my Mom's Luau themed birthday party and thawed/served it yesterday with BBQ sauce - YUM!  So simple to make and so good.

This pork was so bland when I took it out of the slow cooker last night. I just tasted it this morning and the flavor seems to have developed. Tastes much better the second day, more smoky.

I don't know why I've had this recipe in my box for at least five years and have never made it until now! Follow the directions and you'll end up with moist, flavorful and juicy shredded pork. We're having it tonight with little Hawaiian rolls, coleslaw and baked beans.... the sky's the limit for the leftovers! I wonder about the liquid smoke...if different brands could make a difference? I had no complaints of an overwhelming smoke smell. Just perfect!

I moved from Hawaii to Oregon 11 years ago, and I have craved Kalua Pork for years.  This recipe allows me to cook pork that tastes JUST LIKE the smoky pit-cooked, ti leaf-wrapped pork from home!  Everyone who has tasted it has begged for the recipe and been very happy with their own results, as well.  This is my "go to" recipe when I need comfort food.  Excellent recipe!

Ridiculously simple with great results.  After shredding I just added some store-bought bbq sauce.  Served them on Hawaiin rolls like little sliders.  Great for feeding a large crowd when company comes.

DELICIOUS!  I rubbed the pork butt with salt and then with the liquid smoke.  Then I vacuum sealed it with some more liquid smoke and marinated it for a few hours before putting it in the slow cooker and letting it do its thing for about 24 hours.  I will definitely make this again.  :o)

I have never tried a pork roast before, it always seemed intimidating. But I had a crowd to feed for my husbands 50th birthday party and this recipe looked perfect. Boy am I glad I tried it! I couldn't fine Hawaiian sea salt in a grocery store around here..too rural I guess...but I substituted regular sea salt, and since it was fabulous, that was fine. I don't have any complaints or changes I'd recommend. This recipe is PERFECT.

I used Red Hawaiian Sea Salt on a 2 lb roast.  It never dawned on me that a smaller roast needed decreased cooking time - duh!  I had it on low for 9 hours and it was a little overcooked. (or could be that my slow cooker runs hot?) Juices?  None to speak of so I drizzled a couple of tbs of pineapple juice over it.  Nevertheless, this was very very VERY good and I will be making this again.

Really good!  Did 2 lb pork shoulder roast with 1/2 t each salt, pepper and allspice as some suggested and 1/2 T liquid smoke flavoring.  My husband is looking forward to pulled pork sandwiches on Hawaiian rolls tomorrow!

This pork is so good!!! I followed the directions exactly, using black lava salt. As I pulled it out of the slow cooker to shred it, everyone in the kitchen had their hands out, wanting a taste and then wanting more. It wasn't salty at all and was very moist. Thanks for sharing!!!

Excellent results. I would like to have known if Kikuchan use the black lava sea salt or the red. Since I didn't know I chose the black for a smoky flavor rather than the Red for a earthy flavor. Henry’s carried both.  Having read the reviews the minor adjustments I made were… I used about 1/2 the amount of salt for the rub. I turned the crock pot on high for 3 hours and then on low for 7 hrs longer. I was going to do the 1 turn and cook more but the pork was already done. The cabbage really pulls it together and makes it very moist. Thank you so much 
Tip: wear gloves if doing the black lava rub

Easy and my husband loved it.  He's Mexican and said it was like less salty less greasy carnitas.  I agree and would make this again over carnitas, even in our Mexican dishes.

In it’s own way, this was definitely a hit.  I’m not sure the exact taste I was supposed to be going for, but with only the sea salt and liquid smoke it was a little bland, but we definitely liked the taste of the natural pork flavor.  The house smelled good the whole 11 hours.  We added a packet of Goya Sazon seasoning and finished it off with ½ bottle of open pit BBQ sauce.  That made it perfect.  We ate the shredded up pork on sesame seed hamburger rolls with fresh green bell pepper and raw onions.  This is definitely a keeper.

So easy!  I had a 7.4lb roast, trying to keep it from being too salty, I used 1 tbsp Sea Salt when initially preparing the meat.  I then tasted it, after it was fully cooked and added more salt, so probably used 1.5 tbsp total.  I used about 1 tbsp + 3 teaspoon extra liquid smoke.  I added as needed after tasting it to my liking.
I added cabbage the last two hours of cooking, about 2 small heads of cabbage. 
As other reviewers advised, I also poured the broth into a container, chilled it to separate the extra oils/fats.
The pork was so tender and delicious.  Received RAVE reviews from all of my lunch guests.  Will definitely make this again.

Love it! Be sure to use a fatty cut of meat. If it's lean, it just does not taste the same and is then nothing special. With a fatty cut, it's extraordinary! Here in Oregon, a common cut you find is called a pork picnic roast. It works perfectly. It has skin, bones, and plenty of fat. Also, add a generous cup of pineapple juice. The flavor it gives is awesome and there will be enough liquid that you don't even need to turn the meat during cooking at all. I dissolve the salt and liquid smoke in the pineapple juice then add the meat with the thickest fat layers placed against the sides of the crock pot. Turn it on low and come back 16 hours later for a spectacular meal. Tastes great served with tangy coleslaw and baked mashed yams!

The meat over all was good but a little bland for our tasting. The best meal we had with this dish was when I put the leftover meat on a bun, and topped it with homemade teriyaki sauce and grilled pineapple.

Phenomenal!!! My husband & I absolutely loved this recipe!! I used 3.69lb pork shoulder but kept the rest of the measurements the same as the recipes calls for, although I did add a couple cups of water & a little roasted garlic too. I cooked it for 10 hours & after about the 1st hour my house was filled with a wonderful mouth watering aroma! I made Hawaiian macaroni salad, sticky rice & picked up some Hawaiian sweet rolls to go along with the pork & the entire meal was incredibly delicious! We had just returned from our Hawaiian honeymoon a couple weeks prior to making this recipe & the luau food was still fresh on our palates; this recipe more than compares to the pork at our luau! I’d say that in a way, it is even better; being able to freeze the juice & skim off the fat before warming it back it up makes it less oily & better in my opinion! I will certainly make this recipe again & again!! By the way, I found the Hawaiian salt at “New Seasons”…  It absolutely was NOT overly salty but that may have something to do with the water I added, I guess it may have deluded the saltiness.?

I'm from Oahu born and raised.  This was so good and so simple!  If you shred the kalua pig and put it in chicken broth with a ton of cabbage, let it cook and you'll get double what you thought when you originally cooked in the crock pot.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow this recipe is awesome!  I have made it twice following the original recipe with great success.  The Hawaiian sea salt can be a challenge to buy locally if you live in the sticks like I do.  But I have been able to find it when traveling to major urban areas.  One could also find it on the internet if not available locally. Since there are only two of us at home now, I freeze portions in pint containers for later use.  Followed someone's suggestion of reheating the pork with bottled BBQ sauce and serving on buns for great BBQ Pork Sandwiches.  My husband thinks the BBQ Pork made from this is better than what is served at local BBQ venders and we live in one of the  self proclaimed BBQ capitols.

This was allright. I guess I'm not a fan of pig roasts.... I've been eyeing this recipe for some time now, and if for nothing other than that, I'm glad I gave it a try. The long, slow cooking method, minimal list of ingredients (and use of Hawaiian sea salt- something I've never used before and a good excuse to visit my favorite specialty spice shop!) and easy preparation make this a 5 star recipe. The flavor is more like 3 stars tho, IMHO.  Because I was only cooking for my fiance and myself, I purchased a 4 lb. pork butt (i.e. rump) roast. When scaling this recipe to 8 servings worth (6 lb. = 12 servings, so I deduced that 4 lb. would be 8), I was surprised to see that the weight of the pork stayed constant, but the salt / liquid smoke amounts changed (???). Since I already purchased the 4 lb. roast, I used it and scaled the other ingredients accordingly and my roast was perfectly seasoned / not salty at all. I'm not sure I'll make this again, but if smoked pig is YOUR thing, you MUST give this a try (this is a pretty authentic recipe). I'm still a sucker for KMB233's BBQ Pork for sandwiches. :-) Thanks anyways, KIKUCHAN!

First of all OMG WOW. This was so simple. My family just adored it. The only thing I did different was not adding the extra salt after cooking. It didn't need it.  My roast was nearly 1 pound larger than the recipe called for and my roast was done in an hour less time. Just check it after 4 hours and see what the internal temp is. Mine registered 198 and was still juicy, tender and easy to pull apart. Another hour would have scorched it.

My family and i love this recipe so much that i never buy kalua pig from the stores anymore- and it's so easy to make- and yes, we all live on the Big Island of Hawaii...I just sent the recipe to my best friend, who has moved to the Mainland,  for her birthday! Since i can't be with her- i've sent her some Aloha from the Islands!  (8

Seriously, this stuff was incredibly butt-ilicious!! It needed at least an hour more to cook but I couldn't resist the smell, so we started to eat. Next time, I will be good and be patient and add cabbage as some reviewers suggested. I was so glad I didn't have to order the hawaiian sea salt online; got it at Whole Foods called red gold sea salt by Palm Island.***Notes: Also have used 3.28lb pork picnic (longer meat strands);high 8.5-9hrs; 1 T. hawaiin sea salt, same amount liquid smoke

Great recipe. I adjusted it for 2 people using kosher salt. After several tries, the best method I found is... 1) use 2-3 lbs pork shoulder 2) poke holes all over the meat 3) generously sprinkle the entire meat with kosher salt (anything less will make the meat bland) 4) generously cover the meat with hickory liquid smoke 5) place meat in a crock pot set on high for 1 hour 6) rotate the meat and set to low for 5-6 hours (turn once during the low setting )

After 8 hours in the crockpot it was tender and juicy, but after 16 it had dried out. Next time I will cook it for less time, maybe 12 hours.

We made this for Easter dinner and served it with steamed tortillas, homemade salsa, guacamole and green salad with berries, pears and candied pecans. It was the best we ever made.  Thought it might be too smokey and too salty but it was tender and perfect.  We followed the recipe exactly as written. We are going to make it again for a luau we are planning for this summer. Thank you for a great recipe!

This is the best recipe. I usually only cook for 10 hours on low. Like being at a Luau. Try with rice and macaroni salad like a plate lunch.

This is the same recipe I have used for Kalua Pig, except I cook mine in a roaster oven on low for a long time (depends on the size of the pork butt I buy-by the way pork butt, pork shoulder and Boston butt are synonymous terms for the same cut of meat.)  It makes it easy to shred and hold for a buffet or potluck.  You MUST used Hawaiian sea salt.  Don't try to substitute regular sea salt or kosher salt.  It will be too salty.  There's a sweetness to Hawaiian sea salt that the others don't have.  This is fabulous with sticky rice and shoyu (soy sauce-I think Aloha Shoyu is the best) and pickled cucumbers.  YUM!

This is the same recipe I use and it's fantastic but I wrap the pork in banana leaves & tie with cooking twine. I only cook it for 8-10 hours. Then I shred cabbage and saute it on the stovetop in the juices from the slow cooker.  Finally, throw the shredded pork in with the cabbage and serve over rice.  My favorite local Hawaiian dish!!

This recipe is AMAZING! I lived in Hawaii for a short time and Kalua Pig was my favorite.  Although I used normal sea salt, this recipe still tasted like the real deal! If you want a real treat, make the Citrus Salsa from the Citrus Swordfish With Citrus Salsa recipe.   Make nachos with beans, Kalua Pig, guacamole, sour cream, and the Citrus Salsa.  It is to die for!

I've been making this recipe for the past year or so and I can't believe I haven't reviewed it yet. It's quite possibly the EASIEST and TASTIEST recipes I've ever tried!  I first made it following the recipe exactly and it tasted great but I decided to kick it up a bit. I modified it by adding some fresh garlic/garlic powder, onion powder and fresh black pepper. I cook it on high for about 4-6 hours then lowering it to low for a few more hours depending on when we end up eating dinner. I also add a whole bunch of cabbage in the last hour or so of cooking because I adore pork and cabbage. Serve it with some jasmine rice and sriracha and it's one of my favorite meals ever.   Being that it's only my fiancé and myself, we end up having a TON of leftovers which we feast on for a couple of days. Not that either one of us are complaining!  *sigh* this dish always makes me wish I were back on vacation in Hawaii!

This was awesome, just like Hawaii.  I ordered my salt from Amazon.  Leftovers- we threw the meat on chips, added cheese, mango/pineapple salsa and sour cream, tasted like the nachos we had in Kauai.

Wanted to add an option for poeple not wanting to use a liquid smoke product.  Cuts of pork, butt, shoulder or the leaner prok loin are excellent if brined (30 mins in one cup of salt, 1.2 c of sugar to a gallon of water) then smoked in an home smoker. After being fully smoked then can be put in slow cooker with a small amount of water until ready for shredding.  I  smoke a batch of meat cuts, freeze then slow cook just the amount needed. Natural pork loin comes out moist and much lean this way too.  Can add extra spices and peppers to taste.  I lived in Hawaii and this recipe in part of my yearly summer luau on the main land.

This is very easy to make and tastes great. A very good way to feed lots of people inexpensively. I made this dish for superbowl. I served the pork on potato buns. Word of advice: put the slow cooker outside for the night! The smell completely overwhelms your house- I had a hard time sleeping!

awesome!  This is so easy and so good!  We have made a change though, and not because we thought it would be better, but because we can't drink the tea.  Let me explain.  Lapsang souchoung tea is incredibly smokey.  My husband and I can't drink it because of that.  But we tie a little in a coffee filter and put it in the pot instead of liquid smoke, it's amazing.  Almost better than with liquid smoke.

Absolutely delicious!  I've never had real Kalua Pig before, but if this is even a close representation of what it tastes like, I can't wait to try it!  I served this with "Pineapple Ham and Rice" from this site, omitting the ham from that recipe.  They were perfect together!  I also served it with green peas in browned butter sauce.  Thank you for a GREAT recipe that I will make again many times!

Great recipe> I used to use the oven. But a slow cooker makes more sense. I use a 9 pound pork shoulder and I increase the liquid smoke to my taste. Great hassle free recipe.

This is ono (delicious) the best way to cooking our Hawaiian pork.  All of my State side friends here on our Japan base begs me to cooking Kalua pig in the slow cooker. Everytime I cook mines I tend to add more liquid smoke, a pinch of black pepper and Hawaii soy sauce called Aloha Shoyu. Not too much. After my pork is cooked about 10 hours. I toss in chopped cabbage and diced up onions. Adding in a little more liquid smoke, Aloha soy sauce and black pepper.  The aroma is the best! Aloha!

I'm reviewing this again since I have made it almost 10 times now.  You deserve 10 stars for this recipe. Thank you again and again and again!  I never cook pork roast any other way except this way.  Super terrific awesome VERY flavorful. I sometimes just sprinkle the salt on it so it doesn't get too salty.  I use smoke flavored sea salt. (All I can find here in Sweden) Shred at the end and let the juices absorb into the meat. It has never failed to come out moist and juicy.  I can't rave enough LOL!

I lived in Hawaii for three years and have been searching for a recipe like this. Everyone agreed that it tasted JUST like the Kalua Pig we had there. 
I could not find the Hawaiian salt, but I used regular sea salt and it tasted just fine. I didn't even have to shred the meat. It fell off the bone and was so tender.

Very, very good! In my crockpot on low it only too about 10hours for a 6.5lb shoulder with bone-in. Also, I substituted regular coarse kosher salt for the sea salt. The family loved it and we'll be making this again soon!

My family loves this recipe so much I bought two pounds of alaea red sea salt from the Hawaii Salt company to make sure I always have it on hand. I like to add a few whole bananas with the peel cracked to give it a subtle banana flavor. I think this makes up for not wrapping the pork in banana leaves as is traditionally done. It's hard to find banana leaves in Seattle.

My crock pot cooks super hot even on low, so this was falling apart and very tender at 10 hours. This smells so good while cooking & tastes pretty darn  good, too!  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This recipe was fabulous!  For added flavor, I wrapped the roast in banana leaf prior to placing in the crockpot.  I did use the red salt from hawaii.  They sell it in bulk at my Central Market.  The roast fell apart!

This recipe is absolutely fabulous!  I have made this multiple times for family and friends and it always gets rave reviews.  I do usually cook on low for at least 20 hours; it makes it really moist and really easy to shred.  Also, when I shred the pork, I skim the fat out of the juice in the slow cooker add about a 1/4 cup of brown sugar to the juice, and then add the shredded pork back in and keep it on low so it soaks up the remaining juices and keeps it warm.  I especially like it with the Hawaiian sea salt versus regular sea salt.    My husband and I just went to Maui for our honeymoon and ate at a lot of true authentic Hawaiian restaurants and this recipe still topped them!  We did buy some black sea salt w/ charcoal while we were there that I can't wait to try out this weekend on guests!  I typically make my home made rolls with it and make sandwiches with the pork.

I made this today and it is excellent! And so easy! It tastes nearly exactly like the Kalua pig we ate at a Luau in Maui.  This recipe takes me right back to Hawaii...

I have a small Crock Pot so I used a 3lb pork shoulder.  I used Ono Hawaiian brand seasoning (sea salt, black pepper, ginger, garlic, alae salt) To order:  http://www.hawaiiankinestuff.com/onohase.html   and the full amount hickory liquid smoke even though I used half the amount of pork.  I cooked it for 3 hours on high then 7 hrs on low.  The pork was falling off the bone tender. We ate the pork over rice like in Maui.  

I will definitely be making this often.

Made this for our daughter's graduation/luau party and it was a BIG HIT!! Had buns available for sandwiches and bbq sauce (just in case) and the sauce was barely touched...no mustard, mayo...no condiments at all. Also had fried chicken (not sure if guests would like the pork)...don't waste your time. Had way too much chicken left over, everyone went for the "Hawaiian Pig". I, too, added alittle water to the cooker to make extra juice to add to pork after shredded, it was deeeeelicious!!! (had 3-6lb. butts in electric roaster, cooked for 18 hours even tho little pop-up timers popped after only about 4 hours, but still continued to cook...was sooo tender) Had many requests for the recipe...who knew something so simple to make would taste soooooooo great!!.... Thank You!!

I had a luau and was going to have someone do a Hog Roast until I found out how expensive it was.  So, I tried this recipe in advance and could not believe how perfect it turned out every time. At the party everyone was raving about my pork (I had both plain and with BBQ sauce) There were several people who had been to other parties that day, also serving pork, and none compared to this recipe!  I followed the directions exactly and even ordered my pink hawaiian salt online for about $7 a lb.  That was enough for about 15 roasts.  I ended up serving 6 roasts (between 6 and 7 lbs each) for 150 people.  To make it easier on myself, I made several roasts in advance and froze them.  This worked fine and did not take away any of the tenderness in the meat. Thank you, Kikuchan, for submitting this, I will be using it all the time!

As were many others, I was worried about the lack of typical slow cooker ingredients in this recipe.  But, after 12 hours of cooking, followed by pulling apart the meat that was falling off the bone, and reheating in the juices, I declare it a hit!  Do understand that this is not a "saucy" recipe as you may expect from something BBQ related, but it is sure some finger-licking pig!

This is the best recipe ever!  In fact it's my only reason for owning a crock pot.  I use coarse kosher salt in place of the Hawaiian salt.  This can also be cooked on HIGH for about 6 hours.  I also do as some of the other reviewers and put the juices in the fridge until the fat solidifies so I can discard it (or give it to the dog).  And maybe it's just me, but you must eat Kalua Pig with sticky white calrose rice, otherwise it would not be like Hawaii!

Delicious shredded pork!  I did not have Hawaiin salt, so I used Coarse Natural Sea Salt.  My entire family loved it!  It makes enought to feed 10+ people, so my family of 5 ate on it for days.  It is delicious by itself, with sauce on buns, over a salad with ranch dressing and on crackers! I was skeptical about putting roast in slow cooker with no liquid, but it produces tremendous amount of broth itself!!!

We had this yesterday and it was fantastic.  I used it again today and made it into another recipe from this site (BBQ Pork for Sandwiches) so that it did not seem like we were having left overs and I truly think that the success of the other recipe was in part because of this one.  Both worth repeating!

This recipe makes some amazing pork! Used a 5.70 lb pork butt, bone-in, and ended up cooking it on low for about 23 hours. I shredded it at right about 20 hours. The pork is moist and oh, so good. I didn't measure the liquid smoke or the salt (I used gray french sea salt), just used what I thought was enough, and I didn't think the meat was too salty at all. I put a bit in a bowl and added some Famous Dave's Sweet & Tangy BBQ sauce and thought I'd died and gone to pork heaven. I will be making this recipe again and again. It was so easy and so good! Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was very easy and tasted just like the local Hawaiian BBQ restaurant. I did sear the pork in a large pan with some butter before I put it in the slow cooker.

I've made this several times with great success. One day I ran out of Hawaiian Alaea salt so I decided to try Montreal Steak Seasoning instead. It turned out great! Just add a little bit more liquid smoke. I leave the drippings with the shredded meat to keep it moist. Now, I have 2 options for this recipe.

While flavorful it is too salty for my taste. Used regular large crystal sea salt. Will cut it back next time to 1 TBSP or 2 tsp salt. Made gravy from the drippings. Side dishes were apple mashed potatoes from this site and carrots dressed with dill and brown sugar also from this site. Sorry, only 3 stars because of the salt. REVISION: Getting at the left-overs, found that it was NOT too salty. All the salt had drained into the drippings for gravy. Upgrading this to 4 stars and making pulled-pork sandwitches.

Very good and super easy.  Was a little bland, but I love spicy food.  Added some BBQ sauce and it made an awesome sandwich.  Also didn't have hawaiian salt so I used gray salt.  Purchased some Hawaiian salt at Trader Joe's to use when I make this again next time.

Oh my gosh. We throw a Hawaiian themed party every year and this year I told people I was going to find a way to have a pig roast in my NYC apartment. This recipe definately accomplished that. The pork was INCREDIBLE. To serve these I cut mini pita breads in half and passed them out as little sandwiches. Guests were actually fighting over who got the last ones, and my boyfriend the next day demanded I make another pot just for him. I followed the recipe exactly as written, only cooking for a couple more hours after shredding. The Hawaiian Sea Salt is bit expensive, but well worth it. It has a wonderful unique flavor, and you can use it in plenty of other dishes. It really enhanced the salas I made. My friends who had been to Hawaii were so impressed, they said the pork was exactly like what they had at Luau's. Thank you Kay. I could kiss you.

Very tasty.  I used a 3.5lb sirloin roast (don't know very much about cuts of pork) and it was very tender.  Used 3/4 tbs sea salt and 2+ tbs liquid smoke.  Cooked on HI for 3 hours and then on low for about 6. I shredded it right in the pot and it soaked up most of the juices. My boyfriend was very impressed.  I like to make him think it was harder to prepare than it was. :)

The pork turned out tender and juicy, absolutely perfect. I used an eight pound pork shoulder roast, and it was done in twelve hours. This is an easy recepie to make, with few ingredients, and it would be wonderful for parties or entertaining. Thanks!

Loved the texture and tenderness of the meat, but MUCH too salty for our tastes, even using the Hawaiian sea salt.  Will definitely make again, but will cut down drastically on the salt and perhaps add some garlic for more flavor.

This was very good.  Will make again, just next time trimming lots of fat off.  Best suggestion I have is using an oven bag as the lining for the crock pot, saves clean up.

I didn't measure out the liquid smoke or sea salt (regular worked fine - couldn't find the hawaiian).  Instead I poured a light covering of smoke & patted on a layer of salt after placing the roast in the crock. (less messy this way & you don't lose any of the liquid smoke)
At about the 12 hour mark I turned it over & shredded it a little with a big fork.  I poured out some of the excess liquid (not all - just 1/3 or so), added another coating of smoke & salt & let it go on low for another 10-12 hours.  I ended up using about 2oz of liquid smoke & at least double the amount of salt in the recipe.
This was a little salty but mostly had a wonderful smokey taste.  Melted into juicy shreds that were perfect when served on the slightly sweet King's Hawaiian rolls.  
I made this for a luau themed party (made 2, 6lbs roasts for 35 people) & had no leftovers plus many requests for the recipe!  
I've made this at least 3 times since & found it also freezes & reheats well.

My husband loved this for dinner, took a sandwich to work today and asked if we could have it with barbecue sauce tonight. I, on the other hand, was not as impressed as he, but I did like it. I had a 3.5 lb. roast and cooked it in the crock pot for only 8 hours. ***I did use Hawaiian sea salt (ordered from the net), which is much more mild than regular salt. I think some of the people who said this was too salty used regular salt. If you use table salt, it needs to be scaled down.

Hmm.  After all of the "onolicious" comments, maybe I got myself too psyched up for this.  The house smelled amazing, but we were disappointed with the end result, which was bland, and incredibly greasy.  We have plenty of leftovers, so after I "pat it down," it may be salvageable for sandwiches.

Loved the slow cooking method but was way too plain with the amount of liquid smoke indicated.
After cooking for 16 hours, I shredded and added about 1/2 cup more liquid smoke. Was a little too salty for me also (maybe the extra liquid smoke caused that).Will do again, for sure though, with 1/2 cup smoke and only 2 tsp. sea salt.

Thank you for posting this recipe!!  I have enjoyed experimenting with it.  Recently I added a trick my friend recommended.  After the slow cooking is complete, simmer pork in a boiling mixture of a few cups of water (scale to more or less meat), a teaspoon or so (to taste) of sea salt, and a quarter teaspoon (again, to taste) of liquid smoke for about 15 minutes.  Its been a big hit!!

I have to admit this was pretty good but nothing can beat the real thing. Since my family raises pigs, we often make our own imu for luau but I just got a slow cooker for Christmas and really wanted to try this out. The smell while it was cooking was sooo good.  It is SUPER EASY. I wrapped the pork in washed & de-ribbed ti leaves and used kiawe (mesquite) liquid smoke to try to mimic the authentic kalua/imu flavor. It was really good, but the real thing is still the best! But for those far away or wanting just a little (and not the whole pig) this recipe will satisfy the craving!!

So yummy and so  easy! I put in the crock pot on high for 10 hours, and it was ready. My very picky daughter LOVES it. She wants me to make it 5 nights a week. Love the smokey flavor. Great, great recipe!!!!

This was soooooo awsome.  Blows Dinosaur BBQ out of the water.  It was salty but i loved it.  I usually smother my sandwiches in bbq sauce, but not this one, just some juice and the meat was the most tender i have ever eaten.  Cook for the whole 16 hours, it is done earlier but i think the longer cooking time is what makes it great.  After that long the fat is gone when it comes to shredding, your crock pot will be full of PURE MEAT..........YUMMY YUMMY TO MY TUMMY!!!! forever in your debt.

This is so simple and so, so tasty.  My friends and family just love it!  I make a traditional Hawaiian plate lunch by serving it w/ rice and salad. Kikuchan's potato-crab salad(also on this website) goes perfect w/this.  Thanks very much Kay.

My whole family enjoyed this dish.  The meat was tender and very tasty.  I don't know where I would buy Hawaiian sea salt here in Manitoba so I just used coarse salt.  The first time I tried it, I didn't like the cooking odor while I was trying to sleep, so the second time I cooked it for one day, put it in the fridge overnight, removed the fat, and then cooked for another day.  I was pleased with this method because I was able to remove a lot of fat and the meat was till tender and tasty.

I have rated this recipe before and my rating disappeared. I have used this recipe about 6-8 times. It is absolutely one of the best on this site. Every time I make it everyone just loves it. I always use the low setting and figure about 16-18 hours the last 3 hours I put it on "keep warm" I probably triple the liquid smoke and found Hawaiian salt which really makes it good. Try It You Will Love It. So easy and SO GOOD.

Absolutely awesome three ingredient recipe!  I could not find the Hawaiian sea salt so used pink himalayan.  I poured the crock pot juice into a tall tumbler glass which I placed in the freezer while I picked the meat.  This made it easy to skim and discard the fat which congealed on top.  Then back into the crockpot went the meat, skimmed juices and a bag of produce department cole slaw mix. (Shredded Cabbage and carrots). Cooked on low one additional hour, served on King's Hawaiian rolls.  The bomb!

Just wanted to tell you that BJ's Wholesale Club has Hawaiian Pink Sea Salt in a grinder.  I use it for everything/table salt and it's not very expensive.

Thank you for the recipe first of all. I used a pressure cooker instead of waiting for hours on end. Also like others mentioned I put a whole banana on top of the meat for extra flavor. Overall this is a great recipe.

GREAT RECIPE! I used the Trader Joe's sea salt I already had instead of the black salt (which my supermarket doesn't carry), and I probably tripled or even quadrupled the amount of Liquid Smoke seasoning during the course of cooking. I was able to spoon a lot of the fat off the meat before serving it the first time, and the next night I was able to get a lot more off once it had been chilled in the fridge. I served it first with hot rolls, then with French fries and salad, and the third time I even tossed the meat and gravy with whole-wheat rotini and chopped roasted broccoli. It's the dinner entree that keeps on giving!

This was amazing, and after it sat for several days in fridge, it was even better. I did not have Hawaiian sea salt so I used regular sea salt and a small can of pineapple juice.  AWESOME!

If I could give this more stars I would! This was the most tender, juciest pork I have ever had the pleasure of eating. I couldn't find the Hawiian salt the recipe called for so I used 1 T of regular sea salt, as I had read that the Hawiaan wasn't quite as salty. The only other change that I made was to add the unpeeled banana on top. I cooked it for the 18 hours on low in the crockpot, put the liquid in the freezer,  skimmed off the fat, and returned the rest of the liquid to the slow cooker. Shredded the meat and put it back in the crockpot and cooked on low for 1 hour more. I toasted some sub rolls in a frying pan with butter, melted some cheddar cheese on the top half of the roll and added a little BBQ sauce to the bottom roll, very small amount. Best pulled pork sandwiches EVER!!! Thank you for this recipe :)

Definitely a keeper!! My roast was probably 4 1/2 to 5 lb boneless. My little town didn't have Hawaiian sea salt, so I used Real Salt (mined out of Utah; see realsalt.com). Delicious!! Done in 14 hours on low...turning 3 times. I then removed the roast to a large bowl to shred and remove fat pieces. The juice was put into a bowl and set in the freezer where the fat separated from the juice and was easily removed. The shredded pork and fat-free juice were put back into the slow cooker and simmered for another two hours then set to warm until dinner. Fantastic dinner...served on buns with BBQ sauce on the side with Chinese Cabbage Salad I from this site. Update 4/2015 I used a bone-in, 6 lb roast and it was still done in 14 hours turning only once.

For those of you substituting Hawaiian Sea Salt with table, kosher, med. salt etc., you should stick to boiling water.

First of all thanks to Kikukat for a great recipe and to all who submitted helpful reviews.  I used a 3# pork loin instead of a pork butt roast.  Just didn't cook it as long.  Also tried to use as less Hawaiian sea salt as possible and it was still salty but I am thinking that is where the flavor comes from so added with the plain white rice it was just about right!  Served this with Lomi Lomi, Hawaiian Coleslaw (both from this site), Hawaiian Sweet bread (from store) and a split pineapple filled with fresh fruit.  It all made for a great luau party (along with all the decorations, of course)!  Again, Thank You!!!

I have a big dinner once a month at my house and needed something easy that would feed a lot of people, so I tried this. I put it in at midnight and when I went to turn it around at 10 am, it all fell apart on me, so I shredded the whole thing (it was shredding on its own by that point) and put it back in. So delicious and easy and pretty cheap! I used regular sea salt since I didn't have anything else and it was totally fine. I like it salty but nobody said it was too salty. I did add a little extra smoke after shredding it and putting it back in the crockpot.

I've used either sea salt or kosher salt...it usually doesn't take that long to cook, and sometimes I will use a pork loin in place of the pork butt roast...a little less fatty. I also add cabbage for the last hour or so for an authentic kalua pig meal.

This was pretty good. I will admit, I cheaped out and used kosher salt instead of the sea salt because it's what I had on hand. The pork was amazingly tender but a tiny bit dry - mine didn't make all of those wonderful juices that everyone else is raving about. Still, tender and flavorful. We made pork sandwiches on Italian rolls with thick slices of Swiss cheese. I loved how easy this recipe was - this is what slow cooker recipes are supposed to be! Good stuff.

This didn't have any particular flavor--just like a pork roast in a crock pot--and it was extremely greasy. So, we added BBQ sauce just to make it edible (didnt want to waste all that meat). It was extremely tender (almost the consistency of mashed potatoes) after only the minimum time (10 hours). I know some people said their roast dried out, but ours was the opposite--it was sitting in boiling broth that reached the top of the crock pot.

I can't imagine why this pulled pork recipe isn't more popular. It was wonderful.  The Pork isn't overpowered with thick sauces, etc.  The simplicity of the salt and liquid smoke, slow cooks was perfect.   My only change: difficult to obtain Hawaiin Sea Salt in the middle of Kansas.  So, I opted for Kosher salt.  No other changes.  It turned out perfect, full of flavor, tender, excellent. Kids have requested to have it every week.

This was the best Kalua pork I have had outside of hawaii. I followed some of the suggestions and cut the salt to one tablespoon. I used a 6lb pork shoulder and mesquite liquid smoke, cooked it on high (with the skin on) for 3hrs and then on low for 2hrs. I took it out, removed the skin, shredded it, put it back in the liquid, added a touch more mesquite liquid smoke and cooked it on low for another hour. It came out perfect, and not too salty. With the white rice, I felt like I was back in hawaii.

This is an easy, crowd pleasing recipe. I do not cook it as long as it says - depending on the size of the roast you may only have to cook it 7-8 hours on low. If you cook it too long it can become mealy and gummy as the meat breaks down too much. Serve this by itself, on buns, in tortillas, or lettuce wraps - all really good! We like to freeze the leftovers in tortillas for lunches.

I love this pork. So easy but so good. My granddaughter married a boy from Hawaii and she said to not take the meat out of the juices. Remove the bone and fat and shred it in the crock pot.

So easy to make, just rub Hawaiian salt and liquid smoke on it and drop it in your crock pot.I don't know how it compares to a pig roasted in the ground since I have never been to a luau, but this make a great pot of pulled pork.

This was yummy and oh so easy! I have a smaller crockpot so I used a 3lb roast and cooked it 17 hours.  It made 24 oz of pork- plenty for 6 people.

Very easy to make, I used Hickory liquid smoke. It is always a hit at the potluck! I cook it for 8-10 hours or so depending on the size of the meat. When it falls apart I break it down and let it cook an hour so it soaks up all the juices. This has become a family favorite.

This recipe was fantastic.  I seasoned and cooked as written, but after shredding the pork, followed the suggestions of other reviewers and put it back into the drippings to cook on low for another hour.  It was delicious!  Next time I will probably put the drippings in the freezer for an hour and skim the fat, to reduce on the greasiness, but it was delicious this way as well.  We ate it with Hawaiian sweet rolls and made mini-sandwiches all week for lunch.  Highly recommended!

SSSOOOOooooooo good! I've made this a number of times now and it's a no brainer! Great for tailgates and potlucks -- you'll be a hit! I've made this for my friend who grew up in Hawaii and she begged for the recipe! 

You can find the Hawaiian Sea Salt at Trader Joe's or Cost Plus Market. Sur La Table also carries it, but at a much higher price. --Enjoy!

Just as most everone says, "it is great"! The only thing different I did was follow another persons post and slice a banana in half (length way) and lay over the meat; I also add three toes of garlic. Thank you sooo much for sharing this recipe; it is appreciated!

This lives up to its reviews.  I used more of the salt and more of the liquid smoke, following my sister's instructions as she lived in Hawaii for years and she's the one who taught me to make this originally.  I don't think the time is right - my shoulder done in about 12 hours.  Served with sticky rice, lightly sauteed cabbage and Hawaiian bread.  It's the next best thing to being there!

Meat was very good. Thank you for such a easy meat to fix.  I read many, many reviews because I needed ideas for the whole meal.  Fixed mac salad with pineapple and carrots in it, rice and shredded cabbage to go with it.  Made a bunch of adults and kids very happy.  Desert was chocolate fondue and fruit.  A fun meal and I even have leftovers for work tomorrow.

You can rock the crockpot with this one! I use 7lb Pork Shoulder.  Rubbed Hawaiian Black Lava Sea Salt (found at Sprouts Market) and 1.5 T of Mesquite Liquid Smoke.  I added a teaspoon extra of salt because it wasn't salty enough.  I also added cabbage when there was one hour left.  Also added slice bananas on top of the  meat -- but there wasn't any banana smell or taste in the meat, next time will wrapped it in banana leaves.  I served this with sweet macaroni salad, mango salsa and sticky rice! I must say that the cabbage is a must because it brings texture to the dish.  Absolutely delicious.  The leftovers you can freeze or make whatever you want with it the next day!

This recipe is delicious.  The only thing I changed was I used pink himalayan sea salt and added cabbage in the last couple of hours -it was perfect.  I will try with hawaiian salt and using a banana as others have suggested.  With the original measurements, I had left overs for a week.

This kalua pig is awesome!  You barely even notice the difference between this one and the one you get at your friend's kid's first birthday luau!  :)  Thanks to Kikukat, I now have a signature dish that gets constant raves and requests for more from my family.  I cook the butt (or shoulder) roast for 14 hours, drain the oil, shred it the pork, add in a head of cabbage and cook it on high for another hour or until the cabbage is cooked.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Amazing!  I like to make a huge pork roast and make many meals with it. One of our favorites are garlic fried rice with the pork mixed through. Also pork enchiladas, pork chili, BBQ pork pizza. The possibilities are endless. It also freezes well. My slow cooker must run a little hotter because mine falls apart after 12 hours. The first time I left it in for almost 20 hours and it was pretty much pork mush. I guess it depends on your slow cooker. Great recipe!

This recipe is absolutely perfect, just the way it is. My crockpot may cook a bit higher than the KIKUKAT's.  My pork was done in 13 hours, and everyone in my family raved over it! I'd like to try adding in some sauted onions and bell  peppers, after it is done, the next time I make it. YUMMY! Edited to add: You can get some good Pacific Sea Salt from Penzeys.com, unless you are lucky enough, like I am, to have a store in town.

This was awesome.  I bought Hawaiian pink salt when we were in Hawaii so I used that along with a little sprinkling of black sea salt I got at Whole Foods.  I had a 4# roast so I used less salt than the recipe called for - still, it is a little salty but I love salty foods.  We are having this over rice tonight.  I cooked it in the crock pot for about 10 hours - it's just falling apart and soooo good.  Thank you Kikuchan for this recipe - it brings me back to Hawaii.  We'll be making this one a lot!

I made this tonight for dinner and loved it! My husband and I once had a bad experience with Liquid Smoke (used way too much) so I tried using some Applewood Smoked Salt and Himalayan Pink Salt. It added just the right amount of smoky taste and salty taste. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for such an easy and wonderful recipe!

So easy & so tasty! I just have to half the recipe since there's no way two of us can eat a 6lb roast before it goes bad...lol. Good on King's Hawaiian Rolls or rice with some mac salad. If you get tired of the same thing for a few meals, just add some BBQ sauce or teriyaki or whatever to a portion of the leftovers & you have a new meal.

This is exactly how I make my Kalua Pig. Only difference is that I use half a bottle of liquid smoke. Drives the neighbors and the neighborhood kids by saying it smells so good! I been cooking Kalua Pig like this for YEARS! I'd say foloow this recipe and if it isn't smoky enough for your taste add more liquid smoke next time.

Delicious!! Incredibly easy, inexpensive, and somehow amazingly delicious.  This will definitely be a regular meal for me and the bf.  I ate quite a lot of it plain, he ate the rest with some barbeque sauce (not Hawaiian, I know, but so tasty). Thanks!!

Absolutely delicious! Had to freeze some of the pork, and freezes great. Next time, will marinate for a few hours and will try and trim some fat. Alitttle greasy, but cooked off when re-heating. Had to slow cook the pork shoulder about 2 hours longer....fell off the bone! Wonderful taste.

This recipe is amazing!! All I had was tenderloin so I used about six lbs of that. I cooked it from 10:30 pm and shredded it at 8 am. I noticed that it absorbed all the juices so I added a cup of low sodium broth with a tsp of liquid smoke and half tsp of the hawaiian salt, just to make sure to maintain moisture and flavor. Then let cook on low for a couple more hours. Thanks for such a simple recipe!

Best Kalua Pig since we left Hawaii! And if you have left overs, just add some barbecue sauce and it's pulled pork! Yumm!

Love this just as it is!!  Only three ingredients and it is fabulous every time.  My family (husband and three kids) love it.  I serve the pork on Hawaiian sweet rolls.  The sweet and salt go great together.  So, so good.

I had a 7lb pork shoulder ("aka" pernil). I followed the directions without hawaiian sea salt as I couldn't find any. I put it in at 7pm, turned it at 10:30pm (because I was going to bed) and left it on low until 8:30am. At that time I left it on low because I was at work and had a roommate unplug it at 3pm. I came home at 6pm. The meat was very, very tender and fell off the bone. The taste was a drop smoky and although I used 1 1/2 TBS of salt, it needed more..or something. Everyone RAVED about it. I tried one hardened piece that was really good but the meat was very bland. I added more salt and more liquid smoke. I then added bbq sauce like another commenter did and had a pulled pork sandwich. I will try this again one day but with the hawaiin salt. Hopefully that would make a difference.

Definitely tastes like luau pork, but what your getting is basically pork cooked in it's own juices.  You'll need some good sauce to finish it off.

I've been making this for a year now - take it to potlucks, family gatherings, etc and always get asked for the recipe.  Like other reviewers, I add water or chicken broth for cooking. Leftovers are awesome - roll them in tortillas and bake for quick taquitos!

Delicious.  The publisher of the recipe must have a very old slow cooker -- because my pork started to become dry after 14 hours, so I turned it off.  It was completely done.  I followed the leader with liquid smoke (use more stated), sea salt, alittle black pepper and some allspice.  My bf and I are on day 2 of eating the pork (4.5lbs).  We have made bbq sandwiches as well as pulled pork tacos.  I will definately make this again.

My first attempt at this dish didn't seem any different from other pulled pork dishes, I barely tasted the smoke flavoring.  However, I have tried this again for the second time for a potluck and it was a hit.  I followed other commentors and added some cabbage and add'l smoke flavoring toward the end and the results were satisfying.  I received a lot of comments from those at the potluck requesting for the recipe.  I'd definitely make this again...although this time I'll make sure to find Hawaiian Salt - I found Himalayan Salt, which I thought was the closes thing to Hawaiian Salt. -- Still tasted wonderful - must be even better with Hawaiian Salt.

This was FANTASTIC! I had a 3.5lb shoulder blade cut, followed the recipe with reduced servings for 2 tsp liquid smoke and 1 tbsp hawaiian red clay sea salt. It was SO good. Once the meat had cooked 5 hours, I shredded it (removed the bone easily), tossed the meat back into the juices, added another tsp of liquid smoke (we love it), and threw some chopped cabbage in and let it cook an hour. Served with sushi rice. I threw more cabbage in later and didn't let the cabbage cook down in the crockpot - the crunch was really nice! I will absolutely make this again.

This is UH-MAZE-ING. I would give it six stars if I could. I used a "pork roast" and a "ham roast" totalling about 5 pounds. I shut it off after about 8.5 hours and it was perfectly done. I made a gravy out of the drippings and that was a nice added layer of flavor, but honestly I was munching while I shredded, sans gravy, and loving it!

Phenomenal taste and minimal work. I had a 4 lb pork shoulder, and used 2/3 the amount of salt (just plain sea salt) and liquid smoke. It was perfection.

Definitely take the meat out and shred it, discarding any tough and fatty pieces, then put it back in the juices. A Hawaiian friend suggested sauteeing onions to add at the very end before serving it with rice, and it was a great addition. 

And even after setting the slow cooker on high for a few hours in order to get this done in under 8 hours, the meat was extremely tender.

Love this recipe! It's even better if you peel a banana and wrap the salted roast in the peels. I leave the bananas in the crock pot, but not touching the roast. Scrumptious!

KILLER good stuff!  I was very happy to have leftovers because half my company canceled on me at the last minute!  I wish mine had as much liquid as some comments refer to, though.  mine wasn't dry in any definition of the word, but I wanted more juice!

So easy you can't go wrong. I added a little more liquid smoke flavoring and salt because I cooked a big pork roast. We all liked the pork. I had a lot left over so I added cumin, garlic powder, chili powder, sweet hungarian paprika and salsa verde. Then made tamales..Yummy.

After 10 hours the meat looked done, I was confused why I had to do another 6 - 10 hours.  But it made all the difference...made the meat get crusty.  SO GOOD!!!

It is hard to get any easier than this for a extremely tasty pork sandwich or dinner. I only added a little salt and garlic/pepper at the end. A keeper.

Easy and perfect as a sandwich with your favorite BBQ sauce. Husband and picky kid approved.  Being from the south, I'm going to try doubling the Liquid Smoke next time to see if it can have a little more smoked flavor.

Very tasty, just like I had in Hawaii. I used a 3lb roast and the same specified amount of liquid smoke and rubbed the salt all over. After it was finished, I removed the pork from the juice and shredded it. I separate the liquid in a gravy separator and only put the juice back in the pot with the shredded meat (and toss out the fat).

This was an absolutely amazing recipe!  We shredded the pork once it was done and mixed some of it with barbecue sauce and served it on toasted French rolls alongside of deli coleslaw that we doctored up with canned pineapple chunks and toasted walnuts.  I reserved the rest of the pork and used it for more sandwiches the next day! Make sure to use the Hawaiian salt called for in the recipe and don't forget to turn the meat halfway through the cooking time.

Since I was going to be away from home all day, I added one cup of water to crock before I put the roast in.  But in the end, there was a LOT of drippings...so next time I will make it w/o adding any water.  Also, I couldn't find Hawaiian sea salt so I used Mediterranean sea salt instead, and it was DELICIOUS!!!

absolutely fabulous!! i'm a working mom so the slow cooker is my best friend.  it it using the ingredients listed except scaled to a smaller serving size.  i didn't measure out the salt because i was using a grinder and at first it didn't seem like i used barely any salt compared to the size of the roast so it turned out a little saltier than expected.  Will hopefully remember that the juices will cook down and heighten the salt and use less next time.  Had it with jasmine rice and a side of homemade hawaiian-style macaroni salad.  My boyfriend and my two boys (6 + 2 1/2 y.o.) LOVE it... intend to try mixing in cabbage next time like another reviewer had suggested.  =)

Prepared as directed and was delicious.  The next day added bbq sauce and had a pulled pork sandwich with cheddar cheese and frenche's french friend onions (the ones you use for green bean casserole).

This is the best receipe I have found and I've used this website for years.  The pork tastes like what you get at Hawaiian restaurants and it's so easy to make.  I had to use regular sea salt because I couldn't find the Hawaiian stuff.  Didn't make any difference.  This was fabulous.  My dogs love it too.  This is a winner.  You can buy a pork roast for five dollars and feed your whole family with it.

i used 2 lbs of shoulder roast (safeway guy said its the same as pork butt) + 2 TB sea salt + 1 TB liquid smoke. I used a wolfgang pressure cooker so in another recipe, i found i needed to put water so i place enough water to cover 1/2 of the pork. I put on high for 1 hour (some1 told me to put for 1.5 and the other .5, so i decided to go halfway)   it came out pretty good but a little dry in the middle but the outside was mouthwateringly soft so maybe i will change the timing next time.

I did this over the weekend for Sunday dinner and it was great!  I looked for the Hawaiian sea salt and found it at Whole foods, then I thought the liquid smoke would be in the spice isle, but it's in the condiment isle.  Thanks to the cashier and manager at Publix I had my ingredient.  The roast was delicious and it was not salty as I thought it would be.  It took about 12 hours and I put the juices in the freezer a suggestion I read in a review to remove the excess fat and put the juices back in with the roast and just left it on low until it was time for dinner.  I will do this a few times since I have a whole jar of the Hawaiian salt and liquid smoke!

Very good, nice taste and very juicy. Everyone ate and nibbled at seconds. I did not cook on high for the whole time, I started 3 hours on high then 6-7 on low.

Made this a number of times and it was great.  Served with sauted cabbage.  I do add a bit more smoke and salt.  Start with basic recipe then adjust salt and smoke to taste the next time.

Loved Loved Loved this!  So easy and so good!  I was a little worried about it being too salty as some of the other reviews were.  But it was perfect!  I did have to order the Hawaii sea salt via the internet.  I did not think that package would ever get here!!  Will cook again and again!

When I'm not serving enough people to warrant roasting a whole pig in an imu, this is my go to recipe for luaus or any other island style party. I always get asked for the recipe and no one believes how easy it is.

I purchased the salt from a specialty store called World Market.  Since finding this recipe, I've made it several times for my family.  I drain the fat and add a little water or broth so that it stays juicy.

This was a very simple recipe! It wasn't quite like what we had but maybe it was due to the salt? I used the Hawaiian sea salt with the red clay rather than the other type some have mentioned. Still, very tasty pork! My husband isn't much of a leftovers person (and there was a lot leftover being it's just the two of us lol), so I had the idea of mixing it with some BBQ sauce and it was an entirely new, yummy, meal! Thank you for this recipe!!

This was a hit at several Hawaiian themed parties this year.  I used theAlaea (red) Hawaiian sea salt from World Market.  Be sure to use a fatty cut of meat, not a lean tenderloin.  You can strain off the fat after it's cooked.

I turned my oven into a slow cooker. I added the whole bottle of liquid smoke cuz I cooked 2 bone in roast. I did not have the right salt, so I used regular season salt. my family never even noticed. I will just for the heck of it use the Hawaiian salt next time.This was succulent and juicy. I made sandwiches out of it. The juice made an excellent sauce for the think rolls I used. Mayo on one side,basted the other side with the juice. I added jalapeno cheese and onions to the sammies.Soo Good!! I have never been to our 50th state and if this is the food that is served over there, I am packing my bags!! Thank You Kikuchan.

I was leery at first, 3 ingredients, and I am not a fan of liquid smoke- this recipe is heavenly! I used the red Hawaiian sea salt and mesquite liquid smoke, the meat literally fell from the bone and is like candy. I wanted to try this prior to having a party, and it is now in my recipe box for life...   On the reviews that said it was dry, perhaps you didn't have a tightly fitting crock pot lit, or used too lean a cut of pork. I used pork shoulder- it is the same thing as pork butt (named for the wooden kegs called butts they used to ship this cut of meat in). It was a 6.5 pound cut of meat and it only took 14 hours. I cooked it on low, and sealed the lid with tin foil- my crock pot lid broke several years ago, and I have used a different lid with tin foil to make it secure ever since).  Go for it, this recipe is amazing!

This was delicious!  The only hard part was locating the Hawaiian Salt.  I had to order online since our local Whole Foods did not carry it.  This lasted us three total meals as I separated it into thirds and froze some for a later date.  Thanks for sharing.  It was simple, easy and yummy.

This is the best recipe I've found on this site - and I've found a lot.  I love, love this recipe.  This has been a hit whenever I've served it for company.  I usually serve it on hamburger buns with some Hawaaian barbeque sauce.  I also usually make it with 3 lbs of pork and cook on high for 6 hours, then low for one hour.

I made this for a luau for 10 adults and 9 children.  Used Hawaiian rolls (purchased at Walmart).  I served it with coleslaw, barbecue sauce, pickles and cheese.  I checked all the stores in town and could not get Hawaiian sea salt so went with regular sea salt.  I might try and order the hawaiian salt on- line.  We had a buffet so double the recipe of meat was plenty.  I am looking forward to using the leftovers in other recipes.  I would recommend this for the taste, ease of preparation and buffet friendliness.  I did cut down on the salt by a 1 TBSP.

This is definitely the REAL thing!! I have been to Hawaii several times and this is exactly how I remember it.  It is tender, juicy and yes, salty!  Which is exactly how it is made in Hawaii.  Great served with Hawaiian Mac Salad or served over rice.  We recently had a luau party and I used 3 roasts in two slow cookers.  It definitely took 20 hours to make but was well worth it.  Everyone raved!  Thanks for sharing!!

Easy!  I used about a 3 lb. pork roast w/ the bone in.  Forgot to cut back on other ingredients with a smaller portion of meat but still turned out TASTY.  Cooked for 11 hours.  Someday I'll try the recipe as it is but this still was VERY GOOD!  Guests love it and I served mine with coleslaw on the bun.  Everyone will like this!

My husband said this was nearly as good as the pit Kalua pork he had growing up.(Trust me, that's a big concession!)This was such an easy recipe. I had a hard time finding the Hawaaian sea salt. Trader Joe's no longer carries it here in the Phoenix area, and Whole Foods did not have it, either. I ordered it online but later found it at World Market.I used a pork picnic roast, on sale for 99 cents/pound. Served it with cooked cabbage, macaroni salad, short grain rice and hawaaian rolls. No one needed barbeque sauce for this one. Thanks for a great recipe!

A wonderful recipe. I never really know how to cook a pork butt and found this recipe very helpful. I served this double portion over a Luau party and had over 40 people. It went very quick & nothing left. I added 2 whole onion, 2 tsp. salt,4 bay leaves and 5 crushed cloves of garlic  while cooking the entire time in the crock pot for more flavoring kick. VERY YUMMY!!!. A definite keeper in the house. Would make it again. Joy

This has been a staple recipe in our house since 2007. We use the pulled pork for Carnitas, pizza, pulled pork sandwiches, it feels like for everything. I haven’t done any substitutions and have been using this recipe at least monthly

AWESOME!  I threw it in frozen, and in the morning I put the liquid smoke and salt on.  It was great!  I would recommend turning it more than once though, parts of it got dry.

KIKKOMAN TERIYAKI SAUCE is the key condiment for those of you who say this recipe is missing something.  Just sprinkle it on the meat with your rice.  This meat also makes great barbecued pork sandwiches when you add barbecue saude.

Excellent!  I used a 6 1/2 lb pork butt and red sea salt.  I started it late at night and let it cook during the night and all day.  I shredded it..added back to the crockpot and let it cook in the juices for close to 2 more hours.  Total cooking time was around 15 hours.  The meat turned out so tender.  I kept catching the hubby sneaking bits!  Definitely a keeper!

This dish has now become a staple for all family events.  I have to admit that our large family of Hawaiians will eat just about anything, but this dish is something that makes everyone excited.  I've tried several variation before coming up with my final result.  I suggest only using Hawaiian red clay sea salt.  It gives a great flavor to the meat where other sea salts fall a bit short.  Also, I take a banana leaf and cut it to fit over the meat while cooking.  This adds a slight nutty flavor which makes the dish even more authentic.  Eat it over white rice.  Try it out and enjoy!

I don't know what Kalua Pig is supposed to taste like...but if it tastes anything like this, I'm SOLD!!!  My family DEVOURED this.  Hubby was SO happy (which makes me happy!).  I cooked it overnight on low...about 14 hours.  Then, shredded it, mixed it back in the juice in the crockpot and left it on warm for about 2 more hours.  It was amazingly simple and delicious!  Thanks!

I have made a similar recipe that adds 1 cup of apple cider to the crock pot as the pork cooks. I find it dilutes any saltiness of the pork and also adds some "juice". After cooking, I pour all the juice into a large measuring cup and put it in the fridge/freezer (depending on time). The fat floats to the top and can easily be scooped off. Then I put the remaining cooking liquid (which has turned gelatinous (and looks kinda weird)) back in with the shredded meat as desired for moistness.

This is GREAT!  I love recipes that allow the flavor of the meat to shine through and this does just that.  It's soooo simple, yet sooooo good!  I did not have Hawaiian sea salt, so I just used regular sea salt.  My roast (butt-shoulder, as it was the only *pork butt* one I could find) was about 7lbs, so I used the same amount of salt and a tad more liquid smoke.  I cooked in my crock pot on low for about 14 hours, then turned down to warm and de-fatted and de-boned and shredded the meat (and then returned to the crock pot on warm until we ate....about 6 hours later).  I like to eat it as is, while Mr. LTH prefers it as a sandwich.  This would be (will be!) a great make ahead party food.  The only 2 *issues* I had were it was a tad greasy (but I'm assuming that's because butt-shoulder is not the same as butt) and I did not like the smell of it while it was cooking (I was afraid I was not going to like it based on the smell and Mr. LTH said it kept him awake last night!).  Thanks for a great, effortless, dining delight...just my style!

This was good, I made another version of this recipe that had a bit more flavor than this did. However, this was easier in the slow cooker all day rather than baking it forever. A good, recipe to start with. I will definatley make these again, just with some more spices!!

This was very tender and very moist, but slightly bland.  I would probably put a rub on it next time to add flavor.   I also did not cook it as long as this said.  The meat was beginning to dry out, so I sliced it up and let it cook in the juices for another hour.

This turned out really good, but after a little work.  I couldn't find Hawaiian Sea Salt, so used regular sea salt instead.  After removing the pork from the crockpot and shredding, there was still SO MUCH greasy liquid on it, he squeezed it between some papertowels to remove the excess.  He also added some more salt and liquid smoke before putting it back in the crockpot on warm for an hour or so.  This definitely improved the flavor.  Maybe it's because we didn't use the right salt to begin with.  The end result was really good though!  I would definitely make it again, but not before I find some Hawaiian Sea Salt.

I have made this recipe twice.  Once for my husband, and one time for some friends.  It has been months since we have had this, and all of them talk about this recipe frequently.  I am going to make it again soon.  All of us love it!  It's hard to stop once you start eating it.

This was an amazing flavor for being so simple!  Watch the porportions.  Multiply the salt and liquid smoke for how many pounds your roast is.  I had a 4 lb roast and butterflied it open.  Afer the fork holes, I coated the whole area with salt and then rubbed and did the same with the liquid smoke.  It was approximately quadrupled from the recipe for a 1 lb. roast and did not taste to salty.  I wonder if this would work for beef too-I'm a Nebraskan!:)

I've had Kalua pig in Kona, HI and this does taste just like I remember! Yum!  I would recommend putting the slow cooker in the garage-it tends to give off a burnt smell because of the liquid smoke.

Very delicious! I made this for my family when they came to dinner. Everyone said it tasted great. My mom even went home and bought her own roast to cook it again. I did place a few slices of onion on the bottom of the slow cooker so the meat would not scorch. I didn’t cook it for the recommended 20 hours. I cooked it on low for 2 hours, then on high for 4 hours. The meat just fell off the bone. I will defiantly make this again when I have company. Thanks for sharing!

Yummy, my Mom had three helpings (she normally doesn't have more than one) and my VERY picky husband had two.  Very simple.  I followed other suggestions to remove the fat from the juice, shread and put back in.  I also served it with the Pani Popo bread, Green Beans, and a salad.  Will make this again (probably with a smaller roast.

Very good! We had to use regular salt and then I threw in a little seasoning salt. Great with BBQ sauce!

Incredibly easy and so delicious. Followed the recipe exactly - although I was nervous about not adding any liquid and cooking it for 20 hours. It was so moist and tender and turned out perfect.

Absolutely ridiculously delicious and close to authentic!  I only had a 3lb cut of meat so I cooked for only 13 hours, but did NOT reduce the liquid smoke or sea salt (any kind should do; I used a Stonewall Kitchen (Maine) brand.

Great recipe! Very easy and very tasty. I've tried this with both kosher salt and hawaiian sea salt and didn't find any difference. A 6 lb. pork butt may seem like a lot at first, but leftovers can be frozen or I even use the pork to make burritos since it's similar tasting to carnitas.

I was so excited in making this because of all the reviews, but it was just bland for me.  I don't what I did wrong.  I used sea salt (couldn't find Hawaiian sea salt) and Hickory liquid smoke.  The meat came out really tender after 9 hours on low, but it didn't taste appetizing to me.  To save the dish, I had to add bbq sauce to it to make it edible. I was hoping this dish would be a keeper.

Couldn't find Hawaiian sea salt but found some South Pacific sea salt and used that along with Wright's Hickory Seasoning Liquid Smoke. Cooked a 3lb roast for 13 hours turning over every 3 or 4 hours. Tried turning over the last time and it completely fell apart! Shredded it up at this point and let it sit in the juices for another hour. Served with macaroni salad, King's Hawaiian Rolls and white rice. Poured BBQ sauce over the leftovers and served on a roll as a BBQ pork sandwich - these were great too.

I was tempted to 'jazz' up this recipe, but was very glad I decided not to. 

I did use kosher salt that I had on hand in substitution for the sea salt, and used hickory liquid smoke.

The one trick that I did apply that I believe I saw referenced in another review was to remove the roast to a plate, then I dispensed the juices through a sieve, into a gravy separator. I allowed the juices and fat to separate out, then returned the juices to the slow cooker and discarded the fat. Returned the falling apart, pork, shredded it, removing any other large pieces of internal fat, and let it cook for another hour. 

My wife was dubious about the outcome given the ingredients (or lack thereof) but she raved about the results. I pass this recipe along every time conversation about BBQ comes up.

This is awesome!  I cooked my roast for about 20 hours on low in my slow cooker.  I was wary of not adding any liquid to the slowcooker but the roast makes it's own wonderful juices!  I used to live in Hawaii and this comes close to what they have there.  I mixed mine with some sweet onion and cabbage i chopped up and steamed/boiled in a pan for about 5-10 minutes... SO GOOD!  Just put it on top of white sticky rice... just like the islands!  So ono!

OMG...This is the best pork recipe! I used plain sea salt and did find it a little salty so I may cut back next time but I kind of liked the salty taste too. The liquid smoke flavor was very light so I may add a little more next time but then again this was soooooo good that I hate to take a chance and mess it up. I cooked it for 19 hours and it was so juicy and tender... one for the recipe box!

This recipe is really good, but be forewarned--if you use a smaller cut of meat, you need to adjust the cooking time, and it won't be as tender!  I tried this twice, and the larger batch came out much better!

My friend in college taught me to make this dish.  He uses Worcestershire sauce instead of liquid smoke.  It is truly one of the best ways to eat pork! So glad to find it here too!

This is great. A big part of what helps make it great that it keeps you free to do other things just put it on and go do your thing. The left overs freeze well and are also great in dishes that call for left over pork. What's not to love?

This was the best piece of butt I have ever had.  I had a 3.2 lb roast and added 1/2 the amt of salt wc I used kosher bc that was all I could find and i added extra liquid smoke.  I cooked it for about 11 1/2 hrs and it came out perfect.  My kids did not say one word during dinner wc is very unusual.

Great recipe.  We had a luau and I doubled this recipe. It was a huge hit! I added some garlic powder to the meat and cooked for 20 hrs.  Then I placed the shredded pork in a crockpot and served with hawaiian rolls.  On the side, I bought a honey teryaki glaze sauce that I  added crushed pineapple to.  Then I placed the glaze in a small crockpot.   A great addittion for those who want more but the meat is wonderful alone :)

This was my first kalua pork so I cannot speak to the authenticity of this recipe. I used a 3 lb. roast & adjusted the ingredients accordingly. It cooked up perfectly in 10 hours. I was leary of the smoke/salt being overpowering based on some of the other reviews, but the actual roast was very simple tasting. Maybe it was because I didn't add any of the drippings. The recipe said add if needed to moisten, but the roast was plenty moist on it's own. I think this is a good basic recipe that could easy be expanded on or used to make other items (shredded BBQ sandwiches or pork burritos maybe?). Thanks.

I had 4 of the pickiest eaters (my kids)in the world, my husband and 2 other child guests that were visiting and EVERYONE loved this recipe!!  It was very plain, making this so versitile.  I don't like BBQ, so I loved it plain, most of the family added BBQ sauce.  My parents had the leftovers the next day and they too loved it and are talking about buying a slow cooker after eating this delish recipe.  I liked being able to put it in the night before and having it ready for dinner since mornings are so hectic around here.  I don't like pork...until now, thanks for the recipe, it will be on our menu often.  The large roast yields plenty, so plan on lots of leftovers that are even better the next day!

This was awesome! We had it for the St. Patty's weekend and it was a great change of pace. I took the leftovers and added teriyaki sauce before placing in the refrigerator. The next day, I warmed it up and served on Hawaiian bread rolls! YUMMY! And the flavor had changed so hubby didn't realize he was eating leftovers!

I was so happy when I found this recipe, I was searching for the perfect Kalua pork recipe, went through a lot for bad ones and stopped at this one. If you are in a pinch and don't have the hawaian sea salt, kosher salt works well. And it makes great leftover sandwiches.

I have also made this recipe many times and it is a winner.  Just came back from Maui and have to say that this was better than what I ate over there.  I will be sharing this dish at a potluck next week.  Mahalo for the great recipe.

This is THE BEST. I got the sea salt
from a friend in Maui. You need to
find this because of the flavor.
A real crowd pleaser and EASY. I cooked
2 roasts and did it in the oven slowly
over night, then transferred to crock to finish it with bbq sauce. A HIT

WOW! Words can't describe just how good this really is! You must use the Hawaiian sea salt & liquid smoke. As another reviewer suggested, I put 2 whole, unpeeled bananas on top of the shredded pork for the last 2 hours. The flavor was amazing! It took on a mildly sweet banana flavor. I served it on large Hawaiian Rolls. I will definitely make this again!

Absolutely delicious - definitely a keeper!  A much lighter smokey flavor than the pork I have been served at Hawaiian luaus, which actually makes it more versatile.  I can think of dozens of recipes to use this pork in!  My husband had his in a soft taco the first night, suggested using it in enchiladas or taquitos, and I used it along with some of the leftover broth to make Saimen Noodle Soup the following night. (Another delicious hawaiian recipe we recently enjoyed in Kuaui.)  I followed this recipe as written, using white Hawaiian sea salt and a pork shoulder roast.  You may want to add a touch more liquid smoke if you like a heavier smoke flavor, but we liked the subtleness of the smoke flavor of the recipe as written.

A good easy recipe. Nice flavor on its own or with BBQ sauce, for sandwiches. For those doing a smaller roast, it took a 3 pound roast about 6 hours on high. I added a whole head of peeled garlic, but then, that's what I do to everything!

WOW!!!!! This was fantastic.  I put it in the slow cooker about 9:00 p.m., when I woke up the next morning the aroma had filled the house.  It was so hard to stay out of it.  I cooked it about 18 hours.  My husband loved it.  This will be a something I fix quite often.

This came out very good.  Didn't have hawaiian sea salt the first time though, I used regular sea salt.  My sister lives in Hawaii so I had her mail me a bag full of Hawaiian sea salt, so hopefully it will be even better next time.   I love this recipe in the winter when its too cold for me to cook outside on the grill/smoker all day.

I made this for a large family hawaiian theme get together. I trimmed the fat from 6 lbs of boneless loin roast before cooking. Served with steamed rice and homemade teriyaki sauce. Everyone wanted the recipe for this moist and delicious meat!

If you have never been to Hawaii and had Kalua Pig you're in luck because you can now make it at home with this recipe!  Do not alter the recipe; it is exactly how Kalua Pig is suppose to taste like!  I found Hawaiian Sea Salt on EBay and it was shipped to me in 4 days!  I just finished shredding the pork and had to write this because it is sooooo good!  Just add 2 scoops rice, mac salad, and kim chee and you have one ono plate lunch!!! Mahalo Brah!

I had no idea it was possible to make kalua pork at home in a slow cooker.  This turned out PERFECT, and it could not have been easier.  Won't be paying over $7 for a 12 oz. container of kalua pork from Hawaii anymore!  Thanks for the awesome recipe.

I lived in Hawaii for over 20 years and went to many places where Kalua Pig was served. And this is by far THE best recipe for getting the taste of Hawaii. I served it with Hawaiian mac salad, sweet potato souffle, and pineapple sausage stuffing. It was a real hit for a Hawaiian Christmas meal in Bellingham, WA. Tomorrow I will add cabbage to the left overs and will be serving it with Hawaiian Sweet Bread Rolls (which you can find in mainlnad groceries all of the US). Mahalo to the original poster!!!

Extremely greasy, even though I'd had the butcher trim all visible fat off.  I ended up pouring off the juices, refrigerating them, removing the fat (I took almost a cup of fat off the  top) and then re-adding the juices to the meat and rewarming it.  Way too much work for a crockpot recipe -- next time I'll just roast the meat.

I didn't have Hawaiian sea salt (will purchase online for the next time I make this recipe) but used French Sea Salt (gray salt) and couldn't wait for the full time allowed!  Using tongs, I reached into the crockpot and with no effort at all, pulled the bone out of the roast!!!  This meat was incredible!  So simple, yet delish!  I used the leftovers for pork tamales by adding some verde sauce to the pork and then the next day I made bbq pulled pork sandwiches.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

We had a party and this was a huge success!!  I read all the reviews and I cut back on the liquid - it was not so fatty.  I was able to find the Hawaiian sea salt in an Asian food market. Thanks for this quick and easy recipe.

I brought this to a luau and it was a big hit! Very easy to make. I did use kosher salt instead of Hawaiian sea salt but only used half of what was called for. Shredded the ham and added some of the juice to it, a few pineapple rings to garnish. YUM!

My husband loved this and thought it tasted like the pork from Hawaii. I didn't cook it for 20 hours. Instead, I set the cooker on high for 2 hours and low for 10. I used a 6 lb butt roast with bone in. It was very tender. I made the mistake of draining too much liquid and it started to dry out. Save some for reserve. At the ended, I added three rings of pineapple and about 3 Tbsp of juice. Yum. I also used about 1 tbs of reg. salt in lieu of sea salt. I am making this again soon! Thanks!

My husband thought this was the best dish I had ever made him.  I was absolutely giddy about it myself.  I used a 3.5 lb shoulder roast and regular salt - put it in at 8 am, flipped it once, done at 6:30.  No fat.  Superb.  Can't screw it up.

pretty good recipe but you DO NOT need to use any type of sea salt to have this dish come out tasty. i used regular salt, sliced 2 large yellow onions and placed in the bottom of the crock pot along with 1 can of chicken broth and cooked for 14 hours on low heat. it's excellent shredded, mixed with your favorite bbq sauce and then placed on toasted hamburger buns.

I made this dish for some friends who grew up in Hawaii.  They loved it and said that it tasted exactly like they remembered eating in Hawaii.  I added about a 1/4 cup of water to keep it moist.  Excellent with a side of rice topped with teriyaki sauce.

My husband is a pork fanatic and he says this is the BEST pork dish I've ever cooked.  Couldn't bear to tell him how easy it was.  I finally found the Hawaiian sea salt at Target - after going to several "specialty" stores.  The only change I made was the cooking time - maybe my cooker is hotter than most - but the roast was completely done and tender in about 10 hours.  EXCELLENT!!!  This will become a staple in my home.

I added extra smoke flavoring and served the pork with several different kinds of barbecue sauces to suit different tastes (mesquite flavored, hot and spicy, hickory, etc.); and offered different types of buns (whole wheat, sesame, onion)at a party. Everyone loved the pork and the accompaniments! Great Recipe!

Positively fabulous recipe!  This was so easy and resulted in 4 meals.  I ate the roast the first night as is and mixed the rest into different dishes, i.e. barbecue pork for sandwiches, chile verde sauce for burritos and added chili powder and spices for quick tamales.  Very highly recommended and WILL be made again in our house!  Thanks for the great and easy recipe!

I fixed this recipe to have ready for Superbowl Sunday.  I scaled the recipe to 4 servings, using a 3 1/2lb pork butt. I also ajusted the seasonings for 4 servings . The roast was tender and perfect in 12 hours, on my low setting.  It tasted delicious!!  I will add a little more liquid smoke next time, as I love that taste in meats.  We served the pork on french rolls with all our favorite condiments. I also served nachos with the usual toppings, including the pork on them. I had nachos with Kalua pork in Kauai, Ha. last fall, and loved them this way. Thanks for a tasty and simple recipe.

I lived Maui for 2 years .. so we crave this and not much Hawaiian food in Texas . I made this it was amazing ! And we had so much leftover it lasted the whole week. Ordered the red salt on amazon from Molokai. The only thing I did different was add a bunch of garlic cloves inserted all over the pork . Add cabbage in the last hour . I like with Mac with macaroni salad .. and Hawaiian rolls .  Ono

I make this all the time!! (Although, I add other seasonings to the rub as well, just for more flavor.)
It's just so versatile! 
Sauce it or not. Use in sandwhiches, tacos, on salads, as a main entree..... I can find 1000 uses for it. 
I make a big batch on a Sunday and I use it for the rest of the week!

Simple and delicious. But you have to make cabbage & white rice with it!
To make the cabbage, shred it about an hour before dinner. Put it in it's own pot and add a cup or cup & a half of the juices out of the pork. Add a little black pepper & simmer for the better part of an hour. Serve the cabbage over some rice along with the shredded pork and some Sri Racha pepper sauce.

I am accelerating this recipe in the Instant Pot.  I have done it before, and tasted excellent, in much less than half the time.  I like pork butt as carnitas probably best, as it brings other richer flavors into the roast, but this one has its own amazing character.  As to all the discussion about pork butt vs. shoulder, yes, this is actually the pig's shoulder. The "butt" or posterior of the pig actually becomes the ham.  So, when you are eating ham you are actually eating the pig's hindquarter.

Kalua pig, prepared this quick and simple way, is so delicious.  I’ve found it’s even better (for our tastes) when I add extra smoke favoring.  When it’s pretty much done cooking, I chop a head of cabbage, place it in my other crockpot, drizzle and stir in some of the juices from the meat and let it cook until it’s how we like it and serve these with white rice. *Also, when I get a late start and have to cut the time by cutting the meat into a few smaller pieces and cooking it on high, it still turns out great.

I made a 1/2 recipe ( there's two of us). It cooked in the slow cooker on low for 15 hours. While it didn't taste a lot like kalua pork (next time i'll use more smoke) it was absolutely delicious. I'll definitely make it again.

I too could only find an 8.5 pound roast but it cooked very well in the 20 hour time frame.  I did put the two split bananas on top of the roast and used less salt (can't find the red clay kind in our town) and less liquid smoke per other reviews.  I also put the drippings into the freezer in order to be able to remove all the fat as another reviewer had suggested..  The roast was falling apart tender and delicious with our without extra barbeque sauce.  Our guests loved it and I had leftovers to freeze for another time.  Great and easy recipe.

I made this twice, both times a little different in terms of meat style. I read that pork shoulder is the same as pork butt. 


First time - Got skinless, boneless, lean (little to no fat) small chunks (1.5lb-2lb each chunk). Did everything it said, except I forgot to poke holes until after rubbing salt and liquid smoke. Tried to flip it over around 8-10 hour mark, too loose, it all shredded, oh well. Before flipping, saw there was a LOT of juice. After shredding and kept it low for few more hours, juice level gone down significantly. Looks dry, but not, still very moist. A tad too salty. Sauteed/Stir fried some cabbage and mixed it in, all good.

Second time - Got bone in, with skin (fatty underneath), 6.15lb chunk. Did everything it said, except no more Hawaiian salt, just used coarse see salt, all good. Skin up, scraped skin off around 13-16hour mark. Tried to flip, a little loose but less than last time because it's one big chunk instead of bunch of smaller ones. Not as much juice as last time, oh well. Kept it low for few more hours. Took out the bones, shredded it, juicy and moist from the fat. Still a tad too salty. Made kalua pork burrito with saffron yellow rice, pinto beans, and some sauteed/stir fried cabbage. Fantastic.


Next time I will keep using the bone-in with skin, and decrease the salt from 1.5 tablespoon to 1 tablespoon.

I was extremely worried about 16-20 hour time frame. I failed to put it in at the time I had originally planned, so I put it on high for about 6 hours.  Due to the constant negative reviews regarding how salty it was I lowered the amount of salt I put on the pork. Turned out great. In fact, I have been asked for the recipe because it was that good. It fell apart, was extremely juicy, not too salty, and had the best mesquite flavor. Thank you so much for the recipe. I have a hard time with cooking, and am clearly not a chef. This was easy, and tasty. Everyone had seconds, so that said everything.

Huge hit!!
I was excited to see this on here, ave made this for years and it is one of my family's favorite meals only I use a lean loin roast and rub it with a bit of olive oil and add a half cup of water and cook for 6-8 hours on low.  Once done, Any fat pulls right off, and 

















then I shred it up and thanks to the bit of water and olive oil, it remains moist without the fat.   We serve over steamed rice with chili garlic sauce but have also used with BBQ sauce and baked potatoes or in buns.  It is truly phenomenal how much flavor this simple recipe packs into the meat.

The simplicity of the recipe and the use of liquid smoke had me skeptical about this recipe, but it's fantastic. I put it in one night, and when I woke up in the morning I was flabbergasted at the deliciousness that had filled the crock pot.

The final results were absolutely fantastic, and I'm shocked there were any left overs.

I had to throw this out. Sure it was tender but it had enough salt in it to choke a horse. I thought over 1 tablespoon was crazy and should have followed my instinct. Also, 20 hours was too long. It was nice and moist at about 14 hours (lunchtime) but by dinner was on verge of drying out.

Who knew so few ingredients would yield such a delicious recipe! After shredding the pork, I added it back into the crockpot with one cut-up head of cabbage and cooked for an additional hour.

I made this for a Fourth of July Party with a Hawaiian theme. The recipe was easy and super delicious. Smelled great throughout the house as it was cooking.  The pork was tender and moist. I served Noh of Hawaii BBQ sauce and it was perfection.  A tip: shred the pork roast in the kitchen-aid mixer for quick and easy shredding.

The slow cooker is the easiest method ever!  I usually trim most of the fat off of the pork butt, then rub 3 T. crushed garlic and 1T grated ginger with the liquid smoke and Hawaiian sea salt to the pork before I turn the slow cooker on (6-8 hours only!!).  When it's done, I take the pork out carefully (as it falls apart) so I can drain the juices into a separate bowl.  I shred the pork, then put it back into the cooker with 3/4 head of chopped cabbage and mix it.  I slowly add some of the juices back for my desired consistency, and a little more Hawaiian sea salt, if necessary.

WOW! At first bite you think, hmmm this isn't really all that flavorful, but THEN you get the saltiness and a hint of the smoky flavor and you realize this is DELICIOUS! 
I read through almost every single review because I was skeptical of cooking pork in the crock pot for 16-20 hours.  This seems to work for most people, but mine was done after 8 hours, so be sure to check your meat.  Shredded it the last hour and let it sit in the juices.  I found my Hawaiian salt at TJ Maxx/Home Goods store. 
I have a feeling we will be making this a lot for big group gatherings or turning it into several different meals throughout the week since it is so quick to prepare.

Absolutely fantastic. Living in SC people love their barbecued pork and their different kinds of barbecue sauces, but this dish needs no sauce it is best eaten without any sauce just the juices it is cooked in. All my friends and family have said this is the best pork they ever tasted.

The pork is like butter and the flavor is good. Just wish it was less salty. I like salt, but this is a little much for me. Definitely will make this again, just with a tbsp on salt instead.

This is the amazing!! Followed the recipe exactly. And it came out tasting Exactly, if not Very close to what we had in Oahu.
But make sure you use BLACK Hawaiian sea salt! It wont look very pretty... but It will taste amazing.

By far the best pork roast I've ever had.  Used a shoulder roast and was able to find black Hawaiian sea salt at Lucky's market.  It was outstanding.  Served it shredded over almond wild rice (also found at Lucky's) and it was probably one of the best meals I've made.  It's THAT good!

I've made this a dozen times and it's always a winner. I had some leftover last time and I threw it in the freezer. After thawing it in the freezer, I heat up a skillet and fried the pork in its own fat until it was just slightly crispy like carnitas. Omg.  I just won leftover night.

You definitely need to reduce the amount of salt in the recipe. I try to remember my mom's tip about using salt with any meat: 1 teaspoon, flat  not overfilled, for every 2lbs. I usually rub the meat with spices, crushed garlic, salt, black peppers and leave it in fridge overnight or at least for a few hours: the flavor will be much better and salt would penetray deeper without causing excessive saltiness in the top layers. You can cover the baking dish tightly with foil and bake the meat in oven instead the slowcooker. Time would vary based on how big is your piece. I usually buy 2 boneless boston butt chunks 8lbs total and cook them at high 450F for 1 hr, and the next 3 hr with reduced heat - 300F.

The meat was good, but not amazing.  I used a 4 lbs boneless pork butt.  Since my cut of meat was a bit smaller I reduced the amount of salt to 2 teaspoons and the amount of liquid smoke to 2.5 teaspoons.  I used hickory liquid smoke because I couldn't fine mesquite at the store.  I cooked the meat for 16 hours, flipping once.  Then I took it out and shredded it, strained the juices from the crock pot into my fat separator.  I poured the juice back into the slow cooker and added the shredded meat in and let it sit in the crockpot on warm for 2 more hours.  The meat absorbed a lot of the juice and was very moist and flavorful.  I did take the time to find Red Hawaiian Sea Salt.  For those of you near a Kroger I found mine near their organic section on an end cap.  It was sold in a small clear plastic container, like the kind used to hold individual portions of seasonings or salad toppings.  I served the meal with sweet rolls and the Hawaiian Cole Slaw (from this site).

I used half of a pork loin; a much drier meat so I was surprised by how much wonderful juice produced.  After shredding I put the meat back into the cooker with the juice to let it soak up all that flavor.  I also found that leftovers (when you have them) can easily be transformed for other dishes...like pork fried rice, or taco filling. The uses are endless, so I always try to cook extra and freeze it for future quick uses.  Unbelievably good and versatile!

I couldn't find Hawaiian salt anywhere, so I used what I had left of some smoked salt (about 2tp) and kosher salt to rub. Although I will definitely look for Hawaiian salt in the future, even with my substitute it was very good. I added a halved brown banana on the top while cooking due to other reviews but I'm not sure it made a difference. It was done in only 11 hours on low on my crockpot.

This recipe was a cinch. Hardest part was finding the salt. I ended up with course grain pink himalayan and it worked out fine. i hada 9 pound roast and it was perfect in 12 hours w/ one turn.

i loved the idea of swiss on kings hawaiaiin rolls but my rolls got too soggy. Perhaps if you toast the roll first it would hold up better.

Will make this again!

I used an 8# shoulder roast. Started it at 4:30 p.m. It was done by midnight but left it as recipe states. Shredded it about noon the following day, came apart very nicely. 
Quite a bit of 'stuff' that I removed and sent out to the cats. Very nice flavor and super tender and moist. 
I had a hard time finding the Hawaiian salt. Found it in our local food co-op and it was the red one and it stated that it was the main ingredient in Kalua Pig! I knew then that I was on the right track. I will make it again.  I also found the Hawaiian rolls. Can't wait to try the sandwiches.

I made this yesterday and I won't cook my pulled pork any other way!  I cooked it on low for 8 hours and it totally fell apart and was so juicy.  Took me right back to my trip to Oahu. :)

I have been making kalua pig while we lived on the Islands and now on the mainland. I used to use banana leaf but now since we no longer have a banana tree in my backyard, I use 4-5 whole bananas. I poke holes all over the pork and then rub the smoke and salt all over. With fat side up, place bananas on top then on goes the lid. I cook for 3 hours high then 5-6 on low. We eat it with white rice and peas. Yummy! Also with leftovers, kalua pig nachos are great. Just layers of nacho chips, cheese, pig, then top with black olives, tomatoes, guacamole, whatever you like! This recipe is da kine grinds!

So simple and SO GOOD! I made this for a church party of 30 people and everyone loved it. Make sure to check around before buying the Hawaiian Sea Salt.  I could only find it at one store (Hy-Vee Health Market) in Cedar Rapids, IA and it was $14.00 for 7oz.!  If you have the time, make sure to look on line to buy it as you can find it much cheaper! Because I was short on time, I read the reviews and was going to cheat on the salt but decided to buy it at that price anyway.  So glad I did.  It really is different. I will definately make this again!

Was a bit skeptical at first, but this recipe turned out fantastic. My roast was a bit bigger than required but added an extra hour and this turned out magnificent! Served it with some shredded red cabbage using the cooking juices from the cooker and a little bbq sauce on some hamburger buns...Yum! Will be making this again for sure!

The ingredients are so simple!  However, I cooked it on low for 24+ hours, and about the 12-hr mark I shredded it while it was in the juices.  The shredded met soaks it all up and the finish product is just absolutely divine and moist.  Not to mention the whole house plus the neighborhood smells of Awesome. A huge family fave, and made this several times on the mainland for family. :)

My Mom obtained this recipe in Hawaii when my Dad was stationed there years ago. Being garlic lovers, we've always pierced the pork with a large knife & push 8-10 cloves of garlic into the meat and then cook! It's especially yummy served over rice and makes the best BBQ sandwiches...if there's any leftover!

This tasted pretty similar to what we had in Hawaii. I think next time I will add more smoke and less salt. That is just a personal preference. It was very easy to make and tasted great!

This Kailua pork recipe is delicious! I have it many times in hawaii and it tastes very similar! SO delicious! We like to put it on those hawaiin buns with potato salad on the side. I know that's not traditional but its easy and something you can try! Definitely make this recipe!!!

Fantastic! Made this in my crock pot with a 3lb roast rubbed with the red Hawaiian salt and just a dash of liquid smoke (I don't really like things with a smokey flavor). Cooked on low for about 12 hours. It was fantastic. My husband raved about it. We both agreed it was just as good as the Kalua Pig we had on Oahu last spring. Will definitely make this again. Honestly, it couldn't have been simpler. We served it with short grain rice and mac salad and fresh pineapple. Next time might try as a sandwich. I have a strong feeling this will become a regular in our rotation.

Fantastic.  We do large batches and freeze it for quick weeknight dinners.  Can be used as pulled pork with bbq sauce or Hawaiian mixed plate with rice and macaroni or coleslaw.

Man this recipe is great!  I can't wait to make it again.  I used a 6 lb. pork butt/shoulder, Hickory liquid smoke, red Hawaiian salt and two whole bananas on top with a slit along the side.  5 1/2 hours on HIGH then 7 hours LOW.  I used the others' recommendation and  poured the liquid in a cup and let the fat settle to the top in the freezer.  Then skimmed off the fat and put back into the crock pot for another hour with the shredded pork.

Next time I'm gonna add the pineapple juice, maybe try the mesquite liquid smoke just to see the difference.  You must try this recipe!

I made this a couple of days ago. I was a little disappointed that it didn't WOW me right out of the crock pot, but it was super moist and tender. My sons and husband added some BBQ sauce, but I made my own sauce of roast juice, pineapple juice, a touch of terriyaki, and brown sugar, and a dash of soy sauce. Toasted my bun and topped with a slice of grilled pineapple and it was AMAZING!!! Next time I will cook and "reduce" the sauce to make it a little thicker, but it was still great. It seems to be a great roast recipe that takes on any flavor you add and makes it super! Will make again!

This is VERY good.  I cooked it 22+hours on low, turning over half way through.  I added several cups of coarsely chopped cabbage about 45 minutes before serving.  Really great with Thai peanut sauce over rice too, just to change it up at serving time.

This is a staple in our house. So easy and delicious. I usually do half the amount and it cooks on low for 10-12 hours then we chop up about a half a green cabbage and let it cook for another 30". Love that it cooks all day while I'm at work. We serve it over white rice or on Hawaiian rolls

This recipe is wonderful, and being from Hawaii it's the closest thing I've ever had.  Just for fun I bought two 6 lbs pork butt roast's and put one in a crock pot following the recipe exactly, and the other one I put cabbage leaves on the bottom and top of the roast since I didn't have tea leaves.  When it was done (20 hrs on low), I discarded the cabbage leaves and the meat was so tender and not dried out at all.  I also did what others suggested on the liquid and put in freezer to get the fat to the top, then put the good stuff back in the crock pot.  I also cut up on small head of cabbage to added to the pork and broth, and so very ono (delicious)!!  Mahalo for sharing your wonderful recipe!!

I set my slow cooker to high for half the time, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It was moist and flavourful, and the smoky flavour really came through. Oh, and my kitchen smelled wonderful all day.

Great recipe!  It is so tempting to think you need to add more to this recipe but you don't. I didn't change anything except to use regular sea salt as I didn't have Hawaiian. I cooked pork for 14 hours and it fell apart when took it out of slow cooker.   My family loved it.

Not that this recipe needs anymore rave reviews, but I will say that it tastes exactly like the kalua pork I had in Maui. All I need is Aloha Mixed Plate's Guava BBQ sauce recipe and I'm good to go!

The only thing I'd say is that I'd probably shave off an hour's worth of cooking time when I make this again. Mine was still tender and moist, but not as much as I would like. Also, for lack of banana leaves, I rubbed the roast all over with the inside of a couple banana peels. Seemed to do the trick.

Sometimes I use regular salt, sometimes I use no salt. Either way it comes out great! Just serve with macaroni salad and rice!

I bought the Pork Butt that was on sale, and followed this recipe (except I used regular sea salt as I had no Hawaiian). How simple! How yummy! We made the "A Very Popular BBQ Sauce" from this site to go with it. Served it on the side and let people combine to their own tastes. I'm going back to the store to get some more meat... :)

This was DELICIOUS!!  Even with ALL the great reviews, I was a bit skeptical about only 3 ingredients. But this is so flavorful and tender!! I didn't have Hawaiian sea salt, so I used kosher sea salt and it was delicious!  And SO easy, I used a 3 lb roast and let it cook for 12 hrs, and then shredded it(which, really, it shredded itself) and put it back in the cooker with the juices and left it on until dinner(about 4 more hrs).
 Definitely will make again!

This was fantastic! I cut the recipe in half because I was only feeding 3. I used a 3 lb roast and cooked it for 10 hours on low. I couldn't find Hawaiian sea salt so I just used regular sea salt and added a little extra liquid smoke. Served it with Asian slaw and Hawaiian sweet rolls.

Wish I could give this a 10!!! Absolutely AWESOME!!!! 

Especially when adding cabbage during the last hour of cooking...

Even ask my 75 yr old Dad!!  He could have gone to any restaurant he wanted for his 75th birthday, but he requested this lol... 

Even our kids ask me to make this all the time...

Definitely use black sea salt (we add more cause of the cabbage); it adds a better flavor. And we add more liquid smoke for additional flavor; to each his own.  

Awesome dish!!!!

THE BOMB!! I made this for the first time and it was wonderful! I used 5lb pork shoulder butt and followed the rest of the recipe. After 10 hrs it was nearly "falling off the bone" and after 4 more I shredded it and took off all the fat. I also stuck the juice in the freezer for a few minutes so the fat can harden and then I scraped it off and dumped the remaining juice back in the cooker. Definitely use Hawaiian Salt coz it makes a really big difference. It was a hit during dinner and left overs were sandwiched on Hawaiian Buns. Can't wait to make this again. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I cooked the pork all night on low and by morning it was falling apart and smelled/tasted so good! I cut up cabbage and let it cook in the juices as I shredded the pork. Then mixed the pork back in the crockpot with the cabbage. It smells devine! Im letting the cabbage cook down a bit before I eat it for supper. I will be serving this the traditional way with sticky rice. I'm sure it will be as amazing as it smells :)

Fantastic! My search for Hawaiin Salt was difficult but worth it; I initally thought everyone complaining about the salt-content were wimps, but they're not.  It IS salty, and I would reccomend using only 1/2 to 3/4 of the amount suggested.  I used a pork picnic b/c the store didn't have a butt.  Cooked on high for the first 4 hours (started at 7AM) and then to low for the remainder of the day. It was perfect by 7 PM. I have an oval crockpot, I think it's the stone-ware one. Fabulous with Hawaiian rolls!

I have made this several times for large parties and it is always a big hit.  So easy to prepare.  Also makes for easy party prep as I make this ahead of time then just reheat in the slow cooker until serving time.  We always serve this with sandwich rolls and several bbq sauces.

This recipe is delicious. I was in Hawaii on vacation and had Kalua pork many times. This tastes every bit as good. I agree that 1 Tbsp of sea salt is plenty. I have some in the crock pot right now!!! Can't wait. :)

I probably used more than the recommended salt and liquid smoke, but I made at least double the amount and it turned out great! We made it for our small (40 guest) backyard Hawaiian themed wedding and it was pretty much completely gone by the time the groom and I had a chance to sit down and eat. I am making it again this weekend for a football party. Maybe my new husband and I will get some this time! It's so easy to make though and apparently very good! Hope to find that out this coming Sunday.

I loved this recipe, thank you for sharing!  Because I typically have Hawaiian Salt in my kitchen, when I was ready to make it and realized I didn't have any, I ended up using sea salt that I had in a grinder and used the same amount to cover the pork.  I used pork shoulder as well and it tasted like the authentic Kalua Pig you get at Hawaiian food places.  My friend said to add some red chili pepper and minced garlic as well so I'm looking forward to trying it that way the next time.

I thought it was great...I used pork loin...it was lacking a little flavor. The cut mentioned here would fill that need.

My grocery store didn't have Hawaii sea salt so I just used regular sea salt. I followed the recipe as written other than that. It was delicious and a big hit at the baby shower I took it too. I shredded it and made tacos with corn tortillas and salsa verde.

This turned out AWESOME. I didn't have 16 hours so I used country pork strips, adjusted the salt and liquid smoke amount and cooked them on high for 4 hours and 2 hours on low. So delicious! I will definitely cook this again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I have never had much luck with my slow cooker. It's a couple years old and only produced burnt meals.  I set it on the lowest setting and this always happens.  I was very hesitant to make this in the slow cooker, but I tried it anyway.  At five hours in, on low, my 7bl roast was reading 220 degrees!  I hadn't flipped it yet!  So, I flipped it and turned the slow cooker off, it was still very warm.  The flavor is delicious.  I used red Hawaian sea salt from Earth Fare and it wasn't too salty at all!  Very easy, very tasty!

So simple and delicious, great on crusty bread. I drained most of the fat/liquid and add BBQ sauce of your choice.
P.S. I ordered the salt on eBay and really like the flavor, a little bit goes a long way.

Thus was wonderful and incredibly easy!! I used a 6 1/2 pound but roast. It seemed to cook faster than expected. I cooked it for 14 hours. Turning it after 10 hours. I pit the drippings in the freezer and easily scooped the fat off the top. I used the exact suggested ingredients. ( just a little heavy handed on both). Everyone enjoyed this smokey pork. I have a feeling that I will be making this fir myself and others often. Thanks for the recipe

Just made this for the first time tonight and it was fabulous!  I used regular sea salt since I couldn't find the one listed, anyway it turned out great.  I will look for the Hawaiian sea salt the next time so I can try it.  I loved putting the roast in the crock pot before I went to bed and having it ready for dinner the next evening.  The meat was so tender and delicious.  Thanks for the great recipe!

The first time I cooked this I checked it halfway through and it looked and smelled amazing, but I left it cooking for another 10 hours and it burnt to heck! Second try I turned it at the 5 hour mark and it was done after 10 hours - perfect! Definitely needed to be strained though. There was a TON of grease.

AWESOME!!! Change nothing. Please realize before you make this that it is not like a traditional barbecue, (as I thought it might have been) but is a wonderful tasting recipe. I'm amazed at the smoked flavor. It tastes like it just came off of the roasting pit!

This is the easiest recipe ever... I use it for tailgating, potlucks, parties, everything! I usually add more liquid smoke before serving it and it turns out great everytime :) Easy to freeze the leftovers too!

This is unbelievably simple and delicious. Tastes exactly like the Kalua pig from my favorite Hawaiian BBQ restaurant. I made this exactly according to the recipe, and it came out perfect. I served it with rice and spicy Asian slaw. Everyone had seconds. It makes a huge amount, so I used the leftovers to make fried rice the following night. It was equally delicious. I will definitely be making this again and again.

We had Kalua pig on a visit to Hawaii and fell in love. Being in Indiana most of the time, I sought out a recipe and this is EXACTLY what I wanted. We make this for parties, or make it for ourselves and freeze it. It's perfect as is, no recipe modifications here! Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe.

Awesome...just like we had in Maui.  I used Pork Shoulder steaks per my Hawaiian friend.  Also used Sea Salt...still delicious.  I cooked for about 18 hours, you could do it less time w/ the steaks, but either way...not overdone at all and tasted perfectly.  You may want to use a touch more Liquid Smoke than this recipe calls for.  YUM!  Thank you and MAHALO!!

Made it last week and my husband wants me to make it again. he doesn't want to go through the  monthly rotation. I loved it. I served it with  the mashed potato and served the  left-overs with  some buns. It was even better the next day with the buns.

It just doesn't get any more simple than this one.  And boy is it ever tasty.  Has a smoky rich flavor.  I did cut back on the salt and I don't think I missed a thing.  This  got eaten up.  Servied it like NC bbq on buns with a vinegar sauce. MMMMMM

You know what? This tasted just like a pork roast cooked in a slow cooker. It  tasted like unseasoned pork and nothing like a pig that has been cooked in the ground. I had to ad BBQ sauce to salvage this mess.  I guess most of the reviewers have never tasted a real pig roasted in the ground or else they would not have rated this so high.

I couldn't believe how simple this was.  My husband had only had Kalua pig in Hawaii and he said it was almost as good as the real thing!

This was one of the easiest pork roasts I have ever made, and quite possibly one of the most flavorful.  I was a little hesitant about leaving it in the crock pot for 18 hours, but it turned out perfectly.  I would agree with other reviews that it's a good idea to siphon off some of the fat from the juices before putting it all back in the crock pot after shredding the pork.  I ended up adding a touch more sea salt & liquid smoke when i turned the roast at 8:00 am.  I may add a little bit of garlic next time, but was overall very happy with the original recipe.

Excellent, excellent recipe!  I have cooked this several times for family and friends and it has always been a big hit... never a single complaint!  There is usually leftovers which I take and freeze to feed my kids when don't like something else that I have cooked!  I think that this is better than most Kalua pig I have had from an imu, but that is just my opinion.  I always trim some of the fat off before cooking and it is still plenty juicy.

Delicious and easy. My only recommendation is to let it cook for at least the 16-20 hours on the recipe. We thought we cooked too much but it was so good people did not leave the party and they ate until 12:00AM. We liked it more the second day! Use the Hawaiian Sea Salt ...do not skimp! Mahalo

Excellent.  I made it for a luau that my daughter had and I received many compliments on it including one that I consider the biggest from a family friend who was born and raised in Hawaii.  He told me that it tasted like home.

This was great.  I made this for a Luau and everyone loved it. I used a 15 pound piece of pork and used a Nesco type cooker since there was no way it would fit into a standard crock pot.  The salt was the hardest thing to find, but I found it at Whole Foods.

Comfort food made easy! After shredding we cook in a pan with sliced cabbage and some of the liquid from the crockpot to help the cabbage cook down. Season with shoyu and pepper and serve with white sticky rice. Just like being back in Hawaii!

I had a crazy week; I had planned a luau for a month for 18 people and ended up having to move unexpectedly. This recipe was so good and so easy to make. I made it with the Hawaiian Slaw recipe on this site and the Island Kielbasa. I read the reviews and suggestions and follwed them; I added cabbage about an hour before serving and after I shredded the pork. It was so good!

Made it for the first time over the weekend and it was excellent!!  After reading the reviews, I too bought the Red Hawaiian Sea Salt online and reduced the salt to 1 tbsp.  I cooked a 6lb roast on low for 20hrs, turning once.  About an hour before it was finished, I removed the meat, shredded it, returned it to the crock pot and added a half head of roughly chopped cabbage until it was cooked.  Served it over rice... perfect!  Everyone loved it and I will definitely be making this again.

OMG! GOOOOD! i've never had the real thing but if this is anywhere close to it then i'm moving to hawaii tomorrow! lol. I'm not crock pot profecient so i didnt know what to do about it just sitting in there liquidless, so i added a cup of water. I aslo took another reviewers suggestion and added a banana about half way through. So juicy, so delicious. My brother said it smelled like fart. If thats teh case then fart smells delicious, lol.  Thanks for the recipe. Totally worth chasing down hawaiian sea salt for.

This is soooo easy to cook.  I had to use kosher sea salt instead of Hawaiian sea salt (only because I didn't have any on hand) and it tasted great.  I still want to try it with the Hawaiin salt but I couldn't imagine it being better!!!!

This is the first time I have ever had Kalua Pig. I bought a 7.31lb. Pork Roast. I had to order the Hawaiian Sea Salt from online. I ordered the Red Sea Salt.  I used the ingredients as posted, cooked it on low for 14 hours. The meat was tender, juicey and falling off the bone. My husband said it was fabulous but a tad salty.  Cooking with a slow cooker always intensifies the flavors.  I am not suppose to have salt, it was a little salty for me, but still great. It isn't something that I eat everyday, so I will deal with it. I will make this again many times.

DW and I tried this last night for dinner and OMG was it good. We used plain ground sea salt and we added the head of cabbage 2 hours before dinner. We took grands biscuits and halved them and pt the pork mixture on top, WOW was it good.

I cooked this recipe outside so that the smell of the smoke would not remain in the house. I followed the directions and the meat was tender and tasted great. I added cabbage about the last hour of cooking the second time making this.

I made this not ever having tasted Kalua Pig, and never having made pulled pork. It was great! I used a pork shoulder roast and cooked it for the required 20 hours on low ... the meat was juicy and tasty. Somewhat salty, but I liked it that way. I served it as is with mashed potatoes and cornbread, and then combined with BBQ sauce the next day to make sandwiches. Yum! I was able to find the Red Hawaiian Sea Salt online and I think it does make a difference. The Liquid Smoke is a must.

This was great and just as other reviewed, tender and juicy.  I used a 5.8lb of Pork shoulder and rubbed it with sea salt and liquid smoke just as described.  I put it in the slow cooker at 7:45am on high and went to put it on low at 2:30pm and it was falling off the bone!  I rotated the meat and turned the slow cooker to low and let it seep in the juices for another couple of hours.  Absolutely wonderful.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I was concerned with the fact there was no liquid. But it was fine. The entire family LOVED this.  They didn't use bbq sauce or anything, just put it on the Hawaiian rolls as others suggested.  I only had to cook it for 12 hrs and after about 10 I pulled it out, shredded it and put it back in the juices on low.

Made this for a luau-themed potluck at work, and it was a huge hit.  Tender, juicy, smoke-y - just wonderful.  Served on hamburger buns, and let people use BBQ sauce (if they wanted).

The only thing I changed with this recipe is I pierced the meat 5 times and added whole garlic cloves in those holes. With that being said, this recipe is so simple is ridiculous, but so good. What makes it for me is the juice. We tried it plain, with the juice, on a bun with cheese, bbq the next day, and even on a pizza. Wonderful, this is going to be used as a base for almost all of my pork now. Thank you for sharing.

It sounds very good and something I would like to try.  I would like to suggest that the temperature setting for the slow cooker be added to the recipe. I saw what one rater used and will use that as a starting point.  Thanks.

Very tender and juicy, but the flavor was nothing spectacular.

I will admit I was leary to cook something for so long in the Slow Cooker. But I'm glad I tried this recipe. The pork came out very tender and so juicy! My husband, who really could care less about pork, raved and raved about the meat. I too used regular sea salt because that's all I had. I will look for Hawaiian every chance I get so that I can make this true to form. I use mesquite flavored liquid smoke and don't think I'd use any other flavor for this but the mesquite! I didn't shred this, instead my hubs sliced it and we ate like any other roast. Thanks for the great recipe, I can't wait to make it again!

We absolutely loved this.  Apparently this is a popular dish in Hawaii where my boyfriend lived for a few years and spent countless dollars on this plate.  He said this one was better! ?

My husband LOVED this recipe.  I stuffed a 7 1/2lb pork butt in my crock pot.  I thought I would have trouble turning it over.  I put it in at midnight and tried to flip it the next morning.  There was no flipping involved.  It feel right off the bone.  I did add a little more liquid smoke in the morning.   We had pulled pork sandwiches the next day for lunch and my husband is taking some to a potluck tomorrow.

Simply amazing the house smelled so good and this was all gone in a day.  The smoky taste was unmatched for such an easy recipe.  Everyone should try this at least once.  In our house it will make the monthly rotation.

I just made this for Superbowl and Everyone LOVED it!.. It's so easy too...   I cooked about 20 lbs (Superbowl.. LOTS OF PEOPLE) and kept the pork but in the slow cooker for about 10 hours I don't think the full 20 hours is needed.  I had to do two batches b/c there was so much meat.   The kalua pig was eaten on top of rice w/ cabbage and we also made a big thing of kalua pig nachos. HUGE SUCCESS! My roommate is from Hawaii and all his Hawaii friends were coming up to me and telling me how good it was. Great recipe!

Yum-ee-licious!  so easy and perfect for dinner parties.  i almost feel guilty that i did not have to work hard to make a delicious meal.  i substituted pork shoulder in place of pork butt.

I made this for a luau-themed party and it was very well received. I just used regular sea salt. I also made one at the same time on my BBQ using smoke chips and a water pan for steam. Then I asked everyone which they preferred. About 50-50 liked the slow cooker one better. It was so much easier to do it in the slow cooker that that's what I'm doing for the superbowl tomorrow. I'm adding a little less liquid smoke this time. We'll see how it comes out.

This was AWESOME!!! I love the flavor and it is sooo simple. I could not find the hawiian sea salt and used coarse sea salt and it was still good, but can not wait to try it with the hawiian.

I have made this many times and had it turn out perfectly using just generic sea salt. Then I made a special effort to seek out Hawaiian sea salt. I put the same amount of salt on the meat as usual but it was so salty! So I am going back to the regular sea salt (don't know why it would be different). I love this recipe! Just go a little easy on the salt if you use the Hawaiian, it's easy to add more, not much you can do if it's too salty. Wonderful recipe though.

I made this for a New Year Eve,s party, and added the Kalua Pork to my rice wrapper spring rolls. Yummy! I have tasted pig done in a pit, on a spit, and this was very hard to tell it was NOT cooked the pit way! Wow, great recipe, and the kitchen smells sooo good, it's hard to wait for the finished product! Makes great sandwiches too! This is a must try for anyone who loves the smokey flavor, and the pulled pork texture.

All I can say is wow.  I was very skeptical to try this but after reading review after review about how great this was, I had to try it.  Just like what you would get on a plate lunch on the islands.  I will make this again and again.

This was exceptional! I didn't think it'd be THAT good considering it was pork, salt, liquid smoke. But I let it cook for 21 hours and it was fall-apart-in-your-mouth good!  I did use hawaiian red sea salt (we had a hawaiian themed dinner so it was fitting) and I think i put a tad too much in, as the pork being too salty was the only complaint.   Was great the next day heated up and put on some sweet rolls! :)

Absolutely wonderful!! I am not a big fan of fresh pork, but this recipe has converted me.  I used a 7lb roast (bone-in), and it was fall-off-the-bone-tender in 12 hours. I took it out to cool before shredding and poured the liquid into a bowl which was placed in the freezer to separate and cool.  Shredded the pork, removed areas of fat and separated half for a later meal.  Then took the cooled liquid out of the freezer, removed/discarded the hardened fat on top and put the juices back into the crockpot. Shredded some cabbage and placed that in the cooker, topping it with the shredded pork.  Cooked on low for another hour, or until the cabbage was softened. I did have to add some hot pepper seasoning to spice it up a little since I added the cabbage. Served over steamed rice. Very yum! Thank you for the recipe Kikuchan!

Simply delicious, moist, and tasty given so few ingredients.  We lived in Hawaii and enjoyed so much of the delicious local fare and truly this recipe is nearly exactly as I remember Kalua Pig.  This recipe is meant to be very tasty with a smoky flavor.  I used Alea Hawaiian sea salt and the liquid smoke exactly as stated in the recipe.  My pork was done in the crock pot on low at 10 hours.  I easily shredded the pork with a fork and poured the drippings over the finished product.  Just yummy!  Even my five year old boys loved this!  I will be serving this with the Chicken Long Rice and Chocolate Haupia Pie recipes featured on this site.  If only I had Lomilomi salmon and pipikaula!  Mahalo for posting this wonderful recipe!!  I will definitely be making this one again!

Great recipe, best I've had since leaving Hawaii.  I've made this a half dozen times and it is allways good, I did wrap the roast in banana leaves like the real kalua pig, and it adds a unique flavor.

I went to Trader Joe's to find Hawaiian sea salt, with no luck.  They discontinued the black salt and of course were out of the red salt.  I used 1 tbsp. regular sea salt and 1 tbsp. liquid smoke and a 5 lb. boneless pork roast.  I set the slow cooker to low and it was done in 10 hours.  I tried to turn it at about 6 hours and it fell apart in the tongs, very tender!  At 10 hours, all I had to do was give it a stir and the meat just shredded itself.  The pork was absolutely delicious!  I will definitly make it again.

This was excellent. Because of some of the reviews I read, I didn't use the full amount of liquid smoke. In the future, I will. We like a smokier flavor. I did add a Bannana leaf wrap around the roast prior to placing it in the slow cooker. That added a more authentic flavor,according to my husband who lived in Hawaii. Will make again.

WOW!  This is awesome!  I can't believe how something so simple can taste SO good!  This will become a regular in my house.  I couldn't find Hawaiian sea salt, but the plain old regular sea salt apparently works just fine, cause I can't imagine it tasting better than it did tonight!

Made it twice now and came out perfect both times! Definitely use Alaean Red Sea salt if you can find it. I also reccomend the hickory liquid smoke. After only 10 hours (half way done) it was so tender the bone slipped out when flipping it over in the crock. Serve with some medium grain rice, and you're having your own taste of the islands at home!

I used a 6# pork shoulder roast & followed the recipe exactly. (I found the pink Hawaiian sea salt at Whole Foods) I put it on at 9:30 p.m. & by 10:00 a.m. the next morning the meat was falling apart. It was a big hit with the whole family & I will definitely fix it again.

This turned out really great. I modified the recipe and added half a cup of soy sauce, chopped ginger and garlic. I used garlic sea salt and it smelled wonderful. I used a pork shoulder roast and turned on the crock pot in the morning before leaving for work, it smelled awesome coming home to this for dinner.

I also placed whole bananas with the skin on top of the roast which came from a previous recipe I used.  This is so delicious.

Made this recipe for a cookout on Sunday and it turned out amazing. I was a little afraid of the saltiness that some reviewers talked about because I dislike salty foods but I was very happy when it was finally done and shredded and was so amazing, not to salty or smoke tasting. Shredding it was so easy it just fell apart on its own, just have to help it along. I served this with the Vinegar based BBQ sauce also in ALLRecipes and people were almost drinking it. I suggest pairing them all the time.

Wow.  Incredibly delicious.  Almost addictive.  Couldn't be more simple.  I didn't read the recipe carefully enough, so I didn't have Hawaiian sea salt, only regular sea salt.  With the substitution, it came out just a tad salty.  Will try Hawaiian sea salt next time.

easy peasy to make, and perfect for large crowds!  make sure you let the pork cook long enough to get tender.  maybe it's just me, but I didn't know that slow cookers help make tough meats get tender.  :)

So 'ono! We're so glad we can get a taste of home now that we've moved to Texas. It's always a treat to make kalua pig and have our own little luau at home. This recipe is spot on!!

This is an excellent recipe. We had this for dinner last night and it was perfect! I did tweak the recipe a little by adding 2Tbl of the liquid smoke and only 1Tbl of salt. I served it on a whole wheat bun with braised cabbage and little BBQ sauce.

I have never made or had Kalua Pork before.  I must admit that I thought it was too easy to be good.  IT WAS GREAT!  I served it with a variety of BBQ sauces and onion,pickle and mustard.  It is also great plain.  Moist and tasty!  Thanks!!!

Not quite the same as in an imu but close. Upped the liquid smoke a bit and put it on high for about 7 hours (actually forgot about while doing errands) in the morning and then put on low until dinner. Served with Chicken Long Rice and Poi.

I made this for a 50th wedding anniversary luau. It was amazing! I used the red Hawaiian salt with mesquite liquid smoke. We also set out 4 different types of bbq sauce and Hawaiian rolls for sandwiches. It was a big hit! We did the 6 pounds for 16 hours. I was afraid the time might be too long but the meat was incredibly tender, moist and tasty. I also drained the meat, pulled the fat from the top and returned the juices to the crock pot. We served it along with marinated chicken kabobs. There was plenty for 35 people and just enough left overs for dinner the next day, which made my family very happy!

I really love this recipe.  I had been planning on trying it for awhile, but I just now got around to it.  It is really good.  I did cook it for over 16 hours, but less probably would have been alright.  I used regular sea salt (I went to three stores even specialty ones and I couldn't find hawaiian).  We served it as sandwiches with some BBQ sauce on top.  I prefer this recipe over typical pulled pork recipes where the pork sits in the BBQ sauce.  This has a great flavor even without BBQ sauce and then you can just add the amount that you want instead of having it drenched.  I definitely recommend this recipe!

The pork was tender and juicy, but the flavor was adequate at best.  The smell of the pork/liquid smoke combo was quite offputting.  I don't think I'll be making this again - there are better recipes out there.

This seemed like it would take way too long.  I cooked it as described but only for 12 hours as the smell was way too enticing for my family to resist any longer.  It was excellent.  I did use the hawaiian sea salt.  I had a lot left over so will have several meals ahead.  I froze the leftovers.  This is good meat.

I have been using the same Kahlua Pig recipe for 10 years now. I decided to give this one a try. I wish I had stuck to old faithful. It lacked flavor so in the last few hours of cooking I had to add garlic and fresh ginger. It save the whole roast.

ARE THERE MORE STARS available somewhere.  This was super delicious. I don't usually cook this cut of pork because it's sometimes fatty, but the long slow cooking was perfect.  It melts the fat and leaves a very tender, juicy roast.  The only changes I made to the recipe was to rub garlic and onion powders along with the Hawaiian salt into the pork.  I can't recommend this highly enough.  DH is loving it!!!

I've been using this exact, simple recipe for kalua pig in slow cooker for years. It's a superbowl tradition at our place. I always serve it with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce on the side & Kaiser rolls.  Half choose to eat it plain,though, which is testament to it's juicy delicious flavor.  You'll discover the moist rich leftover pork isn't just for sammies....Roll up with moterey jack cheese, green taco sauce & sour cream in flour tortillas, for example.  Throw it into salad or with ginger in stir fry. Be brave, you can't make it taste bad!!!

I thought this was good and so did DH.  I used 2.5 lbs. for just 2 of us and halfed the salt & smoke, but should have cut down even more as was quite salty (and I am a fan).  I put in a 8 am on low and we ate around 6 pm.  I shredded a bit before serving and kept warm in crockpot.  I made w/ some Hawaiian Sweet Rolls to make sandwiches with, but think I would prefer over rice w/ the rolls on the side.  Added a bit of water to make it more brothy.

This is simple enough to make, smells great cooking, but was way too salty for any of us to really enjoy. I read other's suggestions to help with the saltiness, but we still found it to be too much.  I haven't given up on this recipe though because I know it can be good with some tweaking.

Loved it!!  I used a 4.5 lb pork butt so I dialed down the salt and liquid smoke just a little.  I used Sicilian sea salt but will eventually get the Hawaiian to try it as well.  Cooked overnight for 12 hours.  Removed the already falling apart roast from the crock and removed the bones and remaining chunks of fat.  I also poured the liquid off and skimmed most of the fat off. Added the cooking liquid and shredded roast back to crock and let it cook on low for another couple hours.  This was very very good.  I put BBQ sauce out in case people wanted it but it was just fine without...salty and smokey.  I will definitely make it again.  Also, I would suggest that people really look for the pork butt cut.  While it is very fatty it lends itself perfectly to cooking for such a long time and turned out very tender.  Not to mention it's a cheap cut.  You're removing most of the fat anyways.

Wonderful recipe. I am originally from Hawaii and love to make recipes from the islands. This is not exactly the same as Kalua pork done properly in a dug pit, but it is close enough. My husband loved it! The liquid smoke added just the right flavor to the recipe.

I made this for my firend's Hawaii themed bachelorette party and it was the first thing to go. So juicy and tender, yum. I am making it again for my family tonight so I decided to finally give it a much deserved rave review. Oh I mixed Head Country BBQ sauce in it after I saw people putting it in their sandwiched and it was oh so good!! Great either way.

This is soo delicious.  I used a 5.5 lb pork butt, started it at 12am and it was fork tender by 3pm. Probably sooner but that is when I checked it.  I defatted the juice, shredded the pork and stuck it back in for a few more hours as dinner wasn't for awhile.  It could have been eaten then and there though.  Will have to adjust the timing better next time.  Instruction are so easy but used kosher salt instead of hawaiian sea salt as that is all i had.  Use gloves when you apply the liquid smoke.  I didn't and my hands still smell like BBQ coals and I have washed it numerous times to try and get the smell off.  I did place an onion sliced on the bottom which don't know if that added much flavor or not.  Cooked up some cabbage and served with white rice and egg.  Thanks so much for a great easy slow cooker recipe.

This pork is absolutely amazing!!! I have made it for several parties and it is always well received.  I use kosher salt instead of the hawaiian sea salt called for.  After having made it a number of times I always add extra liquid smoke and a bit more kosher salt for taste preference.

This was delish!  I made this for my daughter's B-Day party (a Luau) and everyone raved.  Also, if you have leftovers it makes for a great pulled pork sandwich.  Just mix in your favorite BBQ sauce and serve on a bun!

Simply 'ono'!  I used half Salish alder smoked salt and half alaea (Hawaiian pink sea salt) for the recipe and it worked marvelous!

Thanks for sharing!

Count me with those that loved this recipe.  So simple.  I used regular sea salt as the Hawaiian sea salt I found in the gourmet section was way too expensive.  I then used the meat to make a mexican casserole and it was delicious.  Was hard to leave the meat alone until time to make the casserole.  I kept wanting to sample it.

I made this a couple times while living in Hawaii and my husband and family said it was better than what they had at the luau. I used the white hawaiian rock salt, never saw any red or black there. Also one time i substitued apple cider for water and turned out good, i would say cut down on the salt though. But tore apart easily and very yummy! Goes great with rice or glass noodles and haupia if you can get some.

This was great.  My friend who normally does not eat pork, could not believe the taste of it and said she would eat it again and again.  So my next potluck, Kalua Pig is on its way.

If only there were 10 stars! This is the best recipe on this site. I could not beleive how juicy and tender it was. Follow others suggestions and seperate the fat after cooking. It really made this great!

My husband grew up in Hawaii and his parents would make this all the time - It's delicious!!!  They would serve it with scrambled eggs mixed with the pork and rice on the side and we would pour ketchup over the whole meal and be in heaven while we ate.  :-)

DELICIOUS. My boyfriend and his mom couldn't believe the minimal ingredients used to make this. I got red hawaiian sea salt at Trader Joes, and used twice what the recipe called for in Hickory Liquid smoke. I cooked on low for about 19 hours and it just fell apart when it was done. SOO good.

Since I found this recipe we have made it almost every week.  It is economical and YUMMY!  I never searched for the special salt.  I have used Kosher salt and Smoked Sea Salt and both worked fine.  Just throw the ingredients in and 8 or 9 hours later it is ready!  A few tips:  Don't add water!  Turn the roast over frequently.  Separate the fat or it is too greasy.  Put this on a sweet Hawaiian bread to compliment to salty, smoky flavor of the meat(buns work better because the meat makes the sliced bread too soggy).   Make it for a crowd.  Freeze any extra in the juice and eat it soon.  ENJOY!!!!!

Made this for our "Luau" dinner party last night...it was delicous!  I made it exactly as the recipe states and cooked it for about 19 hours in the crock pot.  It was SO tender and juicy and had a great flavor.  

We served it with onion rolls and Aunty Lilikoi mustard.  Everyone was asking for the recipe!

Completly wonderful! This was easy, EASY to make, and was so good.  I had a 4 lb butt roast and only cooked it for 12 hours.. it was falling apart and I wasn't brave enough to continue with the recommended cooking time.  But still, at 12 hours you have to plan ahead.  This pork is worth the wait.  I served it with Ono Butter Mochi and Pani Popo (both found on this site).  Wonderful!

I used a 3.25 lb. roast since this was all my grocery store had, and i decreased the other ingredients accordingly.  I couldn't find the hawaiian salt, so i used regular sea salt. After cooking for about 20 hours, I shredded it and used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  This was better pork BBQ than we get at our favorite BBQ restaurant, and it couldn't be easier to make!

Wow!  This was a great find.  I haven't eaten the real thing from Hawaii, but it must be heaven.  I cooked it on high for 7 hours and it was so tender and moist.  I used the hickory flavor liquid smoke and added a little more than the recipe called for.  I couldn't find the Hawaiian sea salt at the store so I just used regular sea salt.  My 5-year-old ate it with no complaints, so kudos to the OP!  I had so much left over that I took half and added bbq sauce and the other half I seasoned with Mexican seasonings for pork burritos.  Both were delicious!!

Oh my GOSH this was yummy! I made it as directed only added way more liquid smoke.  I used Kosher sea salt because it's what I had.  When it was cooked, in less time than it said, I removed it to a plate to cool, then I shredded it.  I Put the DELISIOUS broth in the fridge to separate the fat.  Then added the whole thing back to the Crock pot (or nuke) to re-warm.  My picky 4-year-old loved it too.  We had it, and it's YUMMY juices over rice, but I'll bet it would be great on sour dough rolls too.  Thanks for the GREAT recipe!

Absolutely amazing! I used a 6lb shoulder blade and ended up using a couple tablespoons of the liquid smoke (I used hickory)and an extra tablespoon of sea salt - I also cooked it on high for 5 hours. I put the juices in the freezer so I could skim the fat and then shredded the meat and put everything back into the crockpot to hang out for another 30 minutes. I served it over brown rice and had my homemade teriyaki sauce on the side for anyone who wanted extra sauce. This was heavenly - thanks for the recipe!

This is an option to the slow cooker. Rather than cooking for 16+ hours, I would like to recommed an alternative.  Put the pork in a Reynolds oven cooking bag and follow the directions.  You will have Kalua Pig in about 3 to 5 hours. I've done it and it works great.

So simple yet soooo good!! I make this for our potluck days at work and never have any leftover. I use 1/4 cup of liquid smoke though as I tend to like a little more smokey flavor.

This was really good. I noticed that it wasn't smelling smokey enough for my taste, so I added more liquid smoke to the broth   
at about 10 hrs and ladled it over the pork for the rest of the time. The meat was falling off of the bone at about 12-13 hrs, so I'd say that 16-20 hrs cooking time is unnecessary.

Wow, was this good!  I took the advice of a few other reviewers and used the fast cook method, 6 hours on high, and it turned out as tender as when I have made pork roasts on low for 8-12 hours.  The meat was falling right off the bone.  Not sure that cooking this on low for 16-20 hours is really necessary, unless it imparts more smokiness to the meat?  I added 1/4 cup of hot water, and about an extra tsp of liquid hickory smoke to the broth halfway during cooking, just to make sure there was enough moisture and smokey flavor.  It was absolutely perfect.  I will be making this the next time we tailgate or attend a pot luck.  I served it on rolls, with coleslaw on top.  Just delicious, and so easy to make.  Five stars indeed!!

I didn't have the Hawaiian sea salt, so I used La Baleine.  I shredded the pork, added Bourbon Whiskey BBQ sauce (from this site) and heated through.  I served it on fresh Kaiser rolls with a side salad.  Easy to make, and really tasty!

Wasn't sure what to expect as i have never benn to hawaii - but it was a good day to try it with our temperatures showing 30 below with windchill! I put this in the crockpot early morning went to work and came back to a wonderful smell - i used a 3.5 pork butt roast and went a little light on the liquid smoke as i did not want to overpower - it was perfect - the smoke came thru vey nice and the liquid left was tasty- my husband and son loved it couldn't believe something so simple could tast so good

Delightfully easy! I forgot to poke the pork before I poured on the liquid smoke, but it still came through nicely. I served it as open-faced sandwiches over French brioche with the Mustard Based BBQ sauce from this site. Oh, so yummy! Versatile recipe that I will definitely make again.

Amazing.  I was born and raised in Hawaii and have steered away from any "traditional Hawaiian food" in California restaurants because it's never quite right.  I was skeptical, but I figured that I'd give it a try because of it's rave reviews and I was glad I did.  It was a huge hit at the Superbowl party I brought it to.  I would add a tad more salt and liquid smoke as mentioned in other reviews just for a stronger flavor.  I am excited because this is a meal that feeds a group for UNDER $20.00!! Just at rice and Shoyu and you are good to go.  There will never be an exact substitute for the kalua pig from an imu, but this is a great solution for people without that option...Happy Cooking!!

***Onolicious*** This was so easy and tasted great. The only change I had to make was to use a different salt as Hawaiian salt is unavailable here. I used the one and only sea salt I could find (I live in a very small town), it still brought back childhood memories of kalua pig with my family in Hawaii...mahalo for this very tasty and easy recipe.

We love this recipe, it's just as good as what we had in Hawaii. A good substitue for the Hawaiian salt can be made by grinding fresh garlic, fresh ginger, and green onions in a food processor with kosher salt.

This was phenomenal. I made the pork exactly as recommended but I used a 4.5lb sirloin pork roast and cooked it on high for about 10 hours.  I pulled the roast out and shredded it, put it back in the crock pot along with half a head of shredded green cabbage and 1tsp. of jalapeno salt.  I then cooked that on low for about 2 hours.  My family simply adored it! So easy, filling, and yummy.  What more can you ask?!

Never thought I could have a taste of home made in a crock pot! Can't get simpler than this! Can't believe how close the flavor is to real kalua pig. Great recipe!

We made this pork yesterday and it is without a doubt one the best recipes we've tried in a long time!  I too, was not able to find the Hawaiian Sea Salt so we used just regular course sea salt.  I will; however, take the time to find the other for our next Kalua Pig.......which I believe will be very soon!  This is a recipe we'll be using for years!  Thanks, Kay for shaing it!!!

Fantastic.  My husband requests this all the time.  We usually toss leftoevers in BBQ sauce and have pulled pork sandwiches.  This also freezes well in a foodsaver.

I mad this for our office Turkey Day pot luck.  I used 2-3lb boneless pork butts.  Started it the night before and my wife wasn't too thrilled with the smell.  But it came out soooo tender and I didn't have any to bring home :-(     So I get to make it again ... as far as pot lucks go  ... this is too easy!!  And comes out  great.  I am going to throw in some cabbage next time like one of the other reviewers did.  Oh, I also drained off the liquid and stuck it in the freezer to get rid of some of the fat.  Good easy recipe!!!

So delicious and dead easy.  I couldn't find hawaiian sea salt anywhere, so I just used regular sea salt and halved the amount because I don't like my food very salty.  It was perfect.  After shredding the pork I put it back in the crockpot with the drippings for a while, and that made it so moist and tasty.  I'll be making this over and over again.

This recipe is so amazingly simple, but yet so amazingly delicious at the same time!  I couldn't find the Hawaiian sea salt, but kosher salt worked just fine.  I'll definitely make this again...and again!

Great receipe.  Used the left over pork and made a traditional kalua pig and cabbage dish.  Easy to make just heat pork in a pot and add cabbage with a little bit of water and let it steam.  Mix the cabbage and pork together and serve with steamed rice.

I just got back from Hawaii and had to try to make Kalua pig myself.  This was the ticket.  It came out perfect.  We had it with rice the first night and made tacos with the leftovers.  My family is already asking for it again.  YUM!

I wish I could give this more than 5 stars!  WOW this is the best recipe.  I used a little less salt than called for, and I used very cheep cut of pork, and you would never know that it wasn't an expensive cut.  It was flavorful and moist.  It was great as is, but it also was great as leftovers in enchiladas and pulled pork bbq. The leftovers also freeze well, so buy a lot and freeze the extra for another day.  Thanks for a great recipe.  Its a keeper!

This recipe was a huge hit at my most recent dinner party.  I had to stop cooking at about 12-14 hours because the roast was clearly done.   I put the whole pot in the fridge to let the fat solidify so I could easily remove it.  Then I just plugged the crock pot back in about 90 minutes before my guests arrived to warm the meat.  I like to serve this on Hawaiian bread with BBQ sauce on the side.  You don't need very much sauce because the meat has such great flavor on its own.  I will surely make this easy recipe again and again!

I live in Hawaii and I have to say that this is right up there with the lua version.  I used an almost 8 lb roast and adjusted the measurements accordingly.  I let cook for about 18 hours.  It may have been a large roast but not a scrap was spared!!

I made this for my daughter's 5th birthday luau party and it was wonderful!  Tweaked the seasoning a bit; 1 1/2 tsp liquid smoke with 2 1/4 tsp sea salt for each 3lbs. of pork.  I used part pork butt roast and part pork sirloin cuts (based on a recommendation from my butcher). I preferred the texture of the pork sirloin cuts, but since they are leaner cuts, I did add some water (maybe 3/4-1 cup) to the bottom of my roaster.  Cooked at 275-300 deg for 5 hours, shredded into the juice and kept warm.  YUMMMM!

This is an easy recipe that everyone will rave over! I cook this overnight for potlucks that we have (often) at work and I very rarely find anything left over. I've also changed it up slightly by cooking as directed, but adding Hawaiian bar-b-que sauce about an hour or so before serving. Slap that on Hawaiian rolls with some coleslaw made with pineapple and you've got a yummy twist to an already perfect recipe!

Let me start by thanking ILove2Ck for recommending this recipe. When I read it and saw the second step that says "Cover....", I thought, "Cover with what?". I could just see the headlines, "Hunk of Meat Challenged Cook Finally Kills Family ith Her Cooking. Even Distroyed The House." I thought, I am going to burn the house down. But I did as I was told and didn't cover the meat with anything except Kosher salt, liguid smoke and the slow cooker cover. WOW, this was great and I didn't burn the house down!!! I didn't kill the family, instead they gobbled the meat up with great joy. I served with the Honey Wheat Sandwich Rolls, also on this site, and cole slaw. I did have BBQ sauce in a bowl for those who wanted it, my daughter thought it was fantastic plain. A definite keeper, THANKS!!!

Delicious!  I used 5# pork, added 1/2 c. water and doubled the salt and liquid smoke.  It was too bland without it.  The cook time on low was 17 hours. Oh so Ono!!  It brok da mouth.  Served it with sticky rice--of course and fried cabbage.  Thanks

This was totally melt in your mouth great, but it was too salty for our taste.  We used Trader Joe's Hawaiian Black Sea Salt and it was soo salty we couldn't finish the meat and our teeth were squeaking.  I will try again tomorrow with less salt because it was delicious.

This is awesome. I used pork sirloins since they were on sale and red Hawaiian sea salt I found on eBay.I don't usually care for pork because it can have a strong taste but this is excellent. It's so good I'm making this into sandwiches for my son's graduation party.

This is soooo easy.  My 2 guests ate three helpings!  I got a 6 pound butt roast and it was done in about 13 hours.  I used red hawaiian sea salt from Trader Joes.  I felt like it maybe needed one more spice, but I'm not sure what one.  As another user suggested, I served this with "Suzy's mashed red potatoes", and the guests ate 3 helpings of that too!  Thanks for a great, very easy recipe.

wow...doesn't get any easier than this!!  I used regular kosher salt b/c I can't find Hawaiian salt.  I think even more liquid smoke would be good.  I did have to drain some of the liquid it was cooking in, as it appeared to be boiling in the drippings.  I cooked a 5 1/2 lb roast for 11 hrs and it's as tender as tissue paper.

My husband really liked this.  We didn't use the Hawaiian salt because we couldn't find any, but regular salt was just fine.  We mixed this with red beans and rice and it was VERY good.  Highly recommended and very easy to make.

This pork was delicious! We lived in Hawaii for 3 yrs. and went to many luau's and restaraunts and this pork tasted almost exactly like the kahlua pork there! I only cooked it for about 14 hrs. with a 6 lb. bone in pork butt and it was still falling apart.  I did add a bit more liquid smoke half way through. Great recipe!

This was sooooo good! The only thing that was a little off was 20 hours being too long of a cook time. It was a little dried out on the edges of the roast, but the inside was soooo tender and just fell apart. I loved it just by the forkfull or on a bun and my husband wanted a little barbeque sauce so I made him somthing like a pulled pork sandwich. His exact words "You really made my day with this one, puppy".

I prepared this for 50 people last month at a Hawaiian night.  It came out juicy and moist.  I did brown the pork before adding to the slow cooker, then brown sliced Maui onions and added those to the pork.  Served with sliced hot peppers and Hawaiian Sweet and Sour Sauce.  Everyone wanted leftovers to take home.

This is SO wonderful!  I impressed my father-in-law who had lived in Hawaii for a while.  The entire time it was cooking, he kept saying, *You can't have Kalua Pork without banana leaves...you can't have Kalua Pork without poi, etc...* He took one bite of this and stopped talking!  Take time to find the Red Sea salt...it makes all the difference.

Best barbque sandwiches ever.  Easy, versitle, a keeper.  Could not find Hawaiian salt, I used a brand called Pacific sea salt but I was happy with the results.  If your after more of a Hawaiian theme, get the right salt, though.

Oh my goodness!  This couldn't be easier, but is far more than the sum of its parts.  The cut of pork used is fatty, and all that fat melts, doing something magical to the meat.  OK, it's not health food (unless you're a low-carber), but if you love the taste of pork, this is the recipe for you.

This is one of my favorite recipes.  I actually like my kahlua pork better than some of the luaus I've been to.  Just make sure you don't use TOO lean a piece of meat.  When I was on a weight loss kick I tried this with pork sirloin and it didn't turn out nearly as great.  I've used just about every other pork roast with amazing results.
If you have tons of leftovers like I always do, try rolling the extra pork into taquitos (that one got rave reviews)and serve with salsa, sour cream and guacamole, or add some barbecue sauce and a couple ounces of beef or chicken broth, reheat, and serve on buns or rolls for pulled pork sandwiches.  It's leftovers without anyone knowing they're leftovers!

This was so easy and good! I made little sandwiches with sweet Hawaiian bread rolls mixing in BBQ sauce into the meat after I shredded it yummmy.  I also could not find the Hawaiian sea salt so I use the sea salt I had and it turned out GREAT!

This was a very good, VERY easy recipe! After reading reviews, I decided to use only 1 tablespoon of sea salt (that's what I had on hand) and do 1 1/2 tablespoons of Liquid Smoke.  The smokiness was perfect, could have added more but wanted to be able to use the shredded pork in various recipes.  However, it did need a little more salt.  Maybe sea salt isn't as salty as regular?  I'll be hunting for Hawaiian Salt specifically for the next time just to taste the difference.  I cooked a pork loin roast that was just under 6 lbs and after 14 hours it just fell apart.  Will not do such a large roast next time.  But great recipe, thanks!

Very yummy and reminiscent of our Hawaiian Luaus.  I served it with both rice and tortillas (and burrito fixins) so my guests had the option.  Burritos were a big hit, but everyone liked the meat by itself as well.  I did buy the special ingredients and followed the recipe exactly (except adjustments for a smaller roast).

The meat was tender but really salty.  I realize you're supposed to use Poi or something similar to blend with it and cut the salt, but for those of us wary of the scarey purple paste it might be a little over-strong.

If I could give this meal 10 STARS I would!!  After we enjoyed this for dinner last night my husband said that we should have this every week, because it is so addictive.  I use coarse sea salt and it worked fine.  One of the best reipes I have found on this site.  (And I have found quite a few keepers here)  Just make sure you have extra napkins on the table.  I think I'll go heat up some of last night's left overs for lunch and I am not usually a left over eater.

Really good! I think next time I will try a different cut of meat, I did not care for the thick skin like layer of fat on the out side of this cut and struggled with cutting it off.

I tried this because of all the great reviews.  I cooked a boston butt for 12 hours and it fell off the bone. We are having it for dinner tonight.  But the couple of tastes that my husband and I had while I was shredding the meat were so yummy. Great smokey flavor. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was incredibly easy and tasty too!  Served on potato buns with barbeque sauce and was the hit of our family reunion.  Everyone wanted the recipe - even those who don't cook!  Thank you for the posting ... and all of the prior ratings to convince me to try this.  Enjoy!

A little too greasy, but very tasty!  Used regular salt with no problems.  Make sure to cook for entire time so the juice (fat..lol) will absorb into the meat.  Next time I will trim off maybe 1/4 off the fat before cooking.

I used pork loin, running around at the last minute and couldn't find a pork butt.  It was wonderful, everyone loved the smoke flavor.  I served it on rolls.  Delicious !

Easy recipe. Fantastic results. Turned out very moist and tender. Couldnt stop snacking on it. Never been to a luau, so I cant compare. However, I would not complain if luau pig turned out like this (ok I would complain because I would have wasted my money). Great for making "cuban sandwiches". Goes into the "good recipes" folder (the "bad recipes" folder gets picked up every monday morning).

Some Notes: 
Used Kosher Salt. Came out a bit salty. Next time I will cut back by 1/2 Tbs.

Used 2 Tbs hickory liquid smoke. Didnt have much of a smoky flavor. However, I dont know that I would add much more in fear that it might make the dish bitter tasting.

Cooked 12 hours. Still turned out tender (I have a Rival 5.5 quart crock pot).

I tried this and both my husband and I loved it!  I substituted plain table salt and reduced the amount of salt by half.  Still came out great! I only cooked it about 12 hours on low in the standard crock pot and it was awesome.  The hardest part was smelling it for 12 hours before eating any!

I made this for a small scale luau, and everyone loved it. I couldn't locate any hawaiian sea salt, and was without a measuring spoon, so I probably didn't use enough salt.  However it tasted very good, and the servings were generous!

Excellent and Extremly easy to make.  My husband is VERY picky and he LOVED IT.  I actually ordered the Hawaiian Sea Salt online at www.hawaiisalt.com and it took only about 3 or maybe 4 days to get it in the mail.  I also added just a little bit more of the liquid smoke.  I had a 4 1/2 pound roast and it took about 12 1/2 hrs to cook.

Although this was easy to make and came out very tender, I didn't think the taste was quite like the pork we had on our vacation to HI last year.  This seemed overly salty and not enough smokey flavor.  I will use the leftovers on a pizza, along with pineapple chunks.  Had it that way in HI and it was delicious.  (I used regular sea salt, my grocery store never heard of Hawaiian sea salt.)

I'm not an expert on Kalua pork since I've only visited (never lived) in Hawaii, but this is delicious!  I may need just a hair more smoke flavor, but that's about it.  I used 5lbs of pork shoulder roast and it took about 12 hours to cook.

I have made this for work, Church and various parties and everyone raves over it.  However, I do add more liquid smoke and when cooking in a newer slow cooker the time is much less.  I did a 9lb in 12 hours

I made this twice.  Once with a pork butt roast and once with a leaner pork roast.  I would definitely recommend sticking with the pork butt, the other meat was too dry, though the flavor of both was superb.

I may have used a little more smoke flavoring than the recipe called for.  Also, I used a fresh picnic shoulder cut.  Came out tender, if a bit salty.  The simple seasoning made the leftovers more versatle.  One night, I mixed with barbeque sauce for sandwiches; another I made pork fried rice.

This is a good recipe, it can be bland for some.  However, serving suggestion, sprinkle sandwich with soy sauce and add a slice of pineapple or a raw sweet onion.

I made this for a luau.  DELICIOUS!!!  Many great compliments from guests.  I used a 20lb. pork loin and used regular sea salt, could not find Hawaiian sea salt, and cooked for approximately 9 hours then shredded the pork. UMMM! wonderful recipe.  Many Thanks!

Wonderful.  The key is to leave undisturbed and turn once.  Extremely moist and good flavor.  Next time I may try it with a little less salt.

I was a little skeptical about trying this recipe, because I was making it for guests and feared that it wouldn't taste authentic.  I've lived in Hawaii, I've been to SEVERAL luau's... and I have to say that this tastes like the "real deal!"  Thanks so much sharing this!!!

This was so easy and SO good!  I am not sure if I had the right cut of meat. I bought a 6 lb pork shoulder roast. The sign said pork shoulder butt, but the sticker on the roast just said pork shoulder. Anyway, it had the bone-in. By the time it was done, after about 18 hrs, the bone just fell out! The meat was so moist and shredded with the slightest touch of the fork.  My family loved this, even my picky kids!  I will be making this VERY often.  Oh yeah, it was also dirt cheap other than the fact that I had to buy a $3.50 HUGE bag of Hawaiian sea salt that will last me a lifetime!  The roast was only $6.  Thanks for the recipe!

Having lived in Hawaii for 3 years and tried Kalua Pig, this is just as tasty and soooo easy to make.  I have made it numerous times and get lots of compliments.  It is great served on rolls or with white sticky rice.  You can't mess this recipe up!

My husband was quite impressed with this.  Simple and easy to prepare.  Tender and full of flavor.  It is rather dry, though, so plan on adding barbecue sauce to the resulting pulled pork.

Very tender!  My husband and I really enjoyed this.  The only thing is that I could not find Hawiian sea salt (looked at 3 stores), so I just got regular sea salt, is that the same thing?  I thought it could be a little spicier and the salt may be why.  I will definately make it again though.  It was so easy!
Out of this one butt we have had it 4 different meals.  1st: as is by the recipe, next day lunch:  with BBQ sauce and vinegar (sandwich), next day dinner:  mixed in with beef ramon noodles, third day lunch:  heated on a bun with seasoning salt, garlic, and cheese.  Every time was yummy and different.  We probably could have had it again if we hadn't felt sorry for our dog, everytime we ate we threw her chunks!

Delicious!  After 10 hours, I turned it over and it was already falling apart.  I only cooked for 12 hours and it was SO tender that I do not think it needs to cook for as long as the recipe states.  My only complaint is that the roast does not smell very good while it's cooking.  But the taste more than made up for that.

Great recipe, and so easy! I used a 4lb roast, which made enough for 6 sandwiches. I cut down the salt slightly, and still found the final product to be pretty salty, but my husband said he wouldn't change a thing, and has requested that we make this A LOT this summer!

Tasty and simple. Not quite out-of-the-pit flavor, but close enough for how little effort this recipe requires.

This is my go to potluck dish for any season. It is so simple and so delicious!!!!! I have made this over 8x and every time it's a hit. You can't go wrong. I serve with Hawaiian rolls and slaw on the side, plus bbq for those that want it but it really does not need it. Enjoy!

This is a very simple and easy recipe.  After 20 hours in the slow cooker, the meat practically shredded itself.  I thought it was good, but my kids raved about it.

This was amazing!  I found the specified salt and made exactly as directed.  I was a bit nervous leaving it to simmer unattended all day, but it was so tender when done.  I started it at 2am and we ate around 6pm - it was 7-8lbs.  I enjoyed sandwiches for weeks with the leftovers!  We will be having this for Christmas!

This was delicious!!!!  I made an 8.5 lb pork roast in my slow cooker last week and it was brought to feed us fam of 4 twice plus have enough for two meals in the freezer.  I was afraid that this would be too salty and smoky since every time I’ve eaten kalua pork at a restaurant that’s been the case but my hubby loves restaurant kalua pork so I gave it a shot with this recipe and I could not be more pleased with the results.  I had to increase the portion amount for my larger cut of meat using the all recipes calculator and it work perfectly.  The salt level and the smoke level were absolutely perfect.  My final concern was that 20 hours would be too long and the meat might begin to deteriorate or dry out and be flavorless... it was PERFECT.  Totally worth the wait and I will do this easy recipe over again regularly.

This is sooooo good. I have made it many times but have never  gotten around to leaving a review. 

I know the time seems long but do NOT change it. Also, I used the real Hawaiian salt. I did have to hunt it down but it is really worth it. I followed this recipe exactly. Thanks for such a delicious recipe.

I would make this again. I made it for a group of a little more than 20 people so I used about 8-9 lbs of pork. Couldn’t find Hawaiian sea salt so I settled for Trader Joe’s sea salt. Used Stubbs liquid smoke. I let the slow cooker heat up for about 20 mins and cut the pork into chunks to help with thorough cooking and rubbed down the meat with the sea salt. Left on low for about 22 hours. My sister made a great coleslaw to top it and guests could chose their bbq sauce if they wanted some. I even had someone who cooks slow cooked pork from the south come back for seconds. This is a BIG crowd pleaser!

I was given this recipe from a family at church who are from Hawaii, so it's the real deal!  So easy.  There's nothing more to do than poke, salt, and rub!  When adding the liquid smoke, either use a brush to apply or wear gloves to rub it on to save yourself from stained stinky hands!  I don't measure the Hawaiian salt nor the liquid smoke, just generously apply both after poking lots of holes.  I use a large carving-type fork that has long substantial tines so it goes deeply into the meat (all around) with minimal effort.  After pulling the meat apart I add enough of the cooking liquid to moisten it, and then use the rest to make sticky rice in my rice cooker.  So if it calls for 1 cup of water I use approx. 1/4 c. pig juice and 3/4 c. water, depending on how salty the juice is.  It makes great rice!  You couldn't make an easier or tastier piece of meat.  Also, I like to get 2-3 smaller boneless pork roasts (I have a large slow cooker so several 2-3 lb roasts fit) instead of one large roast. 
 I have tried it both ways and prefer the tenderness and quicker cooking time using multiple smaller roasts.  You won't be disappointed with this easy and delicious recipe.  I make so much for just one person because it freezes very well.  After pulling the pork and making the flavored sticky rice, I just portion both together into a meal size container and pop into the freezer!  I usually end up with enough to eat for 3 dinners when freshly made, give 2 portions to a friend, and have

Super tender, husband just loved it. The thing he didn’t love was the smell because there wasn’t one. He was expected an aroma wafting thru the house when we walked in the door (like other crockpot meals) but nothing. Nonetheless, it was amazing...in a sandwich, combined with rice, eaten alone. Thumbs up!

I used a 9lb roast so increased the liquid smoke to 1 1/2 Tablespoons and 2 Tablespoons of  ground pink sea salt.  Cooked on low for 10 hours, then removed fat cap, flipped roast and cooked the final 10 hours.  FANTASTIC!

The roast I picked up was to large for one slow cooker so I had to cut it in half and use two slow cookers. I did not think to cut the ingredients in half as well so too salty without BBQ sauce. Otherwise, fantastic. Will make again, correctly, soon.

I make this recipe every 3-4 weeks. I eat it plain or with cabbage cooked in the juice first night and then use it in nachos/ tacos, omelets and soups. It freezes great!I I still can't believe how easy and delicious this is.

This is absolutely amazing!  The 2nd time I made this, I increased to 9 pounds to have lots of leftovers.  We serve this over rice.  Super quick prep (most intensive part is taking all the fat off before serving, but well worth it!).  LOVE THIS!

Made it last night, it turn out great.  I added a little Chinese five spices, and wrap it in banana leaves.  Set it in slow cooker at high for 4 hours and keep warm for the next 4 hours.  I also wrap the cooker cover with plastic food wrap to keep the moisture in pot.

As i do on a regular basis. I make the recipe as written first time around then add or delete from there the next time i make it.
This one is perfect just the way it is. 

The family loves it! I start the roast (never smaller than 3 lbs or i dont get any) the night before on low, by the next morning it is fall apart tender. 
Shred what needs it put it back in the crock add the cabbage and let it cook for another half to one hr on low so it can  soak up all the.delicious juices. 
Perfect every time.
Just like living on the island ,take your time.No rush.all good things come to those that wait.

I made this in my Instant Pot. I used olive oil and browned the pork on sauté on all sides (about a minute or so a side).  I removed the pork and set it aside, then added the water and liquid smoke to the pot and put the pork back in.  I used Himalayan salt, grinding it over the top of the pork (I used less than half what the recipe called for).  Set the timer for 90 minutes, followed by a 20 minute natural release and done.  It was the best Kulua pork I’ve ever had, not fatty or greasy.  My family loved it.

3 ingredients. Simple. Bc I’m Hawaiian and live in Hawaii I’ve been a part of many many Imu digging paina. (Pit digging parties). That’s how kalua pig is traditionally cooked. In an under ground oven. However, when I’m ono for kalua pig and my saved and frozen traditionally cooked pig has been devoured, its time to turn to 20th century ingenuity and use the oven or slow cooker. I use a 3-4lb roast, butt, or shoulder. I put small slits in the meat then rub a small palm amount of white Hawaiian salt all over and inside the slits then sprinkle with hickory liquid smoke. Which I eyeball. Probably around 1-2 tbls. Cook on high for 4 hours then on low for 2 hrs. During the last hour on low, I cut up a medium round yellow onion (cubed), add that in then chop up a small to medium head of cabbage and add it too. All pau. (Done). Shred with two forks. Every New Years Day we eat Hawaiian Food. Two more days. I can’t wait. Lol. Add Lomi Lomi salmon, chicken long rice, squid or chicken luau, Lau Lau, rice, poi and of course Haupia for dessert to your menu. No. We don’t drink mai tais. It’s Beer, wine, coffee, fruit punch or swipe.             Hauoli Maka Hiki Hou!!!!  A hui hou!

This was the best roast I’ve ever made! I used black lava salt as others suggested and agree with them on the added flavor dimension. Also, just so happens I was finishing up a bag of smoked almonds. I scooped up about a tablespoon of the seasoning from the bottom of the bag and rubbed it all over the roast along with the salt. It was large - over 9 lbs - and had been neatly tied up by the butcher. There was a good covering of fat on one side. I made slices along that side and poured just one teaspoon mesquite liquid smoke over it. Still can’t believe how delicious this recipe turned out yet was so simple.

Take the meat out and shred it ~1 hour before it’s “done” and mix in some shredded cabbage ~30 minutes early. Cook the cabbage just enough to soften it, but still leave in a bit of crunch. Serve with rice for a great Hawaiian lunch plate!

This is one of my family's all time favorites.  I throw in a handful of garlic cloves and shortened the cook time to about 16 hrs.  I usually sauté some mushrooms in a brown gravy mix and add those in after I shred the pork. It adds a little more sauce, just in case.

I love Boston Butt roasts because they're so tender and flavorful and they taste great when cooked in a slow cooker all day. This recipe is very similar to how I make pork for pulled pork sandwiches. 

It came out great! I couldn't find Hawaiian salt in time, so I substituted pink Himalayan salt. It was still delicious but I definitely want to try it with the Hawaiian salt.

I served it with an Asian inspired coleslaw (shredded cabbage, carrots, green onions, and cilantro with a store bought ginger dressing) and macaroni and cheese. I looked up traditional Hawaiian sides and didn't have access to some ingredients. I found out macaroni salad is a traditional side dish, but my kids hate mayonnaise. Someone else suggested that macaroni and cheese is also traditional, so I made that because the kids love it. We also served it with yeast rolls because none of us care for the sweet Hawaiian rolls. All the components of the meal complimented each other really well.

I will definitely be making this again!

Comes out perfect every time! I’ve cooked it for 12-20 hours, depending on how early I remember to start it :) I used red Hawaiian salt and black Hawaiian salt and an extra TBS of liquid smoke cause I love that stuff. Don’t know if it made a difference but I also sliced a banana in half and placed it on top of the roast. Discard it when it’s all done. I pull the roast out before serving, to let it cool a little so I can shred it... while it’s cooling I use a gravy separator with the juices (usually just adding ice to it so the fat floats to the top) and pour back in most of the juices sans the fat. Add back in the now shredded pork, let it warm back up a bit and dinner is done :) served with rice of course.Never been to Hawaii but it tastes just like the one I had served at a Hawaiian restaurant and my hubby says it’s on par with the real thing in Hawaii. So thank you! :)

I've made this many times and have never cooked it that long. My 6 quart slow cookers fits two of the "tri tip pork roasts" (sold in pkg of 3 at Costco). Its well trimmed pork butt I believe and is nice and lean. I never flip it and just add a bit of water or broth and cook on high for a couple hours and then on low for 6-7 hours. A forgiving recipe, that is great with rice, or as a base for tacos or burritos. Easy and very lean.

This is an acceptable recipe. However, it is missing half of its flavor. When I had to transfer from Hawaii to NY then OH and VA I would order from my local florist two banana leaves and one bunch of ti leaves. Wash them thoroughly and then trim the green leaf off of the spine of the banana (one leaf equals two long green strips. discard the spine). On the back of each ti leaf, gently press a knife blade across the spine to break it. Fold the leaf and peel the bottom half off the spine of the leaf. Next, depending upon the size of your meat, lay out a big square of foil. Then make a flower in the center of it with all your ti leaves (tips together in the center. Then lay your four larger banana leave on top in a crisscross or basket weave pattern. Take your meat and rub it generously with sea salt. Center it on the leaves.  sprinkle well with Keawe/Mesquite liquid smoke. Fold the banana leaf  up flat over the meat. Then, repeat by bringing each petal of the ti leaves up and over. Finally, bring the foil up and over and tightly wrap so that all the leaves are completely covered/secured. I put a small wire rack in the bottom of my slow cooker and fill with water to the bottom of the wire. Then I sit the foil package on it and put it on low for about 16-20 hours. The leaves are a very traditional way of cooking the meat in the imu and they impart a flavor that is subtle and so 'ono (delicious) also, they help absorb fat. When the dish is done, take the lid off and peel the foil

The pictures with this recipe does not do it justice.  My family spends a great deal of time in Maui.  We love authentic Kalua pork with Ti Leaves but you can't really get those on the mainland.  I'm sooooooooo tired of bbq pulled pork.  I like the smoky-saltiness of kalua style.  This recipe is not only extremely easy, it's the closest I get to the real thing.  It's our go-to meat for crowds or multiple meals.  You can eat it alone, on a hawaiian bun/rolls, as lettuce wraps, stuffed potato skins, salads you name it.  Love this recipe.

Wife and I just made this last night in our slow cooker.  We bought a 6lb pork shoulder for this.  Don't have Hawaiian sea salt in our local stores (looked in asian and non-asian).  We substituted Himalayan Pink salt instead.  Had a hard time finding liquid smoke as well, Googled a substitute and found some smoked paprika.  Cooked in slow cooker for 9 hours and we wrapped our in banana leaf.  Didn't turn the roast over due to the banana leaf would have torn.  We did add about 3-4 ounces of water..since we were uncertain if the banana leaf would burn in the slow cooker.

We found it okay..not super special or outstanding.  We have not tried traditional kalua pork, so we don't have a means of comparison or reference.

The side of the meat that was in contact with the liquid was easier to shred than the side that wasn't (of course).  The smoked paprika flavor did come through as did the infused flavor of the banana leaf.  After shredding with 2 forks, i put all back in the slow cooker with the juices (removed the banana leaf).  The shredded pork did gain the flavoring from the juices.

However, found this difficult to eat with rice, not saucy enough for our palate.  I did use some in a wrap with some hickory smoked bbq sauce and it was fine.  If you prefer pulled pork this is 1 way to go if you intend to use your favorite sauce and some veggies with it in a sandwich/wrap.

However, we prefer this one for making a pulled pork style dish : https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/141678/

This deffinetly had the potential to be good but I will say that 16-20 hours is WAY too long! I've never made this dish so I followed the recipe exactly put it in the night before at 10 on low and by 8:00am it was more than ready. I'd say no more than 10 hours. I left it in the 16 hours and it was so dry there was barely any juices left. And I had a 7lb roast. I had to throw more than half of it away because it was so dry and mushy . I don't care what kind of crock pot you have 16-20 hours is too long!

This makes such a delicious pork. 
It's tender and extremely versatile. We turn it into barbecue sandwiches, pork tacos. quesadillas or just over rice with veggies.
Yum!

This is so delicious, and such a simple recipe!  I used a 2 lb pork shoulder, and cooked it on low for 9 hrs. I'll bet it would be even tastier if it cooked longer. I couldn't find Hawaiian Salt so I used Kosher salt, since it is coarser. Like a few other reviewers, I shredded the meat, then stirred it back into the Crock Pot to simmer in the juices for about an hour, before serving. This shredded pork came out so tender, juicy, and flavorful!  It reminded me of our trip to Kauai!  I served it with King's Hawaiian dinner rolls and Cole Slaw. Aloha!

This was a very tasty and really easy to make meal! I made half of what the recipe calls for and was more than enough for a family of 5. I made pork sliders using mini sweet rolls and was a hit!

Around 1 Tbs liquid smoke per 2 lbs meat. Around 1 Tbs LARGE crystal sea salt (I have used Red Hawaiian and Himalayan, which is also reddish with similar mineral content) per 2 lbs meat. I add liquid, pineapple juice if I have it, water otherwise. I add a banana or two to top of roast at beginning, take those out after overnight. Cut them down the side to allow it to come out of the skin. Add a little pepper to the meat at the beginning.

As a few other reviewers mentioned, it just tasted like any other pork roast I have made and as another reviewer said "that is exactly what I was trying to avoid"   - I didn't cook it 16 hours - in my new crockpot that would have obliterated the meat.    I get that crockpots are different, old ones v. new ones.  That wasn't the issue.   
Don't get me wrong, it was good.  And very tender!!!!   
But honestly not sensational.   And it is rare I give a recipe on this site  less than 4 stars.

I used black lava salt and liquid smoke.  Followed the directions and it came out almost as fantastic as the one smoked in banana leaves for umpteen hours.  I will absolutely make this again.

Went to Hawaii in 2012 and ate kalua pig.  Found this simple recipe that tastes just like what we had.  —really, really delicious!  Stocked up on the Hawaiian Red Sea salt when we returned in 2014!  —no substitutions for that!  We serve this at picnics all the time.  I make a 9 lb. Boston butt roast and then freeze in quart bags.  It’s an addicting food . . .

Solid recipe, but a couple things are missing that really make it much better and more authentic. 
1. Slice a medium yellow onion into several thick rings and place them at the bottom of the pot. 
2. Place the shoulder fat side up. 
3. After shredding the pork add 1/2 - 1 shredded cabbage and allow it to cook for about 30 minutes to an hour. 
4. Serve over white rice (We use Jasmine) or make Hawaiian sweet roll sliders. Crushed pineapple also compliments it quite nicely especially on the sliders.

I cooked this in the crock-pot on high for about 8 hours then shredded it and let it soak a bit longer. This was excellent but next time I will use more of the liquid smoke. I could not find the Hawaiian sea salt but used some Himalayan salt I had on hand (about half of what it said).
Thanks for sharing this recipe, I will  definitely make this again.

LOVE this recipe. Kind of hard to find actual pork shoulder (butt) but this works with loin too. Had to order the black salt online - hard to find as well.  I put a sliced banana (in the peel) on top as someone suggested,  put it in the oven overnight at 200, and always turns out juicy and flavorful - plus the house smells so good in the morning.  I freeze quite a bit of this for tacos later. Thanks!

This was amazingly great! I used a 4pound pork butt. I pierced it with a metal skewer. I didn’t change the amount of salt or smoke. I then added 2 Tbsp of soy sauce. I put the crock pot on high for 3-4 hours and then low for 6-8. 45 minutes before I turned it off I put 3cups of shredded cabbage on top. We served it with rice and it was so delicious! Mahalo!

Excellent and easy recipe. I cut the recipe in half and Used  a 3 pound bone in butt roast for 8 hours and added extra smoke flavor. I substituted kosher for sea salt. Turned out EXCELLENT.

I will cook this again, but with tweaks next time. IDK why this was so salty for most, as I did not find it to be too salty. In fact it could've used both more of the liquid smoke and salt. I did like the cook on it, was done perfectly.

There wasn't much flavor and the 16-20 hr time dried out the meat. I would recommend doubling the salt and smoke and cooking for 8-10 hours.

This is my second time making this.  Used a 7# pork butt and  I did use less salt (sea salt) & 2 t. smoke seasoning.  Cooked for about 14 hrs & it was perfect.  Dinner tonight & two freezer containers for later dinners. Thanks for a fabulous and easy recipe!

I cooked for 16 hours and that was a little too long. Pork was drying out. Followed some other suggestions and placed 2 bananas on top of the meat.  We actually felt it did not impart enough of the subtle flavor we were looking for. The liquid smoke seemed very strong at first but after 16 hours had faded to almost imperceptible. I used large crystal sea salt, couldn't get the recommended Hawaiian salt.  In short, this turned out like a slightly over cooked shredded pork roast with little to set it apart, however, it was reasonably tasty, tender and when combined with Cole Slaw was a nice, easy meal. I'll be using the slow cooker again with some significant tweaking. I'm going to try a rack so it roasts and steams more than boils in it's own juice, add more smoke, more bananas, shorten cook time, add some other tropical fruit to strengthen that flavor.

My husband usually uses his smoker for pulled pork but I saw this recipe and thought I'd try it. So glad that I did! We both thought it was fantastic. The only change was really just an addition suggested by another member and that was to add two whole bananas split lengthwise on the top (peel and all). All of it so simple and yet so delicious!! Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful recipe with us :  )

Maybe my expectations were too high with all the great reviews. I made this exactly as written, with the exception of cooking time, anything over 11 hours on low and it would have been dry.  Not sure if altitude makes a difference, but I'm in Colorado. This was just ok. I used a 5.32 lb boneless pork shoulder roast. I couldn't taste the liquid smoke in the roast at all. I'm glad I did a trial run of this before our luau at the end of the month so I knew what to expect.

This is Kalua pig. When I was a kid in Hawai'i and later as an adult, one of my favorite things was Kalua pig at a lu'au. But my mom never made it (she being from the South and kalua pig not being a staple of Tennessee diets), so we only got it at lu'au. In later years living on the mainland, my wife tried several recipes, usually involving bananas, to make kalua pig.

They were all pretty good, but the taste was "off" (bananas?) and the meat was drier than I'd remembered. Short of digging an imu pit, using a slow cooker or an oven is the only way possible to cook it. I used 1 tbs of salt (regular table salt, since there was no Hawaiian Sea Salt in the grocery and I doubt that matters as different salts only make a difference as a finisher or topping anyways). I rubbed the top half with 1 half tbsp of salt then repeated with another half tbsp on the other half of the pork (7.4 lb pork shoulder). I then repeated this with 1/2 tbsp of liquid smoke on each half. I set the pork with the fatty side down into the cooker and let it cook for about 6 hrs. When juices had began to come out of the pork, I flipped it and let it cook another 14 hrs.

It came out perfect with no real effort in shredding, very moist, and not too salty. I served it with Japanese rice and a teriyaki pineapple sauce I made for the rice (in which I used some of the pork broth instead of water called for in the recipe) and also warmed pineapple slices since you cannot have too much pineapple on your plate, amiri

Fantastic and very easy recipe. I've now made it several times and each time turned out perfect. I followed the recipe steps and used the Hawaiian pink (clay) salt. I am making it again this week and will add the unpeeled banana suggestion from others. Try it and enjoy it! You won't regret it.

The meat was dry coming out of the crock pot; however, after adding our favorite bbq sauce my husband said it was every bit as good as Famous Dave's.

This was good. I would recommend using a fatty roast, I used a tenderloin roast and the cook time was a little long so we had to use more BBQ sauce due to some meat being drier in some areas than others.  I used Kosher Sea Salt instead of the Hawaiian, next time I will try it with the Hawaiian salt.

Oh My!  Talk about yummy! So easy to make. The hardest part of making this dish is going to bed at night with the delicious smell in your nose and then waking up to it the next morning and knowing you can't eat it until supper time. My husband said he dreamed about eating all night long! LOL

I used Black Hawaiian Sea Salt and a couple of garlic gloves. It was definitely done around 15/16 hours. When I made leftovers the next day I mixed in fresh Jersey tomatoes and sweet white corn. Banging!

I don't know why this review listed it as "It was ok" because I didn't get to rate it. I would have given it 5*s.  I think it is fabulous.  Especially easy for a big crowd.  

I have made it twice now.  The first time I used Himalayan Pink Salt and it was delicious.  I looked everywhere for a 6# pork butt and just couldn't find one that size.  I ended up using one a little over 4#s.  Made it for a 4th of July party and everyone loved it. Had a side of BBQ sauce and rolls and everyone made sandwiches if they weren't picking at the meat because it was so delicious.

The second time I made it I had gone online and purchased Red Hawaiian Sea Salt.  I again had a hard time finding a large pork shoulder or butt and ended up with a 4# bone in.  
I adjusted the amount of salt for the poundage but it was still too salty.  The Hawaiian salt seems much saltier.  Plus the bone actually cut down on the size of the meat so I probably should have adjusted it more.

I would not hesitate to use the Pink Himalayan salt if you can't find Hawaiian and don't have time to order it.  The red Hawaiian was impossible for me to find in a store.  Even Williams Sonoma didn't have it.  

This is so easy.  Just put it in the crock pot late at night before bed,  turn it when you get up and serve at dinner time. Lovely smell when you wake up in the morning too.

A lot of the fat seems to disappear during cooking.  Can add a little juice to the pulled meat to keep it moist.

Made to a couple of times now, but it needs to be wrapped in a banana leaf before you add the salt and liquid smoke, something about the banana leaf really brings the flavor to what i remember from Hawaii

This turned out really well. I used black Hawaiian salt. I cooked a six pound pork butt for 20 hours. My husband actually added salt to his. I was concerned about the reviews that said it was too salty but I did not have that issue at all. The meat fell apart and was very tender. We will be making this again. I served it with Hawaiian sweet rolls, and Cole slaw. I used BBQ sauce- my husband and kids did not. We all enjoyed this meal.

This is easily one of the most delicious recipes for pork that I have ever made! So simple, only three ingredients and a Crock-Pot. I cooked it on slow for about 20 hours, the meat simply fell apart. I had made it for a Hawaiian-themed pot luck dinner. Everyone raved about it!  Afterward, the left over meat was so easy to incorporate into other meals. We mostly made burritos - omigosh, they were *so* incredibly tasty!

I would highly recommend this recipe, on both preparation and flavor.

Love! I usually add lots of sauce to anything I eat but this was perfection. How something with so few ingredients can be so tasty I don't know. I served with sticky rice, pineapple and a little side salad. Tastier than the pork we had at a luau on our trip to Hawaii.

It's not as good as straight out of the imu, but in a pinch this recipe sure does the job!  I use it pretty often when I need a fix but don't have anyone digging a hole in the ground anytime soon.

I've made this a few times, and one time, I even used chicken because a guest had pork allergies. The chicken "kalua" was eaten up, so I guess this works for almost any kind of meat. I didn't find the flavor too salty.

Super easy recipe that my entire family loves. Our favorite way to eat it is street taco style. After making the meat in the crock pot, fry it on a skillet/griddle to crisp it up a little. Serve in a corn tortilla with onion/cilantro on top. Delish & is a great potluck dish.

Easter Sunday dinner entree; I chose this because there was little prep, on a very busy Sunday;  with GREAT results. Everyone around the table voted to put this in the family favorites, to repeat often! I served rice pilaf, and sauteed shredded cabbage in some of the juice from the pork, with a tad of sugar. I made honey wheat rolls along with this pork, and the saltiness of the meat was nicely offset by the slightly sweet in the rolls. I cooked the meat about 15 hrs, and it shredded perfectly with little effort.

Found the ingredients after a short internet search, Hawaiian Sea Salt at World Market and Liquid Smoke at Target. Prep is a snap. (How do you get the smell of liquid smoke off your hands? Oh well.) Cooking couldn't be easier, 16hrs on low.  Amazing how much "juice" is rendered from a 9lb pork butt, "dried out" will not be a concern if you buy a nice cut with ample fat. The aroma filled the house.  (A plus for this reviewer.). Served on Sweet Hawaiian rolls with grilled pineapple (recipe on Allrecipes.com), and rice.  My family loved it!  It was simple, easy to make, casual yet out of the ordinary.  Thanks Allrecipes for another opportunity to fill our bellies and home with love.

I have made this recipe many times. I always add about 8 to 10 ounces of pineapple juice and extra hickory liquid smoke. Always use shoulder butt roast not the leaner cuts. It makes for more juicy flavorful meat.

Traditional Kalua pig is wrapped in taro leaves but you can buy frozen banana leaves at the Asian market to give a slightly authentic flavor. In addition to the Hawaian salt and smoke flavor, this should pretty much nail it!  With rice and potatomac salad you have "ono grind brah!" ??

We make this exactly as the recipe states and it is my favorite shredded pork recipe. All the fat cooks out of the roast but the meat is juicy and flavorful.

We used Himalayan Pink salt and hickory liquid smoke on an almost 9lb pork butt. We put it on low but our crock pot runs pretty hot so we switched to warm at about hour 10. The meat practically shredded itself when we turned it. We did add salt/liquid smoke to our taste because I used both sparingly due to the reviews of it being salty. It's supposed to be salty so you can eat it with rice in every bite. Our Hawaiian friends loved it and it was a big hot all around. We will definitely be making it again especially since it's sooo easy.

We have never had Kalua Pork before but we wanted to try a different recipe with our Boston Butt. We made it as written and here are our thoughts: Very Moist!! I've made pork butt often butt this is the moistest we have tried! We did enjoy the flavor but felt like something was missing. Possibly herbs. I will make this again but maybe use some aromatic herbs like rosemary or thyme. Probably will not taste like authentic kalua pork but that is just our preference. Also, I would suggest removing most of the fat beforehand. Unless you're making this for a crowd, refrigerating the leftovers gives you a not-so-lovely coating of lard on it. Other than that we really enjoyed this! Only changes I will make will be to remove most of the fat and add some herbs. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

We've made this several times - it's a regular on our dinner menu - but most recently last night for a potluck where it got rave reviews. Typically, we use 2-2.5 pounds for our family of four and always have some leftover for the next day. For the potluck, we used 6 pounds - a party of 14, everyone had plenty to eat and we still had some leftover (which you will not hear us complaining about.).

Great recipe! It turned out very good. My slow cooker only has a high setting, so 9 hours in my slow cooker for. 4 pound pork butt was perfect.

Love it!  I followed the recipe exactly, except for cooking times.  I only left it in the crockpot about 6 hours. I did add shredded cabbage the last hour or so.  I serv d it with fresh pineapple chunks and a brown rice medley.  Yes, white rice would have been better, but the pork was so delicious it didn't matter.  My father was raised in the Islands - it used to be hard to get good Kailua pork on the mainland.  No more!

Wow, I have not quite found a better tasting pork sandwich in my life. This could possibly be the simplest and best pound for pound recipe I've experienced on this site.        

The only problem I had was trying to flip it after about 8 hours (of a 20 hour cook) because it was breaking apart, so I left it to cook on the same side

Not impressed. I used Hawaiian black salt as suggested by a reviewer, and a good quality liquid smoke. Nonetheless, it was bland and blah.

Just awesome! I used Hawaiian Red Alaea Sea Salt and liquid smoke as the recipe directed. The only things I did different were: 1) I added 1 cup of water & 2) I started with the crock pot on high for the first 4 hours and then dropped the temp to low for 8 hours and then let it rest for an hour... just in time for our anniversary dinner. It fell apart in the crock pot without having to pull it at all. I liked the taste more than when we had it on Maui... We will have to go back to Maui to give it a fair comparison...

AMAZING! I put it in the crock pot on low at 10 pm, flipped it at  8:30 am, then around 4pm shredded it and threw it back in with two cups of shredded cabbage (like another reviewer recommended). Ate at 6:30 pm on buns. My husband and I both LOVED it. I've already recommended this recipe to others, and will definitely make it again!

Although I used a 3 pound roast, I still slow-cooked it for the entire 20 hours. I questioned if approximately 1/2+ tablespoon of Hawaiian salt and Liquid Smoke would be enough, but the meat came out amazingly tender and flavorful! Big hit!! A keeper of a recipe.

Great summer dinner! Simple, delicious, cooks while I'm at work, and doesn't heat up the house (or trigger the a/c). Bonus: It's simple enough so it can be what's for dinner on a night that it's my son's turn to cook!

My little baby pork roast weighed only 1 lb. So I scaled this recipe down and followed the amounts of salt and liquid smoke listed for 2 servings. I couldn't really taste the "smoke," but my husband went crazy over it. He said it was better than bbq we buy. Did he just compare my home cooked meat to Memphis' best? I'll take it! I served this on buns with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce and Hawaiian Cole Slaw.

Just made four batches of this recipe for a weekend of luaus and this kalua pig was quite a hit with everyone.  Very simple to make, you just have to plan ahead for 20 hours in the crock pot, and... buried here in the comments I came across some sage advice to *slice open a banana but leave it in the peel and place on top of the pork* to infuse the dish with a traditional imu/banana leaf flavor.
I was intrigued so I tried it and it worked wonderfully!  All of our luau guests went back for seconds, thirds, fourths...

Loved it!    The recipe calls for 6 lbs. of pork.  If you make less, REDUCE the amount of salt and liquid smoke.  Add quartered cabbage last hour, yum!

Made this for my daughter's luau themed birthday party and nearly every adult asked how it was prepared.
I typically cook pork roasts covered in water & seasonings for 8-10 hours so I was a little skeptical of not adding any liquids but I have not one complaint here!  My 9 pound roast had a perfect, flavorful, falling apart and recipe demanding finish after 19 hours that I will use time and time again.

Still one of the easiest and best crockpot pork recipes I have encountered! Spend the time getting all the fat off the meat and definitely strain the fat from the au jus before adding back to meat. Makes for some very moist and tender pork that can be used for many things from breakfast hash or sandwiches with chicago peppers or bbq sauce. I prefer simple to not mask the wonderful pork flavor that is created with this. The hardest part is waking up to that wonderful aroma in the house. ??

My crock pot runs really hot, even on the low setting, so I cooked the pork shoulder in the oven. 8lb pork shoulder, 16 hours at 225 degrees. It was PERFECT! Not dry at all. It created a lot of juices, and it spilled in my oven when I removed it to turn at about 10 hours...so be careful. ;) I was also conservative with the pink hawaiian salt, and added a little bit in after I shredded it. It was moist and tender, and perfectly smokey. Will definitely do this again!!!!

Bought Hawaiian sea salt from amazon and glad I did - much more subtle flavor.  Halved this recipe and it turned out amazing.   (At about 11 hours, too dry by 13).  Next time maybe I should pick up some banana leaves too...
Next time I made 7# - still only took 12 hours.  I let it sit in its juices on warm until served - so moist and yummy.

It was ok. Pretty tender and juicy. Unless I am doing an Hawaiian theme, I doubt I will do it again. There are shorter recipes for pulled pork And,if you end up putting a sauce on it, what's the point of finding Hawaiian sea salt (in CO), plus cooking for 20 hours.

This was amazing! I used 2 lbs of pork, and followed the advice of another reviewer by adding 1 C of cabbage. I don't know that the cabbage did anything other than bulk up the meal, but it did at least add some vegetables to an otherwise protein filled meal. We serve this on hamburger buns with BBQ sauce for a more authentic BBQ feel. Amazing!

I used to make this often. I used black volcanic salt as its smokier. Such an easy recipe. I've switched to organic pork and roasts are virtually impossible for me to find.

I've made this five or six times now. So delicious!  I couldn't find Hawaiian salt anywhere so used some other variety from a grinder -- can't imagine it makes much difference in this context.  This is a really fantastic, easy recipe.

Delicious! I was able to find Hawaiian sea salt at World Market - and you can check their website to see whether it's in stock at a store near you, which was much easier than going to every ethnic market in town. The Hawaiian salt is much more mild than regular salt -- if anything, we needed to add a bit of salt at the end -- it had a very mild flavor.

I was shredding the pork as I was taking it out of the crock pot, and skimmed the fat out as I was transferring the meat. Absolutely delicious!

I have made this twice and it is fantastic and  so easy. The first time I could not locate Hawaiian sea salt and substituted Himalayan. The first time I cooked it for 24 hours on low and the second time for 16 hours on low as that was all the time I had to cook it for a family meal. I definitely think that the Red Hawaiian sea salt gives it a better flavor enhancement and I plan to use it from now on.  That being said you can't go wrong using either sea salt. This is a fabulous recipe.

My family enjoyed it even though it was a new dish at our house. I suppose it would be good to make when family is coming for a few days. It is an acquired taste and was nothing like what I expected. I had to skip the liquid smoke and Hawaiian salt since I couldn't find it anywhere in town. If I ever make it again, which is doubtful, I'll be sure to order those ingredients online to be prepared; worschesire and sea salt was not a good substitute.

Made it to the T, and it's delicious! Wow! You get that smoky flavor and it just falls apart. I had a 4 PD butt roast so it only needed 8 hrs. Next time I'm adding pineapple slices cuz Hawaiian! Highly recommended to make!

First time making anything like this and it was seriously amazing!  I did it in my crockpot on hi for 8 hrs.  If your in a hurry, 6 hours might do the trick. I was worried about the salt because my favorite local Hawaiian place is too salty. So I did a 1/2 Tablespoon . I used red Hawaiian sea salt which might be less salty that some other types. The meat came out a little under salted so next time I will do the full amount of 1 Tablespoon.  I used applewood flavored liquid smoke and loved the flavor!  Something else I would recommend  it taking the meat out of the pot and shredding it on a cutting board or separate container. If you shred it in your cooking pot/pan, it's going to be super greasy because all the fat renders to the bottom.  If your doing this in the oven, make sure you cover tight with foil. The meat need the steam.  Serve this with Japanese rice and Mac salad and you will have to force yourself to stop eating! Soooo fantastic and soooo easy!

My husband loved this, but the rest of us thought it was too bland.  It was tender  and juicy, it just didn't have a lot of flavor.  I like the idea of using liquid smoke to give it that flavor- I do that with my oven brisket, but I for my tastes, this just needs some further seasoning to have it be really flavorful.

I've never been to Hawaii, but if this is what Hawaiian food is all about, I seriously need to travel there!  I made this for a party; so very simple to put together and your house will smell like heaven while it cooks away!  My husband was ready to dig a hole in the backyard to make this happen.  Good thing I found this recipe before he found the shovel:o)

I've made this numerous times - sometimes with the banana & sometimes without. I use the boneless pork loin, because it's leaner,  and it still turns out great. It's my " go to" recipe for any large gathering. I make it for Easter, instead of ham. Always gets rave reviews & disappears quickly!

Excelleñt and easy, BUT it was done in 8 hours. I had a huge piece of meat, 6-8lbs. My crockpot must run hotter on low than others. I like the mild flavor because I can turn leftovers into lots of things.

I have made this many, many times. There is so much you can do with this meat!
First of all...the salt you use is important, people. My favorite is black hawaiian volcanic sea salt that can be obtained online or at whole foods. It just adds to the smoky flavor. But I have made it with other course salts and it is still good. Just DON'T use regular table salt. It will be way to salty.
I have made with bananas, plantains and nothing. Use the banana/plantains if your are serving hawaiian style (think sticky rice).
This meat makes the best bbq pork sandwiches, carnitas (add chili powder and fry), teriyaki, etc. The possibilities are endless.
This super simple recipe makes you look like a rock star. Great for big parties!

I made as directed and it was very good.  The only thing missing was the "hint" of sweet that comes from using banana or Hawaiian ti leaves to wrap the roast.  Still, it reminds me of my long-ago home in Hawaii!

Best Kalua Pork outside of the islands at a Luau. I have made it several times and everyone loved it. Recently, I made it again using a small 2 lb pork loin roast. I neglected to reduce the mount of salt. It was cooked perfect and was tender and juicy, but was so salty it was almost uneatable. Made it again and after the liquid smoke, I only used a pinch of salt on both sides and it was perfect. Aloha.

I made it as the recipe as written but it was WAY too salty. So I took a can of pineapple juice and flooded the meat, drained all of the liquid out, then added some more fresh juice in.

This has a WONDERFUL flavor! I make a slow cooker pulled pork BBQ but this is different. This is really good made as sliders with those little Hawaiian rolls. This has perfect smoked over a slow pit flavor! Will make this again!

Cook it at least 20 hours, it's worth the wait.  If you use a roast smaller than 6 pounds, be sure to reduce the salt proportionately.  And the red Hawaiian salt really does make a difference!

this recipe is awesome! I decided to add half a can of pineapple chunks and about 1/4 cup brown sugar on top of the pork for extra sweetness and it was amazing!

It's pretty good but I wouldn't say it's the best i had. I found it very fatty but liked it better when i toasted it on a skillet. Mixed the leftover toasted ones with fried rice.

Wonderful! The worst part of this is planning when you want to eat so you can start it the proper time the day before.

We just returned from vacation in Hawaii, and still craving those island flavors, I decided to try this recipe. I used a combination of Red Hawaiian Sea Salt, and Black Hawaiian Lava Salt, and used mesquite liquid smoke. I didn't measure the salt, I just ground it and rubbed it on until the roast was pretty well covered. My pork roast was 3 lbs, so I only cooked it for about 10 hours on low, turning halfway through, then shredded it and let it continue to sit in the juices on low for another 2 hours. I was worried it was going to be dry cooking for that long, but it was delicious. I served on steamed Hawaiian rolls with a cabbage slaw. Delicious. I will definitely make again!

AH-MA-ZING!! I have made this with a shoulder/butt roast and a pork tenderloin and both turned out excellent.  I was worried about the time to cook it-thinking that 16-20 hours must have been a typo--but I was wrong. You really do cook it for 16-20 hours. I did not have the Hawaiian sea salt so I just used coarse sea salt based on another reviewer's post and it worked flawlessly. This is my go-to weekly recipe because it is oh-so easy to make, is affordable, feeds a crowd, and really hits the comfort factor one goes for in a roast. The pork tenderloin is what I prefer for the cut of meat because it is so lean...and can be a wee bit dry....just add some water or stock during the cooking process and it is just perfect. THANK YOU KIKUKAT for this recipe!!

This was only the second dish I've made that I actually couldn't eat when it was done.  Not sure if I messed it up or if it was the recipe but I will not be trying it again.

This was SOOOO easy and SOOOO good!  With Hawaiian buns and a little cole slaw - FABULOUS!  I had only 3 lbs of meet which cooked really fast (less than 10 hrs).  I also thought it was a little salty, so will use less salt next time.

This is the easiest recipe on earth!  Now, I made some small changes... I know, I know, I know... But, I found this other recipe online first and bacon sounded great.  Same thing as this recipe, except I lined the bottom of my crockpot with raw bacon... about 5 pcs.  I had an 8.5 lb roast and it took up the entire pot...not exaggerating!  I salted the heck out of it with plain sea salt and then took whole peeled garlic cloves (you can buy these in a small tub at the grocery store!) and stabbed the roast all over with a paring knife and stuck one in each spot.  Total of maybe 8 garlic cloves.  I put it on high and cooked it for 8 or 9 hrs.  I do want to try the liquid smoke, but I didn't have it on hand.  But, it turned out AMAZING nonetheless.  No water needed!!  Do not add water!!  It cooks in its own juices and my crockpot was FULL of the broth once it was finished cooking.  If I had added juice it would have overflowed.  After 8 hours it was falling apart.  And my roast had a little bone in the middle.  Then I took it all out and shredded it, couldn't find the garlic or bacon.  It all just cooked together!  Super simple.

I served it with a jar of BBQ sauce for people to put on if they wanted, but it is sooooo much better as it is.

Made this yesterday. I used the exact recipe with a 3lb pork butt roast. Added about a cup of water in the bottom and cooked on high for 6 hours. I removed the roast to shred it and then put it back in the slow cooker for about 10 minutes. It was good by itself and even better with Sweet Baby's BBQ sauce.

I made this twice for 2 large crowds (40+) so I had to use a couple of roasters and cooked  it for 24-26 hours at between 200 and 225 degrees. The first was an older crowd and the second was a group of college students.  Even those who stated they did not like pork reluctantly tried it after hearing their peers rave.  They were so surprised to find themselves coming back for seconds!  I ordered the sea salt online for ease. The only one who may have wanted to complain was my boxer who had to smell this cooking all night and day!

Cheap, easy and simple. Makes me miss L&L when I was stationed in Hawaii. I usually take the leftovers and add barbecue sauce and make sandwiches for another meal. Killing two meals with one recipe. this helps with me and my wife both working. I tried shredded cabbage in the bag but I feel a head of cabbage is a little better. I just cut the head into quarters and cook for an hour or two. put some rice in the rice cooker. It is awesome! Definitely one we keep in the rotation.

This is so amazing!  I used the Hawaiian salt and a little smoked salt.  I can see why some might say it is salty, but that is the way it is supposed to taste.  I served this with brown rice, stir fried cabbage with garlic and pineapple spears.  Even the kids loved it! EASY too!

First time making this recipe! It came out great following it exactly! I did remove fat from juices before adding shredded pork and juices back to crockpot to reheat for potluck at work the next day. Served with just the Hawaiian rolls, and everyone loved it. I will add a bit more liquid smoke next time, and I may try adding the banana next time also. PS no leftovers to try with BBQ sauce! :( so I will definitely make this again to try variations!

I can't ever find Hawaiian Sea salt but I have used Himalayan Salt and Kosher Salt and both were delicious!  I've also tried it with leaner cuts of pork- don't do it- they aren't nearly as good as the butt roast- definitely worth the fat calories!

This was pretty good but a little salty for my tastes and the meat was a bit mushy from all that crock pot time.  I'll probably make this again but will reduce the salt and cooking time.  Maybe crisping up the meat after cooking in a hot skillet will improve the texture some and give it a bit more chew.

I LOVE this recipe...EVERYBODY loves this recipe!!!  I don't cook it as long (usually 8-10 hours on low) because I never think that far ahead, but it's still fantastic! Last time I minced some garlic into it, just for the heck of it, and that made another great flavor...not sure which one I like best as they are quite different from each other.  I usually throw some rice & shredded cabbage onto my plate  and mix it altogether to cut the saltiness, but honestly, I wouldn't want it any less salty as it adds to the authenticity of the Hawaiian flavor.  Good stuff!!!  Thanks so much for sharing!

This is so good! Couldn't find Hawaiian sea salt so just used regular sea salt and it was still so good! I made half the recipe so I was shooting for the 16 hour mark. It was falling apart already when it was turned halfway through. When I woke up it had almost shredded itself. Super easy, super cheap, will definitely make again and again. It has a richness that makes it feel like you're eating a holiday meal! Thank you for posting this!

I have made this twice for groups and everyone loved it. The second time I made it, my roast was too big for my slow cooker, so I cooked it overnight in my roaster oven at 200 degrees. The meat browned on the outside and the inside was still moist. It was even more delicious!

I have made this with pork. But this time, I made it using a 7lb Turkey Breast. I added 1 tablespoon Hawaiian Sea Salt, 1 tablespoon sodium free liquid smoke, and 1 quart of Turkey Broth.  I cooked in slow cooker on low for about 12 hours. I separated meat from liquid,  de-boned, shredded meat, and added the meat back to the liquid. We put the barbecue on buns. Some asked for extra juice  on the plate so they could dip the sandwich.  It really came out great. The amount of salt and smoke was perfect for the dish.

I cooked exactly to the recipe and while it was very tender, I felt it needed more flavor. Maybe more liquid smoke next time and a good sauce to put on top.

Maybe my slow cooker runs hot, but I don't have to cook it for very long. Like six hours or seven and it turns out great!

This was good although I couldn't find the Hawaiian sea salt anywhere so I just used regular sea salt. I didn't know what to expect since I had different salt and had never used liquid smoke.  Very good recipe!

I love it!  It tastes exactly like the kalua pork I ate in Hawaii.  Yes it is fatty, but that's how it's supposed to be.  Thanks for the recipe!   I didn't have liquid smoke, but I did have some extra bold smoked salt that I bought at a wonderful spice store in the Napa Valley.  I used only this as it doubled for both the salt and the liquid smoke.  It was perfect!

Great recipe.  I found this a while back on another site.  Hawaiian salt was found at Whole Foods.  It might not be called "Hawaiian Salt", but the ingredients will tell you that you have the right one.  Look in the bulk spice section.  I didn't use as much salt as mentioned here.  Also, I covered the crock pot with aluminum foil to hold in the moisture.  Put the foil around the top of the pot, then put on the lid.  Most crock pot lids fit too loose for this recipe, since you don't add any liquid.  For my tastes, I got the liquid smoke that's just liquid smoke and water.  Not the kind with other flavors and ingredients like molasses.

With different flavors of liquid smoke available, I wasn't sure if mesquite would work.  It did!  Everybody loved it and already asking for it for the next party including New Year's Eve party.

Finally, Hand pounded pa'i'ai farmers sell their goods online. Mine and my wife's homesickness is less and less now that we can make two day old poi (wondered how I even lived with out it) every few days to go with kalua pig that is similar to this recipe, Tako Poke, lomi salmon. It's been a great benefit now that I started running training for a foot race. Mahalo.

Absolutely delicious!  Not to mention very easy.  The only thing I changed was I used 1tbl spoon of the white Hawaiian salt and a half tbl spoon of the black Hawaiian salt because I wanted a little more of the smoky flavor and it turned out perfect, I will not change a thing.  I'm looking forward to leftovers and frying some of the meat and making some carnitas.  I do not know how to cook at all but I did this and I'm completely satisfied as is my husband.  It gave me confidence that I can try some other recipes....I'm just getting started!

Sooo good! Had a 20 lb pork shoulder in a roaster for an indoor luau. We had 80 ppl for my daughters 1st birthday...in the middle of a blizzard. I turned up the heat a little and cooked it for 8 hours. As some suggested, I threw a sliced open banana on top and had Korean BBQ on the side for those that like sauce. Some people used the Hawaiian sliders or pretzel rolls to make a sandwich, others ate it over rice. Everyone raved over this. I thought it was just as good if not better than the luau I went to in Maui! Aloha!

Made this for supper today.  To die for.  It turned out so juicy and fall apart tender.  I think my slow cooker thinks it's a fast cooker as it only took 8 hours.  LOL.  Couldn't find Hawaiian sea salt but did find Himalayan salt.   We are having a luau at work next week and this is what I will be making again.

Simple and delicious. By the time it's done, I can shred it with a spoon! The most amazing part is it can be adjusted for anyone... I've made it for BBQ, added chili paste and made a killer Korean fusion quesadilla, added it to ramen... Very versatile, but good on its own too!

I made this twice -- once, to take to other people.  I cooked the pork shoulder overnight, and it was so tender that I didn't even have to shred it … it just fell apart.  Then I threw another pork shoulder in the slow cooker to cook for OUR family and cooked it for seven hours.  It did not fall apart as easily, and I could tell that it wouldn't, so the last two hours I put the slow cooker on high instead of low.  That did the trick.

I thought it was very tasty, and perfectly good.  Hubby and son wanted barbecue sauce on theirs (too bad -- didn't have any!).  I thought that the meat tasted great as is.  I'm trying to eat more Paleo-like, and trying to eliminate bread and sugar.  Hubby and son had theirs on a bun -- I had mine over "cauliflower rice" with a homemade pineapple salsa on top.  FANTASTIC!

We tried this about a week after we got home from a Hawaiian vacation, so the Kahlua Pork was fresh in our minds.  Let me just say....PHENOMENAL!!!  We have made this SO many times over the past year and have had nothing short of fabulous reviews each time.  Only thing is that it only takes us about 12 hours to reach fabulousness...not the 16-20.  Try it, you won't be disappointed!!!!!

Outstanding basic/key recipe - so easy & such a good result. I used an odd 2.5# cut of pork roast that was very fatty & it cooked beautifully. Used the original size crockpot to maximize the roasting capability of the crock & was out of liquid smoke so used oyster sauce which stank up the house a bit but gave a nice flavor to the roast; I suspect I could forgo any liquid in the rub & still get an excellent result (the pulled pork was served in various sauces so the delicate flavor of the plain pork itself isn't as important for us). I do believe that a certain amount of salt is required for the rub to help the meat give up its juices.  Now I'm eager to try this technique with a beef roast!

My hubby HATES pork, and was suspicious when I said, "pork roast" when he asked, "what's for dinner?" He ate a stuffed sandwhich, and extra meat after. Then he took it to work for lunch the next day. He ate it for Dinner that night, AND lunch again the next day. Very rarely does he eat the same thing that many times in a row. I cooked it for 19 hrs, and it was perfect.

I have to say, I was very skeptical when I saw only 3 ingredients. However, this is a very tasty recipe! I tried to follow the original recipe (However, I didn’t have Hawaiian sea salt, so I had to use my Mediterranean Sea Salt, Kirkland brand, from Costco). I used 2 boneless 2.5 lb pork “butts” (shoulder cut). I cooked on low for 20 hours as the recipe states. The pork was tender, moist, and not too salty. I will definitely make this recipe again! It tasted as good as the pork my husband slow cooks on the barbecue with out all the work.

We loved this. I didn't find it too salty at all but definitely didn't need to add seasoning either. I had to bail the grease out halfway thru cooking due to the fatty cut of meat. Fall apart tender roast. Thanks for sharing. Will make this again. I found Hawaiian sea salt cheap at cost plus after looking everywhere for it, if that helps.

Ok, if you want a bland pork chop that has the mild flavor of liquid smoke this is for you.

I was really concerned about the "too salty" comments especially since I rarely use salt.  I used a little less salt and just a little more liquid smoke.  I also had a tenderloin as I couldn't find a butt or shoulder.  Cooked it the day before and placed on warm the day of serving.  Everyone loved it.  Change from our usual Carolina style bbq.  Made a lot so might use it for burritos or enchiladas later this week.  Yummo.  For those complaining about how dry the meat was, not sure why.  I turned frequently and had to stop after a few hours as the meat started to break apart in the liquid.  It remained juicy and tender through all that cooking. Thank you for sharing.

I was so excited to try this recipe, having had Kalua Pig in Hawaii.  I followed everything perfectly, but it was too oily for my taste and could've used a bit more liquid smoke. (Both reasons, I do realize are my personal taste and have nothing to do with the recipe.) The reason for the 3 stars is because the pork can be transformed into bbq pork the next day and pork tacos the next.  Thank you.

Very good.  It was a little salty for our tastes but that's an easy adjustment.  Super easy to make.  Our children loved it too.

I have made this recipe several times and each time the meat was tender and full of flavor.  It tastes great by itself or with a little BBQ sauce on the side.  I think it tastes best served on Hawaiian Bread rolls.  I have also added some green chilies and salsa to make carnitas out of the leftovers (it was amazing!).  It is so easy to make.  I am often asked when I am making it again.

AMAZING!
So easy! Tender and delicious. Everyone loved it. Many of my guests asked for the recipe.
I found red hawaiian sea salt at TJMax Home Goods in the specialty food section and the liquid smoke at Target. It wasn't salty at all. 
The only change I made was I added a banana while cooking as suggested by many. After I shredded the pork I added it back into the drippings and turned the pot to warm until ready to serve. Then I pour it all into a strainer to remove the fat and served with rice and hawaiian sweet rolls.

16 hours was a bit long...seemed a bit dry.  We will be trying 10 hours.  We used CedarHouse brand liquid smoke. Amazing flavor as it's part hickory and part mesquite wood. Can get it on Amazon.  We did not find it in our local grocery store.  You can also make your own BBQ sauce...tomato paste, liquid smoke, brown sugar, garlic, onions, salt, and pepper, a bit of apple cider vinegar.  All to taste.

This is a great simple recipe.  I didn't think the smoke flavor was all that noticeable but it did add something...mesquite was a good option as posted by another cook.  I loved the shredded cabbage adding this 30 minutes before serving.  I also used Himalayan Salt and it did not over power the pork...i did add less than suggested as i felt we could always add some after shredding it...

loved it and will make it again.

Oh my this is soo good. Just added one extra ingredient -  fresh basil leaves halfway through the cooking. It gives an extra bit of taste without being overpowering. I will do this again at our Church's Hawaiian Luau in September. Highly recommended.

Great way to cook a pork roast!!  The texture was just like the pork in Hawaii, but the flavor was a little bland.  Served with some hawaiian BBQ sauce on sandwich and tasted great!!

This is a great recipe!! Flavorful and moist.  Easy to prep. Cooking time was 5 hours on high, shredded the pork right in the crock pot with its juices.  Excellent with hot rice.  Just like back home.  The grandbaby loved this.  I just need to find poi now.  Not much here in Tulsa, OK. for spices from the islands.

I sooo wish I could have given this recipe a full 5 stars, as I made this for a significant family gathering. I will admit that I did not have the Hawaiian sea salt the recipe calls for, and substituted the Mediterranean sea salt on hand that I use regularly. Since the recipe did not specify course or fine salt, I felt safe using the fine salt I had in my cabinet. I got a little gun-shy when I measured out the allotted 1-1/2T of salt, and backed it down to 1-T.  The results were disappointing...wayyyy too salty, and not "smoky" enough. I ended up rinsing 2/3 of the meat with water and adding it back to the crockpot to finish cooking. By that time, the salt had become "one" with the pork.Maybe my "salt-meter" is off-base, but my mother (who drives me insane salting food before she has even tasted it) admitted when pressed that it was "a tad too salty." (I DID NOT have Kalua Pork either of the 2 times I visited Hawaii. I would be willing to offer a revised review, should anyone like me to do so after they orchestrate my sampling of "the real thing" in the "Aloha State." :) Sorry KIKUKAT:(

Great flavor. It was a little salty but that may have been my fault.  I only used a 3lb pork roast but did't reduce the salt and liquid smoke. I only cooked it for 7 hours on low in my slow cooker and it came out very tender and juicey.  Well worth the cost of buying the specialty salt .

My son lives on the Big Island, and last year for my grandaughter's first birthday, we had a huge party, and some native Hawaiian's cooked 3 pigs for the party in the tradiditional way.  It was quite an experience.
I've used this recipe several times, and it is very close to kalua pig cooked in a pit, and much easier.

I can't get enough of this dish. I eat it with steamed cabbage and use red Hawiian sea salt.  If you make this you must use the three ingredients stated in the dish.  You CAN NOT substitue here even a little.

As is, the recipe was pretty dry - but served up on french rolls with warmed BBQ sauce? Pretty darn awesome. And you can't beat the simplicity.

I made the mistake of buying a hickory smoked piece of pork instead of just a regular slab of pork butt for this recipe.  I do have to say that it tasted better the longer it basted in it's own juices though.  I'm definitely going to do this recipe again without the hickory smoked pork

This was SO good!!! We used a small pork shoulder roast, black lava hawaiian sea salt and some liquid smoke. Cooked it on low for about 12 hours. It was so tender, flavorful, and best of all...EASY! Will be a staple in our menu for sure.

I made this and was surprised with how few ingredients it has how flavorful it was. I went a little easy on the liquid smoke and had to order the Hawaiian salt online, but it was worth it! Served it on sweet Hawaiian breads and it was awesome!

Just tried this recipe for a party and it was a huge hit. I used authentic Hawaiian sea salt and hickory flavored Liquid Smoke on a 7 lb pork shoulder roast in the slow cooker for 20 hours, turning over half way as described. It was totally falling off the bone when it was done... awesome! I also put it on a bed of white rice, and it needed no seasoning of any kind. It practically melted in our mouths. Will definitely keep this as a favorite!

PS... also served Creamy Green Beans Parmesan from this site. Went very well together!

This is a big family favorite and it is SOOOO easy to make.  I make it exactly as the recipe calls for--about 16-17 hours in the crock pot but you must have the Hawaiin sea salt or it won't be the same.  Then I make a homemade BBQ sauce with a vinegar base for people to spoon on the side.  I make this for all our big parties now--delicious!

This started out as a pork roast that was going to be smoked, but when the smoker would not worked this became the back up plan.  Should have started with this first.  Only changes I made were to brine the roast using the Basic Brine for meat from this site and I dry rubbed the meat with 1T chili/lime powder, 1 T chili powder and 4 T brown sugar.  Slow cooked on Low (with no additional liquid per the recipe) for about 20 hours and the meat was so moist and just fell apart!  YUM!!  Think this has now become my "go to" for shredded pork!!!!

We make this all the time!  I use kosher salt because I have not seen Hawaiian sea salt in my store.  I also use Stubs brand Hickory smoke flavoring.  It's not quite a strongly flavored as the regular liquid smoke so you can use it more liberally.  We usually serve it on hamburger buns with a NC style BBQ sauce that has been warmed in the microwave.  (It's a thinner, more vinegar based sauce.)  It's almost as good a Pit Cooked NC BBQ but a lot less trouble.

This recipe is so incredibly simple and so incredibly delicious!  Followed the recipe exactly -- just 3 ingredients -- and 20 hours later mmmmm-mmmm good!  My husband was impressed beyond belief.  Used a 3 lb. pork butt and adjusted salt and liquid smoke accordingly.  Served it over shredded cabbage with white sticky rice and macaroni salad.  I've already had requests to make it again!

This recipe reminds me of home! All the Ohana parties!! After cooking, I added cabbage and onions. Cooking still on low for a couple of hours more... cabbage and onions were always served with Kalua Pig. Being a local Hawaiian Girl, I try to cook foods that I grew up with for my Husband. And by far this is one of his favorites... next to Ahi Poke, and Chinese Rice Cake! :-)

Made this how the recipe calls. It was okay. I added more seasoning than called for, and it still tasted bland to me. I tried making it one more time, this time adding a half bottle of Soyaki. It was so good!

A hit for a Boy Scouts gathering.  I made it in a 6 quart crock pot and it was done in 8 hours. Followed the advice of others who said to remove juices, place in freezer, remove fat, and then return the natural juices back into the shredded pork. That was the key to a super moist, richly flavored, not greasy, fabulous dish. Btw, I was born, raised and live in Hawaii.  This is as authentic as you can get without using an imu.  Next time I will try putting in the banana on top.

I made this for my husband's birthday. I got a 4lb pork butt with bones (all they had) and cooked it on high for four hours...added 2 cups of cabbage and 1 more tspn of Liquid Smoke...then cooked for one more hour. I cut up some fresh papaya and pineapple on the side, made sticky rice (sushi rice) and bought some sweet hawaiian rolls. The only thing missing were the fire throwers ;-)

So delicious and EASY!  I make this at least once a month.  I would make it more often except this makes enough for 2-3 meals. :0D
I've started using pork loin & I always add a sm-med yellow onion (diced) to the pot.  I sometimes add some diced carrots too (anything to get some veggies into my kiddos) and the flavor is still delicious!

I have now made this 4 times, including once with the Hawaiian sea salt.  The technique is wonderful, but in my opinion the meat needs more seasoning.  I did not see any significant difference in flavor  between regular and Hawaiian salt. Also, be careful how much salt you use, as it has a tendency to be overly salty.   I will use this recipe always, but will add extra spices to the liquid smoke for a more complex flavor.

Living in France, I had to improvise somewhat, but still had spectacular results.  I used regular sea salt and liquid smoke (brought back from the US), and cooked a regular pork roast in a Romertopf claypot at my oven's lowest temperature for the 20 hours.  I might cut back a bit on the salt, but otherwise, my family raved about this :)

Making it for the second time today. First time was fantastic. I made a 5 pounder in about 9 or 10 hours and it actually shredded by itself when i tried to flip it once it was done. I added 1/3 cup of water and 1/3 cup chicken stock and 5 cloves of garlic at the bottom in the beginning and it really enhanced the flavor. Once it started shredding, I chopped up a small head of green cabbage and added it to the slow cooker, still on low, for an hour and then served over white rice. It's easy and cheap to make. About 15 bucks for 12+ servings when you can go to L&L and get their single serving version of it for 6.95. I'd say the time is worth it.

Oh soooooo so good! Very similar to what I had at a Hawaiian eatery. I used a 4.5lb shoulder roast, bone in. Cooked it overnight (about 12.5 hours) and used slightly less than 1 tablespoon of regular hickory smoked sea salt (not coarse, the kind that comes in a grinder, so between coarse and fine) and slightly more than a tablespoon of mesquite smoke. Yum!!!!!

Some interesting feedback for all of you: I only had the option of getting chunks of pork butt and shoulder @ abt 2 lbs each, so I got 2 butts (boneless) and a picnic shoulder w/ bone. The 6 lbs of meat *just did* fit in my crocker. measured exactly for salt and sprinkled pecan liquid smoke mixed with hickory on two cuts, and mesquite on the third. Only thing I changed was cutting a fresh banana leaf off our plant (look in the frozen section of Asian or Hispanic grocery stores) and put the pork on top, then nestled the rest between the cuts... because the recipe reminds me of puerco pibil, what I saw in a DVD.     I've had kalua pig just this past summer on our honeymoon and it *does* taste and smell like the authentic Hawaiian dish. There's plenty of juice in my crock - and I don't understand why people have said it's too salty. I used a black smoked salt (Whole Foods) and it's excellent!

I have made this recipe several times and it always turns out great. It brings me back to the seven years that I lived there. Just like the kalua pig we used to get at luaus.

This recipe is extraordinary. Pork, flavored with pork, yielding pure porky moist goodness. A MUST  try recipe and a real keeper. 3lb boneless roast took 11 hrs on low. I served it with mexican pintos, corn tortillas and salsa. Don't forget the lime wedges! Another time on hawaiian rolls with hot sauce and slaw.

Great recipe I used Hawaiian salt &Mesquite Liquid smoke after 10 hours I drained the liquid to remove the fat and returned liquid with out the fat and cooked for another 6 hours. With  left over pork I will saute cabbage and add some of the pork. Had this at a road side shack in Hawaii with white rice and it was wonderful. I have made pulled pork in ovens and crock pots and this has been the best recipe so far.

I loved the recipe but tasted salty. Will use 1/2 of the salt next time. Pork came out great otherwise.

I made this for a group of family and friends the week before my wedding. The pressure was on to provide a delicious meal and when I described wrapping a pork roast in banana leaves, everyone was interested. It was the only thing gone at the end of the party!! I can't wait to make it again. So simple and so yummy.

I couldn't believe such a simple recipe could be so delicious.  I made this for a cookout.  After shredding the pork I was afraid it wouldn't be enough so I cheated and got some store-bought NC BBQ and heated it up in a separate slow-cooker.  This recipe was SO much yummier!  I can't wait to make again and just freeze containers for my own use!

I followed the recipe except did as another reviewer recommended and added cabbage in it.  That was a bad move!Without the cabbage I think it would have been ok, not good.  We had to get BBQ sauce out.  Won't be making this again.

Made this recipe a number of times...and it is always a success and never any leftovers. We always use a lot more of the liquid smoke though.

Absolutely tremendous! I used pork shoulder (couldn't find butt roast) and red Hawaiian sea salt and Wright's liquid smoke. Absolutely awesome. I made two crock pots worth for a Luau party and everyone raved about it. Makes fantastic leftovers too! Two thumbs up. I cooked it form 9pm to about 5pm the next day on low, by the way.

I did a complete review of this on my blog. We LOVED it, super easy, super tasty --Def. serve it with some cooked cabbage and steamed rice to help ease the saltiness that the natural pork flavors bring out--Friends from Hawaii said it was "Ono Grinds" (delicious eats) ;-) Give it a try!!

This was so easy! I had a 9 lb. roast and it only took 14 hrs. to cook (I had it on high for 3Hrs.) I served it with steamed cabbage and rice.  Leftovers were great mixed with bbq sauce.  It's really is a "keeper"!

If you can't do the traditional Imu, this is a great alternative! It however didn't take as long to cook as posted, only took about 10 hours on low setting for a 5 pound recipe. The juices start to cook off if you go longer, and you want the juices!!!

This was fantastic!!! So simple too! It was just a tad salty, but I couldn't find hawaiian salt and just used kosher so I don't know if that has anything to do with it. Still a great recipe though!

I made this and cooked it a little on high then low then back on high and had it done by 6 after starting it almost 10am.  My husband loved it and thought it had a great flavor.  I didn't have Hawaiian Sea Salt because my store didn't have it.  I agree it was a little salty but I added sauce we like to it and it was great.  I will make again for our cookout.

This is a go to recipe in our household.  It is my husband's favorite, and his requested birthday dinner.  We don't cook as long, just about 12 hours, and it's still like the real thing we've had in Hawaii, straight out of the imu.  I don't change anything else. Wonderful!

This was excellent! My kids also loved it.  Had to order the salt online, but am sure we will be using it again and again.  Thanks for a great, easy and delicious recipe :)

I try to do different foods for my kids and one day they asked what do they eat in Hawaii?  So I came to allrecipes and looked. This is incredibly easy and has a ton of flavor despite the short ingredient list, I started it the night before and it made for a lovely lunch.  My five boys really enjoyed it!

this was some of the best pork I've ever had.  I used regular sea salt.  When I can find the Hawaiian stuff, I'll try that next.  I can't say enough about how flavorful this meat turned out.  Nice and juicy and tender.  I had planned on putting BBQ sauce on it for sandwiches on "leftover day", but it really didn't need it.  Amazing.

This was sooooo good! I served it with rice and stir fried veggies. I also made a very thick teriyaki sauce to drizzle over it. I will definitely make this one again and again!

Outstanding!  The best pork roast I've had in ages, plus it makes wonderful pulled pork-style sandwiches.  Once you find the Hawaiian salt (which is what gives it its unique flavor), it is the simplest of recipes.

I made this recipe as written except I only cooked it for 10 hours (that was plenty).  My slow cooker seems to always cook faster then most recipes call for.  My family loved it.  My husband said "it's a keeper"!

While on vacation in Maui I picked up some Hawaiian sea salt knowing I wanted to try this recipe when I got back.  Tastes just like what I had on the island, I served with cabbage and white rice.  I wouldn't change a thing, it's perfect as written!

My family and I love this pork.  It is requested by my youngest daughter at least every other week.  I usually don't measure the salt (use regular sea salt) or liquid smoke and it always comes out excellent!

Very easy to make. The pork itself was a little bland and dry, but that may have been my fault not the recipe. I found adding BBQ sauce after it was cooked was necessary. Good recipe, but I'm going to keep looking for another one.

I made this for a luau and had several people ask for the recipe. It was very simple to do--put it in the crock pot and forget it! I probably added double the liquid smoke to taste. I found the Hawaiian sea salt at a health food store. It truly made the party.

This was so good!  I'm lucky enough to have a niece at the University of Hawaii, so she got me the sea salt.  I followed the recipe exactly, but next time, I would add more liquid smoke.  My son and I couldn't stop picking chunks of meat out of the crock pot!!

Perfect as written!  Will add 1 more Tablespoon of Liquid Smoke next time.  The leftovers are frozen to make pulled pork sandwiches and pork enchilada's.  Very versatile recipe.  Going into regular rotation at our house.

This is my first slow cooker experience and I'm hooked! I followed the instructions to the letter (surprisingly, the Hawaiian salt was easy to find @ Fresh Market) and it turned out perfect. The meat was tender and the juice made a fantastic gravy with the addition of a little flour simmered on the stove. Leftovers were great with some barbecue sauce on rolls. I shut the cooker off after about 14 hours but an hour either way wouldn't have hurt it. I was able to take the bone out without any effort as the meat just falls away from it. The only thing I'll do different next time is put a little more liquid smoke just for my own taste. Overall, thanks for a fab recipe!

This recipe is amazing.  I can't believe the complexity of flavor that comes with only 1.5 tbl of salt and 1 tbl of liquid smoke.  I used Hawaiian lava salt and mesquite liquid smoke; both add a fantastic smokiness.  I used a 5-6 lb. pork butt roast and cooked it on low for 10 hours in my slow cooker.  It just fell apart!

CAME OUT PERFECT!!! I used soy sauce instead of smoke flavor which I will use when I have it, but it tasted JUST like family kalua pig. I slow cooked on low-low heat a pork butt roast on the stove for about 10-12 hours, then spilt half and made bbq pork for sandwiches, and kalua pig. Inexpensive, easy, cant wait to make again :-)

The recipe is delicious and after 16-18 hours, the meat is falling apart, so I don't leave it in for 20.  Also, kosher salt works exactly like Hawaiian sea salt, if you can't find it.  Also, cheaper, and they sell it everywhere.  I drain off the fat and mix the juices back into the meat to keep it moist.  Over hot white rice...so yummy!

This recipe is FANTASTIC!!  I followed exactly as written and it turned out great.  My slow-cooker finished a 6.5lb roast in exactly 15 hours.  I will definitely make again but will try with a tiny bit less salt.  I wouldn't say it was "too salty" but I would like to see how it turns out with a little less.  After shredding and putting back in slow cooker...it seemed to get taste even saltier.  So I will try again with less.  You HAVE TO try this recipe!  So easy and so worth it!  Husband and best friend LOVED it.

Guests kept asking me what I did to the pork when I served this at my husband's 30th birthday (they loved it).  I look forward to making this again soon.  I paid 14.99 for an 8 oz bag of the salt at a local health food store.  I will have the salt for many more times making this.  Served with Jack Daniel's Hickory Brown Sugar sauce and the Hawaiian sweet rolls (small dinner sized rolls found at Walmart).  The most time consuming part is taking the fat off, about 15 minutes or so since I am very picky about getting it off.  It was worth setting my alarm for 4am to put the pork in the crockpot.  About 13 hours on low, with the shredded pork soaking in the strained juices for the last hour.

Outstanding and so easy!  Because of time, I had the crock pot on high for 4 hours then to low for 2.  The meat was juicy and tender.  Plenty of leftovers that I will freeze and enjoy again in the future.  Thank you for the recipe.

I used a 3 pound butt and cut the salt and smoke in half and cooked for 10 hours and it turned out perfect.  The meat was so tender and had the perfect taste.  I was worred the salt would make it to salty but it was just right.

We made this for my Mother's 80th birthday party and everyone loved it. I even ordered the sea salt and now use it for additional flavor.  It gives food a slightly different taste.  We also grilled pineapple rings dipped in coconut milk that went great with the pork.  I do agree that it tastes just like what we had at a luau in Hawaii.

If your like me and not a big fan of liquid smoke you will still LOVE this recipe! Actually I many add even a bit more next time as its really mild and not at all over bearing in the least. It was however a bit on the salty side for me so I will decrease it next time.

I thought it was too salty, but only by a little. I will make again and cut back on the salt. I also think it would be fab with BBQ sauce. You would get a really smokey and tender pulled pork!

I just made this recipe for the first time.  With no changes or modifications of any kind it was amazing.  My parents liked it, my children liked it, I liked it.  Very rarely do we get an all around winner in my house but this is one that seemed to please everyone and best part of all it took me 5 minutes to get in the crockpot.

I made this for the first time this weekend, and it was awesome! I followed the recipe exactly, and it was perfect just the way it was written; I wouldn't change a thing. We ate the meat wrapped in warm tortillas, and we're already looking forward to dinner tomorrow. Thanks for a great recipe!

Very tasty.  Ours got quite dry in the slow cooker overnight however.  I added more liquid which helped but it was still a tad dry.

Fantastic recipe!   I made this for a bunch of friends this past weekend.  The only "change" I made was a bit extra liquid smoke and following the ideas of others I added onions.  My guests were thrilled with it!  I know this is going to become a favorite at Badnana's

I added onions and fresh garlic to make this even better.  It is good the way it is, but the onions and garlic put it even further over the top!!!!  My family likes to eat it with BBQ sauce on it.  I had guests who prefer gravy so we skimmed some of the broth off of the meat and made a gravy with mashed potatoes.  This is a very versatile meat without many ingredients or difficult steps.  Good standby for any occasion.

I made this with Kosher salt because I couldn't find the Hawaiian sea salt, and by 12 hrs it seemed ready. But I let it cook a little more thinking I had to at least cook it for 16 hrs and it dried up and ended up like bacon! Ugggg. Next time I'll just cook it for 12 hrs, it should be wonderful by that time. I made this with a pineapple rice that's on this site, and it was a great pairing! Thank you for sharing.

This receipe was sooo easy and tasted great - melt in your mouth!  I didn't find it too salty at all (used the Hawaiian sea salt, which I had a hard time finding - it was $11 for way more than I needed at a local chef supply store - but worth it because I will keep using this for this recipe!)  We cooked on low for about 14 hours.  For the last hour we took it off the rack (wasn't sure if we should use a rack or not so we started with one) and shredded it so it could soak in the juices.  Used it later in the week to make taquitos and then for a bean/rice/pork burrito.  It was so tender and delicious - will be our staple for any pot luck we go to!  (Will serve with small sweet rolls for sandwiches.)

It was pretty good but not nearly smokey enough. I used a 5.45lb pork shoulder. I added a lot more liquid smoke throughout the cooking. It was sort of bland alone so I added onion and garlic into the slow cooker and let it cook a little longer. Only took about 12 hours.

I finally was not to tired to put this in the crock pot on Wednesday night.  I had forgotten Sunday night to do it and then again on Tuesday night!  This recipe does take a little planning especially if you are like me and turn into a pumpkin a 9pm.  I followed the recipe exactly and cooked it for 20 plus hours.  I did not find the meat to salty and I could not taste or smell the liquid smoke after it cooked at all.  I would be tempted next time to increase the liquid smoke, but I think that may be a personal preference.  I certainly would not reduce the liquid smoke like some people have suggested.  The meat was easy to shred.  This cut is a little fatty, but I was able to clean it up pretty good.  I took the suggestion of one of the other reviewers and removed the stock and froze it for 30 minutes then skimmed the fat and added about 1 Cup back in to keep the meat moist.  On its own this is pretty ordinary shredded pork that I think you could use for several different recipes.  The way we choose to use it was to serve with rice and drizzle teriyaki sauce over it.  If you have a Rumbi's by you it is very similar to their pork dish.  It makes a lot and I have left overs that I will either do mexican with or bbq sandwiches. This is an easy one to do, would be great for a big crowd, but it is really nothing special or out of this world, but still worth a try for sure.  Thanks for sharing!

My local sandwich shop has a Kalua pig sandwich we just love. This is it's equal in every way.  I served in on crusty buns with green onions.I made it then froze it small batches. I have about 5 lbs of succulent meat for the proce of two sandwiches. This is a keeper.

Made this for our daughters 2nd birthday luau themed party (family & friends) and served it with little hawaiian sweet bread rolls and a dipping sauce from Maui that I got at the store....people LOVED it.  I didn't have the correct sea salt, but no one seemed to mind.  Have have since found the salt at Whole Foods and will try again this summer!

This was amazing! Salty in a good way, the way it's supposed to be.  I took another posters advice and cooked it on high for 5 hours, shred it, and on low for another hour. It came out juicy and delicious. Who knew 2 ingredients added to meat could taste so good?

I used only a 3 lb roast, but cooked the same amount of time and it was WONDERFUL! So tender you can easily pull apart with your fingers. One thing I added: I used a knife to cut deep slits in the meat and inserted thickly sliced chunks of garlic. I received rave reviews for it at a potluck dinner!

Absolutely fantastic!! My husband and all of his superbowl buddies couldn't keep their hands off it it!  We just couldn't find Hawaiian sea salt at our local grocery store, so we went with the Himalayan and the Mesquite liquid smoke.  I think I'll order some Hawaiian sea salt online just to see what the difference is.. I can't imagine it getting any better!  The boys ate it on fresh rolls topped with a homemade apple coleslaw.  I liked it all on it's own!

This was a great recipe! Everyone loved it! I had to cook about 15 lbs of pork for my boyfriends 30th and so I ended up putting it in the oven overnight at a low temp. It turned out great!

I am astounded that 3 ingredients could taste so good!  We liked this so much I've made it 3 times now and I gave the recipe on a card with a baggy of black salt to a friend.   The first time we made it we didn't use all the salt and liquid smoke, I wasn't sure it would turn out and the Liquid smoke has such a strong smell, but it was great.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this with a 3.5 pound pork shoulder and it was the best!  I did have this in Hawaii and wanted to see just how close this would come - hands down it was better!

Very salty and not very smokey flavor - I'm going to see if I can find a different brand of liquid smoke. I will try this again.

I started cooking this the night before.  Cooked it on high for 6-8 hours, then low for another 8.  Perfect! Couldn't find Pork Butt, so used a Pork Picnic roast, didn't turn it, kept the fat side up.  Very cheap cut of pork, but yeilded a lot of meat for the $.  I used Sea Salt, but next time will look for the Hawaiian Sea Salt, as I think it would make a difference.  I'll probably cut the liquid smoke in half as well, but don't eliminate it, it is needed.  It was very easy to pull all the fat off, take the bone out and shred.  Wonderful flavor, and made a lot of it's own juice.  I captured the juice and let it cool so I could take the fat off the top, then I mixed it back into the pork.  I will use this recipe again and again.

Came out perfectly.  I've had luau pork several times, and this was just as good.  Makes a ton too, so there's plenty of leftovers or can feed a lot at a party.

This was a very delicious recipe as is.  However, I wish the pig was a little 'saucier'.  I found it a bit dry and not like the kalua pig I'm used to.  But, it was still very delicious and my boyfriend (who happens to be Filipino and also has a mother who was raised in Hawaii) loved it!

Truley outstanding and very easy. For an un-authentic but lovely spicey-sweet alternative, add 2 diced fresh (seeded) Jalepno &  2 Tbsp honey Half way through cooking time.

Great taste agreed. Key is definately the Hawaiian sea salt. I put this together for the wife and I and she agreed it tasted just like the pig we roasted over the summer. Great idea for cold climate areas like ours. For storage I recommend straining shredded pork before putting into the fridge, esp if you have a good deal left over.

This recipe is awesome. You cannot get any easier. I took some to work, everyone agreed, it's great without any sauce. I am going with the lady who lived in Hawaii and cook up some cabbage to have with it. Thanks for the recipe!

This was ok as written.  It was definitely moist, but was just bland.  Didn't have the same flavor I remember from my days living in Hawaii.  My mom whipped up a sauce from pineapple juice and brown sugar that we poured over it that made it much better.

I love this recipe!  I have made it several times and have always recived rave reviews.  After shredding the pork i toss it in a pot with some raw cabbage and a pinch of salt until the cabbage wilts.  No oil is necessary because it will naturally come out of the chicken.

I'm going to make this for my next family gathering.  I had to make this before I bought Hawaiian Sea salt, so I used Kosher salt. It worked out great. I just added a few more pinches of salt and another T. of hicory smoke after pulling the meat apart and let it cook for 2 more hours.

I have made this recipe at least 3 times, it is ABSOLUTELY the best.  We eat it with the cabbage and over rice but it is so hard to not pick through the meat after you are totally full.  Very moist...if there are leftovers the next next morning we cook it up with egg, green bell pepper and onion and eat ina tortilla.  Great recipe!!

So easy and good. Needed a little stronger taste for my family. Taking the fat off is a good idea (less indigestion). I will make this one again.

I grew up in Hawaii, and love kalua pork, but had always assumed it was difficult to make.  This recipe proves my fears were unfounded!  It's simple and delicious, with minimal ingredients, and tastes very authentic.  I turned the crockpot on at 10 PM the night before, and by the next morning a delicious, smoky scent filled the house.  I kept cooking up until 5 PM.  The meat was tender and easy to shred.  A little salt brings out the flavor.  I'll be making this one again!

It really does taste like the Kalua pig I ate growing up in Hawaii!  Thanks for the great recipe.  I served it with sticky rice and the salty pork went nicley with the slightly sweet rice.

This is a fantastic recipe! The pork was nice and moist. I used black hawaiian seasalt and a nice hickory liquid smoke. I started it the night before, and by dinner the next night it was perfect!

Best recipe here!!

Easy!! Delicious!!

My biggest problem is making sure the piece of meat fits in the crockpot.  I've made it many times, and it always turns out great!

Mmmm...I did add one 15 oz can of chicken broth to the crock pot, in case it dried out. I forgot to cut slits into the meat before ribbing the salt and liquid smoke to it and it was still great. I added just a bit of garlic powder. Also, I just used kosher salt and it worked great! Served it on top of white rice with macaroni salad on the side. Really great, Thanks!

This is really good. My girlfriend from Hawaii poured the WHOLE bottle of smoke flavoring over it, which gave me a headache while it cooked. But the taste was not overpowering, a trifle salty in my opinion. Need to have like a creamy potato salad with it to tone it down.

OH MY GOODNESS, this was sooo good.  I made this for my mother and her bf and they both couldn't get enough.  I was not sure how it would turn out with no liquid in the pot to begin with, but the drippings from the pork was excatly enough.  I used the black sea salt and hickory smoke.  Once the roast was falling apart, I shredded it and put the meat back in the juice to moisten it, this is a VERY important step, otherwise the meat is dry.  Very good, can't wait to have it again!

Used regular sea salt & for buns I put on top of kaiser rolls. Served with grilled pineapples. Instead of pork roast butt used pork tenderloin instead. This smelled absolutely fantastic while cooking!

OMG, the best slow cook recipe I've tried! I followed es' (11/07 post) cooking instructions with a 2 lb pork shoulder using red sea salt that I found at Whole Foods (inexplicably in a display by dairy) and Stubbs' Hickory Liquid Smoke. After 5 hours of cooking, I sliced into small strips (wasn't sure how to shred and didn't have the time) and put back in the crock and juices for another hour. Tender, juicy, flavorful, melt in your mouth, great on rice...yeah baby!

Yummo!! I sprinkled a little kosher salt(the only special salt i had) and used about 1/4 cup of liquid smoke.  I made coleslaw and had potato buns and honey hickory bbq sauce on hand. The coleslaw, pork, and bbq sauce all went on the bun and it was heaven... Better than Memphis Barbeque who are known for their "KING" pulled pork sandwiches with coleslaw.  This recipe is inexpensive and even my 3 year old "loved" it.  Also bought chile verde and spicy honey bbq sauces.  I think this will be my go to potluck dish.  I'm even thinking about substituting it for my Easter Ham.  The Christmas Ham would be pushing it though.... Happy eating to all!

I of course had doubts about this recipe with so few ingredients and boy was I wrong! This turned out absolutely amazing and it was even great the next three days. I was amazed that the meat wasn't dry after re-heating. It's also so cheap to make; this will be a staple in my house! Thanks :)

This is really good!  My Hawaiian friend first made this for me and I HAD to find an identical recipe.  (She said hers was a family secret!)  This tasted just like it...so juicy and flavorful.  The first time I made it I put it back in most of its juices and it made me sick. (Because it was SO greasy.)  The second time I only poured some of the juices back on.

My guests liked this.  I thought it was a little bland.  Maybe more liquid smoke next time.  Great with the Pani Popo rolls from this site as another reviewer suggested.

This recipe is the BEST!!!  If you've ever been to a Hawaiian luau, you'll be instantly teleported back!  Minus the sun and hula!  It tastes JUST like the pork at a luau!!!  I made it with an island style rice cooked with coconut milk!  YUM!!!

This is also a great method for cooking the roast for mexican dishes.  Just rub pork with salt, pepper, cumin, and garlic; sear all sides and throw in the slow cooker.  Thanks

This is so delicious.  I have made this four times in the past month.  I used Himalayan Pink Sea Salt and it turned out fine.  You really can't mess this one up.  So simple and so little prep time. Perfect!

This is our family's all time favorite slow cooker meal!  We have visited Hawaii several times and have missed the wonderful Kalua pig...now we love it.  I do add about twice as much liquid smoke as the recipe calls for, but otherwise we LOVE this dish and have served it for several occasions!

Aloha! I prepared this delicious and moist Kalua Pig for my twin Granddaughter's 10th Birthday Luau Party.  Sorry our weather wasn't as good as the Kalua Pig,but rave reviews from all who attended.
I will definitely prepare again.

I am a big fan of smoked pork at "hog roasts" as we call them in the midwest and this is surprisingly close in taste without digging the hole or hauling in the smoker on wheels.

My husband and I just got back from our honeymoon in Hawaii. We had Kalua pig at a luau and my husband loved. I made this the other night and it was like being in Kauai again. I'm going to make this so many more times just to revist Hawaii.  I couldn't find the special salt so I just ground my own sea salt and it worked fine!

This was awesome and so so easy! I used a pork loin (what I had in the freezer). It's not as fatty as the recommended roast, so I imagine it didn't have as much juice, but was very tasty. Everyone in my family ate it WITHOUT adding any bbq sauce. (Unheard of in this home!)
I make this all the time with Cole Slaw. It goes perfectly with the salt fo the meat.

This was fantastic!  I made it for a Hawaiian themed 50th birthday party.  It was the first thing to go.  People were amazed at the flavor and wanted the recipe.  It was so simple.  I was concerned about not adding liquid, but as it cooked the juice was plentiful.  I will be making this again and again.

This was so easy and so good.  I knew I don't like liquid smoke very much so I added just a drop and it still tasted just like the Kalua pork you get on fridays at Noho's.  I'll serve it at least once a month!

This was the best pork I have ever tasted, and it was soooo simple.  I was a little short on the pork butt so added a pork tenderloin that I had in the freezer and it was awesome!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a pretty standard recipe in the hawaiian house hold.  I'm very happy to see it here.  

Another reviewer also mentioned Kalua and Cabbage.  It's what we usually do.  It stretches the servings out and tastes great.

If it comes out too salty you don't need to add the salt.  The liquid smoke is usually good enough for me, especially when my diet requires it :)

It's super simple and honestly, REALLY good compared to the other kalua pig recipes I've had made someplace other than the ground in Hawaii.

I went to Hawaii once, ate the most AMAZING pig, and have been sad at the thought of not having it again for a VERY long time - and then I found this recipe!

I used less salt (couldn't tell you how much less, I just know I didn't want that much) and stuck with the norm on everything else except the weight of the roast and the time. I do about half or three quarters of the weight (I'm only feeding myself and my boyfriend, and we have leftovers for days), and I only cook it from morning (about 6am) to when we eat dinner (about 5pm).

It's AWESOME.

I followed this recipe to a tee, and it was a little salty for my taste.  I did use the sea salt as directed, but only had a sea salt grinder so I ground fresh sea salt.  This may have made the taste of salt a little stronger.  Although, the additional salt tast did not stop it from being demolished.  I will definatley try this recipe again, but with less salt.

Cut the recipe in half  because this was my first time making and I wasn't sure we could eat all that pork (just hubby and I)!! This was just delicious!! I took the leftovers to my office the following day thinking I would have lunch for the rest of the week, but when my co-workers smelled it, they begged me to share. Needless to say, it was gone in no time. Use the 6 pound roast, even for a small family, trust me you will not have a problem getting rid of the leftovers!!!

THIS IS DELICIOUS!  So easy and so worth the time! I had just come back from Kauai and had my first Kalua pig at a luau. I was hooked! So, for Mother's Day we had a California luau and this recipe was such a hit! The best part is how moist it is because of all the juices. You've just got to try this...you'll even impress yourself. Thanks so much for the recipe!

So good.  It totally reminded me of Hawaii.  So so so easy as well.  Probably the easiest thing I've ever made for dinner before. I used regular sea salt and it worked out fine.  I'm sure I'll try the Hawaiian sea salt some day, just to see the difference it would make.  It also made delicious BBQ pork on sandwiches a couple days later.

This was very good. I did not have the Hawaiian salt, so I used sea salt, and it turned out very good. Next time I will use the correct salt. This is a keeper.

My family absolutely loves this. We eat it on hoagie sandwich buns with our favorite sauces (barbeque, hot sauce, mustard, etc...).  It also warms up great the next day with a little water in the microwave.

Did a 6 lb pork shoulder, bone-in to  keep it juicy, for 12 hours in the crockpot and it just fell apart.  The meat doesn't have a lot of flavor on it's own which makes it versatile for using in many dishes or just adding BBQ or other favored sauce and serving on a bun.  Freezes extremely well also.

Awesome!!I had a family bbq and made this recipe, and every one loved it. My best friend brought spanish rice, and the two together I could eat breakfast lunch and dinner.Ive made this recipe quite a few times with just sea salt so it was a little salty, but still awesome. Will keep lookin for hawaiin salt.

AWESOMELY EASY & TASTES GREAT!! Doesn't get much better than this!  I also think it would be good to make sandwiches from - you could even add bbq sauce.  Very nice flavor from the liquid smoke & the meat was super tender... its a keeper!

I was craving a roast but my husband got "over roasted" as a kid so he doesn't like pork roasts. He's been to a luau so I asked if he'd eat pork ifit tasted like that and he said he'd give it a try. I used a rolled roast instead as the store didn't have any of the suggested roasts. I used a 1.5 lb and kept it on low for 10 hrs. I also used sea salt as no Hawaiian was available. IT WAS FANTASTIC! What a new and tasty way to make a pork roast! My husband ate it up, with a little BBQ sauce he slathers on everything, and I couldn't stop eating it either! Yes, it is somewhat salty, but for a once in a while meal, it is delicious! Thanks!

We've just returned from Kauai and I wanted to try to recreate some of the Luau experience for my family.  This recipe is exactly like the pork served at the Luau.  My roast was bigger (10 lbs.) so I cooked it on High for 8 hours and it was perfect, moist and falling apart.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Very good... I was pleasantly surprised.  I could not find Hawaiian sea salt, but found sea salt from Spain at the grocery store and it tasted great!  Thanks for the recipe.... so tender and juicy!

I could not find pork butt, so I used boneless country style ribs, about 4.5 pounds. I cut down on the salt and smoke, (I did find the Hawaiian salt in Kings, an upscale grocery store chain in my area, next time would cut back a little more. Only cooked about 8 hrs. on low. Shredded and made sandwiches with slaw and BBQ sauce. A tasty change, but not as big a hit with the kids as I would have hoped.

Pretty good. I thought it tasted a lot like ham....only different. My family thought it was a bit too salty and didn't like it as much as I did.

This recipe is simple and to the point and is outrageously delicious. I used a 3.5lb boston butt and slowed cooked for approx 13 hrs. Next time I will experiment with some additional seasoning. Could use a little more kick. I did not have Hawiian Sea Salt and used Kosher Salt. Just a slight adjustment and I would give it 6 stars.

I was surprised at how tender and mild the flavor of the meat.  I did not have the hawaiian sea salt but used kosher salt instead.  I will try the hawaiian sea salt version next.  We used the left over meat with barbque sauce for sandwiches.  This was excellent!

This recipe was so easy and so good! Tasted just like a pig roasted in the ground.  I got the Mesquite flavored smoke flavoring from the store. There were 2 kinds. I used a 3 1/2 lb. roast, and the recipe didn't say to use low or high, so I used high overnight. I put it in at 7:00 and woke up at 7:00 (12 hours) it was fabulous! A little dark on the edges, but once the pork was shredded, it soaked up the oil and was perfect. I got alot of requests for the recipe. Next time, i'd probably try it on high for the first couple of hours, and then go to low overnight. High seemed really hot for overnight!

My wife and I just got back from Hawaii and were itching to try this recipe. At first I had my doubts about the flavoring from liquid smoke, but the results turned out much better than I expected. Very easy and an impressive, authentic taste. My mother in law makes Chinese-style pigs' feet for special occasions in the slow cooker as well. The results are very similar. After reading the few negative reviews for this recipe, I got the impression that the people who didn't like it were expecting something closer to mainland-style barbecue. Never mind the naysayers -  this was onolicious!

Wonderful flavor and very moist. I used regular sea salt as I was not able to find the other but I can't imagine it being any better. I used a 4 lb butt roast and lessened the salt to one T. Still used the T liquid smoke and only cooked for 15 hrs. My husband was shocked that it had not become as tough and dried out as shoe leather. Both my son and husband have requested I use this recipe again.

This is an incredible recipe for what is usually a very fatty and unapetizing cut of pork.  Made it exactly as is and it was soooo tender and yummy.  Might use a little extra liquid smoke next time, but well worth making.  So easy!!!!

This was so good, I froze the leftovers and used it for a last minute dinner, all I needed were the buns. It is worth all the time to cook because the end result is a meat that just falls apart with an incredible flavor.

Oh my gosh!  This is so good, perfect.  This recipe is in my crockpot as I type this for the third time since I found it three weeks ago.  It's no fail.  I did add extra liquid smoke and salt after I tasted it about 9 hours after it had cooked.

I thought it was too salty but otherwise very good.  My husband loved it.

Very good!  I ordered the sea salt on-line & it was worth it.

Tasted great, and so Easy!! I couldn't wait for dinner so I kept tasting it the last 3 hours before dinner time!! I also used it for shredded pork tacos (so good!). Thanks, will be making this one again.

This was so good. I was just amazed that this came from the crock pot. It had the best flavor. It did taste like something that was just smoked in the backyard in a pit. I will be making this again soon.

This recipe is fabulous!!  It will be a regular menu item at our house.  My husband and 14-year-old son couldn't get enough, and my son devoured the little that was left the next day.  It makes the house smell so good too!!  Thanks, Kay, for a delicious recipe that could not be easier.

Great dish! Made this with a 2.77lb Wild Boar roast in the large side of my duet stoneware, some cabbage cooked in a little chicken brothe in the small side, added a little extra smoke flavor at the end of cooking and did spoon out all the drippings and skimmed the fat. Easy!

This was excellent.  Could have been more salty for us, though.  So easy to do.

I was kind of dissapointed when I cooked this, because the reviews were all so good! I cooked the meat for the amount of time, and it turned out very tender and good. A very easy meal. And since I am from Eastern NC, I think next time, it would be good with some vinegar based BBQ sauce! I will cook this again! The only thing I didn't like about this recipe, is the way the meat smelled when it was cooking, very salty...

This recipe is as simple as it gets. The pork was very moist and flavorful.
