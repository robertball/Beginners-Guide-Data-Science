This is pretty darn good! I did add a few extra chocolate chips and some milk chocolate chips but it was great! Using it for cheesecake!

Soooo yummy.  Husband & boys wanted some chocolate sauce to go with strawberry ice cream & I threw this together in less that 5 minutes.  Just added equal amounts cocoa, brown sugar & milk.  Omitted coffee.  Added splash of vanilla, dash of salt.  Also tossed in a small handful of dark chips (needed to use up).  They really "silkened" it up even more, but tasted great without.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe.  Will make again!!

Good sauce!  Here are the changes I made  to better suit my palate: omitted the vanilla, added 6 tablespoons salted butter, used 2/3 cup packed brown sugar, used 2/3 cup milk, 1/4 cup milk chocolate melting wafers to cut the bitterness.  Sauce was like shiny velvet!   Thanks for the basic recipe and GOOD IDEA!

My family enjoyed this sauce served over a brownie/ice cream torte.  I used special dark cocoa to give it a deeper flavor.

The texture is quite good, though I'd need much more rich chocolate flavor to be truly wowed.  Good in a pinch or when I need something a little less decadent.

Very, very good!  A little thicker than I was looking for but I'll add a little extra milk next time.  Will make again!

This was simply delicious.  I made it last night for Valentines Desert and it was fabulous.  My husband was skeptical until I started making it.

This would've got 5 stars if it was called "pudding." The dutch cocoa gives it a dryness, and I suspect the coffee gives it just enough bitterness without any coffee flavor I can detect. In my pan, it came out way, way thicker than the picture, or what I was looking for. Thinning it out was, of course, a breeze. Thanks for the recipe! This is much less time consuming than the melted bittersweet I've relied on in the past.

This stuff is awesome. Tastes just like the hot fudge that you get from most ice cream restaurants. I can't imagine that anyone can improve upon this recipe. Thank you for sharing.

I live on a tiny island and can't find the vegan chocolate that I need to make mousse for a friend with dairy allergies. I just substituted the milk for chocolate soy milk and this worked out perfectly! I used it to replace the melted chocolate in my mousse recipe and it turned out very well!

I made 1/2 recipe just to try this out and got about enough for 3 sundaes. At first bite I could only think, wow this is it bitter! However, after I tried it on some sweet ice cream it blended together a little to cut through some of it. I do like dark chocolate, and that aspect of it sometimes, but I think this dessert sauce needs a little balance of some sweetness.

Excellent chocolate sauce.  I like that its not sweet sweet - we prefer dark chocolate - this was the way we like it.  I did add a tsp of vanilla after it cooked - and made it with "Coffee Rich" lactose free creamer instead of milk (since I'm lactose intolerant)

Loved the consistency but it was a little bitter for me. I added 1 cup of confectioners' sugar and it was pretty darn good!!

really liked this chocolate sauce. Nice, thick, and gooey perfect to drizzle over a cake for a little decoration. When I made it, I added a touch of rum for flavor.

Very good.  Loved that it had only ingredients that I had on hand.  I forgot to add the vanilla at the end and it was still great.  We ate it warm over fresh strawberries!  I wish I had halved the recipe or bought more than one container of strawberries.  Very fast and easy to make.  Will definitely make it again when I need a chocolate fix.  Much healthier than the store-bought chocolate dipping sauces for strawberries.  I used my espresso maker to make the strong brewed coffee and it didn't taste like coffee at all.

Excellent sauce and very easy to make. I did have to add 1/2 cup more milk to thin it from a pudding consistency to more of a sauce.

The only change that I made was to use diabetic brown sugar (my husband is diabetic) and it turned out great.   We like it for hot chocolate

Wonderful! Added a couple of squares of dark chocolate and 2 tbsps of Honey - just at the end because I had some left over chocolate. It would have been just as good without it though. My family loved it and would rather eat this with chocolate cake than icing!

This is a great recipe, only I need to make a quadruple batch! I didn't change a thing and the addition of the coffee makes it even better. Ans soooo simple. What more could you ask for? More I guess!
