I'm a big fan of ham salad and had bought a package of diced ham to make some. With the exception of the cream cheese this is the recipe I use to make
ham salad.  I had a package of cream cheese so I thought "Why not?" 
(BTW don't forget to soften the cream cheese.) I made this per the recipe 
with the exception of the relish.  When it was processed I split it in half
and added sweet relish to one half, dill relish to the other. As I suspected
I liked the dill better, but that's merely a matter of taste. Both were 
delicious.  I haven't tried adding any other cheeses.  I'm happy with what I 
have, so I'll leave that to a more adventurous member. 
Many thanks, badbabybeth, for a new twist (at least for me) on an old
standby.

Delicious!  The ham I used was mildly salted. The result was a fantastic flavor.  Since I had no cream cheese on hand I used Crème Fraîche instead.

Delicious!  No food processor, so chopped, minced, and blended all by hand.  Used a 1 pound canned ham which equals 3 cups after mincing.  Reduced mayo to 1 c., but will reduce to 1/2 c. next time and used only 1 clove of garlic (personal preference). Makes about 4 cups.  Really good recipe.   Will make again.  Spread on toasted bagels for breakfast.  Yum!

I made a half recipe to try it. I used half Miracle Whip and half Canola Mayo, cream cheese spread, sweet pickle relish, and Dijon mustard. It was nice that we could eat it without waiting to blend the flavors. My husband who does not like ham salad even loved it. I served it on an English muffin to reduce the calories even more. It was a very low calorie and satisfying lunch.

Delicious! I really LOVE ham salad and this was a great spin on it! I did scale the recipe back to use the leftover ham that I had. Also, I had some onion and chive cream cheese to use up, so I used that in place of the regular cream cheese.  This whipped up quickly and tastes great...I will def be making this recipe again and again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

It was so quick and easy to make. My 19 year old son loved it and took seconds. The flavor is excellent (as other reviewers said), but there's something about the texture and color that was hard to get past.

This is a great recipe. I only made 2 changes because of what I had on hand. I used dill relish and cream cheese with onions and chives. Other than that I followed the recipe. took it to a family gathering and my sister took some home as did a friend. Thanks
