Tastes O.K. Nothing memorable or special. Just a dish you don't have to put a lot of work into: all you have to have is time, since it needs to bake for at least 2.5 hours.

This recipe became an instant family classic the first night we tried it!  (Our 13 year old put it on the calendar, so she'd remember to ask for it for her birthday supper next year!!)  It was so easy, and tasted soooo good!

Loved this recipe.  I cooked this in the crockpot on low for 10 hours.  Served with mashed potatoes.  I will definitely be making this again.

What a way to start the new year!  Great for even the pickiest eaters.  Substituted pork chops for the roast, crushed tomatoes for the juice, no problems.  Thanks!

This was not a knock your socks off meal but it sure it the spot. I did it in the slow-cooker for 8 hours on low. Did all the mixing in there and did not use sugar. I didn't mean for it to be pulled but it fell apart so I went with it. This couldn't be a more simple dish. 3 ingredients in the crock pot? Come on! Easy Peasy! That is reason enough to make it again. Thanks Cheryl Sallaz
