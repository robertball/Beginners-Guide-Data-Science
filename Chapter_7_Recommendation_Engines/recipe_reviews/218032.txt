These are crazy good. The meatballs and the sauce are outstanding. I thought the batter was much too soft so i added an extra 1/4 cup of cornflakes. It was still too soft and the balls all "melted" together when I baked them so it turned out more like meatloaf but so delicious. Maybe next time I will use 1 1/2 cup of cornflakes or only 4 eggs. I used a lot more onion and replaced about 1/2 cup shredded cheese with cottage cheese. I also added the sauce after about 25min so it would cook longer. I wouldn't cook it more than 40min next time since it was a bit dry at 50min. This is similar to the vegetarian sweet and sour meatballs but uses cornflakes and your own seasoning instead of breadcrumbs. They are both delicious and very similar but I prefer to use the organic cornflakes cereal instead of seasoned breadcrumbs which is often filled with unhealthy ingredients. Next I will try them in a tomato sauce. Can't wait to make them again!!

I actually posted this recipe. I just wanted to point out that if you exchange the cheese with cottage cheese it will add a lot of moisture and will definitely make it too soft. You can replace the cheese with crumbled tofu and that works really well. Freeze the tofu first because it changes the texture a bit. Then make sure you squeeze out the excess liquid from the tofu before crumbling it and adding it to the recipe. Lastly I have since made this recipe by exchanging the oil for water (there's already enough fats from the nuts) and didn't really notice a difference. So that's a good option too.

Made this last night the only change was to make into 4 small loaves. It was very good will make again. Will probably omit the vegatable oil I dont think it will make a difference.

These are amazingly good! I avoid eggs when possible so substituted 2 tablespoons corn starch and 2 tablespoons water mixed together for each egg and the consistency was perfect! Don't think it compromised the flavor at all. Will be making again - the whole family - including two teenagers - loved them!!
