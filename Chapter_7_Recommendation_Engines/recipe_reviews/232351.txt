I also added 1/2 cup of butter to the chocolate, since I didn’t have a double broiler. I took the pie out after the suggested cooking time, and realized it needed a little more time. I changed the temperature to 500 degrees, and left the pie in for five more minutes - it came out perfect. If you’re a chocolate lover, you will LOVE this pie! It’s rich and decadent, with pecan-y goodness. I suggest pairing it with ice cream, since it’s so rich.

It was pretty good but not my favorite. I think it's my fault though Bc I used some leftover walnut pieces and they tasted stale. My other family members liked it though.

Excellent pie - definitely on my favorites list! I did add 1/2 cup butter with melted chocolate - was concerned about it not having any - turned out wonderful!
