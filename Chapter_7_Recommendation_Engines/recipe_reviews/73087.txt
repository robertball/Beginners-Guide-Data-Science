I'm not sure what it took to make this bread, but, oh my, it was GOOD! I got home from work today to find this delicious bread on the counter, and I thought to myself: "this is the best bread I've ever had". So, I recommend it! -Husband Note from "wife": I had to add more flour, but it didn't seem to matter. This bread is GOOD! I used a .4 oz pack of ranch dressing because that is what I had on hand. Also, something is wrong with the cooking time. After 20 min at 350, I realized that the bread was still very raw and hiked up the temp to 375 for 20 more min.

So, I recommend it!

I really wanted to try this recipe out in my 2 lb bread machine on the dough cycle and it worked perfectly! The only change I made was to use 3 tsp of bread machine yeast and to take it out about 30 minutes before the dough cycle completed. Measurements for all the other ingredients stayed the same. I was watching it so it wouldn't over flow while rising and taking it out 30 minutes early is just right.  I shaped it into one braid and one regular loaf and put them into two 9 1/2 by 5 1/2 loaf pans, let them rise 60 minutes, then baked at 350 for 30 minutes.  Delicious flavor, great texture, perfect warm with some butter, also great grilled cheese and sandwich bread.  Love the ranch flavor!

Very flavorful bread.  The name throws me for a loop, bc I don't think of ranch seasoning when I think of herb breads.  Other than the name, though, this is a very soft, flavorful bread that's good plain, with butter, or with cheese as a nice sandwich.  I baked at 375 for 35 mins instead, as I've made tons of bread and that setting is tried and true for my oven.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great easy recipe. I read this about a year ago and have made it many times since then. The family loves this bread and is always begging me to make it again. Sometimes I leave out the Ranch mix for a simple white bread. Good job!

Just made a loaf of this bread and am eating it fresh out of the oven! I made this recipe as an attempt at a simple buttermilk loaf, leaving out the dressing mix. I had to add a LOT more flour than called for to get the dough where I could even handle it enough to knead, so I was worried it would come out too dense, but it gave a nice, light, fluffy loaf with a good texture. Nothing fancy but good for a simple loaf.

This is a really great bread.  I have to admit that we left out the ranch dressing, but the recipe itself was delicious.  Moist and delicious inside, bit crusty outside.  And it froze beautifully.

This bread is dangerously good.  My roommate and I ate 1 1/2 loaves within 30 minutes after pulling it out of the oven.  It has a beautiful golden crust, and the inside is like velvet.  It is delicious with, or without butter, with cheddar cheese melted on top.

I did wind up leaving it in the oven for 30 minutes instead of the prescribed 20, but I didn't need to raise the temperature at all.  Ovens vary!

Thank you so much for this recipe.  I will use it until I become obese!

Great bread!  Great directions!  Only thing I would change is the cooking time. 20 minutes isn't nearly enough.  (I left it in for 35-40.)  2nd time I made this bread I subbed the ranch packet for herbs from my spice rack.  The ranch packet made the bread a little too salty.

Very yummy!  I ran into some problems with the flour when making it, though -- 5 cups resulted in dough with the approximate consistency of cake batter, and it took almost two more cups to get it to a consistency I was comfortable with.  I would also recommend cutting the amount of ranch dressing mix in half because I think that flavor is a bit overwhelming -- good, but a little strong.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was an easy bread to make, and it tasted good, but not as good as I was hoping for.  Both my husband and I had a piece right out of the oven, and it was just sort of bland, but I am not sure what it is missing.  He did toast a piece later on and liked it better toasted.

This is a nice soft bread.  I must admit I had my reservations when I saw it called for a package of ranch dressing mix since I'm not particularly fond of ranch but was pleasantly surprised with the results.  I didn't have buttermilk so I used 1 1/2 tsp of vinegar in regular milk.  I missed eating a piece right out of the oven which I'm sure would've been super yummy but it made a GREAT sandwich the next day!

I make a lot of bread, once a week for the last 12 years. Usually it's a crusty Italian loaf and when I'd try other recipes they came up short. But the other day I wanted a soft sandwich bread and refused to pay over $5 a loaf at the market. 

This buttermilk herb bread is a new favorite. It browns beautifully, has a soft interior perfect for sandwiches. The ranch dressing mix give a lot of flavor without screaming herb bread, so it would work as well for peanut butter and jelly. The bread is still soft and fresh after 3 days on the kitchen counter. Because we don't eat bread real fast, I slice the entire loaf then freeze half. It's just as good after I defrost it. And makes good toast, too!

I, too, tried this in my 2 pound loaf bread machine and took it out before the dough rose to the lid.  I shaped it into two loaves and let is rise as the recipe indicated.  The bread was light and flavorful.  The next day, it made yummy grilled cheese sandwiches.

This was a GREAT bread!  I didn't have any ranch dressing on hand so I used "Good Seasons Zesty Italian" powdered dressing and it was wonderful.  It got a slight garlicy flavor that will enchance any bland lunch meat and cheese sandwich.  It is a nice, soft bread that holds up for use in sandwiches.  Very nice flavor.  I will try to make it with ranch dressing and with no dressing, to see if there is any change.  Thank you for sharing this.

Perhaps my oven is off. The bread did not golden.
Not too fluffy either!

Didn't care for the ranch dressing taste.  It's okay tasting bread but if I make it again I think I'll leave out the ranch dressing.  I baked it longer than the recipe recommended.  I baked it at 350 degrees for almost 35 min.  The bottom did get a little browner than it should but tasted okay.  My search for the perfect home made loaf of bread continues

I baked this recipe today and followed the instructions exactly. The crust never did brown, even though I baked it longer than the instructions called for. Worse yet, when I cut into the loaf, the center is still raw. I made it into a tight roll and tucked under the ends and placed it seam side down in the pan, but not only was it not cooked thru, but there was a hole in the middle of the loaf. I don't think I will be baking it again, even though it had a good taste.
