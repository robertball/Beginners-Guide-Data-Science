A good intro to making corn pudding!  If you want to make the pudding more custard-like, I would recommend you use one can evaporated/condensed unsweetened milk instead of heavy cream.  That will also cut down on a lot of fat!  Also, I would only add 1 or 1/2 cups of sugar because it would be way to sugary.  Try using sweetened corn instead - like Green Giant Niblets.  Adding a bit of vanilla will spice it up as well.  Enjoy!

Loved it, but I changed it a bit to make it more of a sweet pudding.  I added 3/4 cup of sugar (instead of 3 tablespoons) and I added vanilla.  Made as it is in the original recipe it is very salty.

It was way too salty!  If I were to make it again, I would only put 1 tsp of salt. I added lots of sugar to compensate for all the salt but it was still very salty.  I was very disappointed.

Great recipe!  I usually make my mom's recipe, but tweeked hers to "jive" with this one.  I did as a couple reviewers suggested.  I used evaporated milk for 1/2 of the heavy cream amount and heavy cream for the rest.  I also added vanilla (1 t) as per my mom's recipe, and added more sugar,(3/4 c) also as per mom's recipe.  I left off the salt, because I felt the salted butter would be enough (it was for us).  I used 1 can of creamed corn and the rest frozen fresh corn (maybe a little extra fresh frozen corn) and it turned out great!

I normally do not make microwaved meals, but I needed something quick for a last minute invite to a potluck.  I made it exactly per the instructions and no one liked this dish. It was very salty, and the overall taste just didn't mesh.

This turned out wonderfully well, even though I made some major changes. Because I didn't really follow the recipe, I didn't feel comfortable giving 5 stars.   Here's what I did: I didn't have whole kernel corn so I used creamed corn.  I don't use granulated sugar at all and subbed crystallized fructose, but upped it to 3/4 c. Since I used creamed corn, I upped the eggs too.  I probably have something totally different than the original recipe!  But even so, what came out of the microwave was delicious, and I used this recipe for a base. One thing I'll bet, this recipe is pretty good as written, even though I didn't make it that way.  Thanks for sharing!    BTW, next time I try this recipe, I'm going to sub sucralose (Splenda brand) for the sugar.  The fructose didn't work so well for a custard.  The pudding turned out well, but there was a lot of watery, sweet juice to it.  I figure that's because the fructose, once dissolved, does not crystallize again.
