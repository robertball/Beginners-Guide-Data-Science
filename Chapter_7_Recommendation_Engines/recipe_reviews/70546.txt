We love this recipe!! It has great flavor and lots of spice.  The second time I made it I cut back on the peppercorns and the pepperflakes.  I always trim the fat off the brisket.  I put it on low in the crockpot for 7 hours.  It was so tender!

This was a great brisket recipe! The meat was spiced all the way through and was quite tender for a brisket. I used slightly less allspice than it called for due to personal preference. The broth made a WONDERFUL gravy that we used to dip hot biscuits into. I had unexpected dinner guests the night I made it and they all raved about it! We'll make it again for certain!

We all loved this recipe, including my two picky kids.  The meat was tender and lightly flavoured, the gravy was superb.  I just wish I had made more 'cause there wasn't any left over for lunch.

I added a diced onion to the stock, and used whole instead of ground allspice, but otherwise followed the recipe.

This was pretty good. I did skip the allspice since I didn't have any and used lotsa garlic.  Lots.  Did I mention I used a lot of garlic?  Oh, and I used some red wine instead of white... it is red meat, afterall.  Turned out nice.  Made gravy with the remaining juice.  I definitely would not consider this spicy at all.

Nothing special at best.  

I cooked as directed except cutting the seasoned salt amount in half out of consideration for the amount of sodium in commercial broth.  Upon tasting at the two-hour mark, I was disturbed that all I could taste was pepper, so I removed as many of the black peppercorns as I could at that point and added in the half a teaspoon of the allspice I had withheld based on another cook's comment.  I hoped the full dose of allspice would mellow it out but could not taste it in the end.

The final product was bland boiled beef with beef broth with a lot of heat, at least for this Northerner, but no taste.  It is edible, but felt this was not worth the effort and definitely will not make again.

Nothing special here. The beef ended up tough.  Even though we added extra corn starch the gravy was soupy and very oily, and in spite of the extra spices and garlic the flavor was bland.

I made this recipe for my brother last weekend while staying at his home. I forgot my recipe for beef brisket and turned to All Recipes.  I was not able to find brisket at his local store, so i purchased 2 lbs of top round.  I follows the instructions and put it in the crock pot for 7 hours on low then pulled the meet apart then, placed the meat back in the crock pot for about 1 1/2 hrs.  I follow up with my brother the following day to see how he enjoyed the sandwiches.  HE LOVED IT!!! COULD NOT STOP EATING THE MEAT!!!  thanks for such a great treat for him.

Absolutely fantastic!  Simple to prep...took just a minute and was just stuff from the pantry.  And the family gobbled it up!  It was so good that my kids begged to have another meal of it at 9pm!  Seriously, they just loved it.  Not too spicy, just perfect.

You definitely have to be a pepper person - but my mom made this recipe 3 times, leaving out the cornstarch and wine, and going heavy on all the spices. It was spicy and delicious each time!

Lots of flavor with a bit of a spicy kick. I would recommend cooking on low for at least 8hrs or overnight. 3-4hrs wasn’t enough time to make the brisket tender.

This is our second time making this recipe. The only difference I do is cook it for 10 hours in a crockpot on low so it’s really tender. We put the brisket on corn tortillas and top with cilantro and lime. It’s delicious.

I started to make this dish and had to leave the house.  I placed it in the refrigerator for the next day's dinner  Doing that allowed me to scoop off the solid fat that was on the surface.  I reheated it and the taste was great!  Possibly will do this again the second time I make it.  Less fat.

I made this for Christmas this year and everyone loved it! Great flavor and the spice had just the right kick.  I marinaded the brisket overnight in a Lea & Perrin's Peppercorn marinade bag.  I added garlic and onion to the marinade.  I lined the bottom of the slow cooker with onion and placed the brisket on top.  I added the white wine, beef broth and other seasoning except peppercorns since it was in the marinade.  I slow cooked the meat for 7 hours adding more onion during the last two hours.  Followed the rest of the recipe instructions for the gravy.  We had no leftovers!  Next time I will add mushrooms for extra added flavor but this was great!!!  So tender!
