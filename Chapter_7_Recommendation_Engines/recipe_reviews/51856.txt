Definitely 5 star!  Used sirloin steak that sat in the fridge with steak seasoning on it for a day and a half to really absorb the flavors.  BBQ the sirloin rare and then thinly sliced it and set aside in preparation for assembly.  Carmelized the onions prior to making the sandwiches, then sauteed the peppers using green and red for color.  Added mushrooms for a more true Philly sandwich.  Used a variety of cheese; Manchego, Monterey and Mozarella.  My favorite was the Manchego which gave it an edge.  Baked the sandwiches open faced for 5 minutes to crisp the buns, then broiled until the cheese melted, bubbled and slightly browned.  The garlic mayo made the sandwich!  My family loved it.  Thanks Tera for the great recipe.

Superb. Based on comments read and my one Philly Phriend, I made six sandwiches. Two with provolone, two with mozarella, and (Philly) two with cheeze whiz. Provolone and mozarella were equal in outstanding taste. The cheeze whiz was good but not up to the others. Used everything the recipe called for except (above) and low fat mayo. Reheated leftovers in the oven, put in while heating to 500, when reached 500 took out, perfect. Micorwaved leftover sandwiches were not so good.

this is a pretty good recipe. As suggested by another reviewer it tastes great if you add steak seasoning on the meat in the Am and let it sit until dinner time and then there is no need to season with the salt and pepper.

Great sandwich, but misnamed!  'Philly Cheesesteak' is very specific to it's ingredients not a blanket name for any sandwich with cheese on.  Quite sacred to Philadelphians!

This was a really great recipe, especially the garlic mayo, and it was so easy to make!  We used red peppers also.  Next time, I may use sirloin as the meat was a tiny bit tough, and I will also add mushrooms.  You also may want to have them slice the meat for you at the grocery, since it is hard to cut that thin with a knife.  But overall, it was an excellent recipe!!

The garlic mayo just put this over the top for us! I halved the recipe, and added a teaspoon of tomato pesto to it as well as a 1/2 teaspoon of Italian seasoning. I used thick-sliced deli roast beef for the steak. For us the sandwich tasted like restaurant fare--it was garlicky and cheesy with a great mingle of flavors. An awesome recipe Tera, thank you so much!

I have never had a Philly cheesesteak, but this is real good. the garlic mayo made the difference. everyone in my home loved it. thanks for the recipe. this will be made over and over.
If you have a hard time cutting the meat you can put it in the freezer till it hardens some. once it does that take it out and it is easy to slice thin.

Wow ... is the bottom line on this recipe.  Only change was using my recipe instead of the Garlic Mayo. It is quite similar but has prepared horseradish and a few additional ingredients.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Tera ... fantastic!!

I can't even begin to describe how good these were.  I've wanted to try making Philly cheesesteak sandwiches for literally years and finally was brave enough to try them tonight.  I used provolone instead of mozarella because I bought provolone thinking that was what I was supposed to have.  I also used a red pepper in place of a green pepper because I prefer the sweeter taste.  My changes didn't make this recipe though, the recipe itself made the recipe.  Soooooo delicious.  I will definitely make this again.  Served with the baked french fries from this web site.

Turned out very good.  I added some steak seasonings to the meat and let it sit for about 30 minutes in the fridge.  I also used sirloin instead of the meat that was called for.  I used mozzarella cheese mixture with provel (our personal preference).   The garlic mayo was just the right touch.  Thanks for the post.

This is pretty good, but it's missing something to make it perfect...it needs a little more zing, but it's still yummy! Love the garlic mayo...I used no fat mayo.

These were wonderful!  My husband commented several times how great these were and my girls loved them too.  As others suggested I did add a couple different kinds of cheeses.  I toasted the buns, and on only one side I melted provolone under the broiler, then topped with the meat, added mancheca and mozzarella cheese and melted under the broiler, took out and added my sauteed onion/mushroom/green pepper vegetables and put the mayo/garlic sauce of the other bun. I make these exactly the same way next time.  I also cooked my veggies seperate from the meat.  And added montreal seasoning to the beef.

Fabulous! I did use sirloin instead of round steak..and added mushrooms (personal fav), but this recipe would stand perfectly on its own without any changes. The garlic mayo is amazing flavor addition!  Whether or not it's true "Philly" matters not to this Texan. It's a great sandwich no matter what ya call it!

Well what a nice treat this sandwich was tonight, I savored every single bite of it. I used some top sirloin steak cut very thin, recommend by my butcher. I did marinate the meat for a few hours in some Teriyaki sauce and spices. I also made the mayo/garlic up early so it had time for the flavors to meld together. I didn't want to over cook the meat, so I cooked in this order: The onions first until tender, then added the bell peppers for a few minutes and then the mushrooms, pushing each one aside as I added the next. The last thing I cooked was my sirloin meat until just turning brown, only a few minutes... then stirred it all together and let it cook about another minute. I also lightly buttered my roll prior to plopping my steak and pepper mixture on them. Put slices of Mozzarella on top of the meat mixture and then open faced under the broiler on low for just a few minutes, my oven was already hot since I made some fries. Kept a close eye and as soon as the cheese was melted I removed them. Generously spread the garlic mayonnaise on the top part of the bun. And I must say I'm not a great fan of mayonnaise but it made these sandwiches go over the top. I also think the little butter spread on the buns was a great addition to the flavor. My husband was a very happy man tonight! Thanks Tera.

I wish this had 10 stars because it would have been an 11. I sooooo love this one. I only did to different things I had sliced Mozeralla Cheese and since I did not have steak I used 1lb of hamburger and 1lb of susage and it was AWESOME!!!!!!! That was the only things I did differently and my husband said this is the best Philly Cheese(burger)steak he has ever had. He also said he really like the hamburger because none of it was chewey like sometimes that happens with the steak. My kids even cleaned there plates, and my father in law thought I went to a sub shop and got it. THANK YOU so much for sharing this.:):)

This is a pretty obvious recipe, but boy did it get some rave reviews!  My husband rated it 5 stars for taste and I give it 5 stars for simplicity!  I've tried many recipes for doctored up mayo that were much more complicated than this.  Now I'm asking myself why I went to all the trouble!  I sliced the meat thin, grated the cheese and made the mayo the night before.  The next day I came home from work, sauteed the onions/meat, piled it all on hoagies and minutes later had a fabulous, filling dish on the table.

Loved this! Best Philly I've ever had! Only thing I changed was that I seasoned the meat before cooking it.. Using salt, pepper, garlic and onion powders. This way the meat actually had flavor and didn't taste like just meat! It was AMAZING! Will def. make again.

This is not your traditional "Philly" cheesesteak. And all the changes everyone is making takes it even further away from a real Philly cheesesteak. That's ok. If you can't get the real thing it's ok to try and duplicate. Number one rule is you must have a superior hoagie roll or you've lost half of the battle. Number 2, use top round chipped steak. The rest is up to you, and cheese whiz is a rule in Philly but, I don't care for it. And, if you're ever in Philly, best place to go for anykinda sandwich is Tony Luke's..

My family loved this, but I did make some changes. I used skirt steak instead of round steak. I also used sliced mozzarella instead of shredded. I thought that putting the sandwiches in a 500 degree oven would make the buns too hard so I wrapped each sandwich in foil and put them in a 350 degree oven for approx. 8 minutes till the cheese was melted and they came out perfect! I did have some mayo mix left over and will make a little less of this mixture next time. It may not be the original Philly Cheesesteak, but it's still a great recipe!

Delicious.  I know it is not Philly-style, but it is so good. If you use the round, you should really marinate for awhile in meat tenderizer with some Montreal Steak seasoning. Only if you use a very tender sirloin can you get away with not marinading/tenderizing.  Another trick is to use your sharp knife and just keep mincing till the beef bits are very small.

WOW!!! My husband and I absolutely loved this one, and the garlic mayo totally made the sandwich! We made a couple of very slight changes- seared the steaks on the grill; sauteed the veggies while they grilled, then combined; also, we used garlic salt instead of plain, added right after toss-frying the sliced steak and veggies together, to blend the flavors and heat it back up. The mayo was the PERFECT touch- we made it as stated in the recipe- that may be our new favorite condiment! The garlic keeps its fresh, spicy character, yet isn't overwhelming. Overall, this is one GREAT recipe- thank you, so very, very much! :o)

This was FABULOUS! Made mine using the crockpot AND bought some thinly sliced steak from the grocery store (it came in a package called "thinly sliced steak" from Kroger. Put it in the crockpot with 3/4 cup water and a packet of onion soup mix. Cooked on low for 5 hours. I didn't have green bell peppers so I used a red bell papper - sauteed it in a skillet with olive oil, kosher salt & cracked pepper along with the onions. Very yummy  - hubby loved it, too!

I make this quite often now, it is such an easy and delicious meal.  I always add sliced mushrooms, and I often just buy deli roast beef to save time.  The garlic mayo is a must!

Excellent sandwich recipe. I did use others suggestions and used sirloin steak. I did marinate the beef and broiled it (too cold to grill) then sliced it thin and added it to the bun with the peppers and onions. The garlic mayo is a must. I have some picky eaters who aren't thrilled with the full raw flavor of garlic so I roasted a head of garlic in the oven for 30 minutes and then mashed it well and added it to about 2 cups of mayo, I was doubling the recipe. Next time I try this I think I might also make up some Sour Cream And Horseradish Sauce, I think that would go very nicely with this. Great easy recipe and yummy.

UPDATE: MADE THESE AGAIN, BUT THIS TIME, I USED ROUND STEAK. I WAS TOO LAZY TO USE MY MEAT SLICER (I STILL THINK THIS IS KEY), BUT WAS VERY CAREFUL TO CUT MY MEAT SUPER THIN. I ALSO DIDN'T COOK IT VERY LONG (I LEFT IT MEDIUM-WELL) AND S&P'D REALLY WELL (NO SEASONING THIS TIME AROUND). MY MEAT WAS VERY TENDER AND OH SO YUMMY! NOT ONLY IS THE THICKNESS OF YOUR MEAT IMPORTANT, NOT OVERCOOKING IT IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT. SUPERB! Nothing compares to the "real" deal, but even so, this wasn't bad at all. The garlic mayo REALLY kicks this up a notch! On the flipside, I think my hubs and I would have liked this MUCH better if our meat was sliced razor thin (albeit I tried my best to slice mine VERY thin). Although I used sandwich steaks instead of round steak (butcher's recommendation), they were still a far too thick. Bottom line, unless you slice your own beef PAPER thin (or with a meat slicer), your sandwich won't be truly "authentic." I'd also like to note that it's IMPERATIVE to remove your meat when you saute your bell peppers / onions. By the time my veggies were crisp tender, my meat was overcooked. :( Other than subbing sandwich steaks and altering the cooking method slightly, my only other change was seasoning my beef with Montreal steak seasoning about a half hour before preparing our sandwiches. Served with french fries and our favorite beer, this was a decent meal. Leftovers will make yummy fajitas. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Tera! :-)

Wasn't blown away by this.  Used thin sliced sirloin.  Was too expensive and not good enough for us to have again.

Not a Philly Cheesesteak but still a good sandwich. I wouldn't make clam chowder with tomatoes and call it New England clam chowder.

This recipe was really good the garlic mayo is a hit.  Round steak is a tougher cut of meat so I simmered it in beef broth, minced garlic and a little soy for about 35 min then I added the green pepper, onion and fresh mushroom.  I sprinkled them with italian seasoning instead of oregeno and they were very tasty.

This was a great recipe!  I seasoned up the meat with garlic powder and montreal steak seasoning and let it set for a few hours.  Also, I made up the mayo and let it set to really get the flavor through.  Will be adding these to our menu rotation.

This was declared a 'keeper' by the entire family after the first bite!  The garlic mayo is wonderful and really makes the sandwich.  Be sure to make the mayo in advance and let the flavors blend.  I followed the recipe as written, except used slices of mozzarella instead of shredded and placed the sandwiches under the broiler for a quick trip to melt the cheese.  Yummmmy, thank you for the recipe!

i don't like peppers so i replaced them with mushrooms. I took thin cut steak and marinated in dales chicken marinade. Then i tossed it in a very hot pan for only seconds. Meanwhile, i have a large onion and mushrooms slow cooking and the bread toasting. I used the mayo garlic spread and i was wonderful. now back to the meat... After quick cooking it i sliced it in strips. I heated the marinated and added a little more to it and threw the meat back in it. i places the meat on the toasted bun and topped in with cheese and melt it, topped it with onions and mushrooms. I served the marinade on the side as a sauce

Made this dish over the weekend and it was a hit. Wanted to try out the new electric grill I had recived as a Christmas gift, and this was the perfect time to put it to the test. I cooked the steaks first, let them rest off to the side for about 10 min while warming hoagie rolls in oven. Sliced steaks thin, and rather then using mozzarella cheese I served with grated cheddar and pepper jack that I already had on hand, placed sandwiches back in oven on low broil til cheese melted.  .. will make again.

These were SO AMAZING! I attempted to make cheesesteaks once before & the result was just so-so, so my expectations were low to begin with. These blew me away! 

I added some Mrs. Dash to the garlic mayo & used one green and one red pepper for color & flavor. I marinated the meat in some soy sauce, Worcestershire, & A1 for about an hour before cooking. I sauteed the onions and peppers separately with some seasonings & a little sugar to caramelize. The savory meat with the sweet onions & peppers was a to-die-for combination! I used sourdough hoagies and skipped the oregano.

FANTASTIC!!  I loved the mayo - changed it up with a little lemon pepper and it was amazing.  I also made homemade hoagies - so perfect - and used veggie cheese on mine (regular cheese on hubby's).  Great recipe!

Loved this recipe!! We used a pound of deli top round roast beef sliced thin.  Used one green pepper and one red and added a package of  mushrooms.  Only made half cup of mayo but used one and a half teaspons of minced garlic.  Also used provolone instead of mozzarella.  Came out amazing!  My fiance lived in Philly and said this was one of his favorite cheesesteaks ever.  Will use again.

This was great.. We made this in foods class in my High School.. We didn't use the green peppers because our grocery store was out. We also didn't the Garlic Mayo. Instead we used butter and some Garlic salt and broiled the bread a bit. Then loaded the meat and onions and lots of cheese. Then broiled that. We also didn't use oregano.. Overall this was a great sandwich.. I will be making this again!

The garlic mayo was a nice twist on this sandwich, but I used white american cheese as that is what most places in PA use when you go to the pizza/diner shops and order a cheese steak. Some places use marinara sauce but I liked the tang of the mayo better.

Wasn't sure about the mayo when I first read the recipe. But OMG was I wrong. The garlic mayo made this sandwich GREAT!! I just used sliced roast beef from the deli and put provolone cheese on the sandwiches. They are an awesome quick dinner that has become a family favorite. I can't wait to make them again.

My husband and kids are still talking about how wonderful this sandwich was.  My recommendations are: I sauteed the onions and peppers in olive oil first, remove from pan...I then seasoned the meat (I used sirloin steak) with sea salt and black pepper and seared on all sides in drippings from the onions and peppers.  I transfered everything, including  1/4 cup of beef broth to a crock pot and cook on low for 6 hours.  Served with roasted garlic mayo, mozzarella cheese and sautee mushrooms on bagette warm bread.  Yum!

I will agree that this isn't a typical philly cheesesteak.  However, it was very good with the adjustments I made.  I put montreal steak seasoning on the steak strips and sauteed with butter and the minced garlic. I find that for me, using oil cooks my meat too fast and makes it tough.  I added some worcestershire sauce as well and then added the onion, bell pepper, some fresh mushrooms and some italian seasoning.  I baked for about 5 min and then broiled for a few so the cheese got brown and the rolls got crispy on the top.  We didn't use any mayonnaise.  It turned out very well.

I have been making this recipe for a few years now and decided I should rate it. It is by far my husbands (and my) FAVORITE dinner. I love the garlic mayo. I do always add mushrooms to the veggie mix and have experiemented with different spices and do find I really enjoy a little worshirshire (sp?) and steak seasoning. But don't skip on the oregano, I think it really makes the sandwich. Italian seasoning works great too!  Thanks for such a great dish!!!

Loved the garlic-mayo! I used swiss cheese and was still awesome. I toasted the hoagie buns under the broiler first, then slopped the rest on, back under the broiler for a final melt....worth the extra 4 minutes.

I used the garlic mayo from this recipe, but added it to the spiced meat from the site's other Philly Steak Sandwich recipe. Together, they made for one of the best sandwiches I've had in a long time! Mmmmmmm!

So Good! as suggested by others I used roast beef from the deli sliced a little thick. I carmelized the onions. The garlic mayo was great. I'll make these again & again!

We LOVED this recipe. I made it only a few weeks ago and my husband has requested it again. I did make a few adjustments, I used left over roast that I quickly  sauteed, I added mushrooms to the onion/pepper mixture and I used less mayo than was called for (as per other reviews). YUM!

I loved this sandwich!  I used sirloin instead of the suggested meat and made it very rare.  I only used mushrooms and cheese and it was so yummy.  Agree that it needs another spice, or more salt and pepper.

These are our favorite. We get Kraft cheese that is chipotle and it makes these even more amazing!!! I mix the garlic with miracle whip instead of mayo. I also add Tony's seasoning to the veggies. Yum yum.

Wow, it was a winner! I made this the other night and my boyfriend loved it. Said it's the best thing I have cooked in the 6 months we've been together. The next night he asked if I would make more sandwiches from the leftovers. I did not use the green pepper (he doesn't like peppers) but instead, used mushrooms. It was fabulous! Thanks for making me look like a cooking pro!

This recipe was delicious! I made it exactly as directed except I used sirloin instead of round steak as I didn't have any of that and it turned out fantastic, loved the garlic mayo! Gave it a kick it needed! Thanks for the great recipe!

Very Tasty - easy to make.  I marinated the sirloin for an hour in Mc Cormicks smoked pepper, sea salt, garlic powder and olive oil. Grilled the meat then I used a home meat slicer to cut the sirloin thinly & uniformly.  The garlic mayo, which scared me....really pulls it together and puts it over the top. The mayo milds out the garlic so it doesn't have a " bite " to it.

This was delicious!!!!  I seasoned the meat before putting it into the skillet with grill seasoning.  While it was cooking I added salt and oregano. I also toasted the rolls before spreading the mayo!  Next time I will add some jalapeños and mushrooms!!!!!

Awesome!  I followed another reviewer's advice and bought sirloin steak, seasoned it with steak seasonings (+1 Tbl. olive oil), and marinated it in the refrigerator overnight.  My only mistake was cutting the meat in slices before marinating.  I think I should have left the meat as packaged, marinated it, and then sauteed it.  Although I marinated it with seasonings, I still needed to sprinkle it with salt and pepper after cooking.  Garlic in the mayonnaise is key!  I sprinkled the dried oregano (leaves, not powder!) on the mayonnaise that I spread on the bread, and it toasted up very nicely.  I sauteed the peppers and onions separately in 1 Tbl. olive oil - it took a while to cook and would have dried out the meat if I hadn't.  Thanks for the recipe!

Love this sandwich, followed it pretty much to a T. I may have added more spices to the meat but overall, I really stayed true to it. Two minor garnishment changes: I opted for Archer Farm's horseradish dip instead of the garlic mayo...and I added roasted pepper rings to the heated sandwiches. My fam loved these for Sunday football games!

This is a weekly favorite at my house. We use a thin top sirloin instead of the round steak. We usually skip the garlic mayo; it's not really a must for us. We like our food quite a bit spicier, so I add jalapenos to cook with the vegetables. I cook the meat with some soy sauce and a hot sauce mixture. I always cook the vegetables first and then add them to the meat once it is almost done. This way the vegetables absorb some of the flavor and the meat does not get overcooked. You can also change it up and substitute shredded chicken for the steak. Yummy!

a delicious take on an old favorite- also, with just a little tweaking, makes a great stuffing for a crescent roll braid.

We love these so much.  It's probably our #1 recipe.  We add mushrooms.  Outdoor rolls are the best with this recipe.  Delicious every time!

Wow, what a delicious sandwich!!  The only thing I added was mushrooms, other than that I made the recipe as written.  Everyone enjoyed these sandwiches and they were very easy to make (BONUS!).

This was yummy and full of flavor.  My daughter 13yo (who is a picky eater) said that this is the only way she will eat steak for now on.  She said not to change a thing.  I used red peppers as that is all I had.  I had everything on hand which was a plus.  My hubby had cooked a HUGE steak two days ago and I needed a recipe to use up the left overs.  This receipe is a total WINNER!  I would cook steak just so I can make this!

This is good. I made some changes. I used flank steak that we grilled to medium rare. Let it rest. I cooked red and yellow bell peppers, onions, sliced mushrooms, 1 tsp of dried rosemary and a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce in olive oil on high heat until caramelized. I cut the flank steak against the grain into slim slices. I took several pieces of steak and made a pile of steak topped with Swiss cheese on a cookie sheet under the broiler until melted. I  spread the garlic mayo onto naan bread, with the steak, grilled veges and some A-1. Delicious!

Not authentic Philly Cheesesteak but we loved this!  I used a sirloin steak and partially froze so that it was easy to slice very thin with a sharp knife.  Made six sandwiches - some with veggies and some without.  Added sliced mushrooms.  Simple, inexpensive and so fast, I will never buy frozen sandwich steaks again!  Did not use garlic mayo because I do not like mayo.

I had seen this on the recipe buzz quite a few times and finally decided to try it. I had to lighten it up a bit for health reasons, but not for taste. I used lite mayo and cheese, and only half suggested, and a lean cut of beef. I thought it tasted like something that would come from a restaurant. If I ever made again I would make sure the beef is close to paper thin and use a soft bun. It was a bit much to chew with a crustier sub roll and the beef cut a little too thick by the store's butcher. I would also think about dividing it among 8 small buns, instead of 4, as 1/2 sandwich would have been plenty. I think the garlic and oregano really added extra flavor. I can see why there are a lot of high ratings for this sandwich.

THIS IS AWESOME. But I did some things differently... Cut the steaks into thin strips & seasoned with steak spice then let marinate roughly 2 hours (overnight would be best to infuse the flavour more). I then prepared the garlic mayo using the mayo, 3-4 cloves of garlic & a tsp. of wasabi (horseradish) powder to intensify the 'kick'; let it meld in the fridge for a few hours. I caramelized onions and mushrooms until they were golden then used the leftover butter/EVOO to saute green & red bell pepper strips which were seasoned with S&P. Cooked the steaks med-rare (more rare than med). Assembled as such: sour dough bread, garlic mayo, steak, pepper mixture, onion-mushroom mixture & cheese. Cooked as directed. Grated the mozza and mixed it with the oregano. Toasted the tops of the sandwich in a frying pan (they were also spread with the garlic mayo). WOAH, so good. These will definitely make it on my menu as a treat every so often! Served it with a green salad.

Unlike a lot of other recipes on here, this doesn't need a bunch of modifications to make good, it's perfect as is. I already had thinly sliced rib eye from the Asian market that I used for this, which worked out great. I also used lite mayo which helps cut back on the calories quite a bit. Can't wait to have this again!

AS WRITTEN 4 STARS,  MADE THIS SANDWICH FOR DINNER TWICE, FIRST TIME USED THE STORE BRAND THINLY SLICED MEAT.  WE LIKE OUR FOOD SEASONED SO I ADDED WORCHESHIRE STEAK SEASONING AND A DASH OF LIQUID SMOKE.  MY BF DOESNT LIKE MAYO SO I TOASTED IT INTO THE BREAD, HE LIKE IT.  SECOND TIME I USED SLICE ROUND STEAK,  PREFER THE FROZEN THIN SLICED KIND.

I'm giving this five stars as I have made this several times over!  This is soooo good, I love how easy it is to make.  I didn't have any beef round steak, so I used some New York strips, it was just yummy. my son just loves it.  Thanks for sharing this Tera!

This was a great sandwich!!  I loved the garlic mayo!  I did season the mayo with some salt and maybe a tablespoon of italian dressing though because of the "bland" complaints.  I always use sirloin steak as well because round steak has a tendency of being tough.  (I always use sirloin for any type of stew, etc., always comes out tender)  Slicing while just a little frozen always makes it really easy too!  Thanks for posting!

I love cheesesteak sandwiches.  This was very good and the garlic mayo was a nice addition.  My strips of steak weren't as tender as I would prefer.  Maybe next time I will try cooking the meat in a crockpot as recommended by another reviewer or my new pressure cooker!

These sandwiches were really very good! I made the mayo with garlic powder out of pure laziness & add some Parmesan cheese to it as well. I made the steak and let it simmer till mostly tender,  adding some Worcestershire sauce to give it a little sauce. I put the sandwiches together and added the cheese and popped it in the nuker to melt the cheese.Wonderful flavor!I put pickled jalapenos on the side for a little heat.Perfect:) Thank You Tera!!  I will be making these again!!

This was pretty good. I used some leftover steak I had cooked and sliced it up with seasoning etc. I used mayo on the bread and added the garlic powder. I probably will add more next time though. I recommend NOT toasting the bread. I used hoagies and they came out looking perfect, but they were just hard and distracted from meat and cheese inside. But I did add some blue cheese crumbles, that was really yummy! Also used provolone and some cheddar with portabello mushrooms.

I made these sandwiches for dinner the other night and they turned out great! I did make a few changes, however. First, I used sirloin steak and I first rubbed it with Montreal steak seasoning and then slow cooked it for a couple hours on high in some Italian dressing, beer, and beef stock. Then, I cut it into thin strips (which is much easier to do after its cooked!) and threw it in a wok with the onions and peppers (I used one red, and one green) with some olive oil, and heated on medium-high heat until the veggies were tender. This was the first time both me and my husband had had Philly cheese steaks and they were great! And I'm sure more healthier than most restaurants' versions! Will definately make these again!

Incredibly tasty sandwich!  I used one green and one red bell pepper and added some fresh mushrooms.  Instead of using oil to cook the meat, I threw it in a pan with some soy and Worschestire to give it some more flavor.  Used provolone instead of mozzarella, since it was on sale.  This was my first time making these sandwiches and it certainly won't be my last!  Thanks!

Made this last night, in a little different way:  Use sirloin steak, cut into strips seasoned with Cavendar's Greek seasoning, put in a foil pouch and cooked on gas grill.  In another foil pouch put green peppers and red onion slices and cooked that on the grill.  Took a loaf of french bread sliced in half horizontally and toasted in oven, put meat, peppers,and onions on top, placed swiss cheese on top of that then let cheese melt in oven.  Used the garlic mayo also and it was wonderful....it made the sandwich complete, don't skip it!

This was really good! The reason I give it four stars instead of five, is I didnt feel like the meat that the recipe called for was right. Or maybe not what I was used too!? I like super thin and mine came out more of like a fajita style...probably something I did wrong!? So I think next time I will follow others suggestions and get a different kind of meat, maybe even a roast beef from the deli counter? The garlic mayo really did make it wonderful though! Never thought of mixing the two!

Excellent. I tried to make Philly cheesesteak sandwiches like those we ate in Philly. First mix up the garlic mayo - it's delicious.  I carmelized onion and set aside.  We do not like green peppers so I skipped those. I used sirloin, sliced thin by the meat dept.  I may try to use ribeye next time, because ribeye meat is so much more tender and has more flavor (it's just harder to slice thin).   I sliced the meat into strips of uniform size.  Cooked meat according to directions.  Sliced and toasted ciabatta rolls in the oven. Spread mayo mixture on rolls and on top of the mayo mixture spread on a generous helping of some warm Cheese Whiz - which they use in Philly.  The ciabatta rolls are nice because they are sturdy and have little nooks for the mayo, juices and Cheese Whiz. Then topped each sandwich with meat. Badabingbadaboom.  We all thought we were in Philly instead of Phoenix.

Oh my! what an awesome recipe! we gobbled them up and debated who would get the last sandwich, it was so wonderful!!! I did scale way back on the mayo but put enough on to taste the garlic/mayo combo and it really made all the difference in flavor. I will be making this recipe again and again!

Wow..my husband and I loved these!  I used red, yellow and orange bell peppers since that's what I had.  I also toasted the buns first, then broiled the sandwich to melt the cheese.  Delish!!

This was very tasty!  Not quite a Philly cheesesteak, but a real good steak sandwich, nontheless.  I used only 1 onion and 1 1/2 greenpepper and added sliced mushrooms to my mix.  I topped the mini sub buns that I used with sliced  cheese versus shredded. Good recipe, thanks!

I marinated the steak overnight in a bottled marinade to give the meat more flavor.  My whole family loved these!  I left the peppers and onions off for the kids.  They were messy, but good!

I made this tonight and it was a huge hit! I am pregnant and was craving Philly Cheesesteak and it really hit the spot! I added mushrooms, and added some garlic to the meat and veggies while they were cooking. I used Swiss cheese slices instead of what the receipe suggested. Definitely will be making this one again very soon!!!

My family loved these sandwiches.  Made exactly as stated but left off the onions and peppers for the kids on their sandwiches.  They also added steak sauce to their sandwiches.  They usually hate mayo but loved the taste on these sandwiches.  Used light mayo.  Would definetly make again.  Thanks

These sandwiches were excellent! I also buy the pre-cut fajoita meat  at my grocery, and it works really well.
Seemed like way too much mayo though... I only used about half and could have used less. We used a mix of red and green peppers and a little pepper jack in with the regular. Yummy!

Our gas station didn't carry any of these ingredients so I substituted a philly steak and cheese sandwich from a local food truck. It was delicious! Love this recipe! Will make again.

Simply delicious! No changes other than to cook the round steak in my instant pot, followed by sautéeing the onion and bell peppers in some butter instead of oil. Oh SO delicious!!!

Absolutely delicious!  The key is to get fresh rolls from the bakery and thinly sliced beef from the butcher.  I forgot to add the oregano, but it was awesome without it.  I think that toasting the bread before adding the meat and veggies was a great suggestion.  The garlic mayo gave it a great flavor without even tasting like mayonnaise.  AWESOME recipe!!!!

Easy recipe, took no time and was delicious. I cooked the veggies on the side but it wasn't a preference thing, by the time I was in the kitchen with the ingredients I just started cooking and didn't look at the recipe again.

Superior to any frozen steak! The (adult kids) raved about it! They were glad we had ketchup and horseradish sauce on hand. It made the experience memorable. Thanks.

Garlic mayo is my new go to for sammies.  Loved it.  I used a very small round roast and sliced it raw.  Found that so much liquid came off the roast that my meat and veg were boiled not fried.  Next time I'd do the veg separate from the meat.  Very tasty!

Omg! I really enjoyed this recipe, it's "Too good", if that makes sense. I shared with my brother, whom's a picky eater and he wanted more. However, I didn't have green peppers or mozzarella. I used fresh provolone..still amazing! Will make again.

It was good, but I think a regular amount of the garlic mayo would be fine. The generous spread became a bit much for me.

These were pretty yummy and easy to make. I think the meat got a little dry while waiting for the peppers to soften so next time I will add everything a little sooner. It was easy to customize for the picky eaters in the house....my son only got the meat with cheese, daughter meat and onions. I also think that the garlic mayo is a must. I had one without and it was pretty boring. ((Had to add ketchup...ewww. LOL))

I think the steak is cooked for way too long. If I make this again, I would cook the meat and saute the vegetables separate instead of cooking them in the same pan.  I also think I left my sandwich in the oven way to long. The bun was hard and even slightly burnt on the bottom.

This was very delicious and super easy to make! The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I made slight adjustments. I took the advice of a fellow reviewer and sauted the steak in steak sauce (I used A1 and it was super yummy!). I also added mushrooms to the bellpepper and onion mix. And for the garlic mayo instead of only putting garlic I also added about a 1/2 tablespoon of Paprika and some red pepper flakes. It gave the sand which that extra kick and really brought the flavors together. Great recipe!

I had a philly chesesteak sandwich while on vacation and wanted to try to duplicate it ever since, this one tasted even better. the only thing I did different was use sherry to steam the meat then I put the lid on. the meat i got just wasn't thatvtender but it still turned out amazing!

Restaurant quality sandwich! The sauce was what really made this sandwich; saucy, creamy, delicious! Didn't change a thing, but we did have a lot of leftover sauce. I will halve the sauce recipe next time.

Excellent!!! I only made 3 minor changes; used garlic oil instead of olive oil and used shaved beef I found at Sweetbay, and added fresh mushrooms to the onion/pepper mixture.  This recipe is a definite keeper!

I really wanted to like this, but for some reason it just didn't work for us.  I don't know if it was the meat/cheese combo, or the garlic/mayo, or what - individually, they tasted fine, but when put together .... eh.  So sorry.

Easy and delicious! I had leftover steak from last night (Rock's T-bone Steaks from AR), cut it thinly and set it to the side while I sauteed the onions and mushrooms. I totally forgot the oregano but don't miss it. I love the garlic mayo, it completes it.

This is a very easy and tasty recipe. I didn't change anything in the recipe except I didn't shred the cheese. Make sure you do that because it would be spread more evenly on the sandwich. I also used a yellow pepper because that is what I had in the fridge. the garlic mayo is exceptional. Don't skimp on the mayo. Spread a LOT on the bun and you will be glad you did. Thanks for sharing this recipe it is delicious and will go into my rotation.

There was not much flavor to this. If it wasn't for the garlic mayo, it would have only gotten one star.

This recipe was very good.  I had the butcher put the round steak through their meat tenderizer to ensure the meat wouldn't come out tough.  I also used close to a half-pound of meat per sandwich and think that the ratio of ingredients to each other was appropriate.

Outstanding- Used sirloin steak at the advice of the butcher. We also added mushrooms. This is one good sandwich. I seasoned mine with a black pepercorn marinade.  It comes in the weber packets. Seasoned for 4 hours.

Great Recipe!! The garlic mayo really makes the sandwich.  Took other reviewers advice and tucked the beef in the freezer for just a bit before I was ready to use it and it made thin slicing a breeze.   Will certainly be making this again and again.

My 14 year old son said today, "Mom, will you make that amazing toasted sandwich that you made for us last year when we were snowed in...you remember, the one where you cooked the steak on the stove & put cheese on top?" This is the recipe I used...5 stars all the way when remembered a year later!     :)

This was really good as far as philly cheesesteaks go. The only issue I had was that the recipe called for waaay too much garlic to be put in the mayo. But I agree...a little garlic makes it good.

I don't normally review recipes but this was so awesome, I had to give it 5 stars.  I will definitely use the garlic mayo on other sandwiches, it was great!  I only changed two things: I used provolone instead of mozzarella and I used a bit less meat, adding mushrooms instead.  I don't care if this is a 'true' philly sandwich or not, it was amazing!

This tasted wonderful and the garlic mayonnaise did give it that little kick which distinguished it from standard philly recipes.  The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because I made a few alterations;  While sauteing the steak, I added worcestershire and soy sauce, after the steak was done, I had to remove it and empty the pan of the excess fat and grease before adding the vegetables.  Great recipe though, once again, garlic mayo was a revelation!

I brought home a little petite filet mignon when we were out to dinner the other night so I decided to use it to make this sandwich.  I didn’t have a green bell pepper, but I did use a mix of red, yellow and orange bell peppers.  I used a chunk of a French baguette for the hoagie roll and used a shredded mozzarella/provolone blend.  I assembled the sandwich and just broiled it long enough to get the cheese to melt.  Ooops, I forgot to put the oregano on it, but that would have made this even better.  I served the garlic mayo on the side. This made a hearty sandwich that I thoroughly enjoyed.

My group make this recipe in foods class. We cooked the meat and the onion one day and let it sit for 2 days then reheated it. We used a lot of cheese. This was wonderful. I'll be making this of my family really soon.

This was a good sandwich! But my group and i did not have green peppers and we did not make the garlic mayo. And we aso used hamburger buns. But overall it still looked good but it tastes better! The meat was easy to make and yummy!!!

I used about 1.75 lbs of beef round steak and it made 5 sandwiches.  I had to use a seperate pan to cook the vegies in, they wouldn't fit with my meat.  I loved the mayo, but my hubby didn't care for it.  My hubby is a cheesesteak buff and he said he prefers a more shredded steak or steakums.  I thought I cut my steak into small strips, but it was still hard to chew....you need VERY thin cuts.  We used provolone which is what we use locally.  My cheese was melted in about 4 mins.  Hubby said the only thing this is missing is horseradish sauce.  SO GOOD!, thank you.

LOVED this recipe!  Added mushrooms to the ingredients, and agree with other reviews ~ the garlic mayo dressing complimented the entire sandwich beautifully!  Thanks for sharing Tera!

Great recipe and super easy!! I used provolone on a few and mozzerella cheese on the others. Highly recommend the provolone. Also, the garlic mayo added to the taste. Will make again for sure!!

Delicious, delicious!!!  I used ribeye steak, because that's what a different recipe called for but, I saw this recipe and all the great reviews and decided to try it.  Sure glad I did.  Everyone loved it, garlic mayo definitely makes the sandwich.

I just made these using leftover rib roast.  We never like rib roast the next day because it gets a fatty taste when cooled, but this is my solution on what to do with it.  These were wonderful!  We're garlic lovers so I did add a little garlic in with the onions and peppers.  Thanks for posting!

I wasn't sure about the garlic mayo, but it really does make the sandwich! Like other reviewers have said, make sure to freeze the steak for a little to make slicing it easier. A really good knife helps as well. I also used deli turkey in place of the steak, and think it was even better! Will make this again for sure!

My family loved these...the only thing I didnt like was the bread I bought for them but had nothing to do with this recipe. I also bought garlic and herb mayo to use and used provolone cheese. For the meat I used flank steak since that is what I had on hand. This will be a keeper for us!!!

I have never made philly cheesesteak before but both my husband and I loved this recipe and agree the garlic mayo was the best! It is better with minced fresh garlic than the jarred minced garlic. We used a nice beef tenderloin sliced by the butcher and will be making this again!

BY far the best cheesesteak I ever tasted. I added a few extra spices: montreal steak spice mix, oregano, rosemary, and a dash of each cinnamon & allspice. I also sauted some mushrooms as other reviewers did. Definatly a keeper

Roast the garlic beforehand (roasting whole heads of garlic at high heat for about 30 - 45mins) makes the Garlic Mayo taste awesome!!! Used provolone cheese and skipped the green capsicums (peppers). Served with home made fries and leftover garlic mayo as a dipping sauce....YUM!

What a simple recipe and the sandwhich tasted great. My husband loved it and he's so picky! Instead of beef I used moose sirloin steak that was seared on a grilltop, then sliced thinly. Salt and pepper was just enough to season this meat; there really isn't any need to use steak seasoning or add an au jus for dipping. This garlic mayo (or aoili) is so key to this sandwhich. Thanks for this. I plan to make it often, maybe with flank steak but especially with the wild game meat.

This is a wonderful recipe.  Definitely don't skip the garlic mayonaise, it makes the sandwich.  My husband doesn't like mayonaise, but I put it on there anyway without telling him, and now he wouldn't dare eat one of these without it.

This was delicious! The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 was that it needed a little extra seasoning.  I added some seasoning salt, creole seasoning and even a bit of steak rub while the steak was cooking.  It was fantastic and even my super picky 6-yr-old ate it up. After pulling out the onions, of course! This is a keeper.

This is a really good, quick and economical (depending on the cut of meat used) dinner.  My husband followed the recipe with little variation and this is now in our regular rotation.  If you really like garlic double the amount for the mayo.

this was not flavorful at all.  after making it and being really disappointed, i returned the meat to the skillet with tons of seasoning and made my own chipotle sauce for the buns.  i highly recommend "easy bbq flank steak with chipotle mayo" on this site.  the meat marinade is incredible and if you're looking for a sandwich, you can put in on bread.  this just didn't have any surprise or kick to it.  very very bland.  sorry.

Awesome!  Not a Philly Cheese though.  But I didnt feel the need to use any salt or pepper.  I added about 1T of crushed rosemary and 1T of dill weed to the mayo.  All I can say is WOW!  I used nice soft round hoggie rolls.  I also didnt toast them just because I dont love toasted bread.

For all you Philly Cheesesteak' I have had Philly Cheesesteaks in Philly at 8 different places and they where different to the one's people thank. It is very specific to it's ingredients not a blanket name for any sandwich with cheese on. So call Philly no matter what type of cheese, just keep with the beef. Oh by the way I am from Philly also born and raised.

SO yummy!! everyone is right when saying the mayo makes it! I used some petit sirloin i had which was a good meat choice, not to tough. and used banana peppers instead of bell peppers just a preference. Can't get better than this!

These are so good. I used a green and a red pepper and left out the oregano. My family really enjoyed these. I would definately make them again.

It was okay, I'm not sure how I like the garlic mayo, at least doing it in the oven. I don't think I'll make this again.

My husband is from Philly and he loved this recipe. It was super easy to make and even my picky 7 and 8 year olds gobbled it up! I used top sirloin and marinaded it for 45 min before cooking. Will definitely be making this again!!!

These were so good! I actually used some beef stew meat that I needed to use up. I marinated the meat in some olive oil and steak seasoning for a few hours. I also made "french bread rolls to die for" from this site for the sandwich rolls. I also used provalone cheese instead of mozarella. I agree that the garlic mayo really makes this good. I will defenitely make this again with some better meat :)

Good Philly Sandwich. I cooked the meat in a crock pot to ensure that it was very very tender. I added jalopeno pepperes and minced garlic to the pot. These were good.

Left out the mayo, marinated the meat for a couple of hours in 1/2 cup of red wine, a couple splashes of OJ and 1/2 squeezed lemon, then grilled it instead of pan frying. Sprinkled some dill ontop the peppers and onions while cooking. Also used fresh Mexican "Bolillo" rolls and 1/2 pepperjack cheese and 1/2 mozzarella cheese. And whatever you do, melt some cheese in with the beef and pepper mixture before filling the sandwiches! Adding a sliced jalapeno chile marinated in vinegar will kick it up to a nice spicy flavor too! I served an aujou on the side, made with a can of beef broth, some garlic powder and minced onions. Wasn't really necessary, but, some people liked it.

Wow!  These were fantastic.  I sprinkled some greek seasoning on the raw meat and refridgerated for about 5 hours.  I then sauted the peppers, onions and fresh mushrooms until almost done and removed from pan.  Added in the meat and cooked for a couple minutes and then added back in the vegetables.  Served on homemade Onion Rolls from this site and crumbled some Queso Blanco on top before baking at 500 degrees.  Wow, the garlic mayo was fantastic too, just added to all the wonderful flavors.  Better than any I've had in a restaurant, that's for sure!!

The only think I changed was that I used lowfat mayo and I grilled the meat until medium rare and sliced it up.  Next time I think I will try using ribeye because the the round steak was a little tough.  Very tasty recipe!

These are very nice! I served them on wonderful homemade french rolls (French Bread Rolls to Die For) which made them even better. The garlic mayo was a nice mild flavor, and the oregano was a nice touch. We used almost a full pound of steak and added a carton of sliced fresh mushrooms and it was a good meat to veggie ratio for us. I think I'll try this with provologne next time instead of mozz! Great sandwich. :)

I'm just going to call mine a Great American Steak Sandwich so as not to offend the much too sensitive Philly's.  I have been making this sandwich for quite some time.  Rather than cook my steak in olive oil, I season it with garlic, onion, steak seasoning and a generous amount of soy sauce.  Also, I only use either mozz cheese or provolone.  Once the steak and cheese are on the bread, I throw it in the oven on broil for a few minutes to melt the cheese.  I also put shredded lettuce and tomato slices on top.  This is one of my favorite dinners.

BEST PHILLY CHEESESTEAK OF MY LIFE! I added lots of extra stuff to mine and made it very non-traditional, I was skeptical about the mayo because it was so simple so I added tsp. of pepper, garlic powder and dried oregano. The beef I marinated in Italian dressing, Worcestershire sauce, Italian seasoning, steak rub and salt and pepper. It was delicious.

Really good! I thought 2 green peppers seemed like a bit much for our tastes, so I cut down and used 1/2 of one green bell, and 1/2 of one red bell pepper. I also sliced up some fresh mushrooms and added them to the mix. Very good and the garlic mayo is killer (I only made a 1/2 cup of it and it was plenty). Thank you :)

I thought this recipe was very good.  I prefer to use garlic powder or granulated garlic instead of minced garlic, because biting into a big piece of minced garlic is less than pleasurable.  Next time I'm looking for an easy meal I'll be sure to use this one again!

Very good sandwich.  Only gave it 4 stars though. I save the 5 stars for OMG!! The garlic mayo is a great touch. I used sirloin very thinly sliced and  I also used McCormicks Italian Grinder to season.  My husband really enjoyed the sandwich.  Definitely a keeper!

Excellent, since I'm not a hot mayo fan, I changed it to garlic butter instead. Will make this again.

AWESOME!!  BUT.. I CHEATED- I USED MINCED GARLIC IN THE JAR (ALL I HAD)- MIXED WITH MY MAYO AND PEPPER AND SAT IN FRIDGE TO SOAK UP THE GARLICKY GOODNESS- I USED "STEAK-UMS" AND USED SWEET ITALIAN BREAD FROM THE BAKERY- ALSO ITALIAN MIXED SHREDDED CHEESE- I ALSO SUBSTITUTED MUSHROOMS FOR THE GREEN PEPPERS AS MY HUSBAND ONLY EATS BELL PEPPER RAW (YEAH, I KNOW, GO FIGURE)- I COVERED BOTH SIDES OF MY MY BREAD WITH CHEESE AND THE VEGGIES AND PUT UNDER BROILER AND LET BROIL WHILE I COOKED THE STEAKS- BEFORE ADDING THEM TO MY BREAD I SLATHERED ON THE MAYO-- HOLY COW! MY HUSBAND AND SON GOBBLED ALL LICKED THE PLATE--  GARLIC MAYO TOTALLY OUTRAGEOUS!  WILL ACTUALLY USE ON OTHER THINGS LIKE SANDWICHES AND BURGERS!!

The garlic mayo rocks! Didn't use all the mayo though. Don't be shy w/the mayo it is really good. I used an arm chuck roast sliced thin. I also sprinkled with a little Italian season instead of Oregano. Also lightly sprinkled with season salt before baking. I also used sliced Mozz. cheese instead of shredded. Wonderful & will make again.

I thought this was an excellent Philly Cheesesteak sandwich. I am always searching for the perfect one and this ones seems to be it! Instead of slicing my own meat, I bought already sliced stirfry meat and it worked just great. Also I did not drain the liquid that formed in the pan from the meat and vegetables and used it to pour a little over the sandwich so that it was not so dry. I popped in under the broiler and it was good to go

Fabulous! Added a little bit more seasoning to the garlic mayo (yummy) & marinated a sirloin steak for a few hours in olive oil, worscestire(sp?) sauce & steak seasoning. This was a fun new recipe to add to our meal planning.  ty!

YUM. So quick and easy! I omitted the green peppers and added mushrooms. For the steak I used a thinly sliced ribeye. These were fabulous, even when reheated the next day (minus the bun, of course). The garlic mayo is wonderful. Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome sandwich with the fresh garlic being the key.  Changes I made was
Add some warmed Philly cream cheese to the mayo mix. 
Let mayo mix sit in frig minimum 30min for flavor melding.
Added mushrooms.
Browned sirloin whole then let rest.
After steak rests, slice steak thinly cross grain
Add steak to back to pan along with juices that were generated while resting and heat steak back up, low heat.
Can mix in a little dried Italian salad mix with steak
Used Harvarti cheese
Broil open faced
For tender meat make sure its cross grain meaning after a slice the meat should pull apart if you stretch it.

These were very very good! I used steak um brand steaks. I doubled the garlic in the mayo as we happen to really like garlic and I thought it needed more flavor. I toasted the hoagie buns and then just used the lo broil setting to melt the cheese on the assembled sandwiches instead of the 500* oven. The garlic mayo was a great touch and really set these apart from others.

I cooked this slightly different than the recipe said. I sprinkled the meat with italian seasonings prior to cooking. I heated up the olive oil with some minced garlic and onions (did not use peppers), then added the seasoned steak. Then instead of mozzarella, I used American cheese (which tastes amazing especially with the mayo!). We LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe and has become a fast favorite. It really is so quick and easy but also very filling. My husband likes when I buy thin sliced steaks and then cut them into strips - it makes it a lot easier to eat.

We really liked this- especially my husband.  It had great flavor with the garlic, onions, and cheese, and I even have a slight cold and have lost some sense of taste!  ;)  I cut the recipe in half for just myself and him, and use whole wheat hoagie rolls and low-fat mayo (made 1/2 cup of garlic mayo, but didn't use it all on the sammy's).  I also used deli roast beef instead of round steak, and used way less cheese.  I couldn't find oregano (I'm staying with my Aunt) so I just left it off.  Very good, and quite easy too.  We really enjoyed these.

This sandwich rocks the garlic mayo is the perfect condiment for the philly and it's toasted to boot. I didn't change a thing and everyone loved them. Will definitly make them again. OH one thing cut the round steak really really thin makes for a better and quicker sandwich.

Delish! These were so good.  I added mushrooms with the peppers and onions and tomatoes at the end.  Made pretty colors.  :)  Oh, and I used sirloin and it wasn't chewy or tough at all.  Definitely try sirloin if you've had trouble with the round steak.  Will be added to our keepers list! Thanks!

These were extra good tonight. I used extra garlic in the mayo but couldn't taste the garlic. I did notice a different flavor that was wonderful and I can't help but think it was the addition of garlic mixed with all the other flavors.

My husband and I really enjoyed these!  I used Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning on the meat, onions & peppers, which really added to the flavor of the garlic mayo!  I also used sliced provolone instead of mozzarella.  The portions were very large for 2 people, but that just means excellent left overs. This is definitely a keeper!

I love these sandwiches!!! I slice the meat and let it marinate with A-1 sauce in the fridge for about thirty minutes and instead of making the garlic mayo I just sprinkle a little garlic powder over the mayo on my sandwich. Also I use sliced cheese (less mess and it dosen't fall off) on the sandwiches.

Whether or not this is a true Philly Steak sandwich, I don't know, but I do know it was yummy! Loved the garlic mayo. Will most likely not use regular mayo on anything again!!!

Excellent! And I love that it's fairly inexpensive - feeds a lot for not a lot of money! We also reduced the mayo, per other feedbacks, but still very tasty! We'll make it again for sure!

Once I read the nutritional label, I couldn't even try this!  Sorry!  Maybe I will try to revise it some and reduce the calories, fat, and sodium!

I made this last night.  It was really good!  My husband and I love garlic and this hit the spot.
I also used some shredded salsa jack cheese in addition to the mozzarela.  It was delicious!
Also, I didn't heat the oven to 500 degrees.  Only about 425, and put it in just till cheese melted.

Very good. Not quite as tasty as our local pub's, but we liked them. We like to use slices of cheese instead of shredded. Thanks.

I used american cheese instead of mozzerella and used a little of red, yellow and green bell peppers for color.  I will make again but may skip the garlic mayo, although it was good I prefer not to have.

I didn't care for these.  My hubby said they were ok.  I made as stated, but IF I were to ever make these again, I'd mix in the cheese where it was really mixed well with the meat/peppers/onions.  I couldn't even eat half of one, just didn't care for it.  :(

Yummy!!!!!!!
This was quick, easy ,cheap and delicious!! My husband isn't a big fan of mayo so I added 2 Tbs of sour cream to the mayo/garlic and it turned out really great... even my picky 7 year old liked it..I'm going to try it with chicken next. Oh and I didn't toast in oven I grilled the roll then added all the stuff... still turned out great..

Overall great recipe! Debated between 4 and 5 stars but decided there were some MINOR improvements to make in my opinion. Next time I will definitely season the steak a bit while cooking. I toasted the hoagies just a tad too much which was my fault. They were still great, just a bit crispy after baking. 
The garlic mayo is yummy, makes more than is needed though. I used light mayo and still tasted fab. Mushrooms would perfect the sandwich, if you like them. Also, I used a pizza blend cheese rather than just mozzarella which turned out well. LOVED THESE!! Will make again. :) Thank you!

My husband loved this!  We used chicken instead, as well as shredded low fat mozzarella.  He was talking about them to all his co-workers.  Can't wait to try with beef.

Delicious. Added sliced mushrooms and used Provolone instead of mozzerella. Also, didn't toast the Hoagie buns. What comfort food. Went great with some roasted red potatoes.

This sandwich was awesome.  My husband loves philly cheesesteak sandwiches and often orders them when we go out to eat and this recipe was top notch.  The garlic mayo really gave a nice touch!

I didn't really enjoy these sandwiches. I used sirloin steak instead of the round steak called for in the recipe. I didn't make any other changes, and I just didn't care for them (neither did my husband). Maybe we are just used to having steak sauce on our steak sandwiches, rather than mayo.

YALL! I neverrrr post reviews. But this holy piece of Heaven on Earth shakes my soul. We added banana peppers instead of bell. 
I did NOT expect this to be soo savory but have mercy I'll be big as a house after learning how to make these. 
God bless y'all and whoever invented this sandwich.

Simply delicious.  

I have several vacuum bags of thin-sliced bottom round and decided to try this recipe to use some of that beef up. The flavors were delicious.  I think there are too many peppers and onions for the amount of meat though. Next time I will definitely only use one onion and pepper to keep it on the meatier side.

I used bottom round which has a nice beefy flavor but tends to be a bit chewy.  I negated the chewiness by using a velveting technique on the beef.  After a one-hour marinate in the fridge - it had the perfect texture.

Read the reviews first! So annoying I threw the steak in first and then waited for the onions and peppers to cook. I had a bad feeling I shouldn’t follow the directions, but went for it anyway. Cook your veggies first and then flash fry your steak.

My husband and son were wowed by this! I think it was the mayo. I used a marinade recipe from another site for the meat. Next time I think I'll use provolone instead of mozzarella but this recipe is a definite winner no matter how you make it!

Great recipe! I did put a little steak seasoning on the steak first, but the garlic mayo is the key. I also toasted the buns first then added the mayo and cheese, broiled until cheese melted then added the meat/veggies.

I chose not to use the garlic in the mayo but everything else worked perfectly together! Great recipe, the family loved it.

This was DELICIOUS!  It was so easy & quick to make after a long workday.  Will definitely be making this again.  It was perfect as is, but I did use one green & one red pepper, just for asthetics.  I also added a can of mushrooms.

EXCELLENT! I am not a red meat eater but made this for my bf who really loves his steaks. I followed this recipe exactly except I used a boneless ribeye because that's what he always buys. HUGE TIP for everyone. If your steak is frozen, thaw for about a half hour, then slice with a very sharp knife. You'll get paper thin slices! Or freeze a thawed one for 30-60 minutes and do the same. Anyway, he mentioned that a smoked cheese next time might be awesome (yes, I know it's not authentic.....), like a smoked mozz, provalone or cheddar. But he absolutely loved this! Another tip, if you are using a less expensive steak, slice it and marinate in buttermilk all day. Will really soften your meat up!!! Anyway, the garlic mayo was a huge hit. I made it in the morning to let the flavors marry. He LOVED it!!! Thank you!!!!!!!

I went exactly by the recipe and it was delicious! My husband and I made 8 of them. Next time, I would make more of that garlic sauce it was so good and all our kids loved the philly cheese steaks. We would make this again.

It was a great sandwich, I just need an acid to "cut" the fatty tastes...and the addition of the mayo put me over the edge...However, I did pour some A1 steak sauce on it, and that did the trick!
I think I will just add the A1 to the mayo mixture next time

Good food.  I made several modifications based on experience.  I used sweet onions, which together with the bell peppers I caramelized in butter rather than olive oil (bread and butter, as well as onions and butter, pair well) for about 35 minutes on low/medium-low heat.  I lightly toasted the hoagie rolls so they wouldn't get soggy.  I used slightly less onion, about one and a half, and about half the amount of the aioli.   For the steak, I used chuck eye, but rib eye would also do; I wanted something that would be tender rather than chewy.  I salted it thoroughly and cut it thinly against the grain, which worked well.  I served this with seasoned steak fries.  I think a light green salad with a vinaigrette would also be a good side dish, since the sandwich is rather heavy.

Was okay.  Difficult to toast buns without 2 halves separating.  e
Will partially freeze then slice beef thinner next time. I used fresh garlic in mayo but had some pre diced garlic in fridge.  Added some of the garlic juice to mayo.  Mayo was awesome,  will make more for burgers & sandwiches.

Sooooo good!  I used thinly sliced bottom round steak with Italian seasoning, pepper and garlic salt. For the garlic mayo I used the jarred garlic and pepper. We also used sliced provolone. It was a huge hit in the house and we will definitely be making it again!

Good. The sauce made too much. Make sure you spread the mayonnaise thick on each side of the bread. I used beef roast and cooked it in the instant pot with seasonings. Then followed the recipe with the rest of the ingredients. Good overall.

This was good but a little bland spice wise. I took the advice of some others and decided to marinade the meat but I used a fairly mild marinade. Next time I'll have to try and find a way to punch it up a little

Everyone loved it. I used provolone and mozzarella cheeses, but think I would add pepper jack as well and a hot pepper to give a little kick. Based on some of the reviews I added mushrooms and would recommend doing that.  The garlic mayo was great.  Definitely making again and recommend this one.

Very good. Don't overdo the mayo mixture and cheese when you're baking it because once you put the two halves together it may actually be a lot. Best to wait to met the cheese on top if you aren't planning to eat immediately, otherwise cheese can kinda get congealed which is gross. The hoagie buns make all the business, though a little expensive meal overall.

This recipe was AWESOME! The only change I made was marinating the steak with some Montreal steak seasoning and Italian seasoning for ~30 minutes prior to cooking.

Had my in-laws over for dinner and they said it was the best dinner ever! Loved it! Was awesome the next day to. Definitely one of my go to recipes! I did lightly butter the rolls and put garlic power on them before I browned them. Also added some onion powder to the mixture! Yummy!!

The overall idea of the recipe is fine, but it needs some tweaking. I used two 1 pound rib eyes to balance out the veggie to meat ratio. The size of the veggies should be mentioned.  I did 1 regular onion, 2 bell peppers, but i will switch one green for a red next time for some color and a little sweetness. I will add mushrooms next time too. I added a little Worcestershire sauce and some cholula hot sauce for a little kick. I switched out the mozzarella for provolone cause I know that is more traditional, but really both cheeses will work fine, if you already have mozzarella, then no need to buy provolone.

I used the frozen SteakUms.  Made things a lot quicker.  Hubby liked it a lot.  The hoagie bread stays firm even though I pack it for his lunch.

My family and I love this recipe. We didn't toast the hoagie rolls first and we thought the rolls were perfect without toasting them first. The only thing I'm gonna change next time I make this is to change the cut of beef cause to us it was chewy.

The garlic mayo was a hit! 2 bell peppers & 2 onions was a but much so I ended up not using all my veggies. I also went with sirloin steak and seasoned it with steak seasoning as some had suggested. Overall a great recipe and will make this again!

The sandwich was tasty even though I had to substitute mozzarella (didn't have) to Swiss.  The buns I had on hand were for French Dip sandwiches so they were thicker than one for a Philly Cheese Steak...but they were delicious nevertheless.  I had leftover London Broil Steak which was so tender and flavorful that it helped make the sandwich! I loaded them with the meat and veggie mixture.  The garlic mayo took them to the next level!!

Great sandwich.  Good flavor.  We've made it as the recipe says, and it turned out wonderfully, but this time, we decided to try something a bit different - we used sirloin which was even better, and added Chipotle chili pepper to the garlic mayo - even better!!!

Made the recipe as is, other than having to cook everything separately d/t picky eaters- they topped their own sandwiches per preference which meant everyone ate! I got thinly shaved beef which worked well.  I loved the garlic mayo! Will definitely put this into our rotation.

These were great! I thought they needed some mushrooms, so I added about half of a pound of sliced baby bellas, and I had enough filling to make 6 big sandwiches.

Made this last week and loved it! I have a big household, so I  doubled the filling and made it on a loaf of  Italian bread.

Garlic mayo adds a lot of flavour to this sandwich.  Quick and easy to make. Remember to slice the beef nice and thin.   Will be making this again.

I was hoping for a philly cheesesteak and suspected the whole "garlic mayo" thing would mellow out and fade away. It did not. But I gave it a try and... please, just rename it as a steak sandwich with mayo. I've never had one in Philly that was so slobbered over with that which shouldn't be.

Great recipe!  I actually used venison loin (super tender) and since I had onion buns on hand and not hoagie rolls, I just used those, open-faced and a mix of green pepper strips and the little red/yellow/orange peppers.  And since I didn't have as much mozzarella as needed I combined it with some shredded parmesan.  The garlic mayo was such a simple thing but SOOO good.  Husband and I devoured them.  Will definitely make again, thanks for the recipe!

The key to the recipe is to get the beef sliced as thinly as possible.  I suggest having the butcher do it.  Also better if you use a large griddle instead of the frying pan so that the juices can cook off quicker.

I only used half a cup of mayo with 2 garlic cloves

1/2 the mayo recipe is plenty for us, used the microplane on the garlic.   Let the whole steak sit with steak seasoning on it in the fridge all day, then put it in the freezer for around 20 minutes before slicing that night.  Delicious

Tasted great! The only change I made was eye round thinly sliced steak and Mozzarella cheese. Everything else remained the same. The toasted bread, mayo and garlic helped with the scrumptious taste of this sandwich! We definitely will be making these again and SOON! Thanks  for posting.

Well, I was going to say I made this exactly according to the recipe, but that's not true.  I used sirloin instead of a round steak.  Anyway, it was fantastic!  Because I cook for just me, I have leftovers and can't wait to have another one!

I made this and since there are only 2 of us, we had it four meals. Every time my husband raved how good it was. For him I  used Cheez Whiz in the authentic Philly style.  Since I don't do sugar I made mine with either cheddar or mozzarella. It was good too. A definite do again. (Oh, and I forgot to make the garlic mayo so I just spread real mayo and sprinkled garlic powder. )

Awesome dish! I seared the steak in butter and then left it to rest for 15 min. Then I chopped it up. That made cheap steak tender. Otherwise made it as is. The garlic mayo made the dish!

Just an FYI, Philly cheesesteaks are made with thinly sliced rib-eye and green peppers are NEVER used.  Cheese options are wiz, american or provolone.

It was great! I added mushrooms but that was all. There were lots of leftovers but they disappeared quickly. My 17 year old son asked me to always keep it on hand because it was really easy for him to reheat and have a really good sandwich.

Next time (which well be this weekend) i marinate the meat in Worcester, acv, garlic, and a few chili flakes before cooking to make it extra tender, and cut the meat after cooking.

great tasting sandwich, but, in NO Way can this be called a Philly cheesesteak. Putting thinly sliced steak on a hoagie roll does not make it Philly. Where is the provolone or the whiz? the fried onions? Where are the cherry peppers on the side? The men at Pat's or Geno's or Tony Luc's are shaking their heads.

The mayo was amazing. No fresh garlic so used chopped garlic and also chopped onion, added oregano, onion powder and garlic powder. The round steak was good but a little tough next time will use a better beef.

Wasn't a fan of the mayo garlic spread but that's easy to eliminate. I did find that for the portion of meet it was a lot of vegetables. I did 1.5 lbs serloin , seasoned it and let it sit in the fridge for a few hours. 1 onion , 2 peppers and added 3 mushrooms. Had lots of leftover veggies and that was with the extra half pound meat. I'd saw if you did the 1 lb meat you would be fine with 1 small onion and 1 medium bell pepper. Also should add, it's important to pre heat the oven right before you start cooking because if not I found it wasn't hot enough yet to toast the bun by the time the cheese melted.

We had flank steak last night with plenty of leftovers. I found this recipe on Allrecipes.com. We didn't have hoagie buns or green bell peppers so used a red bell pepper we had on hand and pulled a loaf of Italian bread from the freezer. Also, used shaved parmesan instead of grated. Shaved parm almost always works better than grated. The end result was amazing! We will be having flank steak more often so we can savor the leftovers with this recipe!!!

This was delicious! The only other thing I did was to season the steak with montreal steak seasoning, chilli powder, garlic powder and paprika.  This one will be going into the rotation!

This is a really great recipe, and so easy to make.  I had some left over beef brisket that was well seasoned and extremely tender, so I used it.  I also had a lot of juice from the meat that I served for dipping.  (I thought Philly Cheesesteak sandwiches were supposed to have dipping sauce.  It's been years since I was in Philly, so I wasn't sure.)  Everyone loved the result.  Thanks so much.

When I first saw this recipe, I was worried that I wouldn't like it because I'm a picky eater and don't like mayo and sandwiches in general. As I was preparing it, the smell was heavenly and started to change my mind. When I first tasted the sandwich, there was an explosion of goodness in my mouth! I really enjoyed this recipe.

Total yum!!! Will definitely be making again. I used a package and a half of the roast beef prepackage deli meat from Costco, but otherwise made as called for. I made one other addition only because I had made it up for a recipe I was going to make, but then found out I was missing an ingredient. So, I also spread on some softened butter I had mixed with some of the Johnny's garlic seasoning (also from Costco) before I put on the garlic butter. We love garlic, and this was very flavorful...not to overpowering. My hubby raved about it!!

Good meal, but I cut the onions and peppers back to one each. The steak should be the main taste. Also, I melted down American cheese and topped.

Made this for my husband for an early Saturday afternoon lunch and he loved it.  Raves about it still.  Our grown son took the extra home for himself for his lunch the next day and called to say it was delicious.  Will make this again for sure .

Awesomeness! I had roast beef sliced a little thicker than sandwich sliced at the local market & Provolone cheese was all that I had on hand. Followed the rest of the recipe exact. Was very good! Will be making again. Thank you for the recipe:)

I loved this sandwich.  I made it from leftover steak that was grilled outside.  I especially loved the garlic mayo and the added oregano sprinkled on the  top.

This recipe was a hit in the house last night! Even my finicky 6 year old ate it. I was asked to make it again. I decide to substitute the sirloin steak with Steak-umm's because I already had it in the freezer. It turned out pretty good. However, next time I'm going to try it with the sirloin and flavor it with steak seasoning the night prior to see how that turns out. Thanks for the recipe!

Loved this sandwich so much!  So did the hubby!  I used some of my own steak seasoning when cooking the steak, and also used Provolone cheese instead of Mozzarella.  Other than that, did all as the recipe stated and it was awesome!  Will be making this regularly in our house. :)

Awesome and so easy! Definitely a keeper ! The only change I made was caramelizing the onions ahead of time, but I think that's just a matter of personal preference.  The garlic mayo really takes this out of the park!

I used left over Prime Rid from a dinner party that  was seasoned with Montreal spices. Added both green and red peppers. Used both mozzarella and provalon cheeses. The garlic mayo was to die for on this sandwich.

These were fantastic! I added some Worcestershire to the sautéing process because I like Worcestershire. My only change would be to crock pot the beef or tenderize some other way.

Fantastic recipe!  This is a keeper! The only thing I changed was adding more oregano and garlic granules to the mayo.

Best Philly we have ever had! Instead of the mayo we melted a little butter and garlic to spread on the hoagie roll. Hands down amazing recipe!

Made this for the second time and it was delicious! I add a little Worcestershire sauce and garlic powder to the beef as it's searing, then add the bell peppers and onions. And of course, butter the hoagie roll and toast it!

I usually make recipes exactly as stated the first time, but this time I made do with what I had. Used steak picado and also sauteed portobello mushroom with sweet peppers and onions. Used provolone as the cheese. Used tortillas instead of hoagies because that's all I had. Added a dash of Worcestireshire sauce. Even with all the changes it was soooo yummy. Next time I will make as directed and adjust rating if necessary. :)

Oh man was this delicious. Even so on the next day when I reheated one for lunch. I skipped the oregano as I didn't have any. Other than that, I did everything the same. I should have tenderized the meat more as it was a bit chewy but the flavors coming from this thing just overwhelmed me and took my mind off any imperfections.

I read some of the reviews so I made a few changes. I seasoned the meat with steak seasoning and added a little dab of butter in the pan when the steak browned. I also used American and muenster cheese in with the motzarella and mixed some in to melt with the meat and veggies.

I changed very little about this recipe and followed the directions word for word. I did use steak seasoning on the meat. They were amazing!!!! I did add provolone to one of the sandwiches, but that was just a personal preference for my husband. The mayo really makes this meal! DONT SKIP THE MAYO!!! Perfect! Will be making these again.

I put slightly more meat and only did one pepper and one onion (my parents don't like those ingredients), but we liked it all the same. One thing we didn't quite like was the mayo, we thought that it was a bit too much on the mayo. So we might try something else when we make it again. Otherwise, it was really good!

I made these last night, used shredded Mexican cheese because that is what we had and they great! I made 3, had the last one for lunch today. After I wrapped in foil, heated oven to 375, for 15-20 minutes...so yummy. I will make these again.

Wow--excellent sandwich!  I've been exploring different things to do with leftover roast, instead of just using my standard beef stroganoff recipe all the time.  I thought about the idea of a philly cheesesteak, and went on Allrecipes looking for one.  Here is where I ended up, and I couldn't have been happier!  I used 1 onion, 1 pepper, and 1 pound of leftover roast, and ended up with plenty of good, proportionate filling.  Since my meat was already cooked, I let my veggies (especially my onions) get a head start so they could properly caramelize, then added the beef last to heat through.  (I guess I ended up with a cheese-roast sandwich instead of a cheesteak?  Something to ask a true Philadephian!)  The garlic mayo does so much for this recipe--delicious!  Thank you!

Great recipe and easy to make. 1 cup of mayo was way too much - I used about 1/4 cup for two sandwiches. Didn't have garlic cloves, so I used garlic powder - delicious! To save time, I used John Soules Angus beef (already cooked and seasoned). Will definitely make these again.

I made a few modifications for time and to use what was on-hand, but this was stellar. The garlic mayo was delicious.  I used sliced provolone, and I neither toasted the sub nor the sandwich. Still, amazing! I'm sure that making it as-written would be even better.

recipe is a bit bland.  I would recommend adding in Jalapeño or Serrano peppers to punch this recipe up a bit and give the Philly the little bit of zing that this recipe is missing.

This was fantastic! I made as directed, only added a splash of worcheshire sauce to the meat while it simmered. Husband raved about this one. I also put banana peppers on the side in case people wanted another topping w zip. I will be adding this to the monthly rotation!!!

This is absolutely scrumptious and the garlic mayo is the difference maker.  Will definitely make again.

Bought shaved Angus steak at Harris Teeter - sauteed red peppers and onions then added sliced mushrooms...strained those and lightly browned the steak in the same pan..lightly toasted the bread and assembled as recipe stated - except 425 instead of 500 - absolutely delicious!  I had chips on the side and discovered that the chips were also great ON the sandwich!    Thanks for sharing   :)

My husband was in love after I made this for him and the kids. Pretty easy to make and I tweaked the garlic mayo by adding 1 TB of dijon mustard for a little more bite.  Great, fast and delicious meal!!

We LOVED this!  I halved the recipe and it made enough for 3 large sandwiches.  As others have stated the garlic mayo adds awesome flavor.  Hubby suggest putting a little cheese atop the mayo in addition to the cheese added on top.  I used Mozzarella and Provolone and enjoyed both flavors.

We liked this a lot. I didn't use the mozzarella. I used swiss since it's what I had on hand. I think the spices are perfect.

These are fantastic!  I added a little garlic powder, S&P to the meat and veggies while they cooked.  Just for personal preference I added onto the sandwich some sliced tomatoes and sauteed mushrooms.  YUM!

This was very good.  I followed the recipe except I cut the amount of mayo and garlic in half because we don't like that much mayo on our sandwhiches.  I will be making this again.

This recipe is perfection!  As long as you get a good crusty sandwich roll you are all set.  We added mushrooms to the mixture and Worcestershire sauce as part of our seasoning.  The garlic mayo made it amazing - Delish!  This is one of those things that you want to keep eating long after you are full because it tastes so good!

Good combination for a hearty sandwich.
But NOT a Philly Cheesesteak! The similarity ends with rolls, beef, and onions. 
Try it, but understand that you are getting something quite different. If you order one in Philly and the waiter asks you if you want "wiz", you'll see what I mean.

Fantastic sandwiches!  The garlic mayo is a must.  We used Hellman's light mayo to cut some calories.  We had left over sirloin steak from the night before that was cooked medium rare, so we cut it up super thin and then cooked it further according to the recipe.  Any meat you use will end up well done, so using left overs is fine.  Be careful with the oven on 500 degrees the bread will burn quickly.

This was really good. Instead of garlic mayo I used a garlic butter spread and added mayo after I took it out of the oven. I also seasoned the meat with a roasted garlic & pepper season while it was cooking. I used sirloin steak and fresh Italian baked bread. It tasted great. I'll use this recipe again. Thanks

Philly Cheesesteak sandwich was one of things my husband requested for his 40th birthday.  He really loved this sandwich.  I think the key is the garlic mayo!!

I have been making the Philly Cheesesteak sandwich for a couple of years.  I don't bother with purchasing any kind of particular steak.
I buy the the steak meat that is located in the frozen section of my local grocery store.  The brand is called "Philly Steaks" these are very thin and consists of 16 slices per box.  I break apart the meat using my fingers or in the pan while frying with a fork.  This is so easy and the meat fries up in seconds.  While the meat is frying I add chopped onions & green pepper.  I use mozarella or provolone cheese to the roll, microwave the roll (15-20) sec till cheese is partially melted, then add the steak w/the onions and add your other condiments as you wish.  Another alternative is, omit the lettuce, tomato and mayo.  While the steak and onions are cooking, drain off grease and add Pizza Sauce to the steak and onion and mix togeather, then add to your sub roll with the provolone or mozarella cheese to have a Pizza Steak Sub.  This is very good.

This was very good, and fast and easy. I was only making one sandwich so I opted to spread the bun lightly with mayo then sprinkle with garlic powder. I used provolone cheese because I had some in my fridge; I also had cheeze whiz but I was a little afraid to try that! I do have some leftover meat and peppers/onions, so maybe I'll try the whiz with the leftovers.

This was so good!  And the mayo/garlic dip truly does make this sandwich.  I just used hot dog buns toasted for less than 5 minutes in the oven, thin strips of venison, and no oregano.  Loved it!  Thanks!

Terrific! I liked the garlic mayo and it was so easy, I used light mayo and pre-minced garlic from a jar. I used rib eye steak and seasoned the nite before (not on purpose, but could not cook them that night, so saved them for the next day). I used red peppers and onions. I also added butter and garlic salt to the bread and broiled until toasty, spread the garlic mayo on both sided, put on the meat and veggies, topped with a cheddar and mozz mix and broiled until melted. Yum!

Awesome recipe!  I've made this twice. Once following the recipe as written and the second time I used an Italian blend cheese which included mozzarella, provolone and asiago. I also added the mayo after cooking. Tasted great each time. Just a little more flavor with the mix of cheeses. Will make again using chicken instead of the beef.

Incredible!  My husband is not a mayo fan and was not excited to try it but he made it as stated and it was fabulous.  The mayo makes the dish the best and is not overpowering at all.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Probably one the best cheesesteaks ever!!! Used red and green peppers, provolone cheese and good rolls which we crisped up under the broiler. We used a paper thin cut of beef that was called chip steak (cut specifically for steak sandwiches) that we were gifted from friends. This was an amazing sandwich and the garlic mayo really threw it over the top. Delicious and will most definately make again. Thanks!

I loved it boyfriend is from east coast and said this was pretty good, a couple weeks prior I tried a different version and it was a complete failure.  This is one def much better, try adding Worcestershire sauce to the meat while cooking to give a little added flavor.  I also used a little chipotle mayo to give it a little heat..

I have made these twice. Best to use sirloin, pound to tenderize meat. I cover in steak seasoning and marinate overnight. Sear them on the grill to med rare then cut the meat into strips, assemble as directed and pop in the oven until the cheese is golden brown. Delicious!

My husband is not a big steak eater, but the next day he was still raving about this recipe! I simmered the meat and vegetables for another hour in White Merlot just to make the steak more tender. Garlic mayo was fabulous! Thank you!

I didn't have green peppers - hate them, so I used a variety of sweet peppers that I had. I added mushrooms as well (button), and only did six hoagies with provolone cheese. I have to say the garlic mayo makes the sandwich when it melts into the cheese. I could have eaten it all by myself and that is saying something. I also wrapped the sandwiches in tinfoil too, it helps to keep the cheese from melting out and onto the pan instead of the sandwich.

Delish... I cooked the meat in my own seasoning separate from the veggies and I used velveta cheese instead of mozzarella because I like the flavor. I added the cheese to the meat and cooked it so it melted all creamy like with the meat then I added to veggies to the meat mix, it turned out really well. I have to say that the garlic spread really makes this sandwich as well. 5 stars completely!

I live in Philly and can tell you this is NOT a Philly Cheesesteak. I understand that it is hard to find the right meats in other areas so I can respect the attempt to try to substitute. Although this was not properly named it was still an amazing cheesesteak! I used Landis steaks which are sold here in Philly specifically for Cheesesteaks & of course rolls from Lusciano's. The garlic mayo was what drew my eye to the recipe in the first place and it was a delicious addition. My boyfriend ate almost 2 in one sitting. Great recipe & thank you for sharing.

This was very good my hubby gave it a 4... when I asked him what he would change he said add tomatoes.I also used my little convection oven so that it wouldn't heat up the house so much. My hubby said that the "sauce" was amazing and that he would like to have this again. A great use for round steak.

Delicious!  If you love garlic, add more to the mayo.  I seasoned up the meat with our fave dry rub, and used 8oz. white button mushrooms *instead* of the bell peppers.  Was very good served on Whole Wheat hoagie buns, too.

I gave this a 5 star AFTER I tweeked it a bit.  I used 3/4 cup light mayo and two cloves of garlic minced for the mayo sauce.  I also added a 'squirt' of regular mustard on top of the mayo sauce.  Used a can of mushrooms with the onions and green peppers.  THIS is our favorite recipe.  Thank you!

This sandwich was better than the cheesesteak shops!! I added red bell peppers along with the green, canned mushrooms and sauted with sweet onions. This is definately not a healthy meal, but anything that tastes this good isn't going to be!!

These are some seriously good sandwiches. The garlic mayo really makes them. I've used different cuts of beef, depending on what I have on hand. I also prefer using sliced provolone rather than shredded mozzarella. But any way you go, I don't think you can go wrong. Thanks for sharing!

A nice, juicy sandwich.  I added italian seasoning in with meat instead of sprinkling oregano on afterwards, also added fresh mushrooms to veggie mixture instead of all green pepper.

Great easy recipe. Made it for my family and hubby and kids all loved it.  I didn't have the garlic cloves so I used 2 tsp of garlic salr.  The garlic/mayo mixture made this sandwich flavorful and perfect!

delicious! tastes just right!  i skipped the mayo and just added the garlic diced finely in with the veggies...and fried/sauteed the oregano and some chili flakes along with the onions instead of sprinkling it on at the end.

Super tasty! The garlic mayo goes perfect, I had cheddar cheese in my fridge so I used that instead :)

This was really great! The garlic mayo made it very yummy even though its very simple. We love garlic so I put a little extra. Next time I might add onions.

I agree with everyone: the mayo/garlic spread makes this sandwich! Definitely going in my staple of recipes. My changes were only made because of what I had at hand: red bell peppers instead of green, shredded cheddar instead of shredded mozz, and italian seasoning instead of oregano. But let me tell you, it was STILL delicious! Will make this again and again! And honestly, it DOES taste like a restaurant quality sandwich!

5 stars!  My wife absolutely loves these.  I had to share the recipe with the neighbors.  The garlic mayo makes the meal.  I marinate my steak strips in steak marinade for a couple of hours prior to cooking, then cook the veggies in the leftover marinade.  Delish!

What it isn't: a proper Philly cheesesteak. What is is: insanely delicious.  I go to college in Philadelphia, so I have plenty of opportunities to eat "authentic" cheesesteaks.  This cheesesteak sandwich, in my opinion, is better than those.  For one thing, it's not greasy.  I also use boneless sirloin, which is a step up from what you'll get in Philly.  And the garlic mayo.  Oh man, the garlic mayo.  It makes the sandwich go from good to awesome.  Like I said, it's not authentic, but it's ridiculously delicious.

Not too bad.  Steak could have used a little more seasoning - something just seemed to be missing in terms of taste but I couldn't put my finger on it.  Overall it was tasty though.

Amazing sandwich, i did a few modifications to suite me better and may be helpful to others that try this recipe. 1st i use sirloin steak instead of round, and i cook the steak in A1 bold and spicy, then i sautee the onions and peppers with a sliced jalapeno for a little extra kick and then follow the rest of the steps.

I have been making Steak and Cheese sandwiches somewhat like this for about 8 years. I like using actual steak not the super thin steak umms. I followed the recipe pretty much I did add mushrooms because I love them on steak sandwiches. I only made 3 because that is all I needed. I will make these again with the garlic mayo which really made these over the top great!! My step daughter wants to try the garlic mayo on a hot ham and cheese for lunch one day soon. She really loved the mayo also.

This recipe turned out ok.   I will not be making the garlic mayo again.  I  love garlic, but mixing it with mayo made it a little to strong for me.  The sandwich was missing something.  I'll probably make the sandwich again with more cheese, more spices, and a different sauce.  Thanks for the recipe.

Tasty! I used thin sliced ribeye instead of the round steak called for. I added some Tony Chachare's seasoning in the AM and let the steak sit in the fridge until preparation time. I also added a dash of course black pepper. This is a wonderful, diverse recipe.

This is definitely not a true philly but it is a wonderful sandwich none the less.  I was intrigued by the garlic mayo but did not put much on for fear it would not taste good.  I was wrong.  The mayo makes the sandwich so don't skip it!  I am thinking of using the garlic mayo on other sandwiches now.

Hubby and I both liked.  Have your butcher slice the steak.  Garlic mayo is wonderful.  Easy and well worth the effort.

My husband and I love this sandwich!  The garlic mayo gives it the best flavor, but I do use much less than it calls for to cut down on calories and fat.  I also added some sauteed mushrooms to mine (husband doesn't like!) which was awesome!  I didn't have oregano so I used parsley flakes for some color...I bet that makes it even better!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I love this, since I made it a couple weeks ago I've made it 3 times since then.  I love garlic though.  I used steak-ums and added mushrooms and a little steak seasoning.  I also used provolone cheese instead of the cheese it called for.  If you're not a garlic fan you could always omit the garlic but it really makes the sandwich.

My family loved it!  Followed recipe exactly.  The only thing mentioned was that it would have been better if the meat was very thinly sliced.  Maybe I can get the guy/gal at meat counter to do this next time?

I *love* the addition of the aioli - it gives it an unexpected flavor boost.  Great sandwich!!  Used cubed steak since they didn't have beef round steak, and I was making it for lunches at work (so they would be microwaved anyways).

We loved this recipe.  I used beef stew meat and just cut down into smaller pieces, which worked perfect.  I also used light mayo and reduced the cheese to cut down on the calories.  I will definitely be making these again!  Super fast and easy.

It was fair.  We tasted the garlic mayo more than anything.  If I was to make again, (which, honestly I probably won't) I'd put VERY little mayo on, as it seems to overpower the mild beef.  I will continue to look, but thanks for sharing.

I was a bit skeptical because my experience with round steak has been limited to slow cooker recipes because of the toughness of the meat, but I was pleasantly surprised by how this turned out.  The garlic mayonnaise and melted cheese (I used provolone) were excellent on this sandwich.  My husband said I need to make this when we have guests over, it was that good!

I have never rated anything before but decided to register after eating this sandwich. One word for it is TOTALY AWESOME!!! Very easy to make and incredible tasting. I used ribeye for the steak but the most important ingredient is the garlic mayo. Don't skimp!!!

Delish. I made some changes. I followed another reviewers shortcut and subbed roast beef for steak. I used a little more onion, a little less peppers. Seasoned with pepper, oregano and basil and melted some of the shredded mozzarella in the pan with the beef mix before putting it on the mayo-ed bun, then topped provolone slices before putting it in the oven. I'm not sure I'll ever buy another cheesesteak-until my next trip to Philly anyway.

If only I could get the meat sliced thinner, this would be the best recipe ever!! Great flavor from the garlic mayo and the cheese. Delicious over all. I used 1.5 lbs of meat because I have a teenage son and made 4 large sandwiches with it. I will definitely make these again!

When I first read the recipe I was definately hesitant on the raw garlic in mayo part, but I always make a recipe true to the word the first time.  This turned out great and you know my favorite part?...The garlic mayo of course!  It really compliments the strong beef flavor from the steak.

Much quicker to prepare than I would have guessed. I had provolone on hand, so I subbed it for the mozzarella. My husband liked the sandwich well enough, but thought it tasted "odd." I thought it was fine. It isn't the sort of thing my kids enjoy, but if it were I'd add it to my weeknight dinner repertoire.

This popped up as the recipe du jour and I was hungry at the time, so this was dinner.  I made it as stated: my husband had *three*, my three year old had nearly a whole one and even my picky five year old liked it.  Thank you for a delicious recipe, this goes in the box!

This recipe is especially delicious with chicken substituted for the steak.  It is my favorite sandwich, by far!  And the garlic mayo is a must, though sometimes I substitute Miracle Whip for the mayo (I love it both ways).

Such an easy recipe and so very tasty too. As others have said, the garlic mayo makes this sandwich. I've made this several times and still love it. I've subed deli roast beef when I needed an even faster version.

This recipe is delicious!  For those that find the traditional philly too bland, the garlic mayo is a much better solution than cheez whiz. I will be making this again.

this is a great, fast, and easy recipe, i used rib eye steak instead of the beef round. i also recommend spreading less of the garlic mayo because it can be very overwhelming.

TASTY AND EASY!  I sauté my steak and veggies separately, this way I can control the doneness of my steak.  try using a red bell pepper in combination with the green, and a red onion.  The colors make for a nice presentation.  Provolone cheese also works well with Philly Cheesesteaks. Also, this is a great way to use leftover steak.

Good!  I really think the garlic mayo gives it the kick, without that just ok.  I added mushrooms and used steak seasoning,  No oregano I was out.

These were awesome sandwiches!  My 5 yr old even loved them and wanted leftovers the next day for lunch.  I did not use the oregano, because I am not a fan and the sandwiches were still very flavorful. I was able to get 6 sandwiches out of the recipe. Be sure to use the garlic mayo...it makes the dish!!

This is a good sandwich.  I used petite sirloin.  The only problem I had is it got a little tough and I really didn't cook it that long.  The garlic mayo was good, I added a little horse radish to it to give it a kick.  Also, a cheaper alternative is to use a whole loaf of french bread as opposed to hoagie rolls.   This makes a lot of mayo, if you cut it back by a 1/3 you'll be fine.

Was DELICIOUS!! However, next time I will saute the onions and peppers first next time. They take longer and this way the steak won't get tough! The garlic mayo is the key...dont be afraid to add it generously! YUMMY!

I made this for my husband for dinner tonight and he absolutely LOVED it! I did take a small bite and totally agreed. I scaled the recipe down to make just one sandwich. I did not have any green peppers, so I subbed hot pepper spread and also added tomatoes. The garlic mayo really made this recipe stand out from the rest! Hubby said to give this recipe 5 stars and he's already asking when I'm gonna make it again! I think I just found our new favorite steak sandwich! Thanks for posting. :)

This recipe is perfect. I was skeptical about the number of onions and peppers but it works out nicely.  I would use two medium onions though. The real kicker is definitely the garlic mayo.

I have to say I wasn't crazy about the garlic mayo.  Authentic Philly cheesesteak sandwiches have cheez wiz not mozzarella cheese. People in Philly are very very serious about their steak sandwiches and this one does not hold up.  I did not put mozzarella on ours because having lived in PA for a while I just couldn't do it ! The garlic mayo added nothing to the sandwich. It gave it a funky taste, though, not in a  good way . If you're ever in Philly make sure you visit Pats or Genos.  Thanks anyway~

This recipe was awesome!  We had to feed alot of people so we doubled the recipe and used 2 loaves of french bread and lowfat mayo instead of regular mayo.  With the garlic in the mayo no one noticed!  Also, I was suprised at the ease of this recipe!  We are adding it to our regular menu!  :0)

My family LOVED this sandwich.  The only change I would make for our taste is to eliminate one green pepper, one onion and the oregano.  We love provolone and only use it with our Philly sandwiches.  The garlic mayo is delicious!  Thank you for sharing!

Wow!  I don't care if this isn't technically a "Philly cheesesteak"--it's a delicious sandwich.  Used sirloin and cut on the diagonal in thin strips.  Seasoned w/ grill & Italian seasoning.  Cooking time on stove was all of 7 minutes, all told I think.  Used a provolone/mozzarella shredded cheese mixture.  The garlic mayo was what did it, though!  Thanks for a great sandwich!

This was amazing!  I really thought the meat would need more seasoning, but I just used salt and pepper and once you got it on the sandwich with the garlic mayo and the cheese (I used sliced provolone), the flavor was perfect!  I did only make 1/2c. mayo and 1 clove garlic and it was plenty for the four servings.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Great tip to cut while meat is a bit frozen.  these were simple and my husband and I loved them -- the kids picked all the onions and green peppers off, but they don't count.

My family and I LOVED, LOVED these sandwiches.  The Garlic Mayo was fabulous.  It really made the sandwiches and was SO simple to prepare.  I made these with leftover grilled sirloin steak and it was a fabulous way to use up the steak.  I also added mushrooms to the mix.  Thanks for the great recipe!  I'll definitely be making these again.  BTW, if you don't think the garlic mayo is zippy enough, you probably didn't use enough garlic or put enough mayo on the sandwiches.  You want to slather it on generously.  Also, if you let the mayo sit in the fridge for a couple of hours before you use it, the flavors will be a lot stronger because they've had time to marinade.

This was pretty good.  I forgot to put the Italian seasoning on it and that might have given it a little more zip.  I will be making these again that is for sure.

My husband and I love our local philly cheesesteak place but I figured I'd give it a try myself. This tastes as good as that place, and now I can make it with hormone-free meat.  I didn't use the oregano and instead sprinkled a little KC Masterpiece dry rub on it while cooking the meat. I also made it without cheese and it was wonderful. We are thrilled. Good work, Tera, I'm telling everyone about this!

This was awesome!! I cooked a pot roast the night before and used the left over meat (I know, not what i should have used) but it was easy and tasted just as good. Love the mayo!! My son loved it as well. I can't wait for my husband to come home from his deployment (he will love it too).

This recipe was awesome! We had a large ribeye steak to use for lunch somehow so we found this recipe and tried it. We seasoned and grilled the steak first (until it was about medium rare). Then, we sliced the steak really thin and put it in the pan with the onions, peppers, and we added mushrooms to the mixture. It was so delicious. It was one of the best recipes we've ever gathered from this site. Highly recommend this one!

These were pretty tasty and DH and I enjoyed them, but they weren't "special".  We would have been just as satisfied with a less expensive recipe. This recipe should just be for the garlic mayo.  Hubby loved it! I don't like mayo, so I can't comment.

These were pretty good.  I am not sure if the mayo has to sit for a pretty good while before you can really taste the garlic, but I couldn't really tell it was there.  My husband loved them. I did add a little montreal steak seasoning, pepper and garlic to the meat when I cooked it though.

The philly was not as true to the philly taste as I had hoped.  The sandwiches were still a big hit in my house but I will try a different recipe next time.  The garlic mayo was great and I will definitely make that again.

My DH and I both enjoyed this.  I did toss the meat in the spice mixture from the other philly cheesesteak recipe.  I also cooked the onions until softened before adding the meat, so they had a chance to carmelize.  Next time I would use less than the recommended 2 tbsp mayo per sandwich and use a cheese with a little more bite.

The men in my house LOVED these!!!!  I made the garlic mayo an hour ahead of time so the mix could blend better.  Glad I did.  The butcher at my store sliced a nice piece of beef super thin for me for no charge.  Way cheaper than buying deli beef.  Marinated the meat in a little balsamic vinegar for an hour before I cooked it....just to make it a bit more tender.  Will be making these again.

This was a big hit with my husband.  I don't really care for green peppers, so I left them out of my sandwich and added some sliced mushrooms.  I forgot to add the oregano, but they were still delicious.  Thanks for a quick and easy meal that I'm sure I'll make again!

The garlic mayo was AWESOME! Even if the sandwich had been bad, which it wasn't, the mayo was enough to warrant a good review! I wouldn't have thought of it. I froze the steak (I used sirloin) for around 45 or 50 minutes to make it easier to slice thinly. I used 1 green pepper, 1 large onion, and whole-wheat hoagie rolls. Next time, I'll use sliced cheese instead of shredded... But a great recipe! Thanks for sharing, Tera!

This was good.  I think I used too much cheese because I love it so much but it took away some of the meat flavor!  the garlic mayo was a nice touch and I will use that again.  All and all a good recipe that I'd do again but I don't care for Cheesesteaks all that much so It's just not a personal preference for me, my husband really enjoyed his though.

This was really good.  I was very low on mayo and wasn't able to get the full garlic mayo effect (and had to throw in some Miracle Whip)...but otherwise it was excellent.  I cut the onions up in short strips like the peppers.  Good and filling.  Thanks for the recipe.

WOW!!!! this was so delicious!!  I did the meat different only because I know mine was tough.  So I used the "easy slow cooker french dip" recipe for that from this site.  It still took 10 hours to get it edible!  Anyway, the garlic mayo just makes the whole sandwich SING!! the whole family loved it this way! 10 stars!!!

My husband did a back flip over these. I cooked my in the slow cooker for about 6-8 hours. I also used provolone instead of mozzarella. The garlic mayo is what gives that "oh my goodness, this is so delicious" flavor. Definetly a keeper in my recipe box!!

Very good! I also used sirloin and added mushrooms. Another change was to saute the mixture covered for about an hour to make sure the meat and veggies were super tender. Excellent!

The mayo garlic spread is a MUST, without it I would probably rate this 2 stars for being average, but the spread gives it the flavor kick that it needs.

This was nothing out of the ordinary.  I didn't dislike it, but I won't make it again.  It was worth a try.  Just didn't rate too high.

I grated 1 clove of garlic into about 1/4 of mayo.(made only 2 sandwiches) The mayo was full of flavor and fabulous!! I also seasoned the steak with grill seasoning which includes salt, pepper and other spices. It was great!

Followed others suggestions and used sirloin for the meat and red bell pepper, with mushrooms. The garlic mayo is the hit of the sandwich. Do not skip this step or you will be missing out!!

LOVE the garlic mayo...would have never thought to do this.  My hubby preferred just ketchup.  Living in a suburb of Philly we can get cheesesteaks whenever we want, but these are different and good for when we want something a little different and "homemade".  Yum, will definitely make again!

This is so easy and good, even my picky teenagers and 18 month old son ate this up.  I agree with the other reviewers, the garlic mayo really makes this recipe.  The only thing I didn't put in were the peppers because we don't care for them.  Definitely a restaurant quality meal, except for using round steak in this is not great, as it is a tougher cut of meat.  Next time I am going to add mushrooms and use sirloin steak.  I was going to serve this with a side dish like homemade fries but everyone was filled up on the sandwich itself, so I wouldn't serve it with more than a side salad.  I also think this would be excellent with leftover roast beef.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Mu husband loved this recipe! A few changes I made...
* I used preshaved beef. Just made things easier!
* I left out the peppers and added garlic to the steak.
* I waited until after the sandwich was out of the broiler to add the mayo (it seemed odd to me to add it before and have it melt...)

The mayo was FANTASTIC! I added both minced garlic and garlic powder. I will definitly make that to keep in the fridge, it goes good on lots of stuff!

Great!  Next time I will use a better quality cut of meat, meat was a little dry.  I didnt use that much garlic mayo as I am the only one that likes mayo.  Next time I will use fresh garlic instead of chopped garlic in a jar.

Really good, just make sure if you are making this for the first time to make the steak really thin.  Otherwise, garlic mayo was delicious.

I sliced the beef against the grain with the slicing blade on my food processor, which made it thin and tender. Used provolone instead of mozzarella.  Really delicious!

this was pretty good, I used provolone instead and used mrs. Dash for added flavor.  I don't think that I got the best kind of steak for this because mine was a little tough.  My husband asked for this for his b-day dinner and he enjoyed it so that is all that matters.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Picked up some wonderful thinly sliced rib-eye/round steak today at Trader Joe's, needless to say, this recipe is a keeper.  I didn't feel like mincing garlic and had such little time.  Spread the mayo on each side of sub, sprinkled garlic powder then.  Added the meat which I'd cooked in Italian seasoning and a tad of salt, and provolone, heated at 500 for just a few minutes.  Then added the onion/pepper mixture.  AWESOME!  So frickin good!

I made these for dinner tonight for my family, and they were to die for.  Much better than the ones we get in restaraunts!  Even my 6 & 7 year old daughters ate every bite.  The changes I made were that I doubled the minced garlic, omitted the green peppers, and used italian seasoning instead of the oregano.  Very inexpensive to make as well, which is a big plus!  I will definatly be making these a lot more!

We loved this recipe!  I used leftover london broil for the meat and added 1/2 lb mushrooms.  In place of the hoagies I used french bread (doesn't get as soggy.)  We loved the garlic mayo sauce and will definitely be making this recipe again!  Thanks.

O.K., purists, I agree.  I've had Philly cheesesteak in Philly at Pat's King of Steaks.  I agree.  This ain't it.
But to paraphrase the Bard: This sandwich by any name would taste as good.  Only it isn't good... it's great.
So if you want to, give it a name, but for heaven's sake, give it a try.  Thanks, Tera.  But next time, try to be
as innovative with the name as you are with the ingredients.

I took the suggestion of using thick sliced deli roast beef.  My husband devoured these!  The garlic mayo is an excellent touch.  I did use provolone cheese instead of mozzarella because it seems to have more flavor to me.  I also left out the dried oregano because of personal preference.  These were awesome!

I made this the other night and they were great. I had some leftover flatbread so I served them on that. I skipped the whole oven step and added the cheese right into the pan until melted. The garlic mayo made this incredible.

I prepared this sandwich last night and was very happy with it.  I do not have a sweettooth, but love savory dishes and this sandwich is supreme.  I will make it again and again.  Only change is I added more garlic to the mayo dressing.  But if you love steak and garlic, this is definately a keeper.

I made this for a few friends who were coming over and everyone had great things to say about it. I used both mozzarella and provolone cheeses and added extra garlic to the mayo, because we love garlic. I will be making this again.

I made this recipe for 50 of my female hall mates at my college, and they loved it! We used sliced provolone instead of mozzarella and sauted some mushrooms as well. Great recipe!

It was good.  I think next time I will use just garlic powder in the mayo.  The fresh minced garlic was really strong and overpowered the whole sandwich.

My family raved about these sandwiches!  I knew by the look on my husband's face that this was indeed a "keeper."  Thanks so much for sharing this delicious and easy recipe!

I don't think I've ever had an actual philly cheesesteak sandwich so I don't know what to compare these to. I think this recipe is really good. I loved eating the sandwich. I did add provolone cheese too. YUM!

very good! things i would change... i put entirely too much garlic i used a half a cup of mayo and three garlic cloves way to much!! make sure to use a wok pan i used a reg large skillet and had to seperate ingredients and cook in another pan. i used pepper jack cheese i think mozzerella or provelone would be good too! barely toast the bread, the oven toasts the top as well. my bread turned out a little too crunchy. still it was really yummy!!!

This was excellent! My family loved it! The garlic mayo was the tastiest. We will definitely make this one again.
Suggestion: make sure you use the thinnest round you can find and slice it as thin as you can.

It was very good but it seemed like it took forever to cook.
And we just used plain mayo, and still turned out good.

These were good, and I liked the idea of the garlic mayo.  Everytime I make them, they all disappear.
