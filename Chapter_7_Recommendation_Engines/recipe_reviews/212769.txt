First off Jenny, this was a FABULOUS idea to combine such wonderful flavors.  4 stars however because of the changes I made to suit my personal preferences, since the cake lacked that WOW! feature to my tastebuds.  I added 1 tsp each of dried orange peel, nutmeg, and ground cloves as well as 1/2 tsp. ginger, and an extra 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon.  Also, I'm a firm believer that if you decide to leave your diet for a bit and indulge, the indulgence better be over-the-top-worthy, so I added an extra 1/4 cup white sugar, and 1/4 cup pumpkin spice coffee creamer to the batter.  Half-&-half would work just as well, but this added some great flavors.  To finish I had some leftover cranberry sauce in my can, so after I poured half the batter in the pan, I spooned about 3-4 tablespoons cranberry sauce on top, then poured the rest of the batter on.  VERY moist, and it looked rather pretty.  :)  Thanks for giving me the perfect base to work off of, Jenny!

This is a very easy recipe and a great way to use up 1/2 cans of pumpkin and cranberry sauce. Very low fat compared to other quick bread recipes. Great for the holidays.

Yum! My husband and two year old LOVED them! My son begged for more even after eating two.  I added an entire can of pumpkin and a full can of whole cranberry sauce and then only doubled the rest of the recipe (2 eggs, 2 bananas, 2 cups of light brown sugar, 2 1/2 teasps of baking soda, etc.).  I added a little bit more cinnamon, nutmeg, and then some pumpkin pie spice.  Regarding the 3 cups of flour, I made one of those cups of flour whole wheat.    Essentially doubling the recipe led to a full 9 X 5 loaf pan and about 10 muffins.  I put the muffins in for about 20-25 minutes and the loaf in for a little over an hour (until the toothpicks were clean).  DELICIOUS.

Extravagantly moist, with the perfect about of moisture. This will be  my new family recipe that will replace my pumpkin bread recipe of the past.  Less than 1/2 the calories and far fewer carbs for my diabetic needs.  Family raved & begged me to make another one!

I have made this several times in the past month.  We love it!  I did adjust the baking time to 50 minutes and added chopped walnuts.  We are taking two loaves to thanksgiving dinner.  It is very moist.

I have been baking for over 20 years and this is one of the best "bread" recipes I have encountered. It is moist and was a hit with my family and friends when I served it at our weekly coffee clatch.

I really like spice and doubled the recipe in some places, added some things, and may have even tripled it in others. 

I used 2 1/2 cups whole wheat and 1 cup oats. I also added a teaspoon or so of ginger, allspice, and cloves. I added a tablespoon or so of molasses, 30oz spiced pumpkin, 1 teaspoon baking powder, 1/4 cup honey, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar.  I used a full can of whole berry cranberry sauce, and 4 very ripe mashed bananas. 

It made 6 extra large muffins and 2 dozen smaller muffins. The extra large muffins took about 45 minutes and the smaller ones about 40 mins. I baked them simultaneously so this could account for longer than I would have expected cooking time. I tried one of the smaller ones warm and it was yummy. Haven't tried room temperature yet. I think my hubby will like them a lot and he will have one of the extra huge ones for breakfast. I'll be freezing some of these and taking some to a friends house this weekend.

I made this yesterday as my first bread ever! My family turned up their noses at it having 3 unique fruits in it that seemed odd to have paired together, but I forced them to taste it and it was gone quickly! 

I added my own twist. I felt as if it should have a citrus-y aspect and not having oranges or even lemon juice, I resorted to adding sweet and sour mix from my bar. 

My husband is so blunt when it comes to telling me if he does not like something I made but he was all smiles with this one!

*** Another thing i did was add a drizzle with confettionary (spellings off ) sugar, water, vanilla, and cinnamon. Yum!

This was an absolutely perfect base to my first sweet bread.  Because I am a more health-conscious cook and baker, I chose to alter the recipe just slightly to give myself less guilt for eating thirds.  SECONDS.  I meant seconds ;-)
 
In lieu of the cranberry sauce, I chose 1/3 c dried cranberries (prepackaged) put into a small glass dish, adding 1/4 c very hot (almost boiling) simple syrup (1 part water, 1 part sugar), gently pressing cranberries into the bottom of the dish to keep them saturated and allow them to sit for 75 min.  I altered the flour to 1/2 c + 2 Tbsp All-purpose flour and 1/2 c Quinoa flour.  I lessened the salt to 1/2 tsp.  Spices: 6 cloves, ground (my age 6 daughter likes to pound them in the mortar and pestel); 1/2 tsp cinnamon; pinch of ground nutmeg (the Quinoa already has a nutty flavor so omit if you choose); pinch of ground ginger.  I also use 2 bananas (or 1 1/2 if they are fairly large).  This bread tasted better each day that it sat.  I don't know the rule but I leave it out for a few days in it's tin, covered w/plastic wrap.  Delish.  Thanks so much, Jenny!

I always try to "healthify" my baked goods...substituting whole wheat flour and succanant for white flour and white sugar.  Even with my substitutions, this was moist and delicious!

I really wasn't sure what to expect from this recipe - with such a random assortment of ingredients I figured it could either turn out amazing or a total flop. Luckily, it turned out amazing! I made the recipe to a t and what resulted was moist and flavorful! I have issues with getting quick breads to bake all the way through so I decided to make this recipe into muffins instead of a loaf of bread. Baking time was decreased to only 18-20 minutes and yielded 20-ish muffins. I also want to note that it is very important to use the handheld electric mixer to combine the wet ingredients - it broke up the cranberry and banana chunks which was nice so that you weren't surprised by any chunks in the baked product and also to help distribute the flavor more evenly. This recipe is definitely a keeper - great for fall!

Here is my issue-  It was soooo moist that it didn't cook the entire way.  I had made 4 loaves (I did one batch at a time) and I gave one to a family friend and it was not baked all the way through. I had even used a toothpick.  I checked it at an hour and it was nowhere near finished, so I kept it in the over longer and kept checking on it.  After 1 hour and 45 mins, FINALLY a toothpick came out clean.  But apparently that didn't even make a difference. The bottom part was soo moist.  Needed more flour/dry ingredients I believe.  I will try it again with more flour and see how it goes.  Other than that, it tastes good!  I just didn't want to make anyone sick.  Has anyone else had this problem?

I have made this twice.  Did I say moist?  Wow.  This is so delicious and moist and easy to make. My picky 23 yo loved it. The nutmeg makes it. This is my go to quick bread recipe,now.  I actually cooked it in my  steam cooker and it took about 65 minutes til the cake tester came out clean.

Beautifully dense and moist. Love that it had no oil. I had no cranberry sauce so I used "pear sauce"  (mashed overripe pears, but will use applesauce next time) and dried cranberries, about a cup.  I also added ginger and cloves, based on another reviewer.   This one's a keeper-thank you so much.

p.s. I used Splenda brown sugar and egg substitute, still great, less guilt.

Excellent loaf! It is moist, healthy and smells great.  I have made this 3 times and I have changed one thing, I used half the amount of nutmeg. I found the nutmeg too strong when I used the full amount.

The only thing that I did different was sprinkled raw oat meal on top before baking.  Adds a wonderful contrast 
My family really likes this bread. I make small loaves, eat one while warm,  freeze the others.

Easy to make. Moist. Not too sweet. I thought they were bland and uninteresting but if you have someone who likes something that is lightly sweet this may be a great option.

I doubled the batch and made muffins (I didn't have a loaf pan). A double batch yielded 41 muffins. I baked them at 350 degrees for 35-40 minutes. Use liners if you have them - I ran out and the ones without liners are burnt on the outside but just cooked on the inside.

Good way to get rid of extra pumpkin and cranberry but I won't be jumping to make these again.

I took some suggestions and added a little more spices, cloves, pumpkin pie spice and a teaspoon vanilla flavoring.  Also, added walnuts and cranraisins. Made the recipe into mini muffins for a church bake sale.   Tasted delicious. A keeper.
