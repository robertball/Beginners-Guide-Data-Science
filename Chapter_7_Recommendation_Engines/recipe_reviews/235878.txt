Fantastic! Did not need 20 minutes in the oven. Drizzled powdered sugar, milk, & vanilla glaze on top after baking.

I made these exactly how the recipe said for Christmas morning breakfast, they were perfect! The only thing I did differently was I rolled the quarters into balls and then pieced them together in the muffin cups. I will be making these again!

I halved the recipe and used one big can of butter flavored biscuits, cut into 6ths so that each muffin got 4 pieces in a pan of 12. I also added some sliced almonds on top after the caramel. They turned out great, but a little dry. I'm thinking 20 min was a little long in the oven. Next batch, I'll check at 15.

It was good. I would recommend cooking it two minutes longer because it didn't cook all the way.

This recipe gets a five star because it was so easy and buttery and delicious!  The butter and brown sugar makes the incredible caramel that goes so nicely over the muffin sized breads. Husband requested it for dinner as well as the snack that we had.  Great recipe!

These muffins are a huge hit!  The only thing I do different is use an apple slicer to cut the biscuits into about 9 or 10 smaller pieces.  Otherwise I follow as is and love it!
