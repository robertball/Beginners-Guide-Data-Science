Mild lemon flavor.  Wonderful companion to cup of hot coffee.

Given that I love lemon, I really wanted to like this bread. It ended up tasting fine--not five-star delicious, but good. However, it really came out as more of a cake. It barely rose at all in the oven, and the loaf really only ended up about two inches thick. I followed the recipe exactly, except for omitting the nuts and sweetening the lemon juice more at the last step. Maybe next time I'll make a double batch and make it a 9x13 cake. But as a loaf of bread, this just doesn't cut it.

A delightful bread with just the right amount of lemon flavor - not too tart and not too sweet. It was moist, yet firm, and made perfect slices when cut. Before grating the lemon peel, I squeezed the lemon and strained and reserved the juice for use in the glaze. The bread was golden brown and done in the center at 45 min., so be careful with the baking time.

This was great served as a dessert.  It's a dense bread, so it's like a cake, but it's not too sweet.  Perfect with tea!

I am usually very good at following recipes, but I think I must have done something wrong. The center wouldn't cook even after 50 minutes, then my whole family agreed that it tasted awful.

I substituted canola oil (slightly less) for the butter, and orange juice for the milk, because my whole family is lactose intolerant. These substitutions are usually fine, and don't result in disaster!

Like other reviews said, it's more of a cake than a bread. 

I had added 1/2 tsp. of salt and mixed the baking powder with the flour instead of the liquid ingredients. Next time, I will use the zest and juice of two lemons instead of just one since we like a really strong lemon flavor.

Had extra lemons that I needed to use and found this recipe. Served it to a group of friends and they were soon fighting over the last piece. The glaze really makes the overall product. The bread does rise in the center so make sure to let the bread cool down sufficiently before applying glaze or else it will all run to edges. I was in a rush so didn't have time to do this but it tasted great fresh out of the oven!

I made 10 muffins out of this recipe. The batter turned out *really* liquidy, but the muffins rose pretty well. I added poppy seeds on top. Lemony and sugary--not too bad!

Be sure not to overcook this.  It will turn out dry. 
I added a little lemon extract to the batter as I wanted lemon flavor to more than just the frosting.

This bread is wonderful! I've never baked bread from scratch before so I was nervous. But this turned out moist , tangy, and flavorful...and it was easy to make. My boyfriend can't stop raving about it.

Me and my Mom made this today, but we made a few changes. We didn't use any lemon zest in the mixture, and we took out the nuts also. And we made a glaze with the confectioners' sugar and lemon juice instead of letting it soak into the bread. We used about 3/4 cup of confectioners' sugar, a couple spoons of water, and just 1 tbsp of lemon juice and poured this mixture over the bread. It was delicious and we will definitely be making it again. :)

I was a little disappointed with how dry it was. I guess I should have made a "Cake" instead of a "bread". Not too lemony either.

I doubled the lemon zest and used 4 tablespoons of lemon juice in the batter. To compensate for the extra liquids I added 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder and 1/4 of flour. The lemon taste is noticeable but not overwhelming. I also added 1/2  teaspoon of vanilla extract.

Delicious!  And best when warm.  I love how the sweetened lemon juice combines so nicely with the rest of the bread.

Absolutely not making this again. It took almost twice as long to cook compared to the directions on the recipe. I had to put foil around the edges of the bread to keep from burning while I kept cooking, waiting for the center to get done.

Tasty!  I made a few changes:  didn't have butter or margarine so I used 3 oz. of canola oil.  Also added a Tbsp of poppy seeds.  It's a winner and easy to make.

5.10.17   Instead of one large loaf, I baked in three mini loaf pans for 32 minutes @ 350ºF.  Texture of the bread is light, and the lemon flavor is subtle.  If you want more of a lemon-y flavor, would recommend adding more lemon zest and juice.  We enjoyed it for breakfast today with a cup of java.

I'm not a big lemon fan but my family loves it and even i had 2 pieces of this bread. I baked it in a glass loaf pan so I decreased the temp by 25 degrees, other than that I followed the recipe as is. Delicious!

Delicious! Loved this lemon bread!  I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't use the glaze. The bread was perfect for us without it.  It took mine the 65 min. to bake.   Next time I am going to add poppy seeds for a little change.  Thank you for this great recipe!

It was a good recipe. I omitted the nuts since I prefer my lemon loaf nut free. I also added more zest and 2Tbs of lemon juice to the batter for stronger flavor. I also made more glaze. However I think next time I need to add a pinch of salt to really enhance the flavor of the zest and the sweetness of the sugar.

I made this with changes. I increased the servings to 16 so that it uses a half cup of butter. I used almonds instead of walnuts and substituted the milk with half lemon juice half sour cream. I baked it in a 9x13 pan for 28 minutes. I wish that I had increased the recipe by an additional third as it looks pretty thin in the pan

Very tasty!  Super easy to make too.  Mine was good to go after only 50 minutes, 45 may have possibly even been sufficient.  Definitely be careful not to overcook it!  I have made this using zest and also extract when I ran out of lemons but wanted my "fix" anyway! Also left out nuts as we do not like them in baked goods.  The only other change I made was NOT poking holes in the cake, and adding more confectioners sugar to the lemon juice for the glaze so that it was a little thicker.
