It could use a bit more flavor, but it's a quick and easy alternative to store-bought salad dressing.

Not a ton of flavor, but if you are using it in salad with strong components (red onion, black olives, pepperoncinis, seasoned croutons), it is fine.  I used a ratio of 2:1 oil:vinegar instead of 1:1.

This was tasty for not having much going on in the way of spices. I was making a salad w/ lots of additions, so I knew that this would be fine, but IMO, if you're gonna use this on just a plain old salad, I would add some more seasonings (like garlic and such) and salt and pepper, for sure. Nice and simple...Thanks for sharing. ;)
