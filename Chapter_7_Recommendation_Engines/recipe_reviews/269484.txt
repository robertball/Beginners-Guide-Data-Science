This is a great way to eat tacos without the mess
Very easy to make. I cannot eat spicy foods so I used a mild salsa. Not only did I make it, I have made it several times

You can actually add cold chopped items at the end, like tomatoes, lettuce and cilantro for better flavor and more crunch.

Did not use the black olives (don't like them) nor the jalapeno peppers (didn't have any).  It was good.  3 minutes in my broiler was WAY too long, the edges of the chips got burnt.  Also I would recommend spraying the foil with non stick cooking spray before placing the chips on it, the chips and cheese stuck to the foil.  We liked the seasonings, although don't put a lot of salt on the meat as the chips are already salty.  Will make this again.

Great as a meal or appetizer. Comfort food at it's best. I used nonstick aluminum foil.
