I will make this recipe again. I added 1/2 tsp. of sugar to kick up the flavor.  It' a healthy way to have cole slaw without all the calories.

One cup of celery rootwas way too much - it totally overpowered every mouthful. The apple cider dressing was wonderful.

Nice salad! I used a bag of coleslaw that needed using up.  I also used white balsamic vinegar and celery powder, not seed. The salad did require a good bit of salt for flavor.  We added a healthy pinch of crushed red pepper for some heat.  Nice on it's own or as an addition to a garden salad.  Would be amazing on a pork sandwich!
