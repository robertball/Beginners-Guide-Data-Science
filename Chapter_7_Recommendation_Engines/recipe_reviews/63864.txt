For all the yummy ingredients, you would think that the dish would have more flavor.  Maybe it was using fennel seed and cummin seed instead of the ground version.  Every once in a while you would get a burst of flavor, but overall, it was rather bland.  It is certainly a very hearty dish.

I love chili & am always looking for exotic recipes.  This recipe was very, very good.  I added about 2 teaspoons of salt and a tablespoon of chili powder to kick up the flavor a bit.  Overall it has a nice mild taste & a very creamy consistency.  Loved the bacon in it.  Be sure to serve with some fresh lime wedges to squeeze on top.  The lime is definitely the final touch!

Flavor was okay, but the family would NOT eat this and it made a huge pot of chili.  Not sure what I will do with the leftovers.

As a dietitian, I love the variety of vitamins all the ingredients in this recipe offer! Tried this out for the first time on some friends and everyone enjoyed it. I didn't realize there would be different options of "heat" for the tomatoes with green chilies. I picked the Rotel Original and got one big can instead of 2 smaller cans and felt that the heat of the chilies overpowered some of the other flavors in the chili, so next time I will get the mild. Used turkey bacon and topped with fresh lime, left out the fennel seed. Left everything else the same and served with cornbread and fresh pineapple for dessert. Tasted even better reheated!

WOW! This is really great. I was a little concerned as I was adding all the ingredients, but it came out wonderful! It has a nice smokey taste to it and seems more like a mixture of Mexican and Jamaican flavors. The consistency is a little more like bean/vegetable soup than chili, but the flavor is outstanding. I did not have fennel so we omitted that, I used turkey bacon instead of regular bacon, and we had fresh pumpkin puree we used instead of canned. A hit with my family, even our seven year old loved this. Thanks for the great keeper recipe!
