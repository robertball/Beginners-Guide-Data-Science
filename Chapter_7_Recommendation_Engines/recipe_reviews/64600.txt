These were good. I didn't have access to mini muffin pans...so I used 2 wonton wrappers and used the regular sized pan.  I do think it was a little bit bland, and I would like to try this fried instead of baked.  All in all, good recipe.  Thanks for the post.

Fantastic!  I used regular sized muffin tins and layered the wonton wrappers to fill the bottom of the tin.  Then, rather than baking for the full 7 minutes, I baked them for 5 minutes, added the filling and baked for another 4 minutes.  Everything was warm, bubbly and eaten very quickly!  Will definately use this one again!

I had some trouble finding the wonton wrappers because my grocery store doesn't have the widest ethnic section and they were out. But, we did find it and this was awesome! Will definitely serve again.

This was wonderful. I did not have mini muffin pans either, so I used the bigger ones, but I layered them and they turned out fine. I also baked the cups until they were crisp then added the spinach dip in and sprinkled them with shredded parmesan until it was brown. I had two of them, when I came home the next day my boyfriend had finished them ALL, I think he liked them too :)

These would have been better fried like a wonton instead of baked. The baskets turned out very hard. I would also recommend chopping the spinach to small bits and not strands.

Although this recipe looks impressive, the taste was very bland.  I tried adding in salt, black pepper, cayenne and a little extra garlic powder but still wasn't happy with the flavor.

Great recipe!  I wrapped the wontons and deep fried them instead of making baskets.  It turned out wonderfully.  I think I will try the dip with puff pastry next time.  I used regular bullion (1/2 cube) and it worked out fine.  Definitely a good recipe!

These were fantastic. The wonton baskets were a breeze to make and really impressed my guests. The dip was good - but I would add a little chili powder to spice it up a bit.

Very good.  Colorful and tasty but making the "basket" was difficult.  The first pan I used was not deep enough (Chicago) so they ended up as saucers.  The second pan was deeper (Wilton) and worked out better but I would probably buy the premade baskets next time.
