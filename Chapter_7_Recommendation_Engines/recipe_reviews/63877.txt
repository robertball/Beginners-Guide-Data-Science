They were pretty good...the sweetness of the beans inside the quesadillas balanced with the taste of the salsa. 

I was careful not to put the beans too close to the edge of the tortillas, since the sauce ran a little bit.  We have a quesadilla maker, which worked well with this recipe.

We did not have the onions...and I used a pack of pre-diced green, yellow, and red peppers.  We'll make this recipe again!
