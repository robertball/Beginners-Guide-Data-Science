26.18  I have to be honest and say that I screwed this one up.  Instead of slicing the puff pastry roll and baking the slices, I baked the whole roll and then, obviously, it didn’t slice very well with cream cheese running all over the place...my bad!  Today, I used what I had in the fridge, so that started with Dill, Feta and Garlic Cream Cheese Spread (a recipe on this site, which by the way was delicious in this particular recipe) instead of plain cream cheese.  I didn’t have quite enough ham, so I added some salami, as well.  The taste on these pinwheels is delicious, and my apologies to superchef for not following the directions.  Next time I make these, I promise to cook the way the recipe is written and post a better picture!
