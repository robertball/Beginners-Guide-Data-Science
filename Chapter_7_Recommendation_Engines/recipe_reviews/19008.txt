I hate to be the only negative reviewer, but I have to say that this recipe is only average.  Easy to make and looks impressive in a trifle bowl, but truthfully, the overall taste is a bit unsophisticated.  Also, the ingredients are too much to fit in a standard 3 qt trifle bowl.  One  package of pudding and 1 tub of cool whip would have been plenty.  The best part was the kahlua soaked cake.  Maybe I'll try this again but use a homemade pudding and real whip cream instead.

Wow, I made this for a group of people from different parts of the globe. One man from Paris said he had never had anything like this in America, he said it was like an orgasm! I added fresh raspberries and only use 2 cups of milk for the pudding(vs 4 cups) this made it thicker. This is a must for any party, it looks and tastes great.

I have made this several times before and used brownies instead of cake mix. I also have used chocolate mousse instead of the pudding. It is always a treat!

I made this with a Duncan Hines chocolate cake, baked, cooled and cut in chunks.  Used 2 chocolate instant puddings with 3 cups of milk instead of the 4 per the packages. I used Heath bar toffee chips that can be bought in the supermarket and Cool Whip. I didn't use liqueur.  It was a big hit over the holidays and barely any work to make.  I'll definitely make it again for a summer barbeque dessert.

Very good! I made this recipe for a "special Christmas lunch" with a friend.  I was a little short on time and I didn't need a huge bowl of it so...I bought Entenmann's brownie bites, cut them into cubes and placed them in a bowl. I kind of swished Kahlua on them (coffee flavored liquer), let it soak in.  I made whipped cream rather than use cool whip (but I'm sure cool whip is fine).  I also found Heath Crumbles in my baking section of the supermarket with the chocolate chips.  TA DAH.  Rather than make a big bowl, I used 2 water goblet type glasses, and layered everything in there.  Looked very appetizing and my friend loved it.  I only made 1 pkg of chocolate pudding and I would say it would make 3 "water goblet" desserts.

This was good, but it must be eaten in one setting, if you store the leftovers, it gets very runny due to the Kahlua.

Sinfully good.  Very high in fat.  I lightened the fat by using fat free whipped topping and skim milk in the pudding.  It was still excellent.

Very good but too much pudding and cool whip.  I did not have a bowl big enough for it all anyway.  Next time I would use the same amount of cake and candy but just one box of pudding and one tub of cool whip.  Would be fun to experiment with different candy bars, too.

I made this for a barbeque I went to lastnight, and it was a hit!  I didn't have kahlua so I used Bailey's Irish Cream and mmmm, it was so good.  It made a huge amount too!  I had to use just a big bowl!  Nobody went home hungry, thanks for posting this recipe!

I'm not a big chocolate fan but everyone else in my household is. Everyone thought it was really good...even me. It doesn't keep well, though, so be prepared to eat it all...and it makes alot. I used Bailey's Irish Creme instead of Kahlua because that's what I had in the house. Very good dessert.  Thanks!   Erin

This was a huge hit at a BBQ that we went to. I followed others advice and used dark chocolate mouse instead of pudding and Betty Crocker Fudge Brownie mix instead of cake. There were children at the BBQ so I wasn't comfortable using the alcohol. I bought a coffee flavored Starbucks Frappacino out of the refridgerated section at the store. I did not use a whole cup (it would have been way too much), after I cut the brownie up into bite size pieces I poured the cofee over the brownies and stirred it together until it was moist and the brownies stopped soaking up the liquid. The coffee flavor was suttle and not overpowering. I also used the creamy Cool Whip instead of regular. It turned out fantastic and I made it again later that week for a office birthday celebration. We will definately be making this again. Thank you for the recipe.

Why not use the chocolate flavored Cool Whip?  Other reviewers are right....too much pudding and Cool Whip, so as they suggested, cut those ingredients in half.  Throw in some sliced fresh strawberries.  Serve with espresso for a real jolt!

Excellent recipe, but my kids didn't enjoy the liquor.  Big surprise there.  You could leave it out and have a very good kid recipe.  But the adults thoroughly enjoyed!

Love,love,love this!  I use brownies instead of chocoalate, the brownies seem to hold the Kalua better and don't get soggy the day after.  This is a dessert that you can have a small amount and feel very satisfied

Made this as one of my Thanksgiving desserts and what a BIG hit! I didn't even get any. I made a few changes. I only used 2 small pkgs of instant chocolate pudding and (1)12oz container of cool whip. Instead of liqueur I made the Satiny Chocolate Glaze found on this website and drizzled it over the cake and I topped half with crushed Butterfingers and the other half with crushed Oreos. I will be making again for Xmas.

I made this for a gathering of 16 people, and thought "I made too much!".  Guess what!  There was nothing left after the party was over.  Great for a large crowd, and tastes better if it sits awhile (I made mine the night before).

Absolutely delicious!!!  Especially if you like chocolate.  This recipe could be made more kid friendly by using coffee instead of the coffee-flavored liquer.  I skipped the shaved chocolate on the top and crushed an extra toffee candy bar on top.  I made the cake the day ahead.  The assembly is VERY quick and easy.

My family loved this!! Made it for my dad's birthday & it was great! Just did it 4 hours before dinner...used an entire package of Skor crushed candy (in the choc. chip isle) like other suggested, thanks! We're using it for my cousin's wedding shower too.

This is an excellent summer dessert.  It's easy to make,light but rich,and even has eye appeal.  I like that you an change the degree of difficulty by making each ingredient by scratch.  It has great flavor and texture.

Delicious!  I don't know how you could mess this up!  One word of caution though, this makes a LOT!  I used a large glass salad bowl and still had extra ingredients.

I made this recipe after my Bundt cake got stuck in the pan and crumbled on its way out.  Rather than throw it out, I decided to make this for my kids.  I did not use the liqueur, and used peanut butter cups instead of toffee bars, just trying to use what I already had on hand.  Kids loved it, and I managed to sneak a few bites while they weren't looking.  Great way to use up a cake that doesn't turn out.

This is an excellent dessert. I changed it a bit by using Snickers instead of Heath, and Bailey's instead of coffee-flavored liquor. (My family and friends liked the Bailey's recipe more.) I also make the pudding from scratch, which makes a huge difference in the chocolate flavor of the dessert.

I've made this at least 10 times now. Sometimes I add a layer of cherry pie filling or strawberries to add a layer of color and another flavor. DELICIOUS!

Ok, so I make my own chocolate cake, instead of using the mix. I used Oreo cookies, crunched up, instead of the toffee bar. And I used real whipped cream instead of the frozen whipped topping. Loved it. Turned out great! Very quick to assemble, and really tasty. Something I may try next time us using some Chocolate Mouse too. I think that would be a fun addition :)

This dessert will make your guests eyes roll back into their heads.  I have been asked to make this one over and over again.  I use Cafe Rica (a coffee liquor from Costa Rica).

I love making this recipe with Kaluha and using the crushed toffee bar on top. (I make the cake the day before and let the Kaluha soak into it  overnight in the fridge) Everyone loves this recipe!  Not good as a left over dessert, as the pudding begins to separate.

I had leftover cake and thought I would try this. the mixed reviews made me hold off on the coffee liqueur. It was ok. Not nearly as good as using brownie, which I normally do. Any added liquid would have made this a mess. The cake stayed plenty moist but the flavor wasn't as good as the version I do with the brownie and coffee liqueur. Will probably stick to that one since I think it is great.

I've made this recipe for years (less milk though) and it does keep very well for a couple of days if you don't soak the cake in alcohol.  We don't drink so there's no extra fluid in the cake.  That's what makes it soupy.  So just don't put the liquid in and it will keep.

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner.  Used some of the suggestions like Bailey's and less milk for the pudding.  Turned out GREAT.  I did not have problems with the leftovers getting running (probably because of less milk and I used whole milk)  My 15 year old is already asking me when I am making it again.  Think I will and just make half the recipe.

I used a yellow cake mix, and the outcome resembled a tirimisu!  Yummy!  You can buy the Skor candy already crushed (located by the choc chips in the grocery store)...makes the recipe that much easier.  Although I did whip my own whipping cream, it would prob be just as easy to buy the cool whip.  It turned out scrumptious!

I made four servings of this wonderful dessert for myself and my boyfriend for our anniversary. I ate one but my boyfriend said he was too full to eat dessert that night. But...when I woke up the next morning the other three glasses were sitting empty on our coffee table! Ha. He still begs me to make more! So ladies never forget the way to a mans heart is ALWAYS through his stomach..and chocolate is best!

WHOA!  THE 12 SERVINGS COULD HAVE FED 12 HORSES! COULD HAVE USED MORE CAKE. INSTANT PUDDING WAS A BIT THIN. I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE IT'S ME, BUT COOL WHIP IS VERY BORING AND DOESN'T TASTE LIKE REAL WHIP CREAM AT ALL!

This has always been my favorite cake. A woman that I work with gave me this recipe years ago, but called it a Kahlua Trifle and added a tad bit more Kahlua. Since then, I make this every chance that I get. It's so wonderful that I'm always asked to make it for every birthday, Thanksgiving, and XMas!! I always have made it the night before so all of the flavors can combine.

LEFTOVERS???? I don't think I have ever taken home a dirty bowl or spoon b/c everyone practially licks them both clean. This is a WONDERFUL recipe and it's nice b/c you can have fun w/ it and add what you know your family likes... I add some carmel between the layers and of course the crushed Health Bar candies throughout the layers and I would be kicked out of a party if I didn't bring this dessert!

I made this for Christmas Eve and it was gone! I used Kaluha for the liqueur and a premium toffee made by a local candy company. I would recommend using the best toffee you can find locally. Delicious and attractive for special occasions.

Exceptional dessert for a dinner party because it is inviting to the eye, not too rich, and filled with surprise as you taste.  It clearly invites conversation.  I will serve this again.  3 people have already text me and asked that I share the recipe.  THAT’s agreat sign.  Thank you allrecipes!

Sooooooo gooood.... This was a last-minute thing for me, but it worked out beautifully! Made a 9 x 13 cake, and then grabbed it by the handful of and crumbled it into a pan. It was fun, albeit messy :). Used chocolate pudding, 1 container of normal whipped cream and 1 of chocolate whipped cream, chocolate chips, and caramel syrup. DIVINE!!! Crumbled cake, topped with some caramel syrup in place of coffee liquor, then pudding, normal whipped cream, more caramel syrup. Repeated, with chocolate whipped cream this time. Topped with chocolate chips and drizzled with caramel syrup. Took this to a high school band potluck, and it was completely gone, scraped clean. Perfect for big events, and very easy!

Amazing!!!! I did find that it was a lot of ingredients so I made two dishes. I also used brownies and only 3 cups milk like other reviewers suggested. Other than that the recipe was perfect! I shaved Ghirardelli semi sweet chocolate and stuck a couple squares in for decoration. Everyone at my holiday party loved it! Thank you for the easy recipe.

Everyone loved this trifle!!!  I used good-ole Betty Crocker cake mix: 1 box, Hershey instant pudding: 2 boxes, frozen whipped cream, Copa De Oro coffee liqueur, I looked all over to find toffee bars... so I took the new Crunch bites: 1 1/2 bags(whole), and a bag of Werthers Original and crushed all the candies (powder or chucks, doesn't matter). The texture was perfect and the taste was delicious!
