I made this dish - it was very bland and tasteless.  Will never make it again.

Sue, I have been making this recipe for about 6 months now.  I have been meaning to rate it but just kept forgetting.  I can never thank you enough.  This recipe is out of this world.  I make a double batch at least  twice a week.  Do you have anymore like this?  I also want to share this with you, my parrot named Hercules, loves this dish.  He knows what I am making from the very start.  After that, anytime I get the container from the fridge, he goes bananas.  He just can't wait till he gets a piece.   I bought special bowls to store it in and a medium size chopper.  I can never thank you enough for this great recipe.  Thank you, thank you and thank you over and over again.

WOW!  Easy - great - different and GONE!  Made it for a family get together - and it was a hit! I opted to use only the imitation crabmeat.  Will make it often!

This is hands down one of the BEST seafood salad recipes! Loved it!  When I prepared mine, I omitted the onions.  But next time I will add chopped celery to give it that 'crunch'.  The French dressing combined with dressing and milk really gives this salad a 'bang'.  I highly reccommend you try this recipe. You won't be disappointed!

Husband liked it! My daughter even ate some of it. I thought it was a bit sweet so I might cut down on the sugar next time.  I will also cut down on the recipe; made way too much for my family.

This recipe was a hit, particularly with my son who ate most of it. I'll make it again.

I needed to make some changes and was a bit sad that the seafood broke up so much but overall I liked this dish.  It would probably be better with fresh seafood and possibly even with imitation crab meat.  I added cayenne, vinegar, and lemon juice along with a few other spices to liven it up a bit.  I forgot the milk and also added green peppers and hard boiled eggs.  Thanks for the easy recipe.

This was a good recipe. Very tasty. I added scallions and celery for some added flavor and crunch. Really good.

I like added salt when boiling the pasta, I also boiled fresh shrimp with the pasta, added some white pepper, fine chopped onion, dill weed and a pinch of cocktail sauce.

I would never have thought about using a tomato style dressing with a seafood salad.  Thanks for a great idea.
