ok...Like another reviewer said earlier - when I actually got down to making this - the instructions  had a lot of holes in it... Unless perhaps you have made Kolaches and know a bit about the results in advance..
For example...Is the sausage supposed to be cooked?? Raw???.  Silly me...I made it with uncooked links and it turned out gross with everything melted on top of raw meat. I could only fit a teaspoon of hash browns in them if I made the bals the size instructed to make them!  So we cooked them and tried again..My daughter and I burst out laughing at the amount we could fit on this little bit of dough...  "ok..and you can have one teaspoon of potato on yours!"   I could not ...get THAT many balls out of the recipe and had even doubled each piece and still there was no room to stuff them.  Was I even suppossed to stuff them or leave the stuff on top.  We tried it both ways..because we did not know. I wondered if by chance I was shaping them incorrectly.  I too eventually went to the internet in an attempt to find a picture  Too vague and for me this meant an eventual flop which never got to the table.  I finally got tired of trying to make this work and what should have been my Christmas Morning Masterpiece ended up in the garbage on Christmas Eve... a total waste of ingredients and time.  I will not make this again without clearer instructions!  I guessed wrong!  I think??
 Sorry - I am usually not this hard on the recipes on this site.

This recipe is almost identical to the one I use, with the exception of mine calling for water and dry milk vs. warm milk. For those of you having trouble, it may help you to have tried or even seen a kolache before. There are different types, some with fruit typically place on top of the dough and baked, and the breakfast type filled with sausage, ham, cheese, etc. "Filled" being the key word here. The way I do it is: I cut the dough after getting out of the bread maker into 12 equal pieces. I then flaten into oblong shapes, brush with melted butter, and stuff with sausage & cheese (whatever fillings). I use american cheese and smoked breakfast sausage links (smoked meaning already cooked) that I usually find at Kroger. Close the rolls and pinch the openings shut as best as you can. Then brush tops with more melted butter and bake. Being a native Houstonian, this is as close as I've been able to come to the real thing offered at every donut shop in Texas after having to move to Alabama. Hope this helps.

I too moved from Texas and never thought I'd ever have Kolaches again in Washington State.  When I found this recipe - I was so excited and even more elated to find out how Yummy they were! The dough is as sweet as the Kolaches back in Houston and I can't believe how easy it is to make the dough in my bread machine.  Now everytime we have guests, I make these.  The instructions for making the dough the night before work like a charm!  I stuff mine with Lil Smokies in place of the hash browns, cheese and sausage (glorified pigs-in-the-blanket I know, but those were my favorite kind of kolaches back in Texas).  I also brush them with melted butter 2/3 of the way through the cooking.  Yum, yum, yum!

I didn't have a bread machine so I used my kitchenaid mixer, the kind that can probably take over the world some day. I ended up with a franken recipe from that manual which goes as follow: I heated the milk, sugar, and butter on low heat until it was dissolved/melted. Per my franken recipe instructions I mixed dry ingredients together (-1/2 cup flour) and then added liquids gradually. Last I slowly added the rest of the flour. It turned out really well.

I formed the dough balls and let those sit overnight in the fridge, but I probably should have made them up until the point they are popped in the oven because it kinda had a weird crust the next day. Still turned out good, but if you are preparing them for overnight storage make sure you fold in the fillings before they siesta in the frig.

Thanks for the delicious recipe!

These were pretty yummy and authentic, but I made some changes to suit our diet and palate. I like mine to be a litlle bit more sweet and healthier at the same time. I subbed the 3 cups of bread flour with 2 cups WHOLE WHEAT bread flour and 1 cup reg. bread flour. Then, instead of 1/4 cup sugar, I made it 1/2 cup sugar. I filled it with only fully-cooked sausage and cheese, no hashed browned potatoes.  Also, the recipe didn't have very detailed instructions in the end on how to fill and roll these, so unless you know what a kolache looks likes, I can see where people get confused. I would make a golf-sized ball with floured hands (it can be quite sticky) and put it on a floured surface. Flatten out the ball and use a wooden roller to roll it out into a circle about 3/8" or about 1 cm thick. In the center of the circle, place the filling (savory filling in this case if the filling will be INSIDE the kolache) and take one end of circle, fold over the filling and roll. Pinch the ends close and fold over seam. Place the kolache seam-size down on parchment paper on a baking sheet.They should resemble an oblong short, hot-dog bun. Alternatively, you can make it look like little round dinner rolls as well depending on type of filling you're using. I have also seen a sweet filling on top of the dough, resembling a more of a danish. You can try all kinds of fillings, which is why kolaches are so great - bacon and eggs, goat cheese and spinach, ham, egg and cheese, etc, etc.

My favorite so far!  I normally use crescent rolls to wrap the sausages in, but this was so much better.  I didn't have a bread machine so I mixed the sugar, milk and yeast together and added it to the dry mix (I added the butter to the dry mix right before I added yeast mixture).  I then let in rise for an hour or two. Then wrapped the little smokies with a small piece of dough, let rise again for 15 min. and then baked for 16 min.  I think I'm going to use this dough for dinner rolls from now on...its just that good.

After moving from Texas to New Jersey I was afraid I'd never find these again. The first time I saw this I knew I had to make them.  They are wonderful!  I didn't use the hashbrowns and used shreded cheddar in place of the sliced cheddar (since I had it in the fridge already).My family and several family friends devoured these in minutes.  Great to make ahead and store for a day or two in the fridge.  I microwaved them for 20 seconds each & they were like great!  If you are ever planning a brunch, you really should add these to the menu!   Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I love the simplicity of this recipe, but I almost didn't try it after reading some of the reviews.

But I was really interested so I read the entire recipe, and I found where others had made a big mistake

The original recipe was for 36 Kolaches, so that is what the directions are based on, but the ingredients section has been changed for 18 servings (us) 

We used the dough split in half and made 9 breakfast kolaches and 9 fruit kolaches and it was wonderful.  we baked the desert ones the same day and stored the breakfast ones in the fridge for the next morning and they were amazing.

when you truly read the entire recipe you will have fantastic results that are so yummy.  Thank You Melissa V

My husband fell in love with Kolaches when we visited Houston -- the kolaches from this recipe are even better.  We make them at least one Saturday morning a month.  We stuff them with just sausage links (like the sausage rolls at the donut shop, Wranglers cheese & jalapeno sausages are the best -- but spicy!) and cheese (we thought the hashbrowns got a little mushy the first time so we skip them now).  They are great for breakfast for the rest of the week.

I am delighted to find this recipe.  I bought the hash browns but couldn't get them to stay on the dough, so I just put them back in the freezer.  Besides, I never had them in the kolaches back home in Texas.  Next time I'll cut the cheese in 'sticks' and wrap the dough around the cheese and sausage.  I used the little smokies as some other reviewers suggested and they were great.

This is exactly what I was hoping for! Light tender soft dough wrapped around a smoky sausage. Just like the doughnut shops here in Texas serve. Only better because it came from my kitchen and I have 36 of these. (Well, I did but DH and I ate 5 of these already taste testing them.) I left out the hash browns and cheese and just used beef little smokies. The next time I will make a variety of sausage & jalapeno and ham & cheese too. Wonderful easy EASY recipe. No kneading! I made this without a bread machine. I warmed the milk and sugar in a saucepan, (I didn't measure the temp as candy thermometer is who knows where? so I felt it and when it was warm on my finger, like a baby's bottle would be, warm not hot, I added the yeast and 1 c bread flour and mixed it, then covered it and let it stand an hour. I then added in the melted butter, salt, egg and rest of the flour. I stirred what I could with a wooden spoon and then used my hands to mix in the last bits of flour. I then covered the bowl and let this rise until it was doubled, then divided it 36 pieces. They seemed really small, but they did rise up and the sausages fit perfectly! I didn't really make in indentation I just laid the sausage in the middle and wrapped the edges up over and pinched the edges shut and put it seam side down on the baking sheet. I didn't know this, but bread machine yeast IS regular yeast. Thanks for this recipe and to everyone else who gave me tips for making these turn out perfectly.

I found the directions for these to be a little vague.  Having randomly stumbled upon this recipe, I decided to try it, never having seen actual kolaches before.In the end, I  had to search around on the internet for better directions for assembling them.  I found it easier to roll the sausages up like pigs in a blanket rather than just placing them on the centre of the dough.  Good, but nothing spectacular.

These were wonderful!  When reading the reviews that they were "just like the ones I had in Texas," I was skeptical, but these are indeed very similar to my favorite Austin kolaches.  I divided my dough into 18 oblong (2"x4") flattened pieces and let them rise, as directed.  Then brushed each with some melted butter, sprinkled with a few pinches of shredded cheddar, added 3 jarred jalapenos (drained well), some more cheese, and a pre-cooked smoked breakfast sausage link.  Rolled each up tightly and pinched together the top and ends well, facing them seam side down for baking.  If desired, brush each with a little melted butter for the last 5 minutes of baking time.  I also prepared them all the night before, brought to room temp in the morning and baked the ones we were to eat that morning as directed on my pizza stone.  The rest will keep in the fridge for a couple of days so we can bake them fresh each morning, and we'll freeze whatever we have left.  Perfect!

This worked well with a few changes of convience.  Do not have bread machine, so mixed the heated milk and sugar to about 115 degrees and added the yeast.  Allowed that to foam about 10 minutes, then added the melted butter, egg, and combined dry ingredients by hand.  Covered the whole thing and allowed to rise several hours then made a few with small sausages.  Put the remaining dough in fridge, covered, overnight, and made some more for breakfast the following day.  Put remaining dough back in fridge and will make some more and see how the freezing process comes out with these.  Thanks for sharing a winning recipe for one of DH's favorite treats!

Thank you so much for this recipe! I've never made any sort of bread before and was surprised at how easy it was.  I don't have a bread machine so I mixed the flour and yeast together and then added the warm milk and other ingredients.  It came out perfectly! Usually when I use refrigerated dough, the bottoms get too brown or hard.  These tasted like I bought them at a bakery! Reminded me of the ones I used to get at Prasek's in Hilje, TX! Thank you again!

I made cloverleaf rolls for dinner last night from this recipe and it was fabulous.  When dough is ready in breadmaker, punch down and remove to lightly floured countertop.  Pinch off and roll dough into balls and place three in each muffin tin.  Cover lightly and set aside to rise about 30 minutes or until doubled.  Pop into 375 degree oven until golden brown.  I didn't egg wash prior to baking, wasn't necessary.  They were a lovely golden brown.  Absolutely perfecto!!!

OMG!!!  I think I've died and gone to Texas heaven!  I now live on a remote island, about 30 miles off the coast of Northern Vancouver Island, in British Columbia, Canada......  Talk about a long way from Houston, Texas!  I've asked around about Kolaches and nobody has heard of them within 500 miles!  LOL!!  These taste just like Kolaches from home!  (P.S. they just came out of the oven and I can't stop eating them!)  Thank you for this recipe!

These were great.  If you don't have a bread machine, you have to use two packets of yeast.  I filled with scrambled eggs, cheese and jalapenos, made them into little, or not so little, balls and baked.  Rancheros all the way!

10 Star recipe!  I grew up in Texas and can attest that this is a GREAT kolache recipe.  I can't wait to make the dough again and just make into rolls as it is the best "roll" recipe I have found.  I used Johnsonville Cheddar Sausages, cut in half, and used 1/2 in each roll.  I made the rolls into oblong pieces rather than balls.  I've never had hashbrowns in a kolache so I didn't even think of putting them in.  Also, I made only 12 rolls instead of 18.  Perfect!

5 stars for wonderful bread minus 1 star for incomplete directions.  The sausage needs to be cooked sausage and the hash browns are better if you precook them also.  I cut my dough into 12 pieces, rolled each into a small tortilla size circle, put a 1/4 slice of cheese some crumbled,cooked sausage, then hash browns.  Pinched the dough up tight, then a small twist to seal well then bake twist side down.  They come out about the size of a hamburger bun.  Only took 15 min. to cook.  The bread is the best runza, cabbage burger, kolaches bread I have tried so far!!!!  Is great with cooked apples, walnut, cinnamon filling instead of the meat filling also.

This has become my go to recipe for all sorts of rolls.  I did make a few tweaks to the recipe: I added 2 whole eggs instead of the 1 egg and 1 yolk and I found I had to increase the flour to 4 cups.  I also roll out the little dough balls and brush them with olive oil or butter before I put in my stuffing ingredients.  My whole family asks me to make these every week.

I have made this recipe several times, but I can never seem to get the bread to come out just right. I don't have a bread machine either. I prefer softer bread so I think that I will try to find a softer bread recipe. If anyone has any suggestions they would be appreciated. I use Johnsonville Beddar Cheddar sausages and they work great.

I live in Texas and love  good Kolaches. This recipe is simple and very delicious. It is so easy to prepare and comes out so pretty and yummy! I will be making these kolaches again today as my children will be visiting from Austin.

This is one of those recipes I use a lot and have never reviewed.  Do yourself a favor and wrap this dough around your favorite smoked sausage! I do spicy/hot/jalapeño/hot links for grown ups and Little Smokies and Eckrich Smok*y Links for the kiddos.   Fantastic! Keep them in the freezer and zap  for a quick on the go breakfast or snack.

Being a Houston Texas girl, I didn't realize that Kolaches were a regional treat. I thought everyone was able to enjoy this delicious breakfast food until I read these reviews. The Kolaches from this recipe taste just as good as the ones from my favorite Kolache shop. We wrap the dough around lil smokies and sometimes cheese stuffed jalapenos. They're the best breakfast or midnight snack that you'll ever find! I don't have a bread machine so I just make them as I would any other yeast bread..they turn out fantastic!

I too use little smokies along with shredded Monterey Jack or Colby Jack cheese. My co-workers loved this recipe when I brought it in for a breakfast potluck and I plan on using it for tailgating as well as holidays - talk about versatile!

I'd never eated Kolaches before, so I have nothing to compare them with, but they were a keeper.  Tried them with sausage, cheese, and hot peppers, and also apple pie filling.  Was surprised that the same dough was so good both ways.  Use just a bit of confectioner's sugar glaze on the sweet ones.  Will make again.

I do not have a bread machine so made these using frozen bread dough thawed and allowed to rise then punched down.  Rather than links I browned turkey breakfast sausage and used shredded cheddar.  Was an okay breakfast but probably will not make again.  Accidentally gave it 4 stars meant to rate at 3 stars.

These are great for grab and go breakfasts.  I send them with the guys on fly in fishing trips, hunting camps and family camping trips.  When all the family is home for holidays I can make these ahead of time and not have to spend all my time in the kitchen.

This recipe is AMAZING. I added a little extra sugar b/c we like ours a little sweeter. This didn't affect the texture of the dough at all. I also used whole sausages and folded the dough over the sausage rather than pressing the sausage into the middle of the dough as the recipe suggested. Will try w/velveeta cheese next time rather than grated cheese.

I also thought I would never have kolaches again having moved from Houston to Arizona. When I saw this recipe I went out and bought a bread machine. The recipe was easy to follow, the only change I made was wrapping the dough all around the filling, also like other users I omitted the hashbrowns. I made some with sausage and cheese and some with ham and cheese, also I added jalapenos to a few. I will be making these again, just be sure not to use too much dough, I did but they still tasted great.

These are just like the kolaches I've been enjoying for years in Central Texas, minus the hash browns.  The dough is the key ingredient in this recipe, you can add many different things as the filling.  We love smoked sausage and cheese.  Jalepenos are also great with those.  Thanks so much for this recipe, it's fantastic!

This is the best recipe.  The kolaches taste exactly like the ones you buy at the bakery.  Everyone raved about them.  I made them the night before and baked them in the morning.  I am going to make them Christmas Eve and send them home with the kids, so they can pop them in the oven Christmas morning and have hot kolaches.  Thanks Melissa!

Used L'il Beef Smokies and wrapped the dough around as some suggested. Made some with Potatoes O'Brien and some without. All were yummy and very similar to the ones we got in Texas!

Great recipe as is. For those of you who are curious about what kolaches are like, they are sort of a biscuit with a filling inside. The only thing is that the number of dough balls is an overestimate. I usually get 18-20 balls per batch of dough.

I use lil' smokies (the precooked sausage) inside mine. I let them get to room temp before I wrap them up in the balls of dough. Occasionally I will put 1/4 of a square of American Cheese inside. Canned pie filling can be used for a sweet version.

I lived in Houston for some time, and grew to love these delicious meat filled or sweet filled bread.  They were so amazing, and it was a staple at any office party or meeting in the AM.  For so long I looked high and low, no luck.  Saw this recipe and gave it a try - If you are proficient in making bread, no problem.  It is important to understand following directions very carefully, and you should be okay.  Give them a try, they will become a favorite.

Another transplanted Texan looking for traditional kolaches!  

The bread for these is truly perfect.  Just like you get at the donut stores in Houston (Shipley's, anyone?).  I did not modify the dough recipe at all.  However, like most of my fellow Texans, I left out the hashbrowns and used Lil' Smokies and a chunk of Velveeta.  Absolutely perfect.

On the second batch, I also made a few with Johnsonville Cheddar and jalapeno sausage, diced jalapenos, and Velveeta.  They were the hit of our New Year's Eve party. 

Thank you so much for giving me back a huge piece of my Texas roots!

Excellent dough recipe! I didn't use the hash browns, but used pepper jack cheese and sausage from a local smokehouse.  They were a hit with the hubby and kiddo.  Will most certainly make again.

While stationed in South Texas, I fell in love with sausage kolaches and so did my son. We are now stationed in Japan and were craving a taste from Texas. Excellent recipe tastes just like the ones from the local doughnut shop that we miss so much. Thanks

Im giving this recipe 5 stars so it doesnt affect the rating. But my dough didnt turn out...I think. It was very sticky and gooey.  I really want to try these, but I'm not sure if I should use the dough as it is, or start over. I'm sure it's my fault if the dough isnt supposed to be sticky.   The ratings for this recipe are all good ones, so I will trust it. The dough is a bit stickier than pizza dough.

the main problem I had with this recipe seemed to be the baking temperature, as the bottoms of the buns were burned.  I would likely try this again with a lower baking temperature next time.

Thank you Melissa!!!  I just cannot tell you how excited I am to have this recipe.  I am sitting here eating one, and ohhhh it is so good!  I did make a few changes.. I did the dough just like the recipe says - it was perfect.  I didn't have any smokies, so I used ground sausage and shaped it into little smoky shapes and cooked it while the dough was making.  Once my dough was done, I did the ball thing with no problem and instead of waiting 15 min. I went ahead and flattened them and put the sausage on it with a little piece of velveeta.  Then I rolled them up and let them sit the 15 minutes on the greased baking  pan.  Baked to perfection in 10 minutes.   Thank you!!!

Finally, a recipe for kolaches the way I loved having them in Texas!  These are great.  I make two changes - I don't add potatoes (have never heard of that before), and I wrap the dough around the sausage and cheese rather than making the indentation.  Excellent recipe - thanks for posting!

This was a great recipe! I didn't have bread flour so I used all-purpose. I don't know the difference between the two anyways. The kolaches still turned out great. I used different fillings and rolled them up as was shown in the photo even though I know it was meant to put on top. I sauted green peppers, broccoli and chopped tomatoes and put that in with some scrambled eggs and bacon and shredded cheese. I also prepared them and left them on a baking sheet in the fridge overnight to bake in the morning. Worked great! I did have to increase the baking time a little bit though and I brushed them with butter. I also made some for dinner last night but in those I put some sauted roast beef lunch meat with au jus and some cheese in the middle and then baked them. Serve with the Au Jus for dipping as well. YUM!

This recipe takes quite a bit of work, and not worth the effort.  They were a bit bland, and my family did not enjoy them.  Now I have about 20 of these Kolaches that no one will eat.

OH MY GOSH These are so good!! My hubby loves Kolaches and I have been looking at recipes but they all seemed so time
consuming. These were so EASY to make, my husband said if he didn't see me do it he would of swore I spent all day making these :) Thanks for the wonderful recipe. We will be making these again and again!

Great flavor.  My family loved them.  Just make sure you don't make the dough balls too large.  I did and so mine turned out to be more dough than filling.  Next time I'll try basting with melted butter while they bake as another reviewer suggested.  Will definitely make again.

I had kolaches in the airport a few weeks ago.  I'd never heard of them but my dad raved so I bought a few different varieties to try.  They were wonderful!!!  They are really really close to those.  Thank you!!!  The sweetness in the dough is what makes them worth the effort.

These are awesome!  My husband wants these every weekend.  I too tasted my first kolache in Texas and have been looking for this recipe for over 10+years.  I also used the whole sausage and a little more sugar they taste just like I remember.

Had never tries kolache before. I read about them in a book and I wanted to try them right away so I looked for a recipe and yours came up with many good reviews. I had no sausage, but I had some leftover ham that I used. I topped the potato with scallions. Love those rolls. Will wrap them up and freeze them for work lunches later on. Thank you for sharing!

I made these over the weekend they are very much like those from the Houston area of TX.  I did not have a bread machine and followed much of the others instructions.  Used the small smokey links only, no cheese of hashbrowns and had a total of 30.  The next batch will be ham and cheese! Thanks Melissa for submitting this great recipe.

OMG! Yummmy! If your dough is not coming out right, make sure you use the bread flour and at diffterent altitutes adjust your flour. This was one of the easiest recipes and the kids loved it. Thanks!

The bread for these was fantastic!  Just what I was looking for.  I made these into a Texas-style kolache by cookie up some lil' smokies and wrapping the dough around the sausage and a bit of cheddar cheese before baking.  The filling popped out of some of the kolaches, but they were super-tasty.

These were perfect! They taste just like the ones from my favorite kolache shop. The dough is the important part of this recipe- you can fill it with whatever you want.

One note: The portions seemed wrong to me since they were so small. They aren't the dough is moist and rises a lot.

This is the best recipe I have ever tried from this website.  This recipe was so easy to make. Instead of halving the sausages, I made my dough balls slightly bigger and used the whole sausage.  I also did not use the hash browns.  These tasted just as good as the ones I buy at the bakery.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I am from Texas and live in California now.  I have not found any kolaches around here. *gasp*  I made this recipe and they turned out pretty darn good.  I didn't add the hash browns, although I am sure it would have been  a tasty addition.  Thank you for the recipe.

my mom used to make this for me for breakfast when i was younger. now, i'm 16, and i have been looking for this recipe. she used to call it 'bull's eye sandwhich' and would use two pieces of bread sometimes. i think i'm going to make this now, it definitely brings back memories of those days.

This dough is great! However, make sure you peek into your bread machine after all ingredients have been thoroughly mixed (for my 20-year-old machine, that's about 10 minutes after hitting start). If the dough looks runny, add more flour. I usually have to add 1/3 cup of flour. Dough should be thick, forming a loose ball when the machine is spinning it. 

I also did not follow the recipe past the dough cycle; I put in 1 or 2 Little Smokie sausages with as much shredded cheese as I can fit, lift the edges of the dough up and around filling, crimp, and then LIGHTLY roll the stuffed dough into a ball in my (floured) hands. 

Another suggestion: it is totally ok to use a rolling pin with this dough to help you separate it more evenly- no need to roll the dough into balls before filling them; they rise just as well if they're already flattened out.

Finally, I add at least 1 extra rise, right after filling. For all of the rises, I lay the dough on a lined or greased cookie sheet and set in my oven (turned off) and put a pan of boiling water below the racks-- the steam makes them nearly triple in size over 15 minutes! If you live in a dry area, you can also lightly spritz the dough with pam to prevent tops from crusting over, and/or spray a sheet of plastic/foil with pam and lay over dough. Keep the dough covered this way at all possible times when not in the oven!

I've also made fruit and cream cheese kolaches, as well as pepperoni-mozzarella balls, with this dough- delicious!!

Almost perfect.  After the dough came out of the machine, I formed 18 small rolls and let rise for an hour.  Soft pillows of dough...only way to describe them!  After rising I encased a lil smoky sausage into each roll, putting seam-side down on baking sheet before baking.  My taste-testers agreed they need to be a little sweeter, and I'm thinking that next time I'll add more flour so the dough won't be quite so sticky.  It was very hard to work with!

The recipe was too vague, fortunately I have made these before. But if prepared as stated they would be something not nearly resembling kolaches.

I wish I could give it more stars. This is better than any that you can buy. I have made this about a dozen times and they always turn out great. I have stuffed them with pizza filling, sauages, and boudin so far and everyone raves!!!Thanks for the recipe

These were just OK. Maybe it was the sausage that I used but the dough had a wang to it.  They ended up in the trash.

I have never made Kolaches before but this recipe was fun to make and came out yummy. The reviews were also very helpful. I also used different fruit preserves topped with cream cheese glaze to make a variety of tasty treats. I also used ham and bacon which I had precooked as well as the little smokies. I am very pleased with this recipe.

Not quite sure why I didn't like these more. The first few bites were very good but then they started to grow on me in a very bad way. I didn't care for the sliced cheese at all. Perhaps shredded cheddar would compliment the flavors better. I would also recommend cooking the hashbrowns before putting them on the kolaches because mine came out very hard and pretty flavorless. You'll definitely want to cook the sausage first also. The only reason I'm giving this 3 stars is because the bread was excellent. I will probably make again using the adjustments mentioned above.

I used the bread from this recipe to make Pigs in a Blanket and it was so yummy. I also used the bread by itself and made dinner rolls, just brush a little honey butter over the top and you're good to go.

Fantastic!!!  I had never had these before, but seeing all the rave reviews I just had to try them.  They are just WONDERFUL!  I ate 3 of them before the second batch even came out of the oven.  I made half with the sausages and cheese and half with an apple filling and crumble topping. YUM!  Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe is perfect as is and makes kolaches exactly like those sold in Texas bakeries. I double the recipe and divide it into 18 pieces and put a beef hot dog and half a piece of of cheddar cheese in each one.  They freeze and reheat well.  The kids (and adults!) love these for a quick and filling breakfast.

Very easy and very good, although a little salty by nature of the ingredients. Added chopped peppers. Have also made with a sausage gravy and were even better!

I didn't have a bread machine so I made the dough by hand with regular flour and yeast. The basic steps are: heat milk, sugar and yeast until warm, like a baby bottle then let it sit for about 10 minutes until foamy.    Meanwhile melt butter then blend with egg and salt in mixing bowl.   Add yeast mixture and stir.  Then add 2/3 of flour while stirring with a wooden spoon.  Add about half of remaining flour and when it is too hard to stir, start kneading with your  hand while adding flour.   Turn out on counter and knead about five minutes

Very tasty but needs a few tweaks. Adding some garlic powder and oregano to the dough will give a tastier herbiness to the bread (if using meats and cheeses). Flatten the dough out so that plenty of meats and cheeses can be added. Pinching the tops will keep the cheese inside. Make sure to pre-cook all fillings..I added sausage, colby cheese and hashbrowns. Bacon, gouda and hashbrowns and cream cheese and spinach. All were delicious.

I use this recipe frequently!  I stuff with small sausages and velveta cheese, or with deli ham and velveta cheese.  This is a GREAT recipe!
