Right before serving, I sprinkled a little crushed red pepper flake over these. Though my kids didn't care for this, my husband and I loved it. I would have never thought of roasting snap peas but you know, it's brilliant. Delicious! Next time, I'll add in some fresh minced garlic with the EVOO.

Quick & easy to prepare with ingredients you always have on hand. Since it has no exotic ingredients, our picky eaters ate it with no complaints. Good for a busy weekday meal, went well with chicken parmesan and pasta.

My husband and I loved this!! It was so easy. We didn't actually measure out any of the ingredients though. Can't wait to have it again!

Loved the simplicity of this dish. Delicious tasting as well. Even my daughter declared that she loved sugar snap peas now.
