Awesome, our son cleaned these out in no time. I would note that a serving is 1 taco so be sure to increase the servings based on the number of tacos you want.

Tasty recipe to whip up for a quick dinner! I garnished with cilantro but definitely should have added some tomatoes or celery- something to just add to the mix. I used my leftover soft corn tacos rather than hard shell. However I think the hard shell would have added some extra texture. Overall still delicious!

Quick and easy recipe and it tastes very good, spicier is better.
