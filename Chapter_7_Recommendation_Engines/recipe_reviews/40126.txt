this is a very bland recipe, next time do what i did, rinse the nopales (cactus) until the slime is gone. in a pan heat up 2 tbs oil and add 1/4 c. diced onions and cook until it is transparent, then add the cactus, cook for another 5 min. then add 1 tsp cumin powder, and 1 tsp chili powder. in a bowl put in 1 tbs flour and 2 tbs water stir and add to cactus, cook for another 5 min or until a gravy forms. enjoy, oh and don't forget to add salt to taste.

I liked it!! We eat Nopales all the time. I used fresh. I sliced and boiled it with onions and tomatillo skins to cut down on the slime. Nice taco, and great on the grill!!

Good with sour cream on top.  These were a little plain-tasting; I would maybe add diced tomatoes next time.

You really outta amp this recipe up. I rinsed, drained, and dried the nopales, used Mexican style cheese, and sprinkled cayenne pepper, cumin, and onion powder to give it a kick. It left the perfect "hot" taste in my mouth! Amp it up any way you like and it's sure to be a winner - people won't believe they're eating cactus!

I made this into quesadillas like the previous reviewer. They were good but a bit bland - next time I will add some sauteed onion and bell pepper. Oh, make sure you thoroughly rinse the nopales or they will be nasty and slimey.

I didn't have any Adobo seasoning, so I used a generous amount of cayenne pepper on the cactus. I ended up making mini quesadillas so I was able to snack on them while at work. Thanks Mary!
