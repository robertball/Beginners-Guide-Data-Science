These are AWESOME!!!  My husband suggested an easier way to coat them with the powdered sugar: instead of rolling them in it, put the sugar in a ziploc bag and shake. They come out perfect with less mess to clean up!

Like some other readers, I made this last year and did not get around to rating it, probably because I kept having to make more rumballs for everyone who went gaga for these!  They were easy to make,I used a small black and decker food processor for the nuts, blender for the vanilla wafers and Voila!  very easy.  I had so many requests to make more, I ran out of rum, and then started using anything that came to hand - Hazelnuts with Baileys, some with frangelico since I ran out of baileys in the middle of a batch, Kahlua with macadamias, you name it, they all tasted great and got raves.  I just selected nuts that sounded like they would go with whatever was in the mix for that batch, then rolled them in either plain powdered sugar, or powdered sugar with cocoa powder to tell them apart.  Tried sprinkles, and could not get them to stick, however, I HAD had several rum balls by that time:-)so I am going to try again this year!  Definately a crowd pleaser!

Just made these to add to my holiday cookie plate.  They turned out GREAT!  I used a little less than 1/2 a cup of Capt. Morgans spiced rum and they are tasty.  They are fast and easy to make and a real crowd pleaser.  You won't be disappointed.  TIP:  use powdered sugar on your hands to help roll the balls - they roll much quicker this way.

I really should have reviewed this recipe when I started using it 2 yrs. ago. I want to give it 10 stars! I do as other reviewers: powder my hands, refrigerate the "dough," and use spiced rum. I also scale the serving size to 37 (or multiples of 37), so I only have to buy one box of wafers (exactly 2 1/2 cups). For those who don't know, the quickest way to crush the cookies and nuts is in a freezer ziploc with some sort of mallet (or palms of hands). Of course, adjust rum to taste. I still use the 1/2 cup, even when I scale the recipe down!

Though I have not yet tried this recipe (I plan to use it this holiday season) I wanted to pass along my hint for forming the rum balls - I use a melon baller.  It makes all the rum balls the same size and saves sticky hands.
Can't wait to try these !!

Okay, first of all, these are RUM BALLS!  If you don't like rum flavor, then this is not the recipe you should be making!  I make these ALL of the time now, they are a staple every year.  I made them with coconut rum this year and WOW! YUM!  TIP: Use a spoon to drop little wads of rum ball dough onto a sheet of wax paper.  Put about 2/3 cup of powdered sugar into a big ziploc bag and fold the top down so that you can easily drop the balls into it once you've rolled them.  Dust your hands with powdered sugar, sprinkle a little on top of the dough balls, then start rollin'!  NO MESS...well, no STICKY mess, lol.

Delicious and super-easy. For stickiness, try chilling the mixture in the fridge for a little while before rolling them into balls. Using chunkier wafer crumbs helps too- I think these taste better with coarser crumbs because they add flavor and texture (though I've found that the finer the wafer crumbs, the stronger the rum balls...). Lightly toasting the walnuts (about 12 minutes at 325 degrees) before roughly chopping and adding to the mix adds greater depth of flavor--I think it complements the flavor of the rum and tends to temper what some consider the overwhelming alcohol component.  I LOVE these and so does everyone else i know. With some pretty packaging, they make lovely gifts.

Excellent recipe.  I made it four different ways for a big cocktail party I had.  These were the tips I found the most helpful.

(1)  Use a food processor to crush everything.  Very easy.

(2) Chill the mixture for 0.5-1.0 hour to make it easier to form the balls.

(3)  Use a melon baller as suggested to form the balls.  They come out much more uniform and it's REALLY easy.

(4)  Although I followed the original recipe, my favorite variations were (a) to use Oreos and Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum instead (my guests also agreed this was the best); and (b) I used vanilla wafers and a vanilla cognac made by the House of Grand Marnier.  The cognac is called Navan, and it's incredibly smooth going down when you drink it.  My wife, who generally hates hard alcohol will even drink this liquor on the rocks.  Granted, it's not really much of a chocolate taste, but it's truly great, and a wonderful variation.  

(5) Stow the treats in a sealed contained for 4-7 days, and, before serving, put confectioners sugar in either a ziploc or a tupperware container.  Merely roll the balls in the container, and place them on the dish ready to serve.  This coats the balls very easily and effectively.

These are good - It's the first time Ive used walnuts.  Here is a neat tip - I only had Coconut rum...try it, and discover a whole 'nother facet to the traditional rum balls.

Oh my goodness!!  I've had rum balls before, but never quite this good.  I found this recipe at the last minute and found I didn't have any rum.  With the stores all closed, I used Kahlua in 1 recipe and Ameretto in another.  I got rave reviews!  Thanks for my new favorite recipe.

The 1/2 cup of rum/Kaluha made such a difference compared to only 1/4 cup in different recipes.  So moist they were a smash!!  The Kaluha ones were drier even with 1/2 cup though, so add a little water to the dough.

Rum balls are strong, people.  They're supposed to be very rummy.  They are NOT supposed to be a sweet sugary cookie.  If you don't like rum or nuts, don't make them.  I don't know why people make things with major ingredients they don't like and then complain that they don't like the finished product.  I think these are great and I've made them with other types of liquor and nuts.  For those who don't know, you're supposed to use Nilla Wafers (or whatever brand you can find) and crush them really fine, like in a food processor.  You can use a blender to crush them, but don't dump the whole box in - do a handful at a time.  This takes longer, but you need to give the blender blades room to work.

With a 1/2 cup Spiced Captain, these still pack a punch 4 days later.  In my second batch I made some modifications (who on here doesn't tweak recipes?)

1/4 rum, 1/4 Kahlua, 3/4 - 5/8 pkg Chocolate Cream Oreo's (eyeballed it), 1 cup finely ground (food processor) Hazelnuts, 1/2 cup finely ground dark chocolate, and a tbsp of freshly ground dark roast coffee beans.  Absolutely to die for.  I rolled these babies in a mixture of ground chocolate and cocoa.

I have been making this recipe for more than thirty years. A number of years ago I changed from vanilla wafers to chocolate graham crackers. This very well suits the Captain Morgan Spiced rum that I use as the liquor. They are very strong the first day, but mellow out as the flavors blend together over a period of time.It's also important to to remember to re- "roll" in the confectionary sugar again, before serving. Once you make these your friends will be asking for them every year at holiday time!

This was the worst thing I have ever made, and this is the only one star bad review I have ever written. I was leary when I saw the vanilla wafers as an ingredient because I don't like using processed foods, but they got such great reviews and I wanted an easy chocolatey-rummy ball for the Christmas party.  I like the taste of rum, but these came out tasting like rum flavored dough.  Not sure what the problem was because all those positive reviewers can't be wrong.

This is a very good rum ball recipe. Instead of using vanilla wafers, I used Oreos which I finely "crushed" in my food processor. The Oreos really added to the chocolate flavor and dilluted the intensity of the rum. Also, I used "Rum Cream" which is a milky-looking rum that is not too strong. To make sure the corn syrup comes out of your measuring spoon easily, spray the spoon with cooking spray - the corn syrup will slide right off!

I thought these were wonderful and my family loved them! This was my first try at making rum balls and I found them really pretty easy. I noticed another reviewer did not like the bits of cookie in the dough so I used my blender for crushing the cookies. The dough is a little sticky. I used a cookie scoop and kept the dough chilled and didn't have much issue with the stickiness. This recipe does have a strong rum flavor so cut back a bit if you're not a big fan, but that's what I loved about it!  The only reason I didn't give this recipe a 5 is that I do wish they were more chocolatey.  The next time I'll try using chocolate wafers.

I grew up with this recipe and love it! It is perfect and the balls are easy to roll if put in the fridge for a bit.
Also, one 11 oz pkg of Nilla wafers is very close to one recipe...we doubled it and used two boxes. No measuring needed going forward.

These rumballs came out somewhat dry for me.  I waited the fabled 3 days for them to mature and was unimpressed with the outcome.  I tried something completely different which yielded incredible results.  I baked 2 boxes of brownies, broke them up into pieces, put them in the stand mixer and beat them along with 2 cups of crushed walnuts.  I added 1/2 a cup of rum and refrigerated them.  I allowed them to dry out a bit in the refrigerator and then rolled them into balls and then in powdered sugar.  Unbelievably good and satisfying.  Fudgy texture.  Delicious.

These are INCREDIBLE!  This year I realized too late I was out of cocoa, so I used sugar-free chocolate pudding mix powder in the recipe and to roll them in.  I think it makes them even richer.  I also dipped them in chocolate candy coating, and added a white chocolate swirl on top after they dried.  I presented them in the little mini muffin/candy paper cups, and everyone LOVES them!  I've had so many recipe requests I just typed it out and forwarded an email to everyone.  Thanks so much for sharing this!

Very popular at my annual holiday party.. The recipe recommends that they are best after keeping them in a sealed container.  I would agree - while you can serve them the same day - they tend to be best after a week.

Gave these as presents.  A crowd pleaser!!!  We also made a batch with Kahlua and substituted pecans. We then rolled them in a mixture of baking cocoa and powdered sugar.  So good that I wanted to keep them for myself.  Thank you for a great recipe.

My Mom used to make rum balls that were so strong it would bring tears to your eyes. I was looking for something a little more main stream and these, moist, delicious, chocolate-y rum balls are the ones!!! I read a lot of the reviews and picked up some excellent tips. Change the yield to 37 and one crushed box of vanilla wafers gives you exactly the amount called for. I still used the 1/2 cup of rum too! I used Captain Morgan Spiced for a really delicious flavor that even my daughter, who doesn't drink liked. The melon baller made it easy and less messy, just coat it with powdered sugar between balls to keep from sticking. This is a great recipe and I highly recommend it! Thanks, Farmlife!!

Yum.  Yum.  Yum.  These are super easy and delicious.  Definitely a holiday tradition from now on!  I've made with mixed spirits instead of just rum and I love them both ways.  Yum.

I have just three words about this recipe: Yum. Yum. (hiccup) Yum. I made four batches over the holidays -- gave as gifts, brought to parties, etc. Nothing but compliments!

So easy and taste wonderful! I used a melon baller as suggested and they all came out so perfect.  I dipped the melon baller in the powdered sugar after every three or four scoops.  Also, after I hand rolled the scoops to perfection I put them in a bag of powdered sugar.  Thanks to these great tips they were super easy to make.

This is the same recipe I have used for years. I crush the vanilla wafers and nuts together in the food processor for a smoother mix. I have substituted Kahlua, Crown Royal and Brandy for the rum, each with very good end results. I will be sending some to my son who is stationed in So. Korea this Christmas!

These Rum balls were very good. Although i do have to say 1/2 a cup of rum was wayy more than what is needed. I would only use maybe 3/4 of a cup. This is a perfect recipe for the holidays, i made these the night before our christmas staff party and placed them into red foiled cups. Perfect for the desert tray!

OMG! Awesome! Made a few substitutions to what I had on hand.  I used 1 box of Nilla vanilla wafers...not enough (2 and 1/2 cups) so I used already prepared graham cracker crumbs for the remainder.  Didn't have any walnuts so I used pecans and chopped in food processor until uniform in size-perfect!  The mixture seemed dry so I added a dash more of corn syrup and tad bit of water til it looked moist enough for me.  Refrigerated for a couple hours and then rolled half in chocolate sprinkles and half in the powdered sugar.  I had 30 that made it to the container between me and my husband tee hee.  Will be making quite a bit of these.

I have been making this recipe for two years now as Christmas gifts for my family.  They all love them and got upset one year when I dared to buy presents!  I use this recipe to make both rum and whiskey balls.  Sometimes I omit the nuts for certain picky gift recievers.  I made it with ammaretto one year but it was  rather bland--stick with the stronger liquors.

I had never before had nor made rum balls but I had a request.  This was my first attempt and they are delicious and oh so easy. Resting a few days makes a difference too. I used spiced rum as suggested by other reviewers. I will gladly pass these on.

I made  these last year for Christmas gifts. They also freeze well since I had to mail some. Used extra rum and everybody loved them. Made about 200 of them. So I am going to start making them and freeze for Christmas.

You definetly need to let these sit for a few days. They are very strong the first 2 days. I felt they were a little dry also. This was a good recipe for rum balls and they are very easy/fast to put together.. but I don't think i will bother to make them again...if I did i would lower the rum just a bit.

Yum!!! You can really taste the rum without it overpowering the other flavors, and I like the texture the walnuts add. I will definitely make these again!

Delicious and easy to make! I put in about 6 drops of almond extract because I like the flavor but not the consistency and they taste AMAZING!!! I'm glad I bought the larger bottle of rum because now I can make more rum balls!

These were pretty tasty, even though i substituted cheap vanilla extract for the rum (i'm not a fan of alcohol).  Freezing these for an hour or two definately firmed them up, making it easier to roll.  I used a small cookie scoop and dropped them straight into the powdered sugar.

Delicious!  I used pecans instead of walnuts because I prefer the taste.  Like another reviewer said, you can really use whatever alcohol/nuts you like - I did half the mix with Kahlua, and half with Malibu and they were both amazing!

My advice would be to start with the dry mixture, add the corn syrup & alcohol, and then add more until it's wet enough to hold together & you like the flavour.  It's not a fussy recipe at all!  I chilled mine to make it easier to form the balls - they were too wet at room temp.  

Decadent!  Thanks so much - this was a great last-minute recipe for when I had no cream and couldn't use the oven due to the turkey & roast potatoes taking up all the space.

Absolutely yummy! Many reviewers have said this before, but it can't be repeated enough... LET THEM MATURE for at least 2-3 days before eating. I took them to a party yesterday and they were a sensation.

Delicious! Instead of vanilla wafers (not vegan) I used chocolate graham crackers and still added the cocoa powder so they were super chocolatey, but super delicious! You can taste the rum, but I also used really cheap rum, better rum may be better. Definitely let them sit for a week or so and the flavor is much better!

These are packed with flavor!  Good alone, but I liked the ones I "finished off" better: I wanted to make them more presentable for company so I took half of my batch, coated them in melted chocolate, rolled them through a mixture of chopped pecans and chopped walnuts, then drizzled some dark chocolate over top to finish them off.

I used spiced rum instead and found it gave a better flavor.  Instead of powdered sugar on my hands, I used plastic gloves-like the ones you get in your hair color boxes(unused on my hair of course!) Who wants chocolate stuck under thier fingernails.  This is the easiest recipe I've ever used!  Kudos to the original chef!

I made these using homemade vanilla wafers from this site. I decided to try a good brandy instead of rum.  The longer these mature the better they get. At first the alcohol is really strong, but after a while it begins to mellow out. It takes more than just a couple of days.  These are very nice when mature.  I had to roll them in powdered sugar twice.  The first time, after a day or so, it had absorbed into the candy, which actually made it taste even better. I think I will try the recipe sometime using rum, and maybe even try it using a good bourbon.

These were really good. I used Sailor Jerry's and they came out a bit strong. I will have to try the Captain next time.

This is a simple and quick recipe to put together. If you keep the ingredients cool, they mixture doesn't stick to your hands when you roll it into balls. Very tasty!

These were great.  Rolling really gets tiring so be prepared for the work.  I almost completely followed the recipe except that I added a little more cocoa.  I like the stronger chocolate flavor with rum balls.  Highly recommended!

Ok.. I made these today.. and tasted them too! lol VERY EASY to make.. you CAN NOT MESS UP! the box of wafers only makes 2 1/2 cups crushed so I scaled the recipe to 37 balls.. on the servings.. it depends on how big of a ball you do is how many you will get out of a batch.. I used a melon ball scoup it was perfect.. pop one in your mouth! :)  I think I am going to make these with 1/2 raisins and 1/2 walnuts for a different taste for the raisin lovers! GREAT RECIPE! for those that said it was sticky etc.. .you must measure perfectly!

They were a hit at my wife's office!  I had to bump the liquid up a bit due to how dry the dough was - it wouldn't roll it into a ball easily.

I tweaked these a bit, but they won me second place in our dessert contest at work.  I added a handful of mini chocolate chips, used Amaretto and pecans (instead of rum and walnuts), and 1 extra T of corn syrup due to a friend's suggestion.  These were to die for.  They really do get better with age, so if you can, let them sit for a couple of days.  They were good the day of, but delicious the next day, and didn't make it to the third...I brought home an empty box.

The essential recipe. It only takes a few minutes and seems like you've gone to a lot of trouble.
Variations I've used: 
*Coconut-flavored rum instead of regular
*Simple syrup when out of corn syrup (a sugar and water reduction --works perfectly)
*Cocoa powder on the outside instead of confectioner's sugar adds a more bittersweet taste and looks more chocolate-y.

I made two batches - one covered in chocolate and one in powdered sugar (one coat, not two).  (I made one batch and then couldn't stop eating them so made another.)  About half of both batches went during my holiday party, so I think people liked both, but the chocolate-covered ones created more fanatics.  I keep switching back and forth on which is my favorite.  In terms of making it - I used pecans instead of walnuts because I find walnuts sometimes taste "bad" to me - i.e. as if they have turned.  I pounded chopped pecans with a mallet instead of using ground nuts, so they were still a little uneven in texture. I think that gave the rum balls a nice texture - with little bits of nut in them instead of being completely smooth.  Possibly for that reason I never got the "doughy" texture that people mention in their reviews.  I will definitely be making these again.

I've made these for years!! I usually make them with Bourbon instead of Rum.  It's funny to see the people who gravitate to these balls out of all of the other treats I make for Christmas.  I also sometimes roll them in crushed nuts or crushed candy cane!  Make sure to save some Rum for yourself while you are rolling out the shape. :-)

DELICIOUS!  I used the reduced-fat wafers (didn't notice a difference at all) and almonds.  I didn't realize they have to be stored for a few days, so my rum balls had quite a bit of a kick that night!  However, everyone raved about them.

I really wanted this recipe to be as great as the other reviews said it was.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I used Nilla wafers, crushed by a rolling pin, Hershey's cocoa and Appleton rum.  The taste is very good.  Not too rummy.  But the texture is like eating a blob of cookie dough. 

Edit: I got some very positive feedback on the rum balls after the Christmas party.  At that time they were 24 hours old.  One person asked for the recipe.  For that reason I'm giving this recipe 4 stars instead of 3.  I still like rum cake better.

I love this recipe.  I've made it two years now.  THis time I crushed the crackers in a ziplock and then added all  the remaining ingredients in the same bag and mixed it that way.  After letting it sit for 30 minutes I formed them into balls and rolled them in powdered sugar -- it's  sticky process but well worth it.  They just get better with time.

These were very tasty, although I thought the rum flavor was a bit too strong. I tried using Irish Cream instead, and those had better flavor, in my opinion. But the best results came out when I dipped rum balls in melted candy melts. Those were to die for!!! Having the hard chocolate shell around them really preserved the moistness, while the ones coated in powdered sugar got a bit dry two days leater.

These are very easy to make and a great holiday gift. They taste great and the rum flavor is offset by the other ingredients so it's not overly stong.  However, since they don't taste really alcoholic it's hard not to keep "testing" them. If you keep noshing, you will get tipsy :-)

YUM!! I've always wanted to learn how to make rum balls. My favourite are ones with mixed fruit as well because it adds flavour and interest in that dark, chocolaty heaven. The sultanas in the mixed fruit soak up the coconut rum that I used. Plus the huge splash of bourbon. I'm used to rum balls being rolled is dessicated coconut. So for the 1 1/2 cups for chopped nuts, I substituted half chopped nuts and half mixed fruits so the measurements were still the same. Had no corn syrup and used honey instead. I've never had rum balls rolled in icing sugar or cocoa, so try it in the dessicated coconut, you won't be disappointed!! Thanks Donna!

Delicious! I made mine with just plain old Bacardi, but they turned out great! I'm "fermenting" them in the fridge now for a dinner party tomorrow night (although who says the chef can't sneak one two early?), I rolled them in sugar to start, but I'm gonna roll them in chocolate sprinkles before the party tomorrow. Thanks for the recipe!

I haven't made the recipe yet but I don't know what kind of wafers to use.  Are they the kind that are rectangular and have the vanilla icing in the middle.  Or are they the round crunchy cookie kind?

Very good! I did a little experimenting and found that using Kahlua instead of rum works very well (it's strong, though, watch out!). Also, you can try crushed gingersnaps instead of vanilla wafers-- it takes a little more work since they're crunchier, but the spicy-sweet flavor is fantastic!

A little difficult to get the hang of making the actual balls, but I found if you chilled the dough and then rolled the balls in powered sugar mixed with cocoa powder they turned out great.

Excellent as is. I've made substitutions just to mix things up a bit. Try adding chopped raisins soaked in rum overnight or chopped maraschino cherries in place of some of the walnuts.

I made  these two different ways. 1st, way, I used vanilla creme wafers., Captain Morgans parrot Bay Rum, and rolled in coconut when finished baking.  YUMMMM,
2 nd batch, i used Captain Morgans Spiced Rum,  and Oreo cookies.  fantastic! Finished 
Neither of my cookies came out dry.
The next day, I just had to make some more... I used  Bacardi gold rum and Oreos.  I did add a little extra rum to this batch. They too are excellent.  Both batches made with Oreos were rolled in a mix of unsweetened cocoa and confectionary sugar mix.

Made these cookies according to the directions and they came out amazing!!  They definitely need 2 days to sit and let the rum mellow.  I tried 1 right after making them and the rum was overpowering.  The second day they were better and the third day even better!  If you do not have 2 days to wait for the rum flavor to mellow out, try using Kahlua instead.  The Kahlua adds sweetness and doesn't leave the overpowering rum flavor.  For anyone who likes a bit more booze in their food, try a dark rum.  I also made a batch using Bacardi Ron 8 Anos.  The rum was a little strong for the first 2 days, but on the 3rd day I liked these the best!

Meh. I just don't get the appeal. They came out kind of boring. Pretty much like you'd expect lousy boxed cookies soaked in booze and mixed with nuts to taste. A little flat, the flavor needed something besides sweet to give it some appeal.

I feel bad giving it only 2 stars, but no one ate them on Christmas.  My brother brought some he made and they were quite good compared to these.  I made them exactly as the recipe states, and they came out strong, crumbly firm, and not very sweet or chocolatey.  Maybe I am just not a big fan of rum balls in general, but these didn't go over well at my house.

I have been making these for years, and my mom used to make these as well.  Don't change a thing with this recipe.  It is a crowd pleaser!  There is such a small amount of rum in it (mostly just to flavor it - as vanilla does) I even give a few to my kids.  :)  Excellent recipe.

These were a big hit with my family and coworkers.  Loved how on the first day when you eat one you feel like you've just taken a shot!  Still get the warm feeling 5 days later!  Will definitely make again!

YUM! These were perfect....made them exactly as written! Used Sailor Jerry spiced rum, which is 92 proof, so I used just under half a cup.... these mellow after a day or two and the flavors go really well together. My family really enjoyed these. We couldn't resist popping one in our mouth each time we passed through the kitchen!

These are ok, but I used brownies instead of cookies and a few crushed up graham crackers in my first batch and they turned out much better.  I also found that I needed to add more bourbon (especially since I just used a whole box of nilla wafers and didn't measure)  however, the taste is just not as good as the brownie version I made.  I recommend using more bourbon than called for anyway.  They just turn out better.  Also, mixing cocoa powder into the powdered sugar is awesome too when you roll them in it!  I also don't put nuts in mine b/c I'm allergic.  So, I add crushed graham cracker to substitute.

These turned out great! I actually used less Rum and it was actually pretty weak, so therefore the called for amount would have been perfect! They still taste great and remind me of my mother's recipe. Good job!

I was so excited about these, but the end product is soooo strong.  Don't get me wrong, I like alcohol, but these were a bit overpowering.  Maybe using coconut rum or another flavored liquor would be better?  I plan on dipping them in chocolate in the hopes of balancing out the flavor.

I love these. The only rum I had around was Sailor Jerry's 92 proof spiced rum. The bite was a little bit much, so I tossed in a few tablespoons of shredded, sweetened, coconunt. Perfection!! The coconut fibers left in your mouth deliciously mellow the boozy taste that lingers after the rest of the rum ball is gone. Can't believe I've never made these before...

These rum balls are amazing! One thing I did different was that I used vanilla creme wafers. The creme makes them a little more sweet and hides the rum taste a bit. Also makes it hold together better.

Well, my folks loved these as well as my friend that I gave some to.  Yes, you have to love rum, especial after a few days or so, since the flavor does get stronger.  I used a Raspberry flavored rum.  I also used someone else's ideas about coating my hands with some powder sugar so the balls wouldn't stick to my hands, and putting the powered sugar in a ziplock bag and placing the rum balls in that to coated them, made it really easy.

My husband thinks these are out of this world, lol!  I made them exactly as written, never made rum balls before and my husband has claimed the whole batch.  They are strong, I've only had a couple and though they are not my favorite holiday treat, they are #1 for my husband.  5 stars indeed!  :)

I have not been able to bring anything else to a party since I started making these! SO delicious, easy to make, and cute too  :) I did try the Kahlua variation for people who don't like rum and they were also a hit. Thanks so much for a new favorite recipe!

Amazing with many compliments!  1/2 c rum was the max I'd use (they had some real kick!).  They'd taste great with a little less too.

This was my first attempt at rum balls.  These are easy, versatile and turned out GREAT!  Rolled some in coconut, almonds, pecans, walnuts, cocoa, and even stuffed cherries inside a few.  Can't wait to make more and try new combinations.

These tasted just like I remembered. Don't forget to let them "marinate" in a closed container or ziploc and dust again with powdered sugar before serving. If you use the ziploc bag method of "rolling" them in powdered sugar, you only have to use one ziploc for everything - initial powdered sugar coating, "marinating", then the final powdered sugar coating before serving. A real time and dish-saver!

I made these for a wedding and got RAVE reviews.  The regular rum worked fine and if you refrigerate the dough for an hour it is pretty easy to work with.  I made my mine a petite size so they could be eaten in one bite.  Somehow that makes the texture seem more palatable. This recipe is one I will use frequently.

I love these, and am excited to try them again with Irish Cream. I've made them a couple times with rum and they're always a hit, plus they're super-easy to make. I mix everything in the food processor.

Note: the amount of crushed cookies is equivalent to a full box. You can crush them using a food processor. You can also substitute bourbon for the rum. I was initially skeptical of how they would come together, but overall they went together beautifully.

I personally never tried any of these, but my sister in law raved at our family gathering.  I left them in the fridge for two weeks in a tightly sealed container.  When I opened the lid the smell of rum filled the kitchen!  My mother in law wouldn't try one because she was scared she'd be drunk after, regardless of my assurances that there wasn't that much rum in them.  Bottom Line:  Suppostedly really good - Very Rum Smelling.

I crushed the cookies in a freezer bag, added the remaining ingrediants to it and massaged the freezer bag until all the ingrediants were distributed. I was a little alarmed when it appeared crumbley, but I left it sealed in the bag overnight and the next morning.. WOW! These are strong and delicious! I dipped all the rum balls in melted chocolate which really sealed in the moisture and improved the flavor! This recipes is a keeper!  ^_^

WOW! This was my first attempt at making rum balls and I searched all my recipe books and the net for an easy recipe that rendered good results.  I really hit the jackpot with this recipe. They were so incredibly easy to make. (I didn't have any trouble with them being too sticky) and omigosh are they YUMMY!  After making the first batch I made another using graham cracker crumbs and Bailey's. I substituted the cocoa with confectioner's sugar and instead of walnuts, added special dark chips with macadamia nuts with awesome results.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great recipe that is sure to get rave reviews from any and all that try it. I use different types of rum (vanilla, coconut- whatever!), and always get requests for the recipe.

This recipe is great, excellent flavor! I am suppose to be letting them rest for a week but I find myself sneaking a few out of the container each day. The only thing thatI changed was I used coconut instead of nuts. It was delicious! I got the idea from one of the other reviewers to put powdered sugar on my hands to make them easier to roll and had no problems. I saw that one person had problems with the wafers, I put them in a heavy duty ziploc bag and rolled them with a rolling pin which took no time. I have made 2 batches and am sure that I will be making more before the holiday season is over!!!

Just made this recipe and it turned out fabulous.  I used a small cookie scoop and got 45 rum balls out of the recipe (remember to use gloves as the mixture can be quite messy).  Then, after rolling the balls in the powdered sugar I placed them in mini paper cups giving them an even prettier appearance.  Wonderful recipe!

Instead of rum, I used 1/2 cup water (less a tablespoon) plus TWO tablespoons rum extract.  Turned out pretty yummy!  Thanks!

All I can say is YUM. I haven't even finished rolling the full batch yet...but I HAD to test one (or three) out and they are divine! Can't wait to give these as gifts :)
Oh, thanks for the tip about scaling down to 37!

I remember making these with my dad when I was a kid. I loved the idea that they had liquor in them. Yummmm. These are the best. Just be sure no one (hubby) decides to "kick it up a notch" with extra rum when your not looking, expecially if you already did! :) (add more cookies if he does!)

These were wicked, in a good way.  My first time making rum balls and it was a great success.  If you have not made them before, don't be discouraged by what a sticky, gooey mess the dough is.  Just powder your hands and start rolling.  Excellent recipe, thank you.

A big success for our New Years Eve party.  Used the spice rum as suggested and they turned out awesome. My husband keeps asking when I will make more.  Thanks for the tips on the gloves and ziplock bag.  Made it almost too easy.

Wow!!  Easy to make and the taste is good if you are a big fan of rum...it doesn't really hit you until the second bite, which can knock you off your feet!  I enjoyed them, as did my family, but couldn't eat too many!

The balls were kind of difficult to roll, but they tasted excellent.  Next time I will try to coat them in chocolate sprinkles before I refrigerate them.

The best rum ball recipe I've tried yet!  A little too much rum for my husband's taste, but my friend ate 10 of them in a row and was completely happy :) with the results!  Will be making every year to add to the Christmas platter!

These were great! I didn't have enough of the vanilla wafer cookies so I used some graham cracker crumbs in place of those. I chopped the walnuts in my handy chopper until they were almost ground because I didn't want the big chunks. I will make them again and maybe roll some in cocoa powder or chocolate sprinkles.

On my 2nd batch, instead of rolling (and re-rolling in a few days) them in plain confectioner sugar, I mixed in a little of the unsweetened cocoa powder with the sugar. They are really good and strong, but not for kids! Used my "Handy Chopper" appliance to crush the cookies into powder, and it was so easy to make!

This was a super easy recipe and very delicious. I'd let the mixture sit for five minutes before forming into balls. It's too sticky if you do it right away. They are our new Xmas tradition... just keep them away from the kids!

I've made several batches of these every Christmas for about 13 years because my friends and relatives won't let me stop! They are a tradition and favorite. A few things I've learned through the years: I use my food processor for the wafers and the walnuts creating almost a powder. This helps them roll better and the flavor is smoother. The best rum to use is Black Strap Rum as it has dark molasses undertones. Finally I add a little more corn syrup to create the right consistency for rolling the balls with no messy hands. I roll them and place on wax paper then when done, add groups to a bag of confectioners sugar (much easier and less messy than rolling in the sugar). I place them in an air tight container for several days and sometimes a couple of  weeks. The flavor gets better and smoother. My mother used to make her fruit cake three weeks before Christmas and know I understand why.

I hate to review something I altered but.. here goes. I used my food processor to grind the Nilla Wafers ( 2 cups), I used pecans and ground those also ( 2 cups), added 2 cups confectioner's sugar and 4 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder... then added 1 t. Vietnamese cinnamon, 1/2 t. Nutmeg and 1/4 t. ground cloves.. stir well in large bowl with a whisk.  In measuring cup I poured 1/2 c. SPICED RUM and 4 t. Light Karo.. stir until well blended and then pour over cookie mix. stir till all is dampened and let it sit for about 10 minutes to soak it up. form into 1" balls, roll in conf. sugar and store in refrigerator. these are the bomb! and super easy.. no baking!

I would go with a gold or dark rum, just to intensify the flavor. I don't think I'd go with aged or pricey rums, though, because I don't think they would stand out among the other flavors, namely the sweetness. I think I used Appleton Estates the last time I made them.  ALSO you could go with a dark rum. Like Goslings Black Seal to make rum balls (and other desserts) because the flavor is stronger than the light or gold rums, and adds a nice caramel note as well.

Um, wow!   These babies are potent.  Make sure you give people a warning not to let the kids get near them, but otherwise they make a great addition to a candy box.  They make a lot too.

Fabulous! Made them exactly as written except used chopped Pecans (all I had). I used a rum called Largo Bay, Barbados Rum (was recommended by saleslady in store). The cookies turned out soft and chocolatey with a very mild rum flavor. I think this must be a mild tasting rum. I used a full 1/2 cup yet neither my husband nor son knew it was a rum ball. I like that as some rum balls taste too strong. The taste of chocolate was more pronounced. Very good, I'm making three more batches to use up the rum. Great recipe!

Other than personal taste, these were very very easy to make and were a hit with others.  I mixed them up without any problem.  I did use a melon ball scoop to keep the size consistent.  Personally, I liked everything but the rum.  I guess I am not a rum fan.  My husband and son liked them very well.

(Quick note: I believe everyone tweaking and then sharing enhances this website far beyond just rating the original recipe. I appreciate the "made exactly as directed- turned out ____", but crave the notations of changes/substitutes so I can learn from other's expertise/mistakes. All of my 1st attempts turn out perfect for me and my family as a result!) I used 1 box Nilla Wafers, and changed the recipe to 37 servings to adjust for only having 2 1/2c of wafers. I followed dry ingredients exactly, except 2c walnuts. I used 1/4 cup amaretto and 1/4 cup Bacardi silver. I did not have corn syrup, so made some super-thick simple syrup with 1/4 cup water and 1 cup granulated sugar. (Microwaved the water for 45 secs, stirred in sugar 1/4c at a time, nuked for 30 secs, stirred, nuked again, stirred. This crystalizes as it cools so I don't think I would recommend this substitute.) I added it as the 2 T + 1 tsp and stirerd it all together. The result seemed very dry and crumbly (and kind of smelled like a diaper?!) and I panicked that it wouldn't form balls. Not only did I get 52 rum balls, but they were not sticky AT ALL, and I used my cookie scoop to measure how much to smush each time. Halfway through, I started to panick again (as I noticed sugar crystals on my cookies), thinking as they sit, they might dry out and crumble apart. Fingers crossed!! (Oh, and as to the booziness: they have a nice kick freshly made!)

I doubled this recipe and added another 1/2 c. of Capt. Morgan's spiced rum with an additional tablespoon of the light corn syrup...delicious with a glass of milk to warm you up on those cold nights.  I like this recipe better than melting the semisweet chips.  Also using gloves helped when forming into balls because the rum burns!

Have to admit I was expecting something FANTASTIC, based on all the reviews and was sorely let down. These are good - don't get me wrong - but they didn't keep anyone coming back for more.  =( Based on the reviews - I made a tripple batch to add to our holiday cookie exchange as well as to put out while hosting guests.  After the holidays, nearly all that I did not give away in baskets, were still left. Nobody was eating them.  Think I'll skip these next year and look for something else.

These were easy.  And they are called Rum Balls, so that should be the first clue.  I do wish I would have scaled back a little on the rum though.  To offset it, we added more wafers and they still rolled great and some ppl thought they tasted great too.  Others not so much, but I am going to chaulk that up to personal preference, not anything having to do with the the recipe.  The recipe was easy to follow and produced the promised finished product.  Thank you for sharing.  I will make them again next year.

I made these as Christmas gifts and while other people enjoyed them, I didn't...maybe they were just being nice?  These are a more traditional style of rum balls with a good rum taste - not too weak and not too strong for my taste.  However, I was hoping for a more chocolatey/fudgy rum ball which these are NOT.  I really didn't think they had a very strong chocolate taste at all.  Based on previous reviews, I rolled half in confectioners sugar and half in cocoa - the cocoa was a big mistake, very bitter!  If you want a more chocolatey taste I would roll them in truffle chocolate instead of cocoa.  But I will not be making this recipe again.

These were good for my first attempt at rum balls. I used pecans because I had a ton of them in the freezer, and that worked fine. The rum taste was a little strong even after sitting in the fridge for a week, but people liked them, so I would make them again.

I tweaked the recipe a bit by adding a 10-12 oz. jar of maraschino cherries and 1/2 TBSP of pure almond extract. I also used sugar cookies instead of vanilla wafers and the results seemed to work just as well. You could probably use any type of cookie. ex. shortbread, windmill, almonette, coconut, butter tarts, ect.     The almond extract enhances the flavor of the cherries, and the cherries make the rum balls taste more like fruitcake, which in this case, is a good thing especially around the holidays.    I give this recipe 5 stars after the inclusion of the cherries and almond extract because they complement and enhance them so well.    Some people might prefer vanilla or anise extract instead.

This recipe was a bit interesting. We have a international ethnic fair that comes every year and I was comparing this recipe to the ladies who make rum balls and sell them at the folk fair. I followed the advice of others and used spiced rum. I am not a drinker so I would not know that spiced rum is spicy. It made the rum balls kind of hot. I am thinking one of the spices must be pepper?hmmmm...I thought the second day, the balls would start soaking up the flavors and still be juicy. They started getting kind of dry. After doing some internet reading, it is recommended to store them in the refrigerator in a airtight container and bring them to room temperature before serving. I thought these balls would have a consistancy of truffles. They did not. I made these to put on a gift cookie plate. I am going to search for another recipe. I may try this one one more time but use shortbread cookies or graham cracker crumbs and use Bacardi instead of the spicy stuff. I also read the dough should be sticky which tell me this recipe needs more rum (liquid)

I wanted to try a different rum ball recipe than I used to make and these were FANTASTIC!  I used Agave Sugar instead of corn syrup and rolled half of the balls in coconut and the other half in crushed walnuts.  Everyone that has tried them so far says they are the best!

OMG!! These are the first Rum Balls I've tried that are finally perfect! I followed the recipes exactly, used a food processor and a blender to crush the vanilla wafers and nuts very fine and used Sailor Jerry's spiced rum. TIP: buy enough ingredients for two batches because you'll wish you did in the first place! So good - having a hard time waiting for them to mellow. Oh, use your hands at the end to mix the dough well. It was perfect, didn't need to use powdered sugar to roll.

Have been using this recipe for a few years now.  Would not change a thing.  Love the fact that you can actually get drunk from these little devils!  Yes, there is that much rum in them.  I have made them using extract/flavouring before but I prefer the warm burn from real rum.  Going to make them tonight with friends!

I used Frangelico and pecans. I thought the mixture was a little dry, so I basted them with little more Frangelico/Karo syrup mixture. They got more moist as they sat in the container, but they were still missing something. More sugar? More booze? I don't know. Maybe some of the Nilla wafers could be substituted for something else, but I don't know what. These were still pretty good, and the Frangelico didn't make them boozey at all (maybe that was the problem...)

OK, I was honestly apprehensive when I came across this recipe.  I was expecting some sort of truffle like creation by the name, and when I read about the Vanilla Wafers, I was put off.  I could not have been more wrong.  It was easy to make, and after letting them sit, they were an absolute joy!  If I were to change anything, it would be adding more rum, because it was just more of a background note in the balls we made.  Other than that, these will definitely be a staple in my recipes box!  4.5 stars.

Excellent rum balls!!! Loved these. Omitted the walnuts because of family allergies and they were still delicious. I would like to note however that the recipe only made about 24 walnut-sized balls, not the 48 the recipe claims.

Fantastic! I usually make my mom's chocolate ball recipe at Christmas time, but this year, decided to try these instead (basically the same recipe, but my mom's has half-and-half instead of rum). I brought some to my husband's Christmas party and a family event and these just vanished! I didn't even get to try one before they were gone! Everyone RAVED about them!

this was pretty good and very easy.  i did make some substitutions though.  i used coconut rum and added shredded coconut to it.  i threw the vanilla wafers and nuts in a food processor, then added the rest of the ingredients and processed till mixed thoroughly.  i did add more rum as the texture was not quite right.  lots of people liked them and wanted more:)

Maybe my problem was the type of rum I used (bacardi select) but they were a little strong!! Next time I will try vanilla rum, I think it'll be good with the vanilla wafers and cocoa and I will probably only do a 1/4 cup of that!

Great overall. I added extra rum and a little extra crushed cookies and powdered sugar.  The texture was great, but the taste seemed to be missing just a little something.  Next time I may toast the nuts before chopping, or add some nutmeg.  Just seemed a little flat.  Texture was perfect though, I had read some earlier complaints so was wondering if there would be a problem there.  Will definitely make this again.

good just needed a little extra sugar to help roll them out.  Also would probably use just a little less rum.

I did not like this recipe.  I waited a whole week before I ate one and I don't know if it was the rum flavor or the texture or what that I didn't like.  They definitely pack a punch.  I set them out at Christmas and only a few people ate them (I don't think they liked them because they seemed to be warning others against them which was pretty embarassing).

These were amazing - and so easy! The only difficult part was getting the 'Nilla wafers all crushed down without making a mess... I also used low fat wafers and I don't think anyone noticed a diff in taste. I brought these in to work and people were scarfing them down. I do suggest you let them sit for the day or two it says in the recipe - the ones I let sit were decidely creamier than the ones I didn't. Definitely a staple in my holiday baking from now on.

I made this recipe, half of it as directed, and the other half with coconut. I love chocolate and coconut together so I added a little bit into the mixture, and then rolled the ball into some coconut that I chopped in the food processor. Both of them taste great! I used captain morgans spiced rum- the full 1/2 cup and it isn't too strong, especially after a couple days. I will be using this recipe from now on!
(I also added a little salt and granulated sugar to the dough, not too much)

I made these a few weeks ago, and everyone absolutely loved them! They were a bit messy, but that may have been because I used LOTS of powdered sugar! I didn't think the rum was too strong, and I did make them a couple of days before our event. I did use Parrot Bay Coconut Rum, which may have toned down the rum taste a bit. I made half a batch with walnuts and half a batch without. Both were equally delicious, and addicting!

I gave these three stars because I got a compliment from a neighbor, who wants the recipe and my husband ate them.  I didn't care for this recipe, though.  The flavor of rum was very strong and I couldn't taste chocolate at all.

So rummy & yummy!  Followed the recipe exactly ... tasted great right off the bat & improved over time in the frig.  Huge hit at my husband's work party, even though that batch was only about 16 hours old.  I liked them best aged 3 days.  Definitely a keeper!

These rum balls are the best!  They are so easy to make!  Made these a couple of days before our Christmas party and had to make another batch because hubbie couldn't stay away from them!  Just remember to let them sit for a couple of days to let the full flavor come out.

Last year I made these with regular Bacardi.  This year I made them with Malibu rum.  I like them much better with Malibu..  Now I want to make them with a raspbery or vanilla flavored rum..  I don't see how you could screw this recipe up!  Everyone just raves over them!

This is my father's favorite cookie I make for Christmas and also mine.  They make a wonderful gift.  Make sure to give them at least one day for the flavor to develop.  I prefer use only 1/4 rum.  Also to make a pretty variation, I mix a little cocoa powder in with the sugar before I roll the balls.  They look like elegant truffles.

Maybe I just don't like rum balls, but these were not good.  I brought some to work, and nobody really care for them there either.  It was a real pain trying to crush the cookies.  A blender does not work well!  They get packed into the bottom and the cookies on top do not get crushed.  I tried a ziploc bag, but my bag was not strong enough to stand pounding.  They did seem to taste stronger the next day.  I really wanted to like these, so I kept trying them for a couple of days,but they never improved.

This has become a traditional christmas recipe.  I have people requesting these.  I made a ton of them for a party I catered last week, and they were a hit.  Always better the 3rd or 4th day!

These are absolutely fantastic!  My husband requested rum balls "like my mom's", and he actually said that these were better!  I used pecans instead of walnuts and spiced rum.  I originally made these for gifts, but now I have to make another batch because we have eaten most of them.  Thanks so much to Donna for a great recipe.

This recipe was so good that I had many people asking for it.  A nice variation that I also added to a batch was adding about 1/4 cup amaretto into them besides the rum.  Another big hit with my friends and family

I have been making this recipe for the past 3 years, and people LOVE IT! Every year they look forward to "my" rumballs. (I use more than the 1/2 cup of Capt. Morgan and it really gives it a kick!) You will want to leave it "ferment" in the fridge for about 2 or more days. The older they are the better they get. This is the BEST rum ball recipe I have ever used. A big THANK YOU to the original chef!

There were very easy to make and very good, strong rum flavor.  I used vanilla rum and they were yummy and a big hit at my cookie exchange.  They were not sticky at all but I put powdered sugar on my hands before rolling them.  I just wish they were a little sweeter.

Very sticky and hard to roll into balls - I kept having to spray my hands with non-stick cooking spray to prevent the dough from sticking to my hands.  Also, only good if you like a really strong rum flavor, because the rum is overpowering.

They were a hit, but only among adults.  I think they would be better if less rum was in the recipe, because the taste is a bit too strong.  It was also a hassle trying to roll them into balls because the mixture was sticky and crumbly.

I had never made rum balls before. This was so easy and quick.  Even though I left them in a covered container for a few days they still turned out great.  Everyone at work loved them and they were gone very quickly.  I will use this recipe often.  Thanks

Best rum balls I ever made.  At first it was messy but then I started dusting my hands with confectioners sugar before making the rum balls and it worked out great.  I have been asked repeatedly to make more for co-workers.

Don't make them "today" if you need them "tomorrow". Made them on Christmas Eve. Of course you have to try what you make...which I did. And I was thinking these are okay. Put them in the frig and let them sit; the longer the better.
Let them sit overnight. Just in that time it made a huge difference in taste!
All I can say is WOW! These taste just like the one's my Nana made.

Delicious and extremely versatile recipe. I've used both vanilla wafers and if I didn't have any on hand, I've also used shortbread cookies. Try mixing some up with either coconut rum or spiced rum and add some coconut for added texture. I've used almonds, pecans and walnuts. Also used this recipe with high quality bourbon or whiskey for a smoother taste. I use a 1 1/4" cookie scoop for mess free and evenly sized balls. Roll them into balls and freeze on a tray. Once frozen, I put them into a container and put back into the freezer allow to meld for a few days. When ready to serve, remove from freezer, immediately roll or shake into ziplock of powdered sugar but you only need a thin coating, then allow to thaw some before rolling into more powdered sugar or nuts, toasted coconut, sugar, etc. Always a hit and so easy to make with ingredients I have on hand.

These are amazing! If I don't make these every Christmas the (adult) kids will complain! I crush the vanilla wafers and chop the walnuts in the food processor, sometimes I sub honey for the corn syrup. I usually use Captain Morgan's spiced rum but this year I'm going to try black strap rum. I usually have to dust these in the powdered sugar for a second coating prior to packing in Christmas boxes. Be sure and let these sit for several days or the rum will be too sharp. They need time to mellow. Christmas tradition!

Very rummy and rich flavour. Easy enough to prepare. I think the ratios are slightly off if you include all the nuts. The mixture becomes too dry. Also, as other reviewers said the sprinkles and sugar would not stick to the outside of the rolled balls. Nice flavour but next time I will add more rum or less wafers. Thanks.

UPDATE:  I DID MAKE THESE FOR MY 2019 COOKIE TRAYS.  THEY'RE A BIG HIT AND SO SIMPLE TO MAKE. **** Made these for 2018 Christmas cookie platters.  My gosh, these were good!  Course, I put 2 oz more rum than listed .  Needless to say ... they were a big hit.   Even more potent the next day.  Freeze wonderfully.  Will make again next year.

I made these two ways. One batch was like the posted recipe and the second was with chocolate animal crackers and bourbon. With both batches I added more alcohol. Both were well loved by all. These were made to be part of of my holiday gift bags for family and friends.

Awesome, as usual!  These rum balls have a nice bite to them , and remind me so much of Christmas's past. I like that these ones take cocoa powder instead of melted chocolate chips.

Have made these since college and everyone loves them. I don't always use vanilla wafers but have substituted graham crackers,  ginger cookies,  chocolate wafers. I also have used plain rum, spiced rum,  and bourbon or whisky. It's whatever I have on hand.  Roll them in the confectioners sugar or even a cinnamon sugar mix!  The important part is letting them sit for a few days to a week in the refrigerator to " mellow". I have several old metal cookie tins that I store them in until serving time.

these are amaaaaazing! 3 boxes of wafers makes 100- I use special dark coco, toast the walnuts or hubby ‘s fav is when I use pecans toasted! after you mix let mixture set covered for 3-4 hours/ it is way easier to roll / don’t t stick to your hands ad much. I use a cookie scoop. I sprinkle them with chocolate pixie/ disco dust- edible glitter- do beautiful

We've been making these 'booze balls' for as long as I can remember, and rarely use rum. Whiskey/bourbon is our liquor of choice, but have used various cordials as well (Kaluha, Amaretto, Cointreau, etc) all with tasty results. The longer they sit, the better they taste ... altho our's rarely last more than a couple of days.

Recipe is fine -- needed a little more rum but, if you buy a box of vanilla wafers and buzz them in your food processor, the yield is short 3 1/4 cups -- maybe by an 1/8 of a cup? I substituted some fine bread crumbs.

I have made these many times, but had lost my original recipe from the Bacardi company and needed to refresh my memory. This recipe was just as delicious and just as forgiving, as I had no vanilla wafers but had chocolate graham crackers and used that instead. It tasted wonderful, as always! This is a great fool-proof recipe!

Made these as  the recipe was written the first time,  Second time, I made a GF version using GF animal crackers and substituted Kahlua and Bailey's for the rum and rolled them in a ground instant coffee/dark cocoa/confec sugar combo.  Both ways were great and easy.

I made these as directed (always do, or else I don't write a review).  They were really good, maybe just a slight bit dry though, so next time I will just use 3 C of the cookie crumbs.

Perfect ratios for this classic recipe. Use a food processor to really get your Nilla wafers down to powder and make them 1-2 weeks ahead, not just a few days. It really helps the texture and flavor. Also, I don't see a yield on the recipe, but I use a cookie scoop to portion the dough into 2-teaspoon balls, and get a little over 3 dozen. People will be happy to eat these right out of the container, but if you want them to look perfect on a tray, plan to re-coat them before serving, otherwise they get a bit squished in storage and some of the rum soaks through the sugar. I roll in a mix of cocoa and powdered sugar.

These are great.   Much like the Rum balls my grandmother made.   I always substitute maple syrup or agave for the corn syrup.  Sometimes I make 1/2 the recipe with Rum or something similar and keep the other 1/2 non-alcoholic.   To do so I have used more maple syrup and added some vanilla and even some water to make the dough wet enough.   My kids love them and I feel better about them.  (Even though as a kid I had Rum balls with Rum :) )

I just made these, and I can tell you that they will not make it the recommended several days to allow the flavor to develop. They are too irresistible! Definitely chill the dough before rolling them out, it made it worlds easier to work with.

My Mom used to make regular rum balls for the holidays, but I much prefer these cocoa ones!  When I made these last year I cut down a little on the amount of rum, but you do have to make sure they aren't too dry or the dough won't stay together.  Refrigerate the dough before trying to roll them into balls.  I also made these using Kahlua instead of Rum and they were DIVINE!   So glad I found and tried this variation of the "classic".  Forgot to mention my daughter is allergic to nuts so we just left them out and they turn out absolutely fine without them (even though I prefer them w/the nuts).

Need 10 stars for this recipe!! So quick, easy, and awesome! My dough seemed a little dry, so I added about 2T evaporated milk , and it worked great. I covered with plastic and refrigerated it overnight before rolling into balls. For coating, I used 2 gallon size ziploc bags. One filled with powdered sugar, dropped the balls in as I rolled them. When getting full, I shook the bag, then moved those into the empty bag for storage. Refrigerated for 2 days, then threw in more powdered sugar and shook it again before serving. This made them resemble fluffy little snowballs. Everyone loved these, and they're already begging me to make more. Thanks!!

My mother and I have been making this recipe for the last 4 years! EXCELLENT! Letting them sit a few days is a great idea! Not only do they become more flavorful, it allows time for them to "dry out" so they're not so gooey! However, they are great like that too!

Many years ago I made a similar recipe. I can't even remember where I found it. All I could remember was the taste. Tonight, I just made it for Thanksgiving dinner dessert, and honestly I had to give it a try before I stored them. I was so amazed that these are just like that long lost recipe! I am very pleased! If you like the taste of rum, just add less. I however had to add a few teaspoons of water and a tiny bit of extra corn syrup to get it to get sticky enough to make the little balls with my cookie spoon. It made the job easier and faster. My guess is that since I had to reduce the recipe, I might have ended up with a bit more of the dry ingredients. Keeper!

EDIT: The first recipe I made this recipe it had less rum as I made half the it to try. The taste of rum turned out more mild than overpowering. It is indeed good. Now, I made this full recipe again. I think somebody mentioned that the recipe had a little too much rum. Well I think that review was correct, so I will add a bit less rum as someone else did. However, I would not give this recipe 1 star. The recipe is good just adjust to your preference in the alcohol content. Smell the dough and nibble a piece until you find it is good enough to your taste. KEEPER!

These are really wonderful!  I made them exactly according to the posted recipe and they're so easy and tasty!  I should have read the tips about chilling the dough before rolling, but I just made do by washing/drying my hands after rolling out 5-6 balls and it was fine.

This is not your average rum ball to me and anyone who tried them we all felt like they were not what a rum ball is supposed to be! If your looking for a slight truffle type ball this is not it! It was ok but I Wo,t be making this again!

So I gave it 3 because I changed the recipe around a lot. Instead of rum (because I don't like rum), I used bourbon. And instead of walnuts, I used toasted pecans. I added a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ginger, 1/8 tsp nutmeg, 1/8 tsp allspice. I also cut down on the amount of sugar in the "rum" balls. I like them just fine-- They certainly are boozy, though. I'll be interested in tasting them in a few days, after the flavors have a chance to meld and the booziness mellows. If not, then I'm sure I'd make these again, but I might put in 1/4 cup of booze rather than 1/2 cup.

Added these to my holiday baking list this year. Great rum flavor, nice texture. I added 1/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips for a little chocolate boost, and 2 extra Tbsp. rum as the mixture was a bit crumbly. Yum!

People normally love cookies I make but these were unsuccessful.  I did not care for the vanilla wafer base it was to bland and not sweet.  Plenty of rum flavor but the rest of the cookie was a huge let down.

All I really have to say about this recipe is "OMG!!" These are so good. I am not much of a rum fan but that will change with this recipe!  Always looking for new goodies to make for family and friends  over the holidays and this is definately gonna become a regular. Thanks for sharing.

I loved it. I forgot to add the corn syrup, but they tasted great anyways! For some reason, my dough wasn't sticky and rolled easily into balls. I am guessing its because I forgot to add the syrup? Also, I ocassionally dipped my hand into some rum (on the side) to keep the dough moist.
Thanks.

These were good, but not "over the moon!"  I did use bourbon in place of rum because I love bourbon!  I let them sit 3 days to develop and they did!  I think they have the perfect amount of alcohol flavor as is!

These are great and simple to make.  One batch isn't really enough for a dinner party so I made 2 batches. I added a tsp of almond extract to my 2nd batch.  Both the original and the modified versions were VERY well received.  This is a keeper recipe.

Made these for a cookie exchange and they went over great! Used Baileys or similar and the taste wasn't as strong as I figured other liquors could be, although i will try them also. This is quick and easy and I used a plastic 1 T. measuring spoon to compact dough, then coaxed it out with a round-tipped paring knife; then shaped into balls. I found this wasn't quite as messy.

I make these every year and people always love them.  I have substitued Malibu rum in for the light rum at times and it turns out super yummy too!  So easy and such a crowd pleaser.

These are wonderful and pretty easy to make! I substitute Kahlua for the rum because I really enjoy that flavor. I use a cookie scoop to get even sized balls and that yields about 3 doz -40 balls.

Good, although they do look like sand when you mix them they turned out great!. something I did to help role them into the balls was wet my hands, sounds odd but it helped lessen them sticking to your hands! Will make again!

did not like texture; walnuts with wafer pieces was too much for me I guess. Also not very sweet or chocolatey, and a little too rummy. Guess I will look for an all around smoother recipe.

This recipe was my first attempt at chocolate rum balls and they were WAY too strong. Will either try again and use less rum, or try a different recipe.

not sure why i'm not loving these, considering the amazing ratings they get.  i'm guessing it's because i had to sub graham crumbs for the wafer crumbs.  same texture but maybe different flavour?  these are not at all what i remember from childhood - found them to be very dry and the rum was quite potent.  i love rum but still found there to be quite an afterbite.

This recipe is perfect.  I put everything in the food processor; when the dough was ready, I shaped it into 1 inch balls and dropped them into a zip lock bag with confectioner's sugar to coat.  So easy!  They're good now, I can't imagine what they'll be like when the flavor develops.  I'm thinking of rolling some in coconut.  I love the rum/coconut combination.  Thank you FARMLIFE for sharing!

This is the easiest rum ball dough to handle. I used a melon baller for ease, and little rolling with my hands was necessary. I did slightly increase the rum (a little under 3/4 cup) and they were a tremendous hit. Make sure to use a quality rum (I used Myer's Dark) to really accentuate the rum's flavor. Excellent with after dinner coffee.

I needed to pull together a quick Christmas gift for a lunch meeting and this was perfect. I rolled some in powder sugar/cocoa mix and some in finely ground nuts. I used spiced rum as suggested by others. Easy to make and very tasty!

I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe! A friend had always said that her grandmother "baked her rum balls" and so when I realized this was essentially a "no bake" recipes, I was really surprised! I think 1/4 cup of liqour may have been too much, but my mother just couldn't get enough of these things! And they were just TOO easy to make. I think if I do make this recipe again I will try mixing other nuts, liqours, and toppings. Thanks for a fabulous recipe!!!

I didn't put them in the fridge for more enhanced flavor because I think I went a little too crazy with the rum~ hee hee! I don't think there were too many complaints though. Thanks for the great recipe!

Yum! These are really good. I don't like them very strong so I used less than 1/4 cup Apple Jack Brandy (is that brandy? It was either that or Cuervo in my liquor cabinet!) and the rest of the liquid was orange juice). The flavors did not blend well until the second day but there is just enough of a hint of the alcohol combined with the chocolate. I might try Kahlua in there next time! I used gloves to roll them to save the mess.

Making these was a little time consuming... I used Bailey's Irish Cream instead of rum and toasted coconut in mine and they tasted great. A little bit on the dry side, but other wise very tasty. I also rolled them in a mix of cocoa powder and powdered sugar, it looked a little more appealing.

this was an excellent recipe and everyone loved it! I found that I didn't like the look of them with the powdered sugar, so I dipped them in a mixture of Chocolate, Butter, and Parafin Wax and they turned out excellent. A little messy, but it was worth it!

I have used this recipe several times and used the vanilla sandwich wafers in place of the nilla wafers. Also, substituted orange juice in place of rum since I don't like alcohol. Was a huge hit with family, friends and co-workers.

I thought these were just okay - nothing great. I agree with another reviewer who said they taste like balls of cookie dough. Not too rummy, which is good. Probably will not make these again.

I substituted the rum w/ rum extract (1 fl oz bottle) and added water up to the 1/2 cup originally called for. also waited about 30 min before rolling into balls so that dough would harden a little and was easier to work with.

They werent my thing; they were OK. But everyone else really liked them!
I used coconut flavored rum which was a nice change, but I thought the balls were a little heavy & chewy. I guess I thought they would be more the consistency of fudge.

this was easy to make and they were awesome. I used the melon baller and if you pushed  the ball with some pressure after you made it it will look like an acorn. This was good for decoritive purposes.

Pretty good.  Mine tasted a little chalky from the cocoa powder.  I added a little less rum than was required and just substituted water.  I would probably make them again.

I ate a rum ball when I was about four years old, because I thought it looked like a chocolate Munchkin.  I have not eaten one since.  However, I made these as a Christmas gift for my boss last year, and he loved them!  He brought them to a family Christmas party about a week after I made them, and at that point they were so strong they got drunk! :)  I'm definitely making them again this year, and I might even try one this time.

These were great. I personally didn't have any as the smell of rum makes me feel sick :) but my husband and friend raved and raved over them so that is why I am giving them 5 stars. I will be making them again.

We were disappointed with these - they were very dry and the rum flavor was almost overpowering. I took them to a Christmas party and only one person would even touch them. Unfortunately the rest will get thrown out.

At last, the rum balls I sneakily bought as a young girl in Germany with my allowance money-$10.00 for 1 dozen.  These are wonderful, and I made the "37" version using rum extract (equal to rum plus 2 tablespoons water) and 2 oz chocolate jimmies for an alcohol free version. They taste exactly the same.

Very good. I used 1/4 cup Maker's Mark Bourbon and 1/4 cup of my own homemade flavoring to cut the alcohol content a little. Then I tried it with 1/4 cup of Bailey's and 1/4 cup of homemade flavoring, this was excellent!

I messed up doing the recipe and added 1 cup of rum instead of half. So I went ahead and dooubled the rest of the recipe. I used coconut rum and they tasted really good!

So easy! I could not believe that they came together as well as they did. Very good. Next time I will use a variation on the regular rum. Also- wish I would have planned ahead and bought more than one box of Nilla Wafers so I could make more than one batch.

I'm giving this five stars although we have yet to taste the end result. :) Forewarned by the quantity of rum, even after cutting back somewhat, I kept my 2-year old away from the bowl!! A half-batch made about 16 or 18 here, but I was using a tablespoon measure as a scoop. Made for a MUCH easier and cleaner way to roll the balls. Oh, and I needed to add an extra tablespoon or two of corn syrup, the balls were crumbling apart without it. I'll add to my review once we've tried them! *** 12/17/05 - These are tasty, but dry. The dryness would cause me to rate them as 4 stars (although the taste is 5 stars), but I DID cut back on the rum, so it's my fault. Next time, I'll add a little water if I decide to use half the rum.

Whoa!  These are really easy to make, but keep the kiddies away from them.  The longer you let them rest, the stronger the rum taste gets.  They're really quite good.

I made these yesterday. I was a little discouraged by their taste before putting them in the fridge, but overnight the taste and texture has improved dramatically. Don't skip this step or you will be losing a lot of very good flavor!

EDIT: Only a few are left from last night's ornament exchange. The girls loved this, and so did I!

Great recipe although I added a few ingredients that were a big hit, I chopped cherries and raisins into the mix, I also made the balls a little bigger and with an eye dropper I put a squirt of chocolate in the center of some and a dab of strawberry preserves in others, I ran out of wafers but used grahm crackers instead. Thanks for sharing

I made this recipe for a few memorial day cookouts we went to.  They were an abosolute hit.  Everyone loved them.  I didn't use walnuts as we don't care for them much, but replaced it with finely ground (in the food processor) honey roasted peanuts.  A++

Good and something different on the Christmas cookie tray. I made several changes. I used crushed almonds, chocolate flavored confectioners sugar, 1/8 cup cocoa, dark corn syrup and a splash of real mexican vanilla. Strong rum flavor.

Thanks for the recipe.  These are soooo good!  Just like my mom used to make.  I rolled half in powdered sugar and half in a mixture of cocoa and powdered sugar.

After a few days in the 'fridge, these cookies got a bit "ripe." I used Captain Morgan and the rum overpowered the chocolate flavor a bit. Tasty, but not a family favorite.

The best Rum Balls we have tasted!  I dipped them in chocolate and only enhanced the flavor.  Would not recommend for kids unless using artifical rum flavoring.

A friend last year made great rum balls.  She forgot to send me the recipe so I decided to look on line for a new one.  These tasted even better than hers.  I will probably make these again.  Thanks for the great recipe.
