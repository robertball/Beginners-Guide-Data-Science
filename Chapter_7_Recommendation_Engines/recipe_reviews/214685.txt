Such a refreshing, light and seasonal alternative to the typical and heavier potato and pasta salads, and I'm pleased to be the first to review it.  Nutritious and guilt-free, not only is this delicious, but it's pretty, colorful, and so simple with its few ingredients that it would complement almost anything.  I didn't have smoked olive oil (nor have I ever heard of it to tell you the truth!) so I used the extra virgin olive oil option.  Also, I'm not a big fan of balsamic vinegar (generally too heavy and sweet for me) so I substituted fresh lemon juice which for me was perfect.  This salad is great as is, but I would be interested to try it with fresh dill or parsley.  There are unlimited possibilies, of course, for other additions, but in my view that would just "busy this up" and then it wouldn't be the simple yet perfect salad it is just as written. This will be something I rely on often, since in addition to all the other things it has going for it, it's made from ingredients I readily have on hand.  Hope your recipe flys Lizbeth!

Delicious and simple. This is a wonderful way to use up some of those fresh, summer zucchini. It's a great side dish for a summer meal.

I loved this salad!  I did make a modification though, instead of putting raw bell pepper I just roasted the pepper a bit and added it to the salad.

This recipe is a perfect side dish for summer cook-outs and a great way to use up excess zucchini from your garden! I would use more of the dressing next time and more salt. I added about 1/2 tsp lemon zest as well to brighten the flavor and counteract the sweetness of the balsamic.

I made a LITTLE bit of this last night because I needed to find a side to go with ribs quickly. We were tired of the same old baked beans or mac and cheese. I was given two large Zucchini from a friend's garden. I looked up Zucchini and found this. I wish I had made more, which, I am going to do tonight because it is so easy and tastes so good. I didn't have nor have heard of baby zucchini so I used a large one. A Vidalia onion instead of red. A green instead of red pepper. I also didn't have fresh basil,I used the dried, regular olive oil too and followed the directions to the letter. So I didn't change the recipe just used different types of the same ingredients. LOL. Thanks for sharing Lizbeth. This is really refreshingly light and delicious!

I just whipped this up because I had some baby zucchini that I was going to cook and saw this recipe.  I like the raw option for veggies whenever possible.  I used cilantro which was suggested in another review instead of basil and since I had a lime, I added lime zest as well.  I used 3 T oil and 2T of Oliver's 25 year old  barrel aged balsamic.  Wow, so refreshing and the lime and cilantro knock it out of the park!  I will definitely make this often. Thanks Lizabeth.

light and refreshing. I used tomatoes and thin stips of spinach. I never had raw yellow squash before and it was great with the little crunch. Next time I'll try the zucchini.

Very easy and quick to make.  I used extra virgin olive oil instead of the smoked kind and red wine vinegar instead of balsamic.  Nice........will make again.

I made this salad for a neighborhood cook-out. I used home grown zucchini and fresh basil right off the plant. I doubled the recipe so used a yellow bell pepper as well as the red for some added color. I held back a bit on the vinegar as I didn't want to overwhelm the fresh vegie flavors. Everyone who tried the salad loved it, and one person said it "had quite a kick". Next time I make it, I'm going to try cilantro instead of basil.

Used one large zucchini instead of five small and let it sit for awhile to tenderize the red onion a bit. It was good and something different to make to use up zucchini but didn't overly impress me.

This was very good, but made a good amount.  Didn't taste as good the second day, so half if your only making for two or three as a side dish.

I enjoyed this! It was a nice, light side dish to offer at a BBQ. It is also a great side dish to have available for the health conscious, gluten free or vegetarian. I used white wine vinegar and added lemon juice. Adding a baby yellow squash made it a bit more colorful and appealing. Thanks! Will make this again!
