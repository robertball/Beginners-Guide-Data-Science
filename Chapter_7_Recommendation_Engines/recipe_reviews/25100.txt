I'd like to give this recipe 4 1/2 stars, since the only thing that keeps it from the 5 stars is that the actual cookie (excluding the jam) has a very bland taste, so I added 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract, made the cookies really great! I baked a batch yesterday, and it didn't last a day, so I baked another today. Also I used 1 whole egg instead of two yolks and used strawberry jam. Delicious, thanks for the recipe!

Incredible!! here is a trick for getting the jam in the hole quickly and easily. Take sandwich bag and spoon the jam into the bottom of the bag. Massage slightly to get lumps out. Make a small snip in the bottom of the bag so you can squeeze out the jam into the holes in the dough. I used seedless blackberry jam..great choice!! I topped baked cookies with a coat of sifted powdered sugar. I'm going to always double this recipe. They are gone before they're cooled!!

This is an excellent recipe. After my cookies were done, (while still warm) I dipped them in powdered sugar for a different look and taste. They are VERY yummy this way! I uploaded a photo of them for those who would like to see what they look like this way. The powdered sugar melts into the jam, so it looks like there is powdered sugar only on the cookie part. Otherwise, I followed it by the recipe. Make sure not to overfill them with jam (this is what I did the first time,... and they overflowed onto the cookie sheet).Make the hole deep enough to actually hold some jam. GREAT RECIPE!

I absolutely love this recipe and I think it's a shame that it gets so many low ratings. It looks like a lot of bakers are making simple mistakes that ruin what should be a wonderful cookie. 

BLAND COOKIES - You may have used the wrong butter. I know the recipe just says "butter", but unless a recipe specifies unsalted, assume it means salted. Beyond that, you need to understand that this is a butter cookie. It's not meant to be very overly sweet. For the best tasting cookie, use high quality butter and jam. The quality of your butter can make a big difference. 

FLAT COOKIES - Your dough is too warm. Chill for half an hour to an hour before baking. The other possibility here is that you've used margarine. Margarine is not butter. 

DRY CRUMBLY COOKIE - You've probably overworked the dough. This can happen if your butter is too cold when you begin. 

BROKEN COOKIES, LEAKING JAM - You're making the wells too deep or overfilling them. Try using the back of a half teaspoon to make the indentations and fill with a bit less jam.

I am so glad to be the first to rate this recipe; I almost didn't try it because it wasn't rated yet and I needed a quick, fool-proof recipe.  It was both, and I hope your ratings and reviews reflect it soon.  This was super easy and fun for me and my seven year old to make together; of course she loved the thumbprints and filling them!  The cookies do not taste like quick and easy ones though...they are soft and yummy.  I hope to pass this down as a traditional cookie in my family.  It did take the full 10 minutes to bake; 8 wasn't long enough, and they do not look done even then because they are a very light color...only the bottoms brown well.  We used peach preserves...you could use any kind!  Thank you for the great recipe!

These are such cute cookies!  They are very easy to make, and taste yummy.  I made a little indent in the cookies using the handle of a wooden spoon, and I just pressed it gently without making  a deep hole, and the jam sat in the hole perfectly.  I did notice that the jelly I used became really liquidy and runny, because they are made with juice instead of fruit, so next time I will use actual fruit jam.

AWESOME! I had enough mix to make about 26 cookies.  I found that 1/2 tsp of jam was a bit too much, as it overflowed over the cookie once baked.  Also keep a close eye on the cookies while in the oven, they cook quickly, and while the tops still look uncooked the bottoms may be black:)  They harden once they sit.

These were wonderful and very tastey!  They were so pretty with a dusting of powdered sugar.  I only got 20 cookies out of my batch though, maybe they were a tad bit big but they looked just right.  I also only ended up using 1/4 cup of jam since that's all that was needed.  I plan to make some more today!  

To add the jam into the centers you chould put it into a zip lock baggie and cut the tip off of the corner of the bag.  This makes the jam dispersion nice and neat.

I can't believe how easy this recipe was.  I followed it to a T and didn't change a thing.  Some others explained that you'll need less flour.  I did not. Nor was it crumbly when I rolled it into balls.  It was a perfect texture.  If I were to make a guess, I'd say they didn't let their butter sit out before they used it.  I let mine out for about an hour before  I made the cookie dough.  Then I mixed it very well with the sugar.  They will be a must on my list for Christmas cookies from now on.

I made these last night and brought them in to work for taste testing - they are a big hit! I used seedless raspberry jam in some and apricot preserves in the others and they were both very good. I am definitely going to add these to my Christmas cookie trays.
They're also very easy to make - just be sure to keep an eye on them because they brown quickly.

What a wonderful little cookie!  I had enough dough to make four dozens.  I used 1/2 cup butter, 1/4 cup margarine and added one teaspoon vanilla extract.  I baked two trays each time, rotating half way through (total 15 minutes or so).  I did not fill the holes before baking.  Half way through, I indented the holes again.  After the cookies were done, I filled them with store-bought chocolate frosting and topped that with chocolate sprinkles.  This really is a buttery, cute little cookie!  I will definitely use this recipe again.

This is a great recipe!  This is the 2nd Christmas I've made these and they are a hit.  I doubled the recipe and used seedless raspberry jam.  I then melted white choc. baking bar with a small amount of shortening and drizzled over the top.  Yum!

These are wonderful! I followed the directions exactly and they came out beautifully - so rich and buttery! I could only eat 2 of them.

To make my well, I used the skinny end of a wooden spoon, gently pushed it in the dough, and lightly twisted so I was in a sense "drilling" a hole through the center. Once you form the hole, you can carefully push against the sides with the end of the spoon to widen the well. 

I also took the advice of another poster and put my preserves in a small ziplock and snipped off the corner, which created a very nice make-shift pastry bag. Great suggestion, thank you.

I didn't refridgerate my cookies, they took about 11 minutes to bake, and they stayed nice and soft. Great recipe, perfect for the holiday or anytime you want something sweet. THANK YOU!

These were really nice cookies - sweet and buttery without greasyness. I didn't realise I only had whole wheat until I started making them, but no one noticed and they had a nice taste to them so I think I'll keep using it. I filled my with blackberry jam and rolled the edges in sliced almonds. I will have to make more... possibly immediately.

Wonderful cookie. I know it's not fair to change things then review, but this is such a great basic recipe I couldn't resist. I beat the two egg white until frothy, then dipped the dough balls into the egg whites. Put some bagged shedded coconut into a small bowl and roll the egg white coated dough ball into the coconut. Put in your thumbprint then your jelly. I used McCutcheon's Triple Crown Preserves. You could probably tint the coconut according to the holiday if desired.

These were passable. Nothing fancy. The cookie was too soft when cooked. The dough lacked flavour. Vanilla extract or something similar wouldn't go astray.

I was craving a good jam filled cookie so I made these yesterday.  These are very easy turned out great.  I used whole wheat flour, added 1.5 tsp of vanilla, and 1/4 tsp of salt.  For the jam I used organic strawberry preserves, they were all gone within a couple hours!

The recipe was good, but it was almost too sweet for me, next time ill try and use alittle less sugar.  Also, the little thumb filled cookies never seemed to have enough jam inside no matter how much I put, so I changed the shape into almost like a small tart.  Those where much better!

This recipe is wonderful!  I almost didn't try it because I am a chocolate lover and I usually save my calories for chocolate-packed desserts, but these cookies are buttery-sweet and strawberry or blackberry preserves add a perfect finishing touch.  They look lovely on a tray for tea-time or parties.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla for an even sweeter-tasting cookie, and it was delicious!  I will use this recipe again and again.

these are so good and so easy.  i did add about 1/4 tsp of almond extract and about 1/2 tsp of vanilla.  i also cut the flour back to 1 1/2 cup.   i used a 1/2 teaspoon to make the hole and it worked perfectly.  i will be making these again....possibly tomorrow.

This was a very nice, simple recipe that turned out great. As a personal preference, I cut glazed cherries in half and pressed those on the tops instead.

These came out well.  Very easy to make.  Needed a few more minutes of cooking time, and ended up with 28 cookies instead of 36 (I tried to make 36, but the dough was too thin to hold the filling).

This recipe turned out great...i made 3 batches and every one of them came out better than the other.  I couldnt help myself from taking a couple to try out....and had my husband hide the rest so i wouldnt eat it but im sure he'll be snacking on them.  The only thing is that you dont want to put too much jam in it because it can run over the sides and looks a little messy...Everything about this cookie is excellent...i gave some to my landlord and she wants the recipe...they are a big hit.

These cookies are amazing! Based on reviews, I added 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract, and I used 1 whole egg instead of two yolks. I filled them with my homemade raspberry jam. They are to die for!! Had I not baked them to take them to a Christmas party, all of them would have been gone within a few hours of coming out of the oven! I will definitely be making these again! I got 30 cookies out of a single batch.

My grandkids were so proud of themselves.  These turned out great, after all they are a BUTTER COOKIE.  But we also made a batch that included vanilla.  They used there little thumbprints and everyone loved.

Very yummy.... I added just a few drops of vanilla extract for some extra flavor to the dough.  I suggest you use a wet finger to make the wells in the dough or else it will stick to you.

These cookies are wonderful.  I refrigerated the dough for about an hour and it was easy to work with. I also did as another reviewer suggested and added 1/4 tsp. salt, 2 tsp. vanilla and a whole egg instead of 2 yolks.  I also found that if I dipped my finger in a little flour when making the well in the cookie, my finger didn't stick to the dough.  My husband just loves this recipe.  Thanks Missi.

Definitely easy to make!  I only got 28 cookies out of the recipe, though.  I used Maine blueberry jam, peach, apricot and red raspberry.  They will look very pretty on the Christmas cookie tray.  I wonder if some of the people on here that had trouble with the dough may have used margarine instead of butter.

Wow, these are SO good and easy to make! The only thing wrong with them is that they are so good you REALLY have to exert some self-control not to gorge.  :)  (I had a moment of concern when I took them out of the oven, because they didn't look done.  They were golden on the bottom though, like the directions said, so I took her word for it.  Good thing too, because they were done perfectly. They just remain pale on top, so don't let that fool ya!)

These turned out great.  I gave most of them away and people wanted to be taught how to make these.  Nice and buttery and sweet.  The recipe it makes 36, but I only got 24, but maybe I like my cookies big.  I found that 375 was too hot, baking at 350 for 9 minutes on the top rack worked for me.  But everyone's oven is different.  I tried four flavors:  strawberry, blackberry, apricot, and marmalade.  They were all great.  Highly recommend.

I found this recipe and tried it on a whim. I am so glad I did! Now whenever there's a gathering, people ask me to bring my jam cookies, and I find myself making them quite often! My sister-in-law loves them too, and I can often use them as a bribe-cookie for favours :) This is definitely a recipe that will always be in my cookbook. Thanks!

Didn't use JAM because my hubby doesn't like it; instead I shaped them in small circles (not balls) and drizzled melted semi-sweet chocolate on top; YUMMY and pretty

a great fast and easy  cookie to make at a moments notice with ingredients that are almost  always on hand. I  made these a  sugar free cookie by using  sugar free raspberry jam.and a sugar substitute . I use the whole egg just because I don't like to waste the white . A little tip I would like to share when baking cookies  a drop cookie If the dough is to sticky to spoon  put the blow in the refrigerator for about an hour that makes it easy to spoon and keeps it from spreading too much when you bake it  , the next time these I will try a little vanilla or  almond extract  great cookie

I love this recipe!  I had lost my original "Butter Gems" recipe and this was it!  I had to make this at least four times last year and already I've made it twice.  I made it as written and it turns out perfect every time!

These cookies are so easy to make delicious and pretty.  I took a batch for Thanksgiving piled into the Cornucopia recipe on this site...(I did make my own bread for the cornucopia).  The Grandkids and grownups all loved them.  I baked them on parchment paper to keep them from browning.  They were filled with my strawberry jam...I found 1/4 teaspoon to be just enough jam to fill the whole made with the end of a wooden spoon as suggested by baker....next time I will press the rolled ball of dough down onto some large baker sugar crystals for a bit more varity and sparkle for Xmas. I order this sugar from the King Aruthor Flour Bakers Catalog..they have a website and the catalog will be sent to you free. Wonderful flour..the best as far as Im concerned. Lots of recipes ect.

Yum!  I made these for a Christmas cookie exchange and my husband said "but no one likes jam filled cookies" until he tried these ones!  After making many batches of these, I found that using the knuckle on my index finger to make the imprints worked best, it seemed to contain the jam better.  I used chokecherry syrup which was an amazing combination.

Everyone I have made these for agree that they are THE best cookies ever!  (These won me the Xmas cookie contest at my office!)  I add a teaspoon of vanilla to mine; gives the actual cookie part a better flavor.  The key to these cookies is really good butter; I usually use Organic Valley Pasture Butter and those always come out 100% better than the batches I have made with regular butter.  At the very least, definitely use a salted butter.  When I first made these last year, I used the strawberry jelly that I had just made from fresh picked early glow strawberries; those were heaven in cookie-form!  They smell amazing straight from the often, but don't eat it right away, no matter how tempted you are - molten jelly is the hottest thing on earth!  Warning:  You will become addicted.  But it's worth it.  Go and make these right now!

I followed the directions as shown, the dough was very crumbly and sometimes hard to keep together long enough to form a ball and get a good hole in it. However, they are still good when baked and turned out looking cute.

Delicious!! the dough reminded me of those danish butter cookies we buy every year for christmas, with the exception that these butter cookies are waaaay cheaper. It uses the simplest ingredients and they're pretty easy to prepare. I placed each cookie ball into paper muffin cups and floured my index finger to make the wells, making sure there was enough room for the jam. Sprinkled with powdered sugar when baked and they looked just lovely. I'm planning to give these away as christmas gifts in the coming years. Also added one small egg instead of two yolks, and they came out perfect anyway. Thank you sooo much MKHG, this recipe of yours is excellent!

These cookies are great!  Only addition I made was to add 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of salt.  I dipped my palms in warm water before rolling the dough into balls and had no problem with sticking as other reviewers noted.  I used grape & strawberry jam...yummy & VERY addicting!!  I will definitely make these again!  Thanks for sharing :)

I made these this week for Christmas baking and they were absolutely delicious, light, and buttery.  I was searching for an alternative recipe which I had been making for years; and this will definetly be the new replacement.  My son and husband love them soooo much; there won't be any around for Christmas.  The best thumbprint cookie recipe ever!!

These were very easy, quick cookies.  Light buttery taste but not greasy at all.  I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe itself, but next time I might try crushing lifesaver candies and filling the thumbhole with them instead of jam.  I had a recipe for that cookie once but I didn't like the cookie itself.  This cookie recipe will be perfect with them.  Also, use a variety of jams!

Great little cookie! I was at first surprised to see there was no actual leavener in this cookie but it turned out great anyway! Very buttery taste...not quite chewy or soft, but shortbread-like texture. I was very pleased to see them pop out of the oven looking like little flowers! I used raspberry jam and added some lemon juice and zest to the dough. So easy too, thanks for the recipe!

I just made these, and they are almost gone already!  I used a Pampered Chef small scoop (like a small ice cream scoop)and that was the perfect size amount for the balls; I then used the small end of a mellon-baller to make the imprint...also a perfect size.  A small lunch baggie filled with jam, tiny hole snipped in corner did great to fill the imprints with jam.  Never got my hands messy and I did end up with 36 cookies!  YUM!!!  Easy and fast recipe! Thanks Missi!  This recipe is a keeper!

I am liking this recipe!  Made them with my cookie press, and a flower die,  just added a little more flour to stiffen the dough, worked great. I did follow someone else's suggestion and added 2 tsp vanilla and a pinch of salt.  Made red rasp, now  am going to make a batch with black rasp and one with home made peach jam..... Mmmmm!!   :) Thanks for the good recipe~!

These are absolutely delicious! I added a little bit more sugar and sprinkled some powdered sugar on top. I used homemade raspberry and black raspberry jam for the filling. Also tried it with a peach apricot jam, which was my favorite! Great holiday treat. Will make again!

I put pumpkin butter in them.  They are like little pumpkin pies.  I added some vanilla and used one egg instead of 2 egg yolks.

A must on our Christmas cookie list, I add a pouch of vanilla sugar, use raspberry or cranberry jelly, it is festive and the tartness offsets the richness of the cookie.

I love this recipe!! I made a small batch this past weekend and my family ate them all in one day! I did think the batter was a little bland so I added 1tsp of vanilla extract and it was perfect! So simple and so yummy!!!

This recipe is very similar to the one I make every chirstmas. The only difference is I add 2 tsp of lemon juice before adding the flour and I roll the dough in crushed nuts before indenting and baking. Then the finishing touch- drizzle with white chocolate. YUM.

Great! I added the 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and a dash of salt.  I made two batches of cookies and then for the last batch of cookies I added 1/4 teaspoon of almond extract to the batter.  Then I rolled the dough into a ball and dipped in the egg whites, and rolled in grinded almonds.  Then filled with jelly.  They came out great.

Awesome.  I did add 1/2 tsp. vanilla as suggested and 1/8 tsp. salt.  I chilled the dough and used the vanilla cap to make the indentations...perfect size.  I put my preserves in a ziploc and piped them into the wells..very neat results.  I used Trader Joe's organic raspberry preserves, and they didn't run at all.  They looked just like the picture.  But to even make them prettier, I drizzled white chocolate over the tops.  They are beautiful!  And they taste great too!

I just made these for the first time today.  I added 3/4 tsp vanilla extract to the dough, and I doubled the recipe.  I couldn't incorporate the full doubled amount of flour; I ended up using 3 cups.  Next time around I'm going to reduce the flour further to 2 3/4 cups as the dough was a bit difficult to handle (it was super crumbly.) I also made the cookies a bit larger than the recipe called for (about 1 1/2 inch cookies) and increased baking time to 11-12 minutes.  I used raspberry and boysenberry jam and the results were superb.  Overall, a very tender cookie with old-fashioned appeal.

Absolutely wonderful!! Very easy to make.  Melt in your mouth. I used black currant jam as it was what I had on hand.  Also, I added just a little bit of vanilla extract to the dough.  Adding this to my cookie list. Thanks!!

These were very easy and fun to make.  I made them with my 4 year old daughter and we both loved them!  I didn't make the holes big enough for the preserves, so it was kinda hard to get the preserves in.  I used the end of a wooden spoon.  Next time, I'll just use my finger, it should work better!

Oh. My. Goodness. This is now in my Top 5 favorite cookie recipes, ever! This is fantastic, and easy due to the few ingredients. Just mix, roll, fill and bake. This is a keeper for sure! And definitely use the handle of your wooden spoon to poke holes...very tidy and easy to do. Delicious with strawberry jam filling.

They taste great and look good.  I wish I'd seen the review about dipping the warm cookies in powdered sugar before I made them because I think it would make them even prettier.  Don't make the holes too deep or all the jam won't melt during the cooking time--a lesson learned because I was greedy and wanted lots of jam.  I wish I'd doubled the recipe because it doesn't make a lot.

YUMM-O!  These were so simple tasting, but got better with each bite.  Instead of making a hole, I made a thumbprint which is undoubtedly easier to fill.  I used Dickenson's raspberry preserves and dusted the cookies with powdered sugar once they were cool.  Beautiful cookie.

This recipe was QUITE tasty.  However, I would make a few changes next time, because.... I thought the cookies were going to hold their shape more! You really DO need to place these cookies 2 FULL inches apart on the cookie sheet; they spread out like there's no tomorrow.  I'd add a tad more flour to the mix as prevention.  I want little cookie puffs!  Not cookies that look like fried eggs.  *Teehee*  Other suggestion... make 'em smaller, so that they are cute without a flour adjustment.

I just took the cookies out of the oven, and I cannot stop eating them. I used the plunger from a large baby syringe to make the indentations.  I added a pinch of salt , plus vanilla and almond extract.  They were quick and easy to make.

I made these cookies with my daughter and they didn't come out good at all.  I was surprised by all of the reviews saying they came out great.  Ours came out like flat pancakes.   I used only the ingredients listed on this recipe.  Going to look for another recipe and see how they come out.

I added 1/4 tsp. of salt and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. I rolled the balls in regular sugar and then made the indention and added blueberry jam to half and raspberry to the other half.  I did not have any problems with the dough since I made sure the butter and egg yolks were at room temp. Thanks MKHG for sharing your recipe!

I baked them only for 10-12 minutes, and put them in a closed box when still warm.
It gives them a shortbread texture.

I gave it 4 stars because it is a quick and easy recipe, but BLAND as can be! I made it as is the first time around and truly had to throw it out. It was bland beyond reason. The 2nd time I made it I added salt and vanilla and the result was very good. Even better was when I added slivered almonds and a small pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg (not enough to overtake the cookie, but just enough to subtly flavor the cookie and make you go hmmm...) 

While I prefer a bit more flavor, this is a great basic shortbread cookie recipe. Seeing that I have made it 10 times in the last 4 months, it will stay in my recipe box (but with salt and vanilla added). :-)

I wish there was an option for 4 1/2 stars.  The cookies are much enjoyed in our house.  Two things I did to make them even better:  
1. I made and filled the cookies while the dough was warm then I put them in the refrigerator for an hour.  The cookies didn't have cracks when I made the thumbprint when the dough was warmer and the cookies kept a better shape when baking.
2.  I added 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract which made the fruit filling flavor pop.

followed the recipe to the letter but they didn't turn out like the photos. First I could roll the dough because it was too sticky (it was in the fridge for an hour) roll out. Used a cookie scoop to place them on the sheets and had to use a oil measuring spoon to make the holes for the jam. Just too sticky to use the thumb. Baked for 10 minutes and the bottom was a prefect golden brown but the raspberry preserves kinda bled into the edge of the hole in the cookie. Taste great though! I guess I'd better read more of the reviews before trying this one again.

These cookies are THE BEST if you follow the modifications of Maria Isa (which is why these cookies get four stars instead of five). So, I substituted a whole egg for the 2 yolks, added 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract. They came out buttery and sweet and soft and delicious! Mine did spread a little, but not so much that they spread into a flat, crunchy mess. Also, I used strawberry jelly because I didn't have any jam. They still came out good with the jelly. Just be careful not to eat these right out of the oven--the jelly is hot. Anyway, with modifications mentioned above, these are the best cookies I've ever made.
EDIT: I found that if you have problems with the cookies spreading, you can cut out 1/8 cup butter without losing any flavor, and end up with perfect cookies.

I am happy to give this recipe 5 stars because the basic recipe is just so good. However, after reading reviews, I did make a few minor adjustments for my own personal taste. I added just a pinch of salt to the dough and also added 1 tsp. of almond extract to the dough because we like that flavor. Then as a variation, I used the egg whites from the 2 egg yolks as an egg wash to brush over the outside of the cookie dough balls and then rolled the outside in crushed, toasted pecans before making the thumb print and adding the jam to the center. I made half the cookies without nuts and the other half with. I have been on a mission to find the perfect thumb print cookie for our taste and this recipe definitely fits the bill. They are wonderful. This is a real keeper and one I will be making for many years to come! Thanks so much for sharing this one.

My first time making butter cookies and this was a big hit with my family!  The only thing I changed was taking the advise of one of the members and switching 2 egg yolks to 1 whole egg instead.  Also I'm a fan of vanilla flavours so I added 1 teaspoon to the mix.  Everything else is fantastic, thank you!

I added chopped pecans and used the strawberry preserve/jam/jelly that was in the fridge and LOVED it! :) Perfect the way it is. There is no need to add any more sugar or vanilla. The subtle flavors are a great getaway from the normal over-the-top sweetness of most cookies and they were really easy to bake....even with a three year old helping.

DELICIOUS! A little bit time-consuming to make, but they turned out perfectly. A good recipe to make with kids- you can have them make the holes while you fill them with jam... They remind me of warm biscuits with jam...

I've made these about a dozen times and I love them.  I do fiddle with the recipe (I add vanilla and a pinch of salt), but they deserve a perfect score just for being a great starting point for a simple cookie.

Very good!  I increased the sugar and used a whole egg as suggested.  I should've left them in the fridge a bit longer as they spread (Happens to me all of the time.  I overwork dough and have my butter too warm.)  The cookies were delish, though.  I will make them again, probably adding a bit of almond extract next time.

The bottom of my cookies started to burn for my first batch.  For the second batch, I used the top rack (rather than the middle) and floured the baking sheet, and they turned out great.

Yum! !   Make sure carefully to follow the baking directions; getting the cookie bottoms golden brown as directed is important for best flavor, though we happily scarfed down the slightly over and under-baked ones as well.

I wouldn't change a thing!  This recipe is a 5 Star recipe as is.  Cookies are buttery and melt in your mouth.  I used some Moravian Fig Spread from Whole Foods in my cookies and it was divine!  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing MKHG

Made these for my stepdad for christmas with blackberry jam. He ate two as soon as they came out of the oven! The only problems I had were with the amount. I scaled it so it should've made 24, but the dough did not look like enough, so I then doubled it. It should, therefore, have made 48. It made 17! But they were still good, so it doesn't really matter.

These were delicious! I followed the recipe exactly. I used a clean chapstick cap dipped in flour to make my indentations. They really were easy to make and I loved that you don't need to refrigerate the dough. I will definitely make them again!

Thank you for sharing this recipe! It is so good and so easy. I was tempted to add vanilla as suggested in some reviews, but decided to leave it out. I'm glad I did. These are butter cookies, not sugar cookies. The taste is perfect. Would be excellent with tea. I used my mom's homemade strawberry jam, which is my comfort food, and they turned out wonderful. I will take her some at Thanksgiving. I did use the suggestion to use a baggie for the jam - be careful not to cut the hole too big or the jam gets sloppy. I did not alter the recipe at all, I think the turned out exactly like they are supposed to. NOTE: these bake only until the bottom is light brown, if you wait for the top to brown you will over bake them.

These turned out wonderful!  As other reviewers suggested, I added salt, used the back of a wooden spoon to create deep holes (great idea), and used a sandwich bag to fill each hole with jam. Next time I will try rolling them in fine ground nuts.  Thanks for all the tips-- without them, I don't know if these would have earned 5 stars!

I made these into hamantashen (triangle shaped) for Purim and they were really outrageous!  I did add 1/4 tsp salt and 2 tsp vanilla as one other reviewer suggested.  I think this will be my regular recipe.  The only problem is I inhaled 4 of them in about 10 seconds...

these were very yummy! =D i used raspberry jam and it came out great! but for some reason they are all flat and blended into each other. i tried storing them in the fridge for 20 minutes before baking them so that they'd stay the same shape, but that didnt work either. anyone  know what i should do?

This is a very quick and easy cookie to make. They turn out great every time and you can mix up the jam flavors for everyone. I love fig, apricot, and strawberry! A ziplock bag with the corner snipped off gets the jam in place without a big mess. Be careful not to overfill, though, or it will burn the excess jam and make it really chewy and tough!

I just made these cookies with my two-year old daughter and they turned out delicious! 

A did make a few changes: I added vanilla (as other reviewers suggested) and my daugher rolled the balls of dough in sugar before putting them on the cookie sheet. Also, I found that 7 minutes was the optimal time for my oven.

Interestingly, (especially after reading so many reviews saying they only got 20 cookies) I ended up with 48 cookies! But then again, being the engi-nerd that I am, I was pretty precise on my one-inch dough balls! The result was perfect bite-size cookies...does that mean I can I call these low-calorie? :-)

This one goes in my recipe box...I'll be making them again soon!

Easy, fast, and yummy! What more could you ask for in a cookie. Seedless blackberry, or boysenberry is a must. I also prettied them up a bit by sprinkling with granulated sugar while they were hot out of the oven so the sugar melts into the jam and looks crystally on the cookie. A+

I made a batch of these cookies, took them to a Christmas dinner and they were an immediate hit!  Everyone loved them- there were not enough to go around!  I am not much of a baker but this recipe was simple and delicious!  

I used to melon baller and a toothpick to quickly fill cookies with jam.  I use the back of the melon baller to create a little well, then I use the melon baller to scoop jam into the well.  I insert the toothpick into the tiny hole on the melon baller to release the jam onto the cookie.

Such a simple and yummy recipe! I used strawberry-rhubarb jam and it came out delicious! I do think I will try the suggestion of others and add some salt and vanilla extract to the next batch of dough.... but I will definitely be making these again!
P.S. The baggie trick really works! I was able to neatly fill the thumbprints without much difficulty at all!

These amazing little shortbread cookies were a treat to make and even better to eat.  I also added some vanilla and salt.  I used homemade strawberry and apricot jam.  I liked the strawberry better - just a better combination.  I also rolled them in sugar before I but the jam in.  Next time I am going to put finely chopped pecans in them for a twist!  I highly recommend!  They are fantastic!

This very tender butter cookie was a big hit for Christmas. I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon of salt which really brought out the simple flavor of the cookie (I used unsalted butter so omit the salt if you're using salted butter). I filled them with black currant preserves which were nice and tart. I was a bit concerned about the recipe only having 1/2 cup of sugar, so I rolled each ball in granulated sugar before forming the well for the preserves. The amount of sweetness was perfect and the granules of sugar weren't detectable after baking. After cooling, the jam centers set nicely and they were easy to stack for transporting. One more thing - they took 14 minutes in my oven to get a light golden brown on the bottom.

Excellent cookie!  Not overly sweet.  Melts in your mouth.  My husband has looked at me in adoration since he tasted them.  Will become a Christmas favorite at our house!

Just made these tonight - as simple butter cookie, it was very good. Reason for 4 stars:  I was hoping for a more complex flavor, but again, this was a simple butter cookie.  It was very easy to prepare.  Loved the tips to include vanilla (1/2 teaspoon for a double recipe) and to use the end of a wooden spoon to make the wells for the jam.  I used a cookie scoop and had to cook mine at least 11 minutes to get the golden bottom.  It’s important to cook until you get a little bit of color on the bottom otherwise the cookie taste undercooked.  Next time I might add orange zest as someone else suggested.  Four stars in my book!

These are AMAZING!  I had a little assembly line of cookies going and by the far, these were the easiest and go over really big!  If  you like easy, well this one is it and not quite as expensive to make as the jelly filled cookies that have the nuts in them. (Linzer Torte cookies)  They taste wonderful and make a beautiful product.  Expand your imagination on the filling.  I did a Morello Cherry cookie from preserves I got at Aldi.  They are really GREAT!

These cookies are DELICIOUSO!  I only got 23 of them though.  I guess I have a biggish cookie scoop or something.  So I'd plan on doubling it if you were making them for anything other than snacking around the oven!  I'm scared I'm going to have to make more before lunch tomorrow!  

Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

I think this is a wonderful cookie, easy to make, ingredients all bakers should have in their pantry at a moments notice, quick. I found it to be a light and buttery cookie...also I hate overly sweet and this was not overly sweet at all.

I'm sorry but these are just not the jam cookies I remember! I definetely can agree with the pie crust comment, they overall were very dry & crumbly and lacking in flavor :( I called my aunt because she has always made the best Christmas cookies & she uses the recipe out of the Betty Crocker cookbook. I'll definitely be trying that next time instead.

A nice, simple recipe for a soft, buttery cookie that my family enjoyed. Would go really well with tea. I used another reviewer's tip and used the handle of a wooden spoon to make the indentation in the center. These have a pretty presentation that can add some color to your dessert table. Bonus: this helped to use up some fruit preserves that no one was eating otherwise! I'll give it four stars for simplicity and broad-based appeal. Thanks for the recipe! UPDATE 5/2010 - I took others' advice and added 1/4 tsp salt and some vanilla - good decision! Raves from all.

I love this recipe.  I fill it with all kinds of jam to get different varieties.  It was a hit everywhere I brought them.  The kids love them!  I find that using a 1/2 tsp to fill the cookie up is easier than using a ziploc bag.  It's less messy and fills the cookie perfectly.  Less gunk on your hands make everything nicer.

I have been looking for this exact cookie! Very Tender, buttery...yummy! I used homemade pear jam for center, came out great. I did however add 1/2 tsp. of salt to boost flavor.  Great recipe!

These cookies are great, and very easy to make. When the dough isn't quite soft enough, they do tend to crumble a bit, so make sure not to put in too much flour.

My only adjustment to this recipe is that I reserve the egg whites and use them to wet the balls of dough, then dip them in finely chopped walnuts or almonds before "thumbprinting" and filling with jam.

I didn't find that these had much flavor and that they were a little dry.  I prefer a sweeter mor sugar-cookie like base for my jam thumbprints and these were not it.

This cookie was so easy to make and it tasted soooo good.  I had a little bit of a time with the dough because it was crumbly but other than that no problems.  Everyone at work loved them.  I will be using this recipe for my annual cookie exchange.

Very easy and unique cookie.  I would suggest you lightly grease the cookie sheets though.  I thought that helped get the cookies off easier and helped with cleaning the pan.  I made the indentation with the end of a wooden meat mallet (a big wooden spoon might be big enough also) and it was a perfect size and made it easy.  Don't overfill with jam though.  Then it makes a messy mess and a messy looking cookie.

Wow! I wish I could give this recipes 10 stars. What a delicious cookie! I used strawberry jam and drizzled with powdered sugar glaze. Mine took 12 minutes to bake and came out perfect. I will definetly be making these time and time again. Hope my waistline will forgive me!

Wonderful cookies...I'm adding this to my recipe box for sure. We used three different kinds of jam, and each one was delicious. Just beware - those little things are addictive - before you know it, you'll have munched away a 1/4 cup of butter all by yourself...

I love jam cookies and these were no disappointment. I followed the tip of another reviewer and added 2 tsp of vanilla extract and 1/4 tsp of salt to the dough--I could tell by the original recipe that this dough might be bland. These cookies are quick and easy to make and ideal for those with young children, because who doesn't like to poke holes in dough? Also, the few ingredients are items most people already have on hand; these aren't expensive. The 1/2 tsp of jam seems like so little, but actually it is just right. I rolled the dough into balls about 1-1/4-inch in diameter. They baked perfectly in 12 minutes. My family loved these. However, I plan to make one change in the future: As a matter of personal taste, I find the dough almost too eggy. I doubled the recipe; therefore I used 4 yolks--next time I'll try 3. I plan to make these often, always doubling the recipe and freezing 1/2 of the dough for future use.

Made these today and they are going to be a part of my life forever! :-) Loved them. I took the advice of one of the reviewers and added 1/4 tsp salt and  2 tsp. vanilla. I used 1/3 tsp of seedless Strawberry Jam in each cookie. This recipe only yielded 24 cookies for me.

I made some changes to this but it came out outstanding! Here are my changes:

Added about 1/2tsp baking powder, 1 tsp almond extract and 1 tsp vanilla. Also a pinch of salt.

added 4 egg yolks instead of 2. I thought I was doubling but didn't double the rest of the ingredients. lol oops :p But they came out awesome so it worked out.

I used raspberry jam in half and apricot in the other and sprinkled them with powdered sugar while they were hot out of the oven. Baked for 8 minutes and they were perfect. 

I did use a 1 inch cookie scoop and press the middle with a round measuring spoon to get a really uniform shaped cookie.

Everyone loved them, they are buttery and melt in your mouth yummy :)

Make these every year for Xmas. My husband is originally from England where he says they're called jammy dodgers. I like to use apricot jam bc of the tartness, but strawberry & raspberry works too. I've even tried it with orange marmalade.

I tried it last weekend. I used regular salted butter, AND I added about 1/8 tsp of salt and two tsp of vanilla extract. I also substituted the 2 egg yolks with one whole egg. (I went by the suggestion of one lady who stated that the recipe needed a boost for flavor. Since I was using salted butter, I used less salt than what she suggested (1/4 tsp). They are easy to make, and they are delicious. I used a small #48 scoop to scoop out the dough onto the sheetpans.  I did dip my thumb in flour to lightly coat it before making a nice deep imprint in each cookie. It was much easier that way, and less sticky. I used homemade jelly for these cookies, which makes them extra special in our family. This is the kind of cookie that anyone would enjoy. Kids from ages 3 to 99  will LOVE these cookies!

Yummy cookies! i got addicted from the first bite. everyone liked them, and they ran out within a day. The only thing that prevents me from giving this recipe 5 stars was that the cookies were pretty bland, and tasted much better with vanilla extract and salt. Also, a few got runny and the jam totally slid out. other than that, these were great. Thanks!

Not too bad. They didn't have much flavor, even with some salt and vanilla. These are perfect for kids.

A good recipe and very versatile. I suggest adding 1/4 tsp salt and 2 tsp vanilla extract to add flavor to the cookie dough. Instead of using 2 yolks, try using 1 whole egg. You can also reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup, or use a sugar substitute, as I did. I made 2 layer square cookies with heart shapes in the middle for the filling, great for a gift or special occasion. You can try different toppings aswell: chopped nuts, powdered sugar, white and/ or dark choclate decorations, just about anything you can think of. I will definetly be using this recipe in the future as it is so quick, easy and really good.

My husband loves the sugar free version:
1/2 cup Splenda instead of 1/2 cup sugar.   I add 1 tsp Vanilla extract & 1/4 cup water since the Splenda is drier than sugar.   I use my mini tart pan then fill with sugar free, seedless blackberry jam.

Awesome Cookie!  I added about 1 1/2 tsp Vanilla, and increased the sugar 3/4 cup.  I used strawberry jam and my family loved them!  Thanks MKHG for sharing this recipe!

I made five batches of these cookies this Christmas season, and every one of them came out terrific! I used my marionberry jam, and my hot jalapeno jam that I made last summer. The jalapeno was by far the best! The buttery cookie with that hot jam were made to go together! I ran a jar of the jam through my food mill to remove seeds and flesh, added more green food coloring, and they were as pretty as they were yummy! Thank you for posting this great recipe!

I made these this past Christmas season and they were a big hit every where I took them I used homemade jam from the summer before which in my opinion is even better than store bought. I have already had requests to make them again!

These cookies were GREAT, and everybody loved them. I'm not very experienced in baking but they were very easy to make. I made five flavours (I used five different jams); blackberry, raspberry, apricot, strawberry, and fig. I will definitely make them again! :D

YES!! these are soooooo good and so easy to make!! and not a whole lot of ingredients, I did add 1 tsp vanilla after reading the reviews, that was it!! I also shook them in powdered sugar, and used Apricot/pineapple preserves and strawberry jam, but whatever you like will work! they are amazing!

These cookies are very good and easy to make.  As recommended, I did let the dough sit in the refrigerator about 15 minutes before forming into balls.  I rolled half in chopped almonds before making the intention (I used my thumb) and filled with apricot preserves.  The other half I filled with three berry jelly.  After they were cooled, I dusted those with powdered sugar.  Nobody preferred one over the other - both got favorable reviews.  I will make these again as they are fun to experiment with.

The cook was ok I guess, nothing really to write home about but good none the less. I did was other reviewers suggested and added a 1/4 tsp salt, however I only added 1/4 tsp and I added some orange zest. To be honest I didn't measure it, just grated it in before I creamed the butter/suger/egg mixture, also added the salt then too, but it couldn't have been more than maybe 1 tsp maybe 1 1/2. It ended up with a citrus taste, and I could smell it as I was shaping the dough, I also used pineapple jam, I find that the compliment each other nicely.

The texture of these cookies were great, but I agree with other reviews that a little salt and vanilla or citrus extract would probably make these much better.  Will definately make again- they were very good cookies!

Great butter cookie! I filled mine with nutella (after baking of course!) and topped with a vanilla glaze! Delicious! They held their shape perfectly during baking. I only refrigerated the dough for 10 min, but I used real butter and it was still slightly cold.I made the hole in the center with a chapstick lid as others suggested and I also added the 2tsp of vanilla and 1/4 tsp salt as other reviewers suggested. Baked for 9 min at 370. I have also tried this with a lemon curd filling added after baking and they are wonderful too!!

These are one of my favorite cookies! I normally don't like fruit preserves, but for some reason I love how it tastes with this cookie. I have no problems with this recipe itself. My only suggestion is to double the recipe! These cookies are always gone so quickly!

These are unbelievably simple and delicious!  I used my home-made cherry/rhubarb jam and WOW! were they good. 
Next time I think I will add a little bit of vanilla though and make a double batch.  This batch, although it says it yields 36, only made 26 very small cookies.  Otherwise - I highly recommend this recipe.  :)

These cookies went over very well, but the cookie itself didn't have much flavor. Will add vanilla extract to the dough the next time around.

Great cookies. I dipped the topside in powdered sugar while still a little warm (it sticks better). Also, use a nice thick preserve, not a jam or jelly. Makes a big difference, won't be runny and will give the cookie MUCH more flavor.

I would of liked to give this cookie recipe 5 stars, however the cookie itself was bland tasting. They came out very pretty with the jam. Next time I make this I will be adding more butter and a little more sugar.

After reading the other reviews, I did add a pinch of salt and vanilla to the dough itself. I also used a zip-lock bag to pipe the jam in. I used apricot and strawberry jam. Yummy!

From other reviewers, I added 1/2 tsp salt, 2/3 c sugar, 1 whole egg, 1 tsp almond extract. Delicious. To stop spreading, I refrigerated them before rolling out and then also before cooking. I made a double batch and rolled some balls in shredded coconut (without making thumbprint), which looked and tasted wonderful; for the thumbprints I rolled some in sanding sugar, some in crushed pistachios and some dusted with icing sugar when warm. I also made some into Linzer cookies (rolled out dough, cut out crinkle rounds, cut the centres out 1/2 of the rounds, baked them, sprinkle with icing sugar, then spread jam on the whole cookie an top with the centreless cookie;  these were beautiful but fussy to make and require alot of refrigerating to get a crisp edge. This morning I will be making some rolled in maple sugar and some filled with nutella. This is a great base recipe.

I made this with Strawberry Perserves. I also added 1/4 tsp of salt and 2 tsp of vanilla extract to the cookie dough. These turned out awesome!

excellent! I rolled mine in chopped pecans and filled with blueberry preserves. Dusted with powdered sugar for a nice sweet note to accent the shortbread. Lovely!

This recipe provides a good base for butter cookies, but not too much flavor.  The first batch, made by following the recipe as written, was very bland but had the right consistency.  The dough was perfect!  The second batch was made by doubling the sugar to 1 cup, using just over 1 cup of flour and adding 1 teaspoon of almond extract.  Any extract will work really, but the almond is my favorite.  After the changes it was perfect (in my humble opinion).  Thanks for the base recipe, though.  I really didn't know where to start.

i love these cookies, they are so fast and easy to make at a moments notice and with ingredients that are always on hand. i also add almond extract to the cookie and use with raspberry jam. also my mom used to make these and she'd drizzle a mixture of lemon juice and powdered sugar over them after baking. really livens it up!

I don't understand what went wrong. I meticulously weighed all my ingredients and noted that the dough seemed really wet so I chilled it for at least one hour. I was able to scoop it out but it was terribly sticky when I tried to make an indent. This wasn't going to work unless I added more flour so I did that. I had to increase the flour from 220g to 300g before it finally could be rolled into proper balls. Once baked it didn't taste good nor had a good texture at all. I am envious of all of you who had good results. I noticed a few other people had the same problem as I did - maybe it's the kind of butter we used that made the dough so wet... ? Who knows.. :(

mmmmmm!  these were great.  I have discovered a delicious triple berry jam (blueberry/raspberry/blackberry) that I LOVE, so I knew I had to use it for these.  I used SALTED butter,  and I also added 2 teaspoons of vanilla to the dough.  I also sifted the flour, and it made the cookies so light and tender.  these are SO good!  truly the perfect cookie.  rich and buttery!  I think they would be great with a little melted chocolate drizzled over the top, or some basic powdered sugar icing drizzled over the top.

I followed this recipe exact, only adding 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract. I did chill the dough, that is VERY necessary. Otherwise, you'll have spreading like whoa. I found the dough was a little hard to work with after chilling, but the results were good. I used my #40 scoop to make the cookie balls which only yielded me 18 cookies. I pressed a divot into the cookies with my tsp. and used the 1/2 tsp. to measure out the jam. Worked out great. 350* for ten minutes was spot on. Great tasting cookie, just wish that I'd figured out how many cookies I'd get out of the recipe. I would have doubled it. EDITED: These cookies are gone, baby, gone. Husband ate darn near all 18 in a couple hours.

Wonderful!  Great flavor and texture.  I followed the recipe exactly and the flavor and texture was just right.  Next time I will double the batch.  These were so good that I don't think I'll wait until next Christmas to make them again.

I made as written.  Really buttery and good.   I baked them an extra minute.  I made my holes with a wooden spoon end, but next time, I think I want to make them the tiniest bit larger for more filling...but that's my thing...not a problem with the recipe.  I will definitely make these again.  They went in my Christmas baskets.

I followed the recipe exactly and used apricot, strawberry, and raspberry preserves.  I only got 24 cookies, despite making the balls 1" thick.  The cookies were very soft when taking them out of the oven, but firmed up as the cooled and were very good.

these were easy i did make adjustments per some reviews. I added 1/4 tsp salt and 1tsp vanilla. Also be careful mine burnt in 8 mins. made another batch and lowered temp to 350 for 8 mins. no problems with having to chill dough and or it swimming in butter. maybe someone put 3/4 pound in instead of 3/4 cup

I agree with other reviewers, the dough is very crumbly. I doubled the batch and made these changes I added 1/4 cup sour cream, 1 tsp salt & cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and increased the sugar to 1 and 1/4 cups.

This is one of my favorite recipes!!  I have made these for 2 years now and everyone wants the recipe!  Next year I am going to try something new with this recipe.  I am going to add orange juice concentrate to the dough.  Instead of jam, I am going to put on a Hersey Kiss. I want to make an orange/ chocolate cookie.  I think that this dough would be great for it!

I actually want to give this 4 1/2 stars.  I made 1/2 the batch with blackberry jam, and the other half with strawberry jam.  The presentation of the cookies on the plates is very pretty and impressive. It looks like you spent all day baking, when, in fact, the recipe is simple, and easy to follow.  I liked the taste of the final result cookie, but didn't love it.  I would have preferred a more buttery flavor to the cookie. I found the cookie a tiny bit bland, but the jelly helps make up for it. My guests and kids loved the cookies, and I certainly ate my share, but I was hoping for more of a butter cookie.

I took these into work and they were gone so fast I never had a chance to eat any of them. I kept getting stopped in the hallway  by coworkers about the amazing cookies on the blue plate. One thing to remember is to pull them out even if they look half baked. I found getting the jam in was no big deal, just a few spoons and it was  cinch. Delicious cookies, bound to give you rave reviews.

Wonderful cookies.  I used black raspberry jam and dusted with powdered sugar.  Next time I'll add a touch more flour so they hold their shape a bit better.

Great recipe. You definately want to make sure that the dough is well refrigerated or else they will spread out too much. I suggest rolling out the balls and refrigerating over night. I made one batch with jam and the other one I left the holes empty and then put hershey kisses in them when they came out of the oven. My boyfriend loves these!

MELT IN YOUR MOUTH DELICIOSO!! I made these cookies just as the recipe called for. I did refridgerate the dough while the oven was preheating and then rolled them into balls and placed them on the cookie sheet. I noticed that it did help to wet your thumb before indenting the cookies so it would make a better place for the filling. I used raspberry preserves. I baked them for just 8 minutes and then dusted them with powdered sugar while they were still warm! These were a huge hit with my husband and my two small children!! Thanks for the recipe!

I make this recipe each year for Christmas and it is always one of the prettiest on the tray. I have tried them with several different preserves and it is always yummy. Raspberry, strawberry and blueberry were the best. I am always sure to get the seedless preserves and NEVER jelly. I found out the hard way a few years back that the jelly will melt and run out of the cookies.

Thank you for such a simple, delicious recipe!!  After struggling with "Raspberry Almond Shortbread Thumbprints," this recipe saved my sanity.  I made it exactly as written, except for using one whole egg instead of 2 yolks.  To make the thumbprint, I used the end of a marker (dip it in flour, make a thumbprint, repeat) and they were so perfect and cute.  I drizzled mine with melted white chocolate after cooling.  I did like the flavor of the Raspberry Almond Shortbread Thumbprints better, so next time I'm just going to add almond extract to these.  Thank you!!!

I am a cookie person, and these are the best cookies I ever had. I altered the recipe very slightly only by adding a 1/2 tsp of almond extract. I used Smuckers strawberry jam....

PERFECT melt-in-your-mouth cookies!

This is my new favorite cookie.  I used strawberry preserves and they tasted great.  These are so easy to make and they aren't overly sweet.  I followed the recipe exactly.

Easy and delicious - but here's a tip: these are better the next day! Straight out of the oven, they were very buttery - by the next day, the cookie had firmed up slightly and was absolutely wonderful! I used other reviewer's tips and added a pinch of salt and a teaspoon of vanilla to the cookie dough. I also piped the jam through a plastic baggie - great idea! I will definitely make these again.

These are awesome! The only thing I added was a tsp. of almond extract. I filled with raspberry and apricot Solo filling. YUM! I would suggest doubling the recipe because I only got 2 dozen out of the first batch, maybe mine were a little too big but that's okay because I know they are going to go over big, especially with the guys in the family who love the jam filled cookies. GREAT RECIPE!!!!!!!!!

Another great recipe from All recipes...  As suggested by other members, I added a teaspoon of vanilla and a 1/2 tsp of salt (if using unsalted butter) and rolled the cookie in sugar before baking.  Once the cookies came out, I dusted them with powdered sugar..very pretty.  I used three kinds of preserves, strawberry, pineapple and seedless boysenberry...yum!  There are so many different types of preserves out there, especially this time of year.  This cookie is very light and isn't meant to be too sweet...grab a cup of tea and enjoy.  I will be making these for gifts this year...a great cookie.  Thanks Missi

The perfect thumbprint cookie!!! The cookie is buttery and the jam adds the sweetness. So easy to make too! Thre was a great suggestion of using a little baggie for the jam and cutting off the tip of the bag to squeeze the jam onto the cookie - worked perfectly!

Good and really easy to make. I've made them twice and the second time I added a bit of salt, vanilla extract, and ground cardamom to the dough. I enjoyed the fuller flavor, but they are also good "as written." Taste best fresh out of the oven.

We added 1/2 tsp. vanilla and a dash of salt for flavor and really liked them. We experimented with different jams - raspberry was the the definite favorite. We will make these again and again. Next time we'll try adding almond extract to the dough.

nahhh, this is a nice looking cookie, but it lacks flavor.  if i made them again i would add vanilla.  perhaps this would help the ho-humm plain flavor we all experienced.  anyways, i will probably not make these again.  sorry~

These were not what I had hoped they would be.  They are lacking in flavor - could definitely used salt and vanilla in the recipe.  Just a flavorless cookie with a waste of good homemade jam!

GREAT cookie recipe. I've made this every thanksgiving, xmas and everything that has a reason for cookies. I usually put them in cookie tins and give them as a "thanks for comming" @ parties! This cookie is so soft and melts in your mouth. I have tried this with many jams and preserves and I have found that my favorite is still the classic strawberry jam. The pale cookie with the bright red center is such a treat to the eyes (especially for xmas)!

Very nice buttery cookies.  Not too sweet, just the right buttery flavor.  Be sure to watch the cookies and take them out when the bottoms are golden...I had to leave mine in a little longer than 10 minutes.

I decided to add this one to my Christmas baking list this year...I had printed it out last year and never got so far as to make it!  Anyway, just made these yesterday, followed the recipe exactly.  I used both strawberry and peach jam in the centres, using a tiny spoon that I have for entertaining (chutneys, condiments, etc).  It worked perfectly.  I found I did need to refrigerate the dough for 1/2 hour or so as it was crumbly...better after that, but will try again as I think I can get the consistency even better.  I didn't get the 36 as noted, only got 27 and they did need a longer baking time in my oven - maybe because I only got 27 (about 15 mins total)!!  Hubby and I loved them...need to freeze them now so they don't disappear by Christmas!!!

These were so easy and fun to make!  My 4 year old helped.  We used a jar of peach preserves from a Harry and David's gift basket that probably would have gone unused otherwise.  I used the baggie tip and it was brilliant.

These are fabulous! I've made them at least a dozen times now, and they've turned out perfectly each time (and I never refrigerate my dough). They're best with a fruit preserve or very fruity jam, but the cookie is so good alone, it's easy to put something different in the middle to make it festive. I made them with half a green maraschino in the centre for St. Patrick's Day (and got rave reviews), and I'm going to make them for Easter with some festive-coloured icing sugar sprinkled on top. You will not be disappointed with these easy-to-make and delicious cookies!

Outstanding. Nice texture and buttery sweet taste. I prefer these rolled in sugar before baking. They are also better with a tart jam, such as blackberry or raspberry. This helps to cut the sweetness some and creates the perfect marriage between sweet and tart.

Wow!  Delicious!  This is what I've been looking for in a thumbprint.  They're nice and golden, and best of all they're still a bit soft and chewy once they cool, instead of total crumbly shortbread.  Also, they don't really expand too much and spill filling.

I love these cookies. The batter was of perfect consistency. I used seedless raspberry jam for the filling. I used a syringe medicine dispenser to fill the cookie centers. I will be adding these to my holiday line up each year, as well as putting them on my summer party platters. Thanks so much!!

Who knew that cookies this easy with only 5 ingredients could be this good! Printed this off the morning of a cookie baking/swap party. I put the jam in a baggie and cut off the corner. The kids loved making the indentions with their thumbs and squirting the jam in!  I recieved an e-mail from one woman who took them to work. Her co-workers all gobbled them up and requested the recipe. I will be making these a lot.

Very tasty and easy.
I did add vanilla to the dough . . I add vanilla to almost all my baked goods.  I used seedless raspberry jam and took the advide of another poster and put it in a plastic bag and snipped the end off and it worked great.
Can't wait to try this with lemon curd. Yummy!!!!

This is the first recipe I made with my brand new (gas) stove.  I just had to try it. I made them with home made jam three different flavors and they came out fluffy and light as a cloud.  I will add these to my file for the future.
Thank you

It was really nice to have such an easy cookie recipe! Everyone from my work thought that I bought them from the store! Watch the cookie bottoms like a hawk so they don't overbrown and don't overfill the cookies because then they'll overflow and look ugly.

These are some of the best cookies I have ever made. I followed the recipe exactly and used orange marmalade and strawberry jam. I did make the dough balls slightly less than one inch, and the cookies did not enlarge or spread out when baking. The cookies were buttery with the perfect texture. I have made them for several events, and they always receive rave reviews.

I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfectly.  I rolled them into balls that were about 3/4" and filled them with about 1/4 tsp of strawberry preserves.  I sifted some powdered sugar on them and they were absolutely adorable.  And then I tasted them...Bliss!  They are so buttery and not too sweet.  They're in my recipe box until the internet becomes obsolete.

Delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and actually came out with a little over 4 dozen cookies (a little on the smaller side).

I refrigerated the dough for about 10 minutes before rolling. I found that if the dough was TOO cold, it was more apt to crack when you indented for the jam. For that purpose, I found its best to work with room temp dough, and I used my 1/2 tsp measure to make the indentation. I floured the back of the spoon lightly each time to prevent it from sticking. 

As other reviewers said, they really don't brown up. 

I also sprinkled powedered sugar over the tops. Great recipe!! I WILL make these again.

A simple recipe that is easy to make.  Very yummy and the kids enjoyed putting their thumbprint in the cookies to make a well for the jam. I like the fact that it only has 5 ingredients and they are ones that most people have in their frig/pantry. Thanks for the yummy recipe!

Oh my... these are so good, and easy to make.  I used Raspberry Jam, but I can't imagine a jam which wouldn't taste good on these.  They are so buttery yet light, very much like a shortbread.  One tip- I used a spoon from my daughter's tea set to spoon the jam in the cookies.  Next time I think I might sprinkle a little sugar on top after they cook.  I'm sure they would be good with most any drizzling on top, such as chocolate or caramel.  Very versitile, and they look so nice.  Everyone will be impressed, but they are so easy to make.  Thanks so much!

Also, because my hubby is lactose intolerant, I used all natural margarine instead of butter.  As another review stated, they didn't look done when indeed they were.

These were amazingly simple and good.  Buttery and flaky.  I even really screwed up and was making these and trying to make dinner at the same time and read recipe wrong and baked for 15 minutes (but was saved because oven was also on wrong too low temp) and they still turned out good!  Easiest cookie recipe ever (prep time for me was 5-10 minutes) and will definitely make again and try to follow the recipe correctly and be even better.

Good cookies - I added a little almond extract to the cookie dough and that added to the flavor.  The preserves kept running out of the cookies and burning on the cookie sheet. I'm not sure how I could have avoided that without making the cookies bigger.  ETA:  Made them again this year and followed other people's hints - used a sandwich bag to pipe the filling in and made the cookies a bit bigger.  I got less cookies out of the deal, but they're much prettier.  :)

These were easy to make, look pretty on the plate, and are very tasty. I used lemon curd as the filling for half the batch, and strawberry jam for the other half.

I added half a teaspoon of vanilla extract, which gave them a nice flavor.

I made these for a holiday party, and they were definitely well received. They were delicious and very, very easy to make! I followed a few of the other tips, using 1 whole egg (vs. 2 eggs whites), added 1/4 tsp salt, and experimented with 1 tsp maple syrup for a little added flavor. I used the back of a 1/2 tsp to poke a perfect (and deeper) circle in the middle, which helped keep the jam in nicely. After filling with jam, I put the sheets of cookies into the freezer for about 20 minutes before placing into the oven- this way they did not flatten while cooking.  I will certainly make again, thank you for this recipe.

Started getting compliments after some substitutions.   I use 1/2 cup almond flour, 3/4 cup whole wheat flour, with the remainder 1/2 cup being all purpose.  Also roll balls in finely crushed walnuts before depression for jam is made.    Adds a great nutty flavor.

Lovely cookies! I followed the tweaks suggested by Maria Isa and added salt and vanilla and they came out great although I'm a very novice baker!! Will try and add a little more jam next time.

Other posts said the cookie was a bit bland. I divided the sugar in half. I used half white and half brown sugar. The cookie tasted great. I also used another recommendation of putting the jam in a baggie to fill the cookies.. Worked great. I did roll mine bigger than the 1" that is called for, so I only got about 20 cookies.. I will be doubling everything the next time I make these yummy cookies..

ADDING VANILLA EXTRACT IS A MUST! The cookie is very very boring without it. I didn't add the exact amount of flour, I ended up adding a bit more. Also be careful when doing the imprints. Imprints too deep will cause the cookie to break and jam will go everywhere. Other than that, I LOVE this recipe. Ate six cookies in one sitting. Not ashamed.

I used one whole egg instead of the 2 yolks and added a tsp of vanilla extract to this recipe. I refrigerated the dough for about 15-20 minutes before I made them into balls. I used raspberry all fruit preserves. 

The good: perfectly shaped cookie.  I did not have any trouble with "leaking" jam.  I made my imprints with my thumb and used a sandwich baggie with a tiny hole sniped in the corner to fill each well. The cookies held up and they were cooked in 10 minutes.  No cracks - a perfectly round cookie.

The not so good:  the cookie itself is bland, even with the vanilla extract. I sprinkled some powdered sugar on each cookie while still warm to add a little more sweetness.

Delicious! I've always thought these cookies were so tasty, but this year I finally figured out how to make them look beautiful, too. The butter must be left out at least an hour. After making the dough, chill at least 30 mins. Finally, work the dough a bit after taking out if the fridge. You can tell the dough is ready when you are rolling balls with no cracks. So happy I finally cracked the code! Now beautiful presentation and wonderfully delicious!

Loved it because it was a sweet and buttery shortbread type cookies with yummy strawberry jam. i used whipped butter and it still tasted great. the egg whites i'll use for something else. the dough was too soft tho so i rolled it up and put it in the freezer for 15 min. maybe try with salt and vanilla next time? make sure it is completely cooled before moving it off the pan/tray. jam slides off easily and makes a mess. also, don't eat hot 375 degree dough, especially if it smells good: once you start, you can't stop. both burns and cookies and are good with milk.

Just tried this recipe last Friday for my kids' playtime with friends. The instruction is so easy. I just added a little bit of salt, and the result was fantastic. My first new recipe for the year came out to be a success. Me and my son made some more for today.

Really delicious and not crumbly, but the jam is boiling hot so let cookies cool. I added a tiny bit of salt, vanilla and almond oil to the recipe.

AWESOME, buttery goodness!! So good my husband and I could have eaten the whole batch! Doubled the recipe and made 36 medium sized cookies. Added the salt and vanilla which is a must imo. Made 12 apricot, 12 seedless raspberry and 12 blueberry. These did have to cook about 15 minutes but that could be my oven. I used a 1/4 tsp round measuring spoon to make the indent. I kept a careful watch and checked every 5 minutes and also switched the sheets around half way through. When they are done they will be pale on the top and lightly browned on the bottom. Make these and you will not be disappointed!

I make these on occasion, and they always go over well.  A couple of tips: Make sure you buy a seedless jam.  Seeds in the middle of your cookies are unappealing.  All Fruit seedless preserves work well.  Second, if you have a spherical measuring spoon without a lip, these work perfectly both for making an impression in the cookies and for getting the jam into the center neatly.

It needs something  to spice it up bring it to life. Anything sweet and tasy! Jam portion is out I used my measuring scoop to make finger holes and used only 1/8 to 1/2 of jam to fill. Only made 24 cookies. Only reason I'm giving 3stars is because my husband said their good with the jam and cooked perfect and yes bland but like a shortbread cookie.

My husband's grandmother made these cookies every Christmas.  She had the recipe from Southern living.  I have looked for it many years after it was lost.  So excited to see this.  She always did half w jam and half of them w a pecan on top.  Thanks for helping me bring back a family tradition

Very simple and easy recipe to whip up quickly. I tried mine with various fruit extracts, which I recomend. I also rolled my dough in sugar before adding the jam and baking for a little extra flavor.

Incredible recipe but only tried with a recommended modification. Instead of 2 egg yolks, I I used 1 egg.  I added 1/2 tsp salt and 2 tsp vanilla extract. I baked for 8 mins.  Amazing!!! This is a keeper and allows you to be creative by filling with almost whatever you want. I only had strawberry spread on hand and it was delicious but will definitely be trying it with seedless blackberry and raspberry preserves/jam/spread. I may also try a lemon mixture and sprinkling with sifted powdered sugar.

These are delicious and very easy to make. I did adjust the dough a bit after reading a few reviews. I used one whole egg as opposed to the two egg yolks and added the following to the dough: 1/4 tsp salt, 2 tsp Vanilla extract, and a 1/2 tsp of Almond Extract. Thanks for posting this recipe!

Huge hit at our house! I followed a fellow reviewers advice and used 1 egg instead of the yolks and added 2 teaspoons of vanilla. I also made some icing (1 1/4 cup of powdered sugar and 2 tablespoons of milk) that I ran over the cookies that I filled with raspberry preserves and lemon curd. Couldn't keep them on the plate! New Christmas cookie tradition!

These were absolutely delightful cookies.  I only made 1 minor change after reading other reviews that the dough was bland.  I added 1/4 tsp almond extract to the dough.  Other than that I made it exactly how the recipe stated and they were super tasty!  Great recipe.

My 6 year old daughter and I made these together. We added 2 tsps of vanilla and used the ziploc bag method for the jam like other reviewers suggested.  Very sweet!  We had never tried cookies with strawberry jam before but we loved them!

The recipe as is is OK. I agree that the flavor is somewhat bland. I am going to try another batch with vanilla extract, salt and possibly with shortening added to the butter.

These turned out to be one of the best thumbprint cookies I have ever had. Freshly baked, I thought they were a wee bit crumbly, but the next day taken to a church event, they firmed up and were perfect. I used red current jelly, which gave a lovely tart contrast.

They are tasty cookies, but I found the dough a bit dry to work with.  I added half of an egg white to help keep the mix together.

I am not a fan of jam but I did like the buter flavor of the cookie.  I used apricot and raspberry preserves and they were a hit with friends and family.

Great recipe, so easy to make and delicious! I did add 1tsp of vanilla and a dash of salt, also I did one full egg rather than two egg yolks for simplicity, worked great.  I must have made mine smaller because I got 46 bite size cookies out of this, some with raspberry all fruit jam and some with homemade peach jam - both were fantastic.  Planning to make for a party in a few weeks, but I'll need to hide them from the husband and kids or they'll be gone again for sure. This batch didn't last two days in our house!

These cookies turned out awesome! I took advise from one of the reviewers and added 1/4 tsp salt and 1 tsp vanilla essence. I used rasberry and apricot preserves. These needed more than 10 min to bake.  This is definitely a keeper and my favourite recipe for sugar butter cookies. Thanks for the recipe. I made about 38 cookies.

Nice and Easy cookie recipe. I used Splenda Blend and Simply Fruit to make them more diabetic friendly. I also had to add a dash of vanilla.

What a grand little cookie!  This recipe is a keeper. I followed the recipe exactly except I rolled the dough in granulated sugar (because that's how I love butter cookies). I made these for Valentines and instead of a thumbprint, I used my pinkie to make a heart shape in the center. I filled the center to just below the brim with jam and had no bubbling over issues. Side note: I did try the powdered sugar sprinkle and it did not melt into the cookie so since it wasn't pretty darn if I didn't have to eat it ;) I made 2 batches, one with 1/4 Tsp vanilla, one without. With vanilla it is sweeter like a sugar cookie, without the vanilla it has a more authentic butter cookie taste.

We've had the same recipe in our family for many years too, except ours calls for 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract.  It came from my grandmother and, back in her day, recipes like this one were only made for the holidays because butter, sugar and jam were so expensive.  She made her own jam, which made these cookies even better.
We make two variations:
1) For added flavor and a bit of crunch, beat one of the leftover egg whites and dip the top half of the dough balls into it, then in finely chopped pecans.  Proceed by making the indentation, filling with jam and baking like in the original recipe.
2) You can make elegant jam tartlets by using a mini muffin pan. Drop in enough dough to fill each muffin cup about halfway, then use a bottle cap or other similar instrument to make the depressions, pressing the dough up the sides.  Be careful not to make the bottoms too thin.  You want the dough to look like a crust.  Remove any excess dough by scraping it away with a spatula, then fill and bake as in the original recipe.  These will hold a little more jam and the dough will brown evenly on the sides and bottom.  After the tart cookies are almost cooled, carefully turn them out onto a cookie sheet that's been covered with a thick, even layer of powdered sugar to coat the tops.
I usually make a double recipe.  I make enough tart cookies to fill one mini muffin tin and make the rest on a cookie sheet with the pecan topping.  So good!

These were delicious.  I can eat up a whole tray.  I added vanilla to the recipe.  I like the smell  of vanilla when baking.  The only mistake I made was making the cookies to large.  Other than that it was an excellent cookie.

I added a 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract as per the "Most Helpful Critical Review" suggestion.    I looked at other recipes that were similar to this and most of them were calling for almond or vanilla extract.  I went with almond extract figuring that it would work well with raspberry, apricot, or strawberry jam.  The cookies are delicious!  I only had one volcano cookie where the jam broke loose from its cookie containment.  A friend of mine just suggested lemon extract to go with the raspberry but I'll only try that if I can find pure lemon extract.  There is nothing worse than that fake lemon taste.  I'd also cut it down to 1/4 teaspoon or even less since lemon tends to be a stronger flavor.  Either way, these are quite delish!  I suppose you could even put lemon curd in the center instead of jam.  Endless possibility!  I used the rounded handle end of my spatula to make the indent for the jam and piped in the jam with a sandwich bag with the end cut off.  The leftover jam was easily taken care of by simply squeezing it back into the jar.  I'm also considering drizzling chocolate over the tops for a chocolate raspberry cookie or for an orange marmalade dark chocolate drizzled cookie.

These are delicious!  I did make some changes to the recipe....I slightly reduced the white sugar and added some brown sugar.  I, also, used the whole eggs, added vanilla and almond extracts, and added cinnamon to the dough.  The dough was not firm enough to roll into balls.  I was in a rush, so rather than putting it in the fridge, I used a cookie scoop and then, a small spoon dipped in flour to make the well.  It worked perfectly!

I made these with my seven year old son and they were very simple.  Hard to mess up.  Taste great too.  I found cooking time needed to be about 12 minutes before they started to brown.

Love these cookies! I made ten different kinds of cookies to fill gift bags for Christmas and these were one of them. (problem is I ate most of these)!! I used butter crico (for all my cookie recipes) and I think it makes them soft and chewy that way. These especially did well with the crisco and sugar free jam. MMM, MMM Good! Thanks!

These were delicious, easy to make cookies. I added 1/2t of cinnamon and a few grinds of sea salt to the batter. Yum. I used smuckers red raspberry spreadable fruit and used about 1/4t per cookie. As others suggested, I replaced the 2 egg yolks with one whole egg. It took the full 10 min in a gas oven. I'll definitely make these again. Thanks for the recipe!

This is delicious, i followed the recipe exactly and it turned out very tasty, the only thing i did wrong was to over fill with jam with the first batch, when i made the second batch, it was perfect, i baked these for my son's birthday, it was a hit, thanks for a great recipe!

These are my kids new favorite cookies. For the jam I used Tastefully Simple's Rhubarb Strawberry Fruit Spread. Taking another reviewer's advice, I also did the following: used 1 egg instead of 2 yolks; added 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract.

Wonderful.  I also added 2 tsp vanilla and used salted butter instead of adding butter as recommended by another baker and whole eggs instead of egg yolks.  Although I rolled themn into 1" balls, I slightedly flatted them before adding the intentation for the jam.  This worked out great.  Will definately make again, but they were leaving my cooling racks quicker than I could get them out of the oven and I doubled the recipe!

These vanished !! That's all I gotta say.

Well, something else. We have a sports cafe within a University campus, and are VERY picky with what we choose to serve. My husband asked me to bake these for the cafeteria....

and well, it's hard for me to make a recipe without adding my Gaby touch: I added 1 tspn vanilla and 1 tspn almond extract.... YUMMY

A splash of vanilla and a pinch of salt, plus the sprinkle of confectioner's sugar, as other reviewers suggested, and these would easily get five-stars. Terrific little cookies!

I made these today.  They are delicious. Like some others I tweaked it a bit so they would not be "bland" as some reviewers have said.  I added some brown sugar (a handful) and a few dashes of cinnamion.  

I filled them with an assortment of strawberry, blackberry and homemade lime curd.  The lime curd were awesome...but all are good.  As others have said, use good jam this really makes the cookie.  These will be on my Christmas cookie plate every year from now on.

These were great! Quick and easy. I adapted this to be sugar free by subbing Splenda for sugar and Sugar-free preserves for regular. Worked perfectly :-) I did add some vanilla and lemon juice to the dough as Splenda tends to make the dough drier. Cooked for about 14 minutes because when I tested one of the larger cookies it was still a big doughy on the inside.

Very easy to make. Putting jam into a sandwich bag is a great idea. Has anyone tried adding baking soda to the recipe as I find the cookies too hard when cooled.

I love these cookies! I took other reviewers' advice and added a little salt, vanilla extract and almond extract to give the dough more flavor. They are SO easy to make and taste great with many flavors of jam--my favorites are raspberry and blackberry. Thanks for the recipe!

My 1st attempt making cookies n this was it! Easy, nice n tasty. My son was so enjoyed filling d jam. I'm not sure if these cookies are suppose to be bit hard, but it taste yummy. I followed exactly what the recipe asked for, but for sugar I cut into 1/4 cup and also add 2 tsp vanilla extract n pinch of salt as mentioned in one of the reviews, it was good. Will make again but DOUBLE...!

I made these cookies as Christmas presents for our families.  They had to be shipped all over the nation and they shipped well and have been getting rave reviews so far.  I was hesitant to send them out because I made the recipe exactly as written the first time and they were extremely BLAND!  The cookies had no flavor, the texture was blah and even the expensive jam couldn't save them.  I didn't have the heart to trash the cookies right away and glad I gave them a few days to flavor.  They were much better!  The cookies had softened a little and the texture was much more buttery, like a good shortcake should be.  The jam flavor had also permeated the cookies and they were more flavorful.  I  was determined to send out some good thumbprint cookies so I made a second batch with some changes from other reviewers as well as a little cookie common sense. 

I added about 1/4 tsp kosher salt, 1/4 tsp vanilla, and 1/8 tsp orange extract.  I didn't want the orange to get too strong but I'd probably go ahead and add 1/4 tsp next time because it was not even noticeable.  A little cardamon may also be nice in them depending on the flavor of jam used.  

So far I've heard from most of the family and they are giving rave reviews on these cookies.  I wasn't expecting them to be the stand out cookie.  I'd suggest making these cookies a few days ahead of time before you serve them.

Absolutely delicious!  I added almond extract and pecans for a little extra flavor and then filled them with apricot jam.  The idea of putting the jam in a ziplock bag was so helpful!  These cookies are really simple and will be gone in a flash!  I also made them with raspberry jam and took the advice of others who had coated them with powdered sugar.  Very pretty and yummy!  Thanks for the recipe and thanks to the reviewers for the helpful hints!

Really simple and yummy cookie recipe. Not many ingrediantes either, which is always a plus! Found that 8 and a 1/2 mins was the perfect time to get them that golden brown on bottom. They're delish with peach jam.

Watch the time, I burned the first batch at 370F, maybe lower the temperature even more.  Delicious and fast.  The kids helped with rolling the dough into balls.

Very good - I may have made them too big because they didn't make nearly as many as the recipe said they would.  I will definitely double the batch next time I make them.  My kids ate them right up, and they were super-quick to throw together.

Used strawberry, apricot, and blueberry preserves and added powdered sugar on top while still hot.  Yum!

This is our new go to for cookies.  So easy and my kids love making them.  Even my chocoholic brother-in-law skipped the choco chip cookies for these.  We used homemade blackberry jam and I added a little salt to the dough.

I really love this quick and easy recipe.It's great because everthing needed in this recipe are kitchen staples. My cookies came out looking perfect and the texture was amazing. Just melted in your mouth. I can see myself making these over and over again. The only con is that this recipe doesn't make enough and the cookies are gone before they even have a chance to cool completely.

These are fabulous! Made them for my grandmother, a baking connoisseur with 80 years of experience on her,  and she loved them so much she asked for the recipe.  Now that's a compliment! All this notwithstanding the fact that I am a lousy baker! Thank you MKHG!

Love how simple & quick these cookies are! I also only used 1 regular egg and added a little salt to the mix. I added these to my cookie tins for Christmas 2010. Big hit! :)

A classic butter shortbread jam cookie.  Don't write a review for a shortbread cookie saying the dough is bland.  Butter/shortbread cookies are all about the ingredients and the subtle nuance of the flavors.  Buy the BEST butter, use quality fresh flour, and farm eggs to really make the recipe sing.  We use Irish butter for a richness.  In this case using a homemade low sugar jam will highlight the richness of the butter cookie.

These cookies were light and tasty.  The cookie itself is a bit bland but the jam makes up for it.  I would make these again.

I love these cookies! We use homemade raspberry jam for the filling and I use my forefinger to make the hole. We also keep the egg whites and roll the dough balls in the egg mixture before placing them on the cookie sheet to bake.

This was a huge hit in my house. I followed the recipe exactly except I added a tsp of vanilla to give the dough a little more flavor. I used blackberry preserves for the fruit and it was delicious! My only complaint was that this recipe made nowhere near the amount of cookies it said it would.

I made two batches of these today and they came out great!   Doubling the recipe yielded me 74 cookies.  I filled some with jam and some with maraschino cherries.  I also baked them at 350 degrees for 14 minutes instead of at 375.  I will definitely be making these every Christmas.

This could be a five star recipe with some simple modifications.  The cookie dough definitely needs more flavor; salt and some almond extract is what I added.  I rolled some of the balls in crushed pecans and filled them with chocolate and they are delicious that way.  Be sure not to over bake them.  They will not retain their buttery crumbly texture if you do.

These are wonderful, easy, cheap to make :)  i did follow others by adding a little more sugar, 1/4 tsp salt, and 1 tsp vanilla:) i also ground up 1 cup of dry roasted peanuts and after rolling into little round balls, i rolled them in the peanut dustings.  they were absolutey delicious. Thank you!

I followed the recipe exactly as listed.  To fill the cookies with the preserves I took a ziploc bag and cut the tip.  I was easily able to pipe the filling into the cookie.  These cookies turned out so good.  They only lasted one day :(     I will be making these again, probably 3 batches, to include in our homemade Christmas gift baskets this year.

The flavor of these cookies was great, but they were really crumbly and kind of hard to eat.  I think maybe I needed more flour.  I'm a novice baker, so it's probably something I did.

I increased the sugar to 2/3 cup, and used 1 whole egg as suggested by other reviewers. I had to refrigerate the dough for a bit before rolling into balls. I rolled half the batter in chopped walnuts for an extra crunch. I also piped the jam into the cookie well using a plastic ziploc bag which made it much easier!

I personally love this recipe except I changed one thing about it. the recipe is better if you add the whole egg instead of just the yolks. it makes the dough softer and easier to shape and just using the egg yolk makes it look more like  powder. But again this is a good recipe I made a bunch for get together and they were all gone in under a minute!

Oh my goodness! I took the advise of another and added the salt, vanilla and used a whole egg...then I doubled the recipe. I rolled the balls but then I them in a mini cupcake pan and used a wooden spoon to make the indentions in the middle. I placed my preserves in plastic wrap and piped it into the holes. I used blackberry on some and orange marmalade on the other half...yum! I even rolled the balls in white sugar before baking on a few...they were great! Use the mini pan...it makes it like little cupcakes filled with goodies!

Awsome!  These cookies were very easy to make.  I took the advice of others by adding a bit of almond extract.  i will definately be making these again.

I used one whole egg instead of 2 egg yolks and added vanilla extract to the dough. Delicious.

Wow, these are so good! The cookie is buttery and crisp, very melt-in-your-mouth! The only suggestion I have is to add some salt about 1/4 teaspoon ( I love a bit of savory and it brings out all the flavors)

I've made this with both butter and with margarine. I actually like the margarine version better. For one thing with margarine the dough comes together easier. You do have to let it sit in the fridge for awhile when using margarine, but I didn't find that to be a big deal. Also use a really good preserve. I used blueberry the first time and they were to die for!

First, let me say that I love the ingredient search feature on this site.  I made a recipe yesterday that left me with 6 egg yolks, but no whites.  This was one of the recipes that matched my search.  I made as written, but added 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract to the dough.  I made some with apricot jam and some with a mixed berry jam.  Both were delicious.  This recipe comes together very quickly with just a few ingredients.  The dough rolled nicely and baked perfectly on my Silpat lined sheet.

I added a pinch of salt and a little vanilla to the dough based on an earlier review. I followed a recommendation to use a baggie for dispensing the jam and it worked really well. I made a little glaze of confect. sugar, lemon oil and milk, did the baggie thing again (just a quick zig zag pattern) and it added a nice layer of flavor. Thanks for the recipe it was very tasty.

This is one of my favorite recipes because its so versatile!  I doubled the recipe and then split it into four batches.  I added ground pistachioes to one batch, chopped maraschino cherries and cherry juice to another, coconut extract to another and then rolled them in coconut, and then the fourth I did the jam and then rolled all in powder sugar when done.  My family and co-workers LOVED them!  Quite honestly their drawback is that you can't stop eating them!!

This cookie is amazingly easy and good! I added like  a pinch of salt and 1 tsp vanilla and used strawberry preserves. I couldn't believe how fast and easy they were to make. Not much clean up which I thought was great. I will definetily be making these often. They are my hubby's childhood favorites. ALso! I got exactly 36 cookies. If you make them 1 in, they should come out to 36!

Very good thumbprint cookies! I really liked the raspberry almond shortbread thumbprints recipe from this site, but felt that they got a little too flat in the oven. I decided to try this one instead, and the addition of egg yolks was perfect! My cookies came out puffy and beautiful, and they tasted great! I added about 1/4 tsp. of almond extract to the dough, and also made the dough into smaller balls. I used the back of a 1/4 tsp. measure (dipped in flour) to make the holes in each cookie, and then filled each with a 1/4 tsp. of jam. A glaze of milk, powdered sugar, and almond extract was perfect when I drizzled it on top of the cooled cookies. These were a big hit...they tasted so yummy! Thanks for sharing...this is my new favorite jam-filled thumbprint recipe!!!

Just got these out of the oven and they are delicious!  The cookie is buttery and compliments the jam perfectly.  I used rasberry preserves and am getting ready to make a second batch with apricot preserves.  I did add a little vanilla to them and also used a baggie to pipe the jam into the thumbprints like another reviewer suggested.  Easy cookies to whip up and wonderful taste!  These will be a part of our annual Christmas cookie spread!

I agree with other writers about adding a littl salt and vanilla flavoring to give it life.  Otherwise, it's great.  I rolled each in crushed walnuts for an added holiday look.  Sorry, I had to take a star off for having to add the salt and vanilla flavoring.  Also, I used my son's infant spoon to fill the cookies and had no over spill of jam.

These came out great!  I've never made a shortbread-type cookie, and this was a great introduction.  I made both strawberry (jam) and blueberry (preserves w/splenda) middles.  I highly suggest you use preserves when making these - the flavor is so much better!

These were delicious and oh so easy to make!  I used cherry jelly and reduced the heat to 350 and baked for 10 minutes instead of 8.  This will definitely become one of our new Christmas cookies this year.

These cookies were easy, but I just expected more.  The jam stayed soft where as I thought it would get firm, kinda gooey maybe.  If that would have happened, they'd have been reviewed better.

I rarely give a recipe 5 stars! I usually compare them to the best I have ever have had, and if it doesn't beat it, it won't get five stars. Excellent cookie, would be perfect for the holidays. I did take some reviewer advice, added some vanilla and I like the rolling them in powdered sugar also. Rolled in fine ground walnuts would be great. Very delicious!!

Add a pinch of salt, 1/4 tsp baking powder to give that nice rise/puff and a teaspoon of vanilla...nice basic butter cookie.  5 Stars!  fill center with ANYTHING you please, i.e. choc chips, choc filling, marachino cherry, almonds...whatever you wish. Took several variations to a party last nite and several folks broke their diets to indulge.

Perfect butter cookies.  I used strawberry jam because it was what I had on hand and they were wonderful.  Dusted with confectioner's sugar once the cookies were cooled. I will be making these again.

The dough for these cookies was so easy to work with and they were delicious!  I made 3 batches to give away as gifts and ended up making another batch just for us (at the request of my husband).  I made the holes with the handle of a thick wooden spoon and used a sandwich bag to pipe the jam in.  The only change I made was to add 1 tsp of vanilla to the dough.  I will be making these every Christmas from now on!  Everyone loved them.

Great recipe!  I replaced to eggs with applesauce (about 1/2 cup instead of egg) since my son has an egg allergy and I increased the amount of butter... then i finished them off after baking with powdered sugar spinkled on!!  Everyone loved then and couldn't even tell that they were egg free!

I make these every Christmas, and my friends and family always love them! I use seedless blackberry preserves, and they taste delicious and look really pretty. No changes needed to the recipe at all!

Great and easy recipe!!! Takes about 5 minutes to make the dough. I followed another raters advice and used the back of a wooden spoon to make the indent, making the process even faster! I add a little salt and vanilla extract for extra flavoring, and bake for an extra 3 minutes making the cookies a little harder (If I bake it for 10 minutes, I find the cookies a little too soft, it breaks apart for me).

Made exactly as written using orange marmalade.  Super yummy and addictive.  We just ate the entire first batch out of the oven!  I got about 30 and there was a lot of jam left over, so you could probably get away with using 1/4 cup.

I used to make these as a kid & this recipe is as good as I remember.  Don't make my mistake, as my fingers are a good deal larger than when I made these as a kid. I made my divits too large and as a result overfilled the jelly on the first batch.  Make little divits & skimp on the jelly & you should be fine.

WOW!  These were loved...thanks so much.  I used another reviewers idea of putting the jam in a sandwich bag and pumping it into the thumbprint.  Worked beautifully.

So simple and so very tasty! I made this with my 3yr old after looking for a simple recipe he could join in with. 

He loved helping mix and form the dough balls then sticking his finger in them all. I would say you don't need that much jam in each but I suppose it's a personal preference.

I will pass this recipe on to all my friends with kids as it's a fun and tasty way to spend an afternoon!

These are basically no-fail, and absurdly delicious.  I had a craving for something with strawberry preserves, and so that's what I used to fill them.  I cut the recipe down to 24 cookies so that it'd accommodate the one stick of butter (1/2 cup) that I had on hand, and although all I had was salted butter, which you're not supposed to use for baking, and I didn't add the extra 1/2 of an egg yolk, these came out absolutely perfectly.  The result was lightly brown, very crisp, buttery, and the little bit of added salt from the butter gave them a little more depth of flavor.  Great, forgiving recipe that you can truly throw together with what you have on hand!

I'm not sure if this was my fault somehow, but following the recipe exactly, I found these to be extremely bland. They were edible when I practically smothered them in jam though :p Mine also spread more than I would have liked, which was irritating. I guess I'm still looking for the perfect jam drop recipe. ;)

It was a solid recipe however the dough tasted too buttery-- I will increase the sugar by 1/4 to 1/2 cup next time. Lemon curd filling was the best tasting but i need to make it thicker next time. apricot jam was good too.

I would rate this a 3.5… they were good, but not amazing. I should have used more jam in the centers. Next time, I would be sure to add a LOT of jam in the thumbprint. My only significant problem with this recipe is that the bake time suggested in the recipe, didn't thoroughly cook the center of the cookies. I rated it three stars because I intend to try again, hopefully next time they will be completely cooked (and thus, I will change my rating to a higher score).

OK, the first time i made these was my first year of marriage and i didn't know exactly how to bake, so i only gave them a 4 and they turned out flat, lol. I made these again and they were perfect!!! I think i had microwaved my butter to soften it last time... which is a no no! This time I left my butter out 2 hours and creamed it really well with the sugar.  I also refrigerated mine 30 min and baked them 14-15 minutes on my pampered chef pan.

Cute and easy cookies. I was able to make these with a toddler hanging anxiously and tenaciously onto my apron strings the whole time. I had absolutely no problems making these and everyone loved them. I used real fruit preserves....fresh blackberry ones! Mmmmmmmm!!

Thes were great. I loved the flavor. I used strawberry and peach jams and they worked out great. I also used 1.4 tsp measuring spoon to make the holes and a baggie to squeeze the jam in like others suggested.

I just added a teaspoon of vanilla extract to this recipe.  These cookies are very tender and buttery.  I found that using the knuckle of my index finger rather than my thumb for the impression was much easier.  Very good.  I used the two leftover egg whites to make divinity, an excellent combination of Christmas treats.

Delicious! I like to roll my dough into balls, place them in eggwash and then in finely chopped walnuts prior to baking. They will stay soft for several days if you are careful no to overcook them!

I feel like a professional baker after using this recipe.  I only got 20 cookies, but I made them too large.  The second sheet I made much smaller.  After trying both sizes, I have to say the smaller you make them the better cause otherwise the cookie-jam ratio is overbearing and makes them too dry.  Now that I know that I will make these tiny cookies often in the future.

I loved them! I thought for sure they'd be dry like most thumbprint cookies are made with just a basic shortbread. I am trying not to eat too many sweets, but these definitely made me give in! :) I used boysenberry jam, since thats all I had...but for the Xmas cookies I will make this year, I want to make it with Strawberry preserves.  I used a baggie with the end snipped for filling the cookies, worked perfect!

Made these cookies tonight and they aren't gonna make it through the night!  Very good and soooo simple to make.  I made them with homemade blackberry preserves and sprinkled powdered sugar on them once they cooled.

A lot like my mom's recipes, just slightly different amounts of the same ingrediants. We make sure to use salted butter, and often instead of jam use a half of a walnut or half a candied cherry in the middle. Yummy...

I accidentally left out a half-cup flour, and I am glad I did-- these turned out great. Two tips for the filling: I used the handle of a wooden spoon to make the hole and the squeezable bottle of "fruit spread" jam to fill. I had planned to make tem at night and take into work the next day but when I woke up they were gone.

I made mine a little too big so it only made 25 but they still looked and tasted wonderful.  I filled half with berry jam and the other half with apricot jam.  I will definately be making these again.

Really good, you don't have to use 2 egg yolks, you can use one whole egg.   Very pretty with different types of jams, these are like a shortbread if you use real butter.  The ingredient amounts are perfect for rolling into a ball.  I also put a bit of vanilla in this recipe.  I put vanilla in everything I bake even if the recipe doesn't call for it, vanilla is a must!!

I was a bit worried about serving these at our weekly family gathering, because most of us are more attracted by chocolate instead of fruit jam desserts. However, I was shocked to see that everyone, not only ate them, but raved about them!! They were awesome, light, melt in your mouth tasty. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I added just a bit of almond extract. I used raspberry jam too, which made it extra delish! Thank you for sharing this great recipe!

These are a great cookie.  I have made with margarine and butter and you get two completely different tastes.  Butter is much richer and my preferred way to make.  Margarine seems to have something missing.  Make small because they do spread out.  I always use my homemade jam which I think helps add to the taste-a good jam.  People always like these.  Thanks for posting.

WOW!!! This is the best Christmas cookie I've ever made. I used gluten free flours which generally leave the cookie dry and crumbly, but this cookie stayed together very nicely. It was full of flavor. I used strawberry jam in the center and I don't think I could have been more pleased. At this rate I will need to make another batch before x-mas because these will be all gone by then.

These are buttery, light and melt in your mouth. Actually, they taste a lot like pie crust to me. However, they were well liked by family members who like shortbread and butter cookies, so I gave them 4 stars. Personally I would rate them a 3. I used homemade crabapple jelly.

These were a big hit at Christmas. I liked the simplicity of the ingredients, and they tasted great! Very tender cookie, not too sweet. Refrigerating the dough really improved the ease of handling. I used a small food scoop to portion the cookies, and the handle of a wooden spoon makes dainty divots to hold the jam. This recipe will stay in the cookie collection for a long time!

Jam Filled Cookies? they are better than jam filled cookies. I impressed my husband by making those for him for  the valentine’s day,  I gave them the heart shape, using the cutter, then I made the well after that, filled it with red jam, no powder sugar as some mentioned, they turned out perfectly, if you think the dough is so soft on you, add one  or two more tablespoons n of flour it won't change the texture.

I added three new recipes to my Christmas gift baking this year. This one was my personal fav. The only change I made was to add 1 tsp. vanilla. I made two batches, one with raspberry jam, and one with blackberry jam. I sampled one after baking & was pleased. However, days later I snuck one from my mom's gift basket, bad I know. Anyways, I could not believe how soft the cookie still was, it was one of the first things I baked for the baskets & it was still sooooo soft! I used a reviewer's idea for squirting the jam from a baggie with a small hole in the corner. Genius! For a nice presentation I dipped the top of the cookies in red & green sugar crystals. I will keep this one in my recipe box & use it often. Thank you!

I thought these were going to be a disaster. My dough was completely crumbly after mixing. I went ahead and put it in the fridge for about 30 min. When I started forming the balls it kept crumbling, until I learned to pack it together tightly before rolling it into a ball. I then flattened each cookie a little and made a well using a spoon handle (I tried using my thumb, but I ended up smooshing the side of the cookie and the jam ran out when cooking). All of the effort was worth this. These cookies were tender and tasty. I'd make them again in a minute.

I made this cookie twice, and although it is very tasty, it continues to go flat. I would love to know what I am doing wrong. I refriged my dough overnight...still flat. (Also, my hubby had me put Jalapeno Pepper Jelly in some....surprisingly good!)

Very easy and very good!  I did use margarine instead of butter.  Watch out; it's easy to eat more than a few of these at a time!  :0

This recipe was very easy and end product turned out alright. My husband really liked them, but I thought they were a bit thin (thinned out while baking).

Great!  I cut the recipe in half for my culinary students and found that the flour needed to be reduced.  Use only 2/3 cup flour if you plan to halve the recipe.  (Though why you would want to halve this delicious recipe is beyond me....I was thinking 'budget' with 125 students making these cookies.)

Wow!  These are so buttery and flavorful without being overly sweet and are so pretty.  I brought these to a potluck and they were the first to go and everyone ate more than one.  I had to bake mine a little bit longer; around 12 minutes to get the bottom golden brown.

Very delicious cookies!  Followed recipe exactly and they came out perfect.  I did use parchament paper and made sure not to over fill with jam.  After cooking I drizzled with a powdered sugar, vanilla, milk glaze.  I took them to my daughter's kindergarten class, and the container was returned empty!

I made these at a friends house last night and they are great! I used margarine because we didn't have any butter and filled them with raspberry jam. Yum. The entire batch was gone that night. Next time I'll try them with butter.

These were very good cookies.  I only got two dozen from the recipe and I didn't make them much larger than 1".  Had some problems rolling them into balls, they just wouldn't form well even after refrigerating the dough. They came out rather odd looking compared to my grandmothers perfect circles that I remembered!  Anyhow, they were gone within a few hours between my family of four! Thanks

I made these this past Christmas and everyone liked them.  Will make them again.  I did add 2 tsps of vanilla to the recipe to give more flavor.  I used the strawberry jam that comes in a squeeze bottle for ease of adding the jam exactly where I wanted it.

Delicious, buttery flavor, easy to make. I rolled some in chopped walnuts, used cherry jam and strawberry jam.
I preferred the cookies without the nuts. Will definitely include these in my Christmas cookie lineup next year.

This is a good basic thumbprint cookie recipe.  You can use this as the base.  I would recommend making the dough and then chilling it for at least 20 minutes, adding more flour as needed (you want it very soft but not too sticky).  Adding vanilla to the dough is personal preference.  
After rolling the dough into balls, you need to dip it into an egg white bath, then bake it.
This recipe also takes between 10-12 minutes, not 8-10.

We were looking for a jam filled cookie recipe for a party and decided to make these - even doubled the recipe. I did add 2T of almond extract  as some reviews said the cookie itself was a bit bland - these were not bland and delicious. Now even though I doubled the recipe, it only made 3 1/2 dozen cookies as I used a small scoop to keep size of the cookies uniform, rolled them into a ball and made thumb print in palm of hand. This made a decent size 'well' to put preserves in and a bit of a thicker cookie too. Also, put the made but not cooked cookies into the refrigerator for about 5 minutes before cooking them to cool down the butter again - the cookies did not spread out as much. Needless to say, I ended up making another double batch of these as Hubby and kids (and me too) got into them that night and needed to replenish them!

I make a similar recipe but lost it and found this as a replacement. I doubled the recipe and added a tiny amount of almond extract. And a little pinch of salt. Just because that’s how I like it. Great simple recipe.

I had to add almost a cup more of flour than what the recipe called for to make the dough rollable. Also added vanilla extract into the dough- great tasting cookies though and quick to make up and bake!

Made these with my 5 year old daughter who just loved making the thumb holes!  We used unsalted butter so added a little salt and also added some vanilla extract for added flavour.  We use our homemade strawberry jam and they turned out great.  I am happy to have made a double batch.

First time posting and first time making cookies from this app! After reading previous reviews I decided to add 1/4 tsp salt and 2 tsp vanilla....I kept the rest the same! I used Black Cherry preserves...so delicious!

Took one of the reviewers advice and added 1/2 tsp of salt and 2 tsp of vanilla to add more flavor. Also after a rolled the dough into balls and used my finger to make the well, I gently pushed down the cookies with a flat-bottomed cup. I re-shapes the holes a bit and used another reviewer’s advice by filling the jam (I used strawberry) in a plastic bag and cutting a small corner off to squeeze the jam into the wells.

I made these with my 9 and 5 year old daughters. It was so easy they could do it by themselves and they had so much fun with the textures of the jams. I used pineapple and strawberry. The cookie was very good, not to sweet, and the strawberry preserves made the perfect combination,  the pineapple was just to bland for us. They were gone in less than a day..lol..next time I will be doing a double recipe.

I love the texture of the dough when rolling into the balls. I have made other recipes like this where the dough crumbled too much.   I baked these on the least amount of suggested time, and they were perfect texture.   The only negative comment I have was that the cookie itself did not have enough flavor, but when you take a bite with the jam, I guess it complimented it.  Next time I will add some vanilla extract as other folks did.   They look really fancy on a platter! ( put a very, very light drizzle of icing on them to dress them up.

Simple and easy and was amazing with my homemade marionberry freezer jam.   Like any recipe I just adjusted to what I know our likes are.  I doubled the recipe and added 1 tablespoon of pure vanilla extract from Mexico and they were delicious.  Thanks for the recipe.

I don't know how to rate these.  They taste fine for what they are.  However, they look so pretty and festive when you make a platter for the holidays.  This alone makes you want to eat them.  And you have so many options for the preserves/color.

love these cookies. I make them at Christmas and use a raspberry jam and for Easter I use apricot jam. Use colors for the holiday or add nuts to jam. Delicious.

Thank you for sharing this lovely, simple recipe! I've been making these for years now, and they've become a sort of staple... Relatives and friends are always buying new types of jam and begging me to make these cookies with them. No matter how sugary the jam is, it helps that the dough is not too sweet.

Very easy but there is no way this recipe yields 36. I got 25.  Any smaller and they would be nonexistent. I also used a dash of vanilla and a drop of almond extract. I made one batch with sugar and one with Splenda.  No noticeable difference.

I make this cookie every Christmas but don't have a specific recipe printed - I usually just find one with good reviews.  This is an easy cookie and not far off from similar ones, but this needed salt (which I added) and vanilla or almond (I added vanilla).  I just felt these tasted really "flour-y" and less buttery... Probably won't use this specific recipe again.

As is would be very bland.  Took the advice of others and added 1 tsp salt (I use unsalted butter) and 2 tsp vanilla.  Definitely more buttery than regular thumbprint cookies.

I ABSOLUTELY do not understand why these thumbprint cookies got a bad rap either!!  There is someone else who made this comment first and I am just agreeing with her!
They are easy to make, 1 Bowl, find your absolutely most favourite jam ever and use it because it will make them just that much more Amazing!!  As per McKenzie’s review:
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/25100/jam-filled-butter-cookies/reviews/4531315/.
                       My Mother and I would make thumbprint cookies, Every Christmas, the ones with nuts on the outside.  I followed alot of McKenzie's suggestions and they turned out as Perfect as the ones My Mother and I would make!!  They were SOOO good that my Roommate who was going back to Mexico took the majority back with her because, YES, they were that good!!  Follow the recipe and they will turn out perfectly... Just like mine!!  :)
PS Merry Almost Christmas  :)

These are awesome! I put a dollop of chocolate ganache in the center. Will have to double next time so they will last more than one day. Family ate them up. Thanks for sharing my new easy go-to cookies.

The cookie was blend, but loved the texture of the cookie. Maybe on the next batch I'll apply some kind of zest to give the cookie some kind of taste.

Since I wanted chocolate thumbprint cookies and couldn't find a good recipe, I altered this one a bit and it turned out great! 
First I used 1 whole egg instead of 2 egg yolks. Then I substituted 1/4 cup of the flour for 1/4 cup of Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa Powder. This turned the cookies almost an alarming shade of brown/black, but they tasted excellent! I also added a touch of baking powder for good measure.

These were very easy to make, yet tasted like store-bought cookies I used to eat when I was younger.  I will definitely make these again! :-)

This recipe is great, but I did two batches, one with a tablespoon of vanilla added and one without, and the vanilla makes a Huge difference. Also, I used two whole eggs, I didn't bother separating, so it might have been a little sticky, but I just work fast and it's fine.

I made these and absolutely loved it! I used a lemon curd as a filling rather than a jam.

Why has it taken me so long to make these?!? Oh so yummy! These were so simple. I used blackberry jam I bought at the Farmer's Market. I baked them for 10 minutes and sprinkled with powdered sugar. I will make these again.

These are really good, thank you to MKHG for posting. I followed what another reviewer did which was to use one whole egg, add 2 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp salt so I'm rating it on those variations.

Had some fresh Mango Preserves that a cousin made and decided to attempt these cookies.  Giving it four stars due to crumbly texture.  I didn’t experience the BLANDNESS in flavor because I accidentally converted my sugar to Splenda packet ratio incorrectly.  So instead of 1/2 cup of sugar I added 1 1/2 cups of sugar (36 packets of Splenda).  THE FLAVOR WAS DIVINE.  Not sure if the crumbly texture was due to not kneeding dough enough or too much sugar.  Trick I used to getting that jam directly in center.  I used a measuring spoon as a mold so each cookie came out same size then I pressed the top of cookie mold with the back rounded part of a smaller measuring spoon, which created a round well on tops of each cookie making it easy to scoop jelly into each.  THEY ARE DIVINE AND LIGHT AND MELT IN YOUR MOUTH.  JUST ADD THE EXTRA SPLENDA/SUGAR.  Can’t imagine the flavor with 1/2 a cup because the 1 1/2 cups of Splenda resulted in a mildly sweet butter cookie with the sweetness of the preserves making it just right.

I followed this recipe exactly as it was written, taking care to refrigerate the dough between each step. I used a small cookie scoop to measure out the dough and the floured back side of my 1/2 tsp measuring spoon to make the indent for the jam. A low tech ziplock helped me get the jam onto each cookie. This recipe easily resulted in some of the best cookies I’ve ever made. I was a little worried about the egg yolks, as I was looking for a traditional shortbread, but I shouldn’t have doubted it! Tender buttery cookies melt in your mouth with a sweet dollop of jam in the middle.

This was a very good cookie. Easy to follow.  I used plum jam for the filling and they reminded of cookies my mom used to make, she was a German imigrant.

Best cookies I ever made according to my 18 year old.  Did follow a few reviews and added 1 tsp of vanilla, a pinch of salt, floured the back of a measuring tsp and used it to make the indention and sprinkled confectioners sugar from a sifter when still warm.

Wow! So easy and delicious! After reading all of the reviews, I was concerned that the filling would spill over or burn or something! But, they came out perfectly!  I made a double batch and got about 4 dozen cookies.

I took the suggestion of others and added about 1.5 tsp of vanilla to the batter. 

I used a 1" melon baller  to scoop the dough for consistent cookie size, then used the 1/2" side to make the well for the jam.

Also - I put about 1 Tbsp of flour in a small ramekin then lightly dipped the backside of the 1/2 melon baller into the flour before making the dent in the cookie.  That way,  batter didn't stick to the utensil as I lifted it out of the cookie.  And the amount is so small, it had virtually no impact on taste.

This recipie was amazing- I was able to make the cookies pretty quickly, and they got eaten in just about that much time. I added more jam (I used raspberry) because it seems like there's never enough! The butter cookies were PERFECT and all golden and beautiful. These are going to be a new favoritefor sure.

Absolutely Delicious!!! These cookies were a hit!! I used Passion fruit jam, red raspberry preserves with seeds, blackberry preserves, guayaba marmalade for a variety and they were all delicious!!  I was a bit hesitant to use the raspberry with seeds but you couldn't even tell the difference. I followed directions exactly except I sprinkled white sugar before baking them and added powdered sugar once they came out of the oven.

I just had to log on and give a review of this cookie! I saw the lower reviews and then looked at the higher rated ones, and I agree with the latter: this is a great butter cookie recipe. I made it once for the first time and it turned out perfectly. I made sure not to make the "wells" on the cookie too deep and made them more shallow and didn't overfill the cookie with the jam. I enjoyed the base recipe that this user  used and didn't add any vanilla or sugar. It was a hit with co-workers and family a like this Christmas. I will and plan on making it again.

These are so good! Definitly going in my recipe box to add to my regular Christmas cookies! I love how simple the recipe is, too. I did add a teaspoon of Cointreau along with the sugar,, butter and eggs just to add a little more flavor. I use the back of a teaspoon to make my divets, and put a generous half teaspoon of my homemade plum jam in each cookie. This was exactly what I was looking for. Simple, rich, not too sweet, and complimented a complex jam very well.

My husband and I both enjoyed these cookies.  They're not overly sweet and, like others have said, the cookie is rather bland.  The jam or preserves used to fill the cookie is what elevates the flavor.

I rolled these into 1" balls and flattened with my thumb.  These were not baked in the maximum 10 minutes, so I left them in for 13 minutes, which was perfect for this size cookie. My filling was raspberry preserves for half the cookies and marmalade for the other half.  The marmalade made a mess, but were delicious.

I'd make these again if I were looking for a cookie that isn't overly sweet.

Added 1/2 tps salt, and 1 tsp vanilla extract.  I made the imprint fairly large to fill with jam. Made 2 dozen cookies. To get 3 dozen the cookies would be pretty small.  This is super easy, fast and they turn out delicious.

My cookies don't look anything like the ones in the photo, BUT they taste amazing so who cares what they look like!!  Best tasting cookies that I've ever made.  Crazy part is that they're SUPER easy to make.  Will definitely make again.  Will put more effort into the presentation the next time.

made these tonight. very bland. came back to the recipe to see if I missed the salt or what. hopefully better tomorrow. most things are better the next day. I used seedless raspberry preserves. baked for 8 minutes exactly and they are beautiful. always use my pampered chef cookie scoops for perfect portions. the small scoop made 31 cookies for me.

This is the 3rd thumbprint recipe i’ve made.   This one calls for too much flour, it takes away from the buttery shortbread cookie taste and gives a more “floury” taste.   I would recommend cutting down on the flour to maybe 1 to 1 1/4 cups.   Also, other recipes have the jam put in after it’s cooked and it works well.   Another recipe called for powdered sugar and I think that works better for this type of cookie.

These are amazing exactly how the recipe is!  I used all organic ingredients, and it was so simple I didn't have to substitute anything.  The recipe is similar to some old German recipes, and I'm wondering if that is where it was passed down from.   I will make these cookies again and again!

HINT:  If your dough gets too warm before you're done mixing, next time use flour from the freezer.  I keep my flour in there all the time and it changes nothing - except it keeps your dough from getting too soft and it keeps you from getting weevils.

These are a nice cookie, but a bit plain even with the jam.  They are a good cookie to have with tea and they are't too sweet.

Huge hit at the party I brought them to!  I added about 1 tsp of vanilla and a pinch of salt to the dough....perfectly simple.

Easy to make - and a small batch too.  Great way to use up extra jam (or in my case, tart plum syrup)!

Delicious.  I followed the recipe with the exception of adding 1/2 tsp of vanilla.  I put the dough in the refrigerator for about an hour prior to rolling and the consistency was perfect.  It's important that you don't roll the balls any larger than 1 inch in diameter.  Press firmly in the middle of the ball, about halfway down and place the jelly inside.  I used about 1/4 tsp jelly.  I dusted with powdered sugar before serving.

I added a little salt and some vanilla to this recipe. They were OK, but I needed to bake them for over 12 minutes, and they still weren't completely done. I AM at 2800 feet here, so I know to use the higher time for baking, but still...They are pretty little cookies, but I don't think I'll bake them again.

Made these for my family last night. Great cookie. I used apple jelly because it was the only thing I had. Delicious. Tasted like a sweet jelly biscuit. Not your average sweet cookie, but that's what makes it great :) Forgot to take a picture before the family devoured them.

Awesome!!! I made 3 batches in 24 hours and they were all eaten as quickly as I could bake them.   I drizzled vanilla glaze over them and used homemade blackberry jam.  A huge hit with the kids and my husband.

I used one whole egg instead of two yolks - not sure if that's the reason there was a faint eggy smell in the air while baking. Might add a bit of vanilla essence the next time. I used apricot jam, the taste was nice - not too sweet and buttery. I had to chill the dough for 2 hours though, and kept it in the fridge even between batches. Otherwise the cookies spread too much. Oh, and I added the jam to the thumbprints after taking them out of the oven. A fun activity to do with kids.

I was in a hurry & didn't have time to make perfect little balls, so rolled the dough into two 20" rolls, made one long thumbprint then filled with preserves.  After cooking I let cool, drizzled with 1/4 of icing recipe (perfect amount) then sliced horizontally into 1" rectangular cookies. They were a huge hit! Even after a day the preserves didn't leak or spread out. 
My oven temp is not consistent, I baked at 400* but in hindsight should have baked a few mins longer at 375.

Oh my gosh this cookie is far from bland! The cookie by itself is so buttery it melts in your mouth.  It reminds me of some of the better shortbread cookies.  I used orange marmalade in my thumb print. It was refreshing. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed . I will be making more of these for gifts.

With every new recipe I don't alter anything on the first try.   They turned out sooo delish!  It's a butter cookie therefore you should taste the butter and not the sweetness/sugar.  My co-workers were upset with me because they couldn't stop eating them.  Each batch amounts to about  18 cookies depending on the size.  I used strawberry jam for the filling.

I made two versions of thumbprint cookies and the only real difference was this one used egg yolks, the other did not. I preferred the other one (found it to be more "melt in your mouth), though my sister preferred these for the texture - it has a little more chew. Very delicious, not too difficult to work with. Make the cookies small, with deep wells and chill dough between batches and you shouldn't have issues with spreading. I used blackberry and strawberry jams and both worked really well Yumm!

Great recipe with simple ingredients. My edits using other reviews yielded a cookie that tasted great out of oven & MUCH better the next morning as flavors came together. 50% white sugar, 50% (dark) brown sugar, 2 dashes pumpkin pie spice, 2tsp vanilla and 1 whole egg (instead of 2 yolks). Impressively good having sat a night. I also am testing a variation in my Nordic tiny cannele pan: add dough 1/2 way, then jam in a well, then top with more dough to seal &  fill the mold. Bake 350F for 12-15min, dust with icing sugar. Made gorgeous easy party desserts!

Maybe it's me but way too much butter flavor and not enough sweet.  The cookies cracked while cooking and the jam spread too much so they weren't too pretty.  They were very simple to make though but I won't use this recipe again.

Delicious!!! I used tips from a few peeps. I added the 1/4t salt, 2t vanilla and used 2 whole eggs. I also LOVE the tip of using the zip lock bag to use for the filling. It made it so much easier and clean up was a breeze. Extra jam, no problem, just squeeze it back in the jar, then throw the bag away when you're done. Easy peasy!

These were absolutely delicious! I did take the advice of other reviewers & added the vanilla & salt. I also used the Ziploc bag trick for the preserves and used my thumb to make the indentation in the dough. It really made it easier to handle the dough by leaving it in the fridge for 10-15 minutes prior to handling. 10minutes in the oven & they were perfect, not under nor over cooked. I made these for my 25th annual Christmas cookie exchange & they were a huge hit. I am making them again today and then for Christmas. Thank you MKHD

Reading the ingredients, I noticed that salt was not added, which is key in baking or with any sweets, otherwise dough will be bland as many have mentioned in the reviews.  I added a pinch of salt to the dough and also a 1/4 tsp of orange extract to the raspberry jelly. Perfect little cookie! Be sure to refrigerate before rolling into balls. Dough is very soft. I baked mine for 12 min, but each oven is different.

The yield for one inch dough balls was 24.  The cookie did flatten as it baked.  Dough was unbaked in center of cookie.  I suggest flattening the dough balls prior to baking.

After browsing the popular reviews I decided to make a few tweaks too. I added some vanilla, used salted butter, added a pinch of salt, used a whole egg instead of just whites and swapped in a little brown sugar. These were good choices.

Excellent. Will definitely make again. I only only only changed it because I read a few reviews on it being and so I did add 1/4 tsp vanilla and a pinch of sea salt. I was sending them 1,000 miles away to my father in law for Christmas and I didn't want to disappoint him. I also baked on a standard cookie sheet and air bake cookies sheet and had better success with air bake cookie sheet. Mine didn't quite looks "beautiful", but were excellent tasting. I added apricot preserves. I got 35 cookies out of my batch. I would definitely recommend these and make myself again.

What a nice simple cookie. I added 1/8 teaspoon on salt and 2 teaspoons of vanilla for  more flavor. I didn't get 36 cookies from the dough but this cookie was so good I burned my mouth on the piping hot jelly and I didn't even care! Thank you for this recipe!

Based on the reviews that said it was kind of bland, I added just a teeney, tiny, pinch of nutmeg to the dough.  That made it perfect.

This is a delicious buttery cookie! I added a little almond extract and used apricot and raspberry preserves. Inspired by Italian rainbow cookies.

I made these for a "mad" tea party for my 6 year old's birthday party. She loved them and so did my twelve year old. I think they are a fabulous tea-time cookie! I will make these again as they are so simple and you can add any filling you like. Our favorite was lemon curd. May add a teaspoon of vanilla in the future. One batch was approximately 24 cookies, so if you are making them for a gathering, you may want to double up.

Was looking for a way to use up gifts of jam since we don't really eat it much.  I threw these together and my dinner guests LOVED them. They were so simple, but the buttery taste was a winner. Be sure to use real butter.

These were lovely and reminded me of the ones my mother used to bake when I was a kid. I had fun with my daughter making these into balls to flatten. I took the advice of another reviewer and didn't jam these until after baking and I used a sandwich bag to pipe the jam in place. Used apricot jam this time around and dusted with icing sugar - will be making again.

I made this recipe just the way it described, with no additions. I used my own blueberry lemon jam. I am glad this is a simple, almost shortbread like cookie. It had a nice, pleasantly dry texture with subtle flavor that balanced out the strong, sweet, gooey jam perfectly. This is a keeper. Simple, only a few ingredients, and delicious. I'm going to make them often.

I really liked these cookies, and they were fun to make! I did add a 1/4 teaspoon of salt and a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla to add a little bit of flavor. Next time I will probably add a little more vanilla though. For the jam, I used a strawberry preservative, and it was delicious!

Super easy to make! I added a little almond and vanilla extracts, and then rolled the dough balls in powdered sugar so the outside of the cookies came out crispy. Also I took someone else's suggestion to use one whole egg instead of two yolks and it worked fine.

I personally find the cookie to be a bit bland, but every time I make these, my friends & family all say they're AMAZING--even the people who don't usually go for sweets much.

Given that they're always so popular and that this is pretty much the quickest & easiest cookie recipe I've seen outside of a package of slice-and-bakes, this has been one of my major go-to recipes for the last several years and will continue to be for years to come!

I added vanilla and it was still pretty bland. I also tried rolling the dough in chopped walnuts then pressing them. They were tastier, but still a bit bland to me. I am hiking they might be nice with chocolate frosting...

As a beginner they were fairly easy to make but are difficult to get to look like the picture. However looks aside, they really only taste like whatever jam is in them which in my opinion is not a bad thing.

The whole family absolutely loved them! I will definitely make them again, they've been requested many times, and I've enjoyed them with every type of jam used. Tried them with a spicy sweet jalapeno jelly; amazing!

Very easy, excellent recipe.  Made as directed, using seedless raspberry jam.  Made a lemon drizzle using confectioners sugar and fresh lemon juice and zest.  They were great!  Sweet, tart and crispy on the outside while staying soft on the inside.  Perfection....

My batter was still not solid enough. Even after I put it in the fridge for 20 minutes.  Other than that they taste great! I topped mine with a little extra sugar and couldn't be happier!

Absolutely a five star recipe! Soooooooo nice to have something come together as quick as this does! I threw these together in between laundry and dishes. I had all ingredients on hand! Hallelujah. How often does that happen? We used blackberry jam. These were eaten fresh out of the oven. They were so good we didn't wait. I can not attest to how good they are after cooling as ours didn't last that long. Just an FYI, I'm pretty sure I made the balls in the correct size but I only ended up with 23 cookies. Just in case you are trying to plan for a crowd. I saw no point in dressing these up with anything extra as they were already delicious.

I made this exactly as the recipe calls, adding about 1/2 tsp of vanilla. After baking for about 12 mins (I use air bake cookie sheets), and before taking them off sheets, I sprinkled Confectioners' Sugar over them. They are delicious.  Thought about using the base recipe and adding pecan bits to make some Sandies. If they are too crisp, add a slice of bread and they will be soft and chewy (Mother's trick)

I gave it a four star. Was okay but no the greatest. I made the dip in the center but it leveled out. Not the best... will make it again. I added a bit of vanilla. I also made it sorta like a pecan pie on one. Its baking. thanks for the recipe very simple.

This is a great recipe and I will definitely make it again. I did change the recipe a little bit though cause like others who rated this recipe, I like more flavor in the dough. I added 1/2 tsp  coconut emulsion and used a whole egg instead of 2 yolks.  I also dusted the warm cookies with icing sugar.  The coconut flavor is amazing!!!
It's a very easy recipe, the cookies are fab and they disappear quickly!!

Followed the recipe as written. Did not find them bland, they tasted like a butter cookie should.  I used raspberry jam.  Next time I may triple the recipe.  I doubled it, and these cookies disappeared during the day and a secret midnight cookie thief.  Thank you for a great recipe!

I like it. and it turns out well. But I think or at least for me the butter is a little extra than required. Otherwise everything is perfect! :)

These were so fantastic!! I definitely recommend them! I used one whole egg instead of two yolks, I added some vanilla extract, some salt, and used flour when I formed them on the baking sheet instead of chilling. I made them all in less than one hour!! Super good cookie without much work to be sure

This recipe yields very delicious cookies that are hard to resist. Each cookie is packed with blast of flavor that leaves you craving for more.  I love this recipe and always use this whenever I have to bake "quick cookies." This recipe can also be doubled without causing any troubles with the dough, texture and flavor.  Moreover the dough is really very easy to work with.  I am in love with this recipe.

The only thing I added to the recipe was a tablespoon of vanilla extract.  I used Dickinson purely fruit strawberry and apricot.  They came out very nice. I will be making these again!

These are really good. Made them with apricot preserves and my family demolished them. I added salt and vanilla and the cookies were blissfully good. Didn't get but about 20 cookies though. Definitely double the recipe

I used salted butter, added about 1 tsp of almond extract, used coconut sugar and King Arthur's White Whole Wheat flour.  Baked for 8 minutes and they came out perfect!  Used Crofters Just Fruit Spread in Seville Orange flavour, delightful!  Rolled 1/2 TAblespoon balls and used the end of my pineapple slicer handle to make a perfect sized indent, then used a 1/4 tsp to slip a bit of the fruit spread in.  Mine came out to 29 cookies, very cute sized!

Great recipe, but the dough lacked some flavour. I had enough for only 27 cookies, not 36 like the recipe stated. It also took 15 minutes to bake; maybe it was the oven that had some problems. Next time I will try to add some vanilla extract and salt to the dough mixture.

Very good! I decided to make some changes to make it a bit healthy, so I added 2 teaspoons of cold milled flax seed meal, used only 1/2 cp of butter and 3/4 of almond meal instead of all purpose flour. They came or very good.

Very easy to make, flavor was great I didn't need any powder sugar, also, a tip you might like, fill zip lock bag with fruit kind of smush it up if using preserves, cut one corner a tiny bit, makes it easier to fill cookies. Thanks for the share.

They were great! My husband wanted peanut butter cookies but we were out of peanut butter so my daughter suggested jelly cookies.  So I was excited when I found this recipe. Loved the suggestion of using a baggie to "pipe" the jam into the cookie.  I don't usually write reviews but I had to on this one.  It bothered me that other's were saying the taste was not good. The thing to remember is that these are butter cookies.  They aren't supposed to be sweet or sugary.  Adding other things to them makes them a different kind of cookie.  These taste perfect.  They are exactly what butter cookies should taste like.

I refrigerated by the dough for a few hours, which was a mistake as it got too hard to work with. Next time I'll follow the recipe better. I used apricot jam and it was a hit with everybody. Great recipe!

These came out great!  I followed another reviewer's advice and added 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract and 1/4 teaspoon of salt to the dough right before adding the flour.  Next time, I will try using lemon or almond extract since this is a great basic butter cookie recipe.  Using one whole egg instead of two egg yolks will save you some time and won't hurt the recipe.  Also, I think using preserves instead of jam helps prevent overflowing during baking so avoid using jam if possible.  I used strawberry rhubarb preserves and they were very delicious!

Doubled this recipe and got about 5 dozen from it.  I used a 1/2 teaspoon measuring spoon dipped in powdered sugar to form the well, then used a heaping 1/4 tablespoon to fill them with jam, and did not have any overfilled.  Just be careful not to push the spoon all the way to the bottom or the jam will leak through the hole (still tasty but messy when you try to put it on the cooling rack!).

I tried this recipe and give it a definate 5 star. However, its only given the 5 star because of the review posted by Maria Isa. I did use a 1/4 tsp salt & the 2 tsp vanilla. (What kind of cookie recipe doesn't at least have them in it anyway?)  HOWEVER, I home can my jelly (not jam) and used blackberry, concord grape (made from red concord grapes) and apple jelly. Made these the best cookies that ever passed my teeth!

A great recipe. I did do some of my own teaks: I added 1/2 tsp of bourbon vanilla to the egg yolks, sugar, butter mixture. I used strawberry preserves, which I ran through my Ninja before adding to the cookie. Advice: Let the butter soften at room temp before using and do not work the dough too much once its mixed or else it will crumble. I baked the cookies for 9 min, they still looked raw on the top but then darkened a little once removed from the oven. I sprinkled powdered sugar over the top. I got 26 cookies from this recipe, next time I will double. Very quick & easy recipe!

These cookies are great. I live at 5,200ft and they still came out perfect. I just had to adjust the baking time. 5-6 minutes longer than reccomended. After reading the reviews I too added some vanilla extract.  The dough is so soft and fun to work with. Thanks for the recipe!

1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 egg  since I use unsalted butter added salt.  Filled with a 'blubbery cake and pastry filling'.  Needs more vanilla or the extra 1/2 egg poss too much?  I enjoyed the recipe thank you.

These were exactly what I was looking for, a delicate flavour, to showcase my homemade berry and pomegranate jam. I used margarine instead of butter (I can't believe it's not butter), and I added about 1 tsp vanilla, 1/8 tsp salt and a whole egg in place of the 2 yolks as suggested by another reviewer. I believe I will sprinkle these with icing sugar for decoration. Thanks for a great recipe!

i added a tiny tap of salt and about a tsp of vanilla, and made it with strawberry preservatives, it tasted like strawberry buscuits, i was kinda hoping for that cookie taste..... slightly disappointing! but everyone loves them. that recipe made 29 cookies.

I did what the first comment said to do, and it was great! I used raspberry jam. I loved it, going to make these cookies again!! ^_^ 
They are a perfect light snack, with a cup of warm tea/coffee!

Really good butter cookies AFTER I followed other reviews and added 1/4 tsp. salt and 2 tsp vanilla.  Would also be good with a little lemon added.  I dipped them in chocolate and sprinkled with ground walnuts instead of the jam.

Super easy! Great recipe to use with basic ingredients that you have in the kitchen. Used this recipe as a last minute save after my first sugar-free, flour-free, health nut recipe didn't turn out so well! Will definitely keep this one in my recipe box.

A lovely and simple recipe. I added finely grated lemon rind to the dough,about 2 tsp. and it seemed to compliment both the apricot and the blueberry fillings. Also, baked at only 350 for 10 minutes.

My dough wouldn't come together. I struggled to squeeze crumbs together to form a cookie. I was so frustrated.... this is strange because many other reviews found the dough too wet??? How are 2 such opposing views possible of the same recipe??? Anyway, I gave it 2 stars because they tasted good with the jam in the centre.

I had made these cookies a long time ago, I had noted then that the bottoms cooked faster than the tops. I also noted to add a tsp of vanilla. I followed the recipe and added the tsp of vanilla, as some peoples review was that the cookie was bland. I also cooked them at a 350 temp rather than the 375, and just cooked them longer- 15 minutes, we like a well done cookie, however they weren't too well done but they were really good. I even added almonds to some.

This recipe is so easy to make!! I am so happy with the result. However for the jam part, I used strawberry preservative. It was too sweet for me. For my second batch I tried Apple Jelly. It was the perfect tart and sweet cookie. Next time I will try something like raspberry or blackberry jam. I love the variety of jams I can choose with the recipe.

This is the easiest, quickest cookie I have ever made!! I have to admit though, I ended up sprinkling a bit of icing sugar on the tops as the dough wasn't quite as sweet as my kids like. I also added some chopped walnuts to the jam. Turned out great, all the ingredients were on hand which makes this recipe a five star in my eyes.

I did not have much luck with these.  In the middle of baking them, the sides cracked and the jam ran out of the centers.  I will not make these again.

This is my second Christmas making these cookies. Of the 7 types of cookies I make each year these get the best reviews! My friends and family love them! I use 3 types of preserves- peach, strawberry and blackberry. I dust with powdered sugar at the end, too, like another reviewer suggested. These are great and easy to make and stay fresh for a long time.

I've actually been making these with full eggs instead of just egg yolks.  I was just going to make them now and noticed that the recipe calls for egg yolks and not full eggs.  What is the difference?  Can I continue to use full eggs?

Wonderfully Delicious Cookies!!! They don't last in my house for more than an hour. I usually up the original servings from 3 to 12 dozen. Even then, they dont last too long. Their gobbled up in no time!! I highly recommend you go out and try these cookies. You should be able to find the ingredients right in your kitchen! Also, a great recipe to start young bakers off with! Yummy!! :) Does anyone know of the glazes some people have used to top off these cookies? please post recipe!! Thanks!

A simple easy and great recipe to use. But it was slightly oily for my preference. I also added some vanilla essence for taste. The dough was slightly crumbly though, so had to keep molding it to ensure it kept its shape.

I loved this recipe.  The dough is moist and very easy to work with.  When I made my thumb print the dough stayed intact and didn't crack or seperate.  I added almond extract, used raspberry preserves and drizzled the tops with a white glaze...very pretty and delicious!

Have made these cookies last couple Christmas and everyone has enjoyed them. This year I'm making them for a charity bake sale at work. Had to make an extra batch for my family at home. They can eat them faster than I can make them and their so simply and easy to make!

Very good! Smooth and buttery. Easy to make and they look so delicate. I do also suggest adding the vanilla or almond extract and a 1/2 tsp of salt. Best cookies I have made yet. (usually my cookies are an epic fail).

Added a pinch of salt and a splash of vanilla. They needed more than 8 to 10 minutes in the oven. Mine needed about 14 minutes.

Follow the recipe up to the ball-rolling part. Put the leftover egg whites into a bowl and put 3/4 cup chopped walnuts into another bowl. Roll each cookie into a ball, dip it in the egg white then the walnuts to coat, put on the cookie sheet, and continue the recipe as directed. Yum!

I liked this easy recipe! It's much better with some added flavors: lemon zest, 2 tsp Vanilla extract, and 1/4 tsp almond extract. To make the cookie even prettier, sprinkle the tops with crushed almonds!

Really delicious. I read through the reviews and decided to make some changes, and I'm SO glad I did. They were delicate, delicious, and light. I added 1/2 tsp Almond extract, rolled each cookie ball in sugar before making the divot for the jam. SO yummy.

I have been looking for my Grandmother's recipe for a while now. This is my 4th recipe I have tried. By far this one is the best. The only thing I did that was not in the recipe is I lightly sifted powered sugar on the top. Wonderful!!! Thank you so much this is a keeper. :)

These cookies are simple to make.  As written, the cookie is pretty good but a little bland.  The next time I made them I added 1/4 tsp salt, 1 tsp vanilla, and used 1 whole egg instead of 2 egg yolks.  These revisions made it a 5 star recipe!

These are great.  I added 1 tsp of vanilla for a bit of flavoring.  I think my batch made 2 dozen. :)  Wish it made even more!  Oh, and I used apricot jam.  I'm sure any kind would be good.

Excellent recipe!  I took some advice from other reviewers and made the following changes:

1.5 tsp Vanilla extract (tasted the dough until i was happy with the flavor)
1 egg and 1 yoke (i wanted some extra fluffiness from the egg white)
about 3/4 c additional flour (to make up for the extra vanilla and egg)

Made about 34 cookies, could have easily been 36 if i proportioned the balls more evenly.  My next attempt will be to make the wells for the preserves wider to get more in there.  Thank you!  ^_^

OH... and don't add too much flour!  This dough will look very mushy, but due to the amount of butter it won't stick to your hands when you make balls.

I have had a hard time finding a recipe that I like for these cookies.  These were absolutely perfect!  They were gone in a matter of minutes!  Delicious.  Used Sugar-free black raspberry jam and heard rave reviews!  Will be my go-to recipe from now on for these cookies.

Just made a batch of these today for the holidays, and they are yummy!! Like others suggested, I added a tsp. of vanilla, just to kick up the flavor. For the fun of it--and the fact that I needed to make a cookie with some festive green in it-- I used some jalapeno jelly. That is what I will use when making these cookies from now on, cause they just made the cookie even better!

I followed this recipe exactly, and I couldn't get the cookies to stay together.  As soon as I tried to make a hole for the jam they immediately crumbled and fell apart.

I thought these were good!  I took the advice of another reviewer and used some vanilla. I have other thumbprint cookie recipes I like and they use vanilla so I used about a 1/2 tsp.  I rolled some of them in walnuts prior to putting the jam in them.  I have to say I prefered the ones without though!  I used apricot preserves but would def mash up the fruit chunks more next time.  I also used black raspberry jam.  Both were delcious!  I will make these again but without the nuts and may try to use more jam than I used this time.

this recipe is perfect the way it is.  The cookie is not too sweet which is great because of the preserves.  Do use fruit preserves.

Superb recipe.. but i made a few changes in the way i baked it.. why worry about the jam melting and overflowing out onto the baking sheet? place the cookies to be baked in the oven without filling with the jam.. wait till they are three fourth done. take them out and fill with jam.. now bake again at a lower temp for a few more mnts.. this way the jam will remain firm,neither too set nor too soft..to make them look more festive i brushed the cookies around the wells with the left over egg white and sprinkled some sugar crystals at the stage when you have to fill them with the jam..as well i prefer adding 1 tsp of vanilla essence while making the dough.. try and experience the difference.

This is the best, easiest recipe I have ever found for this cookie!  The measurements are relatively forgiving and you can basically add what you want to it and it still comes out great.

This is a great recipe! The cookies themselves do have flavor, but as should be expected it's the subtle flavor of a butter cookie. It's not a sugar cookie, that's for sure, but it's still delicious! I used strawberry jam for half of them, and a Hershey kiss in the middle for the other half. Definitely a success :)

Very good! I used strawberry jam and sweetened cream cheese to make delicious cookies! Per other suggestions, I used less flour, BUT DON'T! My first batch was relatively flat, so I added in the flour I'd left out. Also, I added 1 tsp vanilla and used 1 whole egg instead of 2 egg yolks. Will make again!

My cookies do not look like the cookies in the picture AT ALL.  They are tasty, but not pretty.  I barely used any preserves and they spread a lot.  I don't think I will make these again. Though they taste nice, I am too embarrassed to bring them to the event that I made them for.

Soooo delicious! I substituted a half cup of cornstarch for 3/4 cup of flour to increase the "melt-in-your-mouth"ness, and they turned out wonderfully. I also needed to cook it for the full amount of time, even though in my oven I usually end up having to cut short the cooking time.

The taste of these cookies is really good. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because the dough is not stiff enough to roll and make a thumb imprint even after an hour in the fridge. I added more flour until stiff dough formed and let it set in the fridge for about 20 min. In my opinion the cookie dough needed a little more flavor so I added approx 1 1/2 tablespoons of vanilla and some chopped pecans and the results were great. I will definitely make these again!!

this was a good, simple recipe.  i did however, have to use the vanilla extract that was suggested by another reader because the first batch was lacking something, which is why i am only giving 4 stars.  but i will definitely use this recipe again.  i used raspberry preserves and apricot preserves.  everyone in my house loved them.

These were very good! I followed the recipe except I did add 1/4 tsp of salt.  I got 24 out of the recipe and had to cook mine for 13 mins but that may just be my oven, mine did not brown but were definelty done.

I made several batches of these cookies for both an office holiday party and Christmas gifts.  Lots of rave reviews about the cookies.  And the cookies survived the postal system.  Recipe is fine as is but I did add a teaspoon of vanilla.  Also, I had to bake these cookies a little longer than 10 minutes.   These cookies have become a holiday favorite!

What a simple delish recipe! My 11 year old and her friends made these this weekend and it was so easy!  I did add almond extract (it needed something to enhance flavor) We used Apricot, Pinneapple and Raspberry Jams.  For the pineapple jam we rolled the dough in coconut then filled it.  It's DELISH!!!

I loved these! I did use margarine because that's all I had, I bet they would be even better with butter, but they were still really good. I did add the salt and vanilla that everyone else seemed to suggest. They held their shape really well too.

Quick recipe and allowed me to use my leftover yolks from making French Macaroons so that was a HUGE plus.    I think my butter was a bit too cold as these didn't spread too much and were pretty thick.  On my last tray, I used a glass to flatten the cookies and then did the thumb print.    I too added vanilla flavoring but the cookies really didn't pick it up.  I would make these again with softer butter and I might rethink the rolling in sugar as on of my coworkers indicated they look like little eyeballs.

I've been looking for a good thumbprint cookie recipe to match what I get at the bakery.  This is IT!.  I didn't have butter so I used margarine, but it was still excellent.  I also filled it after baking with the Sugar Cookie Icing recipe on this site.  YUMMY!

These were wonderful! They only lasted maybe a few days at my house and were incredibly easy to make. Super versatile as well. You could put just about anything in the middle. I can't wait to make these again.

Add a bit of salt and almond or vanilla extract and this is a 5 Star recipe. Per somebody else's recommendation, I also rolled the dough into a ball and then flattened to about 1/4" with a glass dipped in granulated sugar. I then made a perfect shallow well in the center using a pestle and filled it with apricot preserves using a pastry bag. (I blended the apricot preserves with a hand held blender first to break up the bigger chunks of fruit.) Cookie to jam ratio is important to consider. Since my wells were more shallow and held less jam, I made my cookies smaller so you could get a great blend of cookie and filling in each bite. A dusting of powdered sugar is a great finish!

I halved this recipe, so that could have hade something to do with my results. The taste of the cookie was great, my only problem was that the dough was very crumbly. The cookies came out very crumbly too, but soft.

The recipe was awesome, especially with a few modifications and substitutions. I had no butter and margarine worked just as well, and a little vanilla essence sweetened up the biscuit mixture which, when warm, was like cake...mmmmmm yum.

OK, I have made this recipe so many times I have lost count! My kids just love them-I was running low on supplies so whipped these up using margarine, added a little more flour to compensate, a splash of vanilla and they still turned out perfect!! Awesome recipe!

These turned out really well, my kids all gave them the thumbs up!   The recipe says it yields 36 cookies, but I was only able to get 33 very small cookies. Next time I make them I will just make 24 so they will be a bit larger.

Just finished my first batch!  AMAZING!  So quick and easy!  Be careful not to overfill the cookies, they may overflow OR be quiet gooey!  My next batch I'm going to try adding a little vanilla extract and using preserves that will be toddler friendly!  Love this recipe!!

These had a wonderful flavor, and were very tender...almost too tender. They wanted to fall apart a little.  I also had hoped they would spread a bit more, but they stayed somewhat ball-like.

I have made these several times and they are positively fabulous. I received the recipe from my honorary aunt when we had our baking day and have made them many times since. I found that by adding just about 1/4 teaspoon almond extract they took on a nice nutty flavor, though if you are not partial to almond extract I would recommend using either very little or none at all. They are great for big parties because they are small and everyone can get some, but they are also nice if you are craving something sweet.  A definite must try recipe!   P.S. it looks just wonderful to sprinkle some powdered sugar on them once they have come out of the oven.

These were great and easy to make!  I followed the recipe exact.  However, I was surprised that the recipe made exactly 1 dozen cookies.  Even if I had rolled the dough into somewhat smaller balls, I still don't think I could have squeezed 36 cookies out.  Next time I will double or triple the recipe.  Because of the size, I increased baking time to about 15 minutes.

I added two tsp. of vanilla and a dash of salt, as suggested by previous reviews.  The dough was very sticky and I had to leave it in the fridge for 45 minutes before I could work with it.  The dough tasted sweet and buttery, but the cookies don't have as strong of a flavor when they bake.  They're good though, especially if you like a simple tasting cookie (my husband does), and the warm strawberry jam in the center blends well with the taste of the cookie itself.  I baked mine for 9 minutes and it made for a very soft cookie.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were super good; however I thought they might be a little bland as is, so I added 2 tsp almond extract and a 1/4 tsp salt. They were delicious and buttery!!  Will definitely make again!

Just okay.  The cookie itself was bland, too longer to bake, and it only make 2 dozen cookies not 3 like it says its supposed to.

I used this recipe as a base for a healthy twist recipe.  I suggest adding 1/2 tsp of each almond extract and vanilla extract for some flavor to the cookie.  My experiment was to create a cookie with a lot of omega-3 fatty acids, so, I used Smart Balance 50/50 butter/omega-3 sticks, omega-3 eggs, and I rolled my cookies in a mixture of finely ground walnuts and flaxseeds, both of which are high in omega-3s.  I also mixed chia seeds into my raspberry jam, you could also mix in flaxseeds into the jam to simulate fruit seeds to boost the omega-3s.  The version I made ended up having 660 mg of omega-3s per cookie, and they tasted great!

These were sooo good :) I remember my mom making cookis like this when I was little but until now I could nnever find a recipe like it, I'm so glad I did!  I added 1/2 tsp salt and 1 tsp vanilla but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I filled these with homemade raspberry jam (yummy....) and sprinkled them wih powdered sugar while they were still warm. They were lovely and golden brown on the bottom fter 10mins. Thanks for the recipe :)

I HATE giving a recipe a low star grade, but was I the only one that could not get the dough to unite? I had to add an extra egg and the rest of the stick of butter. Even after that it was still pretty crumbley. I was very pleased with how they came out, after sifting some powdered sugar over them like another reviewer suggested. I think otherwise they made have been too bland.

These are absolutely delish! Have made them several times including this past Christmas. I do add just a very small pinch of salt and 1 tsp vanilla, but they are fine without this as well it's just a personal preference. I usually double the recipe as they do not make as many as it says.   Delicious!!

My new favorite Christmas cookie! No adjustments needed. They came out perfect every time. I tried the Raspberry Almond Shortbread Thumbprint cookie recipe on this site but these were much better! I might try adding almond extract next time but they are very good as is.

Very easy.  My 11 year old son made these, and they were perfect.  He used a sour cherry preserve for the filling.

Love these cookies.  Reminds me of the kind my mother used to baked when I was little.  I added vanila extract as suggested by another reviewer.  Also, I will definitely double the recipe next time.  This amount only fills one cookie sheet.

Made these today - they're excellent cookies. Delicate texture, nice buttery flavor. And very easy. I used seedless blackberry jam that I made this past summer and it's a perfect contrast to the cookie base.

I have been making this recipe for a couple of years and I always get compliments.  I make them with black raspberry jam, apricot preserves & red raspberry jam.  All winners.  I sprinkle with confect sugar.  I did follow one reviewers note one time and added salt..........I did not like that at all.  But I always add a teaspoon of vanilla per batch.  Excellent cookie and my go-to for cookie exchanges.

These cookies were good, but I agree with another reviewer that the cookie (without the preserve) is a little bland. I wish I had read her review before baking them she says that some salt and vanilla extract and they turned great. I will add these next time. As suggested, I use a sandwich bag to add the preserve.

Like other reviewers that rated low, I followed this recipe exactly and my cookies were flatter than flat.  I could not remove them from the cookie sheet without them falling apart.  Also, I was extremely grossed out by the fact that they were "frying" in butter upon removing them from the oven.  I get that they are BUTTER cookies, but overall, I was not impressed with this recipe.  Maybe I'll try some baking powder and a little less butter next time.

Fast and delicious! I did add 2 tsp vanilla to the dough, as a previous reviewer suggested, then filled them with pear vanilla butter and sifted powdered sugar mixed with a couple dashes of cinnamon over the tops right when they came out of the oven. Also replaced sugar with Splenda. Had to bake them a touch longer than 10 min.  My only suggestion would be to definitely double the batch!  I only got 32 cookies out of the recipe, and they're such cute, delicious little morsels that you can't eat just one!

I love this recipe! I used my cookie press and made jam filled flowers. I didn't post a picture because i've never used a cookies gun/press ever and they were not pretty! But delicious! Will be a simple go to recipe, Thanks!

These cookies are great!  I liked them much more than I thought since I'm not crazy about preserves...  I altered the recipe by adding 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla and 1/4 teaspoon salt like other reviewers suggested.  Next time I'll add 1 teaspoon vanilla instead.  Fantastic!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

These are the perfect cookie. You cannot go wrong. I add 2 teaspoons of vanilla and 1/4 teaspoon salt to the dough and have used all sorts of jams, most recently seedless blackberry. I make 16 30-ounce balls and they barely make it off the baking sheet; it's always a good idea to double this one. It's a total crowd pleaser.

these were very tasty! I made them for a dinner party with the theme "5 ingredients or less", and they dissappeared super quick.  I made two batches, one with strawberry preserves, the other with apricot preserves.   Didn't make any substitutions.   I do recommend checking them frequently though, I followed the times and mine got burnt underneath, so even though the top might not look golden brown, the bottom might be done.

These were awesome! and so versatile! You could add so many different fillings and they'd still be delicious. The cookie itself goes from lightly brown to burnt in seconds so keep a close eye on them.

These are scrumptious! I've tried it with many different jams, but I liked tart ones best such as black currant. I also tried adding a bit of cream cheese to them and it was great! Super recipe and so easy!

I was looking for jam thumb print cookies that were quick and easy and this fit the bill perfectly.  I had no problems with the dough.  I added a teaspoon of almond extract since a few reviews said the cookie was bland.  I was a little light on the jam since I was worried about overflow but overall definitely worth making again.

I loved these, and thank you for the advice: "Take sandwich bag and spoon the jam into the bottom of the bag. Massage slightly to get lumps out. Make a small snip in the bottom of the bag so you can squeeze out the jam into the holes in the dough. I used seedless blackberry jam..great choice!! I topped baked cookies with a coat of sifted powdered sugar." Very Very Good : )

Delicious.  However I had to do this in shifts, and for whatever reason the second half of my batch became crumbly and would not cooperate.  Although, the first batch that did come out was delicious - I modified by doubling the recipe, and adding salt and vanilla.  Next time I would use less flour, as I think that is the reason my cookies were crumbly.  As other reviewers mentioned I filled a baggie with the filling and had my 5 year old thumbprint all cookies, while I easily filled the holes.

This recipe made extremely good cookies. Not my all time favorite cookie but a very very good one. I didn't have preserves so I just used the jelly I had. It still tasted wonderful. I had to bake them a tad bit longer than the recipe called for, but that wasn't a problem. I love that the next day the cookies are still a tiny bit soft, I hate it when cookies get super hard in a day or two. I will make this recipe again.

Wonderful recipe!  Very simple to make and I used four types of jam: strawberry, grape, raspberry, and hot pepper raspberry!  They came out beautifully and unfortunately, didn't last long!

These are a holiday favorite for my family! I rated 4 stars only b/c I felt that the recipe wasn't accurate. My dough called for more flour.  (I would say it amounted to about an extra half cup or so of flour.) Otherwise, I found that the cookies went flat in the oven. Also, I usually add ~1 tsp vanilla extract for the cookies I fill with raspberry jam and ~ 3/4 tsp almond extract for the cookies I fill with apricot jam. I also like to sprinkle some with shredded coconut flakes before jamming.

Very good! I cooked my preserves and added 3 Tablespoons of raspberry jello for a little more sweetness and thickness, Sifting the seeds out. Dipped in confection sugar, adds a beautiful cookie yet delicious as it melts in your mouth.

I tried this recipe 2 times with the same results. My cookies completely flattened out and couldn't even be taken off the cookie sheet without falling apart. I tried the recipe a second time thinking maybe I didn't add the correct amount of flour. It was disaster again. A complete waste of time. I did notice that the recipe did not call for baking powder. I don't know if this made the difference. I gave it 2 stars because the idea of filling butter cookies with jam was a good idea. 

I ended up using my mothers old butter cookie recipe which was very similar but called for baking powder and vanilla and  almond extracts. They came out perfect and delicious. I did do the whole jam thing and they were great. I will stick to that recipe.

Awesome and Easy. I used Margarine instead of Butter so it didn't have that heavy flavor and I think that was the right choice. Also added a cap full of Vanilla Extract to the batter.

These turned out terrific.  I used cherry preserves and decided to add a little bit of fresh lemon juice to the dough to make them a little tangy.  I also added a splash of vanilla, a pinch of salt, and a little more flour to counteract the extra wet ingredients.  These will be a new addition to my holiday cookie platters.

Great! These cookies melt in your mouth yet still have a bit of crunch. I used white whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, added 1/2 cup of crushed roasted almonds, put 2 extra egg yolks, subbed cranberry sauce with the jam, and made a quick splash of milk to get a doughy texture. This is a great way to use up the leftover cranberry sauce from Thanksgiving dinner. My friends rave that these cookies are better than from the box. I'll take that as a compliment.

this recipe is great. I have made this many times but I can't seem to get the middle of the cookie to get done. I have decreased the temperature by 25 degrees (which is suggested) but the over all taste is great.

I have tried many butter cookie recipes from allrecipes.com, but this one is THE best! I used Apricot and Raspberry preserves for the centers and they are delicious! I doubled the recipe and made aproximately 4 dozen cookies. Thanks for sharing this recipe, I will definitely use it again!

Thanks for the recipe. Mine turned out great! I followed other reviewers' advice and omitted the almond extract while doubling the vanilla extract. I used a cookie dough scoop and the batch yielded 20 cookies. I will definitely make these again and again. Thanks again!

Very good!  Exactly whatI was looking for!  My husband and kids LOVED them!  I used raspberry preserves, and they turned out beautifully!  My daughter had fun helping me put the thumbprint on the, and then filling them with jam for me.  This recipe will go in my recipe box.

So easy and so good!  I came across this recipe over the holidays and it is now a must have in my house!  As others suggested, adding vanilla or almond extract makes them even better (I used about 1 tsp).  Otherwise, I follow the recipe as is with perfect results every time.

I wish I would have found this recipe before Christmas.  It's so easy to make and delicious.  Be sure to roll and indent the dough carefully and the cookies will turn out picture perfect.  I also suggest using good quality jam that isn't overly sweet.  I'll definitely be making these cookies next Christmas!

i love this cookie! i use strawberry jam (my favorite) and sometimes guava jam, too, for a more exotic flavor.  like the others suggested, i also added some almond essence for a yummy smelling cookie. turned out great! i've given away these cookies to all my friends for valentines, sprinkled wth confectioner's sugar on top. they loved it!

These were a HUGE hit and very easy to make.  I made a double batch and got approximately 110 cookies.  I filled them with strawberry and seedless blackberry jam and already have requests for next year.  You HAVE to use real butter though.  It is what gives the cookie dough its rich taste.  Thank you, BakingNut.

I wish I would have read all of the reviews before making these. They are very tasteless...with the exception of the jam. I tried this as an alternative to Mrs. Fields jam filled cookies...big mistake. I am out of time to re-bake these cookied, and add vanilla, or something with flavor. Very disappointed.

Dough can be problematic, but the end result was wonderful.  If you're going for more of a "cookie" rather than "tea biscuit", rolling in granulated sugar before baking and sprinkling with powdered sugar afterwards seems to be key.

these cookies are ab-fab! i added both vanilla and almond extract, skipped the salt and used a cherry preserve.  i also doubled the recipe based on the other reviews. it yielded just about fifty.  my dog thinks they are pretty good too and wishes more would drop onto the kitchen floor!

Excellent recipe! I've made these for work and parties several times and everyone loves them.  I like to add either a teaspoon of almond extract OR lemon extract to the dough mixture for a different flavor.  It goes over really well!

This recipe was so scrumptous and buttery they were so good you didn't need the jam to compliment the cookie.  Plus they were so easy to make, I think people were having problems with them being dry because they didn't use butter, but I made them just the way the recipe said and they were great THANKS this one is a keeper!!!!

My husband and I thought these were just okay. When I was making them, the dough was a little too sticky, it made it hard to make a well in the center. I even refridgerated it as suggested and added a little bit more flour. That helped but not enough. Even so, I was looking forward to trying them because of all the great reviews but was a little disappointed with the taste. We thought they looked really pretty and festive, especially dusted with powdered sugar but the overall taste was kind of bland. I think we only ate about two or three in the whole batch.

These cookies are so simple and very tasty!  I added 1/2 t. almond extract and used about 1/4 t. of seedless preserves (apricot, blackberry & strawberry) per cookie.  Also, I'm not sure if it was necessary (my dough was not difficult to handle) but I put my cookies in the refrigerator for 5-10 minutes prior to baking after I had the jelly in place.  

This was my first attempt at thumbprint cookies and it couldn't have been easier.

My batches turned out so buttery and moist.  I baked the cookies so that they were golden brown on the bottom.  NOTE:  they were still soft to the touch so I wasn't sure if they were done until I checked the bottoms.  They firmed up as they cooled but still remained very moist.

The taste is that of shortbread, buttery and not too sweet.  The jelly and almond extract flavors go wonderfully!

I would imagine these would also be good rolled in chopped nuts or coconut before the thumbprint step or even with icing piped on top (instead of jelly) once baked.

This one DEFINITELY a keeper!  YUM!

Superb cookie! After poking a hole in to the cookie and filling w/ jam, I put the cookies into the refrigerator for about 10 minutes... I had no issues w/ the cookies speading. The only change I made was adding 1/8 tsp of vanilla to the dough.

I don't undertand the mixed reviews on this cookie. All I can figure from the "too dry comments" was they used margarine instead of real butter. Definately better with the real butter. I added a little vanilla to mine, about 2 tsp. My husband became a big kid when I made these and refused to eat his dinner....needless to say I had two of the dozens of cookies I made. Very good recipe.

Definitely a keeper!  They were easy to make and came out deliciously.  Unfortunately, I did overfill the wells in the first batch, but it didn't affect the flavor at all -- they were just a little messy.  I'll be trying one of the other reviewer's tip of piping the jam in with a corner-snipped sandwich bag.

This was a quick and easy recipe.  But it taste more like something you would have in the morning.  More like a biscuit with jam.  They were good, just not what I was expecting.

Wow- these are easy to make and my husband and kids loved these!  Minimal effort and mess, but great result!

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out very tasty.  I was only able to make 20 out of this batch, but my cookies were big.

I used this recipe as a base, but I made several changes: I used 1/4 butter and 1/2 cup peanut butter; 1/2 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar. I also added a little extra flour and baked them at 350--I was afraid 375 would be too high on my oven.

Very good recipe overall, but to get optimal results, I found that putting it in at 360 degrees for 15 minutes got better results.

These flatten a bit because of the butter, so make them small.  Also, the recipe doesn't yield 3 dozen if you make them into 1-in balls.  I used a 1-in scoop and only got 2 dozen.  I suggest making a double batch, then you can eat any ugly ones and still have 3 dozen beautiful cookies.

I added the 1/2 tsp of salt and 1 tsp of vanilla as suggested by other reviews, but I always add a little extra salt and vanilla to what I cook, so it may not be necessary for everyone.

I like to fill these with seedless raspberry jelly and sift a little bit of powdered sugar over the top while they are cooling.  I pur the jelly into a small bowl and use two spoons to scoop smoe up and then slide it off into the cookie.

Very easy to make and very delicious!  I did add 2 t of vanilla extract, and 1/4 t of salt and put it in the refridgerator for 30 min before shaping the dough which made it very easy to handle.

Very good and very easy to make.  It just came out a little too buttery for my taste but that might just be a personal preference.  Will cut down on the butter a little bit the next time.  They were a big hit at my office Christmas party though!

Wow, yummy!!  I subbed one whole egg for the 2 yolks, and added a bit of vanilla.  The dough was a little tough to work with, but I can't complain since I didn't really follow the recipe exactly.  I kept the dough in the fridge right before rolling the little balls and that helped a lot.  I used raspberry preserves.  Hubby said they are just like the Pepperidge Farm cookies.  :)

Eh, these cookies are just OK.  I added vanilla as suggested in one of the reviews below.  Perhaps this is why?  I used a gourmet jam which tasted great, but the cookie vehicle didn't compliment the jam innards.  I'm going to keep looking for a good thumbprint cookie recipe.

Awesome melt-in-your-mouth cookie. The only change I made was to add a splash of Vanilla extract to give it a little something extra. Other than that, just play around with the different jams.

This cookie was EXCELLENT!  So simple yet so yummy...  I used sweet orange marmalade in some and blueberry preserves in others (what I had on hand).  I then lightly drizzled the cookies with some melted white chocolate chips (can use vanilla almond bark) that I had left over.  You could also just dust with a little powdered sugar or leave plain.  My kids LOVED the orange marmalade the best!  The blueberry was ok, but a little too sweet.  Strawberry and raspberry would also be great!

Based on other reviews I added 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp salt. The base is quite similar to shortbread. They're not really my thing (I prefer chocolate). Next time I will use a sweeter jam as all I had on hand was all natural stuff with no added sugar.

I thought with just a few ingredients, how good could they be? Well their really good and so easy to make! I just got jars of homemade jelly and jams from the neighbor so i put it to good use. I put raspberry in half and grape in the other. My husband is NOT a sweet eater but he loved them.

few ingredients, easy to make.  Versatile in that you can fill with many different things - including hershey's kisses.  Somehow, I never got them small enough to make 36, (or maybe I ate too much dough!), and the dough didn't spread all that much for me, even that I only used 1 1/2 cups flour.  I did end up with round cookies, so I guess I should have flattened them a bit before baking.  I added lemon extract to the dough, and filled with lemon curd.  I burned my mouth trying to eat one too quick, but they are very good!

Very good, few ingredients and easy to make.  I even made my own lemon curd to use in half the recipe.  I use half whole wheat flour and half white spelt so they aren't too brown. Rolled the balls in granulated sugar and flattened them a little. Spread the jam flat, it doesn't flatten itself in baking.

Yum... soooooooo good and so easy.  I replaced the sugar with a little less than a 1/4 cup of stevia.  I also used smart balance life and 1 cup whole wheat flour and 3/4 white.   I used apricot preserves and they were gone within and hour.

For Jam-Filled Cookies, these are really good. I love the low number of ingredients. My 3 year old helped me with these from beginning to end and then gave them to his friends (after we ate half). We'll use this recipe again.

These were OK. They were tasty, but very buttery and too delicate to transport/freeze. I used blackberry and apricot preserves.

I made this cookie exactly as written and it was "okay" at best.  I like jam-filled cookies but the cookie itself was underwhelming.  Kinda bland, missing something... maybe the vanilla other reviewers added, or salt?  Dunno... would try again, however, with the added vanilla and salt.  They WERE easy to make and fun.

I've made these cookies 3 times now, and they come out absolutely delicious each time. My boyfriend doesn't have a sweet tooth, but he really likes these cookies because they have complementary flavors: the richness and light saltiness of the butter cookie (without it being heavy) and the light fruity sweetness of the jam. The 3rd time, I've actually also tried sprinkling some power sugar on the butter cookie part for a little more sweetness, and they're delicious like that too!

These cookies are very good!  I added a dash of almond flavoring to mine, and used strawberry jam with a light dusting of powdered sugar at the end.  Perfect crispness on the outside and soft on the inside.  Mine flattened out a little bit after baking.  They looked like the picture before baking, but flattened a bit afterwards.  I did refrigerate the dough for about 10 minutes and it was very easy to work with.  I made a double recipe and they are very good!!!

Ok - two parts to this cookie; first, I made a batch and had a terrible time with the dough. It was very crumbly and didn't stick together at all - I added a little water and that solved that problem. Then the choice of jam for the cookie filler was terrible...once baked, it tasted like old communion wine. It ran all over the cookie sheet.
Secondly; the recipe made enough to refrigerate so I tried again the net day with a different kind of jam. This turned out well. The cookies were dry and not sweet but the strawberry sat much better with this lighter cookie than the original blackberry I had used. I recommend for tea and milk and coffee.

Very tasty and not too difficult.  The only problem was that despite refrigerating the dough before forming and baking, my cookies went flat.  That's disappointing in a thumbprint type cookie, but they were still good. I added lemon flavoring and used lemon curd instead of jam (from the easy microwave recipe on this site)--delicious!

I happened across this recipe on the 23rd and made them on the 24th....my 14 year old son taste tested them for me and they were a huge hit.

I added a teaspoon of vanilla like others suggested and also dusted them with powdered sugar when they came out of the oven.  

These will be a household favorite for years to come.

THANKS SO MUCH FOR SHARING THE RECIPE.

These were awesome!! I did what others said w/ the powdered sugar on some, others I rolled in green colored sugar w/ strawberry jam and they looked wonderful on my plate of Christmas cookies. I did reduce the flour just slightly and didn't have a probem with the cookies cracking. I will make these again!!

I rolled these in crushed pecans, which worked well.  Only thing is, I feel like I've had butter cookies with finer texture and richer flavor.  Still, a very good cookie with a nice twist; next time I will try it with raspberry and apricot jam!

These were fantastic!  Very easy to make, and so delicious.  They have a light buttery texture, and the jam adds just enough sweetness that offsets the cookie just perfectly.  I will be making these every Christmas, as well as throughout the year!

These were excellent!  I did not have enough butter in the house, so I substituted the equivalent in Butter Flavored Crisco.  Also, I wanted to add a dash of vanilla as suggested by others.  I was out of that too, so I added a tsp of almond extract.  Despite not being fulled prepared with all the exact ingredients, the cookies still turned out awesome with a few substitutions!  I also sprinkled the cookies with powdered sugar fresh out of the oven and used 4 different kinds of jam for variety. They are great!

Something didn't translate. I must have done something wrong because my cookies flattened like pancakes in the oven instead of looking like the traditional thumbprint cookies, as shown in the picture. I tried a few that weren't completely flattened and they tasted good. The dough was hard to work with, very crumbly and sticky when rolled in a ball. It helped when I let the dough chill for a bit first. I used apple jelly and colored half of it red, the other half green for Christmas. Since they were pretty yummy, I shall try to remake them and see if they bake better.

I did like them but I think they need more sugar to be sweeter or something. I might dip them in sugar next time as someone suggested. However they were really easy to make and looked nice.

I love this recipe! First time i've ever made this cookie and it turned out so good i made two batches the same day. I used tips from other people and added tsp of vanilla, wet my thumb so the dough wouldn't stick and sprinkled powdered sugar on the cookies when they came out of the oven. I also used regular blackberry jelly and homemade strawberry jam and although both delicious i perferred the homemade jam flavor more. I will continue to make these easy,yummy cookies from now on.

Super simple, super delicious and they looked pretty as an added bonus.  I rolled the cookie in sugar colored to match the jam.  They were a hit at Thanksgiving...some with apricot preserves, and some with very chunky cherry preserves.  Highly recommended.

These butter cookies, accompanied by your favorite jam, are melt in your mouth delicious!  I filled my cookies with apple and strawberry jam, and they were scrumptuous.  The only thing I didn't like about these cookies, were the little cracks around the edges...but hey, I guess it gives them that rustic look!

Excellent cookies. They were very easy to make and the dough kept well in the fridge for a couple of days. I used 5 different kinds of jams, and they came out very festive and colorful.

These  were  pretty on my holiday platter, but  I  did not think  they  were  the most  flavorful.  Maybe  I should have added more  jam.

These were ok,They came out pretty enough, I wish I had sugar crystals to roll them in, they would've been prettier for my holiday cookie platter. I did add vanilla extract as recommended, made the dent with my finger, had no problem with sticky dough, baked on parchment,a very scant 1/2 tsp of jam is all that fits. I think they do taste a tiny bit eggy. They are nice in addition to other cookies but I wouldnt make them as a stand alone-no wow factor.

Very good cookie.  Most of the taste comes from the preserves used to fill the thumbprint so buy the best that you can.

Well, sadly I was not too impressed with these cookies. I even added some vanilla to the dough, but these were bland. Used raspberry jelly for some tartness.

Oh My God!!! This are melt in your mouth good, I had to call my mom to come and get them so I would not eat them all.
I only got two dozen though and I did not make them very big at all.
Well don't just think about making these get baking.

These cookies were a hit at a gathering I hosted.  It was the first time I made them and they were so easy.  I recommend at least doubling the recipe because the cookies are petite and most people ate more than a few.  I'll make these often.

Made a trial run of these cookies today for a bake sale on Friday.  They are a keeper!  The only problem that I had was the batter turned out crumbly which I'm sure was my fault.  I added a little water and then it was fine.  Thanks for sharing! :)

One of the best cookies I have ever tasted! They are perfect, buttery and melty with just the right amount of sweetness. I did add about 1/2 tsp. of vanilla, but they would be great without it.

I really liked this.  Unfortunately, as I am 16, I messed it up the first time, and put egg WHITE!  Big, stupid mistake.  But the second time, it was a lot better.  I also put chocolate pudding in the middle and it turned out quite well.

Perfect! Followed the recipe exactly and they are better than anything store bought. I baked them the full 10 minutes and I had to put them out of sight or I would have eaten the whole plate of them.

This is an amazing recipe!!  The cookies come out so soft and perfect, with an awesome flavor. I love the fruit inside the cookie. It's a perfect cookie recipe. And it's so easy to make! I just happen to always have the ingredients around the house. Will most definately make these again and again!

This recipe turned out well on the first try! I only added a little bit of almond extract for flavor. The cookies don't really brown when they are all the way cooked, so be careful not to overbake! They were really good though.

They had a buttery sugary taste. I used strawberry preserves. The only problem was getting a uniform appearance and fitting the preserves into those little holes. Overall it was a good cookie!

These are so yummy but do require some patience when forming the balls.  They will come together as the dough warms in your hands.  I used just a cheaper brand of strawberry jelly and warmed it in the microwave first as it was dense in texture. My daughter loved the whole thumb print process.  THey did crack slightly during breaking but they ended up kind of looking like flowers with the jam filled centre.  Will definately make these again.

Simple and delicious.  I usually make double chocolate cookies, but I had to serve someone who was allergic to chocolate and these cookies really came through!  Good with any kind of preserves/jam.  Thanks for sharing.

These are my husband's favorite - we call them "thumb cookies". I make them with egg substitute - Yummy!
