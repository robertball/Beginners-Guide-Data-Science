What a great casserole!!  I was nervous about it being a microwave dish - I'm so used to cooking casseroles in the stove oven.  But it turned out great!  I couldn't find Gouda cheese so I bought a 7 oz. package of Feta cheese and a package of shredded Mozzarella cheese.  I used the Feta cheese for the first step of paragraph 3. Then I used 1 cup of the shredded Mozzarella for the final step. Very good!  Also, one suggestion:  I stirred the pasta/zucchini combination several times in the colander so as to not let the pasta get rubbery.  Thanks for a keeper!!

This is a fine recipe that delivers as advertised.  You could add a little black pepper or Cajun seasoning to spice it up a bit.

This is sooooo easy.  It took me less than the 50 minutes to complete.  It turns out creamy and cheesy and a great change in the way you use your zucchini.  I used my stove top for everything except cooking the zucchini.  I would make this again.  Thanks.

Excellent recipe! I used half the butter to reduce the fat and it still turned out rich and creamy. I also replaced the milk with almond milk which added some nice flavor and traded the Gouda for shredded Italian cheeses! Love how quick and easy this recipe is!

I made exactly as instructed and thought it was pretty good. Next time I will add some red bell pepper for more color and crunch. My vegetarian guest put hot sauce on his and really liked it.

Quick to make, easy, and tasty!  We used Gouda and Goudam cheeses, and the flavor was fabulous.  I made the mistake of not dumping out the water after steaming the zucchini, so it was a little more soup-like.  Great flavor.  Everybody loved it, and so we didn't have any left over for lunch today.

This recipes was very quick and easy to make. The recipe says that it will be ready in 50 minutes, but it was more like 25 minutes! I added an extra cup of noodles and added pepper. I did not have enough basil so I added parsley. It could use a little more seasonings, but for a basic meal it was delicious and cheap! I cooked everything on the stop top except the zucchini, but next time I think that will saute the zucchini with onions, mushrooms, and garlic.

This is very yummy!!! We added a can of chicken because my husband LOVES meat and while it was yummy, it didn't need the chicken.  We will make this one again.  We also used Monterrey Jack cheese instead of Gouda.

This was a really great recipe to use up some of our zucchini without the seemingly typical red sauce dish.  It was very creamy and both my husband and I enjoyed it.  We crumbled bacon on top and that was a great addition.  I did not have any mushroons.  I would make this again with the bacon.
