Excellent!  Did not have canned potatoes, so after cooking up the onions, I added the water and sliced up some potatoes and brought up to boil to give them a chance.  Followed instructions for the rest.  I love it.  Thanks!

VERY GOOD! New favorite way to eat leftover turkey from thanksgiving, especially using dark meat. Very similar to bbq pulled pork. First off I used a 4quart slow cooker 2hrs on high and 5hrs on low. Next, while making it, I felt like it had too much water. Instead of 6 cups I used only 2. I also added an extra 1/2cup bbq sauce. This made it thicker and more like stew than soup. Also I added 1 whole diced green pepper and 1 whole diced red pepper. I also just diced the onions and chucked them in the crock pot instead of cooking them first. I didn't use the food processor and it took about 30min to prepare. Very Very Very delicious. Will definitely cook again.

This is super!  I love Brunswick stew but pulled pork is hard to come by around here.  I had leftover turkey from Thanksgiving and came across this recipe.  So glad I did!!!  I did change a few things...I used fresh potatoes instead of canned.  I just made sure I cooked it long enough to ensure they were done.  I added about a teaspoon of chili powder and some garlic salt.  Next time I will only put about half the vinegar in.  This is totally wonderful!  I will be enjoying this leftover leftover turkey brunswick stew for many meals!

The flavors are great! I used Yukon Gold potato, and lots of frozen corn.  I probably added 5 cups turkey. The house smells wonderful, and the broth is yummy. I would definitely make this again.

As a North Carolina native, I have to say this is a great recipe, very similar to the stews served in local bbq places.  I have made it with pulled pork as well.  I added some frozen lima beans about halfway through cooking time, and left out the salt, as well as using fresh potatoes.  Delicious!

I've never made Brunswick Stew and I had lots of turkey from T-Day. I use this recipe as a starting point. I changed the serving size to 5. So I changed a few things up. I used 'Hunts Fire Roasted Tomatoes' & 'Tomatoes w/Green Chilies & Garlic'. Also use Chicken Stock instead of water, as well as Apple Cider Vinegar. I also use a half a bottle of the BBQ instead of 1/2 a cup & 1/8 of Worcestershire. Overall this recipe lead to a GREAT Brunswick Stew, even If it was turkey.

Loved it!  Very easy to make, excellent use of leftovers from the holidays.  We're expecting a baby this week, and this recipe gave us plenty of food to freeze.

I didn't like this stew. 
It tastes like a condiment stew, especially since I was the one who emptied all the condiments into the stew pot.
I couldn't even taste the turkey.

On the other hand, my husband liked it. He did say that he didn't think he'd want to have me make it again, but he ate it, and he'll eat the leftovers.

Good way to create a totally new flavor for your leftover turkey. It was tasty but disagreed with our stomachs just a little. Next time I would halve the recipe but keep the amount of turkey the same - it could use more meat proportionally but this recipe was bigger than my largest pot could accommodate. Definitely more than 10 servings. (P.S. as in previous reviews I used fresh but pre-boiled potatoes instead of canned)

Awesome, great use of leftover turkey.  Did use 3 medium Russett potatoes, Kraft original bbq sauce, no ketchup, one can diced tomatoes and one with green chiles.   Used one can of creamed corn and leftover whole kernel corn.

Simple and good use for the leftovers. I've used other meats in place of the turkey outside of the holidays. And it's still just as good!

Crowd pleaser for sure at my house. I used turkey broth instead of water, apple cider vinegar instead of white, and I used bacon fat instead of butter for the onions. That's pretty much it.

This stew tasted extremely vinegary.  Maybe if I hadn't use the called-for vinegar it would have been better.  My kids would not eat it at all.  I had it for two meals to avoid wasting it, but couldn't eat it again after that.  The recipe used up all of our leftover turkey so it really was a waste.

This was just like I remembered . I used a slow cooked Boston butt and shredded the meat. The best I've ever made. Added just a little more bite on the hot sauce but it was great.

I used leftover turkey from thanksgiving and a sirloin tip we grilled. I like my Brunswick stew smoky and spicy rather than sweet so I put  2 tablespoons of liquid smoke, hot sauce and webers spicy bbq (my favorite) for the most part followed the rest of the directions. I think most people forget it's ok to personalize your flavor and use a recipe as a reference rather than a holy grail. Whole family enjoyed the stew!

We substituted fresh potatoes for the canned. We added frozen corn and lima beans and used green chili diced tomatoes. The stew started in the crock pot on high. We moved the stew to a stock pot when we added sliced green and red peppers and the frozen veggies  after the potatoes softened a bit ( a couple of hours). We simmered the stew another hour or so and it was perfect.
