Good basic recipe.  I prefer Bourbon to Vodka for making vanilla.  I also split my beans and scraped the pulp out and put that in the bottle along with the beans.  It adds nice flecks to the extract.  You still have a slight Bourbon flavor but that is a plus for me.  If you don't want that then I suggest you use Vodka.  If the vanilla flavor is not as strong as you would like you can let it stand another few weeks.  I used all the beans that I bought as it came in a package with 12 beans.  Makes a nice addition to a home made items gift basket.
