The first thing you will experience is the incredible smell that will fill your kitchen.  The second will be the delicious meal you will have.  The flavors were incredible.  I used fresh basil and rosemary and increased the Marsala and chicken broth.  I wouldn't increase the liquids next time just because it doesn't thicken up at all.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe and truly enjoyed it.

To be fair I did not make this recipe as written.  Chicken Marsala is a staple in my house.  The first thing I do is saute the mushrooms in butter and remove to a dish. I use checken tenderloins.  To save time I put seasoned flour in a plastic baggie and shake to coat.  I sauté the chicken in a mixture of 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 butter.  When chicken is lightly browned on both sides, remove the chicken to a plate.  I add one head of garlic (chopped) to the pan.  When golden, pour in Marsala, scrape the sides and bottom of pan to incorporate the flavors, and cook down a bit.  Add 1 cup chicken broth, stir, and return chicken to the pan.  Add the mushrooms and cover the pan. Cook for a few minutes until chicken is cooked through.  Sprinkle with a tablespoon of chopped pasely and serve immediately.

More like a 10!!! This recipe might have started as a '5', but the more I make it, the better it is. For my family, I have learned to double the whole recipe, only with more mushrooms!! If you think the tomatoes and the rosemary seem out of place, please, please, please use them and you will see how the flavors simply meld when all is done!! I am celiac and simply use gluten-free flour, wiping the over-browned flour from the pan before adding more butter and sautéing the rest of the chicken. Carrabbas is one of my faves, but this recipe out-shines their marsala!! Thanks for a true winner.

This was excellent!!! I did not have any wine on hand so I substituted 1/4 cup Pomagranate Juice (I had it in the fridge). My chicken turned out super moist and bursting with flavor!! I did everything else according to recipe and served on top multi-colored couscous. I will definately be making this again soon!!

Pretty good, I suggest buying a more expensive Marsala Wine to use, mine was OK, but it was the only one they had at the store. A better wine would have made this dish better for me, not the recipes fault!

This is a keeper!!!!  It came out great.  Easy to make.  I left out the mushrooms because I don't like them and used a larger tomato instead.  I cooked it in an electric fry pan.

Overall this was a great recipe! I took some of the recommendations to heart. I am a garlic lover, so used about 7 cloves of garlic. My husband is a mushroom lover, so I used about 2 cups. I did double the liquid amounts as someone else had reported trying, but with a sprinkle of flour before the addition of liquid to butter,  I thought it thickened up very well. 

I served it with garlic /Parmesan mashed potatoes. Family says its s keeper! 

 One change I think I will try next time is that I will grill my chicken before adding it to the sauce. I just love the flavor that grilling adds!

I used boneless skinless thighs and breasts and was so happy with the results. I didn't change anything in the recipe, and my family and I loved it.  A definite keeper!

Recipe is okay in terms of the basics of Chicken Marsala. However, IMHO, 1/4 cup of mushrooms is about 8 times too few. I also use a full cup of Marsala and season the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, garlic powder, AND tarragon  that I sauté in butter and olive oil -- which gives this an awesome flavor. I do not include tomato. I serve over Jasmine rice.

Not a bad recipe but I have to comment on Luv2ook version, which in my opinion is spot on. And please folks, don't buy the grocery store Marsala that is in the condiment section---taste is everything so get a good bottle of dry Marsala at the liquor store.

recipe as cooked was really bland.....will definitely require you to "tweak" it. start with more mushrooms and MORE garlic, fresh herbs and corn starch instead of the flour...also make sure you have a really good wine.

This is a good chicken dish, but the addition of basil, rosemary, and tomatoes changed it to be closer to a Saltimbocca sauce than traditional Marsala sauce. The sauce is basic, not nearly enough mushrooms or garlic, and there is just no wow factor to the dish at all.

I've made this three times - each time by the recipe.  Each time it was delicious, and everyone enjoyed it very much.  Twice I prepared it a few hours ahead of time and let it sit, reheating just before dinnertime.  This little bit of "aging" seemed to marry the ingredients.  Excellent recipe!

I only increased the mushrooms and cut the butter in half but added a tablespoon or so of olive oil.  It was yummy!

Very good recipe;I make more sauce by making another roux after sautéing all the chicken and then add as much broth as you need.A friend told me to try a little lemon so I did.Very tasty.I left out the tomato because that's just not Marsala.

I do feel a quarter cup of mushrooms is way to little, about 8 ounces for 2 pounds of chicken would be better. When I make this dish, I brush the chicken with olive oil, generously season with salt, pepper and Italian herbs and where possible grill on the bbq, it adds so much more flavour. Also add some shallots while frying the garlic.

I followed the exact recipe but at the end I would have preferred the sauce to be thicker. So I sprinkled in a little more flour and added 2 tbsp of sour cream; thickened it right up. Also I added sun-dried tomatoes for a little kick.

This is a VERY tasty recipe.  But.......it must be fattening with all the butter.  It's a splurge meal in our household.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was GREAT.  Served over butter noodles.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is 4 stars - but if you want a 5-star recipe - look up Chef John's Chicken Marsala.
Similar, but not the same. Absolutely the best! Penny S

It would seem that the chicken cutlets would be cooked just by the 3-5 minute per side browning.  Why do you have to cook another 30 minutes?  That may toughen them…Please tell me if you did not do that step.

Made exactly as written other than doubling the mushrooms, and it was completely tasteless.  I'm not sure where the flavor went.  The tomatoes and mushrooms were almost non-existent after 30 minutes of cooking.  It was just chicken....no marsala flavor, basil or rosemary.  It just tasted like chicken.

Tried this last night and absolutely loved it. Have a hard time getting my husband to eat chicken, but he gobbled this right up. So easy and so delicious.

Turned out great... instead small tomato used petit Hunts and did it in layers....also used more Basil and Rosemary , brought to boil lowered temp to low and simmered for 25 minutes..... made a greater improvement on tenderness !!! Flavor was intense !!!

My husband really loved this!  I agree with those reviewers who suggested that doubling  the mushrooms would be great. I will also use Marsala wine rather that cooking wine and thicken the sauce next time. I gave this a 5-star rating  because my husband raved about it and the suggestions were more personal preferences. I did enjoy it.

Have made this dish a couple dozen times now, usually doubling the recipe even though I'm only cooking for 2 because it's that darn good. I've learned that just cutting the chicken into bite size pieces works best for us. Also, since I double the recipe I just use a can of diced tomatoes & a full pound of mushrooms and save some cutting time. Also, I use more salt and pepper nd pepper to taste as the broth brews. Last, we top with fresh grated parm and serve over penne instead of egg noodles. Just our preference. This recipe is most definitely a keeper.

I make chicken marsala for company occasionally because it does not take me away from guests and I can relax and enjoy people. I also saute my mushrooms first so as not to make them soft or rubbery.  I m making this tomorrow for company so it should be an enjoyable and yummy dinner.  Thanks so much for this recipe.
