I wish I could rave about this recipe like the rest of you.  I had no luck with it and I'm a veteran baker of cakes!  I followed the directions to the "t" as well,(with the exception of one thing) even went out and purchased all new ingredients.  It totally collapsed on me when it was sitting in the pan for ten minutes before removal to the rack for cooling.  It was thick and heavy and tasted too sweet.  I had baked it as directed and checked with a toothpick, which came out clean.  I was very disappointed as this was an expensive cake to make.  I did make one change...used the regular Smart Balance instead of butter.  Smart Balance is supposed to be an equal substitute when baking.  I've never had a problem with it before.  This is the only thing that I could think of that could have caused this failure.

This cake was fantastic!!  The recipe was a bit confusing at step 4, since it never told when to add the remainder of the egg mixture.  The cake was heavy, a very solid cake, but sweet and buttery! 

I baked the cake in two bread pans, and reduced the time to 65 minutes.  I also made it with fat free sour cream, which certainly did not compromise the flavor.  I served it sliced with fresh strawberries and whipped cream.  My diabetic Grandmother loved it, as did everyone else!!

This was a good cake that I made for someone whose mom is diabetic. It turned out nice and moist. I did use regular splenda, not the blend but used a little less than the recipe called for and it was still good. thank you!

It was a great hit, I followed the instructions to the T. and everthing was just perfect. If I didn't tell my family it was made with Splenda, they would have always believed it was all sugar. I really recommend this cake

This is an excellent pound cake reminiscent of an old fashion pound cake. the only negative comment I have is that it is impossible to test for doneness using the traditional methods.  so cook the cake for the  full recommended time in the recipe.I have made this cake and added toasted pecans and also added black walnuts. Both are very good.

Turned out great.  I added 1/2 cup of nonfat milk powder, 1/2 t of baking powder and 1 t of vanilla and 1 t of almond extract.  Baked for about 50 min.

I'm giving it 3 stars because while it's a delicious cake, but there's too much fat with this recipe.   I modified this by substituting Omega 3 brand eggs (25% less fat), and low fat(NOT fat free) sour cream.  I left the butter because there is NO substitute for butter.  My grandmother LOVED it with my substitutions, and has been after me for more(it was her birthday cake).

I love this cake! It is quite heavy, but as a pound cake should be. Great flavor and you can serve it a million ways. I have made holes with a straw and poured sugar-free pudding of many flavors over the cake. Yummy
