overall very good. There was something that didn't add up with the recipe and the "how to make" video. But I modified from what I saw on the video when making this recipe. Recipe states to chop up the strawberries or use frozen, well the strawberries in the video seemed to be mashed, so I mashed my strawberries as well. I ended up using only 4 large croissants and my muffin wells were standard size and the amount of croissant pieces made actually 16 muffins and the cream cheese sauce managed to extend to all 16, I just had to add a little more strawberries to match. Overall, very nice. We really liked them.

I made this as a dessert in a 9"square baking dish because I thought the muffin cup way made them just too small. I also used blueberries and raspberries because that's what I had on hand. (Baked strawberries just aren't my thing.)  I thought it was excellent, not too sweet and somewhat custard like. I will definitively make this again.

Just ate these delish little cups!  Hubby and I loved them!
Mine didn't  look quite as pretty, but after powder sugar looked good.   
I used all 8oz. of cream cheese by error......still wonderful.
Cut back sugar to 1/4 c and 6 small croissants instead...... all worked out.  
Will make for brunch soon.......sure my company will love these different little treats.    Adjusted sugar was perfect!   So glad I tried, thanks!

Make it, but used frozen (defrosted) strawberries since I didn't have any fresh ones - everyone loved it.  It's not too sweet and the powder sugar on top makes a big difference in the taste.  The leftovers (which weren't many) we toasted up in the toaster oven and then added the powder sugar were also great!  Will make again, thanks for the recipe!
