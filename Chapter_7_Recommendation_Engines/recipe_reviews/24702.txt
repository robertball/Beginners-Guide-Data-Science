I used this recipe for a Champagne & Chocolate Bridal Shower.  Instead of placing the mixture in an 8x8 baking dish, I spooned it into a cookie press and used the star form.  They turned out so beautiful and tasted wonderful.  Our guests couldn't get enough.

This is delicious!  I only beat the chocolate mix once until really smooth and the batches I've made have turned out great.  Also, I put 2tsp of mint in the mix.  This recipe is also a great base for other chocolate combinations.  I've made a orange chocolate: 1.5 tsp of orange extract and 1/2tsp of vanilla.  My husband LOVES this one.

I made these today for Valentine's Day gifts.  Wow, they really do taste just like Russell Stover French chocolate mints!!  I took another reviewer's suggestion and dipped them in a good quality milk chocolate.  This was my first time tempering chocolate.  The directions are on this site - Melting and Tempering Chocolate.  It couldn't be easier and the results were very professional.  If you love French chocolate mints, this is the recipe for you. Will definately make again and again!  Thanks for posting this recipe!

Yummy.  This is not fudge, it's a mint.  I just beat it once and place it in the pan, all that other beating is too much work.  It still turns out great.

These came out really good!  I dipped half in dark chocolate and half in milk chocolate.  Next time I'll cut one row, then dip in chocolate, then cut some more, and dip, etc.  I cut them all at once.  The last mints that I dipped in chocolate dried just a bit on the sides (Denver is dry...) I recommend pure belgian chocolate for dipping, making the finished product look very smooth and  professional.  I put each one in it's own little mini paper cup, just like the candy factory does. The family LOVED them!!! I was asked, "You made these?!?!!!?" more than once.  Thanks for the recipe! :-)

These are amazing! Just like the mint melt-aways in the fancy candy shops. I subbed mint extract for the peppermint, and tripled it. I think it was better for the switch. This recipe actually makes about 100 pieces. I wrapped them in foil and twisted the ends. They were a big hit in my gift baskets.

I found this recipe about 7 years ago and I have been making them every Christmas.  My son says they are "mandatory".  These really are amazing...better than any fudge ever.  They are so creamy and smooth, and the mint is not overpowering at all.  We all love them.  When it comes time to leave them in the fridge and hand-beat every few minutes, leave the blade from your mixer in the bowl - it's so much easier to use than trying to do it with a wooden spoon! I highly recommend this recipe -- easy and fantastic.

I didn't have full milk chocolate, so I had to substitute for a little less than half with semi-sweet chocolate chips. Also, as per reviews, I added an extra teaspoon of peppermint extract. This was abslotely necessary!!!! For the Holidays you can melt white chocolate with red food coloring and green and drizzle over it. After they cooled, I melted more chocolate and spooned over them nicely. They looked very pretty and then on some I sprinkled some red or green sugar and some with little round sprinkles, they tasted good! Everyone loved them :)

These tasted very good - however, I would add a little bit more of the peppermint flavor, because they were lacking a little in the flavor.

Help!  I melted the chocolate over low heat, and it looked so pretty.  Oops, I forgot the butter.  No problem, I thought, I would just add it in now. As soon as I did that, my creamy chocolate melt started to solidify.  I have run into this problem before with chocolate fondue, and I have learned that more heat DOES NOT fix the problem.  So I took my lumpy mixture off the stove, quickly added the other ingredients and beat to hell until it was smooth.  Without any extra chilling, I dumped it (there was no pouring involved) onto the pan and coaxed it into a square level shape.  Does adding the butter after the fact really matter that much?  I don't even like mint chocolate, and I wanted to make these a gift to my husband for our anniversary coming up.  Perfection seems to matter a lot more when you are giving away what you are cooking.  I think they will taste okay, but I'm not sure what the texture will be like. :(

I don't know how to rate this recipe, because clearly I screwed it up somehow.

Absolutely delicious! I beat once, and followed others' suggestions to use more peppermint (2 tsp instead of 1). These were creamy and delectable!

I looked for years for a recipe to make French Mints at home. This is it! I made these for a chocolate caf√© party and they were one of the main attractions! Never losing this recipe.

My family adores the Fannie May mint meltaways and these are it.  But whatever you do please do not use mint extract use the peppermint extract that is called for.  I made the mistake one day and it was a fakey mint taste.  You need the peppermint taste like the York peppermint patties.  I also covered them in melted white chocolate mixed with a tiny amount green food coloring to give it that mint meltaway look.

I used only one bag of semi-sweet and one bag of milk chocolate, but every time I make these they come out perfect. I usually receive them for Christmastime as a counter to my Aunt's rich fudge. I also used an 11x7 pan instead. They are a little thinner that way. Great taste and easy to make.

I love this recipe! They came out creamy & delicious. My only suggestion would be to use good quality chocolate chips (the ones i=n the foil bag) & real butter. I will definitely make these again.

I ate these all the time growing up in Nebraska.  These also taste like Russell Stover's French Chocolate Mints.  I like the idea about dipping them in chocolate, and will try that next time.  I was so excited about finding this recipe.  Thanks!!

These are heavenly. Smooth and creamy. After being cut in squares, it sort of looks like fudge but is creamier than fudge. Made these in a glass pan. They were a little bit difficult to cut, but otherwise great. I will make these as often as I can.

Overall, these taste great! But I had some difficulty with the prep. I substituted cocoa and vegetable oil for the unsweetened chocolate, which I think was a mistake. When I mixed the ingredients, it turned into a thick, hard-to-mix glop and I wound up literally burning up the motor in my hand mixer trying to mix it.  The mixture eventually separated: part of it was an impossibly thick chocolate, and part was an oily, yellowish substance (the butter, maybe, or the butter and oil?). Since my mixer was dead, I had to beat it by hand, which didn't work at all.  I spread the mixture in the pan and chilled it, then cut it into 1/2" squares. They weren't pretty, but they tasted great, so I dipped them in dark chocolate. Yum.... I would make this again, but I would not substitute any ingredients and I would use a heavy-duty stand mixer instead of a hand mixer.

These  were a hit!  I did add more flavoring then it called for. I add about 2 1/2 tsp. to give it more flavor. Will definetely make them more. Be sure and grease the pan lightly. They were alittle hard to get out but wonderful to eat.

Another Nebraska girl here. As good as if not better then Russel Stovers.  This is a real keeper.  My husband already snuck into the fridge to many times.  At this rate it will be long gone before Christmas!

These are very good.  They did turn out like fudge, which was fine with me.  They were so easy to make and they had just enough peppermint.  I'll definately make them again!

These mints are wonderful! They set up great left in the fridge overnight. I will definitely make these again. I cut the pieces smaller than 1/2", more like 1/4" and it made, probably 200 or so. YUM!

These were good but not something I would make again.  Mine turned out just like mint fudge and I just wasn't crazy about the taste.  Glad I gave it a try.

These turned out great!   I drizzled melted semi-sweet chocolate on half of the batch and dipped the tops of the other half batch in chocolate.   I can't decide which ones look better, but they sure do look professional.   And it's such an easy recipe!

Has anyone tried subbing semisweet chocolate chips instead of milk chocolate?  I'm curious if they will set up properly because semisweet chocolate contains less milk.

amazing recipe,only issue is that I didnt have a hand mixer for this after about 1 minnute of trying to mix, too thick, had to do it by hand, which was a bit of a pain, but well worth the effort.

Sets up very quickly and it ended up putting my 20-year-old hand mixer out of commission.  Despite the technical difficulties, the Bavarian Mints are tasty, with a very light mint flavor.  The chocolate is creamy.

Great mints, taste a lot like the russell stovers french mints. The consistency is a lot like fudge so i bought a few extra bags of milk choclate and layered the bottom of a cookie sheet with wax paper, then melted the milk choclate and covered the wax before putting in the recipe listed above it. Then i cute the peices and added mroe choaclte so tehy were coated. makes for a delicous treat for holidays!

Made these for some friends at a BBQ & everyone loved them & asked for the recipe! They're kind of like brownies, except totally fudge-y--so what's not to like?

Made these to go on my cookie platter to the neighbors.  YUMMY!!!  Easy to make and makes alot if cut into small size pieces.  Just the right amount of mint flavor too!  Will be using this recipe for years to come.  Made recipe as written.  I didn't dip in chocolate either.

This was really good!  A little lighter than regular fudge but just the right amount of mint.  Made a nice addition to my holiday gift plates.  And was easy too!

I didn't really like this, but i'm not into mint fudge and that is what it was.  I love mint stuff but this just isn't for me.
