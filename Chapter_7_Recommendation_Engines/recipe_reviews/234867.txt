I love this recipe. My aunt Syble has made 7up cake for the past 50 years or so. It has become a holiday favorite in our family.

  It is worth noting that this is essentially a pound cake. That means that, by design, the texture is denser and heavier than a layer cake. That means that, generally speaking, smaller servings are in order.

  The recipe here is basically the same as my aunt's, except that instead of using 1-1/2 cups of butter, 1 cup of butter and 1/2-cup of all-vegetable shortening are used in the cake. The shortening changes the texture slightly, giving the cake a smoother texture. 

  Another difference is in the glaze. Instead of using milk, melted butter is used; and 1-2 Tbsp. of lemon juice is used instead of vanilla extract. If the glaze is too thick, either additional butter or lemon juice can be added. The lemon juice flavor in the glaze complements the flavor of the cake.

  I prefer 7up, but my mother sometimes uses Mountain Dew instead of 7up, which yields a slightly different flavor; but delicious, nonetheless.

Pretty good.  I made this for a coworker's birthday and it stayed in the freezer at work until we were ready to sing to him.  I didn't get a chance to eat it right away but I tried it later that day and it was pretty good.  It's a little heavy, similar to a pound cake, and nice and lemony.  It didn't go all that quickly, though, so it wasn't as much of a hit as some of the cakes I've brought to work.  Thanks for the recipe!

I received this recipie, a Bundt cake pan and a bottle of lemon extract as a gift at my wedding shower 28 years ago and it is a favorite at our house. I do add freshly grated lemon peel, and don't use the glaze, just a bit of powdered sugar oner the top.  Always super moist and a lemony treat!

This cake was lots better with oil instead of butter. I cooked it on 325 for 70 minutes and also added a teaspoon of baking powder. It was so crispy and crunchy, best  pound cake ive ever made! I also tried the butter and will never make it again with butter, only with oil!

While I loved the texture of the cake I was disappointed in the huge amount of lemon extract it called for... 2 TBL is way too much...I read it several times and then followed it against my better judgement.  The taste is just ok...but has a definite medicine taste..and I did use high quality extract.  I will make this again but use vanilla and perhaps almond...or a squeeze of real lemon.  Other than that it's a keeper.

Thank you for posting this recipe. I tried another recipe before but it didn't turn out well. The only thing different I did was use ginger ale instead of 7up since that was all I had on hand. Yes it's a dense cake but as long as you make sure you blend the sugar and butter completely and don't over beat once you add the flour, this cake will melt in your mouth. The crust on the outside is the absolute truth. I get several requests to make this cake!!

Great tasting, but the cake sticks to my pan. I have greased it real good and then second time I even floured it and it still stuck.

First time making wasn't too pretty. The glaze wasn't too good but the cake had a nice lemony flavor. Be sure too grease pan very genourosly or it sticks. Followed recipe to the letter. Yummy!

It was good but outside was tough and it stuck. I used a lot of PAM spray for non stick. Later read that you shouldn't use non stick spray. I knocked off a star because I wish the recipe stated what to grease with. Experts say butter or crisco and a dusting of flour. (Cover it but dusted. No flour chunks). This was my hubby's birthday cake and I was embarrassed it broke but maybe this will save someone else from a sticking nightmare. Recipe other was was very good. The amount of lemon extract was a lot. I'd probably cut in half next time and use the juice from a couple of lemons and some zest.

I'm a new baker..so I used this recipe as a starting point and tweaked along the way. I added grated  lemon zest and a tsp or so of vanilla along with the lemon extract. The zest really brings out the flavor. Also..I think it should be said that the instructions are off a little IMO. I alternate the flour and 7up..ending with the flour. I found that my cake didnt come out as nice when you are just adding the 7up at the end.

My son requested a 7 Up Cake for Thanksgiving.  It had been years since I made a 7 Up Cake and had no idea if I still had the recipe.  Thankfully I was able to find it on allrecipes.  I chose this recipe for its simplicity. The cake is so flavorful and moist - just how i remembered it. One of the best pound cakes around!

Thanks for this recipe...I added my own twist at the end, with the purple icing and powdered sugar...and it's not overly sweet.

The cake was very good but it took over 90 minutes to bake and have that nice hard crust that I remember. I think using a thick fancy bundt pan was the culprit. By the time it cooked long enough it came out a little dry. Next time I will use a regular cake pan!

I wonder how true these reviews are? This recipe did not work for me and the cake did not turn out well.  1 cup of 7 up is way too much and 2 tablespoons of lemon extract is way too much.  Every other recipe i read calls for 1/2 cup of 7up and 2 teaspoons of lemon extract. The cake overflowed the pan and sunk in the middle.

This is the very first ever pound cake I ever made, I made it for my husband for New Year's since this is his favorite treat. The cake itself was so lemony good and the right amount of sweet, I was told it was much better than store-bought 7UP pound cake! However, the cake stuck to the pan after generously greasing it twice so I recommend looking up how to not get the cake to stick to the pan. Also, I felt like the glaze on top made the cake a little too sweet, I think just a sprinkle of powdered sugar on top would be good or none at all! Overall, this was the best pound cake I've ever had. :)

Excellent go-to lemon bundt.  For a change,  sometimes I add a little rose water to the icing for a perfect springy taste.   Great Easter dessert too! Thanks for sharing

Delicious! Only complaint about this recipe is to make sure you grease AND flour your bunt pan. My cake broke in half when I tried to get it out of the pan. But the cake was perfect otherwise. Great flavor and texture. Best cake I've ever made. I just had trouble getting it out of the pan.

I baked the cake according to the recipe.  I did not make the glaze.  The cake turned out nicely, but a little too sweet for my taste.   All in all, it was good.   Maybe next time I will use a little less sugar.  Thanks.

I tried this recipe and the flavor was good but the texture came out really dense. Very heavy. It was just ok for me. Follow the recipe to the letter.

Despite greasing the pan, the cake stuck to it. So I served it right side up instead of inverting it. I substituted lemon abstract for vanilla in the glaze.  It was really tasty!

This has become my family's favorite.  I followed the recipe and it turned out GREAT.  Be sure to generously grease your cake pan...it will slip right out

I made the recipe but I changed the recipe just a bit after reading the reviews... I used (1 cup of butter instead and a 1/2 cup of vegetable oil, 1 teaspoon of baking powder and 1 t-spoon of lemon extract) Let me tell you this taste exactly like my great grandmothers recipe! I used shortening to coat my pan so that the cake wouldn't stick. I was so proud of my accomplishment I almost cried at the finished result.

I gave this 2 stars  because no I wont make it again , too much work to have the finished product taste so dry and bland. The glaze was the only flavorful part. I think this recipe was put out by 7up to promote their product, but it needs improvement  for sure!

Its stuck inside the bundt pan but its a mile high thick.  I floured the pan too. I'm going to cool it off and then use a butterknife to release it. I'm dreading it.

I am about to make this the second time. This cake is Sooo delicious. The ones you can buy at the store cant even compare.  For an adult version, substitute your favorite rum for the liquid in the glaze ;)

Made it with just vanilla extract, did not have lemon.  It turned out GREAT. I was surprised by how moist it was. People really liked it. Only thing I would change is not to put so much sugar, people said it was fine but I think it was too sweet & I love sweetness. I recommend this recipe!

I remembered eating this as a kid and just started making it myself. Love it! I don't bother with the glaze I'm content to sprinkle the top with just a bit of powdered sugar. sometimes I don't even bother with that.

This is a childhood favorite of my significant other. It came out just the way his mom used to make it ;)

Cake recipe was perfect. Glaze was a little thinner than I like so if you want a thicker glaze add less milk and/or add milk slowly to taste.

Made this for the first time for Thanksgiving! It was so good! I followed the directions exactly as it said. Didn’t really care for the way the icing turned out, but I think it would have been fine without it. Not too lemony or sweet! Loved it!

I made this according to the recipe and found it bland but had good texture.  Hubby and kids loved it.  Next time I will add salt, lemon juice and citrus zest.

I really was excited for this cake, and I took heed of others warnings about it sticking, but even with plenty of greasing and flouring it stuck.   Half of it came out willingly but the other half came out in 3 different pieces.   I figured its not a huge deal as long as it tasted ok since I wasn't bringing it out of the house, but it is bland.   I followed the recipe exactly with the full amount of lemon and mostly it tasted like butter.   Not my favorite.    For the amount of butter and eggs I used in the recipe  I am disappointed.

This cake was tasty!  Mine stuck to the pan in one spot, but the cake was too yummy so we didn't care.  Was afraid I screwed it up because I did not have lemon extract.  Instead, I used fresh lemon juice (about a table spoon) and that was perfect.  It did not over power the cake and it was still moist and delicious.  I would probably double the glaze recipe next time because my kids enjoyed it a lot.  There didn't seem to be enough to really get all of the cake.  With that said, it was tasty as well.  Next go around, I will probably try a bit of almond extract in the batter and perhaps try a true butter cream recipe over the cake while it's warm and let it melt. The possibilities are endless!

This cake was very good.   I put half the glaze on it while it was hot and waited until it cooled for the rest. I used butter,  lemon extract, 7up and powdered sugar. I did the 20 minutes on the butter and sugar.

I will definitely make this again.  My husband had a taste for a 7-Up cake. We enjoyed making this together. My glaze seemed to be a bit too thin though. I followed the measurements, I may need to adjust a bit next time. Also, I saw a recipe that added lemon and lime zest; I am considering adding that next time I make this to help boost the lemon-lime flavor. Overall-THUMBS UP!

This recipe turned out extremely well. It had an old school  flavor that reminded of  my Grandmother's cakes. I do suggest that instead of spraying your bundt pan  with a cooking spray you should butter  and flour it. It makes a huge difference. I also suggest that you use 7Up for the glaze instead of milk. It's so flavorful plus it gives you another reason to use the 7Up soda. I will definitely make this again.

I have made this several times. I tend to add a little more lemon juice and for the drizzle I like it to be quite lemon tart so I add more there too. It is always a hit. And now I get requests for it. Yum

Tweaked this recipe a bit instead of 7up I tried it with Canada Dry, I substituted 4 tablespoons of the unsalted butter with margarine. 
And greased and floured my pan very well so It wouldnt stick! instead of lemon extract I chose lemon juice! And I also added lemon juice in the frosting! For baking a cake on a Monday nite at 9pm it turned out excellent!

I followed the directions exactly as stated. The only exception was that I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract as stated in a couple of the reviews. My cake took a lot longer than 1:15 to cook. Maybe due to my oven. I didn't put any glaze on top b/c in my opinion the cake doesn't need it. Shared with my family and they loved it. Moist and lemon flavored. Just what I was looking for.

Delicious! I have been making this cake for more years then I care to admit. It is a family (and friends) favorite. I use a bundt pan and HEAVILY grease and flour the pan. I keep one of these in the freezer for when I need a last minute dessert.

I have always enjoyed the women in my family preparing large meals around this time through the beginning of the New Year and one of my favorite dessert 's has always been the 7UP cake.  It is a delight to pass the cake on.

This is the best cake I've ever made. My husband and kids loves it.  The only thing I do different is instead of using milk for my glaze , I use a little bit of 7 up.

I made this for the first time, incorporating some of the other reviewers' suggestions : I used 1 cup butter and 1/2 cup vegetable shortening in the cake and substituted 7 up and a little lemon juice for the milk in  the glaze.

Just like the 7Up cake I grew up eating.  We use this recipe for holidays and it always comes out perfectly.  Melts in your mouth and it's simple to make.
