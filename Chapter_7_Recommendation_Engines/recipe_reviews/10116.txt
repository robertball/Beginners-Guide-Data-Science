These are simple to make but instead of all the mess of the butter, glass and sugar, I just put the sugar in a small saucer, flattened the cookie on it and turned it sugar size up onto the cookie pan.  Much easier.  And they are very DELICIOUS!  Thank you, L.A. Stevens, this recipe is a keeper.

L.A., thank you for saving my day. I had a little group of five year olds to babysit one day. I had already decided I wanted to corral them in the kitchen where I have easy clean-up vinyl.(Oy! I'm too old for this!) Anyway, I put out the bowls as you suggested along with little bowls of M&Ms, raisins, and dried fruit pieces. They all had a great time pressing their goodies into these cookies and comparing notes. Thank you for not only a tasty recipe, but for a great idea to keep children entertained on a rainy Seattle day.

Nice and easy, tasty too. I did not use the full amount of sugar and I used whole wheat flour. An easy way to make cookies a touch healthy :)

Bwah hah hah! These were awesome! I needed to keep my 3½-year old out of the way so we could get a new furnace in the house, and this was great! Instead of butter, we used half margarine and half apple sauce. She was hesitant to smoosh the ingredients with her fingers (she's used to me using beaters), so I helped her do it. After flattening the cookies to about ½", we decorated the tops with Craisins and Smarties (Canadian M&Ms, only better!). They only took maybe 8 minutes to cook. Since we didn't flatten them much, they ended up being thicker, softer cookies, although the one-third size batch (2 cups of oats) only made 3 dozen cookies. Very tasty. Thanks for sharing, L.A. This was fun. :)

My 2 1/2-year-old and I just made these cookies and they were great! Easy and quick, they taste like the ones my grandmother kept in her cookie jar. Tip-for thicker, chewier cookies, don't flatten(but don't make em bigger than suggested). (update: made this again with 1 cup old fashioned oats and 1 cup quick oats = perfect texture!!! try it!)

It was great for the kids to make easy ingredients and really wasn't that messy. I read the other reviews for great tips to make it even more fun for kids and yummy. My  youngerkids didn't love it as much as my older ones but by "tweaking" recipe with other goodies it worked out great!

This simple oatmeal cookie recipe resulted in some great tasting cookies. I didn’t add any nuts or dried fruits to the recipe and I didn’t even top the cookies with any sugar and, to me, the cookies turned out great. I think this recipe is a great “foundation” recipe for making a variety of different types of oatmeal cookies. I love how easy it is to make these cookies. I even liked mashing the ingredients together. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I thought these were a great cookie.  Especially for kids to help bake.  I made these with my 3 year old and we had a great time!  I made them just as stated but I cut the recipe in half.  I shouldn't have because my husband took them to work and everyone raved.  I will have to make them again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this exact recipe 3 days ago. It was like the potato chip commercial..."bet ya can't eat just one". I sized up the recipe by an additional 50% to get rid of an excess of butter on hand.  Big mistake! lol I thought I would NEVER get done pressing these out! lol I put the oatmeal in last so I could feel the ingredients fully mix and there were no granuals of brown sugar slipping between my fingers. I found the best texture was to bake for 10 minutes and catch it exactly before the cookie starts to burn at the edges to get a crisp cookie without a burned bitter taste but still nice and light and buttery at the same time. Consistency in size is key. I packed them in between paper towels to get rid of the excess butter so they did not have a greasy feel. My guests couldn't keep their hands off of these! I believe getting the bake time tuned just right can kick up these tasty morsels an extra notch. They were even better the second day!

I wanted to make these because of the simplicity of the recipe, but these turned out awful - too hard and way too buttery/sugary.  I followed one of the reviewers suggestions and patted the mix into a pan to make bars since the cookies turned out so disastrously.  That worked a little better, but now instead of being hard, they just crumble when you pick them up.  And they still taste like a mouthful of brown sugar and butter.

This is the exact recipe that my Grannie made.  It has long been a family favorite.  She also made a date spread that she would sandwich between two cookies.

I cut this recipe down to make only 15 because I could not imagine them turning into much of anything considering the limited ingredients and flavors...I am so glad I did not make the whole batch.

These cookies were good and very easy to make.  I added some cinammon,nutmeg and a touch of vanilla.  The only problem was if you made them to big they feel apart.

I had alot of trouble with these cookies crumbling when I tried moving them to the cooling racks.  Even letting them sit on the pan didn't help.  However, once moved, they firmed up nicely, and were delicious!!!!    I think next time I'll try leaving them as balls and see if that helps.

This recipe didn't have enough butter so I had to add an extra 7 tbs of butter. Even then there wasn't quite enough sticckyness. Other wise they turned out fabulos. They do not have to cook 12 minuets I only needed to cook them for 7 minuets

These were super easy, super yummy.  I took the recipe down to 15 servings (1 cup oats, 1/2 cup everything else.) and added a splash of vanilla. At first, I had the kids mix them in a ziploc baggie--but I ended up having to put the stuff in a bowl to get it really mixed well. Can't believe how simple and good they were. Like lace cookies.

Excellent cookie. I only modified the recipe by adding walnuts and fresh, diced nectarine. Also, a little cinnamon. Can't wait to try this one out on MJ when he gets home from work. I love days off and baking on them - and we are in desperate need of groceries and this cookie recipe fit the bill perfectly. I had everything, and some random extras to create a hearty cookie. 5 MMMMMs up.

I scaled the recipe down to only make 12 and I also made some changes based on other reviews. I added some cinnamon because oats and cinnamon just makes sense to me. I also added vanilla and a pinch of salt to bring out the flavors. I also substituted the butter for butter-flavored Crisco because that's how my mother makes her cookies and it's got less saturated fat in it than butter. The end result was good but I think that without the changes it wouldn't have been as flavorful as I usually like it.

very messy and crumbly. Would prefer a dough that can be dropped by the spoonful. Not bad tasting though.

I have been using this site for a couple of years now found many recipes that were great... this is the first one I am reviewing though ... I kept my 7 yar old daughter home from school today due to extreme windchill factors and was looking for cookies to make that didn't take eggs since we were out... her and her 4 year old brother just finished making these.... they are awesome... easy.. fun .. delicious... thank you so much!!!!!

These are really good! I like to use whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose. I also add chopped walnuts and chocolate chips. This recipe makes a bunch, to compensate I make GIANT cookies :)

YUM!

I have made this twice, once with quick oats and once with old fashioned oats. Different outcomes but both great! With the quick oats it reminds me of Hobnobs. Your choice of oat type and cooking time allows you to vary the denseness of the cookie. My cookies have not been crumbly at all. Would be easy to reduce the sugar content if they are too sweet for personal taste. The old fashioned oats also seem to lessen the sweetness a little.

Like other reviewers have said, I did not bother with the sugar and glass etc. Just pick up a little ball and squash it down :-) Simple!

A fun recipe for my toddler.  Chewy and good tasting.  I'm not fond of plain oatmeal cookies but I like these.

Love crispy cookies and these were perfect in that respect!  Also, my son has egg allergy, so these worked for him as well and he loved helping make them!

My client wanted oatmeal cookies that would help her eat more of the oatmeal she gets from the food bank.  These were GREAT, she loved them and they were easy enough for ME to make - a cook I am NOT!  Thanks to WHOEVER invented this - and because its easy to break down, I can make a 1/3 recipe that's more than enough for her!

Husband said these were the best oatmeal cookies he has EVER had. And I agree with him. I cooked them for 12-13 min and they were thin (almost lacy in places) and crispy and delicious. 
We will be keeping this recipe and making them over and over! Thank you!

My husband and I love plain, simple oatmeal cookies and these are perfect.  So easy, just a few simple ingredients (though I did add vanilla and salt to mine). They are not too sweet and came out soft and chewy.   My hubby is already asking me to make them again.  Awesome.

This is a cookie from my childhood that I made with my mom!  She recently passed away so I would have lost the recipe but for allrecipe.com!  My mom melted the butter and mixed it in and it gave a crispiness that I love better than using softened butter.

Great recipe! My kids had so much fun making these. Really easy for the kids. I let them each make a bowl (2 kids) and it was a good amount. The cookies tasted fine, but the big attraction for me here is an easy and fun way to spend the afternoon with my kids! I'm keeping this recipe!

This recipe will become cookies you find in my jar often!  I followed the recipe exactly, using the tip to add chopped nuts and fruit bits.  I used chopped walnuts and four flavors of Craisins (original, blueberry, cherry and pomegranate).  I really mashed them down on the cookie sheet using coarse sugar before baking because I wanted a thin crisp cookie to go with coffee.  They turned out perfect!!  The only bad thing is that they are very addictive (like potato chips, you can't eat just one)!  Thanks so much for this recipe.

We grew up making these cookies and I love them as much today as then.  You can shorten the cooking time and leave them thicker for a soft cookie, or flatten them and overcook (though be careful not to burn) for a crispy cookie!  Over the years we've added assorted spices to alter the taste; try a bit of cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice,  ginger, or maple flavoring.

WOW! To those who had the misfortune of these not turning out, I am sorry. I can't believe how good these are and how simple they are to make with kids. For our oven, 8 mins. on the button was it. Yum! I think I am going to use this for the crust of a cheese cake later-maybe a butter pecan version. Thanks for sharing. Oh, I added 1/2 t. salt and, for me, it was just the salty sweet we like.

These were just overly buttery and too crumbly.  On a dark pan they burned; on a light pan they cooked fine.  There are much better oatmeal recipes on this site.

These were fun to make but they crumbled when you touched them and ended up all over the floor. I agree with the other reviewer who stated they tasted like butter and sugar. I had to throw these out and I have never had to that with anything I have made from this site before.

Recipe was simple to make and my 5 year daughter enjoyed making them and a mess. The best part with this recipe is it does not require milk or eggs to make as my daughter is allergic to both, but still trying to find a way to spoil her to a sweet tooth. Cookies came out tasting good, with the simple ingredients that went in to them. THANKS- Got to go get the kids more cookies as we speak- so they must rat e them high as well!

This cookie works amazingly well with lots of small children! I have 5 kids aged 8, 7, 5, 4 and 3, and I was concerned about the younger two, but these cookies can't be spoiled! You can throw in any additives you want and they still come out good. We made 6 batches and each kid picked a different thing to put in theirs. We had chocolate chips for one, toffee walnut for another, peanut butter for another, coconut chocolate chip and butterscotch chip. They were all awesome! We also did one batch of choclate caramel chip, not so good, the caramel and oatmeal don't go well together. Also, unless you REALLY like sugar, don't do the coating. We did one batch and realized how sweet they were and made the rest without dipping them into the sugar, much better. Thanks for the recipe!

I did not(and neither did my four children and their two friends) like these they are terribly sweet and taste like nothing but butter and brown sugar. I'm giving 2 stars because despite the fact that I think they are disgusting, I would let my children make them again because it was a fun way to spend time indoors on a rainy day.

this is a wonderful cookie. I added some cocoa powder and extra sugar to make a chocolate version of this cookie. The results were divine. Different texture because there is no egg, but still just as good.

This recipe reminds me of what my mom used to call "Lace" cookies. It was very easy, but very messy. I'm going to try it in my bread mixer next time. We took the advice of early reviews and added vanilla, coconut and pressed it on a plate of sugar. We plan on making these cookies again and again.

I've made these since I was a kid. Never get around to cooking them though... They only ever get eaten raw. As there are no raw eggs, they are good for that purpose.  Since I don't bake them, I just omit the baking soda.

These are great when you don't have a lot in the house and with choc. chips, even better!  I would recommend not flattening them, though. I baked them in ball form and they flattened out on their own just enough to cook through and still be a substantial cookie.  I will make again!

This recipe was great. I'm a college student so I don't have a lot of ingredients just laying around. I substituted apple sauce for half of the margarine to make it healthier and the consistency less "crumbly". I only cooked half of the dough and then froze the rest for another day. My friends loved it.

I love the taste but find the dough hard to work with.  I melted the butter instead and mixed it all together (I don't like getting oatmeal under my fingernails.)  Then I spread it in a cookie sheet and baked.  Oatmeal Squares!  (I halfed the recipe for one full sheet of squares)

We LOVE these!  They are basic, but very good.  I watch other kids often and this is a recipe they can all enjoy.  No fighting over who does what when they all get their own bowl to work with and get to choose their own add-ins.  Mashing the ingredients is a little tough for my younger guys, so I have softened it considerably (and on occasion melted it) to make it more workable.  Fabulous results.  I turn to this recipe frequently on a chilly evening or drizzly day.  THANK YOU!!

Been making these since I was a little kid. Got the recipe from a kids in the kitchen cookbook. Nice to find the recipe on here again! But I think it makes better eating dough than cookies.

Great recipe! Good cookies! Easy for kids who want to Help! Let the kids make cookies while you do something else and wha-la dessert! My boys loved it! We had plenty with just two kid batches! And you do not have to worry if they eat the dough, NO eggs!  Thanks. A keeper!!

Great recipe. My kids loved helping and eating!  I did find it was best to let the cookies cool for a minute on the cookie sheet before moving them to a cooling rack. If moved to soon they had a tendency to fall apart. We will definitely be making these again.

This was a fun cookie recipe. I was sceptical based on the ingredients, I thought it had way too much butter and suger, but it was not bad! Will definatly make again.

My favorite oatmeal cookie... a little messy when mixing with your hands, but a great tension release - and a cookie I (not normally a cookie person) could live on.  Many thanks!

This cokkie is great! For extra I added a little vanilla. As well, each small bowl can be given a treat to add to the cookie such as: M&Ms, Craisins, Raisins, and other treats. My Husband loves them!

Super sweet and buttery and delicous.  I was too imaptient to flatten them out so I melted half the butter and just dropped them on the cookie sheet, no sugar topping or anything.  I just made the small version in step one that says to put in each kids bowl, and I have to confess that I couldn't stop myself from adding 1/2 tsp cinnamon, turned out great, I will likely add 1 tsp cinnamom next time.

I have been making these cookies for years.  I got the original recipe  from my Peg Braken cook book. Just made some with my granddaughter.   Thank you for breaking the recipe down into a kid sized batch.  I am bringing a few batches to a cookie swap .

These had to be the easiest and most delicious cookies I've made.  I don't understand the problems the others  were having,  but they are slightly crunchy and chewy all in the same bite.  I will be making these again.  On another note,  I used old fashioned oats.

I needed a basic oatmeal cookie recipe without raisins or nuts to bring to a recent get together and decided to try your recipe. There are 3 reasons why:

1) My best friend and I don't like raisins because they look like bugs to us
2) I am ADAMANTLY AGAINST USING MARGARINE! Why? Because most of the ingredients in margarine are chemically altered to taste like butter. There's a test you can do to prove that it's not even food...Place some margarine on a plate then go outside and leave it on the ground overnight. When you check it the next day, you will see that it didn't attract even bugs because they don't sense that it's edible!
3) I LOVED THE NAME OF YOUR RECIPE!

Anyhow, I made these cookies and I'm now the official "Cookie Queen" in my group! Thank you!

Basic oatmeal cookies.  I don't have kids to make these with at the moment, so I just used my KA mixer, which worked perfectly fine as well.  I halved the recipe because I didn't want to overload the mixer, and added in some vanilla and dried cranberries just because I wanted a bit more than plain oatmeal cookies.  These turn out pretty well.  They spread a bit, but I was able to get 9 cookies per sheet.  I baked at 11 minutes and they were perfect.  Thanks for the recipe.

They were a hit and so easy to make!! We will be making them again, my 4 1/2 year old was helping make them and couldn't wait to try them. Although because I was leary on the no eggs I only made the amount listed as the per bowl/kid part to test them. So good! Highly recomed them!

Why would anyone need 15 dozen cookies, ridiculous, especially hard, crunchy ones!  I ended up adding eggs to batch 7.  I can't even give these to my neighbors they are so hard (even varying the amount of cooking time, trust me I had lots of opportunity to try to improve it.  15 dozen!
