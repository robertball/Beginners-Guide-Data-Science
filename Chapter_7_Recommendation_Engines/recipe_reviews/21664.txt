This recipe is wonderful! I also make this with small seashell pasta and small salad shrimp. I recommend substituting sour cream for the milk as well. Thanks for the great recipe!

I took this recipe, when we went camping
w/ friends and everyone loved it!!  I did
add a carrot (shredded) & 1 1/2 teaspoons of
Bayou Cajun Seafood seasoning!  I did take
the others advice and replaced the milk w/
sour cream.  Because I was taking this on a 
camping trip and did not want it to dry out,
I did put in 2 Tablespoons of milk! This was
very flavorfull!!  Oh, I did replace the 3
cups elbow macaroni with: 2 cups shell macaroni.

I made this dish for my coworkers and everyone raved over it.  I decreased the milk and added sour cream for a thicker dressing and increased the cocktail sauce to give it even more flavor and color.  It was a big hit!

At first when I tryed this recipe it was bland but of course I didn't let it marinate...so once it marinates its better but I swear the shrimp and crab meat needs to marinate alone with the seasonings then mix, before I try any recipe I read the reviews and I am only assuming the person with the lowest ratings should have let the seasoning all marinate together over night if the time allows.

I loved this recipe and made it for the first time for a group if friends.  I was worried that 6 servings would not be enough so I doubled it.  I had so much food I seriously thought about mixing it in the bathtub! The orginal recipe in my opinion will probably serve more like 10 or 12 people.  But it is delicious.

My family LOVED this recipe.  I took a suggestion from another review and used sour cream in place of the milk.  I used the sour cream and chives.  I also used extra cocktail sauce and Tabasco.  I used red onion.

I made this salad for a church potluck, and it was a hit!  It looked pretty and the flavor combinations were interesting.  I was even asked for the recipe. You know its good then.

I followed the recipe to a T but none of us enjoy the dish.  I should have done as another reviewer did, and used way less macaroni, and a much smaller pasta as another did.  However, I am reviewing the recipe as it is.   I won't be making this again.  The taste and texture of the seafood is swallowed up by the pasta and sauce.

yes I tried it this weekend and it was a hit. I didnt used the eggs because I was serving deviled eggs. i substituted the milk for heavy cream and I added olives. I believe the teaspoon of salt was too much so reduce it to 1/2 teaspoon. The trick is to make the dressing the night before (the mayo, heavy cream and seasonings) allow those to marinate. With the shrimp and crab, I even added lobster meat - marinate that with Old Bay Seasoning, Black Pepper, Dash of Red Crush Pepper, garlic and Cayenne - and let that overnight. The next day do you your Marconi, veggies - celery, onion, olives, green pepper and mix all together and allow it to sit for at least four to five hrs - turns out to be superb!!! I didnt mix all and sit overnight because I didnt want the macaroni to become mushy like

Wow, this not only looked pretty but tasted wonderful!  I did change it just slightly.  I changed the serving size to 4 rather than 6...there's just two of us.  I omitted the eggs and used a red onion.  I always buy celery with bright green tops as I use the celery leafs along with the diced celery.  I put in a small jar of pimentos (for color) and used fresh lump crab meat along with the shrimp.  For the dressing I omitted the milk and used sour cream instead.  I doubled the dill weed and used Sriracha hot chili sauce rather than hot pepper sauce.  The fresh mint from our garden was a nice touch also.  I let it blend in flavor for 5 hours and then plated it on a bed of fresh butter lettuce.   Not only did it look great, it tasted like a top quality crab and shrimp salad.  Thanks Fred.

This was good but I think next time I'll make sure that I drain the crab and shrimp on paper towels. I followed the advice from others to use sour cream and no milk. I used fresh dill along with the fresh mint. Also I used about a tablespoon of Old Bay Seasoning. Oh and I also chopped up some carrots.

Tasty Mac salad!!  I too use whole fat sour cream  and I always add a little extra cocktail sauce.  I've been serving it at my kids bday party for family and everyone loves it.  The seafood makes it hearty and a step above most macaroni salads.

Very good!  My family loved it!  Have lots of mint in my yard and was glad to have a recipe to use it in.  I did not add the milk (substituted with sour cream), like others suggested.  Didn't add the eggs, but put them on top, in case someone didn't want them.  I will definitely make this again; would be great for a luncheon.
