This was satisfactory for a week night meal, but nothing special and I won't try again. I added yellow pepper per the cooknik tips, but it needs something else, herbs?

very good. Everyone seemed to enjoy this meal. I thought it was a nice change from the usual pasta dinners.

Delicious comfort food! The peas add just the right amount of sweetness.

This was all right - nothing spectacular.Nice to try once but won't be going into our permanent rotation.
