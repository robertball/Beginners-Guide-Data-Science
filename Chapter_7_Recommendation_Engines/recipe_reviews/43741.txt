This is a GREAT recipe if you have school-age kids who love to help in the kitchen.  Set up an assembly line, and watch them go to it!  I have an 8 and a 10 year old who helped me make these for a dinner party.  People thought the appetizers looked unusual, but once tried, they LOVED the taste and the appetizers vanished.  This dish is also perfect in cases where you need something you can't keep hot, AND can't keep cold...they have a decent table life without having their temperature constantly maintained.

I tried this very unusual recipe and was PLEASANTLY surprised!  WOW, who would have thought those tastes together would make such a wonderful impact on our tastebuds!  I use Beef SMoked sausage since I cannot have pork.  This is a wonderful holiday recipe!!!

This is a very nice presented appetizer with a very neat surprise taste.  Once  you start eating you can't stop.  For Christmas, I will alternate green and red marichino cherries.

These were OUTSTANDING!  I have never tasted anything even close these.  Even if you don't like ONE of these ingredients, it isn't the same when you eat it all together.  (example: I hate green olives, but liked this recipe).  Try it, your mouth will thank you!

Who would have thought that these odd ingredients stacked together would taste so good. I'm going to make these for a Christmas get-together using both red and green maraschino cherries putting them first on the stack. I'm a little anxious to see how others react to this unusual mix.

Either you LOVE this or hate it, but I have to say that MOST people love it.  Although leary of trying it, once they did, all I heard was "WOW" and "EXCELLENT"! If you haven't tried it, then I definately recommend it!

Despite this odd grouping of food and my first instinct to run far, far away, I tried this recipe on my family before serving it for Christmas appetizers this year. Thank goodness I did, because these are absolutely awful. Not one of us even remotely liked this appetizer. Sometimes it's best to just go with your first instinct and SKIP this recipe.

This sounded so strange that I just HAD to try it.  It was actually quite a treat.  I made a few and had each of my kiddos try one.. altho I had to half the olive and cherry (none of them are big fans of these) they winced at first when putting everything in their mouths.. then said.. "it's really good".. lol  Maybe not for everyone.. but sometimes the "strange sounding" recipes are the best ones! :)

these definitely look a little strange, but are quite tasty!  i made them for thanksgiving and had to force them on the family, but once they tried them... they liked them!  i used lite kielbasa and light velveeta cheese and they tasted great.  next time i will make half without the maraschino cherry as half of the people took the cherry off, or ate it seperately.

My mom and I decided to make this for an early Thanksgiving get together. It was very good and there wasn't any more left. Thank you for this new "tradition" we will have in our house for the holidays.

I don't know why someone thought they were suppose to warm the meat. It is already cooked. It is a delicious appetizer for Thanksgiving and Christmas. The family loved it. Thank you for this unusual and fantastic recipe! I think we will keep it!

Great! Served this at a bonfire party tonight and everyone loved it! Doubled this recipe (one jar of cherries was enough) and nothing was left. Colorful and pretty, and delicious. Thanks!

I was curious about this dish, so I only made a few at first for a dinner party. IT WAS AN INSTANT HIT! In fact, my dinner guests helped me make more so we could continue to snack on them the rest of the evening. You will not be disapointed and I do like the idea of using both green and red cherries.

Awesome.  I saw these and couldn't wait until the holidays to make them.  Very good blend of flavors. Those who didn't like one certain thing or another, just took that item off the toothpick, but most were brave enough to try it all and actually couldn't stop eating them.  I made 30 of them and it was not enough. Next dinner party, I will make at least twice that.

This was very tasty. Great for potlucks or appetizer get togethers. You must eat them all together. I understand what the original poster meant.

I love them.  Everyone at our thanksgiving dinner ranted and raved. Only one person did not like him and it was a 5  yr old boy who doesn't like anything.  I WILL make them again for our Christmas Eve gathering.

I have to admit that it was the unusual combination of ingredients as well as the reviews that made me try this recipe. It was really funny- "Interesting" was the first descriptive word 90% of my guests said after partaking. I agree. The consensus was: it was neither loved nor hated. Just INTERESTING. Thanks for the recipe, but I won't be making it again.

I wasn't quite sure how these would come out, but I had to try something new and different.  My daughter and I assembled these and we had no idea what to expect. When we finished the tray, they looked really nice.  We each tried one and watched eachother's face.  They were good!!  All the different flavors compliment eachother nicely.  Some of my Thanksgiving guests refused to try one, but the ones that did really liked these.  I recommend everyone give this a try.

I made these last Thanksgiving, they were not such a big hit. I think this is either something you will like a lot or not at all. My suggestion is to try them first before you serve them at a holiday dinner, that way you wont waste your cooking time or extra expense if you don't like them.

Absolutely fantastic! So different. What a great combination of flavors.  I like using the "sword" toothpicks like in the main picture. I made it for our family fall get together and it was a huge hit with adults and kids alike!!

Gave this a two because of the novelty.  This was okay, not bad.  Just different. No one raved over it.  Won't make again.

If one doesn't care for this flavor profile, mix it up!  Try different meats, ham, turkey, beef, pepperoni, and different cheeses.  I also use marinated mushrooms, artichoke hearts, pickles, pepperoncini peppers, etc.  Have been making variations on this theme since the 60's and always well received.
