Fast and Easy way to make Salmon. Cooking for (2). Toasted Walnut pieces in Skillet.  Used only about 3Tbs butter, equal parts Honey  Syrup (about 2-3Tbs ea), tsp of dried mustard and a capful of Vanilla. This gave the glaze a suble sweetbuttery flavor but NOT overpowering. Added the Walnuts and let it simmer while Salmon cooked.  Only used about 2Tbs of oil to coat bottom of pan... Salmon BROWNED nicely.  The glaze was the PERFECT compliment to the CRUSTY Salmon and the VERY soft Walnuts.

As with most recipes ... I am a TASTER ... I can always ADD but cannot remove an ingredient.  THANKS...

This wasn't bad but I think it needed a little
zing....maybe a little bit of spicy mustard stirred in. The sauce just seemed too sweet.

The sauce completely overpowers the fish.  If you like salmon, stick to a sauce that is more of a compliment.

My husband and I don't eat turkey so I brought this dish to my very southern in-laws for Thanksgiving, which they all scoffed at until they saw this delicious-looking fish. Well they all wanted to try some and we had no leftovers, and the next day, my husband's stepmother's eldery father showed up on my doorstep asking for the recipe. As a side note, I used brown sugar instead of honey with excellent results.

Easy to use fast recipe....I think a 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup of honey might be better....mine turned out a little too sweet.

We did not enjoy this at all.  We found that the glaze and the pecans were too overpowering for the salmon to the point you could not taste salmon at all. Sorry.

Very good. Not as sweet as I thought it would be after reading the other reviews, just sweet enough.
I made the recipe as written this time, but next time I think I will mke a few changes. I won't toast the pecans in the oven, I'll just lightly toast them in the heavy pan that I'll be cooking the sauce in. And I will use less butter and oil to cook the salmon.

This was excellent.  I strongly recommend using your best judgement on the amount of butter and honey.  I used 3 TB butter and a little over 1 TB honey and it was PLENTY!

This salmon was a nice switch from the usual savoury salmon we eat.  The recipe calls for 1.5 lbs of fish and we only had 1 lb of fresh Atlantic salmon, so I tried to modify the sauce ingredients to suit.  We baked the salmon instead of pan frying it (just seasoned with a little sea salt and pepper), and cut the sauce ingredients by 1/3.  Although the sauce was quite sweet, we liked it with the fish.  The only problem we had with it was that once the sauce cooled, it became very gummy and thick.  This *could* be attributed to not measuring the sauce ingredients properly though.  When making this again, I will make all of the sauce, but decrease the amount of pecans - we liked it on ice cream too!

A VERY good recipe.  I cut the butter in half to make it a little less greasy.  I also cut the amount of honey in half, doubled the pecans, and added about 1 tablespoon of Cajun mustard.  Excellent!

Very good. It was a little too sweet and syrupy, but I added some spicy mustard as others had suggested and that helped with the sweetness. We really loved it though and will definitely make again.

Even my kids liked this one.  Very easy and quick to prepare.  We live in Alaska and love to fish so there's always have lots of salmon in the freezer. It's nice to find good recipes for it so we don't get so tired of it.  Thanks!

This was so heavenly.  Everyone, even picky gramma, loved it to pieces!  I have to admit I even enjoyed it leftover, and believe it or not - cold!  It was great served with couscous.

Although my husband really liked this the amount of butter called for in this recipe is EXCESSIVE!!!  Using cooking spray and a little bit of butter OR oil would work much better.

This dish is unusually sweet but I like that it is a different to serve salmon. I didn't feel that it overpowered the fish at all - but I was conservative with the amount of glaze I put on each fillet. I also added a little maple syrup and vanilla to the glaze to complement the honey.

SO easy, SO delicious and SO fattening!!! We cut back a bit on the honey (only because we didn't have enough) as well as the butter and it was still pretty amazing. 
I served it atop a bed of arugula and couscous which blended perfectly with the sweetness of the glaze; the bitterness of the arugula balanced it. 
We enjoyed our fish with a nice pinot and impressed everyone at the table including ourselves.

OK, but not great. The Salmon turned out OK, but I felt that the glaze was just too overpowering.

This is delicious, however it's really really sweet.  I would cut back on the butter next time, as well as the quantity altogether.  Dividing it up amongst the suggested amount of salmon is still way too much glaze for each filet.

The glaze was great and I would definitely use it on something else.  I didn't think it fit with the salmon.  It was too overpoweringly sweet.

I was so looking forward to this dish, as I like fish and I am a big fan of anything sweet as well.  I was disappointed though, as the thick, sweet glaze did not go well together at all with the salmon.  I think the excess butter and oil that it was fried in didn't help the taste either.

My husband and I really enjoyed this tasty salmon recipe.  Next time though I will change the recipe a bit. To make it lower in fat, I will probably try to grill or bake the salmon.  If I cook the fish in the skillet as the recipe indicates, I will definitely use less butter and oil.

The pecan honey glaze is WAYYYYY too sweet and overpowering for the salmon.  The flavours do not go well together at all.  It tasted like I scooped out the filling of a pecan pie and dumped it on top of a perfectly good salmon entree.  We immediately scraped all of the glaze off of our salmon and ate it plain.

This is a *****FIVE STAR***** dish all the way!!  My husband & I absolutely loved it & will definitely cook it more often.  It's a great way to get that "twice-a-week" fish recommendation into your diet.  I followed the recipe as instructed, only cut it in half for 2 servings.  The honey glaze w/ the toasted pecans were just the right touch of sweetness with the fish.

Interesting recipe.  We love salmon.  Had to break down and actually use the oven on this one (not the grill) but it gives it a crunchier topping.

I will never make this recipe again. At first, all my husband and I could taste were the pecans, then the honey, then, if we were lucky, we could taste the salmon. The sauce definitely overpowers the taste of the fish.

I absolutely loved this dish, although next time I will only use half of the pecans, which I believe that the recipe calls for too much! I only used 12 oz of honey, and I poured the glaze onto each peice on its own plate just before serving. I saw in another person's review that they used the remaining glaze for ice cream, I'm so thinking of trying it. The glaze was just sweet enough, not too overpowering! I even had friends over that enjoyed it! I'm sure this recipe will be a family favorite! :)

Super easy, fast, frustration-free. Make sure to ask your fish butcher to remove the skin if you have picky eaters (my husband doesn't like to see the gray on the bottom of the filet).

Great for guests who enjoy fish; the sweetness of the sauce is always a pleasant surprise to newcomers! I serve with lightly blanched fresh green beans and plain sweet potatoes. I put butter & brown sugar on the side so everyone can add according to their tastes, since the main dish is so sweet already.

This was really easy to make.  The only thing I did different from the original recipes, I cut back on the amount of glaze to put over the salmon.  I moreless drizzled the glaze, so the flavors blended beautifully.

Mmm! I added Jack Daniels Spicy Mustard and some red pepper flakes to add some spice. I omitted the pecans for my portion (not a nut fan) and added them for my boyfriend. He enjoyed it and I loved it! I also baked it instead, as I was nervous about cooking it on the stove.

Eating for 1 is a challenge, some recipes just don't lend themselves to decreasing or even freezing.  I bought the most wonderful Salmon from Omaha Steaks and their steak seasoning that has citrus in it.  I used that instead of salt/pepper and I excluded the nuts (not a nut person).

This was wonderful and the first time I have had Salmon since I was tiny.  It was always too fishy or rich, this was a great sweet tooth satisfier!

Thanks to the recipe submitter, you made my night.  It is so much easier to eat healthy when you have this site as a resource - who knew fish could be fun?

Very good recipe!  I prepared this for my vegetarian family and they enjoyed it very much!  The glaze was a very tasty  but a little goes a long way - so you might want to cut the measurements in half (and you don't have to use all of that butter - cut that in half regardless to reduce the fat!!)...left over glaze is wonderful on top of vanilla ice cream for dessert!!

A wonderful combination of flavors however it overwhelmed the natural flavor of the salmon. I would suggest this recipe on pork tenderloin and it was be soooooo good. It was too much for a fish dish.

Did not like the extreme sweetness with the salmon.  I enjoy salmon and the flavor was lost to overwhelming taste of honey.  Will not make again.

We enjoyed this glaze with some of the suggestions of other reviewers.  I only used 1/2 cup honey and 1/2 cup of butter.  I did forget to add any oil, so the fish got a little burned.  As some others said, the salmon flavor was completely masked, even with the reduction of honey, so this recipe is probably not for salmon-lovers.  I may take the suggestion of one reviewer and try the glaze on pork chops.

I'm not a big fan of fish or honey, but my husband loves both, so I gave it a try.  Used part honey, part brown sugar, and a little less butter than called for, but it still turned out great! I was skeptical, but surprised - and my husband loved it! The pecans threw him off, but he was equally surprised at how well he liked them all together. Thanks!

It was a great change in how I normally cooked salmon.  Every step in the recipe went as planned but the final product didn't taste like I thought it would.  My wife doesn't like honey (but doesn't mind it when in recipes) but this recipe tasted too much like honey for her.  I liked it and I liked how easy it was to fix.

Our family did not care for this dish. The sauce was too sweet and frying the salmon like this caused it to be too fishy tasting. We usually bake our salmon and it doesn't have the fishy taste. It tasted like you were eating too strongly flavored fish with sugar on top to try to cover the taste, which it didn't. There was no blending of flavors.

Not too bad... I would use half of the honey next time because it is a little too sweet for me. Someone else suggested adding dry mustard to the sauce.... that may be just what it needs.

This dish is awesome!  I have fixed it for a crowd and just for my husband.  The recipe can be sucessfully cut in half or doubled.  I have substituted sliced almonds for the pecans on several occassions.  My guests always ask for the recipe and rave about how wonderful it compliments the Salmon.  Last night I used  Buckwheat honey - it added a molasses type flavor to the sauce.  It was yummy! 
Note:  Be careful not to cook the sauce more than 10 - 12 minutes on medium heat.  It can turn to candy as it cools. 
Thanks Kimber for submitting the recipe!

Although this was a REALLY easy recipe, I thought it was a little disjointed. The flavor of the salmon got completely lost in the heavy-sweet pecan honey glaze. I would suggest trying this recipe with pork chops rather than salmon. Save the salmon for a lighter sauce.

I used 1/2 cup honey and 1/2 cup of Log Cabin syrup. I toasted the pecans in a frying pan that I cooked the fish in. If you like honey then I would do all honey.

I think something is wrong with the quantity of glaze. That is an incredible amount of honey and butter for 4 - 4oz filets! One and one-half sticks of butter and 3/4 cup of honey are almost equal to the mass of the fish. In the photo, there is barely any glaze on the fish. There must have been a lot of leftover glaze. 
We had 2 lbs. of salmon so we doubled the glaze recipe. I felt like something was amiss when I melted three sticks of butter and a whole bottle of honey into the saucepan, but I dutifully followed the recipe. We had more than half the glaze left over. It is a nice tasting glaze. I'm going to try the leftovers on ice cream.
Our impression was that it was not neccesary to flavor the salmon like this. It masks the flavor of the fish.

I think I'd prefer the salmon baked, which is quick to do.  The toasted pecan glaze is wonderful, but half of it would be sufficient with the salmon.  It would probably be nice with a dash of cayenne in the glaze to add a little spice.

This was excellent!  Only used 3/4 cup honey and 1/2 cup butter. Skipped the oil altogether. Cooked the salmon until it was nice and crispy on the outside. Everyone loved it - thank you for sharing!

My mom and I loved this...my husband thought it was OK, I don't think he liked the sweetness.  I made a few changes based on what I had available...I used wahoo instead of salmon, walnuts intead of pecans and I'm sure I used less honey but it's hard to measure that. And I added a small amout of red pepper flakes to make it spicy and sprinkled a tiny bit of cajun seasoning on the fish while it was cooking.  It was sweet and spicy...and it was super easy with ingredients most people probably have handy.

I HATE fish but know I need to eat it and want to set a good example for my kids. This is a great recipe for people in the same boat. The honey really takes the fish taste out of it. I actually finished my ENTIRE piece before my fish loving husband!

This was fantastic! I cooked the pecans in the oven as directed, and then added about 1/2 the honey & pecan mix to the salmon as I cooked it. It turned out wonderful!  Although I burned the pecans that were in the skillet with the salmon, they still had wonderful flavor too! Will def make this again!!  Thanks!!

I made this recipe adding Dijon mustard.  I didn't have spicy mustard as suggested by one other member.  I made this for my parents and they loved it!  Salmon was strong but the glaze cut that and the mustard cut the sweetness of the glaze.  I served with a spring salad which was perfect.

I don't know what the other users are rating this three stars for. My husband and I loved this recipe and I don't think I would change anything except maybe next time I will try to put something in to make the glaze less sweet.

This was good but something about salmon tasting sweet just isn't right.  I loved the nuts-n-honey but I think salmon should just stick to tasting like garlic & lemon. The nuts would be good sprinkled with white sugar as a Christmas thing. Thanks.

Wonderful!...I wanted to dress up salmon and this was perfect.  I am a very picky eater and I ate it up!  My husband thought it was very tasty too.  Went great with white cheddar pasta and green beans. It was medium easy to make. I was very impressed...it makes a fancy dinner!  Thanks!

Pretty good.  I found this to be a little too sweet and oily for my liking tho'.  I'll definitely make this again, but reduce the amount of honey and butter/oil.  That shld make it lighter.  All around, a good, quick, weekday dish!

This was super easy! My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe, but although we have no complaints, I can understand how some people may find it too sweet. For those people I would sugeest adding some dried mustard to the honey pecan glaze. I also perfer poaching my salmon, as it perserves the true flavor of the fish. Enjoy!

Absolutely incredible, and I hate fish. My husband says we have to put this on our menu when we open a restaurant. Not really in the plans but we always look for recipes just in case. Did cut the butter and used olive oil instead.

This was a lot of sauce! We grilled 1.5 lb of salmon and there was lots of sauce left over.

Next time I plan to reduce how much butter and honey, plus throw in a good tablespoon of brown mustard.

Had to cut the fish into smaller pieces for it to cook more evenly, but it worked out pretty well. The caramelized nuts were a good topping!

Absolutely delicious! I made this for my husband's welcome home supper when he came back from military training and it's the only salmon recipe I've made since! The only changes I made were using oil instead of butter and switching the pecans for Sliced almonds (we like almonds better). Excellent recipe!

Quite good; I used a half cup of butter and honey. It ended up quite think, so we just spooned it over the salmon, which I cooked in tinfoil with lemon and butter. Added spicy mustard, lemon pepper and some paprika, and the end result was not overpoweringly sweet with a bit of a tang.

Knocked a star off this review since the sauce amounts are just way out of proportion to the salmon called for.  We used 2T each butter and olive oil for frying the fish (and even this was a generous amount of fat for the fish).  Then moved the fish to a warm oven and added about a 1/4C pecans to the same pan and toasted for around 4 minutes over low heat, then added roughly 1/4C honey and 1T butter and cooked a few minutes more before pouring over the fish.  Thumbs up!

I was surprised when I went to make this last Friday and it wasn't in my all recipes box.  We have made this several times and will continue to make.

The pecans in this dish gave it alot of flavor and a great crunch! I didnt use the veg oil in the pan and used about half the amount of butter. I think it calls for way too much!!

Wow--this was delicious and easy to make to boot.  I did substitute olive oil and rubbed some fresh basil and garlic on the salmon before I cooked it. Will make this again!!

Excellent... the only change we made was to add a bit of spicy mustard (as suggested), it balanced the sweetness.

Served with steamed green beans and red skin potatoes (cubed, boiled, then finished with oil oil and italian seasoning)...

Wonderful meal.

I could see using this sauce with chicken as well.  

thanks!

This was not my favorite recipe for Salmon, but my husband and oldest son thought it was awesome! I felt the honey was too over-powering.

The pecans were over powering in the glaze, a disappointment after going to all the work of cracking them out of their shells.  I also added a little crushed red peppers for a little spice and some brown sugar to the glaze to make it more caramel like.

This is awesome. We will make this again. Half the sauce or use it as a desert topping would be great on ice cream.

Pretty good, my husband loved it. I thought the flavors did not meld together very well. (I also added whole grain mustard to the sauce.)

This recipe was delicious!  After cooking the sauce it helps to let it stand and cool for one minute to let the honey thicken before topping the salmon.  This is definitely a recipe that I will cook for company.

Soooooooooo good! My favorite Allrecipes recipe so far! I added about 50% more honey because I have a sweet tooth and thought the glaze was delicious without overpowering the flavor of the fish.

I am not a big fan of anything fish, but I went ahead and made this anyway.  WOW!  The fish texture was great and the glaze was an excellent compliment.  Will make again!

A great way to get kids to eat fish.
