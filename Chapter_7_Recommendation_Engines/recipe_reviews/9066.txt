I've made this several times and we all love it. I make a few changes though. Instead of 1 cup mayonnaise, I add 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream. I also bump up the cheese to 12 oz., instead of only 8 oz. I also add a butter cracker topping using crushed ritz or other butter crackers, about 20 of them, and 2 Tbsp of melted butter. We like a crunchy topping.

I have been making this same recipe for years but I add a small bag of Pepperidge Farm seasoned bread stuffing to the top of the casserole before baking. Delicious! I always get requests for this recipe.

This was good, but not spectacular enough for a perfect rating.  Good for a weekday side dish, but too bland to serve to company.  I made this twice, the first time to a T to see if it needed modifying, and it did.  Use just 1/2 the mayo and add 1/2 cup sour cream for more tang and the egg isn't necessary.  With the egg, it came out a little curdled after baking and not visually appealing once you scoop into it.  And needed a dash of salt and for more flavor.  I will make it again since it's easy and comforting on a cold day.

EXCELLENT! I really wanted to make this dish, however, I didn't have all of the correct ingredients in the house, so I improvised. I used a bag of mixed stir fry veggies, and parmesan cheese instead of the cheddar. For those reviewers who said this dish was bland, a little seasoning goes a long way. Black pepper, and garlic and onion powder add a nice flavor. I also cut back on the mayo and added a little squeeze of lemon juice. I topped the casserole with more parm and a bit of paprika. Thanks Stacy!

Tasted 5-star as written, but truly "awesome" the 2nd time with the following changes: Used 2 bunches fresh broccoli & 1 head fresh cauiflower, 1/2c. mayo & 1/2c. sour cream, sauteed the onion & 2 cloves minced garlic in 1 TBSP butter & used meduim cheddar (I liked the sharp cheddar but medium seemed to let the other flavors come through more) added no salt. I did add a few TBSP milk because I had more veggies. THEN the following morning I'd forgotten that I needed a dish for a breakfast potluck at work, so I made a mixture of 3/4c. biscuit mix, 1-1/2c. milk & 3 eggs, poured over the top of the leftover casserole & baked it 400 degrees for 35 minutes - rave reviews!!! So the recipe gets 5 stars for it's own goodness, taste & versatility!!!

I have made this recipe so many times but I add cooked chicken and make it a casserole.  Some people are intimidated by the mayo but you must include it!  This can also be frozen and heated in the oven in no time.  This is also great with extra cheese layered thru it.

There are several variations of this casserole, and they all really do go hand in hand.  I like mine either with cauliflower thrown in their or with rice.  Sharp cheddar really does come through in the casserole. We like to use cheese whiz in ours, but this is a nice change of pace too.  You would think this would be a kid friendly dish...you know the cheese and all, but sometimes I think my 4 year old was born without taste buds.  Oh well, gonna keep trying.  Thanks for submitting.

This recipe was a huge sucess at my family dinner. Everyone had seconds. Because of the miserable broccoli in my grocery store I did substitute mixed frozen veggies. (Broc. Cauli. and Carrots.) Also because of my mushroom phobia I also substituted with Cheddar cheese soup. What a great dish!

I always feel guilty rating recipes when I change them.  But I'm doing it anyway.  This was SO good.  Even better reheated in the microwave the next day.  Here are my changes:  instead of 1 cup of mayo, I used 1/2c each of mayo & sour cream.  I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen.  I steamed it in a pot with some fresh garlic.  I used cheddar &  monterey jack cheese.  I didn't measure the cheese, but I know I used way more than 8oz of cheese.  Maybe double that.  I also crushed about 20 ritz crackers on top before baking.  Very yummy.  I made this earlier in the day & just kept it covered in foil in the fridge until I was ready to pop it in the oven.

I suggest that you add a can of mushrooms also I do not believe that salt and pepper does this recipe justice add a litte more spice.  garlic salt, white pepper ect. Also i mixed up mild and sharp cheese for a little more flavor or just use med.  over all it is an excellent recipe because it is a recipe you can be creative with.

Whenever I need a new idea for something to cook or bake, I go to this site.  I wanted something different for our family potluck and came across this recipe.  After reading many of the reviews, I decided to (1) substitute the one cup mayo with 1/2 cup instead and add 1/2 cup of sour cream, (2) used 2-1/2 pounds of fresh broccoli (blanched), and (3) put crumbled Ritz crackers on the top and sprinkled it all with butter.  Not only did my family rave about it, but they came back for seconds and thirds!  (I had made a double batch.)  This truly is an awesome recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

We loved this!  Only change I made was to use 2 - 12 oz packages of broccoli.  Baked for exactly an hour.  I found that this also make a great baked potato topper as well.  Next time I may try putting some crushed ritz crackers on top for a little crunch.

This recipe was really good. I added some mushrooms and used more cheese since everyone in my house loves cheese. Then on top I put more cheese and added bread crumbs that I added salt, pepper, garlic powder and other spices to. All in all this is a great basic recipe that you can do a lot with. Thanks for putting it on!!

This tasted okay. The problem I have with this recipe is: I DON'T THINK THIS IS A SIDE DISH! I felt it was heavy enough to be the main dish. Had I eaten it on a day that was not a holiday, over some rice, it would have liked it much better. I made it up the night before so the broccoli defrosted some in the fridge, but still after 45 minutes the center seemed a little cold and some of the broccoli was still crunchy. So, I am not sure how long other people baked it for, especially from a frozen state? I thought the frozen broccoli made it a little watery to. If I made again, it definitely would not be on a holiday, and I would defrost the broccoli first to remove some of the water. It might work better then.

Wonderful!  Needed a last minute casserole for family gathering.  Everyone loved it.  Ingredients in recipe generally on-hand so just threw it together in no time.  The easiest thing is to just combine all ingredients in large bowl after mixing up the egg with soup & wet ingredients, then add the cheese, then broccoli. Mix well then turn mixture into prepared 9x13 baking pan. I used the 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream, as well as topped the last 20 minutes with the 20 crushed Ritz with 2 Tbsp butter (suggested by another reviewer). Will definitely make again for easy potluck meals or holiday gatherings.

Loved it! Reminds me of the southern potluck broccoli casserole I grew up appreciating as a child; the one I scoped out the buffet table for with eyes of a true culinary detective at all our family reunions. As a child, to me the day was worthwhile if this broccoli casserole showed up...if not, I reluctantly settled for the lesser version made with Velvetta (yuck!). I think I would have been happier to have this casserole than Christmas presents from Grandma! So glad I have this recipe of my own now to make whenever I want, no detective work required, and no Velvetta. Thanks, Stacy!

This was pretty good. The taste of the mayonnaise is a little overpowering, so next time I will use less, and add some garlic to it.

This has been an essential part of Thanksgiving dinner in my family for years, with one important addition.  Cube 4 or 5 slices of fresh bread without crust.  Put on top of casserole and drizzle with 2 T. butter prior to baking.  The brown toasty topping is perfect.  I make this the day before and cook half way without bread topping.  The day of, I just take it out of the fridge a little early to take the chill off then top with bread cubes and butter and  bake til bubbly and top is nicely browned.  I think making it day before makes it better. It's best to cook the brocolli a bit and drain very well, then I just mix all ingredients except bread cubes and pat into pan. I usually use a little smaller casserole because I like it deeper.  9x13 spreads it a little thin.

I did use an entire 12 ounce bag of cheese and crushed up 1/2 sleeve of ritz crackers on top.  But other than those minor changes I kept the recipe completely as is and I'm sure I would still give it 5 stars regardless we just like the extra cheese & cracker topping.  This is an absolute keeper- there was not one bite leftover- infact people were arguing over the last serving.  We will make this our "staple" broccoli & cheese casserole from now on and will make it again and again!  Thank you for such a great recipe!

This was not exactly what I expected, but was really good! I pictured a more super-creamy, super-soft broccoli type dish, but my broccoli stayed nicely crisp and fresh, but was completely surrounded by decadent creamy super-cheesy goodness. This and mashed potatoes were the only two requests my vegetarian kid made for Christmas dinner this year, and it was a hit. I was a little leery of the full cup of mayo (even reduced fat), so I substituted about 1/3 of that with Greek yogurt... and then added another two handfuls of cheese on top, lest it become TOO healthy. Next time, buttered bread crumb topping, too!

Very good, but I can't give this 5 stars because of the texture of the sauce when it's cooked. It's kind of curd-ly... we'd really prefer a nice smooth cheese sauce. Tastes good though!

Delicious. But next time I would do a little less mayonnaise (like maybe 3/4 cup instead of a full cup) Its a little greasy.

Just made this and it was fantastic!! I followed the common suggestion I kept reading by other reviewers to omit the egg and use 1/2 cup mayo with 1/2 sour cream. I used Amy's Organic semi-condensed cream of mushroom soup and mixed cheddar cheese with muenster and others I had on hand. I used frozen organic broccoli right from the bag and the end product was not remotely soggy or undercooked - the texture was perfect! I also cooked 3 skinless chicken breasts in chicken broth, cut them up and added to the mixture before pouring into the pan to make it a full meal. I didn't have Ritz crackers for a topping so I just sprinkled some Panko bread crumbs on top and baked it that way. I served it over some steamed brown rice and I was very happy at how delicious this came out! My husband hates broccoli but loved this. I will definitely be making this again!

I've made this twice now.  Once for Thanksgiving (it was the ONLY dish to be emptied) and once on a weekday night.  We all really love this recipe.  As others have mentioned, I changed the recipe only slightly by omitting the egg and using 1/2 cup mayo, 1/2 cup sour cream.  This will definitely become a staple side dish in our house!

Great recipe. Instead of 3 bags of broccoli I used 1 bag (1lb 12 oz bag). I cut the mayo in half and only used 1/2 cup. For extra flavor I added a 1 tsp of paprika.

Delicious!  People who don't eat brocolli will eat this.  I have added cooked cauliflower and mushrooms to the mix too (clearing out the fridge :-) and it's wonderful.

This was delicious!  The sharp cheddar was what really brought this dish together!  I used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream.  I would have liked a crunch, next time will add cracker topping as recommended.  Thanks for this new family favorite!

I have made this for Thanksgiving Dinner in the past and plan to make it again this year. It is a great alternative to Green Bean Casserole, which not everyone in my family likes. The flavor was wonderful. I do add extra seasoning for more flavor. I leave out the onions because my husband doesn't like anything with onions. I may add in green onions this year since my husband doesn't mind their flavor. Adding mushrooms sounds good, and maybe I'll try the mixed broccoli, cauliflower and carrots sometime. Thanks Stacy!

This was some yummy stuff!  I'm new at this whole cooking thing, and I was looking for a way to doctor up plain old frozen broccoli.  It was my first attempt at a casserole, but I had the ingredients on hand and said what the hay.  Glad I did!  I crumbled round butter crackers over the top as someone suggested, and it was sooooo tasty!

Delish! Used fresh broccoli. Didn't have cream of mushroom soup, used cream of broccoli soup and added some sliced fresh mushrooms. Used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream. Topped with Panko bread crumbs. Wonderful!

Just like my grandmother used to make. I'm not crazy about recipes made with "cream of..." soups, but that's the only way this recipe tastes right.  It's one to pass down the line. A great traditional holiday recipe.

Wonderful side dish, made it for Christmas dinner. I used two bags of frozen (steamer bags) of broccoli florets, 1/2 mayo and half sour cream. I also crushed entire sleeve of Ritz crackers on the top and added a few pats of butter. Everyone gobbled it up.

The casserole is "awesome"; delicious, cheesy and rich, almost a meal in itself. I made a few changes though thanks to some suggestions from the reviewers. Used a large can of the soup just because I had one on hand and fresh broccoli, about a lb and 1/2. Split the mayo with sour cream and used more of each. Used half an onion and almost 2 cups shredded cheese, lots more paprika and several drops of hot sauce. Mixed it all together with the egg but it seemed a bit dry so I added about !/4 cup of fresh chicken broth I had just made. Lots of salt and pepper then topped with the crushed Ritz crackers with added paprika and sprayed with olive oil to help the browning. The broccoli was just right with just the right crispness.  Make this casserole; your guests will devour it.

Made as is except I used Cream of Onion soup instead of cream of mushroom.  Would be fine with either though.

I made this using fresh broccoli florets that I had left from a party.  I steamed the florets (about 4 cups worth) and substituted them for the frozen broccoli.  I added garlic powder, a dash of tabasco sauce in addition to generous amount of pepper and small amount of salt.  I also sprinkled some seasoned bread crumbs on top.  This didn't LOOK great, but the taste was wonderful.  Next time I'll use the frozen broccoli and add some sour cream  and see how that turns out---may also be nice to add some shredded carrots or pimentos for color.  Thanks!  Good recipe!

This was great!  I made it to take to my Aunt's for Thanksgiving dinner and received raves from all 4 Aunts and their families.  Will take this to Easter get together as well since I was "ordered" to bring this to every gathering!

Stacy, thank you so much for posting this recipe.  It REALLY is awesome.  I made a few changes.  Instead of 1 cup of mayo, I used a little over 1/2 cup of sour cream. I used fresh brocolli only because I happened to have it.  I'm sure it would be the same with the frozen.  I will use frozen next time.  I also used monterey jack cheese and crushed some low sodium ritz crackers for the top. I also sprayed butter flavored pam on top of the crumbs.  I want you to know that this is the best brocolli I have ever had.  Thanks again.

According to my husband, my aunt, and our friends, this was delicious and simple to make.  I like it because it's a very light dish, not too heavy on your stomach.

I have been looking for this recipe for a long time, I have been making it from memory for years, because I lost the written recipe...I load it up with eggs (2-3)  and lots of cheese, use fresh broccoli, chopped and make a topping out of cheeze nip cracker crumbs.  (Grinding the crackers in the food processor)  It is absolutely the best, and reheats in the microwave really well too.

I tried this and LOVE it.  The only change I made was to use the Durkee fried onions instead of finely chopped raw, and I used 1/2 cup instead of 1/4.  And I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen, which is not much of a change.  Thanks for sharing!  I love that it's mostly broccoli and without rice.

was perfect and delicious. I did sub 1/2 cup low fat sour cream, but I am sure that if I added more cheese and mayo it would have been even better!

do NOT use anything BUT real mayo for this recipe.  I used Kraft Miracle Whip and it turned out way too sweet... almost inedibly sweet.  I would also suggest using fresh brocoli instead of frozen - it just doesn't taste the same.

I used broccoli cheese soup instead of cream of mushroom. I also used more cheese-probably 2 cups to the mix and crushed Ritz crackers. On top I sprinkled cheese and crushed crackers as well. My husband likes the Cheddar's Broccoli Cheese Casserole so I was trying to find something similar for him.

My roommate is diabetic, so this is a great low carb meal for us! just 2 small tweaks: 1)I also add fresh baby bella mushrooms and decrease the broccoli to 2 packages of frozen (otherwise it will overflow my pan), 2) I add in some chicken, also. We've just used the Tyson canned all white meat chicken, mixed it in, and the results are AMAZING. it turns the dish from a side dish to a complete meal.   You could also use a roasted chicken from the store, but it takes longer to shred enough, ad we didn't taste a difference between that and the canned. GREAT recipe!!!

My roommate is diabetic, so this is a great low carb meal for us! just 2 small tweaks: 1)I also add fresh baby bella mushrooms and decrease the broccoli to 2 packages of frozen (otherwise it will overflow my pan), 2) I add in some chicken, also. We've just used the Tyson canned all white meat chicken, mixed it in, and the results are AMAZING. it turns the dish from a side dish to a complete meal.   You could also use a roasted chicken from the store, but it takes longer to shred enough, ad we didn't taste a difference between that and the canned. GREAT recipe!!!

EXCELLENT I made a small version. I used 10 0z broccoli, handful of baby carrots sliced, 2 T mayo,1/3 can cream of chicken soup, 1-2 T diced onion, 1/4 c egg beaters, 2-3 oz shredded cheddar.  Cook veggies tender crisp.  (onion 1 min in microwave)  Mix egg, mayo and soup and stir into cooled cooked veggies. Bake veggie - soup mixture at 350 until warm, cover with shredded cheese and broil top.

This was very good but I used low fat sour cream instead of mayo.  For the topping - 1/2 stick melted butter and herb flavored Pepperidge Farm stuffing.

Wonderful. The only change I made is I didn't add the egg (only because I didn't have any on hand) and it was still great!

This is a family favorite! The only thing we do differently is the addition of crushed cheez-it crackers, about 2 cups or so, to the top of the casserole. Yummmm! Thanks for posting this recipe.

Served this last night for a dinner party of 4.  Everyone loved it.  The only thing I did different was to use light mayo and lightly sprinkle bread crumbs on top.

This is pretty good.  I made it as an entree by adding chopped ham and served over noodles.  I used the low fat soup and low fat mayo.  As an entree there was too much broccoli.  Will cut that back to 1 pkg.  Was too salty with ham and will try chicken next time.

I made this recipe for Christmas dinner, and was soooo impressed.  I was a bit intimidated by the amount of mayo, but followed other reviewers advice and left it in.  I also added a little more cheese (velveeta), and used cream of onion soup, and left out the actual onion.  It was the best Brocoli and cheese casserole I've ever had.  My family raved and my husband has asked for it again and it's only 2 days since Christmas!  Thanks Staci!

Honestly,I did not care for this recipe at all. I love broccoli, but it tasted like the broccoli was way to cooked and I even added onion powder and garlic powder,and sharp cheddar cheese half mayo and half sour cream with mushroom soup and finely chopped onions, the flavors were off. I won't make this again. :(

This was very tasty. I am not usually a fan of broccoli casserole but was asked to make some for a pot luck and tried this recipe. I followed the advice of others and skipped the egg, used 1/2 cup each of mayo and sour cream, used white pepper instead of black, and added some garlic powder. I mixed all the other ingredients in a large bowl first then stirred in the broccoli before putting it all in a pan. I realized too late that I forgot to butter my pan and was worried it would stick but it didn't. I also made it the night before so the broccoli was no longer frozen and it took only about 35-40 min to cook. I'd definitely make this again. Everyone went back for seconds.

I love this dish and fixed it for Thanksgiving.  I was honored when my aunt who cooks 99% of the dinner, asked me for the recipe.  I do season the broccoli itself to avoid the dish from being bland. I use garlic powder, onion powder, and accent.

Exceptional! I followed the recipe to a T except that I did not add onions, I am not an onion fan :P Turned out great! I baked for 45 minutes and all seemed to be well cooked and the cheese was melted perfectly! I will definitely make this dish again!

The only reason I gave this a 4 star review is because it did not look as appetizing as it tasted. The soup/cheese/mayo mixture gives it a strange looking consistency. Despite that, it tasted delicious and I would definitely make it again. With this cook time, my cheese did not melt the entire way but I was afraid of cooking it any longer. May try to cook for a few more minutes next time.

In the past I always made a broccoli casserole on Thanksgiving using puff pastry on top.  I didn't have the puff pastry this time so decided on this recipe seeing the good reviews.  Between this and the slow cooker mashed potatoes I made and this my contribution to the meal that my extended family shared, was no great success.  This was not very flavorful. No one had more than a tiny polite portion of it. I won't try this one again.

Just made this for thanksgiving, it was just ok and nothing spectacular.I did use half cup of Mayo and half cup of sour cream and added more cheese as suggested on the reviews. I imagine this made the recipe better but It was nothing to rave about

Super easy, super delicious.  I didn't put the egg in, and didn't notice its absence at all.  I had to cook the dish for a little longer in high altitude, but it tasted great.  I didn't find that it warmed up very well the next day though.

I have made this numerous times and it is always delicious.  I use fresh broccoli instead of frozen (typically 2 pounds) and use about 1/2 the amount of cheese.

I doubled the recipe and made this for Thanksgiving.  I took the advice of others and used half mayonnaise and half sour cream and added the cracker crumb topping and also some onion powder and garlic salt.  I also added 1lb of diced ham (1/2 Virginia and 1/2 spicy Capicola) to make it a meal and everyone loved this casserole.  A little heavy for me but hey it was Thanksgiving.

I have been making this recipe for years and make one minor change: my son-in-law can't stand mushrooms so I use cream of celery soup. Everyone loves this dish -- including all four grandkids -- and there are never any leftovers! Try making this as-written before making any changes. You just might be surprised how good it is!

The taste was great but the consistency was off, I think its simply a cheese/egg issue, instead of creamy it was sorta clotted, It looked not so great but tasted well, next time I will omit the egg and sub in some sour cream, maybe a cream of broccoli soup as well.

took others' advice and used 1/2cup mayo, 1/2 cup sour cream. added 3/4 cup milk & omitted the egg. for the cheese, used 1/2 a block of velveeta, cubed. turns out much creamier, w/o the curdle problem! very yummy!!

Fantastic Recipe - Everyone loved it including those who aren't big into broccoli.

Used fresh broccoli and non-condensed soup w/ a little corn starch added.  Sprinkled some parmasan cheese on top before cooking along with the paprika.  Was awesome, will make again soon!

I really enjoyed this. I used fresh broccoli which I thought was a good idea and split the mayo with half light sour cream. I also sprinkled some bread crumbs on top for a little crunch. It was very tasty and I will definitely make it again.

I love this recipe. What I like best is that it uses ingredients that you have arounf the house. I had to throw something together because a friend of mine was a vegetarian. My mom and grandmother both asked for the recipe when I made it last Christmas. Also, I can make it as a side dish for an everyday meal it is so easy! Then have it for leftovers the next day. I usually add lots of garlic powder, some extra onion, and lemon pepper to give it more flavor.

This was so good. Had to change a few thing for lack of ingedients on hand...Used cream of chicken instead of mushroom and onion powder instead of onions...Also I added about 2 cups of cooked rice...Was sooo yummy. This one is a keeper. Also, I used the full amount of mayo and it was great, not over powering at all...dont be afraid...use it! I almost forgot..I only used 16oz of frozen broccoli, any more and it would have been way too much... Thanks for the great recipe

Yum! I used 12 oz. fresh broccoli florets that I steamed until they were a bit soft but not all the way cooked and then followed the recipe except I halved it because I had less broccoli. I thought it turned out great and hubby loved it!!

I made this recipe for a recent potluck and it was the only dish that people kept asking, "Who made the broccoli?" Even a co-worker who said she doesn't like broccoli, said she liked it! I made 2 modifications: I omitted the onions, used Cream of Mushroom soup with roasted garlic, and most likely threw in a little extra of the extra sharp cheddar cheese! Yum!

I'm wondering why everyone raves about this recipe!  It was definitely NOT "awesome" in my book.  I used less mayonnaise than called for, and even then it tasted WAY too mayonnaisey for me.  Hacking up the frozen broccoli was a chore, too.  If I make it again, I will use fresh cooked broccoli, more cheese and less mayo, and other veggies.  (The added mushrooms sounded like a good idea!)  When I offered this to the neighbors, the parents liked it but their 4 kids said NO WAY!

I made this for my office's Thanksgiving shindig last year and made something similar this year.  Everyone was wondering why I didn't make the delicious dish that I made last year!  Guess I won't make that mistake again next year!

Superb! I took the tip from the video of splitting the mayo and lightly steaming fresh broccoli. I didn't have any sour cream, so I added cream cheese and it was wonderful. I also added potato chips on the top. I prefer cornflakes for the crunchiness but only had potato chips around. Adding to my recipe box!

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe, although I confess, I altered it slightly. When shopping, I misread the amount of broccoli called for and bought less than needed. To compensate for the lack of filling, I added cooked rice to the mix. Also, I liked the idea of a crunchy top, so I sprinkled crushed canned onion rings and croutons on the top before baking. It turned out great. One of my daughters thought it was the best broccoli casserole she had ever had. Thanks, Stacy!

I really, really liked this.  I, too, did 1/2 cup of mayo and 1/2 cup of sour cream.  My only issue with this dish is that I don't think the cook time is long enough or my oven temp is low - I cooked it for at least an hour at 350 like the recipe states and the broccoli didn't heat through til done and was a little too al dente for me.  I am in a new townhome, so my oven temp may be off.  Otherwise, easy and extremely tasty!  Thanks for posting!

Sooo yummy! My casserole came out of the oven about 20 minute ago and I just had a taste. The only edit I made was using half mayo / half sour cream. I used Campbell's heart healthy cream of mushroom, light mayo, and light sour cream to trim some calories.

Add diced onions and garlic to taste.  Been making this for years.
Also, if you have Mrs. Dash-herb spice mix--add a good dose of this as well.

Very good recipe.  The sauce is very rich, and I did cut down on the mayo.  Served with baked ham and it was the perfect accompaniment.

This is the best broccoli cheese casserole ever! I made it for a family dinner and everyone was asking for more. I only made it with the cheese, mayo, and cream of broccoli soup and it was awesome.

I loved this!  It reminds me of a quiche but without the bread.  I used low-fat and fat-free ingredients and it still came out great.  It's SO easy, too!  I had also thought that bacon or even cubed ham might be a good addition next time.

It was *okay*. We certainly ate it, but from the reviews, I thought it would be a new favorite side dish for T'giving. My problem with it was that it wasn't creamy cheesy, and that is what I was hoping for. There is very little cheese flavor, IMO. I'll keep looking for a different recipe.

I only had two FRESH heads of broccoli which I cooked and chopped; to that, I added cooked cauliflower to equal 2 lbs. of cooked veggies.  The result was delicious but I felt it did not need salt, likely because I used salted water to boil the veggies - and the strong cheddar also contains a lot of salt.  I finished off the whole casserole myself over 2 1/2 days, eating it as a main course each time!  (I had better make and serve it on special occasions only because of that guilt-inducing whole cup of mayonnaise! I am writing this review two pounds heavier than I was before I started to make it......)

This was easy to make, but pretty mediocre taste-wise.  I liked it more than everyone else did.  Probably will keep searching for that "perfect" broccoli casserole recipe.

I loved how simple this was. The taste was good, it wasn't too dry..it was just perfect. The only thing that I added was I put crushed buttery crackers on top and then cooked it, just for some added crunch.

My mother has been making this casserole for years and my husband loves it.  Although I prefer to add some seasoned bread crumbs on top before baking.  Also, I would recommend cooking the broccoli too so that it's softer.

This was awefull, I am sorry. Made I put too much of something or forgot to put something in, but I did not like. I use to have a recipe like this that was really good and it had chicken it it, so I gave this one a try since I lost my other recipe and thought it would be a good side dish. It didn't turn out. I won't make this again.

Served this for Xmas and everyone loved it.  I used fresh broccoli which worked just fine.  This would be great for a pot luck as well but is elegant enough for a festive occasion. Terrific!

This is really yummy.  I crumbled up Ritz crackers on the top before I baked it and that really made this casserole!  I brought this to a dinner and everyone was asking for the recipe.

I made this for Thanksgiving.  It was a hit!  I used fresh broccoli instead of the frozen.  I also used 1/2 c light sour cream & 1/2 c fat free mayo.

This is the same recipe my grandmother handed down to me and it is always a hit. I use Italian seasoned stuffing for the topping and dot wth butter.

Great easy recipe.  I made this for a work holiday party and everyone wanted the recipe.  I made a lowfat version with lowfat cheese, soup, mayo and cooking spray and it still came out great.  I cut the mayo in half and added a half can more of soup to cut the mayo taste.  I also added fresh baby portobello mushrooms and spicy ceasoning.

The thing that sold me on this recipe was the fact that you made it with the broccoli still frozen.  I baked it for one hour, and it was absolutely delicious.  I used a touch more cheese than the recipe called for.  Rave reviews from all that had some.

I used cream of celery soup and added bacon bits. I topped it with corn flakes because that was what I had in the house but like the butter cracker idea.

This is awesome! I made only 2 changes, otherwise I followed the directions as written. I left out the onions, there were no onion eaters in our gathering except for me. The 2nd change was: I took 45 Ritz crackers and crushed them in a bowl and added 1 stick of melted butter; mixed this together and spread on top. Everyone thought this was awesome and even asked to take some home. Will definitely make again.

We doubled the recipe for 12 people. We used 3/4 qty. extra old cheddar which we assume is what Americans call sharp and added 1/4 Tex Mex shredded cheese. Probably added a bit more cheese. We used fresh broccoli. Topped with tortilla strips, plain as well as chipotle which you can get in Canada: President's Choice label.  Used a foil pan, shallow turkey size, it's cheap and no dishwashing. People raved about it, big-time. Even getting calls the next day saying it was awesome!

This recipe is delicious! The first time making a casserole dish AND the first recipe I made off of here! My family, as well as I LOVED IT! In fact I am making it again tonight. In the last month, I've made this dish 3X now. I took a few tweaks from everyone whom suggested the half mayo and half sour cream. So full of taste! Stellar! We incorporated this dish into a main dish, rather than a side dish. I boiled 2 (6oz) of chicken breast, shredded and added it to the bowl. As well as doubled up on cheese. Served it with a side of basmati rice. This is definitely a family fave!!!

This was incredible!! Other than cutting all the stalks off and adding some cooked rice, I made a few of other changes:
I steamed the veggies in the microwave beforehand so that they didn't come out crunchy in the casserole. Instead of using 1 cup of mayo, I used only a 1/2 cup and then used 1/2 cup of sour cream. I used more sharp shredded cheddar cheese than what was called for and mixed it into casserole. I also sprinkled some of the cheese on top of the casserole. Lastly, I added crushed Cheez-It crackers during the last 20 minutes of baking as a topping.

The kids really liked this, maybe use 12 oz of sharp cheddar next time.  Made quite a large casserole.  Could consider adding some chicken for a one dish meal

Turned out great. I used 2 8oz bags of mild cheddar cheese instead of sharp and put a layer of ritz crackers to the top of it. I lightly broke the crackers by hand. Casserole turned out great and was devoured at thanksgiving dinner.

I doubled this recipe and par-boiled fresh broccoli.   Tasted great. Would love to add some garlic next time.  Will make again.  And yes if you like a little crunch add some crackers to the top.

I've made this several times.  It's a standard pot luck recipe and a good guideline.  I cook the veggies first  almost all the way first for a bit faster total cook time, and top with crushed ritz crackers before baking.  I have also used other veggies, substituting part of the broccoli when I didn't have enough on hand.  I have added zucchini, yellow squash, corn, and/or peas on different occasions.  I add pepper but omit extra salt, since the cheese and crackers in my version have enough.  Still delicious.

My kids will gladly eat this broccoli!
I made two modification.
1. I eliminated the condensed soup.(To reduce the carbs.)
2. I use about 11/2 tsp of Paprika instead of to pinches.

Super easy and super tasty.  I kept ratios exactly as stated, but reduced for 3 servings.  Definitely making this one again!

I LOVE this recipe. I make it often (holidays or not) and it frequently gets requested at events!! We don't really like onions so I leave them out and don't think it needs any more salt than is in the soup so I leave it out as well. I only use broccoli florets. I flourish it up with crushed Ritz crackers drizzled with a couple TBSP of melted butter!

My mom used to make this too!  We used to love eating for breakfast the next morning!  I now make it for my family.  They still beg for it.  We only use 1/2 cup mayo and only the broccoli crowns.  Enjoy! Play with it if you like.  We like Cream of celery better and more cheese...sharp cheddar! Thanks for posting this great recipe!

Add 3 cloves of garlic, plenty of black pepper, and a bit of cumin and it'd be 5 stars.

I love this! I did also add cream cheese and extra cheddar cheese, then topped it off with fresh grated Parmesan cheese. My family loved it last Thanksgiving and asked for it again this year!!!!

I make this recipe every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas.  I make a few changes based on personal experience over several years.  I use chopped broccoli and 1/2 cup Mayo and 1/2 cup of sour cream, along with about 8 ounces of cheddar cheese, 4 ounces of extra sharp cheddar and about 1/2 cup of ghouda cheese.  I will bake it for about 45 minutes, remove it and crumble ritz crackers on top and continue to bake for about 15 minutes.  It is simply amazing!  Great recipe as a starter and it leaves room for your own improvements.  Always a great hit with everyone at the dinner table.  The only complaint I get is that I never make enough :)

This was great!!
I switched a few things around after reading the other reviews and it came out way better than I had expected, ALL my kids ate it which is great as there is usually one who won't eat at EVERY meal.

I used 2 bunches fresh broccoli and 1 head of fresh cauliflower which I boiled for a little bit first. 1/2 cup each of mayo and sour cream.
No egg as I have an egg allergy and no topping although I may try that next time. 
I only used a little pepper and salt to season and didn't measure any cheese, just grated it and mixed it in.
I'll definitely be making this again - so quick and easy to prepare !!

I thought this was okay but not great. I had made this because of all the positive reviews and some reviews about their kids liking it. I have a 7 year old who is a picky eater but had wanted brocolli and cheese which she loves but would not touch it made this way.

I really liked this. I made it for a Thanksgiving dinner at church and got many compliments on it. My two young daughters liked it as well. It makes a BIG casserole. The ingredients were not that expensive and it was easy to make. Next time I might put a we bit more paprika on it than I did this time. It gives it a great flavor and also makes it look nice and pretty.

Amazing! I had to use cream of chicken soup as that is all I had. My kid loves broccoli and asks for it pretty much every night. This is a GREAT way to change it up! I wouldn't change a thing!

I tried this with frozen broccoli that I cooked in microwave as directed, put in strainer for cooling about ten minutes. I mixed everything together and poured into baking dish topped with Pepperidge farm herb stuffing and butter. I've added chicken or Jimmy Dean sausage cooked and crumble. I like the sour cream instead of mayo. Will try with cooked rice and use Ritz crackers for topping. I rated the original recipe.

I didn't like the texture that the egg gave this dish.  I would omit the egg and maybe do parmesan cheese instead of cheddar to make it more of a gratin....otherwise it was ok.

I made this side dish for my family and everyone loved it!  Left out the salt just as personal preference but kept everything else the same.  Will definitely be making it again.

This is sooo delicious! To make it more healthy I use 3/4 can of fat free cream of mushroom soup, 1/4 cup of light miracle whip, 1/4 cup sour cream, and add 1 cup of diced portabella mushrooms. I also top with crushed ritz crackers for a crunchy topping. A great potluck dish. Thanks Stacy!

Reading the reviews I changed the 1 cup of mayo for 1/2 cup of mayo and 1/2 cup of sour cream, adding more cheese also. This bake had a lot of flavor, changing up serving just regular vegeables.   Very good!!!

I served this with prime rib for Christmas eve dinner. It was very good...wouldn't quite use the word 'awesome'. I used fresh broccoli that I had steamed. I will probably keep making this a couple times per month in the future.

Excellent, I did this for Christmas dinner and doubled the recipe because there were 20 guests. I modified like others on the mayonaise doing half sour cream. Everyone loved it, no leftovers.  My brother that never says anything said it was outstanding. I will do this again.

I included this in my Thanksgiving day menu of things i've NEVER made before. I hosted with my husband for the first time and this was a huge hit! I actually DOUBLED the ingredients and used the advice of others which included half may half sour cream, and crumbled cracker topping with melted butter on top. EVERYONE loved it and its almost gone just one day later.

It was fun to try, but I wouldn't make it again. Watch out for the salt, perhaps not adding any because the mushroom soup is salty enough.

Pretty good.  I served it with easter.  IT went over pretty well considering how many people turned their noses up at the idea of broccoli at the table.  Next time i think i'll use velveeta.  I was hoping for a smoother "cheese sauce" and ours stayed lumpy.

This is great! I added a little more cheese and topped it with crushed ritz crackers. It was a big hit at both of our Thansgiving dinners! THANKS!

Pretty good, but I missed the rice that's usually in Broc & Cheese casseroles, and I thought it could use more cheese.

This IS an awesome casserole, even if my waistline does not thank you for it!  Too rich to make often, but well worth the extra trips to the gym.

I made this last night after getting home from work pretty late (I work 2nd shift).  This recipe was so easy to prepare and was totally yummy!  I didn't even bother mixing it in a large bowl like the recipe states.  I just mixed all the ingredients into my casserole dish and popped it into the oven for an hour.  I will definitely be making this one again.  I might experipment by switching out the broccoli for another veggie, like string beans or cauliflower!  AWESOMELY GOOD!

I served this at a dinner party and no one liked it.  Although the flavor was ok, the consistency was too runny.  I also crumbled Ritz crackers and a little butter on the top, which burned within a few minutes and had to be scrapped into the trash.  I think next time I'll choose a recipe with rice to give it a thicker consistency.

I must have done something wrong.  Maybe I bought a bad batch of broccoli. The liquid didn't evaporate so it was soupy.  I had made this to bring to a Thanksgiving dinner....

This was good!  I added fried onions on the top & baked a little longer to brown them.  Overall it was easy & good.  Very easy for a potluck!

This recipe was good but I think it was missing something. Maybe some cauliflower or rice would have been a nice addition. This recipe is even better heated up in the microwave the next day! (For crunch, I added french fried onions to the top and baked 10 minutes longer)

This was a yummy, cheesy casserole and a great way to get my broccoli intake (and fat intake, too!). I halved the recipe as I was only making it for my husband and I in order to try it out, and added a dash of garlic powder and dill to the soup/mayo mixture. I also added a tad more cheese. When I pulled it out of the oven it was quite liquidy in the middle, which concerned me, but after it sat out it firmed right up and tasted great.

I'm thrilled with this recipe!  This is my first review and I've been using allrecipes for years, I just HAD to review this!  My favorite recipe of all time is broccoli rice casserole which is similar to this but just has cream of mushroom- no mayo.  Since starting a low carb diet I could no longer enjoy my favorite dish.  I'm so glad I found this- it tastes very much like my old favorite except for the mayo flavor (which lowers the carbs tremendously) and I can indulge.  I don't eat a lot and I had 2 large servings of it today.  Wonderful!!!  I think other veggies and cheeses would be good as well and I might play around with other soups since cream of mushroom is rather high in carbs but still isn't too high that I went over.  Thanks so much!

Easy and Delicious!  Absolutely no changes are necessary for this recipe to turn out perfectly.  My husband found this recipe years ago and we have loved it everytime we've made it!  Thanks, Stacy!
