Great! I used strawberry jello, very ripe cantelope and watermelon, no banana, and vanilla yogurt. Kids loved them and so did I.

If you have children you have to try these! I came across this recipe today, and decided to try it. I used strawberry gelatin and used stawberry yogurt, because it was in the house. They tasted really good. My 4 year old loved them and there was barely any Mess!! She even put the popsicle on the table for a few minutes and it didn't melt, it just left a little drip. And best of all no sticky hands!

A big hit! I have kids coming to my back door asking "do you have any of those popsicle things?" I use sugar-free Jello and non-fat vanilla yogurt. They are more like a yogurt-pop than a popsicle, but are much more healthful than anything the ice cream man offers!!

I used strawberry yogurt and gelatin.  My son loved them and my husband thought they tasted like a sorbet.  Definitely easy and mess-free.

My mom and I really like these pops this summer.  I just tried sugar free peach jello and frozen peaches, also I added one small packet of Truvia and they are great.

I thought these were OK, but my husband didn't like them.  They had a weird texture, tho I think that is why they are dripless.  I think they might be better if I used different flavors.

These just tasted like yogurt on a stick. My daughter liked them though, but I'll probably not make them again.

Very good----used black cherry jello and vanilla yogurt.  Weird texture when it melted (as my 4-year old let happen) but good when eaten right away.

This recipie was great!  Quick and easy, definately kid friendly.  I used vanilla yogurt instead of plain yogurt; gave it an extra flavor.  Had a yogurt taste, but was very good.

I made these yesterday for my kids (and husband) when the weather was super hot.  I think some of the more negative reviewers may not have left them in the freezer long enough.  I, too, took them out too early and they were falling off the sticks...but the kids didn't mind a bit.  There were a few left in the freezer that were eaten several hours after the first set and they were very frozen and very yummy.  Give yourself time to allow these to freeze up properly and you won't be at all disappointed.

I am giving this a 4 because of ease, non dripability and the fact that my 3 year old LOVES THESE!! We used Lime Jello and Vanilla yogurt.  The texture is like a dense sponge- SO weird. I couldn't eat them and neither would my 6 and 8 year old but the little guy couldn't get enough. Will make a again for him.

My 2 year old grandson loved these! I used regular strawberry Jello, and strawberry-banana yogurt, plus a very ripe banana.  The consistency is great for young children and they truly are NO-Drip!! Thank you!  Makes a lot too!

I was not only looking for a low-cal ice pop for these long summer days, but also looking for a way to use up excess sugar-free Jello that I'd bought cheap at Grocery Outlet.

I used sugar free cherry Jello and dissolved the Jello in the hot water, then poured it in my blender with nonfat/sugar-free strawberry yogurt and the banana. When I tried a bit of it, it tasted AWESOME. Not only are these a cool down snack for the kids, they are a lowfat treat for me. Score! This made 
ten 3/4 full dixie cups, enough for a couple days. I made them the night before so they'd be ready the next day, especially those times when the kids can
hear the ice cream truck and want a popcicle. 

I'll for sure be making this all summer.
I've got tons of jello and a container of
yogurt is always cheap. Plus, it's easy enough that the older kids can help!

I am completely impressed!  I bought some twist up pop containers at Walmart and then saw this recipe.  I used fresh strawberries and strawberry gelatin.  I used plain yogurt but didn't skimp on anything by making it fat-free because I wanted my kids to have the extra calories since they are so young.  

Normally I don't like yogurt and can't stand gelatin.  These things ROCKED!  I loved the taste of them and they really don't drip.  My kids adored them and now we have a new favorite snack that's healthy and fun to make for all.

These were REALLY good popsicles.  I didn't have any bananas, so i left them out, and it still turned out great! I used lime jello mix and vanilla yogurt, then i froze the mixture in popsicle moulds.

I used lime jello and lime light yogurt, which could have contributed to the strange taste.  I'm sure that strawberry would go better with banana.  That said, I'm really not sure I would try this recipe again, anyway.  Every single popsicle stick has pulled out of the popsicle while trying to remove the popsicle.  I haven't had this problem with other recipes.

These were ok.  I was looking for something lo-cal to make and with ingredients I already had.  I used strawberry-banana no-fat yogurt and cherry sugar free jello.  Very tasty. Be sure to freeze completely to avoid the spongy texture.  I'll try other flavors later and maybe see if I can leave the banana out.

I don't know why mine are different from everyone else but they were awful. The taste was tolerable but the texture was rather foamy and chewy. The kids wouldn't eat them.

We made these for a party for the 4th of July.  I used berry blue Jell-o and added an extra banana.  They were pretty tasty, not overly sweet.  The kids enjoyed them, especially the pretty blue color, and I did too.  I can't wait to experiment with other flavors of Jell-o and different fruits.

I used full-sugar jello with these pops, and they still had no flavor. If they did have flavor, though, I would have liked them.

My daughter absolutely loves these popsicles...........I used apricot jello & used 2 bananas instead of 1 and they were great.  I also tried it with strawberry jello & vanilla yogurt and she loved those too.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These are exactly how they are described.  My kids dropped them on the floor and they bounced.  No drips at all!! Not very flavorful though.  I add chopped strawberries and pineapple to the next batch and they were much better.

very good, i didn't have just plain yogurt so i mixed vanilla with strawberry banana yogurt and it's very good, adds to the fresh banana. kind of soft and i used plastic sticks so it slid when trying to eat, other wise extremely yummy!

I liked these, but my husband was weirded out by the texture.  Definitely more of a yogurt bar than a popsicle.

My son (and all the neighborhood kids) love these popsicles.  He loves to pick out the jello flavor, and then share with his friends.  They are super easy to make, and good for you.

I made these with my 3 yr. old grandson in sailboat Popsicle molds.  He loves cherries so used sugar free cherry Jello (so diabetic grandpa could join us), 1 cup sweet cherries (half put in blender, half chopped and added at the end), and Greek style cherry yogurt. Oh my goodness, they were DELICIOUS!  Even my 18 month old grandson was able to eat one without an enormous mess.  Next weekend we will be making Blueberry Pops, as requested by the 3 yr. old!  "Let's make blue ones!" Trying to decide which flavor Jello to use.

Easy to make  and were a great hit with my two - year old grandson!  He ate 2!   They could be a little creamier, I wondered about using milk and pudding instead of water and jello!
