I doubled this to make four servings. I made this whole dish in my cast iron skillet--very simple, quite tasty. I served it with homemade salsa and a little reduced fat sour cream. My family LOVED this breakfast egg dish. My husband and I especially loved the combination of chorizo and pepperjack cheese, my kids just loved the whole thing. It's seriously an easier version of breakfast burritoes!

Delicious - perfect to split with my husband!  Clean-up was a breeze with this one pan breakfast. I add just a little milk to the eggs to get them nice and fluffy and added a little garlic and onion powders for additional flavor.  I used a light Mexican blend cheese and topped it with a little homemade salsa and a dollup of reduced fat sour cream - YUM!  Thanks for another great recipe Chef John!

Really yummy. I used homemade chorizo, reduced fat mexican cheese and egg whites. Added a few red pepper flakes to compensate for not having pepperjack

This was made with Spanish chorizo which is dry cured and does not have the flavor of Mexican chorizo.  So, this dish is neither Mexican nor Spanish.  That said,  I love Spanish chorizo too but you need far more than 2 ounces to get any flavor from it for 4 eggs.  This chorizo is very hard and I use scissors to cut it up, cook it then add your other ingredients.  I really recommend using Mexican chorizo which imparts far more flavor and does not need a lot of chopping.  Just add it to your pan and chop it as cooks with your spatula, then add eggs and add the mixture to cooked corn tortillas.

Comida bueno! (Good meal!)If you like Tex-Mex flavor, you'll like this easy, quick breakfast dish. Substituted spring onions for chives, and I also used corn tortillas. Garnished with sour cream and a few reserved tortilla strips. Another fabulous recipe from Chef John! I'll make it again!

My family  and I really enjoyed this recipe. We made it with corn tortillas. Chef John: you sounded like you were almost apologizing for the taste in your video. Maybe if you change the strips to corn tortillas and reshoot the video, more people would be willing to try it. It really is a great recipe, but you shouldn't use tortillas that taste like "drywall".

It's always the simple recipes that comfort the best! My mom had made something like this when we were growing up, "tortilla frita con huevos" and this recipe is very similar. It was delicious, the only variation was to use corn tortillas which were the only ones I had in my fridge. I will try with flour next time.

I have to agree with Chef John about the whole wheat tortillas; they can double for dry wall.  I made this with leftover, stale regular tortillas....very good. I would think it would be amazing using corn tortillas, though. Just sayin'...

This recipe was simple and tasty. I added onion, salt and pepper into the eggs before adding them to the skillet. I'd make it again.
