Based on the other reviewer's remarks, I was concerned that this wouldn't set, so I looked at some other recipes on-line and sort of merged them with this.  Here's what I did: All the fruit from my 2 cacti.  I have no idea how many. Cut them in half lengthwise. Did NOT skin them.  Put them in a pot with an inch of water in the bottom and boiled and smashed them for 30 minutes. Strained the juice using my nut bag. Don't worry.  The prickles seem to boil down with the juice.  Ended up with about 6 cups juice. Added juice from one lemon to the cooled prickly pear juice.  Added 2 boxes pectin. Brought to hard boil. Added 8 cups sugar + 1 tsp cinnamon (Why not? I like cinnamon) and brought back to a boil x 1 min.  Canned with 1/8 inch head space.  No problems setting for me, but my photo is the lighter colored jelly. Your fruit will have more natural pectin when it is barely ripe. Mine probably technically should have stayed on the plant longer. But - The 10 y/o has tasted and approves and it set well, so no complaints. Probably will make every year when my cacti fruits.

I think that I have prickly pear jam, and not jelly, as there is some pulpy stuff that floated to the top of the jar!  That being said, this recipe was pretty easy. I added a bit less sugar, and boiled it for about 5 minutes, then processed for about 30 minutes. (I live at 6500 ft, so made altitude adjustments)  I used the jar of pectin (about 2 packages ) for 6 cups of prickly pear juice. It seems to have set up well, and it sure tasted yummy when I licked the scraper. I got 12 half pint jars from 6 cups of juice and 8 cups of sugar. Super fun gift from the cactus in my neighborhood. :)

I made this jelly twice the first batch was with orange and red prickly pear.  The orange variety set up nicely the red remained liquid so it would make a nice beverage syrup or syrup for pancakes or waffles, very tasty.  the second batch I just made  using the red fruit, I used a pectin and calcium mix and it really thickened up so I expect once it is out of the canner it should jell nicely.

Cactus handling tips: pick your prickly pears with all metal tongs and place in a metal bowl (cactus spines stick in plastic and silicone). Burn off the spines before handling the fruit. I used the metal tongs and my gas range burner. The spines will flame slightly, smolder, then leave a soot mark on the fruit. This makes them easy to peel, too, as the flame has a blanching-type effect. 

I ended up with 5 1/2 cups of strained prickly pear juice/puree, so I expanded the recipe accordingly (8 1/4 cups sugar, 3 2/3 oz lemon juice). I also used Pomona's universal pectin so my technique was slightly different with cooking - I added the Pomona's calcium water to the juices (5 1/2 teaspoons). Then I added only 2 cups of sugar mixed with the Pomona's pectin (5 1/2 teaspoons) until it was dissolved, then added the rest of the sugar. This started to set up before I even got it into my canning jars, so I was sure I ruined it. I was wrong! It set up beautifully and spreads like a dream. It tastes amazing. If I had to do it all over I'd add a wee bit more lemon juice; our prickly pears were super ripe.

I made one batch following the recipe exactly and ended up with syrup. The next three batches, I doubled the amount of pectin and they all came out beautifully.

PCLARKRN I wonder if I could "redo" the batch and add two boxes of pectin?  I used two with a double batch.  Thanks!

In place of a blender (which is major overkill for macerating tunas!) I use a manual food mill. After gently scrubbing off the hair-like glochids on the fruit's surface I remove the outerskin as suggested, place the fruit with seeds in the food mill and voilá, seed-free juice ready for use! This batch is going to make tuna gelato.

Turned out great! Thanks
I like videos it helps me visualize what it suppose to look like.  I used this site and another site to get it right.
