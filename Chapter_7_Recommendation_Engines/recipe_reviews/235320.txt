Very simple recipe, but very flavorful. I made it exactly as written, except I added a bit of garlic powder when browning the meat. A wonderful twist on stuffed peppers, and a nice change from the usual ground beef/rice/tomato sauce recipes you always see.  The gouda and liquid smoke are just the right touch to give these a light smokiness, without being overpowering.  These are healthy too, and one pepper is just the right amount. I was looking forward to having these as my lunches though out the week! Thanks for the great recipe kflamed13! I will definitely be making these again, except next time I might use green, or even red peppers. These orange ones were expensive little suckers! :)

This a good basic stuffed pepper recipe. I amped up the flavor a few ways. Use low sodium chicken broth instead of water. Add your favorite all purpose seasoning to the turkey as it cooks like Mrs Dash. Add salt and pepper. I also used fire roasted canned tomatoes. Try a dash or two of  Cholula brand hot sauce as a condiment. That really added a kick but didn't overwhelm the other flavors. Loved the lower fat choice of turkey. I used 93% Honeysuckle White Ground Turkey.  I plan to make ahead next time and have on hand for a quick weeknight supper.

So good! I used a bit more gouda (even topping all of them with a good layer) and added garlic into my turkey, but kept everything else the same. I used green peppers just because of cost. I love stuffed peppers and this is definitely a recipe I will keep.

A great base. I used a mix of ground chorizo and turkey and added more garlic and paprika. Next time I'll cook the rice separate as some of mine was uncooked, but that was more likely my cooking mistakes and not the recipe. Thanks

Excellent stuffed peppers. I skipped the liquid smoke and used mozzarella cheese instead of Gouda. I will make these again and use the Gouda next time.

I halved the recipe and sliced open the peppers for easier serving. I did add more of the diced tomatoes than indicated and added a banana pepper in the mix. One reviewer cooked the rice with broth and I did that as well to add some flavor. I only had cheddar and mozzarella so I did half cheddar and half mozzarella.  I did top each pepper half with a little mozzarella. It was delicious!

Very good, but i left out the liquid smoke. I think the next time I will slice the peppers lengthwise just to make it easier to eat.

I craved a stuffed pepper while pregnant but, needed it to be light as my morning sickness was a beast. I found this recipe and it was great for my entire pregnancy. I omitted the liquid smoke and just used a half of round of smoked Gouda. It was delicious and freezes great for later.

I used this recipe for inspiration (and very helpful prep info). Instead of turkey I substituted all the vegetables that were on the 'way out' in my fridge and didn't use the liquid smoke. My husband and kid liked it a lot. Thanks for posting it kflamed13!

Different style of stuffed peppers - came out very good.  The mixture of  liquid smoke and the gouda cheese gave it an interesting flavor I wasn't sure I would like but I did.  I thought the only thing it needed was salt and pepper.

I took the advice of other reviewers and added garlic pepper and some Italian seasoning.  Also used chicken broth instead of water.  This was delicious!  Will be on my "keeper" list.

Worth making again with a few changes. I will try rotel instead of tomatoes and pepperjack cheese. It was just too bland.

I am giving this 3 stars because I found it to be a bit lacking in flavor.  That said, I did make a couple of adaptations which may have affected the result.  First, I halved the recipe for the two of us.  I used green peppers because the orange ones were four times as expensive.  I had a 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes and added the whole can  (I hated to throw half of it away) instead of adding any water.  A little added garlic, salt and pepper helped, but I would probably not make this again.

For the work that goes into it, it was a little bland. I did use chicken stock instead of water and also put in fresh garlic. It just needs a little more depth.  Husband used hot sauce on his and I did barbecue sauce!

This is basically a stuffed pepper recipe using ground turkey versus another meat like beef or pork. Any changes made are to give flavor to the bland turkey taste.

This was a good base recipe. The stuffing needed more flavor so I added  garlic and lots of  herbs from my garden. I also don't like tomatoes, so I cut up the tops from the peppers very small and added them. I used chicken broth instead of water to make the rice. I think liquid smoke is weird so I used SMOKED GOUDA. I would definitely make these again. I loved the ground turkey.

Very easy to make. Turkey is quite bland so adding spices to the recipe is a must. I also didn't cook the peppers first like the recipe says to since they cook for almost a half hour when assembled. My son ate  2 whole peppers right off the bat.

Great starter, especially if  you you like these ingredients.  I love yellow  and orange peppers over green since they're sweeter.  I made the following changes: used beef seasoned with onion and garlic power, seasoned salt, pepper, worcestershire sauce;  a bag of precooked Trader Joe's Frozen Brown Rice; a can of tomato sauce and mozzarella and half o the iquid smoke.  I also microwaved the peppers in a water bath for 4 minutes instead of boiling. I saved some of the sauce for the pan and the tops of the peppers. Covered and baked for 45 minutes at 350 until tender.

I thought this was easy, and used chicken broth. Went the traditional italian with lots of seasoning and garlic. Used stewed tomatoes and a little spaghetti sauce in the mix with brown rice. yummy.
