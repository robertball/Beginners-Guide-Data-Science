I used frozen pizza dough and served each as an entree.

Awesome!  I made my own crust using quick and easy pizza crust (from this site).  I love the combo of ingredients, nice & lite.  I may add a spoonful of sauce, or maybe even white sauce (yum) next time but good without as well.  Thanks CLM!

I agree commercially made dough would ruin this recipe.  I used the pizza dough recipe from Joy of Cooking and also added a layer of marinara sauce.  The taste of the blue cheese was good but the texture when melted (i.e. runny) was not ideal.  I would probably use good old mozzarella next time.

SO incredibly easy! These will be a staple around our house - we are planning to experiment with other cheeses and toppings. YAY! The kids ate Spinach!

I thought that this was a great recipe! Instead of folding the corners in, I folded it in half like a pizza pocket. Serve with marinara or a ceasar dressing for dipping! Yummy and a nice change from traditional pizza.

I thought that this recipes was amazing... but my family didn't! I am a self-professed healthh nut, and if you aren't into eating healthy, you probably won't like this recipe. The real kicker is the blue cheese- it's very distinct in taste! But I agree with the other reviewer that the measured amounts of spinach and blue cheese were way too much! I think i only used 1/2 cup of spinach and 1 tablsoon each of blue cheese.  Also, the baking time was a little too long, at least for me.  Mine got a little too brown... Hope you have better luck!

The good stuffing ingredients were ruined by the awful, bitter, chemical-shot Pillsbury pizza dough.  Also the measured amounts were way off - a cup of spinach leaves in one calzone?  No way!  Same with the garlic, onions, mushrooms, blue cheese.  Finally, this serves 2 - not 4, and as a main dish - serving 2 hungry people is pushing it.
