I tried this recipe the first time with my Bunco Group.  It was such a hit!  A nice change from the "sweet things" and everyone wanted the recipe.  Since I have used it again and again and it is always well received.  Very different!!!

This was a very easy recipe to pull together, though I made a few adjustments.  I used less than a full red onion (as it appeared 'overpowering') and I lightly tossed the red onion in the liquid before drizzling over the blue cheese.  Lastly, we had some left over and the blending of flavors overnight was marvelous.  If you have the time, I'd encourage making it at least 3-4 hours ahead of time.  Very easy and lots of raves!

This is a wonderful appetizer that is easy and colorful. Have tried this with other vinegar based dressings...including a classic Hozel tarragon dressing. But always use Maytag Blue cheese

This is certainly a mature dish. I decrease the amount of red wine vinegar because it tends to start tasting like Italian dressing, which usually masks anything it touches.

I cut back on the red onion, and cubed the blue cheese instead of crumbling.  Was very good and easy to pull together.  Would suggest making it several hours before serving as it taste better as the flavors blend.

I made this the night ahead as others had said it was even better after it had sat overnight....but I ate the whole thing!  I LOVE this.  I doubled the lemon juice...and added more capers and onions..as these are all things my family loves.

I love blue cheese also, and this was really easy and delicious.  I am sure my friends are going to get tired of seeing it so often as it's now one of my favorites.  Thanks so much for sharing it with us.

Absolutely my favorite appetizer to date. Hubs loves it too but not his absolute fav (he loves jalapeno poppers too much methinks!) 1) We're on a low-end budget so I couldn't justify the use of olive oil for just the 'folks@home' but it was still *very* good (I'm sure w/olive oil it's better still) 2) We're predisposed to blue-cheese dressings w/a touch of sugar, so I added about a half-teaspoon or so of raw sugar which was perfect for us 3) I didn't measure anything, I just dumped what 'looked right to me' in a bowl - but used all of the ingredients listed - so this is pretty flexible, IMHO 4) I left the bowl out on the counter for a couple of hours since I forgot to make it ahead.  This is good @room temp, so that worked pretty well, &yes, it tasted significantly different after sitting for that time. (no leftovers, so can't compare an overnight fridging yet) 5) I don't care for this on Ritz but like it on celery, & adore it on thinly sliced toast (used some leftover bread from Jo's Rosemary Bread from this site sliced in thin slices, toasted w/garlic oil brushed on lightly) 6) I also liked just one thin slice of turkey breast from the deli on it 7) A couple slices of the toast w/this dip spread on top & a piece of deli sliced turkey on each, together w/salad, & possibly egg drop soup - would be an ideal meal to me..... Yum! 8) Agree w/reviewer that this is good on salad too. Thanks, DEG1, for sharing.  I'm sure I'll make this often for meals, on salads, &4 get togethers.

I made this for two different groups this past weekend and got rave reviews from both. It is a bit unusual which makes it fun to serve. I made this about 2 hrs before guests came and let it sit out which allowed the cheese to become very spreadable on crackers. Made as directed and it is perfect without doctoring at all. Empty dish after each group!

Thanks for the recipe!

Forgot to add the capers at first, was great either way. I would add less capers at first then add to taste or even keep them on the side of the dish because they are so strong in flavor I found too many in one bite masked the other flavors. If you love strong flavors, this is a great dip. I followed others advice about letting sit out for an hour, the longer it sat out the better. Was great the next morning (I did put it the fridge overnight). Would be great served as a wedge salad.

This dish has become 1 of my Go To recipes.  I made it exactly as the recipe states, and if you're feeding a crowd that's over the age of 50, don't change a thing.              However, when I'm entertaining a wide age group, I do 50/50 bleu cheese and feta cheese.

Yummy. You have to really like blue cheese and we do- so it was a hit. I used Dijon mustard as did not have dry mustard on hand. Great app for a cocktail party. People raved about it.

This is definitely an aquired taste. Although i like blue cheese and love olive oil i found that the capers perfected the dish. Overall nice appetizer but still quite strong.

This was a hit at my party and worked great for my friends on low carb diets.  I used baked mushroom caps and small sweet peppers as scoops for this appetizer along with whole grain crackers. I will keep this as a go to appetizer as it is so simple to make and so well liked.

This was so much fun to eat!  Every ingredient is one that both my husband and myself love.  The only change I made was to forget the lemon juice.  Next time!

Very good and very strong. I forgot to add garlic but had garlic infused olive oil so used it along with the red wine vinegar. Ate it with Mediterranean Olive Triscuits. I think adding the fresh garlic will ramp up the intensity so will make sure to add it next time. Also adding some fresh chopped parsley would round this out a bit.

Mmmm, good!  Definitely an adult appetizer, the flavors are strong, but oh so good.  I've made it twice now and ate it immediately.  Next time I'll let the flavors meld first (if I can wait that long, that is!)  :)  Thanks for sharing. 

Update: took it to a party and it was a hit. I was a little nervous since it has such strong flavors, but it went over well.  This time I let it sit for about four hours. So good!

I couldn't see why I couldn't just put it all together in the mixing bowl vs drizzling the ingredients over the blue cheese, so that's what I did. Everyone loved it and I think this was the easier method.

I tried this recipe as is. The only difference is that I put it on a salad instead of eating it with crackers like the picture shows. It was pretty good to me. The kids even liked it!  I would definitely make it again.
