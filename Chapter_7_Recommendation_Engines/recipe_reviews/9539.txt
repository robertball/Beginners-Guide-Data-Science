This is a great fudge.  Similiar to the one sold at Disney World.  I did make some changes.  I added 12 oz of pineapple with the juice squeezed out and I used heavy whipping cream for rich flavor.  The directions aren't specific enough for the inexperienced candy maker though.  This fudge should be cooled til lukewarm without stirring. The trick it to not being crumbly is to beat it until it thickens somewhat and the color becomes duller and lighter than it was before you started beating it.

Perhaps one CUP, as the recipe calls for, instead of the can used, wouldn't yield a pan of sludge. You can't specify how long something cools for- ti's different depending on the temperature, humidity, etc. Cool is just... cool. LOL

Please try the recipe again!

A VERY sweet fudge.  Smells good while cooking.  Seems to take forever to get to the softball stage though.  And after it set, it was almost  to the stage of crumbly.

I have made this one many times now and do not understand the problems others seem to have had.  Perhaps people are adding a can instead of a cup of pineapple??  Sweet-just like fudge is supposed to be!  I will continue to make this as our Thanksgiving/Christmas fudge.
Love it.

I made this recipe using the tips from the review where the one person used heavy cream. It still came out very crumbly before I added the lemon juice. Here's how I fixed it: I added an extra teaspoon of lemon juice and I drizzled in some extra heavy cream. Just enough to make it smooth when mixed. Mine turned out very well...very smooth. Of course there is that bit of texture, but you expect that because there is pineapple in it and no matter how much you cook it pineapple will be grainy. It is very sweet though, so I'd suggest cutting it in smaller peices than you normally would for fudge. I hope this helps someone. Have fun!

I am not impressed. This turned into a pan of pineapple-ish sludge. Perhaps if the receipe was more specific (ie. what size can of pineapple, and how long to let it cool).

I decided to make this even though the ratings were not that good. Like others I followed the recipe to the letter. It did set up and had a good taste but was very grainy. Like crystalized sugar. I will not make again.

This was not edible.  I had to throw the whole pan away.  I won't try it again.  Entirely too sweet.

Mediocre at best... We are pineapple fanatics but this just didn't do it for us!  We used whole whipping cream instead...  and it took a long time to set.

It has a good taste, but it's a little gooey for me.  I prefer a more firm fudge.  I was a little concerned about using a whole cup of evap milk when I normally make fudge with one of the small 5oz cans.  I might try it again & use that, but this time I wasn't that impressed.

This stuff did not set up at all.  It tasted really good, but it was more of a taffy-like substance than fudge.

I just couldn't get this to set.  I was so excited to make it and it was a disappointment.  I followed tips from others and it still didn't turn out.

The taste was great, however, I didn't pay attention to the pineapple amount closely.  And I ended up with a great dip for my sticky rice instead of fudge.  I put a low rating because for me a great recipe doesn't have to be so perfectly followed.  Will try later to make it right.

Great tasting fudge. Will definitely make it again!!!! Wanted to use up 1/2 cup crushed pineapple in fridge. Used less pineapple and with candy thermometer to ensure correct temperature this fudge turned out perfect!

I love pineapple, which is why I decided to try this recipe. Way too sugary for my tastes, worth the try though.
