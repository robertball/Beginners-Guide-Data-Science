I loved the flavor and that it's a simple no bake recipe. Versatile recipe where you can really add or substitute ingredients as you'd like. Definitely a recipe I'll use again and make double batches of. I admit I didn't use the protein powder...

I love this recipe.  I double it and add a tablespoon of water at a time until it is a good consistency. I also substitute sun butter for the peanut butter. I cut them into bars and put into snack size zipper plastic bags. yum!

These are candy bars.  As I was making them I became concerned about the protein to goodie ratio, so i decided to double the protein powder and add 1/4 c water to soften it. Then after pressing in a square pan I let them set in the freezer 5 hours, which gave them a nice shape when cut. Soft, chewy, delicious candy bars. Yielded 6 bars, 15g protein each, probably a ton of calories, but very yummy. I'll definitely make them again, but I'll cut back on the honey and chocolate chips.

This was a great recipe! I added some sunflower seeds, chia seeds, pine nuts, and a bit more of both the peanut butter and oats. It turned out great! I would definitely recommend this to someone.

Followed recipe the first time except (?) used dark chocolate chips rather than white.  Loved it.  Be sure to press it firm in the pan.  The second time I made it, I forgot to separate and melt the chocolate and peanut butter.  So I put the whole mixture, oatmeal and all, in the microwave for one minute, then stirred it all together and put in the pan.  Not sure there was any difference except I only dirtied one dish!

I followed this recipe, but also added a 2oz package of Fischer's slivered  almonds. I don't know what this will do to the nutritional value, but I like almonds & wanted the extra protein. I also added a tsp more honey to compensate for the extra dry ingredient. The finished product tasted great, but maybe not as firm as they should be, maybe next time I'll add more honey. If anyone has a better suggestion, I'd love to hear it.

Very easy and very good. I am a T1D so I really like to make my own power bars or energy bars. I added craisins and slivered almonds, should have added a little more honey. Overall will make again. Great recipe!

Easy to make, great snack! It was a little too sweet for me, and maybe to much sugar for a low-sugar diet, but nonetheless, quite tasty!

I make a tray of these at least once per week. I did opt out of the chocolate chips and used chocolate protein powder since this is all I have had on hand it they still taste delicious. I mix up the dried fruits as well. Sometimes I use dates, cherries, cranberries or anything else that sounds good in the moment. They're a great grab and go snack for myself and husband and Go great in the kids' lunches.

Like these a lot.  I'm allergic to nuts so used soy butter in place of peanut butter.  A nice quick breakfast  on the way to work.

These are so tasty.  The whole family loves them. I use natural chunky peanut butter and omit the chocolate chips. I have rolled them in balls (messy but easy to eat) or spread them in an 8 x 8 pan.  The last time I made them, I added 2 tbsp of mixed seeds to give them more crunch.  They are awesome to take hiking/fishing or to have as an after-school snack.
