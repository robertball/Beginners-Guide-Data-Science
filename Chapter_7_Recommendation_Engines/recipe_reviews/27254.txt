This is a freak'n terrific recipe!  I used 4 lbs of basic pork spareribs that were on sale for $1.79 a lb, trimmed them up and they were fabulous!  I knew 2 lbs of baby back ribs would never feed my family of four...and at $6.99 a lb, I was reluctant to try a new recipe on such expensive cut.  This marinade would work an any cut of pork!  I will try it next on country style ribs as those are my favorite since they are so meaty.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce as others suggested.  One suggestion, though...don't use the whole bottle, it can overwhelm the delicate taste of the delicious marinade.  The sauce should complement, but not dominate.  We enjoyed them very much!  Thanks, Mike!

This recipe is the best. See i am 13 and i a love to cook so i am always lookin 4 a good recipe. I saw this one and decided to make it. Theese where the best ribs that i have every tried in my life. I am used to the cuban way but i could say this is 10000000000000000000000000000000x better than that way. If to are lookin 4 the best ribs around search no further i would highly reccomend theese ribs no matter what. it was so rich and tender and the meet literally fell off of the bone. When i saw the ingridients in the recipe i was like huh, that is weird but when i tasted it wasn't weird at all i felt as if i where in heaven when i ate those ribs. This is honestly the best rib recipe ever and cannot denie it ever.

This is an AWESOME recipe! At first, I thought the red wine vinegar was maybe too strong and was going to overpower the pineapple flavor. I let them marinate over night. Used Sweet Baby Rays (the best bbq sauce ever) and OMG....it was so good. I will NEVER use any other recipe for ribs. The whole family loved 'em. My hard-to-please hubby was especially impressed. Thanks Mike! It's a winner!

Wonderful! Easy to prepare and and even easier to eat! If your store has it, I recommend you use Sweet Baby Ray's Honey Barbecue Sauce...Compliments the pineapple wonderfully.

These ribs were fantastic.  I marinated the ribs in a gallon-size freezer bag.  Instead of baking them I cooked them in my crockpot for several hours before grilling.  I also doubled the amount of ribs and there was plenty of marinade for the extra ribs.  The ribs were tender and had a great flavor.

These should be called Freak'n amazing ribs! We made them last weekend for 13 people (hit of the party) and are making them again this weekend. Note: Recipe calls for 2 lbs per 6 people, which is not enough. I would recommend more like 3/4 lb per person.

Well this recipe lives up to its name! I had to double it to make 4 pounds of ribs, let it marinade all day, but, I cooked them in my electric presure cooker for 40 minutes then placed them on the grill, my only regret is that 4 pounds of ribs wasn't enough! My family voted mine the best ribs in the city!!! Thanks Mike for this awsome recipe!

The best ribs I have ever had. The marinade is awesome (doubled for 4 lbs. of baby back ribs) and let sit for 9-10 hours.  I did pour some of the sauce out (about half) before I put in the oven (covered) for 2 hours.  I took the sauce that I poured out and reduced by more than half until it was a thicker syrup and then added 1/2 of Sweet Baby Rays Honey BBQ sauce -- slathered that over the ribs when they were done cooking and put under the broiled (low setting) for 15-20 minutes.  Fantastic.  Will make again and again!  Won't use another recipe.

These are the BEST ribs my husband has EVER tasted. I'm a vegetarian but don't mind fixing him something he really loves once in a while and when I served these to him, 51 years old and a "connoisseur" of barbecued pork ribs and he said these were the BEST ribs he's ever had. He ate the entire slab and wanted more. I HIGHLY recommend this recipe. And it smells so good when it's baking in the oven...

As almost everyone else noted, these are fabulous. Of course, everyone has their own twist and I'm no exception. Here are my recommendations. Marinade overnight but not much longer. Lower the oven temp to 250 and cook for 2.5-3 hours. Otherwise, they won't be as tender as they could be. Oh yeah, make sure you don't pour all the marinade in the pan. The key is to cover the bottom of the pan to help bake with a moist heat, but it's very important not to cover the ribs. Please use baby backs. They only need 5-10 minutes on the grill. Handle them carefully, otherwise they'll fall apart on the grill! Enjoy.

What makes this recipe good is the barbecue sauce specifically the suggested one by reviewers, Sweet Baby Ray's. I was not impressed by the ribs after taking them out of the oven before the BBQ sauce, they were very bland. In all fairness I did use a different type of vinegar (balsamic) and a pineapple/orange juice, didn't have the recommended, but that shouldn't have made a difference. I cooked tham much longer cause 275 degrees for  11/2hrs is not enough they were still almost raw. The Ray's saved the day.

Mike, you were freak'n right. These were great. The aroma while cooking was driving my family  crazy, they couldn't wait to eat. I marinated mine overnight and the meat came right off the bones. The spices were an excelent blend and had a wonderful flavor. This is now my favorite rib marinate. Thanks!

I had tweaked my own rib recipe for several years, and thought I had it down pat.  Then I tried these ribs, and - WOW!  They beat my ribs all the way 'round.  Didn't change the ingredients, except used boneless country pork ribs. I simmered them in the marinade for two hours, then took the ribs out and boiled the marinade until it was reduced to less than one half.  Mixed the marinade with the barbeque sauce (Jack Daniel's) because I didn't want to lose any of that flavor.  These are, by far the very best ribs I've ever made.  Thank you!

Great recipe!  Easy and foolproof, worked wonderfully with boneless ribs.  And wow, they should really make Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce part of this recipe!!  Since about five other people specifically recommended it in their reviews, I tried it instead of my usual KC Masterpiece, and this is my new favorite sauce!  It's thick, a little smokey, and a little sweet, and it makes these ribs perfect.  The Cincinnati-based Montgomery Inn BBQ is thinner and little more tomatoey, so pick your style of sauce, just as long as you put it over this rib recipe :)

Delicious!  Very easy to make and the combination of ingredients makes for a mouthwatering dinner.  I used this with boneless, country style ribs and it was a huge hit.  Tender, juicy and flavorful.  Great for a crowd.

I tried the recipe this weekend and was disappointed.  Time consuming and a lot of prep work for the reward of okay tasting baby back ribs. My family loves barbecued ribs, just not prepared this way. I will try another recipe next time.

Thanks, Mike! These are absolutely the best ribs I have ever made. I followed the leader and used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ Sauce for a perfect match.

I was a little dissappointed in these ribs because of all the good ratings it received.  The meat fell off the bone, but to me the flavoring was just average.

great recipe.  I followed it exactly and it was awesome.  I made my own BBQ sauce and it was a perfect compliment to the ribs marinade.

These were really good, but they took way too long to prepare and cook.  I made this with 5 racks of ribs for company, and it was very inconvenient to marinate and cook them before grilling.  Definately very tender and tasty, but if you slow cook them on the grill for an hour (vs. the oven), I bet they would come out just as good.

The ribs turned out great.  They got great reviews from my dinner guests.  I marinated the meat for longer than 8 hours (probably like 24 hrs!) and they turned out fine.  It's really important to choose a good BBQ sauce.  I used a local favorite of Dino BBQ sauce, but next time i will try something more spicy.  Great Recipe!

The bottom line is that these ribs are good in their marinade, BUT unless you use a really good barbecue sauce, none of it really matters!  It's kind of hard to rate it given that it just says to use a bottle of barbecue sauce.  We love "A Very Popular BBQ Sauce" from this site, but can imagine how some other bottled sauces would not taste great with these ribs!

This stuff was the absolute BOMB!!! Wow! I used apple juice instead of pineapple (hey it has the name apple in it). But this was great! The family sure liked it. I slow-grilled them for about 20 minutes. If you haven't tried this you are missing out for sure! Don't do like some people on here did, and put them in a crock-pot.... Follow the recipe somewhat and they will turn out delicious!

I have made the recipe several times. The best results I have had is when I put the ribs and marinade in a slower cooker for 4 hours instead of baking. They almost fell apart while I was grilling them. Thanks for the great recipe.

From the first bite to the last, these were AWESOME and MOIST, TENDER!!  I let mine marinade for a week and it was great!!  My husband said that they were the best he's had to include a real favorite place of ours.  I doubled the marinade and the rest is in the freezer for use at another time. I used boneless CountryStyle Pork Ribs.  Man OH Man these are to die for ribs..FREAK'N GREAT RIBS!!! A TEN IN OUR BOOK!!!!!!  Thanks for the recipe:)

Fantastic ribs!  I cooked them in the marinade a little longer than the recipe called for and finished them on the grill.  Excellent flavor.  I added some Thai Sweet Chili Sauce to my store-bought BBQ sauce - divine.  Great recipe, Mike.

My family loved the flavor and the meat turned out very tender.  I'm on a diet and was supposed to be eating a Lean Cuisine but took one bite of these and promptly fell off the wagon.  Would suggest watching the grill heat, we have a big grill and the medium was too high, next time I'll grill over low.

I put the ribs in my roaster oven.  I did not throw them on the grill at any time.  They turned out just fine.  Would have been perfect cooked completely on the grill.  Will make this again.

I tried these ribs easter sunday, and this was the very first time I BBq'd ribs. They came out great the meat could have used a little bit of seasoning or more marinade. If you have a large family 1 slab will not be enough.

We decided on the oven rather than barbque cause of the weather and maybe that was our mistake, but we didn't think the extra effort on the sauce paid off.

I am always looking for new marinades for venison because my brother keeps me in tenderloins during the winter.  I kept everything the same except I didn't brush with barbeque sauce, and it was AWESOME!  Thanks!

Used this recipe for my first stab at BBQ ribs for a Father's Day cookout.  They were PHEMOMENAL!!  I used big, thick pork spareribs instead of baby backs, and Sweet Baby Ray's Honey Barbecue sauce.  Of course I had to increase marinating time and baking time to account for the thickness of the ribs, but other than that, followed this recipe to the letter.  Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic!!

I chose this recipe just for the title!  And the title is true.  These are freak'n good!  Easy.  Love the two step cooking.  Made the grilling part just the added touch instead of the whole cooking process.  Yum.

Mike, You are a genius.  I have been searching my whole life for ribs like these.  Over the past month I have made them 4 times.  My husband, mother, and daughter agree "They are Freakin Good".  Thanks so much.  My daughter is 27 so it has been a long search that has finally come to an end thanks to your freakin good ribs.

worth taking the time to make!  Marinade was plenty for 3-4 lbs of ribs! Cooking so slowly in the oven really seals in the flavor!  I also used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ as suggested.  Will try again!!  A 4th of July party pleaser!

As my wife said when she tasted it,"Oh my God, these are great." I am always on a search for Rib Recipes and by far, Mike, these were awesome. Touch of a bite, with great flavor. I used "Sweet Baby Ray's" barbeque sauce (my favorite)when grilling them. I will be making these again for friends.

I was pretty apprehensive about trying these.  But, so glad I did! Only change:  Used a small globber of (French's) Spicy Brown Mustard in place of powder. I followed itzjust_me's suggestions for the most part:  Boiled for an hour.  (Didn't marinate more than a couple hours, though).  Crock on LOW for 4 hours, drained - covered in Famous Dave's RICH & SASSY and baked at 300 for about 45 - 60 minutes in the oven.  (This marinade really doesn't smell that good.. But it is actually very tasty - sweet 'n' tangy!)

Only cut my slabs in half and marinated nearly 24 hours.  Cooked them low and slow for about 3 hours.  Used *Sweet and Tangy sauce* instead of bottled and they were AMAZING!

I was at a BBQ and had some great ribs. I asked if they would share their recipe and they gave me this one.  I just made it (followed recipe exactly). It is truly delicious - the couple that introduced me to this said this is the only one they use when they entertain - they said that someone always asks for the recipe - I am living proof!  Thanks submitter.

This didn't work well at all. The marinade overpowered the sweet succulent flavor I expect from ribs-they tasted nothing at all like pork. I made no changes except to cut in half for the two of us. I wasted expensive baby back ribs on this and the reason for the one star is because my hubby ate them. Still seeking perfect ribs...

Just made these ribs for Labor Day BBQ and they were excellent deleted pepper and cloves for personal taste's of guest also used half pineapple juice and half apple juice and one more thing didn't use all the brown sugar as suggested but was told this was the best ever rib recipe. I also used the Sweet Baby Ray's honey BBQ sauce that is my all time favorite sauce.
THANK YOU FOR THE GREAT RECIPE!

Because of all the rave reviews, I was excited to make this recipe for the holiday weekend.  However, I must say, despite all those reviews, I thought it was just a so-so taste.  I did follow the recipe exactly.  We make a lot of ribs and our house and try a lot of different recipes but this one didn't quite do it for us.  Maybe I'll try again with a little modification.  Thanks.

I followed the recipe almost exactly.  The only difference was I used pork spare ribs instead of baby back ribs and doubled the recipe.  I marinated them over night.  I found that for the amount and volume of ingredients, it was not quite worth the results.  If I were to do it again, I would half the recipe for the same amount of meat and marinade in a zip lock bag rather than in the baking dish.  That would not leave as much liquid while baking, but I think occasional basting should make up for that.

I had no experience making ribs and these turned out okay. My mother has a very low spice tolerance so I omitted the garlic, but she still couldn’t eat them. One downside, when a recipe calls for store-bought barbecue sauce, there’s probably 70 varieties at my store, so I feel like it becomes impossible to fairly rate a recipe, since that can so dramatically alter the outcome. Anyway, not bad.

Delicious! I have made this recipe four times now. The last two, just because we were so busy, I ended up marinating them for almost 24 hours.  Then cooked them backwards from most of the people reviewing here. I grilled first, then put them in the crock pot on low with our favorite BBQ sauce. I let them simmer all afternoon while I got the salads and everything ready ( about 4-5 hours). Perfect! Tender and juicy.  The marinade takes a lot of ingredients, but is worth the time.

I have been in search for a great recipe for ribs for a long time now. No more searching for me because I've found it! I do everything exactly as the recipe calls for, except I mix in a separate bowl seasonings above along with salt and pepper and rub onto the ribs. I then pour Italian dressing all over the ribs and allow the ribs to marinate in the dressing about 2hrs before pouring the juice marinade. I don't add the suggested garlic because there is enough garlic in the dressing. I then allow the ribs to marinate for the recommended time. I haven't used the grill yet so once I bake for above time I remove the ribs from the marinade, placing into another baking pan, adjust oven temp to 350 degrees and bake til done (probably about an hour) and it is throughout this last part of baking that I baste the BBQ sauce. They are still delicious!

These were absolutely the best ribs I've ever had and I live in the south! Instead of using barbeque sauce when grilling the ribs, I just brushed on some more of the marinade.  These ribs will definitely be on the menu for company.

Was expecting so much more after reading other reviews.  Wasn't crazy about this at all.  I used country style spare ribs and cooked in a slow cooker on low for 9 hours.  Then grilled with barbeque sauce.  They were actually dry.  Might have been because I used a crock pot though.   Won't make again.

I've got to try this again!  I had WAY too many ribs (6 lbs) and didn't make enough marinade!  Also, I marinaded the ribs for 2 nights (way too long when you're marinating with citrus).  The flavor was OUTSTANDING, however, mine were not tender at all -- that's why I have to try again -- I KNOW they'll be fabulous!  My 11 yr old daughter absolutely loved them -- and she's the pickiest eater ever.

These ribs are fantastic! They're juicy, sweet, tangy...perfect. I used Bullseye as the BBQ sauce. Thanks for sharing. We'll definitely make this again!

Man, these are good!  I've tried numerous rib recipes, but this is the best.  The marinade made the ribs flavorful and tender.  I used Famous Dave's Rich and Spicy BBQ Sauce.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I was a little disappointed in this recipe.  I thought the marinade flavor would be more pronounced.  I think next time, I will skip the grill and just keep baking the ribs in the oven.  I also think the BBQ sauce covered up the marinade flavor.  I will be making this again though, because I definitely think it has the potential to be fantastic!

Did these for the 4th of July, exactly as stated except added more cayenne plus crushed red pepper to the marinade, but that is something I pretty much do with every recipe.  My husband & I like spicy.

I used this on the 4th of July with chicken thighs.  Awesome! I forgot to add the cayenne pepper, but it was still yummy. I didn't bake the chicken in the marinade - just straight to the grill.  I think I'll bake it for a bit next time.  The chicken was juicy and flavorful. It's a keeper!

Fantastic!  Our fourteen year old made these ribs, they're so easy.  My husband won't get ribs at a restaurant ever again.  I did cook the ribs for a little over 2 hours as suggested, other than that followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks Mike!

So easy- can even substitute with a store bought marinade for an even easier recipe.  I also cooked it for only about a minute on each side on the grill.  Just falls off the bone!

I can't say enough good things about this recipe...my brother thought he made the best ribs, and I KNEW I did.  We had a family rib-off, and I kicked his butt with this recipe.  You have to use the Sweet Baby Ray Honey Garlic sauce, it's the BEST!

Really Delicious! I marinated for about 22 hrs and they were so tender the bones fell off on the grill. I made the marinade exactly except used 5 lbs of spareribs and the marinade was plenty. They weren't tender even after 2 hrs of baking so I turned the temp to 350 for another 1 hr. I used Sweet Ray's honey BBQ which made me a little nervous as I sampled it and didn't like it, so I mixed it with a little of the marinade and it was good. Even the kids liked it. When the hubby takes a bite and says mmmm good it's gotta be a keeper! Thanks Mike!

Awesome!  My first attempt at ribs on Mother's Day 2005- big bbq at our house.  these were the star of the grill!  I bought the ribs at the Sam's Club- they had more meat on them than any ribs I've gotten at any restaurant or smokehouse.  Using this recipe, they were incredible.  I marinated them overnight and baked in the morning, then grilled.  Awesome flavor, very moist and tender.  Got rave reviews---everyone wanted to know my 'secret'!    Thanks Mike!!!

I'm not an experienced rib chef, but I tried this out with great success!  It's easy and foolproof!  Had trouble at first with adding cloves, but bucked up and did it!  They add a unique flavor that rocks! Thanks!

These ribs were wonderful.  I made the marinade and put it directly into my slow cooker, put the ribs in and let it go on low all day.  Just before we were ready for dinner I threw them on the grill with the bbq sauce as instructed.  Super easy!

These ribs were fantastic!!  My husband and I love good ribs, and this is a keeper.  The only thing I did different was that I didn't add the cloves (didn't have them on hand).  Also, this recipe makes TONS of sauce... I definitely could have cooked more than 2 lbs of ribs. Anyway, FANTASTIC!!

I tried this with country style pork ribs and it turned out awesome!! My only suggestion for really tender ribs is to grill (or smoke) them 1st w/BBQ sauce and then bake them in the oven in the original marinade at 250 degrees for 3 or 4 hours. The meat will be so tender it will literally fall off the bone! (Marinate the ribs and then reverse the rest of this recipe and double the oven cooking time.)

Very good flavor, used country-style ribs because they were on sale. No quite as tender as I thought they'd be (maybe because I had to finish them on my little indoor-Foreman?), but will definitely be making again, very pleased with my first try at ribs.

My only regret with this recipe is that I didn't make MORE!  I did double the marinade as I had 4 lbs. of ribs on hand, but wish I had an extra slab or two.  Thank you Mike B. for submitting this wonderful recipe, and thanks also to the past reviewers that recommended using Sweet Baby Rays Honey BBQ sauce.  It WAS excellent and it certainly did compliment the tangy marinade.

Deeelish.  I marinated pork butt style ribs using all ingredients except for ketchup, only because I just ran out. Along with the pineapple juice I added some crushed pineapple and marinated overnight.  I put the ribs straight on the grill not in the stove like suggested.  Came out wonderful.
