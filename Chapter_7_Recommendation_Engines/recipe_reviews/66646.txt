I have made these potato "chips" several times before, and they are really good. However, it usually takes quite a bit longer in many microwaves for them to get crisp!

I had no idea that a microwave could produce potato chips like this!  My wife was blown away by the results^_^  The chips turned out crispy and thin and even curled like many name-brand chips.  The only downside to this recipe is that you can't make many chips at one time. ...and after you taste them, you just can't seem to make them fast enough to meet demands.  
My change(s) to the recipe were to do away with the bag. (oil is messy and I can never seem to use one to evenly distribute seasonings)  For my chips I used extra virgin olive oil and poured it in the middle of the plate, then used the oil in the plate to dip both sides of the potato slices in as I spread them evenly on the plate.  Overlapping chips is not recommened, as they tend to be slightly "chewy" in the end compared to keeping them seperated.    My chips did not have any problems sticking at all except when I overcooked them.  For toppings I used seasalt, onion powder and cayenne. (I like things spicy hot) My wifes fav. was when I mixed freshly squeezed lime juice with the olive oil in the plate before dunking the potatoes, and then seasoned with seasalt and just a little kool-aid lemonade powder mix. (the kind without sugar added) The powder mix has citric acid in it which really gave the salty lime chips a nice Zzzzing!  Thank you for this wonderful Recipe idea!

I've been making my own potato "chips" for years.  I don't even use the oil any longer.  I spray with 'PAM'.  It works great and saves those extra calories and fat.  These are great sprinkled with Cajun seasoning instead of the salt.

Believe it or not, I made these for a special occasion.  I used a round plate in the microwave and placed parchment paper on top.  I didn't have a mandoline, so I used a potato peeler instead.  I thought it would take a long time with the peeler but I used 2 smaller red potatoes and it only took about 10 minutes of prep time.  After I oiled them up in the bag, I arranged the slices on top of the parchment paper in the circular pattern of the plate, with the tiniest bit of overlapping at the edges.  Once I did the first batch I realized that they stuck together where they overlapped and the chips took the shape of a doily!  Then I started expirementing with the next batch, with little criss-crosses and overlaps to create different looks.  The end result was about 6 (I think I ate one or two additional ones in the process) beautiful circular "potato crisp doilies"  which I served underneath a steak.  It was an absolute hit!

I wasn't looking for this recipe.  I only happened upon it by accident and thought it looked easy and worth trying.  Boy, was it!  I whipped some of these up for lunch (using the box grater slicer).  Super easy and delicious!  I too found they took more time (about 7-9 mins) even though my potatoes were really thin.  I used parchment paper directly on the turntable after I scorched my fingers trying to move the plate after the first round.  The parchment paper totally eliminated any sticking.  I just used olive oil and salt, but will try other seasonings and sweet potatoes in the future.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I decided to try this with some feeling of 'this isn't going to work!' attitude.  I fixed up my first batch, and put it in the microwave.  I had to keep adding minutes until they finally browned..it was a total of 10 min.  I put them in the bowl, salted them a bit, and WOW!! they were so wonderful!!! I had my family try one, and they ate all of them before dinner!! I ended up making a few batches!  I had to go back online to make more copies of the recipes for others!  simply wonderful, and so much better for you!!!  we are hooked!

These were very yummy once I got a successful batch, and I can see where they would be addictive. WAY better than packaged chips. It did however, take two failed batches before I had success. I sliced them paper thin the first time and followed the other directions, but at the last 'go round' in the microwave they burnt. You have to watch them VERY closely as even a few seconds too long will kill them. They were also stuck to the plate, but I figured that was because they were burnt. The second batch came out just in time, but again, were so badly stuck to the plate that they couldn't be salvaged. I would have given up but I like a challenge. The third time I sliced them a bit thicker and placed them on a sheet of parchment, forgoing the oil altogether. I also sprinkled the salt on before they went into the mike. Came out PERFECTLY that time!

These were remarkably good, never would have thought to try and make chips in the microwave.  To solve the sticking problem, I just put a sheet of parchment paper on the turntable of my microwave and put the potatoes right on top. No need to coat a plate with oil and no sticking!

Teenage son and buddies loved these! I sprayed the potatoes with butter flavored Pam and cooked them on a plastic microwave bacon-cooker-thing with the ridges....nice and crispy after about 5 min.

This is a great homemade chip recipe! I just sprayed my microwave plate with oil (you will need to be a little generous) and placed the potato slices on it and then sprayed them. I would start them cooking for 3 min. then add each additional min. keeping an eye on them until they brown(don't forget a little salt when they're done!). The nice thing is, when you have a craving for chips, you simply slice up 1 potato, and when it's gone, it's gone!

This recipe is incredible. I was kind of sceptical after reading it but thought I should give it a try. Well, I couldn't make the chips fast enough for my family. As soon as one batch was done my kids and husband had eaten them. If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would. 
Oh and no problems with the potatoes sticking either. A coating of PAM on the plate took care of that.

Guess what!  I don't ever have to buy Potato Chips again!!!  Fantastic!!!  I used Parchment Paper on the turntable, sliced (till I find my mandalin) one potato with a peeler, finished awkward piece left with paring knife.. Drizzled with Extra Virgin Olive Oil, and Sea Salt, mixed it with my fingers, layed them flat, mircowaved them for 6 minutes.. EeeeYUM!  Next time (tomorrow), I'm going to try Onion & Garlic Flavor.  I rolled the used parchment paper, put it in a plastic bag in the freezer to use for tomorrows' batch.   Because I've been a Potato Chip Junkie since I was a kid, I even held a few to the light and it looked e x a c t l y  like right out of the store bought bag!  I just wonder what they'll taste like not warm :) For the few reviews I had time to read today, in regards to someone saying their Microwave had odor, I humbly suggest either leaving the door open till the moisture escapes, or put a micro-save container 1/2 full of water, add a drop or two of either vinegar or lemon juice [from the bottle], and nuke it for about 3 minutes, that will freshen any smells, and when the water is warm you can use it to wipe out your micro. Thanks SOOO much for this recipie!

By far one of my favorite recipes from this site.  Store bought chips pale in comparison.  Here are some tips:
1.  Use PAM to spray the plate you will cook on.  Compared to just oiling the plate, PAM guaranteed a no-stick situation.  If you want to oil the plate instead, stop the cooking midway through to pry the chips a bit from the plate with a fork and then let them cook through.
2.  Dipping the chips in a small saucer with oil worked better than the bag method.
3.  The power of your microwave determines the cooking time.  I have a 1200w oven - it takes about 5 1/2 minutes, with each successive batch taking a bit less time.  Check often!  They go from pale to burnt quick quickly.
4.  Don't be afraid to let them get a bit brown and wait for them to cool to get really crispy.

Have fun with the toppings.  A little brown sugar, smoked paprika, onion powder, mustard powder, garlic salt and pepper mix tossed with the chips fresh out of the microwave gives you a nice BBQ chip flavor.

Hubs and I scarfed these down in a New York Minute they were that fresh, light, crispy and good! But at the risk of sounding like real dorks, this was fun and cheap Friday night entertainment too!  We had such fun making these, and felt like kids doing those food experiments we all used to do!   Hubs did slice these "paper thin" with the mandolin as the recipe directed and in our microwave they took just over 1-1/2 minutes. It took several batches just to "fry" one potato, and we were eating them up as each batch came out of the microwave.  Next time we want to try them a little thicker, and are hoping we get the same, delicious results.

Looking for help making a healthy potato chip for my wife, I found this recipe using the microwave to make them. Unbelievable! Potato chips are fried in oil right? But why not try it. So I peeled an Idaho baking potato and used my mandoline slicer set at about 2/3 the thickness of a dime to give it a try. The thinner the quicker IMHO. Put all the slices in a bowl of water to keep them from browning. Took out the glass turn table, and cut a piece of baking parchment to fit it, and sprayed it with Pam. Take just enough of your potato slices to cover the parchment and pat them dry. Spray each side with Pam and lay them on the parchment without over lapping as best you can. We cook them at our microwave’s highest setting from 4 - 6 minutes. Take a look after 4 minutes. If your making multiple batches your going to get a lot of steam inside your microwave causing water droplets all over so your going to have some extra clean up. The thickness of your chips and the power of your microwave will affect the time. Top with Popcorn salt. We really love them and will probably never buy commercial potato chips again. Since I never would have thought of making them in the microwave I want to give a big thanks to you Jessica for putting your recipe on allrecipes.com

These are amazing!  I couldn't believe it when I ate the first chip.  I skipped using vegetable oil to keep them healthier, and just sprayed Pam on the plate to keep chips from sticking.

I have a weakness for potato chips and because of that, I have tried this recipes at least 10 times with different variations, slice tecniques, cooking times, and I have NEVER had it turn out well.  VERY VERY disappointing

35 minutes? Not even. If you have a mandoline, it's 1 minute to slice and 1 minute to mix and 5 minutes to cook. 7 minutes per batch. My kids love making and eating these. We use this recipe for carrots, beets, apples, and pears. Love it!

I initially found this recipe on another site, and had to try them right away. I used a mandoline to get super thin slices. The first batch, I used a paper plate to absorb the moisture in the potatoes, and seasoned with garlic salt. I didn't oil the plate. So the chips stuck to the plate and came off in pieces. Any overlapping chips stuck together. The second batch, I oiled the plate with olive oil. This was better, but many still stuck to the plate. The third batch, I oiled parchment paper, and arranged the potato slices so that they didn't overlap or touch each other. Voila!! Perfect chips that didn't stick to the paper, and didn't stick together. In a single layer and thin slices, the cooking took about 3 minutes to brown and crisp the potatoes. These were as good as any store bought chips, but much healthier and much cheaper. Using the parchment paper, I think larger batches could be made at one time, but the cooking time would likely be longer. Next I intend to try crinkle cut and oven baking for larger batches. This is a great starter recipe to experiment with and expand the options including flavoring.

These were awesome. Once I was able to get them paper thin like Jessica said, they crisped up in less then 3 minutes. I tried sweet potatoes too, but they went from not crisp yet to burnt in a matter of seconds. What I like best about them is I know exactly what ingredient and how much of each is going into them. There are no big words on a label that I cannot pronounce, there isn't a big giant bag of them in my pantry that I can just keep eating until it's feeling empty and I'm feeling guilty. In fact there is no big giant bag at all. (Yay for the land fills.) I did use a piece of parchment paper, however, like others suggested. I would not make these chips without it. I cut it in a circle that fits the plate that is already in my microwave perfectly and used it over many times. I used a mandolin to get the potatoes consistently thin and I really very, very lightly sprayed the chips with olive oil cooking spray. After about 2 minutes and 45 seconds they were perfect and tasted exactly like (or maybe even better than) chips from the bag. I simply picked up the parchment paper and the chips slid right off into my chip bowl.

I was looking for an easy chip recipe to serve for dinner with my chili cheese dip and came across this one. Like others who tried this recipe, I was VERY skeptical at first. However, after the first batch emerged from the microwave, I was hooked! I ate the entire first plate of chips before I could make another. When my daughter got home from school, I couldn't keep her hands out of them, and same for my husband when he got in from work. I actually ended up wearing my poor microwave out and made an entire ziplock back full of these! I spent half a day making chips just so we could have them to snack on but it was definitely well worth the time and effort it took. Oh, and by the way, DO NOT attempt to do them in the oven as you will not get the same effect as I discovered. I thought I would attempt a batch in there to see if it would work and I would be able to make more at a time....I was very wrong! I think I need to invest in another microwave just so I can double up on the amount I can make at one time!! Thank you SO much for this recipe...it is one of my (and my family's) favorites now!!   PS>>>I made my thicker and cooked them longer since I was using them for dip. When you slice them thicker they don't shrink nearly as much as when they are thin, as I tried both ways. I had to up cooking time from 11-15 minutes depending on the thickness of that batch (I sliced mine with a knife since I have very sharp knives and had no problem getting them the consistency I wanted.)

this is great!! they come out so crispy and yummy!! i added a sprinkkle of seasoned salt and they were awesome! in my microwave it took about 7-8 minutes to cook them though so dont be afraid to leave them in a little longer than the 2-3 minutes suggested on the recipe if they still look raw. i just let them cook until i started to see the potatoes turning brown and then took them out. they do make very little chips but its perfect for a single serving to accompany a sandwich!

These are so good!!!  I swear they taste just like Lays!  I did as another poster said and sprayed the plate, layed out the potatoed, then sprayed the potatoes--I then, sprinkled spike seasoning on them.  In my microwave they took about 3 and a half minutes to get crisp.  Also, i used mu vegetable peeler to make thin slices and it worked well.

it really worked!  i have to admit i was a skeptic about making potato chips in the microwave, but this really works!  i didn't bother shaking potato in bag with oil.  i just oiled the rotating microwave plate well, and put the potato slices right on it, then sprayed them with non-stick cooking spray and shook a little "crazy salt" on them.  i have a strong microwave, so in about 6 1/2 minutes i had delicious, crispy potato chips.  my husband loved them.  thanks, jessica.

This recipe is perfect. Simple and very pleasing results. It is VERY IMPORTANT to slice the potato paper thin or your cooking time will be much longer and the chips just will not crisp. The results are addictive.

As a guy who LOVES potato chips, I was amazed!  As a guy who is trying to eat smarter and healthier, I was AMAZED!  These are sooooooo good, and when you do as a few others suggest and simply spray PAM on the plate once, and then a quick spray of PAM on top before salting/seasoning and microwaving, this makes chips that are crispy, flavorful, AND healthy!  I will make a batch of these at a time every week or so, just to have on hand for those "crunchy" cravings!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

Surprisingly tasty! I used salt on the first batch and garlic salt on the second - the garlic salt is awesome. Mine took 4 min exactly - 2 on one side, 2 on the other. Anything longer burnt them.

As other reviewers have said, I skipped the bag of oil step.  After running my potato through the mandoline, I patted them dry on paper towels.  Simply spraying my dinner plate with spray, layering them and spraying again was enough oil.  Mine were done in 6 minutes.  And eaten even faster!  these are so fast- make them for a crowd and have them season them as they like.  I used garlic and dill seasoning from one of those in-home parties.  One red potato was enough to cure the munchies.

I've tried this recipe quite a while ago and I have to say I'm impressed with the outcome. Even though it takes some time and effort to make them, if you want your chips to be "healthy" chips, then investing your time on it wouldn't be a total waste. Regarding those whose chips turned out soggy,I think that is because they didn't microwave it long enough or the slices of potatoes were too soggy.I usually pat them dry with a kitchen towel before lightly coating them with oil and salt.And only take them out once they start to brown, if not continue microwaving.They might be soft at first but once u let them cool, they'll turn crispy.

These are fantastic chips!  My mandoline sliced a little thicker than most on the thin setting, but I loved the thick homestyle chips that it made.  Mine took longer in the microwave, which is very high powered.  It may have been because I used huge Idaho baking potatoes.  They still turned out great!  I realized toward the end of my batches that if I put less chips on my glass platter they took way shorter.  Next time I'll try that as I think it would balance out the timeframe.  You'll either have 12-13 minutes for big batches or 6-8 minutes for smaller batches.  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect.  I sprinkled garlic salt on mine and look forward to trying different spices in future batches.  Definitely a keeper!!

These are awesome.  I can't make enough to keep up with my kids.  I used a bowl of vegetable oil and just dipped them in there.  I put some wax paper on a plate and cooked them for 7 minutes.  They were so good.  Thanks for sharing.

I decided to give these a try after reading both the good and bad reviews.  They turned out great.  I think the people who had the bad reviews didn't properly oil the potatoes.  I used vegetable spray on the plate, put the potatoes on, then sprayed the potatoes (evenly).  I also salted them before cooking.  I found if I salted them after, the salt didn't stick very well.  It took about 7-8 minutes to finish a batch.  Also, instead of using one plate, I used two.  I put a small glass in the center of the bottom plate, and put a plate on top the glass as well: double the potatoes in the same amount of time.  However the potatoes on the top plate seemed to finish about a minute faster than the bottom ones, so make sure you watch for that.  Also, if the potatoes are sliced super thin, it is really easy to burn them, so make sure you can't see through the potato.  Cut it as thin as you can, while still allowing it to remain rigid, and not flimsy if you were to pick it up.  Mine turned out great, and I can't wait to share them with my co-workers and boyfriend.

I had a hankering for potato chips and thought I'd end up making something in the oven. When I saw this recipe, I couldn't believe potato chips could be so easy! I might never buy chips again! One medium sized russet was about two servings' worth of potatoes and took three batches to cook. I don't have a mandolin, so I had to hand-slice my potatoes. Uneven as they were, they still cooked perfectly!  I lined my dinner plate with parchment paper for easy removal and it took about 6-1/2 minutes. Without parchment, it only took 4-1/2 minutes but my chips stuck to the plate.

Despite all the good reviews,I have to side with those who were not impressed. I was intrigued by the idea and encouraged by all the positive comments. A rainy Sunday, I wasted much time experimenting with thickness, cooking times, oil distribution, eventually managed to cook the odd good chip. Bottom line.....it's potato chips,spend $2-$3 on a bag,they will be good....this recipe is not worth the time,effort or microwave energy.

GREAT recipe! I have found that the best way to keep the chips from sticking is to spray 2 pieces of parchment paper with cooking and lay out the potato slices between them. The chips will never stick!

Holy Smokes! Like so many of the other reviewers on here, I was a bit skeptical but WOW-EEE these are good! My kids LOVE them! They like them best with Tony Chachere's Cajun seasoning lightly sprinkled on top.
I had trouble with the first two batches sticking to the plate. I ended up coat the plate with olive oil and then sprinkling the tops with salt (or cajun seasoning), with no additional oil on top.
Yummy! But they are quite time consuming!
If you're hesitant about trying it...just try it once with one potato (I HIGHLY recommend slicing the potatoes with a mandolin- nice and thin and uniform in size). 
Have fun! Thanks for the great recipe!

I've got a good knife and pretty awesome knife skills, so even w/o a mandolin I cut these pretty thin. Paper thin. I followed direction and 17 minutes later I had a few burnt taters, a few mushy taters, a really hot plate and a tired microwave. I'm very glad I decided to test this out on ONE potato a few hours before supper. Total fail.

Oh oh oh oh GOD! They tasted so good! espiasilly that it took me only about twEENTY minutes! they rocked! but one more thing! if ur plastic bag is just a little itsy bitsy small, just use a round deep pot and add the olive oil and then tHE POTATOES! they still rocked even the second and hundredth! It's is much easier and much low fat than the chips that WE buy from stores!And also better in the new tefal one spooned olive oil! in some kinda way! ENJOY UR AMAZING POTATOES!!

I forgot to toss the (not paper thin) slices in oil for the first batch, and they were still exceptionally delicious.  What a great way to serve saratoga-type chips without the extra mess and calories of actually frying!  Tossing in oil is better, but really not necessary!  Great - simple - delicious!

This is excellent. To my surprise. The chips were the best when I cut them a little thicker than paper thin. Otherwise they got stuck pretty bad.

The chips were really good, but 1) they took 9-10 minutes per batch in my microwave, and 2) they stuck to the plate really badly. I wanted a quick snack but it ended up being kind of a pain in the you-know-what, so I don't know if I'll make them again.

Even with all the positive reviews I was so skeptical that a microwave could produce crispy, light potato chips. I was wrong! The oil isn't necessary, at all. I sliced them real thin by hand with a very sharp knife, placed them on a pam-sprayed plate, lightly sprized the tops of the slices as well, and sprinkled with a bit of garlic salt. It took 4 minutes in my microwave, and they're delicious. I decided to experiment while the family was sleeping, now I wish they were awake to taste them! Thank you for the amazing recipe, Jessica!

Surprisingly good.  At first I used a plate, but there was some sticking and the plate was like a million degrees, so I tried parchment directly on the microwave turntable, which worked like a charm (it requires less time as well, so watch closely to avoid burnt chips).  I also used Pam instead of the bag+oil system.  I laid the chips out on a plated, lightly sprayed each side, and then transferred them to the parchment on the microwave turntable.  Once done, I seasoned them with sea salt.  The only drawback is that I can only make 12 chips at once!  Compared with deep frying, this method is MUCH quicker and easier, and the chips can be served immediately because there is no drying/cooling required.

Some of them were very good, and some weren't.  They were either perfect, too mushy, or too hard.  I probably won't make again, as they weren't very consistent.

So easy, but it is slow to do, and therefore I eat them as soon as they get out of the microwave oven.

I would have rated these a lot higher if I could figure out a way to get them off the plate. So far I've been chippng away at them but it looks like the plate needs to soak in the sink to remove the rest. Sorry. Maybe parchment paper would work?

I'm hooked on microwave chips!!
I was a bit wary-Im all about heating up left-overs in the microwave, but baking and frying chips didnt sound like an appealing food. I was wrong(Im not sure about the microwave baking yet, though)

So, I used Idaho potatoes, washed and peeled. I used a mandoline (sp?) to cut them all very thing and uniform. I think one key is to pat the sliced pieces dry with a papertowel. I used a ceramic dinner plate and sprayed it with Pam. I put two potatoes at a time in the bag with 1/2-1 T. of oil, closed the bag and mushed it around to coat all the pieces.
I overlapped just a bit and was able to break them apart with no problem. I sprinkled with sea salt. It took around 7 minutes per plate, but I still watched for the last minute to add or take away time.
My kids were eating them as fast as I made them. I will try some different seasonings-as soon as I can make some that stay around long enough to get some seasonings on them.

Thanks for a great recipe.

Wow! This is an amazing recipe! This defies my dad's idea that nothing in the microwave can become crispy (unless you burn it, of course :) ). You may need a little more salt for a whole potato, but within three minutes, I had amazing potato chips! I used the vegetable peeler, as suggested, and LEAVE THE PEEL ON! Some of the best chips come from the peel! Thank you! It is one of the most creative and delicious recipes that I have made!

I was kinda surprised that they actually work! However, do make sure to grease the plate well...they stick like crazy. I found that using a vege peeler to slice the potatoes really help. It only took 3 minutes since they were so thin, and it makes sure that they will be crispy. I flavored mine with some popcorn seasoning. Old bay worked really well too.

these were really good, they taste even better than my favourite chip brand. i used the popcorn flavour shakers(dill pickle, ketchup, salt & vinegar) and that made them even better. thanks :D

I wish I could award 'no stars' for this recipe.  After seeing all the wonderful reviews, I thought I had to try it.  I did...and it blew my microwave!  And it's not that old, or cheap!  What a letdown.  The chips that did get cooked were somewhat rubbery as well.  Bummer, all 'round.

Fabulous recipe!  Just make sure you put enough oil on the plate so the chips don't stick.  I seasoned mine with popcorn seasonings and they were delicious!

The chips turn out perfectly nice and crisp in the microwave.  Here is some of my experience:

1.  I lightly oiled the plate as suggested but that didn't do it.  Bits a d pieces stayed behind on my plate.  I did wax paper and it was much easier.
2.  Straight salt isnt very exciting- I did that once with my first go round.  

3.  Potatoes to start to colour up and oxidize but I added some lime juice as soon as I saw the colour show up.  Well news flash!!!!  It also makes the chips very tasty and stops the oxidation so win win!  Slapped a small amount of salt and some pepper and lemon pepper in a shaker bag and shook the chips in this when they were done and they were delish.

4.  It's fast to do one plate but to just do one whole potato is time consuming and labour intensive.  My microwave took about 5 minutes exactly.  One normal sized russet sliced thin on a mandolin will likely keep you at the microwave for well over an hour!  Since it's 5 minutes per batch you'll be very occupied that whole time.



I will still make again because I think this is healthier and I like that I can jazz up and play around with them.



Gonna gourmet it up for the next oil spray with white truffle oil and then toss in some pepper!

Just made these at lunchtime, came out as closer to store bought than I would have imagined.  I cut on a mandoline & presoaked as others suggested for 15 minutes.  Drained & dried the slices off.  Oiled parchment paper, misted the slices, salted and nuked for 7 minutes in a 1200 watt microwave.  No clean-up required.  Came out perfect.  Thanks!!

donnt think i'll be doing it again though as its probably much cheaper to buy potato chips than to have another "microwave safe" safe crack into two :/

WWHHHOOOAAAA. !!!! I was Not a believer when I read the recipe. Not anymore :):) I used little baby wax potatoes and they were GREAT!! Kids were fans as well. I used the food processor to slice them up in about a second, I used parchment paper, sprayed them with Pam, sprinkled with Kosher salt and nuked them for 7 mins.This DOES WORK!! Can't wait to try them with a bigger potato and have hubby try these. Keeper! Thanks soo much Jessica!!

Fabulous!  What more can be said?  Except that when I'm here alone, I don't need to buy any chips, which means I can only eat as many as I'm willing to cook...,then if I'm interested in making too many chips, I just need to look back through my recipe box here at allrecipes.com and figure out what I *ought* to be fixing instead!  *grin*  Thanks for a great recipe.  The whole family loves these!

These are addictive and ridiculously easy to prepare. I eliminate the plastic bag thing, and just use spray olive oil. I microwave for 6 minutes until lightly browned and they're perfectly crispy. They are delicious with seasoning salt, though plain sea salt is great too.

Yum!  What a fun treat!  After reading some reviews, I tried a few different suggested techniques.  Here are my two cents on different options: 
1) An oiled plate, as described in the recipe, works best.  Just use a potholder so you don't burn your hands!  
2) Although I love to cut calories, these taste way better when tossed in a bad with vegetable oil than they do when sprayed with butter-flavored cooking spray.  
3) Mine took 9-10 minutes per batch, but a partial batch (plate was about half full) were burnt after 7.  
I've only tried seasoning with salt and seasoned salt so far, but I'll try other ideas next time!

I had a hamburger but nothing to go with it, so I thought I'd try this recipe out.  YUM!  Why would I ever buy potato chips again?  I sprinkled them with salt, pepper, and a bit of garlic powder (I'm a garlic fanatic!), and they were fabulous!  :)

These were so easy to make and tasted great!  I just used parchment paper sprayed with cooking spray and spritzed the potatoes with it too.  Very low fat.  My husband loved these also.  Just make sure the potatoes are brown or they won't crisp up.

Skeptical, but was happily proved wrong! These suckers come out tasting like chips. Followed the recipe and use the cooking spray as some suggested. I have a newer microwave and about 3-3/12 minutes was more than enough. 15 seconds definitely made a difference when cooking them. I wish my microwave were bigger so I could make more of these at a time!

Word of warning! Made a couple of batches of these (which by the way, were excellent!) and like a couple of other reviewers, my microwave (newer GE ) overheated and smelled like rubber burning! I won't know until we get serviced , if it is usable again. :{

The chips are very good.  It is very time consuming.  I spent most of my time making the chips.  My advice would be to make the chips in advance.  Also, some chips were done before others.  You really have to keep your eyes on the chips or it will burn.

I have been wanting to try this for some time and after making some mashed potatoes, I saved three potatoes to try this out.  My kitchen aid mixer attachment worked wonderfully for slicing the potatoes.  My problem was with the slices sticking to the plate.  I followed the directions exactly as written so I'm not sure what went wrong.  The pieces I could scrape from the plate were tastey but wasn't worth the work and mess.

Amazing indeed! Snowed it and this came up in the RE. . . couldn't hurt to try it. Delicious. I used the peeler, sprayed the plate and potatos with olive oil. The first batch took 3 mins. in my microwave, the second 2.30 mins. That was where it stayed until the potato was gone. Gonna do it again, try some spices :)

Who would have thought to even TRY making potato chips in the microwave?? I was looking for a recipe to use up the last of my smaller potatoes from the garden and came across this. The menu was meatball subs, fruit salad and this was just perfect to go with!!! The chips came out great and took only 4 to 4 1/2 minutes per batch. I used olive oil and just drizzled some into a pie plate and shook the potato slices in that, and then laid out in a circular pattern on parchment paper as others suggested. No overlapping! I used a mandoline (sp?) and sliced very thin. The occasional thicker slices didn't come out as light and crispy, they were heavier and harder...like the Cape Cod kettle chips...actually hurt my teeth a little! Thanks for sharing this recipe, we loved it!

after experimenting with this recipe a couple times (which is so versatile!) I've discovered that Yukon Gold potatoes make the BEST potato chips I've ever had using this method!  I used pam spray instead of the bag method just to save time and I had to microwave mine for about 5 to 5 1/2 minutes and I have a very powerful microwave.  I just cut mine thin using a sharp knife.  They turned out great even without being super thin.   thanks so much!

so very tasty! very easy! I used my mandolin and it made it especially simple. I only wish I had a bigger plate and microwave so I could make more. I was going to take a pic and post it but I ate them too fast to get the camera out!

Absolutely marvelous! I still can’t believe that potato chips can be made in a microwave! I made them and they looked like Cape Cod Potato Chips and tasted even better! I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil as well as freshly ground salt & pepper. Who knew that it could be this easy? Thank you so much for sharing!

5 stars because it really is very easy and the results are really crunchy, not rubbery or funky at all.  i don't have a mandoline, but i have a slicer that slices pretty well.  they would be better a little thinner, but the result with a thicker cut turns out kind of on the cracker side.  since we were just looking for a snack, we were perfectly content with that!  thanks for such an easy recipe with so few ingredients! (oh, i also omitted the oil as one reader suggested and just spray the plate and potatoes with pam, so you cut out an extra step and fat/calories)

I just don't get what all of the fuss was about.  I made several batches. They either came out soft like a hashbrown potato or really chewy.--not crispy at all.  I used a mandolin to cut them. I'm not really sure what the problem was.  The softer ones were decent tasting---but NOT potato chips.  Maybe its my microwave   or the plate I used. I used a corelle type of plate.

These were pretty good as far as taste and texture. The only problem I had, was the chips sticking to the plate. I cooked the second batch on a paper plate (Dixie), and that worked much better. Also, the cook time on a regular plate was a little longer than stated, and the cook time on the paper plate was a little shorter, so watch them carefully near the end there. All-in-all, pretty good. I will make them again.

I had no idea you could make chips in the microwave! I just sprayed the plate and top of the potatoes with pam and it didn't stick.     I salted them before microwaving them for 5 minutes and they were perfect.  It does take more effort than buying a bag of chips, but it is more fun.  Since you can't make that much at a time it also saves you from eating more chips than you should.

I made one batch in the microwave as directed, and baked another batch in the oven at 500 degrees. The microwaved chips were excellent! The oven-baked batch were not. They took lots of ketchup to be palatable. I used olive oil for both.

I saw this recipe and thought 'sure, in the Microwave" then I decided what the heck, it'll only cost me 1 potato & a little grease to try it.  So I did.  They were great.  I watched them closely the first batch because I wasn't sure what power my microwave is. (it's 1200 I have found out)  So yummy.  Reminds me of some you get at fairs, maybe because when they cook the smell of that grease is so "fair like".  Anyway, for people that live by themselves and do not like to by a bag of chips and most get stale before you finish them - THIS IS FANTASTIC.  You just cook the amount you want and have fresh good chips.  I had a "V" sliced that I got at the State fair last summer, used the "Thin" side and they cut perfectly.  Let my sister taste some when she stopped by and the next Saturday, we had to run to the Outlet mall and get a slicer for her.  Very good and fun to make too.  Thanks

Why didn't I think of this?!?! These are AWESOME and sooo fun! I used olive oil on parchment paper initially, but later batches were on plain parchment paper and they did not stick at all. I used fine sea salt and these were DELICIOUS! I used my Pampered Chef grater/slicer and these were so easy! I liked them a little chewier than my husband so I made my slices a tad thicker. These are so much healthier for you. Thank you Jessica!

I've made this about 5 times this week. I use the slicer on a cheese box-grater.  I don't bother shaking the potatoes in a bag with the oil, it's messy and everything just sticks together. Instead I use a pastry brush to coat a dinner plate, lay out the slices, then brush more oil on top. When they're done, use a spatula to get them off the plate.  Easy and sooo good.

Like other commenters, I was skeptical at first (how can potatoes crisp in in a microwave?), but wow! I'd love to make these for a party, but I'd probably eat them before they could make it out of the kitchen! A tip for those of you who don't have a mandolin: a vegetable peeler works just as well, as long as you've got steady hand control.

I always make a mess using the oil in a plastic bag to toss the sliced potatoes, so I tried non-stick cooking spray and they turned out perfectly and my best batches ever!  I use the cheese slicer in the side of my cheese grater (mine is on the back, but they are also on the side- use the part that simply slices the cheese or use a mandolin veggie slicer using the attachment that gives the THINNEST slices). Using THIN slices is paramount to the success of this recipe.  If you prefer thick cut chips, then I don't think this is the recipe or cooking method for you.  Mine have always turned out extremely unevenly cooked, soggy, and many were still raw in the middle.  The ultra thin chips cook evenly and thoroughly every time.  On my most recent batch, I sprayed my plate with non-stick spray, as usual.  However, without the oil in the bag step, I simply laid them on the plate and sprayed the top side of the potato slices with the non-stick spray as well.  I sprinkled with a light coating of salt (it is super easy to over-salt these guys, so err on the light side starting out) and microwave on high (1100 watt oven) for 3 minutes.  Pull the plate out with a towel or pads (careful- the plate is scalding hot) and flip them over.  I don't mind them sticking together- they are easier to turn!  Cool and additional 2-3 minutes until they just start to brown.  Watch them carefully the last minute- they burn easily and you just want a golden brown color for optimum crunch. Enjoy!

Had to try it when I stumbled upon this recipe. Everyone else said 3-5 minutes in the microwave, or up to 10-12 minutes, but mine were getting browned and crisp in just 2-2.5 minutes. Might be the oil I used, or a powerful microwave, or the potatoes I used, I don't know. I used a red potato. I sprayed Pam on parchment paper cut to cover the glass microwave turntable, and I dipped freshly cut potato slices in a plate of peanut oil. They turn brown at slightly different times, so I'd remove the browning chips and cook the rest 15-30 seconds longer until they started browning. I don't own a mandoline, so I tried a peeler first, but I thought those chips were too thin, so then I used a sharp knife to cut slices about quarter-thick. Added sea salt at the end, but it didn't stick well once the chips were cooling, so next time I'll likely add salt/seasoning to the tops of the chips before cooking. They had a delicious fresh potato flavor. Will definitely try again.

Takes much longer to cook but worth it.  I used two large platters with parchment paper and rotated filling and cooking.  Each platter took 9 minutes in the micro making sure the chips did not overlap.  I used the mandolin to slice Yukon Gold potatoes thinly, quickly and easily, and sprinkled hot chips with a mixture of sea salt, onion powder and cayenne pepper.

Flawless. The thinner sliced the better but even the thick ones, while not as crunchy, are delicious. I did try this once with yellow potatoes and they did not crisp up - the russet/brown potatoes have always turned out for me. I usually slice my potato, put in a small plastic bag with a drizzle of olive oil, then mix and arrange in the microwave. Super fast "cleanup" that way. Thanks so much for sharing!

This is a yummy treat, however it does take some practice.  I had to try a couple of batches before I could get it right.  I either left them in a few seconds too long and burnt them, or they stuck to the plate and I could not rescue them.  I also found them to be very time consuming.  I could not step away from them for too long or I would starting smelling the wonder odor of burnt potatoes. One this I did discover was its actually better if you slice them a little thicker.  This way they do not stick to the plate as badly. Like I said this is a very delicious snack and in the end I will most definitely make these again.

Like others have said, spray the plate with pam then spray the top of the slices, then microwave.  I soaked my slices for 10 minutes in cold water then rinsed and dried really well prior to cooking.  Awesomeness in every single batch so far :)

It's actually quite amazing how good these are.  I even shared the recipe with my mother who didn't believe me that you could make potato chips in the microwave.  Now neither of us buy potato chips anymore.  I did make slight modifications.  My potatoes insisted on sticking to my plate, so I started using parchment paper.  I found I could also fit more slices on parchment than a plate.  I also stopped coating in a plastic bag.  I now place the potatoes on the parchment, drizzle some oil and then use a brush to make sure all pieces are coated.

Great recipe, I resisted store bought chips yesterday and waited to try this experiment when I got home. I was not 100% sure that I could make these in the microwave. 
Well I give this a 5 star for sure. My husband and I had some with an early evening drink before dinner satisfied my craving for chips without the salt they were crispy and delicious especially if you are trying to watch how much salt you consume. I used one medium size potato which would have been good for one person but double it if you are serving two people. My husband is also a chip fan and loved them. 
Although the time to cook was between 3 to 5 mins. I had to leave in for 8 to 10 (older microwave). The only difference I would make the next time would be to use less oil to coat the the potato and pat with paper towel before serving to ensure there was less oil on the chips. 
I am sure if you are not worried about your salt intake they would be delicious with added salt, steak spice, BBQ spices. 
I have added this recipe to my recipe box and will definitely be making these again and again for our grandchildren.

These are SO good!  Who would have thought microwaved potatoes could be so delicious.  I used the parchment paper, worked like a charm.  Also, instead of tossing in a bag of oil, I sprayed them lightly with olive oil from a misto sprayer. Just enought!  

Try soaking your potatoes in some hot sauce..then pat them dry as per the recipe.  Serve with a sour cream and chive dip.  I've tried pepper with lime, garlic and onion, greek seasoning, lemon pepper, etc.  Anything goes and everything is good!

The flavor of a microwaved chip is surprising good and if you can make healthier chips that's fantastic. The only hang-up for me is how many can be cooked at one time. Still you have to weigh the pros and cons. I think I will check into baking these, because it's a good idea...just I sometimes need more at once. Five stars for being so tasty and better for you. I sprayed with pan coating like another person suggested.

I have made my own chips before but used the oven.  These were so much quicker and turned out much crispier.  I sliced them thinly with my mandoline and they took about 5 min. in the microwave to crisp up. Instead of using oil on the plate I lined it with parchment paper, worked perfectly! 1 large baking potato made a whole bowl of chips. Salt & vinegr chips are my favorite..I've already ordered the seasoning to make my own.  Thank you Jessica for sharing.

I've always wanted to make homeade potato chips! This was my first time. The recipe was quick and easy, only about 15 minutes.  I used coconut oil and a small amount of sea salt. Awesome! Was gonna take a pic, but I tried one and couldnt stop eating them..oops...

I have made these twice, once with russet potatoes and, today, with purple potatoes. Both were easy and tasted great. I don't know if it was the slightly thicker cut potatoes having more moisture, or my HUGE microwave oven that made the difference, but they took about 7-8 minutes for me. I placed them as close as possible without overlapping directly on the parchment paper covered turntable, then misted them with olive oil and sprinkled with salt before cooking. This recipe is a keeper for sure. Thank you, Jessica, for submitting it.

Absolutely fantastic! Only complaint is I can't make them fast enough! I think the cooking time definitely depends on the thickness (and of course your microwave). We did a thin batch and then later a thick batch and both were equally yummy!!!

These are very good. They will never be the same as the packaged stuff but then these don't contain unpronounceable ingredients, they are easy to make,have more substance to them.
I printed off the recipe and inadvertently left it on the printer.  My husband saw it, was intrigued enough to make a couple of batches while I was out. Big surprise for me! The only reason for 4 stars rather than 5:the chips don't all come out nice and brown - some have a kind of discoloration that reminds me of raw potatoes left out too long - those chips are a little chewier. Will be making again though, likely frequently. Thanks to the poster.  Great idea.

These are great!  It is a wonderful snack and the taste is far better than bag potato chips.
The best part, you don't end up eating the whole bag! One potato is plenty to satisfy that craving..

Warning, this is more of a review of technique than of the recipe as written.  Why? Because I did not have any white potatoes, so I used a small sweet potato, I do not own a mandoline, so I used a potato peeler, and I skipped the oil step (as suggested by another reviewer) and used cooking spray on a piece of parchment cut into a round, then sprayed the top of the sweet potato pieces.  Cooked for 5 minutes in my microwave, light sprinkle of Kosher salt and oh my, yummy!  Sweet potatoes need to be cooked to a light brown as well so they will crisp.  Great idea, this could become a habit of mine!

I followed the instructions exactly, and I now have a dinner plate with a brand new finish.  Rough, because each and every potato  chip stuck. I cant even scrape them off with a butter knife. I hope soaking will work!!!

I modified this recipe to suit my DH's diet needs - no salt and no oil.  Yep just plain ol' chips!  I love this method, it does not make tons at a time but he only needs a few in his lunch anyway so it suits us perfectly.  I used my mandolin to slice thinly, patted the potatoes dry and used parchment paper on the dish.  The potatoes browned nicely and I removed to a cookie rack to cool.  They stayed crisp in a ziploc bag the next day.  Definitely going to make this again and experiment with seasoning them up!

I tried this recipe because I was looking for a healthier version of potatoe chips.  I wanted to lose some weight but have fun with food while I was at it.  My body needs carb so I thought this was a win-win for me...  And boy was I right!  I can honestly say I lost over 20 pounds eating potatoe chips! (Along with other healthy foods of course).

WOW, super easy and very tasty!  I had been trying to make these in the oven, and they never seemed to get crispy enough.  However, these taste like real chips!  I used my mandalin to slice the potatoes, then sprayed a round plate with PAM.  Laid out the slices (with no overlap) and then sprayed the top with more PAM.   Microwaved them for about 6-8 minutes (you will just have to watch them towards then end, once they start to brown they are done).  Removed them and sprinkled with salt.  My husband and kids gobbled them up!  Cannot wait to try again and experiment with various seasonings.

These were a pleasant surprise.  I was out of parchment paper otherwise I would have tried that on the microwave plate first so instead I tried the silicone mat thinking I wanted to get as many as possible going at a time.  It scortched. So I went to the plate....no matter how much oil or spray I used they still stuck a litttle but were very good.  I used tongs to remove them from plate to a brown lunch sack.  I sprinkled with sea salt and shook the sack to distribute salt. Copying a local restaurant recipe, I dipped them in a mixture of mayo and garlic (3/4 cu mayo & 2 sm cloves of crushed garlic).  Yum!  Allow enough time if you need to make a lot. These were even better the next day.

What a fantastic idea!!!!
These are delish...especially if you start trying some different flavours. I made up a mixture of olive oil, vinegar, and sea salt and coated potato slices in it b4 cooking. Kids love them.
Thanx for a fab recipe.

These are amazing! Too much fun to make. I have an older microwave, so it took about 15 minutes per batch. My teen-agers and Husband loved them.

These are the absolute BEST!!!  I didn't believe that they would turn out so good.  I sprayed parchment paper with cooking spray then sprayed the top of the potatoes.  Be sure to experiment with seasonings.  Yummy, yum, yum!!!!

This is SUCH a brilliant idea! The only thing I changed is the oil -- instead of coating the potatoes, I only spritzed the plate with olive oil and then put the potatoes on without any additional oil. Cooked and then sprinkled with a mix of salt and bbq seasoning...

Wow! I just made these thinking it would be a total failure, but they came out so good! I ended up using a vegetable peeler, cooking spray, and cooking them on parchment paper on the microwave turntable. Who would've thought they would turn out to be just like Lay's potato chips??! Dangerously addictive :) Thanks for sharing

For what they are - microwaved potato chips - these were fabulous.  I found that with a round plate in the microwave, certain chips (the middle ring, not in the centre and not on the outer part of the plate) cooked quicker than the rest... Haven't figured out a way for them to bake evenly without having to remove some then continue cooking the others.

Really good!  This method works for sweet potatoes too.  I used a potato peeler instead of a mandolin, and coated the pieces with olive oil.  I only had to microwave my chips for about 2 minutes, but the final result was absolutely delicious!

Whenever I make these, I wind up standing in front of the microwave (bad, bad, bad), eating them as soon as I pull 'em off the plate.

WOW!  In a microwave.  How easy is this.  I did  it on the plate first and didn't like that so much.  So next time I will try the parchment paper other reviewers mentioned.  The plate was very hot.

These tasted so much like store bought potato chip! I used a narrow potato, so I peeled and made the slices with the potato peeler. As another reviewer stated, it took my potato chips 10 minutes in the microwave on the first batch anyway. With each batch it took about 2 minutes less once the plate was hot. Recipe made 4 plates of spread out chips. The only problem is the recipe states four servings, but I think I ate nearly 2/3 of the chips as it is only actually 1 potato! I did have fun making these and they were pretty tasty today. Although, this is definitely a recipe only for 1-2 people not a group, as making even one potato takes a good amount of time. Thanks submitter though for teaching me this neat technique. :)

This is an innovative way of making chips, I've never tried microwaving them and actually was pleasantly surprised - I tossed them in a garlic/seasalt blend but I could see making these countless ways with different spices - Kudos - great idea!!!

So totally impressed! not greasy, fatty tasting, they were perfect! I use 'were' in past tense as they are now gone, within minutes by me and my family.  Wow, in a time when you now have to conserve monetary funds, this is a great saver.  And if you want to make a full bag without all the air...you can and not be charged the extra price for a half a bag of chips.  Love it  Thanks so  much, and man was my hubby happy.  He's always impressed when I find new ways of saving money.

I followed the directions exactly and my potatoes adhered themselves to the plate!  Two hours later, I still have the plate soaking to try and get the last bits off.  I love the concept, but it just did not work out for me.  I might try this again sometime, using parchment paper like another reviewer did, but only after I am able to afford a mandoline to do the slicing (it took FOREVER to slice the potato manually).  If it works out for me that way, I'll update my review, but until then I have to give the recipe only two stars.  I'm sorry :-(  UPDATE:  I bought a mandoline to slice the potatoes and I also used parchment paper to line the plate, as recommended by another reviewer.  This time my chips came out beautifully!  The first half was a little too oily because I had oiled the parchment paper, so I omitted that step on the second half and they were perfect.  We sprinkled them with a little Greek seasoning and then gobbled them down.  It's a lot of work for a little bit of potato chips, but can be a wonderful thing if you're craving potato chips and don't have any in the house.  I'm increasing my rating to four stars, based on the success I had with the change in cooking technique (using un-greased parchment paper to line the plate).

be careful not to overcook, or the chips will be overly crunchy and hard to bite into.

this is fine for a quick snack for ONE. It takes ages if you think of it as a side dish. I'll keep making my potato chips in the oven! And use plenty of Pam under and over the chips. In my microwave it took almost 15 min for a single batch

Wow!  I never knew you could make chips in the microwave.  It is a little hard to get the cooking time exactly right, and it is time-consuming to slice the potatoes, but definitely worth it.

I'll admit that I was skeptical before trying this recipe. Potato chips from the microwave? YES! These are easy and delicious! I used popcorn salt and freshly ground black pepper and they were fabulous! I can't wait to make these again. Hubby has requested hot and spicy seasoning next time!

One potato made one large plateful. Count on doing atleast 4 or 5 potatoes, since they are so delicious! They were so much better after being left to dry. My microwave took about 12+ minutes though.

One of our favorite new recipes.  So fun and easy.  I have a mandoline that makes super-thin slices--essential for good chips.  I cook these directly on a sheet of parchment in the microwave--works great.

What a wonderful recipe! I wish I would have found this sooner. I read some reviews and couldn't help but laugh at some of them, esp. those that blamed this recipe for the breakdown of their microwave. Anyway, I tried this with both the oil and PAM and found that PAM works best when sprayed evenly on the plate. I have tried different sizes of potatoes, thinly sliced (about 1-2 mm) and found that the cooking time varies. Just keep a close eye on them until they turn lightly golden and not browned all the way (will taste burnt). Will definitely continue making this again and again. Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe, Jessica!

Excellent!! The trick is to cut them very, very thin. I had to cut the potato by hand because my mandolin didn't cut them thin enough. My microwave is old so I had to cook them quite a bit longer. I put parchment paper in the microwave and put the slices directly on the paper. I sprayed them with buttery Pam before baking. Yum!

What an amazing recipe! I was surprised it really worked and now I am elated. I can produce fat-free potato chips at home! (I used Pam spray as another reviewer suggested--butter flavor). I can not WAIT to try these with other flavorings and am now wondering if this process would work on other vegetables! Thank you for submitting this recipe!

These chips are great! They taste very good, are very crispy and they are much better for you then store bought chips. I sprayed them with olive oil or you can use Pam spray. I put them in my microwave and microwaved them on high for 5 minutes. I then did them in two minute increments until they were golden brown and crispy. I also find that a flat plate works better then a plate with sides slighty raised or a baking dish with sides. Delicious! Thanks for sharing!

Fabulous! Definitely do the parchment paper, no sticking what so ever.  I also placed the paper directly on the mircowave turntable. I dipped them in oil and I also tried just spraying them with pam.  Both works well.  Thanks!
UPDATE: sprinkled them with ground sea salt and malt vinegar...YUM!

Awesome! The best way to go is to place the chips on parchment paper cut to fit the turn tabel in the microwave. I learned the hard way that they stick to the oiled plate. The kids love them and they are so easy. We like to sprinkle red wine vinegar and crushed sea salt on the cooked chips.

These chips are probably the best I have ever had, maybe because of the effort that goes into it.  They were totally worth every minute of it.  I didn't have a Mandolin or any other slicer just a very big sharp knife and it took about 45 min to do one potato, but that was all I needed because I maybe ate a quarter of what was made and kept the rest for a snack tomorrow.  I also put the slices into a bowl and mixed them that way, it was easier for me; I think I just liked to get my hands dirty.  Conclusion, I will DEFINITELY make these again maybe with just cooking spray or spry olive oil

My 18 year old son ate most of them before I could get a pic! These are impossible (in my opinion) if you don't have a good slicer. They need to be paper thin! Also, a really strong microwave is needed. While I was cooking these it reminded me of my mom-in-law who still has the first mw that she bought. When we get together all of us "girls" say "when are you going to get a new one?" Her's isn't even that old because my father-in-law refused to allow one in his house because the micro "waves" are hazardous to your health. He could still be right but I can't imagine cooking w/o one. I used a combo of russet & red potatoes. I found it easier to just spray canola oil on a paper plate put the potatoes on it & respray the top of the potatoe. Very good way to use up potatoes. Don't overcook!

Very easy, good and impressive!  My 7 year old came home saying his friend's mom had packed him homade potato chips for lunch but that they were too salty.  He asked me if I could make some for him too (just not as salty).  I found this recipe and my little boy loved them!!!!

WOW
I made some vegetable soup and had a big potato left over and didn't want to waste it. So I came here and found this recipe...AMAZING! I too expected the microwave to make it mooshy and wet...but no way! Crisp as can be. REALLY yummy. I tried all different kinds of seasoning too...awesome! 

I didn't use oil. So there's no fat! That's the best thing about it. I just gave the taters a spray of cooking spray and salt. Then just took my hands shuffled them around to get them coated. Worked amazingly.

These were surprisingly good. Make sure you don't brown them TOO much or they will taste burnt.

I used coconut oil and my pink himalaya salt with chili pepper grinder for the salt.  A dish of garlic powder (not salt) and they tasted better than any store bought ones! I will make again.

The potato chips themselves tasted great, but the only issue I had was when I took them out of the microwave, they were stuck on to the plate. They were stuck solid. I had to scrape them off with a knife! And if you are wondering, I did oil the chips AND the plate.

Loved it! Used a mandolin which made slicing fast and easy. Had 2 large plates that I put in microwave for about 4 minutes each, rotating plates as one batch was ready. Cooked enough for 4 people in 12 minutes.

1st time I tried this the chips came out nice and crispy. I think 8-10 minutes (depending on wattage of microwave) is ideal. I used kosher salt which was a mistake as it was too salty but that was on me not the recipe. Very easy and who knew you could make chips in the nuker.

So easy to make... Just slice and put for 5 minutes in the microwave. Kids kept asking for more. One problem I found though is that it took a long time to make a batch of 2 potatoes, when 1 patch is about 12 slices.

For those who had problems with potatoes sticking to the plate;
use parchment paper.  Works great.

I just made them but the plate didn´t work. I have 3 plates waiting for me to scrub away some chips from them as soon as I arrive home! I used Silpat silicone mat for the fourth and ir worked well, only I had to increase minutes in oven. Aaaand.... if you think your seasoning are great on these.... try coating them with chocolate and adding some sea salt on top! Amazing....

I've made potato chips using a vegetable peeler,I usually cut my finger or fingers using a mandoline, I know I should have been more careful, but in a deep fryer or large frying pan they come out just as good.

This recipe is great. I sliced them on a cheap plastic vegetable slice. They were sliced a little unevenly but they still came out great. I placed the slices on parchment right on top of the microwave glass turntable. I brushed olive oil on both sides of slices and sprinkled salt and microwaved for about 8 minutes. I made one potato. Now I wish I had made more. My husband ate more than half.

I used our peeler to cut small red potatoes into paper thin slices. Yummy, easy, and very convenient. Thanks for the recipe Jessica!:)****ALSO**** Watch the chips very closely after they get the tiniest bit golden-brown. They'll turn crispy and brown more really fast. If you aren't careful they'll stick to the plate.

My kids and I loved them! it took a little longer for me, about 6-7 minutes but they came out well, nice and crispy. I just added salt after taking them out of the microwave and prep is like 10 min if you use a vegetable peal to slice them.

Should be able to do these in the oven too, then you can flavour them with different flavourings. I would slice the chips, and place in water for a few minutes, making sure each side of the chip was wetted to wash off the starch. The cook at the cafeteria did this with the fries, she sliced all the fries the night before, and kept them overnight in buckets of water, she would also pre fry them, and then at lunchtime would actually fry them golden brown. This was a time saving device to keep the fries hot at lunch time in the school, less than 45 minutes to feed well over 300 kids. Bake the chips at 350F watching the first batch to learn the timing, they should come out crispy and delicious. Mist both sides with Pam or oil from a mister, and add any flavour wanted, chili, lime, dill (use the pickle juice in another mister) vinegar or whatever.

I kind of liked these, daughter gave them 2 stars and husband gave them 1 star. He compared them to a meteorite falling to earth. I'll try these again when I'm home by myself and want some chips but won't be making them for my family! They did take way longer in the microwave. 11 min for the 1st batch and 6 for the next. (they were sliced thinner)

Yum!! these are pretty good. I only gave four stars because at 3 minutes the chips were too brown and at 2 1/2 minutes they were not done. I guess I will have to play around with it. But I will be trying these again.

These are GREAT! I cannot get over how easy they are to make, and so much healthier too, compared to store bought! Very versatile! Would never have guessed the microwave could work so well making home made potato chips! It does take some experimentation to cook bacon correctly in a microwave, rather exactly like it will take some experimentation to cook potato chips in the microwave. But if you "get it" you MIGHT not go back to cooking "the old way". At the very least the new knowledge will give you more choices in the future. Stirring often will be a hint. These deserve the 5 star rating!

Very easy, very tasty, and healthier than buying a bag from the store!  Only issue I had was I had to slice the potato by hand, so thickness was inconsistent, so had to watch the chips as they cooked, as they were ready at different times.  They go from "almost ready" to "burned" quickly, so watch closely!

Fantastic!! I couldn't believe how easy this was.  Took a little longer than recommended though. They turn brown within a matter of a few seconds, so keep a close eye on them towards the end of the cooking time.

Can't believe it!! Was very skeptical of microwaved crispy crunchy potato chips--no more!!!  These are an awesome much healthier alternative to bagged store bought chips!!  Besides you can make 2 potato-2 servings and have portion control built in!!  Love Them!

These are delicious!  I used a mandolin to cut the potatoes 1/32" thick.  I covered my microwave turntable with parchment paper and sprayed it with Pam.  I put the potatoes on the outter most part of the turntable (they wont brown if they are in the middle) and sprayed them lightly with Pam.  At this point season the potatoes.  I microwaved them for 4 minutes (in 1000 watt micro) and they were perfectly crunchy.  Becareful because they can brown very quickly!

This is a great recipe. I chose to spray the plate with the cooking spray, then place the potatoes on the plate (leaving NO potato at the center so it wouldn't burn) and then spraying the top again quickly with spray. That way, I didn't need to toss them in a bag with oil. On some of the batches, I also gave a quick sprinkle of salt before cooking, so the salt would stick nicely. TERRIFIC! The only mistake I made was to keep reusing the same two glass plates. One got too hot after a couple batches because I didn't let it cool properly. MY MISTAKE, and it cost me a plate. I'm happy it was a cheap plate, so my foolishness did not come at a high price. It took just about 5 minutes in my microwave. I had my doubts, but this recipe delivered. Potatoes are a cheap food, so this recipe is one worth experimenting with! THANKS!

Even the potatoes I didn't get thin enough were delicious.  I spread them on parchment paper.  Seemed like it took a long time to microwave though.

Incredible. Six minutes from a lowly potato to a bowlful of happiness! Added the salt and 1.5 tbsp vinegar to the oil in the baggie. Used the slicer on the box cheese grater (which was all dented from abuse). It didn't matter. Some chips were thick, some thin, but they were INCREDIBLE. Generously sprayed parchment paper with Pam, and they slid right off into the bowl. I am in big trouble... I'll soon need to widen the doors...

My husband, who's retired and has some time on his hands, has made quite a few batches of these, and we both think they're probably the best potato chips we've ever had. And without deep frying in all that oil!! 

Apparently he had to experiment a bit to get everything just right. I wasn't home while he was making his first batch, and he won't reveal the details. All I know is that there was a fire and I have one fewer dinner plate.

These were fantastic!!  I've never rated a recipe before, but these were so easy to make, that I had to try them.  My husband actually made them, and he liked them so much, he urged me to write a review.  Followed the recipe exactly as written, and they were perfect!

Amazing! This really works. I was skeptical, but I really did get crispy chips from my microwave. I took mine just shy of 4 minutes to get the potatoes brown. I used a pyrex pie plate because my stoneware doesn't work well in the microwave. (Even though it is marked as microwave safe). These were a little greasier than Lay's store bought brand, but they were comparable to store brand chips and at much less cost! Great easy recipe, thanks!

Tip:  pat potato slices dry before spraying with cooking or olive oil before 'waving and arrange with smaller chips nearer center of plate sprayed with oil or on parchment or Silpat mat directly on the glass turntable, if you have one, and watch they don't over-brown.

I am absolutely furious with this recipe!  I followed the directions to a T and while the results of the first (and only) batch were fairly tasty...I have ruined a perfectly good (and discontinued) Phaltzgraff plate.  The chips stuck to the plate and I was only able to salvage 1/2 of them..but the plate itself is now riddled with hairline fractures.  No potato chip is worth this damage!!!  Perhaps using paper plates and wax paper could this be redeemed but I will NEVER attempt this again!!!

YUMMY!! These are great, I'm a chip fanatic and now I can make my own crispy chips! I sprayed parchment paper with PAM, placed the slices on top then sprayed them with PAM too, put in microwave and it took them close to 10 minutes to brown and become crispy.  I cannot wait to make these for my dad who is a bigger chip fan than me!! Thanks for the recipe :)

This is a great recipe for quick potato chips. I usually just spray the plate with a little PAM before cooking instead of using oil. It takes a bit longer for them to crisp whether using oil or not also.

Fantastic!!!!!   You really have to watch the potatoes to avoid over cooking!  I sprayed the potato slices with cooking spray and sprinkled with salt.  Then I  put the sliced potatoes on parchment paper and placed them directly onto the turn table.  I reused the same sheet of parchment paper until I was finished making chips.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Used the mandoline to slice them. Had it on the thinnest setting, next time I will probably increase the thickness slightly. Cooked for ~4min 30 sec. These were great!!

I made these with sweet potato instead, and I added cajun spices to it and it was just amazing! It took around 6-7 minutes to brown in the microwave. Will keep making these! Such a delicious (and healthy) snack!

Excellent way to satisfy a snack craving! I tried different spices and really liked them with ground cayenne pepper with a little Adobo. I had to keep a close eye on them so they wouldn't brown too much...I thought the brown ones tasted kind of burnt. Will make again!

The taste is great and it's an easy recipe, but way too time consuming.  I too ended up with the cooking time being about 10 minutes.  I used about 4 large potatoes cut paper thin with a madolin and wasn't even close to being done when on the third plate my microwave got overheated and gave out.  Ended up resorting to just deep frying them.  I d like that this is much more healthy that frying and they taste just like restaraunt chips, but probably better suited if you just get a hankering for yourself.

This is one of those times when it's really too good to be true, except...IT IS THAT GOOD! CANNOT BELIEVE IT. These chips are FABULOUS and with that little oil???????????????? I, too, had the "yeah, right" attitude as I got them done and then the magic happened. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!

For the most part, I only use my microwave to heat up cold coffee...BUT these are amazing and I think my microwave is going to be doing a lot more work around here. I don't think there will be any chips left by the time my hubby comes home from work :)

WOW!!! Just made these with both sweet potatoes and white ones. They are awesome. I used parchment paper on the glass turntable in my microwave. Sprayed the thin sliced (used one of those box graters) potatoes with olive oil - microwaved about 7 minutes (check as you add time) added a little salt and the are AMAZING!

super easy snack! I used a cheese slicer to get the potato's just right and cooked them on a microwave bacon cooker, sprayed with pam so that I didn't have to use oil! Perfect every time! Thanks!

Phenomenal!  Instead of a dinner plate I went with parchment right on my microwave's turntable as others suggested.  Yukon Gold, skin on and sliced with a mandolin probably a bit on the thick side .  Didn't bother to toss in oil first, just sprayed the parchment with PAM, spread slices in a single layer, sprayed again and sprinkled with kosher salt.  Took 7 minutes.  Seriously, AMAZING.

These are so cool! I agree that it's time consuming but if you just laid the potatoes on the glass insert in the bottom of the nuker, you could do a whole batch at a time. A thought I had AFTER the fact. Hubby couldn't believe I made chips in the microwave. I nearly took total credit for it but then remembered how karma works. Thanks for this one! :o)

These were great and best of all you can make them with no oil. I used russet potatos and placed them on parchment paper then spinkled them with BBQ seasoning. They were great! My family love them!

I'm sorry all but I followed everything exactly and the result was awful.  Chips were also cut very thin by the way.  Oh my what a soggy mess!!  Microwave was heating up something fierce, chips stuck and soggy.  Ones in the middle had brown marks while rest was totally white.  Plate was boiling hot.  All for 14 potato chips?  Using the fryer may not be the healthiest was to go but considering we only eat chips once in a while, the results are always amazing and a lot faster overall.   Glad some of you had good results but for me, I couldn't throw out the mush and the recipe fast enough.  sorry

Wow!  I didn't believe that this recipe would work, but it does.  These chips taste exactly like something you'd buy at the supermarket.  Also, I learned a very important lesson from this recipe.  I learned that ONE big russet potato makes a ton of chips!  This means that in each bag of store-bought chips there is only ONE potato in there!

Saw this had to try it, even if it is 5AM. :) What a great way to satisfy the crunchy/salt fix without have an entire bag of chips in the house.  You can control the oil and seasonings which I think most people want.  Gonna share this with my "dieting" friends. Thanks for sharing. Didn't have any parchment paper, would wax paper work or would it make "waxy chips"?

Took some practice to get these perfect. I made a paste with olive oil and dry ranch dressing seasoning- the taste was delicious! I used two microwaves at the same time and one took about 2 minutes longer, so times can definitely vary. They NEED to brown a little, but a second too long and they can burn.

These are the most expensive potato chips ever!  My daughter (16) loved them so much, she just kept making batch after batch.  After about 12 times, (my son was doing a good job of eating them, too) our relatively new microwave overheated and died.  So, if you have a GE Profile Spacemaker Microwave, cut yourself off at 10 batches.  We don't eat potato chips often, but when we do we certainly won't be buying them.  We'll definitely be making them -- in our  brand new microwave oven....in small batches....

WOW! Desperate to fill a potato chip craving, I turned to allrecipes.com - and these are absolutely fantastic. Take that from a girl that worked in a "Fresh Kettle Chip Wagon" for 4 summers in University. Make these exactly as directed - season them with salt, and enjoy!!

I was so excited to try this recipe out! However, I was very disappointed with the results not to mention wasting time and taters! I used my mandoline so the chips would be paper thin as the recipe states. I followed the recipe and the first batch was completly stuck to the plate! Next batch I knocked the power on the micro down to 50% and I kept checking them. By the time they browned, again stuck to the plate. Next batch I took out right as they were browning, but because they didn't brown up all the way they never got crisp (as the recipe stated) The few that did crisp were really good. I also tried cutting the taters with a knife, but that produced too thick of slices so they never did crisp up but were probably the best of all the batches since I didn't have to waste any of them. This is one recipe I couldn't find a good balance between the oil, the time, and my microwave. Sorry, I really did want to like this :(

Simply delicious! They truly taste like real potato chips! i did have to play around with the timing though because it wasn't quite right. I added some garlic powder to them and they were fantastic! We also used this recipe with sweet potatoes and added cinnamon YUMMY!!!

These are fantastic!  I don't usually coat them in oil and instead spray the dish with oil each time, lay out the potatoes, and then lightly spray the tops with oil before cooking.

Very simple and easy. Cooking time does vary. I would suggest to start out at the recipe's cook time. Mine was burnt at 3.7 minutes. 3 minutes is just perfect for my microwave (1000+ watts).

Yea!  Years ago there was a tv product to make these potato chips - I'd bought it and used it to death - and then lost it in a move. I had made mic chips w/it all the time but after I lost it, I had to go without or buy chips.  Now I can make them again!   THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU for posting this!

Another AR'er recommended this recipe to me because I have a lot of potatoes to use.  I followed the recipe as written.  DH walked in the door, looked at them, put one in his mouth and said, "No more Lay's ever again!"  A definite success.  I also made some with salt and garlic powder on them.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is unbelievable! The chips taste just like out of the bag. I just sprayed a little pam on some parchement paper and layed out the potato slices and sprayed a little more pam on top. I sliced the potatoes very thin with a vegetable peeler. It took exactly 3 min. in my microwave and we ate them all just as fast as they came out. This recipe isn't very practicle if you want to make a lot of chips because it takes so long. But for someone who is on a diet and needs that salty chip fix, this is perfect.

Don't make the mistake of trying this with the main meal.  For something different, I make wings and these chips - trust me, you won't be able to keep up with production!  My husband and son gobbled them up.  The recipe suggested a light oiling of a dinner plate - I suggest a heavier coating (chips stuck with a light coating) and I used olive oil.  I did five min, salted, then another three min.  A great snack.

The only problem with this recipe is you can't cook them fast enough!  Oh - and my microwave died close to the end!  These were so good - my 12 yr old and I got them down to an assembly line - he would wash and slice them, I would spray the plate and spread the potato's in a layer spray them again and put them in the microwave - then get another plate ready while that one was cooking.  Used kosher salt on some and Morton's hot salt on the others!  Will make again once we replace the microwave!

First off, I have about 10 recipes from this site. . and this is the first that inspired me to actually sign up and write a review. I'm sitting here watching the bachelor (thanks ABC) and craving chips. . so I made these. . .THANK GOD!!! I followed the recipe exactly. I used Kosher salt and mixed that in with the oil instead of salting them in the end. AMAZING. And you know, you always feel better when you make it at home instead of buying it in the store. . Microwave=amazing tonight in my book!

I used a mandoline and dumped the cut potatoes into ice water for a few minutes then blotted dry on paper towels.  Only used a little more than a teaspoon of canola per potato and rubbed the slices as I took them out of the bag to make sure they were coated. I rotated 2 sheets of parchment and was done in no time.

I told my son that he was going to laugh at me. He knows then that I am going to present him with another homemade concoction. Then I presented him with a plateful of these chips. I got the thumbs up on this one. Wow! These really brown up and taste just like they should. Mine took approx. 3 1/2 min. in the microwave - and mine is quite powerful. I had better luck using a very sharp knife to slice these ultra thin rather than using the built in blade on my cheap cheese grater. Maybe now that everyone will be asking for this snack I will invest in a mandoline. Only 1 potato makes quite a few chips, and is enough to quench my craving. This is a good way to keep portion control to those of us who can't eat just one. Thanks Jessica. Nice one.

Found this recipe about an hour ago.  Was very skeptical about chips made in the mircrowave, so decided to go make them right then and there.  Oh my goodness these are soooooo good. Coated some with EVOO, then just sprayed the rest with cooking spray to save on calories.  You cannot tell the difference! Sprinkled sea salt and pepper for one batch, caynenne for one batch, dill and salt for the other batch.  I cut mine as thin as humanly possible and they took slightly over 3 minutes. What a delightful surprise!

Oh my gosh, these are some really good and easy snacks! We tried this recipe as a family project. My husband cut the potatoes on the mandoline, and our kids arranged them on the parchment lined stoneware medium bar pan from Pampered Chef. We sprayed the parchment with Pam, and lightly sprinkled it with salt. After just a few minutes in the microwave, we were all very happy. YUM. Thaks for the recipe!

My husband thought I should give this recipe five stars, and he's very stingy with ratings!  So these must be very good.  He ate them as quickly as I cooked them, so I hardly ate any.  I think the taste is similar to store-bought potato chips, but these are healthier, cheaper, and customizable.  I made the first batch with vegetable oil in a bag as the recipe instructed, but then I tried spraying generously with butter-flavored Pam and they were just as good, so I'm definitely giving up on the oil.  I used a mandoline to slice the potatoes (very easy) and put the slices on parchment paper cut to fit the bottom of my microwave.  I patted the slices dry with paper towels before spraying with Pam to make sure they cooked properly.  The chips were too dry for the salt to stick after they were cooked, so I salted them before cooking.  My husband also liked them with garlic pepper.  We want to experiment with more flavorings.  The first batch took about nine minutes to cook, but as the microwave heated up, the batches took less and less time.  The drawbacks of this recipe are that it takes a lot of time to make just a few chips and that the microwave cooking is a bit spotty if you don't use a turntable.

This didn't work out for me. Some sticked to the plate and others were real crispy. I greased the plate.
I will try to make them in the oven next time, see how it works out.

Wow! I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't just made them. I took one reviewer's advice and grated my slices onto paper towels and blotted them dry before putting on the plate. Unfortunately, I cracked one of my microwave-safe plates so next time I would definitely just put slices on the turn table on parchment paper. Even after the loss of my plate I would make again. I used the PAM spray method and they were crispy and brown! P.S. I have never rated any recipe on here so you know these chips are worth a try (at least for 2-3 people, I wouldn't want to make them for a crowd!! It takes too long with only one microwave)

How cool!!!!!  My husband and I tried several different techniques with this recipe and they were all good.  We cut red potatoes (that's what we had) by hand, with the box grater, and with a veggie peeler.  We sprayed plates with PAM, put the taters on in a single layer and lightly sprayed again.  We cooked anywhere from 3-7 minutes.  You have to watch each batch and definitely wear and oven mitt when removing.
I used both Correlle brand plates and Pfaltzgraff stonewear.  The correlle did well, the pfaltgraff cracked!!!
I salted the last batch before I put in the microwave and they were really good.  I'm looking forward to making more of these.  I like the ones that cut a little thicker.  This is a totally fun thing to do with the kids, and healthier than your average fried chip.  I think this is a recipe the chip companies don't want you to see.

These are great! Took me about half an hour  start to finish! I used a mandolin AND a peeler, and I think I like the peeler slices better, but the mandolin is easier. I skipped the oil completely, just sprayed the plate and the potato slices with cooking spray. I cooked each batch for 5 minutes and they came out perfectly, really crispy, great texture. Thanks, this couldn't be easier!

Very easy and quick to make for one or two people (but I wouldn't want to make enough for a crowd!) I used a slicer and made very thin slices. Five minutes on a dinner plate sprayed with pam was just perfect. I used seasoned salt.

Wow! When I found this recipe, I thought that they cant surely turn out well - how wrong was I!! I couldnt wait to test it out, so I headed to the kitchen straight away.  I used small potatoes and cooked them for 9-10 mins, so tasty- they disappeared - didnt even get the chance to season them!! oh well better go and make some more!

I would not try this recipe unless you have a food slicer and can slice in uniform sizes.  I just used a knife and the chips varied from petrified to raw potatoes.  I don't think there was more than 1/8th of an inche difference from smallest to largest.

I could not wait to make these because I did'nt believe they would be any good. Boy was I wrong! I cut a piece of parchment paper to fit the bottom of my microwave {so I could make alot}and followed recipe. You will have to cook them longer than stated though.I served with ranch dip,and salted one batch,cajun seasoned one batch,and sprinkled dry ranch on another. Pretty good! Hubby was as surprised as I was.

This was great fun for my 9-year-old daughter.  I taught her how to safely use the mandolin.  She sliced them thin, put them in a plastic baggie with some oil, tossed them around, and laid a layer on a Pam-sprayed glass baking dish (didn't stick at all).  Popped in the microwave for 8 minutes (tried 2 minutes at a time with the first batch to get the right timing) and then removed them and sprinkled with seasoned salt.  They were terrific!  Thanks!

FANTASTIC !!!  Just couldn't get enough of them. The parchment paper worked great.  I re-used it for about 4 batches of potatoes. 
I can't wait to try sweet potatoes!

I used Pam spray and even dredged them in vinegar. They came out great. I might suggest spraying a glass dish with Pam and using that to make them on. I had no problems at all with sticking. I think I might even just spray the microwave glass turntable and making them straight on that. Crisping them depends on many factors (thickness, microwave, how many are in the micro. etc.) so watch them carefully.

These worked out great for me!  I have to admit I was skeptical of this recipe, so much so that I had oil on the stove to fry some as well but after one batch of each I was sold on the microwaved batch.  It's the only way to go. It does take quite a few batches to get a good amount of chips as they shrink up quite a bit, but it's worth it.  I used a mandoline to get the potatoes very thin and placed them in a bowl of cold water and rinsed them until the water was pretty clear to cut back on the starchiness.  Also I lightly sprayed the plate and tops of the potatoes with butter flavored cooking spray and sprinkled with a little kosher salt.  Six minutes on high and I had delicious chips!   Thank you for sharing this great recipe!

They were good, but they weren't worth all the work. It takes much longer than the recipe states in the microwave. I used Pam instead of oil.
Maybe next time I'll see if they work in the oven?

I never would have thought these would get so crispy during microwave cooking. They are every bit as delicious as store bought, and better. My batches each took 13 minutes to get crisp. I simply sprayed the plate with Pam and the slices with Pam, sprinkled them with lots of garlic powder and a minimal amount of garlic salt. How yummy! Thanks for sharing, Jessica!

OMG these are great! When I read some of other review that said they tasted like store bought and Lays I thought they might be pretty good but after we made the first batch they were gone in minutes! In my opinion, I think they're better than store bought potato chips! Anyone who sees this recipe should definitely make them! I'm definately making them again! If you make them in the oven, be careful after you put them in because they'll burn within a few minutes.

These are awesome!  Made them for myself and loved them so much I ended up making them for friends and family too... big hit!  I used a really sharp knife to cut the potatoes, which wasn't a big deal because I liked that the chips were all a different thickness.  I didn't use any oil, just used non-stick cooking spray on the plate, and then over the slices before microwaving.  Cook time was about ten minutes in both microwaves I used.  Only used a tiny amount of salt... you don't need much!  This is one of those (healthy!) snacks I'll make again and again! :)

These are great from the microwave; didn't even think this would work.  The last few batches were a little starchy, I would recommend rinsing the slices. I liked the idea of spraying the plate in place of the oil, this was easy. I will try this next in the oven to feed my family of six.

The first time I made these chips I used too much oil so be careful. The chips are wonderful and so easy to make. I could not believe you could get something crisp from a micrwave, I was wrong.

I made these exactly as written and my family loved them!  It was very easy, especially with my mandoline.  Watch them closely!  Once they start browning, they will start to overcook very quickly!

This was great! Chips came out nice and crispy. I usually make them in the oven but this is a huge timesaver!

There were really fun & easy to make AND eat.  My 10 yo said it's her new favorite snack.  You can't make a lot at a time (which is probably a good thing).  I just sprayed Pam on a piece of parchment paper, spread the potato slices in single layer & sprayed the top w/ more Pam and placed the parchment paper right on the bottom of the microwave (turn table plate thing).  I used a metal box cheese grater w/ a slicer on the side to cut the potatoes.

I can't believe this worked.  They were really good.  I saw this recipe while browsing and made it from memory a few days later, so I forgot to coat with oil.  It didn't seem to matter, and I had no problems with sticking.  They were gone fast - I just wish I had a bigger microwave so I could make more at a time!

These chips were fantastic! I used cooking spray instead of oil and lightly sprinkled them with garlic salt. They were a huge hit, my husband couldn't get enough!

I too was skeptical, but after reading others reviews I lined my plate with parchment, gave it a quick shot of cooking spray, arranged my thin potato slices ..another quick spray and crossed my fingers. These are terrific!

These were pretty darn good although I also had problems with them sticking to the plate and I used LOTS of oil ~ I'll try Pam next time. I had mine with seasoned salt and some with Cajun seasoning. The boys had theirs with salt and they LOVED them!

These are great!  I think the reason everyone is cooking longer is because it's hard to get them quite thin enough. These are a great lower fat option to store bought. Remind me of Tim's Cascade chips here in Washington.

Crispy and tasty, but had trouble with them sticking to the plate - even though it was well oiled. Perhaps I should have sprayed it with Pam.

these are amazing. recipes like this should be illegal bc theyre so easy to make. I didnt think theyd come out nearly as good as they did, almost better than actually deep-frying because they cook slower and you have less chance of burning them. I seasoned mine with salt, cayenne and onion powder.

The microwave is quick, but the plate we use seems to cause us some potato-sticking-to-it problems even though we greased it.  Instead, we used the meat slicer to cut them less than 1/16" thick, mix them with a small amount of vegetable oil, spread them singularly on a greased cookie sheet, seasoned, and baked in the oven at 375 degrees F (convection) for between 15-20 minutes.

I tried different types of potatoes, followed the recipe. White potatoes were the best as far as consistency. In the long run I prefer to deep fry or buy some Lays. Tasted ok but I didn't like the texture.

Not a good recipe. Very hazardous. In my experience of first making them, my microwave caught on fire. When I snapped a chip in half to see what it looked like, it was CHARCOAL. This is my experience making these "microwave chips" and I will certainly not again. If I do, then with EXTREME caution.

Good stuff, but way too much work.  I cooked in a small 800 watt microwave on high and they still took 11 minutes a batch. I'll stick with my $1 bag of chips when I get the craving.

This is a good one, i tried it and the best thing is that amount of oil and salt that needed can be adjusted to your need. there was a problem my microwave was a bit weak so i have to cook it for 16 minutes instead of 5 min!

My fiancé and I were a bit skeptical, but tried this recipe anyway. On our first batch, we had the mandolin set on the thinest setting and they came out tasting like store bought potato chips...we couldn't believe it! Second batch used setting three and they came out good, but just a bit burnt tasting, because they had to cook longer to get brown. Used the second setting on the mandolin and I guess third time was the charm, absolutely perfect. You have to keep an eye on them as they are cooking, the times very depending on how long they sit in the oil before cooking.

I should have read the reviews and looked closely at the photos first. :) I took the instructions literally and sliced the potato "paper-thin", which was really too thin. My first batch burned and stuck to the plate. You need to just make it thin, not paper-thin. Other than that, a nice recipe and versatile too.

These are dangerously delicious! So easy to make, but thankfully you can only make one plate at a time. If I had a whole bag of these chips, they'd disappear!

For health reasons, I don't buy potato chips. Yesterday I was craving something crunchy and potato-ey and decided to give these a try. Based on other reviews, here is what I did:
-Did not cut potato slices too thin.
-Dipped potato slices in olive oil to ensure complete coverage, then placed on plate (would have tried parchment paper, but didn't have any)
-Microwaved in bursts of 2-3 mins at a time
-watched for browning

Some chips were browned more than others, and it turns out that when the centre of the chips begin to brown, they're done.

These aren't ever going to rival "bagged" or baked potato chips, nor is this recipe well-suited to making more than one serving, but they'll hit the spot when an occasional craving hits.

Just can't believe how good these are. The only problem is that you can't make that many at a time since you are limited to just one level of potato slices. A multi-level plate contraption would be great here!

Tried this today and we loved it! I thought I would have to invest in a mandolin but it was so easy to use a potato peeler and peel it lengthwise. We took the advice of another reviewer and used cooking spray on both sides. It took 3 1/2 minutes. Easy-peasy.

TOO GOOD! Truth to be told, I was actually pretty mad when these came out burned after 7 mins, but after 2 more tries, I used like 4 mins and it came out perfect! Can't wait to ask my friends what they think of it, and I'm not even old enough to cook, I learned to bake myself, and I made my own account only to save liked recipes, lol, I'm no older then 13!

These are good. I cut mine with a knife since I couldn't find the mandolin. I used one of my regular fiesta ware plates and didn't have any problems with sticking at all. Mine all took about 4 1/2 mins with each batch decreasing a bit. We loved them all nice and crunchy and puts a nice twist on a plain sandwich and chips lunch.

I tried this recipe because I thought it was so cool yo be able to make potato chips in the microwave. I did not have parchment paper so I used a microwave safe plate. I also did not have that speacially fantastic food slicer that was in the video. Therefore I sliced my potatos by hand (did not turn out too good). When I took my multiple shaped potatos out of the microwave. They were only crisp where they were deep brown. The deep brown parts tasted burnt. I can't say that this is not a good way to make homemade potato chips but I would say a slicer and parchment paper are NOT optional.

These are really good! When making these, make sure the paper thin strips of potato are not touching, otherwise they will not be crisp.  As some reviewers suggested I also used parchment paper so clean up was easy.

I saw it, I doubted it, so I tried it. WOW who would have thought you could get a crisp tasty chip out of the microwave. If you are looking for a homemade chip recipe, try this, it's worth it. Only problem I have is not eating them as fast as they come out. I used parchment paper on the glass turn table in my microwave & had no problems with sticking.

Tried it as soon as I read it. used parchment on big plate, sprayed parchment with olive oil in a spray can, then a spray on top of the chips. 
FANTASTIC! I've tried microwave chips before with "blah" results, but Jessica hit a grand slam with her simple recipe.

I've been making potato chips like this for a long time now and I've discovered if you soak the potato slices in cool water for a few minutes they cook a lot better in the microwave.  The starch comes out but you need to dry them before cooking.  I just lay them on the turntable in the microwave after rubbing the turntable with a little oil.  No oil on the potatoes; just sea salt.

Try using sweet potatoes sometime.  They are delicious too.

To die for..just made and ate the whole batch..one suggestion is that you blot the potatoes with paper towel after slicing them since they seem to be too wet before oiling.  Good thing it takes so long to make..portion control for my addiction. Expatgal

Lotta work for a few chips that really aren't as good as commercially produced chips unless you get your cooking method perfectly dialed. Gotta be SUPER attentive to the process. If you let them cook even five or ten seconds too long, they're shot. Not worth the effort.

Very good! It takes care of the crunch munchy! Im trying popcorn seasonings now. Cheddar,parmesan and ranch! Slice ahead but keep covered in water. You want the slices just browned - not too much or they will taste burnt.Thinner the better.Dont press when slicing- just graze the slicer.

Super simple, very good.  A little time consuming though, and tough to keep up with demand.  i.e. we were eating them as quick as I could make them.  Did them on parchment, much less greasy and easy cleanup.

These are really good! I added molasses bacon spice as seasoning and omg it tasted amazing. The only thing that bothered me was the oil. Mabey i'm putting too much on the plate but it would make the edges of some of the chips kind of soft instead of crunchy.

I just made these and they are awesome!  Sliced potatoes very thin with a madolin, sprayed with Pam and put on parchment paper.  These didn't take but about 3 minutes.  Watch your first batches, and as soon as they start to brown they are done.  My kids couldn't believe they were cooked in the microwave.

This recipe actually does make pretty good potato chips :) The only thing I didn't like was that it took us forever to make enough chips for everybody. This method is probably best for those late night cravings for one or two people.

So good. Followed recipe but also took suggestion to cook a little longer and they were very crisp. Will definitely make again.

These chips were a breeze to make and great to eat!  We ate them warm, right out of the microwave without any seasoning and they were really good.  My 12 year old makes these up for a quick afternoon snack.

I could not share these and ate them all by myself!! I had to use my food processor so they were thicker and took 10-13 min to cook. The 2nd night I made them I used a large glass plate and didn't wait for it to cool before I put the next batch of potatoes on and, well, stupid me, cracked the plate. So be careful. But they were so good with homemade spinach onion dip. Yum!!!

Absolutely terrific. Very time consuming if you're trying to make a fair sized batch. The proper amount of salt is found via trial and error. Well worth the trouble.

Perfect snack. I used Pam to spray the plate, sliced potato with knife and followed the recipe as stated. I cooked on high 4 to 5 minutes per plate.  No sticking problems for me.  Next time I will not use the bag and oil and try spraying plate and potatoes with Pam like other reviewers.  My son and husband loved.  They were gone in a flash.

Used a teaspoon of evoo in a baggie, then some sea salt. spread single layer directly on glass microwave plate (ungreased) and cooked on high 6 minutes until they started to turn golden brown. What a treat.

Great easy recipe. I wonder if the type of potato dictates the length it requires to be 'cooked'? I woould suspect that a 'firm' potato (Such as an Idaho) would be better than a 'soft' potato (Such as a Yukon Gold).

Maybe it's because I used the Pam cooking spray but my seasonings wouldn't stick after I took them off the plate. Other than that, these were wonderful and easy! Can't wait to show my 6 year old!!!

There are a few ways to make or break this recipe.  You must really be committed to make this one. 

1) You need really thin even slices of potatoes.  If you cut at an angle and have a thicker bottom than top that section will not crisp.
2) You must have a consistent microwave.  Each plate full varied cook time in my microwave (7-9 min!) so I had to watch it the last 3 min very carefully.

Pro -You can season this in many different ways to vary with whatever meal you like.
- It's a cheap side.

Con - They tend to stick on the plate.
Con - Time! This took way too long for the amount you make. I might make again when I'm limited on groceries, but it will not be one of those things I make regularly.

P.S. I used these in nachos.  It was tasty.

It took a good deal longer in my microwave & I added salt & pepper to them after oil...but mmm mmm good! So easy to have as a little extra side to a meal! (We had one potato left last night & it was the perfect FILLER as a 4th item on the dinner menu!).

I made this last night and it was more trouble than it was worth.  While it did crisp the potatoes, the flavor was lacking in taste.  If I had to make them for a family dinner, it would take forever.  For as often as I make potato chips, give me the deep fry method.  
I would not bother making them again.

These were delicious. The only reason I give them four stars instead of five is because it takes a while to make a good amount of them (unless you're just making them for yourself). That's a lot of running the microwave to make enough for the whole family! They were delicious, though, and fun to eat for a special change. Thanks for the idea!

I was compelled to try this recipe, mostly because I couldn't believe that great tasting potato chips in the microwave were even remotely possible.  These chips are great, and I feel good about eating these as an 'indulgence'.  Thanks for a great idea and recipe.  It's a keeper!

I think these were fantastic !  A tasty, quick and easy way to have chips without all of the additions of chemicals from commercial products.  Watch them carefully, and do not overlap them; season with different herbs and your guests will think you a genius ! Using a spray atomizer makes things easy, and you can control the amt of oil better. I tried putting oil in a baggie as another reviewer suggested, and that just left them way too oily and way to messy.

I use the cooking spray and parchment paper version and wow, it really worked well and the chips for a lovely brown with great crisp. I did use a mandolin to slice with.  I wouldn't have belived it possible if I hadn't tried it myself.  Now we have a fun, tasty quick snack.

These were...okay. VERY easy to make which is great. I had a hard time determining the length to cook them. I burnt quite a few of them. lol 
Definitely not a recipe you want to make for a large group, as they do take some time to make them.

I have been making these for years... without the oil. And I don't use a plate, I use parchment paper on the turntable. Makes it easier on the fingers removing from the oven. So before I cook, I do the seasonings, as the potatoes are slightly damp and everything sticks. They cook for about 3 minutes, sometimes longer depending on the thickness. You can't overlap or they will become soggy where they touch. Sometimes I'd have to remove some that were done before the rest were finished. Maybe cooking with the oil will eliminate that issue. I'm going to try the olive oil, lime & Kool Aid recipe... it made my cheeks hurt just reading about it, so it must be good!

FANTASTIC!! Better than ones made in oven. I used Mrs. Dash seasoning to avoid sodium. Will make again & again & again :) Had a good result of potatoes in home garden so using really fresh ones.

Made this as a nighttime snack for myself. Only used 3 small potatoes. They were difficult to cut but they sure tasty! And they have to be better than any store bought chips with god knows what in them. Boyfriend didn't believe chips could be made in a microwave hehehe.

OH My Word these are awesome! I've made them plain, sea salted, with pepper, used olive oil, and even sweet potatoes! They are great! use the slicer on a cheese grater! I needed more oil than 1 tbs but I use spray now. Excellent way to get a snack without going overboard!

These taste like potato chips the way Pringles taste like potato chips. It's an entirely different product really. These are not like fried, bagged chips at all. I sliced the potatoes with a mandolin and they crisped beautifully in my microwave in 6 minutes. Hubby ate them but I wasn't impressed. Bland bland bland.

Turned out delicious but needed a LOT longer than 3-5 minutes in my microwave...try 15-20! And it's a new microwave. Maybe next time I'll try making these in the oven instead.
Used a mandoline slicer to make the slices extra thin, worked like a charm!

This is a great quick munchy snack for my kids and I. I'm glad I tried it! I used my Pampered Chef mandolin and sprayed the plate and pototoes lightly with cooking spray. Cooking time for my microwave was longer than recipe stated and I also flipped over towards the end. I recommended this recipe to my teens/preteen children for when they get hungary for a snack and I am not at home.

The chips didn't turn out so well for us.  If they weren't eaten quickly they got really hard.  Won't be making these again.  Thanks anyway.

I wish I had a stronger microwave as I'm sure my puny little one didn't do justice to your recipe (I rarely use micros).  I used a mandoline (lovely) and sliced paper thin (2mm) which took all of 15 seconds, but after cooking for 9 minutes, they were just beginning to brown.  Turned out a bit chewy and greasy, but again ... I believe that was due to my microwave.  Will try again with stronger microwave when we go camping next week.

These are great!  I noticed that there were a lot of complaints on not being able to make enough.. I think that's my only downfall with it as well.  I tried a paper towel trick, but it did not work, it really steamed them more than anything else.  If I figure anything else out, I will post it, of course!  
Also, if you want to make thicker chips out of these, be prepared to have a very sore jaw!  They come out too chewy to make thick chips out of!  
About 3 1/2 minutes worked best for me in my microwave. My husband and daughter agreed that these were very good chips!  My husband said they were better then lays potato chips!  
As a last note, in order to keep my chips from getting that icky brown look to them, I soaked them in cold water while the others were cooking.  As a result of this, I would dry them off real quick on paper towels and use a paper plate, not a dinner plate.  If I used the dinner plate when I soaked them in water, they would stick to the plate.  Next thing I did was seasoned them before they cooked.. that way the salt or whatever I used to season them would stick better to the chips!  I also used the trick of just using spray oils.. less mess means less to clean up!

I couldn't believe this actually worked, but it did!  My microwave takes WAY longer, but that's to be expected.  I tried them with regular salt & seasoned salt -- both ways were great.  I can't wait to try other "flavors"!

These are so easy and so good I make them all the time. I also took some to weight watchers and everyone went wild over them.  I didn't use the oil instead I prayed the microwave dish with pam spray and also sprayed the potato slices before microwaving. Thank you so much for this recipe I can now eat potato chips on weight watchers and feel good about it.

The cooking time took longer than I thought. The chips turned out to be golden at the end, but it took me a very long time in the microwave to cook them. Most of my potato slices clumped together because I used a grater and the pieces were small. The chips were interesting texture.. I did almost really seriously injure myself when I cut my finger with the slicer. That's why I chose to  use the grater the second time I tried to slice the potato.

Amazing.  I cant believe how well these came out.  First batch I never oiled the plate and found they stuck.  Second batch I oiled the plate well but still had a bit of an issue with them sticking.  Next time I will try the baking paper.  And there will be a next time.

These are so yummy! My first batch were a lil bitter bc i over cooked them but once i kept my eyes on them, they came out so good and crispy. I made some for my hubby's lunch and he said his friends at work loved them and couldn't believe it was microwaved. I used butter spray to coat the plate and veggie oil to coat the potatoes. No problem with them sticking at all :)

These were great.  I substituted cooking spray for oil to make a lighter version, and I tossed them in a little bit of malt vinegar.

Very easy and they turned out perfect. I kept using the same plate after each batch leaving the olive oil on it from the previous batch. Then added a new layer of slices and topped them with a little more olive oil. A great way to use up potatoes that are getting a little soft. (Definitely use a mandolin).

This is by far the best way to make chip! I usually make Taro chips this way, and yes, it takes a while, but they are always delicious! Peel your Taro root, then slice into thin pieces (using a mandolin is best), then place the pieces on the lightly oiled plate (no need to oil the pieces themselves) and microwave for about 4 minutes (for a full plate) less for a not-full plate. Don't be scared to let them get some colour, just don't let them char. I have had success with this many times.  Thanks!

I would give this 5 stars the way I make it which is to spray the plate with cooking spray, spread out the potato slices, sprinkle with salt and then spray with cooking spray again. A tablespoon of oil is overkill. Five minutes worked for me perfectly.

Despite the good reviews, I had my doubts about this recipe....I was pleasantly surprised.  I used a potato peeler to make the slices very thin, and sprayed the plate and potatoes with butter flavored cooking spray before I placed in the microwave.  They really came out liked the potato chips in the store!  My only complaint is that they shrink so much that you can't make them fast enough.

Used a mandolin on the thinnest setting, I could see through the slices. They still turned out to need closer to 10 min. cooking time & still never got truly crisp. I'll stick to deep frying mine thanks!!

WOW! I was told that these were better than store bought!! My family loved them. Made them with white potatoes and sweet potatoes! Healthy snack in comparison to bagged chips!! Amazing idea that they would come out of a microwave crunchy and curled like kettle chips. I used the wide blade of a tall cheese shredder, it was quick and delicious. Thanks for the interesting recipe!

This is the easiest recipe ever and the chips ARE super crunchy just like everyone says!!  Try it out with different types of potatoes, oils and salts. Play around with the time on the microwave until you find the one that gives the perfect amount of crunchiness.

I followed all of the directions. I chose to use Yukon Gold Potatoes. Before putting them on the plate, i sprayed some pam. When they were done (after about 7 minutes in the microwave) , i added my desired amount of salt. Then I added some melted butter on top. Taste pretty good with ketchup, too. YUM!Will make again. My brother said "theyre good" and wanted me to make more!

My family LOVES these chips! (I have a junk-food-picky husband and young daughters- ages 8, 6 and 3) We use: Red Potatoes, Olive Oil, Garlic Salt Also, instead of oiling the potatoes in a bag, it's much easier to put them in a bowl, drizzle a little oil, and hand-toss.

Very good. Made them for my kids tonight (to sneak in a veggie) and they ate them up & asked for more. I'm not going to lie, I ate a few while the 2nd plate was in the microwave ;-)  As stated earlier by someone else, it is very convenient if you get a craving for chips. And potatoes are cheap so we always have some on hand. I'll definately be making these again....and again!

I am just like most people that reviewed. I am amazed that potato chips can be done in the microwave! I made two batches of these the other night and used my mandolin slicer (on thin). Sprayed my plate with butter flavored pam and off into the microwave they went. I will say I do have a strong microwave and it took quite a bit longer to cook these than the time stated. They turned out well. The second time they turned out better since I was afraid of burning them the first time.

I tried making these in the oven to maybe save on time but it was a flop...I thought they turned out very good in the Microwave thou just a little time consuming.

These are sooo good! They remind me of kettle cooked chips. So easy to make but if you want a good batch it takes a bit of time! Mine wanted to stick to the plate a little bit so I might try parchment paper next time.

Amazing!  Took mine exactly 10 mins to crisp up.  I had a lot of trouble with the chips sticking to the plate.  Probably because I didn't drench them in oil.  I only lightly greased the plate with olive oil and sprinkled the chips with salt and cayenne pepper.  Will use another reviewer's recommendation with using parchment paper.

I was skeptical when I read this recipe. I read all of the rave review and thought I would give it a try. I’m sure glad I did! I was so amazed at how well they turned out I haven’t been able to stop bragging about them. Try them and you’ll see.

Very crispy but it took a long time to make as you only make small batches at a time.  Results are delicious though - similar to the crunch of Miss Vickies chips.

What a fun, easy, successful recipe.  I lightly oil-sprayed parchment, set the slices, then lightly sprayed the slice tops.  Did't bother with the added Ziploc step or the plate.  Reuse the parchment with each batch but no need to respray the paper.  Just continue spraying the slice tops. If you have Bacon Salt try sprinkling on the finished product.  Makes a tasty BBQ flavored chip!

These came out GREAT! I used the custom recipe from Bobbi which calls for Pam cooking spray instead of oil. I didn't use parchment paper, just sprayed the plate w/Pam. Depending on how thin the slices were, they took anywhere from 3-1/2 to 8 minutes to cook. I cooked them until they turned brown, and they got very crispy. Thanks for the great recipe, Jessica!

Excellent recipe,  we sliced them thin on a deli/meat slicer, coated the slices with olive oil, lightly salted and placed them on parchment on our microwave plate and cooked them for about 10 min. Warning these are addictive and you can't eat just one!

Thank you for this recipe!!! I will be sure to share this with my family on facebook!  I took a spray bottle and sprayed malt vinegar with some sea salt to make my own version of salt and vinegar.  You apply this after the chips are cooked.  I have a fairly new microwave and it took more like 7 minutes for mine to be cooked.

To be honest, I was afraid of doing this. I was very skeptical about this working...but boy did this prove me wrong!! These are so good and oh so easy. I seasoned mine with salt and a bit of fresh cracked pepper. I also just sprayed them with pam and placed them on parchment paper and then covered them with another piece of parchment to ensure even cooking.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

This was an excellent recipe.  I was a bit skeptical at first.  The first batch I forgot to spray cooking spray on the plate and they stuck on.  The rest were fantastic.  My boyfriend didn't like them as he said they were too crunchy but I thought they were perfect.  Way better for you than packaged potato chips.  Next time I will try cooking spray on them in stead of oil and even perhaps popcorn seasoning to make them flavoured.

i didnt know this was possible! every time i make them i add different seasonings and they always turn out great! i love them cause they are perfect for an individual snack...to make them for a group of people is kinda a pain (they take so long and everybody eats them as they come out of the microwave).

These were easy to make and great tasting. I used PAM olive oil spray, onion powder and some sea salt the first time I made them. The second time, after a big dinner, I had a lot of left over baked potatoes.  I sliced them thin when they were cold and followed the recipe.  They were delicious too.  I will continue to make them both ways.  Much better than store bought and healthier.

I tried other suggestions and used parchment paper on top of my microwave's turntable and used spray oil.  I used my mandolin's thinnest setting and the chips took 4 minutes to cook.  After the first few tries I went ahead and salted the chips on top of spraying oil on them prior to cooking instead of adding salt afterwards.  It seemed to work better.  Over all 2 out of 3 kids loved them.  The other was turned off by the brown color that regular chips don't have to obtain the crispy factor.

How is it that these are so good, yet the vast majority of the world doesn't know this is possible? These are my new favorite snack when I have a salty craving, and they're much healthier than regular chips.    Now, I don't add oil to the potatoes, and they do just fine.  Just use cooking spray on the plate and you're good to go!

Amazing!! I sprayed my plate with PAM placed the chips and then sprayed them again with PAM. They turned out like Kettle chips. I sprinkled sea salt and onion powder on them. I will make these with my next sandwich.....I love them!!

Easy to do.  I used parchment paper & garlic cooking spray.  Took about 8-9.5 min. in 900 watt oven.  I had to move some from the middle to outside to keep from getting too brown.  My microwave is old and may have contributed to the uneven browning.  But they were very good!

Pretty neat!  Of course, they're eaten just as soon as they come out of the microwave!  They do take a little longer than 3-5 minutes, but who cares?  This was fun to do.  We sliced our second batch slightly thicker - those were better yet!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Who'd of thought? Though they turned out crispy and wonderful, it was a bit time consuming if your making them for a crowd. Otherwise, great for a quick solo snack.

Very good...very easy....much healthier option. My 2 year old and I loved them! Used parchment paper as others recommended, this kept clean up simple and I could remove the chips from the microwave without touching the hot plate.

WHAT a SUPRISE to try this and was TERRIFIC!!!  I used parchment paper on large round plate and coated the paper with a small amount of oil.  Placed paper thin potatoe slices on and then seasoned with Jonny's.  I cooked them for 5 to 6 min. and WOW!! they were crisp and REALLLLY good.  Have made them for several of my friends and they were suprised too, that they came out of a microwave. Can't wait to try this with sweet potatoes.  THANK YOU for a GREAT recipe.

WOW! I used a red potato sliced to 1/8" on a mandoline.  I sprayed the plate with Pam and salted well.  Four minutes was plenty of time.  I used a Pfaltzgraff stoneware platter in the microwave. I never trust anything made in the microwave, but I needed a chip fix and we were out!  These are amazing!

I used a Pampered Chef mandoline and they seemed a bit thick so I increased the cooking time to 12 minutes.  I worried that they would burn but the extra time crisped them perfectly.  I sprayed the plate with Pam before I spread of the slices and them sprinkled them with fine sea salt and let them cool completely (they were a bit chewy when warm).  Thanks for a great recipe!

WOW! These were great! As with any recipe you make it your own, well for these I just used pam and sprayed the plate before, then layered on the potato and gave it another spray.I would also sprinkle on a little salt before I put it in the microwave, or right after the came out so the salt would stick. SO YUMMY!

Fantastic! Borrowing from others, I used parchment paper and olive oil spray. My wimpy microwave needed 7 minutes each batch, but it was well worth the wait.

After reading so many reviews, I had to give them a try.  First I would use larger sized potatoes as they tend to shrink during the browning process.  Other than that they were good.  A fun fast treat for one or two, but I have been spending the last hour cooking them and see how it can be a bit daunting.  Try them with cajun spice and add the seasonings BEFORE cooking.  they taste much better as the flavors have time to blend.  Overall a healthy, fun idea!!

WOW is all I can say, I was looking for a way to make homemade potato chips, I never thought about using the microwave.  It was so easy I got right up and tried them, took me about two mins prep and 7 mins cooking.  They were gone in one min.  My husband is making more right now.  GREAT RECIPE.

Ummmmm wow this is amazing.  I had a whole bag of potatoes sitting in garage starting to grow sprouts, I hate wasting food so I found this recipe and boy is it delicious.  I microwave mine for exxactly 5 1/2 mintues on high.  I cut the potatoes very thin and coated them in a generous supply of olive oil and lime juice mixed together dipping them in the bowl and coating the front and back of potato.  Then I layed them on a pyrex dish making sure that they were not overlapping.  When finished I gave them a generous dose of salt and some cajun style seasoning.  Whole family loved, hubby, me and dogs who were trying to kill eachother to get more.:)

I honestly do not know where these have been all my life.  If you have a hankering for some chips, this is your ticket!!  The only choice to make is what to season them with.  I went with salt, cayenne, garlic powder and old bay...I like some flavor and heat.  Absolutely phenomenal recipe.  For my wave, 6 1/2 minutes was perfect.  Make sure to not overlap the chips as well.

I am always skeptical about microwave recipes, but I was hungry and had unused potatoes. So I gave it a try. I just sprayed a pan, laid out the potato slivers and then sprayed again with pam. The easiest way to make the potato chips if you don't have the mandilin, then use a peeler. Takes a little practice, but works perfectly fine. I seasoned with a little lemon pepper, salt, and cajun seasoning...yummy.

It was too bad. This came out much better than I thought it would. My husband was suprised I made them in the nuker. But it was alot of work. Having to watch them and having to do so many batches. I stopped when the house started to smell odd, and my hubbie said it was due to not having enough "stuff" in the nuker. i think the oven or the fryer is the best bet though.

This is amazing...I had no idea you could make potato chips in the microwave.  Chips need significantly longer to cook in the microwave than recipe states (mine took between 8-10 minutes).  All in all this recipe ROCKS!

Needed a snack for a rainy Sunday afternoon,& gave this a try. So easy & sooo good! Used a slicer, Pam Spray, & a microwave/bake dish.  Took 6 minutes per potatoe in my 1200 watt micro. Used salt, then garlic powder on later batches. A great snack & I will definetely be doing this again! Thanks for the great recipe.Update after sharing:Was told this is what to bring to our next get-together & they want to try different spices/seasonings. A grand-slam hit all the way around!

I enjoyed making my own chips. Very easy. I made sure my microwave setting was on high so it didn't take so long.

I too was skeptical at first and just had to try it ... wow! I can't wait to share this with my husband and kiddies. I used parchment paper right on top of the turntable dish of the microwave.  Just keep an eye, because once they start browning it doesn't take to much longer.  Thank you for a simple and tasty treat!

I made these & they were great.  A few notes: I sliced my potato with a knife.  Would have been more consistent, obviously, with a little slicer.  Also, maybe because mine were a little thicker, it took approx 7 minutes to cook.  They WILL start to turn brown when ready. Also, I found that mine stuck to the plate so with my 3rd batch, I sprayed the plate with Pam. This worked perfectly. I used a butter knife to remove from the plates.  Who knew you could make potato chips in the microwave??

OMG, what a great recipe! And so simple too. After purchasing a mandoline the other day, I went searching for a recipe to try it out. I took the suggestions about the parchment paper and used the setting just under 1/8" for crinkle cut. I used a paper towel to dry the slices and sprayed the paper with PAM, laid out the slices, and sprayed again, then added some salt and garlic powder(I like garlic chips). After about 7 minutes I took them from the microwave as they started to brown as others recommended, but they didn't crisp up after a few minutes(the front was crisp but the side next to the paper was a little soggy, so I turned them over and put them back in for another 3 minutes. They came out perfect!! I will definitely make these again.

**UPDATE** My husband suggested using the microwave plate we use for bacon(the kind with raised ridges),and the chips really came out well. It is probably because they were able to crisp underneath due to the raised surface. I did about 9 1/2 minutes in the microwave to get the right consistency, but I am sure it will vary.

I gave this a try last night to compliment some hoagies. I used a potato peeler as I don't have a mandoline. I made 2 platefuls in the microwave, which didn't really yield enough chips for dinner. But it wasn't worth it, prep was just too much for the product.

I'm giving these a 5 star because I can see the potential.  I think if I would have had a mandoline and used parchment paper they would have been a definitely three star.  Instead, I cut them by hand and used a cheese slicer and I just didn't get them thin enough.  And they took FOREVER to cook, even though some were paper thin I think they cooked for at least 10 minutes.  My dh burned the heck out of his hand because the plate was so hot after the second batch.  But they were really good, and if I ever buy a mandoline, I'll make them again for sure.

This is my first review - I look for recipes, but never commented until now.  How easy are these chips?!!  Like another reviewer, I put parchment paper right on the turntable in my microwave, sprayed them with olive oil spray, cooked for 5 to 7 minutes (have to watch them near the end) then spritzed once more with a tad more oil and sprinkled some with salt, some with cajun seasoning (if you like spice!) and one large potato made a huge mound!  It fed my family of 3 to go with our hot dogs.  I had to cook them in 4 batches, but you can make them ahead and let them sit on a cookie sheet until you need them.  I sliced them on a mandolin to less than 1/8".  Very potato-y tasting and healthy option for potato chip fans.

My 4 kids absolutely "potato chips" for dinner.  These are a million times better than my oven variety because of the crispieness.  All the kids and hubby love them as do I.  The great part is you can make them as salty of flavorful as you want.  Great for an evening TV snack too!!!  Thank you for this.  I actually got it out of my Allrecipes cookbook and had to come on line to rate it!

i never ever would have thought i could make potato chips in the microwave! i was skeptical, but tried this recipe anyways - amazing! i admit, i burned a few batches, but the ones that worked tasted great! i put a piece of wax paper directly on the microwave turntable, sprayed with olive oil cooking spray, put down a single layer of potato, then sprayed again- i cannot say enough about how good these are! will definitely make again!

This recipe is a curse! I don't need to be eating these. So yummy. And easy. I didn't have any kind of slicer other than the knife in my hand and they turned out good. Definately use wax paper on the plate. Made some with garlic powder and parmesean and some with dill on them. Yum!

We love this idea!  I don't have a fancy slicer, so had to do them by hand, but loved them so much that I've now decided to invest in one!  Thanks for the great recipe, can't wait to try out some different seasonings.

These potato chips are GREAT!!  I don't know whether to thank-you or what.  I guess all the hard work I have done at the gym just went down the tubes. I can't wait to get in the kitchen and make another batch. On a rating of 5 stars I give it 6.  I used the olive oil spray and sprayed the plate and then the potatoes.  Couldn't be easier..

The kids love these.  You really have to keep a close eye on these potatoes as they're cooking so they don't burn.  Cooking time VARIES with EACH batch.  But these are great to make for the kids lunch.

More a comment than a review - I bought a plastic stand (from a shrift shop) some years ago and tried this - the stand burned before the potato chips were cooked.
I tried this (similar) recipe today, and the result again disaster.
Some 'chips' burned, some boiled, and not one turned crisp-and-brown.
OK - this is an 1100watt microwave (fairly powerful, I think), and the potatoes, alas, cannot be described accurately, as here we get 'red', 'white', 'washed', and that's about it. We still have a long way to go get sellers to tell us what potatoes these actually are - "They're spuds, mate, whaddya think they are?".
Is it the kind of potato, perhaps?. Certainly I am going to stick with the supermarket "Smith's chips", made in Australia under license from Pepsico, until further notice.

but to all college students out there like me...do NOT use a plastic plate (and i suppose the same goes for paper). use ceramic. or else you could start a fire in your microwave like i did an hour ago :)

seasoned with Chipotle seasoning.  Sprayed plate with Pam.  Used Smart Balance oil in bag w/ seasoning added to bag.  Microwaved for 6-7 minutes.  Chips will brown and get curly along the edges.

OK, I’ll happily join the ranks of the skeptical who have been convinced. These were really great!  I used red potatoes, a grater and a peeler (tried both), olive oil, and a glass dish sprayed with PAM.  It took exactly 5 minutes in my 1,000W microwave.  I just tossed the slices in a bowl with the olive oil and then spread them on the platter to cook.  Yes, it does take a while to make a few chips, but the Gee-Whiz factor (and the taste!) makes it worth it!  I guess the microwave heats the oil and the hot oil fries the chips – that’s why they’re crispy.  Try it!

These taste great! I would have given 5 stars if they wouldn't have stuck to the plate (even after loads of oil). Next time i'll try parchment paper...

I used a regular peeler knife to make really thin slices. However, using a ceramic dish caused the chips to really stick even though I used loads of oil. I'll be trying to use some baking parchment next time, as someone suggested. The taste and crispiness (is that a word?) is absolutely perfectamundo, but only four stars because of the stickiness.

EDIT: Tried the parchment. Avoided sticking but I don't think the chips became as crispy. Good anyway.

This is so cool!  I can't believe that they taste like regular potato chips!  I even tried them with purple potatoes, my MIL always dumps a batch on me every year and I never know what to do with them.  It's hard to tell when the purple ones are done as they don't turn brown but I used the same time I did for my batch of regular potatoes.  I sprayed my dish with Pam liberally and had no problems with sticking.  I did have a few overlap though and they stuck together.  I also tried with just olive oil spray instead of regular oil and they worked, but not as tasty.  If I had a Pampered Chef oil sprayer I would do it that way next time, much easier than putting them in a bag.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made these chips using sweet potatoes and they were great! My husband loves to go to Cheeseburger In Paradise to eat their sweet potato chips and said these were just as good. I will definately make these again but try them in the oven for consistant browning. Thanks!

These chips are amazing, the first time I did them, they softened up.  This time I made them, I made sure they were really golden brown before I took them out.  And now we are having them for dinner. Good recipe!!!

These were just ok. I cooked in peanut oil.  I should have known, anything cooked in a microwave would come out kind of like rubber.  These may be better if baked in the oven.  I won't make again, much easier to just buy in the store and they taste great.

These were OK.  Maybe my microwave isn't powerful enough, cause they took a long time to get brown.  I think I will just buy them at the store, it is easier.

These are yummy, but not worth the time and effort for me.  I also found that the chip stuck to the plate even though I brushed it with oil.  I also tried wax paper but they stuck to that as well.

Great recipe! I made these along with the Spinach Artichoke Dip from this site. The dip is a little thick, so these chips went great with them, no breaking! Next time I will try the suggestion to use parchment paper & cooking spray. Thanks again! :)

I didn’t think that these would turn out but they turned out to be very good!
They taste like Kettle brand baked potato chips.  I cooked them on parchment paper as was suggested by other users and they slid off with ease.  
Note; Don’t let them get to dark.

Well, Jessica, I don't know whether to thank you or curse you! These are amazingly easy and WAY better than store bought chips. Which means I can now satisfy my crunchy/salty carb cravings whenever they strike; not necessarily a good thing for my waistline.=^(

Delicious!  Taste just like store bought chips!  To season the chips, I added 1 tsp salt and 1 1/2 TBS vinegar with the vegetable oil then added the potato slices and shook to coat.  Also, next time I am going to try adding 1 TBS ketchup and 1 tsp of hot sauce with the vegetable oil.

It took my microwave 11-12mins to make them. First batch I did my family devoured them!! I couldn’t get the salt on fast enough!!! I brushed a light coating of olive oil on each piece because I can NEVER coat anything evenly in a bag, LOL!!! I will be making this recipe again.

I think they turned Out great. They came out a little browner than I expected, but then again I did make the potatoes thick so I had to bake them for longer. Overall a quick and easy snack.

I used a big Russet potato and since I know they have the most starch, I sliced with a mandoline and soaked them all in cold water.  For each batch, I pulled some out, dried them with paper towels and laid them out on parchment paper. Sprayed them with olive oil from a spray bottle, then applied sea salt.  Tried the garlic powder on a few batches but went back to the sea salt.  Not a bit of sticking, due to the cold water soak. Each batch took just 5 minutes in the microwave.

When i made this, i found that depending on how many and the size, you need to adjust the cook time or it will burn. Other than that, delicious!! Im under 15 and it was super quick and easy to make

SHOCKING!!! I can’t believe I just made potato chips in the microwave!!! They turned out exactly as the recipe claimed; crispy and yummy chips that are better & healthier than the store. I cut parchment paper to fit onto my microwave turn table because it is bigger than my large plates. Next I sprayed with cooking oil (very lightly). I personally didn’t find the need to pour vegetable oil into a plastic bag to coat the potatoes. Just a light spray, then add salt...and/or pepper...or onion powder...and enjoy! Absolutely delish, however I was scared of burning out my microwave because it cooks a small quantity at a time. My kids and husband couldn’t get enough! Experiment and have fun with adding different flavours! My family thanks you for this recipe! :)

Yummy delicious!  A few of our observations are as follows:  Live at high altitude? Adjust as needed; we needed more cooking time.  (Seriously, what recipe doesn't require high altitude adjustments?)  Super excited to make this but potatoes not quite ripe?  Patience, Iago!  Slightly green raw potatoes come out as slightly green cooked potato chips.  Hungry kid/spouse hovering near by?  Hide the first batch for yourself or these chips will be gone before the last batch is done. even if they are slightly green.

These are fantastic and so easy if you have a mandolin or other tool that will do the slicing quickly.   The first batch came out perfectly after 5 min in the microwave with no sticking to the plate. After the second batch, I started having to pull them out around 4:30 (presumably due to hotter starting conditions of oil/microwave). I also resprayed the plate every 2 batches. I like to mix up the seasonings a bit and use Lawry's seasoning salt as well as some garlic and onion powder for a special kick. I had no problem just adding the seasonings to the oil in the bag and coating the potatoes in the seasoning.

Loved them!  Sad thing I had one more batch to make and my 2 year old microwave died!!!! Not sure what caused it.  Can't wait for a new microwave to try this with sweet potatoes and red beets!

Amazed how good they were!!!

I will make this again. I've been trying to make like this for years with no luck, frying, oven. 
I used our food processor. It makes perfect slices in seconds. 
I waited a little too long to take them out. I wanted them crispy, boy were they. In a microwave, who knew? Next time I'll take them out right after they start to brown. 
Thanks for the recipe, and helpful comments.

3.13.18  I used my mandolin, so I was able to cut the slices paper thin.  The key to this is getting the time right for your microwave, and then it’s super easy.  Cooked my first batch for 4 min 35 secs, but the following batches were done in 4 mins 20 seconds (I’m assuming because the plate already was hot).  This is an easy way to never again pull out a bag of stale chips from the cabinet.  At any rate, sure, this was a novelty, but they really did taste crunchy good.  This worked!

The recipe says that you won't have to keep oiling the plate, but, I had to keep oiling the plate because the first batch stuck to it.  I sprayed EVOO spray on the plate and they still stuck.  I switched to pouring some EVOO onto the plate before placing the potatoes on it.  I used red skin potatoes, maybe I need to use white ones instead because the red ones have more moisture and sugar content.  They took 3 minutes in my microwave which is 1200 watts.  They were good but a lot of work for a little bit of chips.

I make potato chips in my microwave oven all the time, but I skip the step of coating the chips in a  bag of oil. I use my largest plate which is a serving plate. For each batch, I first coat rhe plate with canola oil cooking spray. Then, arrange the potato slices without them touching on the plate . Next, a light coating of cooking spray and a light dusting of salt and pepper. Cooking time is about 5 minutes but gets shorter as the plate heats up.

This works out fairly easily and fun. My only points to stress is that if you want them to cook quickly they really, really mean paper thin slices. My slices where thin but not floppy thin. In my 700 watt microwave it took about 10 minutes. My preference on the taste for the chips was to let them get a little brown but not all the way otherwise it was a bit too burnt tasting. If it feels not fully firm  you just have to let it sit a few minutes. This won't get a full crunch but still yummy.

I will definitely make this awesome and  easy recipe again, however, instead of oiling up my plate, because the chips got stuck on there anyway, I used parchment paper and once they were done, they slid off without a problem. Also, 1 tip:  If you want to get really thin chips every time, use a peeler.

These are outstanding.   I made one large potato and it took a while to cook single layers -- about 6 minutes in my micro.     Totally worth it.  You will never buy store bought again.  Will try a sweet potato next.

I just made these! At first I was doubtful. I didn't look like anything was happening in the microwave. But! They started turning brown all of a sudden, so I took them out. They were PERFECT! I gave one to my brother and I didn't tell him what they were... He said they were amazing! I'm so impressed!!

YUM! This is just as good as (if not better than) regular store bought chips. I loved them. I put a little salt on them and they are good.

I used a piece of parchment right on my microwave turntable and sprayed it just a bit with Pam before laying out the slices, then sprayed the slices a bit too. Salted immediately after they were done. Took about 6 minutes on high. I got 2 batches out of one piece of parchment but the third was too soggy. I sliced them with my mandolin. I can't believe I never have to leave the house for chips again.  Thanks for the recipe!

3-5 minutes must be a 1200 watt MW, because mine is only 700 watts and it took 10 minutes, with my having to flip and move around and remove those already done. Not a quick and easy snack, in my opinion. Bummer. Also, since I don't use plastic, I brushed the chips with olive oil instead of shaking them. Salting after they're done cooking is useless; all the salt ends up on the plate. I'm reduced to dip. Oh, the calories! ;-)

Oh my gosh, these are fantastic! I used the slicer on my food processor and a microwave bacon dish as another reviewer suggested. Sprayed the pan and the potatoes with olive oil Pam . I also salted the chips before cooking. 5 minutes worked perfectly in my microwave. So easy and a healthier option.

These are so great that I bought a mandolin just to make them! The best tip I can give is to put a piece of parchment paper on the microwave plate - SO easy to remove the chips! 
I used olive oil, cooked for 5 minutes, flipped them, and cooked until they started to get brown and crispy - about 2 minutes more. 
So good!

The microwave time took much longer than 3-5 minutes. They ended up being very stale and bland in texture.

Never buy a bag of potato chips again! Think about how much money you save for the exact same product. A bag of 30 potatoes is like five bucks, and a tiny bag of about half a potato is priced at $1.50. Home cooking save you so much money. Thanks for sharing!

First two times not that good.  3rd time is a charm.  I used parchment paper on the bottom and on top.  Hand oiled the potato slices with olive oil.  Very good turn out.  Only problem is it would take a couple hours to make bag of chips.

Great recipe.  I don't have a mandolin, but I cut the potatoes extremely thin.  I used non-stick spray instead of the oil on the chips.  That made them less greasy.  I also used parchment paper to avoid them from sticking.  All in all the recipe is a good one.

Amazing tho. Absolutely amazing. Don't forget to oil the plate you cook on. Or else it sticks and you have to scrape the potato chips off the plate. Whenever you mix it in the bag don't over oil. I went more then the recipe because I thought it was to little, I was wrong. The salt in the recipe is also good. Over all good treat.

I used a kitchen slicer I purchased at Harbor Freight Tools to get the thickness of the chips the same. This made cooking time even. Time will vary with microwaves. I used different toppings like parmesan cheese, garlic salt,  Great with Hamburgers. GET CREATIVE.

I must have sliced my potatoes too thick because it took about 10 minutes for the chips to brown and get crispy.  I did as others and put a sheet of parchment paper on my turntable.  I sprayed the paper and chips  with my olive oil sprayer.  They were delicious.

I had no idea one could make chips in the microwave! Easy, Fast and delicious! Used 1.5mm on my mandolin. The thinner ones were the best. Read others' reviews and used parchment paper instead - no stick. Single layered, sprayed w/butter Pam and lightly sprinkled W/salt. Started at 4 mins; added 1 min for the first batch. As micro heated up, mins reduced - ended the 5th batch at 3 mins. Was able to reuse the parchment throughout even tho it crinkled up. I love that this is healthier than regular chips - and tastes better! Will try other ingredients (pepper, onion powder, etc) now that I know this works. Thank you for sharing this idea!

These went over very well. Grandkids thought it was interesting, taking a cut potato into a chip. Watching it cook and the finished product. Delicious and so easy to make for a quick snack.

I would absolutely make these again as they were delicious! Very easy; adjust microwave times and spices to fit your tastes. Above all, be careful with the mandoline as it will slice you as easily as the potato... :(

I made these yesterday for my boyfriend and our friends. They were so good, I couldn't help making some more today. You do have to keep your eye on the potatoes while they're in the microwave to get the timing right.  I used parchment paper as many people suggested. These are good with lots of salt and chili powder.

Use parchment paper on the plate. Cooking time was longer than 5 minutes.

I'm amazed.  I skipped the bag, sprayed  a plate with Pam placed mandolin sliced pieces without overlapping.  Roughly 3 minutes..... I watched it and took middle pieces off as they browned and then 30 more seconds or so for the outside pieces.  I can't believe how easy and delicious these are!

I had to  cook them longer in microwave than the recipe said. I see that is a common problem with other folks. might as well do them on stovetop, results are much better!

Instead of a plate, my hubby used the round plastic trays out of my food dehydrator. Make lots of chips in one batch. Rotate the trays from top to bottom and you still need to oil the slices. Wonderful!!

Awesome! No more Lay's for me! 

These are quick, easy, and delicious!

I used an oven liner over my microwave plate and patted the slices with a paper towel before putting them in the bag with the oil. Turned out great at 4 minutes the first try. 

Thanks so much!

These are awesome!! My husband loves them. I slice them paper thin for work lunches, and a little thicker for dipping. They are great dipped in homemade ranch. YUM!

15 minutes is what it ended up taking to make them crispy.  Once they were done, they were amazing. These will undoubtedly be a regular thing in our house.

Made these with my daughter. I used a potato peeler to slice super thin, cooked until they started turning brown, and they were perfect! I used parchment paper instead of cooking spray on a plate and just used it over and over. My plate was also ceramic, and held heat, so each batch cooked a bit quicker than the one before. 

VERY tasty. Much preferred over Lays and maybe even Kettle chips.

I used the straight blade on my spiralizer to cut them a bit thicker than the recipe recommends.  They took ten minutes to cook in my microwave, but my microwave always takes about twice as long as most recipes call for.  The chips had the texture of "kettle" style chips.  I salted them with garlic basil salt.  My husband loved them.   I will likely be making these again soon.

These chips were terrific! We took the suggestions of a couple other reviewers and used parchment paper to prevent the chips from sticking to the dinner plate, and we watched the chips carefully to make sure they didn't burn. They turned out crunchy, golden brown, and really tasty. We were impressed by how easy it was to make and how good they turned out. Just as good and way healthier than store-bought chips!

I didn't have a mandoline so I tried using  a potato peeler but had to resort to using a knife. My potatoes didn't cook very evenly and if you don't keep a close eye on them they'll burn. Overall, they were pretty good.

Such a cool idea! Once you get the timing right, it makes all the difference and they taste so amazing! They were gone in under five minutes! Try adding a little bit of steak spice and you will be in heaven!!!

Quick, easy and oh, so good! And on top of all that, they are better for you. I seasoned mine with Tabasco Sea Salt (yes, there is such a thing!) and course grain garlic powder when I took them out of the microwave. YUMMY! When doing multiple batches keep and eye on them as they seem to start cooking faster. As per other reviewers, I used parchment paper and canola spray oil.  That worked out very nicely as the just slid off into my bowl.  Luv this recipe! I will be experimenting with different seasonings to what other winners I come up with!

Takes a lot of tinkering with the timing.  While the results are satisfactory, you must either really want to wait for your snack or like the method of cooking because it isn't fast.

To keep from an oil mess I used my misto*. You put what ever kind of oil and fluid flavor you want in it without any additives.  Pump and spray the chips and plate.

These are sooo good!  If you have a mandoline slicer, its super quick too!  I don't use any oil at all.  Try sprinkling with parmesan cheese instead of salt.  Delicious!

5 ½ - 6 minutes in my microwave.  Sprayed with olive oil cooking spray, then sprinkled with coarse sea salt prior to cooking…So good!!!  All the taste & crunch without any of the fat of "regular" potato chips!

I'd say about 3-4 stars. 4 stars for once finally done. But, they took a lot longer than the time stated and at first were not getting the least bit crispy :( But, after playing with the recipe I added little more oil to the bag and added about 2-3 more minutes cooking time (around 7-8 mins total). They finally started coming out and ended up being pretty good. I think I'll try this recipe again but prepare for it to take a lot longer.

However, instead of using regular potatoes, I used a sweet potato, and everyone was very impressed that they were homemade. This recipe could be a little more specific on how many potatoes to cook at a time, but other than that, I really do enjoy this recipe. Thanks so much for sharing!

I can't believe how easy it was to make these chips. On top if that, they taste great.

I think these are great! But I'm not sure if the type of potato matters? I used any.

I am never buying potato chips again!  For a single serving, I used a small potato, 1 tsp of olive oil, and sprinkled a little sea salt before I put them in the microwave.  Mine were in for 7 minutes and could've gone a little longer (I have an 1800 watt microwave).  Will definitely be buying a potato slicer so I can make these quickly and in bulk.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Just terrible. Nothing like store-bought potato chips. My husband, who eats anything, could barely stand them and proposed that we never make then again. As written, they stick to the plate and are a crunchy, crumbly mess. With Pam, they all stick together. You also have to use tbsp after tbsp of salt to add any flavour, and even then they are bland and boring. Will not make again.

I tried to make these last night. I say tried because I wasn't able to get them crispy. They were good but once I can perfect the cooking, I know they will be better. Thanks, Jessica.

I spent the afternoon making these chips. I followed all the directions specified and did not change anything. They turned out soggy and gross. I ate a few but they were worse than anything I've had in a long time.

Really good! The first batch I just threw on a plate and did not separate at all and were layered on there. Yes they turned out stuck together but they were still crispy and very good. (cooked for almost 10 minutes in microwave). I did only one layer the next two batches and they were good but we almost liked the pile of them better. Either way they taste like name brands and are delicious.

Quick, easy, and tasty! Much better than our usual M.O. of buying a bag of chips, eating some, and then throwing the rest away a couple weeks later!

These are really good. Takes a little tweaking with different microwaves but that is common sense to most. The only problem I had is making them fast enough for my large family!

It took 15 minutes for these to crisp in the microwave. Way to long for just a few chips.

Use seasoning salt instead of regular to get a different flavor...and try using a little spray bottle filled with malt vinegar to spritz the chips with just before serving.

There are a lot of variables to try to perfect here (thickness of slices, time in the microwave, etc) for a snack.  Although tasty, I'd rather just buy a bag of chips.

YUM!!!  Who knew the microwave could be used to make awesome potato chips?!  I used a mandolin to cut my potatoes, which worked wonderfully for perfectly thin and crisp chips.  I tried both vegetable oil and olive oil, and we MUCH preferred the olive oil batch.  I didn't mess with the plastic bag, instead using another reviewer's tip to just pour some oil directly on the plate, then dip and arrange the potato slices from there.  These cooked in approximately 5 minutes and 15 seconds for me.  My boyfriend was astonished when I presented him with the bowl, exclaiming "Where did these come from?  I thought we were out of chips!"  When I told him I had made them, he was even more amazed, telling me they taste just like Lay's.  Yes, these were a big hit with the whole family.  Thanks Jessica :)

Amazing! I can't believe this works. I used evoo and sprinkled them with rosmary garlic seasoning. They were fantastic. Watch them closely the first couple times so you can see how long they will take with your microwave. Parchment paper works really well. I am going to try to figure a way to stack these in the microwave so I can make more at one time.

These were fantastic, and I will definitely try this recipe again! 
I wanted to try this recipe out for a potluck I was going to, but since it was my first time, I decided that it was better just to experiment than actually serve the chips. But this recipe was so quick, easy, and tasty, that I have concluded my experiment was successful!
After reading the other reviews, I thought that I might need to microwave my potato slices a considerably longer, but I'm not sure if my microwave was particularly powerful or what, but 2 to 3 minutes seemed to be the perfect cooking time for my chips. 4 minutes practically burned all of the chips. They turned out perfectly crispy, like the commercial kind. 
Before trying out the recipe, I was a bit worried that I wouldn't be able to get the slices "paper thin", which is exactly what happened. They were a bit thick, but the microwave was able to cook them all the way. 
GREAT RECIPE!!

I too was VERY skeptical when I saw that you cook these in the micro but it worked! I also was shocked how much flavor just salt & pepper gave them!  My micro took way longer (about 7 mins) but they are DELISH (& MUCH healthier)!!!  I will definately share this with others!  ;o]

I just made this and I couldnt believe how great they came out!!!  I used a round dinner plate and sprayed Pam cooking spray on the plate rather than using the vegetable oil, laid one layer of the potato chips on the plate, and sprayed some more Pam on the chips.  Had to keep adding minutes to the time so they could brown up.  Took 10 minutes total. I sprinkled with sea salt and cayenne pepper. Delish!!!

I've been making these for a while now too, & like a lot of reviewers I was skeptical but it comes out great.

I think one trick is to definitely use parchment paper & I toss the potatoes in a baggie with a little olive oil & give it a good shake. Takes just over 4 mins in my microwave.

These came out amazingly great!

I think people may have not cut their potatoes thin enough (despite what some people have written, a knife will not cut as thin as a mandolin consistently) and perhaps used the wrong kind of potato. Last year's potatoes will burn easier and new potatoes sometimes do not brown or crisp.

I did have trouble with these sticking to the plate however

I've always wanted to make my own potato chips, but I was skeptical when I tried this. I was very surprised my chips turned out great! It took about 4 min. in my microwave. I did have a problem with them sticking, so I will follow some advise and try using parchment paper next time. I'm also going to try soaking the potatoes in vinegar before I cook them and see if I can make salt & vinegar chips!!

honestly cannot believe these came from the microwave, OR that I had never thought to make chips this way. I used olive oil and sea salt and they were perfect. mine took about 7-8 minutes to crisp and I skipped the bag as well, just brushed with olive oil. will definitely be experimenting with different seasonings!

Sprayed with olive oil. Super simple and now I can control the amount of salt on my chips.  Will try again using other spices as well.

I followed this exactly, and they did not turn out for me. I cooked them longer than the reccomended amount, and still no crispiness..then I ended up burning them trying to find that right texture...... Not sure where I went wrong.

This is SUCH a fast and easy way of preparing homemade potato chips! I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and used seasoned salt. I used a steel knife and attempted to get my slices as thin as possible, with mostly success. These were a huge hit with the hubby, who ate almost all of them (3 potatoes worth) and then asked for more.

Always good when you make it at home. So simple with just 3 ingredients. I like to bake mine instead of frying them or microwaving. I also add some chipotle seasoning to spice them up. And to add an "EXTRA KICK" I add Manchego cheese on top. So good.

Okay, these are awesome- can't believe this works. I do agree, it's hard to keep up with demand! I used a vegetable peeler to peel mine. Also, these took 10 minutes in my microwave.  I would also like to note that I think I overheated my microwave making these- I thought it had died- but it just got hot on the outside and shut down, then reset after about an hour and is working fine now. I also sliced my freaking finger with the vegetable peeler. These are really notes to self. However, these are so good I will make them again...lol.

These are absolutely fantastic! As most reviewers, I was skeptical, and then completely blown away when they worked and were tasty! I followed others advice and just put a piece of parchment paper straight onto the microwave plate, and used Pam instead of vegetable oil. I'm pretty sure that I won't make these for my husband if I ever want to have some for myself! :)

found that it took between 7-10 min and I used Pam vs. vegetable oil but this has turned out to be a family favorite. Have fun mixing different spices to find a flavor that you like.

Absolutely amazing! So easy and delicious.  I tossed in a bowl instead of a bag and each batch took 9 minutes.  One large russet potato sliced thin was 3 batched on a large 10" dinner plate.  My only wish is for a huge microwave. : )

These are good. I don't think I'll be wasting anymore potato skins when I need peeled potatoes for some meal; I'll probably make them into chips! I def want to try chili powder & cayenne on these. Maybe add a little sugar(?) to those two to get a dorito flavor. Adding onion powder should taste great! Maybe cheese too!

Like everyone else, I was totally surprised that the potatoes would crisp in the microwave.  Took about 10 mins in my microwave.  I didn't have parchment, so used wax paper and had trouble removing some of the potatoes from the paper.  Will try parchment next time.  Tasty, quick, easy and different!  Thanks for sharing.

Like many I wasn't sure what to expect.  My husband rolled his eyes when I told him what we were having and how I was making it.  I used wax paper and put the potatoes in Olive oil with some salt in a plastic baggie.  For my microwave it took 7 minutes.  The first batch I cooked a little longer because I was looking for the brown.  It was too much, stop cooking when they are at the most 1/2 brown.  Will make again but won't be a staple.  I used my grater to slice the potatoes, maybe they were a litle too thick but still good.

Great recipe! I made these two nights in a row. The first time, I cooked the potatoes too long, and they turned out too crisp. The second time, they turned out much better. I would recommend experimenting with different seasonings; I've tried salt and vinegar and seasoning salt (which I preferred). They're very good chips with less guilt than Lay's or Herr's.

Like many of the reviewers, I started making these with the mentality of "This probably isn't going to work, but..." To my surprise, these were great! I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and put the potato slices on parchment paper and put that straight into the microwave. I HIGHLY recommend using a mandoline. It cuts down prep time AND cooking time--my first batch only took 3 minutes and 30 seconds in the microwave for my chips to get hot, crispy, and perfectly golden. I'll definitely be taking advantage of this technique again (plus some experimenting with seasonings)!

What a surprisingly great recipe!  I had to try these because I am always craving chips.  They were wonderful tasting and easy to make.  Mine did take about 7 and a half minutes to brown, but each microwave is different.  What is nice also, you can flavor them any way that you like.

Not too great, not bad. Just homie stuff. The chips came out a little dry, so the next time I put the potato in bag with oil. Its good to try, but eat it right away...

These are the BEST chips I've ever had!!! I had a couple of problems though. First, don't slice the potatoes too thin or they will stick no matter how much oil you use. And second, I need about 9 more microwaves!! I was eating them as fast as they were coming out of the microwave. Good thing ev1 else was already in bed or a 10 lb bag of potatoes would be history!

So for me at least, these weren't quite as good as the potato chips you buy at the store.  However, if you're on a budget (like me), happen to have potatoes at home (like me) and have a WICKED craving for some greasy chips (like me), this recipe DEFINITELY does the job.

Surprisingly very good!  They actually taste like "real" potato chips!  I sliced the potatoes with a mandolin and laid them in a single layer on a parchment lined plate.  They did stick in areas where they overlapped but no big deal.  My only complaint is that you can only make a few at a time and they disappear quickly!  Fun idea!

Wow!  I was skeptical- like everyone else- but these really are tasty chips.  It took about 8.5 minutes in my microwave for them to brown- and no problems with sticking to the plate.  A bit labor intensive if you're looking to munch through a whole bag of chips, but an excellent and healthy snack!  Thank you!

These chips were delicious! Very easy, and the whole family loved them! We cooked them for 6 min on high and that made them brown and crispy. Will make again!

This was a great and healthy snack! This recipe was fun to make and super simple, though, I only did one small potato, so if you're making a lot it might get annoying. They took about 6-1/2 minutes in my microwave. I seasoned them with salt and bbq seasoning. My little guy loved them and so did I! Thanks for sharing. :)

My boys loved these, as did myself. I skipped adding the oil and just sprayed the plate with non-stick baking spray and lightly salted. I unfortunately don't have a mandolin and sliced my taters with the peeler, the perfect thickness. Its a good thing I started when they were outside to get a few plate fulls done before they came in off the rink !!! definitley adding to my favourite snack!!

I cannot believe how good these were!  I ordered homemade chips at a Longhorn Steakhouse last week, and looked online for a recipe.  They served theirs with seasalt, course cracked pepper and a sauce on the side.  Much to my surprise, the waitress told us the sauce was just a mixture of ranch dressing and a touch of barbeque sauce.  Doesn't sound appealing, but it was awesome!  Try it and post your thoughts.

I like them better than the store bought ones! They did take to long to make though, and they stuck to the plate. If you want a lot, (And you will :D) start making them an hour ahead of time!

I did not expect this to work AT ALL (just like many other reviewers mentioned). However, these potato chips come out of the microwave as if they were store-bought. Very easy, and delicious snack. Just remember to keep an eye on 'em while they're in the microwave, cause they quickly become too brown/burnt (take them out when you see a hint of brown, about 3min30 for me).

WOW!  Made this out of curiosity because I couldn't believe you could make chips in the microwave.  Boy was I wrong!  I'm wondering if you could also use this technique for other root vegetables like Sweet potatoes or carrots.

These were fun to make. I'm not a big chip eater, so I usually don't buy them. However I had a craving for them today, so I decided to try making them myself. It was super easy and fast, and I like how you can flavor them to your liking. The first batch I seasoned with a pepper and garlic combination (yum!) and the second batch I used a cayenne seasoning (it was okay, but not great). The hardest part is slicing them as thin as possible. The best tool I had on hand was a knife, so some slices were thicker than others, but overall, the final product was nonetheless delicious. I'll be hangin' on to this simple recipe, thanks Jessica!

I too was leary of the crisping/browning abilities of the microwave, but BOY was I pleasantly surprised!  I took the advice of another and simply sprayed the dish with olive oil and then sprayed the potatoes (use a flat plate or they will slide while cooking).  It did take about 7-8 minutes on high, but worth the time/wait.  I didn't even season or peel them, just dipped into homemade ranch dressing once cooked. I have told everyone I know about this easy & healthy alternative. Dee-lish!

So much fun!  They need to cook for 6 - 7 minutes in the microwave.  I tried it with olive oil and PAM, both came out great.  Since I have a small microwave, I kept the cooked chips in the oven on a low setting until they were all ready.  I made two different toppings - salt & chili powder, and salt and Israeli hot paprika.  You can really get creative.  So good!

Awesome recipe.  Aded a little Balsalmic Vinegar to the oil and sprinkled with coarse Kosher salt!  Took a little longer to crisp up, but a nice subtle vinegar flavor.  Yummy.

Unbelievable.  I never thought this would work but it did.  What wonderful - warm - crunchy - potatoe chips.  I didn't have a mandoline so my potatoes slices were a little thick and thus had to microwave them for around 8 minutes.  I may just buy a mandoline so I can make these nice and thin.

I was attracted to this recipe because ingredients in commercially sold chips make my face break out. I really enjoyed the taste of the chips and like other reviewers, I was surprised that they could be browned in the microwave.  I used my food processor to slice the potatoes, so that part went very quickly. During the microwaving, I discovered that a really flat plate is required and that the chips in the center will brown more quickly than the chips on the outer edges.  Also, it was a little time consuming carefully laying a single layer of chips on the plate and determining exactly how many minutes a good browning actually took. The chips were extremely hot when I removed them from the plate so I had to watch that I didn't hurt myself.  All in all, the chips were good, but I don't think that the small amount of chips that one can microwave at a time makes it worth it for me. It was interesting to try though, so thanks for the microwaving adventure.

These were really good and easy. It does take time since you can only cook so many at once. We like these with malt vinegar sprinkled on them.

Like everyone else I was skeptic. And I was very surprised.  These are perfect.  Watch them carefully. Mine took 5 minutes. Nothing needs to be changed. Like one reviewer stated, she was creative and made potato doilys, how clever and yummy. Go for it, you will not believe how easy, and tasty.

These were good, but I was having trouble pulling them out of the microwave.  They were either too done or undercooked.  I did find a good spice for them, though.  It's grillmates barbecue spices...yum.

My husband did not believe this was going to work. These were the best potato chips I have ever had. We had to make a lot of batches and it broke the plate. Be careful what plate you use.

I too was surprised that these turned out. I had to cook mine for 5 minutes. They tasted great and I can't wait to try different flavor variations!  Also, I used olive oil which tastes great.

These are great!!  I was shocked as well that they could turn out so good in the microwave!  I followed the directions and didn't stray, very tasty!  Mine only took 4 minutes...I'm sure it varies by potato thickness and the power of your microwave.

This recipe is GREAT! Make sure you keep cooking until the potato slices brown. I just wish we could do these faster, the family eats one batch before the next batch is ready!

Like a few others, I stumbled upon this recipe by accident and gave it a try. I love it! What do I love about it? I love that I don't need to fry anything, I love that I can change the seasoning and control the amount of salt, I love that I can use different kinds of potatoes. I didn't love that mine took a bit longer than 5 min, but what can you do? :) I took the suggestion of using parchment straight on the turntable, and that worked really well. I'll be using this recipe again.

This recipe was better than I expected. I tried cooking them with a dinner plate sprayed with Pam and with plate with parchment paper sprayed with Pam. Both methods worked well. The paper just made it easier to transfer the chips.  A single layer of potatoes took about 5 minutes in my microwave. Thank you for a great alternative to fried chips!

Wow! Why in the world would anyone not make these?  Healthy, cheap, delicious!
I used canola oil spray on plate and on chips, a sprinkle of salt, 8 mins in my m/w and my family liked them much more than bagged chips.  Thanks for sharing!

I've tried to make potato chips before with no success, but this recipe did the trick. As other reviewers have noted, each microwave is different. It took mine about 5 minutes, and I couldn't make them fast enough for my 4 year old. Instead of coating them in oil, I used cooking spray as was suggested by another, so even my heart healthy husband ate them and loved them.  A keeper. (the chips and the husband)

This recipe was fantastic.  I, like another reader, saw it and went and made them right away.  Very easy.  I used the Pampered Chef slicer...worked perfect.  The only problem I did have was with the potatos sticking to the plate even after I oiled it.  So, next time, which will probably be later today, I will try the parchment paper idea.  I am trying to watch my weight so this is awesome...plus, you can control the amount of salt/seasoning used (if any).  Mine took about 5-6 minutes to cook...but you do need to watch it during the last couple of minutes.

Followed recipe exactly.  WONDERFUL!  Family LOVED them with a sprinkle of Lawry's seasoned salt.  Used a cheese slicer to make them a uniform thickness since I didn't have a mandolin.

Yum!  I just made these with my Pampered Chef Ultimate Mandolin!  You can sprinkle anything on these things...I used the P.C. southwestern seasoning, a chipotle seasoning and a popcorn seasoning to try out different flavors.  I also just used baking spray and they didn't stick to the plate at all.  I might try these at one of my shows to demo. the mandolin and seasonings!  They definitely satisfied my salt craving!

i did this one as a substitute for frozen chips, i cut the slices a bit thick, they took about 15 mins on high, came a bit hard, so next time will put for less. but great alternative we loved it, sprinkled a bit of chicken salt once i took them out and they were great. thanks for this one!

YUMMY!  I tried this recipe and it's great.  quick, easy and tasty plus a healthier alternative to store bought chips.  The only reason I only gave it 4 stars is because even with the oil they stuck to the plate.  And for a twist I seasoned mine with either seasoned salt or cajun seasoning.

I agree with others....these were sooo easy and surprisingly tasty!  Even my 9 year old daughter, the fussyest of them all, loved them.  (She hates potatos, go figure) I did not have vegetable oil so I used corn oil, and they turned out okay.  Although they shrink up and you don't get much from one potato, it's worth it to keep making more.  Plus, there is no other "junk" added to them. like the store brands.  We made some with Chili powder, onion powder, garlic salt and just plain salt.  Thanks for a great the recipe.

These are great.  I had to spray Pam on the plate each time... Used my Kitchen Aid slicer to slice potatoes - I think next time I will go a bit thicker to get more of a kettle chip.  Yum!  Also, I salt and peppered mine before microwaving them - delicious!

Great snack & it sure beats having to find a recipe using potato chips, just because I had a craving. ;o) I used the slicer part of a cheese grater & just sprayed w/ Pam & sprinkled w/ season-all salt... it did take about 10 minutes. I wonder how BBQ seasoning would be? Thansk for the recipe!

These were so good. It took about 9 minutes for them to cook, but it was so easy. And, suprisingly they were very crunchy. Will make again.

i used a mandoline and cooked the chips 6 minutes in my microwave & they turned out crisp & yummy!  requires a bit of time if you want to make more than one serving, but i love the inexpensiveness of making them.  thank you!

Meh, these were ok but nothing spectacular. I must admit that I don't have a kitchen mandoline, and I think they would have turned out better had I cut them way more thinly. I squirted them with a little butter-flavored Pam, and sprinkled on some Kosher salt. They weren't very flavorsome and not very crispy. Oh well. Thanks anyway!

Our family had a taste test between this recipe and one that involved frying the potato chip.  Unfortunately, the general concensus on this one was that it tasted burnt.  One change that we made to the recipe that seemed to make them better was to spray them with butter flavored nonstick oil spray.  This helped the taste.

I am giving this 5 stars because I know it would be awesome if all the slices could be cut evenly and thin. I had a few that I was able to get real thin and they were great. The thicker ones were edible, but not great. I may have to go buy a slicing board! 
I did have to play with the time, but again, it may have been because of the varying thickness. I did have the same issue with the chips sticking to the plate as others, but I was able to carefully pry them from the plate using the tip of a sharp knife with minimal breakage of the chip.

I tried making these last night with mostly good results. I was surprised how easy they were! I have a mandoline so slicing the potatoes was easy, but I found they didn't crisp up as uniformly as I'd hoped. Some were too cooked while others remained a little floppy, all in the same batch. They were still pretty tasty, however, and I will continue to experiment with them in the future. I'm thinking about trying sesame oil for some asian flavour.

It does work but the chips that it makes aren't very good.  Takes too long to achieve a worthwile amount also.

This is a great idea, and tasted pretty good, too.  You really have to slice these thin or they won't crisp up, they just get rubbery.  I also had a hard time pulling them out when they were "just perfect."  They were either getting too done or not done enough.  These are better than normal potato chips, but I like the kettle cooked chips better.

they have to brown too much to become crisp for my taste.  maybe it was because i used red potatos and olive oil.  that on top of being a bit of a pain to make (slicing and wait time) will lead me to the grocery store next time i have a chip craving.

This recipe worked despite my doubts.  I used a mandolin slicer as recommended.  I added seasoning salt to the uncooked slices.  You could probably add a no salt substitute as well.  My husband, the potato chip expert, loved it and so did the kids.  Thanks for the recipe.

Yep!  These chips are easy and yummy.  My 3 kids and hubby are eating them as I type this, eagerly waiting on the next batch to finish.  I tried what others had recommended and spayed with PAM and it worked great.  Mine took about 8-10 minutes.  I'm thinking I'll try this with "shoestring" taters too.  Thanks for the recipe!

Took way to long (8-10 min) to microwave, but pretty good.  Will make again, but try cooking on my baked potato setting instead of just regular time cook.

The straight edge on my grater makes these just thick enough that I can pop them off the plate.  Haven't figured out how to make them not stick yet, have tried cooking sprays, etc.,  but hasn't stopped me from making them all the time!  My microwave (which rotates the whole time) takes 8.5 minutes.  If I want cheesy flavor, I use the powder in the classic mac and cheese box, sprinkle it during the last minute (approximately).  But there is such good flavor to them plain, or if you use olive oil, they let you satisfy a long-term munchie attack in the evenings without guilt. I'd never have guessed I could've found a snack like this that was microwaved!

We were also a bit unsure how the microwave approach would work, but it was really delicious, quick, and the best part is you can control the amount of oil/fat to suit your taste.  

PAM on the dish was a great suggestion, you can't do without it!  We tossed the chips w/ 1 teaspoon of vinegar and then salted...

These were great! I never thought a recipe so simple could be so good. The mandolin slicer was key for making the chips turn out thin and crispy. My husband and I were impressed.. I'll be making these again and experimenting with different seasonings. Yum!
