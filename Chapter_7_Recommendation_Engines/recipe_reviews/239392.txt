Thank you so much!  This was awesome!  I didn't even add the butter and it was still so great, hearty, and easy!  You redeemed my love for soup since I made another soup recipe on here the other day and it was AWFUL.

Way too much curry. I had so much hope for this recipe but ultimately I just didn’t like the flavour :(

Very simple to make and extremely tasty! I used slightly more curry powder and slightly more seasoning. Will definitely make this again.

It’s just ok. I added some yogurt to it as I didn’t have any cream in the house. It needed something to make it creamy. Someone mentioned they used cream instead of milk: was mild missing from the recipe?

We both enjoyed this a lot. Used vegetable stock instead of chicken just because we were out. Also used coconut oil instead of butter and it added a touch of sweetness. Added cayenne too. Pretty good with my changes and will try again as written again. Thank you!

Very easy to make and tasty!  I used acorn squash in place of the carrots as that is what I had on hand.  Served with a dollop of sour cream.  Yum.

I was looking for a soup recipe to use up leftover veggies and this was IT! I mostly followed the directions, except in a different order: I toasted 2 TBSP of Madras curry powder with the oil for a few seconds, then added the onion, (unpeeled) carrot and pepper (only had an orange pepper in the fridge so I used that). Plus, I added some of the broth to the mixture. 

After about 10 minutes, I added the garlic and some more curry (the usual kind) and stirred until I could smell the garlic. Then I added the cauliflower and the rest of the broth, brought to a boil and then to a simmer for 25 minutes.

THEN I used my immersion blender to puree the soup, and then added some Frank's hot sauce, ground pepper and salt (Herbamare Zesty). NO BUTTER NEEDED.

YUM!!!

Fantastic soup that was amazingly simple to make. One word of caution, the soup did not leave me full for very long. So I would suggest to anyone making it that you pair it up with some crackers or a hearty bread to make it a little more filling.

Loved it, but would use a touch less curry powder next time!
