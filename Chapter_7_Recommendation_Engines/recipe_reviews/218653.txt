I've been making this since I learned how to do it as a small child at daycare! Now my kids and I make this together and they love it as much as I do. This is good with Reese's peanut butter cups, Mr. Goodbar's or Crunch bars, too. Whatever candy bar you have on hand can pretty much be substituted for the Snickers. Really good with ice cream or whipped cream on top, too, if you really want to indulge!

I think this would be a real hit with kids. A little sweet for me and mushy bananas are not my fav but I think kids would love to make these for the campfire. The candy choices would be fun to mix up too.

Tried these out with Easter candy.  We baked ours at 350; I think campfire (as directed) or grill would give better results.

I have been making these for a couple of years now, since finding the recipe. When my husband and I go camping I make them for a after dinner treat every night. I have used all kinds of candy bars, my favorite are ones with Carmel in them. Just don't cook to long or the Carmel turns to liquid and runs out of the banana. I also like snickers. My husband who is not a sweet eater loves these, if he doesn't have his own every night he helps eat mine. These put S'mores to shame!

These are great and have become a campfire tradition for us. If you only have s'mores ingredients they are just as good with only chocolate and marshmallows stuffed in.  Also, I think removing a wedge of banana may be unnecessary - just slice down the middle and stuff it in!
