I think this recipe earns 5 stars with the following changes:
To the chocolate mixture, add...
1/2 t. baking powder
1 T. water
1/2 cup mini chocolate chips

I added a little extra peanut butter, allowing it to heap over the side of the measuring cup.  Instead of preparing as suggested, I swirled together the peanut butter and chocolate dough to create a marbled effect.

These cookies are much better the second day.  Make them at least a day ahead of serving.  Over time, the chocolate part seems to absorb some moisture from the peanut butter part, and the flavors meld together.

I combined the chocolate and peanut butter batter together to alter the recipie a bit. It turned out alright, but didn't hold together too well.  The cookie mix in general is too lumpy.  I would add another egg or some water to help hold the mix together.  If you're willing to experiment with the recipie a little this is worth trying.

Awsome cookies! However, this recipie only made 3 dozen cookies (as opposed to 4 dozen like it said.) My suggestion also, is to make extra penut butter batter and do half chocolate/ half penut butter instead of about 3/4 chocolate and 1/4 peniut butter, then it would mabye make 4 dozen.

HI!  We played with this recipe a drop, but stuck to  the basics!  I added 1 tsp. of baking powder to the chocolate mixture.  I also added chocolate chips to the chocolate mix.  It made them really yummy.  We cooked them for a lot longer then 12 minutes though.  WE stored them in our freezer, and they are really yummy!

These worked well- even for an amateur baker!  Went over very well for both my wife and son.

I made a number of alterations after reading the reviews.

1 - Used butter instead of shortening (thought we were out).
2 - Used 2 eggs.
3 - Used 1/4 teaspoon salt.  (I would have used 1/2 but wanted to be careful as I was using salted butter.  They didn't seem too salty.)
4 - Used 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder- they were still a little flat, but not horrid.  I will try full TBS next time.
5 - Used 1/2 cup peanut butter.

* I would have used chocolate chips if I'd had them... rather, if I'd known we had them.  They were still tasty with out, I just happen to be very partial to chocolate.

Also, I made them small- as directed and it made the full 4 dozen.

Thanks for the recipe!

I really enjoyed the recipe, but I wish I would have looked at the reviews first!  1tsp of salt was a bit much, but other than that, loved it.

I followed the recipe for the most part except adding in baking powder per the other recommendations.  These have to be the worst tasting cookies I've ever eaten, and I am a chocolate lover!  Maybe adding in chocolate chips would make it better.  I ended up throwing away the batter it was that bad.

The taste was great but there were a few things that needed some work.  When i first made the chocolate mixture it looked like it wasn't going to make 4 doz. so I used a measured table spoon.  I had to double the chocolate recipe but only made one of the peanutbutter topping.  Also when the cookies baked they were flat.  Next time I will deffinatly add some baking powder.  This is a good recipe if you are willing to put some time into testing things out.

They tasted better on the second batch when we added a Tbsp of peanut butter, mixed the two doughs, and a handful of chocolate chips.

1 teaspoon salt is way too much for a cookie recipe. Use less and this recipe might turn out decent.

this recipe was okay. i was expecting something richer. i took some tips from other reviewers, added half teaspon baking powder and used 3/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips (instead of squares) and about 1/2 cup of all natural PB, and used an additional egg.  i mixed all the batter together, too.  they're not bad, but i think i'll try some other choco/PB cookie recipes.

Yummy cookies!  I made the following chgs. - instead of unsweetened bakers chocolate I used semi-sweet (4 squares = 1 oz) and I added a candied pecan on top.  Baked for only 8 minutes.  Family loved them.  I'll definitely make again.
