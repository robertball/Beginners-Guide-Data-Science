Delicious and looks so elegant.  I substituted graham cracker crumbs for the vanilla wafer crumbs.  Will definitely make this one again.

Yummy! But I think it would be better with peaches and peach yougurt, or maybe strawberrys and strawberry yougurt. Also chocolate cookie crumbs. I will definitly make it agan!

Very good! I made this for my family (i don't eat sugar) but I even took a few spoonful.  Next time I'm going to try a different fruit/yogurt combination
