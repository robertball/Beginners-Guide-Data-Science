This actually wasn't bad. It oddly even tasted like a Taco Bell bean burrito for some reason. Only change I made was using 1 Tblsp. of taco seasoning instead of 2. It was so quick to make for a lunch. I used Trader Joes homemade tortillas and Penzeys taco seasoning. I blended the ingredients in my blender and then microwaved it. I would make this again for a quick lunch. ty

This is a good general guideline to follow for burritos. I made my own taco seasoning using the recipe posted on this site. Perhaps store bought pre-mixed seasoning is more bland (?), but using two tablespoons of the seasoning I made would have left the beans way too salty. I used only one tablespoon and it was still a bit too overpowering. Next time Iâ€™ll try 1/2 - 3/4 teaspoon. I also like to mix a bit of ranch with the lettuce and add halved cherry tomatoes for a yummy topping. Delicious!
