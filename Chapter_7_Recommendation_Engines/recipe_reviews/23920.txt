A good "base" recipe that can easily be elaborated on for taste or what you happen to have in your pantry. I had rotini pasta, which worked well but cooked faster than the 15 minutes alloted. I also only had plain diced tomatoes, but that was remedied by adding onion, garlic, salt and pepper to the beef, then italian spices to the tomatoes. Great one dish meal!

This was really good!  Quick, easy, and flavorful.
I sauteed some garlic and onions, and then added some fresh basil and a sprinkle of crushed red pepper.  I also substituted Fontinella for the parmesan....perfect!

I got this recipe as a tear off in the grocery aisle of the meat department years ago.  It's nothing special...........  It needs a little work - like some spices.  I've tried it a couple of times and penne pasta works the best (1 1/2 cups) add some onion, garlic, basil, and some fresh tomatoes to the mix and it's not bad for a quick meal.

Enjoyed, but not as good as I expected it to be.  WOuld recommend if looking for an easy meal to cook with little to no effort.  But, it is not one I would make just because...

To watery for my liking. Also too stodgy and I will return to cooking my pasta separately from the rest of the dish.

I made this for a teacher for an appreciation dinner and couldn't wait to make it for my family after I tasted it.  Simple ingredients and the recipe is easy to adjust to taste adding more pasta, zucchini, or spices.  Easy to make, even kids helped.

This is a great recipe in it's simplicity! I only used 1lb ground beef (93% lean), added 1tblp minced garlic (from a jar) and 1/2tsp crushed oregano to the beef broth (low-sodium) and sprinkled a little salt and fresh-cracked pepper on the zucchini.
Served with crusty bread and a nice shiraz--this was a great, simple recipe using things I already had on hand!

Fixed this tonight and we liked it very much.  Will definitely fix it again.  I only used 1 lb of beef and added some garlic powder and italian seasoning.  Kids weren't too wild about it.

This recipe is good for people who like foods that are mild in flavor. I added some diced onions and garlic salt when cooking the beef (of which I only used one pound and it was fine). Next time I'll add some corn for crunch and maybe some cayenne pepper and/or chili powder for spice.

This was a fantastic recipe, I thought it would be better with beef tips & more tomatoes, otherwise it was very good.

Delicious!  It was very easy to make and turned out beautifully.  I added some left over asparagus and some three-italian cheese at the end.  Next time I am going to substitute 1lb of beef for 1lb of italian sausage--I think that'll really add some extra flavor.  

It provided lots of leftovers too!  Just have some pasta sauce on hand because it's a little dry by the second day.  

Defintely recommend!

I cooked the pasta separately, so in the future if you do that, you won't need as much stock. I also added a ton of spices b/c it would have been really bland w/out it. I used garlic, salt, pepper and oregano. I used a mixture of Parm and Chedder cheese as the topping also. It was pretty good w/ those tweaks.

I made this recipe today and OMG it was soooooooo good! It's almost like a homemade Hamburger Helper. The only thing I did different was: I added chopped onion and bell peppers, 1 Tbsp of chili powder, 3 chopped garlic cloves, and in addition to the beef broth, I added 1 cup of water. The one can of beef broth just wasn't enough liquid. I also let it simmer with the top on the pot. Oh, and I cooked mine longer than the alloted 15 minutes. You definantely need more than 15 minutes if you want the pasta to cook all the way through. This was a great recipe! I can't wait to try it again!

1st Time - Good.  Use much less cheese next time.  The last 5 minutes need to be on very low heat or the pasta will stick to the bottom.  5 minutes is enough to cook the zucchini. A second can of tomatoes probably wouldn’t be too much either…Maybe ground turkey?

2nd Time – Much better.  Used 2 cans of tomatoes, 2 cans of beef broth, a little over one pound of ground turkey, a full bag of noodles, and 2 sliced zucchini, and very little cheese.  The lack of salt compared to ‘hambuger helper’ is noticeable and good!  Try chicken broth or different veggies next time.

This is DEFINITELY replacing my traditional spaghetti recipe!   I must admit that I had to do what one of the other reviewers did because I only had plain diced tomatoes.  I also sauteed the zucchini with onion and minced fresh garlic before throwing EVERYTHING else in.  So quick and so flavorful! Cheap too!  What else could you want?!

My family really liked this recipe!  I did too!  I did add some corn to it and that added a little sweetness and crunch.  I will say that it could have used more of a sauce.  It could have been that I let it boil/simmer too long (my zucchini just wouldn't cook).  For lunch the next day I added some tomato soup and some extra cheese and it was amazing!  My 8 month old daughter couldn't get enough of it either! So delicious!!!

Yum!  This is a very tasty dish!  I made the recipe for two but used an entire can of diced tomatoes.  I also shredded the zuchini (so hubby and son would eat veggies) and sauteed a bit of onion and garlic before browning the beef.  Will definitely make again!

I played around with this recipe a lot based on personal preference! I used 2 cups water and two beef bouillon cubes instead of beef broth, I added twice as much canned tomatoes as reccomended, I wanted more sauce then the recipe called for. I also used "original" tomatoes and added about 1 TBS italian seasonings and about 2 TBS garlic powder. The flavor was wonderful! This was very easy, very filling, and very tasty!

I had my doubts after one reviewer said it was bland because my family likes things flavorful and spicy but I tried and after I added a bit of a zip  it was a hit! First of all the recipe itself is fast and easy  I prepared it ahead of time and let it sit on the stove (no heat) for an hour until everyone came home  not sure if that helped blend and combine flavors  but it didnt hurt! I used corkscrew pasta and added 1 Tablespoon of crushed red pepper,  cup of extra beef broth (as one reviewer suggested), all the cheese (3/4 cup), and  cup of spaghetti sauce (I always use one with red pepper because for some reason it has fewer carbs). The cheese greatly reduced the spiciness from the red pepper  so if you like it spicy Id add another Tablespoon. Then I topped it with red pepper and Parmesan cheese. For a quick meal it was good and my family approved.

I didn't use beef, but ground chicken and chicken stock instead to make it less fattening.  It was quite good.  I also added some garlic salt and some Italian seasonings and used a can of diced tomatos with garlic.  Only used 1 lb of meat and it was plenty.  Very easy.

My husband and I have been trying new recipes that we agree upon and this is one that we both really like! I would add a little more beef broth and tomatoes during the last few minutes because the juices evaporate towards the end.

I've been making this for a few years now.  It's an easy ground beef recipe that's great for a quick weeknight meal.  I've made it with and without the veggies depending on what's in my fridge.  We tend to like a bit more noodles and a bit less beef but that's just personal taste.  Works well with shell pasta or penne too.  Easily modified for whatever is in your pantry.

I took others suggestions and added onion and garlic to the beef, as well as some tomato sauce with italian seasoning to the broth mixture.  I didn't have any zucchini but it was good without it, although zucchini is so mild I am sure it would be delicious in it.

Yummy, but def. needs to be seasoned up. I added some garlic powder, onion powder, basil and parsley. Used fresh tomatoes instead of canned, ground turkey and chicken broth(not beef) elbow mac. instead of farfalle. Easy!

This was pretty good.  I used about 1lb (added salt, pepper, garlic powder while cooking) of beef and doubled the broth.  This meal came together very quickly...served with salad.  Thanks!

This was delicious! My whole family enjoyed it! I originally planned on using italian sausage for the hamburger meat, but forgot to thaw it out, so I used the ground beef. I'm glad I did, because this was excellent! Made it exactly as described, added some minced onion and garlic powder and used about two tablespoons more water. Otherwise, it was perfect! And so easy to make and clean up after!

This went down very well with my family. It reminded me a little of a risotto. I used spiral pasta, and added some fresh basil, parsley, thyme and oregano as well as some salt and pepper. I also didn't use the zucchini, because i am not really a fan. I loved how quick and easy this recipe was, i'll definitely make it again.

This was a big hit at our dinner table.  I cooked the noodles with a lid on them until they were done. Then I added the zucchini, 1/2 of the cheese and meat back in (all at the same time) and cooked for about 5 minutes more.  This kept the zucchini from getting soggy, which I don't care for.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Wonderful summer pasta recipe!  After reading some of the reviews, I made a couple of modifications.  When I sauteed the ground beef, I added some minced garlic, about 3/4 c. chopped onion and was generous with the salt and pepper.  I used 3 cans beef broth and doubled the tomatoes.  It was a little too juicy -- next time I'll use 1-1/2 cans tomatoes.  I didn't have Italian tomatoes so just used regular diced tomatoes but added crushed red pepper, a little more salt and pepper (can't cook pasta without salt!!!), a little garlic powder and some fresh oregano and basil from the garden.  We like our pasta al dente, so I decreased the initial cooking time from 15 to 10 minutes before adding the zucchini, which was also fresh from the garden.  Since I had a little too much sauce, I added the entire 3/4 cup freshly grated parmesan right to the pot.  Delicious!  Like a past reviewer, I made mine a little bit ahead and I think that extra time sitting allowed the flavors to blend wonderfully!

Even my picky eater loved this one!  I did read the reviews posted by others and here is what I did to solve the driness problem. I used my large electric skillet, increased the beef broth to 3 cups of water with 3 beef bullion cubes(or 3 cans of broth).  Instead of Italian style diced tomatoes, I had Rotel diced tomatoes with green chilies in them.  It added a nice kick - but not too spicey.  I also used a can of whole kernal corn - drained.  I added 1 Tablespoon Italian seasoning, minced garlic, minced onions and mushrooms. Cook uncovered in skillet for 8 minutes, then cover and cook for 7 minutes.

This is really good!  I followed the suggestions above and added an extra cup of beef broth and a small can of tomato paste (didn't have any tomato sauce).  I also didn't have Italian style tomatoes - so I used a can of plain diced tomatoes and added onion and garlic with the beef and italian seasoning and salt and pepper and a little crushed red pepper to the tomatoes. I also added a small can of mushrooms and put shredded mozzarella on top with the parmesan since I didn't have freshly grated parmesan.  Very good - I will definitely make it again!

My mom made this years ago and lost the recipe, I was so happy to find it again in here. Such a great, easy dinner dish. I added some chopped onion and garlic while browning the ground beef and it added some great flavor.

A good, easy meal that is cheap and uses ingredients you may already have. Zucchini really is great in this dish (it turned my bf into a zuke lover immediately). As far as I can tell you may need more sauce to make it to your personal liking. I also had to add a little more liquid to cook the pasta but I am at a high altitude (over a mile).

This comes together so easily!  I used ground turkey and also added onion and garlic while browning.  Instead of bowtie I used elbow noodles as I had them on hand and Better than Bouillion to make the beef broth.  I am taking the dish to a friend who just had a baby and I am sure they will love it!

When this dish came up on the weekly menu, I had forgotten to buy the zucchini. I ended up using some frozen green beans I had on hand. I also added a bit of shredded Mozzarella cheese at the end. Instead of cooking the meat and pasta separately, I browned the meat and drained it, then added the broth, tomatoes and pasta and cooked it all together; it ended up taking longer this way. (Didn't drain the tomatoes.) Everybody liked it but probably won't make this pasta dish again. BTW there were no leftovers makes exactly 5 healthy servings.

This is one of our favorite recipes, but I do doctor it up a bit. I add Italian Cheese instead of parmesan, and probably about a cup or so of it. Plus instead of zuchinie, i use 1 can of sliced olives and 1 can of sliced mushrooms. Oh So Good!!! So, 4 stars since I make so many changes.

Good basic recipe. Very easy to make.  Makes quite a few servings and it tastes good left over.  I omitted the zucchini and used ground turkey instead of ground beef.  Pasta does not need to cook for 15 minutes as described in the recipe. I cooked mine for about 7 minutes and it was plenty.

This was a pretty good staple and alternative to spaghetti.  I didn't have zucchini on hand, so didn't use it.  And I added onions, garlic, salt, Italian spice, and some Ragu to the mix.  Like others had noticed, I did need to add more water as the pasta cooked.  But my husband and kids liked it.  The picky eater didn't eat the meat, but picked out the noodles.  I served it with garlic bread.  Will make it again!

This was much better than I thought it would be. Although, I did make some changes. I added crushed garlic, chopped onion and mushrooms to the broth and let that boil for a few minutes before adding the tomatoes. I also added a can of tomato sauce and Italian seasoning. Very, very good! My family loved it. And there was plenty for last minute guests that showed up.
Thanks!

Added chopped onion, granulated garlic, and some dried cilantro as well as an 8 oz can tomato sauce (was afraid it might be too dry if I had not). Used about 8 0z. broken thin spaghetti for the pasta and cooked it and the zucchini together in the tomato mixture for about 6.5 minutes..perfect. Also, used only 1 lb. of ground beef, which was plenty. Will certainly fix this again. Quick, easy, and like a comfort food.

My whole family loved this, including 3 boys aged 9,7,& 4 years old. The 4 year old wants me to make it everyday. I did adjust a few things. I didn't have zucchini, so I didn't add that. I will this summer when it is more abundant though. I can my own tomatoes, so I used a whole quart of stewed tomatoes and added 1-2 T of Italian seasoning to it.Since I added a quart of tomatoes I used 12 oz of pasta and used 18 oz of beef broth.  I also added 1 t. each garlic pwd and onion pwd (As some suggested it didn't have enough flavor). I only adusted the pasta and tomatoes to feed our big family and to have some leftovers. Otherwise it is a great recipe. It only took about 35 minutes to make too. Thanks.

Great recipe.  I added 1 red pepper, minced garlic and sprinkled crushed red pepper for zing.  Added a little water towards the end cause the pasta wasn't quite done.  Gonna going to try it with chicken next.

Good and Easy weeknight meal. I didn't add the zucchini, but did add some onions and garlic. I cooked my pasta separately for about 5 minutes before adding to the broth and tomatoes so all the liquid would not evaporate. This way, I still had plenty of sauce left.

This was very tasty - I used plain diced tomatoes and seasoned it myself with basil, oregano, garlic and onion powder. Also I browned the meat with an onion. I put the meat back in the pan with the tomatoes and uncooked pasta. I did find that I needed to add about an extra 1/2 cup of water as it cooked. I think maybe the heat was too high. Just keep an eye on it and you can guage for yourself. A good recipe.

It's like Hamburger Helper but from scratch - I'll never make hamburger helper again!  Great basic recipe.  Here's my changes: 1 1/2 ground beef, 1 can italian diced tomatoes, 1 to 1/2 can beef broth, 2 cloves garlic minced, 1/2 cup diced onion, 1 1/2 cup pasta, 1/2 cup zucchini, 1/2 cup diced green bell pepper, 1 teaspoon italian seasonings & 1 cup parmesan-ramono cheese, salt & pepper.

This receipe was very good! I would advise kicking the ground beef up  with addtional seasonings such as garlic and oregano and maybe some basil also a small diced onion add that with the ground beef while browning the meat. I will cook this again!! Thanks for a great receipe.

This was fantastic.  I boiled my pasta separately, and put everything together at the end.  Also added garlic, oregano, basil and red pepper flakes to liven things up.  Hubby loved it - and he usually won't eat pasta without red sauce!

My family didn't care for this recipe. I added the noodles like the recipe called for, but they would not cook up properly and turned to mush. Next time, I think I'll boil the noodles first.

This dish is very, very bland for me even I added onions and garlic.  My husband likes it though, he says anyone who is a "meat-and-potato" person would like this dish.  I don't think I will make this again.

Very tasta pasta dish. I love the way the pasta soaks up the tomato and beef broth. It's doesn't taste at all like pasta with spaghetti sauce. Excellent recipe--thanks Corwynn!

Of course I had to play with it a little but I really liked the combination of ingredients! I added about a cup of spaghetti sauce to give it more flavor as it was too bland for me as written. I also added a can of kidney beans and next time maybe I'll add mushrooms and garlic. Also, per advice from other reviews, I added another cup of beef broth because it did seem to be a bit dry. Kids loved it with the exception of the older two who don't like zucchini but it was cut big enough that they could pick it out. And it was easy and quick to make. This is a keeper - thanks Corwynn!

A good family meal- easy when you are looking for something to do with your ground beef. I didn't have zucchini, so I skipped the veggie altogether and ate with salad. I used macaroni noodles, and needed a little more liquid for them to finish cooking, so just added a bit of water.  Fresh parmesan makes it.

This is a good recipe.  It’s fun to switch it up without really making a whole different dish.  If you have small ravioli or tortellini and try that instead of bow ties or add mushrooms.  Just whatever your families prefers.  Great dinner with a salad and crusty bread.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

I agree with others who posted about adding more spices. Cooked the beef with onions and garlic but will add more Italian seasoning and red pepper flakes to make it taste more robust. Otherwise, great recipe that is easy!

This is one of my family’s favorites, and certainly a favorite of mine when I don’t feel like, or don’t have time to fuss with dinner.  I add onion or onion powder and garlic or garlic powder to the ground beef as it’s browning.  I also add a can of HOT green chilies (or fresh if on hand) when adding the rotel.  I’ve found that it typically takes longer than 5 min after you’ve added the zucchini (I use a mix of zucchini and yellow squash) and the meat back in, before it’s ready.  The veggies need a little salt, as well.  Finally, I top with both parmesan and mozzarella cheese and voila!

I adore this recipe, and it's simple enough for a college student (or a recent graduate like me).  In college, I once made it once for a "group dinner" with my friends and they all had second servings. My boyfriend who had just came back from hanging out with his buds was full from bar food helped himself to a small bowl, but it was so good he went back for seconds and was sad to see that there was none left! In my opinion, the ratio of beef to pasta is way off...either double the pasta amount or half the beef, I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with more of a delicious meat casserole than pasta. I also found the 20 minute allotted cooking time was too much, my pasta all but disintegrated with that much time. I also dumped a bit of garlic and onion powder (and other seasonings such as the ones in the "Italian style" tomatoes...like oregano) in because the recipe alone isn't flavorful enough. My last alteration is a a personal preference of my boyfriend's. He hates hard zucchini so I sautéd them in a separate pan until some were beginning to look translucent while browning the beef (should take about the same amount of time), and then dumped them into the pasta pot about 8 minutes in. The zucchini soak up so much flavor and they become as soft as the pasta-we like the texture and the taste of the zucchini better like this.

I love most recipes but no one in my family would eat this one! I did try to use other's recommendations by adding onion, pepper and a small amount of basil. This recipe did not have much flavor. Unfortunately, I wasted a lot of good ingredients.

Needed more broth - would've needed even more if I cooked the zucchini IN the meal - and I decreased the parm. Loved it! But it's obviously not perfect the way the recipe is.

Excellent summer meal. I used 4 fresh, diced tomatoes in place of the canned tomatoes. I also did not have bowtie so I used shells instead and it worked. This was so delicious!  Can't wait to make it again.

I used a little less meat, a little more pasta and it was really good. Everybody ate all their dinner, which is saying a lot at my house.

My family and I liked it.  It was easy and quick so that was very appealing; but there wasn't a lot of flavor.  I did sautee a small amt. of onion and green pepper then browned the meat and added onion powder plus salt & pepper.
I also added about 1/3 cup of red wine and some water b/c there wasn't enough liquid.  Overall nice easy meal.

I tried this recipe on a weeknight for a family of four, one very picky little girl and a 12 month old... everyone loved it! I had to tweak the recipe a little because I didn't have beef broth or zucchini so I just used tomato paste & ketchup instead to thicken the mixture. It came out wonderfully and was ready in less than 30 minutes. Definately will make again.

My husband loved this and wants me to make it again! He doesn't eat cheese, but he liked it just fine without the parmesan. 
I had been warned of this recipe's blandness though, and decided to add some things to spice it up: 
In the pan, before browing the meat, I sauted some onions. While browning the meat, I seasoned it with garlic powder, salt, and pepper.

This is a great recipe which provides a lot of leftovers, which always come out great! We like more tomatoes with our pasta so I usually add an additional 1/2 to 1 can of italian diced tomatoes. I also carmelize some sweet onion with the beef which adds a little extra flavor!

I took out the zuccini and tomatoes due to picky eaters, but it turned out great! It was a little dry, probably because of taking the vegitables out, so I will probably add more broth next time to make it juicier. Overall a very good recipe and a good change of pace!

This was fantastic!  I did take some "artistic liberties" with it and added some pesto sauce to the hamburger when it was browning, as well as onions.  Fabulous flavor - my kids even liked it!

Excellent recipe.  Just as easy as Hamburger Helper, but much better tasting and more nutritious.  I used less ground beef (about a pound) and added onions to it while cooking.  Will definitely put this in my "keepers" file!

Easy meal. I added basil, onions, and garlic, but maybe too much ground beef. Tasty... leftovers the next day tasted just as good. Bachelor-friendly.

Dee-lish!!!  VERY basic ingredients & quick prep, too.  I didn't have any zucchini, but it still came out tasty!  That's why this recipe is so versatile - you can change or omit veggies & use whatever pasta you have on hand (just adjust cooking time accordingly.)

I used about double the broth that it called for..but it made it richer tasting.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  B/c of other reviews, I added garlic, green pepper and onion while I browned the meat.  I also used rotini pasta, b/c I had it on hand.  When I added the squash, I added fresh basil, and that was a hit.  Thanks for the recipe, we enjoyed making it our own!

I used yellow squash, carrots, and onions in mine.  Also, I added oregano, fresh basil and garlic powder.  As another reviewer suggested, I did add about two cups more water. And I didn't see any need to take the beef out when adding the veggies, it turned out fine. This was good because I used ingredients that I had on hand, including some of my garden veggies.

I don't know what took me so long to review...I have been making this for over a year and it is still in our regular rotation of meals. I add sauteed garlic and cook zucchini with beef for a minute or so before removing. We love this.

Wasn't as good as I was hoping it would be. It tasted like it needed something so I added a few different spices but it still didn't taste right. I substituted carrots for zucchini because I didn't have any. My daughter loved it but I'm not sure I will make it too often.

I love this easy and inexpensive recipe.  I make it often when my husband is travelling for business, as it reheats well for an easy lunch to take to work.  I only use 1 lb of ground beef and I leave the beef in the skillet while the noodles cook.  Very simple.

This is is a great idea for a meal in a pinch or when you're looking for something to do w/ that hamburg in the freezer. Extra broth may need to be added to keep the meal from drying out.

Made this for lunch today for me & the grands...we all liked it. I only used a lb of meat & that was more than enough... I used a can of diced tomatoes w/ green peppers, celery & onions, I added italian seasonings, couple of cloves of minced garlic, some dried onions & I did need to add more broth. I didn't see the point in removing the meat from the pan so I left it in & I used asiago cheese for the parmesan.

I must have made it wrong but this was horrible. The only flavor it has was the pepper that I had put in it. I even used fresh garlic in it. This was just very bland. I will not be making this again.

I thought this was okay.  I had high hopes for it and I really jazzed it up with onion, garlic, bell pepper and finished with a splash of red wine vinegar.  It was still a little bland and requires a good amount of salt to bring out the flavors.  Also I think adding some Italian seasoning would help.  Furthermore, 20 minutes is a long time to cook any pasta.  Overall, I may make it again, the Zucchini was really yummy.

I made this last night for my boyfriend and I and it was as other viewers suggested: good/average.  I added 1/2 onion and 1 clove of garlic to the beef as it cooked.  It also needed more water before I put the zucchini in.  It was fine, nothing spectacular, but completely edible.  I bet kids would like it and it is better for you than Hamburger Helper.

This was extremely easy to make, so kudos for that.  However I found it to be WAY bland.  We had to add so much seasoning to get any taste out of it.  garlic, basil, oregano, parsley, anything to make it smell somewhat enticiing.  Probably will make it in the future only based on simplicity.

This recipe was so easy.  My family really liked it. As I was cooking it looked like I might need to add another can of diced tomatoes.  I also threw in two cloves of garlic, italian dressing and two cans of tomatoe sauce to give it a thicker sauce.  The vegetable was a nice addition.  This is a quick, easy meal I will make again. Thanks!

The taste was pretty good, but five stars for EASY!  I used whole grain egg noodles instead, and   it worked wonderfully. I added 1/4 tsp garlic powder and a spoonful or so of minced garlic (bought in a jar at the grocery store).

This was pretty good and easy to make the zuccini was great tasting. I did add a few tablespoon of spagetti sauce and italian seasoning and garlic powder for flavor.

This was very tasty. My husband liked it and said it reminded him of "Hamburger Helper" because of the ground beef, pasta and sauce. But this is much healthier because it is made with fresh ingredients.

I agree with some of the others - pretty bland. I added onions, garlic, extra Italian season, red pepper flakes and more tomatoes, but next time I might try tomato or spaghetti sauce.

Pretty good, I have many recipies that use left over beef.  This one is tasty but not the best.  I think it depends on what you like.  This does not have that much flavor.

Great! Great! Great!  With such simple ingredients I was surprised at how much flavor it had.  I used fresh parmigiano-reggiano and it was wonderful!  If you have a chance do use fresh cheese instead of the pre-grated kind in the plastic shaker, it makes a difference.

This is my new favorite recipe.  So delicious.  I too added sauteed onion and garlic and waaaaaay more cheese.  I used fresh parm from a wedge.  Soooo good.  The person who thought to add zucchini was on top of their game because I didn't think I'd like it...but it was my favorite part!  Thank you!

I thought this dish was very good.  I sauteed a small onion and fresh garlic, added the beef along with dried thyme, basil and oregeno (since I didn't have italian style tomatoes).  When the beef was done, I added the broth, tomatoes, and pasta and cooked everything together.  I didn't add the zuchinni since the kids would turn up their noses and not eat it. The cheese added a wonderful creaminess.  It made a great dinner and I will definitely add it to my cookbook of recipes.

GREAT for college students or busy parents.  Cheap, nutritious, cooks quickly, infinitely variable, and uses common pantry items.  I often omit the meat because I usually don't have the foresight to buy any.  I also use plain tomatoes instead of the Italian-flavored kind and add my own spices to better control the taste.  I also add whatever vegetables I have on hand and usually omit the parmesan as well.

This was a quick and yummy Hamburger Helper meal.  I only used a pound of hamburger and added red pepper flakes and garlic salt for added flavor.  I cooked the zucchini for 10 minutes instead of five.

This was NOT Hamburger Helper, I did change a few items, 1/2 Italian Sausage & 1/2 Ground Beef, I added a large sweet onion sliced, 1 tsp chopped garlic, and to loosen the sauce about a 1/4 cup of red wine, other wise I followed the recipe to the letter. This is superb.

My boyfriend really liked it, but then again, he really likes everything!!  I followed advice of others and cooked an onion with the ground beef and also added an extra half can of beef broth.  It definately needed that extra half can, maybe even more.

I like it better if I add a small chopped onion and a clove of minced garlic to the meat. I omit the beef broth and cook the pasta sepratly. A family favorite - quick and easy.

Quick, healthy one pot meal.  It's good but does need more flavor.  Garlic, S&P and italian seasonings.  Goes great with garlic bread and if the kids liked mushrooms I would have added them.  Cooking time for me was longer.  All the moisture was evaporated before my pasta was cooked through so I added 1/2 cup of water, which seemed to be just enough to finish cooking out the pasta.

Quick and Easy to make...My husband was not crazy about this dish. He had to add a tons of salt and pepper. But everyone has different taste buds. Between the zucchini and tomatoes I felt like I was eating healtly. The only thing that I had to do is cooked the zucchini longer than 5 mins. I think I cooked it for about 10-15 mins. Other than that this was good.

Overall VERY good!  Made the following changes: sauteed onions and garlic with the hamburger, used Italian stewed tomatoes (with garlic, basil & oregano), added sliced mushrooms along with the zucchini, and added additional spices (basil, garlic salt, italian seasonings) during the simmer.  Came out great!  Loved that it only took one pan and you had pasta, meat and veges in one dish!  Will definately make again.

Very good! My whole family enjoyed it!
Like others, I made a few changes, too:
1 1/2 cans beef broth - added 1/2 can towards end of cooking time. Also added 1/4-1/2 tsp. of garlic powder and Italian Seasonings.
2 cups low-carb elbows - we love Bow Ties but low-carb is better.
Also added another cup or so of zucchini and cooked it separately with 1/2 medium onion, thinly sliced and 3 cloves of crushed garlic in olive oil. Hubby and I like zucchini, onion and garlic but our kids haven't grown to appreciate it - YET! It's a KEEPER!

Very good!  I added some garlic, parsley, oregano, basil, and black pepper.  I also threw in some sliced fresh mushrooms.  I ended up using a little less beef, extra pasta, and doubled the beef broth.  I would give this five stars if adapted like this.  Thanks!

Made this for dinner tonight and it was a big hit! Even my picky eater liked it. I boiled the pasta separatly and added it at the end with the zucchini. I also added a little more broth then called for and instead of diced tomatoes I added a cup of mild salsa. Very good!

This is a really tasty dish that I will make again.  Since some other reviewers said it was too dry, I just cooked it with the lid on.  I thought the finished product needed a little more seasoning, so I added some basil and oregano and it was perfect.

Absolutely delicious.  I followed the recipe but only used about 1 pound instead of 1 1/2 pounds ground beef.  I also only used 1/2 cup cheese and it was plenty for me.

This recipe quick, easy and tastes ok. My family found it a little bland. Next time I prepare this dish I will add some onion,garlic,black pepper,and maybe some oregano or basil. I think the cheese flavor needs some help. I did use freshly grated imported parmesan cheese but even it's strong flavor wasn't quite enough.

This was a great recipe. I didn't have the zucchini, but, I can see how it would be fabulous in it. I did add one extra cup of beef broth and my own italian seasonings because I only had regular diced tomatoes. And, as previous reviews commented, I added ground red pepper. Really, this is a great and easy recipe.

This recipe was really good, except that it needs ALOT more than 1 can of beef broth. It seemed to dry up fast, and once I added the beef back in, there wasn't even enough liquid to cover that. SO I added a 4 oz can of tomatoe sauce, and also seasoned my beef with garlic pepper...and it was BUENO! My husband, and 2 year old daughter loved it, too! Thanks:)

Pretty good, nice and simple. A little bland for my husband, but I liked it as is. Definitely had to add more broth and I also used a 28 oz. can of tomatoes. Added fresh garlic when sauteeing the beef and also added mushroom and onions. Used macaroni noodles. The noodles cooked well, but I think a little less pasta and more tomatoes. Definite comfort food.

This was fabulous. I used rotini instead of bowtie because it was what I had and I added my own spices instead of using Italian diced tomatoes. I also sauted the beef with a little garlic salt and some spices. This dish was tasty, and a complete meal all by itself.

Used only 1lb of beef, and didnt change anything else.  Still came out real good.  I think I could have enjoyed it more with either less beef or more pasta.

My whole family loved this recipe and it's easy and inexpensive.  Lots of ways to variate.  A great change from spaghetti.  The zucchini adds plenty of texture without changing the flavor.  I'll add the extra beef broth next time.

This is one of my favorites, definitely a summer time must.  It was a huge hit in my house, I think I've made it about 4 or 5 times now.  I used extra beef broth and tomatoes.

This is a good easy meal. I did add the extra can of beef broth and not tomato sauce because I think the goal is to make it more "beefy" than spaghetti-y. You can't even taste the zucchini (I quartered the slices) so it's a great way to sneak the veggies in the kids meal. I'm going to try it next time using the little bow-ties so it's easier for my toddler to eat.

My whole family loved this meal.  I took the advice of others (luckily) and added an extra can of beef broth.  I also added garlic and oregano for extra flavor.  I think next time I'll also add a can of tomato sauce of a little extra flavor, but will definitely make this again!

This recipe was delicious!  My husband and I ate the whole dish!  I did use 3 cups of beef broth for the extra liquid.  I will definitely make this one again.

Easy cooking meal.  You can't mess up.  My kids and husband request it often & prefer it over spaghetti.

I thought this was pretty good.  I did not add the zucchini since I don't like it.  It still had a nice flavor.  Next time I will add a can of tomato sauce to give it some extra zest.

Very good.  I wasn't sure after I read the recipe but it was excellent.  My daughter (5) wouldn't touch it though because of the zucchini

Great quick dish that doesn't require a lot of shopping!   I added garlic and onions as well.  I also subsititued corn for the zuccini since that was all I had in my cupboard.
