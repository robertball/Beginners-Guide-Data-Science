I made this for my husband and he loved it! It takes almost no time t make and gives chicken a different twist that we like.  Try it, you won't be sorry!

Made this for a potluck...took home an empty pan. The changes I made were....subbed cream of chicken for the mushroom and used ranch dressing in place of sour cream..  Delish!

I made as directed, but subbed out the fried Chinese noodles for crumbled rice crackers due to friends,and myself having a gluten allergy to wheat.I also used cream of celery soup instead of mushroom because I do not like the taste of cream of mushroom soup.Everyone said it was yummy! None made complaints as there was only a small amount leftovers remained in the pyrex pan.
