Excellent! I have tried many of molasses cookie recipes (because it is my son's Lewis's favorite cookie).  This is the best so far.

Great tangy, not-too-sweet, soft cookie. I doubled the spices and added cinnamon and it is just like a mini-ginger bread.

I didn't care for this cookie.  The batter was runny and it was difficult to keep the bottoms from burning. I had to lower my oven's temperature and reduce cooking time.  Also, they tasted bad, but it may not necessarily have to do with the recipe itself, maybe I just don't like molasses cookies.
