I didn't like this recipe. It was pretty bland prepared as written and it is really missing something. I'm sure you could mess with it and make it better, but I have other recipes that I would rather make instead of trying this one again.

I thought this was very good, although I did not use lower-sodium broth...I used regular. It seemed to add more flavor and I added two large bay leaves during cooking time. Was very well received by my family. I will be making this again.

Pretty good basic pot roast recipe, good for experimenting with. We took out the tomatoes/sauce, swapped low sodium for regular broth, added 1/3c of soy sauce, doubled the worty sauce, added 1/3c of lemon juice, and added 3 tbls of dried basil. Tastes fantastic!

I agree with amy, it was very bland, n was really missing something. I'm not real good at playing with flavors, so it was a waste of food and time and very dissapointing...
