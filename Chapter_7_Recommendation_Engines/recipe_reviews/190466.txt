I doubled this recipe for my two boys. I followed the recipe exact, only I sprinkled more brown sugar over the top, then poured a little milk over that in each bowl. They seemed to like it, even though my oldest boy said it needed more sugar. Next time, I'll make this with milk and add more brown sugar.

It's great! I didn't use the eggs and didn't have flax seed, but followed the recipe otherwise. What a wonderful dish to make when I'm not super hungry and need a smaller, tasty dish. To make it even better, add some honey on top! I also made this once with 2/3 cup milk instead of water - yum!

My kids are huge peanut butter fans so I was very happy to find this for them. I leave out the eggs but other than that follow the recipe and they love it! Great way to get some fiber and protein in them for breakfast without them realizing it.

Altho I eliminated the sugar and egg whites, it was still super delicious. This is one breakfast that's not only good, but so healthy and very filling! Thank you Meg!!

I really loved this.  I'm a huge fan of protein in the morning and thought this was fantastic.  I nuked mine for 5 minutes and it got a little too done for my taste so I'll try 4 minutes next time.  This was really good and filling in a way that doesn't bog you down at all.  Excellent!

This was delicious and very easy! I used a lower-calorie, low sodium peanut butter alternative (Better 'N Peanut Butter) and skipped the sugar with great results-- my calorie total was 171 calories. The only issue I had was that, after mixing in the PB and cinnamon, my oatmeal was too runny. It tasted better after having some time to thicken up (3-4 minutes). This is a great recipe that I'm sure I will make over and over again!

This is quick and easy - plus it's very filling for breakfast! I did however leave out the egg whites...it just didn't appeal to me.  I love peanut butter so the addition of it in oatmeal was wonderful.  Next time I might even add in some raisins, chopped banana, or apple.

I really enjoyed this!--if you like peanut butter and oatmeal, can't go wrong with this recipe.  Fast, yummy, healthy, and paired with a glass of skim milk--very filling, stick to your ribs kinda breakfast.

This was pretty good.  I didn't add the flax seed to it because my peanut butter already has flax oil.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it was good but not exceptional.

Love this recipe! This is usually what I eat pre-workout for breakfast. As a preference I use almond milk instead of milk and I like to use PB2 (peanut butter powder), 85% less fat than regular PB. Thanks Meg!!!

Made this for breakfast today.  Didn't add the salt or egg whites.  Used about 1 cup 1% milk not the water.  Next time I'm using natural peanut butter and adding a banana.  This makes a large bowl of oatmeal.

So yummy!  I changed a few things though.  I omitted the salt, egg whites, and brown sugar.  I used half Almondmilk and half water, Smuckers all natural peanut butter, about a 1/4 tsp vanilla extract, and 1 tsp honey.  I mixed all the ingredents together before cooking and then cooked it in the microwave for 2 minutes.  It was perfect, not runny at all.

A very interesting combination. Probably the creamiest oatmeal I've ever made. I subbed Splenda Brown Sugar and ended up using 2 large egg whites which = 1/4 cup, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.

Loved this for breakfast, so filling and good for you!.  I did leave the egg whites out and didn't miss them, but other than that I stuck with the recipe.  This is for a true peanut butter lover.  Thanks for sharing!

This was great but, I had to give it 4 stars because I knew I would have to tweek it a bit for my taste.
One I did use milk to cook mine up.  Second I don't have just egg whites so I used a whole egg and made up the difference with more milk. 
Third I had to bump up the brown sugar.
Other than that, this was a awesome recipe.  Will definitely make again and again.  Thanks

Delicious and healthy way to start the day! Love having all the protein with the peanut butter and egg white (I used one egg worth, which was apparently close enough to the 1/4 cup to work fine), which keeps me full all morning. Great taste, and super easy. Don't skimp on the 4 cup container or you'll have a messy microwave on your hands (apparently my bowls are not large enough...oops), and be sure to whisk the egg white thoroughly. Great stuff!

Ok, I love the combination of peanut butter and oatmeal like whoa.  
I admit I was really skeptical when I saw the egg whites.  But I thought, they must be there for a reason.  I decided to make it just as written the first time and it's phenomenal.  Doesn't taste like egg.  Has a perfect creamy texture and just the right amount of sweetness and peanut butter flavor.  

I omitted cinnamon because I don't like the combination of PB and cinnamon.  Really really amazing.  I could eat this every day.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated and I did not like it at all. It tasted eggy. My husband did like it so I am giving it 3 stars.

Guys, the egg whites aren't so bad in it!  Just mix it up a bit more with whatever liquid you're using.  It doesn't add an'eggy' taste!  I didn't have flax to add, though.

It was a great hearty breakfast. I made it with milk instead of just water. Next time I'm gonna try it with just a pinch of salt, because with this amount it was just a little too salty for my taste.

Healthy, quick and tasty. This recipe can easily be modified by using other nut butters and strring in other ingredients like nuts, fruit and yogurt. I like to use sunflower butter and stir in Greek yogurt just before serving.
