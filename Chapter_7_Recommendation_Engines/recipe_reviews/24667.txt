Everyone loves this dish! I also add a bottom layer of bean dip and thinly sliced green onion and diced tomatoes on top.

Halfed and made for a small dinner party and was disappointed to find it all eaten before I could get any.  Made it again the next day and am determined to finish the whole thing myself.  Put a layer of refried beans on the bottom and topped with extra pepper jack.

Although this was okay, it was certainly not a substitute for Mexican style queso.  Sorry, but even Velveeta makes a better dip.

YUMMY!  Very good and easy to make.  My 1 year old loved it.  It was her first taste of queso dip.  I left out the oregano and the salt and pepper.  It has a lot of flavor on its own.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  It would also make a great topping/sauce for burritos.

I doubled this recipe is a small crock pot on med/high for an hour, i skipped the taco seasoning and used a few tbs of salt free Mexican seasoning, then added and extra cup of pepper jack and a cup of a mixture of  diced red peppers, jalapeños, onions, red onions and the juice of one lemon.  It was a baby shower hit. I also added lots of fresh cilantro at the end!  I used on container of organic valley salsa and served it with chips and fresh pico.  people were inhaling it. 10 people ate a double batch!! Hit!!!!!

I needed a cold queso recipe for a large banquet. I decided to adapt this one. I left out the oregano but kept everything else the same. I didn't bake it, just blended everything together, chilled and served it with Fritos. It was wonderful! Four times the recipe served 250 people along with other appetizers.

Pretty good dip! I probably used more cheese on top than suggested, but it was sooooo yummy. Next time I'll use a 9x9 pan so the dip is a bit thicker, and put some chopped tomatoes on top after it's out of the oven.

This was okay.  I added some finely chopped hot peppers to up the ante a little.  Not a remarkable dip, but it did all disappear at the Oscars party!

Wow!! My husband and I tested this out for Super Bowl Sunday and it is amazing! I only made a few minor changes because I didn't have some things on hand. First, I made my own taco seasoning (Taco Seasoning 1 Recipe-also amazing) and then put some jalapenos in with the sour cream/cream cheese mix because I didn't have pepperjack cheese. For the topping I used three cheese Mexican blend with taco seasoning already on it. Everything else I followed to the letter and enjoyed it thoroughly. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!!

Yuck! I followed the directions. I thought it was just me so I took it to a gathering and brought home the almost the whole thing. No one else liked it either.

This is a great quick and easy dip.  I also add hot sausage to the cheese mixture.  That gives it a nice kick.  Doesn't last long around our house.

I have made this several times for parties and it's always gobbled up quickly.  Regular oregano works just fine as a sub for the Mexican-style.

This was an excellent recipe-however silly me forgot to put the salsa in it.  I did put refried beans on the bottom and everyone loved it-including my husband that is never that "thrilled" with anything new.  I can't wait to try it again with the salsa!

I rated and reviewed this recipe in 2004 but I had to go back and change my comment for the addition that I just made.  
I've made this for years when I have get-togethers as it's requested almost every time.  The last time I made it though, I changed it up and it was a hit!  I fried 1/2 lb of ground beef and drained it, added the taco seasoning to the ground beef and a small diced onion, fried until soft and put that at the bottom of a casserole dish.  I then put the cream cheese, sour cream, salsa mixture on top.  Very very good.

I made this for a potluck and everyone loved it. It was a big hit!! I did throw in half of a jalapeño finely diced and about 1/4 cup finely chopped red onion like someone suggested. I also added an extra cup of pepper jack cheese because of others comments and it did not seem like there was enough cheese.

I took this to a party and the oil from the cheese pooled on top - tasted OK but looked very unappetizing. Someone did ask for the recipe though (don't know if they're just being kind), so 3 stars, but I won't make it again.

I thought this was pretty good, it was almost like a base recipe where you can add other things to.  Next time I make it I will either add ground beef and maybe a little Franks sauce or cut the amount of sour cream in half.  I would also suggest mixing the shredded cheese in with everything else instead of putting it all on top.

Big hit at my family get together.  Only changes made were that I added a handful of 4-cheese Mexican blend shredded cheese to the dip itself and also spread some over top with the pepper jack cheese.

Everyone said they loved it, me, I thought it was just ok. I have other recipes that are similar, but better. Served it at a party with around 15 people, not even half of it was gone. When I make my other dip that is similar, it is gone within an hour. Sorry, won't make again

I halved the recipe but forgot to only use half of the salsa and it was still great.   My only suggestion is that you should only make at most half of this recipe.  Even only making half it was still a ton of dip.  I made it for a group of 12 (along with a few other appetizers) and I had more than half leftover (not because it wasn’t delicious!).

This was just ok. It is definitely missing something. It needs more substance, like refried beans or something. But, if you're going to put forth the effort to add more ingredients, you might as well make a nice seven layer dip.

In Texas, they sell something very similar to this in the store for $3.99 a pound!  This was incredible!  I added a little bit of the pepper jack cheese to the mix as well as topping it with pepper jack.

Everyone seemed to like this at my son's birthday party. It is on the spicy side. But pretty good.

What a terrific (and easy) dip this was to make.  Everyone loved it.  I would definitely make it over again.  Several people want the recipe, so I know it was a hit.

A good dip, a little different than some Mexican dips as it isn't as creamy and must be served warm as it'll harden up once it cools. We doubled the recipe and I'd say use a little less taco seasoning than what it calls for. Mixed the pepper jack cheese in instead of placing on top. Since we did that and doubled we had to split into two pans and bake for 25 minutes instead of 10 to warm all the way through. Still a very tasty dip!

"Queso" is a misnomer for this dip. Had it been called something else, I could have rated higher. Where was the cheesiness? This was simply a sour cream and salsa Mexican dip. I should have known better based on the ingredients, but I trusted the highly rated recipe would deliver on its title - Queso. About 15/16ths was thrown away.

I didn't  add salt to this. There was enough salt in the taco seasoning mix. The mixture looks pink and with the pepper jack cheese the contrasting colors don't look very appetizing but it did taste OK.
