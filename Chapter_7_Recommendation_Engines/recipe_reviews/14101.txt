Can't believe so many thought this a good way to roast peppers!! Had a huge bag full from my garden, so thought I would try this way (like to roast them and freeze for cooking through the winter). These turned out way too dry!! Will do the next couple batches my old way -- just cut them in half, remove the seeds and put them under the broiler for 6 to 10 mins. until blackened and blistered. I line a baking sheet with foil and just wrap it around them to cool before peeling.  Works great and no mess on the pan.

I freeze the roasted peppers in small amounts wrapped in Saran, then in a Ziploc, and use them all year.

These were excellent!  I've been buying roasted red peppers in a jar at $5 a pop!  Never again!  They were so flavorful and not dry at all.  I baked them on a cookie sheet lined with tin foil.  Once they were done cooking, I wrapped them in the tin foil to cool.  Super easy and full of flavor!

I put them under the broiler.  It took about 15 minutes for the skin to turn black.

I use the sweet, multicolored mini-peppers. Wash them and roast without removing seeds or membranes. They are perfect right out of the oven, no need to peel. Depending on your taste you might want to add a touch of salt. They are ready to eat or use in other recipes. (of course do not use or eat the stem.)

These turn out great every time!  Once I peel the skins, I melt a little feta cheese and pesto on them.  It's a great combination!

Great.  Served on top of the Tequila Lime Chicken recipe from this site for something a little different.  Make sure you let them get blackened all over or you will not be able to peel off the skins.

This recipe was very easy and the peppers came out great!  I used some of them in the hot artichoke and roasted red pepper dip recipe I found on this site.  That too is a huge hit at parties!  The rest went into yummy sandwiches.

quick, easy method to roasting peppers. I preheat oven to 400 degrees and place peppers on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper for easy clean up. When they are done roasting, about 20 to 25 minutes or until blackened.  I place them in a bowl cover with plastic wrap for a few minutes. this lets the steam help the skins peel off.

I used the broiler and roasted the peppers whole, wrapped in the foil I roasted them on until cool, then removed the seeds and skin easily. I like my method better b/c the peppers keep a lot of there oils and don't get dried out but this recipes is good also.

Excellent results. Very easy to do. The reviewer who ended up with dried up peppers probably left them too long in the oven. Since the peppers are quartered before being put in the oven, I only needed to cook them for about 20 minutes. The skin got scorched and the peppers were juicy and tender. The roasted peppers were put in a container immersed in garlic and olive oil. They can keep in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. So good with crusty bread!

These are delicious! I didn't do as many peppers. I cut them in half and removed the stem, membrains, and seeds. I baked them on an ungreased tray lined with foil. They stuck a tad, but I was afraid of the pan spray smoking. I stuck them in a small paper bag when done. However, I found out on the recipe buzz a piece of foil works over the top, of the cooling pan, or a piece of plastic wrap over a bowl to steam and cool for peeling. The downside of the recipe, is it takes so long! I was surprised that it took 30 minutes to roast the peppers. That means I would have to plan in advance. I am going to try it again under the broiler on low, to see if I get the same results. This is a great alternative to freezing those extra peppers. Thank you.

this was okay be cause clean up is going to be a pain. Next time I will use some foil for easy clean up! How ever I roasted some garlic as well as the peppers. Just watched the garlic more closely. Thanks, Happy Cooking!

This is an easy recipe that is also amazingly delicious!

A few changes:

1. This recipe is not restricted to just red bell peppers, I like to use red, yellow and orange-it makes a very colorful combination.

2. I don't cut them before I cook. Once they're roasted, the seeds come right out.

3. I actually love the taste of the skin, so I don't cook these quite as long, and instead just cut them up with the skins on.

A wonderful recipe, and always a huge success at parties!

I only had 3 peppers so that's what I did. I'm lazy so I just threw them in the oven on parchment paper. I agree with a previous reviewer that you get a more moist end product. Easier clean up too, since all the water is still inside the whole pepper.

Very helpful recipe for those newbies (like me) who'd never done roasted peppers before. I used mini bell peppers, which I wouldn't recommend because after roasting, a lot of the 'meat' is gone. BUT it was still really yummy. I roasted them & then used the Mediteranian Marinade also on Allrecipes (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/mediterranean-marinated-roasted-peppers/detail.aspx)
Absolutely delicious!

I used the advice of others cooking them on tin foil, then wrapping them in the foil while they cooled, and they came out perfect.  I used in a risotto the following day, and the flavor was outstanding.

Based on the reviews below, I added a couple tsp of EXTRA VIRGIN (very low burning level) oil to each pepper (using a brush). They turned out perfectly, when I used the 'concept' of this recipe as the basic how-to. They turned out perfectly!

Easy way to make some good roasted peppers.  I rubbed the skins with vegetable oil before roasting and placed them in a Pyrex bowl with a lid to steam.  Skins came off easy and the peppers added great flavor to stir fry!

I make these all the time using olive oil cooking spray.  After I have peeled them I put in dish with some minced garlic.  Cover and let the juices seep out and I have healthy roasted peppers!!!

Delicious and easy. The skin comes off nicely and the flavor is wonderful. I cut my peppers so they would lay flat on my baking stone.

Easiest  recipe ever. I will never have to resort to store bought again which in addition to being a great savings means I can fix them just the way the family likes.
Now I have a great way to use up some of the peppers I will be harvesting this year.

I made this yesterday, first time roasting peppers and I was very happy with the end product.  It was simple easy and quick.
The only thing I did different was that I choose to leave the peppers whole while roasting after reading another reviewers suggestion.  
They seemed to be done in no time at all. Then after cooling I was able to take seeds and skin off with little effort.

Attempted this last night and ended up with an apartment full of smoke--probably from the olive oil (per the suggestion of other reviews). The end result was tasty.

They tasted great in a recipe that called for roasted peppers. Instead of buying the already made peppers, I looked up recipes and found this one to be the easiest and it turned out great!

Roasted several pounds of my garden pepper harvest. They turned out excellent!  Moist and full of flavor. Will freeze a majority of them but looking forward to a roast pepper, eggplant and tomato salad with dinner tonight

I had some red and yellow peppers that would have gone bad in a few days,  so I did this immediately.  My house smells awesome and they came out beautifully.  Not dried out at all.

Perfect once cooled and fixed with olive oil, salt and oregano! Freeze well too, but lose their firmness. I prefer them that way.

I have been using the broiler for years to blister my peppers. The oven method much easier.  After cooking I marinate peppers with salt, pepper , garlic and olive oil.  As usual very good. Thanks for the tip on using the oven for roasting.

Love the simplicity.  I removed it too early form the oven so the skin wasn't blistered enough and made it hard to completely remove but was still good.

I agree with DIANE! I laid out my peppers on foil, broiled them for 10 minutes,  and wrapped them up in the foil to cool... and they are perfect!! For sure only cut them in larger flatter pieces for more even roasting and easier peeling. And note to self yellow peppers take longer to roast than red.

I tried it with hot peppers, producing a delightful condiment with wonderfully smooth intense heat, simply marvelous on or under almost anything.. With hot peppers, of course, do take care clean up after, not have too much contact and keep from sensitive places.  I found it a marvelous addition to even my breakfast fruit, though that was quite unintentional picked up from the cutting board I forgot I'd used... ;-)
