I didn't have habernero peppers...used japaleno and hot banana peppers. Also added minced onion. We like things spicy and these fit the bill. Will be making these a lot!

One of my favorite burgers to date.  You can make it as spicy or not as you would like to.  We made our very spicy, but when we have company over and serve them, we cook up the "less spicy" batch.  The only change I made to the recipe is the amount of garlic.  I reduced it by 1/2.  A really enjoyable meal.

This is a great burger. Since I discovered it in July 2002, I have made it several times. I now make up a batch every so often and freeze them in FoodSaver bags. Now when I am in the mood for a spicy burger, I just take one out of the freezer and slap it down on the grill. In 20 minutes it is ready, just the way I like it.

And since I have grown my own Jalapeno peppers this year, this recipe is even better.

I first shared this with my buddies in July at our Annual Boys Night Out. I can tell you this is a tough crowd to please, and they all loved it.

A simple yet delicious way to get some good 'hot' barbeque.  My wife and I both love hot foods and this was really simple to prepare and tastes great.

These were pretty good burgers.  Since it is just myself and my husband, we cut the recipe in half to make 4 burgers - and froze 2 of the patties for another day.  The only thing we did differently was substituted 2 cayanne peppers from our garden for the fresh peppers in the recipe.

Super delicious burgers.   I didn't have a habanero but added more jalapeno, poblano and pepper flakes.   I topped the burgers with white cheddar and served them on grilled pepperoni & cheese focaccia bread with chipotle mayo. 

EXCELLENT and juicy!!

Very good! I added a bit of kosher salt to the mix and sprinkled a bit on the outside of the patties before grilling. I was careful to remove all the seeds and ribs and the burger turned out flavorful, but not spicy at all. Next time I'll definitely leave a little of the ribs in for more kick. Having a slap/chop type of tool makes quick work of the peppers (and garlic if using fresh). Thanks for a tasty recipe!

Very good and juicy burger. Me and my wife love spicy food so we add a couple extra habanero peppers to the mix, but when other people are over we tone it down a bit. Overall though very good recipe.

One of the best burgers I've ever grilled. A very spicy flavor that increases with every delicious bite. The cumin and cilantro give a great flavor. This burger is NOT for people who cant handle spicy foods.

Keeper Burger recipe for sure! Used 5/8 pasilla pepper instead of Poblano pepper as that was all we had at our Cali grocery store and it seemed so similar. Burgers were GREAT!! Although, he expected more spiciness.. I thought it was the perfect amount of hotness and spice combo however.

We make these burgers very often.  It is not as spicy as they seem.  They are tasty but still have a bit of heat to make it an enjoyable experiance.

these burgers just saved my marriage. actually, i'm not married, but if i was, i could see their awesomeness having that effect. the habanero is a must (maybe even add extra), and i would highly recommend adding a slice of jalapeno cheese to top it all off. i've been looking for a good burger recipe to experiment with dried bhut jolokia, and i think i'll be substituting the habanero for that next time.

This is one of the best burgers I've ever eaten!  I love jalapeno burgers when we eat out, just never thought to mix them in on my own.  Loved the cilantro in this!  Excellent recipe, thanks Tom.

Ooooooo, wheeeee these are hot...but I love it.

I actually added diced red onion, Ancho Chili Powder, and topped with a pineapple slice and a little sweet BBQ sauce.  Good Stuff.

I only made three servings so of course I adjusted some things to my taste... I added 2 habaneros for two reasons: I couldn't find any pablano peppers in the store, and I also like my food spicy.

I accidentally used a the full serving of Cumin, which made that taste come out a little to strong.

However everything turned out pretty good overall - next time I think I will add a habenero per serving and go lighter on the cumin.

I have made these burgers four times now for large cookouts, and they never fail to impress. I have discovered that they are not as hot as they would seem to be by looking at the recipe, so I usually split the meat after mixing and add a second habanero and a couple of jalapenos to half the mixture. This makes my friends and I that really like super-spicy foods much happier.

Super tasty! I put in all the peppers and included the habanero pepper but I really didn't notice any spice, just really good flavor without the heat. I don't know if I just got dud peppers or if my burgers were too thick or something. Either way, these were delicious!

Not too spicy but awesome flavor.  I used 1.5# of ground chuck to make the burgers a little bigger and used half of the other ingredients listed.

I made this for a work cook out. I definitely believe on getting to peoples good side through their stomachs! This was definitely a crowd-pleaser.  The guys ate them up! I added a little bread crumbs for a softer texture.

If you like hot and spicy foods then this burger is just for you.  My family loves it and I have made it several times.  I do add minced onions to the mix.

It was really easy to make and taste delicious not so spicy for me and my family were used to spicier food. Next time I'm going to try and double on the habanero. But other than that delicious.
