I personally thought this was a great recipe... with way to much coconut! Only people with a huge sweet tooth would like the amount of coconut listed in the recipe. I would recommend about a 1\4 cup instead of a 1\2. Besides that, this was a great recipe that I frosted a crazy cake (from all-recipes too) with! Thanks!
