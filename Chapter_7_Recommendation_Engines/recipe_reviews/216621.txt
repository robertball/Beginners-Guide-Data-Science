This was the first time I made hummus at home and it was yummy. I did not add soybeans and the soy sauce. I did add 1/4 tsp of cumin and 1/8 tsp of red pepper, which added more flavor.

I am in limbo about this one. I really liked the beans when they were done. The cook time and method was perfect. Only change I made was using 1/2 onion, as I had one large sweet onion. I thought the beans were perfectly cooked and to be honest I liked them straight out of the pot. they would have been good in soup or even on a salad. I never had a fresh cooked chickpea, what a difference. Now about the hummus, I did not care for it at all! The tahini taste is just overwhelming. Maybe, some brands are more light tasting then others, I don't know. The onions could also be tasted and gave it a boiled onion after taste. It was way too thick too. Now, I have 3 full cups that no one will eat. I wish very much I would have just tested a portion of the beans. To top, I have a very good mixer and I thought it was going to burn the motor. I smelled an odor as it tried to blend this stuff. I wish this would have worked, and it didn't get tossed, but at least I know how to cook beans in my pressure cooker. My rating is for the actual hummus. I would only make half of it, at a time, to get the flavor desired and use the best tahini possible.

This is the best hummus I've had. Thank you for posting a pressure cooker recipe that works perfectly. I soaked the beans overnight and reduced the amount of time cooked, ate them right out of the pan and had to make myself stop so I'd have enough to make hummus :)

Really quite easy.  Pressure cookers are great!  I want to play around with more additions to the hummus...more garlic, roasted tomatoes, pine nuts, etc

I love the fresh cooked beans.  I do not add onion as I like a more traditional hummus.  I also add less tahini but I know that is a "to taste" issue.  Also I add a pinch of cayenne for some kick.  Soy sauce sounded off to me so did not add That either.
