6.29.18 This is such an elegant finish to a really nice meal. Some times simple is best and that s one of the things that makes this dessert so special. Creamy rich but somehow still light mellow smooth slightly sweet just fantastic! I d serve to this to anybody without hesitation. Annette thanks for sharing this one s a keeper.

Delicious. Made it with cherries I had frozen for smoothies chopped in half.

I made the recipe as indicated but I used Premium pie filling.  I also put in a pie crust as it was easy to present and cut portions both large and small

This was really good and made in just a few mins! I only used one and a half cups of cherries and they were frozen cherries cut into fours. I also used Stevia instead of sugar. And then I drizzled just a tiny bit of chocolate syrup on top. Wow! Really good. Thank you for sharing :)

It was a big hit. I cut the sugar a bit.
