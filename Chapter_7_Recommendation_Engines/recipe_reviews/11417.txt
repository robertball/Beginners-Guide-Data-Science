This recipe is really, really good. No changes needed - some members suggested less sugar or sugar-free preserves, but I thought everything was just right (and I don't like overpoweringly-sweet things.) Took about 8 minutes longer to cook than the recipe says, but it makes quite a few. I will make this again!

These are very good and easy to make! I used the dark chocolate chips and reduced-sugar raspberry jam instead, and they came out fantastic! The low-sugar preserves add a little bit of tartness to the otherwise-very-sweet cookie bar. Family loved it, would definitely make these again.

Very yummy, followed the recipe with the minor exception of using butter flavored shortening since that is all I had on hand -- if I were to make again I would probably reduce the chocolate chips to a cup and a half as they took over a little bit and I would probably like to taste a little more cookie and raspberry.

This was a hit and really easy to make.  I used white chocolate chips which went well with the raspberry.

Definitely sweet...I used 1 cup of white chocolate chips and 1 cup of milk chocolate chips.  I only had half a cup of raspberry jam, so I used half a cup of blackberry jam to make up the difference.  If I make these again, I may cut back the chocolate chips to 1 and 3/4 cups because the bars were very sweet.

It's basically a Toll House bar with jam.  It was nice, but my family preferred the cookie without the raspberry.

This recipe is a keeper. The red from the jam shows through the top crust and looks nice. Chocolate and raspberry together, how can you go wrong?

Absolutely delicious.  I used my home canned raspberry jam.  The people at the meeting loved it, seeds and all.

07.10.17 ~ I have a TON of jelly,  jams and conserves on hand.  I'm trying to find lots of recipes to use it up.  This recipe was loved by all who tried it.  I made as written and realized I forgot to add the shortening.  It was sitting right next to the bowl and I forgot it.  I added it as the very last step, hoping the recipe would still work as the shortening wasn't creamed.  As you can see, it worked perfectly.  I used a jar of raspberry conserves and just eyeballed the amount making sure the bottom layer was covered.  I wish I would have used more dough on the bottom so that it would have had a more marbled appearance. To help spread the bottom layer, I sprayed a little cooking spray on my hand so that the dough wouldn't stick while I tried to spread it.  It worked great.  

 I made these for Girl's Night Out and they devoured them.  I also shared with a few other people and all the comments were positive.  I will be making these again to help use up my overflowing stash of jelly.

These were amazing, although addictive.
Every time I went into the kitchen I had to eat one!

I dont know if I have done justice to the recipe by changing some ingredients as i was short to those.Added chunks of 1/2 cup of  milk chocolate and fresh raspberries 1/4 cup ,and 1  chopped granny smith  apple and 1/2 banana , and folded all with black raspberry jam .added margarine instead of butter and shortening, my husband found it very mouth-watering and yummy.And  just served it with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream and fresh raspberries.with a drizzle of chocolate syrup. thanks alot!!

Yum!  How can you go wrong with a combination like raspberries and chocolate?  I used homemade low-sugar raspberry jam in mine and they turned out fine.  I think next time I might even increase the amount of jam from 1 cup to 1 1/2 cups.  Delicious!

I really liked the combination of chocolate and raspberry. They were kind of too sweet to my family's taste, though.

I used fresh mashed raspberries with a bit of sugar and the cookies were excellent.
Everyone raved about them...even the most picky cookie taster.
I definitely recommend them.

This was a big hit with family and friends.   Sugar free preserves and half the chocolate chips prevents it from becoming overly sweet.

Great recipe. Gooey when warm. Next time I may add some frozen raspberries and sub out some of the white flour for whole wheat.

Great, easy, flavorful.  I married the "cookie monster" and it's difficult to keep him in a variety of goodies.  This is a keeper!
