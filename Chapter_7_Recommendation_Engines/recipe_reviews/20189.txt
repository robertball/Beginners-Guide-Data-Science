I think the trick is, you need to fold the whipped cream INTO the chocolate. (the recipe says to add the chocolate to the cream) And I added a teaspoon of sugar to the cream before whipping. Whipped till soft peaks formed and then melted the chocolate in the microwave at 45 second intervals. Put a big dallop of whipped cream into the chocolate and fold in (this should temper the chocolate instead of shocking it and making it chunky), add more spoonfuls of cream gently folding until it's all incorporated. Hopefully that will provide a better consistency for everyone that's having trouble getting it smooth.

I had this finished under 15 minutes! I altered only slightly using semisweet chocolate chips (melted in microwave), I added 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and 2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar to the cream. After adding the chocolate (still warm)to the cream, I re-whipped for approx. 2-3 min. I topped off with a thin layer of whipped cream, and threw on a marachino cherry cut in half (rinsed in cold water to prevent bleeding). I had a to hide these in the fridge while they set! Excellent, now I have to make more or be nagged all night - good thing it's quick and easy!

Tastes great!  It doesn't look so great, though.  Hopefully others can learn from my mistake.  I cooled the chocolate as directed.  In the meantime I chilled the bowl and whisk I was going to use to whip the cream.  DON'T DO THAT.  When  I went to fold in the chocolate, it hardened too quickly because of the chilled bowl etc.  It made little chocolate bits through, instead of a consistent chocolate flavored mousse.  I'm sure the recipe would have turned out great had I not done that.  I suspect my family will love this special Valentine's Day dessert anyway!

This recipe was so good.  I've tried more complicated recipes but none were near as good as this one.  I wanted an eggless mousse recipe because I have small children that would be eating it.  Couldn't believe the flavour from such an easy recipe.  For those who live in Western Canada, I used Purdy's milk chocolate in this.  I'm just trying to keep my spoon out of before my guests arrive for Easter dinner tonight!  I put it in Martini glasses and topped it with a little whip cream i reserved.  I also thought it would be nice next time to fold in chocolate shavings.

This was SOOOOO good!  Thanks aton! I don't really like using gelatin or raw eggs in my mousse, so this was a great alturnative. And it isn't too sweet! Thanks!  Would highly recommend. P.S. microwave choc. chiops for about 30 sec. then ster, then put it in for another 30 sec and it should be melted!

WOW I'm in heaven!  So easy, so quick, so divine!  Definitely add the whip cream to the chocolate 1 scoop at a time to prevent clumpies...heck, bring on the clumpies, it's all good!  I have used whatever chocolate I can find - even plain chocolate chips...

This was delicious, but it was difficult to get the right consistancy.  If it is chilled to long it is very thick and not long enough it is too light.  Still lovely.

Easy to do, but not the best result ever. Definitely only refrigerate for about 30 minutes prior to serving - otherwise you end up with a block of dark chocolate.

Easy tip:  Add some heavy cream to the chocolate while it's melting and use a whisk to blend it together.  Then, place the melted chocolate/cream mixture in the refrigerator for a few minutes, stir and return to fridge for a few more minutes and then remove and stir again.  Next, spoon a little of this into the whipped cream and use an electric mixer to blend together.  Repeat until all chocolate is blended into whipped cream.  No chunks this way. Now, I added a packet of unflavored gelatin to the melting chocolate to make the texture more "mousse-like" and less like pudding.  I also added a little rum extract to the chocolate for a more authentic flavor. Very tasty.

Thank you Polly Welby for this recipe. I got raving reviews from my family and it was easy to make! I used semisweet chocolate chips though which made it almost taste like custard or ice cream. Really good. I used the advice on microwaving choc. (30 sec, stir, 30 sec) and it worked nicely. My family also enjoyed the touch of cherry and choc. shavings. Thanks again. I would make this again for special occasions.

As written, this recipe is only 3 stars for me. With bittersweet chocolate it turned out too rich and a little on the bitter side. To get the mousse as fluffy as possible, fold the whipped cream into the chocolate a little at a time, not the other way around. Even then though the mousse wasn't as light as traditional ones are. If you make this it's best to eat it right away! If you chill it for more then 15 minutes you'll end up with a block of crumbly chocolate, which isn't all that nice. For a good eggless mousse use semisweet chocolate and a bit of vanilla. But really, I prefer the real thing.

This turned out badly for me. I used extra dark chocolate, and followed the recipe exactly except for folding the cream into the chocolate rather than the other way around. I don't know what went wrong after that. I guess 30-40 minutes was too long for it to chill because it had the consistency of truffle filling. It was also much too bitter... it DEFINITELY needed some sugar.

Delicious! I was drawn to this mousse recipe - as it does not contain raw eggs! I read the reviews and made the following adjustments to the recipe - I whipped up a 12 oz. container of whipping cream (reserve 2 tbsp). While it was whipping I melted the chocolate with the 2 tbsp. of reserved whip in intervals of 20 seconds. When melted, I took the advise of others and folded in about i cup of whipped cream into the chocolate mixture - to lighten it up. (They do this same process with mouse with raw eggs - by folding in some whipped egg whites into the chocolate mixture before folding all the chocolate in). Then I folded the chocolate mixture into the whipped cream - ensuring air is maintained in the mixture and did not mix it. I also rewhipped the whole chocolate mixture for another 1 1/2 minutes. I used this mouss in two ways - I served some for dinner with whipped cream and chocolate syrup! It was delicious! I have also made this recipe as a filling in between two layers of a "Giant Chocolate Chip Cookie" Birthday Cake(from this website) and froze it - it was fantastic both ways! UPDATE - I made this again and served it half frozen in "Chocolate Dessert Cups"

What an easy recipe!!  I took the advice of another reviewer and folded the cream into the chocolate.  I also added bit of vanilla extract and icing sugar to the cream while I whipped it.  It turned out beautiful with whipped cream, a sliced strawberry and sprig of mint on top.  Extremely rich, but oh so delicious!!  I can't wait for my friend to try it tonight.  Ok as an addendum to my original rating.  I've just checked it in the fridge and yes, like other reviews....it is way more solid than mousse should be.  Darn it.  I'm sure it'll taste good though.

I use this mousse as a cake and cupcake filling.  It is so easy and so delicious!  I add the chocolate to the whipped cream and then continue to mix with the mixer.  I could never get it smooth when mixing by hand.

This just didn't turn out for me.  I doubled the quantity to make 8 servings, followed the recipe to a T, and ended up with a bitter product with the consistency of spackle.  Even my 8 yr. old who loves mousse delcared it "not good."  I used expensive Ghiradelli chocolate.  Sorry!

Excellent is an understatement. Soooo easy and delicious!  I used 8 ounces Baker's brand semisweet chocolate and it was just perfect! Deep chocolate flavor and not too sweet.  I put the mousse in single size pre-made graham cracker crusts, chilled and topped with whipped cream and a drizzle of chocolate sauce.  This was a huge hit with the kids and the hubby.  This is so easy, I'll be making it quite often!

This is an excellent chocolate mousse to make for kids (no raw eggs).  I have altered the recipe a bit--I make chocolate ganache and fold it into the whipped cream.  This prevents the forming of chocolate chips in the mousse because the ganache will not harden like the melted chocolate.

People always love this. As others have mentioned, add the cream to the chocolate to keep the chocolate from hardening. I used semisweet chips too. If you want something really gourmet looking, add some raspberry sauce and a dollop of whipped cream with a mint leaf.

Apparently having whipped cream that is even slightly chilled is a bad idea for this. The texture is certainly lacking, specifically the lumps. I was planning to use this as a filling for a cake, and I believe it'll still work, but beware! Don't let your whipped cream be cold at ALL before folding it into the chocolate. :/

I chose this recipe b/c I'm pregnant and needed a no-egg mousse.  The other reviews helped a lot!  I also folded the whipped cream into the chocolate.  There were a few lumps at the end, but it still tasted wonderful!!  I put a garnish of whipping cream on top with thinly sliced limes and lemons that I sugared.

This was so easy!  I've never made mousse before and it came out perfect.  Per some of the other reviews, I added 1.5 tb of sugar (I scaled the recipe back to 2 servings, so if you made it in it's original form, you would use 3 tb). I also made sure to add the chocolate slowly.  Once the cream was whipped, I added one dollop of chocolate and mixed for 15-30 seconds until blended.  I repeated this 3-4 times until the chocolate was gone.

Simple and absolutely delicious!!!! I followed Josie's Mom's tip of folding the whipped cream into the chocolate and it worked a treat! It was a little dense (I may have over whipped the cream) but still fantastic. If you have these two ingredients it's perfect for a sudden craving as it's so quick to make! Thank you!

After reading most of the reviews, I changed the qtys a little bit. I reduced the amount of chocolate. By doing this, the mixture didnt become rock hard even after 2-3 days in the fridge! I served it with fresh strawberries and everyone enjoyed it!

As far as I know this is the most delicious mousse in the history of the world, but I thought I'd point out that if you are the "one greedy person" who has all four servings you will be ingesting 186 grams of fat, including 115 grams of saturated fat. That is all.

This was delicious! This was my first time making mousse and it was a hit!! I made it for my boyfriend, sister and brother-in-law. I added a dollop of whipped cream and blackberries as a topping. The tartness of the berries complimented the mousse very well. Everyone raved!

Utterly Scrumptious! I was making a cake at the request of my daughter for her birthday .. and this coccoons two delicious layers of "Chocolate Lovers Torte". As I have 1, 3 and 4yo's, I needed a recipe without raw egg. This was perfect, and really yummy to boot. I sprinkled "flake" chocolate over the top of the cake so its a real hit! I have used Cadbury's Dark Chocolate being in Australia.

Great easy recipe, reading many of the reviews I did a few things. I did half milk chocolate half dark (60%) chocolate chips added a couple of teaspoons of cream and some rum to the melted chocolate. Julia I added gelatin, I can see why and most likely will next time. I also put about 3 teaspoons sugar in whip cream and added whip cream to the chocolate, used a whip to blend gently. Since my husband didn’t want the mouse when it was ready with many comments about when refrigerated it got hard I put mousse into a ready-made chocolate pie crust (less one serving I ate!) and topped with whip cream. Really easy, fast, if you are a chocoholic – this is definitely for you. Follow up - the next day – the mouse did not get hard like several reviewers experienced, made a soft mouse pie – must have been the couple of teaspoons of cream I put in the melted chocolate. When adding the cream in the melted chocolate the texture did not stay smooth and I got a little concerned. However as I added the softly whipped cream everything smoothed out nicely.

Tastes great (of course--how can you really go wrong with chocolate and fat?) but the visual appeal is somewhat lacking.  It looks like a really fast, shortcut recipe, which, ultimately, it is. Not something I would necessarily want to serve guests, but it is a perfectly speedy satisfy-my-guilty-choco-cravings-alone dessert.

I made this mousse for a party I recently had and everyone loved it. I made some extra whipped topping and used an 8oz Hershey's Symphony plain chocolate bar. Melted it in microwave as the other users suggested and you absolutely have to fold the cream into the chocolate to get it smooth. I mixed just a bit of sugar and cinnamon into leftover cream that I had and put a glob on top of mousse. Chilled for 15 minutes, then drizzled with a tad bit of hot fudge right before serving. Absolutely wonderful!

Extremely easy to make and delightfully delicious. Added the cream to the chocolate instead of  vice versa to help with consistency issues. One note: It is better to eat this fresh than letting it sit in the fridge. It will start to harden very quickly and become more like ice cream.

I just had to try this last night and it is well worth it. When I was measuring out the cream I noticed that it was already sweetened (it's been a long, long time since I bought cream). I used good chocolate and melted it in a 4 cup pyrex measuring cup in the microwave. I took the advise of another reviewer and folded dollops of cream into the chocolate and it worked perfectly. I put some of this on top of a cheesecake I had made and it was delicious.

This had a great chocolate flavor going into the serving dishes.  It was a great consistency and I was so pleased with the looks of the dessert as well.

Fast forward to actually eating the dessert.  It got so hard that I could have used an ice cream scoop to dip it.  It also made the texture really thick.  It became inedible after a few hours in the fridge.  We ended up throwing it away.
I will not make this recipe again.  Sorry!

My only complaint was that the melted chocolate did not incorporate well into the whipped cream.  Flecks and chunks remained, although my husband thought it was good that way.  I think that if the melted chocolate was warm (not cool) and very slowly drizzed into the cream, then it would have mixed together better.

I tried to make this for my first Valentine's Day with my husband, and it did not turn out at all.  The chocolate cooled immediately upon being added to the whipped cream, and there were little chocolate chunks throughout the mousse.  It tasted like chocolatey butter, almost, and looked very unappetizing.

I agree with one of the previous reviewers (wish I had read the reviews first!) that the consistency is hard to get right.  I also chilled my bowl and whisk, and the chocolate cooled too quickly making little chocolate bits in my cream.  It still tastes great, just doesn't look so nice.

Super easy to make and allows you to change it up.  I melted some Ghiradelli peppermint bark into the chocolate and it was so good,but definitely do as others suggested and fold the chocolate into the whipped cream. ! Can't wait to try some other add-ins like orange or raspberry liqueur.

I used 8 oz whipping cream and 3 oz. Lindt 70% BlackBerry bar. Melted in microwave. Had no problems with clumping. If you let chocolate cool too much or cream is super cold- it will probably clump. My chocolate was still warm and cream not freezing cold. You should be able to drizzle chocolate.If you do get clumps whip it with mixer and whisk attachment. Note: You can melt chocolate and cream together. Let chill well- then whip the whole thing ie: whipped chocolate gnache ?!?

I seen reviews were ppl think its too thick. I have an alternative,first however much chocolate you want to use.use 4more oz. of heavy cream, for instances I use 8ozchoco. to 12oz cream. Secret, Do Not whip cream! Only melt chocolate, stir a few times to let out heat, then by thirds, add the heavy cream, until blended, put in fridge for 45mins to a hour, when you take this out it will look like a chocolate pudding, now its time to whip out the whisk!! Whisk this pudding mixture until its turns lighter in color and thicken, and yes please do this by hand , the electric mixer at this point will make it quickly turn to chocolate butter. After the whisking place in serving dishes and chill now for at least 2 hours, you will see this way it does not harden into a brick, it stays light airy ,smooth ,creamy even after 2 days in fridge . I liked the recipe above, but this one I gave is more like the traditional mousse, much lighter.

I feel bad rating this so low, but I don't consider this "mousse" at all, once it is chilled anyway, as per the directions.  Now I know why another reviewer said you could use the leftovers as truffle filling...it thickens up a lot (obvious now to me, because of the chocolate).  Maybe served immediately it would be mousse-like, but then it won't be cold like you would expect either.  And the texture after chilling, while I managed not to get any chocolate clumpage, ended up weird as well, not light and smooth/creamy.  I will keep searching for another eggless mousse.
