You don't even need an oven for this. What my kids and I do is make this in the microwave. I take one graham cracker half, stick a piece of Hershey's chocolate (or sometimes a Reese's cup) on top of the graham cracker, then the marshmallow on top of that. I place it on a heat-safe plate and nuke it until the marshmallow starts to puff. After you take it out of the microwave, you stick another half on top of the hot marshmallow. Instant S'Mores! S'Mores is so much better with cinnamon grahams-----and CHOCOLATE grahams!

I sometimes like to use vanilla wafers or other cookies instead of graham crackers.

This is a nice recipe for s'mores when you don't want to or can't cook s'mores over the campfire. There is no cleanup either, so I am happy to make these most anytime!  I miss the crispy coating on the marshmallows from the fire, but you can't have everything!

These are really good. I am going to send the ingredients along to college with my granddaughter, so she can wrap them in waxed paper and put in microwave to melt the marshmallow.

Delicious! Loved changing this classic up with the cinnamon graham. Did not wrap in foil and bake though....made these s'mores the old fashioned way. Thanks!

These came out perfect! You don't get the smoky marshmallow flavor from the campfire, but the marshmallow melts perfectly!
