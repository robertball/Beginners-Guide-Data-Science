This may not be pretty, but oh my, did we like this!  My first time eating "baked oatmeal," and it was the bomb.  Not only does this taste divine, it also breaks down pretty well nutritionally.  Another nice thing about it is if made the night before, it's one of those "grab & go" breakfasts on your way to work.  It was completely cooked at 45 minutes, so do watch your time.  It was so good that I could eat this for dessert.  This one's a keeper!

This simple recipe has become my go-to  breakfast and snack recipe.  I make it in the evening when I have extra time.  After baking, I let it cool completely before slicing it and storing it in a container in the fridge.  It is a quick bite to grab in the morning or any time I'm craving a snack.  It keeps well in the fridge and can be eaten cold or warmed.         Two modifications to the mix that make this even more enjoyable are to add 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and to substitute 2 teaspoons of loose brown sugar for the pinch of white sugar.

As is the recipe is a great base, starter  recipe though was not sweet enough for my family. I wanted a true grab & go breakfast, which this one isn't intended to be.  I use a 9x13 glass pan and double all of the ingredients (left out the baking powder because it didn't seem to make a difference) added 1/2 cup milled flax seed, about 1 tbsp cinnamon, two egg whites, 2 tsp vanilla, and 3 Tbsp brown sugar substitute (ex: Splenda). Bake for 1 hour 15 mins, cool in pan, cut into 10 bars, wrap bars individually.  pop in microwave for about 35 seconds for a grab and go breakfast.  try using different combinations of dried fruits and spices such as cardamom and pears or apricots with cloves and nutmeg.

I used two eggs, 1/4 cup sugar and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon; no nuts.  Baked in convection oven for 55 minutes, should have done 50.   De-lish!  Will make again.

I made this recipe as posted.  I found it to be bland and gummy. It went into the trash. I will not make it again.

This recipe looked good so I tried it. Because of my sweet tooth I added sugar and used frozen blueberries because I had them in stock. I ate half the 9 x 9 and refrigerated the rest for tomorrow morning.  Cream and maple syrup or brown sugar are both an excellent topper. This is not a quick breakfast for on the run folks but make it ahead of time and reheat.
Congrats Robelano,

This is different from regular breakfast meals. Very easy to make. I assembled everything the night before and tossed it into the oven in the morning. Nice texture and slightly sweet.

Have to say these were pretty bland. Would add more sugar or brown sugar, maybe some vanilla & cinnamon.

Instead of cranberries, coconut, and nuts, I added extra sugar, bananas and cinnamon. It was awful!  The base was bland, unsweetened mush.

I found this bland.  I did make some changes: I switched out dates in place of the cranberries (it's what I had on hand); increased the sugar to two tsp of brown sugar per another reviewer, and added cinnamon and vanilla.  It still doesn't have much flavor.  I will probably heat this up tomorrow in some milk and add some brown sugar and eat it like oatmeal, but am disappointed in this as a bar.

I liked the concept, but I needed more sugar. So, I'm making it again and this time with at least a cup of sugar. Also, I added a banana,  pecans, and raisins.

I didn't really care for this.  Made exactly as directed except I toasted the coconut first.  I thought it was very dry, and had very little taste.  Also the portion was small.  Won't be making again.  Sorry!

I wasn't crazy about this and will probably not make again. It was very bland and needed lots of adjustments and add-ons. Might as well use another recipe.

I followed recipe as written but added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.  I still haven't figured out what this is.  I thought it would be oatmeal but still not sure.  Had a square for breakfast with yogurt.  It's OK, but I won't be rushing make this again.

It needed to be sweeter...very bland...I think some brown sugar would make it much better. I always cook a new recipe how the instructions say and tweak it the next time.

Made this with high expectations of a delicious new treat and was sorely disappointed!  Not like the description — in taste or appearance! Don’t recommend at all.

Bland and not crispy or soft. Chewy. Didn't care for it.
