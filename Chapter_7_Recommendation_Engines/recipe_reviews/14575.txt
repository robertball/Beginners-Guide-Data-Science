I did not use ground meat but used Morningstar Farms ground meat substitute and I fried them in a pan.  Really tasty.  I hope other vegetarians will try this.

I really liked these.  I was afraid they'd have too much cumin flavor, but it was perfect.  Will definitely be making these again.

Absolutely wonderfull! What a surprise this was. Make sure you use fresh, moist ground beef to hold the corn laden patties together. I cooked these indoors on a grill pan. For us salt lovers, adding a good sprinkling of salt just after removing patties from the pan REALLY brought out the cumin flavor!! I'll make these often.

This was the inspiration for an unexpected and yummy dinner improv. I used organic ground bison meat instead of beef, which really enhanced the exotic flavor. My burgers fell apart in my pan, since i am not a very good burger cook. So i chopped all of the ground meat up, Hamburger Helper-style. The aroma was interesting, but i wasn't totally convinced that it was going to be very good until all was cooked through. In a spur of the moment inspiration, i tossed the meat over 2 pieces of naan bread, topped it with a slice of pepper jack cheese, and popped them in the oven for a few minutes for an open-faced melt. WHOA!!! AWESOME! My side dish was Cameroonian Fried Spinach (another member recipe), which i botched so it was kinda gross. But my intentions were pure! I will definitely do this again, and hopefully perfect the spinach recipe since they seem like they would go so well together on those nights when i'm craving something easy, yet non-Western. Thanks for the recipe!

I thought I'd be a lot more flavorful.  The sweet taste from the corn kind of contrasted the cumin.

I liked the taste, but had trouble turning them into patties.  Even after they cooked, they fell apart on the plate so wasn't the most convenient burger to eat.  Will make again though and just plan on eating them on a plate instead of a bun.  I love burgers, corn and cumin - and they taste great together.

We did not like the addition of corn and cumin to ground beef.  Especially the cumin.

I would say if you make this burger, COOK OUT ON THE GRILL, NOT INSIDE.
(Made my whole house stink)

I made these on my George Foreman grill about a month ago and have been craving them ever since.  They are so good!

I didn't love the corn but these have potential. The corn and cumin paired well but the combo screamed black beans. That being said, I think these would have been better with ground chicken or turkey and the combo of beans and corn as a relish.  My cilantro had gone bad and hubs hates tomato so I dressed it with spinach and prepared salsa. Play around with this recipe to suit your needs and I think you will find yourself a winner.
