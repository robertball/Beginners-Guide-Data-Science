This was a good base recipe for granola- I substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil, unsweetened apple juice for the water, omitted the dates and coconut, added pine nuts, slivered almonds, raisins, dried cranberries, sunflower seeds and dried apricots.  I also used all wheat bran instead of the mix of wheat germ and bran and it turned out fine!  Very good hot like oatmeal, cold with milk, or mixed with applesauce.

Yummy, yummy cereal that stays crunchy in milk.  I halved the recipe and did some substitutions due to lack of ingredients: I cut out the germ, dates, and coconut, and I added 1/2 cup of flour, 1/2 cup bran cereal (looks like twigs), and 1/2 cup of sliced almonds.  This cereal is barely sweet, so I added some raisins to my bowl when I served it.  I'll definitely be making this again!

This is our favorite granola!  The only change I made is to bake it for 1 1/2 hours, stirring once after the first 30 minutes.

This has been one of my favorite recipes from this site!  I make this all the time for my family and as gifts for friends. Everyone I've given it to has beeged for the recipe.  My boys put it on yogurt or applesauce, and I just love it in a bowl with milk for breakfast.  When making it I include the optional cinnamon and nutmeg, but I also include ½ - 1 cup of flax seeds.  I sometimes splurge on the vanilla too and add up to 2 tablespoons.  As for the nuts I have found that I like chopped hazelnuts and almonds.  I cook the nuts throughout the entire baking cycle to give them a nice toasted taste.  Then I just add the dates for the last 15 minutes and skip the coconut.  Super easy!   Super good!

This cereal was great. I think I will make it and give it away as a gift. I used almonds, no dates, and oat bran instead of wheat bran. The taste was delicious.

This is a wonderful, nutritious and tasty cereal. For my youngest's food allergies, I substituted oat bran for wheat bran, ground up sunflower seeds for the wheat germ (an odd-sounding substitution, but it worked), and about 1/4 cup barley malt instead of brown sugar (I decreased the water a bit to make up for the liquid). This goes great with rice, oat or almond milk--and if you use just enough milk to cover the cereal and microwave it for about 60 seconds, it makes a wonderful hot cereal (really brings out the pecan flavor).

I love this recipe. I used the spices, and substituted whole almonds for the pecans because of my personal taste. I don't care for coconut, so I left it out and the salt because I have to eat salt free. I also coated the almonds in a tablespoon of honey before adding. It is a great cereal.

This turned out wonderfully! Because I did not have dates, I omitted them. My granola took almost an hour to bake. I let it cool in the baking pan, then added a cup of freeze-dried blueberries. We had this for breakfast and the kids and I absolutely loved it. I think next time, I might switch out the honey for maple syrup. I think that would be good, too. This was simple enough for me to make early in the morning while my kids were sleeping and have it ready to go as they were waking up.

This is very tasty as well as simple to make. I made it as described and will halve the nutmeg next time as it seemed to somewhat overtake the other flavors. Great nutrition -- and it's nice to skip the preservatives and fillers of commercial cereal!

This is far better than store bought cereal.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time I made it but the second time I used less oats but threw in a handful of wheat chex, bran flakes, corn flakes, dried sweetened cranberries, and combined sliced almonds with the pecans.  thanks for a great recipe!

This is super delicious!  As a snack or with milk for breakfast.  I used rolled oats (not quick cook) and cooked it all slightly longer.  It gave it a chewier texture which we liked a lot.  I cut the nutmeg in half and left out the dates (didn't have any).  Great recipe!  Will make lots!  Much more healthy than sugary cereals at the grocery store and super cheap to make!

This is an excellent recipe!  I substituted oat bran for the wheat bran, and instead of dates,pecans and coconut, added 1 cup raisins, 1 cup sliced almonds and 1 cup quinoa.  I did agree with one reviewer that the nutmeg was a little overpowering-next time I will double the cinnamon and vanilla and omit the nutmeg.

Good flavor, but too moist!!! It's not crunchy! I'd probably use oil for the water if I were to make this again.

This cereal is so good.  I add 3/4 c. brown sugar and for the last fifteen minutes, I stir in 4 cups of various fruits and nuts.  My family goes crazy over this!

This is a very easy and tasty homemade cereal to make.  This is a great (and cheaper) alternative to today's commercial cereals that are processed and loaded with bad sugar. I have made this 5 times and all turned out great, using slightly different mixings dried fruits and nuts.  You may also want to half the nutmeg so it’s not overpowering. To be totally organic (if that's a worry), then you may want to buy your own coconut and shred it (if used) and also buy a natural brown sugar (like muscavado).  And if using some kind of blend of dried fruit, buy some that not artificially "sweetened".   I estimated the cost to make this was $0.23 per serving (even using all natural ingredients as above).  Furthermore, I estimated on a 2,500 calorie diet, if this was all you ate (not recommended), it would cost $1.84 per day to live off of (and buying a generic version of Oats)!

Wow.  This is really good.  I used slivered almonds and it came out really delicious.  I only used 6 cups of oats though and left the other amounts the same.  I am wondering if you can get good results if you cut the oil back to 1/4 cup.  I may try that next time.

Before I made this, I wish I had read deeper into the reviews to discover that this doesn't clump at all.  The only thing I changed was to substitute applesauce for oil to cut down on fat.  It didn't stay as crunchy as I had hoped in milk, either.  Other than the fact that this is a healthy choice, I was disappointed and won't make this again.

This is a really great recipe. My family has eaten this every day for breakfast for the last two months!!! My kids love it.  I changed the vanilla to 1 teaspoon and toast my coconuts and almond slices separte. Everyone builds their own bowl of cereal just the way they like it!

Works better if you use a caserole dish large enough to hold everything and increase Temp to: 350 C.  Just be sure to check a little for often and stir frequently.

I love that I can have homemade cereal without corn syrup.  Instead of chopped pecans and dates I used chopped Craisins and toasted chopped cashews.  I also omitted the spices and coconut.  Perfect!

great recipe!  I didn't have bran so I just omitted it. I had to eyeball most of the ingredients as I did not have enough of everything. I used dried cranberries instead of dates. I also added rice crispies cereal with the other ingredients in the last 15 mins of baking. Oh, and I also used agave nectar instead of honey. So healthy and delicious. Even the kids loved it! Thanks so much for sharing :)

I used raisins, walnuts, and sliced almonds instead of the dates and pecans.  Followed the recipe step by step other than that. I would recommend using at least 3 large jelly roll pans to spread the cereal out on. I put mine on 1, and it didn't evenly brown (the cereal along the edge browned faster than that in the middle). Also, I wish there was some way to make this "clumpier."  I like the crunchy clusters you get sometimes in cereal and granola-- this was all one consistency. Perhaps more honey next time?  We really love this, though, and will make again. It lasts a very long time because it makes a big load of cereal.

This recipe is excellent.  It is a very nutritional breakfast cereal without all of the sugar.  Very filling and my 2 year old loves it!

This cereal is so good!  I've made it several times.  I use raisins and only 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg because 1 teaspoon seems overpowering. Very good recipe!

This stuff is great! I left out the wheat bran and it was still fine. I will make it often.

It has a good flavor, but I was looking for something that could serve as a finger snack, and this won't.  I substituted almonds and left out the coconut, just because i can't get almonds where i'm at and i don't like coconut.  I have been eating it for breakfast, though, and I do like it.

This is delicious served over yogurt for breakfast!  I substitued the dates for dried cranberries and added a little extra nuts.  This recipe makes a lot so make sure you use a large baking pan.  Thanks!

Delicious recipe, easily altered to your taste. I used about 1/4 c sunflower seeds in addition to the pecans, used 1/2 c coconut, applesauce instead of oil. Craisins and raisins instead of dates. Would do 1/2 as much nutmeg next time, was a little overwhelming. Otherwise the flavor was great. Did cook longer, about 1 hour, then another 20 after adding the nut mixture. Was perfectly crunchy.

This is absolutely delicious.  If I could give it more stars, I would!  I always bump up the vanilla, cinnamon, & nutmeg a bit, and leave out the coconut.  The last time I made it, I added bran flake cereal to it, and I am super-satisfied with the results.  Here are the measurements I used: 3.5 cups oats, 3.5 cups bran flake cereal, .75 cup wheat germ, & .75 cup wheat bran.....everything else the same.  Thanks for sharing this gem of a recipe, Cheryl!

Makes a tasty breakfast. I used dried cranberries and almonds instead of dates and pecans. Also reduced the sugar by 1/3 because it was plenty sweet with that.

This is really good.  Probably will replace dates with crasins (the dates were a bit difficult to find and work with), but other than that, it's delicious.  I tend to eat it as oatmeal.

I have made this twice and I still think it needs some tweaking. The biggest change I made was swapping out the wheat bran for a cup of ground nuts (pecans, almonds, and sesame seeds). Neither Aldi nor Target had wheat bran and that is where I do my shopping so I looked online and the ground nuts seemed the best substitute. I did use cinnamon and nutmeg but maybe could use more (I may also use some more of something sweet next time too). The dates I substituted with raisins and the pecans with banana chips (I could use 50-100% more or each next time). Also, I left out the coconut. 

Even without the changes to suit my preferences, it is pretty good granola. My gripe is that there are no clumps. The second time I made it I added two egg whites to the liquid mixture. I poured the mix on two pans for baking and one I made the mistake of stirring and it is all loose now. The other I left alone and it is clumpy, which is what I want. I also had to bake it a little longer to really get it crunchy. 

Next time, a little more sweetener, egg whites, more spices, double the raisin and banana chips, no stirring and I will use parchment paper.

Fantastic granola recipe! Makes a huge amount! 18 servings is more accurate, when following the amounts listed to make 12. Instead of using vegetable oil, I used coconut oil. Only "issue" I have with this recipe is the serving size. I made the 12 serving size, and that should actually be more like 18 servings.....no one is going to eat a whole cup of granola at almost 600 calories!

I did everything as written, except used Craisins instead of dates. It was pretty good! Crunchy and mildly sweet.

Awesome recipe -we have been giving this to our son since he stopped having "baby cereal".  Its great hot or cold, with yogurt, or just as a snack.  I've put currants, cranberries, blueberries, and raisins in it - its a great recipe to modify.  However, I always use my coffee grinder to grind up pecans, almonds, and banana chips into the cereal.  I've mixed up bunches to give to folks as presents and they RAVE about it.

Granola is so expensive at the store that I thought I'd try making some myself.  I added the listed spices, left out the nuts and coconut, and substituted raisins instead of dates.  Overall, this was an alright granola, but not nearly as good as store-bought.  Just my oppinion.

This is a good start. The texture is a little chewy for my taste, but the flavor is really good. I used walnuts and cherries instead of the other nuts and dates. I also added some ground flax meal for an omega-6 boost. I will definitely be making this often, and plan to experiment with different variations.
