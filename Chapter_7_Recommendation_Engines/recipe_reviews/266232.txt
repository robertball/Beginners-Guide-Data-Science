I made this twice, once with Giovanni Rana refrigerated pesto and once with my own homemade pesto. Delicious both ways!

Made this last night it was very good! Good summer time salad. I did make my own pesto  and left out the lemon zest  didn't have. My husband said I could make it anytime for him.

I made this with roasted  frozen corn, for the convenience.   It was a very easy recipe. I can't say this was an OMG recipe, but it was okay.  Next time I make  it I will use my own pesto. I use store bought this first try.  it was something different for me to try.
