Nice! I actually bought vermouth for this after I read how it could be used in other recipes calling for white wine. This sauce is good. I l added a little more rosemary because we both really love it. I also think doubling the sauce is a good idea if you are making 4 steaks. I used the recipe as written and it really only made enough for 2 mid-size ribeyes - but I like the sauce thickish and a thinner sauce would obviously go further. I seasoned my steaks with salt and back pepper only, and made the sauce in the searing pan.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this sauce a number of times.  I frequently use it on pork chops and serve over rice or buttered noodles.  I also have put it over chicken and served with rice.  Steak is actually my least favorite meat to serve it with, but that's just my personal taste.  I have also made it with diced tomatoes with chiles in times when I wanted a spicier dinner, and that is also very good.

We loved this recipe. I used frozen chicken breast strips and cooked them on the stove in the sauce and it was wonderful! So easy and hassle free, I will definitely be making this again

Thanks for an easy and tasty recipe!  I tried this with red wine, and I worried the wine would overpower the taste, but it actually seemed to enhance the other flavors! very tasy.  Thanks for sharing!

This was a lot better than I thought it was going to be! I sautéed a dab of minced garlic in olive oil, then used Chardonnay and chicken broth with a can of roasted diced tomatoes as directed with the rosemary. Because my husband likes spice, I threw in some red pepper flakes too. After simmering for a bit I thought it was a bit too spicy (I didn't measure the red pepper, opsy), so I added a little more broth and wine. I generous tablespoon of butter whisked in at the end really made the sauce. I put fresh sautéed spinach over egg noodles, with oven roasted chicken breast then topped with the sauce. It doesn't make a lot, so will double next time I make it.

I am so glad I tried this.  It is soooo good!  I used white wine and crushed tomatoes (about 1/2 jar) because that's what I had, and it was great.  I put it over chicken that I had pan fried with a little extra rosemary.  Worked well with green beans/almonds and brown rice/quinoa and a little of the extra wine :).  It has great flavor and is really easy.  Try it!
