I have been making my corned beef and cabbage in the crockpot for a long time.  I would rate this as the #1 best tasting food in the crockpot. I will let you all in on a little secret though.  The only liquid you need to add is the water(about half to 3/4 to the top of the pot) You do not need beer, chicken broth or any other liquid for flavor. The only spice I would recommend is either the packet that comes with the corned beef or some whole peppercorns.  Otherwise the meat  will do all of the flavoring for you.  Also, I always add my potatoes in the beginning along with the carrots and onion.  They do not come out mushy at all, just very melt in your mouth tasty.  You can leave them in larger pieces or you can use the small whole potatoes.  Then for the last hour of cooking you can add your cabbage. Very simple meal but so delicious.

Really good-my family loved it.  The only change I made was to cook it on low for 8 hours and then add the cabbage the last 1/2 hour of cooking. 8 hours on high seemed like the meat might get too tough.

Amazingly simple, and amazingly delicious. The only changes I made were to set the slow cooker on low, instead of high. The meat came out tender and falling apart. I might put in the vegetables later on next time, but if you like stewy and smushy vegetables, then put it in the pot at the beginning. A solid hit! My boyfriend loved this dish, and it made leftovers for the two of us for a week!

I loved this because I can put it all in the crock pot first thing in the morning, go about my day and have a wonderful completed meal when I return home at 5pm.  Few observations:  the recipe definitely meant to say 8 hours on LOW, I can't imagine how it would have turned out otherwise, nor can I think of any crock pot recipe that is cooked THAT long on high.  Secondly, use beef broth instead of water, it gives that much more flavor. Finally, I took out the roast and let it rest for 20 minutes and threw the cabbage in.  It was perfectly cooked in the 20 minutes and not soggy at all.

I made this recipe for my first ever St. Patties with my new hubby. After reading many reviews, I decided it was too basic and made several changes to add more flavor:  3 Tbl sugar (white or brown). enough water or beef broth to submerge meat.  6 garlic cloves. 2 bay leaves. 3 Tbl butter. 12 whole Allspice. 1/2 tsp pepper. NO SALT!!!!!  5 red potatoes (instead of 10 - leaves more liquid in pot). 3 carrots (sliced instead of matchstick pieces). No cabbage (cooked seperately to prevent sogginess). 2 Onions (quartered).  Hope this helps. Enjoy!

Excellent Recipe! We didn't use beer, but did use Low Sodium Beef Stock in place of water. Started the Corned Beef with Seasoning Packet on Low at 9:00 this morning, added the potatoes, carrots and onions at 2:00 and added cabbage at 4:00. Sat down to eat an absolute wonderful meal at 6:15. Meat was extremely tender and vegetables were perfect. This is the only way we will ever prepare this meal. Thanks for sharing!

All agreed this was probably the best corned beef and cabbage dinner I ever made. I actually surprised myself.  I have to detail what I did in this review so that I don’t forget what I did and can duplicate it the next time I make it!  I started the meat alone, with a bottle of Guinness and enough water to cover, on “high” for an hour and then turned it to “low.”   Three hours after I started it I added the (peeled) potatoes and carrots (no onion).  Late afternoon I gave it another hour on high, then turned it back down to low. I cooked the (savoy) cabbage separately on the stovetop in some of the strained cooking liquid from the slow cooker.  The meat, sliced against the grain, was tender as can be and cut into perfect slices.  The potatoes, also, were cooked to the ideal tenderness. “Creamy Horseradish and Garlic Spread,” recipe also from this site, was EXCELLENT with the meat and “Grandma Andrews’ Irish Soda Bread,” also excellent I might add, rounded out this memorable St.Patrick’s Day meal.  I SO wish I would have taken a picture of this gorgeous dinner, but everyone was in a big hurry to eat!

Very good!  I also added a little garlic powder, onion powder and fresh ground pepper.  I used Guinness Draught for the beer.  I will definitely be making this recipe again next St. Patrick's Day.  It taste just like my mom's recipe, and she's Irish. :)

This came out perfect…the best corned beef dinner ever I think.  Here is what I did exactly.  I look over my brisket I am buying very carefully at the store.  A thinner cut with not too much marbling throughout but a nice level of fat at the top.  I bought a 3 ½ pound brisket.  First, line the bottom of the crock pot with small red potatoes (whole with the skins), baby carrots and a white onion, cut in 8ths.  Sprinkle the spice packet that came with the brisket (if you have one) on top of the vegetables.  Trim off some of the fat from the brisket so the vegetables won’t get too oily but make sure to leave some so the meat will stay moist while cooking. Place the brisket on top of the vegetables, fat side UP.  Pour in ½ can of Guinness and enough water to almost cover the brisket with just a little of the fat come through the surface.  Add some pickling spice on top of the brisket; cover and cook for 8 hours on HIGH (yes high).  When it was finished, I took the brisket out, covered it with aluminum foil and let it site while I added the wedges of cabbage to the crock pot with the other vegetables.  I let that cook on high for 30 minutes.  Everything was perfect and not mushy at all.  No leftovers!

I tried using this recipe and cooking corned beef for my first time yesterday.  My boyfriend said he always used a pressure cooker for corned beef and that it had been good a few times and bad a few times so I was little apprehensive.  However, this was a grand slam!!!  I purchased a 3 lb corned beef roast from Sam's Club and we at all but about 1 dinner worth of left overs!!!

Details: I did put my crockpot on high for the 9 hours despite reviews saying not too.  The corned beef just fell apart perfectly.  Next time I will not add potatoes or carrots until about 4 hours in and I will add cabbage about 1 1/2 hours before (probably because it barely fit in my crockpot it took a bit longer to cook)...I also took tips on adding a few beef bullion cubes and added more corrinder, mustard seed, peppercorns, and some garlic powder.  I just had a 24 oz budweiser and used about half of that.

I have a ton of leftover cabbage and will be using it with kielbasa tonight.

Another great tip from a reviewer was to make the "Creamy horseradish and garlic spread" for the corned beef!!  It is on this site and to die for!!  For horseradish lovers add a little extra:)

Generally speaking, I think I still prefer my corned beef between a couple of pieces of rye with a little swiss cheese and some ground mustard.  Can't really blame this recipe for that.  There are no spices to be critical of.  The meat takes care of that.  Many thoughts on cooking this on high or low.  I opted to go with the recipe, and the meat was perfect along with the carrots and potatoes (no mush).  Since I like my cabbage a little firmer, I followed one suggestion to take the meat out to rest, and throw the cabbage in for about 20 minutes.  Don't let all the reviews confuse you.  Just follow the recipe.
UPDATE: Decided to go at again this year.  The only thing I changed was to add a little bit of beef base (best stuff ever) to the water.  DELICIOUS!  I don't know whether it was just better corned beef, or that little change, but loved it.  When I was cleaning up, I was ready to drink the liquid at the bottom or the slow cooker.  The wife who isn't a big meat eater (I think something's wrong with her), really enjoyed it too.  She kept the remaining potatoes and liquid for leftovers.  By the way, we like more potatoes than the recipe.  Some Guinness Black Lager to drink, and Irish Soda Bread Cookies for dessert, and I have a serious case of happy belly.

The meat was ok, but DO NOT use Guinness Extra Stout as the beer. The carrots were absolutely horrible cooked in that.

Oh..... this is sooo good!  I used beef broth instead of beer and added two small turnips.  I cooked the corned beef by itself until the last forty five minutes then added all the vegetables.  After the vegetables were cooked, I took everything out of the crock pot, and poured the broth into a stock pot and cooked the cabbage in the broth for about twenty minutes.  If you cook the vegetables and cabbage for eight or nime hours, they will turn into mush.  Believe me this is  the best way to cook this meal.... It's fantastic and I got raving reviews!!!

I was so impressed with this recipe, and with how well it came out, I hardly changed the recipe:  I added all the water and the whole bottle of beer- (I would never dump beer and since it was 6 am I didn't drink it either...well maybe if it was a saturday...) the brisket did not come with the spice packet so I added ground pepper, 2 garlic cloves and some allspice.  It looked and tasted beautiful- awesome!!!!
UPDATE: The leftover liquid works well as a "beef broth," I froze it until I needed it and used it in a mushroom barley soup- delicious once watered down if too salty!! Just need to strain it a little!

I just made this tonight. Yes, you do need to cook it on high for 8 hours if you want the corned beef to be fall-apart tender and the fat to practically melt off the meat. If you want nice, neat slices, by all means, cook it on low. But it will not be as tender. I didn't quarter the potatoes, so that may be why they didn't fall apart. The carrots got a little too well done, but still edible and in one piece. You might want to put them in half way through. But everything was delicious!

This was the first time cooking corned beef and cabbage.  This turned out so amazing.  I will never use another recipe.  I read all the reviews and decided to go with this:  I put the brisket in and sprinkled the spice packet and three smashed garlic cloves, then used a bottle of gluten free beer and enough water to cover the meat and turned my crock pot on High. About 4 hours in I added 6 yukon golds cut in half lenghtwise, several sliced carrots, and 1 whole onion cut in 1/8th.  2 1/2 hours later I removed the vegetables and added 8 brussel sprouts cut in half, and a cabbage cut into 1/8ths. I left this all in for another 2 1/2 hours. Then I took out the meat and let sit, and returned the vegetables in with the cabbage to warm.  PERFECTION!.  the meat sliced like butter, and ALL the vegetables were perfectly soft without any mush.I kept the pot on High the whole time.

I have only one adjustment to this recipe, as it is pretty perfect just the way it is... There is just far too much liquid for a slow cooker recipe. The only liquid I add is (gasp!) a 12 oz. bottle of Corona Extra. The lighter beer adds just the right amount of flavor  to the veggies without overwhelming them.

Clearly this recipe is VERY forgiving. When you read so many of the reviewers cooking it entirely differently you can assume that almost any version will turn out well. I have made it twice, both times it turned out the way I like it; shredded like carnitas. I added 4 3/4 cups total liquid, beer (used IPA) and water in any ratio you want. I also added baby whole potatoes, small bag from Trader Joes, four carrots sliced in thick rounds, and one whole onion sliced in rings. The potatoes and onions I put on the bottom of crock pot with the meat on top. Carrots went around the sides (I add cabbage cut in 1/8s two hours before you serve meat). I did use the spice packet enclosed with the meat and also added a few tablespoons of brown sugar, a couple of cloves of diced garlic, four or so bay leaves, and a couple of teaspoons of mustard seed. Don't add additional salt, corned beef is already salted so its not necessary. Again, there is so much variation in cooking temperatures and times from people that have cooked this, I am pretty sure anything suggested will work. I start my crock pot on high for two hours, turn it down to low for four to six, then back up to high when I put in cabbage for another hour or two. My total cooking time varies from 8 - 10 hours depending on when I want to serve and how long I have it on high. If you need more of a "plan" then that; go four hours high, four hours low and you will be pleased. Pretty stress free receptive and VERY flavorful.

This was amazing!  The meat was tender and delicious and the vegetables a nice texture.  I made a few changes to accommodate my pantry:  At the recommendation of other reviewers, I used beef broth in place of water - I think about 2 cups which was what I had on hand.  I didn't have baby red potatoes, so used full size red potatoes cut in eighths, and dumped in a bunch of baby carrots.  Didn't have beer, so didn't use any.  I actually cooked this in my slow-cooker on low for 10 hours.  My family was thrilled with this meal.  I will definitely make this again.  Glad I tried it before St. Patty's Day so I can get more corned beef while it's still on sale.  Thanks, Lusyrsgirl!

I make this recipe every year. The reason some of the comments complain about it being tough is because you need to choose the flat cut rather than brisket cut. Flat cut is leaner.

I also cooked on low for 8 hrs, as a previous review... Corned beef Brisket just fell apart . I cooked recipe  as written except for high crock pot setting.  Was perfect flavor did not need to add extra seasoning. I added 12oz beer and 3 cups of water. I found my veg soft but not mushy which was perfect. This was my 2nd year making family loves it!

I like my potatoes and carrots a little firm (not mushy) so I placed them in the bottom of the pot then added a couple of smashed garlic cloves and the onions. I placed the meat on the top then covered. cooked for about 6 hours on high or until the potatoes and carrots had a bit of resistance when inserting a fork(they were cut fairly large). Removed the meat, scooped out the potatoes and carrots and replaced with the cabbage put the meat back in to cook for 3 more hours. I took out alot of the water and heated the potatoes and carrots back up in it. Voila. I had my meat done perfectly and my potatoes and carrots still had the flavor I wnated but were not mushy. Purfection.

Turned out great!  I have made corned beef and cabbage twice before and my husband complained about the cabbage being mushy, but not with this recipe.  I substituted some of the water for a beer, added garlic, 2 Tb sugar and 2 Tb apple cider vinegar and the recipe was perfect.

8-10 hours on LOW!  High at 8 hours is too long and unnecessary.  I've always cooked mine on LOW for 8-10 hours and it turns out perfect.  And, whole peeled red potatoes cooked for that long also turn out soft and wonderful!

I tried this on my busiest night and ended up eating 3 hours later than usual which put my kids going to bed at 10 instead of 8 :( I cooked it on low and put cabbage in an hour before it was done and it took an extra 3 hours to finish cooking next time Ill cook on high and put cabbage in 2 hours before its done.

this recipe is good, but I tweeked it just a bit and loved it. Instead of using water, I use half beef stock and half beer. It gives it such a great flavor. I also added in about 3 cloves of garlic and cooked on low all day.

Thought I'd try this slow cooker recipe instead of my usual stovetop method for preparing our traditional St. Patty's Day meal.  Had to reduce the ingredient proportions to accommodate my smaller crockpot, and I used a whole bottle of Guinness (didn't want to waste it, and it was too early in the AM to drink it!) then added just enough water so that the liquid covered the contents of the pot, but otherwise I stuck to the recipe ingredients.  My corned beef package didn't include a seasoning packet, but my husband doesn't like heavily spiced foods, so I lightly sprinkled in some salt and pepper.  I simmered the corned beef and veggies for 9 HOURS ON LOW, adding the cabbage after 7 hours).  Never have any luck using the high setting on my slow cooker, so I added the extra time to make up for the lower temp and to adjust for the heat escaping when I added the cabbage.  Veggies were perfect, tasty, and tender but not mushy.  Although the meat  came apart with a fork, it did taste a bit drier than when I cook it on the stovetop. Not sure if that's the recipe's fault or the brand of corned beef I used, so I'm only giving 4 stars.  Did notice that the meat didn't shrink nearly as much as when I cook it on the stovetop.  I will definitely try this recipe again using another brand corned beef!

This recipe was so good, I was almost tempted to make it twice in a row because all the meat was gone the first day! :) I did a few changes...Instead of water I added majority of Beef Stock and just a little bit of water, the first 2 hours in, I decieded to go ahead and had my baby carrots (Which were soft and tender at the end). Also, at after about 5 Hours, I added my red potatoes.I actually cooked my cabbage seperatly,(Fried Cabbage, look up the recipe)I added the broth from the crock pot in my skillet, to cook with my cabbage!! Fabulous meal

Just made this today... Fantastic! Only substitution I made was, I used orange juice in place of the beer. I also cooked it about an hour longer than it said after adding the cabbage. 1hour to cook the cabbage is good if you like it al dente. I like my cabbage cooked. So I cooked it 2 hours after adding the cabbage. 
The corn beef was soooo tender. Best I've ever had!! Definitely 5 stars! However... It only fed four, not eight.

Solid recipe. You really can't go wrong with slow cooking corned beef, though. I had it for 9 hours low. The potatoes didn't get mushy, they were perfect. The onions were translucent and not really of any edible substance.

My husband loved this recipe and had three helpings!!!!!  After reading all the reviews, here is what I came up with:

I cooked the corn beef for a total of 8 hours.  The first four hours was on high and the remaining four hours on low.  1 1/2 hours towards the end, I added the cabbage.  For the liquid, I used 2 cups of water and 2 cups of beef stock.  I did add the beer *used budweiser) in addition to two bay leafs, one parsnips, one clove of garlic chopped, 2 tablespoons of mustard and also 1/4 cup of brown sugar in addition to all the other ingredients mentioned in the recipe.  It came out perfect, very moist, and the vegetables were not mushy in the slightest!  Looking forward to the leftovers on Patty's day.  Can't wait to make this again, definitely a keeper!

This was great!  I will forever make my corned beef in the crock pot!  The only change I made, as noted in other reviews, was to cook it on low for 8 hours.  I put the cabbage in and cooked on high for 1/2 an hour.  It was perfect!

Not bad, but I much prefer a simpler version:  just put the corned beef & its spice packet in the crockpot, add enough liquid (broth, or beer, or water) to come up halfway in the pot, and cook most of the day, like 8 hours or so,until very tender.  Cut a green cabbage in 4 quarters, and with a few hours to go stuff the quarterson top of the corned beef and cook until serving time.  If you like crunchy cabbage 2 hours should do, for very soft cabbage you can cook everything together at the same time.  If the cabbage gets to the right softness you prefer before the corned beef is done, take it out, put in a ceramic bowl and when dinner is served microwave it for 5 or so minutes to warm it up.  Serve the cabbage- as a whole quarter per person-  with vinegar, either plain, cider or malt vinegar depending on taste.  To me, shredding the cabbage & adding carrots, onions  & potatoes makes it more like a stew.

I made this recipe just as it was written and set the slow cooker on "high" as called for!  It turned out great!  The vegetables were just right and not mushy at all!  The meat was tasty and had good texture!  It was even better the next day!  I will be making this again!  Thank You for the recipe!

this is pretty much what i have been doing.. and i also cook for longer time on lower setting. it comes out sooo yummy. i have also had it with Apples cut up in the mixture..or apple juice .. which gives it the sweeter taste but not overpowering.. and really blends in good with the flavors..

Very good! First time I ever made it. Corned beef was very tender and delish. I did not use any beer, just water. Made the cabbage 2 ways since I was not sure about boiled cabbage. Added some to the crock pot during the last hour. Also made some stir fried with olive oil, butter,  salt & pepper, and bacon, cooked until it was a yummy golden brown. Loved it much better than the cabbage added to the corned beef mixture. Just my opinion. Will be using the leftover corned beef for reubens which both me and my hubby love. Will make again.

Yummy! My crock pot is small so I had to make some adjustments. I halved the number of potatoes and used half a bag of baby carrots. I put the potatoes, meat, and carrots in the crock pot with a can of chicken broth (what I had on hand). Omitted the beer. I cooked on high for 9 hours then transferred the meat to a warm oven (just to keep warm but not to cook it anymore). I then added my onion and cabbage and cooked for 2 hours. Perfect! Onions and cabbage were tender but not mushy. Potatoes and carrots were not mushy either and had cooked for a total of 11 hours on high. The two of us ate almost all of the nearly 4 pound corned beef because it was so great!

My wife never has cared for corned beef...until I prepared this last year on St. P. Day. In fact, tonight she asked me to dig up this recipe so that we could take a Crockpot full over to friends for dinner next week. I always test the member's recipe as written the first time I use it. In this case, I won't change a thing in it. Thanks LUSYRSGIRL :)

This was a good base but I also made some changes.  I started the Corned Beef on LOW at 9:00 in the morning. I added the 4 cups of water, 1 can of beef broth, 2 minced cloves of garlic and some onion powder along with the seasoning packet it came with. After 5 hours I added the red potatoes.  After another 3 hours I turned the crock pot up to HIGH for an hour. Then after one more hour I removed the beef and potatoes and added the cabbage by itself in the juices for 30 minutes. It was the BEST corned beef and cabbage we ever ate.

Excellent! But rather than add chopped cabbage, try a whole cabbage, cut into 8ths.

I didn't care for it made this way. The meat came out stringy and fell apart when I tried to slice it. For my tastes, the slow cooker is just not the way to go with this one.

Cooking this on high for 8 hours seemed like a misprint to me, but I decided to follow the instructions.  Boy am I glad I did!  The corned beef was so tender and very juicy.  I did not have room in my crock pot at the end for the cabbage, so I ended up cooking it on the stove.  The potatoes and carrots were ok but nothing special.  My first time to cook and taste corned beef.  Very good tasting and a great first time experience!

If you're searching for a simple way to prepare corned beef & cabbage, you have found the perfect recipe! I followed the recipe exactly, and had a fabulous meal waiting for me when I came home from work. The meat was so tender, and the vegetables, although a bit mushy for my taste, were flavorful and the perfect pairing for the brisket.   *One thing I would change = if you are going to be around while this is cooking, throw the onions, carrots, and potatoes in the crock pot after the meat has been cooking for 4 hours. This way they still hold their form, yet are perfectly tender.   Delicous! Now a weekend meal can be a weekday meal.

Love this dish and make it often because its so easy. The most important part in my opinion is to trim the fat.  As in, I cut off as much of the fatty layer as possible. This makes for a much leaner and less oily result. I use all water, no beer and cook on low. To me, the beer added a strange flavor to the veggies, but it probably depends what type you use. No extra spice needed, the packet is enough. On high works too, but I like to be able to slice the meat, instead of having it totally falling apart. I put carrots and potatoes in at the beginning but do the cabbage for the last half hour or so only.  Interesting note - do not try this recipe on high for half the time.  That works for other recipes but did not work well for this.  The meat needs the 8-9 hours whether on low or high.

obviously a 2lb chunk of meat probably won't come out so great after 8 hours on high...So, here's my take (its in the crockpot now):  I have (2) 3lb point-cut (although they are pretty flat) CB briskets in there.  On the bottom I put 1/2 sweet onion and 1/2 red onion (both in 1/8 onion chunks), 6 cloves (whole) garlic, 3 celery stalks, and 2 med-large carrots (cut lenghtwise and in half where it was thickest). These veggies are for FLAVORING while cooking - I am NOT planning on eating these. I then added 4 cups water, placed one 3# meat brisket over the veggies (fat side up), sprinkled spice packet, then added the second 3# brisket (fat side down) and sprinkled the 2nd spice packet (if you only have one cut of meat, just ignore the 2nd I described). I didn't have beer so added 1 more cup of water. Since I have 6lbs beef in there, I am opting for about 7 hours on high setting and plan to "flip" them halfway through. Then Im going to change it to LOW setting for another 2 hours or so, and at this time I will take the meat out, check it for "doneness/texture". I will also strain out/discard the "cooking veggies", and add new ones (for eating) in the strained liquid: potatoes, baby carrots, celery, chopped garlic, also including the meat if needed. After an hour on low, I'll check the potatoes/carrots & add the onions and cabbage so they dont' get too mushy. Will post an update soon.

Great recipe my only change is to take the meat out of the crock pot when cooked.  Put corned beef in pan cover with foil and place in a 200 degree oven. This takes some of the moisture from the meat, and easy for slicing. Then add the sliced cabbage to crock until cooked and  tender.. By thanking out the meat, the meat doesn't taste like cabbage. Great with mustard and horseradish. Enjoy. My partners mother told me this over 40 years ago.

My friend Jan made this for dinner last night and invited us over.   This was the best I ever had.
She told me she didn't use the beer and also put the Corned Beef on the bottom and the vegetables on top.   
This is a true 'Keeper'

This was my first time using a slow cooker for corn beef. I will never simmer it again. It was delish and for the first time ever I could cut it into slices and it was moist not dried out and tasteless. Even my husband who eats it once a year and is not fond of it,loved it. He had 2 helpings then picked at the little pieces on the plate. I even have a few slices left over for sandwiches for tomorrow instead of dried out crumbs that I would just throw away. I read other reviews who cooked it on low for 8hr. So I compromised and put it on high for 4 1/2 hrs then turned to low and in another 1 1/2hrs I checked and it was done. I then took the beef and veggies out of the cooker and kept it warm and cooked my cabbage which I wedged instead of chopping for another 1 1/4 hrs.next time I will cook it on low for the 8 hours, as some of the potatoes had crumbled but only a few. I also used Coors light and the whole 12oz. can because that's all I had .This will be the only way I will ever cook it again. It was wonderful. Thank you for the great recipe.

I would only cook the potatoes, carrots, and onions for half of the time.  They were like mush after 6 hours.  And the cabbage takes longer than an hour.  More like 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  The meat turned out good, but you will want to make adjustments on the veggies.

good but my corned beef sat a bit above the water and got a bit dry.  Next time I will add extra water to make sure the whole cut of beef is underwater.

It was my first time making Corned Beef, and it turned out wonderfully. Here's what I did:
- Used a 2 lb. bag of baby carrots, 3 onions thick sliced, and 5 potatoes quartered longways.
- Used 4 cups of water only along with 5 beef bullion cubes cut up and sprinkled over everything. I still wound up with a LOT of liquid, about half way up the  crock.
- I put the veggies on the bottom and trimmed some of the fat off of the beef and put it on top, then sprinkled the seasoning packet over everything.
- I cooked it for 2 hours on HIGH, and the final 8 hours on LOW, (See comment below) and it all turned out great. Carrots and potatoes came out fine, but onions were very soft, almost overdone, but still very tasty. 
- The only trouble I had was with adding the cabbage at the end. I used 1.5 heads of cabbage, cutting each half into 1/3's. I removed the meat after 9 hours and put it in a covered dish in the oven at 200 degrees. Then I added the cabbage for the last hour, but it wasn't done, so I removed the cabbage to another ceramic covered dish, added some broth, and microwaved it for about 7 minutes on high. It came out just right.
  Had a mostly-vegetarian over for dinner who was "nice" and took a small piece of meat to try. She said she actually liked the meat better than the veggies!
  My wife said she didn't know that she liked corned beef....until now!
  All in all a great recipe, even without the beer. 
  This recipe goes into me Save File.

I was cooking for a large party (12) and didn't have room for the cabbage and carrots.  Instead I just put in the water, Guiness beer and 1 1/2 yellow onion cut into fourths.  After the 8 hours I pulled the corn beef out of the pot, put it in a metal bowl with foil to keep it hot and added the cabbage into the slow cooker juices, letting it cook for about 20 minutes.  I just cooked the carrots on the side.  Don't add extra beer.  Though you might think the more the merrier, it might make your meat tough or not cook as tender.

Simple, moist, and delicious - with a couple of tweaks. I scoured the reviews for tips before making this dish yesterday for St Patrick's Day. Here's what worked for me: (1) Substitute low-sodium beef broth for the beer AND water.  I saw the review that Guinness Extra Stout didn't work well - and that's all we had! In any event, using beef broth eliminates any concerns about which type of beer. (2) Start with just the onion, beef, and broth in the slow cooker - as others have suggested, add the potatoes and carrots about halfway through, and the cabbage 1 hour before the end. (3) Thick slices of carrots, not matchsticks. They were substantial enough to stay intact yet still melted in the mouth. (4) Yes indeed - 8 hours on HIGH, and everything turned out perfectly - nothing was dried out or overcooked. I thought that sounded like too much as well, and maybe it depends on your slow cooker temp settings.  I did a bit of research - slow cooker temps vary from brand to brand but apparently the "high" setting can be as low as 200 degrees F. (I've also heard that in some models, "high" just means you get the food to the target temperature more quickly, but that the actual high & low temps are the same) . In any event - I have a Rival Crock-Pot and 8 hours on High actually worked (remember - only the beef, onions, and broth were in there for 8 hours - the veggies were in for less).  Final tip: fresh horseradish is the perfect garnish, IMO. Grainy Dijon mustard also works well.

I used this recipe last year and it was pretty good.  My slow cooker runs hot, so I cooked it on low (my low setting will bring stuff to a bubbling simmer!).  I used a whole bottle of beer (Killian's Irish Red) and adjusted the water.  The spice packets that come with the meat (when they are included, I've had several without packets!) are never enough (for our house, anyway).  If you have access to a Penzey's Spice store (or their online store), they sell an awesome package of Corned Beef Spice.  I always add 1T of that to the included spice packet or use 2T if the meat didn't come with a packet.  I also add a couple cloves of smashed garlic.  Still trying to get the timing right on the veggies.  8 hours on low in my cooker turned the quartered reds and the "snack carrots" into mush.  Going to try adding them 2 hours into the cooking this year.

I have been trying to cook moist pull apart Corned Beef and still firm (not mushy veg's) for twenty years, always failing in some way.  Now, with LUSYRSGIRL recipe, I can!  My husband gave the recipe an unqualified 11 out of 10 stars.  Success at long last!

i didn't have beer and never have it in the house. I used beef broth to cover the food. I had the carrots cut into baby size and used regular potatoes. I put the cabbage in sooner about 1 1/2hr because we like our cabbage soft. the veggies came out really well. The meat had good flavor also.

Mine fell apart after 8 hours and that is after lowering the temperature from high to low for the last 2 hours because it looked like it was cooking too fast.  We couldn't make slices and all it will be good for is corned beef hash.  I had company and was disappointed and embarrassed.

This recipe is GREAT!  However, put the carrots in halfway through the cooking time....they will get mushy if you put them in at the start!

Simple, yet effective.  I used a center-cut piece of corned-beef (4.8 lbs), which also has less fat.  Added 2 TBS of dry minced onion, and 2 TBS of garlic powder, used a 12 oz bag of baby carrots, about 1/2 pound of Pee-Wee Dutch potatoes and I used the whole 11.5 oz bottle of Guinness Draft (Yes, it made a difference in the flavor).
 
I also let the meat cook for 10 hours (meat weighed more that the call-out in the recipe), on the low setting.  Super tender and sliced-up really nicely, just like butter.
 
What little that was left over, was made into a great hash the following morning.

The beef came out so tender and juicy, even my extra picky 4 year old ate it!  I put baby carrots, whole, and the bite sized onion pieces in the bottom of my 6 qt. slow cooker and then tossed about 8 (whole) red potatoes on top of those.  I poured in 4 cups of beef broth, because I had it on hand and needed to use it up, and then added the beef brisket w/spice packet.  I skipped the beer as I never have any on hand and cooked everything on low for 8 hours, stirring in the cabbage during the last hour.  Next time I would try 6/7 hours on low and only cook the cabbage 30 min. as the veggies were a little softer than I like.  Thanks for the great recipe, we won't be waiting for next St. Patty's day to try this one again!  :)

This was very good. I did change it up slightly. Instead of beer I used 1/2 cup simply apple apple juice, 1 can of beef broth and water to make 4 cups of juice. I seasoned the meat with dry mustard, garlic powder, pepper, the seasoning packet and a bay leaf. I forgot the pearl onions, but it was good without it. I changed the potatoes to 2 medium white and 2 medium red and used bagged baby carrots. I also did not add the cabbage in the morning due to lack of space. I ended up taking the meat out for 20 minutes and putting the cabbage in to at least get it semi cooked. It was ok, but could have cooked longer and it would have been better. Next time I will chop it up in small pieces and add it right when I get home.   I will be making this again as everyone loved it and the leftovers.

very good.  I had to eliminate the beer because it has gluten in it, but the meat came out very good. I have never cooked corned beef before so I  highly recommend getting a large cut of beef.  It shrinks!

I followed the recipe almost exactly, I added extra beer and didn't put the season packet in...just some minced garlic. I also cooked it at LOW for 6 hours, then high after adding the cabbage for 1 1/2 hours...and it was cooked perfectly through...But SO moist! I have my hubby, 4 kids and a 1 1/2 yr old grandbaby living with me...and every single person LOVED it! I have never made Corned beef before...I am SO happy I used this recipe the first time! Thank you!

This is yummy comfort food, but I have to give it 3 stars, not 4, because I erred on the side of caution and cooked for 8 hours on low instead of high and it turned out great.  The potatoes and carrots were fork tender, but not mush which they definitely would have been if I'd cooked on high for 8 hours as directed.  The meat was moist and easy to shred with a fork.

We loved it, flavor was great. I cooked one hour on high then seven on low. Next time I will add carrots & potatoes 4 hrs. in as suggested, yes, they got mushy. I believe four cups of water was far too much, I had to scoop out and throw out broth as it was overflowing. Maybe my six quart crock pot was too small for this (recipe doesn't mention what size her's was) and I need to adjust for that. Also,not sure what size her ten potatoes were but pounds would have been a more helpful info. 
Will make again with these adjustments in mind.

This was my first time trying corned beef and cabbage, and all I can say is WOW! Tasted fantastic! I followed recipe exactly except for cutting carrots into slices instead of matchsticks. The potatoes were not mushy at all...they were just right! Cabbage cooked quickly, so no problems with that. And, as I followed the directions of the recipe, I did cook it on HIGH. The corned beef was SO tender! Love this recipe, and will definitely make it again! Thank you LUSYRSGIRL for a fantastic recipe. Absolutely delicious!!

Using the crock pot for my corned beef and cabbage makes it a meal we now enjoy once a month or so.  It couldn't be easier just as written.  Thanks!

Turned out beautiful!  I was worried, because I thought it was going to be really tough... it felt 'hard' when I poked at it with a knife in the pot.  But when i took it out and sliced it, it was PERFECT!

The best corned beef and cabbage ever. The key is the beer, a good brand. I added  an entire bottle of Blue Moon and chicken broth in place of water.The  corned beef was super tender and the potatoes, carrots and cabbage seemed even better. Hands down, the only way to cook this delicious meal. Like others suggestions, cook 8- 10 hours on Low, to get beautiful sliced corned beef. Thank you for Sharing.

As the most popular review said...I did not add any liquid besides water. It does NOT need it!!! The beef and season packet makes for a very flavorful meal. DO NOT ADD EXTRA SEASONINGS OR SALT. I added my potatoes from the start and they where not mushy at all. My kids even loved this!

Delicious!  My husband insists that I cook CB & C using this method from now on!  Just a few slight changes; when vegtables are cooked, approximately 5 hrs in, I removed the potatoes, carrots, & onions, turned the crockpot to low, & cooked meat for an hour.  I then added the cabbage & cooked until done, (a little over an hour).  There's now enough room to fit the whole head of cabbage.

Delicious, made exactly as written. Used 6 oz of some cheap beer and could smell it but was not overpowering. Perfect amount. Will definitely use this in the future. Oh by the way, the potatoes and carrots are supposed to be soft.

This is how I've  made my corned beef for years. The main difference is after I remove the corned beef from the crockpot I make a glaze of brown sugar, prepared mustard and juice (apple or pineapple)that I spread over the meat. I put beef in baking dish in the oven for about 20-30 minutes at 375 degrees. While it is baking-I continue to baste while I cook my cabbage stovetop-I don't cook cabbage in crockpot.

The slow cooler is the only way I will cook corned beef. It comes out moist and perfect every time no matter how long you cook it. If cooking all day the veggies do not need to be cut small. I usually put the carrots in whole and the potatoes peeled and cut into 1/2 or 1/4's depending on their size. I would definitely leave the cabbage in large pieces as it cooks fastest. I don't add any liquid but I'm sure the beer would give it a little extra flavor if you like beer.

Substituted beef broth for the water, added a little garlic powder and the whole head of cabbage.  Served with Irish soda bread from this site.  Delicious and easy.

This was SO good! My husband had to leave to go pick up our car right as we started dishing it out. I sent him a text that he better hurry because we weren't going to save him any. 
I used the full bottle of beer and no water and it was SO moist and flavorful. I wish I had it cooking again in my crockpot right now!

This is a good basic recipe. I always cook my corned beef in the crock pot, but I add all of the veggies closer to the end so they aren't mushy, except for the onion. The beer isn't necessary, you can safely omit it if you prefer. I cut the carrots into bite-size chunks instead of matchsticks. Turnips or parsnips are good additions, too.

This was my first time cooking corned beef.  I added the carrots and onion after 4 hours (did the potatoes separately).  The carrots were done in about two hours- next time I will add them with only two hours left.  This was delicious!  So moist and tasty!

this was delish!  Made it exactly like recipe, but left out potatoes (I served it with mashed potatoes instead) and added frozen (thawed) brussel sprouts to last 30 minutes of cooking.  It was YUMMY!!

Really enjoyed this Recipe. Used 1/2 the spice packet (on 3lb. roast) and it was perfect. Used the entire can of Guinness to cover the roast completely, no water. It was excellent! Thanks!

After cooking the brisket, make a glaze of brown sugar, dry mustard, cloves, and a little vinegar (sorry, I don't know the amounts--I just improvise and taste) and slather over the brisket and broil for a few minutes.  St. Patrick would say "heavenly"!

This is the best! I have cooked it in a crock pot before and did not care for it. I have done it in the oven in an oven bag, in the oven without a bag, and my other favorite way was on the top of the stove simmering for several hours. This will definitely be the way I cook it from now on. Great recipe.

Thank you for this excellent recipe!  I did use beef broth as well as water & added the veges at the last hour of cooking as other reviewers suggested. Beef was so flavorful & veges were done perfectly! (reubens R on my dinner menu this week). Definitely WILL make again!

Excellent! My family loved this. I cooked the potatoes, whole carrots, and onions all day on low while I was at work in beef broth with a lot of chopped garlic added to it. The cabbage was put in about two hours before we ate it. Could not have asked for a better meal! Leftovers are being reserved for the reubens we will be making this weekend!

Let me tell you-I am the only one in my house who likes reubens, so this was a hard sell- but it was awesome!!!! My husband and 20 year old son loved this! In fact, the leftovers were actively fought over. They can't wait until we have it again. The best recipe ever!!

Loved it.  Made it with no beer, cooked the cabbage separately, and think will cut the water in half next time.

Best slow cooker corned beef recipe ever. Took others suggestions & used beef broth instead of water. Threw in extra onion, 2 bay leaves,3 cl. garlic,1/2 tsp dry mustard, few peppercorns along w. spice pkt. Cooked on HIGH for 7 hours- don't be scared, it works. Veggies for last 3 hours (added 2 cut-up turnips for St Paddy's). Cabbage for last 1 1/2 hours.  Meat was tender & veggies not mushy .

This is an all time favorite meal for us, why don't we cook it more often than St. Patrick's Day.  I prefer to cook the potatoes separate.  And if there's any leftovers, including broth, just chop up fine, add some grated cheddar or Irish cheese and/or half and half, simmer until cheese melts, and you have a hearty, delicious soup!!

This is how I make my corned beef every year!  I don't use beer...or broth.  I use hard cider and cut the water called for by half and even those who "Ewwww!  I hate corned beef!" Love my corned beef!  I always rinse the slimy stuff off the meat (assume that's the brine) and cut most of the fat off.  Delicious!  I serve with colcannon!

I thought it was wonderful.  It is SO easy to make and it is some of the best corned beef and cabbage I've ever eaten.  The meat and the vegetables are tender and the beer (I used Guiness) added amazing flavor.  Treat yourself and your family and fix this for dinner.  Don't wait until St. Patrick's Day.  It's too good to have only once a year!

I followed the directions exactly as written (except I used baby carrots and 6 large yellow potatos cut in 1/8ths) and it came out perfect.  Cooked everything for 8 hours on high and added the cabbage one hour before finishing.  I let the meat rest for 15 minutes, then cut into 1/2 in slices.  The potatoes and carrots were soft but not mushy. My family and guests, the adults and the kids, all loved it! Thanks for the great recipe!

I had never eaten corned beef and cabbage before trying this recipe.  I only made it because my husband asked for it.  So glad I did!  It smelled so wonderful all day.  I served it with homemade crusty french bread and it was wonderful!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

UPDATE - tried it a couple more times. Good recipe. Used 4c water - no beer or broth. Done in 6-7 hours on high. Improtant to CUT ACROSS THE GRAIN.

Hmmm....I am not sure what I missed but I was very disappointed. I love corned beef but it has always been prepared in a pressure cooker. I was so optimistic on the slow cooker but the texture was stringy and tough. I checked it at 7 hr (at which time it was actually ready) but it was no different at 10 hr. I used a flat cut as one review suggested. Just a few days later we had a corned beef feast at church following the service and it was delicious. Her secrets: 1) simmer for about 2.5-3 hr (just before it wants to fall apart), 2) cool, 3) SLICE ACROSS THE GRAIN. I think that was my main downfall. Good luck!

My new go-to recipe for corned beef & cabbage!  Only a few changes per personal preference: Omit spice pack, very lightly salt and pepper veggies, sprinkle meat with garlic powder, onion powder and black pepper.  Add 2 beef bouillon cube and enough extra water to just cover the meet. Cook on high for 6 hours, then reduce to low for 2 hours. Add cabbage and return heat to high for 1 more hour.

I did not like this at all. I followed the recipe but with everyone else giving it such good reviews I must have done something wrong. It was very oily and did not have much flavor...probably will not make this again.

Everything was well cooked and yummy. My corned beef did not come with a spice packet so I added some garlic powder, cracked black pepper, and a bay leaf (nothing too precise, sorry!) Also, the cabbage didn't fit in the crock pot so I had to cook it separately (see "fabulous fried cabbage" recipe). Very good, I will use this again next St. Patty's day, or maybe sooner...

This was my first attempt at corned beef and cabbage and it was a huge hit with the men in my house. Not a morsel left over! I used one 15 oz. can of beef broth and another 3 1/2 cans of water to cover meat and veggies. Also, my corned beef did not come with a spice pack, so I added 2 Tbsp. of pickling spice. Very easy and tasty meal. This recipe is a keeper!

Since I'm of Irish Heritage, we always cook up corned beef and cabbage for St. Patricks Day. I've tried dozens of recipes and this one is the best of all.   The only change I made was that I just poured in a whole 12 oz can of beer because I don't like to drink beer and I didn't want to let it go to waste!  I also added alot of freshly ground pepper. Delicious!

Made very little change.  Added about 2 tbsp brown sugar, one beef bouillon cube (large Knorr) and some additional pepper and garlic powder. Had a late start, so gave the crockpot 10 min. in the microwave for a headstart. After 7 hours on high, all looked good.  Took out about 2 cups of liquid to add to the cabbage and cooked it in the microwave on high for 12 min.  (Not enough room in the crockpot).  The carrots, potatoes and onion were fine, right from the start. This was a DEEElicious corned beef.  We just couldn't stop going back.  I look forward to having it again as a welcome treat.

This is wonderful!  Every member of my family loved it!!!!  Thanks for sharing a yummy St. Patty's treat....I will make it again and again. The only thing I did different was I reduced cooking time.  I had less than 8 hours so I cooked on high 5 1/2 hours and took out meat to add cabbage with 20 minutes to go.  Meat was tender and cabbage was perfect in 20 minutes.  I made rubens with leftovers and swiss cheese, sourkraut and thousand island dressing the next day.  I also saved the liquid stock from crock pop and a few of the veggies for "left over soup" just add chopped raw veggies, seared onions, rice, pan cooked ground beef, rosemary & pepper for a fantastic soup!

Great version of corned beef and cabbage. I made it exactly as is and it was great. The only thing I may try next time is putting the potatos in with the cabbage so they aren't so mushy. But on the other hand they were good that way...

This is a good recipe, I used it last year BUT, I used beef broth and I do not cut the carrots matchstick style.  You don't get any flavor or texture.  I use whole, peeled baby carrots (easy), and I wait three or four hours before adding those and the potatoes to the pot with the meat so that they don't get mushy, but still are tender and cooked through.  Too bad my mom, who always made corned beef and cabbage on St. Patrick's Day, didn't realize how well the crockpot could easily handle this meal.  She usually boiled it on the stove.  Can't wait till Thursday to make it again!

Yes this was great!  I was making corned beef for a St Pattys party. 6 adults and small kids.  So I bought 2 corned beefed briskest.  1 4.25 lb flat cut and the other was 2.25 lb center cut.  I used 2 crockpots.  The larger meat cut was cooked on High almost the entire time!  The little one was was moved to low and cooked up much quicker.  Added veggies after 4 hrs of cooking. Cabbage went in last 1.5 hrs. I like mine almost mushy cabbage.  I also had veggies going in both crock pots.  So this gave me room for plenty for the party.   One used beer and the other was beef stock and water. My guest liked the flat cut that was in beef broth and not beer. This was plenty of food but not much meat left over.  Will make again and I will cook 1 lb of meat per adult.  Now I will be making Reuben's for my husband and I.  Thanks again!

One of the best I've made.  I usually cook on the stove but had things to do.  I do use half apple juice and half water to cover and started on high for four hours, then switched to low.   Added some extra pickling spices.

I made this to the "T" 3 plus years in a row, it's the best for the effort you put into it, I use a regular lager beer sam adams this year and I will be making 2 ,1 for our family and 1 for my Mom. And I use some left overs for making Reuben sandwiches , which can also found on this site.You may also use the lower sodium Corned beef if you can find it.

Inspite of reviews, I cooked corned beef on high for 8 hours. Vegetables were very tender , but intact. I did leave potatoes whole and carrots in large pieces so that may have helped. Corned beef was very tender. What I did not care for was the beer. I don't like beer, and assumed after cooking that it would blend in with other flavors. It was the prevalent flavor in the vegetables. Will use beef broth the next time.

This is the only way I make corned beef. In fact, I just put it all together in the crockpot.The only change I made was, I didn't add beer. Instead, just enough water to cover everything. I'll cook it on high all day, and add cabbage about an hour before we eat. We'll have rye bread with it, and will have leftovers tomorrow.

I have to agree that beer is not needed.  In fact I would say that it shouldn't be added.  I only looked up the recipe because I haven't done it in a crock pot before. This is also called a New England boiled dinner and is considered an Irish American dish.  The inclusion of beer would be more consistent with a German dish so I omitted the beer, added a few extra black peppercorns and a turnip for flavor.  The only seasoning you need is the packet that comes with the brisket and a few whole black peppercorns.  I also cooked it on low not high.

Really important! I followed this recipe exactly except that I followed other reviewers comments to cook on low as they felt "high" had to be a mistake. Trust me when I say HIGH is correct. After 8.5 hours on low w/a 2.75 pound corned beef I thought certain it would be cooked. I tried a couple bites and it was so tough & chewy...awful! Come to find out, that's because it was severely undercooked. FOLLOW THE RECIPE AS IS otherwise you risk eating undercooked corned beef which is disgusting.

It was super awesome! I added Murphy's Irish Stout for the beer and it cooked wonderful with a great flavor!  I need a bigger crockpot though.

Excellent!  The brisket I bought did not come with a spice packet so followed a recommendation to use pickling spice.  Great suggestion - used about 3 tbsps and everything was so flavourful!  Thank you for this awesome recipe!

Sorry, but I did not care for this recipe at all. Everything was overcooked and had a strangely weak briny taste. Recipe calls for too much liquid, too little seasoning, and way too long cooking time. Instructions that came with the meat said to simmer at 50 minutes for each pound; for me that would have been 4 hours. At simmering. Your recipe calls for 8 hours on high. Wish I would have taken the time to note all this ahead of time. Very disappointing.

This recipe was fantastic. I had a 3 lb corned beef and added the following: 6 red potatoes quartered, 4 peeled carrots and cut each one in threes, 2 small onions, 2 cups of water, 6 ounces of guiness, 2 tbsp of apple cider vinegar and the spice packet. Cooked on low for 7 hours and then added a small head of cabbage (cut in large chunks) to the pot for another hour and a half. Best corned beef dinner I have ever made. I will definitely make it again like this!

This was my First-Ever attempt at making Corned Beef and Cabbage.  I was nervous, because I was making it for my entire family, and I had no idea how it would turn out.  Let me tell you, EVERYONE loved this dish!  It was sooo tender and incredibly delicious, I was so happy with the results!  Although, I did make the following changes:  I chopped up the carrots into large pieces (not matchstick), used all purpose potatoes (quartered), replaced the 4c water with beef broth, and omitted the onions (personal preference).  For the beer, I used about 10 oz. of Smithwick's Irish Ale.  Also, the recipe states to cook this dish on high..I set my slow cooker to LOW and it turned out perfect.  I felt that High was just too hot to cook for 8 hours.  This will be served at my house every St. Patty's Day from now on! (and whenever I can find another excuse to make it lol).  :~)

TURNED OUT PERFECT FOR A 4LB PLUS CORNED BEEF. IF SMALLER PIECE OF MEAT IS USED YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER COOKING AT LOW. FLAVOR WAS FANTASTIC.

Made the recipe as written but followed the advise of others that reviewed and had the crock pot set on low.  Word of advise, cook on high as the recipe calls for otherwise the veggies aren't cooked and the corned beef is tough.

excellent, absolutely needs 8 hours on LOW, not high.  Added cabbage in last half hour per another review but I needed another hour on top of that for the cabbage. This was SO easy, delicious and healthy.  My hus and is normally not a fan but since I am Irish, has suffered through once a year.  This year with this receipe 
he had seconds!!

This was awesome! I followed a lot of other reviewers' advice and added the veggies later. Used beer and beef broth and tweaked a bit to my taste and it was delicious. My Irish boyfriend loved it! Thanks so much for sharing what will be a staple holiday recipe in our home!

This turned out wonderful.  First try at corned beef and cabbage.  The only thing I changed was I put my veggies on top.  The reason being, I got up early and was too lazy to peel my potatoes and carrots, so I put the meat on and went back to bed.  I added the veggies afew hours later.  I didn't have any beer, but the broth was so good, I can't imagine how it could have been better.  Thanks!  This recipe was a taste treat.

This is delicious - full of flavor and easy to fix.  The 6 ounce can of beer is just the right amount.  I used a small bag of baby carrots instead of 4 large carrots.

Never cooked corned beef in a slow cooker before, and since I didn't have any beer, used beef broth as suggested.  Turned out perfect.  Used the cooking liquid to cook the potatoes, carrots and cabbage seperately after the beef was cooked.  Great!

So easy!!!  I brought this into work as a St Patrick's Day treat and everyone loved it...the meat was so tender.  Strangely, my corned beef did not come with a spice packet so I added 2 bay leaves, 2 tablespoons a minced garlic and a couple handfuls of peppercorns.  8 hrs in a slow cooker and one hour on high after adding the cabbage.  I also seasoned the cabbage with Garlic and red pepper seasoning (McCormicks I think)...a success and I will make this again!

Absolutely perfect just the way written.....didn't make any changes.  It's even better the second day.  Now I'm off to find corned beef brisket on sale after St. Patty's day to put in freezer so I can make this all through the year!

I made this yesterday and the meat was tender and juicy. The bad thing, the beef tips that I bought had a horrible flavor packet (too much colves) So the flavor of the beef and veggies was bad. I will make this again and again but be more cautious of the flavor packets. Thanks for the recipe!

I saw a lot of debate over cook times, vegetables on the bottom or add later, etc. I followed the recipe including putting in the vegetables before the meat. I poured a 12 0z. bottle of Guiness on top of the meat  and then added the Corn beef spices. I strayed from the recipe by altering the cooking times: I cooked the dish on high for one hour then reduced it to low and cooked it for 7 hours. I then added the cabbage - chopped, not sliced, and cooked it for two more hours on high. The meat was tender but firm enough to slice thinly. The vegetables were thoroughly cooked but NOT mushy.  The flavor was great, the texture was great and I was able to reheat the leftovers the next day and still maintain the firmness of the vegetables. I cook this dish several times a year and am sticking with this recipe.

Like other reviews, I have to believe the instructions are meant to state that it should be cooked on LOW for 6-8 hours.  I added a whole bulb of garlic roughly chopped, almost 2 pounds of baby carrots and 12 ounces of a dark beer plus enough water to half cover the meat.  It was pretty tasty after the revisions.

Very tasty CB&C...I had to adjust the size of the recipe to fit my 5-1/2 lb slow cooker but the end result was very good...[for the AllRecipe.com developers: it might be a good idea to have users specify in the recipe the size slow-cooker they used]...the only real difficulty I had was that none of my local grocery stores carried a 4 lb brisket...also, the type of beer wasn't mentioned and there are many so the end result can taste different based on which one was used

Excellent!! Wonderful! Delicious! I made this recipe exactly as written. I cooked it on high the entire 9 hours, too. I didn't change a thing and it turned out tender, juicy and so flavorful. The potatoes weren't mushy, either. Those were my biggest concern. Oh! I didn't quarter them, I just left them whole and put them in the bottom of the cooker, along with the other veggies. Thanks for a fantastic, easy way to cook Corned-beef.

This is very similar to one previously I recommend eliminate the water and use Beef Broth instead and use a Lager Beer like Miller High Life.  It is delicious. Cook the meat first until just tender then add the vegetables except for the cabbsge.  When the veggies are tender then add the cabbage and cook abouy 15 more minutes.

This was my first corned beef attempt. It turned out great. There was so much flavor from just the meat and the season package it come with (I did not add beer). Because of the mixed reviews on time I decided to cook it on high for 8 hours as recommended. It was super easy to remove the extra fat and the meat was tender. Because I work full time I had to put the veggies in for the whole time. They were pretty soft but were still in their original shape and even held up for left over re-heatings. I have added this to my recipe box and do intend to make it again.

Fabulous. The corned beef cooked beautifully. I accidentally poured in the full bottle of Guinness Draught (my beer of choice for cooking), it worked out great. Also, I waited until about 4 hours in to add the carrots (I used baby carrots) and potatoes. It is a great recipe. The whole family loved it!

Awesome recipe, and my first time cooking a brisket! I used a whole Napa cabbage head instead of half of a regular cabbage head. Napa takes less time to cook. Also, instead of red potatoes I used honey gold potatoes, which always come out sweet and tender. This is a perfect blend of textures and flavors. I added a few dashes of salt and pepper when I folded in the cabbage. It was perfectly seasoned and yummy!

I used beef broth instead of beer, cooked 4 hours.  On top of beef I added carrots, onion and potatoes and cooked another 2 hours.  Added cabbage and cooked the final 2 hours.  Yummy!

I'm sorry, I mean no offense, but... Its not that I didn't like this recipe, its just that this is not a recipe at all, this is the directions off the corned beef package that you get in the supermarket!  There is absolutely nothing in this recipe that makes it unique or different.  I come to AllRecipes for recipes, not to read package instructions.

This is the second year that I have made this recipe. I did it in the crock pot.   I forgot the onion this time, and frankly, as much as I love onion, I might leave it out again.  I used the whole bottle, 12 oz of Guiness, I hate wasting the beer.  Then topped with water to cover the beef one inch.  I also used 5 medium red potatoes instead of tiny baby ones.  I cut them into bite sized pieces.  These I added  with the carrots at hour 4.   I used as many baby carrots as would fit into the crock pot.  They are a favorite.
 
when we were ready to eat. I pulled some of the juice from the crock and put it in a a large pan.  I chopped the cabbage into small wedges and then braised the cabbage separately to the appropriate softness.  I used the entire cabbage.

My goal is to get the delicious rich corned beef taste while increasing the amount of veggies per serving.  

I let this cook for 9 hours on low and the meat was cut- with -a -fork tender.  

For leftovers I skimmed the fat and it was even better.

FYI I used the corned beef points rather than the flats.

Terrible recipe. The corned beef and vegetables were way, way overcooked and soggy. There is too much liquid and the cooking time should be reduced by half. I was extremely disappointed.

Made this exactly as written, except for slicing the carrots into fairly thin coins. I didn't have 8 hours to cook it, so I cooked it for 6 hours with a combination of high and low heats, mostly high. Everyone enjoyed it and the veggies were a perfect texture. I wish that I had made the creamy horseradish sauce recommended here by others; I think it would have been great. Thanks for the recipe!

The slow cooker is the only way to go for corned beef as far as I am concerned, but putting the vegetables in the pot with the meat made everything taste too much alike. Absolutely no contrast in flavors! The beer was an awesome way to reduce the saltiness you can get with corned beef but it lent an odd flavor to the cabbage and potatoes.

I think next time I would use the beer and water and cook only the meat in the slow cooker. The potatoes and cabbage can go back on the stove with little effort and a better variety of flavors in the meal. I'm not one for cooked carrots anyway!

I've used this recipe for the past 3 years and everyone loves it! I think the only thing I'm going to do differently today is boil the potatoes separately from the roast, only because all that time in the slow cooker makes them very mushy, and the flavor in the potatoes is a little overwhelming. What I prefer is the flavor of the cabbage when you put it in with the roast an hour before it's done, I think it is fantastic and it made the people in my family (who don't like cabbage) actually want to eat it. The problem has been that there was never enough space in the pot to put very much in because of all the potatoes in the bottom, so I would have to boil some of the cabbage separately, and that's the stuff that no one would eat, lol. This will give me more room in the crockpot to do ALL the cabbage, and I'm looking forward to that. :)

good stuff! 4 stars because of my "altering". i used Corona beer. I also added 2tsp of garlic powder, a dash of caraway, and 1 bay leaf. Had 3 carrots, 4 large potatoes, one medium onion, and used a whole small sized cabbage. 4lbs of corned beef. Was sooooo good.

Delicious. However 9 hours is too long, 8 hours its falling apart as it is. I tried to cook it longer but my slow cooker refused. Once you've finished cooking it, take a minute and cut the fat away, aka scrape it away because its SO TENDER! Once you've done that you can REALLY see the grain. Cut across the grain. Some people don't and you could choke. This makes it fork tender, and easy to eat.

I never ate this myself; my husband did and he really liked it. He just prefered it w/out the carrots since he's a big meat and potatoes guy; thought the carrots were too sweet. It was super easy to make since it's a slow cooker recipe and this was the FIRST Irish meal I had ever made. Thanks for sharing!

overall taste was good.But with that being said I cooked it on low for 8 hours. high for that many hours would be way to hot for my crock pot.I also did not cut carrots into match sticks,i put whole baby carrots in.potatoes and carrots were perfectly cooked ,meat tender. would make again

This recipe is impossible to mess up.  I only wish I had purchased a larger corned beef brisket!  The taste of the Guiness Stout that I chose to use really permeated the vegetables, so if you don't enjoy that flavor, try a lite beer or leave it out completely.

This is an excellent version of this wonderful dish. It is the first time I made it in a crock pot. It is almost exactly like my Great Grandmother from Ireland made every year.  For this I used baby carrots because I always have those on hand.  That part is not in Nana's recipe but is delicious.  The only other thing I do differently is to follow tradition and serve the potatoes buttered and parsleyed.  YUM!  Thanks for sharing!

Just the slow-cooker recipe I was looking for! Omitted the onions, and added a spoonful of beef billion to the water for extra flavor. Used Pabst Blue Ribbon beer. Now I've got corned beef hash (also from allrecipes) in the breakfast pan. Thanks for the recipe!

Another successful St Patrick dinner thanks to this recipe.  Had a 3# corn beef so only used 3 cups water and 12 oz beer.  Cooked corn beef seperate for 6 hrs in crock pot then added carrots.  then after an hour poured off juice into large pan and cooked the cabbage.  Then combined it all again.  Did not do potatoes in mix but did the Pioneer Womans Crash Potatoes and topped with asiago cheese.  Added a colorful green dish of sauteed kale and shredded brussel sprouts seasoned with garlic and red pepper flakes. Did the Skillet Soda Bread from Allrecipes using bread flour instead of regular white.   Dessert was Pistachio Cake and Pistachio pudding.  Put it on my all green dishes table and had a  feast.  Hubby said "You have cooked many good meals  but this my dear was one of the very best"

Both my parents are from Ireland.  Never added beer to any type of cooking, just drank it on the side.  Always just had cabbage and potatoes in the same pot of beef.  Cabbage gets its taste from the water .  If you cook it by itself there is little flavor.  My Great Aunt used to drink the water?? Said that is where the vitamins were??

You can start this on high for an hour or so but definitely finish on low 8-10 hours. I buy nylon "footies" (like 10 pairs for $2) and put the spices in one and tie it off. Put this in with the meat and you won't have pieces of spices to pick out of your teeth afterward.

I made mine without the beer (and with beef broth instead).  Very simple!

I cooked this on low yet my veggies turned out mushy.  I would use guiness beer next time.  I used whatever beer we had on hand and it wasn't nearly as good as the recipe on this site that uses guiness.

I made this recipe tonight for the first time.  This was wonderful. Everything was great.

I made just as directed. I used salt as a "spice packet" and it dried the corned beef a bit.  I gave it 4 stars because cabbage was not listed as part of the ingredients and had it not been for me reading the recipe i would have forgotten to by it.  Also I felt 4 cups of water was way too much.  Next time i will use only 2.

The ease of cooking the beef was awesome and it didn't smell up the house (my husband hates this meal). Sadly, it was also not edible as the cabbage was way over done and turned to mush.

Simple and delicious!  I've always done my corned beef on the stovetop but will never go back.  This turned out just as well and had so much more flavor.  My corned beef didn't come with a spice packet so I just added some whole peppercorns.  Absolutely mouthwatering and enjoyed by all!

This was excellent!  My corned beef didn't come with a spice packet, so I added peppercorns, garlic and bay leaves.  Used Corona for the beer and cooked 4 hours on high then turned it to low for the last 4 hours.  Was perfect!

This was yummy!  I cooked the beef by itself for t2 hours on high in beef broth and some spices.  I found that this helps pull out some of the fat from the meat.  Then i take out the meat and pour out the now oily broth. I put the veggies on the bottom, meat on top, and cover it with the spices. i added enough broth and water to cover everything and cooked on low for 5 more hours.  I omitted the beer because i didnt have any on hand but i would like to try it with the beer next time.  Everyone in my family loved this dish. i would highly recommend it!

This was an awesome dish! I did not add the beer but added more water to make sure the brisket was mostly covered to ensure it didn't dry out. Since I picked out small baby red potatoes, I did not quarter them but I recommend doing so because even cooking all day, they came out harder than we liked.
I cooked the brisket, potatoes and carrots on low all day. I did add in the cabbage an hour before it was time to eat and I would probably add it in earlier.

This is the best corned beef since my mother made it for St. Paddy's day when I was a kid.  I bought 6 corned beefs just so I could make this more often.

My husband and I really enjoyed this. I followed the recipe's instructions for cooking time and temperature and it came out perfectly. I did use baby carrots and left the potatoes whole just for simplicity. I used the whole head of cabbage sliced into very thin wedges and just sat it on top of everything in the slow cooker for the last hour of cooking and it steamed perfectly.

So so good!!! I cooked a 2.5 lb brisket, so I halved the recipe with a few nominal changes. I used a full can of beer and 1.5 cups of beef broth instead of water. I used a whole small bag of baby carrots. (1 pound, perhaps? I didn't pay attention to the weight, just that it's the small bag.) I still used a whole onion and I left out the cabbage. I took the advice of other reviewers and cooked it on low instead of high for 8 hours, then switched it to warm until hubby got home. It was spectacular! I can't wait to make Reuben sandwiches out of the leftover corned beef!

This was pretty good, but I think I prefer the Corned Beef Roast recipe on this site. The beer added a good flavor, I just prefer the texture in the oven, I think. Maybe I will combine the two recipes next time :).

Shockingly good. Usually, my crockpot roasts are dry, this was moist and delicious. Perhaps it was the large amounts of sugar and salt in the packet :) I added the veggies half way through the cooking as other cooks recommended. Skipped the cabbage (I knew it wouldn't be eaten). Served it with a side of leftover sauerkraut...hey, I'm German-American, not Irish! I only cooked 2 lbs and I still have half left over to make reubens another day.

Really good and really easy.  Made this last night along with an irish soda bread and the meal was delicious.  I cut the water back to 3 3/4 cups and used a full bottle of Sam Adams Oktoberfest beer.  Also sprinkled the beef generously with garlic powder and pepper along with the seasoning packet.  Cooked on high in the crock pot for 5 1/2 hours and was wonderfully tender and flavor was great.  Will definitely cook it this way again.  Thanks for a delicious recipe.

I made this yesterday using two bottles of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale-my hubbies tipple- the spice packet, a handfull of black peppercorns and water added to cover the meat. Slow cooked for exactly 8 hours. It came out just perfect. For a sauce I heated a halfcup of plain yellow mustard with a couple of teaspoons of -hot- horseradish and a little sugar. My husband loved it!

This recipe is SO GOOD. Yes, cook it on high (not low) for 8 hours and yes, put the meat on top of the veggies, and yes, put all that water in. It was amazingly tender and delicious!  I didn't have any beer and I added garlic cloves, but other than that and the omission of cabbage (hate it), I made the recipe exactly as stated. It was yummy and I highly recommend!

I read a lot of reviews then decided to go ahead and cook on high for 8 hours. The last 30 minutes I took out the corn beef and added the cabbage.  Cabbage was too tough so I let it cook for another 30 minutes.  Still not tender for me so I finally decide to take it out and put it in a pot to cook on the stove. Next time I will add the cabbage 2 hours before it's ready. I didn't use the beer but I used 2 Beef bouillon cubes.  AWESOME  will definitely make this again

I made this for a dinner party and it came out perfect. I did however heed the reviews that suggestion an hour on high was WAY too much so cooked it on low for 8 hours. Came
Out perfect...wish I had taken a picture! There was not a drop left and I cooked a 4 pound piece of meat and only had 4 guests for dinner.  I didn't have any cabbage left because I used the whole head for the colcannon to go with it but did have Brussels sprouts that I threw in an hour before we ate.  They came out perfect too!  Will definitely mark this as a keeper recipe!

This is the way I make my corned beef, however I have found that putting apple cider and a stick of cinnamon instead of beer gives the vegetables a wonderful flavor and cuts the saltiness of the corned beef.

This was a hit tonight for our St. Patricks Day Meal.  I made some changes though... I set my Slow Cooker to LOW for 8 hours, and I didn't add any veggies until 4 hours in.  I added the Cabbage for the last hour.  It all came out wonderful.  Also, I served it with the Creamy Horseradish Garlic Spread from this site which kicked it WAY up a notch.  Thanks to naples34102 for their suggestion in their Review!

This recipe has good flavor, but the recipe calls for too much water, turning the vegetables into total mush. Considering the cost of the corned beef, this recipe didn't pull through, and I won't be making it again.  The positive takeaway is the peppery veg-beef broth I froze to make a veg barley soup in the dead of winter.

I cooked the potatoes, carrots and meat on low for 8 hours adding the cabbage after 7 hours.  The cabbage was not done to our liking in fact was too crunchy so I steamed it.  I also just used water for the liquid.  The next time I will put the cabbage in about 2 1/2 hours before the remainder of the meal is finished cooking.  The other vegetables were perfect; the meat outstanding.  I will do it again this way next year.

The corned beef was just perfect, although like others suggested, I did add garlic powder.I did add the beer, I don't like to drink it, but oddly enough like it to cook with. 
Definitely no salt needed at all. I did put the potatoes/carrots in 3 hours into it, and the cabbage last 1 1/2 hours.  A little nervous about 8 hours on high, but it was fine. Maybe some have different temps on their crock pots.

Using the changes I made brings it to 5 stars! It's hard to figure out what to do from all the mixed reviews of cooking it on high and low. I did the first hour on high, and then put it on low for the rest of the time. I used 4 cups of water and a full bottle of bud light, since I didn't want a strong flavor of beer added to the meal. The potatoes and onions were the only vegetables I put in from the start and I did not quarter/cut them at all. I added the carrots in the last 2 hours, they were still mush(they were baby carrots, so if they were thicker they may not have been so mushy). I will likely add them in the last 45mins/hour next time. I cooked the cabbage separately in a covered skillet. The end result was awesome! I will definitely refer to this recipe next year, and pair with the Irish coffee recipe for St.Patrick's Day! :-)

We made our St. Patricks' dinner just as the recipe states and cooked it in the crockpot for 8 hours on high.  Sounded like too long at a high temperature; but we read others' reviews and did it by the recipe.  It turned out wonderful.  The veggies were not mushy at all and the corned beef was perfect.

This was great and yes I did cook the beef for 8 hours on high.  Perfect!  I couldn't believe it would have taken that long given I have cooked many other things in the slow cooker.  If I had cooked it on low it would not have been ready in 8 hours.  I used the flat cut which is leaner.  I thought I would have had enough for sandwiches or soup, but my company devoured the roast.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I agree with others with the cabbage and other veggies, should add it later in the process to avoid it getting too done.

This recipe turned out well but I would make a couple of changes.  First of all, half the amount of liquid without the beer would be plenty.  I also cooked this on low all day and the potatoes were mush.  So, I will add the potatoes and carrots after the corned beef has cooked for a while.  The corned beef was fork tender, and in my opinion cooked perfectly.

This is the second time I have used this recipe. Great the second time too. I use beef stock and not water. Chunkier cut carrots, more potatoes and a bit more beer. After reading some of the reviews there may be some temperature variations with slow cookers. The "High" setting may be too high for some cookers.

This is our favorite! It is so moist. I do not put my veggies in the crock pot though. I roast the veggies in the oven and sauté the cabbage seperately with garlic salt and pepper and olive oil.

I saved this recipe because it's one of my favorite.  Tip: Add a small amt (1/3 to 1/2 cup) coffee to the liquid--it adds an amazing and earthy undertone to the overall flavor and makes this a spectacular dish.

Delicious! This went so fast at the party I brought it to. Super easy, but doesn't look or taste like it was that easy. I didn't have beer so I used 6oz beef broth.

I just started using a crock pot again and I was worried about this recipe as the pot was just crammed full.  So full, I took part of the corned beef out and froze it for later.  Wrong idea - the meat shrinks quite a bit and it would have been just fine had I left it alone.  Other than that "whoopsie", the meal turned out fabulous.  I followed the recipe as is - everyone loved it and asked me to make it again!  And that is a rarity around here!  :)

I love this recipe.  Makes the best corned beef.  The only thing I do different is that I use the glaze recipe on this site for Corn Beef and Lentils.  I pop the corned beef under the broiler for about 5 minutes with the glaze.  Delicious!

Used this several times for corn beef.  Is a good and simple combo.  Start on high to bring the cooker up to temp if you wish but do turn it to low for the bulk of the eight hours.

I always thought corned beef was hard to make, we would have it maybe once a year. This recipe is so easy to make and the flavor and tenderness of the meat is amazing.

A success! I added some peppercorn spice rub to the top of the beef and followed the rest of the recipe exactly, except I didn't have an onion. It came out great and wasn't tough at all. My cabbage didn't get quite done in an hour, but I think that's because I had to unplug my crock pot and transfer it so it cooled off a bit too much. Fantastic easy way to do a corned beef dinner.

I can only comment on the temperature since I didn't add anything but 4 cups of water (and it was wonderful!). I ended up cooking it on high for the 8 hours as the recipe says and it was moist and falling apart (which was my goal). There were a lot of reviews that suggested cooking it on low. The high temperature makes it tender and delicious!

My first time trying the traditional St. Patty's meal and it came out wonderful.  The only changes I made was I used Milwaukee's Best Ice beer that I got from a friend. I will definately make this again.  BTW, Wieght Watcher's points plus is about 12 per serving.  :)

I changed the recipe just a bit. I did not use beer. I sliced up a sweet onion and crushed 2 cloves of garlic and added to the slow cooker. I then put the corned beef round in and covered with the water. I put a heaping Tablespoon of good pickling spice in a coffee filter and tied it with string. I added it to the pot and put the cover on and cooked on high for 6 hours. When done I drained the broth off into a large pot and cooked the potatoes, carrots and cabbage. I covered the corned beef and kept warm until the veggies were done. Sheer perfection. Thanks for sharing.

Should be a 10 Star ! Only things I modified were instead of stout beer used normal beer and baby carrots instead of shredding..... Something you might find helpful is instead of putting the seasoning on top of the meat I took a coffee filter 4cup and emptied the seasoning packet in the filter and tied it with a bread tie and placed it in the water. It adds addition flovering to everything without having the seasonings stuck in your teeth . Great Recipe !

Followed recipe exactly and it was the best corned beef I've ever made. I don't know what it is... perhaps the layering of the veggies underneath with the water, and the beer poured on top. All the veggies were perfect, not mushy, and they tasted good. I was hesitant to cook it on high (instead of low) for 8 hours, but it was wonderful! The cabbage was perfect too.

After following the advice of others I ended up with an undercooked brisket that tasted like cabbage. In fact, everything tasted like cabbage. I will not be repeating this with the cabbage in it.

This was absolutely the BEST corned beef ever! So tender and moist, we didn't even need a knife to cut it with. I used Guiness in mine, and also cooked it on low instead of high. AMAZING!! Won't be using any other recipe for corned beef!!!

Easy & pretty good though a little bland. I used a 12oz. beer & reduced the water to 3 cups (the slow cooker creates more liquid so I didn't want the flavor of the broth to become too diluted). Also, I added a few good grinds of black pepper & a capful of apple cider vinegar. I let the veggies cook until almost tender then removed them & put them in a casserole dish with a few pats of butter, minced garlic, salt & pepper to put them in a 375* oven until tender & slightly browned on the tips & edges (just a preference over the boiled flavor/consistency). After these changes it was a St. Paddy's Day meal that went over well!

Family loved it! I cooked on low for 8 hours. I added the veggies, minus the cabbage, 4 hours into it. Added the cabbage for the last hour and it was perfect. I used Bud Light and added a bit of garlic powder. I think next time I will use the suggestion of a tea ball or maybe wrap the seasonings into cheesecloth to avoid having to pick out the peppercorns and other spices.

I've had this in my recipe box for years, but just made it for the first time tonight. I followed the recipe as written with the minor adjustment of removing the veggies for the last hour while I cooked the cabbage since I didn't have enough room for everything, and I did turn the heat down to low for the last half of the cooking time since my slow cooker runs a little hot. It was really good, a great 'meat and potatoes' dish. I ended up adding a little bit of a horseradish sauce on the side and am glad I did since in all honesty I think that saved it from blandness. To me it was a great holiday meal and I'm sure I'll make it again.

Wow this recipe is amazing! It was my very first time cooking st pattys dasy dinner on my own and I wanted to use my new crockpot. Usually my spouse doesn't like corned beef hash but his reaction to this recipe was priceless!!! He kept saying how delicious it was. I was so proud. I made it exactly the way this recipe called for and the corned beef was super moist and tender, just fell apart. The veggies were perfectly cooked and full of flavor. I used miller lite beer. I thought that 8 hours on high was going to be too much but it wasn't. I checked it at 6 hours and it wasn't quite ready. This will be my recipe every year now :)

This is my go to corned beef recipe.  Today will be the third time I've ever made corned beef.  I'm not sure what it tastes like other than this recipe, but I figure if I like it I should stick with it.  It's not too salty, super easy, and fairly cheap.

This recipe works well to cook the meat but I do not add vegetables. I instead do the veggies separately in a pot on the stove because if cooked in the crock pot they come out pretty greasy.

I found the  corned beef brisket I bought with the spices had too many peppercorns losing the flavour of the beef.  I also removed the vegetables 1/2 way through the cooking time as they were getting to soft.   However, the meal turned out very tasty...the beef melted in your mouth...definitely will make again.

This was so good!  The corned beef was so tender and moist.  I've never cooked anything on high for that length of time, so, to be on the safe side I did it on low.  The veggies weren't mushy at all and it made a delicious broth!  I'll definitely make this again and again and again!

I made this for my family (three are small children) and everyone loved it. It was moist and falling apart. It had a bit of a  sweet taste, might be from the type of beer I used. This was a delicious meal that I will be making frequently. Thanks for the great recipe.

THe best corned beef I've ever made. Didn't change anything except added a little pickleing spice to augment the seasoning packet and turned down the heat from high to low with two hours to go.Veggies were not mushy at all. They were cooked perfectly. The flavors in the beef were superb. Made for nice sandwiches for three days after. This recipe will be my only corned beef and cabbage recipe I ever use from now on.

Excellent!  I usually don't write reviews for recipes but this one was a hit with the whole family (even small children)!  It looked like everything was coming along quite well so I put the cabbage in after 6 hours and everything was done after 7 hours.  This recipe is definately a keeper!  Thank you for posting it!

Very good.  The only change I made was adding beef broth instead of water.  I used a can of Guinness and put the veggies in half way through the cooking time.

I made this for St. Patrick's Day and it was wonderful.
Rather than the brisket cut, I used a 4 pound round cut of corned beef and increased the cooking time to 12 hours on low in the slow cooker. The round cut has very little shrinkage, but needs much longer slow cooking. It is also less fatty than brisket.

This is hands down the best Corned Beef and Cabbage recipe I've ever made! When I went to take the Corned Beef out of the Crock Pot it almost fell off the fork, I could have cut it with a butter knife it was so tender! The only thing I'd add it a some garlic.

This was quite tasty and oh-so-easy. Mostly followed the recipe even though I've never cooked anything but cabbage and potatoes w/my corned beef before. I put my veggies in at the get-go and had no problem with them falling apart/being too mushy. They were nice and soft but kept their shape. The only changes I made were to use regular old Idaho potatoes and just cut my little mini carrots in half/thirds instead of doing matchsticks. What can I say...I'm lazy. Used a local beer, Mt. Caramel, which has more body than say a Bud Light but definitely not as robust as a Guinness and it was quite delicious. Cooked on low for about 7.5 hours and I thought it was a skosh (sp?) dry; no one else did. Also, I realize all cabbage heads are not created equally, but half of mine wasn't enough; wish I had put the whole thing in, if it'd have fit. A big thank you to naples34102 
for suggesting Grandma Andrew's Irish Soda Bread - I actually wound up making the Penguin Lady's Irish Soda Bread and it was the BEST bread I've ever had/made - and the Creamy Horseradish & Garlic Spread. Wow. Delish and would be great on regular beef, too. Winning dinner all around.

This was a disaster because of the reviewers!  So many said to cook it on low for 8 hours.  No way!  I have an older Rival crockpot and when I checked it at 6 hours, I could tell it was NOT going to be tender in 2 hours.  So I turned it up to HIGH and ended up having to remove everything from the crock pot at dinner time and put the meat on the stove to cook in the water for another hour; I had to also cook all the vegies as they were still hard.  

It's not fair for me to evaluate the original recipe for the reviewer's recs so I've giving it an ok at 3 stars.  We ate 1 1/2 hours after planned and it wasn't as good as my usual method of cooking on the stovetop.

Beware of following these reviewers and know the level of cooking your crockpot normally does.  I'm assuming the newer crockpots are more powerful.

I used a whole beer and just took out some of the water. I think I will add some extra spices as the beer stole the game in flavor. My boyfriend said I should have made twice as much so we had more leftovers. I also took the meat out to rest and added the cabbage for twenty minutes and it was prefect with just alittle crunch.

This was delicious!  I've been making corned beef and cabbage for quite a few years now and have never been happy with it.  But, this recipe was super easy and so good.  My Irish/English hubby, and my 5yo twins had seconds.  I think next, though, that I'll do the recipe as is, but also add some extra potatoes have way through since the potatoes do get very well cooked.

Good, easy recipe. Definitely don't cook this on High for 8 hours. I cooked it on high for the first 2 hours, then read other reviews and switched it to low for the last 6 hours. I used 3 cups of water and 12 oz beer (Left Hand Milk Stout - similar to Guinness). I felt like the potatoes were mushy, so next time I will put the meat on the bottom and potatoes, carrots, and onions on top. Also, be sure to trim the beef.

This was my 2nd St. Patrick's Day to make this recipe and both times it was a resounding success.

 I feel like there are never enough spices in the packet included with the corned beef so I added more of the ones I could identify such as coriander and mustard seed. I wouldn't change anything except for putting the cabbage in about 45 minutes before serving if you want it to maintain any sort of pop. Otherwise it's just another texture.

FANTASTIC!! I didn't use cabbage in this dish (since we were having it in another dish).  The meat was soooo tender!  Can't ask for an easier dish for St. Patricks Day!

This was excellent. I used about a cup of water and a bottle of Coors, it was all I had. Put chopped veggies, carrots and onions on bottom, then liquid, the beef and small peeled whole potatoes on top. Was only left with two whole potatoes, they discinigrated. lol. Will add them later next time. also added chopped cabbage last 30 minutes. You must season everything I used garlic powders, season salt, etc. This is a blandish dish to begin with but it was nice and everything was very tender.

Excellent!  I used beef broth instead of water & used Guinness for the beer.  I also added some spices: garlic, bay leaves, cinnamon, pepper, ground cloves & seasonall.  Yummy!

I made this for st. patricks day and it was so good!it was the first time I made corned beef and cabbage, a few suggestions i have, first sear the meat on all sides for about 10 minutes then take the meat out pour in the beef and spice packet in frying pan to get the brown bits then add to crockpot, and I think using less water is better.

This wasn't what we were hoping for.  I didn't go by the directions, I went with a recommendation to add beef broth and beer , I wouldn't do that again,( my mistake) it just gave it an odd flavor.  One reviewer said the reason it usually comes out dry or tough was because you need to use the flat corned beef, well that's what I used and it wasn't very tender.  I think I'll just do it the old fashioned way and cook  it on the stove with water and spice packet next time.
I would have given it a 3 if I were to rate it on my alterations to the recipe.

Excellent. I made a few changes. I added 1C water, 1 12oz beer, and 1 cup of beef broth for the liquid. I also added 1 T of brown sugar to the broth before I added it to the pot. I kept 1/2 of the cabbage head aside and after taking out the veggies and meat, I put the juices in a pot and cooked the 1/2 head of cabbage in that for 10 minutes. I then mixed a flour water mixture into the juices to make a gravy with was very good to add with soda bread.

This was my first time making corned beef this way, and it was our first time eating this way also. I was in a rush so didn't have time to "play" with the recipe, just followed the recipe exactly as stated. I cooked 10 hours on low, and added the cabbage a 1/2 hour before serving. Everyone loved it! The meat was SO tender and delicious. I found the potatoes and carrots to be a little bland, but nothing that a few extra spices couldn't fix. Will definitely make this again, thank you!

Used fingerling potatoes and cut carrots into bite-sized pieces (didn't read the instructions on that beforehand).  Very tasty!  Very easy!

I decided to try using the slow cooker for my corned beef this year.  I questioned 8 hours on high, but I think this is what it really takes for best results.  I tried the meat at various stages.  Super easy recipe and very convenient!  I didn't bother with the beer either.

This turned out great!  I used baby carrots instead of cutting up whole carrots.  So Yummy!  I was afraid there would be a lot of leftovers, but there's just enough for my lunch tomorrow (Lucky me!!!)

So I made this for our traditional Irish dinner and I cook corned beef every year and almost always in my experience it's tough and chewy, since I like the leaner flat cut. I bought a round roast this time which had very little fat, so I was concerned about the toughness; but it was not all tough.
The only alterations I made was I put the whole bottle of beer in and Becks was all I had and it seemed to add a nice flavor;  I also added a little beef broth. I put the veggies on top and left some of my red potatoes whole and halved the rest to prevent too much break up. I cooked for exactly nine hours and it was delicious; my husband never gets seconds of corned beef, but he did this time. One caveat, corned beef needs to be sliced against the grain and I like mine thinly sliced. Fabulous recipe and a keeper in my house!

Make sure you set your crock-pot on LOW not high...and it turns out great!!!  We left ours in for 9+ hours (with potatoes and carrots) and it was soooo yummy!  I put the cabbage in for about the last hour or so and it wasn't soggy at all :)

This wasnmy first attempt at corned beef and cabbage and it was a total success!  I had the meat and carrots/potatoes in a bit longer than it called for but it still turned out great.  When I got home from work I took the meat out and cooked the cabbage on high for about an hour.  The only negative was that the carrots did not end up tasting very good.  I will definately use this recipe again!

Very good, but I am not sure if the directions said to cook on high for 9 hrs??  That seemed too long on high, I cooked on low for 9 hrs and then my slow cooker turned to warm for the next 1-1/2, it was moist and delicious.  I also used red potatoes, unpeeled and cut in 1/2 & baby carrots, they were not mushy either. Would make again this way.

I cooked this on low for 9 hours, and was very pleased. The potatoes were cooked, but not mushy, and the flavor from the spices that came with the meat infused into everything! I'm not always comfortable cooking big hunks of meat, but this was easy and a huge hit in my house.

Excellent meal. I served that for my company on St. Patricks Day and even the one person who doesn't normally like corned beef liked this enough to ask for the recipe so I gladly shared. I used the whole can of beer and the vegetables did not turn mushy at all. Instead of water I did half with a beef broth as another reviewer suggested.  I also added 3  whole cloves of garlic and a bay leaf.

This turned out really good! Made a huge batch, I could barely fit the lid on the crock pot. I put the potatoes in whole and just used a package of baby carrots. I just used the whole head of cabbage because I didn't want to waste it. I added 3 beef boullion cubes and a couple bay leaves. Probably not entirely necessary but, I had them on hand. Had great flavor. This will probably be our annual St. Patty's day meal. Oh, and don't cook on high. 8 hours on low is perfect.

this was a good recipe. I did add more beer than called for. I also cooked it on low for 8 hours instead of high and put the veggies in about 1 hour before it was done to prevent them from getting to mushy.

I agree with debi.  You do not need to add anything but the water and spice pouch.  I too have been making my corned beef in the crock pot for years.  I just add water to barely cover the meat add the spice packet and let it cook.  I add the veggies about 2-3 hours before the meat is done.  This recipe is great as is!

Corned beef was delicious!  I cooked on low for 8 hours after covering with a bottle of root beer (I don't keep beer in the house).  My crock pot wasn't big enough to accomodate all the vegetables, it will depend on how big your briscuit is (mine was 3.5#).

Very salty.  I have to agree with some of the others who rated this about WAITING to add veggies at the end..  I personally did not like this.. Apparently I'm not a CB & Cabbage fan.

This was a good recipe, had good flavor, tender.  A little salty. I cooked it in the crockpot and used Heineken beer.  I didn't care for the whole peppercorns, but think cracked pepper would be fine or putting the peppercorns in a bag.

Used 4c. beef broth instead of water. Added some smashed garlic cloves and parsnips and the rest of the beer bottle by the end of cooking (12 oz). I was worried about 8 hours on high and planned to do 50/50 low but left it on high because I added vegetables after 5 hours and that ‘cooled’ down my pot. I couldn’t fit my cabbage in my crockpot at the end so I just put some of the cooking liquid into a saucepan and cooked it stovetop. My party of 10 said it was the best they had ever had. I haven’t had this dish since I was a child and thought I hated it...I changed my mind tonight!

I found this recipe years ago and my lil Irish family loves it!! It's our St. Patrick's Day tradition. I've made two tweaks though -  1. No Guinness beer, just water.  2. I also add the cabbage in the last 1 1/2 - 2hrs (I always watch the cabbage for it's consistency). 
WOW - the house smells delish all day, the flavors are insane and the meat is super juicy! Winner, winner corned beef dinner!!

This recipe was absolutely DELICIOUS.  It was the first time I've ever made Corned Beef & Cabbage myself.  My husband never had it before and he said I could make it again for dinner anytime!  Very yummy.  

Never thought 1 hour for the cabbage at the end would be enough, but it was just perfect. And we both noticed that we were not "gassy" the next day. I'm not sure if it was due to the short cooking time of the cabbage or what, but we want it again!

I added Brussel sprouts instead of cabbage and it was amazing. Replaced water with beef broth for added flavor, plus one bay leaf.

I made this for New Years however, I did add the carrots, quartered potatoes and onions at 4 hours to prevent from getting mushy. I also cooked my cabbage on the stove in some of the broth because we like our cabbage a little crunchy! Only used the seasoning packet in the brisket and it turned out great at 8 hours on low ??

Cooked it for my picky husband and two picky children. It was a hit! Cooked on LOW for 9 hours. I used 4cups of beef broth instead of beer and added 1/2 cup of water to cover the corned beef. I also added garlic/onion powder as well as pepper. I added vegetables 4 hours into the cook time and the cabbage about 2 hours before it was all done. It was good and would make it again! Thanks to everyone's suggestions!

I first roast the veggies in the oven and then add them into the slow cooker for the last hour for a more distinctive taste and texture. I also get the smallest onions I can find and halve them before roasting and then adding them during the last hour of cooking.

I used a 12 oz. can  of lager and cut cabbage into wedges and added wedges and carrots for the last 2-3 hrs of cooking. Total off 8 hrs on low with a corned beef round. Came out tender and very moist and flavorful!

Great recipe!  I personally leave out the beer as no on in my family cares for the beer flavor.  Sometimes I add the cabbage and sometimes I leave it out and it still turns out great.  I use baby carrots most of the time so I don't  have to peel the carrots.  The potatoes and carrots turn out well and not mushy.  I also cook on low instead of high as others have commented.

I would give this 4 1/2 stars if I could. The beer made all the difference. I recommend an English Ale due to its richness and pleasant after taste. 

Lastly, I only used half the water because I didn't want the final product to be too soupy and I waited until 1 1/2 hours before the meat was finished before adding the vegetables.

This was fantastic! Though I believe there is a typo-I wouldn't cook this on high for that long. I cooked 5lbs of meat in my slow cooker, (2-2.5 pkgs)added both spice packets and some fresh ground sea salt and pepper. I followed this recipe, but only used 2 cups of water. I cooked it on low for 8 hours. Added the carrots midway, and then added the cabbage for the last hour. This is our keeper recipe for corned beef in the slow cooker!

I use this recipe everytime. I use baby carrots and sometimes I leave the beer out. The meat cooks perfectly. The soup ends up needing a good amount of salt and pepper but overall it comes out very good.

Slow-Cooker Corned Beef & Cabbage Haiku: "Easy & tastes great. Didn't want potato 'mush', so added later." That was the only thing that I did differently from the recipe - put the potatoes in at 4 hrs., and continued w/ everything else (cabbage w/ 1 hr. to go), then pulling the delicious meal out at 8 hrs. even though the smell invited me to want to eat it sooner than that!

This was good, however I did have to take the potatoes and carrots out of the slow cooker 4 hrs before the meat was done because they were falling apart. Next time I will wait and put the veggies in half way through.

Loved this recipe. Stayed pretty much with the recipe although i added the whole bottle of Shiner Bock, added one cup of apple juice and 2 cups water due the the other liquid changes. it was so good and all of my firends thought so too. The apple juice made the carrots a bit sweeter. (or was that the beer.) I normally make mine in the pressure cooker to save time but this was great. I cooked on high for 5 hours and then on low for 3 more.  Added vegetables in about half way through.

I used beef broth (about 1 cup) and didn't add the extra water. I cooked on low 6 hours, then added the cabbage and cranked to high for 2 more. The veggies were perfect (I omitted onion); the roast wasn't quite as falling apart tender as we usually like it but still great! I think next time I would add a cup of water to cut the saltiness of the beef broth and cook the roast on high 4 hours, then add the potatoes and carrots and continue cooking as directed. I didn't want mushy veggies, but did think the roast needed more time at the higher temp.

This turned out awesome! Followed recipe exactly (except dumped in entire 12 oz of beer). Turned out perfectly. Served with some grainy mustard - yum!

I omitted the beer and waited until the halfway mark to add my veggies. They still came out mush. They probably didn't need anymore than two hours. I think I'm gonna stick with my stove top method.

This is such an easy way to make corned beef! I've been using a different recipe for years but it's a lot harder, babysitting every step for several hours. This is great, just throw everything in. Only problem I have is that I can't fit everything in my crock pot so I boiled some of the vegetables and cabbage in a separate pot. My family loves it!

Delicious.  I am wondering, when people say that the meat was dry, could it be the cut of meat or the age of the animal.  So no matter how you cook it, it will be tough and dry.

I don't know what problems other users had, but this is the easiest and best recipe for Corned Beef and Cabbage!
I followed the recipe pretty much exactly as written and it was so tender it fell apart!

I make corned beef a few times a year.  This way by far my husband's favorite recipes I've attempted.  The reason I gave it only four stars is it came out a little dry.  I cooked it for less time, and it still dried out.  Maybe next year cook it with more water.  Great flavor, and the veggies were awesome.

I made this just a few weeks ago.  Very easy instructions, the cooker was much smaller than the recipe called for so I bought corned beef that was about 2.5 lbs, and I still ended up cutting off some of it to make it fit better. I didn't use the beer (don't like the taste), just beef broth.  The corned beef was SO TENDER!  We could've used a spoon instead of a fork to eat it.  I just didn't like how the vegetables turned out taste wise.  I know I wouldn't have liked it with the beer definately, but the potatoes were saturated with the flavor of the broth, but the beef, carrots and cabbage were delicious!  I want to try this again only trying a different broth that's not so salty. : )

I made this and it was fantastic.  The only thing I did differently was use some bouillion cubes instead of plain water.  I like the extra beef taste.  Very easy to throw together.  I used Heineken, since I have a kegerater with that at my constant disposal.  I made a fresh loaf of Irish soda bread with it and it was awesome.  I had five kids and six adults over and there were no leftovers.  I'll be making this more than just on St. Patty's day because it was so super easy!

We were disappointed with this recipe. I added the whole spice packet, and changed the liquid a little. I used 3 cups of water and one whole beer. So not much changed, but we thought it had very little flavor. Really bland is what dh said. Oh well, thanks anyway, but I won't be making this one again.

I changed this up a bit but it turned out amazing. Best I've ever tasted!
*changes:
-cooked in pot on oven med heat 2.75 hrs
-removed Corned beef from pot, used olive oil and beef seasoning rub on both sides of beef.
-Placed in oven 450 till both sides crispy browned.
...
I used cabbage and red potatoes to make amazing mashed potatoes, add butter, bacon, garlic, salt and pepper

Delicious! Adapted by: full bottle of Guinness, whole baby red potatoes, baby carrots, 4 hours high then 4 hours low, added cabbage and cooked until done.  Meat just fell apart with a fork. Yum!

Putting the potatoes and carrots in that early made them too mushy for me, plus mine came out very salty and I followed the recp exactly, I was dissapointed.

I was surprised that this broth had so much flavor and the recipe was so easy that I am switching from my tradition method to this one.  I even tried it the next day on the stove top, keeping the veggies whole and cooking for 4 hours and it was even better!.  I have told my family and friends to switch to this recipe!!

This was a HUGE hit with the family. The corned beef was nice and juicy. The cabbage was even tasty. Waiting until the last hour to stick in the cabbage was a great idea. Not too soggy. I took some of the advice and cooked it on low for 8 hours. I did a couple different things...instead of adding the spic package I simply added a few peppercorns as suggested. I also added two cans of beer to the mix. I used regular red potatoes instead of baby reds, and I cut them into big chunks (8-12 pieces). They were not soggy at all. A fun tip - buy soda bread. The family made sandwiches using the soda bread, mustard, and then meat and cabbage. This will be my preferred way of cooking it every year.

I made this for St. Patricks day , my kids had never had corned beef before .They both ate it with no complaints and said it was good which was surprising. My husband said it was very good maybe a bit sweet.I also dumped the juice that came in packet like another viewer suggested  but used the spice packet and 1/2 water 1/2 beef broth. I didn't cook the cabbage , made cole slaw instead.

I made this for Saint Patricks Day and used beef broth in place of the beer and this turned out great! The leftover corned beef is great for Rueben sandwiches too.

i made this for the first time on st. patrick's day for my husband.  he absolutely loved it!  i made a few small changes - i used frozen baby carrots (whole) and just water (no beer).  i placed it on low for 10 hours and added the cabbage when i got home.  this was fantastic!

Made it last night for St. Patty's Day. I think the fact that it's completely gone is a good sign. I had to transfer everything to my larger Nesco because my big crock pot was too small. I'll be using this one next year, too! Thanks, LUSYRSGIRL!

EDIT:  LEFTOVER IDEA!!!!

We didn't have any meat left over, but had a lot of veggies and broth.  So the next day I put it all in a pot on the stove, added about 4 cups of water with about 1/3 a jar of beef bullion and about a tbsp of oregano.  I let that come to a boil then added the other half of the cabbage left over from the original recipe, and it was AMAZING!  I served it all over a basic salty (not sweet) cornbread.

_______________________________________

A really good basic Corned Beef and Cabbage recipe.  No frills, but very classic tasting.  I made this for a St. Patty's Day Dinner Party and between 7 people, we ate nearly 5lbs of the corned beef, so I'd say it was a pretty big hit. :)  Thx!

Delicious!  We had friends over to celebrate St Patty's and they loved it as did we.  I cooked on low for 8 hours.  Used Blue Moon beer.  I also cut the fat off of the meat before placing in the crock pot.  Definitely recommend!

Delicious!  I followed the recipe as written, using Killian's Irish Red for the beer (that was what was in the fridge).  The cabbage was by far the tastiest I've ever had, and I'm usually not a huge cabbage fan.  Definitely a good holiday staple!

This recipe is EXCELLENT!  The only substitution I made was with the potatoes.  I used new potatoes instead of red ones.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly, and the result was scrumptious.  This is a great way to celebrate St. Pat's Day.

Made this today for St. Patrick's Day, and it was FABULOUS!  I cooked everything but the cabbage on low for 10 hours due to work, then added the cabbage the last hour.  Everything was cooked properly without being mushy, and the beer added a nice flavor!  Wonderful recipe!

I've been doing this for years with a litter variation...  Cabbage on the bottom, then the beef, veggies on top. 1 cup of water. No spices. High for 8 hours. With the veggies on top they don't get mushy, and the cabbage on the bottom almost has a sauerkraut quality. The best cabbage!

I have always done the same as Debi..sometimes over nite if my day requires earlier serving,  yes add the pepper corns,  some garlic too doesnt hurt. Never have tried the beer but would think it would be good.   I add the veggies mid way or even after in a seperate pot and allow the meat to sit.

Wonderful! I did wait to add my veggies during the last hour so they wouldn't be mushy.  I also added about 1/2 cup brown sugar to cooking liquid, and also used beef broth in place of the water.

I made this recipe as-is, leaving out the cabbage because I don’t like it but subbing carrots instead, and sided with team “cook on low” because I was afraid of ending up with tough, boiled meat.  Well the potatoes were fine, the onions stewed and the carrots weren’t quite mushy but well on their way.  And all the vegetables had the faintly metallic pickling spice taste.  The meat, while tender and sliced well, still had the fat cap on  and had the boiled meat consistency I don’t enjoy.  We’ve had a great run with corned beef this year, and as soon as our oven is fixed I’ll be going back to the Dutch oven method which I thought was far superior.  I may be able to salvage the leftovers (there were plenty) in a corned beef hash with fresh potatoes and the current potato blend as mashed potatoes for another meal. st in a long line of recipe fails to come out of it.

The reviews for this recipe have a lot of conflicting information, so let me try to clarify. Regarding the temperature setting, it really helps to know your slow cooker. Some are hotter than others. Based on experience, 8 hours on low was perfect for my model. If you've used your slow cooker a lot, go with your instincts.  Similarly, based on what I learned making beef stew, I added the carrots and potatoes at the four-hour mark. (I used a small bag of baby red potatoes, which didn't need to be peeled or quartered, and 1 pound of baby carrots.) For liquid, I used a whole 12-ounce lager, but others have had success with lite beers, stout, or beef stock. The recipe is forgiving, so go with whatever liquid you like. If you want to skip the beer and use something non-alcoholic, the meal won't suffer a bit. Before buying the meat, if you've never made corned beef before, Google "flat cut vs. point cut" to decide which you'd prefer.  Buy a bigger one than you think you'll need, because it shrinks a lot while cooking. While you're at the market, see if the bakery section has Irish soda bread, because that goes great with this meal. When carving, ALWAYS cut across the grain -- that's the difference between melt-in-your-mouth tender and agonizingly chewy.  Oh yeah, as for the cabbage, I steamed it separately just before serving, because the crockpot was almost full. No big deal, because cabbage isn't the star of this show anyway.

Very easy to make and really good. I've seen some people say to use just plain 4 cups of water, and some people do 4 cups of beef broth, so I split it and did a weak broth.

Try as I might, I can't like this version of corned beef. In my humble opinion, after trying 2 different recipies, the crock pot just fails. Much better on the stove.

Worked for me!  I reluctantly cooked it on high for 8 hours like the recipe said and it turned out great.  I used a fattier tip cut rather than a flat cut.  Only changes I made were to cut the carrots in big chunks and I didn't add beer.   This was my first time making corned beef & cabbage and I didn't realize how much the meat would shrink, so next time I will add twice the amount of meat.  Tastes great though!

I made this as instructed except did not add the beer.  My corned beef was about 3 lbs and I cooked it on low for 4 hours then high for 2 hours.  I did forget to add the cabbage at the end so I just steamed it in the microwave.  It was one of the best I've made.

super easy!  I did not use beer but might like to try it next time.  I used the seasoning packet that came with the meat, and then added some extra black pepper.  I just filled it with water 3/4 of the way up.  Used golden potatoes , onions and carrots (next time I will try red potatoes).  I put them in at the beginning and they were super soft but not mushy. (I had the potatoes cut into big pieces, so that may have helped).  Put the cabbage in during the last 1/2 hour.  I cooked it on high for the first 3 hours and low the rest of the time.  Kicked it up to high when I put the cabbage in.  This was so easy, why do I only make it once a year?  :)  Will definitely make it again!

I grew up eating this a lot so I was really excited to try making it on my own for once. My husband is sort of picky with eating, but trusts me completely when it comes to food. He likes this a lot. He thought the potatoes and carrots turned out amazing. And I was surprised when he even ate the cabbage!! This was almost a week of meals for us, and I was happy that he kept going back for more. I know in the reviews there were a lot of different suggestions for liquids.. but what I did was lay the veggies and meat, fill partway with water, added a can of beef broth, and half a bottle of dogfish head pumpkin ale. I was a little wary of the pumpkin beer but it was ridiculously delicious. While I did use the spice packet that came with the corned beef, I also threw in minced garlic and parsley. Definitely going to be making this again!

I have always done corned beef on the stove and never the crock pot.  After this recipe, the crock pot is the way to go.  it was tender and the flavors were delicious.  will be making this again very soon.

I’ve followed this recipe for a couple of years now. It’s the only way I make corned beef. But to speed up the process, in the end, I remove the corned beef, potatoes, carrots,etc, pour the juice into a pot and boil the cabbage in it. It’s much quicker that way!! Great recipe!!

Great recipe! I've always  cooked this in a Dutch oven with basically same ingredients. But after reading several reviews, I think I'm the only person who puts a mustard/brown sugar glaze on the corned beef after it has simmered.  It goes under the broiler for a few minutes until the glaze gets bubbly. I then let it sit for several minutes until the glaze turns crusty.  My hubby puts mustard on the beef and cabbage. I've used this recipe  for 50 years from the cookbook my mother gave me as a wedding present. Remember the old red & white checkered cookbook?

I made the recipe as indicated, with a couple of changes. I stumbled across some corn beef that was 40% off at my local Target superstore, and I was so excited I forgot to buy cabbage! So no cabbage. Also, I doubled the amount of potatoes and carrots and skipped the beer. I have known for years that depending on the type of beer you get, it can really screw up the taste of the potatoes and carrots. 

Also, I did not make matchstick sized carrot pieces. I bought a bag of baby carrots because I prefer them that way instead. I layered it just as the recipe dictates, and added an extra 2 cups of water since I doubled the amount of potatoes and carrots. Put the beef brisket on top of the vegetables, fat side up so the fat and flavor can seep through the corn beef. Cooked for one hour on high and then six hours on low and everything was outstanding.

The meat just falls apart is absolutely awesome.

I added more potatoes than were called for and chopped carrots (not jullienned as the recipe stated), and regret that I didn't add thicker carrots because they kind of disintegrated by the end of the cooking time. I didn't have a Guinness so I used a bottle of Smithwick's (Irish Ale). I added the cabbage about an hour before serving time. The end result was that EVERYONE loved it, and they want me to make it again next year for St. Patrick's Day. I would have given this 5 stars, but I felt the carrots could have been better. However, the piece de resistance was the meat, and that was sensational-tender and flavorful. Thanks!

Cooking time and/ or cooking level we’re not pretested.  No more than six hours, a 25% reduction.  Too much liquid.  Use 2 cups  of beef broth or water and a bottle of beer.  Don’t shred the cabbage, cut it in quarters and cook from the beginning.  
Meat was tender, easily sliced and little shrinkage.

I followed the recipe exactly, no changes, additions or alterations.  I wanted to rate this based completely on the actual recipe as provided.   The flavor is there, the tenderness of the meat is amazing.  The cabbage absorbed the flavors while still holding it's own.  My family of 5 loved every bite of this, including my 3 daughters who would never touch cabbage previous to this recipe.  I'm looking forward to making this more often especially during the winter months when a hearty dish is the perfect meal.

So easy.  I've made this a couple of times, and this last time was truly superb!  The meat sliced just like in magazine pictures!  And also tasted so good.  Yes I will make this again.  I didn't change anything, but next time I won't cut the potatoes in quarters, maybe halves.

My tweaks: I love garlic so I added about 5 cloves smashed minced garlic at the start. I made this in a 6 qt crock pot so I had enough room to add more potatoes & cabbage. I diced about 20 red potatoes and an entire smallish head of green cabbage. I used 2 onions, one head of chopped celery, added a packet of vegetable soup mix (left over from making dip). I did take out and slice the beef and add the cabbage in in the last hour or so. Then after the cabbage was reduced in volume stirred the corned beef back in. Pro tip: tastes great with Sri racha on top.

I made it twice; once with beer and water and the second time, with just water (since I didn't have any beer).  I thought it was just fine either way, although, using the beer did give the flavor and added dimension that I enjoyed.  My 11 year old daughter loved it.  I enjoyed the left over vegetables and broth as a soup to bring to work .

I made this dish for St. Patrick's Day, followed the recipe very closely and the entire family loved it!
Here is what I did differently:
- I used 5 large red potatoes, cut up into big chunks
- I added a teaspoon of powdered beef bullion to the water to add just a little flavor
- Once the meat was tender (yes, definitely 8 hours on HIGH for a 3 pound piece), I wrapped it in tin foil, then added the cabbage to the crock pot to get tender
- I made a roux for the vegetables.
I will definitely make this again next year, thanks for the great recipe!

I made this tonight for the first time. I read the other reviews first and tweaked it a bit. I cooked it on high for 4 hours then turned to low the other 4. I also used different potatoes and quartered them and the cabbage was a 1/2 head cut into 5 slices which fit in great. The meat really does fall apart and it was a bit hard to cut across the grain. The package that the beef came in said to cook on high for 4 hours! The flavor was definitely delicious and my company loved it (enough to take the recipe home even) but next time maybe I will try 6 hours. - Also followed what one reviewer said and tried it with Creamy Horseradish Garlic Spread which was also a big hit!!!! Thank you!!!!!

Wow, this was fantastic!  I took the advice from debi and cooked it without the beer, only because I have not had luck cooking things with beer.  Just don't like that flavor. So, just plain water and the seasoning packet gave it plenty of flavor for us.  Few other things:  1) I forgot to buy an onion so I sprinkled some onion powder on the potatoes and carrots.  Worked great, we didn't miss the onions at all! 2) My corned beef had a huge chuck of fat on the top, which I know is needed but it was ridiculous so I trimmed it quite a bit.  The beef was still moist and tender,  and the veggies and broth weren't too fatty. 3) I used red potatoes and based on other reviews I was worried they would be mushy so instead of quartering them I halved them.  Worked beautifully!  The carrots were a bit mushy but since they were matchstick, I figured they were there more for color anyway.  Next time, I'll probably just use a few baby carrots.  4) My corned beef was 3lbs which I did cook on high for a full 7 hours.  The meat was extremely moist and tender!  5) After removing the meat I strained the veggies and reserved the broth.  Put some in a bowl for serving with the meal then froze the rest to be used for a soup or stew later.   That's it!  Thanks sooooo much for a delicious recipe!  This will be the only corned beef recipe I'll ever use!

Good basic recipe! I've been tweaking this recipe for quite awhile. Just a couple of changes here... 
Major revelation: Corned beef in the crock pot only needs about 1/3 to 1/2 cup of liquid (be sure to have a tight lid). I just used water. It makes a lot of liquid on it's own and tends to hang together better than if it's swimming in liquid.
I added carrots and onion as per, but put the potatoes in 2 hours before done and cabbage in 1 hour before done. My slow cooker must be hot because 6-61/2 hours on low was plenty (I like to be able to slice it).
Other hints: Rinse that sucker a lot before putting in the CP or it's to salty.I removed some of the fat.  I also added a splash of orange juice on the top with spices and rub a bit (something I saw a friend do years ago). Marmalade can work too. You can't really taste the orange but it does something really good flavor wise with the corned beef spices.

HINT:  That package of seasonings.... put the seasonings into a tea diffuser and drop that into your pot with the meat. It still gives you all of the flavor without needing to pick out the peppercorns, etc. before serving!

I really don't understand why everyone has to change a recipe, if you have such a great recipe write your own. I made this exactly how the recipe called for it to be made and it was perfect! It was the most tender delicious corn beef and cabbage ever! I made it last year and I'm making it again tomorrow

This was my first attempt at making it. It was delicious. I think I will not add the potatoes & carrots so early next time, they were complete mush! It was delicious though!!!

NOTE: I am reviewing the original recipe and not a modified version. I have made this recipe several times (Hubby keeps asking for this), and it is delicious every time.  I'm not sure if the recipe is supposed to cook for 8 hrs on HIGH or if that's a mistake, but I was just too afraid to cook it on high for that long so I've always cooked it on low. Other folks here who cooked on high didn't seem to have a problem with it, so I'm guessing it is okay. You can use beef broth instead of water, and they both work fine.

I will make this again and use it for my go to corned beef recipe. Delicious ...cooked in crock pot a little under 8 hours on low.  Veggies were absolutely perfect. Smelled so good when I got home from work. Served with horseradish, butter and salt and pepper. Include salad and crusty bread, Delish!!

I LOVE Corned Beef and Cabbage! I use chicken broth instead of beer, though. And when it's done, I scoop out the potatoes and 'smash' them with a little butter. Also... Scoop out the carrots & toss with small amount of brown sugar & butter. These small adjustments add variety of flavor to make them pop. Yummers!

Yay!!  This was my second attempt at corned beef and cabbage after a failed first attempt a few years ago (stovetop recipe).  It was perfect and absolutely delicious!  I used a bottle of Bud Black Crown that we had because nobody here is drinking that.  I like that it wasn't a strong beer, because I think too strong of a beer could overpower the potatoes.  I put all the veggies in the bottom (I had white potatoes on hand, so I just quartered them instead of using red) with the meat on top.  I used mostly beef broth with one cup of the liquid being water.  I added three crushed garlic cloves and two bay leaves.  I had a long day at work, so I knew it'd be cooking a very long time.  As a result, I put it on low for 8 hours and then increased it to high for 3 hours when I got home at 3:30.  I only added the cabbage about 35 minutes before serving, since I don't like it too soft.  Everything was perfect.  Maybe the carrots could have been a tad firmer, but they were still good.  The meat was falling apart when I took it out of the pot, but I was still able to slice it against the grain, the best of both worlds - slices that fell apart.  My family devoured the whole thing.  I can't wait to make it again!!!  Thank you!!!

Perfect! Throw in beef bouillon cubes for extra flavor. Cook on low for meat you can slice, cook on high for meat that will fall apart. Add cabbage and onion in the last hour.

This is my first time making corned beef and the meat was so tender and the recipe was super easy. As others recommended, I cooked on low and it was perfect. I added the carrots and potatoes at the beginning and the cabbage in the last hour. The veggies were not mushy at all. I did add the seasoning packet and nothing else and it's fine. For those who like a little more salt (we rarely use salt) you may want to add a bit but not much. This is a keeper!!!

I loved the ease of this meal. I added chopped garlic to the top of the corned beef and cut celery with the veggies on the bottom, and because I didn't have time to come home and add the cabbage later, I laid quartered cabbage pieces on top of the beef and cooked 8 hrs on low. Absolutely the best tasting,  easiest meal to come home to.

This is an awesome, easy dish to make. BUT....I've NEVER seen cabbage that will get done in ONE hour. I put the carrots in first then the potatoes but cook the cabbage still a good 3 hrs. It comes out just perfect.

Made this for this year's St. Paddie's day parade party. Came very well. Per many of the comments, I used beef broth instead of water, cooked on LOW instead of high (and based on how it came, I highly recommend following that suggestion), used regular Guinness Draught for the beer (and I also used the whole beer since it was 5 AM when I was putting this in), and threw the cabbage in somewhere between 30-45 minutes before completion (although it did sit on the "Warm" setting for awhile before serving). Definitely more flavorful than corned beef traditionally is.

So easy, and my husband made a special point of coming back to me to tell me how much he liked it!  I didn't have beer, so substituted chicken broth and a splash of vinegar for the water and beer.  Also didn't add cabbage as we don't like it.  Compensated for no cabbage by adding extra potatoes and carrots....And he ate all of them.  I'll be buying another corned beef and make this again, while the beef is on sale.

Delicious! However, the one thing I always do (however I am preparing corned beef and cabbage) is saute the cabbage in butter in a separate pan until it is soft and ready to add to the rest of the mixture. It stays greener and fresher-tasting and contrasts nicely with the blended flavors of the meat and other veg. Also, we prefer a corned eye roast rather than a brisket, but both are good.

Good fool proof way to cook your corned beef.  My only other ingredients, which I also add when doing a beef stew, beef veggie soup or chili, is a half cup of red wine, and a half cup of black coffee...it's the secret sauce!

I liked it but I think I like cooking it on the stove more.  I wasn't a huge fan of having to include the beer and the cut of the carrots.  Also my crock pot wasn't large enough for the cabbage so I had to cook that separate anyway.

Wow! I was a little nervous to put the cooker on high for the whole 8 hours but I decided to give it a try, as I normally put it on low.  The meat was SO tender and much better than my previous attempts.  The only change I would make is to put the vegetables and potatoes in a few hours into the cooking because by the end everything was pretty mushy (but still delicious)!

Like the recipe and used it several times with a three or less lbs.  corned beef.  I've found that starting the beef and onions along with 3 cups of beef broth in a slow cooker on High for six hours the beef comes out perfectly.  

I added the carrots and the small red skin potatoes at hour five mark and the the cabbage wedges after the beef has been rested under a tent of tin foil for an half an hour before serving.

All the needed is to slice the beef across the grain and add Coleman's Dry Mustard mixed with equal amounts of beer to add to the taste of the corned beef.

Turned out better than expected!  I loved the fact that it was easy to cut the veggies up, throw it in the crackpot, go to bed, and wake up Sunday morning with dinner prepared.  
I changed some things:
*I cooked it for nine hours on low instead of high.  The meat came out perfect!  It wasn't overcooked or too tough.
*I left out the beer.  I am not a beer drinker and didn't want to buy a beer for this recipe.  While I try my best NOT to leave ingredients out of a recipe, I am glad that I did this time. 
*I added seasoning salt, garlic powder, and pepper.

I made this, but since my beef was only a little over 2#, I added some turnip and parsnips! It was delicious even though I overcooked it a bit.  I shared it and still had 3 meals for my husband and myself!

I loved my mom's corned beef and cabbage, so I thought I'd give this a try for St. Patrick's Day. I was very pleased with my first time! We are not beer drinkers, so I omitted the beer entirely and substituted beef broth for the water. I first cooked the corned beef in the beef broth and seasonings for 4 hours on LOW, then added the vegetables for the remaining 4 hours. The vegetables turned out wonderfully, especially the potatoes. Yum! Next time I will get a more expensive cut of corned beef.

Delicious. The corned beef was too salty, so maybe rinse it first before throwing in. There was a lot of liquid at the end, so maybe cut down on the water/stock

We tried it for St. Patrick's Day.  It was very easy to prepare, I used a whole can of beer instead of 6 oz.  It was a great success, everyone loved it.  The worst part was there were no leftovers!

Delicious. I didn't think that setting the slow cooker on high for 9 hours would work, but it worked like a charm. The corned beef was so tender. I did add a couple bottles of Guinness along with water. I also waited to add cabbage last 1-1/2 hours. Outstanding.

Made this for St Pattys Day, and my 17 year old son commented during dinner that he decided this is his favorite meal! (I followed the recipe almost exactly; I made it a little easier by using baby carrots (about 20) and a bag of shredded cabbage, and I used about 6 red potatoes, and cut them into bite-size pieces.)

I have never rated any recipes before ever, but this recipe is absolutely delicious! It is very easy. Only substitute I did was to cook on low since my crock pot cooks hot anyways and I also did not use the beer. I highly recommend this recipe. Thanks for sharing lusyrsgirl

I loved it! The changes I made were adding McCormick Pickling Spice after 4 hours cooking. The original spice pack was added just like the recipe states. The type of beer I used was a Sam Smiths Brown Ale 3 of them. A good tip is to slice the brisket on top and bottom plus put puncture holes in it that way you know all the flavors get in plus tenderizing from the beer.

Delicious! Followed the recipe minus the beer and turned out excellent! Will definitely make again!! Next time I will only use 3 cups of water as it seemed to fill to the brim of my crockpot. I had to drain some water out to stir half way through but then added part of it back in. Had to do the same thing with the water when it was time to add the cabbage. Maybe I just need a bigger crockpot :)  Added a pinch of sugar when the cabbage went in.  We didn't have any leftovers!

Tasty and easy. I added my carrots and potatoes after 5 hrs (so they cooked 3 hrs and didn't get too mushy) and added 12 oz beer and 12 oz water.

This was absolutely delicious! I used a Great Lakes IPA. I also cooked it on low for 8 hours. My Irish husband said it was the best cornbeef and cabbage he has ever had. I am just wondering if there is a way to make it less salty.

Not a huge fan of corned beef, but this is the best recipe I've found. Spent 30 minutes deciding on beer after the hoppy ale we used last time made the carrots inedible. Went with Belhaven Scottish Ale after reading it would bring out sweetness in carrots, which worked much better.  4 stars because I think it could be better. For me, next time I'll go smaller on the meat and up the potatoes to even out the strong salty flavor.  Also my meat was pre-seasoned, and I might like a different brand better.

2 cups water 2 cups beef stock 9hrs on low with a couple crushed cloves of garlic. Added some black pepper, rosemary, and thyme when cooking the cabbage. I used Sam Adams for the beer and added the potatoes and carrots at 3 hrs. The best Irish dinner we have had!!!

Came out perfect - There is enough liquid to add more veggies (extra carrots, onions, cabbage). (I didnt use potatoes because we are carb free)- Wouldnt change a thing. Used Al-Clad slow cooker on low for 8 hours.

Super tender and moist. Very easy to prepare. We omitted the beer based on another reviewer's suggestion.

Very tender and moist.  Third helpings for everyone.  Try to get the biggest brisket you can and trim the fat.  It shrinks up quite a bit.

The corned beef came out so moist. Will definitely slow cook the corned beef again. I used the leftovers to make Rueben Sandwiches.

This is a great recipe. I didn't have any beer so used 2 cans of beef broth and 1 cup of water instead of beer and the 4 cups water. I cooked it on low for 8 hours and then turned it on high for 1 hour when I put the cabbage in. Put the potatoes in about halfway through cooking it. It turned out perfect. Will definitely make again!

Excellent! Hubby raved about how good it was! Put all the ingredients in the morning come back at night to a lovely meal. The only changes to the recipe was I used  Sam Adams Winter Ale, put the cabbage  in with the other vegetables , used baby carrots and put the temp on low for 10 hours.   Corn beef  was tender and vegetables were not mushy.    All that was needed was mustard and Irish Soda Bread !  Recipe is a keeper!

This recipe turned out a GREAT! Complete success my first Corned Beef.
Very easy, tender and not at all dry! I was a little concerned about cooking it on High for 8 hours..I'm accustomed to using only a low setting in my crock cooking, but decided to not deviate and just go with it, Glad I did!

Made this recipe today for my elderly parents and we all absolutely loved it.  My slow cooker was on High and I only cooked  2.75 pound corned beef.  It only took about 3 - 4 hours and was perfectly moist and really easy to cut.  The flavor of the stout was great.  Next time, I will add more carrots and  cut them bigger.

This is a really good simple recipe. The only thing I did differently is I skipped the beer. The most important thing about serving corned beef is to make sure you slice it properly (across the grain). Cut it thin if you to want to make sandwiches.

This was my first time making corned beef and it turned out great.  I followed another users instructions and cooked it on high for an hour, turned it down to low for 3 hours, turned it back on high for 1 hour, then back to low for the remaining 3 hours.  It came out perfect and so tender.  Being from the Pacific Northwest, I like my veggies stew like (soft, but not mushy), so I cut my carrots up into huge 1/2 inch chunks and put them in right in the beginning.  They came out perfect.  I omitted the potatoes because I made colcannon (Diane's Colcannon) to go with this instead.  I also substituted pear onions for the sliced onion in the recipe.  Those should go in about half way through if you want to keep them closer to whole.  I served it with Creamy Horseradish Garlic Spread from this site.

Used this at St. Party's Day and cooked it using the reviews.  Added coriander, mustard seeds, garlic as others suggested.  Did half-n-half on the heat:  3 hours on high, 3 on low, and 2 more on high.  Added veggies at 3rd hour and cabbage in last 45 minutes. Delish.

Omg; yummy!!! I was nervous about cooking it on high, but it was perfect! :) added sliced celery with leaves, more pepper and some garlic powder. I used natural light beer because that's what i had :) One hour was just right for the cabbage; I don't like it too mushy. Thanks for the fantastic recipe! Its a keeper.

I put the potatoes on the bottom, along with celery carrots two cloves of garlic and the corned beef on top. I then use beef stock to cover the beef. Put on low for 8 hours, comes out great!

I fill the crockpot with two briskets (we love leftovers and corned beef hash). Cooking the vegies with the corned beef leaves them too soft and they adsorb too much, so I bake the vegies separately and towards the end spread some of the crockpot juice over the top. Cabbage is boiled, then quick fried with butter for some of the family.

Awesome! I lost my recipe, and this almost exact! I, however, add a few stalks celery (including the leaves chopped finely), triple the carrots, 2 cloves garlic, 1 whole head of cabbage -quartered, and I save the beer to drink LOL. It's SO good! (The meal & the beer!:)

PS...I still can't remember if you're supposed to add the 'juice' from the raw CB packge - that's one of the main reasons I searched the recipe...I added a little.

Also, I/we like the cabbage more well done so I cook on high for an hour, then add the cabbage on top for the duration. If it looks done, I just take it out & put in bowl.

I usually cook all my meats in the slow cooker on high for 5-6 hours. I tried to cook the corned beef on low as suggested by many and it came out tough and stringy as another reviewer stated. Carrots were undercooked. I had company and this was embarrasing to say the least. Not making this again but glad some had success in this recipe.

I cooked the brisket by itself for 1/2 the time, then add potatoes, then carrots, and then onions.  Added the cabbage 1 hr before eating, so vegetables weren't overcooked.

Truth be told, I guess I'm just not fond of traditional corned beef and cabbage because I did not care for this at all. :( While I enjoy deli-style corned beef sandwiches, but apparently don't care for it any other way. Ditto for the cabbage. It's fine in just about anything else but ended up being what I liked LEAST about this dish. For all you corned beef lovers out there, this is a great find. It just isn't for me. Thanks anyways, Lusyrsgirl! :-)

I'm not a fan of corned beef or cabbage, but hubs is, so I made him some at his request.  I tried it and thought it was okay, but again, I'm not a fan.  He really enjoyed this.  I changed a few things because of my time frame; I put it on low all day (probably about 12-15 hours)and used half chicken broth, half water, and an entire bottle of beer.  Thanks for the idea from a reviewer about putting the spice packet in a tea ball; if hubs hadn't gotten a hold of it and opened it, it would've worked perfectly!  Now that he is educated as to what it is, perhaps I'll get him to leave it alone next time!  He enjoyed, although it made a ton of food, but he's happily eating the leftovers.  His only comment was that perhaps we should use less corned beef next time with the same amount of cabbage.  Thanks for the recipe.

I had never made corned beef and cabbage before but decided to try my hand at it. I followed the recipe exactly except cooked the cabbage on the stove for 20 minutes in some of the liquid from the crock pot, as someone else suggested. Absolutely fabulous!

The corned beef turned out as expected.  However, I steamed the vegetables separately except for adding onion to the beef.  I added a large bay leaf and about a teaspoon of ground allspice as I didn't have pickling spice to add.  The amount of spice with the beef didn't appear to be enough.

This was a perfect St. Patty's Day meal.  I did make a couple of changes.  I cut the water down to 2 cups and added the whole can of beer.  I cut the potatoes down to 6 (mine were probably just bigger red potatoes).  I cooked it 9 hours on low and then took out the meat and veggies and covered them with foil.  Then I added a whole head of cabbage (coarsely chopped) into the liquid and cooked it on high until tender.

This brisket was divine finished up in the oven with a brown sugar, vinegar, mustard glaze.

I used a whole bottle of Guinness Black Lager, a can of beef broth and about a cup of water.  I used the pickling pack that came with the brisket but I also added a bay leaf, a two-inch piece of cinnamon and two cloves.  All of that was folded into a paper coffee filter and sealed with a metal twist tie.

My crock-pot is small so the brisket had to be cut in half to fit in with the onion.  I cooked on high for 3 hours and then added the potatoes and carrots.  Those all cooked for two hours on high.  I didn't have enough room for the small quartered cabbage so I fished out the brisket and put the cabbage in the crock-pot. 

The brisket was placed in a roasting pan with two cups of the crock-pot broth and sealed tightly with foil.  It was braised for 1 hour at 300degrees.  I then removed the brisket from the oven and brushed on the glaze. Oven temperature was increased to 350 and the brisket was baked, uncovered, for an additional 15 minutes.  

The glaze was simply 1/2 c brown sugar, 1/4 c apple cider vinegar, 1/4 c prepared mustard, 1/2 tsps each of onion powder and garlic powder and 1/4 tsp cinnamon.  Bring ingredients to a boil in small saucepan, lower heat and simmer for 10 minutes to thicken.

Since my brisket (4.5# total wt) was cut in half to start out with, 5 hours on high and one hour in the oven were perfect. Carrots and potatoes perfect at 2 hours, cabbage for 1 hour.

I live in Ontario Canada and I have never seen a corned beef brisket!  We can buy corned beef in the deli.  I would love to make a brisket with the spice packet, does anyone know what is in the 'spice packet'?  Thanks!

Made this tonight and it was delicious.  We absolutely loved it.  Only thing I did differently was to roast tiny potatoes in the oven instead of putting them in the crock pot.  We used a bottle of Dos XX beer and the 4 cups of water.  Cooked it on high setting as directed.  Served with Grey Poupon Dijon mustard.  Perfect.  This one will become a regular.  So easy and so tasty!

Great ideas!  I love to use apple juice in place of water, approximately 2 cups.   I'd like to try the Guinness but I'd rather drink it.  Might give it a shot.  It might sound silly but I like to add the cabbage with the corned beef.  I place it on top of the meat and cook for 6 hrs on low.  My family likes it a little soggy.

First time I have used Crock for c/b & cabbage dinner.  I liked the beer taste and will use again. I used Yukon Gold potatoes and they were getting mushy after 5 hrs on high. I cut my own carrots in slices(thick) they needed to be scooped out with potatoes to remain flavorful and al dente.   Meat seemed tough after 6 hrs on high. not sure what I did wrong.  maybe cook meat longer on high?   potatoes & carrots were very tasty!  will try again

We were dieting, so I omitted the potatoes and carrots. Only used a 12 oz can of lite beer. It was tender and delicious! Next time I will use a bigger crockpot to add the potatoes, carrots and water and half the beer. Maybe.

This was really, really good. I cooked on high for 8 hours & the meat was very tender & my veggies were fine. Next time I will add more pickling spice (personal preference), and take the meat out after about 7 hrs and let it rest and add the cabbage for the last hour (as another reviewer suggested). But all in all, very good recipe. Thanks

I used this recipe but followed the advice of others to cook it on low in the Slow Cooker instead of high.  It turned out great!  It was a nice meal for St. Patrick's Day.

I wish you could rate 1/2 a star because this would have been a 4 1/2 star for me.  This was super good (and easy) made just as the recipe states except the ONLY thing I did different was (as others said and because my crock pot seems to cook high) to cook it on low for 8 hours instead of high.  

Made this for the first time for St. Patrick's Day and a houseful of company...actually had two crock pots going...  had some veggies left, but that was it!  This will be my go-to Corn Beef and Cabbage recipe from now on.

This was a big hit at our house. The corned beef came out moist, the potatoes and carrots were just the right tenderness and cabbage wasn't soggy.  Next time I am going to have to make a larger piece of corned beef because my son and picky eating daughter were looking for more.

I'm still trying to find a "boiled" dinner recipe that we all love. As boiled dinners go, this one is pretty good and so easy. I do like cooking the corned beef in beer. I halved the recipe & cooked on the stove in dutch oven pan for over 3 hrs. I added potatoes and carrots the last 45 minutes and omitted the cabbage.

This was my first time cooking corned beef.  This recipe was just okay.  It was pretty bland for my taste.  Definitely needed more seasoning.  I didn't use the beer or water.  Instead I used a couple cans of beef broth.  If I cook again, will definitely use more seasoning.

This was a great meal! I didn't use beer, we're not really drinkers and I don't like the seasoning packet. I just threw in 4 beef bullion cubes, onion, carrots, potatoes & the meat. I came home from work and it was all perfectly cooked and the meat was moist. I ended up throwing the cabbage in the microwave with some of the juices because I couldn't wait the hour for it to cook! I will definitely make this again.

I followed Debi's directions and just used water. Plus I omitted the carrots due to room in the crockpot. Yummy! Turned out great!

Excellant!!!!!!!!! My son came home from the Naval Academy foaming at the mouth for Corned Beef and Cabbage. I tried this recipe since my pressure cooker died.  I added half the water and a whole bottle of beer. It was fabulous! This is definitely a keeper.

Not a lot of flavor. Along with my spice packet, I used the entire 16 oz bottle of Guinness stout thinking that would be plenty of flavor - not so.  The corned beef and veggies all tasted fairly blah.   For veggies, I used 2 onions, 6 or 7 new potatoes, a carrot (only one I had), 3 parsnips and a whole cabbage.  Next time I'll use beef broth (instead of water) along with the beer and I'll add lots of other spices, particularly salt, bay leaves and perhaps garlic, too.  I made hash with some of it tonight, adding plenty of spices and butter, and that was good so none will go to waste.

Perfect and simple.  I used as written, but used regular-sized red potatoes, cut into small chunks, and baby carrots whole.  So easy, and the meat was the perfect texture!

Mine was ready and perfect on High in 6 hours.  I also used beef broth instead of water. The last half hour of cooking, I added the cabbage in chunks.  With 15 minutes remaining, I took out the potatoes/onions and meat and let them rest in a 9x13 with Saran Wrap over the top.  I left out the carrots simply because I don't care for them.  I will be doing this again!!

A smash sensation! I had a smaller corned beef, and I turned my crock pot on to high and cooked the corn beef for six hours. I added the beer, a stout hoppy lagar, carrots, new potatoes, half of a onion, and 1 extra bay leaf, and a little rosemary and thyme. I also added some garlic salt.(Just a touch). This recipe is great! A real dandy to have on hand for St Patricks Day!

This was not good - or perhaps just not to my liking.  The meat is tough and the veggies are bland.  I will continue to use my trusty dutch oven for future corned beef.

This was delicious and easy.  I only gave it 4 stars because I used beef broth instead of water, added a FULL Guinness, and cooked on LOW 5 hours, added veggies & potatoes for 3 more hours, and cabbage for 20 minutes at the end.  TONS of flavor.

This dish was good. I did not add the beer. I used 1 cup water and 1 cup beef broth. Unlike other reviews, I did not have tough meat. I drizzled olive oil on the top of the meat, and halfway through the cooking time I flipped the meat over so it was fat side up, and the flesh was sitting in the liquid.

Very simple and tasty. I made as stated except I omited the beer. And I cooked on low for about 10 hours total (to accommodate my schedule). The meat was excellent and veggies were very good. The red potatoes I used were fairly large, but I still only quartered them. And I used baby carrots (uncut). The vegtables weren't too mushy at all.

Made this for dinner tonight. I had always added just the carrots w/ the corned beef and never the potatoes that early in the day.  I did it as written, and it was wonderful!!  The only beer we had in the house was Coors Light, but it worked fine. I didn't want a strong or bitter taste.  I did the cabbage in a separate pot on the stove as there was no room in the slow cooker to add the cabbage the last hour as is written.  It was a wonderful dinner.  Thx for the recipe as I never would have tried to add the  potatoes that early!!

I made this as written, minus the beer which I didn't have on hand.  Since other reviewers said it wasn't needed, I left it out.  It ended up having good flavor, but was extremely tough.  It was actually hard to chew.

This came out so-so.  I followed this recipe EXACTLY and the meat came out a little tough.  I actually left it in an extra two hours because it was so tough after 8 hours.  I'm very bummed that this didn't quite work out.  Hubby insists that it is yummy and I do admit the flavor is good, but I don't think I would do this again.  :(

Made this for St. Patrick's day.  Very good.  I'm not sure if the beer did anything for the flavor.  Made it again today, (03/20/2011) and it is still very good and easy.

Made this for the first time on St.Patricks Day.  It turned out amazing!  I was told by freinds that it is the best corned beef they have ever had!  It just makes your mouth water!  I will definatly make this again, many times!

It was excellent and simple.  I used half a Harps beer and half a Guiness beer and told everyone it was "Black and Tan" corned beef... although it still looked red, which is a good thing.

Made this for St. Pat's this year and had to work all day while it cooked. Got home to a house full of more people than I thought were eating and we barely had enough to dish out. Needless to say, everyone LOVED it and are still telling me how good it was! Will definitely make it again!

Loved it!  Was a little hesitant to cook it on high for 8 hours, but with the amount of water in the recipe it was fine.  Within an hour or two it comes to a nice slow simmer and cooks like that all day.  I am the only one in my house who likes corned beef and cabbage, so I cooked it on Sunday, had a big serving for dinner (everyone else was on their own) and took the leftovers to work on Monday.  It got wiped out!  Will definitely make again, even if I am the only one eating it.  Thanks!

I left out the beer. My crock pot was overflowing with a 4 lb flat cut brisket. I followed the directions to the "T". Everything else came out perfectly. The meat was tender. The vegetables firm. The cabbage was full of flavor. I saved the liquid. Froze it in a rubbermaid container. Next time the store had a sale on the briskets I pulled out the container and started fresh again and made up the difference with fresh liquid. This new one was perfect also. We ate off the second one -this time I used two handfuls of Ca. baby carrots. Even better. Sweeter tasting. I used Vadalia onion this time. The second one was even better. I think it was all the better quality vegetables in the mix. My cabbage was so good we were using the slottled spoon getting all the veggies out of the bottom this time. And yes... I saved the liquid one for the next time.

This was good but I have to say that I don't like the beer flavor in there because the veggies soaked up too much of that flavor and gave it a bit of a funny taste. Next time I would use a similar recipe that doesn't call for beer (or maybe as much beer).

I attempt to make a corned beef dinner every St. Pat's day and this is by far the best recipe I have ever used. My whole family commented on how good it was. This will be the "keeper" recipe for corned beef and cabbage.

I made this for St. Patricks Day and it was great.  The corned beef was extremely soft and cut like butter.  I did keep the slow cooker going for about 2 hours more than the 9 hours that it calls for in the recipe.

Leave the knives in the silverware drawer, you won't need them!  Absolutely delicious.  Used 2 bags of frozen stew vegetables to save time.  With a loaf of Irish soda bread, it made the perfect St. Patrick's Day meal.

This was a great recipe.  My husband loved it so much that he keeps asking me to make him corned beef sandwiches.  It was quick and easy especially for someone who has never made it before.  I got a tip from one of my friends so I put the cabbage in 15 mins before the end of cooking and it came out cooked but crisp.  It was delicious.

This was an easy and tasty version of corned beef and cabbage - which my family loved.  To add extra flavor I used 2 cups water + 2 cups beef stock - instead of 4 cups water.  I'd also prefer a little extra spice in addition to the spice packet that came with the beef - I'll add more of my own next time.

The meat was very tender, the vegetables cooked - but not mushy. Very flavorful. I think that next time I would add less liquid. Maybe start with 3 cups of water and the beer.

This turned out really good. Never made it to the cabbage, it smelled to good to wait. I thougt that on high the veggies would be gone but it turned out nice. Put it on at 7 am and got home at 6 pm. Will make this again.

This was perfect.  I have never made Corned Beef & Cabbage before and followed the recipe to the T.  Adding more water to cover the meat 80%.  My crock pot was very full.   I cooked on low for 9.5 hours and it was perfect.  The veggies were a lil soft but I cooked longer than 8.  Seasoning was perfect and even my 8 & 10 yr old sons ate it!  My parents loved it too.  This is a keeper especially if your a crock pot fan!

I added the potatoes and carrots after 3-4 hours so they wouldn't get so mushy, I used baby carrots. I added the cabbage a little too early--so it was a bit too mushy. I rinsed the meat after removing it from the package, before I put it in the crock pot. It was falling apart, but could still be sliced. I loved it, and my daughter who had never had corned beef loved it. My picky son and DH wouldn't try it.  But if you're feeding more people, remember that it shrinks up a LOT, so buy the largest one that will fit your crock pot.

Unbelievably good.  I put a full can of Guinness in it and would venture to say replace all liquid with beer.  Insanely delicious.

Excellent!  It was the best corned beef and cabbage.  I didn't add any water though - as recommended previously - but used one can of beer.  Perfect!

Followed recipe exactly except cooked on Low the whole time.  SO bland and WAY too much liquid.  Fell apart like pot roast - no slices.  Major waste of food.

I'll tell you a secret about cooking corned beef in the crockpot: you don't need any liquid at all. No beer, water, broth, etc. The meat will fill the pot with liquid and a few times i had to ladle out liquid into a pan, in which i like to simmer my cabbage. I also have frozen this broth for use in cooking cabbage as a side dish. I have the largest Rival crock pot, and this just fills up with meat juices. I put the spices from the spice packet into a tea ball, and lay it in beside the meat. This is one of the best dinners to do in the crock.

I agree that the temps should be on low for 8 hours, adding garlic and pepper but also like to add parsnips and turnips with the other vegies.  Once I added caraway seeds to give it a different flavor..some of the family liked it, some not.

Have been slow cooking my corned beef for years and much prefer it that way. The meat is amazingly tender and flavorful and there's no checking on it and refilling water as when done on the stove. I normally do larger amounts of beef, about 7 pounds total, as I prepare it for a large family dinner. I do not add beer but add extra pickling spices, a quartered onion, carrots, and a bay leaf. I do cover with warm water and start it on high for an hour before turning down to low. As I have so much meat in my crock pot, there isn't room for potatoes and cabbage. I cook those on the stove  in a separate pot but I take as much "flavored" cooking water from the crock pot as possible to add to the chicken broth and water used to cook the vegetables. That gives the veggies the same "cooked with corned beef" flavor even though they were cooked separately. Serve with stewed tomatoes and cornbread and that's what my husband wants for his annual birthday dinner.

I made it and didn’t  like the taste. It was hard and bland after 9 hrs on high. After I got home I had to season it a bit and put it for 35 min in the pressure cooker. Then it was tender and it had flavor.

I have made this recipe 6 times now. I use this one each time because every person raves about it.....even my picky ones eat it. I cook it on high for the 8 hours and it turns out not mushy and the meat just falls apart tender. I would not change a thing to this recipe. My daughter begs me to make it at least once a month and it never fails. You will not be disappointed!

Very nice and easy.  I did add 1 tablespoon of beef 'Better Than Bullion', and replaced the beer with an additional cup of water.  (Out of beer!)  I cooked this on high for the entire 8 hours, and the end result was great!

I used 2 cups of apple juice  and 2 cups of water and no beer in the crockpot. Carrots, onions and celery on bottom. I Put my potatoes and cabbage on top during last hour. It does make on the sweeter side so you may want to cook potatoes separately. This is the way my mom used to make it simmering all day long on the stove.   Yummy!!!

It was very tasty and so very easy.  I had to go behind my husband and add a little more seasoning (salt) and then it really sang.   I wonder if using soy sauce instead would have had a nice flavor.  I'll try that next time.

This is my go-to recipe for corned beef! I kept my small potatoes whole (I was afraid that they'll end up being mushy).  Otherwise, I kept true to the recipe.  And you need to cook it on HIGH, just like the recipe states.

I made this ALMOST to the letter of the recipe... with these SMALL changes .... 

Doubled amount of carrots & Potatoes, layered bottom of crockpot with carrots then potatoes, SEASONED WITH PEPPER SALT & GARLIC POWDER... Layered on onions - filled 3/4 with water, I used Distilled as we have well water... put Brisket on top used season packet came with meat... used last of carrots / potatoes around top of brisket....

Cooked on HIGH FOR 4 HRS. TURNED DOWN TO LOW FOR LAST 4 HOURS  WITH 1 HOUR LEFT ADDED CABBAGE.

WAS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS - PLENTY OF LEFT OVERS..

It wasn't bad but mine came out very bland. I used Heiniken beer and some vegetable stock. I'll need to find some tips on seasoning next time.

Delicious. But, I have a 6 qt slow cooker and 3-4 lb beef brisket is not quite enough for my house. That being said, I get way too much liquid to fit both the veggies and the meat. I’ve made this twice with quantity adjustments and both times I wound up transfering everything to my 12 qt Dutch oven when it came time to add the cabbage. I even pulled the potatoes out with intention of adding them later. Still, I found myself siphoning liquid to keep from running over.  I can see that this is a great recipe for a 3- 4 lb brisket. Unless you have a gigantic slow cooker, I suggest the stovetop version. Too bad, the whole point for me was to be hassle free.

EXCELLENT.  My taste buds desire this salty goodness year-round. I was very skeptical to cook on high but it came out great (pull apart tender). I didn't have beer and I substituted water with broth. EASY

No   *  it was perfect. I had company for dinner and they rave about it. My new way of making brisket from this day forward !!   :) But I did it on low after bring it to a rolling boil
I did remove the veggies well before  so they would not over cook, then after the cabbage is added I put the veggies back in the pot. OH P.S. I used Coors light  beer .....

Very simple and delicious way to prepare corned beef and cabbage. I added the cabbage after 7 hours and cooked for a total of 8 hours and the beef and veggies are tender and flavorful. I washed the beef  before adding it to the pot to cut down on some of the saltiness.

We made this for St. Paddy's Day. I was disappointed in the results, as the vegetables turned into runny mush. The flavor was ok thanks to the spices that came included with our corned beef, but overall the dish had the consistency of chunky soup, which is not how I'm used to experiencing it.

If you're going to attempt this recipe, I'd cut the total amount of liquid down to about 1 - 1 1/2 cup. Four cups of water is far too much for a slow cooker. We didn't use the beer so if you do, factor that in to your total amount of liquid.

Low Heat! High heat at 8 hours turns the meat and vegatables to mush!  Also too much liquid. One cup of water and a 12 oz light beer.

The changes I made was a cooked in a slow cooker pressure cooker. Was short on time. I did 3 and half hours on high for the slow cooker. Then added cabbage and switch to pressure. 45 min later, cabbage was great and corn beef was easy to separate and very tender.

A great recipe, I will use this one again. I incorporated some of the review comments and it worked really well. There are lots of varying opinions on times - I went with 8 hours on high and it worked well, meat was very tender. I added my potatoes and carrots halfway through (four hour mark) and they turned out superb! Not at all soggy. I followed the one-hour-prior rule for cabbage, also great. I went with Corona for the beer and it was perfect. This recipe is a keeper for me, my family loved.

This recipe came out fantastic! I did cook on low setting for 8 hours and boiled the cabbage separately, due to their not being anymore room in my slow cooker.  My family loved it! I will make again!

Instead of using the beer, I used  6oz of  pure apple juice, no additional  sweetner. It was the best corned beef and cabbage that I have ever prepared. ?? Barbara

This was THE BEST corned beef I’ve ever made. Cooking on high instead of low must have been what did it.....usually the meat is tough and dry. Cooking it on high heat the entire cooking time made it really moist and tender.  I put half of the quartered potatoes on the bottom so the meat wasn’t directly on the bottom of the crock pot. Added the water, meat, beer then seasoning packet. Cooked on high about 8 hours, then added the rest of the veggies on top and cooked for another hour so they weren’t too mushy.  I left the carrots in bigger chunks. Entire family loved it, thank you for a simple and amazing recipe!!

Have made this several times and it always turns out perfectly delicious! I cook on High for 8 hours (so tender!) and the cabbage for 30-40 minutes. For us, the beer and carrots are optional and the absence of those doesn't affect the taste one bit.

Came out fantastic.   I used two boxes of beef broth and two bottles off beer (corona).  Followed recipe putting on high for about 5 hours and added cabbage last hour. Also made the horseradish garlic dip on the site.  Dinner was wonderful.   I will cook this way again.  Also so easy!

Wow. I followed this exactly and am soooo glad I decides to check it before leaving the house. My Kitchenaid crock pot was on low for 2+1/2 hours and the veggies were completely done! If I had left them in unchecked for the 8 hours this recipe calls for I would have had baby food (mush) carrot and potatoes.

I made two crockpots, one cooked on high, the other on low. I did put veggies in the low pot after 5 hours and they came out perfect. Also put cabbage in last hour of both pots and it was also delicious. Bottom line is both hi and low turned out great. I would suggest the later addition of veggies but if you don’t have time just do as directed in recipe. Every bite was gone to rave reviews!!!

This was absolutely perfect.  Only changes were no beer & beef broth subbed for some of the water and no carrots.  Started on high for an hour & then turned to low.  Potatoes were added 6 hrs. later & cabbage added last hour at which time I turned heat back up to high.  Used small red potatoes cut in half which were cooked to perfection.  This is a keeper!!!!!!!

This was amazing!! I'm such a fan of slow cooker recipes for EVERYTHING haha. This came out so tender and flavorful with perfectly cooked vegetables. 
It's important to add the juices that the beef is packaged in into the crock pot like the package recommends. There's a lot of flavor there in addition to the season packet it comes with.

I used a Corned Beef Brisket and soaked it overnight in cold water to remove some of the salt and it worked out fine. My brisket didn't have the spice packet, but since it was corned, I just added a couple of bay leaves and some cloves. So tender it pulled apart. Be careful, though! The brisket shrank while cooking, so cook more than you think you need.

Loved the flavor.  Didn't cut up the vegetables as fine--personal preference.  I'm making it again tomorrow.

I would not put the beer in next time it made the vegetables taste a little funny. The corned beef was super tender though.

My slow cooker was too small to squeeze the cabbage in, so I cooked it in a separate pot. Meat came out tender, veggies (I used parsnips, carrots, potatoes) were soft and delicious!

Delish!  We didn’t use all of the water listed and the corned beef was still so moist and tender.  We made it the day before and reheated beef in the slow cooker and veggies in the oven.  It was a huge hit.

I added two things: 4 garlic cloves and 1 container of Trader Joe's mirepoix (or you can chop about a cup each of onion, celery, carrots).
Two compliments--"the best corned beef I've ever had" from a guest ; the other was from my husband who, at one time,  did not like corned beef at all!

I did no changes, and added about the same ingredients as it calls for...    ONLY thing was it came out just a little too salty for my liking though.

Rated 2 stars for easiness of recipe and the flavor was just okay.  I've had better.  Just didn't turn out like I'd hoped for.  Mine was really salty too.  That could be because of the brand of corn beef that I used....maybe some saltier than others?  Anyway, glad I tried it in the crock pot, so now I know, but think I'll go back to my other method.

i  didnt have room for the beer after i added the water to my crockpot.  It was still delicious as it was!!  I had to make the cabbage  in a separate pot .  I sauted some onions in a little butter until translucent, added about  1/4 cup of the juice from the cooked  corned beef, and added  the cabbage.  It was DELICIOUS

It came out fantastic. I just cooked it a little longer than was needed it shredded instead of slicing but the flavor was wonderful. Did put the spices in a cheese cloth though so I didn't have them running wild in the pot. A keeper. Great recipe.

This recipe was WONDERFUL! I followed the recipe posted except I used two 3lb. corned beef and added veggies 3 hours prior to finish time. I used a whole cabbage cut in 6 wedge pieces, 4 lg. Idaho potato's halved and baby carrots . Very tender and juicy!

First time making Corned Beef and cabbage.  It was soooo good!!!   This recipe is a keeper!!  I cooked it for 9 hours total. First 2 hrs (only cooked meat) I cooked on high, then low for 3 hrs. At hr 5 I added the potatoes, onions, and carrots (went with bigger pieces in the carrots and cut the red potatoes in half) then I returned the slow cooker to high. I tied wedges of cabbage and put in crock an hr and a half before done.  Absolutely DELISH!!

Excellent! All of my guests said it was the best they had ever tasted. I did use beef broth instead of water along with 6 oz's  homebrew IPA. I sprinkled some 21 Seasons from Trader Joe's and a dusting of garlic powder. I cooked it on high for the first few hours, switched to low for a couple hours, and then back to high for the last 3 hours. I added the cabbage for the last 2 hours. I also used the more expensive and leaner cut from Albertson's. Delicious, tender and not dry at all.

I followed this almost exactly but took others advice and did not cook it on high for 8 hours.  I cooked on high for 1 hour then turned it down to low and another 6.5 hours, then a 30 minute rest.  It was like eating leather.  I was really disappointed and will go back to my simmer on the stove instead.  This was awful!

First time I ever made this meal in the slow cooker and we were very pleased!  We made this with sweet potatoes and a bag of frozen carrots, in addition to the corned beef and cabbage.  The spice packet that came with the corned beef was very small so we added other seasonings such as garlic powder, salt, pepper, maple syrup, and cayenne pepper.  For the liquid, we cut the water down to 2 cups and added 2 cans of beer.  Will only cook in the slow cooker from now on.  Very good.

This is the only recipe that I will use for making cornbeef.   I did leave out the beer and onions. Kept everything else  the same.  Cooked on low for 8 hours.  Thanks for the recipe.  Cheers.

I made this and I followed the directions, and I cooked it on HIGH.  The meat was tender and my vegetables were not mushy at all. The next time I would change the seasonings, like adding some garlic and onion powder  and a pinch of crushed red pepper because it was a little bland.  Overall, a easy and good recipe.

I don't remember carrots in the meal when I was a kid, but it was a nice addition with good color and still a bit of texture.

I followed the recipe exactly except omitted the beer. And low instead of high on the crockpot. It was fabulous. Even my picky kids scarfed it up.

First off, I don't particularly care for corned beef outside of 1-2 Reuben sandwiches a year. My husband likes it even less. That said, I prepared the dish with 2 changes - I used beef broth instead of water & I did not add beer. It was cooked on low for 8 hours. The corned beef did not come out as tender as many regular beef briskets I have prepared. Other than that, it was quite tasty. I added the carrots, onions & potatoes after 4 hours. I cooked the cabbage for 1/2 hour & let the corn beef rest for 20 minutes. The vegetables were very good & not mushy. I may make this again on a future St. Patrick's day celebration. The leftover corned beef will be eaten as Reuben sandwiches. Thank you for the recipe.

Excellent recipe. Used 4lb cut from Aldi with seasoning packet. Cooked on low for 5 hours then high for 2.5. Used two regular size cans of beef broth, then the remaining liquid was water, added 3 tbsp brown sugar, 2 tbsp butter, two bay leaves, 4 cloves of garlic, one onion quartered. Added 3/4 bag of baby carrots and four white potatoes cubed  and at 4 hours remaining. Removed meat at 7 hours 15 minutes, added half of cabbage chopped for 46 minutes. Perfection! Rave reviews! 3/17/19

turned out fantastic, best ever.  used Angus corned beef, one bottle of beer, russet, two small onions, chopped, baby carrots, potatoes and about 4-1/2 cups water.  added half head of chopped cabbage last 45 minutes after removing beef to platter, covering in foil and placing in warm oven 250 degrees.  only used seasoning packet from corned beef.

Good basic recipe! I browned the meat first on a cast iron skillet  just to give it color, so it isn't just some grey piece of meat. I add a tiny bit of garlic powder and a bay leaf. I also used chicken broth instead of water. I cooked the meat first for 4 hours on low and added the potatoes, onion, and carrots with the meat for the last 4 hours(so the veggies don't get all mushy). I added the cabbage the last hour. It was perfect!

Best corned beef and cabbage ever!  I split the difference and cooked on high 4 hours and on low 4 hours.  Put the potatoes in at 4 hours and cabbage in at 6 hours.  Perfect!

After reading the zillions of reviews, I decided to trust the original recipe! I followed all directions to a T, added a couple turnips, and am eating it as we speak: delectable! And yes, I cooked it on HIGH as originally instructed in the recipe!

Since finding this recipe a few years ago, it's the only one my family and I use for St. Patrick's Day dinner. I was hesitant the first time making it, as I am not a beer drinker. Zero beer taste after 8 hours in a slow cooker. Simple recipe to make, with incredible flavors. Thank you for sharing your recipe with us. ??

I'll give it a 5....
However, mine turned out like a -5.
Evidently, I did something wrong. I'll try it again.
Maybe my corned beef was old. It's as hard as a rock.
I love allrecipes!!!!

In the past,  I had not been a fan of  corned beef in a slow cooker. I always preferred stove top simmering, but this recipe was excellent! The corned beef was super tender and vegetables were cooked perfectly. I will definitely make this again.

I made two briskets and my family ate all of it!  I substituted a can of beef broth for the water, and added the cabbage the last couple hours. My nephew said he didn’t like corned beef, but I asked him to try it, and he ended up having seconds.  In addition to the horseradish, I had horseradish mustard which is what I prefer. They were both a hit.

My slow cooker was not big enough to accommodate all of the ingredients so I improvised and used my dutch oven. The oven set at 500 once I placed the brisket and vegetables, etc. in the oven I turned the oven to 250 and it cooked slow for  about 7 +/- hrs. WOW!! Very tasty ;>)

Loved it.  I cooked it on low for 10 hours.  I used beef broth in place of the beer, for the wife. I used "baby" cut carrots instead of match-stick cut. I cut the cabbage into wedges with core attached to hold it together--cutting the core off when serving it--and placed the cabbage in the pot, on top of the beef, for the last 45-60 minutes. I also made a Guinness broth for those that liked the beer flavor by simmering a cup of the broth with a quarter-cup of Guinness. This was super easy and very good.

Started the crockpot at midnight, took the corn beef, potatoes, and onions out at 9 AM, cooked the cabbage for one hour, and it was perfect! I used one bottle of Guinness and  3 cups of water. Potatoes were not overcooked, corn beef was so tender and juicy! This recipe is a keeper! And yes I cooked it on high!

This recipe is AMAZING.  I'm sad to say that I didn't have 1 drop of beer in the house so I had to settle for 2 cans of chicken broth and 1 can of beef broth as well as 1 cup of water, that was my total liquid.  Other than that modification, I followed the recipe to a tee (except I cooked on low instead of high.  It cooked overnight).  Layered the red new potatoes, used baby carrots and threw in a small amount of celery I had that was just sitting in the crisper waiting to die!  In went the brisket and spices.  I set the Crock Pot on low and cooked it over night.  I cut the cabbage in wedges and added that (about 3/4 head) and tucked it into the broth around the meat.  Cooked for about an hour on high until the cabbage was tender.  It was SOOOOOOO good.  I've printed this off and it will be my go to for any further corned beef dinners.  Delicious.  Can't wait to try it with beer.  The meat was fall apart tender.  Thanks for such an easy, tasty recipe.

This is a great recipe.  I made a few changes after reading the reviews.  I started with a point cut corned beef brisket.  I put diced white onions, diced celery, chicken broth to cover the corned beef and a splash of apple cider vinegar in a crock pot.  Cooked on low for 14 to 15 hours.  When done, I wrapped the corned beef in foil and set aside to rest.  In the crock pot, I put a half a head of cabbage cut into eighths and cooked on high for an hour and a half.  When finished, I scooped out the cabbage, onions and celery into a serving dish and covered.  I put the corned beef back into the crock pot and warmed it up on high for about 10 minutes.  I then pulled it out, trimmed off the fat, shredded it on a serving dish and served it all with some roasted potatoes and carrots.  A really terrific meal on a cold and rainy night.  No leftovers for sandwiches, though.  The corned beef was incredibly tender and juicy.  I will definitely make this again.  It's been less then a week and I'm already getting requests for this meal again.  They are even offering to help slice the potatoes and onions!  A very good basic recipe that you can get creative with, if you want to.  Enjoy!

I cooked this at the recommended high temp and 9 hours.  I followed the directions and it was AMAZING!  The vegetables just came out mushy.  Next time I will make the vegetables the last hour maybe.  So happy I made this!  Even my picky kids LOVED it!

This is the 3rd time on St. Patrick"s day that I am making this recipe. It has become a tradition since the first year I made it. My family absolutely insists since it is the best tasting and softest corned beef recipe I have every made. Since we are a decent size group I use 2 flat cut corned beef pieces and it still comes out great.

I made this for the first St. Patty's Day in my new house and it's quite good! I used regular red potatoes instead of baby ones and didn't slice the carrots in matchsticks, but instead sliced them into quartered pieces. I also use 2 bottles of Guinness instead of one and a cup less water. it comes out beautifully with the cabbage in for the last hour. Not soggy at all and adds more flavor to the meat.

i don't eat red meat but i served it for St. Patrick's Day and everyone RAVED about it. The changes I made: Beef boulion cube in 2 cups of water instead of the bear (so 4 cups regular water -+ 2 cups with the melted boulion cube). I added a little fresh rosemary to the veggies before setting the beef in.

I made no changes to the recipe and I'm not sure I will ever make this again unless I do make some changes. For one, there was way too much liquid and cooking it in my crock-pot on high for 8 hours was absolutely wrong! I put it on at 8 am and it was supposed to be ready at 4 pm. We left the house and when we got back 4 1/2 hours later, it was done! I then had to keep it warm until 4 pm when our guest got here.
Oh, yeah....I will make some changes to the recipe in the future!

Great recipe! I used water instead of beer and I was afraid it would be too bland as the spice packet is so little, so I added some mustard seed, whole peppercorns, garlic, cloves, allspice and bay leaves (basically doubling/tripling the season packet). I skipped the cabbage only because hubby doesn't care for it but overall the flavor was great and the meat was tender. Even my 2 year old approved!

Have been using the slow cooker to make corned beef for years and I'll never go back to doing it any other way. So easy, so good and nearly effortless.  I agree with another reviewer about the beer.  I wouldn't use a dark beer or cook the beer (in the slow cooker) for more than an hour or it'll turn bitter. Best to use plain water. Terrific recipe, thanks!

The meat turned out great but i followed everyone’s suggestions of cooking it on low for 8 hours instead of high and none of the vegetables were cooked ?? I temped the meat twice to be sure and both times came out over 165. So perhaps follow the recipe to a tee!!l

This recipe is perfect as it's easily changeable for your tastebuds.  Brisket turned out amazing.  Changes I made - crockpot on LOW for 7 hours, had a 4 pound brisket.  Put the brisket in with water.  I did add a little bit of chicken bouillon.  If the meat is  a good one, you wouldn't need to add any bouillon or very little depending on your taste buds.  I normally don't like cooking with beer if I am adding veggies. We used yukon gold potatoes, I added them 4 hours in and will do them even later next time.  We like our cabbage really done, so added this with 1 hour left.  The brisket melts in your mouth.

I had a small round slow cooker, so I cut the recipe in half. By the time the brisket was in the pot, there was no room for the cabbage. Even without the cabbage the meal was awesome. The meat was just so tender and moist. I will keep this recipe and cook it again!

I actually made this this morning when i got off of work. The thing i forgot about was putting the cabbage at the end. I added it in the beginning. Will it end badly?  It's still cooking!! It smells delicious though!!!

Used the whole  11.2 oz of Guiness Drought Stout and it was delicious.  The broth was nice and light and the left over corned beef is great for sandwiches.

I skipped the beer and was really nervous about cooking it on high for 8 hours. I ended up doing on low and high for 9.5 hours, next time I will just do it on high! Super tender and yummy! I also used russets cut in half. Even my hubby complimented me on it, which never happens! Not much room to add my cabbage, should have boiled some extra potatoes and cabbage. I will do this again for sure.

Cooked 8 hours on low. Was not enough time. Fatty meat+ undercooked = not edible.

Turned out excellent! I would put in more cabbage next time though, maybe a whole head. I didn’t have any beer so I used half beef broth and half water and it still turned out very flavorful! My husband loved it and says it’s a keeper.

Just about perfect. I do not like "boiled" vegetables, so about five hours in, I removed the potatoes, carrots, and onions from the crockpot and continued the beef cooking. I did add the cabbage an hour before it was finished, and this worked great. 
About 15 minutes before serving, I returned the carrots, potatoes, and onions to the cooking liquid and removed the beef to stand for 15 minutes before slicing.

Made this today. Only change is I put coors light beer on it and put the cabbage in when I started the crock pot so it’d be soft and yummy. My boys devoured this so fast!!!

Excellent! I used 4lb corned beef followed the recipe exactly the same, except turned it on low after 5 hours based on all the other reviews. It turned out super tender, juicy and tasty! Sooo easy. Veggies were supper soggy... so we didn’t eat the veggies. It was about the meat, anyway. We had salad instead. Will make it again! Thank you to the person who created this recipe and the people who took the time to submit feedback!

This was a great recipe!! I had a 2.5 lb cut that worked perfect!  I used 4c. of beef broth rather than beer and stuffed the corned beef with garlic prior to cooking.  I used 4 smaller sized purple sweet potatoes (quartered) and 2 small onions (quartered) on the bottom.

This one is a keeper!  I used only water (no beer). I didn't have red potatoes, so used russet potatoes instead and it turned out great. Cooked for 9 hours on low + 1 more hour with cabbage. Yummy.

The corned beef was perfect consistency. It was firm enough that it didn't fall apart in the slow cooker, but still soft enough that I could cut it with the edge of a fork.  

I used Leinenkugel's Snowdrift Vanilla Porter, which was outstanding (both alone and in the recipe)

I love corned beef on rye w/mustard and used about 1lb for that purpose.

The only thing I did differently was to add an additional 3 tablespoons of pickling spice. 1 tablespoon over the bottom layer of vegetables before I added the corned beef, and  2 tablespoons on top of the corned beef and water before I poured in the beer. My family loves the flavor of pickling spice in the meal It is what makes the dinner special. Next time I think I'll reduce the water to 3 1/2 cups and add the whole 12 ounce beer.  I use Bush lite, so it does not have a strong flavor. The meat, potatoes and carrots were done in the 8 hours on high, and the cabbage was done in the 1 hour as was directed. Great meal. We r having the leftovers tonight!

I've made corned beef many, many times, but this was the best-tasting. I took the beef out of the slow cooker, put it on a tray and spread the fatty side with mustard, 1/4 c. brown sugar and a dash of cloves then broiled for a few minutes for a nice glaze. While that was in progress, I put the veggies and broth in a large skillet on the stovetop to cook them (instead of cooking in slow cooker).

I poured in the whole beer (Kona Lager) by accident and it came out great. Next time I'll continue to use a whole beer, but adjust down the water accordingly in the recipe. Do hold off on adding the carrots until halfway through if you can to keep them from getting mushy. The quality and taste of this recipe will depend highly on you having a very sharp chef's knife and your skill cutting thin slices!

Just had to make one change, since I cook with beer, and do not drink beer. Single cans of beer limited, so I just picked a can of Bud beer. Everything else was exactly the same. And it was the best, most tender corned beef I have ever made. The onion, cabbage, potatoes, and carrots came out perfect too. This is now the only recipe I will be using in the future.

Excellent recipe.  Only thing I did differently was not add the cabbage.  Instead I roasted in the oven with a little EVOO, salt and pepper.  I was afraid the cabbage might get a little mushy in the slow cooker.

I used a Bud Light for the beer so the meat was tender and moist, but the meal didn't taste like a strong beer flavor. I only added the veggies in for the final two hours of cooking and the cabbage for the last hour. They were soft and delicious. Next time I may put the potatoes in for only the final hour with the cabbage because they fell apart. It was delicious though! My family always put a splash of apple cider vinegar in our bowl with the cabbage when we're ready to eat. It mixes with the broth and is a delicious complement to the flavors. Don't overdo it, just try a splash and then figure it to your taste. You don't want it to overpower the meal.

Use a bottle of Irish Red and a quart of beef stock.  The spice packet that came with the corned beef was pathetic. I used a Tb. of McCormick Pickling Spice.  Excellent!

I made this recipe this past weekend and followed the directions as written.  One suggestion for anyone making this would be to add the vegetables much later, as they were over cooked & mushy using these instructions.  Also, the meat was flavorful, but not as tender as I had hoped.  I won’t t be making this again.

I only had a two pound corned beef and started cooking on low.  Two hours later it didn't look like it was cooking so I turned it up to high for five hours.  Everything turned out perfect.  I added the cabbage in the last hour of cooking.  I did not use any carrots and the potatoes were not mushy at all.

This was an amazing recipe. The balance between the sweetness and stout was fantastic. Best corn beef I have ever made. Family and friends truly enjoyed it. I will definitely use this recipe next time I want to cook a corn beef.

This was *so* easy! I put everything in the crock pot first thing in the morning, put in the cabbage after 8 hours, then served it an hour later. My husband & son absolutely loved it!

Yes, I will make it again, with a few minor changes.  I used 2 cups of water and 16oz of a porter beer, similar to stout I was advised.  It was plenty of liquid for about 5 lbs. of corned beef.  I did line my 7 qt slow cooker with heavy duty aluminum foil and it was easy to clean. An added bonus was the vegetable beef soup made the next day using all the veggies & broth, plus cooked ground beef, since there were just 2 of us on St. Pat's Day.  It tasted great and no hint of the porter beer.

I don't normally like corned beef. I made it for my husband. But this recipe was so tasty and juicy that it  will now be on my permanent rotation!

This was very good!  I cooked it for 8 hours on low and followed another's suggestion regarding the timing of the veggies.  After 5 hours I added the onions, carrots and potatoes (did not chop, added 2" pieces of carrot and cut the onion into about 8 wedges), and then in the last hour added the cabbage.  I also added a large clove of minced garlic.   Will definitely make this again.

Best corned beef and cabbage I've ever made. The meat stayed tender and didn't get dry. I was worried that the potatoes and carrots might get overcooked, but they were perfect!

Although The Corned Beef was extremely tender the vegetables completely fell apart. Couldn't distinguish between potatoes and onions. The timing is different on the written recipe as opposed to the video recipe. I seriously think there is an issue with the amount of time to cook. I did it exactly the way it said with a 9-hour recipe. Won't make it again because I'm not sure how long to cook it where the potatoes and vegetables will not fall apart.

This was outstanding! The only thing I would do differently is add more cabbage. However, because one can only add so much cabbage to the crockpot this is what I'm going to do next time. Save the liquid from the crock pot, put it in another pot on the stove and boil more cabbage in it. That way, the cabbage tastes the same as if it were boiled in the crockpot. I will cook my corned beef and cabbage this way from now on. My husband loved it and said we need to have this on other days, not just on St.Patrick's Day!

Great recipe in the slow cooker! I thought it was better than moms actually 
 I did follow a few of the other reviews ( that’s why i like this site, the reviews can help catch errors  and make small improvements) they recommended using beef broth I also added water and half a bottle of whatever beer was in the fridge . I used 6 pounds of corn beef one point cut and one flat cut the point cut was super fatty so the fatty broth flavored all of the cabbage and potatoes and carrots really nicely I cooked on high for the first hour and then cook the meat on low for another seven hours I didn’t add the potatoes and carrots until halfway through. I was pleased and I’m a harsh judge of my own cooking . Would make again , thanks

My tweaks to this recipe were slight, I used 3 cups of water instead of  4 and I added a full bottle of beer. I also cooked it on low for roughly 11 hours. It was tender, SO flavorful and delicious! My family loved it

This was the worst corned beef and cabbage I have ever made.  The beer detracts from the flavor of the meat and cabbage.  It just did not have a good flavor.  The cooking meathod was good, I will just use broth instead of beer next time and add a little more black pepper.

I made this yesterday for St. Patty’s Day. After reading some of the reviews about how cooking it on high for 8 hours would be too long at that temp, I decided to cook it for 8 hours on low. We were camping and out and about all day so once we got back anticipating a delicious dinner the meat was not cooked. The onions weren’t even cooked through. Very disappointed! I continued to cook it through the night on low and the next morning it was ready. Needless to say, cook this on high for 8 hours! Cooking it on low doubled my cooking time. This recipe is very good and worth trying. I used a bottle of Guinness along with the water and added a little garlic powder and everything turned out very tasty!!

It seems the difference on whether to use HIGH or LOW temps depends on the crockpot. I used my small one on HIGH, but I guarantee the larger one would have been too hot on high. Didn't use beer - didn't miss it. Delicious recipe - meat came out tender and moist and the vegetables were perfect. I did use larger carrot pieces. Will use this recipe again and again - it's THAT GOOD!

I spent hours looking at all the recipes for corned beef.  I finally decided on this one.  It was easy to make.  The corned beef was very good, however the vegetables were tasteless.    I love cabbage,  but this cabbage was not enjoyable.  I was so disappointed.

I have made this dish several times now with excellent results, it has always been a hit with friends and family.  I make only minor changes, in which I season with cloves, garlic powder, onion powder,  use  Full Can or Bottle of beer and start off cooking on HIGH for first 3 hrs then reduced to LOW for remainder of the time.

The sounds my wife makes when eating this are a testament to the deep flavor profile of this dish. Also, I chopped up the leftovers and made some empanadas using two pie crusts with egg wash. Unbelievably delicious. Thanks for making our St.Pattys Weekend!  Between the food and the band First Highland Watch playing AC/DC We had a killer weekend.

I had only 3 pound brisket and used 2 cups of water and 8 ounces of Heineken beer. Although I had about  2 cups of liquid left over.  I found the taste was not a good as it could have been with less water.

My slow cooker lid is very tight and did not allow any evaporation while cooking so next time I will reduce the water. I reduced the cook time to 6 hours for the corned beef and vegetables to cook and 30 minutes for the cabbage.

Always wanted to try cooking it with beer. Now that I have tried it, will stick with beef broth. Just my personal preference. First time in the slow-cooker though and I wouldn't change a thing. The corned beef was fork tender and the potatoes were perfect.

Absolutely the best corn beef and cabbage recipe I have tried. We all enjoyed it so much. I used a can of Bud Light beer. I cut my carrots in big chunks, quartered the red potatoes, and sliced chunks of onion. I cut the cabbage in big chunks and added them to the crock pot  an hour before it was done. I think 9 hours is too long for a 4 pound cut of meat. I like to slice my beef and it was falling apart as the electric knife tried to slice it. Man it was so tasty.

Excellent! The corned beef was very tender and I also left out the beer and added chicken broth and garlic powder but it was done after 4 hrs. and I didn't need to have it on high setting all four hrs. either.

A wonderful change from the usual corned beef dish. I added a bit of heat to mine with Jalapeno peppers - just enough to satisfy my need for heat. Turned out beautifully!

Standard corned beef recipe, but need either Modelo Negra or Guinness Stout. A few bay leaves and cook all day. I add the spices towards the end of the cook and also sprinkle some black peppercorns in. Baby carrots and small taters (red or white) and of course onions. I also add the cabbage towards the end of the cook.

It's hard to mess up a corned beef dinner. Don't forget the soda bread. Also some bread for Reuben sandwiches.  Swiss cheese and sour kraut. Yum!

This was simple and easy to make.  Also, a big hit with the family.  I trimmed the corned beef of excess fat, but leave a bit on for flavor.  The corned beef was placed in the crock pot fat side up.  I used the included season pack, and also added garlic and onion seasoning.  I poured low sodium beef broth in the crock pot  about half-way up the meat.  I used 4lb + corned beef in a 8 quart crock pot.  This was set on low and cooked for 4 hours.  At the 4 hour mark I added the small red potatoes (cut in quarters), chopped white onions, and baby carrots.  At 8 hours, I removed the corned beef, and added the chopped cabbage.  The cabbage was stirred in and allowed to cook with other ingredients on low for another hour.  After that hour the crock pot was turned off and a wonderful meal enjoyed.

Cooked on high for 8 hours and it turned out perfect! I didn’t cook the veggies with it or add beer or the seasoning packet that comes with the corned beef. Just 4 cups of water and that’s it. Not tough or dry.

Excellent!  I’ve always boiled corned beef, then glazed in the oven.  The crock pot made it much more tender ... in fact, pretty much falling apart!  Realized I didn’t have an onion, but followed everything else in the recipe hours, starting with just meat, adding carrots and potatoes after first 3 hours, and cabbage the last hour.  All veggies were a little mushier than we like, but still had good flavor.  Next time, might add carrots and potatoes half way through, and only 30 minutes for cabbage.

This a great and easy recipe that anyone can follow. This was my first time making a crock pot recipe and also a corned beef meal. It came out so perfect. HOWEVER! Definitely cook on Low for 8 hours then add your cabbage for the next hour. I also used stout beer and not a light Pilsner beer. That might have helped! Slainte!

I have been making corn beef and cabbage for 40+ years Same way as this except I just use the small baby carrots. I often have used vegetable broth instead of the water. Just as good without the beer too.

I always use this recipe for St. Patrick's Day. The only change I have made over the years, is to not put the potatoes in the crock pot. They get far too mushy. I just roast the potatoes in the oven instead.

Followed the recipe exactly.  To me it was dry.  We sliced it all up after it was done and poured some of the juice back on it to let it soak which made it a lot better.  I still didn't think it was as good as good corned beef should be.

I've made this twice.  The first time, I heeded the advice of many previous reviews and set the slow cooker to LOW.  I was disappointed with the results.  The second time, I set the cooker to HIGH, as the recipe calls for.  MUCH better!    Cook this on HIGH and enjoy!

I followed the recipe exactly as listed, other than cooking the cabbage on the stove instead of in the slow cooker. It came out fairly bland. I deliberately chose a dark beer to give it a strong flavor and it came out with no flavor at all. We ate it, but we won't be repeating this recipe again.

Great recipe and with so many 5 star reviews I made it as written even though there were a few things I thought to change  but didn't. I will confess to adding  generous charge of black pepper as thats the way I like my cabbage.
It turned out a treat!  The fluid level in my cooker was to half way up the meat which was maybe a tad too much but a delicious result just the same, especially the left overs  a few days later.

I ate corned beef and cabbage with potatoes growing up frequently. My dad cooked it all together in a pot of water and we had to load it with salt and butter and even horseradish to make it palatable. I used a bottle of Iron City, no water as I ran out of room for liquid. So help me, this is my new favorite food. Do not listen to the people who say you don't need the beer. At least try it with the beer. I can't get over what a vast improvement that made, plus adding the carrots and onions, which I had never had before. The thought of corned beef and cabbage used to make me cringe. Now it makes my mouth water! Thank you!!

The only beer I had at home was Bud light. I cooked everything on low for about 5 hours and then on high for 3. I put the cabbage in about 3-45 minutes before it was done and everything turned out DELICIOUS!!

I made my 13 year old Corned Beef & Cabbage for the first time using this recipe, and a Sazon Goya spice pack, and the look on her face when she took that first bite was worth it. She told me it was the most amazing thing she's ever put in her mouth.  I've made this recipe for her twice now, and it is amazing! She even ate the carrots, and she hates carrots! "6oz of light beer"

Quick prep, and my Family couldn't get enough.

Used Frozen Pearl Onions instead of chopped, and a bag of Baby Carrots instead of sliced.  

I've used both light and dark beers for this, and the results are still great!

I followed this for my first time EVER making corned beef and cabbage and I'll keep referring to this recipe. I did make some changes though:

-Was pressed for time, so I cooked on High for 4.5 hours
-I added the cabbage for the last 45 minutes of cooking, resetting my crock pot for the new time. Still cooked it on High.
-I omitted the beer, because I really needed 6.5 cups of water, not 4.

When I was ready to add the cabbage at the end, there wasn't enough room in the crock pot, so I threw the oven on at 350 degrees, lined a baking sheet with tinfoil, and threw the brisket in the oven for 45 minutes while the cabbage cooked in the crock pot with everything else. Still came out delicious!

*****UPDATE 3/19/2018  2nd year making this on St. Paddy's Day...this time my husband put it together and followed the recipe to a T, using Guiness...and 2nd year of the best darn corned beef ever.  Again, cooked on HIGH - 4lb in a 6qt Crock Pot.  And yep, we pulled the potatoes out, mashed them with lots of butter and parsley, and topped them with the corned beef and veggies.  Incredible. *****  3/27/2017 Best corned beef and cabbage I've ever had!  Potatoes are supposed to be like that, people.  If you know your corned beef & cabbage,  you'd pull them out and mash them with butter & lots of parsley.  Or eat it all in a bowl like a stew...and lick the bowl clean like I did. ;-)  PERFECT recipe as-is!  And yes, I cooked a 3lb brisket on HIGH for 8 hours.  Was melt in yo mouth, delicious!  I followed it to a T with the exception of one lil thing...I used half water & half beef stock, only because I had some in the fridge I needed to use up.  Thank you!  This one is a keeper!

Very delicious and super simple to make.  I used russet potatoes because that's what was on hand and omitted the onion because that wasn't on hand. Very pleased. Also, beef broth instead of water.

Made it just as debi does--no beer or anything but water and the seasoning packet from the corned beef. Cooked on LOW for eight hours, and it disappeared fast, cabbage and all. Cabbage cooked in corned beef water is a whole different vegetable than plain cabbage. (On the stove, I take the beef out and put the cabbage in a half hour or so before serving. No, the cabbage isn't crisp. It just tastes good.)

Best way to make a corned beef. Easy, tender, juicy, flavorful.. Went out and bought another corned beef so that we can have it again.

This was my first corned beef brisket , it was not dry. The meat was good and the veggies were, too. I used part beer and part beef stock. I am sure I will be using this again next St. Patrick's day.

I made it the way reviewer ChiGirl did but left out the beer and added some beef flavor Better Than Boullion to the water. It cooked on high for all 8 hours. I added cabbage and carrot about an hour before eating. With the addition of the pickling spice on top, the house smelled enchanting all day. The beef was super tender and everything was flavorful - even the potatoes. I'll be using this recipe for years to come.

DELICIOUS! I  used this recipe for the first time this last St. Patty's day. I made the recipe even easier by using baby carrots and didn't quarter the baby red potatoes (they were already very small). I omitted the water and just used a whole bottle of beer.  Came out moist and tasted delicious! Veggies were tasty and tender but not mushy. I was pleasantly surprised. So easy and so yummy! I'll be making this again and again.

Slight changes- Carrots in chunks, fewer potatoes (small red and halved), no beer, but water to near top of meat + 1 TBS beef base.  Four hours on high, four on low.  Removed meat and turned back to high.  Added cabbage wedges and cooked about another half hour until tender.  I think temperature and time often depends on the appliance.

I will definitely do this one again.  I cut the water in half, but did everything else the same.  Next time, I will use 2 cups of water, double the stout, double the cabbage, and use half the carrots.  That's just our personal preferences.

Absolutely delishious. Fork tender, I will make this again but not put the potatoes in at the same time as the roast. They came out a little mushy, as far as the cabbage goes, I waited and put that in about an hour before the meat was done..

I loved the recipe. It didn't take as long as the recipe said.  The beer was a good addition but I might try using an Irish red or Scottish ale. The American pale ale that I used changed the flavor of the carrots in an unpleasant way.

Was the best my husband has ever had and our friends were also very impressed.  Only change  I made was that I used baby cut carrots instead of shoe string cuts.  Will definitely make again!

Made it as stated in the recipe. It was pretty good, although I don't have a lot to compare, since it's probably the second time I've had it in my life. Would I make it again? Maybe in a year's time :-). 

But I have to say, dicing up leftovers and cooking as  corned beef hash was quite tasty the next day!

I used Guiness for the beer and added a little bit more pickling spice of my own, but this was the most flavorful and moist corned beef I've ever made.

Very good but I did make the following adjustments for the veggies since I don't like them too mushy: added the potatoes whole, then toward the end of the cooking time I added a bag of baby carrots for about 45min, then added the cabbage for the final 20min.

Very tasty recipe and the corned beef was amazing.  My mother has no great love for the taste of beer, but she was a fan of this meal.  She was very surprised when I told her what it was simmered in as the flavors blended well.  I did choose a lighter flavored beer but later thought that a more robust flavor would have enhanced the dish.  

I can't wait to make this again (and not wait a year to do it).

I used beef broth instead of water (2.5 cans although 2 cans would've been fine I think); no beer;  cooked on low for 8 hrs.; added carrots and potatoes about 4 hrs. before it was done and the cabbage 1.5 hrs. before it was done.  Next time I will put the whole cabbage in there.
Fantastic recipe!!

WOWZA! Followed the recipe, but did add one peeled and cut up sweet potato with the baby red/veggie mix. Used 6 oz of Guinness Stout from the can. Cooked it on LOW for 8 hours, and added the cut up cabbage for the last hour (still cooking it all on low). Was so darn good! I cannot wait to make Reuben sandwiches with this meat! It was so tender and perfect. Can't wait for next year St. Patty's day! Thank you!

I cooked this as directed, minus the beer (didn't have any on-hand) and with carrot coins vs matchsticks. It was hard to fish out the veg at the bottom and under all the cabbage. My husband wanted to finish the beef in the oven, so after 7 hours we cut the beef in half and tried it his way on half. He made a quick glaze by simmering/reducing 1:1 OJ and bourbon, then basted before cooking on 350 for 30 min and basted twice more before removing from oven and resting off-heat/covered for about 15 min. His half had a more intense flavor and the fat on top was delicious; I'll finish the whole corned beef this way next time. I'll also make the carrots bigger (baby carrot sized) and may use just 1/2 cabbage. 4 stars as written, and super easy; 5 stars with my husband's oven-roast-rest version.

Great recipe and I will not be waiting til next St Paddy"s day to make it again.

Only changes I made was adding coarse chopped carrots, celery and onion to the combo of beer and beef stock.  After about 2.5H on high, I removed that veg along with about 10oz of the flavorful broth.  The broth was going to be used for a braised bacon and cabbage side, and the old veg discarded.

To the slow cooker, I now added new baby potatoes and some thick cut carrots along with the beef till all was done.

I made this with some very minor tweaks. I did approx. 4 cups of water and 8 oz of Fosters beer (essentially I added just enough liquid to ALMOST cover the meat). I cooked on high for 4 hours, then low for the remaining 4 hours ( I started this at 6pm so it would be ready for work's lunch the next day at 4am...dedication I know). 1/2 way through the cooking process I flipped the meat. With about 2-3 hours to go I added the cabbage (I also added 1/2 a head of purple cabbage) to the very top of the crock pot so it would NOT get super soggy. 

This came out amazing...no one in my house ate this except for me (super picky eaters), but I didn't even care I was eating this 3 day later. I added a little more fresh ground pepper, but followed the recipe pretty true. This is now my gold standard!!  Enjoy

Great recipe! I did not use beer just water. I peeled and cut russet potatoes into large chunks and did the same with the carrots. Cooked on low for 8 hours and added the cabbage in the last hour. Turned out perfect and I would certainly make it again.

Used flat cut for the first time. Definitely less greasy and less fat than the point cut. So much liquid - everything tasted the same. Next time I will try an oven method.

The corned beef turned out very tender and flavorful.  I personally didn't like the texture of the potatoes and carrots (somewhat mushy).  I followed the directions exactly. Maybe I'll cut the veggies into larger pieces next time, but overall this is a good recipe.

This was delicious!  I read the other reviews before preparing. I did what someone suggested and put in a tsp of beef base and water. I didn't use beer. I also did as another suggested and cooked it for one hour or so on high then turned it to low. I added the carrots and potatoes 4 hours later and turned it on high for another hour then turned it back to low. One problem that I did have was adding the cabbage later. I think that I added it an hour before it was done and it was still hard although I did use cabbage wedges. I pulled the corned beef out and took the cabbage out with some of the juice and finished it in a pot on the stove for 20 mins or so.  I have to tell you that I'm not a huge corned beef fan but this was just outstanding. The cabbage was still delicious finished on the stove. I also made the creamy horseradish and garlic spread as one suggested and it was fantastic with the corned beef too. The recipe is on the AR site. Look it up. Thank you for the corned beef recipe. This is a keeper!

We served this on homemade rolls as corned beef and cabbage sliders. and it was FANTASTIC!

The last time I tried corned beef I was really young and just didn't like it. This year for St. Patrick's Day we decided to throw a party and I gave it a go again. I used 3 cups water and 1 cup beef broth. I put the veggies in at the begining as the instructions call for and they were fine. They were really soft but I prefer that. I used Killian's Irish Red for the beer and it tasted great! As some other comments suggested, I took the beef out after 8 hours on low, let it rest for 20 minutes while I put the cabbage in, then turned the cooker to warm and added the beef back in.

I'm not a big fan of corned beef and cabbage, but it's one of my husband's favorite recipes, so I decided to make it for St. Patrick's day. It came out delicious according to my husband. I used Guiness beer, which gave it a great flavor. I used a 3.5 lb beef brisket and cooked it on high in the slow cooker for 5-6 hours. I let the brisket sit on a platter for 15 minutes covered loosely in foil before carving. Would've been yummy served with horseradish, but I forgot to pick some up.

The only change I made was I didn't add cabbage. Grocery store was out on St. Paddys day.  Go figure. Everything else was as written and my corned beef turned out completely dry. I've never experienced a dry corned beef in over thirty years or f making them. I didn't think it was possible. Have no clue how it could have happened   Crock pot was on low the entire time. Actually used a 4.5 lb roast so if anything it should have been underdone. My bad for trying a new method with company coming! Oh well, live and learn. I'll stick to the old fashioned boiling method.

There is definitely a typo in the recipe, it should be cook on low for 8 hours which is what I did and it came out excellent!!  8 hours on high would explain the mushy vegetables because mine came out perfect.  I did also remove the roast after a little over 8 hours and added the cabbage to the pot for about 25 minutes and that was just right. And of course it made incredible corned beef hash which is my ulterior motive for making this recipe, yum!!

Instead of beer, I just used water. Skipped the carrots and onions. Potatoes on the bottom, brisket on top, seasoning packet, covered it all in water and let it cook on low in the slow cooker for about 8 hours. Chopped the cabbage into wedges, and added it into the mix for about 2 hours, still on low. Came out just the right texture. I was worried it would need salt, but it was super flavorful! The meat was very tender and moist, it fell apart.
Perfect for St. Patrick's Day.

I usually get my St. Patrick's Day meal from the local church group, but this year they held the event a day early and I missed it!  I decided to cook my own dinner, but being a genuine amateur cook, I needed a recipe that was simple and easy, and this one fit the bill to a tea.  I followed it to the letter and it came out perfect!  My daughter, who is on a diet..., ate two full plates, and even the grand kids liked it!  Great recipe!

This was a fabulous and easy Corned Beef and Cabbage recipe.  I cooked about a 4 lb. corned beef  so my roast cooked for about 8 hrs. on high.  I added a whole can of beer, about 1/2 c. caraway seeds, a bay leaf, fresh garlic, and a little worcestershire sauce.  I added a liberal amount of sea salt and fresh ground pepper.  I also cooked the vegetables from the start and they were all deliciously flavored . The beef juices made a delicious gravy to our over all of the corned beef and veggies..

Every year I make corned beef and cabbage and every year I am disappointed and think its dull.  I found this recipe and got a couple of ideas, but I still used what I already know.  Between my previous knowledge and this recipe it came out wonderfully.  I only cooked it for 6 hours, which was enough.  I also used Coors Banquet and nothing but (I did not add water).  I also used another teaspoon or so of corned beef spices.  I also serve with whole seed mustard and horseradish.  It was really good.

A delicious recipe. I used thick cut slices of corned beef from the deli and it cooked in 6 hours. I also added some home made venison sausage which added some spice to the flavor. We will be adding this to the family favorites.

St Patricks Day March 2017
My corn beef with all th trimmings came out so delicious in my crock pot; I didnt have beer and substiuted  beef broth; Corn beef was cooked perfectly and I added cabbage one hour before; My  Irish girlfriends (both Irish descent), loved my dinner; Not bad for an Italian!

Came out perfectly! I added some salt, pepper, and a bay leaf to the veggies before adding the beer and corned beef.  Cooked for 8 hours on high, which I was nervous about but it made the most tender meat! Added the cabbage the last 45 mins of cooking.  This was a total crowd pleaser!

This was a hit at my office party. The preparation and ease of this recipe has compelled me to leave a 5 star rating. I did steam the cabbage separately and added it right before serving. The spice packet is more than enough. I'll definitely be making this again.

Being in the slow cooker for 8+ hours, the potatoes take on far to much of the spicing from the corned beef, very bitter flavor, this will be my go to recipe for corned beef but I will eliminate the potatoes and prepare them separate.

I did read loads of reviews...after careful consideration of the "don't cook on high, do cook on high" (all reviewers seemed very passionate about their choice) I decided to go with the recipe, HIGH 8 hrs.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I used the packet that came with the brisket, no extra spices needed in my opinion.  I did however not place in the potatoes and carrots until after meat had cooked for about 4 hrs.  The potatoes would have been too mushy for my taste.  Placed in the cabbage the last hour and WOW!!!  Absolutely amazing!  I will not wait until next St. Patty's day to make this dish again!

The corn beef was delicious. I used Killians Beer and it added a good flavor. The only problem was the potatoes were falling apart. I think next time I will only cut them in half.
Will definitely make it again.

My wife dreads the annual corned beef meal. Not this year! Followed this recipe exactly as written and my whole family enjoyed the most flavorful and tender corned beef we have ever had. I will cook this again!

Made one on high and one on low. Both turned out great. The one on low had more flavor. The one on high was more tender but had less flavor.

Didn't make any changes AT ALL.  Yes - crockpot was on high for 8 hours.  My husband said it was the best corned beef and cabbage meal he'd ever had.  The meat was sooo tender.  From now on, I won't make this any other way.

I'm not sure why so many like this. Overcooked when cooked on low. Crock pot corned beef is a great idea. However, this recipe makes everything else mush.

Success! This was my first corned beef. There are only three of us. No one really cares for beer so I had to buy a single bottle. I picked Saranac Irish Red Pale Ale. Worked out great. Started the beef first, added carrots and potatoes 30 minutes later. Cabbage was added the last 30 min of cooking. Will make again

Great!! Yes, cook on high if you want it to fall apart. My hubby prefers his veggies extra soft so I cooked them with the meat the entire time. After reading a few other reviews I used beef broth, omitted onions, removed brisket and veggies at the end and cooked the cabbage separate.  the whole family ate it! I also used the creamy garlic horseradish sauce. My picky 5 year old dipped his biscuits in the sauce.

I used all the same ingredients.  I let the vegetables go too long, so they were soft, but the meat was fantastic.  I actually made the recipe for the corned beef.  I took it to a potluck with small buns and horseradish sauce and mustard for sliders.  Two people came up to me and immediately demanded the recipe!
I think it is important to get very lean corned beef.  I found mine at Costco and it was a gorgeous piece of meat.

This is the best recipe i have found....the 8 hrs on HIGH, is CORRECT...i put onion, baby carrots and small red potatoes on the bottom.It has never been mushy . I take 1 point  cut and 1 flat cut side by side ..about 2/12 lbs each ...i have a bigger slow cooker- water to about an inch from the top of the meat - add just spices from meat and some additional peppercorns. I use about 2 good splashes of stout beer for a little extra flavor- NOT the 6 ounces (too much). I am very particular about the cabbage so the last hour of cooking, i boil the cabbage separate about 1/2 hr until tender and THEN pull apart and put in crock for the last 1/2 hour to absorb some flavor from the broth- its AMAZING

This is my go to recipe for St. Patrick's Day. Delicious!! The only thing I do different is not adding the beer. As other reviewers mentioned, adding water works just fine. Make sure you add the spices that come with the corned beef. Thanks for posting this yummy and easy recipe.

I have made this many many times with no additional liquid at all it really isn't necessary! The meat and potatoes and carrots have enough liquid on their own. 8 hours on low not high. I fry my cabbage in butter salt and pepper but that is just personal preference.

Made this recipe before. Very easy and delicious! Did not use the beer either time and the corned beef was still tasty. Next time I will incorporate more vegetables. Cooked on low for a total of 7-1/2 hours. Tomorrow I make Soda Bread! Definitely will make again.

I cooked it for 9.5 hours on low and it came out perfect.  No beer is necessary, I just added water but you can use beer if you like.  Overall, this is the easiest way to prepare corned beef.

Sorry to rate the recipe so low, but just came home from work. I have a slow cooker that  America's Test Kitchen rated as best in their slow cooker cook book. Went to the meat counter at a nice grocery store last night and bought a four lb brisket. The recipe didn't say which part of the brisket to buy, there were two ends and then there was a middle. More direction would have been helpful. The butcher said one end is fattier than the other. I thought because i was using a slow cooker I would get the "fattier" one. Also, the recipe  didn't say how much seasoning to use that would have been helpful. The meat counter was just handing out the packets. I think it was too much. Also, would get some cheese cloth or a tea ball and put the seasoning it it. My husband hates slow cooker recipes, so when i saw the heat (high) and the time (eight hours). I thought I would start it on high for two hours and then turn it to low for eight. Even then the meat came out too mushy. Also, three cups of water would have been ok I think. The liquid was bubbling up over the sides of the liner. A couple of minor things; I felt that the carrots were sliced too thin and the potatoes could have been halved. Won't make it again. Not sure if the beer taste just erases all the other problems?

Next time, I will cook on Low instead of High. I will also cut the carrots into pieces roughly the size of the potatoes for a different texture. This was delicious, but I like the texture of the chunkier carrots. Might try it using parsnips in place of potatoes.

I love this recipe. I made it with and without the ale, and it is better with. The thing that surprised me is the flavor of the veggies is so enhanced by the ale and the corned beef. Oh Yum! After I read the reviews I held the cabbage out until the last 20 minutes, and it is perfect.

I followed the recipe as it was......I gave it a 4 just because I was confused to cook on high or low.....I cooked on high for 1/2 the time and then put it on low for remaining time.   It was tasty and will use again.....

This recipe actually worked out much better than some of the other recipes I have previously tried.  The only variation I attempted was to put the cabbage in two hours before it was done instead of one.  The spousal unit prefers her cabbage a bit more on the "tender" side.  Still, the family unit found the meal to be more delightful than expected.

This was the most delicious corned beef and cabbage that I've ever made!!!!  I used water instead of beer (3/4 full), added a little garlic salt, dill seeds, two cloves of garlic, and onion powder.  I added the veggies about 5 1/2 hrs in and the cabbage an 1 1/2 hrs after that.  Cooked another hour and viola!!!!  So flavorful, delicious, and tender!

I made this for Thanksgiving and my family loved it and gobbled it all up! Definitely a hit. Would recommend the unsalted broth and I made the cabbage separately. I slow cooked it for 12 hours and would not change a thing next time.

This recipe came out perfectly. I added as many additional vegetables as my slow cooker could hold. Leftover potatoes and corned beef made great hash a few days later.

I used my crock pot on high for 12 hours and the meat was still tough.  I transferred it into another pot & simmered it for 1 hour until the meat softened.  I simmered the carrots/potatoes/onions in a separate pot.  I put the cabbage with the corn beef  & simmered for 1 hr.  End the end, the corn beef came out tender and the vegetables were delicious.  In the future I doubt I will be using my crock pot to make corn beef.

Very easy and adaptable to personal tastes. I put on low in slow cooker from 7pm. At 5 am not was there a good aroma in the house!!! I then added the cabbage for 20 minutes. Put cornbeef in a glass pan then putt potatoes, cabbage, onions, and carrots in another. Put in fridge and at dinner time reheated! 
Tonight it's Reuben sandwiches with the left overs. My fiance ate twice last night.
Even my very very picky 14 year old niece ate twice!!

I made this using water in the place of beer and including the spice packet that comes with the corned beef and it was fantastic. I just put all the ingredients (minus cabbage) in the slow cooker before work and when I got home at the end of the day I added the cabbage. This is there only way I will make this from now on.

So maybe I didn't make it the way the recipe said, I didn't see a need for all the veggies when all I wanted was some great corned beef for sandwiches. I used beef broth and beer and the meat was amazing! Also, instead of discarding the beer and broth from the slow cooker, I strained it, kept it in the fridge for a few days and then made a pot of gravy for mashed potatoes or it was just sopped up with some fresh rolls. That got some pretty rave reviews from everyone that tried it!  #cookingwithwingman

Holy cow, this is the easiest, best recipe ever!  I've made this many times, and it's always a crowdpleaser.   Tonight I did add fresh garlic, but I didn't really notice any difference.  So as-is works great!  I ALMOST changed the water to half water and half beef broth, but I forget how incredible it tastes just with water when it's done.  I'm sure it would be too strong, salty, or just not right.  Again, don't change a thing!

Hello-- I made this it got good reviews.  I have to be honest I'm not a big meat eater, so I use my BF & mom as my testers.  My mistake was 1- I did semi clean the meat off: 0 yes- I did & 2- I poured the juice the meat is packaged in down the drain:0...I didn't know... Yes- I did use the packet seasoning that came with the corned beef & I used red cabbage...NOw for the reviews...the meat seemed semi tough...other than that it was good....So, now I know don't wash the corned beef and don't pour the juices down the drain! I will make this again....better armed w/ mom instructions.....

I cooked a 4 lb brisket. Unfortunately this one did not have a fat cap. Cooked on high for 4 hrs. left it in the pot for 1/2 hr after shutting it down. OVERCOOKED! Fell apart coming out of the pot. Could have been the no fat cap?

I used whole baby carrots and potatoes, omitted the beer and it was delish.  My husband loved it, even though he thought he didn't like corned beef. Next time, I may try using guinness beer in place of half the water.  My crockpot was full of liquid using only the 4 cups called for in the original recipe, so I don't think I could've fit the beer in anyway.

Very good.  There was too much liquid though, I would cut it in half. I cooked in on low and not high for 9 hours. Put it in at 9 am, added carrots at 2 pm, cabbage at 4, and we ate a delicious meal at 6.

1) Drop the beer unless you like food that tastes NOTHING like corned beef and ALL like Guinness...YUCK!!!! An entire meal that only 2 of 9 people liked...not sure why this gets so many stars.

2) 9 hours was way too much for 4lbs of meat...8 hours with the last 30-40 minutes for cabbage.

Probably the best corned beef I've ever had. I did a combination of the suggestions in the reviews. I did 2 cups water and 2 cups beef broth and I used a full beer. Regarding the temperature, I put it on high for the first 6 hours and then switched it to low and put the cabbage on top for the last 3 hours. Then, i pulled the meat out and let it rest for 15 minutes covered with foil for about 15 minutes before slicing. Everything turned out perfect and delicious.

I added a little extra pickling spice and followed the other comments of a LOW crock pot setting, but the rest was the same. Best corned beef I've ever had.

I have to wonder if the person who submitted this recipe  ever really made it. Even with our 6 quart slow cooker there was no room left for the cabbage. We had to cook the cabbage in a separate pot on top of the stove. The results were delicious though.

HolyYumBatman! After reading the reviews, I made the following changes:
-Used 1 can of Guinness Draft in addition to water
-Added 4 chopped cloves of garlic and 2 bay leaves
-Added the carrots and potatoes halfway through
-Pulled everything out after 8 hours, then cooked cabbage in remaining liquid for 1 hour (I only did this because I ran out of room in the pot)
-Served with a drizzle of stone ground mustard on top
I left the crockpot on HIGH the entire time and it turned out great! This recipe is a keeper!

I never liked the boiled corned beef and cabbage method and baked it for several years which was good.  Sometimes I couldn't get the baked quite right so when I saw this I thought I would try it. This slow cooker method is FABULOUS!!!
I will admit I changed it a bit, but not much.  I only used beer  - no water and cut my carrots in large pieces and only halved my baby potatoes.  I also thought the cooking time was too long for my slow cooker. By 6 hrs in the corned beef was fall apart.  Next time I'll reduce the time and start it on low.
After experimenting for 20 plus years, I finally found a recipe/cooking method that cannot be improved!  Search Over!

This was a big hit. I think this will become a St. Patty Day dish for me. I used 1/2 a red onion when I put the meet in the slow cooker then added a yellow onion four hours later. That was the only change I made.

I wasn't very happy with the result but I used a dark beer which was a mistake. The flavor overpowered the other ingredients. I'll have to try it again with a different beer.

It was good, however next time I will use the corned beef with the spices on the side.  ( I bought one with the spices on already)  Other than the corned beef not being infused enough with the spices for my taste it was very good. I did not use beer at all, just used organic chicken broth.

Added veggies half way through and took it all out to "rest" and cooked cabbage in there for 20 minutes. All was perfect. We don't like soggy cabbage though, some do!  This way was crisp and flavorful.

I followed this recipe exactly and these are my comments:
1.	I agree with another reviewer: do not use a dark beer.  I used Budweizer.
2.	Do not add any other spices other than the spice packet that comes with your corned beef.
3.	If you put your veggies in at the beginning as the recipe states, they will come out mushy.  I will definitely wait until about half way through cooking time to add the veggies.
4.	At the end of cooking and before slicing you must, MUST take your corned beef out of the liquid and let it rest so it can sort of solidify together.  This will allow you to cut against the grain and get a nice, tender slice.  I can’t stress this enough.  I did not do this (didn’t learn until after).  I took my corned beef straight out of the crock pot and onto the cutting board.  Without any time to rest, it was impossible to cut into slices and completely fell apart into a pile of long, chewy corned beef strings.

I would love to say this recipe was a great success, unfortunately, that wasn't the case for me.  After making this corned beef and reading numerous reviews and speaking to my husband, here is what I would do to try this again (thank you fellow critical cooks who have offered their feedback here).
1. I have a Kitchenaid Slow Cooker and the high was too high.  I have learned that slow cookers can be slightly different with temps. The corned beef was greyish and not the lovely red is should have been.  For my cooker, I should have done 8 hours on low.
2. Remove the corned beef at 8 hours, put in the cabbage for a remaining hour to cook.
3. As for positioning your corned beef.  Place the meaty side downward into the broth, with the fatty side up (either still in the broth or sticking out of it.
4. I would have added some pepper corns... just because I like them.
Overall, it was not the tastiest corned beef, but this recipe offers some solid ideas.  I wish recipe submissions would include details such as (meaty side down, so as to keep moist).
Some of us newer chefs could learn a bit faster and have a tastier meal learning some of these tips. I will try this recipe again, so thank you for the good idea.

My slow cooker is an old one and I should have used the HIGH setting as the original recipe said. Because of that, my corned beef was not as tender as it would have been. Other than that, it was delicious and I will make it again, using the high setting.

It was a "no-fuss" recipe and very tender.  Next time, I will definitely NOT add the beer.  It certainly gives it a different taste that I would have preferred not to have.

Used 12 oz of beer and subtracted some water. Cooked all day on low and vegetables (potatoes and carrots) were just right. Only thing was that on low cabbage could have used more cooking- we turned it up to high and cooked for an hour with meat out per suggestions, but still could have used more. 
Big plus: reheated beautifully!

I used to cook my corned beef, cabbage, and potatoes separately, but after trying this recipe, I'm never doing that again. This was much easier and the results were much better. I basically followed the recipe as written. I used 3 cups of water instead of four, omitted the beer, and cooked it on low instead of high.

Tried this recipe today for the first time. Followed another reviewers suggestion and omitted the beer and filled the crockpot up halfway with water. Let is cook for 6.5 hours on low. It was good. Vegetables weren't overcooked, meat wasn't tough. My 18 month old even ate it. I'd recommend this recipe.

I've been making CORNED BEEF for 45 years.........and this recipe is...........BY FAR....... the BEST  I've  EVER MADE.   I substituted 1 container of  Chicken Broth for the 4 cups of water and added the can  beer......"lite" was all I had.
I added the cabbage at 6 hours and cooked for 7 hours total using a 4 pound Point Cut corned beef.  It was SOOOOOOOO tender and juicy. The potatoes, whole carrots, onion, cabbage had outstanding flavors too.  I'll NEVER USE ANOTHER RECIPE  OTHER THAN THIS ONE AGAIN.

I did make this and loved it, with a few modifications.

- I did do it 8 hours on LOW rather than high
- I don't bother cutting up carrots for most recipes, so I just tossed in a bag of baby carrots and they were fine (they always are)
- I added some garlic, b/c I often add garlic to things
- Instead of water I used BEEF broth (chicken broth is mentioned as an alternative)
- I am not a beer drinker, so I can't really distinguish one brand from another, but someone mentioned not liking how the Guinness Stout affected the taste of the veggies. I keep Heineken on hand for stews, etc. and thought it was fine in this recipe.
- In the past I've had recipes say to put the meat on the bottom, I followed the directions and put the meat on top and thought it made for a better texture/consistency

Overall, I was pleased with how this came out!

This was the best corned beef recipe I've made.  The meat was so tender and fell apart.  I cooked 4 hours on high and 4 hours on low, combining other reviewers comments.  Will make this again for sure.

This is the only way to make corned beef and cabbage! I added extra mustard seed, caraway seed, coriander seed and red pepper flakes, as I had those on hand. It added a little extra flavor to the veggies :) I made the Horseradish and garlic spread from this site as another reviewer suggested and IT WAS PERFECT! Hubby now insists I make this complete meal more than once a year :)

Followed recipe almost to the letter. Only changes i made are as followes. I added 2 cans of Miller lite with water to make my 4 cups. Also didnt add the veggies till the 4 hour mark , so about midway through cooking. The meat was tender as butter the potato and carrots were tender. Also i cooked my cabbage in a seperate pan. My wife and kids loved it. Had a 6 lb. flat cut and not a single strand left over. Thanks, we will make this again!

I followed the top reviewers recommendations and she was right. This recipe doesn't need a lot to be good. I placed my baby yellow potatoes, baby carrots, and onion at the bottom of pot. Added the water, and I did add half can of chicken broth, added the flavor packet over the vegetables and placed the meat fat side up on top. I cooked 4 hours on high and about 5 on low (I had to leave the house so I wanted to make sure I didn't overcook). I took my meat out and wrapped in foil, added my cabbage and cooked 1 more hour on high. All the vegetables were perfectly done so was the meat. I also made an Irish soda brea . My husband said it was the best corned beef and cabbage he ever had:)
 I will definitely make this again. (Next time I'm going to add a bit of salt with the seasoning packet as we did add a bit of salt but we like salt, not everyone does)

Best corned beef I've ever made. I definitely cooked it on low (9 hours), and just covered the meat with water (no beer). Added the spice packet, cut an onion in half and wedged each half on either end of the meat to protect the ends from getting too over cooked. Added 4 stalks celery to the crock pot as well. Half an hour before it was done, I ladled half of the cooking liquid out into a pot on the stove. I added the potatoes and carrots to this liquid and brought it to a boil. After 10minutes, I placed a steamer basket containing the cabbage wedges over the potatoes and cooked everything in this pot for another 20 minutes.  Everything finished at the exact same time and was all perfectly cooked . Serve with soda bread and plenty of whole grain mustard.

Omgomgomg! I've been a cook x60 years, and 
I've made this meal for 40 years of our marriage.
This recipe is perfect for a new cook; so very easy and the end result is perfection in flavor, texture and taste.
I used 16 oz of beer and vegetable broth as the fluids, filling just up to the edge of the meat, (fat side up as it rested on the veggies) I added whole mushrooms, only because they were in the fridge and I thought would add flavor. NO SALT. On high for 8 hrs and cabbage added the last hour. It was divine and got rave reviews!

Excellent way to cook corned beef whether you make it while you are away, perhaps on low, or on a day when you are home and want results faster, on high.  

I think with any corned beef recipe, it is important to know your corned beef, or to be prepared to make a few adjustments well into the cooking process.  This recipe works very well for most corned beef but if you find some that is extra lean, larger, or with a large point attached, you may have to add cooking time or adjust the seasoning.

Excellent way to have one dish done all at once. I would cut down on the liquids next time since my crock pot is not that big and it was overflowing.  But the flavors of the vegetables came out very tasty.

Juiciest corned beef ever! Cook on low. Instead of mustard, try 3/4 sour cream, 1/4 horseradish, 1 tbs chives, and juice from 1/2 lemon.

This was the best corned beef recipe I've made! I also set my crock pot on low for 8 hours and the meat came out very tender. A few minor changes..I halved large potatoes before adding to the crock pot and they were perfect. I didn't add the carrots or cabbage to the crock pot. I cut the cabbage in eighths and carrots in half. After the 8 hours were up,  I placed these in a separate pot and steamed in them in the reserved juices from the crock pot for 15 minutes. everything was a perfect consistency and flavor.

This was wonderful.  As good as any corned beef I have ever ate.  Only change was added some minced garlic with the vegetables and a whole bottle of Guiness.  Cooked a while on high and turned down to low for the rest of the day.  I did cook the cabbage separately as the crock pot was pretty full.  A meat market butcher told me years ago to precook to remove the gluck.  Put beef in a dutch oven cover with water and boil for 10 minutes.  Rinse the beef and you have a nice clean piece of meat to put in the crock pot.  You can't believe that glucky stuff that comes off in that 10 minutes.

Only 4 stars because after reading the least positive reviews I decided to change a few things right away.
I didn't add beer. I don't like beer therefore I didn't have any available.
I covered the corned beef in water and then added: the spice packet, a garlic clove, carrots and celery.
I cooked in the slower for 10 hours on low. 
My corned beef came out perfect! The veggies were tender but not mushy. I drained away the melted fat and cooled the corned beef before slicing it. I didn't want cabbage but I had enough pot liquor to cook it in if I wanted.
One more thing.... I rinsed my corned beef in cold water BEFORE adding it to the slow cooker to avoid the extra salt.

This was fantastic.  I made it just as the recipe indicated.  

Tip:  After 8 hours of cooking, I removed the brisket to a platter and covered it with foil.  I placed 3 cabbage wedges (1/2 a cabbage) in the cooking liquid and cooked it on high 1 hour (along with potatoes and carrots).  I removed the cabbage (somewhat intact) with a slotted spoon and placed in  a serving bowl.  I would not have gotten the cabbage in the slow cooker with the brisket still in there, so this was the best option for me.  Also, I wanted to serve the items separately (especially the cabbage) because my kids were more likely to eat it that way.
Tip:  (I didn't do this, but will definitely do it next time, learning from experience) Cut the brisket needed for dinner, then refrigerate the remainder (in tact) overnight.  Thinly slice the COLD brisket for sandwiches.  It's hard to get the "deli" consistency when it's hot.

I made the mistake of following the recipe instead of following the comments. Cooked the corned beef, potatoes and onions (no carrots) on high and everything turned out complete mush. Except the meat. The meat cooked nicely. I might just use a stern look to turn these into mashed potatoes instead.

I started this on low because I was hesitant to cook it on high for 7 hours but I switched it to high after 2 hours because it was just getting warm. The shear volume of all the ingredients required the high setting for my slow cooker. The flavor was very good but the potatoes were over cooked and falling to pieces. And I didn't care for the matchstick carrots. They just did not add much texture or flavor. Next time I will use whole carrots cut into large bite sized chunks.

Cooked for 4 hrs. on "High" then 4 hrs. on "Low" . The beef was overcooked and the spuds & carrots were mushy. Next time, I would cook it  only on "low" and wait a couple of hours before adding the veggies.

Excellent and Easy! I followed the recipe to the T and it was perfect! I was concerned about cooking the veggies on high for 8 hours but did it anyway and they were perfect...not mushy at all. After 8 hours I removed the corned beef to make room for almost a whole head of cabbage. After 45 minutes I put the sliced corned beef back in the crockpot for 15 minutes to heat it and voilà dinner was served!

I just made this for the first time and it was so good that my husband asked me to throw away all the other recipes I have for corned beef and cabbage.  By far, this is the best recipe I have found!

Made this yesterday for St. Paddy's and it was delicious!  Everyone raved about it! I followed the recipe exactly except that I adjusted the cooking time as my slow cooker on high is really hot and I was worried about the meat being dry.  I cooked on high the first 5.5 hours and then turned to low fir about 2.5 hours longer.  Veryy moist and delicious and will definitely make again.   Thanks for a great recipe!

I bought my corned beef at Costco. It came with a seasoning packet. It also weighedv7 lbs. Because of that, after adding the carrots, potatoes, & onions to the pot, after adding the beef, the pot was full. The water & beer (I used Guinness) level came to the  top edge of the pot. Because of the large piece of meet, I cooked it on high for 8 hours. Not all the cabbage would fit, so some of the liquid was decanted into a pot, & cooked there   
The results were fantastic. The corned beef was moist, tender & full of flavor. 
Definitely a do over.

I would not change a thing. This was a hit for St. Patrick's Day.  Far better than other corned beef and cabbage dishes that were made.

Fantastic!!  I used about 4 lb corn beef flat cut and put in crock pot fat side up. I added 2 cups beef broth, 2 cups water, 1/2 stick (1/4 cup) salted butter (finely cubed and scattered around edges) and 3/4 cup Killians Irish red beer.  I then scattered the spice packet on top.  I cooked this at low for 3 hours, then removed meat and added 12 Yukon gold mini red potatoes quartered, 1/2 diced onion and 4 lg carrots peeled and cut into matchstick pieces.  I cooked on low for another 9 hours then lifted beef to the side and added 1/2 cabbage corsly chopped (lg pieces) under and cook another hour on med.   Total cook time around 12 to 13 hours on low.  I seved with buttered rolls and jam.  Thanks for a wonderful dish!

Absolutely amazing! Used a bottom round flat cut.  Layered red potatoes, carrots, corned beef, spices and used enough beef broth to just about cover all ingredients. Also used 7oz of corona beer and cooked for 10 hours on low. Added cabbage last hour. Be sure to remove meat and let it sit for about 30 mins before cutting.. Also be sure to cut meat across the grain.  Corned beef was amazingly tender and I would give this 10 stars if I could.

This is the best way to cook corned beef! The veggies sit on the bottom in the broth and the corned beef steams to perfection. I was afraid it would fall apart but I'm glad I trusted the recipe. I gave it 4 stars instead if 5 because I won't  put carrots in it next time. I made the corned beef slightly sweet.

The meat was great and I wanted to give it 4 stars, but in my experience 9 hours is way too long to cook vegetables. This last time I made it I put the veggies in at the 5 hour mark (4 hours to go), and they were still mushy. Also, way too much liquid.

Great!  I made exactly as written, so this is a review of THIS recipe and not my version of it.  I didn't put the beer in until half way through (because I didn't have any on hand) and when I did I had to take much of the liquid out before I added it...it was already boiling over.  I also had to reduce the liquid before I added the cabbage.  All veggies were cooked perfectly, and the meat fell apart.  The flavor was amazing (for corned beef)!!!

Made for St Patrick's Day work potluck and it was a total HIT! The only thing I feel I should mention is if you're looking to feed a large crowd, you'll need to double the amount of beef. The recipe states it feeds 8; however, I found after the meat cooked down it shrunk so much I could barely feed 4 with it. That aside, the only thing I changed was I used chicken broth instead of water. I also put the brisket fat side down, which I think enhanced the flavor in the veg. My coworkers couldn't stop commenting me on this!

This was excellent!  The only thing I changed was the cooking time of the vegetables.  I thought 8 hours on high would result in mushy veggies, so I let the brisket cook for 5 hours before adding the carrots, potatoes and onion.   Let them cook for two hours and then added the cabbage and cooked for another hour.  The meat was succulent and melt in your mouth tender.  The veggies were perfect.  Served it with Grandma McAndrews' Irish Soda Bread from this site.  The leftover brisket is destined for some Ruben sandwiches.

Easy and delicious! I did not add carrots because we don't like them.  I used only 1.5 cups water and the seasoning packet because that's what the corned beef package suggested.  I cooked 5 hours on HIGH then added the cabbage and cooked another hour on HIGH.  I'm not sure why people are so afraid to cook this on high?  There is plenty of liquid.

I did not use carrots or beer. Did use beef stock, some all spice & cooked on high for 10 hours. The beef is very tender and tasty. I will certainly try this again with the carrots & beer at some point but with my adjustments it was perfectly delicious.

Definitely to long on high. Here's what I did. I started the 3.88 lb. corned beef, beer, water , onion & spice pack at 8:15 on high.  At 1:15, I put in the carrots & potatoes & lowered to low. At 3:15, I went to put in the cabbage & found the potatoes & carrots already soft. The corned beef was done also. I just took them out & put in the cabbage on high. I'll give that an hour or less. Then I'll put everything back on warm until dinner at 5:15. Smells good!

Love this recipe!  I've used this one for years.  As someone else suggested, I use enough water to fill the crock pot 3/4 full (no beer).  And I cook it 8 hours on Low.  Near the end, I separately cook a whole head of cabbage using juices removed from the crock pot (plus enough water to cover the cabbage, if there isn't enough juice), until it's tender.  This meal comes out perfect every time.

This is a great base recipe, however I don't use any beer in mine and I'm allergic to onion. A fantastic option is before you but the brisket in the crock pot you sear the meat on all sides 2min each in butter to lock in the flavor and keep the meat together when your finally cutting it (because it will fall to pieces melt in your mouth) Otherwise this is a great one to use. I also don't cut up my potatoes or carrots. I use a large enough crock pot to accommodate them, and as others have mentioned I always put them in when I put the meat in.

Never been a gig fan of Guinness and used Stella Artois instead. I know, Irish Corned Beef and Belgian Beer? It went together REALLY GOOD.

Loved this! It was a great base. I did not use beer but did use a can of beef broth with it in the crock pot. I did potatoes, carrots, and onions with the beef the whole time and it was exquisite.

Was wonderful, cooked 6 hours on low, then 4 hours warm, was great by the time I got home.  I used beef broth instead of water.

I have used this recipe for the past 4 years on St. Patrick's day.  My mom is polish and loves cabbage so the first time I made this she asked how I was able to give the cabbage so much flavor.  I told her it was probably the beef  broth.   Make sure to use a large crock pot as it gets difficult trying to fit the cabbage during the last 30 min.

The meat was tender and juicy but there was too much fat in the vegetables and everything tasted the same. Next time I will remove most of the fat that comes on top of the corned beef and cook the potatoes on the side. This meal was also expensive. A 4.5 lb cut of meat cost about $25 and cooked down to just over 1.0 lb!

This was the best I have ever had. I modified it by adding 1 tbls of chopped garlic, 1 bay leaf, about 15 pepper corns, 5 beef bouillon cubes and I didn't want potatoes so didn't add them. I took some of the broth out to cook the cabbage on the stove and added water. I served it with 2 condiments, grey poupon mustard with horse radish to taste and creamy garlic horse radish that you can find on this site.

I cooked this as directed. Except that I cooked it in the slow cooker for 8 hours on low. The texture was not good so I cooked it on low for another 8 hours. After the second eight hours the texture was much much better and it was delicious ,so maybe the directions are correct in telling you to cook it on high for 8 hours. Next time I will cook it on high for 8 hours the first time.

Best corned beef and cabbage I've ever had and I love corned beef! My crock pot was not big enough to include the cabbage so I made it by steaming in a large pot right before digging in. I've made it several times and shared this recipe with family. There are never any left overs of this tender and flavorful corned beef.

Outstanding.  The corned beef just fell apart and dissolved in our mouths...I didn't add cabbage because I didn't think my toddlers would eat it, but they certainly enjoyed the corned beef and veggies!

Everyone loved the flavor of the sauce, even though we had no beer to put in it. The meat as tender and flavorful, and the potatoes, carrots, and cabbage were delicious.

Cook on high for two hours, then add the veggies (minus the cabbage until an hour before like the recipe states) then cook on low for four hours.

This recipe is perfection. Such flavor! The brisket I used came pre-corned with no spice packet, so based on other comments I added 2 bay leaves and a large smattering of coriander and mustard seeds on top of the meat. Used Killian's Irish Red beer. You do end up with lots of liquid at the end but it's so flavorful I didn't mind!

I've not had much luck in making corned beef and cabbage over the years, but at last this was the recipe that worked. Meat tender, veggies not cooked to mush. It got raves at our feast. I know my crock pot, so I did get the meat with liquid (no beer), spice pkt, a few peppercorns and a bay leaf and onions going first 4hrs. Then added potatoes and carrots and more onion for 3 and the cabbage last hr. But the high setting is important, do it, and you'll get a great result.

St. Patrick's Day has passed. This was dinner for today - 3 days after SP Day. After reading several of the reviews, I prepared this recipe last night and turned it on this a.m. I slightly precooked the potatoes and carrots in beef broth and poured them on top of the onion in the bottom of the crock. We didn't have any beer so, I used beef broth. I, also, used beef broth instead of water. Rather than cooking this on high the entire time, I started it at high for about 1 1/2 hrs. and cooked it on low for the remaining time. It did cook a total of 9 hrs. I added the cabbage and ended up cooking it on the stovetop (in juice from the pot) because it was still very crisp after 2 hrs. (We prefer our cabbage more soft.) By far, this is the best tasting corned beef we have ever tasted. The veggies were all seasoned perfectly, as well. This is a family hit and we will, most likely, begin having this dish more than once a year.  :-)

I had never made corned beef so I give it a 5 for how easy the recipe was to follow and for the corned beef being so moist and tender. The cabbage, potatoes and carrots seemed bland though and were too soft. My picky 3 year old did eat it but next time I'll try to add another packet of seasoning for my own tastes.

Great recipe and soo much simpler then the traditional technique of boiling for hours and finishing in the oven.  Thanks so much, this will now be my go to corned beef recipe which we have every month or two.  I added the potatoes in the beginning and the cabbage in the last hour when I got home from work.  Was awesome!!

I too would have changed the temp to low for 8hrs... I added my cabbage at the last 15-25 minutes, we prefer a little firmer veggies. Meat was sadly not as moist as should have been for a crockpot receipe.  But very flavorful!

I fixed this for St. Patrick's Day. I didn't have any beer (must have drank it all :l), so I used hard apple cider instead. It gave it a nice flavor.

I love this recipe! I first tried it last year for my boyfriend's birthday present. I tweaked it just a bit, and it turned out INCREDIBLE. I rinsed the meat first to keep it from being so salty. Instead of the beer I added a cup of (good quality, not cheap) orange juice and 3 tablespoons of brown sugar. Then I cooked it on low for 8 hours. I kept the rest of the recipe the same. Again, it was INCREDIBLE. I made a full pot. I got a bowl and so did my stepson. My boyfriend literally ate the whole rest of the pot by the end of the night. He begged me to make it again this year! I've also made it my same way with Guinness instead of OJ, and it was just as awesome. Just a different flavor. Really really tender. It is the best I've ever had, and I've eaten A LOT of corned beef and cabbage!

Tired of restaurant corned beef dinners on St. Patrick's Day.  Decided to stay in today and used this recipe.  Came out perfect.  The only changes I made were to put the cabbage in around the half way point and cooked 8 hours on low, and no beer, just water. I used a 2lb flat cut corned beef cut and it came out excellent.  Way better than a restaurant boiled dinner today!

Last year was my first time and I was scared so cooked it on low and it must've been good because I made it again this year ..... but got brave and cooked it on high and still very good!!  I used about 2 cups of water and a 12 oz can of Miller Lite.  I like my cabbage a little bit on the softer side so would've cooked it longer than an hour but other than that - perfect!!

This was fantastic. The only thing I changed was I added  the whole bottle of Guinness. It was 4am when I threw it in the crock pot and didn't feel like drinking or wasting the the other 6oz Guinness lol. The extra Guinness didn't hurt it at all and didn't make it taste like beer or ale. Just tenderized the meat. I'll definitely be printing out this recipe and adding it to my favorite recipe folder.

I've made this every year, and the only thing I had to omit was the onion due to my husbands onion allergy. Seems like a common persons dislike, but I will not go to any restaurant where they do not cater that well to allergies. Still tasted the same.

My first attempt at Corned Beeef & it was a hit!  I didn't want mushy veggies so I only added the onion & some garlic then the meat, then a whole can of beer (cuz it was too early to drink the other 6 oz), the water & spice packet.  I cooked it on low about 7 hrs, then switched to warm until we were ready to eat.  It made my house smell so good, was super tender and tasted great. I can't wait to make Reuben's with the leftovers.  I'll be making this again.

A good way to prepare corned beef.  The potatoes and carrots tasted amazing after cooking in the "broth" all day.  Not using the can of beer was my only alteration to the recipe.  This will be my go-to corned beef and cabbage recipe.

I didn't use the beer and pretty much followed everything else in the recipe, adding the cabbage with 1.5 hours left.  It was absolutely delicious!!! Didn't need the beer but I wouldn't mind trying it sometime. My 11 month old and 6 year old sons, as well as my husband and myself, totally loved it!  Plus it was so easy!!!  The meat melted in our mouths. So delicious!

Made this for St. Paddy's day supper.  After reading a few reviews I decided to add the veggies 4 hours into the cooking.  I lifted the beef out to add them and noticed it was VERY tender.  So at 5 hours I took the beef out and wrapped it in foil.  It was perfectly tender, but I got the feeling if I'd left it in for the full 8 hours we'd have had corned beef soup!

This recipe was excellent and easy to make.  My entire family enjoyed it... even the kids!  I added a bay leaf, celery, pepper and a few cloves of garlic.  Also, I turned the meat over halfway through the cook time.

The best Corned Beef I ever made.  Simply moist but would use the low setting and put the veggies in approximately 4 hrs in.  Otherwise they are quite mushy !!

3/18/2014:  Excellent corned beef recipe!  This was my first time making corned beef, and it turned out very well!  I didn't use any carrots, and instead of using beer, I used beef broth.  The potatoes definitely weren't mushy; everything was just right.  The meat wasn't fall-apart tender, but we don't like it too tender, so it was just right for us. Edited 3/16/2018:  For St. Pat's 2016 and 2017, I had a problem where the cabbage never finished cooking; not to mention that the slow cooker was always too full to fit everything, even in my big 7-quart.  I've started cooking the cabbage separately, but the corned beef and potatoes always turn out well.

We made ours with a Belgium wheat beer, corned beef, cabbage, portabella mushrooms, onions, carrots, garlic and broccoli. I ended up making the leftover drippings/liquid into gravy. 
Turned out really good!!

Really easy.  Put it in the crock pot St. Patrick's Day morning before leaving for work.  Pop in the veggies when you get home and enjoy a delicious dinner.  This will be our go-to recipe.  We did not bother with the beer.

Delicious. Made exactly as written, sans beer (forgot it).  The crock was so full I had to cook the cabbage on the stovetop with some of the liquid from the crock. 

Tip: I pulled the beef out to rest as I was finishing the cabbage and mixed a few spoonfuls of brown sugar with bottled mustard, slathered on the top, fatty side of the meat and then broiled it for a few minutes, resulting in a delicious crust. Everyone loved it!

POSITIVELY EXCELLENT!!!  I followed the recipe to a T... EXCEPT for this:  Per cook Debi's review I substituted low sodium chicken broth for the beer (I will for SURE try it with beer tho' - just didn't have one on hand!!).  I threw away the funky little spice packet that's packed in with the corned beef and used 2 T. of Penzey's "Corned Beef" spices.  Crock'd it on high for 7.5 hrs.   Last, I added the cabbage and gave it one more hour on high.  It was just sooooo wonderful!!  YUMMMM-OOOOO!!!!

If you like corned beef, this recipe is for you.I give the RECIPE 5 stars,recipe was easy and the meat came out very tender, I put the meat on early this am on low, just added water no beer and no seasonings except for the spice packet, noon added whole red spuds. Overall time was 9 hrs. However, my husband and I have never had corned beef before and didnt care for the taste/ texture of the meat. Nothing to do with the recipe. Never know til you try..

Great St Patrick Dinner. Cook on Low crock pot setting. Corned Beef Biscuit turned out perfect. By putting the cabbage in during the last hour, they did not cook enough. Next time I will put them in 2 hours before completion time.

Turned out Excellent, used Stone Brewery Smoked Porter, everything was delicious!   Also added Parsnips as well as carrots, with all the veggies being added for last two hours instead of under meat.  Turned out amazing

Have made this a few time now and every time everyone devours it.  Use onion and small red potatoes but no need to matchstick the carrots - use a bag of baby carrots and just put them in whole.  After pouring in an entire can/bottle of beer (whatever we have on hand but don't use a dark since it flavors the potatoes too much) I add water to top of meat.  Add the spices that come with meat.  I do cook it on HIGH for 8 hours and it comes out perfect - meat is falling apart and the vegetables are not mushy at all.  We cook the cabbage separately on the stove - will not fit in the slowcooker and I use a 6qt for this with a 3-4lb brisket.

This was delicious and very easy. I confess I used beef stock not beer as the liquid and added celery and an extra bay leaf or two. I would have liked the vegetables a little bit less mushy..I think I would add them in a bit later next time.

This was absolutely delicious! This is my only recipe I use for Corned Beef and Cabbage and comes out great every time! Like another reviewer said... the only liquid you need is about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of water to cover the corn beef. I always put my carrots and potatoes on the bottom and onion...and then my corn beef on top use spice pack that comes with it and then the water. I cook it all day... the last hour of cooking I add my cabbage... and usually serve with Irish Soda Bread... but any bread will do! Great recipe! Make it and you'll see!

I especially wanted to try this recipe because it calls for beer. I followed the instructions exactly and my corned beef fell apart. I was not able to cut it at all.

I will try again as I like the ease of the crockpot. Next time, I will try on low for 8 hours. I don't think I will put the veggies in in the beginning either. Too mushy.

Followed the recipe exactly as given. Cooked the beef 8 hours and then added the cabbage for another hour. The flavors were delicious.  The meat could be eaten with a fork but still was solid enough to be sliced easily for serving. The vegetables were thoroughly cooked but were not mushy with the potatoes still having form but being the consistency of mashed potatoes. The broth was delicious as a clear soup. An excellent recipe.

Followed advice of other users, cooked it on high for 8 hours, came out lovely, but next time I will definitely add only half a bottle of beer.

I followed this recipe completely and was a bit disappointed since I think a lot of flavor was lost in the corned beef from the long cooking ... I don't really know why, it was a bit tasteless to me and I doubt I'd do this again ... I have better success with stove top braising.  The veggies were OK, not superior.  Also, I did not get a "spice packet" with my corned beef, I never have!  Perhaps that is what was missing.

Delicious. The corned beef was very tender and had a great flavor. I used Trader Joe's 2012 Vintage Ale (I think they have it every year around Christmas) and it went great with the recipe. It was even complimentary to drink it while you ate!

This is the best corned beef and cabbage meal I have fixed in my 41 years of marriage.  This will be the recipe I use from now on. EVERYONE enjoyed this meal.

I followed the recipe, except for using beef stock instead of water.  Veges tasted great, and beef was good but after the 8 hours it wasn't fully cooked on the inside!  Next time I'll omit the veges except the onion to ensure the beef gets the full benefit of the heat.

Tried this over the weekend - followed the recept to the letter.  corned beef (flat gray) was tough, and the veggies tasted like vinagar and salt.  I really don't know what went wrong (really glad I didn't add the beer!!)  Going back to boiling my dinner!  It was sad........

My son drank the beer I was to use for the recipe so, I found a bottle of dry white cooking wine (24 oz) and reduced the water. I don't like cabbage, but in this recipe I loved it!
Can't wait until next St. Patrick's day!

Very moist brisket, would recommend.  I used baby carrots instead of matchstick.  I also only cooked on high for 2 hours and the remainder of the time on low.

Several weeks ago I made another highly rated recipe on this site that called for boiling the corned beef. Then I tried this one and, oh my, it is SO much tastier!!! I did everything the same except that I did add beef bouiloon/soup base to the water. I used Labatt's beer, if it matters. Excellent!!!!

I do the slowcooking thing too for corned beef but I cook it all in beef broth and throw in a tablespoon of McCormack's pickling spice.  The flavor is lovely and the meat gets a nice color, a rich red-brown. It melts in your mouth!

My grandmother wanted to try to make a corn beef for the first time and asked me to look up a recipe for it. I have never eaten corn beef. This recipe was Fantasitic!!!!. I would certainly eat it again. The corn Beef was tender and juicy and the cabage gave a wonderful contrast. The family loved it.

Delicious and simple.  I skipped the onions because they bother my husband's stomach and I would have had to pull them out for the kids anyways.  Six hours on high and 1.5 hours on low resulted in tender yet sliceable meat, which is what we prefer over fall apart.  I used an entire bottle of Guinness and substituted chicken stock for one of the 4 cups of water.  I quartered large red potatoes and used the biggest baby carrots I could find.  They were about as cooked as they could get without being mushy, so if you use small red potatoes I recommend keeping them whole.  Don't forget to smear each bite of finished corned beef with a bit of mustard.  Delicious.

This was the best corned beef and cabbage I have had in a very long time!  Loved the idea of adding the beer, I had a bottle of Guinness Draught. It added great flavor. I also added about 3 garlic cloves, which was a nice surprise in the vegetables.  -Skippy

Just finished dinner and thought I would rate it! First off I wanted to let everyone know that I followed the recipe to a t, didn't change anything. It turned out perfect, first time I've ever liked corned beef and cabbage. It couldn't have been easier to make. I had my doubts on having the slow cooker turned up on high for 8 hours, but carrots and potatoes turned out great!

I find the best spice to add when cooking corned beef and cabbage is Pickling Spice wrapped in cheesecloth (about 2 tablespoons). Makes the house smell so good and your meal will be delicious!!

I have never made corned beef and cabbage until today using this recipe!  I followed this recipe exactly as written (8hrs on high), i used leinenguagel beer and it was wonderful!!!  My children and I  loved it!!  The only change I would make is maybe adding the vegetables later or or taking them out earlier.  The potatoes were mushy but the rest were perfect!!!   My 11 year old son said the way this meal tasted made him want to learn to cook just so he can make it :). We will definitely be making again!!!

My first attempt at corned beef & cabbage and for a St. Pat's party no less.  Not only was it extremely easy--it was completely gone--not even a scrap of leftovers.  I was repeatedly told it was the BEST corned beef and cabbage anyone had ever had!!!  (better than their mother made!!) Thank you for this great recipe!!! I used Killian's for the stout.  Great, great recipe--I will use it often.

My slow cooker cooked this perfectly on high for 8 hrs.  3 cups of water would probably be enough, although 4 cups was fine.  I chopped the carrots into two inch pieces and they turned out great.  I will use this recipe from now on...

My hubby and I have never made a St. Patricks day dinner and wanted to go traditional with the corned beef and cabbage.  We were up late and decided to put everything in the slow cooker as suggested.  We got up this morning and have been picking at it and reminding each other that it was for dinner.(smile)  This is a great recipe. I will be making this again.  

As suggested I put the cabbage in the last hour of cooking and I added a whole scotch bonnet pepper, to add that additional kick of flavor, because we like our food a little spicy, but the flavor is what was the real benefit of the pepper not the heat. (so do not cut it open, just toss it in whole).Yum!  Thank you for sharing your recipe.  Great for first time cookers.

Well, I didn't have Guinness Stout, or any other beer available (I'm just not a beer drinker). So, I used 1/2 cup (4 oz) whiskey that I have. It turned out good. Although, a 4 lb brisket is too much for my slow cooker. I had to cut down the recipe.

Very good.  I doubled the vegetables and liquid.  I think next time the only change I will make is adding the vegetables halfway through cooking time so they aren't as mushy.

Cooked on low for 8 hours and put the meat and veg into the oven on warm in a casserole dish while I added the cabbage to the slow cooker on high for an hour and a half.  The cabbage was not cooked after that time so I transferred the broth and cabbage to a pot on the stove and boiled it another 10-15 minutes until it was cooked.

Yummy but my corned beef brisket didn't have a mythical seasoning packet (nor had I ever seen that) so I winged it with some peppercorns, bay leaves, and sliced garlic.  Maybe it was missing a little sans packet, but it wasn't perfect.

So glad I found this recipe.  I cooked on high for 3 hrs and then on low for 5, was fine.  Only used water as one reviewer said.  added cabbage towards the end.  DELICIOUS.

I made my corned beef from scratch in this recipe and had to modify the "slow cooker" aspect as my crock pot was too small.  I used a large stock pot and put it in the oven and cooked at 300 for 6 hours.  The meat fell apart and the veggies were tender and very tasty.

Easy. Clear instructions. Came out as expected. Veggies were not overcooked & beef was tender and moist. Needed a lot more seasoning; we may add beef bouillon paste to the leftover broth and call it "cabbage, potato & onion soup."

the spices and beer take away from the good taste of the corned beef. I've never had a "dry" corned beef anyway.  Think I'll just stick to the way grandma did it.

I made this is in the slow cooker yesterday. We had a neighbor drop by and my husband offered some to our neighbor and our neighbor liked it. I would make this again, but without the beer. My husband and I are not beer drinkers, so I had to go to the store and purchase a can of beer and most of it went down the drain. We didn't like the smell of the beer as it was cooking.

So good!  Will definitely do this again in the crock pot.   At the bottom of my pot was the carrots, but I omitted the onion and added parcnips and turnips.  The meat was super tender and everything was cooked well but not mushy.  Everyone loved it, including the kids!

I made this today and it came out amazing! Everyone loved it!  Did change it up just a tad with less water and more beer.  Also had pickle sliced style carrots and used them without any problems.  Will definately use again but with a bigger piece of meat for extra left overs!

I cooked 8 lbs of Corned Beef Brisket in a slow cooker for 8 hours on LOW. I added ONE can of beer as the only liquid and no veggies or potatoes. This is the BEST Corned Beef I have ever eaten, tender, moist and delicious. My family who is not normally fond of Corned Beef absolutely loved it. Made great hash for breakfast the next day.

The recipe was great.  I did alter slightly by; cooking on low, adding the potatoes 4 hours before ready, and that cabbage took about 1 1/2 hours.  Total tome was 8 1/2 hours.   Oh I sprinkled the cabbage with Mrs. Dash when I placed it in the crock pot.  Yummy !

The best all-in-one meal ever. We used a very lean brisket and it just fell apart. In a 5qt crock we cut the water back to 2 cups and added half a can of Murphey's Stout. Crock almost overflowed with liquid. So 2 cups is plenty. Awesome recipe. This will go in the family favs recipe binder. Thanks!

Excellent dinner approved by the half Irish hubby and kids (7 and 4). Cooked 8 hrs on LOW with beef broth instead of water.  Came out buttery and simply delicious.

OMG! Amazing! I never made corned beef and cabbage before. This was so good. I replaced the water with beef broth and added ground peppercorn. Put on high for the first hour and then on low. This is a keeper for me. The family loved it. oh the potatoes were very soft but I like it that way they were not mushy just very soft

Made this last Wed, came out deelish. I start out on high for one hour, then turn down to low. I put the veggies in at the beginning and they are not mushy in the end at all. The cabbage was added after 7hrs and it took an hour on low to finish. Great meal. I use regular Guinness not stout and it tastes wonderful. Enjoy! 
oh, made corned beef hash with leftovers

I'm so glad I didn't make my carrots matchstick size.  I only cut mine to 2 or 3 inch lengths.  They were still mush by the time we ate.  I asked my husband to start the slow cooker while I was at work and had no idea that it said to put this on HIGH for 8 hours.  Crazy!  Try the LOW setting and you might have some bite left in the vegetables.  I'm saving the recipe, though, because the corned beef was great, albeit falling apart.  Once cooled, I could slice it well.

AMAZING!!  I have never had any luck making corned beef and cabbage.  I made this recipe in a roaster in the oven on 250 for 6 hours then turned off the oven and let it finish cooking for 2 hours because my fiance wasn't home yet.  We LOVED it!

Made this last year, making 3 this year! Last year was the first time I used a crock pot...and in the 18 years i have been making corned beef it turned out the very best! I just use water and the seasoning packet and let the crock pot do the work.  The longer you let it simmer the better it will turn out.  Seems like at least 8 hours.  Also, I cook all my vegetables separate in a big pot of just water and a little salt and a few pats of butter.  YUMMY! Can't wait to eat dinner!

This meal was so easy to prepare.  We enjoyed the heck out of it on St. Pat's Day.  I will definitely make this again!

Very juicy and flavorful!  Other than a few whole cloves thrown in, the recipe tasted great as is.  This will be a regular dish for me each year.

Great starting point for Corned Beed and Cabbage.  Cooking in the slow cooker really made the difference over more traditional recipes.  Definately worth a try if you like Corned Beef.
