soooo good. just spicy enough, yet not too spicy. If you make the sauce ahead of time and refridgerate over night, the flavors become 5 times more rich and delish! then just heat up and add the mussels! all the mussels were gone in less than 5 minutes and everyone was raving.
I used 4 1/2 lb of mussels, and they just barely fit in the amount of sauce. will use 4lb next time.

Wicked good! Yes, I said it! We halved it and I was a whimp about putting 1/2 of each pepper, but next time I won't be a whimp. Make sure you have lots of bread for sopping!!! THANK YOU!

I made this recipe for Valentine's Day and both me & my husband loved it.  I didn't have the red chili pepper so I used a couple of pinches of red pepper flakes instead.  It was perfect.  Will make again - thanks for the recipe.

I made this recipe for one of the seven fishes on Christmas Eve.  Came out very good!  I made 15 pounds of Mussels and adjusted the recipe accordingly.  I made the "broth" in the morning, then that night I brought it to a boil and threw in the mussels. Served on it's own,with bread for dunking.  Wish I had a picture of my Dad and Uncles at the table with this huge bowl of Mussels. They were just eating away! Nobody gave up their seat for nieces or nephews!! Flavor and ease is part of a 5 star rating, but you also have to factor in how other people like it..and when there is NO leftovers that's an automatic 5!!

Excellent!
I used the base recipe...green onion instead of shallots, pure beef drippings, chili pepper flakes and heavy cream.
Served mussels with filet mignon...what a combination.
Excellent recipe!

This recipe tastes A LOT like the Chicken Milano from this site. The only difference is the fresh tomatoes rather than sun dried tomatoes. I didn't care for that recipe, I think it was the sun dried tomatoes. I followed the recipe only adding shrimp along with the mussels. It was all right, but I won't make it again.

Okay, you have to keep in mind I found out that mussels were on sale at the local market today, our cat has been complaining so my husband made a mussel run, with a grocery list in hand.  Bad news was its Sunday so no white wine. 
Nevertheless this was incredible.  My husband couldn't stop raving about it!  He likes to use bread for the liquor so I didn't cook pasta.  Next time I will, the sauce is nice and rice and would coat the pasta to perfection.  In fact my husband decided to stop, save the sauce and get more mussels for tomorrow night.

This was a hit with my family for our St. Valentine's Day dinner last night.  Only adaptations I made were to use canned diced tomatoes (drained) I used red pepper flakes, and I made the sauce the night before.  Will be added to our regular rotation!

I am not a stickler for amounts and did add a little more or less than was called for.  Also I forgot to add the cornstarch and cream - oops.  Simmered the broth for an hour or so (the broth alone would make an amazing soup) before adding the mussels.  My husband loved it as did I.  Served with a green salad (including avacado and oranges) and a whole wheat bagette.  Easy & fabulous.

Delicious!! Really brings out the flavor of mussels. I did make a few changes. I used canned jalapeno pepper, red pepper flakes (instead of red chili), added 1 Bay leaf, a sprinkle of chili pepper and black pepper, and rice cooking wine.

These mussels really were amazing. I didn't plan to make this specific recipe, so I had to sub a few things based on what I had one hand. I replaced the shallots with onions, the fresh tomatoes with canned diced tomatoes and used red pepper flakes instead of the chili pepper. They were delicious, but I'm sure they would have been even better using the proper ingredients (as most of my replacements were downgrades). Next time I'm going to plan ahead and make exactly as written.

The flavor in this recipe is truly unique and amazing. Due to the lack of basil I substituted the basil with cilantro and tarragon.I would recommend cutting back on the broth and wine mine came out a little thin. overall the best muscles I have ever made.

These mussels are so delicious! I used onion in place of the shallots, red pepper flakes for the red chili pepper, 3 tomatoes, and milk in place of the cream. I used 3 pounds of mussels and threw in a pound of shrimp I had on hand. Even with just 4 pounds of seafood, I think I would double the sauce next time. Great recipe!

I made this last week for my boyfriend and I.  I scaled down to 2 lbs of mussels, and cut the sauce ingredients in half, as people seemed to think the sauce was really only enough for about 4 lbs of mussels.  It was really good!  The boyfriend doesn't really eat shellfish, but he cleaned his plate and went back for seconds!  The only thing I would change, is I think that you could cut the amount of beef broth added in half.  It seemed maybe a tad watered down, but still awesome! There was a lot of extra broth after we were done, so I used it to make a soup!  Didn't want it to go to waste  ;)

This was my first attempt at making mussels. It was very easy to make, and had a good flavor. Dipping the bread into the sauce was the best.

These really are Amazing Mussels!
The broth is so tasty! We all loved this recipe. It wasn’t spicy for us at all just very flavourful.  8 lbs of mussels and 3 baguettes later and some nice white wine.  We were all stuffed!   This Recipe is a keeper!

I felt the sauce was just ok. Maybe I should have waited to eat it the next day as one reviewer said the flavor was more pronounced the following day.

I will need to tweak the recipe a bit.  I would like more garlic and a touch more salt.  I will probably use a couple table spoons of soy sauce to increase the salt.  All in all this is an awesome recipe.

first time making muscles. This recipe was very easy to follow and absolutely delicious I made it for my family and my aunt and uncle and they all devoured every last one. My 8 year old just LOVED them. I did double the recipe because I had 12 pounds of mussels (Costco special, lol) the only thing I substituted was I used two cans of Italian flavored tomatoes, instead of fresh tomatoes.

My soulmate and I enjoyed a New Years eve mussel meal extraordinaire!

Served up with and cooked in Orvieto Classico from a BC Liquor store, filone and cheeses from a local grocer ... commenced 2016 fully satiated.

This recipe was wonderful. The flavors were great and the heat was great. Next time I am going to use the excess broth as a sauce and put it on some pasta. I will definitely be making this again

Excellent mussels!  Used a large can (900ml) of tomatoes instead and it turned out great.

I made these Mussels and EVERYONE loved them.  Even people who don't normally like to eat mussels were raving about these.  

Very good with just the right spice.  I highly recommend this recipe.
