They're great!  
I didn't have all the ingredients, so I substituted the shortening for coconut oil, replaced the chocolate chips with  dark chocolate hazelnut bar, accidentally added some baking powder (lol), and a few extra oats.
**Ooh, also, I did rounded dtsp, and it made waaay more than 36 cookies. :)

These were by far the best boobie cookies I have made and my sister in law just asked me to make her another batch. She even gave some to a friend of hers so now I have to make more, lucky me. I even ate one to try and I am not breastfeeding, it was so yummy. And it made way more cookies then what it says for one batch

I made these for my daughter-in-law and out of the three types of lactation cookies I’ve made - these are the best. We kept some for ourselves. I didn’t have, nor did I know, if she liked nuts so I didn’t use them. Recipe was great as is. I kept water out in the beginning to see if too runny but ½ cup of water was perfect. I also liked it didn’t use as much brewers yeast like the other recipes.  It seemed to leave an aftertaste.

I don't use walnuts,  so the batter is very thin like cake batter.  I use another 2 cups of flour and bake as directed.  They're super yummy!!

I made a few alterations. I used almond extract instead of vanilla, and sense im diabetic i used truvia baking sugar and Hershey kitchen sugar free chocolate chips. Those are so good and do not taste sugar free. I love these cookies. I used the teaspoon to make the cookies. I probably used about 2tsp of mix per cookie. I ate a good 10-15 while cooking them and still had 45+ cookies
