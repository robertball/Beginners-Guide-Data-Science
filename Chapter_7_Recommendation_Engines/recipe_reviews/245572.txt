I made these to thank  a neighbor who shoveled my driveway. My husband tasted one and proclaimed them too fabulous to give away! They truly are worthy to make again and again—they are crunchy on the outside and a tiny bit soft in the center, and BRIMMING with chocolate and hazelnut flavor!  And yes, I did still give them away—-I now owe the next batch to my husband!  (The neighbors loved them, too!)

Delicious!!!  I doubled the recipe and had no trouble with that.  Instead of the dark chocolate bar, I melted semi-sweet chips instead as that's what I had...taste is excellent.   I added about 1/2 cup of dried dark cherries into the mix and they are good, but not overwhelming.

Really delicious. I added the espresso powder and next time I'm not sure I would. I think it detracted from the chocolate-ness I was hoping for... it was chocolately, but I wanted more!
