This was an average recipe. I found the alcoholic taste a little overwhelming, and it wasn't very thick, even though I used about 7 scoops. Not something I would make again, but it did the trick to cool me down.

Tasty. I skipped the milk because I like my shakes a little thicker. Very creamy.

This recipe was seriously about a 2 before I tweaked it. I used Breyers 1/2 the fat creamy vanilla. I don't have an ice cream scoop so I measured it out with a food portion scoop I got at Sam's Club. I used 1/2 the amount of liqueur of both suggested and it was still plenty strong. It looked like a thick milk, so I added 6 ice cubes to make it truly frothy. It would have also looked plain, so I added lite whipped cream on top and a ground almond to each cup. I will make this again with the tweaks. With the tweaks it was a 5 star drink. Ty for the idea I love toasted almond frozen drinks.

I too am a big fan of the Toasted Almond and found this recipe to be a wonderful twist on a great drink.  One tip though, you may have to play around a little bit with the amounts of each ingredient.  I like the alcohol taste to be a little more subtle and the shake to be a bit thicker so I lessen the amount of milk and alcohol, but you may be different.  Try it, you are sure to like it.
