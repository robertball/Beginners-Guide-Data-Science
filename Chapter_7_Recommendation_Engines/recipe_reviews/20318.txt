Great recipe!  My garden produced an overabundance of rhubarb this year.  Usually, I make strawberry rhubarb pie and strawberry rhubarb jam, but I had an angel food cake on hand and decided on the rhubarb sauce.  After reading the reviews, I decided to use a cup of bing cherries I also had on hand and a dash of red food coloring; I also added a bit of vanilla extract.  My mother used to make Rhubarb Sauce every summer, and it brought back memories.  I'm going to freeze the extra sauce for use throughout the year.

Because of the previous reviewers' suggestion, I also put a squirt of vanilla in at the end.  In addition, I used 1/3 cup brown sugar instead of the white, and added a dash of cinnamon.  I also have made this substituting a cup of frozen cranberries for a cup of the rhubarb.  Yummmm!!!!!

Yummy!  Can be made with less butter and sugar for the health-concious:)  Also don't worry too much about cutting the rhubarb - it will just boil down:)

AWESOME!!!!! I haven't had rhubarb sauce since I was a kid and boy does this taste great.  My son is in love with this sauce.  The only change I made was I added a little more sugar and when it was done cooking, I added a little vanilla.  Great recipe.

I used 3 cups rhubarb and 1 cup frozen strawberries and it was delicious.  Just like my gramdma used to make.  I like it over ice cream or spread over toast the best! I also foungd it easiest to just toss the rhubarb and strawberries along with the melted buter and sugar into the blender for a spin to get the smooth texture.  Thanks for posting.

I made this but would have preferred it be sweeter.  I will add strawberries next time.  Also, I took the advice given about not cutting fine because it will cook down.  I cut to 2-inch pieces.  Yes, it does cook down, but then it is more stringy, so I will chop it more fine next time. Just thought I'd share this for others.

This is really easy to make and I added strawberries too--I meant to serve it with yogurt or over ice cream but ended up spreading a lot on toast and it was really good!

I added vanilla at the end of cooking as suggested by other reviews... vanilla makes any dessert sauce better!  A delicious (and quick!) spring dessert served over angel food cake with a whipped cream garnish...

This recipe is very tasty and so easy!  I also used 3 cups rhubarb and one cup frozen strawberries. Then reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup.  I used an immersion blender to make the mixture nice and smooth.

The amount of sugar is about right, but I note that you don't need the butter, just cover the bottom of the pan with water, bring to a boil then cover and lower to a simmer for about 15-20 minutes. No need to stir.

SKIP THE BUTTER YOU DON'T NEED IT!  Used a little more than 4 cups rhubarb, and substituted splenda for the sugar (cut the calories down by like 800 or 900 calories!) Added one big container or raspberries and one of blackberries.  Followed others and added a bit of vanilla at the end, and some red food coloring.  SO GOOD!

I like the addition of butter in this recipe.  Four cups of rhubarb is about 6 good-sized stalks.  Slice fresh rhubarb quickly and easily with a Mandoline Slicer.  Can also be cooked in a solar oven.

Delish!

I probably had more rhubarb than the recipe called for -- in fact, I doubled the recipe, at the very least, and doubled the ingredients, but believe I had quite a bit more than twice the rhubarb.  Anyway, it is very tart and very delicious.  A great way for a single person to use up her rhubarb instead of a fattening pie.  

I also made homemade granola and so for breakfast I had the sauce with granola.  Tomorrow, going to pick up some vanilla low fat yogurt and make parfaits!

I was going to make a rhubarb pie for an elderly couple I take care of, however I discovered I only had brown sugar, and not enough butter! This recipe came to the rescue. It's SO good! Since it takes only a few minutes, I plan to make it often. I did add a bit of cinnamon and a touch of vanilla at the end, as suggested by others. To get a nice blush, I would have preferred to use berries, but didn't have any on hand. I "cheated" with red sugar from my cookie-decorating supplies. Just a few shakes, and the sauce blushed up nicely. Great, simple, tasty recipe!

I loved this basic recipe. I added a 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/8 of a cup of orange jucie and simmered until thick. Everyone loved it.

When I was young my aunt made delicious rhubarb jam.  I haven't had any for about 30 years so I bought some frozen rhubarb yesterday and found this recipe to try.  I love it!  Next I'm going to try it with fresh rhubarb, which I'm sure will be even better.  Thank you for such a simple, delicious recipe.

Unlike other reviewers I didn't change a thing and it was PERFECT.  Tart and tangy.  And ideal with plain yogurt.

8 cups of  2. Inch cut rhubarb
1/2 cup white sugar (yes for the 8 cups)
1/2 cut and scraped vanilla bean and bean.
1/2 cup unsalted butter.
I put it all in a big pot together and cooked over med-high heat for 12  minutes!

This was exactly what I was looking for,  my husband just wanted rhubarb.  Put over a little ice cream and it was GREAT.  Didn't serve 8 as it claimed, just enough for a couple nights dessert for the two of us.  Or maybe we were just being piggy.

I left out the butter, cooked down the rhubarb in a small bit of water. I made a bit bigger portion, 2.2lbs of rhubarb, 3/4 cup sugar.  Very nice. Thanks!

Like rhubarb but rarely cook it due to need of lots of sugar.  With this recipe you can fell almost guilt free if you don't think about the butter. I will discontinue giving away rhubarb from my garden!

This was really good.  Instead of butter, I just boiled a little water before adding the rhubarb!  We ate this on icecream and toast and it is delicious!  What is so great about it is that it's not too sweet!

This is so delicious I could eat it by itself. But it's amazing over ice cream too. I followed the recipe except added some vanilla. Fantastic!

Holy Sour, Batman! and no butter- rhubarb sauce doesn't have butter.  Added food coloring as my mother always did and doctored it with more sugar.

Substituted 1/2 of the rhubarb with frozen strawberries (because I was short on rhubarb).  Delicious recipe.  So good, I was cleaning out the skillet with a piece of bread.

I randomly made this for a big waffle brunch we were hosting. We had over 40 people and many of them raved about the rhubarb "paste." I agree it was good!

This was wonderful! I rated it only 4 stars because I made several changes. I used a heaping 1/3 cup brown sugar and added some cinnamon and vanilla at the end. I also added some red food color since my rhubarb was pretty green. Delicious on angel food cake with whipped cream.

This sauce was wonderful.  My husband really loved it.  It is great on homemade biscuits, toast or pound cake.  I also substituted a cup of cranberries for the rhubard and added a splash of vanilla at the end of cooking.

Have made for years tried less butter and added a little water, vanilla,  sugar, and cinnamon red hots (imperials). That way the candy gave the red color without using red food coloring.  Very good!

I had never EVER cooked rhubarb before...but it was always in the house when I was growing up.  I'm not a huge fan, so I grated up a few gala apples (peel on) and what a lovely sweet/tart sauce!  Thanks!

I goofed it up and it still worked!  I'm generally pretty good at reading directions, but I threw everything in the pot and then read them!  It's ok, the rhubarb softened up and disintegrated as it was supposed to.  I love almond, so I threw a bit of almond extract in there.  Also, it makes it more appetizing if you throw a couple of drops of red food coloring in.  Delicious!

We used 1 cup white sugar for every 8 cups of diced rhubarb, (we used a total of 16 cups of rhubarb) Then added 4 tablespoons of unsalted butter, 1 tablespoon cinnamon & 1 tablespoon of vanilla. Cooked the rhubarb down to sauce, then added 6 cups of blueberries to simmer in the sauce.  Everyone enjoyed this version of the sauce.  Note:  some might like to have their's sweeter tasting with the blueberries added.

As our family likes sauce to be pourable, I added 2T water per 4 cups rhubarb. Also added a splash of vanilla. Don't skimp on the butter...it makes it more sauce like. Great recipe! Just like my grandma used to make! Thanks!

I used this as a starting point.  Skipped the butter.  Used about 5 cups rhubarb, Splenda instead of sugar, and  a scant 1/2 C. water.  Simmered in a saucepan until all rhubarb was sauce consistency.   A real winner the way I made it.  Going to eat it as is, and top plain yogurt and oatmeal with the rest.  Will be making more tomorrow as it won't last!!!

SOOO good! I added about a cup of frozen cherries, used brown sugar instead of white, added a good pinch of cinnamon, and  about a a teaspoon of vanilla as it was cooling.  My son loved it on toast and I loved it with plain Greek yogurt.

Just made 2 batches.  Wonderful.  You could leave the butter out. But, usually it helps to eliminate the foam you get from cooking it down. so, I only used maybe a couple of teaspoons.  Was a nice consistency and flavor is super.
