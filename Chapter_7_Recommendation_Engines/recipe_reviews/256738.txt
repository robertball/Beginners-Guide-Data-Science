O M G these were so so good.  My husband couldn't quit raving about them and will definitely make them again.  If you have left overs you can put them in the toaster and they are like they are hot off the griddle. YUM

I made one change to the cooking procedure. Rather than cooking the pancakes with the syrup, I topped them off with the syrup. Very good.

I made these for the first time. They were delicious. Turned out way better than expected. They are thinner than regular pancakes but moister. I substituted a sugar alternative for the syrup. After reading previous reviews, I let the griddle heat up a while at a lower temperature. That was the key. At that point they did not take long to be ready. I made smaller pancakes and used a smaller rubber spatula to flip. The key to flipping them is letting the batter bubble up; that is when you know they are ready to be flipped.

love it, but needed some high altitude and me to friendly edits

first I added 1/8 cup butter to better before mixing. (make sure cream cheese is room temp) 

also I cooked bacon in the pan before hand and found that oil helps it retain the shape and thickness of a normal pancake. heat olive oil and or bacon grease before cooking.

My diabetic husband raved! I left out the maple syrup and used Almond flour instead of coconut because it’s what I had on hand. I served them with blueberry compote (made with Splenda) and a spoonful of sour cream sweetened with a bit of Splenda and a dash of vanilla extract. He’s in heaven!

These are so wonderful for a diabetic person like me.  I added a little more coconut flour to each batch I cooked, but I couldnt tell that they got any thicker.  Oh well.  They are very yummy.  And easy to make.

Really good alternative! I used vanilla creme Stevia sweet drops instead of the maple syrup and put butter and more cinnamon on top after they were done. Nice to know my insulin will not be spiking like crazy after I eat them! I will definitely make these again. Thank you!

I enjoyed these crepes. I must do gluten free and cow's milk free so I substituted fresh goat cheese for the cream cheese. My husband liked these too. With goat cheese you must be sure you have a mild tasting cheese. Preheating the griddle made these very easy to flip.

They came out pretty good. I stayed with the recipe and used a cast iron pan.
Would definitely recommend this and make it again.

These are really good! My husband is diabetic and he loved them. They are so full of protein and kept him full until way after lunchtime. Tastes just like crepes!

I did not like them at all. They are nothing like crepes or pancakes. Sorry but won't make them again.

These are so good!  I was pleasantly surprised!  I did not add the syrup in the batter.  I used for topping.  I have made them 3 days in a row!

Pretty good, nice texture and taste.  I had no cream cheese, used sour cream instead, it was fine.  I also used about five times the amount of coconut flour, surely  that was not the right amount?

I beat the egg whites as someone mentioned, used a tablespoon of swerve in place of the maple syrup and added a teaspoon of vanilla  and a tablespoon of butter to make them keto friendly. They were the best pancake like I've had a little eggy but much better textured than premade mixes.
