This is a wonderful pie filling recipe. The trick to the syrup is put your sugar and spices in 8 or 8 1/2 cups of hot water; stir till dissolved and place over low heat. Then mix 2 cups water 3 TBS lemon juice and corn starch and set aside. After you have the apples sliced and packed in the jars bring the sugar mixture almost to boiling stir in your cornstarch mixture and pour it into the sugar mixture. Stir or wisk mixture quickly. When the white of the cornstarch disappears, laddle over sliced apples. I use 3 tsp cinnamon and Florida Crystals unprocessed sugar. I also leave off the food coloring. It makes 9 quarts every time for me, but I pack the apples within 1 inch of the top. I have made 54 quarts already this year. Most to give as Christmas gifts.

The recipe was excellent. It was very easy. My only suggestion would be that when you use a knife to get rid of the air bubbles, use a plastic one or spatula. The first time I used a metal butter knife and 2 of my jars busted during processing. I checked the Ball website and they said that using a metal utensil to remove air bubbles may cause the jar to break.

This is the same recipe my mom used to use when I was a kid and we loved it.  I was in the search for this recipe when my mom found the original book and lent it to me.  Here are a few helpful things the original book had to offer.  Pack the apples (raw) leaving 1 inch headspace.  Fill with hot syrup leaving Â½ inch headspace.  Process in boiling water bath (pints) 15 minutes; (quarts) 20 minutes.  Makes 6 quarts.  Before serving: Prepare pastry for a 2-crust 8-or 9-inch pie.  Line pie plate with pastry; add 1 quart apple pie filling.  Adjust top crust, cutting slits for escape of steam; seal.  Bake at 400 degrees for 50 minutes.

This is excellent.  For us, one batch of syrup made 6 quarts of pie filling.  We left the 1/2" of headspace as it said, but the filling expanded & oozed out of the jars. Obviously they didn't seal.  We repacked & reprocessed leaving 1" of headspace with great results.  As most other reviews on this recipe suggested, we kicked up the spices (1 T + 1t. cinnamon, 1/2 t. nutmeg, 1/4 t. clove, 1/4 t. allspice).  We left out the food coloring.  The kitchen smelled fabulous, the jars were beautiful, the taste was delish.  We used Jonathans this time, but will try Granny Smith in a few weeks when they're ready at the local orchard.  I'm sure we'll be making this recipe again & again.

Cornstarch is not safe to add to canned items. You must use Clear Jel, a modified starch that is safe for canning. Cornstarch doesn't allow for consistant heat penentration that is needed for safe canning. Look it up in a modern Ball book.

Several of you mentioned that this pie was bland or needed more spices. That could be because you are using the wrong kind of apples. You must use a crisp, tart pie apple such as jonagold, empire, pink lady, rome, macintosh to attain proper flavor. Never use Red Delicious, it is strictly and eating apple.

This is a great way to use up extra (and non-extra) apples. I found that 6 1/4 lb. apples and 1 1/4 recipes of the syrup filled my 7 quart jars...I may have needed the extra syrup because I left it simmering the whole time I was preparing the apples. I used Jonathan apples and did not peel them, which cut down on prep time. I also used just slightly more spice than the recipe calls for; you can always add more when you go to make the actual pie. Also, when packing the jars, I found it easier to do layers of apples & syrup, rather than adding all the syrup at the end...it was too thick to seep down the sides without leaving big air pockets.

I just made this recipe today. I am a beginner canner, but found it very simple and precise! I haven't made a pie with it yet, but I did taste test the syrup and it was soooo yummy! I must admit, I exchanged 1 cup of the granulated sugar for brown sugar and added 1/8 tsp. cloves, 1 extra tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. extra nutmeg and 1/4 of a tsp. of allspice. (I like my apple pies kinda spicey.) I plan to give it out as Christmas gifts this year along with the dry ingredients for making apple crisp. GREAT RECIPE!!!

My aunt gave me some apples (more than I could eat before having them go bad) and found this recipe so I decided to try it. I dont have a canner so I used a big pot like I do when I make jelly. I only had 4 lbs of apples so I used the custom feature to scale this recipe down. I took other suggestions and used part brown sugar and increased the cinnamon and used pumpkin pie spice. *My question is...are the apples supposed to still be "crisp" when you open the jar?  When I sampled the next day they were just as crisp and fresh tasting as they were when I filled the jars. I have only made canned jelly and not sure what the texture is supposed to be on this recipe. Nonetheless they do taste great!

Great recipe.  Took the advice of other cooks--I doubled the cinnamon and nutmeg; also added 1/4 tsp. ginger and cloves.  Instead of using the lemon juice in the syrup; I used it when I was preparing the apples to keep them from turning brown.  I also had a little difficulty with the lids not sealing, but this has nothing to do with the recipe.  Just remember to leave headspace in the jar.  The volume in the jar will actually increase as the apples cook and release their liquid when in the water bath, if you have no room the lids will not seal.
UPDATE:  11/9/09--I have used this apple pie filling in an apple pie and also apple crisp--very good fresh flavor!  For those of you who are skeptics about using corn starch in a canning recipe in that it would somehow alter the ph level==have no fear, just follow  standard canning protocol by using sterilized jars and processing as long as the recipe indicates; you will have no problems.

Excellent recipe! I am a first time canner and found it so simple to follow. I made this recipe during apple season and have used the apples all winter. I haven't made a pie from it but my family loves it on pancakes, french toast and ice cream. Have served it for breakfast to overnight guest and they always ask for a jar to bring home.

I would have given this 5 stars but it uses cornstarch and I prefer using something called Clear Jel it can be purchased on the Internet give it a try it is far superior in the looks and texture also it holds up better than the cornstarch. The apples will still be crisp when you open the jar but leave the jars sit a few months before opening them they have better flavor the longer it sits the better it tastes. I add additional cinnamon and some pumpkin pie spice to mine and I do not use the nutmeg since it's not my favorite spice. I quart works nicely for a pie or for an 8x8 pan of apple crisp. I always use 1 inch of head space for this because otherwise it will boil over on you and the jars won't want to seal properly.

I made this last fall and we just used the last jar. It was delicious! However, the longer it sat, the more gelled it got. I will use less corn starch next time, but I can't wait to make it again. All you have to do to make the best dessert at any gathering you take this to, is open the jar and put it in a pan. Bake at 375 for 30 minutes with this topping: mix together a stick of melted butter, a cup of oats, a cup of all purpose flour, and a cup of brown sugar. Delicious! Also, a tip: take the screw lid off the jar and wipe the rings down before replacing it for storage.

Amazing! My whole family loves it. My husband asked me to do more, I had done 21 already. Do be careful not to fill the jars too full. A friend shared a similar recipe with me and it said fill jar 3/4 full. I have found you can put a little more than that but not much. I always have a little bit of the syrup left over so I made a pie using it and fresh apples. Like others I added 1 Tbsp of cinnamon and about 1-2 tsp of nutmeg.  1 jar will make a 9" deep dish pie, so maybe I pack my apples tighter than most. 1 reviewer wrote to boil the 8 cups of water with everything but the lemon juice and cornstarch. Mix the other 2 cups of water w/ the cornstarch and lemon juice. When the sugar mixture is boiling add the cornstarch mixture until you no longer see the white of the cornstarch. I did the last batch this way and it was thicker than the others. I am not sure if the extra step is worth it but if your syrup is not thick enough try it this way.  1 reviewer said do not use Red Delicious. That is the kind of tree we have so that is what I used. We all loved it. I guess it is a personal choice but do not shy away from using Red Delicious. Thanks for a GREAT recipe and all the tips from other reviewers.

Second season using this. Been canning over 30 years.
I like the recipe as written but this year I did add 1/8 tsp ground cloves.

The apples have to be packed tight to get 7 quarts. to reduce bubbles, I first add about 1/2 cup syrup, fill jar half full of apples, add another 1/2 cup syrup and finish filling. 

As far as the starch debate; I use a quality name brand corn starch and have had no problems with either breakdown of the syrup, taste, or spoilage. The USDA's mandate is to promote the "best" practice, even if second best has been used for decades. If you have the ability to use clear-jel, great! Do so. It is simply a different form of the same corn starch I use, and home canners have used for decades. Like any recipe for preservation, if you follow the instructions and measure accurately...you should have no problem.

Cornstarch is no longer considered safe for canning by the USDA. Additionally it calls for food coloring which will not hold up over time.  The processing time for quarts should be 25 minutes. This time comes from 3 safe to can pie filling recipes.  Please use a recipe that call for Clear Jel which is a modified corn starh that the USDA has tested ad found to be safe for canning.

I made two batches of this today -- 14 quarts.  Wide mouth jars made it much easier.  I used 8 1/2 cups of water like many suggested and found that I had about 1 to 1.5 cups of leftover syrup which was a relief!!!  PACK THE APPLES TIGHTLY into the jars, otherwise you end up with half a jar of floating apples and half a jar of syrup.  Cram em' in!  I left out the nutmeg as I'm not a big fan of it in my apple pie.  Also left out the food coloring.  Really fun recipe to make, and you really feel like you've accomplished something when you're done!  I gave it 5 stars for the simplicity of the recipe and steps.  Will make a pie this winter and evaluate taste then!

Great idea for canned apples, not sure how many pounds were used but I got eight 2 quart jars. I changed the sauce to my personal taste-1T cmon + 2 cmon sticks in the pot until sauce thickened, 1T nutmeg, 1T ginger, 1T allspice, 1t salt. This would go into the pies anyway so I added it now.  I did not add the food coloring, and used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 br sugar, personal preference that apples need br sugar. Thanks for the recipe, even though I altered it, it was a great starting place for me.

I made a batch of this with fresh local organic apples in Sept., and we have used two jars so far.  One qt jar = 1 regular/shallow 9" pie for us.  So far, our favorite method is to bake the pie crust for about 5 minutes unfilled (with holes pricked in it) at 425 F then pour the filling in (I crumble a little extra pie crust over the top - tastes great and looks pretty, but less work than building a lattice or doing a top crust) and reduce the temperature to 350 F and bake for about 45 min.  This is such a huge hit with my husband and 5 year old that a whole pie can disappear in less than 24 hours.  I am really glad I tried this recipe!!

The only changes I made to the original recipe were to omit the food coloring (yuck) and substitute cardamom for nutmeg.  This will definitely become a yearly favorite for us!  Thank you!

I had problems with the canning of this. I couldn't get all the air bubbles out and the headspace allotment still made the liquid ooze out.  My syrup was really really thick.  I am wondering if less cornstarch would be better as once I added it, a lot of the flavor went away.???????

Only gets 3 stars due to the directions, but it is a good basic recipe to use for reference. I found that by mixing the cornstarch with the dry ingredients, it will end up clumping in the end product. To prevent this, I simply add the cornstarch with some of the cold liquid and stir until smooth. Bring other ingredients (minus the apples) to a boil then add the cornstarch mixture and stir constantly. Bring to rolling boil & continue stirring for 1 minute. Remove from heat & alternately add apples & filling into sterile jars.

I'm in the minority here, but this didn't work out for me. I can quite a bit, but there is too much syrup here in comparison to the apples. When I made a pie with this, it didn't set at all; the syrup was runny and overflowing. That shouldn't have happened, as I followed recipe exactly. You need about twice the apples and half the syrup. Cornstarch shouldn't be canned anyway.

I made this recipe after reading other reviews on it. I doubled the amount of cinnamon and used 7 cups of apple juice + 3 cups of water. The first time I made it I used the amount of cornstartch called for.  It was a little thinner than what I would have liked. I made it again using 1 1/2 cups Clear Jel starch instead of the cornstarch.  It was great. I then made it two more times and gave it out for Christmas gifts. Everyone really liked it!

I tried this recipe and wish I hadn't... I found out after that cornstarch isn't recommended for canning. I spent a lot of money picking apples for pie filling and was so disappointed. The cornstarch can't stand up to the high heat needed to can. My apples were delicious but the syrup was like cold gravy! I wish I made just applesauce.
 I had to use all my pie filling as a topping and not for pies. Follow the recipe but use Clearjel the cooking type not instant and the food coloring isn't needed.

This is a really nice pie filling.  It's easy to throw together a batch when the Honeycrisp are ready here in WA State.  I've never gotten a full 7 quarts out of it, but no one here has complained about having to munch on that half quart on their vanilla ice cream.  I leave out the yellow food coloring everytime, can't quite comprehend putting it in lovely food.  Note that the recipe says TWO quarts per pie.  I actually use 1 quart per pie because we are happy with a little bit thinner/smaller pie, but if you're looking for the pie that mounds up, use more.  I leave 3/4 to 1 inch of headspace, because it does expand quite a bit.  I've not had any troubles with spoilage because of the cornstarch.  Last year's batch tasted great 11 months later.  I have a batch going right now.  It will take me about 1.5 hours to process once I get everything out and going.  Pretty nice for pies stored up in the winter!  I gave four stars because I made it as is the first time around and it wasn't spicy enough.  I just taste the syrup and amend based on flavor now.  Try a splash of vanilla to the syrup after taking it off of the heat!

THIS IS AN EXCELLENT RECIPE, VERY EASY TO FOLLOW.  I MADE SOME CHANGES TO IT, I PUT IN 2 CUPS BROWN SUGAR, AND 2 1/2 CUPS GRANULATED SUGAR. I ALSO ADDED 2 TSP APPLE PIE SPICE. I FOLLOWED THE SUGGESTION OF BOILING 8 CUPS WATER WITH SPICES AND THEN MIXING 3 CUPS WATER WITH CORNSTARCH AND LEMON JUICE, AND I ADDED 2 TSP VANILLA. ADD THIS TO THE BOILING SPICE MIXTURE.  BE SURE TO REMOVE FROM HEAT AS SOON AS WHITE OF CORNSTARCH HAS DISAPPEARED OR IT WILL THICKEN TO MUCH.  1 CUP OF CORNSTARCH SEEMS LIKE ALOT, BUT IT'S THE PERFECT AMOUNT.  ALSO, BE SURE TO PACK APPLES LEAVING 1 INCH OF HEADSPACE TO ALLOW THE SYRUP A PLACE TO FLOW, FILLING THE JARS TO MUCH AND PACKING THEM TO TIGHT DOESN'T LEAVE ROOM FOR THE SYRUP TO DRAIN INTO YOUR JAR. MAKES A GREAT CHRISTMAS GIFT.  I ALSO MADE APPLE SYRUP FROM SAME RECIPE, MAKE SAME SYRUP MIXTURE, AND INSTEAD OF JUST SLICING THE APPLES, CHOP THEM.  ENJOY!!!!!!

This is the recipe my mom uses, so of course I've used it as well.  I like a little more flavor to mine.  I like to use apple cider in place of the water.  I then reduce the amount of sugar to 3 1/2 cups.  I use 2 tablespoons of cinnamon, plus a splash of vanilla.  I also cook the bite-size sliced apples in the mixture, just until they are a little soft, before filling the bottles.  To each their own!

I've made three batches of this wonderful recipe.  I found it to be easy and had great results.  I have used the filling to bake several pies using a streusel topping.  (1/4 cup butter, 1 cup flour, 1 cup brown sugar)  I used a 9 inch pie plate and only 1 qt. of apple pie filling.  The pies were great and didn't cook over in my oven.

I made this twice last fall with a girlfriend. I think we have it down to a science now! 

We doubled the cinn. spice and added lots of nutmeg. 

The owner of the apple orchard helped us with choosing apples. The crisper the better. I think we may have used regent? 

Gave as Christmas gifts to teachers and coworkers. Very very good. We are also from cranberry country and added craisens to a few jars before filling. 

Thanks so much for sharing!

This worked out very well. We just made a batch and I have enough apples to make a double batch tomorrow. I made one change to the recipe. I used apple cider instead of the water and cut the sugar. It gives the pie filling a much more deep rich apple flavor.

Haven't baked with the filling yet, but tastes great! I used only 2 1/2 cups of sugar, added 1/2 cup sugar and extra cinnamon and nutmeg as recommended. This is the second time I've made it. The first time was not in a wide-mouth jar. I didn't "cram" the apples in and ended up with apples on top and syrup on bottom. Next time I used wide-mouth jars, packed the jars tightly with apples, then poured the hot syrup in. At first I thought the syrup was too thick, but by the time I filled all the jars the syrup in the first ones had made its way down the jars. Just to see what I would get, I saved the peels and cores and made applesauce with them. I used the extra syrup for the applesauce spice and jarred it as well!

I'm a Master Food Preserver, and I thought I'd try a different recipe for apple pie filling than my usual. This one never set up - the "syrup" was too liquidy. It made only 6 quarts (and not all of those completely full). I'll use it as pancake syrup and toast topping, however, to keep it from going to waste. I think I'll stick with my never-fail Ball Blue Book recipe.

I followed the instructions precisely, except that I switched out 1 cup of brown sugar for 1 cup white sugar and increased the spices, but I still only wound up with 4 quart jars of apples.  I have probably 3 cups of syrup left over, which I am going to process with some more apples, but I am so confused because I started out with 6# as required.

The headspace on this is completly wrong !!!  I filled the headspace to the half inch required and when they came out of the canner they were exploding from thier jars .  Resulting in a very nasty burn !  Keep it to an inch and up the spices and lower the required water to 8 1/2 cups.  DO NOT USE CORNSTARCH !!  Order clear gel from the intranet, cornstarch is not recommended by the USDA.  Be sfe and avoid burns and botulism !!!!

Great little recipe with great flavor when using tart pie apples. Do leave 1 inch head space though, as it will ooze out and possibly not seal properly during the water bath.  I made it twice so far and only got 6 quarts each time.  I also tried what another reviewer suggested and added the corn starch mixed into 2 cups out of the original 10  cups of water.  Then after heating the sugar and spices in the 8 cups of liquid I added the corn starch mixture, and only stirred until the whiteness disappeared.  This flowed much better into the air pockets.  The water bath cooks it the rest of the way.  The only thing I did then was to invert the jars (after they sealed themselves) until they were almost cool and then turned them upright again.  The apples tend to float to the top with this method and I like to see them evenly distributed in the jel.

I ended up throwing all my 14 quarts away, luckily, I unscrewed the rings before I gave them away as gifts. They must have overflowed during processing because the inner bands had black mold around them. Will try once more and only fill jars to 1 inch or below.

Minus the food coloring this is the same recipe my MIL gave me when I started canning. We make at least a batch of this every year. I usually add the sauce before the apples to the jars. It's just over 2 cups per jar and then fill with apples and process.

I have never rated or reviewed a recipe until now. I totally had to this time. This recipe is super easy and tastes great! I had never thought of canning apple pie filling, how silly huh?! Well I am sooooo glad I did! I made a pie out of it about 3 weeks after I canned it. Let me tell u, it was divine! My husband and son almost ate it all in one sitting. =D  I will continue to do this for yrs to come, and I plan on passing it on to my children. What an awesome thing! Thank you for sharing!

I changed  a few ingredients;  Apple juice for the water, brown sugar for white sugar, only 1/2 cup of cornstarch, and no food coloring.  I also  brought the mixture to a boil, added apples, and cooked just long enough to soften the apples.  I then packed the jars with the apples (gently pressing them allowing more apples per jar) and poured liquid to within 1 inch of the top.  I used the same liquid but cooked in batches so the apples have plenty or room to expand.  Absolutely perfect.  My husband loves cooked apples so I reduced the cornstarch so it wouldn't be so thick as used in pies.  I got 9 quarts and 6 pints out of this recipe.  I don't know how many apples I used, I picked them from our tree.

I wasn't very happy with this recipe. So many people gave rave reviews. I started with 6# of gala apples but only got 3.5 quarts of pie filling. It also tasted too salty to me and not enough cinnamon. I had about 1.5 cups of leftover syrup. Thank goodness I had an additional 42 lbs of apples on hand. I ended up needing over 12 lbs of apples for this recipe. I think the original submitter meant 6 quarts and not lbs. And I think there needs to be 1 inch of head space instead of 1/2 inch because the filling started oozing out all over the place. Anyways, I have lots of apples left for tomorrow's canning. But I will make some modifications to the recipe.

takes time to make the apple pie filling but it's great in a pinch, just make or grab a shell and you've got a wonderful homemade dessert.

Simply a mess.  Do not attempt to can anything and I repeat ANYTHING with cornstarch or flour.  You will have a big oozy mess on your hands (and kitchen floor for that matter).  Tasted ok though :)

Smelled great!  I did have a problem with the canning of it.  I had almost all of them break the seal, I called Ball for advice, they say they do not recommend using cornstarch.  I had to freeze mine.  They only recommend clear jel as stated in another review.  I will make again using clear jel

As others mentioned this recipe did need extra spices but it did turn out very well. 7lbs apples filled 4 quart jars and 3 3/4 quart jars. I had just enough syrup for the jars so if you're doing all quart jars you may want to try only six jars with six pounds of apples. Also, the recipe worked really nicely with cane sugar.

I used about 12 pounds of apples and made 8 quarts of filling with the same amount of all other ingredients.  The apples shrink while processing and let off some off their juices.  I ended up with a nice amount of fruit and plenty of filling in each quart.  I would not use 6 pounds of apples, it just wouldn't be enough.
Also, food coloring?  I left that out, completely unnecessary and unappetizing.

This reciepe is easy to use, but for canning u cant use constarch as the usda does not recommend it. I have done my research on the cornstrach. I also made this recipe to can as the clear jel which ur supposed to use. I did not find this out till I was done canning the apples with the constarch. So if ur canning u must use the clear jel. orther wise the cornstrach breaks down and seperates from the water. I did follow the recipe to the exact way

Just finished canning 21 quarts of granny smiths using this recipe.  I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the spices and omitted the food coloring. All three batches were beautiful.  One quart didn't pop so I made a pie and it was perfect. Much easier than other pie filling recipes - and just as great tasting!!

I followed the recipe to the letter and my jars overflowed even while processing. I left and inch of headspace. Ive refrigerated the jars because i don't want to throw the filling out. should i rejar it and reprocess it? any advice would be helpful. thank you. I absolutely love this recipe! the flavor is fantastic and i don't want to give up on it.

I made this yesterday and so far it turned out beautifully. It is far easier to make this a two person job then a one person...I made the mistake of removing the syrup from heat while cutting apples an I think I would keep it on low next time, so it stays hot. I only had one jar not seal correctly which is not surprising as this is only the second time I've ever canned anything.
Good stuff. I like the idea of attaching ingredients for apple crisp. I may give in an apple basket to son's teacher as holiday gift.

The recipe canned well for me, made 7 quart jars.  My only criticism was that when I tried to make a pie it was very bland (And I added more spices than were suggested).  I may try it again while apples are still everywhere, but I'll probably use 2-3 times more spices.  And for my remaining 6 jars I'll definately add more before I bake.  Thanks for the recipe though, it is a great time saver to start my thanksgiving pies now before the rush!

This recipe had too much goo for a regular apple pie.  I used a jar of apple with about half the sauce and then added half of the apples in  another jar to complete the pie.  This made the regular pie consistency. The filling will probably be delicious in other recipes.

I made this  to fill turnovers and strudels. worked beautifully, a few changes- I used 3 cups of pasturized cider  and 5 cups water, also extra cinnamon and a dash of cloves. I diced the apples and added them to the sauce and then chilled the mix since I wasn't canning it. a nice thick sauce, much better than store with a homemade flavor.
 will try again and freeze some.

I followed the directions exactly and I am an avid canner, so I decided to give this recipe a try. I think this was an ok jumping off point, but at the same time the first batch was a waste of ingredients. The syrup set up as a jelly consistancy in the jar, but did not hold up in the actual pie. I would suggest reading all suggestions on here before following the directions as is. I made so many changes that I am not going to list because that would be an altogether different recipe.

Wonderful flavor.  I made two batches, and the second batch came out better because I really packed the apples in the jars.  The first batch I didn't do that so the sauce-to-fruit ratio was waaay off.  Rather than use those to make a pie, I just poured some of the excess sauce off when I opened the jar, and warmed the apples in a skillet with a little butter.  Yummy!  A happy mistake, fabulous with baked ham.  If the sauce thickens too much to easily cover the apples in the jars, add a little water until it loosens a bit and it'll pour right over.

Very easy to make and the syrup tastes awesome!  I haven't yet made any pies with this though.  I got just over 7 quarts out of this (which was about 4 apples per quart on average, depending on the size of the apples).  I only had 4 quart jars handy, so I'm freezing 3 1-quart plastic containers and have the leftovers in a smaller tupperware in the fridge.  I'll probably use some of this for a Thanksgiving pie and make some more to give as gifts (I'm really into canning things this year).  Oh, and I used 2 cups brown sugar and the rest white, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and about 1/2 tsp allspice.  I don't think I had quite 1 cup cornstarch, but it was close enough that the syrup thickened up nicely.  I followed some other reviewers suggestions about prepping the apples in the jars before adding the cornstarch/water mixture.  That way, my syrup didn't get too thick and I wasn't trying to do too many things at once.

Delicious but jars overflow during processing even with extra space left in the jar. Tried canning three times, even heated the apples on one try. Also the jars that did seal do not stay that way.  Have checked jars several weeks later and the seal is broken. I have removed them from the jars and froze in freeezer bags.  I have canned for years without problems so would love to find a version of this recipe that actually works for canning.

I upped the spices and replaced 8 cups of the water with apple cider. All of my quart jars overflowed even with well over a 1/2 inch headspace! I repacked the filling in pint jars, left an inch of headspace, and reprocessed the jars.

I used this recipe, as is, for my first time canning apple pie filling.  I think it turned out PERFECT!  I tried one batch with the food coloring, but omitted it for my other 3 batches... I did not see a difference, and therefore saw no purpose.  My favorite is to open a jar and make a quick and easy apple crisp.  Also makes great gifts!

We made 56 quarts of this last fall and it was wonderful.  I have a friend whose family is on a gluten free diet and it fit her criteria too.  I usually made crisp with it and the last quart I threw in about a cup and a half of fresh blueberries when I made the crisp and it was even better. Plan to make it again this year.  Only problem I had was that I didn't have any wide mouth quart jars and that would have made it easier to fill the jars.  Tried it with peaches  last night - so far so good.  Instead of the cinnamon and nutmeg, I substituted the cinnamon plus from Pampered Chef.  The peaches pack tighter than the apples so I had enough for 11 quarts in the recipe.  I only had time to do 10 so I saved the leftover syrup for French toast syrup and it was wonderful.

Wonerful pie filling!  My family was thrilled the first time I fixed a pie.  Very easy to can.  I will always use large-mouth jars.  The small mouth are very difficult to load.

Ok, apple pie filling doesnt get ANY better than this! I did add 1/2 tsp or a bit more cinnamon. I followed the directions exactly, and it turned out PERFECT. I did have a decent amt of the sugar filling left over. I canned that too, for 2 more future pies. What an easy recipe!!

I found I had sooo much sauce and not that many apples but this recipe is really great and really easy to use with many things. Loved it.

I am happy to have found this recipe and have added it to my collection. I used Macintosh apples and cut back the amount of water to 8 1/2 cups. I use a large pie plate for making pies so my yield was 3 - half gallon jars and one gallon jar.

Ugh..so much time wasted on this. The syrup came out WAAAY too thick and gloomy. It took nearly double the amount of apples and it made far too much syrup. Also, I had to reprocess because 1/2 in headspace was not enough. Even after reprocessing with 1 in head space, I had lots of siphoning. Now finding out that canning with cornstarch isn't safe, I'm going to have to freeze all my pie filling. So disappointed.

This is out of this world delicious!  My daughter and I made this for the first time and we both loved it.  We did ramp up the spices, used Gravenstein apples, and added 1/2 cup extra brown sugar.  Yummy, Yummy,this is now our favorite canning project.

This is a fabulous apple pie filling recipe.  It's pretty easy.  I didn't make the entire recipe.  I adjusted it to 16 servings which made a nice size 'filled' 9 inch apple pie.  Everyone loved the filling.  About as close to the store/bakery versions as you can get made right at home.  Thanks for the recipe, I love it!

This is the best way to save the apples from my tree in the back yard.  I need 2 jars for my pie dish that is rather deep.  Has made a great hostess gift in the past as well.

Very easy.  I added vanilla, cloves and about a cup of orange juice  (replacing 1 cup of water) to the syrup.  It gives the pie a whole different taste... Reminds me of Christmas.

worked perfectly. Be careful not to pack your apples too tight because the liquid mixture gets very thick and has a hard time surrounding the apples. Next time I think I will pack them half full add liquid and then add more slices until filled. Smells heavenly!

I came across this recipe and we just had to try it.  We followed it exactly.  I used a mixture of apples including honey crisp.  They make an excellent pie btw. 
All in all we like the recipe, but we feel that the syrup is a little to sweet and next time we will cut down on the sugar.

This was great! I think that I used more apples than called for, I just used an empty qt jar and filled it up 7 times with the cut apples, that worked great. I had one jar that did not seal, so we ate it right away on ice cream and it is GREAT!! Will certainly be doing more!

Very good recipe! I did take the advice of the other reviewers and I upped the spices to 1 TB + 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, added 1/4 tsp clove, and 1/4 tsp allspice. Omitted the food coloring, no need for it. This recipe will make wonderful apple pies, can't wait to use it!

This is a great recipe!  I love having a quick dessert option on the pantry shelf.  So far we have only used this as an apple crisp, sooo yummy!  I did not add the food coloring, don't think it needs it.  I did get 8 quarts from this recipe.

I haven't tasted any of this yet so I can't vouch for the flavor, but I wanted to comment that the recipe requirements are very off.  It took me well over 6 pounds of apples to get 7 quarts...probably closer to 10 pounds.  The recipe for the syrup made way too much.  I was overly generous with the syrup in each jar hoping that I would use most of it and I still had a lot left over.  I probably could have 2/3 the recipe and still had plenty.

I'm not 100% sold on this recipe just yet... I have 7 quarts of pie filling, I will decide if it's a keeper after making a pie.  I advise not to pack your jars as tight as I did.... I had trouble with getting the syrup to sink down in amongst the apple slices...  We used the food processor to slice, maybe that's where I went wrong... I was probably overfilling them. Anyways I did try.

I added all spice and ground cloves too.
I did end up short on the filling of 7 Qts., but I think I could have packed the apples a bit more.

The taste is wonderful!  i just made 2 batches.  I tried one batch with Splenda, but there was a slight after taste, so I would recommend useing the "real stuff".  I did substitute 1 cup of brown sugar for the white sugar and almost doubled the spices as recommended by another reviewer. My mouth is watering just thinking about the pies!

This pie filling is great!  I made it for the first time last year and gave it as Christmas presents.  Now my family is begging for more!  Sure is a good thing that both my parents and my in-laws have 3-4 apple trees each...

This recipe was so easy and fun to make!  I used an apple peeler/corer/slicer for the apples, mixed up a batch of the filling, and canned them.  Quick and easy! Made a perfect 7 quarts, just like the recipe said!  VERY YUMMY TOO!  I was wondering if it would be too sweet, but it wasn't...just perfect! I was surprised how easy it was to make. Will definately make again!

Once it sets on the shelf for a while it separates. You will have apple slices, surrounded by watery liquid, separated by slimy gel. When heated, the slime melts but never thickens again.

WOW:  what a wonderful way to make apple pie!  So easy too.  I did follow a couple of others advise (mix the sugar and spices together (used 3 tsp. of Cinn.) in 8 cups of water, bring to boil and then simmer while getting apples ready).  Once apples are in jars (tightly) mix the corn starch and water into the sugar/spices mixture-works really well) did not use the food coloring.   Follow rest of recipe although only made 6 quarts no worries though as I have 5 apple trees in which to practice!! Thanks for the advise and the great recipe

I had tons of apples that needed some cooking. This recipe was perfect for it! It's the first time I can apple pie filling and was a very enjoyable process. The flavor of the syrup is fantastic so I'm sure I'll bake very tasty pies or empanadas. I used two cups of the water to mix the corn starch and then added the mix to the rest of the water. The color of the syrup is perfect so I didn't add the food coloring.I also soaked the apples in water with lemon to avoid oxidation. I'm pleased with the results.

Didn't have enough apples but still made the whole amount of sauce, just in case.  Added 2 TABLESPOONS of cinnamon (our fam LOVES cinnamon) and put in 4 cups white sugar, 1/2 cup brown for that deep taste and color.  Added 1/2 tsp (instead of 1/4) nutmeg and 1/2 tsp cloves.  I did add the cornstarch with two cups of the water and mixed it, then added it to the sugar/water (remaining 6 cups) mixture.  I used the lemon juice on the slices as I cut them and then used that water as the 2 cups mixed with the cornstarch.  Other than that, left the recipe as it stands.  Put up two quarts of extra sauce (remember, I had a mixed match basket of apples that someone gave me, that were going bad).  We had a basket of bananas that were going bad too.  We cut up some good apples and bananas, added some pecans and mixed it with the sauce.  YUMMO!  We're putting it on French Toast tomorrow.  I made "Apple scrap jelly" out of the peels and cores.  Thanks for the great recipe!  I plan to use this as an apple crisp when family comes in this summer.

While I have not made a pie with this filling to date, I did just prepare the filling.  You do need to be careful of the level the jars are filled, and I found that the sauce took quite a while to heat up and thicken....use some short cuts if you can.I did increase the cinnamon and nutmeg to the level I would use for a single pie, as well as substituted  some brown sugar for white.(1 1/2 c) Looking forward to trying a pie now.

I would add more cinnamon and less 1 c. less sugar.  I found the apples to get softer than I would like for pie or apple crisp.  We will be using our 14 quarts to eat like a chunky applesauce.

used this for a cupcake filling, so I scaled it to 4 servings and diced the apples (I used 1 granny smith and 1 gala).  I omitted the food dye, but followed the rest exactly- PERFECT!  The amount was perfect for 14 cupcakes (made from Applesace Cake IV by Corwynn- this site) and the taste was just what I was looking for!  Can't wait to use this in the fall for canning!

This was my first attempt at canning pie filling and it was fairly simple to do and a few months after canning I made a pie and it was delicious! I didn't change a thing on the recipe. I used Honey Crisp apples from a fruit stand, so it might turn out differently depending on the type of apple you use.

Easy, straight-forward recipe.  Taste your apples and syrup first to adjust flavors before canning. 1 inch headspace worked best on my batch.  Note about the clear jel: yes, it works.  Cornstarch is still safe, however: if your jars and the bath canner come to a boil, then they are at the correct temp to sterilize.

I used the advice of one of the other raters and layered the apples and the sauce, but the rest was exactly like the recipe, then the 2nd batch was too and then the 3rd batch... why change what is so good? Thankyou, Rhonda for sharing such an awesome recipe.

Thanks for sharing this great recipe!  I followed the recipe as written (except left out nutmeg) and did not have any troubles.  I think my next batch I will add more cinnamon though- it seemed a little weak on spices, but I can always add more when I go to bake my pie or crisp.  I also need to pack my jars fuller with apples- there was a lot of syrup compared to apples.   I saved my apple peelings and cooked down to make apple jelly- no waste- yay!!

This was so easy and absolutely wonderful! It's the best apple pie filling I have ever tasted in my life! I did change it a bit by using 1/2 apple juice instead of all water. It is wonderfully thick and so flavorful. Thank you so much for the great recipe!!!

My husband and I made this for the first time last night and we followed the recipe exactly!  It is great!  I didn't change and wouldn't change anything.  We just ate it shortly after we canned the apples--I'm sure these apples would be wonderful with ice cream!

I used this recipe making a batch early this apple season.  I then tried it out in a pie.  Wonderful, perfect pie was the result.  It got rave reviews.  I have made it two more times already.  I did find that 1 quart jar doesn't make as big a pie as I like, so I also make some pints.

I haven't eaten any of this yet, but it looks really good.  I think I put too much nutmeg in it, however.  I'm looking forward to trying it on cheesecake (autumn cheesecake from this site is 10 stars).  I also used apples from a neighbors tree and they were small so peeling took a couple hours.  next time it's large apples and having some help would be the key to speeding up this tedious recipe.

Really like this recipe but did make a few changes. Used 1 T. cinnamon and 1 t. apple pie spice instead of amounts called for, exchanged one cup sugar for brown sugar and only used 8 1/2 c. water. I got a thicker syrup but only got 4-5 quarts of filling.

I wanted to use this for a dessert that called for canned apple pie filling.  I had apples so wanted to make my own.  I also cut the recipe into 4th since I only wanted a single batch.  After I added the apples I kept them on simmer about 10 minutes for them to soften.  WONDERFUL and so much better than the canned stuffed.  I skipped the lemon juice and food coloring since I wasn't actually canning the mixture.

We live in an area where apples are plentiful. Each fall I bottle several batches of this recipe and give it out all through the year. I have yet to make an actual apple pie with it, but know people who have and loved it. I make apple cobbler and apple crisp with it. It's delicious and easy.

Worked perfectly, didn't have quite enough sauce, but I probably could have packed the jars a bit tighter.

This was a great and simple recipe to make. I used some Rum-Brandy I had left from the holidays to add a little flavor, about 1/2 cup. I also put 1 T. cinnamon and 1 tsp. nutmeg in mine. It is so good. The only issue I had was that after packing my apples into the jars and adding the hot syrup...once they all cooled the apples sort of settled and there ended up being too much headspace in my jars.  I am going to either tap the apples down more or try cubing the apples the next time I make it.  But it is a keeper for sure.

I doubled the recipe and used 12 lbs of (2.5inch) fuji apples yield 9 quarts. Looks amazing in the bottles!  The sugar mix cooked to almost a thick pudding consistancy and I added it in layers mix layers mix layers mix. Very pleased- thank you for sharing this one

I just made this and it looks great.  The sauce tastes just like pie filling.  I can't wait to try it later this fall and into the winter.  The only thing I had problems with, it seems it made more sauce than I needed, so I had to peel more apples to make it even out right.  Don't forget the bath for the jars either.  The first batch I made, I thought it was hot enough to seal on its own...WRONG!  I put them in a hot bath, as it said I should do, and they sealed fine.

I have just finished making this. It looks beautiful in the jars. One of my husbands favorite pies is Apple, so I look forward to making one this winter  & getting his opinion. I did add extra spices, and vanilla. I had a little extra filling so I chopped 2 more small apples and put it in a pint jar. I will use that one to try the "Fried Apple Pies" recipe also from Allrecipes Website. I give this 5 stars because of the taste when cleaning the pan out.

I gave this four stars.. because I haven't made a pie with it yet... recipe was very simple. As suggested by other reviews I put in less water and more spice. Syrup tasted and smelled delicious. Was only able to get 5 quarts out of it. I may next time use a little more than 8 1/2 cups of water... Thanks so much, now I have to go pick more apples! :)

I'm rating this a 4 only because I haven't tasted every thing together.  The syrup has a great flavor and I can't wait to get a pie made. Easy recipe, you don't need the yellow food coloring, jars turn out beautiful. One of my jar bottoms broke, too bad I didn't read the review about not using metal knifes before hand.

I always get compliments when I serve the pie made from this recipe! I add a little less water because the first batch I made was just watery enough to make the crust a little mushy. This past time, I added 8 1/2 cups of water, and it was definitely better.

I use this to make apple pie and my husband swears it makes the best! Claim it as homemade because it is!  I don't change a thing in the recipe! This is much better than canned apple pie filling!  Enjoy!

This is a pretty good recipe.  I cut the number of servings down to 14 because I didn't have a lot of apples on hand.  It made 3 jars for me.  I added more spices, including allspice and ginger.  I think next time I would use less sugar.  I used a pressure cooker to cook mine.  It will be nice at Thanksgiving when I can just dump this into a crust but still call it homemade from scratch.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was soooo easy and delicious.  I didn't actually can it, I used it as a compote for waffles and to top ice cream and just stored it in the fridge.  I scaled it down like another reviewer and it was perfect. Yummmmm!!!

I agree this is NOT a reciepe for shelf stability. You CAN NOT use corn starch or flour for thickener if you plan to can it! However you can omit the thickener all together and can it and add thickenerwhen u open it to make your pie. That is directly from the Ball website. Happy canning!

This was my first attempt at canning apple pie filling. Great recipe. Although I used the same amount of apples,  I used a combination of MacIntosh,  Granny Smith and Northern Spy apples for my filling. Just adds an extra dimension to the flavour.

I must point out that the newest canning guidelines for the home preservation of food has declared that cornstarch is not to be used for thickener. (the heat may not penetrate through the whole jar properly...) Clear Gel or some other specially treated product is recommended. I just made it with no thickener and will add it when I use filling. I am sure it is going to be wonderful to have on hand for our upcoming cold winter.

This is a big NO next canning season. Over time it turns to apple slices with juice and chunks of cornstarch slime.  When heated, the slime thins out and recombines with the juice into a very runny sauce.  If you have to thicken a second time, why bother?

I only had enough apples for four quarts so I had lots of syrup left over. I didn't want to waste it so I put it in half pint jars and processed it. Now I'll have ice cream or cheesecake topping!

Flavor is good, but seems to be missing something.

Made it several times 2 years ago when there was an abundance of apples. Even though many people claim "it's not safe" to use cornstarch, 2 years later I am still using the canned filling and it's fine.

This is the best. I use this recipe for canning and if you adjust the serving size to 14  it is perfect for a 9inch pie.  I use   Clear jel instead of corn starch. You can find it online.  Corn starch tastes a little chalky to me, clear jel has no taste. I use it for all of my recipes that need to thicken.

This is a great recipe. We needed more than 6 lbs. of apples for 7 quarts, but the sauce was just about enough for 7 quarts. My daughter-in-law & I declared this recipe is 5 stars and a keeper.

Thanks for the awesome recipe....it worked perfectly!!  I would have given it a five but I had to tweak a couple of things.  First off, I filled up my big bowl w/ sliced apples (I have no idea how many pounds that was), added all the dry ingredients except for the cornstarch and two cups of water (which I mixed separately to remove all clumps), added the cornstarch mix to that and boiled.  I also added an extra tsp of cinnamon and also 1/4 tsp of both ground cloves and allspice; as I like other reviewers also like my apple pie with more spice.  Cooked that concoction up until it was bubbly and the white from the cornstarch disappeared.  Packed the apples in my clean, sterilized jars, added the yummy sauce (I also left approx one inch from the top) and processed in my pressure cooker.  Worked perfectly-thanks again!!

I have made this recipe for years.  It's so handy to make a quick pie and my family loves them.  I don't know about cornstarch being dangerous.  It will get a bit strange looking over time in the bottle but it isn't spoiled and tastes just fine when baked.

This was an excellent recipe.  I found it to be very simple to make.  Red Delicious apples worked fine in it.  I also increased the cinnamon and absolutely loved it.  I used it 3 days later in an apple pie---delicious!!!   Great recipe and thanks for sharing it.

I made this recipe a couple of years ago and it was wonderful. I decided to make Apple Pie cookies (a recipe I saw on Pinterest) for Christmas this year and did not have any Apple pie filling, I had to buy it at the store. I will not make the mistake of not canning my own again! The pie filling at the store was almost $4 for a small can of filling! I will be doing my own from now on!!!

I followed this recipe exactly and this fall I must, must buy more apples! One of the best and easiest recipes I've ever done! Used it in pies, crisps, on top of crepes and waffles and everyone loved it!

I'm not overly impressed.  I think I'll stick with canning chunky cinnamon applesauce, and freezing my apple pies.

I did add more spice....made the cinnamon heaping tsps, fresh grated nutmeg and 1/8 tsp clove.  When I filled the jars up to one inch of the top they gushed when I took them out.  The ones I only filled half with syrup did not. I tried cutting down on the cornstarch as it seemed too much but in the end had to ad all that was asked for, also forgot the lemon juice to start and what a difference it makes.  I will definitely make more and work on the gushing problem till I am satisfied.

This filling is great!  I did up the spices a bit and added a little allspice, but otherwise, I have had so many good reviews that I can't keep an apple pie around the house for more than a day!  Works well to make apple crisp, too.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made a full batch and a couple of days later made 2 pies. The were great and it was simple to do when I used Krusteaz pie crust mix. Practically no mess to clean up. I am in the process of making another batch since I have a large supply of Granny Smith Apples.

I followed the directions of "naturalsugar" below and it turned out very well.  It made exactly 7 quarts although it took more than 6 lbs of apples.  I didn't weight the extra, I just kept peeling as I needed them.   This recipe is a keeper!

Made this last year & it was easy to make & tasted yummy!  Made good pies & was just as good warmed up & poured over ice cream (how my daughter's boyfriend likes it!)  Mine also came out with 9 quarts instead of 7.  Will definitely be making more now that apple season is rolling around again!

Very tasty, but doesn't look so great in the jars.  It all seemed to settle and needs a good stir before using. "Syrup" seems a little thin, but works great for the coffee cake recipe I intended it's use for.

Was very happy that the sauce made exactly enough for 7 quart jars. We added some spices as mentioned on the first page and it was a "spicier" apple pie filling when we tasted it but my husband likes it this way. :) Thanks!

UPDATED: We've made all but two of the pies now, 1 jar makes a decent pie but a jar and a half makes a nicely filled pie. We follow other apple pie recipes for baking times. The thing about this filling is that when the pie is cold (in the fridge) it becomes all goopy and almost solid where a normal apple pie does not so it's not very good cold and really only good warm. It's not as good as a regular apple pie but it's close and definitely fills that craving when you want a fast pie or wouldn't otherwise be able to make an apple pie. I'd still can these we're just finishing using them more than a year later but I'm not sure how many quarts I'd do. Still like the recipe but I've definitely learned a few things from it. :)

The filling tastes great!  I think eventually when I get around to actually making a pie from these I will add a touch more spice and possibly a touch more sugar but I like that I can do that later with this :)  I think this is excellent as is and I really appreciate the recipe.  I ended up only having 8 large apples so this made 4 Quarts of Apple Pie Filling and I just canned the filling only in the other jars :)  Why Not?  I ended up with roughly 2 Quarts of Filling Only (without apples).  I will just use those with fresh apples one day :)  I will definitely be using this recipe over and over again.  I did add about 1/2 tsp allspice to mine for personal preference and my teaspoons of cinnamon were heaping :D  I will update when I make a pie :)

This was pretty good but I did add a lot more cinnamon, ginger and allspice and 1/2 brown sugar with the white.

I made this recipe using 2 cups of honey instead of 4.5 cups sugar.  All else is the same, although like others I added more spices like allspice, cloves, and more cinnamon.  Still came out tasty.  I haven't made a pie yet, but it was really easy and the syrup tasted great.

We tried this recipe, and it's THE BEST apple pie filling we've Ever had!  Everyone that tried it wants us to make them a pie.  It's very easy, makes a gorgeous presentation in the jar and taste OUT OF THIS WORLD!  THANKS!  I'll use this recipe from now on.

Very good! I decreased the sugar to 4 cups and instead of 10 cups of water for the syrup, I used 8 cups of apple juice. More apple flavor! 
1 lb of apples=3 med apples
6 lbs=about 18 apples=6 quarts
12 lbs of apples=approx. 36 apples (heaping dishpan full)
this "doubled" recipe makes about 12 qts of pie filling.

Made this today and itâs excellent! I did add about 1/2 tsp more cinnamon than it called for but the flavor is awesome. I canned up 17 pints of apple pie filling today using this recipe. Definitely a keeper recipe.

Only used 2/1/2 c sugar
Used corn starch
Next time would fill jars half full with apples pour some mixture in and do that till they are full. 
This time we had to push all the apples down with a wooden spoon and long knife to get mixture down to bottom and broke up a lot of the apple slices. But sugar mixture tasted pretty darn good. So might not look so pretty, but am quite sure  they will go to waste. On ice cream, waffles, pancakes.....

Very easy recipe and the filling turned out beautifully.  The substitutions I made were I used Clear Jel rather than cornstarch, doubled the cinnamon, and did not use food coloring.  I also mixed the apples and syrup together before adding to the jars.  Worked perfectly!

I used citric acid instead of lemon juice, subbed out some of the water for apple juice and added a 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper.  Not red pepper.  Cayenne.

I did the adaptations suggested by a couple other reviews. I upped the cinnamon to 3 teaspoons and added 1/8 tsp ground cloves. I also set aside 2 cups water with cornstarch and lemon juice and added it in at the end. It was perfect.

I will definitely be using this recipe again, the flavoring is great. Although watch what kind of apples to use, my filling was a little runny from using apples from our tree. I just add a TBSP of cornstarch before I put it in the pie crust.

I wrote my first review as my jars were cooling, so this review is in addition to my first review. All of my jars didnât seal using these processing times. I did a second batch that I processed for 25 minutes and they sealed. So now I had to freeze all of my jars. A bit upset as I am taking up valuable freezer space. I should have researched it more BEFORE I processed the jars. ?????????  

I didnât really make any changes other than I prepared the apples before making the syrup. When I poured the syrup on it was too thick and my apples were too packed into the jar. Plus I didnât measure how many apples to use. I ended up dumping the apples into the syrup 2 jars at a time. Then re-pouring them back into the jars. ?? I got almost 10 jars of filling after doing it this way. I would suggest not packing the apples in too much or cooking the apples in with the syrup then pouring them into the jars.

I doubled the spices as others had done. I had to scrape the pan to have enough syrup, barely. If I made it again I'd go a little heavier on the water, maybe 1/2 c. I haven't used it yet so thats why I gave it 4 stars.

Excellent, tasty recipe.  It was easy in the fact that all needs to be done is make the sauce, pack your quart jars, ladle in the sauce, and hot bathe to seal.  Be sure to take a knife and squish the apples around to ensure sauce is distributed throughout.  I used the "knife" suggestion from another review and sure enough, it proved to be useful.  My yield was seven quarts.  I was trying for eight, but once the sauce is in, several more apple pieces can be packed into the jars, which almost used up the apples I had packed into an eighth jar.   So I got only seven instead of eight quarts.  The recipe is right on.  My taste tester husband used the word "delicious" on his first - and every - bite.

I made it however took out the cornstarch and food colouring. I simmered  the apples with 2 cinnamon sticks in addition to the rest of the ingredients which gave it a nice deep caramel color. Added jars to a boiling water bath for 25 mins. Came out great ??

This recipe is what I've been looking for.  In the past I have cooked the apples along with the syrup and depending on the apples, some of the filling turned out pretty mushy.  However when I did it, I left out the thickening agent when canning, and stirred it in when I made the pie.  The recipe I used called for flour which worked pretty well when adding it later.  I haven't made this yet, but I think I will just leave out the thickening as I did before.  But the rest, making the syrup and raw packing the apples sounds like it will take care of the mushy problem.  Can't wait to try it and will write another review when I do.

When I took my jars out from the bath, 2 of them oozed syrup out. Anyone else have this happen?

This was one of the 1st recipes I tried when I discovered All Recipes & when I had just begun canning.
For the posters saying not to use cornstarch, we have used it in every single batch we have made with zero side effects. After coming out of the water bath canning, our longest lasting jar was almost 2 years old(only because it was hiding. Otherwise that baby would have been LONG gone, lol)... still tasted as amazing as the day we canned it!
Now, my 2 cents on the recipe itself..... for a single batch of the sauce we usually can fill 6 quart jars... this varies on how any sliced apples weâve put into the jar before pouring the hot filling over it.
For those complaining of a bland taste.... just add a little more cinnamon or nutmeg to the recipe. As it thickens, get a small amount on a spoon and taste it! If youâre a new cook, whisk in small amounts of whatever you think it needs to kick it up to the next level and KEEP TASTING(use a clean spoon though... no one likes a double dipper). And yes, the best tasting apples for this recipe would be Granny Smith or another tart version, but we have also made it with Red Delicious, Fuji, basically which ever has been on sale. And it still tastes AMAZING every time!

Ok, now for the big question.... what to do if you have extra sauce. We poured ours into pint and 1/2 pint jars, water bath process for the same 20 minutes, and decided it was a brown sugar/Cinnamon/nutmeg jelly to be added to plain oatmeal or cream of wheat for seasoning

Won't waste time on this again.  Apple's are very mushy and the sauce is soupy.  Will be hard to find a use for them. Sure won't be going in my Apple pies!

Originally gave 5 stars, but had to change that for several reasons.  
First, I had to use more than twice the apples listed in the recipe, to fill 6 (not 7) quart jars.
Second, leaving 1/2 inch headspace, all my jars leaked while cooling, and only 3 sealed.  Even with reprocessing, those last 3 wouldn't seal.
I'll be looking for a different recipe next time.

I followed the recipe exactly except for using Clear Jel and the syrup was so thick it was a messy process to fill the jars. Had to put some in bottom fill with apples and push them down then add more syrup then apples. I left a one inch headspace and they still oozed when I took them out of the canner. The seals are on solid so I am going to hope that they are sealed properly.  Won't be doing this again. Too messy.

I did not add the yellow food coloring. Yes, I will continue to do this. I love, love, love this recipe! It's fantastic that it makes such a large batch. It is so easy, quick, and will be my go to from now on, to can the apples from my Hareldson apple tree in the back yard.

I made this last weekend.  Taste was fantastic, but I ran into a few issues.
I followed other reviewers suggestions - did not add food colouring, increased spices (1tbsp cinnamon, 1/3tsp nutmeg, 1/4tsp clove, 1/4tsp allspice).  I also packed the apples raw in the jars and then ladled the syrup into it (I packed in as much as possible).  I also omitted the food colouring, which to me is absurd.
The other change I made was I used my homemade un-spiced apple cider as the base instead of water for the syrup.
I left an inch headspace, but the jars still overflowed/oozed out when I took them out of the boiling water.  The apples looked like they really shrunk and there was a LOT more liquid by the end of processing.  I had to open them up, scoop out 2 heaping tbsp and re-process.  NEXT TIME, I will follow the original directions to cook the apples in the syrup before putting them in the jars.  I think doing that I would have avoided the apple shrinkage and overflow.  I haven't turned the processed jar filling into a pie yet, but I did reserve some apples and filling and bake a pie the same day, so I know the taste is fantastic.

This had great flavor and consistency. It's great straight from the jar and on pancakes (we had a jar that didn't seal, so we sacrificed it for quality control). Not too sweet, not too tart, and the cinnamon and nutmeg weren't overpowering.

I will definitely make this again, but I'll be making some changes. I would recommend filling the jars with both apples and syrup leaving one inch of headspace, instead of the instructed 1/2-inch, because the apples will add their own juice.  I also omitted the food coloring.

I doubled the cinnamon and added allspice like others suggested.  Also cut down at least a 1/2 cup of sugar and it is still really sweet.  Pressure canning right now at 5lbs for 8 min as another reviewer advised.  Crossing my fingers there is no leakage!

I use this recipe every year and I have never had a problem with it. It is very easy and best of all for my family it is gluten free. I use juice from the leftover parts of the apples (I have 2 trees so I get a lot of apples) to substitute for half the water.

I've made this recipe both for canning and also for freezing.  The taste is awesome! Less one star because following the canning procedure and these directions exactly, I was having an issue with pouring the sauce over the jars filled with apples.  Even using the air bubble tool, I couldn't get all the air out of the jars.  I had better luck mixing the apples into the syrup and pouring into jars that way.  Also, that is the method I used for freezing.  I put the apples in the pot with the syrup,  cooked for a couple of minutes, and put in containers .  Perfect for apple pies or brown betty all year long!

This was an excellent recipe. As a seasoned canner of just about everything apple pie filling was one item I had never attempted. I was originally going to try the recipe in my 1969 Blue Ball canning book but didn't want to cook the apples first so this seemed perfect. I left out the lemon juice and food coloring and used a mix of Mutsu and Golden Delicious apples. The leftover filling and apples went into a pie and it was delicious. Definitely will add it to my annual canning. I read the review regarding cornstarch not being safe for canning so I will be monitoring my filling over the coming months.

Absolutely perfect! Didn't change a thing. I used a bunch of wild apples I found in the woods, they were tart and crunchy, perfect to hold texture in the pie. I really like the saltiness of the sauce, really enhances the whole flavor.

The only thing for me was that I used about 8 pounds of apples to pack my jars. I had just enough syrup leftover to toss with some more apples and make an apple crisp on the fly. Great!

I put the apples and the sauce in the jars alternately. No air bubbles done this way. I also used the yellow food coloring and it is much more appealing to the eye. Remember: folks always say, "that looks good" before taking a bite

I will make again as I have lots of apples this year. I left out the food coloring. 
6# apples is about 18 cups or 36-40 apples. 
The final test will be when I make a pie but it tasted good and looks great.

This recipe turned out wonderfully for me tonight.  I used the suggestion on making the sugar mixture and the cornstarch mixtures separately and then mixing them together.  I purposely used this recipe because it allows cornstarch.  The sauce could have maybe used a bit more seasoning - which, when I make another batch tomorrow I will add.  Overall, a terrific recipe!

torn between 4.5 and 5 stars.... the only reason is that... it's alot of sugar... I may next time reduce the granulated sugar and add some brown sugar, trial and error... but as the recipe stands - too sweet.... otherwise... I was hesitant in making the syrup and know that you can buy pre-made syrup (not sure of the difference) as apposed to using regular cornstarch... but... seriously... don't waste your money on the expensive corn starches.  I used the loblaws stuff in the yellow box with black writing and it was no different I am sure if I had used the more expensive cornstarch.  Just make sure you mix all the dry ingredients really well.  I measured and added the liquid component in a separate pan though and then poured it all into the sugar mixture in one go and stirred like crazy... corn starch is hard to work with hence why I think mixing it thoroughly made a difference... it took a while on the convection at high temp to finally get some boil LOL.... but that may have been attributed to a very heavy weighted pot base *shrug*.... eitherway, you need to work very fast.  I actually used Bernardin Fruit Fresh once I had peeled the apples and made another bath with the same Fruit Fresh once I had sliced the apples so that they didn't go brown. That stuff worked a treat.... I had close to 2.5 pounds of apples and I still have 1/2 the syrup left over so I will be buying more granny smith apples tomorrow and using the rest. I used 8 500ml jars and I am sure I can use the same

This was a fabulous recipee but I would cut back on the sugar next time. I don't like to adulterate the goodness of the apples and to me this did. Loved the amount of spices though. Also, would use this recipee again but think I would heed the warnings of the people who said not to use corn starch to can with and I would use the clear jel.  It did do 7 quarts exactly for me. Thank you for sharing!

Yes, I have tried this recipe.  My mother-in-law loved it so much we got more apples this year and plan on a yearly tradition of making this pie filling. She is very old school and amazed that she liked it so well.  Very tasty and convenient to use.  Use a tart apple if wanting more stark flavor.

Awesome!  Made a case of 1 liter jars with this recipe, and my husband and 7 kids all tried the leftovers and gave it 16 unanimous thumbs up!  I did alter the recipe a bit, by substituting 10 cups of all natural NO SUGAR added apple juice for the water, cutting the sugar back to 2 cups white sugar and one cup brown. I omitted the food colouring.  I  also canned several pints of small diced apples in the sauce for the kids to spoon over yogurt, ice cream and/or oatmeal.  I am pretty sure that one case of the liter jars will not be enough for our family, so will be doing this recipe again in a week or so after another trip to our local orchard.  These jars would make the most awesome gifts!

Good recipe but I used apple pie filling instead of cinnamon and nutmeg. It's good. For sure need to leave at least a 1 inch headspace. All of my jars on the first attempt oozed and leaked. No seals. But great taste.

The taste of this is AMAZING! I used pears from our tree and it TASTED fantastic. The down side is that I ended up in the restroom after eating this (tried it a couple of times)...I think it was because the cornstarch doesn't let it get to the correct temp for canning. Unfortunately, I had to throw it all out. I WILL be making this again, although next time, I will be sure to use Clear Jel.

Easy, quick.  Follow directions to the letter.  After canning, you just pour the canned filling into an unbaked crust.  You will have apple pie in no time without all the fuss!!

This recipe was awesome. I didn't add the yellow food coloring and added a 1/8 tsp of cloves since we like our apples with a little spice. When baked in a pie the apples stay crisp and the syrup and spice taste GREAT! I will be using the recipe for years to come!

I'd give 4 1/2 stars if I could figure out how.  Made the first batch cold pack using Gala apples fresh from the orchard with increased spices (not apple pie spice). Instead of slicing the apples I chunked them becuz I want a non-pie dessert and some crunch.  Pretty good.  This time I'm using clear gel instead of cornstarch and I'll see how that does.  I'm trying to recreate an apple dessert that is in a frozen dinner I had as a kid.  I still can't get the basic sauce as cinnamon-y as I want despite increased amts of ground & whole cinnamon, allspice and cloves.  Very good.

I also really enjoyed this recipe.  I had BOXES of apples so I just started filling the jars and adding filling.  I also found it needed some additional spice. I omited the yellow coloring too.  I feel it didn't need it and for the glutin free people, do you really know the coloring is free of it? I was helping a friend and she didn't know of any colors that were glutin free.

5 stars isn't enough for this recipe.  Came out better than I ever dreamed of.  Used it for some old time apple bars and the compliments never stopped coming. I'm gonna try making a Splenda version of this for all the diabetics in my family.
