Superb frozen treat. For those who found it to be too bland, add 1/8 tsp salt, which will bring the flavor to life. Also added a pinch of soda, since all chocolate chip cookie dough recipes have soda, and it tasted like the real thing. It was very soft, but I had no problem rolling into balls. I used them to bake into the cupcake recipe on this site (long name, like Choc. Chip Cookie Dough + Cupcake...) because the dough mixture in that recipe features eggs, and since it is not supposed to bake all the way through, I used this one instead as it does not feature the use of raw eggs. Absolutely perfect.

Great recipe!  We melted chocolate in a double boiler and dipped the frozen balls into the chocolate and then refroze.  My daughters want to add sprinkles next time.

Wendy's fast food restaurants have what is called a Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough blizzard or freeze. It's vanilla ice cream with a mix-in of these round, small bits of heaven in the form of chocolate chip cookie dough yumminess!  THIS is what this recipe provides. As a surprise for our recently Jr. High graduate son's party I made this recipe. The ONLY changes I made for us is NO WALNUTS (to ME AKA I call them 'dirt clods' lol) and I added the whole two cup bag of chocolate chips.  This provided the mix to go further for the party and also a guaranteed chip in every cluster!  Rather than the messiness of forming the 'balls' of dough by hand, I used two small measuring spoons and scooped up the dough with one and dropped little piles of the soft dough onto two cookie sheets. I froze them in the freezer for only 30 mins and then spatula'ed them into a ziploc bag and back into the freezer until dessert time.  I got rave, rave reviews with this recipe.  You will too. On the make-your-own-sundae bar our guests sprinkled the dough bits on top of scooped vanilla ice cream and drizzled hot fudge and topped everything with Cool Whip in a can spray.  You won't regret this one people. :)

Mmmmm...who doesn't like cookie dough?! This recipe is the best!!!

I have no idea what people are talking about when they say the recipe is dry and crumbly. I don't even add the water and it's perfect! Maybe they aren't using an electric mixer, I don't know.

All in all, I wonderful, must-try recipe.

Easy pea-sy to make a no-worry cookie dough.  I halved the recipe and ended up with about 24 balls.  I melted 1 c semi-sweet chips and 2T or so of veg oil to coat them with.

These turned out great! I was looking for make something easy and sweet. I made half of the cookie dough into balls which I dipped into tempered milk chocolate and the other half I rolled into extra small balls so I could add them as a mix-in for ice cream. They tasted better the following day after making them. The evening I made them they tasted very brown sugary which I didn't like at all, but after a day the flavor and texture melded together and they were great!

These are delicious!  I made them without the walnuts.  If you've ever eaten the store-bought prepared cookie dough straight from the freezer, this tastes exactly the same.  Yummy!

We LOVED these! If you love cookie dough, you will love these! I did make a few changes though, which is why I am only giving this 4 stars. As is, it deserves 4 stars. I used 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and a whole bag of normal sized chocolate chips. I like it better when there is chocolate in every bite. I made them a very decent size, yet they made more than expected, which was a plus! Also, I put them into the freezer for about an hour and then dipped some of them in chocolate. They were great and looked amazing! If you dip them in chocolate or not, they still look and taste fine. Also, I found that in the freezer it froze a little too much, so instead I put them in a container and placed them in the coldest part of the fridge. They are still great, and I reccomend eating them directly from the fridge/freezer.

We followed the receipe exactly, and it was dry and bland.  We added a pinch of salt, and then some white sugar and it became "passable" but I would never make these again or ask anyone other than my family to taste them. I'll stick to sweating it in the kitchen from now on.

If you are the person who enjoys stealing bites from the cookie dough, these are for you. Why bother making cookies when what you REALLY want is to eat the entire bowl of dough? Roll up a bunch of these suckers and enjoy a guilty treat. They are exactly what they claim to be: frozen chocolate chip cookie dough balls. And they are great.

This does not taste quite the same as the real thing but close enough. If they are dry and crumbly you added too much flour. The right way to measure it is to fluff it up with a spoon and use that spoon to fill the cup. Never dip a cup into the flour and then tap it to add more. That is too much. If you really want to know how much more you're adding weigh it sometime. 1 cup of all purpose flour should weigh about 4.5 oz. Other kinds of flour are different. Also adding bit of salt to this recipe is a good idea.

These are so easy to make and taste exactly like the dough sold at supermarkets. The hardest part is clearing freezer space for the little balls. I made a couple of changes: used 3/4 cups white sugar+ 3/4 cups brown sugar instead of 1.5 cups brown sugar, and added 1/4 tsp salt. This recipes made about 24 walnut-sized balls.

Um - yummy! If you're a spoon licker, this is it - there's nothing not to love. I put the dough in the fridge before rolling into balls and then froze them before dipping (just halfway) in melted chocolate. It's that sweetness that makes you want to barf but also makes you reach for another...

So yummy! These were a total hit. They are better on day two, and even more yummy if they thaw a little bit :) I used 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar...I also added a little salt because I love it with my chocolate! Dipped in Almond Bark and decorated with festive sprinkles.

These were a huge hit with my kids who all prefer to eat unbaked cookie dough over baked cookies! I omitted the nuts and dipped the frozen balls in melted semi-sweet chocolate chips and sprinkled with Valentine's sprinkles. So easy and cute! Very dangerous to have on hand, especially if you're watching your weight :) We actually prefer them refrigerated vs. frozen. Don't want to worry about breaking a tooth, plus we always eat the dough out of the refrigerator, not the freezer. Fun new recipe!

I just made these.  I took the advise of adding salt and baking soda, they are delicious!  The dough is very soft so I used my cookie scoop to place portions on a baking sheet and froze them for about 14 minutes and they rolled great.  I put them back in the freezer for an hour before coating with chocolate.  I can't wait for my  family to taste them.

I gotta say I was a little disappointed in these. I followed recipe to a tee...even froze overnight. They were really bland and i also thought they were kinda dry. It was as if they were just missing something. All said they weren't awful, but they weren't WOW either. Will have to play around with this or continue searching for another recipe cause I really like the concept of it. Thanks for the submission.

These are simple and taste great. I ended up covering the dough balls with tempered white chocolate, and it worked well to keep the ball firm while eating it. If you eat just the cookie dough it softens quickly it your hands, so eat quickly. :) A tip for rolling them into balls- scoop out teaspoon sized lumps onto the cookie sheets and freeze for 30 minutes. Take them out and they should be firm enough to roll in your hands.

want to make it super healthy????? replace flour with almond flour (in most groceries health food section) replace butter with tahini and use cocoa chips. replace sugar with agave nectar (to taste won't need a whole lot) replace the chocolate sauce with: two tablespoons of coconut oil melted with 2-3 tablespoons cocoa powder and agave nectar to taste.
all these things can be found in regular groceries health food section.

This was soooo good. I halved the recipe, but didn't half the liquid because otherwise, it was too crumbly. It was the perfect amount and I will DEFINITELY make these again!

Excellent recipe!  So easy and quick to whip up.  They disappeared in 3 days.  I followed the recipe exactly - the only change was that I didn't use an electric mixer.  Didn't taste bland at all...tasted exactly like cookie dough.  My guys thought they were getting a treat and kept sneaking it from the bowl.  :o)

I made the recipe exactly as written, and while they weren't bad, they definitely tasted STRONGLY of brown sugar, even had a brown-sugar texture to them. As one reviewer stated, it was better the second day, but still wouldn't be something I'd want to eat. Might play with the recipe some.

This dough is delicious! Mine did not actually freeze - it just got very cold. I used margarine so that's probably why it didn't freeze well. My husband loved the taste and the fact that there were no raw eggs in the dough.

made these last night for work, needless to say- "YUM!"  had to add salt, a little extra water and I like equal parts white and brown sugar.  Will I make these again?  I have no choice, they're already asking for them for our next party!

These were delicious! We made a white chocolate Macadamia  nut cookies.  I covered them with chocolate following the one of the reviewers suggestions: I put the frozen dough ball on a fork and then spooned white chocolate over the ball.  Then wiggled the fork up and down to get the excess chocolate off...worked really well.  I used a 1 1/2 Tablespoon scooper.  This is probably too big, they are really rich!

I made a small change to these..instead of 1 1/2 brown sugar, I used 1 cup of brown and 1/2 white.  I lowered the butter to 1 1/2 sticks instead of 2.  They are great dipped in chocolate.

These are so tasty and delicious, and no raw egg! I substituted 1/2 cup of white sugar for some the brown sugar, so it wouldn't be overwhelming. Also, it is essential to add at least a 1/2 tsp of salt, otherwise they are pretty sweet. I keep mine in a gallon bag in the freezer, and they are gone within a week!!

These were really good...however, I think next time I will simply make my normal Choc. Chip cookie dough recipe....the fact that there is no salt is a little bit weird, because I think that the salt and baking soda add quite a bit to the overall flavor of the cookie dough.  These were a big  hit with my family, though!  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for my best friend who LOVES cookie dough. I used chocolate chunks instead of the mini chocolate chips, left out the walnuts and used only a teaspoon of vanilla extract. They were delicious! I think next time I will cut down on the butter using only one and a half sticks. Other than that this is a perfect treat for a cookie dough lover!

We loved the recipe as written, but over time it has evolved to perfection for us. Following the advise of others, I use a pinch of baking soda, a few shakes of salt, 1 cup brown sugar and the remaining 1/2 cup in white, only 1 tsp vanilla, and replace the nuts with extra chocolate chips. Last time I used 3/4 c chocolate chips and 3/4 cup butterscotch chips...yum! Haven't tried dipping them yet, because I think they are perfect as is, and I find almond bark to be much too waxy when frozen. I love this recipe!!

Add 1/8 t of salt, that helps! Also, replace some of the brown sugar with white sugar.

Nice idea, but despite loving cookie dough, I can't eat these.  WAY too much sugar resulting in a granulated texture even though I creamed well with beaters.  Needs some salt, too.  Really doesn't taste like normal cookie dough and therefore is disappointing.

Nauseatingly sweet.  I added about 1/2 tsp. of salt because I like my chocolate chip cookies with salt.  I also used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar.  That made them perfect.  I melted a 12-oz. bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips with 2 Tbsp. Crisco, and dipped and drizzled all the balls.  They were really good.  The kids went nuts over RAW COOKIE DOUGH!!!!!

An unusual treat if you want to try something different! We dipped ours in chocolate and added valentine sprinkles. As one reviewer recommended, we did add salt and it made a huge difference.  I took some to a potluck with a bunch of middle-school age kids and then took the rest to work. They were a hit with everyone.

I used whole wheat flour (it's all I ever have around the house), so I had to add a few tablespoons of peanut butter to get the batter a little more moist.  This is pretty good stuff!

Far from being anything remotely healthy... these tasted really good... I can finally feel "safe" from eating raw eggs in normal cookie dough... these do make a nice little snack dessert though especially if you dip them in chocolate... I used 1 cup semi-sweet chips and 2 tablespoons shortening and it worked perfectly... they turned out wonderful.... only reason I gave them 4 stars is because they seemed to lack the flavor real cookie dough has even though i did add a pinch of salt next time i will add a little more and maybe some baking soda... but the only other downside is they are also not at all healthy... but what desserts really are...

Made exactly as directed.  They weren't dry or crumbly, tasted like cookie dough.  Next time I'll add a pinch of salt, just to see if it makes a difference.  My kids loved them!

I really wanted to love these, but they fell a little short for me.  First off, when it comes to chocolate chip cookies, or the dough I tend to be very picky.  As far as premade cookies go, only the nestle tollhouse squares will I eat.  I have my own choco chip recipe that I make if I want homemade ones...and strangely it's not the tollhouse recipe.  Maybe I would like them better dipped in chocolate.  I am going to try with the ones I just made and see if that give them that little extra.

These were really good!  I added a little salt as suggested by others to give a little more flavor.  My only real reason for the 4 star rating is that they were almost too hard to eat when stored in the freezer; I definitely found them to be better refrigerated. Rolled them out and cut into heart shapes for Valentine's day.

DO NOT USE MARGARINE. Okay, so I've made theses twice now and the first time I followed the recipe perfect and they turned out awesome! The second time I didn't have real butter, so I used margarine. I thought since I've made cookies like that, these would be fine like that as well. BIG MISTAKE!!! I might be stupid for trying but hey, I wanted to make these! So word to the wise never substitute with margarine in this recipe.

So good! Theses taste just like cookie dough, don't miss the egg at all. I dipped mine in Chocolate, melted one bag of chocolate chips with a little shortening. The only thing I can't figure out is how to get them so perfectly round. Some of the photos show such round, beautiful chocolate balls!

Pretty good. I left out the chips and nuts, rolled into a log and froze for an hour before eating. Good enough to satisfy a cookie dough craving but the lack of eggs is definitely too noticeable.

This is a really good recipe.  I didn't have brown sugar so I used white sugar and I only had about 1 1/2 cups of flour, but the recipe turned out great, just as good as real cookie dough.

Well I enjoyed the cookie! However the brown sugar taste was very strong. which is ok for those who enjoy that. But thats not really me. I also dipped them in chocolate. 1/3 of them were dipped in unsweetened choco. 1/3 of them were dipped in milk choco. and the rest of them were plain. They were all delicious! :-)

Loved these! I scooped them into balls and coated them in dark chocolate. They really have to be frozen all the time- they can get mushy if you don't. I love the taste of cookie dough and these are the perfect treat to have on hand! I will be making these again, SO GOOD!

I could take or leave this recipe.  If I were to make it again, I would put in only 1 teaspoon of vanilla and substitute half of the brown sugar for white sugar.  I really love vanilla, but it was overpowering in this recipe.  I ate about half of the cookie dough balls over the course of a week and then decided that I wasn't enjoying them enough to justify the amount of calories that they were and I threw the rest away.  I like the thought of cookie dough without raw egg, but this quite do it for me.

I LOVE this recipe! Sometimes my husband abd I just wanna be fatties and eat some cookie dough, but I'm pregnant right now so I didn't want to touch anything with raw eggs. I make a batch of this and just throw it in a container for the freezer. So whenever we get a fattie craving, we just grab a spoon! But I do agree to add the salt and baking soda. Makes it taste like the real thing!

I'm a huge cookie dough fan so I am rating this recipe as a 5 but those who don't really care about cookie dough would probably rate it a 3 or 4 (like Hubs).  I left out the walnuts and I used 1 cup regular size choc chips b/c I don't care for the minis.  I coated them with choc almond bark which is a must.  I put the leftovers in the freezer for a later date.  Mmmmmmm- I might have to pull one out now since I'm thinking about them.....

Thought these were really yummy - only change was that they got much too hard in the freezer.  I kept them in the fridge instead - still cold but didn't break your teeth.  I skipped the walnuts and added extra chocolate chips.  I let them set in the fridge until firm and then dipped them in melted chocolate.

These were ok. They were at least eaten by my family. Even though the taste was good, it seemed to be missing something
( I did add salt). Next time I'm going to experiment and try a normal chocolate chip cookie recipe (skipping the raw egg) and see how that turns out.

So yummy. I did like most other reviewers did and used 3/4 cups of white sugar and 3/4 cups of brown sugar. After I let them sit in the fridge for an hour, I dipped them in chocolate. Everyone loved them. I will def. make again as they are very easy to make and tasty

These were easy to make, but hard to eat when taken right from the freezer.  I covered these in melted semi-sweet chocolate, and then popped them back in the freezer.  A few hours later, we went to try them, and they were hard, almost too hard to bite.  After thawing for about 10 minutes, they are okay, but I think they would be better just in the refrigerator.

Yummy! We have made these several times- everyone loves them!  I add 1/2 tsp salt and soda to make them taste more like cookie dough.   I make these dairy free (with Earth Balance margarine) for my son with allergies.  I am planning on dipping the few that are left in candy coating (almond bark) to try that.  Kids love them and SUPER easy to make!  Thanks for sharing!  The kids ask for more everytime the bag in the freezer is empty.  I usually double the recipe (with no problems) so I'm not making them as often.  I've shared the recipe with several people- because everyone LOVES them!

These were a pretty big hit at a family party that my boyfriend and I brought them to.  We dipped them in chocolate and that is definitely a nice finishing touch.  They are a bit sweet and I would not want more than one, but overall a great recipe. :)

These are AMAZING! I added a little salt and baking soda to taste a bit more like real chocolate chip cookie dough. I didn't cover them in chocolate either as they really didn't need anything else. AMAZING!

I loved the brown sugar taste.  I think I would like to try adding chopped maraschino cherries or maybe just a 1/4 tsp maple flavoring for something different, but the basic recipes is good.

Oh my god I've died & gone to heaven!!!!! These were wonderful & deff a good treat to have when your craving cookie dough craving without worrying about the raw eggs! I was a little worried as people were saying the brown sugar taste was too strong but I made them exactly as written & they were phenomenal!  The only thing I did was different was using a whole bag of chocolate chips & adding a pinch on salt & baking soda for a more authentic cookie dough taste, then I dipped them in melted Hershey kisses. My hubby & I can't stop going back for more! I'm going to put them in some ice cream later tonight for a nice treat!!! Thanks for the amazing recipe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

My kids had a great time helping me make these!  We rolled them in bite sized balls and froze them for a couple of hours.  Then we dipped them in chocolate bark, and decorated with sprinkles and more mini chocolate chips.  I got the idea from a friend of mine, and this recipe worked perfectly for it.    Thanks!

A little too flour-y tasting even with the recommended added salt.  Will make againa and use a little less flour.  Big hit with the kids, regardless!

This was a nice project for my oldest and I to make together. We made them and froze them in bite-sized pieces and folded them into Five Minute Ice Cream.
(We didn't get to try any of it. Hubby demolished it all last night. He said it was awesome, though. I'd make this again for sure.)

My kids love them. They were a little rich for me so I only ate a couple. But they were still great. I followed the advice and mixed everything really good and they rolled fine. I also froze them for a few hours and they froze good. My kids keep asking me to make them again.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the fact that this recipe is egg-free. No worrying about salmonella (or whatever disease raw eggs spread, I'm not sure) I added a pinch of salt and a half pinch of baking soda. Makes a great ice cream topping too!

I am trying to go gluten free for health related issues. I substituted Splenda brown sugar blend for the brown sugar and rice flour for the white flour. They taste exactly the same. I love these for a sweet treat.

This recipe was okay, the first time that I made it it came out really crumbly. Then I made it a second time and only used 1 cup of flour and add a pinch of sugar. I is an okay recipe don't think I will ever make it again.

Made these for a friends birthday. They were super easy to make, the chocolate coating of course took a little extra time but it was totally worth it! The best part is now I have a ton left over that I can give to my friends for their upcoming birthdays!

These are SO simple!! I am making them for a BBQ in two days, and I am freezing them tonight, and will cover them with chocolate tomorrow! When I cover them, I just make a simple chocolate coating by using chocolate chips, nothing fancy, but it is still delicious! Thanks for this awesome recipe!

Not an outstanding recipe, but easy and pleasing to the taste. I agree with another reviewer that you need to let it freeze overnight (otherwise, it tastes too much like brown sugar). 
I substituted oil instead of butter and used half regular brown sugar and half Splenda brown sugar. It was easily moldable (though slightly crumbly when bitten into).

My friends and I thought these were pretty good.  I agree with another reviewer that I was expecting something awesome and instead got pretty good.  I dipped some in chocolate but that was kind of overkill.  They were better without the chocolate.  I do think it'd be great added to ice cream on a sundae bar though

Amazing! Definitely better when covered w chocolate. These were also a huge hit at work!  I also had inspiration from this to try other types of cookie dough the same way -- mint choc chips or peanut butter cookie dough.

These were fantastic and so easy to prepare! We dipped them in melted chocolate chips and ate them as confections. I'm thinking about adding them to some homemade vanilla ice cream this summer.

Loved these! Made at my daughters request for SuperBowl....Made these the day before, scooped about 55 dough balls with my small scoop and they were perfect, froze on a cookie sheet for an hour and then transfered to a freezer zip lock bag. Morning of SuperBowl, we dipped them in melted semi-sweet chocolate and kept chilled. A cookie dough lovers dream! So good! Thanks!

The night I made these I absolutely hated them, they tasted like flour and brown sugar mixed together. But still I decided to give them one more chance..... so i rolled them into balls and froze them. The following afternoon I tried them and they tasted just like the cookie dough in store bought ice cream and milkshakes! I think the key to making this recipe work is letting them sit in the freezer overnight.

I could barely get the dough rolled into balls because my husband and daughter were eating the  dough right out of the mixing bowl. I found that the frozen balls were a bit too hard and suggest letting them thaw somewhat before eating.  Otherwise, excellent!

I found this recipe and was so excited to be able to share it with my good friend who is allergic to eggs - she had never had cookie dough before! Unfortunately she has more self control than I do, and I ended up eating most of these tasty morsels. But oh well, the holiday season is all about overeating right?! I just can't resist the vanilla-brown sugar taste, it was heaven in my mouth.

These are a great cookie dough for eating since there is no raw egg!  The brown sugar flavor is prominent so if you are not crazy about brown sugar I would suggest swapping a little of it for white sugar.  I also added a dash of salt and baking soda as another reviewer suggested since my favorite chocolate chip recipe has these in it.  After rolling into balls I dipped mine into milk chocolate as shown in one of the pictures.  They were AMAZING!! I ended up keeping them in the refrigerator rather than the freezer because we wanted them soft enough to easily bite into.

I like this recipe a lot and use it frequently. I do make one important substitution – I use light brown muscovado sugar. I find this gives the dough even more flavour. Note that if you do use this, you should be able to partially or completely exclude the water – the sugar will be moist enough to bring the dough together. I also add a little salt and baking soda as suggested by others.  Thanks, KateLou for a great recipe!

We didn't care for this in our household it wasn't bad, but wasn't good either. too much of a brown sugar taste, I think if I make this again I'll use both brown and white sugar to see if it tastes more like the real thing and take others suggestions to use salt and baking soda as well, I didn't use walnuts and had to use more water than suggested. Updated: I have made these a couple times with both brown and white sugar and added salt and baking soda like others have suggested and it does taste like cookie dough, I'm leaving it at 3 stars since it's not the original recipe.

It doesn't taste the same as eating cookie dough with the egg in it but it can satisfy a sweet urge.  I didn't like the strong brown sugar taste and will try it next time with half brown sugar and half white sugar.  I also added 1-1/4 cups of mini chocolate chips instead of 3/4.  It is worth making, just needs some inhancing.

Very yummy. They do taste like brown sugar and I wonder if you can put az little less in and use regular surag instead. But they are very good.

I split the recipe in half since it is just me eating them.  The dough was real crumbly, but if you wet your hands often when rolling the dough it sticks together better.  They are good, they did not get too frozen, but then who wants to bite into hard dough?

Kids loved these, I added the 1/8 teaspoon salt as another reviewer suggested. I also melted and drizzled chocolate on top. You could add sprinkles inside with the choco chips that would be tasty too.

We love this recipe but I have a WARNING. I found out today that you should use heat-treated flour (never heard of it before) because regular flour might have bacterial contamination. I thought leaving out the egg made it safe but apparently not. We only made this once and LOVED it. Great for making something on a hot day and was easy for all the kids to make. Very sad about the flour issue but some sites say you can heat treat your own flour so that might be a good idea.

I love cookie dough, so these were great! I made some with the chocolate coating and some without for a Christmas party, and found that the ones without the coating were more popular! They are a bit hard to bite into when they come out of the cold, but I let them warm up for a good fifteen minutes and they were perfect. Will be making these again!

I would definitely make these again. I followed other recommendations to add 1/8 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda and did 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar. I also used 60% cacao dark choc chips with a little instant coffee added to it once melted to dip them in.

This is great. I too like another reviewer added a pinch or two of salt. I also melted semi sweet chocolate and dipped the frozen cookie balls. I added sprinkles on top which to my five year old tasted like frosting. Yum will definitely make again.

These were AWESOME AND DELICOUS! You should REALLY try these! I don't know why on the picture it has a chocolate coating on it because that's not the way it turned out for me. I didn't put in any chopped walnuts because I don't think I had any. By the way, I LOVE baking and I really recommend that you try this tasty baking recipe. I kept going into the freezer for more all the time. I just kept snacking on them all the time. There is also another good thing, it's that they make a lot! Oh, also another good thing is that the y are also AWSEOME when you don't freeze them. They taste technically the same. The annoying thing is that I didn't have any mini chocolate chips, though. The reason that it was annoying is because that when I took a bite into a chocolate chip, it was a little bit chewy on my teeth, but don't worry, because it probably won't work that way for you if you have mini chocolate chips. Please try these, you will be pleased.

I made these for home made cookie dough ice cream, so I can't comment on the chocolate coating. The dough is a bit dry and crumbly. However, if you squish it into a ball it does stay together. I did add about 1/2 tsp baking soda, because as another review said, most cookies have baking soda and it deffinately adds to the taste. These do not taste so great right out of the mixing bowl, however once I froze them they were absolutely delicious and in danger of being eaten before I could add them to my vanilla ice cream!

I found this recipe looking  for an edible raw cookie dough so I did not intend to dip or freeze these.  I substituted country crock for butter(all i had) and I think it may have solved the flavor issue some people mentioned in their reviews. This made the dough a bit runny, even without water, but it tastes fantastic so I will definitely be making this again next time I'm craving cookie dough!

Five thousand stars! I can't get enough of this stuff! I tried dipping the balls in chocolate the first time, but it didn't work out too well, so I just leave them plain. Since I don't dip them, I just roll the dough out into a log, freeze it, and cut it into slices. Fantastic frozen treat!

This cookie dough was not a hit in my family, and it would not be in any other in my opinion. I followed this recipe EXACTLY and it was stale! Also, when I first made them I put them in the freezer and when I pulled the them out to defrost for and hour before I served it to my guests, I came back and they were still rock hard I had to zap them in the microwave for 5 minutes before I could chew them! I will not serve or make this again!

I made this recipe a few days ago & it was delicious to all family! I used white chocolate chips which i melted & mixed in with the batter. I used an electric mixer to mix ingredients & it worked well. One thing though, I thought the batter would have been too messy to make balls with so I placed the batter by one spoon full in cupcake liners and froze. So I'm curious how others made these into balls. I'm wondering if this batter could be baked. That's for another day,lol

these are really good! they did start out a little dry and crumbly but just add a tablespoon or two of milk and you'll be good to go! When I did the chocolate I froze them for about 15-20 min than dipped them in chocolate and refroze.

They didn't taste good, the texture was off, even after following a few of the tips some users suggested for enhancing flavor such as adding sal.

So disappointed. Was dying to make this, as my husband and I always eat way too much cookie dough when I'm making cookies, which is often (and unhealthy with the raw eggs!) These were WAY too sweet and not in a good way. I guess the eggs make all the difference; maybe baking soda too, who knows.  I may try it again with others suggestions, but I followed the recipe exactly. So sad. :(

OMG!!! These barely made it to the freezer. Don't make these when your house is full of teenage boys. I did add 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp soda and used 3/4 c brown sugar and 3/4 c white sugar. Will definitely be making these over and over. Thanks

I followed the recipe exactly and they came out absolutely delicious. I was looking for something easy to satisfy a sugar craving and I was really happy with how these turned out.  I snuck a few spoonfuls before they hit the freezer :)

Easy recipe.  Flavor is okay, but not like refrigerated cookie dough from the store (which is what I was hoping for... I just wanted to make it myself).  I read many of the reviews before I made it and I added salt and baking soda.  It's still a bit bland and drier and more crumbly than I prefer.  My husband said the vanilla was too strong.  IF I decide to try this recipe again, I might use less flour and less vanilla.  Maybe it's better (and more moist) dipped in chocolate, as others have done, but I just wanted plain cookie dough.

Though I tinkered with the recipe slightly according to reviewers adding some salt.  It was still under-salted and lacking flavor.  I did learn something.  Be brand loyal with chocolate chips!  (I should have known this already) I got a bum batch and they didn't help.  I learned, I prefer cooked cookie dough.  There is something about the carmelization that occurs within the sugar butter mixture while cooking that I crave and missed in a cookie dough type recipe.   
I suspect this recipe was intended for salted butter with salt added.

... I wonder if these would be salvagable cooked with egg added...

Turned out really buttery & could barely form balls. Ended up adding more flour & some salt -as people in the comments suggested-, but it still didnt turn out very well. Doesnt taste like cookie dough at all. Will not be using this recipe ever again.

My entire family LOVES these. I made the eggless cookie dough for ice cream on this site before (it was good, but wasn't great.. most of it got freezer burn before we finished it so it ended up in the trash) and I have to say that this recipe is perfect on its own, not too gooey and not too dry. No weird after taste either. The only changes I made were adding a generous pinch of salt and I used splenda brown sugar (1/2 cup only because its twice as sweet) and 1/2 cup of white sugar instead of all 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar only because I didn't have any regular brown sugar on hand. I was planning on coating these with melted chocolate once they were frozen like some others have done but I'm not sure they will last long enough!

Mine were crumbly but only b/c i didnt cream the sugar and butter first. I just put it all in the mixer at once. Nothing a little water didnt solve. Goin to try and dip them in chocolate if I have the right kind.

I am one who loves cookie dough so when i found this recipe i was excited to try it. The recipe is very easy to make but the end result isnt the best. They are too sweet and you can only eat one before feeling full. I shared them at a party and noone was impressed with them, not to mention if you dont coat them in chocolate they are not very apealing looking

These definitely taste like cookie dough-I was all worried from the reviews.  But...they need a kick. I feel like if I'm going to the trouble of rolling them and freezing them there should be something a little more than just the cookie dough taste/texture.  I thought coating them in chocolate/freezing would do that...I think I'm gonna try spicing them up...maybe like a doomsday cookie type... Very good recipe to use for chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream though...

This is a decent cookie dough recipe. I made as-is except that I used 2T milk instead of 1T water, and added a pinch each of salt and baking soda. I think it was still a little too sweet, but not because of the amount of sugar. The brown sugar flavor was just a little overpowering so next time I think I'll substitute 1/2 cup of the brown sugar with white sugar. The flavor definately improves with freezing.

I made it (6 servings, without walnuts) and I found that it was far softer sweeter than I would have liked. I would have but more flour and less sugar in it. Mini MnMs are great instead of chocolate buttons.

Wow!  This is better than the cookie dough you get at ice cream and yogurt shops!  I can't wait to try it in ice cream!

Although this recipe was easy, I did not care much for it.  It just seemed to be lacking.  I wish I knew what to add to it to make it better.

I really love cookie dough, but this recipe just didn't cut it. They were dry, and once frozen were really hard. They also just didn't taste right. These would probably be ok mixed into ice cream, but they're just mediocre on their own.

this recipe is delicious!  i followed the recipe to a "T" and i kept going back to the freezer for more!  everytime i would go back, my husband would ask for one too.  not having to worry about the egg is really the key here...i plan to make them again, smaller, and add them to a homemade ice cream recipe.  i cant wait!
