This recipe was brilliant! I sub-ed out half the white chocolate chips for craisins, which I soaked in orange juice. I just put about 1/2 c of craisins into a bowl with about 1/2 c orange juice (or enough to cover) into the microwave and nuked it on high for 1 min and then dumped the contents of the bowl into the wet ingredients. It was the perfect combination of sweet and citrusy. Thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe but I did change it a little, I added 1 cup of cranberries (pre-soaked in orange juice) 1/2 cup of Macademia nuts and 1 teaspoon of Orange baking emulsion. I always freeze individual cookie dough balls (This always helps with stopping them going flat and also saves eating a whole batch at a time). Roll the dough into balls and place on a cookie tray in the freeer. Once frozen store in a zip lock bag until required. To cook simply place frozen dough balls on a baking tray and bake at 350 degrees for approz 25 mins. Perfect cookies everytime.

As far as I'm concerned, you couldn't make a better cookie!  These beautiful little gems are Incredible!  Moist, chewy, with a hint of orange, I mean, what is NOT to love about this one????
When I was a kid, my mom used to make these but instead of the orange zest, she would always put in a scoop of the frozen concentrated orange juice you would find at the grocery store.  I loved them then and I love them now!!!

I made these as a recipe selection for the Allrecipes Allstars this month. They reminded me a lot of a macadamia nut cookie without the macadamia. They had a slight orange taste, but it wasn't really pronounced. I personally prefer a softer slightly cake like cookie, where these are definitely more of a crispy and chewy cookie. I would even say they are quite greasy on the bottom. I believe it is from the amount of butter and the white chocolate. Only change I made was using a bar of real white chocolate, I chopped, and cutting the amount in half. Mainly, because I just find white chocolate to be too sweet. With half the recipe, I got 2 dozen cookies. Citrus and white chocolate, none the less, is an interesting combination and has inspired me to try citrus rind even more now in other recipes.

I thought these were great and very versatile.  I did change modify the recipe, just a little bit.  I added orange craisins (that I soaked in oragne juice) and to half the batter I added toasted cashews.  They were devoured!

These are fabulous cookies.  Chewy and moist with the perfect touch of orange flavor, these will be made often in this house.  I used a smidgeon more orange zest than requested in the recipe because I love citrus in baked goods.

Delicious. I did make a few changes - added 1/2 tsp vanilla, added about 1/2 cup chopped macadamia nuts and reduced white choc chips to 1.5 cups. They're like a white choc macadamia nut cookie... but with a little hint of orange that makes them outstanding. I might make these instead of my usual white choc macadamia nut cookie from now on! I used the zest from one medium-size orange, didn't measure it out exactly.

Yum! These cookies are fantastic! Very easy to mix together! I added a teaspoon of vanilla and baked in my convection oven at 350 for 8 minutes. They came out perfect! I also froze some dough for a quick cookie fresh from the oven.  This one's a keeper!

Moist, sweet, soft, simply yummy with just a hint of orange.  Perfect cookie IMO, wouldn't change a thing.  This will be on my Christmas cookie platters this year.

Super recipe! This turned out fantastic! I added a few extra tablespoons of orange concentrate from the freezer in place of the orange juice since I didn't have any, but followed the recipe as written otherwise. Delicious and baked nicely.

A delightful change from regular chocolate chip cookies.  The amount of orange was perfect. . .evident  but not overpowering.  I found them very addicting and was happy if I limited myself to 5 a day!

There's just one word for these cookies - Excellent! This is my new favorite. My husband has always been a fan of regular chocolate chip cookies and nothing else will usually do but he really liked these also. They would be great with macadamia nuts added. I can't wait to try them with lemon zest also. Yummo!

I don't care for white chocolate, so my rating and review are based on the comments from my husband and daughters.  They all thought these were five-star cookies and they loved the flavor the orange zest added.  I only had one cup of white chocolate chips, so I cut the recipe in half.  I didn't have any regular oranges, so I zested two "Cuties" (seedless mandarin oranges).  I didn't bother to measure the amount of zest, but figured it was approximately correct for half a recipe.  I'd love to try these with lemon zest, like other reviewers have said, and I'd also like to try them with semi-sweet chocolate chips and perhaps some dried cranberries.

After watching the video, I added more than the 2t of zest as mentioned as a choice-I zested a whole orange and got closer to 1T.  I used the juice from that orange to soak some dried cranberries then drained the juice so as not to make the dough too wet.  To test the recipe, I cooked a batch prior to adding the cranberries and it was 5* delish!  But adding the cranberries put these off the charts!

My husband and I really liked the flavor of the cookie part.  We both felt like it was missing something though.  I will definitely make these again, but, next time I will either add some macadamia nuts or dried cranberries.

These are tasty cookies. I really liked the mild orange flavor that comes through. I used a small cookie scoop and got 3 dozen cookies. Family really liked these. Only thing I would do differently is adding just a touch of vanilla. Very good.

What a nice twist on a chocolate chip cookie. I only have one suggestion...chill your dough for maybe an hour before you bake. My first batch ran together :(  I added macadamia nuts for some crunchy nuttiness and they were excellent. Next time, I will add an extra teaspoon of the orange zest. ONO!

VERY GOOD!  This was a nice combination of orange and vanilla.   In place of orange zest I used a spoonful of frozen orange concentrate as mentioned by another reviewer.  I was very pleased with the result.  Thank you Nestle Toll House for this recipe.

I made these with additions, based on reading several reviews: 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp chopped macadamias, extra 1 tsp of orange zest and juice of almost half an orange . I froze individual balls of dough for 20 minutes before baking. They turned out great! I gave it 4 stars because I doctored the recipe.

Pretty good cookie.  I halved the recipe and still did 1 egg.  I don't think I'm dying to make it again though. I recommend trying it if you really love white chocolate and orange together. I added a few dried cranberries, that was a good suggestion.

Made these for Christmas, unfortunately they were passed by for all the chocolatey peanut butter type cookies...shame on them, these have a nice soft texture and a subtle orange flavor.  I will make them again by themselves so all the peanut butter freaks will see there are other good flavors to enjoy!

Rockin' awesome.  Had a 1/2C of orange pulp (from filtering out some OJ) and used that in place of 1/4C of the butter (sounded too greasy as written).  Also added a little honey.  The batter is scrumptious and good luck eating just one cookie!

This recipe is fantastic.  My second favorite of all time.  I am not a chocolate chip fan, so when I saw this recipe I was happy to try it.

These taste like dreamsicles, according to my sister.  They are yummy, but be careful zesting those oranges, I had a couple zested knuckles for my troubles.  I'd be interested to see how these taste with milk or semi-sweet chips.

I took the ideas from this recipe and converted it to a muffin recipe. They turned out fantastic.  In addition to the white chips, I added the orange juice soaked craisins.  Everyone loved them and went back for more.  Next time, I will try to make the cookies, but, with the muffins as big of a hit as they were, it may be a go to recipe from now on.

I made about 6 dozen of these and they were gone in about 3 days.  Made them with white chocolate and also dark.  Will definitely make these again, and I think the addition of the crasins would be wonderful.  will try that next time.  this one is a keeper.

The orange flavor was barely detectable. Too many white chocolate chips. These were almost too sweet. Maybe macadamia nuts would improve the taste. Or perhaps a touch of cinnamon.

I seriously loved this recipe, but ohh so rich with the chips ;-) the orange zest was mild, suttle and soo there, it really shined through lightly. I decided, I'll make again totally and ad more zest a few teaspoons of fresh squeezed orange juice...YUM! Outstanding so far as it is.

These are great - I think I might add some orange extract next time.  I used vanilla to add a little extra flavor. These would be really good with macadamia nuts as well.  A keeper I'll make again for sure!

I really didn't like these that much. I wanted to...but I'll just say that almost all of them are still in my cookie tin, and I made these cookies four days ago. They were way too sweet for me. I think they might be better if you did half macadamia nuts and half white chocolate chips, but I doubt I will make them again to find out.

These were very good, but for some reason they reminded me more of a sugar cookie than anything else. Next time I will add more orange into it and perhaps a dash of vanilla extract as well. Still very tasty though! :)

Not your usual cookie!  The hint of orange in these made them very special.  They have a great texture, and were very well received!  For me, though, they are a little too sweet.  I followed the recipe exactly, except for zesting a whole orange, which yielded a tablespoon of zest.  Cooking time is accurate, and I made 31 three-inch cookies.

These are yummy! I made a very slight change, using grated clementine peel in place of a regular orange. These baked up to be very moist and the flavor combination is delicious. Almost reminds of those solid chocolate orange candies you can buy at Christmastime. These will definitely become part of my normal cookie rotation.

I'll admit that I was VERY skeptical about these, since I'm not a huge fan of white chocolate.  However, I got a couple of free oranges at work, already had the white chocolate chips from another recipe, and needed another cookie to put in my Christmas cookie baskets.  So, you guessed it, I made these - and they're delicious!  The orange flavor really counteracts the sweetness of the white chocolate to make a light-tasting cookie.  I also added probably 2 TBSP of fresh orange juice and 1/2 tsp of vanilla.  I think the juice really gave it a great punch.  I'm toying with the idea of doing these with lemons,also.  Regardless, out of the 5 different cookies I made, I expected to like this the least and I actually like it the best.  Simply awesome!

I added Macadamia nuts and that really stepped these up a notch.  Using a #24 scoop I got 18 large cookies.  Baked at 350 for 12 minutes, the cookies were perfectly cooked.

A nice, light-tasting cookie, if there is such a thing!  The hint of orange is perfect, but I did add a tablespoon or so of fresh-squeezed from the orange I grated with no change in consistency in the cookie.  They are beautiful and yummy.

I made these as directed, but I added a little extra orange zest and about a teaspoon of orange juice concentrate. They came out very good.

Perfect! I made this exactly as-is and these cookies turned out beautifully at 10 minutes in my oven. I will definitely be making these again, except doubling the recipe!

These were very well received. I think I wish they had a little more orange flavor, but quite tasty as written.

My family loved it but it tasted a little lemony to me and not so much orange.

I love the fresh orange zest in these. It's the perfect amount for my taste. This is a great cookie for a Christmas tray or even a ladies tea. It's delicate and not heavy on the chocolate.

These cookies are outstanding! I added the juice of half a orange to add a little more flavor. They was so moist & chewy an can't wait to make them some more.

A little too floury for me (followed the recipe to a T) but I'm not counting that as I'm not a huge cookie person. Those I cooked them for (husband and kids) LOVED them. Hubby stated 'They are awful, I must dispose of them as quickly as possible' - while stuffing one in his mouth and grabbing two more. A quick and easy cookie that should please any cookie lover!

As is these cookies do not have enough orange flavor for our personal preference but they are still good. I added a splash of organic orange extract, a splash of vanilla (I cannot make a cookie without vanilla)and the juice of a orange. I chilled the dough before baking. Plus I probably had a full tablespoon of zest and these were perfect for us.

These came out really well.  I halved the recipe but added the whole egg and they were fine.  Love the orange flavor in these as it was fairly subtle.   Will certainly make again!

These cookies came out great! They are soft and chewy. I did use the zest from a whole orange so it was about 2 1/2 tsp. The orange flavor came through wonderfully. I was a little nervous about the white chips as I am more of a chocolate person but they tasted so good in these cookies! I will definitely be making these again and I will be passing along the recipe! Thank you Nestle for a fantastic cookie!

These are incredibly yummy!  They are soft and very moist- the orange flavor very delicate and just a lovely complement to the white chocolate.  I love them!!!  These will be featured on my holiday cookie plates for sure, and I have no doubt I will be making them often :)

We've been making these since my childhood.  If you like this flavor combination you just can't go wrong.  I always add a bit more zest and sometimes dribble in a little oj as well depending on my mood.  As written, the recipe is light and delicate.  They are among the first to go on a cookie tray.

Winner, winner!  These are delicious!  I zested one whole orange which came to just under 2 tsp of orange zest. Such a nice change of pace from the usual cookie. A light orange flavor combined with the creaminess from the white chips. On an airbake pan, these took about 14 mins. These won't get real dark, so take them out when they get a light hint of color.

These are certainly good. But IMO not 5 stars worth. Taste just like chocolate chip cookies only if you substituted white chocolate chip and added a pinch of orange. Very good... but not great.

I just made these cookies and they are absolutely delicious.  Maybe my favorite cookie that I've made.  I squeezed a couple Tbsp of juice from the orange into the dough.  Wow.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.
