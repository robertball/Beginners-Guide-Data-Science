DELICIOUS!!!!! I used 1 jar of home canned apples and made it into "apple pie filling" by following the recipe called Apple Pie Filling (skipped cooking the apples as mine were already cooked). This made enough filling for TWO cheesecakes. I also made my own graham cracker crust and added chopped pecans to the crust.  It was an easy recipe to follow. If followed exactly, it will not fail! The pecans in the crust AND mixed into the caramel topping were the two things I added that made this even more outstanding than as written! Seriously, use pecans!! The best part is this cheesecake doesn't have to set overnight! It was ready to eat 2 hours after coming out of the oven. 1 hr to cool to room temperature, add topping, cool in fridge 1 more hour, DONE.

This was the first "real" cheesecake I ever made.  My family loved it!!  I did make one change:  I omitted the pecans.  We aren't really nut people, and it didn't make sense to me why they were there in the first place.  Otherwise:  super easy and VERY yummy!!

For my diabetic husband I make this with home made pie filling using sugar substitute and Smuckers sugar free caramel topping.  It is delicious.

This is a delicious cheesecake.  I found I needed to adjust the baking time to 45 - 50 minutes.  Best to watch for doneness as oven temps varying.

this cheesecake had the perfect consistancy, not too soft not too hard and was super delicious!! The only thing I did wrong was I used caramel syrup and really needed to be caramel topping so it would be thicker but it was still one of the best cheesecakes I have ever had

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a complete hit.  No crumbs left on the plate.  I used Grandma Ople's apple pie recipe for the filling with granny smith apples.  Complete hit!  Pretty much followed the recipe to a T, this was a winner for sure!

I made this for my partners Birthday he loved it. It was very easy to make. I did take out the pecans my partner is not a nut person. I really like baked cheesecake allot better than instant ones. You could even just take the cake recipe and do with it what ever you want.

Pretty good - next time I will chop the apple filling into small pieces instead of leaving in slices.  Was really well received for how little prep time is involved.

Awesome! My 9 year old daughter & I made this Cheesecake for a party this week. Everyone at the party raved about how perfect and yummy this dessert was.   They said it was better than restaurant quality and I would have to agree.  The recipe and the tips were easy to follow.  The 2 comments or instructions I would add : Do not use a mixer when mixing the cream cheese mixture it starts to curdle; we stopped the mixer and used a whisk which did break down most of the curdles and smoothed out the mixture. We also placed a glass dish with 2 inches of water in the rack underneath the cheesecake when it was in the oven to keep the cheesecake top from cracking which I lis a technique that came from cooks country. This cheesecake is a winner and a keeper!

AWESOME....The only thing I did extra was sprinkle some cinnamon-sugar over top of the apples before the cream cheese filling was added and I used 1 regular package of cream cheese and 1 lower fat version! Everyone loved it!  Will definitely make again!

My college-age daughter requested that I make cheesecake the first time her boyfriend was visiting our family.  I found this recipe and selected it because I had a very busy day with limited time.  Everyone loved it!  It was so easy, but so delicious, and not too heavy.  I will definitely make it again.

This was a hit!  I did make a couple of adjustments though... I used the Sauteed Apples recipe from this board instead of canned - just can't bring myself to used canned more than necessary.  I also toasted my pecans first, and only put strategic blobs of topping on the top of the pie rather than cover the whole thing.  Lastly, I melted a few caramels and added a tsp. or two of milk, to make the caramel drizzle for the top.  This is a rich and delicious dessert!

This is AMAZING!  I love it.  The texture of the cheesecake itself is super creamy and delicious!  I followed the recipe perfectly, but I added chopped walnuts and almonds because I didn't have the pecans.

This dish was amazing. I only left out the pecans because my daughter is allergic. Otherwise I made it exactly like it said. I took one to my in-laws for Mother's Day and it was a big hit. I will definitely be making this again.

Turned out perfect.  We used our own canned apple pie filling and it was a perfect change to your ordinary cheese cake topping.

I came across this recipe after seeing a $30.00 8 inch caramel apple cheesecake in one of those holiday catalogs. Never made cheesecake before, and it came out perfect! Next time I'll use less apples so I can taste the actual cheesecake more.

Sometimes I do not read the directions to a recipe!  Yep, this was one of those times - I put the topping on "before" I baked it - so my cheesecake took longer to bake.  Easy recipe and tasted great (in spite of my directions mistake).  Will look forward to making it the right way too.

I made this with a little twist...instead of the 9in pie crust I use the mini crust so everyone could have their own little pie and it was VERY good. However as one of the other viewers said the cheescake mix could use just a tad bit more sweetness maybe a tablespn or two. I will be making again and again. Thanks for sharing.

Everyone that tried it LOVED it! I think that the cheese cake layer itself needed to be a tad sweeter. It's good the way it is but I might trying adding a little more sugar to the cheese cake layer next time.

The only thing I did differently was make my own graham cracker crust. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it is deeeelish! I made it for Thanksgiving and my family is always asking me to make it for other family get togethers!

Excellent! I used one package Neufatchel and one regular cream cheese and it worked very well. Doubled the vanilla and made my own crust (Graham Cracker Crust I from this site). Super easy and delicious. Thanks! :)

Absolutely luscious.  I made my own apple pie filling from Pink Lady Apples and took this to My daughters house for our supper dessert.  All three of her young boys loved it..........and so did the rest of us.  Oh, I left out the nuts because of the little ones eating it.

I’m not a cheesecake person, but I went to a Bakers Square and tried an apple cheesecake. It was wonderful. As the years pasted I’ve tried to find a recipe that is equivalent to this cheesecake. And finally this is the one. My family always raves about this cheesecake. I making 4 for Christmas.

I made this tonight and the end result was perfect, and the taste  was Delish!!! The only difference I made was instead of mixing last of the apples with the topping in the sauce pan. I warmed them separately, plus added  caramel drizzle as a last decoration. My husband really, really loved this cheesecake!  Its easy to make and we definitely will be making this again. I did have to cook a little longer than the recommended 35 min. to set.  (ovens vary)!  Great dessert for church and family functions! Thanks for posting!!!

First time making this and it came out Awesome. I had friends over and they loved it. I did make some changes, I made 3. 8oz cream cheese instead of 2, I wanted it very rich. Added ground cinnamon to the mix. Also added evaporated milk to caramel sauce! I will make it again, it did have a crack in it but when I added the filling it wasn't noticeable.

Best cheesecake ever! I made it exactly as the recipe called for with two changes: The store only had salted caramel topping which was awesome in this and I don't like nuts on cheesecake so I crushed up a SKORS bar on it.....This is a great recipe! I let it set for 24 hours in the refrigerator......Thank you for posting!

Super good!  Added some chopped pecans to my Carmel topping and sprinkled some on top.  Delicious.  So easy to make!  This was a huge hit at the office.

I've been making this cheesecake for a year now and I now make my own crust and caramel.  I also make caramel frosting and use that on the sides.  Everyone loves this whenever I make it.

Delicious! I made this as stated except i used Luck's Fried Apples instead of Lucky Leaf.  I also cooked them to soften them a little.  It turned out perfect.  My husband and I loved it.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I am dairy intolerant and gluten intolerant so I needed to make a few adjustments but I am happy to report that this is a great recipe.  I substituted soy "cream cheese" and made a gluten-free graham cracker crust.  Did need to increase the baking time to 45min but it turned out spectacular!  Thank you for sharing.

This was a really good recipe. Took longer to bake than what is called for, I baked mine for about 50 minutes, but very good taste and fairly easy to make. Recipe worth keeping.

This is amazing!  My daughter, who does not like caramel, loved it.  I also made my own graham cracker crust with pecans in the crust and baked it in a springform pan.  It was very simple to make and incredibly delicious.

i made this for a holiday party and it was a big disappointment. i i added 10 minutes of baking time (which was unusual because my oven tends to run hot) and even though the cheesecake seemed to be set, ithe middle had a runny consistency. it looked pretty with the topping on it but the taste was off. i followed the recipe exactly.

I made this into a regular springform style CC....
I made my own crust with a mixture of ground up churro cinnamon almonds and sea salt cashews...unsalted butter and crushed  vanilla wafers... I reserved some of the ground nut mix to decorate edges of top just before I "de-ringed" it! I also used an old fashion tater masher on the apple filling before used it, made the chucks smaller and much prettier as a finished top...

I left the pecans out for the sake of budgeting. I thought this was great but got mixed reviews. My husband (who is not a fruit fan anyway) spit his out, my picky 5 yo would not eat it bc it was brown, my 2 yo and 9 yo LOVED it. Definitely worth trying! I also chopped up the apples for the top a little finer so that they would fit the top better. And the cheese cake portion does make more that needed! It makes almost double of what you need.

Made this recipe into muffin size to take to a potluck dinner.  Eliminated all the cutting and serving.  They were we a huge hit!  Mission accomplished ... not one to take home to tempt me

This was super delicious but I made mine with all (scratch) ingredients . I didn't have any canned apples or ready made pie crust so I think that made it even better.
