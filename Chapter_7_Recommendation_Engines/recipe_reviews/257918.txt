This was easy and fun to make; however, my omelette didn't look as pretty as the one shown (not sure if my pan was too large or the eggs too small - used a 9 inch sauce pan and Grade A Eggland's Best large eggs) but was still delicious!

As far as making omelette a go this was pretty simple and easy to manage. One thing I will say is if you don’t have a gas stove top have one burner set to medium high and turn another on low when you pour the eggs into the buttered pan that way you don’t over cook but you’re also not waiting for another burner to heat up. I filled my omelette with barbecued sausage and smoked paprika on top. Delicious!

I watched the video before making this omelette, which I’d really suggest! It makes everything very clear since this is very much a technique based recipe. My omelette came out really nicely on my first try! Easy and delicious, and pretty impressive looking when you cut into it. I feel like this will take me a few tries to perfect but it’s a great technique to know, and this recipe explains it clearly.

I have to work on technique, to perfect it, need to not "scramble" too much and remember to turn heat down. Butter makes them good, I don't add as much either -just a calorie thing, and I use 1/2 egg whites too.

Diet time trying this recipe and it is very tasty. I used garlic salt instead of regular salt and white pepper at the end. I think I stirred, litter and rolled correctly but I did have problems rolling it into a cylinder at the end and it ended up cracking on the second roll lol. It didn’t hurt the taste any and since it was for me I didn’t care. I’ll def keep making omelets this way because I didn’t burn one side of it.  Lol. I also added cracked black pepper cheese to the inside and paprika ontop when it was done because i didn’t have cayenne pepper. Thank you for the technique and recipe.

Another great recipe from Chef John! I actually found that medium high heat on my stove was too much heat and the omelette cooked too quickly, next time I will be try cooking on medium heat only. I also added some parsley to my omelette to give it a bit more flavour, it turned out wonderfully!

This rating is for you, as you couldn't have prepared it better; I rate mine about a 3 as I used cast iron pan and it was impossible to reduce / turn off the heat. Although she liked it, my wife said she never wants it again... "to much butter". We like the over-cooked, dry, typical American style omelet stuffed with cheese and other goodies, eh! Thanks very much for sharing this style.

He's right, it's delicious!! My girlfriend who is not a fan of eggs, really enjoyed this omelette. It came out justtt a little too salty, but that's because I used table salt. Lower it just a tad and it will be perfect

I made this two days in a row: once as a quick dinner for myself, and the next day for my husband’s birthday breakfast. I couldn't resist: I filled it with Chef John’s amazing "Proper Pesto". Wonderful. I only used two eggs, which makes it a little trickier (thinner, depending on the size of the pan, and prone to tearing) but it still rolled beautifully.

I am never going to eat regular scrambled eggs again! I made this exactly as written the first time and the second time I added salt, pepper and shredded swiss cheese right before I folded it together. Both were amazing! I also agree with another comment about how yes, there is a lot of butter. Do not omit it or try to cut back on it, the butter and the slow cooking is what makes these eggs literally melt in your mouth.

I just finished my plate of wonderful egginess,. Yes, there is  lot of butter in this dish. Yes,  you need it. No, do not cut back on it to make it "healthier." If you want healthy, eat a head of lettuce. This is a completely decadent meal that you'd make to treat yourself or your family once in awhile, not to be eaten every morning. Watch the video, follow Chef John's technique and you can't go wrong. It was my first time making this just now and it turned out looking exactly like the one in the video.  It was beautiful, fluffy, custardy and delicious.

This is delicious. I probably need a more flexible spatula, though, to scrape the egg from the sides of the pan. Also, I think I had the heat too high, even though I used the medium high heat setting on my stove. The end result looked the same except it was a little flatter. It was delicious, but I think I’ll use less butter next time to cut calories.

Excellent! This omelette is heaven. Once I got past the lack of add-ins, I found this to be the perfect omelette. Whisking for the right amount of time is critical. Nailed the rolling first time, beginners luck. Things happen fairly quickly as the eggs set up, so be ready! The stinger-linger of the cayenne is fantastic, too.
I want to make a couple of more, but I'll force myself to wait until tomorrow. Sorry, no photo, the omelette disappeared.
EDIT: I've made these MANY times now. My wife is fanatic about them. She had me add some ham once, then decided they were best as is. I found that if they are cooked past the "custardy" level Chef John mentions, the taste isn't nearly as good. I cook them until I think they are not done enough, then they continue to cook just a bit while being plated. Perfect. The secret is a low heat so the bottom doesn't get well done like a regular omelette. They really do need the melted button on the top for ultimate flavor.

Made my first omelette with this recipe. It was decadent for sure!  I used jumbo eggs and it was very nice. The most challenging part is getting the heat level right, especially if the stovetop doesn’t heat evenly. I used medium heat because of my fussy burner. Overall it turned out very well and I will make again.

Delicious.  Definitely takes more than one try to get it right.  Medium-high heat was too high and the butter starter to bubble before entirely melted.  Will try heating at medium next time.

I'm sorry Chef John, but medium high was too hot for me. It cooked way too fast, and *poof* it turned into scrambled eggs! So with a dash of pepper and two slices of toast, I had my very own traditional "oops" scrambled eggs on toast! 

With that said, I had the toast with the most - scrambled eggs on top. And I enjoyed it! Happy days!

I made it , it tasted awesome but it turned out like scrambled eggs (the best scrambled eggs I've ever had) it was because I used to big of a pan and don't have a spatula
