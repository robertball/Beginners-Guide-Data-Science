I chopped up potatoes rather than using a packaged version, also used pork sausage  rather than andouillle, used a bottled pork gravy, no jalapenos as my wife doesn't like spicy

I didn't make any changes this time. But next time I won't  bake it so long once I put the cheese on, maybe about 5 minutes and then check. Also once the fried eggs are on there, I may put it back in the oven for a couple of minutes.

This was delicious. I made this recipe minus the hot peppers. I added a yellow onion and mushrooms to the sausage . I added 3 cups of gravy to the sausage and mushrooms. I put it in a 9x11 pan to make it more compact. I put on scrambled eggs because my husband doesn’t like runny yokes. I’m sure they would be delicious as well. It was a yummy brunch meal.
