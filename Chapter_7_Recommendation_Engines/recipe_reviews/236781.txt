This was wonderful!  The store was out of chorizo, so I bought spicy Italian sausage.  I had never heard of smoked paprika, so now I have some on hand. I used regular white vinegar instead of red wine vinegar and tossed in some extra red bell peppers that I had on hand.  This recipe is a keeper.  Hubby wants more meat next time, and now that I know it turned out, I'll play with the veggies and the spices. This was very easy to make, the hard part was the wonderful smell while it was simmering!  Hard to wait. EDITED: Edited to add that I've now made this a number of times.  Done it with Chorizo and hambuger,  , Chorizo and sausage, and hamburger and sausage.   We've played the spice rack like a xylophone and had the veggies chunked, diced, added and subtracted.  The basic recipe is awesome and playing with it does not hurt it.

Pacific Cuban Black Beans & Rice Haiku: "Better than 5 stars. Even my 6 year old loved. WILL make this again!" I halved the recipe for 3 of us, and only swapped chorizo for smoked sausage, and picante sauce for salsa; otherwise, everything else remained as the recipe submitter wrote, and We. Loved. This. Served over brown basmati (would've loved to have had the time to take Fancy Nancy's suggestion of adding cilantro and lime juice to the rice!) and there was not a single bite of leftover.

I made a vegetarian version of this recipe including all ingredients except the meat, and to cut back on sodium, I used cayenne pepper instead of a jar of picante sauce. It was delicious! I made it for a large group of people, and many returned for seconds. Several said that it tasted like authentic Cuban black beans and rice, and it was among the best they had eaten! I surrounded the dish with several garnish options including fresh cilantro, jalapeños, salsa, limes, and scallions- along with an assortment of hot sauces- and people loved it. I saved the recipe and will definitely make it again. Thank you!

This was great. I accidentally bought plain uncooked chorizo so I had to sauté it first before adding it to the beans. Even without the smoked flavor that would have been added by the smoked chorizo this was still very good and tasty. I can't wait to make it again with the correct type of chorizo. I bet it's going to be amazing.

These beans can also be served as a side dish without the rice. Add more vinegar for extra tang.

It was delicious and i will definitely make it again ! I used regular sausage and added a bit more cumin...because we love cumin. Topped with sour cream finishes it off!

What an amazing recipe.  The only thing I would change is to place making the rice at the end instead of at the beginning.  Overall I would change absolutely nothing about the ingredients and taste though, absolutely loved it.  the best part is you can add medium or hot picante sauce if you desire something even more spicy.  very great recipe.

Made this Christmas Eve for our eclectic celebration. To make it vegetarian friendly, I used vegetable broth, eliminated the chorizo and added 1 T of liquid smoke to add some depth to the broth. It was delicious!

Totally different flavor than any other black beans I have ever eaten. For the beans, we made our own salsa from scratch and used smoked ham and no sausage. I used balsamic vinegar and this gave it a really different taste. I didn't have canned beans, so I made that from dried beans. This is a must try recipe. Thanks Fancy Nancy!

This turned out so good! I used linguisa since I didn't have Spanish chorizo, which I browned and drained before adding it to the beans and veggies. I didn't have cilantro either, but it would have been a nice addition.

Very good!! My family has instructed me not to ever change the recipe and they’ve all gone back for seconds- high praise in this house.  I waited to make the rice until the bean mixture started to simmer so everything would be done around the same time.  I also sliced the chorizo sausage and browned it first, then set it aside.  Rather than using olive oil to sauté the veggies I just sautéed them in the little bit of grease left behind from browning the chorizo.  I also followed the tip and added butter and lime juice to the rice, sadly I was out of cilantro- but next time I’ll try it!

Easy  recipe and very flavorful.  Did a small dice on the chorizo but that's all I changed. Reminiscent of the flavors of traditional Cuban food during recent trip

Great recipe. I used chorizo crumbled, and salsa instead of picante sauce. We topped it with chopped tomatoes and sour cream. Super yummy! Cilantro and lime juice on the rice gives it a great touch!

It's gooood! We added an extra sausage link. And I accidentally used a tablespoon of salt so I had to tone it down a bit with a can of kidney beans from our pantry. Even with these modifications it was delicious!! I love these kind of meals to cook and portion out ahead of time for our busy family.

Absolutely loved this.  I used andouli sausage as our store was out of chorizo.  I am sure it made a little flavor difference, but it was still great. I used yellow rice as that is what my husband and I love and maybe next time I will use white rice.  I bought cilantro and then forgot to use it.  But I will use it next time, and there will be a next time, absolutely.  I had HOT picante sauce in the house and used that.  Maybe next time I will use a milder sauce.  But we still ate it all. Whew!

This was fantastic! Delicious and super healthy with all the vegetables. I didn't have chorizo, so I used Aidells smoked chicken habanero sausages that I had on hand. My entire family LOVED it and even asked that I put the leftovers in their lunches the next day. I didn't see the suggested garnishes. It definitely didn't need them, but I will try them the next time I make it.

This was THE BOMB! The only thing that I changed was to use mild Italian sausage and no pepper flakes, as we don't care for spice. I accidentally added the cilantro and lime juice to the bean mixture instead of the rice, since Nancy's footnotes were not included when I printed the recipe. The flavor was kind of lost in the bean mixture, but it was still SOOO good! I can't wait to do it right next time.

I don't like spicy foods so I made this with a mild picante and I liked it. This was a little bit more elaborate than I was looking for but I will likely make it again. Certainly would make it to impress someone that I can cook!

Yummy.  Will make again.  I used andouille sausage because that's what I had in the fridge.  Also added 1 small zucchini because it was sitting there in the veggie drawer.  Served over Lime Cilantro Rice (also on this site) and garnished with lots more cilantro, green onion tops, a drizzle of lime juice and sour cream.    The andouille was very spicy, so I did not add red pepper flakes, and I used lime juice instead of vinegar, and added a bit of lime zest and 1 teaspoon of sugar.

Did very little tweaking.  Was awesome served over yellow rice.  Next time I would add 1 more can of beans to the double batch.  Used a cornstarch slurry to thicken it near the end of cooking.  Will definitely make again.  (Tweaks in my notes)

VERY, nicely done. I used Andoulli sausage but stayed true to the recipe in every other way. Turned out fantastic. I made this dish about a week ago, and will be making it again next week. Everyone loved it.

Such an easy and incredible tasting dish. I make it a couple of times a month and vary it depending on what's in my fridge. The recipe starts with 'make the rice' but to save time I make the bean and broth part first and while that's cooking then start working on the rice.

My 'meatless-Mondays vegetarian version uses vegetable stock and skips the sausage and doubles carrots and/or peppers. Still delish. Today's version I used  half a box of prepared liquid Pho soup broth and a can of diced tomatoes including the juice. I didn't have celery so I used a cup of chopped red cabbage. I also prefer Basmati rice (with cilantro and lime added just before serving). 

However you style your own recipe you won't be disappointed. This is a terrific, healthy, high-protein recipe. Enjoy!

I used 12oz of chorizo, added 2 fresh jalapenos, and had to mix my beans - I only had 1 can of black beans so also used a can of garbanzo. The rest was exactly as written.  We both had 2nds and I woke up thinking about have more.

Substituted ground sausage and family loved it. My picky teen daughter asked for chicken next time. We served over crushed tortilla chips and it was awesome.

Other than waiting for it to cook, it was quick to prepare, and the wait was worth it. My family of four enjoyed it and the leftovers were even better than the original. I ate without the rice, because I am avoiding carbs.

The only deviations I made was using just standard smoked sausage instead of chorizo. Also, I had some diced pineapple that I added to the rice to give it a little flavor. Finally, I did not have smoked paprika, so I used standard and added a splash of liquid smoke.

This recipe was a winner!  I just made a few changes. I doubled the recipe as I took it to a family birthday party.  I substituted the picante sauce with one  10 oz can of hot Rotel and one 10 oz can or original Rotel.  I didn't have a red bell pepper so I used some mini bell peppers that I had on hand.  Also I added liquid smoke since I didn't have smoked chorizo and added a couple of bay leaves.  It was a hit.  Thank you Fancy Nancy.

I love cuban rice and beans and this way out did my recipe.  I always serve mine with a fried egg and fried plantain banana. Budget friendly and great for those who can't eat meat. I use the Tofurky Italian sausage.

Very customizable and everyone at the table enjoys. We make the recipe as stated, although we do add some more sausage as we find the initial amount a bit sparse for the carnivores in the house. Kids enjoy spicy, which is great, because this definitely has a kick. It is very easy to add, edit or substitute as your taste preferences warrant. We always make our rice in the rice cooker first, can't beat the texture and flavour for us when we prepare that method.

This was delicious.  I used smoked sausage because my local grocery store didn't have the chorizo and it was still very flavorful.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was delicious and easy to make.

I've made this recipe twice now and it's a huge hit in our house. My 8 year old is a very picky eater and even he gave it "9 Thumbs Up." Easy, nutritious and full of flavour. I used regular tomato sauce instead of the picante sauce, and we serve it on top of quinoa or wild rice.

I sauteed the chorizo for about 10 min. I also used salsa in place of the picante. I halved this recipe, and made the rice that the submitter suggested.

Absolutely delicious! Rolled up in a tortilla for my 3 1/2 year old and served over rice for us. Will be in regular rotation as one of our meatless meals.

Great recipe Fancy Nancy.  Followed your recipe exactly (except for celery - didn't have any but will add it next time) Really enjoyed the rice tip too (I did...my son not so much).

Didn't have everything on hand so omitted celery and bell pepper. Used extra carrots. Used regular paprika. For meat, crumbled in a couple cooked sausage patties and cut up 4 hot dogs. I recommend starting off with less salt and pepper--I used half what was recommended, and it was perfect for us.  Even my toddler loved it!

I came across this recipe looking for something to accompany the green plantain I had purchased on impulse (I made tostones with it). Since I had the chorizo and black beans, this looked perfect, and it was!  I think this recipe would also work for vegetarian friends if I use vegetable stock, leave out the chorizo and add additional smoked paprika to make up for the lost smokiness of the sausage. I will definitely make this again.

This was amazing! My whole family loved it. I did substitute one can of Rotell  tomatoes for the Picante sauce (we didn't have any.) I didn't add the chicken stock, I worried it would be too soupy.
