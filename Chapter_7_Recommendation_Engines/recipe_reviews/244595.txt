I absolutely cannot wait for colder weather to try this soup!  I'm glad I made it;  I followed the recipe exactly except  for the following changes.
 Pour in two thirds of the beans,  reserve one third of the beans, and allow to heat through.  Remove sausage,   Pour the bean & broth mixture into a blender, and blend on high  for about 30 seconds.  Return broth mixture to pan,  add the remaining one  third of the beans, sausage and kale.  Allow to heat through and serve.

I chopped up the kale, used ground turkey (and doubled what the recipe called for), put in red pepper flakes, and I didn't have any onion so I used onion flakes instead. Oh, and I put in 2 cloves of garlic and used Italian seasoning as all we had here in Edmonton was regular chicken broth. Turned out great and my husband said he loved it!

Reading the ingredients, I thought this sounded good. Our church small group was having an Italian themed potluck dinner and I figured a lot of people would bring pasta dishes, so I would give this a try. Unfortunately, the Tuscan Chicken Flavor Infused Broth was very overpowering and it was the only things I could really taste. I did not enjoy this, and apparently not many others did either. I brought home a pretty full crock pot.  I would suggest to others who may want to make it to use regular chicken broth and then season to your taste so that you can savor all the flavors of the dish.

Easy to follow and make, simple prep and quick to make. 
The only thing I had to change is cook the onions a bit longer about a minute or two.
Other than that this is quite a simple delicious recipe children and adults love it.

I add about 2 tablespoon of Worcestershire and  1/2 c or so of ditalini noodles. I finish it with the juice of one lemon. My husband LOVES it! Oh, I sub the make with frozen spinach too

This was simple and good. I sliced the chicken sausage rather than removing the casings. Will definitely make again.

I used baby spinach and regular chicken broth and added crushed red pepper, good easy weeknight meal.  I added more spinach as it cooked because we love veggies, but then you have to add more spices!

This was pretty good. I think the Swanson Tuscan Chicken Flavor infused broth made the dish very tasty. I used ground turkey so I needed a flavor boost. Healty too! Will make again!

This was a little too "herby" for our tastes. Maybe using a plain sausage, rather than an Italian-style one, that is already full of Italian herbs would help remedy this. Another thing that was a bit off was the amount of kale. I purchased 1 bunch of fresh kale, and pulled the leaves from the stems and weighed them on my kitchen scale. The leaves of the entire bunch only weighed about 5 ounces, and I ended up only using HALF of them in the soup. I can't imagine what it would have been like using the full 20 ounces of kale that the recipe calls for. Overall, we thought it was just OK, and not something that we'd make again.
