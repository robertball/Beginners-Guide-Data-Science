I loved this recipe!  True belgian waffles are a yeast batter, and this one is very genuine.  My only gripe is that it makes a lot of dishes (yeast, butter, milk, mixing bowl, egg whites).  I subbed one cup of whole wheat flour with no noticeable effect on texture; next time I'll do two cups each whole wheat and white.  I'm not sure why the egg whites are whipped and folded in separately.  The loft comes from yeast, and by the time the dough is risen surely the egg whites will have deflated.  I did it anyway.  This batter does not actually double in volume as the recipe states; it's risen when it is bubbly and there is a yeast smell.  As an experiment, immediately when I finished the batter I put one waffle's worth in the fridge, to see if I could do a slow cold rise that would allow the batter to be made ahead.  I made the waffle the next day, almost 24 hours later, and it was sensational.  I think it was even better than the waffles made the first day, yeastier and more complex in flavor.  So I am happy to report the batter can be made ahead; no need to wait an hour in the morning to have your waffles.  To make an easy, delicious, and healthy fruit sauce, dump a bag of frozen berries into a saucepan and keep over medium heat while you cook the waffles.  Let boil until they "dissolve" into sauce.  Adjust taste with sugar (usu only a tbsp is needed for 1 lb berries) and lemon juice (usu 1.5 tsp).  The yield for my 7" round belgian waffle maker was about 10 waffles.

FINALLY a recipe worthy of a five star rating!  I have made these waffles several times.  For time purposes, I prefer preparing the batter the night before versus the morning of.  However, I haven't noticed a distinct difference in the taste either way - the waffles are amazingly delicious!  I whip the egg whites first, since I use my KitchenAid stand mixer and don't have an extra mixing bowl; then set the egg whites aside.  Proofed the yeast in the mixing bowl (add a tsp of sugar with the yeast to proof it properly - the yeast mixture should be frothy after 10 minutes).  Then I add the egg yolks, etc.. directly to the yeast.  Be sure the milk and butter aren't too hot, otherwise it will kill the yeast - should be no more than 115°F.  The batter should relatively double in size.  I used a 7" Belgian Waffle iron and ended up with 9 waffles (about 1 scant cup of batter per waffle).  A regular waffle iron will produce many more waffles due to difference of size/shape.  These  waffles are crispy outside and soft inside.  If you are accustomed to "Belgian Waffle" mix from a box, these will taste much different, because they are made from a yeast batter - but true Belgian Waffles are made with yeast.  We top ours with butter, maple syrup, strawberries and whipped cream, YUM!  The waffles freeze well - just be sure to reheat them in the oven for about 10 minutes at 350-375°F to keep the crispness.

THESE are Belgian waffles! Make these when what you want is BELGIAN WAFFLES!  You must have the ability to gently fold in the whites and the patience to let the yeast do its thing and the waffle iron to heat up between waffles. If you can follow this recipe to the letter, you WILL have the best Belgian waffles.  Regular waffles are great in a hurry and usually rely on baking powder, as does Bisquick which gets its distinctive flavor from lots of baking powder.  I much prefer the softer, old-fashioned flavor of yeast, which was most definitely NOT overpowering in this recipe.  The aroma wafting from the waffle iron about drove my husband, me, and our dog crazy!  These waffles are incredible and a treat I have personally only had in restaurants before now.  I make waffles all the time, but these Belgian waffles are so delicious, a perfect melding of crisp and soft and the flavor is out of this world. So special I think we've found our new Christmas brunch tradition.

So worth the extra effort!!! After months of trying to imitate the best waffle I ever had from a street vendor in Holland, I've settled on this recipe as my base. They freeze very well. Set them on a wire rack for a few minutes after cooking so they dry out a bit. Freeze them in zip lock bags, but remember to remove as much of the air from the bag as you can. For best results, defrost them in the microwave for a few seconds, then toast them to remove the moisture and crisp up the outside. Then sprinkle with a little powdered sugar. You'll never buy those pathetic little tasteless imitations from the grocery store again! UPDATE...I replaced about 1/2 cup of milk with buttermilk and that gives it a nice tang.

I was so looking forward to this being a great recipe.... it was very very disappointing... i had fresh yeast and all the exact ingredients...they were not crisp and light...maybe it was my waffle iron, as it is brand new... but... i won't waste all this ingredients and the time it took to prepare on this recipe again... sorry

Great and tasty recipe.  I loved that these stayed crispy even after sitting for a while since I'm usually the last person to eat!  The prep wasn't as bad as others made it sound.  I used three bowls total and two cups.  I used a deep but regular waffle iron and this recipe made 22 waffles.  I loaded them into the freezer but it might be worth noting that "makes 8 waffles" is a bit of an understatment.  My family of 5 ate all they could eat and we still had 15 of them left.

I make these a lot and everyone raves about them!  I have made them following the directions exactly and also made them by using the whole egg instead of just the yolks, thereby, eliminating the step of beating the whites and folding them in.  I cannot tell a bit of difference either way and it makes the recipe easier.   I typically make them at night and let them rise in the fridge in my Kitchen Aid mixer bowl covered with plastic wrap. These are by far the best waffles we have ever eaten!  The tang from the yeast is fabulous!!

I had a hankering for fresh home made waffles so I tried this one out.  Considering I have never made waffles or used a waffle iron, this was super simple to make.  They turned out very moist and delicious and the kids also enjoyed them.  Can't wait to make them again and top them with fruit and whipped cream!

These are best used with a medium to deep waffle iron.  If made properly, they will be light and fluffy inside and crisp on the outside.  The aroma, flavor and texture can't be matched by baking powder based recipes.  Be certain to prepare the yeast mixture properly.  use a thermometer if you are unsure of proper temperature for the milk.  Also, crefully fold the egg whites in, don't beat them.  After you have made this once or twice, try experimenting a bit.  I let the dough sit for about three hours and puch it down occasionally.

These were the best waffles I've ever tasted.  It is a little more work than a non-yeast waffle, but it's worth it.  I was a little worried at first that it would be difficult because of the yeast, but it was very easy to make.

I have been making these for years. To keep in the fridge for about a week, every other day add a teaspoon of sugar to keep the yeast fed.

these waffles were 5 star fabulous!  it made 9 belgian waffles in my waring 600 flip over double waffle maker.  i made mine in one bowl, soaking the yeast in the warm milk for 10 min, added the other ingredients including UNWHIPPED egg whites, and let it rise 1 hour.  it did not double but was very yeasty. They are very moist inside with a nice chew, not bready. and crusty outside. they are so tasty they can be eaten plain. I ate mine with sliced bananas sauteed in butter for 1 min and added maple syrup to pan. OMG almost like bananas foster.  i left some in the fridge for the next day and made the rest and froze them individually wrapped in plastic wrap and then in a ziplock bag. i was going to try the easier baking powder recipe, but i don't think they would have turned out this good.  Thanks for the recipe.

These are good when you first make them, but if you leave the batter in the fridge overnight and then make them they are DIVINE. Such a difference in taste. It's amazing!

As I am new to making Belgian waffles, I decided to make this recipe as well as Emma's Belgian Waffle recipe from this site to do a side by side comparison for my family and our brunch guests. Every single person decided that Emma's Belgian Waffle recipe was superior to this recipe...but it was noted that if the recipes hadn't been made side by side they would have liked this recipe and that they weren't necessarily bad.  The yeast flavor is distinct in this recipe and as there is none in Emma's Belgian Waffle recipe, you might want to choose this recipe instead. Every person noted that the texture (soft inside and crisp outside) and flavor were inferior to Emma's Belgian Waffles as this recipe provided a slightly more rubbery texture and a more bland flavor. If you desire a more savory waffle with an overall softer texture, this recipe may be the one for you.

I have noticed that a lot of people complain about the effort these waffles take. Honestly, if you have an egg white separator and a Kitchen Aid mixer, these waffles take 15 minutes to make, 20 tops! Here's the steps to make this move quickly:

1. Pour 3 cups of milk in a liquid measuring cup; place in microwave and heat for 1-2 minutes. Test temperature; if not hot enough, heat in 30 second increments until you reach the correct temperature.

2. While milk is heating, separate eggs with egg white separator; pour egg yolks into Kitchen Aid mixing bowl. Place butter in bowl to melt.

3. Take milk out of microwave; place butter in microwave and heat for 30-60 seconds. Add 1/4 cup milk to yeast per recipe.

4. While yeast is soaking, mix in sugar, salt, vanilla, 1/4 cup milk, and butter in mixing bowl. Scoop flour into 1 cup scoop (if you have more than one use them!; sit to the side. Mix in yeast mixture once it is bubbled up.

5. Add in 4 cups flour and remaining milk, alternating per the recipe. This will go quickly especially if you have more than one dry measure cup; I have 3 and have 3 cups of flour ready to be poured at this step.

6. Pour batter into a large bowl, PREFERABLY one that has a lid. Then clean mixing bowl, pour egg whites inside and whip until they have soft peaks. This will take only about 30-60 seconds with a Kitchen Aid.

7. Fold egg whites into batter, cover bowl with lid and let it rise!

I get these waffles done in 20 minutes INCLUDING CLEANUP!!

Wonderful! And easy to make, just a little time consuming with the raising time and the extra bowls needed. Not quite what you get from the stalls in Antwerp, but as close as I've ever been able to come. It's a little odd that some of the reviewers would complain about yeastiness. That's basically complaining that the Belgian waffles tasted too much like Belgian waffles.

These are awesome! I've made these many times and they are always a hit. I've made the batter 2 days in advance with no noticable difference. I also freeze extras and reheat them in the toaster! I took some of the other reviewers advice and this is how I altered it.  Ingredients •1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast •1 tsp sugar •1/4 cup warm milk (105-115 degrees F/45 degrees C) (about 10-15 sec in microwave) •3 egg yolks  •2 3/4 cups warm milk (105-115 degrees F/45 degrees C) •3/4 cup butter, melted and cooled to lukewarm(cooler than 115 degrees) •1/2 cup white sugar •1 1/2 teaspoons salt •2 teaspoons vanilla extract •4 cups all-purpose flour (or 2c wheat 2c white) •3 egg whites Directions 1.In a small bowl, dissolve yeast and 1 tsp sugar in 1/4 cup warm milk. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.  2. In a large bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, ¼ c of warm milk, and melted butter. Add the milk/yeast/sugar mixture, salt, sugar, and vanilla; stir. Stir in the remaining 2 1/2 cups milk alternately with the flour, ending with the flour. In a separate bowl beat the egg whites until they form soft peaks; fold into the batter. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour (or in fridge overnight, up to two days in advance).  Step 3 didn't change.

This recipe makes a very good waffle with a flavor and texture that cannot be beaten with a box mix.  The only thing I would suggest changing is adding a bit more sugar.  I like my waffles with a slighly sweeter flavor.

It was hard for me to even give this recipe one star. This is a HUGE dissapointment. I was so excited to use my waffle maker and make begian waffles. I had all the ingredients and made it just like the recipe called for. The batter was thick and heavy, the waffles were tastless and awful. Heavy, not crispy at all. Sorry, I would not reccomend or suggest any one to try this one! We ended up eating something else. My kids wouldn't even touch them!

OMG!! What can I say?  I've been an allrecipes user for years, and rarely do I bother to rate a recipe.  But, I just had to this time.  I made this for a breakfast dinner with bacon, sausage, and OJ for a change of pace.  I made the recipe exactly, except that I only used one stick of butter (1/2 cup instead of 3/4 cup) and swapped out 1/2 cup flour for 1/2 cup wheat flour, and it was plenty rich.  I let it rise all afternoon and must say they are soooooooo delicious, crispy, tender inside. DON"T OVERHEAT YOUR MILK! you will kill the yeast. just lukewarm is plenty!  It made 10 full size waffles.  Will make again and again.

So the husband decided we needed a Belgian waffle maker, taking advantage of the pre-holiday sales he got one.  I did some research and this recipe looked pretty user friendly.  I make a roll recipe that uses egg whites folded in that is a big hit so I figured this was a good pick.  Following recipe and waffle iron directions to the letter, I was ready to give this recipe a 1 star.  The guys had returned from their black Friday holiday shopping and were starving.  The waffles were coming out horribly.  I grabbed my trusty cookbook and whipped up a plain waffle mix.  After 2 failed attempts with that, I decided to get out my 25 yr+ old waffle iron and see what would happen with it.  Got the guys fed using my trusty old iron and moved on to this recipe's remaining batter.  Oh yum!  Turned out just like I thought it should.  Crispy and golden brown on the outside, light and tasty on the inside.  I'll be keeping this recipe and returning the "new" iron!

I must say I am not a very big waffle lover.. and I do think this waffle has a bit of an after taste maybe..I dont know what it is I taste.. BUTT I really loved the recipe... I have a normal size waffle maker.. I think It made 15 or 16.. and we ate just a few and the rest I put in the freezer so my daughter can bring them to school in her lunchbox or just whenever I dont have anything for lunch/breakfast at home I can take them out..put them in the toaster and they are as fresh as the first day.

Very good Belgian waffles! In the past I used to make my own batter but in recent years I have been using a box mix. Today we didn't have a box mix so I found this recipe. It was so good that I'll be making my own again from now on. I didn't read the recipe all the way through and didn't keep the egg white so it cost me double the eggs but that was my fault. Also, I didn't beat the whites much but I let it sit for over an hours, the batter doubled in size and was thick and wonderful. My family loved the waffles, they are light and fluffy. My batter made 9 waffles and I am freezing the extra 4 for quick weekday breakfast. Thank you!

This is a great recipe. It's not too runny and doesn't make a big mess when you put it in the waffle maker.

I didn't bother to separate the eggs and fold the whites in. I felt it wasn't necessary and it saved a lot of time. The batter did rise but I wouldn't say it doubled in size. If your's doesn't rise at all make sure you didn't make the milk too hot, it can kill the yeast.

I thought these were wonderful -- crispy _and_ fluffy.  Perhaps the last reviewer's problem with "crispness" was due to his/her waffle iron rather than to the recipe itself.  One note:  this made far more than eight waffles for me, so if your waffle iron makes the same size waffles mine does (5 x 5-ish), you may want to adjust the recipe accordingly.

Tried these today.  I made them gluten free, salt free and subbed the refined white sugar amongst other things.  I also didn't separate the eggs as suggested by one of the other users.  No sense really.  They are really very close to the waffles I've had in Liege, Belgium.
My kids didn't even notice they were gluten free!  :-)

I thought these were good but not as amazing as everyone said. I bought an inexpensive Belgian waffle iron to see if we liked Belgian waffles well enough to make them somewhat often (in which case I'd ask for a better iron for Christmas or bday), so the iron could be the problem. My husband and I found the waffles to not be as crisp as we wanted and also to be a little bit tough. I wonder if I overmixed the dough while incorporating the flour and milk; I wasn't sure how thoroughly I should mix in between flour or milk additions. I was disappointed in the outcome, since it took me about 45 min to make the batter (night before, and it did rise in the fridge very nicely). The batter was very thick and stretchy, much more like dough than traditional batter. It made 8 big waffles in my Belgian waffle maker.

These are the best waffles I've tried! I followed the advice of some users and prepared the batter the night before and kept it in the fridge. The next morning I baked them. The smell was great. The only problem is that you need to serve waffles immediately, cause they get not crispy very quickly after baking. Though a toaster can save your waffles.

I have never reviewed a recipe before but I must after two mornings of these delicious waffles! My in-laws bought us a belgian waffle maker and after trying the recipe that came with the machine, we were disappointed. The batter was watery even after an hour rise. I spent the week perusing recipes and found this one. Oh my goodness was it good. I made half of the batter on Saturday and the other half on Sunday. They were even better the next day. I fully recommend these waffles. They were crispy yet soft on the inside. They were nice and sweet with a great yeasty flavor. I'm done searching for the perfect recipe as this is it!

This recipe makes a ton but they are so good and keep very well in the fridge for a couple of days.  I didn't have a Belgian waffle maker, but using a regular waffle maker, they were crispy on the outside and soft inside.  Perfect!

These waffles are wonderful.  I'd never made Belgian Waffles before, and decided to do so when my father and his wife were visiting us recently.  They taste delicious and were loved by all.  They're nice and thick, slightly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  It's worth the 1-hour wait for rise time!

I didn't really know what to expect cause I didn't know what Belgian waffle was like. It was good but for all the work I had to do, I was a bit disappointed. I think it's that a bit soury smell/taste from yeast that didn't appeal to me too much.
My hubby looooooved it though but it's a bit too much work so I'm not sure if I would ever make it again especially when I know that Fluffy pancake from this site is so good and easy to make for breakfast menu. Even my hubby said not to worry about making it again cause he was there during all the prep time. I may not be trying this again but for those who don't mind all the work, it would be worth trying. For some people especially those experts or those who love cooking, they may even think the prep work isn't so bad.
I did make the batter the night before, too like some reviews suggested. I don't know if that made any difference in the flavor though.

Sure, it was a lot of work, but it was well worth it! After cooking these waffles (by the way, instead of 8 waffles I ended up with 15 in one batch) I had no appetite for them what-so ever, after all the sweat I put into them. I froze them and they were the one thing that got me through my week after a hard day, or in an early morning, they tasted even better as left overs, with a great savory flavor.

Everyone loved them. Substituted some malted milk powder for flour for extra flavor. made a triple batch for 25 people and had about 10 leftover. Could have gotten away with a double batch instead. Froze the remaining on a wire rack in freezer and bagged them once completly frozen. The best combination was with coconut syrup, toasted macadamia nuts, toasted coconut, bananas, and fresh whipped cream. Had these for a do it yourself waffle bar for my daughter's brunch party.

4.5 star , good but not practical when you are in hurry . since there a lot of sugar in it , it will brown very quickly. what i like a bout this is that it stays crispy even it cool down the key is to use very hot temp and not much of the batter. this make a lot more than 8 with my waffle make it make about 15. will deveniatly make this again if have time the night before. and next time half the recipe

Time consuming but good. They don't feel crispy whey you take the waffles out of the waffle iron but after about 30 seconds they get crisp so take them out when they look browned and done, don't wait for them to feel crispy or you'll burn them.

I just came back from Belgium where I feasted on delicious, sweet, melt in your mouth waffles. In my opinion this waffle recipe fell flat. I didn't think these were doughy, sweet, or crispy enough. They honestly didn't taste that much different than a typical American waffle and the effort to make them was significant. Real Belgian waffles are much much sweeter than these without any topping whatsoever. They're also supposed to be much more bread like (imagine a doughy center of a cinnamon roll type consistency). These were just a little tiny bit doughier than typical waffles. I think I'll keep searching for the right Belgian waffle recipe.

Great recipe that makes 8-10 Belgium waffles! I followed the recipe as written except added whole eggs to butter & sugar rather than separating them. I will make them again!

Super yummy!  I used almond milk and only 1/2 cup butter, and let it sit overnight in the fridge.  It did not double but it was very foamy/bubbly.  Wonderful taste and texture.  We made it for a playdate with a bunch of 3-4 year olds and it was a total hit with everyone.  I had a regular waffle iron and this recipe yielded approximately 10 (8") waffles.

Made for Christmas morning, and making again tomorrow morning for my daughter's sleepover.  Excellent, excellent flavor, texture, soft in the middle and crispy on the outside!

I made the mistake of making a double batch on Christmas morning.  This recipe makes a lot of waffles.  There are 4 in my family, and I believe a single batch made 10 large, restaurant size waffles that take up most of a medium size plate.  I have a couple of huge waffle fans in my family, and a single batch would have been PLENTY.

Also, I mixed this up, put it in the fridge overnight, and it rose just fine.  Maybe not as much as if the dough had been allowed to double in room temperature, but it definitely rose!  I simply pulled it out the next morning and cooked the waffles.  Easy!

Best waffles ever. My husband went ballistic over them. I topped half with syrup and saved half the batter and made dessert style topping with cream cheese strawberry jam fresh strawberries with icing sugar drizzled with chocolate sauce they were totally over the top. My husband even took some cold to work and they were so  light and fluffy but crispy on the outside. Don't skimp on the vanilla it totally makes the waffles great.

This tasted great.  I skipped the part where I was suppose to let it raise.  I got ahead of myself and just started cooking.  After eating them I continued to read the recipe.  Even with that said, these still were great.  Next time I will do it right. :)

Melt in your mouth good. My family loves Belgian Waffles and these were better than any we've ever eaten out. Followed recipe exactly. Leftover batter was frozen and that batch turned out just as good.

These waffles are simply amazing and well worth the time and effort! So much healthier to make these at home using wholesome, organic ingredients rather than eating in a restaurant where the ingredients are questionable to say the least! Thanks a bunch for sharing :)

Very nice waffles. I am not sure if the beating and folding-in of the egg whites are essential but I followed the recipe nevertheless. Once I even made the dough the night before and left it in the fridge to rise. That made having fresh made waffles in the morning much easier and waffles were still super tasty.

We followed this recipe exactly as written, and the results were extraordinary!!  We actually made it the night before and placed the batter in the fridge overnight; took batter out of fridge for about 15 minutes this morning and then made the waffles.  They were the most perfect waffles we've ever had--very light and ever so slightly crispy on the edges.  And the aroma of the yeast permeated the whole house; smells like heaven in here.  You must try these--I would not add any extra flour or deviate in any way as they are absolutely perfect!

Meh.  Kind of mushy, not vey crisp.  Perhaps a great belgian waffle, but not something I liked.  Flavor was good, but comparable to any other recipe that uses vanilla extract.  Texture wasn't great at all.

This recipe is really good and worth the extra time it takes for them to rise! They turned out crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I made them for dinner and served scrambled eggs and bacon, butter and hot with them.

i think my waffle maker just won't make true belgian waffles - yeast or not.  the texture of these was great and were not super flavorful on their own (i think most waffles are that way and I like them like that).  i probably wouldn't make them again because the amount of effort wasn't worth the product, but again i think that may be because of my machine.

These are without question the finest Belgian waffles I have ever had. I mixed them up the evening before and refrigerated overnight. Pulled them out bright And early to give the yeast time to warm up and start working again before I baked them. I have tried many recipes including the one that came with my good Belgian waffler and this surpasses them all.

Very good waffles. I substituted the yeast and warm milk with 3 tsp of baking powder because I didn't have yeast. I also just upped the milk a little.

A prep time of 15 min is a lie. It didn't mention having to let the batter sit an hour until the end of a step. This made the recipie a waste of time and the batter didn't rise so the waffles were very tough.

These turned out wonderful.  I was a little nervous after all that work (as it was rising I read the negative reviews).  I think those people did something wrong, because I followed the recipe to the letter and these waffles are awesome!

I agree with some of the other reviewers that it is some trouble to make, but it is so worth it!  I never had true Belgian waffles before and I was hesitant to try and make these. The idea of waffles and yeast was a bit of a turn-off for me, but what a difference it makes! This recipe is so delicious that I will probably be making these every Sunday morning!   I did make one tweak. Instead of letting the batter rise for an hour in a warm place, I did what I usually do for all my dough recipes and let it rise overnight in the fridge. It slows the rising process (that's why I left it in overnight), but the slow time draws out more of the sugars in the flour. It also helps the dough to cook better and more evenly. I was also careful not to over-mix as this can lead to tougher waffles. Don't worry if it's a little lumpy!  I've tried many baking soda recipes for waffles, but this is the one for me! I'm glad I gave this recipe a try!  Thank you Bobbi Jo!

I have been searching for the perfect Belgian Waffle recipe that suits our taste. Found it!! Love the inside and outside textures as other cooks have mentioned. I had already started the yeast proofing when I found that I didn't have enough milk. I substituted 1 1/2 cups of vanilla soy milk and they still turned out de-lish! Thank you Bobbi Jo.

Perfect!!!  And even better if you cook them the next day.  The dough rises a bit more overnight in your refrigerator, so it came out crispier on the outside and more cake like on the inside.  Delicious!

I've been making a similar version for several years, but I allow the mixture to rise on the counter, less the eggs, overnight adding the eggs just before cooking.  I've tried whipping the whites  before adding , but did not find it worth the effort

These waffles are AWESOME!!!  My family loves them and I even liked them and I don't like waffles.  I like them  best with just a tiny bit of syrup; not too much because I want to taste how wonderful they are!

Absolutely perfect waffles. I made the batter the night before and had no problems.  I made some on a belgium waffle iron and some on a regular waffle iron and they all turned out perfectly.

FANTASTIC!  These are wonderful, they make the best belgian waffles we have ever had!  I followed the recipe exactly and I got nine waffles in my Waring Pro Waffle Maker.  According the the instructions with the waffle maker, you can freeze the leftover waffles, and that is what I did.  They say to fold them into wax paper, then place them in a plastic freezer bag.  Then you reheat them in the toaster oven and they were just as good when re-heated, although slightly more crispy.  We will definitely have these again!

I've never had Belgian waffles before, so I don't know what to expect.  BUT, these were so good I can't imagine that they wouldn't measure up to the "real thing".  These were scrumptious!  I will definitely make them again.  It does make a LOT of waffles, so I might halve the recipe the next time.  Thanks for sharing this delightful recipe with us Bobbi Jo!

Waffles were ok - not bad, but not great. I personally found that they didn't have much taste and needed to add extra sugar and vanilla. They did not, however, taste like yeast, as others had mentioned. What I did like though is that because the waffles did not have a characteristic taste, they are well suited for all types of toppings. I think I will keep searching for a better recipe or perhaps will stick to my usual baking soda one.

I had high hopes for this recipe after reading the rave reviews but it just didn't live up to the hype. The waffles were not crisp on the outside and the flavor was bland. I've had better luck with a mix. A lot of trouble for something that was just so-so.

These were great!  I haven't had any this good since I was in Brussels!  The are time consuming though.  But the heavier, bready texture is what makes them Belge!

If you have ever had a waffle in Belgium you will know that the big holes aren't the only thing that sets them apart - the yeast in this batter makes them close to authentic! Now if I could only find pearl sugar.

Oh my G!!!!!!!!! So worth the prep time. Not like ANYTHING out of any box or mix. TRY THIS!!!! Crispy on the outside, nice and fluffy inside. What more could be said? I followed the advice of another and made the mix up the night before. BTW, when they say the volume doubles.....it sooooo does! Over the top of my bowl and all over the refrig. Still, it was well worth all the effort. FABULOUS!!

this recipe is excellent. these are what I expect out of a waffle. they are tender and have good flavor. i like yeast and yeast bread. this recipe has yeast, so suprise it is going to have some yeast flavor. some don't like it. I do. the crispyness might depend on the wffle iron you use and temp you make them at. i don't prefer a crispy waffle, so these turn out amazing with what i use. which is a standard belgian waffle maker you find in any dept store. if you are looking for a crisp crunchy waffle without yeast flavor, you might want to try a recipe without yeast. these are the best i have found, and i have looked all over the webs, even a waffle specific website. another suprise, when using yeast it usualy means you have to let whatever you are making rise....which takes time. i know, shocking. you might have to prepare ahead of time. Eat these waffles and be happy, and if you want to be happier eat them with home made whipping cream.

I followed the recipe exactly and these were far below sub-standard. Instead of crispy and fluffy, they were cake-like, definitely NOT what I am accustomed to in a waffle, Belgian or not. While the batter did have a nice flavor and great lift, the final product was wanting...for an immediate replacement. My recommendation is to pass on this one and try something else.

It's pretty good. As some other wrote, it doesn't seem quite worth the amount of time required, but I can see doing this again. I'll note that my milk didn't turn creamy from the yeast (this is not the first time that happened) and I didn't beat the eggs into peaks, but the mixture rose beautifully, anyway, and the waffles turned out fantastic.

I may have just been using a waffle iron that wasn't right for this, but it just tasted more bready and didn't really have anything else special to it. I prefer my waffles to have a bit of a crunch to the outside. I may try this one again, but I'm not sure if it's going to be much better.

It wasn't as nearly as delicious as some of the reviewers state. Definitely wasn't worth the labour. I gave it a 3 because the flavour was okay, but I would go with a mix instead of going through all that work again.

These waffles didn't crisp the way I wanted them to and they had a very bland flavor. They needed more salt and the yeast flavor was almost too much. It was disappointing, considering how long it took to do the batter. It also makes a TON of batter. I have a huge bowl of it and so it's an extra big letdown.

The best waffle recipe I've used. I stuck to the recipe except for the suggestion of others, to make the night before and let rise in the refrigerator. I used the batter direct from the fridge, no warming to room temperature or stirring. Everyone raved about the waffles. This batter will be thicker than most but not a problem.

Yummy! I used vanilla paste instead of vanilla extract this time and it was super tasty. I believe that this recipe should be made the day before so the dough can rise in the fridge and IT WILL DOUBLE, so give it room to grow. It makes fantastic tasting waffles that I recommend to everyone! I froze a bunch and they still taste great after being baked for a bit.

Very very good, but gave us all gassy stomachs after. Maybe we didn't let it rise long enough? Oh well, still ate waffles 3 meals in a row.

Easy and delicious!  I added the fruit topping as suggested in another post.  These waffles were a hit with the family too.

Next time I will make the batter the night before so as to have quicker breakfast.

My husband said he will never eat a "regular" Belgian waffle again, he only wants these!  

The only problem I had was that the dough rose immediately when it all got mixed together, but it never doubled in size and we waited a long time- so I went ahead and just cooked them and they tasted great regardless.

Delicious! Made the batter the night before and stuck it in the fridge for a cold rise-- worked perfectly. Made waffles for the next 2 days, and they all turned out great! Perhaps even better if frozen and toasted the next morning... Going to try it with banana puree now!

Awesome! I made these for my mom who fancies herself the best belgian waffle cook ever. It showed her up. She never heard of using yeast. These were perfect.

I have never tasted waffles like this before. If you love the taste of yeast, you will love this dish. This is a great brunch item, since it does take a while (I'm not a morning person).

These were just ok for us - I didn't really like the yeast taste.  I'm going to try a different recipe next time.

These are perfect on the outside and inside.  Well worth the effort on a Sunday morning. I have tried many other recipes, including other recipes calling for yeast, but this one is spot on.  I even had left over batter so I used it the next morning and they still turned out great. It is now our go-to waffle recipe forever!

It's going to taste very YEASTY!!! 
It's great and really easy to make, but if you aren't a fan of yeast--go with a normal recipe that uses baking powder :)

This is very easy to make, especially since you can make it the night before.  Its the best recipe that I've come across for Belgian waffles.  The batter is thick and it comes out light on the inside and crispy on the outside.  Its great with whipped cream!

After getting delayed in starting these, I was in a huge hurry so I neither followed the directions exactly (did not beat whites long enough, didn't alternate the milk and dry ingredients) nor let the batter rise very long.  I just kind of "dumped" everything in and went with it.  They still got gobbled up.  They were only slightly denser than they should have been, but I"m sure that is because I didn't let the batter rise long enough.  The flavor was excellent and they had a surprisingly good texture considering my rush.  Good recipe!

These are the best waffles I have ever had, bar none.  I made them for a dinner party on Sunday and we are making them again tonight beacause they were so yummy.  A lot has been made of the extra effort they take, but I just cut out separating the eggs and they were easy-peasy.  Also, I mixed up the batter at two for dinner at six without any problems.  The batter rose and fell several times and the waffles were fluffy and delicious with a nice yeasty flavor.  The only tricky part is making sure that the butter and milk is the right temp so the yeast doesn't die.  I suspect the people who have had trouble with this recipe either had stuff at the wrong temp or had a bad packet of yeast.  Serve these with fruit, whipped cream and the buttermilk syrup you can find on this site and you are in for a real treat!

We made these waffles for Easter morning and they were fabulous! We made the batter the night before and refrigerated it over night. The next morning we set it out for about 45 minutes and then put it in the oven on the proofing setting and let it rise a bit more. This gave us time to prepare strawberries, make fresh whipped cream, and cook up a tasty buttermilk/caramel syrup (google up "magleby's syrup" it is amazing). We served the waffles with a syrup, strawberries, and cream.  There simply are not enough ways to say these were the best waffles I have ever eaten. Wow!

Just made these- quite a bit of work, but well worth it.  They were light and crispy. My husband thought they were not much different than regular waffles so I'm not sure I will go to all this work again.

Definately a five star recipe! I halved the recipe which was slightly challenging(1 1/2 egg yolks! Yikes) so some of the amounts were approximate. I rose the batter in the fridge as i was making ahead of time and although it didn't exactly double in size, it was close. Doubled the vanilla as i always do and topped with sweetened ,sliced strawberries, bananas and whipped cream. Breakfast or dessert? You decide...It was actually dinner for us, and a delicious one at that. I froze the leftover waffles in individual baggies for later use.

Just finished these and have to agree with others, they are yummy!  I took a few 'short-cuts' and didn't have so many dirty dishes.  I cut the butter in cubes and put with the milk in microwave and heated just until the butter started to melt, removed and stirred until butter melted.  I did not separate the eggs, I just beat the eggs with the milk and followed the rest of instructions.  They were light yet crisp.  I also got 10 with my waffle iron and as suggested, cooked,cooled the rest and froze them. Will make again (not often b-cuz of calories!)

This waffle recipe is very forgiving. I didn't read carefully and put the whole eggs in without beating the whites. I was afraid not to have the beaten whites because I knew it would add lightness to the waffles, so I beat two additional egg whites and folded them in.  The waffles were excellent. But the thing I liked best about them is that they freeze very well. I always try to save my extra waffles by freezing them. Usually I end up throwing them away anyway, because they just aren't good after freezing. Not so with this recipe, they were almost as good after being frozen as they were the first time. That in itself is worth the time it takes to make them. To freeze them I cooled them then put them (single layer)in a freezer zip lock bag. Very good recipe, thank you for sharing.

Taste good but this is not as light and crisp as I expected. After one hour, the batter didn't rise much ( 75 C with 70% humidity in my kitchen). I put it in the fridge overnite, the batter frothy but thicker than the night before. I like sweet taste but looking for more airy waffle than this one.

My absolute favorite waffle recipe!!!!!!  It is time consuming and messy, but soooooooo worth it.  I think I'll try and make the batter the night before next time because it's so hard to wait that hour for the batter to rise...I get so impatient and hungry by the time I finally get to eat one!!!

These are very good. I loved being able to put them in the refrigerator overnight as it made cooking breakfast the next day very easy. My only problem was that I did not use a big enough bowl when it was rising in the fridge and it spilled out all over the sides of the bowl into my refrigerator. So therefore I lost some of the batter but I still had enough for breakfast which was great, but then I had to clean the fridge which was not so great. Yes I will make these again, with a bigger bowl!!!

I made the batter last night and cooked this morning.  I have never had waffles like these.  They are awesome!  They remind me of a yeast donut like krispy kreme.  We just had them with butter and syrup.  My wife at so much that she had to lay down!  On the waffle scale where frozen store bought are a 1, baking powder waffles are a 5 then these are somewhere around 768.  I agree with a previous review that said there were a lot of dishes.  They will give your dishwasher a workout.  The upside is that you can make the batter the night before and do the dishes and there are very few dishes in the morning.

I did not find these to be at all light and fluffy.  In fact, they were heavy and dense.  The recipe was easy to follow and seemed to be going well until after they were cooked.

Good waffles, worth the trouble and the extra dishes.  Tasted great with  some fruit over the top (we used strawberries), then we sprinkled confectioners sugar over and it was delicious.

This was OK. I tried several of the waffle recipies on here, and this was not one I will make again given how long it takes and the "yeastiness" of it. With enough syrup, they tasted OK.

Sorry...these were ok, in fact they were good, but they were NOT worth the 1.5 hour effort.  You can get something almost as good with a box of Bisquick (imo), and certainly there are simpler, yeast-free ways to get equally nice waffles.  The strawberry sauce I made it with was great, though.

This recipe was easy and very tasty.  We did notice it was even better tasting the next morning, so best if made night before, (which is actually easier).  I am taking to the shore to feed the masses, thanks for sharing!

These waffles were outstanding! I made the batter the night before and let it cold rise in the refrigerator. Be sure your bowl is big enough because it will rise at least double in bulk.

Perfect waffles! Amazing texture (crispy on the outside, soft and stretchy on the inside), great subtle taste, etc. Just perfect. I haven't been able to find a good waffle recipe until I found this. This recipe is worth all the trouble with the yeast, waiting, extra dishes, etc. THE OUTCOME IS INCREDIBLE!!

The waffles tasted very good and we did enjoy eating them so I gave them 5 stars for taste. Wish I could have rated them 4 1/2 stars though and this is why. I always try to dirty as few cooking utensils and dishes as I possibly can when preparing a dish but this recipe just doesn't work that way. Also(and this may be the fault of the waffle iron I only paid $19.99 for.) when cooking them the iron stopped steaming after only a couple of minutes and had to reheat which lead to more steaming and overcooked spots in each waffle when finished. This was only the second time I've used it and the first time I made a basic baking powder recipe and had no problem with cooking those waffles, it worked exactly as it was supposed to. I did get 12 waffles instead of 8 and that was using the 3/4 cup of batter my waffle iron calls for so it does make more than stated in the recipe. All in all the taste was very good but the effort was beyond what I wanted to go trough for a breakfast for dinner night. If I make them again I'll try another reviewers method of making the batter the day before and refrigerating it until your ready to make the waffles. That being said, I'm not a syrup person so having them with fresh fruit and whipped cream was perfect. My son had his with fresh blueberry sauce (From the Blueberry French Toast recipe submitted by Robin) and I had mine with sliced and lightly sugared fresh strawberries each topped with whipped cream. Yummy!

I am not sure if I did something wrong with the waffles, or what but they didn't rise at all. I made sure my milk was no warmer or colder than the temperatures indicated. When I let it sit for an hour, the batter got 'bubbley' but didn't rise. When, I put them in the maker to cook them they were kind of flat. I may try it again, but not sure.

I just received my new Belgian Waffle Maker and decided to make them for dinner and freeze the leftovers.  They were delicious.  I've never made waffles but I will be making this recipe often!  My husband has always made the waffles in our old, two waffle iron.  After many years, we decided to replace it and I bought the Presto Flip Belgian waffle maker.  My batter rose so much, it dripped over the bowl; fortunately it was on a cookie sheet in the oven, so I managed to save the overflow.  Next time I know to use a larger bowl.  It was a time consuming recipe and uses lots of bowls, so I can see why most like to make it and store it overnight.  A keeper for sure.

Very nice fluffy center and crispy outside.  Taste is slightly more yeasty than I would like.  Maybe that's authentic?  But it's not quite for me especially given the time involved.  I'll be going back to my crispy waffle recipe next time instead.

Delicious, nicely risen waffles! I used salted butter and only 1 teaspoon of salt and, like other reviewers, substituted whole wheat flour for half of the white flour and made them 8 hours ahead, letting them chill in the fridge after rising an hour at warm room temp. Tip: I find I get better browning on my waffles when I don't oil the iron between batches. I oil it only after cleaning. (There's enough butter in the batter; even without oil, the waffles don't stick.)

1. When the recipe says "8" servings, it means it! These are 8 full size servings - as in it can easily feed 8 people.
2. My wife and I did not like the taste of these waffles. They left a weird flour after taste in our mouths and tasted very bland. We did not think this recipe tasted nearly as good as many of the baking-soda rising waffle recipe on AllRecipes.com.
3. These take a long time to make. This would be just fine if they tasted superb; however, as I stated above, this was not the case for us.

I bought a Breville waffle maker recently, and this was the first recipe I tried in it. I have never made waffles before so I hoped to have good luck. I made the batter and exactly followed the directions. As soon as I was done making it I covered with plastic wrap and placed it in the refrigerator. This morning I made the waffles and they looked great, tasted great and didn't stick one bit in the waffle maker. I yielded 13 waffles, 4 3/4" square. I cooled the left-over waffles on a rack then placed them in a freezer bag in the freezer, they freeze well and warm up in the oven nicely. Two thumbs up from my family and myself!

My family absolutely love these waffles.  I have made them several times and the last time I added an addition 3 egg whites (had some from another recipe) and it definitely made the waffles fluffier.  Either way, this is a great recipe.

Keeper alert - I don’t normally get excited about waffles.  We have them every Sunday, including the dog.  To me, most are pretty much like eating cardboard, thus I load them up with strawberries and whipped cream.  In preparing, I halved the recipe, so I used two eggs.  We could tell that this was going to be the exception when the smells started filling the kitchen.  The texture is light and cakelike, the flavor is ideal for eating plain or with toppings – just perfect.   Thanks for sharing!

I did try it, followed the recipe for 8 exactly as written.  The batter did double in size and I made 8 waffles in my new Oster Belgian waffle iron.  They were wonderful.  I will try halving the recipe since there are only two of us and will also make the batter the night before.   I'm still amazed at how good this recipe is.  I will never use a mix again.  I did keep the waffles warm in a 250° oven on a wire rack.  Perfect.

Not sure what I did wrong with this recipe but  I've made waffles with my waffle iron many a times and it always came out great but with this recipe it came out cooked on the outside and uncooked on the inside. Not sure what was wrong. I won't be trying this recipe again.

Very Good flavor that I think improves with a slow overnight rise in the refrigerator.  However, the recipe will double in volume in an hour to an hour and a half IF the milk and the butter are warm (90 to 110 degrees F) when added.  If this is not followed then the rise time will be longer.  I can also confirm that the recipe made 8 waffles in a Belgian type waffle iron.

This was my first attempt at yeast raised waffles and they were great. I didn't whip the whites separately and they were still light and fluffy. I always double or triple recipes, but just a single of this one was more than enough. Being used to baking powder raised waffles, at first I didn't put enough batter and ended up with sort of half waffles because these do almost all of their rising beforehand.

These are the best ever and I love most of the comments.  I made these as directed from the recipe but saved half of it in the refridge as someone suggested keeping it overnight and they where even better.  The yeast flavor developed and mellowed.

Absolutely wonderful! Made a brunch for a friend of mine since it was raining (we usually have a walk) and I could not have been more pleased!

Followed as is and the waffles came out light and fluffy. Made 16.

Very good Leige Belgian Waffle. It is pretty close to what you get on the streets of Brussels.  It is without the sweetness and the texture is a little different. The addition of Pearl sugar will fix the sweetness by giving you the caramelization of sugar that is traditionally on the outside of the waffle. I crushed up sugar cubes, since I did not have pearl sugar, and that worked fair. Very good recipe none the less, and I am very picky when it comes to Leige Belgian Waffles. I have been to Belgian so far 10 times and it is one of the three top greatest things coming from there, right after their beer and chocolate.

Wonderful recipe. My hubby is a picky eater and he loved this one!! For our liking, I added a bit xtra of the vanilla.  Also, my Belgian waffle maker is a bit smaller than most and from this recipe I ended up making 14 of them.  Enjoy

Those waffles are amazing! I love mixing ice cream, chocolate syrup, and bananas, and putting that mixture on them, it gives them creamy feeling.

I followed this Belgian waffle recipe to use for Mother's Day brunch this year. I made the batter the night before, as had been mentioned in several of the reviews I read.

They turned out GREAT! The waffles were a huge hit!

I was able to get 8 waffles out of this recipe using a Presto Flip Side waffle iron. I ended up needing 1 full cup of batter per waffle.

Thanks for the great recipe. I'll be using it anytime I'm in the mood for waffles!

This is an awesome recipe... be prepared though, it makes a lot more than 8 servings. LOL  Granted, it all depends on how big a serving you give out. I got 18 5"x5" waffles out of this.  
The first time I made them, I didn't modify.  The second time, I replaced the all purpose flour with gluten-free flour; exchanged the vanilla for 1 tsp maple flavouring, 1 tsp vanilla; and white sugar for 1/3 cup brown sugar + 4 tbs maple syrup.  Just wonderful!

My family loves these waffles! You have to have a little foresight to pull them of but they are worth the planning, letting the yeast in the batter do it's thing is a must. They have just the right crispiness on the outside while still being light & fluffy. I made them for brunch for friends & everyone raved about them.

I followed the recipe as is and I will admit this is not a quick to do recipe BUT it is well worth it in the end.This recipe was so good it made my 18 year old daughter get off her butt and wash the dishes right after we ate without me giving the eye. I will be making this again and oh yeah plus I got a big thank you mom from her.

The yeast made all the difference. I've tried lots of waffle recipes and this is the one I'm sticking with. My family LOVED them.

Fantastic!  Yes, they were more trouble than my regular waffles, but the whole family loved them.  They're much more substantial than non-yeast waffles.  I used a regular waffle iron with good results, but if you have both, I'd try the deeper one.

These were SO good!!!!  We absolutely loved them.  They are definitely a different kind of waffle with the yeast, but we loved it...and such great crispy outsides!!  My husband actually liked them better than our favorite buttermilk recipe we usually use!  They cooked perfect in about 5 minutes on our new waffle plates for our Cusinart Griddler.  The only problem we had was that I didn't read the recipe thoroughly enough and we were ready to eat, then realized they had to rise for an hour first.  Eek.  Well worth the wait though!

Great! My Belgian waffle maker took 1 cup of batter and about 2 1/2 min to make a crispy waffle. I also sprinkled some pearl sugar into some for that sugar crisp.

I have hade many different type of waffles resipes. I must say this is the one for me!!! I was nervus about a yeast waffle not having much luck with yeast breads and such but I did good. I did not stir the mix after the rise. this gave it a full flavor. it will deflate after you scoop it out onto the gridle. I used the mix the next day and it tasted even better. do not be afraid of the beer smell. thats the way it smells. I say agin do NOT mix after it rises. Thanks

I just got new waffle iron and so I have been testing new waffle recipes.  This one by far is the family favorite.  We made this for Christmas brunch and I could not make them as fast as they were being eaten.  I made the recipe as is except I added a little cinnamon and the waffles were delicious.  Great recipe, will be making these often.

Wow!  Awesome waffles.  Very light & slightly sweet.  Fantastic with whipped cream & fruit.  They did not stick to the waffle maker, but they were time-consuming to make.

These waffles were delicious.  They were crispy and had great flavor.  

I tried to freeze them but that was no good.  They begin to "deflate" pretty quickly.  They need to be eaten immediately after making.

This recipe is amazing, so light and crispy. And I didn´t taste any yeast flavor.
A rather large recipe, but I froze the rest and now I have some left to put in the toaster. 
5 stars from me!

I've tried several Belgian Waffle recipes since purchasing my waffle iron.  These are by far the BEST I've tried!  They crisp up nicely on the outside and have a wonderful texture inside, and the flavor is perfect!  These taste as good or better than the ones we get at fests and bazaars here in Germany!

This was a lil disappointing. I made these with my new waffle iron but the texture wasn't too crisp..but that could be attributed to my NEW waffle iron. More than the crisp factor i thought the flavor was too yeasty and eggy..will tweak and try again.

These are our favorite waffles!  Make sure you leave yourself lots of time to make them, the dough really needs the full time to rise in order to get the fluffiest waffles.

EXCELLENT!!!  Wow I love working with yeast.  This is just another receipe to add the the mix. I did substitute the milk for buttermilk also I took the suggestion of another review and made my own strawberry sauce.  That was excellent.  My family loves the smell of yeast, because they know there's going to be some yumming goodness soon.  My 9 year old couldn't wait, he came in and took a piece of waffle with some of the syrup.  We were dancing in the kitchen tasting these waffles.  It's now my only waffles recipe.

Okay, but not a patch on "Emma's Belgian Waffles" which handles much better and tastes just as good.

Doubled this recipe, thinking I had to feed a few people (5). I thought there would be some leftovers but there was A LOT of leftovers! I wouldnt recommend doubling unless you need to feed your whole street. They did turn out amazing though. I made them the night before and put them straight into the fridge to sit overnight.

good, but not as awesome as hoped. a lot of work. I like the Cinnamon Belgian Waffles just as much for way less work. these are denser. might be better w pearl sugar.

Have to agree with nursenat. Not a very simple early morning recipe to be making.  Especially finding out you have to let them rise for an hour.   Just not that good.  I'm still looking for a good waffle recipe.

Delicious! This is the third time I'm making these, and the grandkids love them. I love the yeasty aroma that lingers in the house.  If time permits, make the batter the night before and refrigerate. Pull out a few hours before making them to let the batter warm up.

These were a great deal of work but a quadrupedal batch is likely to last a while and my family loved them.

Absolutely delicious. I made these for breakfast christmas morning and they were absolutely divine with fresh berries on top.  It makes a huge batch, and my waffle iron is a true belgian waffle iron so they are very large. I went ahead and cooked up the excess batter and froze the waffles.  These are just as delicious reheated as they are fresh!

I made the waffles for Christmas brunch. I'm pretty sure I followed the directions to a T, but they were very yeasty and did not taste good at all. I spent a long time preparing the batter. The labor wouldn't have been so bad had the waffles been better. The texture was nice, but they where so yeasty that I ened up going to the store to get my stand-by box mix.

I loved these. They definitely made way more than 8.  I knew it was going to be a lot when I had the mix in my big bowl and it almost filled the entire bowl.  I ended up pouring half the mix into my other big bowl and then let them rise.  The taste was great and now I have some to freeze.

These waffles are worth the time & effort.  Forget your pancake/waffle mix in a box & follow this recipe.  I add a little flax seed to make them healthier - and if you have extra, they freeze well too!

These were fabulous.  I followed the recipe and directions exactly (read through all the steps a couple of times before launching in) and the results were perfect.  Thanks Bobbi Jo for a great recipe.

Delicious! The entire family loved it. We topped it with an apple cinnamon mix and some whipped cream. They were very fluffy, entirely worth every bite. I will definitely make this again. This is probably the best Belgian Waffle recipe I have ever had. I did, carelessly, use cold milk instead of warm, but it did not seem to make any difference. The batter rose fine and tasted extraordinary. Thanks!

These turned out wonderful.  The kids liked them so much that they ate their breakfast in absolute silence (I have a 1 year old, a 2 year old, and a 9 year old).  So I am sure you can imagine just how frequently that happens!

This is an awesome recipe.  The waffles turn out really light and fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside.  The only thing I might change is to add more sugar to a total of 3/4 cup.   Evertyhing turned out great.

This recipe is amazing!!  I recieved a waring pro waffle maker from my now husband as a gift and was looking for a true belgian waffle recipe to try.  I have made this several times of the year and must admit that these were the best waffles I have ever tasted!  Definitely freeze any leftovers between waxed paper and in a freezer bag...you will not be disappointed!

Wow, I'm really impressed.  The recipe works wonderfully.  I cut it down to 2 servings for my boyfriend and me, and it was the perfect amount.  The yeast adds a unique, tasty flavor, and the texture is marvelous.  Other waffles I've made have had less flavor or not been as crispy.

This recipe was DELICIOUS. It actually made about 12 waffles on our Belgian waffle maker...as a family of 4 we ate 5 of them! I froze the leftovers and my husband is looking forward to having them for breakfast during the week.

This was an excellent recipe, but was a bit much for two people. A single batch made eight 6 1/2-inch waffles. However, we cut the leftover waffles into their quartered sections and put them in the freezer. We just took some of them out today and popped them in the toaster for a cycle or two (from frozen) and they thawed and crisped up beautifully for a quick gourmet breakfast for two! I will be making this one again and continue freezing the leftovers.

This recipe is wonderful! The waffles turn out crispy on the outside and very fluffy and soft inside. They keep very well in the freezer too! My fiance and I ate these about twice a week and I had to make more once our stores were gone.

Absolutely fantabulous!!  Not much to add, since previous reviews have said it all.  I have tried several waffle recipes, this is the best by far.  As one reviewer suggested, making the batter overnight makes for an easier morning, highly recommend doing that.  The batter doesn't double in volume really, but just check to make sure it at least rises.  The waffles are great: they have this subtle tanginess from the yeast, giving it great depth of flavor.  My boyfriend also loved the recipe.  Thanks!

These were great waffles, but they tasted a little bland.  (Of course one you load tghem with buttermilk syrup, fruit and powdered sugar, they were AWESOME!)  I made them for a baby shower this morning and they were gobbled up.  Like other reviews, I made them the night before and left the batter rise in the fridge.  Just a warning, though, put on a paper plate or something because I left it in a 5 quart KitchenAid bowl and it still over-flowed!!

This made a good waffle!  I subed 1 1/4 cup of buttermilk for part of the milk. I also used whole wheat flour(80% hard red, 20% soft white). Very good;)

I have used this recipe many, many times! They are light, crisp and absolutely delightful! I will continue to use this recipe again and again.
On a couple waffles I sprinkled some cinnamon right before baking; they turned out fantastic!

I've tried these a couple times and while they are good, they're just not great for the amount of time spent.  The texture is just not quite what I want it to be.  Will try another recipe.

My husband and I agreed that these are so much better than the boxed Belgian waffle mix!  Even if they are more time-consuming, you should try them at least once.  I was trying to cut the recipe in half at midnight and messed up on the eggs, so I didn't add the egg yolks and they were still great! They turned out nice and crispy, but tender on the inside - perfect!  I did find that these tended to cook at a little lower heat than regular waffles in our Belgian waffle maker.

I JUST TRIED THIS RECIPE AND I ADMIT IT DID TAKE AWHILE FROM START TO FINISH BUT THE FINISH PRODUCT WAS WORTH THE WAIT.  I HAVE LOVED BELGIAN WAFFLES SINCE I FIRST TASTED THEM WHEN I WORKED AT A COUNTRY CLUB TEN YEARS AGO AND JUST LAST WEEK A GOT A CRAVING FOR THEM. SO I BOUGHT ME A BELGIAN WAFFLE IRON AND GOT ONLINE.  I FOUND THIS RECIPE AND NOW IT WILL BE MINE FOR ALL MY BELGIAN WAFFLES. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW LONG CAN YOU SAVE THE BATTER FROM THIS RECIPE.

These had a nice taste and I had no problem with the batter doubling up in size, but because I only had a regular waffle iron, they did not want to puff up like a Belgian waffle should.  Still tasted good though and the texture was fine.  As everyone else has commented on, you do use quite a few bowls, but worth it.  *UPDATE*  Since my original review, I have purchased a belgian waffle maker and this recipe came out fantastically!  I would say it is now a 5 star recipe!  Enjoy!!

I make these every year. Make them a day or two ahead of time, warm them up in the oven for Christmas Brunch. I freeze them for the rest of the year. My grandkids always ask for, "Grandma's Christmas Waffles". It is a tradition at our house! LOVE this recipe! YUMMY

I made it according to the recipe, except I used 1/2 cup butter (lowering the fat).  It was still amazing. Definitely gonna make again!

used rapid rise yeast and did not separate the eggs and still comes out great every time.  Make a batch and freeze in food saver bags. Perfect!

I made these waffles vegan by using vegan margarine, arrowroot powder for eggs, and almond milk.  I've made them probably 50 times now.

I made this recipe the night before and placed it in the fridge overnight for the longer rise. It was ready to go first thing in the morning.  The 1/2 cup was just right for each waffle size. 

I would suggest using a dough hook or hand mixer when going back and forth between the milk and flour additions and use a large bowl as it states or else this will slosh everywhere. I used a large metal mixing bowl and it was just slightly over the brim after the overnight rise. 

This recipe made 14 waffles for me and I let them cool, turning them over to allow the heat to escape and firm up, before putting them in a freezer plastic bag.  I'm able to have breakfast ready by placing them in the toaster.

Will definitely make it again, results were excellent, full of flavor and not too sweet.
Will use a proper kitchen mixer next time, tried to get away with using a hand held electric mixer but it wasn't really up to the job and I wasted time, took about 45 minutes.
Amount of ingredients required a large bowl, makes about 8 circular waffles.
To get the doubling in size of dough took about 3 hours, not 1 hour as claimed by the recipe.

PERFECT recipe ... I love waffles, my family loves waffles but I had never made them from scratch.  I got a new waffle iron and though there were definitely less involved recipes, I’m SO GLAD I used this one first.  My waffle iron is powerful, 1400 watts ... and with this recipe it literally made PERFECT waffles.  They were light inside, crispy outside, not too sweet, literal perfection.  be sure to treat the yeast properly — a thermometer is essential.  My husband was amazed that in a little more than an hour of taking my new waffle maker out of the box, I was turning out PERFECT Belgian waffles, this recipe made me seem like an experienced waffle chef!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe — it is most certainly a keeper.

I got my waffle-loving guy a Cuisinart WAF-F20 Double Belgian Waffle Maker for his birthday. I tried Arrowhead Mills and Whole Foods mixes but they were not up to snuff. On New Year's Day, I had time to make Bobbi Jo's yeasted waffle recipe and we both loved it.

I made a couple of substitutions because I didn't have milk or all-purpose flour:
 - Flour: King Arthur unbleached white bread flour
 - Milk: for the yeast 1/8 c each of half an half and unsweetened almond milk; for the rest: 1/2 c half and half and almond milk for the rest.

Great recipe.  Waffle iron at 400 degrees for 4 minutes.  Add salt with flour.  Can make this the day before and do slow rise in fridge.  Freeze extras and reheat in oven for 10-15 minutes at 350 degrees to crisp.  The yeast flavor makes a huge difference in the taste.

I made this recipe twice already. The first time followed the recipe exactly. It was okay but not wow.  It lacked flavor and it was not crispy on the outside. My kids devoured it though. Since I like mine crispy, I put them in the toaster after removing from the waffle maker. The second time I made I tried to add flavor by adding more sugar and vanilla but I must have done something wrong because they turned out worse and had to throw away half of the mixture since my kids refuse to eat it. I then tried a different recipe using baking powder, and I love it!!! Still need to put the waffle in the toaster to get it crispy.  I would give this yeast recipe another try but knowing  I can go back to the baking powder one anytime.

This were a lot of work compared to regular waffles made with baking powder, and truthfully, I didn't think they were worth it. They did not crisp up like my regular recipe does, I found them to be slightly chewy instead of crispy, which I didn't like. I use an antique cast iron waffle iron and my traditional waffles come out superbly crispy and flavorful. I also tried leaving the batter overnight and didn't find much of a difference compared to a one hour rising. The flavor was kind of lackluster. For me I will stick with my traditional waffles.

I have a recipe from my Belgian cousin. It islighter for sure. I substituted 1/2 cup club soda for the liquid Nd added another package of yeast. All this provides a lighter waffle. The vanilla and butter add flavor to this rendition. It was a good comprise.

This recipe is awesome!! It was worth the trouble of whipping the egg whites and letting the dough rise. It makes for a light and fluffy waffle. Sure beats the packaged mixes!! I will definitely be making this again. And this recipe easily makes about 10 waffles. Plenty of left overs which I’ll be freezing for future eating!!

Made these for a Sunday brunch for my family visiting from out of town. They loved them.  I put together the batter the night before and let it rise in the refrigerator.  Turned out perfect.  I will definitely make them again!

This was great. Turned out very light and crisp, I’ll certainly do this one again and saved the recipe. Where I see people having trouble with this would be paying attention to the temperatures so you keep the yeast happy and productive. 105-110 for your milk to proof the yeast, you have to proof the yeast. 105-110 for the rest of the dairy, warm it up near the end of the proofing.  To cold and the little yeasties won’t wake up, to hot they die. Let your eggs sit out for a bit to come to room temp. I microwave my big Pyrex bowl to warm it up a bit because it would be like jumping in a cold pool after being in a sauna for the yeast, keep them cozy. The big key to this recipes success is happy yeast. By the end of an hour ferment this batter was close to doming my big bowl. Everyone was digging these waffles as they were for a special occasion, breakfast for dinner.

The waffles were delicious!    The hardest part was waiting for them to rise.  Added fresh picked strawberries and whipped cream; what a treat!

Love that they have a little sweet taste.  Actually taste similar to Waffle House when you use this recipe with a regular waffle iron.  The finished product freezes great and heats right up in the toaster for a quick, preservative free breakfast for the kiddos before school :)

Yuck!  Sorry, but we were all extremely disappointed in this recipe!  First thing I noticed, after doing all the prep, was that the final product comes out EXTREMELY limp and soggy!  Once you taste the waffle, the flavor is average at best.   The texture is nothing what i come to expect in a good belgian waffle, in fact they were extremely 'heavy'.  Save yourself a lot of time and energy and use the "Waffles I" recipe on this site.  A cinch to prepare and waffles come out great!  No clue why I tried something new when I have used the other recipe over and over again without fail.

Good, though time consuming. Also, it requires 3 cups of warm milk total. With 1/4 C used for yeast and then another 1/4 C mixed with egg yolks and then another 2 1/2 C to alternate with the flour, making 3 cups total. As with all recipes, read it in its entirety twice before beginning or planning. Melt the butter at the beginning so that it is cool when mixing in. The yeast takes some stirring to get it to dissolve. Egg whites should be at room temp when whipping for pretty much everything so separate them early as well. Remember to grease the iron each time so that the crust is crunchy in stead of doughy. It took about 5-7 minutes each for mine and it took about 3/4 cup of batter. I froze mine. Make the waffle, let it cool completely. Place on baking sheet on parchment paper inside freezer for 2 hours. Remove from freezer and put inside freezer bags. Turned out great.

I loved these Belgium Waffles. They really were crisp on the outside, soft and tender on the inside...very similar to the waffles served at my favorite old fashioned dinner that my dad took us to when we were kids. It was so much easier for me to prepare the batter the night before. The following morning I simply heated up the waffle iron, baked the waffles and prepared the rest of the breakfast items.  This recipe is a keeper!

I made this twice and second time around I made the milk slightly warmer (120 degrees) so that helped the yeast froth better as it sat there for 10 minutes. This made the tough yummy and yeasty when I cooked the waffles. Will definitely make again!

So I made this for my roommates and myself and it was amazing. Turned out really good even though I’m sure I didn’t get stiff peaks. I had to use a plastic whisk and my arm was for sure getting ready to fall off, but I assure you it was well worth it!!!

I have made these twice now. They are a true Belgian waffle.  I cut the recipe to 1/3 so it makes a batch of  batter more  suited for two people.  I also use buttermilk; it makes a softer, fluffier, richer waffle. Make sure your waffle iron is very hot and don't over bake. The waffles will be crispy on the outside, nice and light and fluffy inside, with a wonderful flavor.  Forget the syrup; great  with a dusting of powdered sugar and macerated fruit!

Great taste - so much better than boxed.  Leave enough time to let your dough rise.  Prep time says 15 minutes but it's more like 20 plus rising time.  Excellent!

All in all, this is an excellent recipe, but I reduced the rating to 4 stars only because it doesn't have to be quite so labor intensive or use so many bowls. 

Changes that I made were primarily because I made the batter the night before , and I had only 2 cups of milk on hand. I used my Kitchenaid mixer, but this method could also be used for a hand  electric mixer. 

In a medium bowl, I melted the butter in the microwave and then added the  2 cups of milk that I had and 1 cup of water.  This cooled the butter and warmed the milk. For the additional cup of milk, I used powdered buttermilk that was added to the dry ingredients. I separated the eggs, adding the yolks to the butter/milk mixture, and put the whites in a small bowl. The milk, egg yolks and butter were mixed  together to combine. 

All of the dry ingredients were put into the Kitchenaid mixer bowl (flour, sugar, salt, buttermilk powder, and 1 1/2 tsp. instant yeast. (If you make this in one day, use 1 3/4 tsp. instant yeast) and mixed with the beater tool. Then I added the milk, butter, egg yolk mix, and combined using the beater tool. While this was mixing, I used a hand mixer to beat the egg whites until they peaked. 

Then I folded the egg whites into the batter, covered the bowl, and let it sit on the counter for 1/'2 hour before I put it into the refrigerator. Since we had the waffles for dinner, i took the batter out of the frig about an hour before I planned to bake them so the batter could warm and raise.

Wonderful waffles.  I have made these 3 times and they are consistently very good. Better because of the yeast. They hold well in the refrigerator for days when sealed well. Add just a little milk if the batter is thick when you are cooking them on later days.  The only waffle receipe I make.

This recipe was great. I never made waffle batter with yeast before. It taste just like diner waffles. Ussaly I make waffles they taste like crispy pancakes; but these have a distinct taste like from a dinner, it's makes a lot. I made 6 waffles out of this recipe. Large waffles at that. Topped with strawberries and whipped cream so yummy.

Recipe was a-freaking-mazing. Made it the night before and batter was very fluffy the next day. I would use less sugar next time. The waffles are sweet and I like to dip my waffles in maple stripe which made it even sweeter.

Really good! Woke up with a desire for mimosas and Belgian waffles and went for it. I used rapid rise yeast but it still had to sit for at least an hour before it seemed like it had risen. It definitely didn't "double" but it was bubbly, airy looking, and yeasty smelling and had visibly risen. I followed the directions exactly and we loved them. Super light and fluffy on the inside and crunchy on the outside. Make sure you carefully watch your temperatures for your milk and do not pack the flour! SCOOP flour into measuring cup with a spoon, then level off with a knife. I suspect that is why some people are ending up with dense waffles. I have just a regular Black & Decker circular waffle iron, I'd guess 7"? It made 9 waffles. I think it would have made 8 if they were perfectly measured, but the first one I made I only used about 1/2c batter and so it was a bit small. The rest I used about a scant cup. Love them, either we are having chicken & waffles for dinner or I'll freeze them individually with the food saver for quick breakfast. It is a lot of effort, I may double next time. Thanks!

someone commented that they werent light and fluffy, but Belgian waffles are denser to begin with (yeast). that being said, this was a very light recipe for Belgian waffles, and i found them to be fluffy and lighter than ones ive had in some restaurants. i threw in some chocolate chips as well. i also think i might have let the batter rise a little more than an hour, cause i wasnt really timing it at the end. like others have said, you really have to treat it like a potion---ingredients have to be prepared, prepped, and combined correctly for it to turn out just right. if you dont wait, it wont be the same taste. yeast is a living thing, which is really weird when you think about it. it eats sugar. so weird. anyways, great recipe!!! made soooo many, i already ate three.

These waffles are awesome. One of my signature breakfast/brunch goto's are blueberry waffles with Brie. I take to blueberry waffles and make a sandwich with Brie cheese inside....irresistible! These waffles made a dish that has always gotten praise, even better.

AMAZING recipe!!! I didn't change a thing. My family wolfed it down.  It's by far the best tasting Belgian waffle recipe I've ever tried. I added a little sugar to the egg whites while whipping them so that they'd hold up better as I folded them in.

I loved this recipe. The yeast adds a stronger flavor that the younger children noticed. We added a bit more Vanilla Extract and increased the sugar for a sweeter waffle. If you would like a savory flavor waffle try adding Feta Cheese to the original Belgian Waffle recipe. So Good!!! I truly love this one and will use it again. Thanks so much for the help!!!!!

This was an excellent recipe!  It is time consuming, so I made the batter the night before, and the next morning the waffles turned out just perfect and delicious!!  Worth the time.  I fed four grown men; my waffle maker used about a cup of batter per waffle and I got 8 big waffles.

The best homemade waffles we've ever made!  Light and fluffy, mildly sweet so whatever toppings you use can shine through.  Making the batter is pretty involved, lots of bowls to wash, but worth it. Be sure to use a very large bowl for rising.  Mine only had a third left open to rise and our batter overflowed after about 40 minutes.  I use my oven on 100 degrees to proof any yeast recipes, that gave a very good rise with this one.  We use a deep Belgian style iron.  I'm going to try making batter the night before next time and refrigerate, and giving it a little time  to warm up and re-rise in the morning next time, as some of the reviews have suggested.

This recipe is a hit! Made it ahead, following exact instructions. Used the next morning and it was delicious! The butter took a while to make, but if you enjoy cooking, it's not that complicated at all, even for relatively inexperienced person. I left it overnight refrigerated and it did add up in size. I used a generic waffle maker and it yielded about 12 waffles. I'd say it's a bit too much for two people, but perfect for a family brunch. I've refrigerated unused butter and made waffles on the next day too. Perfect for weekend breakfast/brunch. Sprinkle it with some powdered sugar and enjoy!

I searched and searched for a recipe that looked appealing, especially by the photos, and this is the one I chose. I am so glad I did!!! This recipe was so great I can't wait to travel to see my family and make these for them. I know that my nieces will love them. It did take a little while, but it's so worth the effort. 

The only thing I changed was I ran out of whole milk so I used half whole milk and half coconut milk. The next time I think I will only use coconut milk because I think it gave them an even better flavor. I had a few cans in my cupboard and I immediately knew that it was going to give the flavor an even bigger boost. Excellent recipe.

This is a great recipe! Definitely worth going the extra mile to whip egg whites separately and let it rise for an hour. I doubled this since so many recipes don't feed my whole family, but it ended up being more than twice what we needed, so in the future I'll just make one batch. I'm flash freezing the leftovers and then storing them together in the freezer to have chicken and waffles later on...hopefully they will be great again!

Excellent recipe.  Fantastic results.  I would recommend that you feed them as you go whenever possible.  They do go a little soggy when left in oven as suggested.

These waffles are legit like the bear scene in" the Revenant"!!! Keep in mind the yeast has to rise for one hour after mixing together.

Yum! Nice and tender yet crispy. Cheated by using eggs whole instead of separating them. Used half whole wheat (was going to push it to 100%, BUT I only had enough for half on hand.) I even messed up and put cold milk with the melted butter (imagine the bits of butter floating about). They were still very good. I'll try to do better next time and see if that makes much difference.  But we all enjoyed these.  Thank you!

Delicious!!! I also prepared the batter the night before like others suggested and they turned out great!!!
I also added cane sugar directly on the waffle grill before adding  the batter and gave them a delicious crunch!

Came out amazing.  For those who are complaining that it was yeasty, then you are DEFINITELY doing something wrong.  Be sure your yeast is a nice warm place where it can rise.  Sticking your oven on warm with the door open is one good place.   Keep it under a hundred degrees, though.

Simple, delicious, and easy...waiting for the batter was a bit of a challenge with a hungry 2 yr old. Just added peanut butter and honey, and he devoured them :) I wish they were a bit more fluffy, but still good nonetheless!

The taste is the real deal, but I couldn't get the dough texture right. Too runny in my opinion. It didn't raise also. But I I'll try again.

This is my new favorite waffle recipe.  I mixed up the batter last night and kept it in the fridge until this morning.   I set it out on the counter about an hour before I was ready to cook them.  I got 22 waffles out of a full batch.  They are light, crispy and delicious.   I will definitely make these again.

I love this recipe a lot! It tastes a bit like A & W waffle! But it's true I need to wash a lot dishes and longer time compare to baking soda rise waffle. I do nearly 15 waffles, and put some half cook waffles in freezer, later I bake directly (no need defrost) around 15 mins/200 degree (preheat), and it still taste soft inside and crispy outside!

Delicious recipe, however these were a bit too greasy and the butter was pooling under our waffle iron while making. Next time I will cut the butter down to 1/2 cup.

Since Santa brought me a Belgian waffle iron for Christmas, I have been on a quest to find the best Belgian waffle recipe.  Well, the family has tried 5 different types (Krusteaz plain mix, Krusteaz Belgian waffle mix, Liege waffles with pearl sugar, Norweigan waffles, and this recipe), and the verdict is in:  this recipe is the clear winner.  It's easy and delicious, even though you wouldn't think so by the directions.  I don't bother separating the eggs...too much work...they still come out fluffy.  Too much time to rise in the morning?  I just whip the batch together (without separating the eggs) the night before, throw it in the fridge overnight, and it's ready in the morning.  You might ask how long it takes to make the batter...5 minutes.  All I have to do in the morning is plug in the waffle iron, drink my coffee while the iron is heating up, and I'm good to go!  It's a great relaxing and delicious way to start my day.  One more thing...we eat them sprinkled with powdered sugar, and they're delicious!  No syrup needed...

This recipe deserves a spotlight. The best waffles I've had in my life- I make it for all 8 kids and many times a child splits one. These are the fluffiest things! . My trick to keeping everything warm is to use glass bowls and preheat them in the microwave. I reuse my kitchen made mixing bowl after mixing the batter to beat the egg white and then combine them in a large warm glass bowl. Then I stick the proofing mixture in the cold oven with a cup of boiling water on the side for heat and humidity. Great Sunday breakfast! I've made this recipe no less than 50 times now and if you follow the instructions it comes out exactly like the picture.

This is the best waffle recipe I have found. Need to make early for breakfast, but it's our favorite. Always need to double it, never have enough!

Liked the recipe a lot; light and crisp. I substituted the yeast with 100 grams of homemade sourdough starter (50/50 flour/water)and let rise overnight in fridge. Before using, let the batter come to room temperature.  It gave the waffles a slight sour taste and chewy texture.

Perfect and delicious! Nice thick crispy outside, delicious fluffy inside. To reduce the number of dirty dishes, I melt the 3/4 cup butter in a big glass bowl that I then use to mix the rest of the batter. I warm 1/2 cup of the milk in a big glass measuring cup, pour 1/4 cup with the butter, and add the yeast to the remaining 1/4 cup. I follow the directions for the batter and once the yeast is added, I use that same measuring cup to warm up the remaining milk. Eggs whites are whipped in the stand mixer so that's two dirty bowls plus measuring tools. I've made them without waiting, waiting one hour, and waiting overnight. I don't recommend not waiting because the last waffles were definitely the best, but otherwise I don't think the length of time matters as long as it's at least 1 hour. Keeping the cooked waffles in the oven keeps them nice and crisp - I recommend following that step.

Wonderful! Delicious! Amazing!  Only modification I made was to let the batter slow rise in the refrigerator overnight. Worked perfectly and the batter was ready to go in the morning. This recipe is a keeper that I will use time and again.

Worth the effort, but we usually stick with the easy ones that don't require yeast. These are a lot of work and aren't great for a spontaneous breakfast. I do follow the recipe as written.

EDIT: If sitting overnight, add 1/4 cup extra sugar and 1 tsp vanilla to batter right before baking for sweeter taste. Also, for those complaining about soggy/not crispy waffles, the issue may be the gadget or improper cooking technique. My friend volunteered to cook the waffles using my batter and she messed up pretty bad by not waiting long enough for it to crisp. They all came out soggy. Another time, I got to try out a fancy expensive waffle maker and it made such amazing crispy waffles even though I used the same recipe! I can't bring myself to buy any ol' diner waffle now because most of them taste inferior to this recipe.

************This was pretty good and rose beautifully as if it used baking soda/powder. As others stated, there is a definitely yeasty/sourdough-esque smell. It's different from the usual waffles. I felt a bit more sugar would make it even better. I did let it sit overnight so maybe the yeast took up a lot of the sugar? Next time. I might add extra honey to the batter right before cooking to sweeten it up. Also, I think another tablespoon of vanilla is in order! Overall, I'd keep this recipe and make again.

I omitted separating and beating the egg whites and instead beat the whole eggs and added them to the batter, with no noticeable negative effect. I left them in the fridge to rise overnight and they were fantastic the next morning.

We made the recipe and we thought it was okay. Had no flavor and tasted yeasty. The texture was a little doughy and rubbery even when we followed the recipe exactly. One person liked this recipe in our house but the other three did not.

It's time to get rid of the waffle mix and do the real deal. I've had nothing but wonderful comments about my waffles since using this recipe. Recommendations: Take the eggs out of the refrigerator early. Cold egg whites don't whip up very well.

True Belgian waffles.  As long as you get the yeast to activate, if you don't like these, you either don't like waffles or you did something wrong.  Make sure you have the right kind of waffle iron.  I've made this a number of times and frankly I've screwed up on a number of steps and they still came out the best that I've ever had outside of a couple higher end restaurants I can think of.

I tried this recipe too and it is the best ever so far; they are so delicious that I can eat them also without whipped cream, mapple syroup, fruits etc 

Plus they do not have that smell and taste like others, they are simple delicious!

Try these with greek yogurt instead of whipped cream, they are tasty and healthier!

I made triple sized recipe for Christmas brunch since I was having 18 people. I made them all in separate bowls since there were some reviews of it not turning out if doubled. Made an error and put the whites in the bowl, not the yokes, so one batch did not have the whites whipped til stiff. So here is the difference if you do not whip the whites. The batches with whipped whites rose much more and made twice as many waffles. Got about 16+ out of each. The one without whipping whites made exactly 8. Tasted the same to me, but the one with unwhipped whites was more dense, not at fluffy. I also did a slow rise in the fridge overnight, so you can make ahead.

I made the recipe last week and it turned of some mighty tasty waffles. It made enough for more waffles then I could eat and I decided to store the batter with plastic wrap laying on turn of the batter. I used one of those shaker cups. So this week I decided I wanted a pecan waffle and took out the shake cup. Gave it a mix and started making my waffle. Viola, pecan waffles. Still very tasty as the first. This recipe is definitely a keeper. I thought of taking a picture but I ate it, the pecan waffle that is.

This was good. My first time making any type of waffles. I followed the recipe just as it says. It seems like it took forever to make & they came out spongy. I wanted them a little crispier but maybe it was my waffle maker. My daughter did love them tho.. So I will def keep using this recipe.

A very flavorful waffle.  I halved the recipe and got 5 round Belgian waffles.  I melted the butter in the milk then added the yeast after the milk had cooled a bit. Also, I did not separate the yolks & whites but used the whisk attachment to mix the batter.  Thus I reduced the dishes used in prep.

I liked the flavor of these waffles, but the texture was a bit heavier than I was expecting.  I think it was because the batter was a bit thick.  I will try this with using less flour and more milk next time.

I agree with others that you should substitute for 1/4 of buttermilk (not for the yeast raising, though) and make this the night before.  The buttermilk adds a nice flavor (if you like buttermilk, as I do).  I did not let this raise for an hour on the counter, but instead put it right in the fridge after I folded in the egg whites (we were grilling outside and I did not want to forget about it).  It sat for about 12 hours and was delicious, but I had some left over batter. We finished them the next morning, and I liked them even more (36 hours in the fridge).  My waffle iron did not make them crispy, but I eat them with butter and maple syrup, so they weren't going to stay crispy anyway.  Thanks for the recipe!  Decidedly a keeper.

I agree with most of the reviews...this is a great recipe. But wanted to add a note that these waffles FREEZE better than any other recipe I have tried! They do not shrink or shrivel or get that baking powder taste after freezing and reheating. We just pop the frozen squares in the toaster oven and we are off! Today it is HOT outside and it is so nice to know I have a freezer full of waffles and I do not have to cook dinner. THANK YOU!

These are fantastic - prepared exactly as written and worth the time.  I tried a few other recipes and the waffles came out dry, these even feel more substantial to pick up.  I make these once a week and we enjoy the leftovers for a quick breakfast.

This is my first time making these. PERFECT!  I followed the directions exactly and these waffles were amazing!  I topped them with French vanilla ice cream, whip cream, fresh fruit and dusted with icing sugar! And of course maple syrup!  Thanks for sharing this recipe. It has been added to my favorites!

I was very disappointed. These are heavy bread like waffles.  I think beating egg whites is a wasted step on any waffle recipe. Eggs puff up when cooked.  I am glad so many others liked them.

I made this on Christmas morning.  While it was a bit involved the waffles were absolutely wonderful!! My kids and I enjoyed these for breakfast for two days after! Don't be turned off by the amount of time these take to make, they turned out perfect!! We will definitely be making these again in the near future.

I made these for an condo get together.  At first they ate everything BUT the waffles (bacon, hash browns, pancakes, etc...), but once one person tried them, they were gone within a couple of minutes.  People even came down 20 minutes afterwards asking for them because they heard how good they were.  The people voted for this one.

I have always had a problem with the batter "poofing" up enough to fill my Belgian waffle iron - this batter certainly did the trick! I used 3 cups white flour and 1 cup whole wheat pastry flour, plus 1 Tbsp. buckwheat flour and 1 Tbsp cornmeal. Crispy outside, tender inside made for delicious waffles. This recipe made enough for at least 16 waffles - we used the first half of the batter on the first morning, and stored the batter overnight in the fridge for the next morning. Just as good the next day...maybe even better!

Great waffles!  My cousin was coming for a visit, and had told me he was bringing his Belgian waffle iron (one of those "flip" wafflers like you see at hotels).  He said something about buying a mix for the waffles, and I said no way - I'll make scratch.  Found this recipe, made it without any changes "except" (isn't there always a "but") I made it the night before and let it sit in the fridge - I hate dorking around with recipes on Sunday mornings.  We all loved it -my husband grades new recipes, and says this is a definite A (and he can be a tough grader).  It does make a lot - I made 9 1/2 waffles.

I make this several times a year.  We love it.  Hubby has been to Belgium and he said these are like he ones he has there.  I make the mix the night before like other reviewers.  Worth the effort to make them.

This one is my favorite because the outside came out crispier than the waffles I made before. My husband prefer the fluffy one from here, "Waffle I". My yeast didn't proof correctly but went ahead and made the batter anyways. I had to rise the dough a little longer. The second time I made this, I followed other suggestions to add a teaspoon of sugar to the milk/yeast and sure enough, it proofed!

Without any butter, I substituted with margarine. With little time, I put all the ingredients in a jug and used a hand blender to blend everything. Waited til the batter rose to double, then put a golf ball size amount of batter into the batter iron. Ate it with coffee gelato that I made myself. Crispy & cool.

awesome. I made these 2x now. First time waiting an hour and second time slow rise overnight in fridge. The slow rise batter seemed quite a bit thicker than when I waited an hour. Both turned out great in taste and texture, but the second time was a little harder to get evenly spread in maker without overfilling it.

I made these for the first time today.  Even with the old, thrift store waffle iron I own, they are the best, BEST waffles I've ever had!  I've never even made home-made waffles before, but this recipe came out perfectly.  Just crispy enough at the edges and the flavor is wonderful.  I like them plain best, without any topping, as the flavor stands all on it's own.  Thanks for this recipe!!!

were not light, could not eat plain because they had no taste.  I expected then to be light and fluffy I was so very wrong.  I am going back to the buttermilk recipe I have that uses seltzer water.

Followed this recipe to a tee.  Unimpressed.  Tastes exactly like regular waffles to me.  Takes way more time than traditional waffles for no gain.  However, this is my first time making belgian waffles.

Exactly the waffle flavor and consistency I want. Tools are so very important to this turning out right. My waffle iron from the 70's just didn't cut it. We made the entire batch, and despite them not cooking evenly in our archaic machine, they froze well, and we reheated them in a toaster later on to have when we wanted.

You could replace some of the milk bij sparkling water (500 milk and 150 sp water).  Give a light mix.

I was never a huge fan of Belgian Waffles, but, I was home for a visit and my mom wanted to use her Belgian Waffle maker.  This was Delicious!  If only restaurants made Belgian Waffles this good!!  I followed the recipe exactly.  Turned me into a fan!

These were very heavy waffles and not easy to make...a bit time consuming, which many recipes are...but in this case it was not worth it.  Won't be trying this one again. Sorry :-( Maybe I did something wrong, but I don't think so! It's almost like there's too much flour in this recipe.

These are the best waffles I have ever had!!  I used to make waffles from mix, and always thought there has to be a better waffle out there. This recipe is tops.  Taste like restaurant/brunch waffles, crispy outside, tender, fluffy inside.  I followed the recipe to the letter. My only change was I couldn't make the waffles immediately, so after my batter had risen I stirred it a bit and put it in the fridge until I could make the waffles.  15 hours later and a second rise I had heaven on a plate.

A hit!  Not too difficult to make if you follow the instructions exactly which I did.  Be sure yeast has not expired. Batter was lumpy until it rose. Very fresh and light tasting.    I doubled the recipe and it made about 14 - 16 waffles.   Took to a dinner party in ziploc bags, then reheated a couple of hours later in a 375 preheated oven on cookie sheets lined with parchment paper for about 10 minutes turning once. My teenage kids loved them too.   A little time-consuming but worth it.   Served with the options of nutella, fruit topping, whip cream, vanilla ice cream and powdered sugar.

Just finished making these and they were definitely 5 stars!  I make everything from scratch so if you are like me, this was a very easy recipe!!!  My daughter loves waffles so I think we will be making these every week and freezing them.  My batch made 9 begian waffles.  I will be experimenting with whole wheat flour soon.

These were a bit too rich for my tastes - I had to let the batter sit overnight (I didn't see the "let rise for an hour" part until I'd finished putting all of the ingredients together), so that may have affected the flavor a bit. I've had the real belgian waffles before, and these ones were not nearly as sweet as the others I've had. (again, possibly because the batter sat overnight?) This was a lot of work for mediocre results. Won't be making this one again.

These were of course a little time-consuming but well worth it!  My usually very picky girls each ate two whole waffles...that's a big deal for them!  I have never had Belgian waffles before making these, so I don't have anything to compare them to.  But they were delicious in their own right!  I love baking with yeast so these were just up my alley.  Thanks for the recipe.

The recipe was fantastic and so filling that when I make them again, each of us will have a quarter of a waffle with topping which will most likely be enough to satisfy.

I made these waffles for father's day, topped with fresh strawberries and whipped cream.  Incredible taste. lightness, and texture.  I did have to add a little more milk to this recipe.  Mixing the batter the night before definitly resulted in better taste than IHOP.  wonderful!!

Perfection! Used the whole egg (no separating or whipping), and made it the night before to rise in 'fridge as suggested. Made strawberries with glaze from strawberry pie recipe on this site- more delicious than any restaurant.

Lets see...1.5 hours to prepare...tastes like a normal waffle (with 8 times the butter and sugar mind you)...won't cook in a standard waffle maker...these were DEFINITELY not worth the effort. I will never make this recipe again!  Save yourself time, effor, money, and frustration and cook some normal waffles.

Yum! Crispy with a nice yeast flavor. And as others have noted, they freeze very well. I made them the night before in my Kitchen Aid mixer bowl and they did not overflow (thankfully!).

Excellent!  I've always been partial to batters based on eggs and separately beaten whites (have something similar I use for pancakes).  Texture and flavor were wonderful.    We were lucky to find this one to break in our stove top cast iron waffle maker (regular size waffles).    If I were to make the batter the night before, I'd probably fold in the beaten egg whites just before cooking.  As far as the extra time, well most of it is waiting for the rise, during which most of the dishes can be washed and some bacon cooked.  But I'm biased because I enjoy spending time in the kitchen.

We bought a waffle maker at Costco (never go to costco hungry) so this was our first time making them.  Delicious and easy.  It is time consuming though so probably would make the batter the night before if wanting to eat early.  Will definitly be using this recipe with our new waffle maker.  :-)

Delicious. These taste very yeasty, which I love.  They are a lot of work but worth the effort because this recipe makes lots and I freeze them.  They are almost as delicious toasted.  I don't usually make changes to recipes but I did go down to 1 tsp. salt.  They were a touch too salty for my tastes the first time around.

I've been using this recipe for a couple years, it is a Sunday morning favorite with my family. Everyone loves these waffles, they're excellent! I've found that letting the mixture raise an extra 1/2 hr. makes them even lighter, especially if the mixture hasn't doubled in 1 hr.

These were so light!  Well worth the extra time it takes to let it rise.

If these don't turn out light and crispy, you are doing something wrong!  Don't give the recipe a bad review because you made a mistake! This is hands down the best waffle recipe I've ever come across.  It gets rave reviews every time I make it.

I searched the web trying to find the perfect recipe for a light crispy waffle and this is it. This is the most perfect waffle I've ever tasted!!! I made one slight adjustment...my yeast didn't work correctly with the warm milk so I used warm water with a little bit of sugar dissolved in it, that fixed the problem :) Enjoy!!

I'm posting this just to warn people... I read one of the reviews about making the batter the night before. I did that and put it in the refridgerator. An hour later I saw that it was collapsing so I took it out and left it on the counter all night. (it had a good cover). bad idea. They tatse like they have wine in them...a lot of wine. The texture is fantastic so we will try these again.

This was a great recipe.  I gave it 4 stars only because of the time involved.

The waffles came out nice and crunchy but fluffy on the inside.  The yeast really makes the difference.

I doubled the recipe and it did not double well at all.  The batter was thick and heavy and I had to literally stretch it over the waffle iron.  The waffles came out decent, but really not what I was hoping for...So watch out if you need to convert this recipe.

These were the BEST waffles I've ever tasted.  They were so fluffy and just the right amount of sweetness for Belgian waffles.

This is the best waffle recipe. It comes out very fluffy when I used the rotating waffle maker. I prepared the mixture and kept in the refrigerator overnight, the waffles were much better. I also added a teaspoon of ground cinnamon to the flour (I love cinnamon in pastries). I added some craisins to the mixture and my kids loved it.

Thanks for sharing the recipe with me.

My first attempt at making homemade Belgian Waffles... it was a success!! I made them the night before and just put the batter in the fridge. I doubled it and got 11 waffles using my belgian waffle maker. The only thing different I did was add 1 tsp of sugar to the yeast. I served this with the Easy Whipped Cream recipe from this site. These were very yummy!!

These were excellent waffles.  I had never made Belgian waffles before, but I suspect that I will be using this recipe many times in the future!  Thanks!

A month or so ago my husband purchased me a Belgian Waffle Iron.  I had been wanting to try to make the waffles from scratch, so this morning I used this recipe.  It is excellent!  My family loves them, and I will not purchase a box mix again.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!
