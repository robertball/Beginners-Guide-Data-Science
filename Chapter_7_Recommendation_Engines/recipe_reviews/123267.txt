Just made these a few minutes ago.  They came out great for such a simple recipe.  I was out of parsley but added about a tsp. of Italian seasoning and I think it added some good flavor.  I used a can of Pillsbury Buttermilk bisuits, but I think next time I'll use Grands or some other fluffier biscuit just to see if they could come out even better.  Will definitely make again.

Very Good!  I made this for a block dinner party and friends and family all enjoyed them. I made a double batch and they disappeared quickly.  I added minced garlic to the ingredients and I doubled the butter, onion, parmesan and parsley. Fabulous!

These were OK, but I didn't think they were anything to write home about.  I made some using the onion, parsley and Parmesan as called for, and some using garlic powder and Italian seasoning.  We preferred the garlic and Italian seasoning.

These little bites are phenomenal! I followed the recipe as written for the first batch and they were delicious. For the second batch I added a little garlic powder to the mix for added zing. However, this recipe is great as is!

This is a tasty snack. But you do need to keep your eye on them to make sure they don't burn.

I was looking for a way to make something fast without having to knead dough and all that stuff and this was a perfect way to jazz up biscuits already made. It's a save. :)

This was good, but needs to be served right away, it lost a lot of flavor when it cooled.

I don't feel I can really rate this, but for my own notes....I changed these to be sort of a garlic bread.  Used 1/2 tsp of garlic salt instead of minced onion, used Italian season in place of the parsley.  Turned out great!

I don't know what I did wrong but I did two batches of these and both burned on the bottom. The part that wasn't burnt tasted pretty good though. We added garlic powder (wish I would've had garlic salt), anyway I think that helped give it more flavor.  Very quick and easy way to turn blah biscuit dough into something better. Just wish I knew why mine burned on the bottom.

These were amazingly good.  I did add a little garlic powder like a few others have suggested.  I only use a 7.5 oz can of biscuits because thats what I had and I used up all the butter mixture.  So if you're using a 12 oz can I suggest doubling the butter mixture.  My daughter loved these and I will definately be making them again.

These are pretty good. I did add a bit of garlic powder. I served these with Pioneer Woman's Lasagne. Everyone gobbled them up. Be sure to watch these closely, they will scorch easily.

My entire family really enjoys these bites.  I do find that the original amounts are not quite enough to use up all the biscuits.  I usually double the recipe to use one can of biscuits.  They really absorb the butter-so quickly dip them, don't let let them rest for long.  We will be making these a lot for special meals.  With all that butter, it's not for everyday.

I got LOTS of Grands biscuits on sale and have been looking for ways to use them up.  This recipe worked out great!  I cut them in fourths and they came out great.  Thanks for a great alternative to boring old biscuits!

I made this recipe tonight with pillsbury grands butter flavor rolls and it was very yummy. Use a pizza roller to cut the rolls in 4s and it makes it very easy and fast. I will make this recipe again.

These did not come out as tasty as I hoped.  Maybe because I used America's Choice biscuit dough?  I'll definitely try again, because it's a nice app, but I'll try the brand name ingredients next time.

I have to give these a 5 based on the reviews of my family.  They were the hit of my Thanksgiving dinner for 12.  I added a pinch of garlic powder and cut the biscuits in half as I was serving them with a meal.  I imagine the flavor would be even better if cut in quarters as directed.

Wow!  These are so yummy.
I followed the recipe, but I used about 1/3 c of real butter.  It was the perfect amount of butter for one 12 ounce can of buiscuits.
YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!!
