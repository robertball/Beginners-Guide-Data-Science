This is a classic combination of ingredients in Italian cooking, one I'm very familiar with as I grew up with it and prepare it often myself. However, the idea of the paprika just did not appeal to me, so I left it out. I don't understand the need for it, or how it would add anything positive to an otherwise perfect dish. Using the Italian seasoning was new for me, as it's not generally something I'd add to this, but I used a good quality Tuscan blend, and used it sparingly.  No need to measure ingredients, just wing it with a little of this and a little of that to your liking--and finish with some good grated Parmesan or Romano cheese!

As written this was pretty bland. I used a whole head of garlic and served it topped with additional salt, pepper, and freshly grated parmesan cheese. This makes 8 servings, not 4.

If you don't use the butter, and this dish will turn out great. Important:  add the garlic towards the end of the sataueing process -- 'browned' garlic will have a bitter taste.  First, I like to cook the onions and mushrooms together, then chop and add the more delicate tomatoe and zuchinni.  Finally add the garlic for the last 3-5 minutes.  This is a nice and easy dish to prepare, with the majority of the time waiting for water to boil, and slicing/dicing the veggies.  Also, I suggest some fresh (prefered) or dry basil.

My 6 year old loved this!  It smelled so good while cooking it.  I am fasting so this will be a something to eat when I am finished.  We made a couple changes.  I used all organic ingredients, used 2 tomatoes and 3 cloves of garlic.  We are trying to do more meatless dinners and this recipe definitely helps with that!

This recipe was good.  I added 2 cloves of garlic instead of one and 2 tomatoes instead of one.  It was delicious.  I think I will try putting fresh basil in next time or a little white wine.

I really loved this. I lightened it up by cutting back pasta to 12 oz, olive oil to 1/4 cup, and butter to 3 TB. I also used smoked paprika, which really made the dish. I can't imagine it would be better with more butter and oil.

Simply delicious. I thought it looked liked way too many veggies once they were all cut up and ready to go in but they really cooked down.

This was delicious! I added additional garlic and omitted the paprika. I also used angel hair pasta and cut the zucchini and onions into match stick type pieces. It was pretty! I also added the mushrooms to the saute pan about half way into the cooking to keep them a bit firm. The only thing I was missing was a good crusty piece of french bread!

So good! Only thing I did differently was to not cook the tomatoes with the rest of the ingredients. I left them raw and mixed them in. So good!

Simple, but good!  I planned this meal for a night where I knew there wouldn't be much time for meal prep.  Wow!  Quick recipe, and it was delicious!  I forgot to buy mushrooms, so I didn't add those.  The recipe was still very good!  I'm looking forward to making it again with mushrooms!  I've never added paprika in a pasta dish, but was surprised at how good it was in this dish!  One tablespoon seemed like a lot, but it was the prefect amount.  Great meal for a night where you don't have a lot of time, but want a good meal!

So easy to make!  I pretty much followed all the directions this first time, except for a couple things. Instead of one chopped tomato, I halved cherry sized roma tomatoes, and put them in toward the end so they wouldn't be mushy. I also tossed in a handful of fresh spinach at the VERY end, giving it just enough time to wilt slightly. Spinach didn't add much flavor (as expected) but it added a nice color and packs a big pop of nutrition! I think for an extra zing next time I'll add some brined kalamata olives.

I've been making something very similar to this for years & it's a great late summer dinner! I use less oil & pasta, more tomato, garlic & zucchini & no paprika at all. This recipe seems a bit heavy on the oregano too....

Such goodness! Loved it as left overs. I added some banana peppers to mine to add a bit more tanginess. I will be making this again for quick meals.

This is really good, but I added some things. I used broccoli instead of zucchini. I also added some corn kernals. I used some fresh basil. And then I also added a little precooked cut up bacon that I had left plus shredded a little deli ham into it. Really yummy. Also, I always use shallots for onions. I can't take regular onions for some reason.

I added Butterball Turkey Sausage and sliced green peppers to this meal and it was perfect. Don't forget a dash of garlic salt to taste instead of regular salt.

Great to add any fresh garden veggie too!!! Yum!!!

We love this recipe pretty much as it is.  The only little extra thing I do is add some crumbled feta cheese to the dish at the end of making it.  It is a family favorite and I've made it numerous times.

Very, very good. I was hesitant about the amount of paprika in here but this was excellent. I used veggie (carrot/squash) bowtie pasta. Added more garlic as we love it, fresh basil at the end with a little drizzle of olive oil. The following day I heated some up for lunch and it was even BETTER, especially with a sprinke of parmesan cheese on. Even the hubby and kids liked this!

Kinda bland as is. I’d recommend reviewing other users’ ideas for kicking up the flavor a notch. Maybe add some chicken too.

This recipe was a hit with my family.

The pasta turned out just the right tenderness. The spices also flavored the pasta.

I will make this recipe again.

The first thing I'd say is that this recipe makes way more than four servings.  Using a full pound of farfalle is too much, unless you're really looking forward to some leftovers.  The basic recipe is pretty easy, and not too bad, but a little on the bland side.  We added more seasonings, as we generally do, and also added two cups of cooked, cubed chicken, which turned out to be a good idea, seeing as how there was so much pasta.  We'll definitely make it again, just using less pasta and more of the other ingredients.

"That's what I'm talking about!!!"(Kip from Napoleon Dynamite)...This was so delicious! I read the reviews before I made it and followed with some suggestions such as adding two tomatoes instead of one and adding 3 cloves of garlic instead of one which made it come out great! I'm not sure how it would have been, maybe bland, if I didn't add these extra ingredients. I also added some parmesan cheese in the end. Hopefully everyone likes my picture, I noticed no one really used bow-tie pasta for this. It was very pretty.

I am not a cook, and this recipe was easy for me.  I exchanged the mushrooms for water chestnuts and the zucchini for broccoli.  It turned out amazing.  I really loved it.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I made this for dinner tonight. It was good but definitely too much pasta and not enough veggies. Next time I make it I will reduce the amount of pasta. My husband suggested doubling up on the vegetables.
Also, the picture shown above is not bow tie pasta (just saying not a big deal). Overall, it was a nice summer dish.

Very mildly flavoured dish as is. I added quite a few red pepper flakes but this dish needs way more flavour. I will try it again with additions such as sundried tomatoes. A good starting point.

It is very filling. we had 10 oz of mushrooms rather than 8. More garlic is definitely needed. This recipe is very tasty and good.

This recipe is so yummy! The only change I made was to add 1/2 cup of heavy cream near the end to create more of a sauce. And since I'm allergic to mushrooms, I had to leave those out. My husband and I both love this healthy recipe--we make it almost every week!

This was a decent, fairly filling, and probably healthy recipe, but it didn't wow me. I made it exactly as written, except that I forgot my store sells farfalle in 12-ounce packages, so instead of going back to the store for more, I made up the rest of the pound of pasta by using penne. I cooked everything for the full 20 minutes. I ate it all over 2 days, but I found the seasonings to be kind of blah. Worth trying, but I probably won't be making this again.

This was okay.  I found the amount of oregano lent a bitter taste to the dish.  I topped mine with fresh grated parmesan cheese, which I found to be a tasty addition.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

DELICIOUS!!! Perfect for a summer dinner as it is nice a light. I didnt have fresh tomatoes so I used a can of Italian diced tomatoes with oregano ans basil. I did drain them since I figured it would be to much liquid. My 6 year old even liked the flavor although he picked out the mushrooms and tomatoes. Will be making this again for sure :-)

Absolutely delicious. Thanks!  I left out the oregano and went less on the olive oil. Sprinkled tons of parmesean cheese on it. So good!

Delicious and simple recipe was a hit for a healthy lunch!! Tried cherry tomatoes instead of regular tomatoes and shallots for a slightly onion flavor garnished with parmigian cheese and it came out awesome!!

This was so-so for my family.  Too much fat and not enough flavor. Not sure why so much oil and butter were needed.  Will probably leave out the butter next time.  There's potential here...
