I omitted the eggs and made this as a side dish for dinner.  It was somewhat bland for our taste and the chayote softer than we would have liked, which would have been fine for breakfast.   I will make it again and substitute pepperjack cheese and boiling the chayote for 10 minutes or less.   Or I might add sharp cheddar and a diced jalapeno.  This is a great jumping off point for learning how to use chayote.

I added a lot more spices. Like: oregano, cumin, cilantro, chives and garlic powder. I substituted the American cheese with Colby. It was fantastic. I will make this again, for sure.

Thought this was delish!  I swapped the American for cheddar cheese but do think pepper jack would be yummy too. It reminded me of a cross between a hash and omelette, although the onion made it taste sweeter (vidalia).  Would definitely make it again.
