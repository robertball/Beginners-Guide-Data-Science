I sauteed the mushrooms and garlic together, mixed the other ingredients and then put the saute in hot and man, this is delicious as a warm dip! I did amp up the garlic a little and didn't have walnut handy but this is a definite make again for me.

This is a unique taste.  I love mushrooms, cooked, raw, everyway there is.  I made as written.  Next time I think I would cook the mushrooms (barely) to make this more mellow.
