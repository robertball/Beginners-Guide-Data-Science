We really loved this recipe!  I used the zest of two lemons.  The juice from those two lemons wasn't quite 1/2 cup, so I had to add some real lemon to get the full amount.  I also put the zest and sugar into a food processor to grind up the zest (I peeled it first).  The only thing I would do differently next time is put everything into my VitaMix right before putting it into the ice cream maker... that would reduce the bits of lemon zest more than the food processor.  But the proportion of ingredients is perfect!

Divine! It has a nice 'icy' texture with a creamy taste. The lemon and sugar are perfectly balanced, not too sweet and just the right amount of tang. I zested all of the lemons that I used for the juice and it was just right. I tasted the mixture before I put it in the freezer, and I could have drank the whole thing on the spot. Plus, it couldn't be easier. Thanks for the recipe!

Wow! This is super good and so easy!  I made it exactly as stated, except I put it in my ice cream maker after the freeze/stir process; then I put the mixture in an airtight container and let freeze completely. It's wonderfully creamy, tart, sweet and refreshing. This is definately a keeper.  I can't wait to try orange!  Thanks for sharing ECULVER!

I used Seville (bitter/marmalade) oranges instead of lemons for the juice and zest, and whole milk instead of half and half. Took much longer to freeze so I continued to stir every hour for about 9 hours, until a thick slush, then allowed to freeze overnight. Could have been from my substitutions or maybe because I used a deep rather than shallow pan. Tasted great in the morning and not too hard. Thanks for the recipe!
