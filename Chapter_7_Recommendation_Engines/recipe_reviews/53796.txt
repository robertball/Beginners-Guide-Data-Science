This recipe was delicious! I made this rub with dried rosemary and thyme(using only 2 tsp instead of 2 tbsp.) since I did not have fresh on hand. I added about a tsp of water to hydrate the herbs before adding the oil. I also substituted a pearl onion already in the frig for the shallot.

I made this roast for Christmas and the good quality of the meat with the fresh herbs and spices made this the most delicious holiday meat I've tasted. The cloves especially add the festive flavor and blend well with the meat. I made it with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and honey glazed carrots.

Ok I must have done something wrong.  I used the rub and it made the house smell wonderful while cooking.  When we started eating the dish, we couldn't taste the rub.  I don't know what I did wrong.  I will try again to see if it was my blunder.  Thanks for posting.

Instead of blending in the food processor, I put everything in a bowl and just rubbed over the beef tenderloin. Left out the orange peel and substituted some orange juice in its place; didn't have six hours to marinade but it didn't matter. This was pretty darn tasty; I put seasoning salt and fresh ground pepper on the tenderloin as well but still added those two seasonings to the mix as well. Took longer to cook. Served with a tomato/basil/fresh mozzerella salad and the pan fried asparagus recipe from this site. Great meal. Drank Zinfandel which complemented the meal tremendously.

Wow, what a great rub!!  Every year we are invited to visit some friends up north for a snowmobiling/ice fishing weekend.  This year I decided to bring dinner for Saturday night.  We used this rub on an 8 lb. tenderloin (had to make 4 times the recipe) and it was a huge HIT!!!

The aroma from the rub/roast filled the house with a wonderful smell and the taste matched the smell.  Even my 9 year old loved it.

Thanks Eileen for the great recipe!

this was my first attempt with making a marinade and it turned out awesome! I hosted a dinner party and one of my guests is a chef! I had to make this good - and it turned out awesome! People are still talking about it - the only thing I changed was that I added lemon zest instead of orange zest. I also only chilled for 2-3 hours, so I can imagine how much better it would have been had I left it longer. It cant possibly get any better though thanks so much!

I made this recipe for Christmas 2009. My only problem was with the roast time, it took longer than 35 minutes to roast, approximately 1 1/2 hrs for 2 roasts. They came out perfect. My guests just loved it, the flavor and aroma in the house was awesome. Thank you.

Made this for Christmas dinner.  Got good reviews from the family (not young kids).  However, I could not get the rub to be smooth enough in the food processor.  This should have been done in a spice grinder or w/ mortar & pestle.  As it was, we had to scrape rosemary from the servings.

Great recipe, thanks for sharing!  Did not use the orange zest, nutmeg, or cloves.  Cut way back on the salt (1/2 tsp. for a 1 1/2lb. roast) and served with beef gravy (using drippings from pan) and a starch and a veggie for the sides.

The steak didn't come out as nice as I expected, I could have put in too much thyme as I could taste only that n the steak was dry.....What did I do wrong other than putting too much thyme?

Made this for my husband's birthday party dinner and we were all really impressed.  Grilled on indirect heat on the Weber.  This recipe is going in the vault for sure.

I like food with a lot of flavor and a lot of flavor is what you get with this rub. Fresh herbs are a must.

This was very tasty!  I didn't have a food processor, so I chopped it fine and left the rub on for about 12 hours.  The meat was very tender.  My only issue was that the rosemary was a little overpowering - I would go with 1 tbsp next time.

I love meat --- not like -- LOVE.  This recipe is PERFECT for the holidays.  Aromatic, seasonal, and with plenty of flavors to keep the pallet entrigued.  That said...in my opinion...the selection of the meat makes all the difference.  For my purposes, I used a USDA Prime tenderloin.  It was about 10% more than what you'd pay for Choice, but it absolutely makes a difference.  
I've also used this recipe on bone in roasts and it works just as well !  YUM YUM YUM!

This is the best beef tenderloin we have ever had. We made a 1 lb. tenderloin but made enough marinade for 2 lbs. VERY moist!! We had to cook it for an extra 10 minutes to get it to 140 degrees but our roaster is very heavy.

This was excellent.  My children happily ate their green beans so that they could have more meat (a rarity in my house).  The only thing I changed was to cook it to a temp of 160 for med-well instead of rare (personal preference) which obviously took a few minutes longer.  We will be making this again!

Excellent!  I added another tbsp of oil and put the oil/spice combination in a plastic bag with the meat for about 4 hours.  The meat was very tasty and made for a nice New Years celebration.

I used this recipe for a beef rib eye roast. It was very aromatic but I felt it overwhelmed the smell of the beef. Next time I will only use salt and pepper. The flavor of the herbs did not seem to affect the taste of the meat. Sorry, I will not use this recipe again.

Marinated this overnight and served as a Sunday dinner for friends.  Excellent marinade with a wonderful aroma and flavor.  Many people came in the kitchen while this was cooking to ask what smelled so good. Served this with roasted lemon horseradish new potatoes recipe from this site.  I thought I was going to get marriage proposals after this meal.

Fantastic!  I made this roast using all fresh herbs from our garden.  It had incredible flavor which carried throughout all the meat, not just the end pieces.  I will be making this again.

Awesome!  It was a HUGE hit at Christmas Dinner.  I added the juice of the orange I zested and I also poked holes in the meat with a fork because I forgot to marinate it for 6 hours - YIKES!  

I also created two sauces - a RED WINE SAUCE by adding red wine to the juices from the meat after it was cooked and then a little cornstarch mixed with wine and heated until thickened...

and a WHITE SAUCE using some of the left over marinade mixed with milk and then adding a little cornstarch mixed with milk and heated until thickened.  They were both delicious and a nice addition!

The meat was very tender but we felt the rosemary overwhelmed the taste.  Would probably not make again.  Thanks for letting us try.

This was a great recipe.  I used a beef roast instead of a tenderloin and cooked it for 3 hours.  It was great.  I had the whole family over for my first big meal and they loved it.

Wow! This is the best roast beef I've EVER made/had! It fills the house with the yummiest of aromas. I used it on a round roast instead of the tenderloin, the left overs make the tastiest of roast beef sandwiches. We have a year round herb garden, fresh herbs are the best!

Very flavorful but not overpowering.  Some unexpected spices make this a very interesting and tasteful meat dish.  I served it with mashed potatoes and honey glaced carrots.  It was wonderful and easily feeds a crowd.  Got a lot of compliments for it.

First, I used a technique I learned from Chef John, to always dip the meat in flour, salt, and pepper, spank it in, and then sear it in a frying pan with olive oil just enough to brown it all over. That seals in the juices while cooking. Then I made the marinade while the meat was cooling off.
>
Instead of fresh spices, I just used 1 tsp. from bottled spices. (Where I live, I cannot buy a small packet of fresh herbs but have to buy a potted plant, and they always die on me, and they're too expensive for just one use.) And I substituted orange juice instead of the peel. 
>
I hadn't read the recipe through the day before when I bought the ingredients I needed, so when it came to roasting it, I didn't have the 6 hours for it to marinade, but it still turned out well. 
>
For preparing it and roasting it, I used the tying technique from the video on Natasha's Kitchen and roasted it at 500? with a meat thermometer set for 138? because I like mine cooked at medium doneness, ratner than medium-well. I followed Natasha's doneness chart at https://natashaskitchen.com/roasted-beef-tenderloin/#jump-to-recipe, using the meat thermometer stuck in the thickest part of the meat. 
>
It turned out great. It was very tender and juicy and cooked just right. My son doesn't like it pink in the middle, as I do, so he ate the meat from the ends, which were thinner and more well done. We served it with mashed potatoes and some Bearnaise Sauce, which added to the flavor of the meat. It was delicious!

The only changes I made was I left out the orange zest and the cloves. Otherwise I made it exactly as written. It was the best beef roast I have ever made, so yes, I will make it again.

You need to cut way back on the orange zest.  I used an 8 pound roast so doubled the recipe.  Had to scrape the rub off toward the end of the cook time as ALL you could taste was orange.  After this, it was great.

Made it for family for Easter and it was a hit! Everyone raved how they would pay to eat this at a restaurant! I followed other reviews that suggested using dry seasoning but adding a bit of water to hydrate the spices. Also, used a bit of orange juice in place of the orange zest. I made one pork loin and used the same amount of spices. Refrigerated for almost 24 hours.  Will definitely make again!

I made this for 20 people (first time cooking beef tenderloin, I was terrified) but it turned out fantastic - everyone was saying it was the best meat they'd ever tasted!  
The meat was about 8 lbs total (after trimming), I cut into (approx.) 4" pieces.  I put the rub on overnight, then turned in the morning.  
My changes (only due to availability) - no orange zest - 1/4 cup of lemon juice instead, no shallot - small sweet onion instead, I don't have a food processor so I chopped everything very fine, added bay leaves whole in between cut slabs.
I also found it took a tad longer than 35 minutes, but after checking at 45, it had reached 140, so I turned off oven and prepared the rest of the meal.  When we carved it, it was perfect - bigger pieces were rosy (not bloody!) and smaller pieces still pink and tender.
Thanks so much for an awesome recipe!  I'll never be afraid to cook this expensive cut again!

I prepared two 7.5 pound tenderloin roasts for a holiday dinner.  This recipe was a HUGE hit!  While preparing the rub, I was concerned it would be too rich in shallot flavor (smelled very strong).  Once completed, it was just right!

Delicious and flavorful! I substituted the orange zest with orange juice and it worked out perfectly.  I will say that it doesn't take as  long as 6 hours and 55 minutes to get the meat to 140 degrees (it was a 7 lb tenderloin). We roasted it for 2 hours and thought we'd take it out and check on it. It was way over 140 degrees and almost well done. Plus, if you're going to let it sit for another hour before eating, check on it after an hour and a half then let it sit out with the cover still over it. The heat can still cook the meat and you definitely don't want it close to medium well when you take it out of the oven.

I made it pretty much as it was printed and it turned out great!  It made it into my recipe file and I WILL be making it again!  My friend's husband kept sneaking back to the kitchen to nibble the spices left in the pan once the roast had been cooked.  I paired it with Bordelaise Sauce made from the Good Housekeeping Illustrated cookbook and roasted vegetables. Great meal -- thanks for the recipe!

I'm not sure I can express how delicious this was! Super easy, too. No shallot so I used onion. No fresh thyme either, so I used dried. I also simply chopped some of the herbs and mixed with oil, foregoing making a completely true paste. But it still turned out wonderfully. Thank you SO much for a truly wonderful and easy recipe that I WILL make again!

A nice idea to start with but a little plain for my taste.  The end pieces and outer layer of the roast were very good but the bulk of the meat just tasted like...meat.  If I were to make this again, I would mix the spices with a lot of olive oil and inject it in the meat before marinating overnight.
