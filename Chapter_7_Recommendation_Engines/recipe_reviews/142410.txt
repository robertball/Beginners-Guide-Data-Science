Fantastic! I wrapped mine in foil and threw in a 400 degree oven for 20 minutes. So delicious. Can't wait to make it again!

Helpful Hint: a friend made this for us (with the addition of a fresh rosemary sprig) and we used the new Reynolds no-stick foil. Everything stuck to the corn and it was delicious!

I made this tonight for Father's Day (after seeing this recipe on Paula's Deen show two days ago).  It was really good.  I HATE mayonaise, but really wanted to try the recipe how it was shown on the show, so I used it.  I just brushed a little on-basically to use as an adhesive for the parm and seasonings.  I could not taste the mayo at all once it was grilled.  The flavors of the corn, chili powder and cheese were a nice blend.  Will definitely do this again.  Corn on the cob is great by itself, but it is fun to kick it up a bit too!

This is the traditional Mexican way of eating corn.  Just we normally put the toppings on after grilling the corn so I wanted to try this recipe for the foil packets.  I sprinkled the parmesan on the corn after removing the packets from the grill because a lot of reviewers said the cheese sticks to the foil.  There's no doubt this is the best way to eat grilled corn.

I think we left this on the grill a little too long. Even with that, the flavor was a nice change from plain butter.  Next time we'll have to keep a better eye on it.  EDIT: I tried this recipe again, but grilled the corn in husks and left the whole mayo thing out completely.  In a separate bowl I mixed together grated parmesan cheese, chili powder, salt, pepper, and added 1 tsp. of smoked paprika.  When the corn came off the grill we buttered it and then sprinkled the cheese/spice mixture onto it - much better!!!

I made this tonight and it was wonderful! My husband even loved it! I changed the serving to 2, since it was just the two of us and made a couple modifications. I used Hellmans light to save on the fat and used a little less of the chili powder. I mixed the mayo w/the cheese, spread the mix on the corn, then sprinkled the pepper/salt/chili powder mixture. Turned out great!! Will make this again

I love this recipe.  The only thing I do differently is sprinkle the parmesan cheese after the corn is done cooking.  Otherwise the cheese stuck to the  tinfoil.  Delicious.

Delicious and different, but worth trying.  We usually just soak our corn and grill on the BBQ in the husks, but I saw this recipe a while ago and wanted to try it.  Easy to make, and nice to eat because you don't put extra butter on once it is cooked, so less messy than usual.  Also this is the first time I bought the non-stick foil, and accidentally wrapped one ear with the dull side out.  That ear had all of the cheese and seasonings cook off onto the foil, while the others had a nice 'crust' from the Parmesan and seasonings.  Everyone else liked it as is, so am giving it a 5 star rating.  The only thing I would do different is to use a bit less salt, as I think the mayo and the Parmesan would be enough on their own.

Delish! I used unsalted butter to grease my foil. The parmesan still stuck but this corn is so good! I also added granulated garlic.

This was a nice change.  It had a nice flavor, but I would suggest leaving the salt out and until  after grilling. With the mayo and cheese, it already has a fair amount of salt and think that 1 t. is more than it needs.

Tastes good! I'm just not a fan of getting the mayo grease! I baked it for 20 minutes @ 400 since I don't have a grill. Good texture!

A good way to do corn. I had to substitute  and use my oven because I was out of gas for my grill. It came out good you just have to cook it for about 30 min instead of 10.

The corn turned out wonderful!  I had the same issue as others in that my cheese stuck to the foil (and I even sprayed non-stick spray).  My husband went back for a second piece and his cheese did not stick to the foil that time so maybe it's just a matter of letting it rest in the foil for a while before unwrapping.  We will definitely make this again!  I made this along with the turkey pesto burgers and grilled potatoes from this site and it's one of the best meals I've made!

This is an excellent recipe that I just prepared yesterday for a July 4 cookout.  Everyone raved!  One suggestion . . . many reviewers complained about the cheese sticking to the foil . . . just spray the foil with Pam before wrapping the corn and the foil will not stick to the cheese.  Happy Grilling!!

This was delicious!  We grilled it, but because we like the flavors so much I will definitely try in the oven as others have suggested.  Did use non-stick foil and almost all the topping stayed on the corn.  Used light mayo for less calories - wonderful!

Made this for company. My Mexican friend was so impressed and stated she had never had corn this way before which suprised me. My kids loved it with all the cheese. I did take into account that many people said the topping stuck to the foil so I oiled the foil and didn't experience much sticking at all.

This dish is usually called Cuban corn in my experience. Everyone has there way of preparing dishes like this. They tend to go through a transformation from generation to generation. It's an excellent dish. Use non-stick spray on your foil though. And right before you eat it, squeeze some fresh lime juice on it. YUM!!!

my hubby wouldn't eat it, nor would my 4 year old daughter.  They both thought it has a sour taste to it.  However my 3 yr old son and I really liked it.  Probably wouldn't make it again since it doesn't seem to compare to good ole buttered corn on the cob.

First time trying this was Memorial Day.  Grilled 12 ears, half Paula Style-half with garlic butter.  Friends and family LOVED IT!  Will never do the regular again.  This is a keeper!

I go to a women's college. We sat around and talked about food from home. As we didn't have a kitchen, we then spent the first few weeks speculating as to how we might prepare it with a microwave and a tea kettle, and after extensive research, we bailed on it and gave in to the horrendous cafeteria food.   I learned about preparing corn like this from some of my friends from SoCal. They first told me 11 months ago, and it's been on my mind since then. This recipe is not a bad way to do it, though I think it needed more chili powder, and it's best to throw on the cheese afterwards.  But this is street food. You can't really mess it up. It's a great recipe for experimentation.  However, I would say don't cut out the mayonnaise, because it really adds quite a bit.

We did not like this at all. We ate it, but it made the corn dry. The corn we had was right out of the field and excellent with just butter, salt, and pepper. This sounds good in theory, but when compared to buttered corn it couldn't compete.

Well, I can say that the mayo and chili powder added a nice element to corn on the cob, but I would recommend leaving off the cheese as it just completely sticks to the foil, therefore it is completely wasted.

This was amazing! After I wrapped the corn with foil, I placed them in the oven for about 30 minutes on 350. The cheese stuck to the tin foil quite a bit, but left a wonderful flavor on the corn. (Next time, I'll make sure to use non-stick foil.) The corn was perfectly crisp yet still tender and very juicy. Absolutely no need for butter. I've never had corn on the cob that was better. Amazing recipe!

This was a twist on the typical grilled corn on the cob.  I did like the flavors & the corn was moist not dried out.  I used paprika cause I was out of chili powder and sprayed the foil with non-stick spray so the cheese did not stick. I personally like the fresh taste of corn but will keep this for when we need something fancy.

I was very disappointed in this recipe.  All the cheese and seasonings stuck to the aluminum foil!  I even followed other reviewers advice and sprayed the foil with non stick cooking spray.  When I opened the corn from the grill, I had plain old grilled corn on the cob with a bunch of cheese and seasonings stuck to the foil.  Will not be doing this again.

We enjoyed this corn.  My hubby loathes mayo, and he apparently couldn't taste it because he ate the whole thing! I don't think it is 'the best', but it was good.

Delicious!! Before adding the mayo...i mixed sum cajun seasoning and cayenne pepper with the mayo THEN spreading the mayo mix over the corn! Gave it more of a kick! No need to add salt if you put the Cajun seasoning.  Very good!

I spray butter on the aluminum foil so the cheese will stick on the cobb and put it in my oven. This is my family's favorite.

Great change of pace!  I decreased chili powder to 1/2TBS per my family taste and it was wonderful!   No mayo taste at all!  The the spices/cheese mix sticks wonderfully to the mayo!!!!

Very good.  Would be even better if I could get the topping to stick to the corn instead of the foil.

What a great way to perk up some tired, boring corn! I combined the mayonnaise with the parmesan cheese and other ingredients. Then smeared it all over my ears of corn, wrapped them loosely in foil and baked in the oven at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes (I was also baking a meatloaf at the same time). This is a keeper. Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great start but I doubled it for more corn, nixed the mayo and combined the dry ingredients with melted butter and brushed it on the corn.   I didn't put the corn on aluminum foil, just straight on the grill. It turned out great!!

Love it! This is how we've always eaten street fair corn. I grew up in the south, so the Mexican influence is alive and well. I, too, was used to putting the toppings on after it was roasted, but I loved the flavor of the chili powder more so this way. I slathered the corn in the mayo and ancho chili powder, wrapped it up, roasted it and then rolled it around in the cheese right before serving. Muy Bien!

I actually roasted the corn with nothing on it, and then brushed the mayo and seasoned parm on afterwards. Made it easy for people to customize the corn how they wanted. Yum

We've tried this recipe twice..  We had better luck mixing the mayo with the chili powder, salt and pepper and then applying to the corn...sprinkle the parmesan on the front part of our foil and roll the corn in it...much less mess!

This came out really well and was VERY easy!  We are not huge fans of mayo, but you couldn't taste it once it was grilled.  We used fat-free mayo and had only minor problems with the ingredients sticking to the corn, next time will try non-stick foil!

I have used this recipe for two years now in the height of corn season and every time I use it, people love it.  Make sure the foil is greased and not over direct flame.  Also, I have tried adding cheese half way through and get a better result.

This recipe was wonderful.  Now that I read more of the reviews I will use non stick foil next time since most of the cheese stuck to it.  But other than that....fantastic.  I didn't have chili powder so I used seasoning salt.  Came out great!

This recipe was okay but not spectacular by any means.  The chili powder was a little overwhelming and next time I will brush foil with some olive oil before wrapping the corn.  The parmesan cheese just stuck to the foil when I unwrapped the corn.

This was really good. A friend of mine made this about six years ago on a camping trip. The only diference was that she put every thing on after the corn was cooked, and instead of chili powder she used adobo seasoning. Almost like a salad on a stick!

This didn't turn out the way we expected.  The parmesan stuck to the foil more than the corn.  Overall, taste was good, but not great.

Husband loved them, but I found they had a weird flavor- maybe from the mayonnaise and parm together. I like the cheese idea, but I used a lot to really punch it up, but it mostly all stuck to the foil. Meh.

Very tasty. I cooked in the oven for 20 minutes at 400 degrees because it was too windy to grill. They came out great. I was very liberal with the chili seasoning and had a great zing to it. Also, as others have mentioned add the Parmesan after you grill/bake the corn to prevent sticking.

We were having a dinner party (8 people).  I read other reviews & this is what I did.  I cut the uncooked corn off the cob and put into a 9X12 baking dish (14 ears).  Spread mayo on the corn & sprinkled with fresh grated Parmesan cheese.  Baked as directed.  Hubby made BBQ ribs.  Everything was completely devoured!  YEA Paula!

Although the corn was delicious (you can't go wrong with white corn on the cob), and I believe the mayo added a good richness, the cheese does not stay on the corn and winds up completely lost and melted in the foil.  Maybe baking these would be better?  Regardless, the flavor is good so maybe a little experimenting is in order?

I didn't care for this because I could taste the mayonnaise and that just made it strange for me.  I think it would be a lot better with butter or even oil but the mayo taste was odd.

I mixed the mayo with dry ranch dressing mix and some ground chipotle chile (dry, not canned), spread on the corn, wrapped and grilled.  Then rolled in the parmesan. Some of the mayo stuck to the foil, but we scraped it off and spread back on the corn.  Excellent!!

This recipe is great, but it works best if you lather everything on AFTER the corn is done on the grill..that way nothing sticks to the foil.  Also, put some chopped fresh cilantro on it and squeeze lemon juice!  Made this way, it is AMAZING!

Not a big fan of this recipe. I don't know if it was the parm cheese or the chili powder that my husband and I didn't care for. Glad I tried it, because now I know. From now on we'll just stick with plain ol' butter.

I am giving this recipe 5 stars because I liked it for a change from the same old, but hubby did not care for it at all.  Easy and simple enough recipe to make just one this way for myself and give him one the way he likes it.

One of my favorite ways to eat corn.  My 2-year-old adores it!  Sometimes, I omit the chili powder and use powdered ranch dressing instead.  So good!  Try this on the outdoor grill for absolute best flavor.

This is the best! It is actually a mexican dish and so addicting. I would suggest buying lots of corn on the cob cause you will go back for seconds, maybe thirds.

Very good. Easy to prepare and little clean up since they are wrapped in tin foil. I'll keep this recipe since they can be served with anything.

I LOVE this corn.  I’d add the Parmesan before adding the chili powder, otherwise not enough of the Parmesan sticks to the corn.  Really delicious.

Followed the recipe exactly & it was a big hit! Loved the flavor & how easy it was to throw these on the grill with some BBQ chicken. I had them ready in the time it took the grill to heat up (charcoal) & didn't have any trouble with the parmesan sticking & we didn't have any oil as some others have commented. I served them with my BBQ chicken & a blue cheese potato salad (recipe on this site). Dinner was a perfect summer time meal. I'd highly recommend this recipe.

Had something very similar to this in Hawaii and fell in love with the test.  This is an excellent copy.  Made this as directed.  Used non stick foil.  Next time I will sprinkle seasonings on after it cooks.  10 min on grill was perfect.

We loved this.  Even teen son and baby girl ate it all.  I'm giving 4 stars for the sticking factor.  I grilled it and let it sit 10 minutes, but that didn't help the sticking factor. I'm hoping non stick foil will work for me next time.  I'll update. I slathered on the mayo, but it didn't leave a taste on the corn.

The only way my family eats corn on the cob now. The only change I made was to use paprika instead of chili powder. I don't like spicy stuff. I also sprayed my foil as it tends to stick. OMG at the flavor!!! Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This corn was awesome! There were only 2 of us, so I made 2 corn cobs and I adjusted the amount of ingredients accordingly. We eat low carb and this was our splurge for the week. I cut the cobs in half, so I actually only had 1/2 a cob to go along with my grilled steak and lobster tail. It took ALL of my strength not to go back and eat the other half! My fiance loved it also and we will definitely keep it on the 'carb splurge' rotation! I took the suggestion of another reviewer and after I took the corn off the grill, I let it sit in the foil for about 10 minutes or so. When I unwrapped it, none of the parm stuck to the foil. :) No need to buy  the non stick foil for just this recipe.

Try grilling without the foil. The corn will not burn as one would maybe think as long as you're rolling the corn around the grill surface.
Great taste!

I made this for Easter. Delicious. I didn't use the Parmesan cheese. One ear also didn't have the cayenne since I didn't want them all spicy. Still super yummy.

Adjusted recipe for 3 ears.  I mixed all the ingredients together except for the parm cheese and put on corn.  Then I loosely closed up in foil that I put evoo on, no sticking here.  I baked at 350 for 30 mins and then opened up and added the parm cheese and then put back in for 10 mins. I was baking chicken at the same time so the time didn't bother me.  It was tasty and nice for a chance to try something different but nothing real special with that WOW. True, you don't taste the mayo.

It really did not have the flavor I was hoping for. The cheese was falling off the corn and it really was not as good as I had hoped I will not be making this again.
