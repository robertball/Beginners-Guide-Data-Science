I live in south Louisiana and have been making gumbo for 40 years.  Thsi is absolutely the best gumbo recipe I have made and actually the only time that I have used a recipe for years.  My husband loved it and he is a true cajun.  Don't leave anything out.  Since I don't like to stand a long time with the roux, I have started using Savoie's Real Cajun Roux, it is a dry browned flour and comes in a pint jar.  You cannot tell the difference from the roux that you make yourself.  I wish I would have had it years ago.  Anyone that wants a real southern cajun gumbo, just has to make this one.

I have been looking for a cajun shrimp gumbo like my great grandmother used to make, and this really, really comes close.  The secret is the canned tomatoes and peppers.  She always used it in all her cooking.

My husband LOVED it, as he loves anything spicy and Cajun. Personally, even though I'm not a finicky eater, didn't care much for it. Too many textures. But it's a good recipe and I"ll make it again if only for him! LOL!

I have tried about 5 different  gumbo recipes over the past couple of years, played with them and tried to tweak them to get the taste I wanted. Didn't have to do a thing to this one...it is PERFECT and tastes just like the gumbo I had while visiting LA.  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

This dish is absolutely delicious, I made it w/o the okra b/c I had none but those were majority of my alterations.  Puts me back on Bourbon street and warms me to my toes, this recipe is going straight into my cookbook :)

I made gumbo for the first time using this recipe. From the raves I received from all those that ate it, I can honestly say it was a big success. Wonderful recipe. Thank you.

This was fabulous! I made it last night exactly by the recipe, and it turned out great!  We served it over rice with crusty french bread, and it made a hearty meal.  Anyone planning to make it needs, to set aside several hours, but it's WELL worth it. My only advice is to wear comfortable shoes because you'll be stirring the roux for a looooong time.  Stir it until you think nothing's going to happen, then stir it a while longer, and it will be ready. Enjoy!

The gumbo was wonderful, I left out the sausage and used crabmeat in addition to the shrimp. Lots of ingredients but a smaller yield than I would have liked. I will say that this really does take a long time, but it was very good.

Excellent recipe - but you can take it up another notch by using homemade stock made from crab, shrimp or crawfish shells instead of the water.  Lobster shells would work too.  I save all the shells and heads and cook them for about an hour with the trinity and some peppercorns and then strain.   I keep the shells in my freezer until I have a bunch.  Then I store the stock in 1-2 cup portions.

Well rounded flavors. I love the texture varieties and colors. Having 3 types of meat gives me a biased opinion thought! I will hopefully be making this again and again.

I have been looking for a good gumbo recipe. This is it.
I am not into high levels of heat, preferring to savor the flavors and textures that comprise a good gumbo, so there were no chile peppers in mine and rather less  of the other forms of chemical heat. I substituted cilantro for the parsley just because (I generally have cilantro in the fridge and any parsley not used in the recipe would have been tossed) and used a large can of sliced stewed tomatoes that I had purchased by accident. I had to laugh at myself when I realized that one of my saucepans contained "stewed tomatoes and okra", a dish I despise! Not sure whether my roux ever achieved the proper chocolate color, but the end result was fantastic!

I've never made gumbo before but had it at a friends house and I had to make it myself. This recipe is the best! Very time consuming but well worth it.

The  first time I made this I didn’t have okra, so I substituted asparagus. Both times, I used up leftover ham (chopped up) in lieu of andouille , because I wanted to get rid of it. It was delicious each time. It’s a very forgiving recipe as long as you cook the holy trinity and don’t “ ROUXin” the roux. Next time I hope to have all the proper ingredients!

OK this is the first time that I ever made this recipe. I was extremely worried about it being too spicy for the  people in Oregon folks not Louisiana… So I used Johnsonville andouille… Because I knew it would not be too hot and then I did not add the cayenne pepper. I did not add the can of peppers… But I did use poblano peppers which provided some heat and allowed the holy Trinity to take affect.    I added the Cayenne After everything had cooked and melted together to bring up to the heat that I felt my group could handle. I read so many recipes of people trying to make the recipe un-hot  that I felt this was the safest way to progress. It was a hit and everybody was happy and every bit of it went !!
This was an awesome awesome recipe and I have become a fan of the browned butter and flour as a base and other dishes yummy!
I am sure that people from the south are going to skewer me for this recipe modification or two… But it’s no good if they don’t eat it… No matter how good it is

I didn't have any bacon so I used butter. I also substituted Creole seasoning instead of all the individual seasonings. I added cubed chicken breast also.

I doubled the recipe and forgot to buy  the green onions, so I subbed in more white onions. I omitted the cayenne since some in my house don't appreciate the heat. I added 4tsp of salt and 2 tsp of black pepper. That seemed pretty good, with the knowledge people could always add more spices.  It really turned out well. Here's where I ran into difficulty, after the veggies were sauteed in the butter they didn't want to separate from it. I had to place them into a strainer and catch the butter run off into a different bowl. As it happens, there was not enough re-claimed butter for the roux to work, and so I had to add another 1/2 cup in order to get it going properly. 

This was a time consuming dish but I had alot of fun making it. Next time I will tweak some things and if I manage to improve the flavors I will post an update.

While this recipe is simple it takes time to execute properly to get all the richness it promises.  I have tried shortcuts but it never comes out as delicious as this one did.  I tend to bump up the spicyness of my dishes so I upped the cayenne dose, added some red hot and always like to add Worcestershire Sauce to my stews for special bite.  Have tried hot italian, chorizo and smoked sausage and favor the smoked sausage version.  Will certainly be making this one again!

First time making gumbo. Adjusted a bit based upon friends from New Orleans and our own taste. Used pepper bacon and andouille sausage, added 1 chicken breast as I used it to make broth instead of using water. Added japaleno peppers, creole seasoning, and doubled cayenne.   Added gulf shrimp at end after simmering entire mixture on low in instant pot. Really good. Thank you for sharing.

Fantastic flavor. I followed the recipe,  but the roux didnt turn color, and I had to add more liquid in order to use all of the flour. (I added the remainder of the bacon grease,  which I think was a good decision) it was not as thick as I thought it should be, but still very, very good. my family loved it.  I will make again, when I have half  of a day to spend cooking. (:

I followed this to the letter with the exception of the okra. I used frozen, I added 2 cups to my bacon drippings and let warm in the oven. This meal has the perfect amount of spice and deep flavors. I got this recipe to make for an elderly friend of mine from New Orleans who has cancer. He still has a wonderful appetite and has been craving gumbo like his momma used to make. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

I made this on Friday.  I messed up a bit in that I made the roux and forgot to put the veggies in until after.  I therefore left them in when I put it all together. As I don't like things hot (spicy) I added just a pinch of Cayenne and a pinch of Cajun seasoning. I also used a few tablespoons of green chili.  All in All, it was terrific and one of the best meals I have had in quite awhile.  Note, I don't cook much as I am usually just cooking for me.  In the end I divided the finished recipe into five Rubbermaid "take alongs".  I gave two away to a friend and will eat the last one for lunch today.  I am really looking forward to lunch.

In spite of the fact that I usually don't use a recipe for Gumbo, and generally make the roux first, I decided to make this according to the recipe.  Glad I did. Came out just right and was the real deal.  Thanks for an excellent recipe!

There were no  instructions as to what is done with sautéed vegetables, but I assumed they were to be added back to the pot with the sausage, bacon, and okra-tomato mixture? This was my first time making shrimp gumbo and my husband and I loved it. I halved the recipe this time but will use the recipe, as is,  next time,  in order to freeze leftovers.

It was very good.  I omitted the okra and tomatoes due to everyone does not like okra.  Next time I think I will do the okra and tomatoes on the side so those that like it can add it to their dish.

Careful about the spice level.  I added extra Rotelle, and overspiced it.  But adding fresh chopped tomatoes tempered the heat, and it was amazing!

This is super delicious. I do not like bland recipes and often tweak/add spices but not in this recipe! It's perfect!!! I replace the shrimp with chicken sometimes just bc I have a friend w shellfish allergy and also in Indiana finding good shrimp is challenging.

On a whim, I bought some andouille chicken sausage and had it in the freezer.  Since I never cook with it, I didn't really know what I would do with it.  This recipe was perfect for it!  My husband and I both really enjoyed this gumbo and it tasted even better the next day (I saved some uncooked shrimp to warm up for leftovers the next day).  Although the roux is time consuming, it's a step that is worth it.  The sausage added its own heat to the gumbo so I skipped the cayenne pepper and added more garlic because we love it, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.

20 mins. into stirring the roux, I was questioning if it was worth the effort....the answer is yes (it took 45 mins and only got a dark caramel color).  The broth was outstanding.  I skipped the okra and used smoked turkey sausage.  I did not like it over rice b/c I felt the broth (best part) got lost.  Just serve in a bowl with good bread on the side for soaking.  Even my very picky family liked it and they'er like Mikey.

Wow!  This was nothing short of amazing!  I did have to tweak it slightly because I am allergic to beef/pork.  I used smoked turkey and chopped it up in place of the bacon and I used Butterball Everyday turkey link sausage.  This was my first real gumbo and I WILL be making this many times more!

I have made gumbo twice, both with a roux (browned flour) and I just don't like the taste of roux. This recipe calls for 2/3 cups of flour and 1/2 cup butter, and although the I achieved the great appearance of the gumbo dish, the base tasted like the browned flour. I would try this again, maybe in another month since this is an expensive and labor intensive dish.

Wow this is really good!  I'm not much of a cook, but I followed the directions accordingly and it's delicious. I forgot to buy a green pepper, but I had fresh mushrooms, so I threw them in.  Also added another can of spicey (Rotelle) tomatoes.

Nothing special with this one.  Had to add tons of salt and other seasoning to bring it up to speed.  Will not make this again.
