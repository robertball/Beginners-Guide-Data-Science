I looked and looked for a simple cobbler and this is it! I am not a baker but this redeemed me completely. I added more cinnamon and a bit of sugar on top used only 1 cup of milk but that was it, otherwise don't need to change a thing about it. I used fresh peaches (that I hand picked at the Peach Fest in Az) that were ripe and it came out perfect. THANK YOU SOOOO MUCH!

Sorry but this is not a receipe I would recommend. I feel that I waisted 8 fresh peaches.  The peaches were good but the cobbler needs to be modified. I think I'll just go back to my tried and true Better Homes And Garden book..  Always dependable.

Something must be wrong with the ingredient list.    I made this cobbler exactly by the recipe and it came out awful --rubbery and tasteless.

Not sure what happened but it did not turn out very good.  I threw it in the trash and made the old fashion Bisquick cobbler

The flavor was good, but the cake part turned out very leathery, gummy and hard.

Tasted good... I didn't think it was too sweet.  But the "cake" part did not cook through at all!  It was like tasty soggy cardboard under the peaches.  Followed the directions.  Don't know what went wrong.

Think I'll try to cut the sugar down a half or third of a cup.  Otherwise, had a great flavor.  Better than my "old" cobbler recipe.

I plan to try it again, with a little less sugar.  I'll post again, either way.

HTH !!!

I wasn't too sure about this as it has no leavening agents but I pressed on with assurance of other that it would be fine.  Hubby liked it a lot better than I did - but this is really very sweet.  I made it with frozen peaches but I bet you could make this with canned peaches and skip the cooking of the peaches step.   Great for an easy dessert when you are out of eggs.
