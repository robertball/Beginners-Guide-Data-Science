We definitely enjoyed these.  There was approximately 4 times more filling than needed for the mushrooms, so I would suggest quadrupling the mushrooms and making these for a crowd.  The flavor of the salad dressing didn't really come through, in the future I think I'd add Italian seasoning to the filling.  Very tasty!
