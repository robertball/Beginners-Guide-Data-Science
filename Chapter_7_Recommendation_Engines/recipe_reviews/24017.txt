While delicious, these aren't really croissants.  They're missing those lovely layers that make croissants what they are!  It hasn't stopped the children and I from eating an embarrassing amount of them, and I know they'll be popular with guests... it's just that I was looking for a shortcut to the authentic thing.  I'll keep looking, but then again maybe there isn't one!

I suggest using this dough as a base for cheese danish. I use 8oz.cream cheese, 1/4 c.sugar, 4 Tb.cornstarch & 1 egg for the cheese filling. Just combine the ingredients, roll out the dough, fill the center. cut one inch strips on each side then fold. Let it rise for 2 to 2-1/2 hours before baking. For added flavour you may top the cheese filling with any kind of fruit jam.

I really enjoyed making these croissants. I did not refrigerate them for four hours as I did not have so much time. I stuck them in the deep-freezer for 30 mins and they taste and look perfect. A sure recipe I will share with my friends

I've used this recipe for years, especially for holiday meals. My family loves them.  I would never attempt to make croissants the real way, with all the folding of the pastry, but this recipe gives good results with much less work.  If you want authentic croissants, then I think you have to make them the 'authentic' way, so don't make these and complain that they aren't authentic.

This recipe is excellent! So light and fluffy. Not as fluffy as the tradition croissant... but I haven't been able to master that yet. It really does have the taste and feel of a croissant though, so that satisfies me! I only baked 8 croissants and am freezing the rest so I can have them freshly baked when I feel like it. Just freeze them in their croissant shape and then on the day you want to bake them take them out a couple of hours ahead of time to thaw and rise. Also, beat 1 Tbsp of water with the egg before brushing it on... it makes a better glaze.

I'm sure the author had good intentions, but this recipe was not great.  The instructions were vague and therefore my croissants turned out to be more like hotdog buns than nice flaky pastries.

Being a croissant junky, though a good dough, this is more like a canned crescent roll. This dough is wonderful and versatile though. I made strombolies with it and the butter and garlic over the top made it scrumptious. I made sweet rolls and just plain old bread with dinner rolls. Great dough, but if you were expecting the butter croissant you get at your local pastry shop or coffee cafe, this is not it.

I have never in my life made any kind of pastry so to start off with croissants was a challenge for me. These turned out to be INCREDIBLE. My family and myself were extremely impressed with these and I plan on making them again very soon. Someone said that the instructions were vague but it all worked out very well for me!

I rated this recipe a few months ago and just made it for the second time, and I needed to change it to a 5 from a 4, it is really easy and delicious. This time I made it the night before and let it sit in the fridge as the recipe stated and I divided one half of the dough into 8 triangles for sandwich sized rolls and served with chicken salad, which was perfectly delicious. The other half of the dough I did into 16 triangles and rolled up with chocolate chips inside for a dessert - yummmmmy!

To make the whole proccess “quick” put the dough in the deep freezer for 30 minutes, as others suggested. To make the dough workable add ½ cup of flour. Fill the triangles with 2-3 pieces of dark chocolate. Delicious!

These croissants are delicious. It has become a family tradition to serve them at holiday meals.  The fact that the dough is started the night before is really helpful during the last minute rush of meal preparations!

These are great.  Much easier than the traditional and, if done right, just as flaky. Best to use pastry knife to get the flour and the butter properly mixed.  Sifting the flour also helps the texture.  Family loves these.  I start them in the evening and roll them out in the morning.  House smells like a bakery when everyone gets up.  I’m the early riser.

Quick? Yes these are quick compared to a true croissant which is butter/fold/roll butter/fold/roll over and over adnausium.  I have been delighting guests with these for fourty years. There aren't many "quick" recipes that turn out as well as this one!

This is such a beautiful dough. It is so easy to work with and forgiving. I looked up croissant recipes because I tried to make traditional croissants, and it was a labor intensive process with little payoff, so I came across this recipe and tried it out. I’m so glad I did. I divided the dough into four batches. The first batch I spread lingonberry jam in the middle and made beautiful pastries. I also made Apple pie, chocolate pastry, cinnamon sugar pastry, turnovers the possibilities are endless with this easy to work with dough. I enclosed some pics for reference. Much cheaper than store bought puff pastry. Thanks so much for a great recipe.

This is the best and quickest way to make croissants.  I add 1 tablespoon water and a pinch of salt to the egg wash.  Also I freeze the little pieces of butter, then use my food processor to chop up into the flour to the size of peas.  No, these aren't authentic, but are as close as you can get.  If you want  "authentic," then plan on many hours to make them.  I have used this exact recipe for the last 30-40 years and no one has complained that they weren't authentic, just that they were delicious!  By the way, I never mention that these are made differently.

To make more like canned croissants, skip the rise and bake for only 10-12 minutes! Best and easiest croissant recipe out there!

True these criossants arn't made like traditional croissants(the butter is actually "laminated" or folded into the dough to create layers) but the ingrediants are basically the same therefore create the same buttery yummy taste. Great recipe.

This recipe is from a 1973 Sunset magazine cookbook. I have used it since that time and gotten nothing but rave reviews and I am continually asked to bring these to holiday dinners, etc. The variations are endless, but a favorite is to put some of your favorite chocolate on the dough before you roll it up...yum..!!!

I used milk instead of evaporated milk. After cooking them I told you if it was a mistake or not. And If you come to the Patagonia Argentina just let me know because we have an inn over there.

I didn't have a lot of time, so I skipped the lenghty period that the dough was supposed to spend in the fridge. They were fine without it, though not very flaky or croissant-like. I also put raspberry jam and fresh raspberries in it, and they were great. I wouldn't suggest skipping the chilling time, unless you are in a rush.
