Really liked this. Like Holiday Baker suggested I pushed my raspberries through a sieve (I have wild raspberries in my yard. Very flavorful but the seeds are so hard you could break a tooth). I opted for a little almond extract, used regular sugar and cornstarch (no tapioca). Turned my breakfast  yogurt into dessert.  Will definitely make this again.

This recipe was hard to rate. On taste I give it a 5, cherries, raspberries, and cinnamon. I knew I couldn't go wrong with the flavor combination. The issue comes in with the raspberry seeds. I have made raspberry mouse where I heat the raspberries and strain the seeds. I have made raspberry and banana smoothies, where I blend the raspberries and liquid alone until liquified and then add the other fruits. It dissolves the seeds first. That concerned me with the raspberries here. I cooked it down and the raspberry seeds were just abundant in the mixture and left a thick crunchiness to the compote. I ended up adding the mixture to my Vitamix blender, blending on medium for 2-3 minutes, and then further straining to reduce the seeds. It kind of defeats the purpose of having pieces of cherries. The flavor is amazing though. I would consider making this again blending the raspberries alone first in a little liquid, straining, and then using. Tweaks I made were halving the recipe, using agave syrup, and cabernet sauvignon. I also only had frozen fruit, cherries I pitted and froze and store bought frozen raspberries. I cooked them from frozen uncovered for 5 minutes on medium high, or 7 on my stove, and 5 minutes on medium. Half the recipe, after straining out the seeds, yielded about 1/2-2/3 a cup. I am going to try this tomorrow on a toasted English muffin or yogurt. ty
