This receipe tasted great but I made some changes to it - which I highly was very pleased with.

a) I used Golden Mushroom soup instead of regular - it just made the sauce look so rich

b) I used Honey Brown Lager beer - it gave a nice sweet twist of a taste to it and only used HALF the bottle.

c) I quartered red potatos and baked in the oven at 425' for 30 minutes (45 minutes before pot roast was finished) in a metal pan, not glass - with salt, pepper, olive oil, paprika and oregano (topped with foil) and then dumped it into the pot roast for the last 15 minutes.

The sauce of the pot roast was something you could put over any meat or chicken and made the carrots and celery melt in your mouth.

I loved this recipe.  I used a dutch oven and baked it instead at 300F for about 3 hours and when it was done the meat just fell apart and was so tender.

Excellent flavor. I also made it in the crock pot after searing the meat and cooking the veggies in oil. The gravy was wonderful on mashed potatoes!

Very good results!  I love using beer in pot roast as you get such a tender meat and nice flavor.  The mushroom soup adds a nice creamy taste to the broth!

So easy. So tasty. I used my crockpot. Seared the meat first and sauteed the vegetables. Used  Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic soup. I used a tri-tip roast and it was so moist and tender that my 17 year old who is NOT a red meat fan, loved it. Next time will cook some wide egg noodles and serve it like a stroganoff.

Yum! This was really good and really easy. Don't be intimated by the cooktime. All you need to do is toss stuff in a dutch oven and let everything simmer for a while.

I love cooking with either beer or wine which is why this recipe caught my eye. I did omit the cloves as I'm not a huge fan. I also added some beef broth, more seasonings and a bit of Gravy Master. Once the meat was done, I thickened with flour and some of the fat that had accumulated. This also works really nicely in the slow cooker once you've browned the meat. Just make sure you deglaze the pan with the liquid before transferring it to the crock pot. Very good Christy and thank you!

A couple weeks ago I made a roast from a recipe on this site and proclaimed it to be the best roast I'd ever had. Well, this is taking it's spot. The meat was beyond tender and so juicy. I did put all the ingredients, plus a bag of baby carrots, into the slow cooker instead. Cooked it on high for 6 hours, low for one. Thickened the gravy with instant potato flakes. So, so, SO good!

This was really good, and different from the standard cream of mushroom, onion packet and beef broth pot roasts out there; but I did feel it was missing something.  Wasn't able to put my finger on it exactly.  I did use my crock pot and threw in the bay leaf sans the cloves (not a huge fan of cloves) along with maybe a tablespoon of beef boullion granuels.  Let it cook all day and threw some baby carrots and potatoes in about half way.  Everything was tender and delicious and once the drippings were thickened, they made a wonderful gravy.  I would like to try this one again, only I will experiment with the spices.  Thanks!!

I'm not a fan of pot roast myself, but I made this in the crock pot for my boyfriend. I always ask him how many stars he thinks I should put on A.R., lol! He says this one is definitely deserving of 5! I didn't have any celery, so I skipped it. I browned the roast in bacon drippings as per one suggestion I read. Then I tossed it in the slow cooker, covered it with the onions and garlic, and dumped in my beer (Yuengling Lager) and mushroom soup. I did this just as I was leaving for work, and 6 hours later he enjoyed an awesome homemade meal while I was away. Thank you ChristyJ!

I followed this recipe to the letter except used 2 cans of cream of mushroom (3.5 lbs. of meat) and I marinated the meat for 2 hours first (olive oil, granulated garlic and Kroger steak seasoning - similar to Dales).  This turned out excellent and it is a terrific way to use less expensive cuts of meat (particularly round steak).

Been using beer in my pot roasts for years, but never in combo with soup. Followed basic recipe closely. Used a chuck roast trimmed of fat seasoned with a little salt and freshly ground pepper. Used a flavorful pale ale and added a couple sliced carrots along with celery and onion. Cooked in cast iron dutch oven just over 3 hr in a 300Â° oven. Added portabello mushrooms along with sliced meat for last 30 minutes. Came out very tender and flavorful. Served with noodles and crusty homemade Australian "Damper Bread" it made a hearty dinner on a winter night.

Very very good.  I was in a hurry so I skipped the onion, celery, by leaves and cloves.  I just put it in the crock pot with the other basic stuff and it was awesome!  I added flour to the sauce after it cooked and it made wonderful gravy!  I'll make this again for sure

I loved making this dish. It's made with ingredients I usually have on hand. I thought my gravy was too thin when I took the roast out of the pan to cut so I added some corn starch. Then being lazy, I added carrots and potatoes for a one-dish Meal. I made it all on the stovetop. So easy.

I used a london broil and followed the recipe to the letter. Came out great! I cooked mine in the crock pot on high for about 6 hours, then low for about 2 more.The london broil literally fell apart when I was taking it out. Hubby loved it!

My husband absolutely loves this roast and for me it's okay. I like using lipton onion and golden mushroom flavor better and it's also much easier. I used a chuck roast and I also used golden mushroom instead.

Outstanding. I didn't add the cloves or bay leaf. I used polish beer and a jar of turkey gravy/three cans of sliced mushrooms because I didn't have mushroom soup. I also used salt pepper and garlic/pepper on the roast before i cooked it. I was worried about cooking a roast in the roasting pan on top of the stove because my pan is large and oval. I was afraid it would ruin the pan or heat unevenly but it was perfect. I let my three pound angus chuck roast simmer for 4 hours while I worked around the house. It smelled heavenly and was perfect when I served it. I threw baking potatoes and whole carrots in next to the roast. Very easy and tasty.

Great recipe. I only tweaked it slightly. I added another can of cream of mushroom for more gravy, used garlic powder (its what I had), 1 bay leaf and no cloves (didn't have any). I also used less veggie oil and used bacon instead. After searing the roast with the bacon, I cut up the bacon and left it in the final product. Made for great taste. Also added pepper and salt to the final gravy. I also made this in an oven. If you do, use a roasting pan you can cover (I bought a disposable one) and then put it in for 2 hours at 350 then another 20 mins after you slice up the meat. I also thickened the gravy a little with some flour and cornstarch.

This was great.  I used extra garlic and omitted the cloves, though if (when) I do this again, I'll use them.  We used a bottom round, and it was really tender and made super sandwiches through the week.

I followed this recipe pretty much to a "t", except I did not have any cheesecloth, so I put the bay leaves right in the sauce and used ground cloves.  It was delicious!  My hubby said it was definitely one I could make for him again.

Good but nothing spectacular.  I left out the celery and cloves and used a single bay leaf.  I seared the meat before putting it in the crock pot for the afternoon and the meat was very tender.  I served it with mashed potatoes and used the sauce as gravy.  It made very good gravy.

smelled absolutely divine while cooking. Made excellent gravy and I tossed it all in my slow cooker! Thanks for posting such an easy but tasty meal for when you're in a pinch.

I used a boneless beef blade roast. Rubbed it with salt, pepper, Louisiana hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce. I omitted the celery and whole cloves. Added celery seed to the onions and garlic to make up for the lack of celery flavour. Since I didn't have the cloves I simply added the bay leaves to the sauce. Used reduced-sodium cream of mushroom soup. Only simmered the roast in the sauce for one hour to avoid making the meat too tough. Thickened the sauce with a half cup of red wine and two teaspoons of cornstarch. Good taste, but I think if I had used cloves the sauce would have had more depth. With the addition of red wine, I simmered the sauce for about 10 minutes before adding back the sliced roast. Served this with a cabbage dish and some large-cut french fries. If I make this again it would most likely be in the slow cooker to achieve a more tender meat.

Easy! Tasty! Inexpensive! I don't know why this one got any negative reviews. I followed the recipe almost to the letter (I didn't have any bay leaf, and I used ground cloves instead of whole) and it turned out perfectly. At first I noticed a slight bitter aftertaste like a few people mentioned, but I attribute this to the cloves and/or beer. If the beer is responsible for the bitterness, could be the type of beer used. I used a lager (Moosehead). Also, the recipe didn't call for salt, but I added maybe half a teaspoon. This is a definite "make again"! Would go nice with rice.

I found this an easy and tasty roast recipe.  I made in the crockpot and my roast was flavorful and tender.  I would recommend adding mushrooms and potatoes to the roast, but really made no other changes.  I used a light beer and Healthy Request Cream of Mushroom soup.  Other than needing a little salt I did not find the gravy lacking at all.  I served with mashed potatoes, biscuits and salad for an easy weeknight meal.

I made this, and my boyfriend loved it. I'm not sure if I was as impressed - either the cut of meat I used wasn't the best (possible) or the sauce was a little too "Bay leaf-y." In any rate, I'll try this one more time, just to see how it cooks with a different type of meat, but I may make some adjustments (not as much bay leaf, taking it out all together, etc)

We enjoyed this. I found the gravy a little watery but still good. I added some sliced carrots and whole tiny potatoes, and cooked the roast for an extra 30 mins.

I substituted venison for the beef, omitted the bay leaf and cloves and increased the garlic and vegetables.  It was so tender and flavorful!  And the usual "gamey" taste was eliminated!  Absolutely fantastic!

This recipe was OUTSTANDING!!!!!!
I highly recommend it to everyone!!!!
When I first put the beer and soup into
my pot, it didn't look so great. I thought
"Oh my, I just wasted a good piece of 
meat!"  BUT when it was done cooking...
It became a family favorite!!!  I passed
it on to all my friends!  So great!!!

Probably more like 3.5 stars. It's not bad, but despite the fact that I added more garlic, plenty of salt and pepper, and oven roasted potatoes with paprika and oregano it was still very bland. Kick it up a notch with your favorite spices and this will be a 4-5 star recipe.

We really loved this recipe but it was a little tough when cooked in the pan the way the recipe suggests. Next time we are going to do it in the crock pot.

Delicious recipe! I made mine in the crock pot after searing the meat and sauteeing the vegetables. The meat was so tender and falling apart. Next time I might add something to thicken the gravy, because it was pretty thin, but still very tasty!

I thought that this roast sounded delicious and that it was supported by the reviews, but I have got to say that it was not that wonderful. The juices were pretty bland - I had to add my own seasonings to make this taste decent. I think the only good part of this recipe were the vegetables.

Wow this was really good. I baked my 3 pounder in the oven for 4.5 hours at 325. I had to thicken the sauce with a little cornstarch to make a gravy. Best gravy ever!

I did not follow this recipe exactly but the dish was very tasty. Here's what I did:
Did sear the roast in oil
Did not include chopped onion, celery or garlic
Cooked in a slow cooker
Added potatoes, a little nutmeg, clove powder, onion powder, lots of season salt, bay leaves.
The main advantage of my changes is that it saved preparation time. I would not have thought to mix beer and mushroom soup. My husband loved this and asked for THIRDS, my 3 year old ate it and she is very picky about eating meat. I am not known for my cooking, my husband is the cook in our house, so this was a big win.

what a simple, delicious recipe.  i added a bag of frozen roasted potatoes about an hour before serving.  my boyfriend confused my request to slice up the roast and diced it into bite sized pieces... but it turned out to be a great beef stew.  my mother was visiting and requested the recipe.  thanks!  this one's a keeper!

This was excellent!  So simple and so tasty.  I sprinkled a liberal amount of garlic powder on the meat before browning and substituted the celery (didn't have any on hand) with half a green pepper.  The sauce was wonderful and there was lots of it - this goes great with egg noodles.

I wasn't thrilled with this recipe at all.  I make a fabulous pot roast and thought this would be a really nice change... beer and red meat, what could go wrong?!  It came out ok and tasted better the second night but I don't think I'll be making this one again.

I don't know why, but I didn't get the outstanding flavor that almost everyone else raved about. I was really disappointed. I followed the recipe to a "T" but actually the meat was rather bland. Perhaps the choice of beer really makes a difference? I used Sam Adams. Maybe I will try again with Bass, which other reviewers seem to have gotten good results with.

I wasn't going to try this recipe, even though it has rave reviews, because the idea of beer in pot roast didn't seem right. Boy, was I wrong. rummaging the cupboards, I found a bottle of Irish Stout beer, and decided to use it for this pot roast. I added some veggies and cooked it in a slow cooker, but otherwise stuck to Christines' recipe.

Props to ya, Christine. Delicious. I was puzzled about the clove thing.... until I tasted it. Who'da thought??????

The only ingredient I omitted was the celery stalks, because my husband doesn't like them.  Inspite of this, though, Christine's recipe still turned out to be fabulously yummy!  I don't know if it matters what brand of beer is used, but FYI, I used Bass Ale.  I highly recommend this recipe not only because the results turn out to be fantastic, but also because for a novice cook like me, it was quite easy to make!  :)

I had to make some revisions for this one~no Cream of Mushroom or celery.  Used Cream of Celery & added beef base.  The results were fantastic!!! Served with wide noodles & carrots.  Only a little leftover, & that to me was even better the next day!!!  Maybe next time I'll use a dark ale?!

I cooked just over 1lb in the dutch oven on the stove. I used golden cream of mushroom and ground clove for the recipe. We thought it was great! Lots of gravy and the meat was perfect texture. I will be using leftover with egg noodles.

I didn't use the celery or cloves but added sliced baby bella mushrooms at the end.  I also used an amber German beer and the flavor of the gravy was incredible! My new pot roast recipe.

It was pretty good. Recipe calls for round steak, which I used, but I would think a round or chuck roast would be better for this, allowing it to cook longer. Otherwise I made it per the recipe and it turned out well. Perfect for a Sunday all in one pot meal.

I made this dish last Sunday and the house smelled amazing while it was cooking in the crockpot.  It had great flavor and was very tender.  Will be making this again.

This needed something more. My advise would be to use a darker sweeter beer. Maybe mine would've turned out better if I had. I followed it exactly (a bit more garlic as I Love garlic) but otherwise it just wasn't the best tasting. My husband agreed..

Good, but nothing special. In this braised beef dish, I used a sirloin tip roast. Because it was so lean, the meat was a little dry and chewy. A chuck or other more heavily marbled cut would probably have been better (with degreasing at the end).

Still, this was just OK. For much better beef/beer braises, check out the carbonades on foodnetwork.com and in Julia Child's "Mastering" book, vol. 1. Both use more onion, a little brown sugar, and a very interesting but subtle vinegar finish.

Very good when you want beefy, creamy comfort food. I followed the initial steps and then put it all in the crockpot for about 8 hours. I was a bit worried at first because the dark beer I added (Smithwick's) did give the sauce a slightly bitter taste, but after cooking all day it all mellowed nicely.

Only modification I did was using a dash of ground cloves (my husband isn't a big fan) and adding mushroom from a can. I used Guinness and the roast tasted way too strong. I'll have to try this again with a lighter beer.

This was really easy and delicious.  I didn't have any celery, but I did have a fennel bulb. Figured they're both in the same family, I think, so I cut it up and used it instead.  It was really good. The gravy was delicious. Everyone loved it. Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing!

First, I never cook meat so I was a bit fearful about ruining a $15 roast. (My mom is living with me while undergoing cancer treatment and I'm pulling out all the stops to get her to eat. She gave it 5 stars!)

I followed the recipe with the following changes: I added and an extra clove of garlic and stalk of celery.  I also added a handful of rehydrated porcini mushrooms and soaking liquid, some Worchestershire sauce, and a few shakes of Maggi seasoning which I think is MSG.

After simmering for 40 minutes, I realed the stovetop method was too slow, so I cut the meat in half and put part of it in the pressure cooker and left the other section in the pan.  

The pan gravy was delicious.  I used Magic Hat #9 as the beer and small bay leaves and there was no bitter aftertaste or anthing.  The gravy in the pressure cooker was thinner, but the meat was very, very tender. 

I ended up comingling the lefovers from both pots and dicing the meat and made a bit of stew that I will add pearl onions, mmushrooms and some sour cream to and serve over egg noodles later in the week.

I think this is a good recipe for beginners and will use it as a base to play with.

This was yummy over mashed potatoes.  I used Guiness, but I'd love to try a different flavor with it as well. I took off the lid and simmered about 15 minutes extra to thicken up the gravy.  Definitely will make again!

This turned out tasty and moist, but the meat was over done. I used a 3.5 pound roast (larger than what the recipe calls for) and cooked it for 2 hours. Next time I'll reduce the cooking time by a half hour, but still use a larger than called for roast.

This was wonderful.  Cooked it in a large pan, on the stove top.  It cooked for 2.5 hours and the meat was so tender. We used Bass Ale, added freshmushrooms while it was cooking. Served it with a salad.. it was delicious.

This was a disaster for me...the meat gained hardly any flavor and was very bland. The sauce however wound up being overpowered by the cloves and bay leaves and had a bitter aftertaste. Bad Deal.

Meat was moist and had good flavor, but it was not out of the ordinary in flavor...sorry but it tasted like a typical roast found at any "good" eatery! It was easy to prepare and everyone ate it all, I will make it again for it's simplicity but it is not one of my favorites.

I used a chuck roast and cooked it using a pressure cooker.  It cut the cooking time to about an hour.  I cooked the roast for 30 minutes, then added potatoes and carrots, and cooked an additional 20 minutes.  It turned out great, lots of tasty gravy.

I made this recipe today and it will definitely be a keeper.  My mother who is an excellent cook also really enjoyed it.  I made a couple of changes by using chuck roast instead.  Also, I lightly seasoned my meat with seasoning salt and garlic pepper.  I couldn't imagine not seasoning meat. I read other reviewers comments and opted for golden mushroom soup for aesthetics reasons.  I used Bass beer like others had mentioned and I was very pleased with the wonderful flavor.  This is definitley a keeper.

Very good pot roast recipe! I've tried another one on this site (the highly rated one)and liked this better. Maybe because of the cut of meat. Came out much more tender than the other one. Followed the directions to the "T". Husband, brother and picky three year old daughter raved! Loved the beer in it! I think I'll put one less bay leaf next time. That (taste) came through pretty strong.

I feel that this recipe should have tasted better for the amount of time it had to cook.

I ended up cooking this a lot longer than the recipe called for, but the result was a roast that literally fell apart on the fork.  I also roasted some new potatoes and used the mushroom gravy as a side.  The reviews at the table were rave.

This was a great one!  Super easy and Super yummy.  It makes it's own gravy and makes the house smell great while it is roasting.  My husband thought I had slaved away all day with this one. (I let hime think that so he would do the dishes).  I will be making this one again for sure.

When I first pulled this off the site I thought I had everything I needed for it,it turned out I had the beer, cream of mushroom soup, the roast and the onions. I did some adjustments by coating roast in flour before browning and made gravy of the drippings but so far of the 2 times that I made it got "a sure fire keeper". Thanks.

I made this is the slow cooker.  The flavor is great, and you don't heat up the kitchen.  I sear the beef first, then follow the directions, put on low heat.  A few vegies, of course covered with that great gravy, and enjoy.

I don't know who comes up with such combinations, but I'm glad someone's creative!  I would have never guessed beer and cream of mushroom soup could produce such a great end result!

I made this pot roast for my family and it was a big hit.  My son-in-law said the best he ever had.
