These cookies are wonderful!  I made them for two different weddings and they were the first cookies to go!  They may take a little bit of time to make, but they are definitely worth it!

Not very good.  The caramel part was good, but the frosting was a disaster.  The sugar never dissolved and the frosting just tased like a blob of greasy fat with granulated sugar in it.  I tried to salvage mine by adding some powdered sugar.  Will not make this with the original frosting again.  Not sure what else I would pair with the caramel.  Very disappointed.

I think this is the recipe I've been looking for! It was a school dessert that I loved. I hope it's the one has anyone taken any photos so it can be confirmed, and does the toffee/caramel stay soft and gooie? Thanks
