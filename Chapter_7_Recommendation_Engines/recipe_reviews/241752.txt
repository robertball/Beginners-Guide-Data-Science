These are phenomenal. I made bars instead of cookies and made my own caramel instead of using store bought candies. Instead of dipping the bottom of each bar into chocolate I decided to pour the chocolate chips onto the shortbread crust as soon as it came out of the oven. I covered it with a sheet tray for a minute allowing the chips to melt. Then I spread the melted chocolate chips with an offset spatula and put the pan into the fridge to set the chocolate. When I was ready with the caramel/coconut mixture I spread that on the bottom crust of the shortbread after inverting the pan. The whole process was much easier than making cookies and the yummy outcome was the same.

Thankfully, I cut the recipe in half and still got 3 dozen cookies. I say thankfully because I was so tired of putting them together I just gave up and left over 1 dozen of them plain. These are a lot of work and have many steps. If I do ever attempt them again, I will try store bought dough and at least cut one step out. I do as much as I can from scratch because we have food allergies in my home. I rated them 4 stars because the flavor is very good. The one thing I would definitely suggest is to have extra melted caramel on hand and spread it on the cookie before you attempt to stick the topping. You need it to act as the glue or else the topping will just fall off. Super frustrating after all of that work. They are so filling you can only eat 2 anyway, so 24 was plenty for us.

The cookie base was delicious, but the caramel and coconut did not stick to the cookies at all. Wasted three hours making these for a work party and ended up going to store again...

Make your own or melt the caramels down with 1/3 c evaporated milk. The shortbread recipe is good. A lot of work. Fun to try though

Caramel hateful to work with. Directions didn't say to make cookies into donut shape. Only after making first batch, my son reminded me to make donut shape. (Didn't look at above pic). Will try homemade caramel tomorrow.....

A tip for those struggling with the sticky caramel: use one or two spoons to drop the caramel onto the cookies in clumps (I didn't make mine with a hole, which would definitely have complicated things!). Then use a separate spoon with the back coated in butter to press the caramel onto the cookie. Butter keeps caramel from sticking to spoon. Drizzling the chocolate ultimately ensures the caramel will stay on the shortbread. These are delicious!

Wow.

These are a marvelous cookie, perhaps a bit tricky to make, mostly dealing with putting the sticky coconut mixture on the circles.

But they are an absolute winner, everyone loved them, and has begged for more.

These turned out very well! I made 36 cookies from the recipe. I found that I only needed half the caramel and coconut though. Getting the caramel to stick on top of the cookie (instead of your hands) was the only tricky part.

I wasted so much time making these because the store-bought caramel ruined it. If you're going to make this recipe, make sure you make your own caramel instead. The concept and base are fine, but not worth the calories or effort.
