I have been looking for a bread pudding recipe that I thought had the same ingredients as my mother's.  When I saw this one and the other positive reviews it had gotten,  I decided to try it.  I was amazed at how much this tasted like my mother's bread pudding recipe.  There is no need to adjust this recipe.  The amount of each ingredient is as it should be.  I did adjust this recipe myself because of the ingredients I had on hand, not because of anything in the recipe.  Instead of using french bread, I used a bag of leftover potato rolls that my family never ate.  I also didn't have a 1/2 cup (1 stick) of butter because I forgot to buy butter.  I only had a half of a stick of regular (not unsalted) butter so that's what I used.  Everything else was the same.  Some people suggest that you let the bread soak in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before baking to ensure that the bread soaks up all the liquid.  I pushed down the bread into the mixture until it was mostly soaked up.  It only took about 5 minutes and the bread pudding still turned out great.  Just like home.  Thank you Sanatacruz for an excellent recipe.

I loved this!! I did omit raisins and pecans and I doubled the spices. I used heavy cream and soaked for an hour before baking. I also sprinkled brown sugar on top before baking and it was perfect! Served with a butter vanilla sauce and got rave reviews from a family gathering full of food snobs!!

This recipe is very good.  I've made it about 6 times now, and I've been playing with it a bit.  I must say that if you cover it, the raisins won't burn while it's cooking (learned the hard way).  I serve it with a bourbon sauce and it's been a hit every time I've made it (even when I had to pick off the raisins).  Thanks.

I am sitting here...still smelling this bread pudding aroma throughout my house.  I just made this, on a whim, because I had so much french bread leftover from Superbowl.  It is AWESOME.  If you like raisins, use them! I think it would be best to add them, half way through cooking.  I don't even usually rate..but this was an exception.

This is the best bread pudding recipe that I've ever tried!  I used whipping cream (since I had it on hand)instead of the half-and-half. This bread pudding is soooo very good!

Thanks for the terrific recipe! I have fixed it twice, and have had no leftovers. I happened to have raisin bread on hand and substituted it for both the bread and the raisins. The flavoring was wonderful and I had no trouble with the raisins burning. Thanks again.

My mom use to make bread pudding all the time and used whatever bread she had leftover so when I saw this recipe, and had a loaf of rustic raisin bread, I decided to try it.  
First of all I don't think the pan was big enough for a 1 pound loaf of bread, I would recommend a 9X13, then toasting the bread seemed like an unnecessary step, and only made the bread tough after baking.  I would also let the bread soak at least an hour before baking.  I will make this again, but with these few modifications.

This is probably the best bread pudding I've ever eaten, homemade or otherwise, and was the first I'd ever made. I received tons of compliments and many requests for a recipe. I even prepared it with old sandwich bread it turned out excellent.

I didn't like the taste or texture of this dish.  This is the second bread pudding I've ever made and I think because this wasn't soaked overnight it just seemed to be slices of layered flavored bread.  It never came together in a more uniform texture as my other recipe did.  My mom liked this, and liked the flavor, but I threw the rest away.

Very very good. I used a very chewy country Italian bread and it gave it a really nice texture.

Indeed, this is truly a jewel. Bread pudding has always been a favorite, but this one is tops in taste. Both my husband and I have had none better. Thank heavens for Grandmas and daughters who keep and share their recipes! Thanks so much.

Wow. Very rich, verrrry good. I would describe this dessert as a flavorful cross between rice pudding and baked french toast. By far the best I've tasted. I used a french baguette and a couple slices of apple raisin bread, along with heavy cream and milk. The raisins WERE good--I do recommend their addition. I had to soak the mixture a few hours, and press down the bread into the liquid, and tear a few pieces to help it out, but once everything was soaked it baked up perfectly in the 11x7 pan (crowded, but it fit). For a garnish, I melted a bit of vanilla ice cream to stand in for the custard sauce...ooh, I'm full... =)

Delish! Made without the raisens and sprinkled brown sugar over the top. Tip: Push the bread down in the liquid with your hands to soak well.

I gave 3 stars for the reason that it lacks instructions for ending up with a good bread pudding, however the flavour was nice.  I followed the instructions as it was given, and the result was dry and crispy top half, and slightly moist on bottom.  If these instruction were followed to the "t" by anyone who never had made bread pudding before, they would have some explaining to do to their guests.  The instruction need to include step for allowing the bread to sit in the wet mixture longer or be pressed down to really keep wet.  Also, they should have included steps  where you bake it with foil cover (cover it for at least some of the cooking time, so the thing doesn't dry out).  
For instruction I give 2 stars, but for the flavour I give 4 stars.

This was very good.  This is my first time making bread pudding.  I did add one thing.  After I took the bread pudding out of the oven I drizzled it with sweet condensed milk. This is definitely a keeper.  Thanks for posting this one.

This was good. Only thing I did different was used less pecans and more raisins because I like raisins more.  I think if I make this again I would follow a suggestion to soak the bread longer, maybe in a big bowl or something to be able to stir it and get it more evenly soaked.

best bread pudding recipe i've made.  the only thing to watch for - dont cook it for too long cos the outside will get dry and not very tasty.  i will probably double the spices next time.  didnt have a problem whatsoever with the raisins.  just pushed them down into the pudding so they werent on top.  covered with foil.  oh, and i did have to double the whole recipe (minus the bread, pecans, and butter) because i mustve had a big loaf of bread and it didnt get soaked through real well.   thanks!!

We REALLY enjoyed this! It was delicious. Even Jay liked it. I changed it a little, by sprinkling brown sugar liberally over the top. I used my smaller glass casserole dish and sprayed a piece of tinfoil with pam to put over the pudding. We used left over carmel sauce from the bananas in carmel sauce recipe on this site - it was delish! EVERYONE enjoyed it. I did not have half and half - so used the whipping cream I had on hand instead, added a little extra vanilla, no raisins cause Jay hates those and I let it soak up the custard for about an hour before baking. Perfection!  Carmel recipe was  1 C. sugar 1 C. butter  - whipping cream

Excellent...however...I used 1lb french bread & all other ingredients had to be doubled or it would have been dry. No one in my home eats rasins so I used crushed pineapple and pecans. However, it would have been great w/out it!

Smells wonderful!  Very easy! However the directions omitted the raisins.  I just placed the raisins in the mixture and poured them on with the mixture...hope this is right.  Can't wait to eat!!

LOVED this bread pudding! I omitted the raisins(don't like them) and added brown sugar/cinnamon mix on top before baking. Instead of the 1 1/4 cup milk I used half and half for the entire recipe. I topped it with a vanilla-butter-heavy-cream sauce I found with another recipe after baking and it was amazing! Will absolutely make this again!

My kids liked that this wasn't as custard like as other bread puddings and the pecans really add a lot.  We love it for breakfast.

As far as anything you're baking with raisins, push the raisins down with your finger and they won't burn.

I added raisins and it came out good. Will make again. I think when I make it again,  I will use raisin bread...

I made it without the pecans or raisins. It was delicious! I’ve been craving some for years, finally decided to look it up. I have one issue, maybe someone can explain. It rose in the oven , when I took it out to cool and went back in kitchen it had dropped. Did I do something wrong. It’s taste very good. Please help if possible. Thanks

I absolutely love this recipe, but the first time I made it, it was too dry for me. I made it again with half the bread and topped it with one half can of apple pie filling before baking it for 1 hour and 15 minutes. It came out beautifully.

This recipe was pretty good, but it needs a little help. There isn't enough batter to soak through the bread, so you need to include a sauce. I used the vanilla sauce from the "best bread pudding with vanilla sauce" recipe and it was on point. Leave the raisins out of this.

Family liked it, I thought it was too sweet. Used (very) stale baguette so didn't need toasting. Added some dried apples I wanted to use up (as well as the raisins), and skimped on the sugar. Still too sweet for me; but it is dessert, after all. Reminds me why the French insist that pain perdu is dessert, not breakfast. Will make again, but will probably cut down the sugar by at least a third.

Easy to make for bread pudding. I like that you could just use a loaf of French bread and didn't need to plan ahead by leaving bread out days prior.

Added dried cherries and raisins, and a good whiskey sauce, which I think is necessary for any honest bread pudding. Will definitely make this again.

I slightly increased  this recipe (used 4 eggs and two cups of cream) to use up about 6 slices of Udi's Gluten Free white bread and both dishes came out delish!

First time ever making bread pudding. Other than omitting raisins, I followed recipe to a tee. It came out not only beautiful but amazingly delicious. Did not even need any sugary sauces.... will def make again.

Delicious!...my husband is a Native New Orleanian and he loves this bread pudding.  The only variation I make with the recipe is substituing French Vanilla creamer for the 1 1/4 cup of milk.  I also use the Praline Sauce as a topping.

I added slightly less butter (I can't help myself!), but otherwise the same.  I stood the bread up in the pan (see photo).  The photo was pre baking, but came out looking basically the same plus a nice golden brown.  If you push down the slices of bread it will soak the juice right up and soak for an hour.  Also, don't forget to add the raisins, the recipe forgets to add them!  Just sprinkle all over the top before baking.

I tried this recipe for the first time. I substituded almond milk for for the regular milk and the half & half. The most important thing I did was cut the bread into chunks and put it in a gallon zip lock bag. Then I added the liquid then the pecans ( I didn't have rasins). Zip the bag and mix it up. It was so easy. I didn't have to wait an hour, it took less than 3 minutes for the bread to absorb. It was awesome. Will definitely make this again.

I should have known better then to follow this recipe exactly as it was written because it did not require the bread to soak.  Also, the recipe calls for slices of bread rather than cubes.  Again, I should have known better than to follow this recipe exactly.  After baking, the dish was literally layers of bread on top of each other.  The texture was too dry for bread pudding.  I made this for a party and was too embarrassed to serve this to people.  I do not recommend this recipe.

Made this for Christmas Eve and received rave reviews from our guests.  I used half french bread and half cinnamon raisin bread and did't add any more raisins.  I soaked for 20 mins or so before baking (covered).  Uncovered for the last 15 mins or so.  Used a Tbsp of cinnamon.  Otherwise, I followed the instructions as written.  Came out perfect - not too soggy, not to dry.  Coupled it with choices of rum and bourbon sauces :)
