This was a very simple and decent fondant. I could probably even use it to put over a cake, it also tasted better than fondants bought at the store in my opinion. This also depends on what flavoring you use in the fondant. :) I didn't have light corn syrup so I used dark. The color was modified to a light brown but was perfect because I will be making rock candy geodes. Anyway it was a great consistency and if you need it to be firmer, just add more cornstarch. :)

Great taste! Better than store-bought. The texture was quite workable, and the fondant held its shape. This was my first time making or using fondant, and this recipe did the trick. I appreciated the simple ingredients, too.
I did experience some cracking with mine. I used the fondant to make flowers to decorate a cake, mostly rolling it, cutting out shapes, and then molding those shapes. The largest flower was about 4" across, and cracked slightly at the interior corners of the petals, though it still held together.
To avoid this, I would advise that you gradually add extra cornstarch and powdered sugar; I made one of my batches a little too dry and that one had problems with cracking. I think getting the right consistency just takes practice.
I didn't have clear vanilla, so I used a spare amount of vanilla extract as well as a generous splash of almond flavoring.

Don't use cornstarch. Roll f.dough in between to wax papers to not stick. Using too much conf.sugar will cause cracking.

The consistency was similar to MM fondant, but it didn't taste as good and cracked when it was rolled and when handled to put on top of a cake no matter what I did.  Tried this because I got caught without a bag of marshmellows, but probably won't use again.

Worked wonderfully! Just a hint though after mixing all the ingredients knead the fondant with some vegetable shortening it will put moisture back in the fondant and will help it not crack and be more pliable.

I made the recipe until I had added 2 cups of confectioners sugar, and then I divided it and used half as is for frosting, and the other half I finished. It turned out well! Will be making this again in the future ??

Read the comments before I made this. Very very crumbly. Will be sticking with marshmallow from now on.

I made it, but it turned out sloppy and runny and it wouldn't go properly over my cake.??

This recipe was easy to make but it was not easy for me to work with. It cracked and I could not get it on to my cake. I tried everything to get it to do what i needed it to but to no avail.

No matter how much cornstarch I used it fell apart, and cracked. It was good for in a pinch, but my cake looks like my two year old did it. At least my cake is covered.
