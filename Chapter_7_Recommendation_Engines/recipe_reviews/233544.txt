The whole family except my 6 & 2 year olds loved it. I added some Cholula sauce to the filling and sauce for a little extra flavor. Very quick easy dinner.

We make our crepes on a griddle and just pour the batter from a measuring cup (1/3 c)  in a spiral then smear it thin and smooth with the back of the measuring cup.
