I had already cooked a squash for dinner when the kids begged for pancakes, so here is where I landed in my search for a compromise. I followed the lead of another reviewer and doubled the quantity of everything but squash. Sadly, they were way too salty! I had no nutmeg so used pumpkin pie spice with good results. Instead of frying in oil, I made them on my electric griddle. With milk added to thin the batter, the 1/4 cup of batter made nice thin pancakes that tasted like pumpkin pie. They cook a little slower than standard pancakes, but provided a tasty solution to my dinner dilemma. I will make these again, with adjustments.

These were OK as written. However, with a few tweaks I think they could be excellent! The batter was way too thick for pancakes and did not cook evenly, mostly because of the squash. (In fact, I think these would make great dinner cakes as written, maybe over some kind of black bean/sweet corn bed.) I would cut the amount of squash in half for pancakes. I would also add some sugar to the batter, maybe a few tablespoons. The author says they are not meant to be sweet, but I think a little sweetness would improve them a lot as pancakes. I was quite surprised the recipe did not call for milk. I might add some milk (maybe 2 tbsp or so) if the batter is still too thick. I'm looking forward to trying these again, as I always have way too much butternut squash leftover!

I made these last night and I must say they were absolutely delicious!  I did not use the shallots, I used dried cranberries instead (love cranberries) and would use just a tad less cinnamon and nutmeg ( I didn't have fresh nutmeg).  Would definitely make them again. i tried posting my picture but it didn't add. YUM YUM

This recipe is well received in this house. The only problem I had was the darkening of the outer crust, probably due to the sugar content of the squash. Aside from that, it is a very good recipe for us sugar sensitive people or thiose that just want something a little different for breakfast. I ate two 1/4 cup servings and felt satisfied with the ammount as opposed to eating two same size pancakes that give me an over stuffed feeling. This recipe is five stars for flavor.

What looks like a great idea does not really taste great. It was sweet and salty at the same time and did not taste great for me.

After reading other reviews, I halved the amount of squash and used 1 T of fresh shallots instead of dried. I also omitted the currants (didn't have any) and topping (too lazy to make it). I thinned the batter with approx 1/4 C water. I really liked these. The topping and/or currants may be the difference between 4 and 5 stars. When I make them again, I'll add the toppings/currants and re-rate.

I thought I was pretty good! I didn't have any dried currents or shallots but I think I still tasted good. At least my 14 month old loved it!

I used shredded yellow squash that was leftover from my garden, instead of the mashed butternut squash. This worked fine, but I added a little honey to the mixture since yellow is not as sweet as butternut. I also used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.
