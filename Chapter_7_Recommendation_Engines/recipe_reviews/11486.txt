I had the opportunity to find out exactly what hartshorn does for a recipe, since I accidentally forgot to bring it with me to the beach, where I first tried this recipe.  The results of that batch were okay--others liked them--but to me they were heavy and dull.  When I returned home and could actually use the hartshorn I'd bought for this recipe:  oh, wow!!!  This recipe--plus the hartshorn--is a holy grail for me.  The texture is substantial but has a light, clean, dry crunch that I now know is characteristic of hartshorn.  Do go to the trouble of finding some for these cookies; it's definitely worth it!

If you cannot find baker's ammonia (hartshorn) locally you can purchase it through the King Arthur Flour website (kingarthurflour.com).  It does make a difference especially in the crispness of the cookies it is used in and worth trying to find as the other review has said.  Yummy!

What a wonderful cookie!  Sweet, crunchy, and full of the taste of almonds and butter.  This should really bring back the use of hartshorn.

this is almost identical to my grandmothers recipe (she didn't use almond) and it is one of my holiday favorites. Don't be afraid that it smells bad when you bake them... but bake a lot and enjoy -  they keep for a very long time!

Baking with Baker's ammonia was a true revelation!  I followed the recipe exactly and obtained baker's ammonia from my local Middle Eastern grocery store.  The texture was truly melt-in-your mouth - unlike any texture you will get with baking soda or baking powder.  

Now I am inspired to try other experiments with Baker's ammonia!

I guess the ammonia must be the magic ingredient. I could not find and substituted baking powder, baking soda, and salt, and the result was the blandest cookie ever.

Delicious. We usually prepare Swedish spritz cookies (we are Swedish and prepare the entire Traditional Swedish Christmas Eve Dinner)but decided to try these instead. Very similar in taste, but I think the crunch and texture is better in these. The entire family agrees. Please consider less almond extract or replacing with vanilla. The flavor is very strong and may be too much for some people. I used 1-tsp instead of of 1-1/2 tsp. It really is plenty.  Definitely a keeper.

We sprinkled colored sugar on ours like we usually do with the spritz. Find the ammonia for this. It makes it!

This was perfect! I served these for our book club discussion of the Swedish book, "My Grandmother told me to tell you she's sorry."

They were not as light as expected. Did not dissolve in the mouth as expected.  To much shortening flavor. Other than that the cookies tasted fine.
After storing for a day or longer, the cookies took on an ammonia smell which made the cookies undesirable. Tossed them out.

This recipe is all about texture.  MUST use Baker's Ammonia or you are missing the point of the recipe.  If you are tired of the same old same old cookie give this a try.  Perfect for ladies brunch or tea.  I used only 1t of almond extract and 1/2 t of vanilla and did not feel I was missing any almond flavor.  Would do same again next time.  Delightfully light crisp almond coconut grown up cookie.  Does smell like ammonia in batter, when cooking and when just out of oven but then smell goes away and is never super strong.  If you put your nose over cookie dough, you will smell it.  Keep an eye on them, they are much darker on bottom then top of cookie.  Air bake pans worked better on this recipe for me.
