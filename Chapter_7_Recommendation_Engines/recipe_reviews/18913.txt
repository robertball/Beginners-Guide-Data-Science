Excellent recipe. Using slow cooker at holidays frees up oven space & your attention span, e.g., one less item to stir/worry about.  Used canned sweet potatoes/yams, left out nuts, cut back on butter a little.  Everyone enjoyed, even children.  Have also made a few days ahead & either reheated in micro or bought to friends as a side dish.  If anything, reheating a few days late enhances flavor.  Orange juice gives a nice clean undertone flavor to a very simple, easy dish.  Unless you're a purist or hate the taste of canned veggies, use the canned yams/potatoes. I've used fresh baked & canned.  The slight difference the fresh baked makes is not worth the extra time,effort or trouble in my opinion & I'm a bit biased towards using fresh items.

Made on xmas eve. Xmas day put on high for one hour, low for two.  Used reynolds liners. wonderful!!! wasn't dry. no burnt sides.  Always double topping recipe.  Company enjoyed sweets and I was able to enjoy my company. Try the liners they work great.  Not just for cleaning, but to keep your potatoes from drying out.

I used 3 large "real" sweet potatoes, cubed, boiled and mashed, instead of the canned and the flavor was great, but I think the consistency was a little too thin, so I think that 4 large sweet potatoes would have done better.  Very sweet.

I really enjoyed this recipe!  I made it for Thanksgiving, and liked how I could make this in my slowcooker, which left my oven free for cooking other dishes.  I did modify the recipe by using baked, then mashed, sweet potatoes (instead of canned).  I think that gave me a little less sugar taste, too.  The only thing I would alter is the amount of butter; it seemed to be a tad to buttery for my taste.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is my favorite.  I make it every chance I get.

I double the nut/brown sugar and layer it in the crock pot.  I take away a little bit of the milk and add extra orange juice instead.  I also add marshmellows to the top the last 15 minutes of cooking.

This was a big hit at the company potluck.  I gave it a 4 which means it was really good and would make again. 5's are reserved for a select few that are just to die for.
I did make a few changes.  I converted to 12 servings. I only added 1/2 the oj and then added about 1 tsp vanilla.
For the topping I subsituted quick oats for the pecans. I layered as other posters said, and then the last 30 minutes of cooking added mini marshmellows.  So yummy!!  Also I cooked on high for 1 1/2 hrs and then on low for an additional 2 hrs.

My mother and I have been searching for a recipe to replace the sweet potatoes that my grandmother made (we can never duplicate her recipe to our liking, she was the wiz). This recipe seems to be it - it was VERY delicious. I have a very, very large Westbend slow cooker, so I doubled the topping as one batch wouldn't have reached all potatoes as they spread out (it was worth it, every bite came with the nice sweet topping). I also used the 2T of butter for the potatoes and the topping (silly me, I didn't even notice the teaspoon mistake), skipped the pecans, and made it with fresh potatoes, although with the review below I am tempted to try canned (yuck? I'm VERY anti-canned fruits/veggies, they should be banned). Make this with confidence, it's a guaranteed hit.

This recipe is absolutely the BOMB!! What a timesaver, using canned sweet potatoes.  Taste just as good as fresh! The one thing I did differently was cook on High for 1 hour, then on low for the remaining 2 hours.  Otherwise, you'll end up with a crusty top and side.  Be sure to add Marshmallows the last 30 minutes!

This is a wonderful recipe. But I can never manage to follow a recipe all the way through, because I like to make the recipe my own. I doubled the recipe and put in only 1/2 cup milk so that I could add 1/4 cup of Bourbon. YUMMY!!! Then double or TRIPLE the topping and add marshmallows and cinnamon. ENJOY!

I served this recipe for Thankgiving this year and I would have to say that we all enjoyed it. I only made one change and that was to add 1 and one half cups of mini marshmallows.  Also I noticed that in the list of ingredients it mentions 2 tablespoons of butter in the potatoe mix and 2 teaspoons of butter for the topping, while in the directions it says 2 tablespoons of melted butter for the topping.  I did use 2 tablespoons in both the potatoe mix and in the topping.

I only used this recipe because I knew there would be no room in the oven on Thanksgiving for anything else to go in. I made it AS IT WAS WRITTEN and the only thing I did different was to double the topping part. Everyone RAVED at how good this was including myself! My Mother swears it is the best sweet potato casserole she has ever tasted and I believe she is right! I will never bake one in the oven again.  This was not a dessert tasting casserole like so many are, it was perfect! I used a crock pot liner for the very 1st time with this and clean up was a breeze.

Ummm... delicious!  My mother has made the same sweet potato casserole for decades, but we had several things on the menu for Christmas and I couldn't fit another thing in the oven.  I was somewhat worried about a crockpot casserole, but this was amazing!  I followed the advice of others and baked 6 SP on 400 for 75 minutes , then peeled and mashed them instead of using the canned yams.  Wouldn't think of going back to canned ever again! Also on the advice of others, I added an extra T of reg & brown sugars and doubled the topping.  Set on High for 3 hours and added marshmallows (to half) during the last 45 minutes.  Took off the lid for the last 30 min so the topping would harden and the we could hardly wait to eat it! Everyone raved and many went back for thirds! Can't say enough good about it!  Thanks for the recipe and the tips!

I doubled this recipe and prepared it all the night before.  I took it to work, dumped it in the slow cooker and let it go on high for 4 hours.  Everyone at worked loved it!  The sides didn't burn or get dry at all.  Will make this one again.

I made this with can sweet potatoes and I din't think they were anything special. I then made them with real sweet potatoes and added a little cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg. Much better with real potatoes.

Excellent!  This was a hit at Thanksgiving.  I took the lid off the last 20 minutes to release some of the stem and harden up the brown sugar topping.

Everyone really liked this recipe, when my aunt asked for a copy, she could not believe it was made with can sweet potatoes.  I liked the fact that you can make it in the crock pot, but 3 hours on high is too long I cooked mine for 2 hours on high then turn it to low for an hour & it was still a little burnt around the edge.  I also doubled the topping & added mini marshmallows on top.

I made these yesterday, followed recipe exactly as written. Everyone loved them, though some wished there had been no nuts. My husbands first words as he began eating were "wow, what's in these sweet potatos?" He is not a huge fan of S.P., but he sure likes these!

I too used the low setting on the crockpot--This was very good and usually I'm not a canned veggie person.  I will make more of the topping next time, and put a layer of it in the middle, so the later sevings still get some of the good stuff!  Maybe a bit less butter...

I absolutely love this recipe.  I make it every year for Thanksgiving.  The only thing I change is that I prefer using fresh sweet potatoes versus canned.  Also, I double the topping.  I make two layers of potatoes and topping.  Yumm

I'll be making this again.  I added about a quarter cup of crushed pineapple.  It was delicious but I should've done a better job of draining the pineapple as I had quite a bit of liquid pooling around the casserole.  This was also good the next day--hard to stop eating.

I was thrilled to see a slow cooker recipe, to free up my oven, for Sweet Potato Casserole!  It was Turkey Day for just me and my husband, and he doesn't particularly LIKE sweet potatoes, so I felt free to improvise and omit what I didn't have and what I didn't like!  I did NOT use the pecans, or any sugar.  In a large bowl, I just mashed the ONE can of sweet potatoes (again, it was just for the 2 of us), added a tablespoon of melted margarine, a tablespoon of orange juice, ONE egg, NO milk, no flour, and sprayed the slow cooker with olive oil to grease.  I took a lot of people's advice:  Cooked on high for 2 hours, turned to low the 3rd hour, and also at the beginning of the 3rd hour, I covered the entire top of the sweet potatoes with LARGE marshmallows (they melted into the potatoes).  What a wonderful flavor!  I definitely will make this again!  Of COURSE I gave it 5 stars, because I didn't make it as written.  (If I had made it EXACTLY as written and THEN didn't like it, I THEN would have decreased the number of stars!  How can ANYONE give a recipe less than 5 stars if they don't make it EXACTLY as written???  I am still mystified by that!)

This got RAVE reviews at my Christmas dinner table!  It was SUPER easy to make (I make it on xmas eve day) and because it cooks in my slowcooker it didnt take up any room in my busy oven on Christmas day!! The only changes I made were I omitted the pecans due to someone having a nut allergy but added mini marshmellows to the last 15mins of cooking. I will definitely make this again...

Long overdue praise!  I made this last Thanks Giving dinner & was totally wowed by it!  My borderline diabetic step-dad couldn't leave it alone!!  He was craving it as soon as he left our home!  I couldn't quit eating it, the topping is scrumptious, it stays crispy and SO good when you just spoon it out & chomp away. It looks wonderful, too!  I don't even think I ate more than one slice of (sensational BBQed)turkey & I forwent the pies altogether!!! This was absurdly fantastic!  It made a monster out of me!  This year, maybe for my step-dad's sake I'll use splenda? for my sake, too, since I just delivered baby #5 a week ago & have a bit of chub to rid...  Maybe....

These came out really good, even my kids liked it! Only made a few changes, used evaporated mik, which is better in the slow cooker.  Also added an additional table spoon of sugar, 1 table of vanilla extract  and cinnamon.  1/2 before serving added little more brown sugar on top, and mini marshmellows.

This was so yummy!  I used fresh sweet potatoes and cooked them first, then peeled and mashed.  I also added a little cinnamon.  I took some others advice and increased the topping amount.  Will definitely made this again!

This is definitely a keeper!  I also doubled the topping ingredients and used fresh yams.  I'm going to try it with the canned sweet potatoes for Christmas.  Everyone in the family raved about this recipe at Thanksgiving.

I made this today and it was a HUGE hit.  I don't eat sweet potatoes so I am giving this review from 6 people who do and they all said it was 5 stars.  The only thing I did different was use fresh sweet potatoes instead of canned; other than that, followed it exactly.

I made these on Thanksgiving and was NOT impressed. The top will start to burn pretty fast if you don't keep checking on it.  The flavor was okay-but I will not make again.

This was pretty good, but I added an extra can of yams and used all brown sugar verses white for the entire recipes.

This is a wonderful recipe!! I have been using it for many years now, so I figured it was about time I reviewed it. I make this practically every holiday, and everyone always loves it. The only change I make is I double the topping, that's all. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this at Thanksgiving for my family.  Everyone seemed to enjoy it.  I had read the reviews and turned the temp to low after an hour.  It still got a little too brown around the edge.  I also doubled the topping.  Overall very good.  I may try the crockpot liners next time.

I made this for our Thanksgiving luncheon at work - will definitely make again. I doubled the recipe for the larger crowd - next time I will make extra topping. Also, I felt 3-4 hours on high was too much.. after an hour of high I cut it back to low and then to warm after another 90 minutes of that. I felt high for that long was too much in my opinion.  I had several people ask for the recipe!

Made w/only 2 minor changes and we loved it!  I doubled the topping recipe and I cut back on the butter just a little in the main recipe.  It's a little soupy, but the taste is great.  It was nice to do in the slow cooker for Thanksgiving instead of juggling everything around in the oven.

I took this to my company potluck and people really liked it.  I thought it was delicious, but I wish the topping would have been a tad more crunchy.  That's an easy fix though, next time I will just transfer the ceramic dish from the slow cooker into the oven for 20 minutes or so before serving.  I doubled the topping and was glad I did, it's scrumptious!  I love that you can make it way ahead of time and not use up much time (or any) in the oven.

Use of canned sweet potatoes made this grainy. I will try this again in future with my riced baked-the-heck-out-of-em sweet potatoes I normally use for a sweet potato casserole.

I made this for Thanksgiving. I loved that I could pop it into the slow cooker and focus on other things. I added about half a bag of miniature marshmallows to the top before I turned the slow cooker on. Yum!

Excellent! Turned out great layered in the slow cooker on high 3 hours, then low about 2 more hours. Added marshmallows on top about 45 mins before serving, but would've been better only 30 mins before - they melted a little too much.  Still excellent & many compliments!

Doubled the recipe and reduced to 3/4 the amount of sugar and butter only because I used this for an office party. I thought it could have used the full amounts though. Will have to try again. Also added a dash of cinnemon to taste too. Came home with an empty crock pot and the liners work great too.

I thought this was very good.  It's convenient to cook it in the crockpot and I took the advice of the crock pot liners and I'm glad I did (cleanup so much easier and the potatoes didn't get dry).  I also cooked on high for 1 hour then low for ~ 2.5 hours.  I doubled the recipe and used eight fresh sweet potatoes, but I think I needed more because it was a litte buttery.  I will definitely make this again.

I modified this to use "fresh" sweet potatoes. I baked the potatoes and then mashed them. I also layered some of the topping in the middle of the crock.  And I used crockpot liners to keep the potatoes moist and for easier cleanup. This recipe is a definite keeper!

At first I thought this was going to be a really weird dish but once we tried it it was sooooo good.  For those of you who are curious about the taste and look I can tell you that it is not overly sweet, maybe a bit sweeter than sweet potatoes but nothing too drastic.  The texture is like a very soft cheesecake.  I used natural sweet potatoes (boiled them and then mashed them)and for topping I only sprinkled cinnamon and more brown sugar, enough to cover the mixture with a very thin layer.  There was more cinnamon than brown sugar.  I ran out of butter for the top but it was amazing.  Thank you for this recipe!

This was an excellent dish! I used canned sweet potatoes, and boiled them as directed on the can before I used them in this recipe.  I added a can of crushed pineapple to the sweet potatoes; also I doubled the topping.  It was a hit on Thanksgiving.

This is now a Thanksgiving staple in our house.  Not only does everyone love the taste, but the slow cooker eliminates the hassle of juggling multiple dishes in the oven and doesn't require any last-minute work.  Every Thanksgiving side dish should be like this!  I put pecans over only half the dish to satisfy everyone's tastes, and I think it tastes great either way.

Enjoyed this dish for a holiday work party! Great reviews from co-workers and did what others did and almost doubled the topping. I also used allspice seasoning (about 1 Tbsp) and a little salt and it was great!

This did nothing for me.  It tasted like regular sweet potatoes.  I added more butter and sugar and that helped a lot.  There are better sweet potato casserole recipes out there.

Really easy, everyone said it was yummy (I wouldn't know, I don't like sweet potatoes), and making one less thing that had to go in the oven at Thanksgiving was a blessing.

This was ok.  I made it exactly like the recipe except cooked it on low the last 2 hours.  Didn't burn or anything.  Tasted pretty good, but nothing crazy exciting.

GREAT! I made a few changes. I used pineapple juice instead or orange, almond milk instead of moo juice, upped the brown sugar in the sweet potato mixture, and didn't use the eggs at all. Everyone wanted the recipe and i'll make it again soon. Thanks!!

Smooth as silk and so easy to make.  A great way to get one dish made ahead of time and save room in your oven!

These were ok and freed up oven space but I think from now on I'll make a casserole.

I lost my old recipe for sweet potato casserole, and this one is now my new favorite. Admittedly, I do often change the recipe slightly, but not because of any fault in the original. My changes: I omit the orange juice and instead add a layer of canned manderin oranges between the middle of the sweet potato mash; I sometimes increase the brown sugar and pecans a little; I bake it in a casserole dish for 40 mins. Yummy!

This was so delicious, I made this specifically for my dad for thanksgiving. Not only was he appreciatative for it. The whole family loved it. We had no idea that yams could taste this good. I boiled and mashed the yams, I did this because for so many years we disliked the syrup from the canned yams. I also doubled the topping and added 1/2 cup of pecans. I can't wait for to taste the left overs.

I love this recipe!  I have been using it for a few years or so.  I like the convenience of using the slow cooker, which leaves more room in the oven for other dishes.  It has been a hit on holidays!  I also like that it is so easy to make.

I made this for Thanksgiving last year and it was a huge hit.  It was great having a dish that didn't need the stove!  I filled a big crock pot and it was empty at the end of the day.

This is very good.  I used a 6 qt crockpot, and found it better to double the nut topping to get a nice top layer.  I made this for a church gathering (I'm always nervous to bring something when most of the women there have been cooking for 50 years, give or take.)  Every loved them! My daughters also loved them, and were glad to see sweet potatoes could be made without using marshmellows.  Thank you for a definate keeper!

How nice it was to discover a slow cooker technique for one of my holiday favorites!

This turned out wonderfully. The only thing I will do different in the future is skip out on putting the extra butter on top. It was a little too buttery for my liking with that layer on top.

This is really good & easy using canned sweet potatoes! This does not taste like you used canned. I don't know if this happened to anyone else, but after 3 1/2 hours on high, mine was burnt around the edges. So next time I will cook it on low. Word to the wise!!!

I needed a recipe that is without dairy so I amended this one & it worked wonderfully. I used fresh sweet potatoes (5). I washed, peeled, & chopped them & boiled in a large pot until tender. I then transferred to the mixing bowl and blended with almond milk, brown/white sugar, and butter smart balance. ( I omitted the egg completely, as I was fearful it would cook in the mixing bowl with the steaming hot sweet potatoes).  For the topping, I used arrowroot flower and applesauce in place of the butter.  (I also doubled the topping amount).  It tasted fantastic & when cooked as directed, even got a bit crispy on top. A great way to save oven space!  Next time, I may mix the day before to save time and then cook in crock pot the next day. I ended up with a completely vegan dish that was a big hit!

I tried this for our homecoming at church.  Plugged it up before Sunday School (on high), and it was ready after the service.  I added vanilla, little extra sugar and made extra topping, and also omitted the OJ.  It will be great for holidays when the oven is busy!

Made this for Thanksgiving.  It was fab.  I used suggestion of a little cinnamon in the 'topping' and layered it.  I beat the potatoes with a mixer, and wish I hand't... they were a little too 'pureed' and didn't maintain the sweet potato texture.  Wish I'd thought of that before.  Will absolutely make again.

A great alternative to preparing a sweet potato dish in the oven--oven space is so valuable on holidays!  These were really good.  I'll never bake them in the oven again--always the crockpot from now on.

This recipe is awesome! Even family members who do not particularly care for sweet potatoes liked this! I added 1 tsp of vanilla extract to the sweet potato mixture. I also doubled the topping and added a bit of vanilla extract and cinnamon to it. This recipe is a nice change from a regular sweet potato dish. I will definately make this again!

This is the second year that I have prepared this dish for Christmas.  I added minature marshmallows to the mixture before cooking as someone suggested in an earlier post.  This dish is always well received by my guests.  I must admit that one of my favorite aspects of this dish is the convenience!

I made this yesterday for Thanksgiving.  My one 9yo son proclaimed it the best casserole ever and I lost count of how many helpings he had, and his brother likewise went back for repeated helpings.  And dh's older cousins who came over raved about it as well and kept going for more.  So it was a hit!  The only changes were using 1/4 cup butter instead of 1/3 because some people said it was too buttery; I don't think it really made a difference,  and doubling the topping, which seems standard.  I cooked on high for 1 hour, and then low 2hours.  It was just getting to the point where it would burn at the edges.  I didn't use a liner, but just soaked the crockpot for a bit and it was easy to clean up.  I was nervous to try a new recipe at a holiday meal, but so glad I did.

I am giving this recipe 4 stars because half the people that ate it, loved it and the other half didn't.  I think it needed more sugar and I am not a sweet loving person.  But when it comes to sweet potato casserole, I do like it sweet.  I would probably 1 and a half times the amount of sugar the next time.

I've been looking for a good sweet potato recipe for the holidays for a long time.  This is the one.  It was easy using the canned sweet potatoes.  The amounts were a little odd and I forgot the orange juice, but it turned out great.  I will definitely make again.

I tried this today for a post-Thanksgiving potluck at work.  I didn't have any eggs, so I had to leave those out.  It doesn't seem to have affected the outcome too much, though...so far it's getting rave reviews!

I did as others suggested and doubled the pecan topping.

This was excellent. It's great to have a sweet potatoe recipe without tons of sugar! It even tastes great cold :)

I've been looking for a recipe that doesn't add a whole cup of sugar to the potatoes, this is wonderful.  I used 1 29 oz can and 3 normal sized potatoes for the recipe, came out great!  Will definitely make this again.

This was a huge hit at Thanksgiving and I am making it again for Christmas.  Instead of using canned sweet potatoes, I cubed and boiled them for 20 minutes. It turned out great!

My family loved this recipe and I've been told to put it in 'rotation' for other holidays.  I bought two large cans of potatoes and adjusted the recipe to fit. (That was my biggest challenge, making the recipe ingredients fit the amount of potatoes I bought.) The only thing I'd do differently is make more topping, which I loved.

This was delicious! I doubled the recipe for our Thanksgiving crowd, then quadrupled the topping per other reviewers.  I layered sweet potato mixture with topping three times.  Toward the end, I added mini-marshmallows to the top.  Also, I used a crock pot liner which kept the casserole from burning and made clean-up a breeze.  Fantastic!  We'll be making this again.

Just the recipe I was looking for to take to an office potluck.  I doubled the recipe and cooked in my 5 qt crockpot (with space left over).  Saved a small casserole-sized dish to cook in the oven later.  I used a large mixing bowl and electric hand mixer to mash the potatoes and mix with the wet ingredients(easy!).  As other reviews recommended, I also doubled the topping.  NOTE:  Recipe ingredients call for 2t butter but references 2T butter in the directions (you will want to use T).  Also sprinkled a dash of nutmeg & cinnamon on topping.  Thanks for this easy and delicious recipe.  It was was a big hit at the potluck and will go into my permanent file.

Great recipe.  It was so nice to use my crock pot instead of taking up room in the oven for my holiday sweet potatoes.  This recipe is not too sweet which was perfect to go with the rest of the meal.  It turned out exactly as I hoped with a little crunch on top thanks to the pecans.  I used my small food processor to mix the pecans, flour and sugar in the topping and it made the pecans very small which we liked.  This will be a keeper and a regular at our holiday dinners.

I was looking for a crockpot sweet potato dish because I was going to travel for about 1 hour with the dish in the back of the car, so I needed something that would be done, but that could be kept warm once we arrived at our destination.

Decided to try this recipe and it was a hit!! Everyone LOVEd it (even people who normally don't eat sweet potatoes).  I used Splenda sugar substitute instead of actual sugar, it turned out GREAT.

This is definitely going to be filed under "must-have" for future holiday and dinner gatherings where sweet potatoes are a must.

One note was that I cooked mine on high for 3 hours and if it was to cook any longer, it probably would've burned some.  Next time I want to try cooking it on low instead, I think that just may make it PERFECT! :)

Great recipe.  Invaluable in a one-oven kitchen like mine.  This is the second year in a row I've made this for Thanksgiving and everyone raves about it.  I didn't change anything at all - made it exactly as called for.

What a lifesaver! It freed up my oven for other items. And, this was so easy to put together with canned potatoes! Was very good! The only problem I had was I ran out of brown sugar!! I had to use white in the topping. Wasn't bad but I think it would've presented better with the brown. My husband won't do nuts so I didn't add those. Very good dish!

This was very blah, and the texture was very mushy. I give it 3 stars though because it didn't take up much of my stove real estate.

Just delicious - I can't tell you how many copies of this recipe I had to give out after making it for some pre-Thanksgiving dinners!  Yesterday at a craft workshop a friend was telling some of the other ladies there about this 'to die for' Sweet Potato Casserole that I made last year......that about says it all!

Good side dish, followed recipe exactly as written. It was nice to use slow cooker as oven was tied up with a huge Turkey. I would make this again.

This is delicious and VERY easy. I omitted the orange juice and added vanilla extract. Also I doubled the topping which really makes the dish. As always - for a sweet tasting dish - use yams and you will love this recipe too. :D

Very good! Was a big hit at Thanksgiving. I doubled the topping recipe as others suggested and it was perfect. Another person suggested cooking on LOW instead of HIGH and I wish I had followed that. HIGH started to burn and then I had to turn it down. It was a hit nonetheless.

This recipe was one of the ones I made for my son's baptism.  It went wonderfully with ham also.  I have since made it three more times.  It doubles nicely.

Since I'm the only person between me and my sisters who like sweet potatoes, I was chosen to bring them when we made Thanksgiving dinner for our family (my dad's a big fan). I found this recipe, and loved the fact that it was really quick and easy to make. I make use of my slow-cooker as much as possible! I didn't change anything, and it was a big hit! There was almost nothing left for leftovers. I can't wait to see what my new in-laws think of it this year.

I've made this recipe for years!  It's a big hit!  I use fresh sweet potatoes, I double the recipe.  For the topping, you MUST at least 3X it - I like to make 4 times as much.  USE A CROCK POT LINER!!  Cook it; keep it on warm all day.  Heat it up the next couple days.  yummmmm  PREP:  I cook and mash the sweet potatoes days before, usually make the entire mix; then just heat it up that morning, put it in the crockpot, put the topping on.   (My family will not allow me to bring anything else to any gathering.... for years.

This has become a Thanksgiving tradition. Always use about 6-7 large fresh sweet potatoes. I can bake them the night before then let them sweeten even more overnight in the fridge. Next morning, mix it all together and cook on high for 1 hour then another 2-3 hours on low. It travels nicely in slow cooker and easy cleanup if you use liners.

This was super easy to make ahead . I added about 4 oz. crushed pineapple at the beginning and added small marshmallows across the top for the last 30 minutes at  my destination. I also  used a torch to brown the top and someone made an oddball request for burnt marshmallow.Due to a few requests I removed the pecans from my dish . I would definitely make this again .

I made this for Easter. I used fresh sweet potato’s (5) large, boiled them till tender and mashed them. I then followed the recipe. For a beautiful presentation,when finished cooking I put mini marshmallows on top placed the pan pot under the oven broiler to brown them. My family loved them everyone had seconds. The best part is it’s simple and not too sweet. Thank you for a great recipe. Cheri

Yum! I used fresh yams and cooked them first in my Instantpot. Then I used the pot on slow cooker mode. High for one hour and low for three.  I doubled the crumble but misread the butter amount, so instead of four teaspoons, I ended up using four TABLESPOONS! Didn't hurt it a bit. Since the o.j. amount was so small and I didn't have any on hand, I just omitted it. I don't think it affected anything. Everyone loved this dish!

Easy to make, but very bland. I even added extra brown sugar & marshmallows. Definitely not something I'll make again with this recipe. Think I'll stick to the recipe I have that goes in the oven.

SO yummy! Made this for Thanksgiving dinner with my family and everyone loved them! I added marshmallows in the last 30 mins as others suggested- they melted right away , I'd wait until the last 5 or 10 mins to add them. But it was delicious! It tasted like dessert, so without the marshmallows it would be great too!  Still would be sweet and delicious!

I liked this. I used 4 big SP's, cooked in the microwave. Doubled the topping like most others done. Turned out great. The only problem it didn't last long. Will try adding more spices, and add pecans to the SP mix as well.

This was a big hit at our Thanksgiving meal!  I used all the ingredients as described in the recipe, although I did turn it down to low after it cooked for a couple hours. We thought the sweetness level was just right.  Next time I'll double it so we have more leftovers.

The only change i made was fresh sweet potatoes, but I just didn't think it was that good. Kind of bland. Not sure I'll make it again.

I wish I could give this 5 stars.  The taste was very good, but after cooking on high for 3 1/2 hours, it was very loose.  Not runny, but did not set up like I had hoped it would.  I was hoping it would be more custard-like.  The topping was awesome.  I made this to take to a pot luck and I have a LOT left over.  Kinda disappointed.  Well, at least it tastes good, even if it never set very well.

This dish is always a hit when I serve it. Instead of 1/2 cup of milk I use 1/4 cup of milk and 1/4 cup of orange juice plus the tablespoon of oj that it calls for. I also put the zest of one orange in the topping. It is yummy!

This was my first time to make this type of dish. It was for an office party. I increased the #servings to 20 and it was 95% gone when it was time to leave. It was very good.

This was a HUGE hit last Thanksgiving! The adults and children LOVED it! PERFECT!! It tasted just as wonderful as the baked casseroles and simplified meal preparation and oven time for other dishes. Will use this recipe again..

Didn't care for this at all.  To be fair, I think the problem was not the recipe but the canned sweet potatos which made for a very inferior-tasting dish.

I made this for Christmas dinner and everyone LOVED it!  I had several requests for the recipe.  Many commented that it was the best dish on the buffet table.

Excellent & so easy to make.  I made it for Thanksgiving & it was nice to have one less thing to cook in the oven!  **Update**  I've made this so many times & it's always good.  If my topping is a little mushy, I take the slow cooker insert & put it under the broiler for a few minutes.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit.  I picked this recipes because I could use my crock pot and free up stove top space.  Super easy to make.  As suggested I doubled the topping.  Even my nephews who don't normally like sweet potatoes loved it.  Thanks for great recipe.

This was good. I doubled the topping. I'll probably try it again. The best part is that since it cooks in the slow cooker it frees up the oven for the main course.
