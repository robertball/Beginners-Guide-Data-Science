This is an excellent recipe for shrimp toast! Just like the kind that I got as a kid.. I would suggest using the white cream bread that is really square if you can find it at asian markets. It is a little more dense than regular white bread. Also, I fried them upside down so the shrimp would cook. I had no problem of the paste coming off.. My friend's kids devoured them! I wouldn't suggest having the kids make them though because of frying the oil, but they will love them. 
Adding this to the review... use soy sauce/Chinese-Colman's mustard mixture for dipping sauce, or chili sauce/soy sauce mixture for dipping. Delicious!

Easy to make, and pretty tasty.  This would make a good addition to a appetite platter.  We found it needed tartar sauce since it's a bit bland.
