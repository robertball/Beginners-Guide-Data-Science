I made these jar cakes a couple of days ago.  They didn't turn out very well at all.  They looked nice but when I opened one, just for testing, it smelled terrible.  I did taste it and then hade my friend, my husband and my children try it, they said it was horrible!  I have made other cake in a jar recipes and have not had any problems with them.  I have to say that I will never make this recipe again and I tossed out the recipe.  Sorry!

We just tried this recipe and it did over flow. also the batter made more than 6 (8) We will try again and space the jars farther apart. The cake tastes great even if it does not look like much due to uneven heat.

I found that it is very important to space the jars as far apart as possible for even baking as well as keeping them from overflowing.  I used pecans instead of walnuts and added coconut.
