Not the best Sloppy Joes I've ever had but good with substitutions. I didn't have any peppers so I didn't use them. Added a tablespoon ketchup and a couple of shakes of Yuchatan Sunshine Habanero Pepper Sauce for more "kick!". Tastes even better the next day when flavors have had a chance to blend. Used on toasted bread with a slice of cheese on top, then microwaved.

These are sooooo good, and good for you.  I love to cook with ground turkey; the red pepper is a great addition to regular old sloppy joes.  I have to stop thinking about it, theyâ€™re making me hungry!!

Very good and easy! My whole family loved it! The only thing I would do differently is brown the turkey a little more before I add in the tomato sauce. Making it a little more chunky. I served mine over toasted bread and sprinkled a little cheese over it. YUMMY! I will make this again.

This was good, although I have had better.  It was quick and easy to make and I too added a touch of barbecue sauce which added some much needed zing.  I also topped with shredded cheddar.

I loved this recipe. The only changes I made was that I added a pinch of allspice and chili powder. It was fantastic! YUM

My family did not care for this recipe.  It tasted like tomato sauce and nothing else.  I feel this recipe needs alot of work for my family to eat it again.  It definately does not taste anything like regular sloppy joe so be prepared.

These were pretty good! I didn't think I was going to enjoy it so much. The hubby added melted cheese on his...yummy!

This is a keeper. I deleted the bell peppers, added jalapenos for some kick and instead of tomatoes sauce I used whole, peeled tomatoes and crushed them up. Very impressed.
