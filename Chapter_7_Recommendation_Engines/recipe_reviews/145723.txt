I tried this on chicken and it was o.k.  The alcohol flavor is very noticeable.  I think I'd like to try it on flank steak the next time like the submitter suggested.  It seemed to be missing a little something, maybe as simple as salt?

Excellent!! I've used this marinade on chicken and shrimp, both excellent. I can't wait to try it on fish. I did use more lime juice (about 1/2 cup) and an extra tablespoon of honey, and bumped it up to 2 teaspoons cumin since we love it.

Tender, flavorable, and simple. This is a basic that you can use by itself or add things to suit your taste. I added some chili powder and ceyenne for extra kick but this is a great starter recipe. The tequila and lime tenderize and the honey carmelized and sealed in the additional flavors. I even used a cheap tequila we had sitting around for years and I was very impressed with the results. If you like the lime to shine through, use extra.

I really wanted to like this marinade because it sounds so fresh and unique. When first making it the tequila was overwhelming so I added a little more honey and lime juice. Luckily after letting the ingredients mingle for about 4 hours, the alcohol taste was taken down a lot. But as one reviewer mentioned, it was missing something. I didn't taste the lime even though I put extra in. Overall it was ok on chicken, but I probably won't try it again.

Just ok. Followed it exactly. My wife and 20 year old daughter both said, eh, itâ€™s alright.

I used a raspberry infused tequila, which makes a very tasty drink so I was disappointed with the marinade.  There was nothing wrong with it and it smelled wonderful while cooking.  The downside was that even after 24 hours in the marinade there was very little perceptible flavor boost and the honey made it almost guaranteed to char.  I doubt I will make it again, but thank you for the chance to try something new.
