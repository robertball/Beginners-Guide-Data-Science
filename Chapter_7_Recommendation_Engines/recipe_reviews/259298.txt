This will be a repeat for positive! I used Trader Joe's chicken tenders and because they are so little I was not able to get a really good browning on them. I figured it was going to be easier to let them finish cooking with the sauce getting thickened. It was a good choice. I think you need to season the chicken more than just that little bit of garlic powder so I used my favorite seasoning from this site: Papa's Seasoning (I use it on everything!). I made some jasmine rice which was a perfect accompaniment to the sauce. I'm so grateful to be able to have leftovers for tomorrow night! Thanks for this recipe! It was yummy!

12 22 17... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/259298/creamy-mexican-chipotle-chicken/... 'Not bad but not a "wow" either. I increased the garlic by much. Fine but not special. Department of the obvious but chicken with chipotles & cream.
