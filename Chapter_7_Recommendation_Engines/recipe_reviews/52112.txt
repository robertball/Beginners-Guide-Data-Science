Always a hit at any event!  I use a packet of Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing Mix in lieu of the italian packet and I like to add 1/4 cup of sour cream.  You need to let the ingredients season overnight for a smoother, more powerful flavor.  I have used the dill weed or lemon pepper on top of the cucumbers and have received positive reviews on both choices.  Enjoy!

This was a huge hit!!  I used regular old white bread.  
***As a side note after the fact - When I mentioned I was making these for our holiday party this week, the people who had them the last time I made them just about flipped.  These really are a great party hit if you make them as the recipe states but you MUST let them sit overnight and the dill is a great addition for flavor!!***

These are addictive.  I made them for my daughter's garden-themed birthday party and used flower cookie cutters to cut the (lightly toasted)bread into shapes, spread the cream cheese mixture on, and placed flower-shaped cucumber slices on top.  They were sooooo good!!

I make these substituting 1/2 cup of Vanilla yogurt for the Mayonnaise (more carbs but significantly less fat). If you don't like using packaged salad dressings, try adding 1-2 Tbls. lemon juice and 1/8-1/4 tsp. each garlic powder, basil, oregano, parsley and cayenne pepper to your cream cheese and then "drizzle" olive oil (approx. 1 Tbls. at a time) -- stirring/mixing between "drizzles" -- until you attain your desired consistency (I usually need 4-6 Tbls.). SO Good!

I made a couple changes but wanted to post review for those who were thinking of doing the same...I used Hidden Valley Ranch mix instead of Italian and used plain white bread.  I had one that I toasted and one non-toasted(prefer this way MUCH more).  Even with changes, I found this to be very tasty. I will be making this again and am looking forward to using Italian mix next time.

I discovered this recipe many years ago and in that time have eaten unladylike quantites of this delightful little bite.  I usually cut the bread with a cookie cutter to give it a little more eye appeal, but that's just me.  Also lovely with a little shrimp perched on top, anchored in a bit of spread.

I made these for a baby shower last month and they were great. I've already given the recipe to several people.

I made a few small changes, just to suit my tastes. I put dill in the cream cheese mixture, rather than on top, just to give it more flavor. I probably used 1-2 teaspoons. Then I just used regular ole' white sandwich bread, cut off the crusts and sliced into triangles.

A yummy, light treat worth making for showers, brunches or would be perfect for Easter.

Thank you - I made them for a community picnic and was asked for the recipe as well. I lightly toasted rye bread and cut them with a round cookie cutter. I added county herb dry salad mix with a half teaspoon of dill and left it over night. At other suggestions I also added an extra 1/2 cup of sour which helped stretch it a bit more.I also used english cucumbers because they are a perfect size. Topped them off with more dill and this is a must - Dill, dill, dill - I am glad they were all eaten because they are so addictive that if any came home I would of ate them! If you need to make an impression on a large group, make these you can't go wrong. I also think it is a  reasonably priced recipe to make for 100 plus people.

Turned out great.  I added 1 teas of dill and decreased the amount of the italian dressing just a smidge.    One thing that made these even better:  Get the "take and bake" unbaked French loaves from the grocery store and bake them up when you are ready to prepare the sandwiches. REALLY tasty!

I was really looking forward to this recipe. I made these for my in-laws and they turned out too strong in flavor. The combination is nice, but the Italian dressing severely overpowers the spread. I might make it again, but if so, I'll make it with half of a package of the dry mix. Add half of the packet, and taste first. If the flavor is good, leave the other half out.

Really good recipe, I've made this for two different parties now, and it's been a hit both times. I make these open-faced whenever I make them and use what the package describes as "mild Italian" dressing mix. My stepmother also liked it so much she asked me for the recipe. It's also extremely easy to make, and looks really nice too, which is a plus. I'd definitely recommend it.

My daughter brings these to parties but she uses the small square cocktail-size pumpernickel bread. I've never seen a tray of anything disappear as these do.  They are really good and I don't generally like cucumbers.

AWESOME!    My whole family enjoyed this.  I will say that we took crusts off of regular white/wheat bread and flattened them with a rolling pin and cut them into fourths.  This made a thinner bread layer and more petite bite sized sandwiches.  I can see using fancy heart or flower cookie cutters to make these for a garden party or a tea party.  Even my cucumber hating daughter and husband was pleasantly surprised by liking this sandwich.  A keeper recipe for sure!

These were really good and I did add dill to the  mixture as well as sprinkled it on top - the only thing I didn't like was that as they sat out on the table (on a hot summer day - but was inside) the mixture melted and when you took a bite it often fell off in a gloop on your plate.  Next time I will make and then stick in the fridge until the very last minute.

I needed a vegetarian option for our wedding shower, and these pick up sandwiches were great.  I could hear people saying "wow, these sandwiches are really good".  I followed the recipe, but used white bread cut into little triangles.  It's a very light flavored little sandwich perfect for a tea party or shower.

1/2 cup of mayo was too much.  Someone suggested using vanilla yogurt.  I will try that next time instead of the mayo.  Or maybe try using Miracle Whip.  Also the package of Italian dressing was way too strong.  Definitely need to use half a packet (.4 ounce) instead of a full packet.  .7 ounce was too strong, and I was already using a mild Italian.

I used a packet of Hidden Valley Ranch Italian seasoning and it was way too salty to eat. I ended up dumping the whole thing.

These were wonderful! I've tried to recreate cucumber sandwiches on my own before, but they tasted nothing like the deliciousness I remembered. Until now, that is. I used low-fat cream cheese, mayo made with olive oil, and the homemade ranch dressing mix from this site. (I didn't use Italian dressing mix because I lacked some of the necessary spices to make that particular blend.) But the ranch worked wonderfully-I made it the night before and the flavor was perfect the next day. These sandwiches were cool, refreshing, light, and SO flavorful. I brought them to Bible study and they were a hit. Thanks for this recipe-it did not disappoint.  I will be making these again soon!

I am getting ready to make these again for the 3rd time...per requests! Each time I have made them for large parties and now they have been talked about and I was asked to make them again for a group of 300 for an art showing. They really are delish. I do have to agree with a few things though, the full amount of dressing mix is too strong, you don't need the whole amount. Def. let sit overnight...just makes it even yummier. The dill is great sprinkled on top and the presentation is great! Definetly a keeper!

Loved these, and so did everyone at the party...I made about 60 and they were gone in a snap.  I wanted them to really be "sandwiches," so I topped them with another piece of bread spread with a bit of the cream cheese mixture.  Just used regular white bread and made them small.  So good!

This is my new favorite recipe for its simplicity in ingredients, ease in putting together, its healthy, low-calorie benefits and the fact that it is so delectable it's practically addictive! Only because I did not have fresh dill weed to garnish on top, I put two teaspoons in the spread. A dollop of sour cream loosens the firmness and makes it easier to spread.

If you use Party Rye they are the perfect size for the cucumber slices. I also prefer to use the English cucumbers.

These are nice sandwiches. I used pepperage farms very thinly sliced white bread and thought it was perfect for these. I trimmed the crust and cut them into triangles. I also added the dill to the cream cheese...the dill is super important. At first, I thought the cream cheese mixture was too strongly flavored, but with just a thin smear of it on the bread with the cukes it was perfect.

I followed the recipe as written, except that I used a mini sliced loaf of rye bread. Everything else was perfect! They are so pretty and elegant looking on a plate.

These cucumbers were a nice touch to a birthday party i gave my daughter. Took other suggestions and mixed cream cheese and sour cream, with tablespoon of mayo. Used a package of dill flavored ranch mix from hidden valley. My husband like the spread on french baguette, I used rye as well.

I've been making this recipe for years after it was given to me by a friend. I usually substitute the small cocktail pumpernickel or rye bread that you can find by the deli dept in the grocery store. These are always a big hit especially in the summer!

Made this to the T. I made two separate batches. One with Italian and one with ranch.   The ones with ranch went before the ones with Italian, so I know how I will make these again in the future.  People really ate them up too! I used just small loaves of french bread, and it held up really well.  I assembled them about 2 hours before the party, and they were not soggy at all.  I wonder how far out they could be prepared and hold up?  I will play with it a bit to see.  I will try fresh dill in the summer time as it is so pretty.

I did not like this recipe.  I should have known better because I generally do not like recipes that require packaged ingredients (like the salad dressing mix).  It tasted overpowering.

5+++  Easy and addicting! I could not stop eating this! I served it on those mini pumpernickel bread. I did use the dry Italian salad dressing mix and would not change a thing.

These were very, very good. A very easy appetizer to make for a large gathering. Will definitely keep this recipe on hand! Also, I used english cucumbers which have fewer/more tender seeds and have less "afterburn" than a regular cucumber has. My husband liked them and he hates cucumbers!

Like the others suggested I used ranch mix. Also, I quaudrupled this recipe and didnt use quite as much mayo. I whipped up all nice and good in my lovely kitchen aid mixer...as it was 4am and i was not about to mix 4 stick of cream cheese by hand. The electril mixer made the texture of the cream cheese light and fluffy...perfect for spreading. The quadrupled amount made about 125 sandwiches.

I have yet to see anyone who doesn't love this appetizer.  I spread the mixture onto cocktail rye, top with a slice of cucumber, and sprinkle with dill.  They look wonderful on a platter and are so light and delicious.  The spread itself is great as a dip for fresh veggies, too!  Yum-yum!!!  I think I'm going to have some right now!!!

These are the perfect finger food! They are so easy to make and they taste great. Instead of french bread I by the crustless bread. It makes them look spectacular without all the extra work. Sometimes I roll them up into sprials cut them in half crosswise and dip one side in dried parsley. It gives the a dainty touch.

Ooops.......I forgot to sprinkle on the dill, but these were still FANTASTIC!  I loved the flavor of the spread. Ignore the post that said these were bland, these were incredible!  But you really do need to let the spread sit overnight, so the flavors will mingle.  Yum yum....will make these again!!

I brought this to a bridal shower and it was the first thing to go!! The mayo makes it creamier which I love. I just recommend serving it on cocktail pumpernickel bread... one inch slices seem way to thick. Otherwise, perfect as is!

I've been making this for years but this calls for too much mayonnaise.  You should only put in one heaping Tablespoon in otherwise it will be too much.  And I highly recomend using fresh dill sprigs.

I love these and make them for all of my parties.  Good quality dill weed is a MUST.  I've tried on white (French, sourdough) and dark (rye, pumpernickel) - definitely prefer the whites for this recipe, though I love dark breads.

Loved this recipe! Much better than the traditional dill dip recipe that so many use. Had leftover spread and used it on pita sandwiches the next week with deli meat and fresh crunch veggies from the garden. None went to waste!

Excellent appetizer.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used all "lite" products.  My guests loved this and so did I! Update:  I used the cream cheese mixture to make deli pinwheels (tortillas filled with cream cheese, turkey, lettuce, onions, and green peppers) and everyone loved that appetizer as well!

Delicious! I make something similar using slices of tomatoes in addition to the cukes, and use celery salt for seasoning. This is based on a sandwich I had in India, where they don't have cream cheese so they use yogurt.

Absolutely addicting! Instead of the french bread we used regular white bread, removed the crust and then cut into triangles. All of the guests could NOT stop eating them.

I made these for a girls Christmas party yesterday.  Everyone raved about them and took a copy of the recipe.  They are delicious!!!  I also used Ranch dressing as many of the others did and the Pepperidge Farm sandwich bread, the kind wrapped in white paper, cut off the crusts and into squares.  A great, refreshing change for carry ins, will definitely make again and again!!!

I have been making this recipe for YEARS.  It is a favorite!  I use 1/3 cup mayo, 8 oz cream cheese, Good Seasons Italian Dressing mix, and cocktail rye bread.  The rye bread works really well with the dill and cucumber.  You may have diffiuculty finding the cocktail rye bread, some grocery stores only carry it during Christmas.  I also use English Cumcumber (in the wrapper).  They are the perfect size for the cocktail rye bread.

This recipe was really tasty and refreshing for summer.  I didn't quite use the entire packet of italian dressing and needed another cucumber in order to use most of the dip mixture.  Very good!  Will definitely use this recipe again.

What makes this is the spread... and it doesn't just taste good with cucumbers, but all sorts of sandwiches.  I added a little bit more dill before I refrigerated it, and it was amazing.

Oh. My. These are addictive! It's so simple to make and the taste is unbelievable! I made the cream cheese mixture (including about a tsp of dried dill) a couple of days before I made the sandwiches. I also added the sprinkle of dill to each sandwich. Thanks for the great reacipe.

Yummy! I made these for a school function and everyone liked them. I was even asked for the recipe a couple of times. I made them exactly as they were  posted and they turned out perfect. Definately a keeper, thanks!

Oh, these are great! What a fantastic spread. I found fresh cream cheese (as in no preservatives) and it tasted extraordinary. I was wondering if it was really necessary to mix it with mayonnaise, but I'm glad I did because after you get rid of the lumps with some viguous stiring, it gets a lovely cream consistency. The dressing powder and dill makes it delicious. I made this just for myself for dinner, so I spread it onto some sunflower seed blackbread and added lots of cucumber slices. So good! So easy! So cheap! So fast! I'm in love.

I had to add an extra bar of cream cheese to make this edible.  It was entirely too strong with just one cream cheese bar - the Italian dressing mix  was just overpowering, but adding the extra cream cheese calmed it down a bit.

This is a terrific recipe.  You can certainly experiment with different dry dressing mixes.  We tried a garlic and herb from Good Seasons.  It is VERY garlicky, but everyone loved them on mini potato rolls and everyone wanted the recipe, so I guess it worked.  Thanks.  Would definitely make it again.

I just used regular sliced bread out of convenience.  I took it to a potluck and it was the first dish to be finished off.  If I have leftover spread I'll use it on sandwiches or crackers.  It's easier to spread when soften or room temp.

Tastes like summer!  I shredded my cucumbers and squeezed them dry.  I mixed them with light cream cheese, 1/4 cup of light mayo, Italian dressing mix, fresh dill, and the juice and zest of 1/2 of a lemon.  It makes a great spread for a whole grain baguette.  Thanks for the idea!

This recipe was very good but a little bland.  I will try adding some celery salt, lawry's salt, or just plain salt along with the dill on top of the cucumbers next time.  Also I might try marinating the cucumbers in vinegar overnight too but otherwise I got a lot of compliments and passed out the recipe to many friends.  Thanks Heather

Super fast to make especially if you have a food processor!  Literally takes like 5 minutes!  We make the spread and keep it in the fridge available for whenever we want a quick sandwich.  Just pop a cucumber in the food processor and it's all sliced in like 5 seconds and throw the sandwich together.  super fast and super delicious!

They are good but even if you cut out seeds and layer cucumbers, the white bread still gets soggy. I'll look for maybe french baguette bread next time so the whole thing stays together. I sometimes use ranch dressing mix as well.

A friend made this for my bridal shower, with one small change of using greek cream cheese, and boy were they delicious!! Everyone raved about how they were so delicious! So, I've decided to give a go at them as well. I can't wait for the next six hours to pass, so I can enjoy the yummy cucumber sandwiches!

I have been looking for a good cucumber sandwich recipe ever since I got some cucumbers from the farmers market a long while back.  The spread lasts a decent amount of time as well, but I had to half the recipe because this recipe makes a lot.  Since I was only making them for myself (my husband hates cucumbers), I made the spread and stored it.

*** My three-year-old just walked into the room and stole my sandwich! He took one bite and said, "Mmmm! Nummy!" and walked away with the rest! On man is this good! I didn't add the dill (didn't have any) and I used the bread I had on hand, but I wouldn't change the four main ingredients in any way. I was also too hungry to let it mix for six hours so I can't wait to try it again tomorrow after it's had time to set. Yum!

I loved these cucumber sandwiches but made a few changes, I added the dill weed to the cream cheese and used regular bread and once I put the cream cheese filling added the cucumber then I placed a sprig of basil on top then sandwiched them. It is a good recipe, I really wanted true english cucumber sandwiches.

Super easy and very good, just like those little tea sandwiches I had at a high end tea place in Pasadena.  I did add 2 teaspoons dried dill in the mix and didn't touch it until the next day.  I used white bread and it did taste great but cutting the soft bread was not easy without a bread knife.  Also I tried both dill and lemon pepper sprinkles on top and thought lemon pepper overpowered the taste of sandwiches.  Sprinkle bit of dill on top also looked nicer and elegant.

Very YUMMY! I am eating these right now (and getting cream cheese on the keyboard!).  Because I am a dill lover I went ahead and added 1 tsp of dried dill to the cream cheese mixture and a little pinch of dried dill on top of each cucumber as a garnish.

Next time I make this (which will be soon) I will decrease the amount of the italian seasoning packet....it is just ever so slightly too salty.  I will probably use 2/3 to 3/4 of the dressing packet.

This is one of my top 2 recipes that I love.  I let it refrigerate overnight and it is perfect, everybody loves them.  Sometimes I do sprinkle lemon pepper seasoning on top but it is just as good without it too.  Thank you for the recipe.

Delicious!  The cheese spread gets "saltier" on the 3rd or 4th day from the dressing mix, but it is delicious, easy and great with cucumbers, and I added tomatoes, too!

Oh my gosh, these are so good. I made them for a carry-in at work and they're still talking about how good they were! I would even make these just for myself to snack on, they're so good!

Making these for a baby shower, didn't have the seasoning pack so I used the lemon juice, oregano, basil, parsley, and EVOO suggested by another reviewer.  Will be using dill weed on top and I like the idea about lemon pepper for something new so I may just try that too.  I thought pumpernickel bread would add a new flavor so I am using the little squares of that.  Will update this review after the shower with the results.  Cross your fingers for me! =)

Made as written.... I used a french baguette vs. french bread with one cucumber slice on each piece.  Not only did I think they were delicious, but several people I made them for RAVED about them and asked for the recipe.  Excellent recipe, thanks!

These were very good! It makes enough for an entire loaf of regular sliced bread. The only thing I did differently was that I used Ranch seasoning instead of Italian.  I think that made it better.

Tastes sooo impressive!!! Made it for a girls weekend get together and it was the first thing to go! Heck, I ate a bunch while I was making it (quality test tasting!). This is so simple yet so tasty and might I add elegant as well! I'll definitely be making more of these, and soon!!! Love it!!!

I've made these several times (I usually use ranch powder instead of Italian) and they are always a hit with men, women, and children alike!  I slice and toast potato hot dog rolls which are a good size.

Delish. I use light cream cheese and mayo and it is still just as great! I use English Cucumbers (longer, skinnier and wrapped in plastic). They have a thinner skin and less seedy goop!

Mmmm Mmmmm DELISH!!! My daughter wanted to make a ranch cream cheese mix for them so we did both, but the Italian Dressing one turned out much tastier. my sister didn't care for dill so I made one batch with the other without and she liked the dill ones better.  So the recipe untouched is what I use now. Thanks Kimbee100!

I have made this recipe for years.  I prefer mixing 2 teaspoons of dill weed into the mixture just before serving.  I really like the flavor of the dill.  I also serve mine on French baguette slices.  Baguettes are just the right size for the cucumber!

Make early and refrigerate overnight! Only added 1/4 c sour cream to written recipe. Great on white bread squares and cocktail rye squares found in the deli section of your grocery store. Tried it with the package of dry Italian salad dressing mix and with a package of dry Hidden Valley ranch dressing. Either is great! It makes an awesome spread for a cucumber, tomato, and basil sandwich too!

These were so good! I made a batch, and you are right, it really keeps in the fridge. I thought there is no way my husband and I are going to finish the entire batch, but how wrong I was! My husband ate it every single night until it was gone. I am making again this Sunday for a BBQ we are having. I thought my husband would be sick of it by now, but he actually requested it. Oh, and it was super EASY! Thanks so much!

These sandwiches are DELICIOUS!  I served a slightly modified version as sandwich quarters, along with two other types of sandwiches, at my sister's bridal luncheon, and they were a huge hit!  I'll definitely be making them again.

Really yummy!  I make a similar appetizer using party pumpernickel bread, the whipped cream cheese with chives in it, cuke, and topped with a dash or two of onion salt which is really good, but I like this recipe better.  Next time I think I'll toast the slices of french bread (I used the French baguettes) in the oven then let them cool before adding the cream cheese, cukes and dill.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were wonderful!  I have a two suggestions, though.  Get the smallest cucumbers you can; less seeds that way.  Also, for a fun appetizer, serve on square wheat crackers.  They are beautiful!

I made this for my Mother's Day brunch, and was unsure how it would be received by the guys in the family. I should have doubled the recipe because it was a HIT!! The sandwiches were the FIRST to finish!! My mom said they reminded her of the ones she ate in England! Fantastic recipe!!

Yum! I used pita bread cut into wedges and lemon pepper seasoning instead of the dill.  I  made it in the morning so it sat in the fridge for about six hours. I recommend serving them chilled. It was the first appetizer to go at Thanksgivng.

I thought this appetizer was absolutely delicious!  I added some onion powder, seasoned salt, dill weed to the mixture (more than a pinch) and used pumpernickel bread.  Chopped some cucumber into small pieces and added to the leftover mixture and put it on bagels. Yum, Yum!!

Oooh!  This was so yummy.  I toasted the bread, but it would be great either way!  As a matter of fact... I think I'll go grab another cucumber sandwich right now!  :)

The only thing I can say about this recipe is that I am sorry that I didn't make a triple batch. These went fast! A keeper. Thank you.

These are amazing, I've been making them for years, except I make them with pumpernickle bread and occasionally I put a thin slice of deli ham on them to make them more filling. Awesome little sammie!

I made these for a baby shower and they were a hit.  I really enjoyed them.  I'll be making them again this weekend.  I used white bread because that's all I had, but they were still awesome.

Made for a picnic on a hot day.  Those who like cucumbers loved it.  Followed the recipe exactly except used low fat cream cheese and mayo on a loaf of baquette.  Light and just perfect.

Yum! We took this to a potluck and they vanished. I personally would prefer them with fresher ingredients (minced onions and garlic in the cream cheese mix, perhaps, and a less salty blend of spices?), but everyone else seemed to love these.

I followed the directions as they were written.  I think these were just okay.  They had a very simple taste, which is good if you like that, but I like my food to be a bit more complex.  Not sure if I'll make these again.

Delicous! Definitely cut back on the italian seasoning - taste as you go. And fresh dill makes it work. Note - several reviews said they tasted even better the next day. Therefore I wasn't concerned with making extra for dinner. We had then on rye bread, not toasted. The leftovers were not nearly as good. I'm sure letting the cream cheese mixture sit on its own is good, just not fully assembled.

Sophisticated yet easy! I used plain white bread and made tea sandwiches, but open faced as above looks pretty too. Next time will try a ranch dressing packet.

I followed recipe exactly using Good Seasons brand Italian salad dressing mix and chilled overnight. The cream cheese mixture was too salty; mostly likely due to the Italian salad dressing mix. In my case, I don't think the favor developed more overnight. I tried to make it more palatable by adding dried crush mint leaves and an extra ounce of cream cheese. This helped. I like the minty kick too.  I think I'll try again using ranch mix and sour cream instead of mayo next time like so many others have done.

Very good, made for my moms group "tea party" and they were a hit.  Just used regular white bread and cut off the crusts to make mini tea sandwiches.  Had a bunch of the filling left over and my husband used it as a dip on crackers.  Will definately make again for my next girly party, or maybe duirng the summer with all the cukes from my garden

This is such a lovely and delicious standby!  Also, for Christmas try adding half of a grape tomato on half of the sandwiches.  This added to the green of the cucumbers makes such a festive display on a serving table.

Really good! Make sure the bread is fresh. I only mixed with a fork but I will mix with a blender next time. I think it will make a difference. I will also make a sandwich with regular bread for anytime during the week for the kids and stuff.

These are good.  I used regular bread with the crusts cut off and sliced into four pieces, spreading the dip on the bread and placing a cucumber slice on top.  I also added the dill to the dip.  They are addicting!

I think that this is the best summer snack there is. It's very refreshing! My mom has always made these with pumpernickel rye cocktail bread, so I did the same. Other than that, I pretty much followed the recipe. YUM!

Very yummy! I added the Italian Dressing Mix (from this site) to taste as suggested and tossed in some extra dill with the mayo. Since this is made to taste, it's great for using up extra cream cheese, seasoning, etc. I cut whole grain white bread slices into 4 small squares each after removing the crust. I let the cheese set in the fridge for a few hours, and then spread the firmed up mix onto the peeled cucumber slices and set it cheese side down on a piece of bread, no top needed. So good! Thank you for the recipe!

These are outstanding - the only recipe I will ever use!  I use low fat mayo & reduced fat cream cheese, and it does not affect the taste at all!  PERFECT cuc sandwich for a baby or wedding shower!!

With the exception of using fresh dill instead of dried, I made the spread exactly as written.  It is wonderfully creamy and delicious.  I used it on cocktail pumpernickel bread and added smoked salmon slices. Along with cantaloupe soup, it makes a satisfying yet light summer lunch.

easy to store, easy to make and easy to carry. Taste great and light for a ladies luncheon. Will keep and make again and again. I did make them on white bread with the crust removed cut in half for more of a finger sandwich and used ranch instead of italian dressing but next time I will make then as posted. Thanks, Rebecca

I have been asked to make these over and over. I made them for many partys! I always make them the night before and store it in an air tight container, it softens the rye cocktail bread. I mix sour cream instead of mayo, and use hidden valley ranch dip. I sprinkle dried dill weed on the top for garnish.

These were so simple to make and absolutely delicious!  I did take the advice of some other reviews and cut down on the amount of Italian seasoning.  Glad I did that...that stuff is potent!  I also whipped up a batch using dried ranch mix...it was even better than the Italian...IMHO!  It's also yummy on a toasted bagel!

I'm not quite sure what to rate this because I made many changes to the recipe, but I was very happy with the turn out.  Rather than using a salad dressing mix, I bought plain cream cheese and mixed it with oregano, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, pepper, and a bit of salt.  I put everything in the fridge overnight so that the herbs would settle in.  I also added olive oil so that the cheese was creamy.  The day of our party, I spread the cheese on plain white bread and added a few thin cucumber slices. I cut them into quarters and stuck a toothpick in each one.  They were very good and very easy to make!  As an added plus, you can make these ahead of time as well (at least a few hours ahead of time, not sure about making them a day in advance).  Great recipe for an appetizer or finger food.  Thanks!

I loved this recipe, I did tweak it a bit. I reduced the mayo to 1/4 cup and used whipped cream cheese instead. I put it on good white bread and cut the crusts off. I usually quarter them and serve them as brunch or as a light lunch.

This is my go-to appetizer and it always gets reve reviews.  I use the zesty itallian dressing mix and only 2 tbs of mayo.  I've also tried with thin slices of red bell pepper and that was good too.

These little sandwiches were perfect!  I was looking for a fun way to use summer cucs for a party I had, and this was just perfect.  I used baguettes and one cuc slice/bread slice was a nice ratio.  The dill is the icing on the cake.

Made this for a baby shower and there wasn't one person who didn't ask, "Who made the cucumber sandwiches?" I used a zester to make pretty stripes on the cucumber skin and sliced them with a wavy knife (they were ripple cut). The presentation of the cucumbers made all the difference, but the recipe was the BEST!

I made these for my daughter's H.S. graduation party, and they were such a hit!! I had to make more because we ran out! It's such an easy recipe, and the flavor is to die for. To make sure that the cream cheese mixture wasn't too salty, I used the Italian dressing a little at a time, and ended up using only half of it, but this is a great, quick appetizer that is quite healthy if you use fat free or reduced fat ingredients. I used fat free and the flavor was amazing!

Very delicious!  Wanted something light for lunch today, and it's very good.  Only problem is that now I've eaten probably too many sandwiches to make it a light lunch!  It's also a good thing that it keeps well, as I have a lot left over.  I might put dill in the cream cheese mixture next time, but it's excellent as is.  I am not a fan of mayo at all but it is a good mixture in this spread.

I have this exact same recipe and to anyone who said it didn't taste good -then you made it wrong.  I use the refrigerated bread dough (in the can), I cut each bread slice very thin, and leave the crusts on. There are never any leftovers.  I might try a french baguette next time.

I LOVED THIS. I used the ranch dressing packet and mayo in mine. But like everyone says, the dill is what makes this. I used some cool fancy crackers for mine and served as hourdourves. I will keep this ready to serve at all times during the summer.

I must have bought the wrong type of french bread, because it didnt cut thin enough or work well with the texture of the sandwich, so I mearly used white bread and they turned out great!  I had some leftover spread that was really good alone on the unused french bread too :)

WONDERFUL!

The spread takes the cake, in this recipe. Infact, it tastes like an expensive spread I used to buy to put on garlic toasted bagle bites from a small bakery years ago; they advertised it as a veggie spread and it cost $6 a pound!! YIKES! This is almost identical and tastes great on sandwiches and crackers alike (even without the cucumbers!)

Thanks!

I used this spread for cucumber sandwiches for my 4 year old's birthday tea party, and they were a big hit!!  I spread the cheese mixture on 2 slices of bread, topped 1 with sliced cucumbers, sprinkled on some dill, and topped with 2nd slice.  Cut off crusts and cut into triangles -- even my husband loved them!  Thank you!

Great!  I cut some cuke slices in half to make them fit better.  Also, cut bread into thinner slices (1/2").  Took them to work and everyone had a fit over them.  Even someone who didn't like cucumbers.  Should have made twice as many!

Excellent recipe!  I have made it several times so far.  The best thing is that you can change the bread to whatever you want each time you make it.

I took these sandwiches to my sisters bridal shower and they were a hit. I used pumpernickel bread instead of french and it was delicious too. I would definitely recommend these to anyone.

Very light and refreshing canape & very easy to make. I skipped the bread for my carb-conscious friends at a recent party. I think they're even better this way.

These were a big hit with the bridesmades at my friend's wedding.  Once we finished with them, the boys took them over as well!  The crisp, watery cucumber really balances out the creaminess of the cheese and the saltiness of the dressing mix.

These are always well-received whenever I serve them.  I usually use cocktail rye or pumpernickel and sometimes I sub in dry Ranch dressing mix for the Italian which tastes really good too.

I was in a hurry and spread cream cheese on BREMNER WAFER crackers, salt, cucumber slice, then dill.  The cracker is the same size as a cucumber slice and tastes like bread.

Delicious as-is. I added the dried dill (maybe doubled it) to the spread for ease and consistency. Slice English cukes thin. Used take-and-bake baguette. Just the right piece of bread. Big hit at cocktail party.

I made it for a bridal shower. I think every person who came asked me for the recipe. It was very refreshing to eat. And very pretty. I made it with the ranch seasoning mix (cause I like the taste of ranch dressing than Italian dressing) and also used some sour cream. Presented it on French baguette open faced. Added dill, salt and pepper on top of the cucumbers. My goodness, I would definitely make it again

Huge hit at Christmas! I used a loaf of everything bread I found at Walmart and layered cucumbers with radishes on top of the spread (no changes to the recipe at all). Sprinkled the top with dill. Not only were they very pretty and festive, I had to make more! For the procrastinators out there, I didn’t let my dip rest for 6 hours or overnight. I whipped up the dip about 2 hours before the party and assembled them when I got there. Flavors were still great, so do t feel like you’ll ruin the recipe if you’re short on time!

So good! I love the italian dressing powder! I couldn't resist adding a little dill to the spread though. Really easy to assemble and the recipe makes a lot of the spread, so I am going to use it for multiple meals. This picture is of the last one I made for breakfast because I ate all the others.

I made per receipt. I used a packet of Hidden Valley Buttermilk Ranch. I mixed the soften cream cheese and ranch packet together and let chill overnight in the fridge. The flavor is VERY strong. Only use a small amount of the mixture to lightly cover the piece of bread (I used white wheat bread with the crust removed). Using more than a small amount of the cheese mixture WILL overpower the cucumber. I sliced 4 edges of the cucumbers to add a decorative element and remove some of the skin. I thinly sliced the cucumber and chopped fresh dill to top them with. Overall, I loved this recipe and will make again!

I also added Parmesan cheese and fresh ground pepper. I also opted to cut the cucumbers and mix it into the mixture. 
I also used regular bread. Delish!

I made these for two different functions this week - just as the recipe instructs - and they went over great!  I used angle cut baguettes the first time and sliced French bread the second. 

For my own personal taste, I would probably do a little less Italian seasoning, but the recipe is very good, just as it is.

This is definitely a "keeper" just right for a Summer day. 
I used dark rye bread instead of french bread, which gave a nice color contrast.

Used ranch mix. Added 1 tsp dill. Buttered the bread and dusted with garlic powder and then toasted under the broiler. Let bread cool and then assemble. I also peeled the cucumbers. This is my new favorite appetizer. Amazing!!

Wonderful summer appetizer or side! Just think ahead one day for the cream cheese/mayo/salad dressing to marry. Couldn’t be easier to make ...you might squeeze a just bit of lemon for some acidity at the end.

3.28.18  This was lunch with a cup of soup.  Not sure why I didn’t think of doing this, but I think these would be much better with lightly toasted baguettes, and I will do that in the future.   Used an English cuke, fresh and crunchy good.

I made these using the block of cream cheese and about 1/4 cup of hidden valley ranch bottled salad dressing and about a half teaspoon dried dill mixed up and refrigerated. I spread on toasted onion bagels, although the party rye would be very good, as well as flour tortillas, I think. The filling and cucumbers along with onion slices are very good in Pita bread. Then I added thin sliced cucumbers, fresh dill and black pepper on top. Yum!

Made this for a church lunch and it was a favorite.

Made some changes to the recipe, though. First, I used the garlic and herb dressing mix because it doesn't contain MSG, used fresh dill for the top and used some mashed avocado for the other side of the sandwich on some of them. They were so yummy that I'm using up the spread to make more all week.

I've tried a few recipes and this is both the best and easiest. The italian dressing pack provides a great flavor I haven't been able to capture without. I initially chilled the mixture for only an hour and it was still pretty good. I used up the rest a full day later and I can say that it only improved a little bit with the longer chilling time. When I tried a bit without any cooling it wasn't nearly as good though. So if you want them today, you can get away with just and hour in the fridge.

Some people said the italian dressing mix is too much. I added a 0.6 oz packet (not 0.7 oz as the recipe says) and it provided a strong flavor. I love it, but if you are sensitive to powerful flavors I could easily see it being too much. Overall, this is going to be my go to recipe for cucumber sandwiches.

I made this for a Valentine Brunch at my workplace. I did two versions; one with Italian dressing and one with Ranch dressing. I also added sour cream into the mixture after reading some reviews. I served it in a "make your own" style. Instead of the sprig of dill, I substituted dill weed seasoning for individual use. My coworkers absolutely loved it! Everyone was asking for the recipe! I will be making this again!

Delicious!  I made them tea party style for 12 people and everyone loved them.  Based on some reviews, I added about 3/4 package of seasoning rather than the whole package.  Everyone agreed that it was delicious as is but would probably be better with the whole package.

These are a little time consuming to make them all pretty, but well worth the effort. They are delicious, and very nice to look at. Wonderful for hot summer days as a light appetizer, or in the winter to remind you that it will be warm again.

This was a big hit at a dinner party that I brought these to.  I received many compliments from guests and several asked for the recipe. I made this using crostini (thinly sliced, toasted french baguette) seasoned with a bit of olive oil, salt and pepper.  Based on other reviews that the Italian dressing seasoning was too strong, I used about 3/4 packet. I determined how much to use by tasting and adding seasoning until I thought the flavor was right. I also added fresh dill to the cream cheese mixture in addition to a sprig on top. Finally, I used a "seedless" English cucumber, which was the perfect size for the crostini.  This is a very refreshing appetizer and will be a go to for future gatherings.

I used this cream cheese mixture on bread rounds and it looked and tasted very nice.  I had some cream cheese leftover so I cut a few cucumbers in half lengthwise, hollowed out the centres by removing the seeds with a spoon, and stuffed with this cream cheese mixture ... very refreshing.  It would probably be good in celery too.  Thanks for sharing!

I didn't have enough mayonnaise, so I substituted half of it with sour cream, let it sit overnight and the spread turned out great! This is definitely best with a really soft bread.

I love easy recipes that taste good too!  We have a garden full of cucumbers and I had no idea what to do with them.  I have always heard of cucumber sandwiches so I thought I'd give it a try.  My only suggestion is to cut them into quarters, it makes it easier to eat but still looks nice.

I used this recipe for a tea party. They came out great and were more flavorful that the usual cucumber cream cheese sandwich. I also made some sandwiches with non-dairy cream cheese for casein-allergic-friend and they also were very tasty (which is saying something because I don't typically like non-dairy cream cheese).

This was amazingly easy and amazingly good.  I made these for an office lunch and everyone loved them!  I followed to a T except for the dill weed, which I completely forgot to add at the end.  Also, I spread the mixture on two slices of white bread and made more a "sandwich", then I cut off the crusts and cut diagonally.  Thank you for a great, easy recipe!

So yummy!! I made these to test them out before making them for a bridal shower and they are so good I can't stop eating them!  I did my own version of America's Test Kitchen and had my boyfriend try out each one and tell me his favorite.  I served it on a sliced french baguette.  Toasting it before putting on the spread made it so much more delicious, also using fresh dill was way better.  I can't wait to share this at the shower!

This is so simple but SO good. I made this on the fly when we had some company so it wasn't able to sit but it was still awesome! Of course the next day it was even better! With the left overs, I made more of a veggie sandwich with cucumbers and tomatoes from my garden with a little red onion - so yummy! The spread is very versatile.

I made this for my husband one night and he told me he could eat one of these sandwiches every day of his life. So simple and yummy! Note: I added extra dill, sub'd a little bit of ranch dressing for the italian and put it on Country Potato White Bread. Do plan to try it with French though next time.

Absolutely delicious. I used sour cream instead of mayo but I'm sure both would be just as good. Do not forget the dill week on top.. makes all the difference! YUMMM! thanks kimbee!

These were DELICIOUS! My boyfriend is not a huge cucumber lover but he ate these right up. The dill on top is a must, makes it very pretty too. Instead of original Italian mix I used zesty Italian for a nice little kick. I will definitely use again for a party (made for bridal shower) or get together in the future.

I have made these sandwiches several times for baby showers, teas, etc and they are always a hit! The only change that I make is to make them as actual little sandwiches rather than open faced.  Fabulous recipe to have!

The taste was nice - I ended up using pumpernickel cocktail bread which was a bit disappointing. I maybe would have been able to give them a 5 if I had liked the bread better... I understand that's no one else's fault but my own. lol. Great jumping off point...

these are amazing! i had lots of compliments :) the only thing i did differently was using a little less mayo...maybe half that amount. i've also made these with spinach wraps instead of on a baguette and they are great like that too!

This recipe is amazing!!  I added a bit of cayenne, garlic powder and onion powder for my own personal preference.  I took this for a luncheon at work and the girls were very impressed!  We added a few fresh tomatos and a sprinkle of colby/jack cheese.  It is now a frequent request at work!

Delish! I used the Dry Ranch Seasoning recipe from this site. Very tasty, the mayo really added alot of flavor and smoothed the texture. I added romaine lettice on toasted white bread. I sliced the cucumber into superthin ribbons. YUM!

Delicious!!!! I used plain toasted bagel chips instead of bread.  I also bought fresh dill (less expensive). My coworkers gobbled everything down to the last drop.  I will definitely make this again.

These were fantastic.  I made 2 mistakes, though.  What a forgiving recipe!  Thought I had the Italian herbs at home but didn't and didn't substitute anything for them.  Also didn't have time to let the spread sit overnight...it had only 1-2 hours.  I bought fresh dill and chopped it all up and mixed it in.  At first, it tasted really mayonnaise-y but all put together, it was addictive.  I served them at an 8-year-old's tea party and every kid and adult devoured them!  MMM!  I think I'll make them this way again.  The fresh dill made them.

Super easy and a big hit.  I would highly recommend this for showers.  Everyone loved them and they, honestly, took about 15 minutes.  Just make sure to let the cream cheese mixture set in the fridge so the flavor develops to its full potential.  I will make these often!

This a great appetizer, and it's so easy!  I would not make too far in advance...the cucumbers can get a little soggy.  I made mine a couple hours before a baby shower, and they were perfect.  I got many complements, and the entire tray was almost gone.

These are the best.  I make them for parties and everyone loves them and there are never any left.  I follow the recipe except use McCormick's Salad Supreme sprinkled on top instead of dill.  Tastes great.

We mix ranch and cream cheese instead of the mayo/italian dressing.  We also peel the cucumbers because it can be a little difficult to eat if you don't.  We cut them into about 1 1/2 in. finger sandwiches (because that's how we had them the first time in England!) and they're just so easy! Wonderful with tea!

I had a high tea for a bridial shower.  I served several tea sandwiches, but this was the big hit.  I later served them on a summer night with chilled soup.  A definite hit with my family.

We recently had a tea party with the young women and their mothers in church.  I tried this recipe out there and it was a huge hit.  Very yummy, very easy, and I would recommend it for anything from baby showers to wedding appatizers.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

very good recipe. I redid the recipe to make 50 croissant sandwiches for a wedding reception that I was catering and they were a huge hit. I did sub the garlic and herb dressing mix for the Italian and it turned out great.

Way too salty! If I try this recipe again, I'll use 1/2 a packet of the italian dressing mix....or add a little at a time to taste. I'm serving this tomorrow at a baby shower anyway--hope the guests do not agree with my opinion.

I threw a baby shower tea party and these sandwiches were just perfect.  Everyone seemed to enjoy them.  I made these as actual sandwiches - slicing the bread to about 1/2".  I have also made them as the recipe states and by toasting the French bread before adding the toppings - both are delicious.  These are a great after-school snack too.

This recipe is EASY and very very yummy!  I made over 100 for a baby shower and also my husbands open house for his business and was asked over 10 times for the recipe.  The italian dressing makes it different & VERY tasty!

These were really good! Everyone really liked them. I kind of felt like they were a little strong, I think I would add more cream cheese next time. But, that's just me. They were excellent!

This is tough because my husband and guests LOVED it, but I absolutely did not care for this at all.  So, I guess it's a complete toss-up.

Myself and a friend made these for a bridal shower.  We put together the cream cheese mixture the night before, and then assembled the sandwiches the morning of.  They were really good, but a word of warning...don't make too many extra, because they DO NOT hold up as leftovers.  Thanks for the recipe! :-)

On Weight Watchers this works well using fat-free cream cheese and mayo with a high fiber bread.  The spread works out to be 1 points plus value for 2 Tbsp.

This recipe is awesome! I didn't have the bread on hand, but I did put them on some triscuits, spread the dip on and topped with a cucumber and served them as appetizers and they went quick! Everyone asked me for the recipe! I will definitely use this again and again! Thank You!

Making this for the second time. Everyone loves it- even people who don't like the ingredients by themselves. Great for parties, takes next to no time to make, and everyone thinks I am a culinary genius!
