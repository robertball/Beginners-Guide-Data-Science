I added more than double the amount of hot sauce the recipe called for but it still tasted more like spicy marinara sauce than buffalo chicken. It also took deceptively long to prepare as I had to cook and dice the chicken, chop the veggies, etc. before I could start assembling. Overall, the dish was pretty good but tasted nothing like buffalo cheesy chicken.

Family I nanny for LOVED it!  Not spicy at all, but you can def. taste the hot sauce!  Great flavor, but if I were just making it for my husband and I, I would definately use more hot sauce!

Great recipe.  When assembling, I thought the sauce mixture was a little too dry, so I added another 1/2 cup of spaghetti sauce, not realizing until AFTER I baked and served it, that I'd forgotten the water in the ingredients!  It was fine without it, just took an additional 20 minutes baking to soften the noodles enough.  Two things I would recommend are: add a little more hot sauce, probably about a teaspoon, for a little more kick, and drizzle a blue cheese salad dressing on top instead of using the crumbled blue cheese.  I also used drained canned chicken instead of the cooked and diced chicken breast.  This was really good!

Very good, but definitely needs more buffalo sauce.  I was adding it to taste and ended up putting 5 tablespoons.  I also did not add the vinegar and boiled the noodles before layering the lasagna.  Turned out delicious!

This was pretty darn good!  My only issue was that my noodles were a little overchewy the night I made it.  Problem is (as is always with lasagna) they were perfect the next day so perhaps I should just let it sit longer!

We liked the idea of this lasagna, but it didn't turn out as well as we were expecting.  First, it was kind of watery/runny.  Second, the chicken should probably be shredded instead of chunked.  Third, the hot sauce + marinara just didn't quite = buffalo sauce.

I used ground chicken and 5 TB of hot sauce. I omitted the mushrooms. These were good changes, next time I will omit the bell pepper and instead run my onion, 1 carrot, and 2 stalks of celery through a food processor. My favorite tomato sauce recipe calls for doing this, and bell pepper isn't our favorite, so just a little switcheroo to keep the vitamins but lose the distinctive flavors that we don't care for. All in all, a very tasty recipe, thanks!

Excellent way to use leftover chicken definitely double the hot sauce if you are using the standard buffalo sauce that starts with an "F".

This recipe is okay...  We love buffalo chicken in our home, so I thought I'd give it a try.  Like many other reviewers said, the recipe doesn't call for enough hot sauce.  I used buffalo sauce, and put in double what it called for, but my kids still said that they couldn't taste the buffalo sauce.  Also, kinda strange to mix lasagna and buffalo chicken.

Very good!  I saute the veggies first along with celery.  I also add a jar of alfredo sauce.  And more hot sauce.

This recipe is great! Definitely different for me but great. I doubled up on the hot sauce but other than that I followed the recipe exactly as it is. You have the garlic and onion in there to complete the flavor. It was amazing. Not for those who don't like hot stuff because it does have a little kick, but I guess that depends on the sauce you use. Excellent dish. Will be making it again for sure!

I was very excited to try this recipe but it kinda was a let down. First of all it was very labor intensive. I might try canned chicken or precooked frozen chicken. It really over all was not a buffalo chicken flavor. Probably gwon't make this again.
