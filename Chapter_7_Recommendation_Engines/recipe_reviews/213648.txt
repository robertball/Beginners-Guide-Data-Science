As I was looking for a recipe for the boneless/skinless breasts I had thawed out my roomie took it upon himself to season the chicken with Sea Salt Black Peppercorns (crushed) and Paprika. I caught him just as he was pouring melted butter over it all. So ok I let the chicken cook in the oven as recipe specifies for 30 mins. Took the buttery goodness from the chicken pan and poured it into a 9x13. Laid the mostly defrosted asparagus spears (I used frozen so omitted the cook time) on the bottom of pan placed chicken breasts on top and went to make the cream soup/milk mixture. I had cream of celery and no milk so I used water instead. Poured it over the chicken/asparagus. Sprinkled the Italian Seasoned bread crumbs a little generously. The result very tasty! But much to liquidy. Definitely need to use the milk or if using water I'd say cut it in half....Thanks for the recipe. It worked out in the end:-)

This is a great recipe! I'll make it again and again. I only used one can of soup (Cream of Celery) and 3/4 cup of milk and added 2 Tbsp. of Mayo and 1/4 tsp. of fresh ground pepper. Delicious!

Simple and delicious. I will definitely be making this again. (I made exactly as is except adding grated Parmesan and Romano cheese on the top before serving.)

This was awesome! I seasoned the chicken with poultry seasoning garlic and pepper. I only had 1 can of Cream of Asparagus so I used a can of Cream of Wild Mushroom and mixed it together. I steamed some mushrooms in with the asparagus as well to bring the flavours together. A bit of constructive criticism: The chicken had to be cooked a bit longer (about 45 min) and the sauce was a bit runny I'll use less milk next time.

I made the recipe as written except that I made my own asparagus base instead of using the can soup and I added monterey jack cheese on top of the bread crumbs. I don't know what this needs but it definitely needs some seasoning of some kind. I'm glad I made this early before my husband comes home so that I can work with the flavor. It was OK the asparagus soup I made out of the leftover base was much better. Reminds me of the rich mans tuna casserole using chicken and asparagus instead of tuna and peas.

Made this dish for Supper last night. Only used 1 can of the soup but added 8oz. of Tostitoes Creamy Spinach Dip. Increased milk to 2 cups. Added about 1 pint of fresh saut√©ed mushrooms in Butter with Garlic on top of the chicken and sauce before the sprinkled Bread Crumbs. Turned out just Awesome especially for someone who isn't really fond of Asparagus!

I made this tonight with what I had... Used cream of chicken soup and panko breadcrumbs instead also I peppered the chicken... Glad I did would have been too bland without. I would suggest not cooking the chicken as long... Cut the cook time down to 20 minutes each session. I might try it again I might not.
