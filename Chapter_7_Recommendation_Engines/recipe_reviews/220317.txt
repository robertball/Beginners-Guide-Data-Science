I cut the recipe but didn't change anything except using buttermilk instead of milk.  I thought the end result was too bready and the uncut asparagus spears were hard to deal with.  If I were to make this again I would cut the asparagus into bite sized pieces and cut down on the Bisquick layer.  I don't think I'll make it again though.

I did not make this exact. A lot of the reviews said the recipe was to bready so I made it with half the batter on the bottom. I used asparagus ham and the other ingredients listed then made it like a quiche on the top.  It was absolutely delicious and my company loved it.

Agree with other comments. Too bready and dry. I even used extra milk. Won't try again.

It is a lot of breading.  Not sure how I would fix that.  Not sure if I'll try it again or not.
