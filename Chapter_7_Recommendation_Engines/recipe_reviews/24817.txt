Wonderful dressing! It's definitely creamy with just the right amount of spice which gives it a little "kick".  I cut the recipe in half and lightened it up a little by using Hellman's light mayo and reduced fat sour cream.  I also replaced the heavy cream with half and half.  This was just what I need for "Reuben Rollups" from this site!

Very nice dressing!  Light, well-balanced flavors that enhanced the salad greens rather than overpowered them. And couldn't be simpler or quicker to make. Hubs requested a creamy salad dressing at kind of the last minute so I didn't have time to let it chill long for the flavors to meld, but it didn't really seem to make a difference.  I used a little less onion than called for, but as it turned out  that probably wasn't necessary. I'm sure I'll make this again - and won't change a thing.

Russian dressing was always my favorite as a kid and this brought back a lot of memories being that I haven't had it in forever. I used fat free sour cream but full fat mayo and because I felt it needed a tad of sweetness, I added pickle relish to the mix. So good over plain old iceberg lettuce. Thank You!

I've don't think I have ever had russian dressing and this was very tasty!!  I scaled the recipe back to 4 servings and decided to use dried parsley instead of fresh (as to try and get the kids to eat it).  It definitely needs the fresh.  It has taste similar to thousand island dressing but this recipe has a milder flavor.  Even with scaling the recipe back to 4 servings...it could easily be 5-7 servings.

Good, old fashion Russian dressing.  Like others, I added some sweet pickel relish and I used shrimp sauce vs catsup.
A real comfort food.

The perfect addition to my reuben sandwich.  I added more horseraddish and hot sauce, so tasty.

I am not a huge onion fan so recommend using a sweet onion or leaving it out.  I also left out the hot sauce.  With those 2 changes, I thought this turned out to be a good recipe.  I've made a couple times and hubby and I enjoy.

Sorry, but I did not care for this at all. I found the flavour of the mayo a bit overpowering. I thought I would also like the mayo/ketchup flavour, but I didn't care for it at all.

this is by far the best Russian dressing I ever had. the grated onion gives it the right zip. My man can't get enough of this.

Very tasty, and one of the better dressings I think I've made, though I did follow others suggestions with a bit of relish and a pinch of sugar - which probably turned it into Thousand Island!

loved this on an iceberg lettuce wedge with shaved carrots and tomato also.   I subbed lite sour cream and mayo.  Would be fantastic on a reuben too.  Very fresh and tangy.

I made this to make a reuben casserole; as I am not real familiar with Russian dressings, I thought this was very good - sweet, tart, creamy- without being overpowering.  I made this as written, except used non-fat half and half instead of the cream.  Added to the collection.

Great recipe!  I love that I don't have to use a powder mix to make this dressing.  I had a few changes just because I didn't have some things.  I didn't add grated onion because I didn't think I would like the texture of that and I was already going to be putting onion on my salad.  I didn't have Worcestershire sauce so I just subbed a little soy sauce.  And no heavy cream so I just used regular cream.  And just used some dried parsley that I had on hand.  Tasted great!  And I will be making this again!

I made this tonight to mix into a bowtie pasta & chicken salad. I added a big tablespoon of sweet relish and a splash of barbeque sauce to give it a little zing. I didn't have any dried mustard so I just squirted in some regular mustard and it was awesome. My dad wanted traditional macaroni salad tonight, but I upped the ante and made this salad and it got rave reviews. A definite summer hit!

I wanted to make the Tasty Tender Pork Tenderloin recipe from this site, and I had about 3 Tbs of Catalina dressing in my fridge. I made a small batch of the Russian Style Creamy Salad Dressing, mixed in my little bit of Catalina dressing and it was a hit! I lessened the amounts because I didn't need a whole lot. I didn't have heavy cream or fresh parsley on hand, and it was still great without it. Mix this dressing with the Tasty Tender Pork Tenderloin recipe, and you have got yourself an excellent dinner! You gotta try it.

I needed a Russian Style salad dressing in order to make the Cranberry Sauce Chicken II from AR.  As this is not available in South Africa, I made this recipe.  It is absolutely fantastic!  My husband and I agreed that it would also be great for a prawn cocktail, and luckily I had doubled the recipe when making it.  All we added for the prawn cocktail, was more hot sauce.  I used Tobasco, and perhaps at least half a teaspoon for the double recipe.  Could still have added more, but we just loved our prawn cocktails!  Will definitely be making this again and again in future.

This is an EXCELLENT Russian dressing...just like the one my mother used to make.  My wife and I spice it up by adding fresh ground horseradish, Tobasco sauce and Italian Raffaelli "Aglio, Preszzemolo & Peperoncino" canned spice that I buy during my business trips to Rome.  We use it on salad and as a sandwich spread.  It would be equally great as a dip.  Really quite good!

Great taste!  To think I can make a delicious dressing like this!! Used about half shrimp cocktail sauce and half catchup in the recipe. Gave nice kick to this yummy salad dressing. ??

Very tasty and very close to the real stuff. If I could I would have given it 4.5 stars. I am nit- picking here, but it’s missing 2 ingredients that would make it “real” Russian dressing, both of which are not fun to work with.  Fresh horseradish and caviar.  The caviar is not really optional because without it you have French dressing with a kick.

Scaled it to 4 servings.  Loved this recipe.  Did add grated horseradish, cracked black pepper, and fresh chopped dill. It was fabulous as written.  Just added some personal preferences. Used on pastrami reubens.  Delish!

Very good! I had never tasted a Russian style dressing before but wanted to make a pork tenderloin recipe from this site that called for it. After looking at the bottles of Kraft Russian dressing I decided to make my own (they looked too much like ketchup). This is delicious!

Thought this had a really good balanced flavor as written.  Didn't have cream and was out of milk, so I used about powdered milk and water.  Didn't notice anything missing from flavor, consistency, or texture.  Can imagine the flavor will be even better tomorrow.  Thanks for such a quick, basic, easy recipe.

We had this last night and it was completely delicious.  I can't think of a single thing I would change.  (However, in the interest of full disclosure, I left out the heavy cream.  It was still very creamy).

This recipe makes a really good dressing. I didn't have parsley on hand, so this was left out. I imagine the addition of parsley would only make it better. Thanks for the recipe! Yum.

Excellent!  Didn't think I could make a dressing that tasted this good.  I made roasted turkey heros with shredded lettuce, tomato and onions, and this delicious dressing.  Everybody loved it.

I've tried a couple of different recipes for russian dressing and this one is the best! My only modification was to sub prepared horseradish for the grated onion b.c of a personal textural preference. It was delicious right out of the gate on my turkey sandwich and am anticipating that it will improve with a few hours in the fridge.
