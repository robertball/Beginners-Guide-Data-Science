I thought this was good.  I did find the rice still uncooked after 5 mins.  I think increasing the milk to 1 1/8 cups and letting sit for 10 mins would make it better.  Add a dash of cinnamon and whipped cream and it can satisfy any craving!

I use a recipe like this and I like it because I can use fat-free, sugar-free pudding and still have rice pudding on a diet. I like to use the cook and serve vanilla pudding mix.

This was very good for as quick and easy as it was- only change I made was that I added a tsp of vanilla and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. For a quick version, this works out very well.

I gave this 4 stars before because I missed the part of the recipe where you cover the rice to let it steam! I'm sure it would be much better if you did, so don't forget to read those directions carefully! This has a great flavor, I used golden raisins.

Pretty good if served warm.  Once stored covered in refrigerator overnight, the rice hardens up and is tough to chew. The cooked rice itself was perfect before making the pudding so that would not have been the problem.  I will stay with the baked rice puddings and not make this recipe again.

It tasted like minute rice with some milk.  I can't even think of any suggestions except to either buy rice pudding or make the real thing.

This was pretty good for a quick instant rice pudding. Prepared as directed though, the rice does not cook. I put it back on to low for 2 minutes, then let it sit off the heat for 5, which still left it a bit 'crunchy'. Next time, instead of removing from the heat immediately, I will leave it on low for 5 and then remove to sit for 5. We topped with whip cream and a sprinkle of nutmeg. It was better the next day as it thickened up and was tastier cold.

Fast and easy dessert.  The rice was a bit undercooked, but overall taste was good.  I served warm with cinnamon sprinkled on top.

My instant rice came out a bit under cooked. I will do what the other reviewer suggested and add 1/8 cup and leave it for 10 minutes. The taste very good though.
