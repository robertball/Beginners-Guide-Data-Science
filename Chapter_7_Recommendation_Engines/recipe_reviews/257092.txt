Excellent recipe. The timing was perfect. At 13 minutes the potatoes were crispy outside and soft inside. I left the skins on. I had to use yukon gold potatoes. Thank you for the recipe.

I have a rack air fryer and attempted the same instructions as for a basket air fryer.  They ended up burnt and/or raw.  I will try again adjusting the heat.  It is worth a try for anyone who has an air fryer.  I just love mine.  Use it more for steaks, ribs, and fish than anything else.

Very good but you have to watch them closely, they can over fry in seconds

Make sure you have a large spiral maker. I have the white as seen on tv one. Did the large but turned out like hash browns stuck together. Cooked half the time stated. Tasty but not curly.

This recipe is easy and delicious. I used the smallest setting on the spiralizer and they came out great.  I also subbed olive oil.

Love it!! Mine were ready in 7 minutes but that's because my spiralizer does not have options re size. Very tasty but very addictive. Great recipe, thanks for sharing.
