I made this recipe was a side dish for Thanksgiving dinner, it was incredible!  The taste of the walnuts with the green beans was very unique, my family really liked it, I didn't have walnut oil, so I just added olive oil, and I also added 3 cloves of fresh garlic - that I toasted with the butter just before serving.  A definite keeper, excellent side dish for any dinner!  No more boring beans!

Don't let the simplicity of this recipe fool you! These beans are awesome, both in taste and presentation. The walnut oil adds a subtle nuttiness and, if at all possible, should not be substituted. The toasted walnuts also contribute great flavor and at the same time dress the beans up visually. Perfect.

This was Wonderful! I did not have walnut oil so I just used Extra Virgin Olive oil. I also used about a tablespoon of minced garlic since my family doesn't like anything without garlic. It was a hit even though most of my family doesn't like vegetables. Thanks!

Oh my goodness, I had no idea green beans could be so delicious!  I didn't have any walnut oil, so instead I used olive oil as other reviewers suggested, plus I only used one-half the butter that was called for.  I also added 2 cloves of garlic that I minced and sautéed in the hot oil before adding the beans.  This dish was so tasty and flavorful; I will definitely be making it again!

I threw this together as a last minute veggie side for guests.  I used frozen green beans, defrosted and substituted olive oil and dried parsely and it was still amazing and so easy.  One of my guests said that she usually didn't like green beans, but these were an exception.

I made this as part of a buffet for a friend's daughter's wedding--for 50 people!  I was working in a tiny kitchen in a comunity center--it had a sstove and microwave.  I had purchased 2lb bags of trimmed beans at Costco--to cook, I snipped off a corner of the bag and microwaved them for 6 minutes.  Then I melted the butter and added the walnut oil and toasted nuts and tossed that with the cooked beans.  Form there, they went out to the steam table on the buffet.  Lovely!

Made this tonight for supper.  In fact, everything we had tonight came from All Recipes.  This was pretty good.  Hubby liked it a lot.  He likes crispy green beans.  I like mine mushy. Used craisins as someone suggested.  Looked really pretty with the walnuts and craisins.  I cut back on the butter and the walnut oil to one tablespoon each, which was plenty. Even cooked the walnuts in the butter and walnut oil mixture before adding the green beans.

We thought this recipe was okay, but I wouldn't call it exceptional.  The walnut oil was an expensive ingredient, but didn't seem to add that much extra flavor.  I'll probably try the recipe again, though (since I have more walnut oil), but next time I'll add the chopped garlic suggested by the other posters.

These are SOOO good! My new fav way to prepare green beans. I only needed to bake the walnuts for 5 or 6 minutes or they would have burned. I did not have walnut oil and I cannot afford any at this time so I used olive oil and it still came out great!

This was an easy recipe to make.  Good flavor combination with the green beans and walnuts.  Next time I will cut back on the butter and oil because it was a little too "greasy" for my tastes.

My husband really liked this recipe. I added fresh minced garlic. It was good tasting and had a nice presentation. Think this would be good for a buffet. I do, however, still prefer the cherry tomato/basil/butter/green bean recipe from this site.

Great recipe. Very easy. I had a large dinner party and these were a HIT, for people who liked nuts. Sent my husband to buy ingredients, he couldn't find walnut oil. I substited olive oil. Sure would have been better other way. BUT still great.

I'm not sure why walnut oil is needed as nobody could taste it.  Be sure walnut pieces are small enough and do not overcook the string beans.  We liked it.

We used frozen green beans, cooked in boiling water and drained.  They were as bright green and crisp as fresh ones.  The walnut oil added a light flavor - not too greasy.  However, it definitely needed salt and pepper.

Such a delicious way to prepare green beans.  I used a bag of frozen french style green beans from Trader Joes.  I steamed them rather than boiling them.  The walnut oil does add a wonderful dimension.

I don’t normally have walnut oil on hand but I found out it was worth every penny spent. I par-boiled the green beans in hot water then put it in cold water to cool it. I also added in fresh minced garlic to the oil and butter. The walnut oil added another layer of mild nutty flavor to the beans. Thou I am sure if prepared without the walnut oil this would still be a tasty side dish. The toasted walnuts added texture and makes for a nice presentation. This was an interesting nice twist to plain ole green beans. I paired this side dish with, “Caramel Apple Pork Chops, “ and “Roasted Sweet Potatoes and Onions, “also from this website.

It's not that this was bad, it was just not as good as I expected it to be. Thanks, but I think I'll try another recipe next time.

This was very good.  I did not have walnut oil, but I did have white truffle oil.  Very nice.  I added a bit of garlic salt.  My teenage son even liked them!

Awesome!..  We like our green beans a bit more tender so I boil them about 12 minutes; I substituted sesame oil for walnut oil and still thought they were fantastic..  I've made them many times now!

Very tasty green beans!  I used olive oil instead of walnut, b/c I couldn't find any at my grocery store.

Very delicious and easy.  Be sure to take the time to toast the walnuts.  It really enhances their flavor and adds a whole new dimension to otherwise boring green beans.  I also couldn't resist adding a couple of cloves of finely minced garlic and it was a positive addition (if you're a garlic lover).

I added a small handful of diced red pepper , a small handful of diced onion, and two cloves of minced garlic, and sauteed them before adding the beans.  The family loved them at Thanksgiving dinner!

I Followed the recipe exactly and wasn't thrilled with it. I'm kind of disapointed that I went and spent $7.00 on the walnut oil and it came out bland. Next time I'll go with somthing a little more tastey and exciting. 
I will say the cooking time and method was perfect...the beans came out nice and crunchy and bright green. If you are going to try out this recipe, I would recoment using some garlic or carmelized onions with it....it just really needed somthing.

Found this to be bland.   Served this at a large family meal to mixed reviews. Used olive oil because I couldn't find the walnut oil.  May have made a difference.

Loved this one! Such a simple addition makes all the difference! Don't skip the step of toasting the walnuts first; this really adds such a depth of flavor. Really yummy!

Any recipe that helps us eat more tasty veggies is good.  I did splurge for the small bottle of walnut oil for this and found myself throwing it away 1 year later since I left it in the cupboard with this recipe attached to the bottle.  Much better to keep in the fridge so it doesn't go rancid.

My husband really liked this recipe. I added fresh minced garlic. It was good tasting and had a nice presentation. Think this would be good for a buffet. Went well with a prime rib roast I made. I do, however, still prefer the cherry tomato/basil/butter/green bean recipe from this site.
Also served with a Franciscan cab.

Very tasty! We're bored of the same 'ole bagged veggies and this was a nice change! Careful not to get the "nut dust" on the beans - it just doesn't look as nice. But very yummy!!!

Easy and delicious.  I used the olive oil (instead of walnut oil) to pan-fry walnuts and minced garlic and added them to the green beans at the end.  I would make this again.

good side dish, made with peanut oil becuase I didn't have walnut oil.  Can say roasting the walnut was a good thing to do. great for healthy dinner.

good side dish, made with peanut oil becuase I didn't have walnut oil.  Can say roasting the walnut was a good thing to do. great for healthy dinner.

I made these for Christmas dinner and found them to be absolutely delicious.  It was one of the only times I have cooked green beans to the perfect consistency.  I will definitely make this again!

I, too, could not find walnut oil at the groceries and sub'd it with evoo and it came out just as flavorful.  this went excellent with the prime rib that i was serving.  one draw back that i had was that since i needed enough to serve 12 people (about 3 lbs) with beans straight out of the refigerator, i had a difficult time getting the heat evenly distribute throughout in time to maintain the "freshness" of the beans. some of the beans had started to get the "over-cooked" look that i had tried to avoid. next time, i am going to bring the beans down to room temp before i try making huge portions again.

excellent recipe and super easy to make~!!

I wanted something different for our Easter dinner. I made these green beans and everyone loved them! They were a big hit. I nice change from the usual green beans. Next time i will try some toasted almonds..... I think that would go well also.

Pretty good. I followed the advice of others and added a clove of garlic and finely chopped the walnuts. I din't have any walnut oil, and couldn't find it all Wal-Mart so I drizzled the walnuts with olive oil before I toasted them and used that oil with half the butter called for. Also there was entirely too much of the walnuts after they were finely chopped. My husband loved them so I will fix them again without as many walnuts and try to find walnut oil because that may be the key to take it from good to fabulous.

This is a great receipe. It added just enough walnut flavor to give the green beans an exquisite taste. I steamed the fresh green beans rather than boiling, and I did finely chop the walnuts as was mentioned earlier.

I love this recipe!  I'm not normally a green bean person, but this dish is an exception.  I do leave out the parsley, though.  It seems to be a little overwhelming.

Served for guests at dinner, everyone liked them except me. I used  canola instead of walnut oil maybe that was the wrong thing to do? Great that they can be cook ahead though.

I love this recipe.  So good and looks so impressive and "fancy" yet so easy.  The walnut oil makes a big difference.  I omitted the parsely because I don't like it and it was still a wonderful side dish.

These were delicious green beans.  I poured boiling water over my frozen whole green beans and let them sit for a couple of minutes.  I rinsed with cold water and let sit until dry.  The toasted walnuts are essential to this recipe.  This recipe is going to make a lovely addition to my Thanksgiving menu.  Next time I'm going to add garlic for additional flavor, but they're very good as is.

This dish was 'okay'.  It went well enough for our Christmas dinner... but I dont know.  It was missing something.  I was expecting more of a punch I suppose... but to me, it was just okay.  I wouldnt go out of my way to make this one again... but I may toss some walnuts in with my green beans for the additional color and texture, rather than leaving them plain janed. :)

I think maybe next time I would try adding garlic, as the others have suggested.

I just adjusted  this recipe to make 3 pounds of green beans and served it to 22 people.  I didn't change the recipe at all, except I didn't add salt or pepper.  Everyone really liked it and the entire bowl disappeared!  You know it's good when people ask you for the recipe!

I was disappointed, little flavor even though I did use walnut oil . I added onion salt as well as a gourmet salt and pepper blend that gave it a little help, but overall very bland. I won’t use this recipe again.

Awesome recipe. Walnuts are so healthy for you and what a nice way to incorporate them.  I steamed frozen French green beans in this recipe. This will stay in our rotation.

Great recipe and method! I had guests arriving late for Christmas dinner, so I got it to the point of steamed and took 5 minutes to cook when they arrived. Changes: Two teeny changes: * I used an olive oil and butter mixture, and * I added 1 tsp of minced garlic. *Highly* recommend the garlic addition. Oh and they held up great in the slow cooker on warm! Like I said, great recipe and method.

While trying to make the lovely frozen green beans from Trader Joe's more interesting and contemplating what I had on hand, I found a handful of walnuts leftover from baking. Did a search and came up with this. I just heated the green beans not much past defrosting in the microwave and then added them to the oil and butter. I didn't have walnut oil (never have used it before. but will now, sometime when I can afford the luxury). Was fast and easy. Came out great. Family was very pleased. Definitely going to play with this again.
Interesting how there are 47 reviews and only 13 people say they have made it.

Delicious recipe. Like many others, I hate to suggest changes to someone's recipe they have shared but for personal preferences the only thing I would do differently next time is add a tablespoon of red pepper jelly.

I made these as a quick extra vegetable side dish for a small Christmas dinner. It was easy to make. Although, I don't see how it really flavored the green beans. Although, the walnuts made it look like a more attractive dish and they added a nice additional taste along side the green bean. Typically, nuts already come roasted. However, I decided to still toast these as instructed. Instead of doing them in the oven I just toasted them in a small pan on the stove top. On medium-high it took about 5 minutes. Just like in the oven, watch them! They will brown quickly. I used frozen defrosted green beans and I only had dried parsley so I cut that back to about a tsp and just heated it with the butter. I made 1/2 recipe with a 1 lb bag. I would make this again for a small holiday dinner side dish. It was good without being overly filling. ty

I roasted the walnuts a little longer, for 10 minutes Then, I didn't have walnut oil so I used olive oil and I used about half as much oil and butter as the recipe called for....  it was DELICIOUS!  My family, including my 3 and 5 year old loved it. I will be making this again for sure.

I had to modify a bit - I used all butter as I didn't have any walnut oil.  Turned out fine, though.  Nice change from steamed green beans, although not as healthy with all the butter!

This is a great combo.. I used canned beans (which I never like) and it was a great compliment.
