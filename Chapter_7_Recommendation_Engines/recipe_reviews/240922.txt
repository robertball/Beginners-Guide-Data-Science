Pretty good and easy to prepare. It's also very attractive with the black seeds.

It was a really good recipe, some of the ingredients I didn't have, so I used what was similar to the recipe. For the Dijon mustard I used ground mustard seasoning, instead of the soy sauce I used worstchesters sauce and I used regular sesame seeds. Even though my ingredients were a bit different the salmon still came out tasting delicious. I had put some veggies on the side with it.
