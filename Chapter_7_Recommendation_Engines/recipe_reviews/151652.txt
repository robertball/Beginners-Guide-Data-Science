Really good!  I added some diced bell pepper and mushroom with the onion, and took the advice of another reviewer and added the garlic near the end so that it would not burn.  I used Old Bay in place of cajun seasoning and regular cream of chicken soup because that is what I had on hand.  I like my food spicy so I added some ground red pepper and Sriracha hot chili sauce for kick.  I served this over lightly buttered white rice.

This was yummy, easy and quick. The cream sauce is flavorful. I would give it 4 and 1/2 stars. I used Emeril's Bayou Blast seasoning instead of cajun seasoning and served it on top of baked Cheesy Polenta. I couldn't find the herbed soup, so I used regular cream of chicken. I would suggest not serving this on top of anything too salty. Cooking tips: make sure you throw your garlic in after the onions have been sauteeing for a bit, or it will burn. Also, five minutes was too long for my shrimp. Don't forget to take into account the fact that the shrimp will continue to cook after you pull the sauce off the heat. The color is a big funny (due to the soup) but a dash of paprika pretties up this dish.

Followed the recipe to the T. Not bad, but not great. I've eaten in many authentic cajun restaurants in new orleans so maybe I'm too big of a cajun snob.

This was very tasty.  I used the low fat plain cream of chicken and it tasted great!  With the amount of sauce that it makes, you could easily double the shrimp.

This meal is VERY tasty! I read a few reviews where people didn't use the Cream of Chicken and herb soup and replaced with regular cream of chicken....and I would highly recommend not doing that! It adds flavor. Furthermore, I first had this at a friends and have made it a few times since - it is certainly best over cornbread or biscuits to sort of sop up the sauce. If you want it over rice or pasta - try adding a little cornstarch to it.

I thought this meal was great! I didn't have any of the fancy cream of chicken soup (nor did the grocery store) so I had to use the regular kind. At first I thought it was quite salty, but on top of the corn bread it is perfect!

I made this for dinner last night and am so glad I did!  This was one of the best recipes I have had in a long time!  I did make a few substitutions though.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, regular cream of chicken soup instead of the one with herbs, omitted the chives and served over penne pasta instead of a biscuit or cornbread.  I also cooked the sauce and shrimp for a lot longer than what the recipe called for on very, very low heat.  Next time I think I will add scallops and serve over rice.

This is a wonderful and quick "go-to" meal for our family.  We serve it with noodles and is wonderful.  Very close to the Seafood Alfredo served at a local resturant.

I'm giving this recipe five stars because it looks and sounds delicious, even though I have'nt prepared it yet. But the idea of corn bread or biscuits sounds strange to me. i'm thinking it'll be great served over pasta or rice. I'm going to try it first chance I get and I'll let you all know with a tried and true review of this recipe.

This was really good! I did find the Cream of Chicken with Herbs. (I thought that was pretty good by itself.) This is similar to a dish I prepare called "Barbequed Shrimp" but it uses a whole lot of butter. This seems a little healthier, and the taste is not that different. Plus, the Barbequed Shrimp dish leaves the shells on until it is on your plate. So, this is a lot less messier, too!  I just served it with some french bread for dipping. I will be making this again.
