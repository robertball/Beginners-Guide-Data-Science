I usually don't like to try recipes with this few reviews, but I had blueberries that were not sweet enough to eat, so instead of throwing them out, I used them for this recipe.

I am thrilled that I did.  I had all the ingredients in the house, so it is pantry friendly.  I used an small rectangular pan and followed the recipe exactly.  This is outstanding.  Definitely let it cool a bit.  It is too hot to eat when it comes out of the oven; believe me, I tried and it doesn't taste as sweet when it is that hot.  

The sugar in my opinion makes it just sweet enough and if my blueberries had been sweeter, it would have been as well.  Even though the coconut was not sweetened, it just gives that special taste.  If I would change anything, I would add some nuts, but it didn't need a thing.  Perfect for company in the winter and I could see apples tasting great or even bananas.  I will make this often.

A nice, healthy way to start your day.  I used frozen blueberries and baked them in individual ramekins which worked out very well.  I would add a little more brown sugar the next time, but it was still very good.

Easy and quick to put together, I doubled it and put in to a 13x9 pan. Didn't read through all of the directions and mixed the berries into the oat mixture, then added the brown sugar and cinnamon afterwards and threw it under the broiler. Let it sit for the 5 min -- oh my!!  If you have peeps in your family that fight over the crispy parts of baked macaroni, watch out when this comes out from under the broiler!

I come back to this again and again. It's a huge hit with the family and at brunches. So easy to make dairy free too.

This is absolutely delicious!  So easy and healthy.  I like to throw in pecans sometimes but the recipe is perfect as written.

Simply delicious!  I'm a big fan of oatmeal and this may be my favorite way of eating it.  I didn't change one single thing about the recipe.  Couldn't possibly improve on it.  Thank you for sharing this awesome breakfast treat!

Excellent! I left out the coconut but added a tablespoon of milled flax seed. It was perfectly sweet and moist as is. Delicious and healthy!

I thought it was very good. I substituted applesauce for the coconut oil but followed the recipe otherwise. Next time I might add some toasted English walnuts or try substituting chopped apples for the blueberries. 

I shared it with two neighbors who both loved it. I also asked it about five minutes longer than the recipe said.

Delicious. I used sweetened flaked coconut as that was all I could find so I decreased the brown sugar slightly, maybe by a tablespoon. Omitted the coconut oil as I didn't find it necessary. Otherwise made as written.

This is fantastic as is. I have altered it a few times adding sliced bananas on the top and even decreasing the coconut oil! Also good mixing in a few tablespoons of ground flax seeds! Yummy and great for office parties, brunch or for breakfast for me and my husband for the week!

This was very tasty and quick and easy too. I used part milk and part half & half for a little richer flavor. I would like to try it with different fruits.

I love this recipe and it’s my go-to when I get together with my extended family. However, I had to switch out milk for coconut milk and egg for the flax seed due to allergies. It was fabulous! I didn’t miss the egg and the flax seed enriched the flavor.

Love this!!! My husband asks for this once a week. I use two eggs instead of one and use unsweetened almond milk to keep it dairy free. Nobody can tell the difference. This is a keeper! So easy!

This was good.  I substituted butter for coconut oil.  I thought it was a little crumbly, so I might add an extra egg next time.  The proportions of this recipe are good, so you could make it with a ton of variations and it would probably come out well.

I love oatmeal in the morning and this recipe is a great alternative to conventional oatmeal! Next time I'm going to ease back on the coconut just a bit but everything else was fabulous!

Well, this is the second year in a row that I have made this recipe and I don't often do this unless the recipe is really good.  This recipe is good but that's not why I decided to make it again, it's just a perfect warm, filling breakfast!  I tried to follow the recipe exactly, but I did not have unsweetened flaked coconut, mine was sweetened.  With all my recipes I make them and separate them into servings and freeze them so I can have a hot breakfast at 4am before I go to work.  This recipe is very thick I needed to add milk, but great tasting on a winter day!

This was fantastic! An easy way to get the whole grains in. I doubled the sugar and used one cup shredded carrots to replace coconut. I also used almond milk and added a tablespoon of chia seeds for extra nutrients. I will use this as a go to recipe. It will be great for busy work day mornings.

GREAT STUF! Few things: don't add coconut oil to egg mixture and let sit..LOL...milk and egg are cold, it solidified bc it sat too long! I added a few more blueberries than called for on bottom and top (maybe an extra 1/4 cup) and DH doesn't like coconut so I omitted flakes (used coconut oil though).  I added 1, maybe 2 T of agave (bc DH and kids like it sweet) - and I did sprinkle extra cinnamon and v little b sugar on top as mentioned in cooks notes, but truly it is NOT really needed even if you like it sweet.  NOTE: I learned from last time cooking similar dish - it's ok if it looks mushy. It needs to be bubbly and ort of set to be "done"- not a wad of paste (which happens when you cook until all was firm).  Would totally make again with blueberries!  So glad I have enough for 2 more breakfasts - reheats nice w/ a little milk to make it a little more liquidy

My whole family loved this. I'm making more today. I did one pan the same and the other i reduced the milk and used pureed pumpkin instead of blueberries. Hopefully that one will turn out just as good.

I tweaked the recipe a bit, adding 1/2 cup flaxseed instead of coconut shavings, and using frozen blueberries.  I melted my coconut oil in the microwave so it would mix better and substituted almond milk for regular milk.  I also ended up mixing all the ingredients together because I wanted to make the oatmeal muffin size so I could eat it on the go.  The recipe is delicious, but I wouldn't recommend doing it in a muffin pan.  It is far too moist to take on the go.  Tastes great, though!

To be perfectly honest, I don't like oatmeal but I made this to try to get more fibre into my diet and found that I really enjoyed it.  

I followed the recipe pretty much to the "T" except for replacing the blueberries with a chopped apple and the milk with almond milk.  

The reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is I found the amount of coconut flakes to be too much.  Next time I will just reduce that amount.
