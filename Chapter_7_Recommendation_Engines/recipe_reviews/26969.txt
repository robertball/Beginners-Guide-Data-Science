I used this as a sauce for the Polynesian chicken wraps from this site and it was wonderful! I used a can of crushed pineapple in pineapple juice (not in heavy syrup and I didn't reserve the juice to add in later) and added the cornstarch and ginger to it and it turned out perfectly!

Tired of barbecue meatballs? Try this sauce! I served it at my party, using frozen meatballs from the warehouse store, and everybody loved them.  I also couldn't find pineapple in heavy syrup, so I added a couple tablespoons of corn syrup. I also ended up adding all the juice I had saved from the cans.

I'd give this 3.5 stars, really, but since that's not an option, I'll bump up to 4. Not a bad sauce, nothing really amazing about it either though. Made a nice sauce for chicken meatballs for a tropical-themed potluck. Was a tad on the sweet side, but not bad.

Awesome!  Used with the "Spicy Polynesian Wraps" from this site and it was delish!  I used 1/4 fresh pineapple and added 2T corn syrup. I put everything in the food processor and pureed it, poured it in the saucepan, brought to a light boil and let it simmer for about 5-7 minutes.  Just the right texture!

Very good sauce.  Used over ham balls instead of the usual mustard-spiced sauce with fantastic results.  My husband kept trying to sneak more after dinner.  Thanks!

I added a teaspoon of garlic to the sauce and served it over grilled chicken that had marinated in spicy ginger marinade. I served over a bed of rice and garnished with green onions, cilantro and toasted coconut. We had sweet potatoes on the side. It all went together very well and was as yummy as it was easy to make.

My pantry & fridge is seriously depleted. I am out of fresh ginger, ground ginger & I don't have any of that nifty "ginger-in-a-tube". So I used chopped candied ginger. My pineapple was in light juice not heavy syrup so I didn't even bother to wash the sugar off. I used real maple syrup & added a couple of tbp extra because I was topping pork w/ this & I love maple & pork. I also added several twists of black pepper. I sauteed small jerk-seasoned (store brand) pork medallions in some olive oil, served them on top of a bed of jasmine rice w/ chopped bell pepper (I added it about halfway through the rice's cooking time) & "drizzled" the pineapple sauce over all. Very good! There is quite a bit leftover (I didn't scale down the recipe) so I will try the leftovers on some frozen meatballs. Thanks Michele O'Sullivan!

I created this dish for 10lbs of meatballs at work and the residents loved it as a little happy hour treat!  I thought it was pretty tasty myself!

We really enjoyed this with swordfish.  Mine turned out more like a chutney, but it was very good.

I'd say this is a 3 as written and a 5 with changes.  It was fairly bland and flavorless before I played with it, and oddly not very sweet even with the heavy syrup.  I ended up upping the OJ to a full cup, adding about 2 Tbsp of lemon juice, 2 Tbsp soy sauce, 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp red pepper flakes, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, and upping the ginger to 1 1/2 tsp.  Mixed with a 2 lb bag of meatballs and it was delicious.  I think next might be good with pineapple juice instead of OJ too.

We had this with the Spicy Polynesian Wrap from this site. It paired well with it. The sauce isnt absolutely amazing on its own, but can likely work well with many other recipes. Thanks!
