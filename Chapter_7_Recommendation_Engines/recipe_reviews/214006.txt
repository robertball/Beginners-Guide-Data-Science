Light and sweet taste.  Even my picky husband liked it. LOL :)  I would recommend basting the lamb (like a turkey) with it's own juices several times while it's in the oven so that it comes out moist.

I made the recipe as stated but decided to take it a step further by marinating it in a cup of hard apple cider and rubbing the lamb with the sweet version of 'quatre epice' with the addition of white pepper. The sauce was really good, but next time I would make more. The lamb tasted overly game-y this time, perhaps the spices I used brought out that flavour, and I would try the savoury variation next time, or use less spices. Tasty.

We started the lamb, just rubbed with the honey, some dried rosemary, salt, pepper, and a little olive oil.  After about an hour in the oven (we like to cook lamb at a lower temp for a longer time) added the cider to the pan, along with chopped carrots, a small sliced onion, and chopped potatos to finish cooking.  Nice, tender lamb with a lightly sweet flavor; dinner was excellent.

I plan on making this for Christmas, and was just curious if I could use regular apple cider instead of the hard cider?
