I also want to add that in the original directions I put to add enough water to cover the veg, but they put in 4 cups.  You might need a little more than that.

After experimenting, I use 1/2 tsp dried tarragon, 4 tsp chicken base in the water, and no cream of celery soup.  Instead I melt 1/4 cup of butter and add 1/2 cup flour.  Stir over low heat for a few minutes then add to soup with one can of evaporated milk.  Skip the cream.  Also, your veggies will taste better if you sweat them out in a tbsp of butter before you add the broth.  Only about 5-7 minutes on med low heat.

This was very good soup. We liked this a lot and will definitely be making it again but with a few changes for our own taste. I did change 2 things this first time. I only had one can of cream of celery soup so that was all I used. I actually am glad that was all I had because I felt, to my taste, that the cream of celery was overwhelming for a potato soup. Then I used Half & Half instead of all heavy cream (which I would again). I think next time I will use either just cream of potato soup or maybe one of each (potato and celery). I will definetly be making this a lot as it is a good base but just with my own personal tweaking. Thanks for sharing Tabitha.

This is an excellent recipe. Once the vegetables were cooked, I threw in some leftover cooked broccoli that I had in the fridge. I also used evaporated milk instead of heavy cream since that is all I had on hand. I will definitely use this again. Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious and super easy. Prep didn't even take too long. I took the advice of some and replaced cream of celery/heavy cream with evap. milk and butter/flour mixture. Added thyme, bay leaves, a bit of rosemary and tarragon, which added flavor and removed the need for excessive salt. I also sweated the veggies before adding the liquid. This helped raised the flavor profile of the mirepoix. This should really be called a chowder since that's what it tastes and looks like, but whatever. I plan to add mushrooms next time.

I used cream of chicken soup instead of celery and 1/2 & 1/2 with cornstarch instead of heavy cream.  I also added some boullion because the flavor was a little bland.  It was good, but nothing terribly special!  I like a different ham and potato soup on here!

We fixed this tonight. It was fast and easy and very delicious. I added light sour cream and 2% cheddar cheese blend after preparing. We also added a little cayenne pepper for some spice. Very good recipe!

A great hearty soup recipe for a cold winter day. I made two changes because I didn't have a couple of ingredients.  I used cream of mushroom for one can of the cream of celery (only had one can of celery) and didn't have heavy cream so I used half & half and decreased the salt since the ham was pretty salty. Soup still turned out delicious.  Thanks much Tabitha for the recipe

I was looking for the recipe I used last year for our leftover turkey and just now remembered it wasn't turkey at all, it was a bunch of leftover ham we had. I used this recipe and it was a huge hit! Great recipe!!! Now I need one for leftover turkey though...

This is a delicious, hearty, creamy soup.  I added some fresh thyme and rosemary to the veggies as they cooked.  I served it with crumbled bacon and triple cheddar cheese on top.

This was so good.  Easy to assemble.  I had ham leftover after the holidays that needed to be used in a more creative way.  This fit the bill perfectly!  My husband loved it.

Was a BIG hit for my family! I have 4 picky boy eaters and they left me only 1/2 cup left of this soup when I got home from work! I have to make some more now. I did however boil a ham bone with leftover ham on lit and used that broth plus water. I didn't have any heavy cream either, but it was great even without it! AWESOME RECIPE!

This soup was SUPER easy to make and it tastes great!  I was a little concerned that it wouldn't have enough flavor because I had to leave out the onion (sensitive newborn who is breastfeeding), but it was still fantastic.  Even my 2 year old ate it, and she hates all things vegetable.  I would definitely make this again.

Very good.  I added 6 cups of liquid (3 cups chicken broth and 3 cups water) and then added 2 Tbsp of flour to the cream (I used FF 1/2 & 1/2) at the end.  I also added a clove of garlic.  I will be trying with skim milk instead of the cream next time to save on caleries.

This soup is AMAZING.  I live in Vegas so it is just to hot to have soup a lot. I am always looking for a good hearty soup for that one day a year that might be cold enough and this one fit the bill!!!  This is a great soup for a cold rainy day!  I also make homemade bread bowls so each person has their own bowl.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY just using salt and pepper for additional flavor.  Would just like to comment to the person that gave this recipe 3 stars and didn't follow this recipe exactly.  Please follow correctly before you give a negative comment.  I am pretty sure that YOUR changes is the reason you didn't like this recipe. In the future follow the recipe EXACTLY before you give a negative comment!  I love this recipe, will continue to make it and give away as a gift!!! Thanks for sharing!!!!

I didn't have regular potatoes so I used sweet potatoes. I also only had one can of cream of celery, which turned out fine. It seemed SUPER runny to me, so I had to add corn starch to thicken it up. 2 cups of shredded cheese helped to thicken it up to my liking too. :) Good base recipe.

This was awesome! Did make a few changes. I used no canned soups. Used my home made chicken broth I had frozen for soup and a small amount of Tones chicken base. (Sam's carries it.) I always thicken my light colored soups and stews with instant potato flakes and in this soup it was great! Used all the veggies plus more ham. Boiled carrots first, 10min, then added onion, celery, and potatoes. Cooked just till potatoes were tender then added ham, half and half, not cream, and about 3tblsp. butter. Stirred and cooked for about 10 min more. It was wonderful! Served in heated bowls 'cause in Colo food cools down too fast for this Texan! Thanks Tabitha!

This soup got and OMG this is good review from friends and family! I changed it alittle.. I sautéed the ham with the celery and garlic then added the potatoes. Only used 1 can of cream of celery (because it was all I had) and added some cornstarch to thicken it up a bit.

Excellent!  Made it exactly the way the recipe called for and will definitely make again and again!  I make a soup similar to this only with chicken and creme cheese.  I think I'll switch that one around and use the cream soups in it.  Husband had extra helpings.. all the kids ate it.  The only thing I would change is that I would cook the carrots and celery alone for about 10 mins then add the potatoes and onions.  But other than that?  It's superb the way it is!  We served it with Vienna bread.

Wow, as far as ham and potato soup goes, this was by far the best I've tried.  My husband found the recipe and made it with the leftover ham we had and we both couldn't believe how tasty it was.  We followed the recipe exactly, except also added a bit of cayenne.  When served, we cut up some cheese cubes and garnished the soup.  I don't think it could get any better than this - especially since it was so easy to make and ready so quickly!  YUM!  Thanks!

This recipe is a real hit! I've done it twice in two weeks. Everyone loves it. I altered it by adding a chopped jalapeno and a half cup of slice celery. Yummy.

Loved it! Left out the carrots and the cream. I just put everything in the crockpot on high for 4 hours. I used a potatoe masher at the end to make it thicker and it turned out awesome, it didn't even need the cream. I used one can of soup and half the amount of  water it called for.

Made this exactly as recipe states.  Very good base but a bit bland at the end, so I added Jane's Krazy Mixed-up Salt to taste and it made it over the top.  One tip, dice the potatoes small, the bit's I got with large potatoes were starchy and more bland.  Will def make again!

This was really good, I did leave out the salt and added a fiesta Mrs. Dash blend which added a little kick.  Also added leeks and mushrooms, this is definately a good base that you can throw any veggies into.  Thanks!

I enjoyed the first bowl.  Leftovers I found quite rich.  I believe this was the canned soup.  Next time, I may try a chicken stock base and add light cream after veggies are tender.

Loved this recipe!  It's easier than using a recipe that requires making a roux etc., but tastes just as good!  I upped the ham to two cups, but otherwise kept everything the same! Thanks, Tabitha.

I had some left over ham from Easter so wanted to use it up.  This recipe is good but a couple of tips: I recommend sweating carrots, onion and celery for a few minutes first in a knob of butter because my potatoes were done before the other veggies. This may differ with different potatoes but I used what I had on hand - reds. 4 cups of water is MORE than enough. This cooks really quick so you dont get too much water evaporation, and the soup can end up really watery.  I didn't have cream of celery so added cream of chicken, tasted pretty good. Will make again but think it through a little before just throwing everything in the pot.

I'll have to agree - this is the best potato soup I've ever had!  I love soup, and potato soup has always been a favorite of mine.  This was so quick and easy to make that I can't believe how good it turned out.  Awesome recipe!

Easy! Boiled ham bone from spiral-sliced ham until the meat fell off, used that stock & cleaned up/diced the ham from the bone. Used just 1 can cream of celery soup (due to salt from ham), 1 cup of milk (thickened with corn starch), left out the celery, added a pinch of garlic powder, added potato flakes for more thickening.

Fantastic warm and filling soup for a chilly winter night! I used onion powder because I was out of onions, and I used evaporated skim milk instead of heavy cream. Delicious! Will make again!

I followed the recipe pretty closely, using more veggies because they needed to be used up.  I served it with hot jalapeno cheddar bread which added a nice kick.  There were NO leftovers, and that is rare at my house.  I will make this over and over because it is really tasty.

Soup was fabulous,  though I did add to my cream 4 Tbsp of flour and 4 Tbsp of butter since I did not have cream of celery.

I've made this recipe quite a few times, each time doing slight modifications to it. 

This last time instead of adding cream of celery soup, I took about a cup of buttermilk and put it on a low flame on the stove in a small saucepan. 

Then I added flour until just up to the point that it was like a dough, and threw the whole blob in the soup. Stirred it in, and let the soup cool for about 10 minutes and it was very think and creamy. 

I will make this again for sure!

Great recipe. I had leftover bacon from breakfast, and left over ham from the night before. Yikes! Did we overdose on the nitrates or what?? Anyway, I split the water with milk - so 2 cups of each - cooked all the veggies on a simmer, added the ham and bacon, "Better than Bouillon" Chicken paste, and the peas from last night's dinner as well. Did the mash thing, and added more milk as needed. Right now, it's thick, tasty, and I'm considering cheese on top prior to serving. Not a fan of condensed soup so I winged it.

Normally not a soup person, but a friend made this for a party. I nicely went to all the appetizers instead.  After everyone started raving about the soup, my husband convinced me to take a bite!  I've been cooking this for the past 6 years!  Always a hit!

I will definitely make this soup again.  I used 1 1/4 tsp. salt, and a little over 1/4 tsp. pepper.  I used a can of Cream of Chicken soup in place of one of the cans of Cream of Celery soup, and I also added 1 more cup of water for a total of 5 cups.  I had only 3/4 c. of heavy cream, so I used Half N Half for the remaining 1/4 c.

My husband is not the cook in the family, but coming home to him making this recipe was surprising. He followed the recipe to letter and even had our 6 year old help make it and the end result was AMAZING.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves fresh veggies in a cream sauce.

This came out creamy and wonderful.  I substituted some Kirkland No Salt seasoning for the salt to keep the sodium down.  I also added 1/2 cup of chopped carrots that we had in the refrigerator and a little extra water to compensate for the extra volume.  It is a recipe that one can scale up or down depending on what extra ingredients you add.  The kids loved it and asked for seconds.

Hi there fellow soupers!!  I loved this recipe and changed it just a bit.  I used a sprial cut ham bone that I had in the freezer and boiled it in 1 1/2 cups of water, just long enough for the meat to separate from the bone.  I strained the tid bits from the stock and used the ham water to create my soup.  I also used cream of mushroom soup because that is what I had!  I reduced the amount of heavy cream to one cup and used 2% milk for the 2nd cup.  No salt was necessary to flavor this soup, just lots of freshly cracked pepper when served.  This is a 5 star recipe! Easy and delicious!

I made this tonight for my family and they loved it. I also did change the recipe just a little. I added 3 cups water to stop it from being to runny. I put one can of cream of potato and one can of cream of celery. I diced up 3 1/2 cups of ham. Best idea ever. Added salt pepper and lawrys. I also uses half and half 1 cup instead of heavy cream. Also did make crescent rolls like another person had suggested. Hope this helps everybody :)
