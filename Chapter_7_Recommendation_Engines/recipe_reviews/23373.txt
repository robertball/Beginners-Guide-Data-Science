My sister and I have made this several times and it is always a big hit. The cocktail sauce really makes this dip wonderful.

No olives.  Use whipped cream cheese instead of whipping regular cream cheese with milk.

Not sure if I just did something wrong because everyone else seems to like it....but you are better off not spending a half hour chopping veggies and just picking up a (better-tasting) seven-layer dip from the store! The secret ingredient, cocktail sauce, isn't so secret. That's what it tastes like! My friend said she would not think of it as taco dip.

Awesome dip! My only criticism is that after it sets a while in the fridge, it's starts to get watery from the sauce, but that was easily taken care of w/ a paper towel. I brought this to room temp before serving so that we could easily scoop this up w/ crackers and that worked out perfectly! We thought the flavors of this went great together! Definitely will make this one again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Great recipe. I made a couple of modification. I had a bunch of people over & I was a little worried that their wasn’t enough of the sour cream base so I doubled that part. Also I didn’t have a green pepper so I chopped up some jarred jalapeños. It turned out great! I uploaded a picture of the finished recipe.

The cocktail sauce is just odd for Mexican and the cream cheese is not a pleasant base. I tried eating it after making it, but me and my family really thought it was a no go. Tasted off.

I took a chance on the recipe for a family pool party.  Everyone recognizes the 7 layer dip but people were pleasantly surprised at this variation.  The cocktail sauce almost tastes fruity in this mix of ingredients and it was a great snack for a group on a hot day!  You won't go wrong with this and you can count on people asking you for the recipe.
