This recipe is simple, delicious, and easy to make. For those of you that have never made "tacos de lengua," make sure you peel off the outer layer of skin before you shred the meat!

Good recipe.  My husband loved it.  When I bought the tongue at the store he said, "that's just for you."  But after he ate the tacos he said they were the best he's ever had.  I'll tell him what they were made of when I'm done with this:)  I made the tongue just as written, but just made a cold salsa like another reviewer adding lime and cilantro.  I give it a 4 because although the meat was melt in your mouth good, it was missing a little something to me.  Felt a lot like eating a roast beef taco.  I might put a few more spices next time I cook the tongue. Yummy though

Delish. Keeper. Instead of cooking the tomatoes, peppers, and onions,  I chopped them up by hand and added a handful of cilantro and a squeeze of lime to make salsa and serve with the tacos.

Delicious!  The meat is so tender.  Follow the recipe, no changes needed.  My kids didn't know what they were eating, they thought it was roast beef. It was so good that when I told them what it was they didn't gross out!  I will be making this recipe over and over. Thanks for sharing!

I was hesitant to try this recipe, but boy am I glad I did try it! I changed a couple of things tho, I added chicken bullion to the water, and I cooked it on high for 5 hours for a 4.5lb tongue... It came out amazing!  So tender and full of flavor, I will definitely be making this again!

This was an EASY way to prepare tongue! The house smelled great as it was cooking and I was really looking forward to the tacos all day. I was disappointed, however, when I tried them. The meat, while very tender, was not as flavorful as I had expected. I prefer the other recipe for Tongue Tacos on this site. Still, this is overall a good, easy recipe.

I've made this exact same recipe before. When the steer went to the butcher I told my husband I wanted the tongue.  His response was "You'll be eating it alone" I didn't tell my family it was tongue until days later.  Now they rave about it.

I always go to my favorite taco truck and order tacos de lengua and decided it was time for me to try to make these myself. Mission accomplished. I
made them for after church Sunday lunch and this is definitely a keeper. I put them in the slow cooker with all the spices and a some salt because I knew it would need it. We came home from church and the house smelled wonderful. After cooling the tongue and peeling the outer layer, I chopped it up and before putting it in the taco, I sauteed it in a little bit of oil and sprinkled it with some house seasoning (garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper) and put it on my corn tortilla. I also chopped up an onion and cilantro and squeezed it with lemon juice (because I didn't have a lime) and let it sit for a bit. The citrus is really a must and really enhances the flavor. For the sauce I used a poblano pepper instead of the serrano but only because I bought the wrong kind and it was still good but it didnt have the kick that I like so I will see if the serrano are hotter the next time I make it.  My hubby when he saw the tongue was grossed out but he tried it anyway and LOVED IT!!! We also had a friend over who thought it was lamb. We devoured every bit of it.  And guess what's on the menu this Sunday after church? Tongue Tacos!! P.S. The kids ate it too!

Wow I never thought of adding a bay leaf. Now I know what I was missing from the tacos from the taco stands and my own was that leaf! Have you tried it in a pressure cooker? 40-50 minutes tops!

This was SO EASY!  However, I added a lot more seasoning to the tongue in the crockpot and it did wonders!  I seasoned it with garlic salt, Tony Chachere's, and McCormick's Montreal Steak Seasoning.  It came out to be the best shredded beef I've ever had in my life!

This was the first time I ever ate beef tongue. It was absolutly tender and "delicious". I did however add oregano and beef bouillon to the crock pot and I made the salsa hot but added lime and cilantro to it. I will be making this recipe again!:)

I have been wanting to try this recipe for ages. I bought a tongue at the local butcher here in New Zealand and cooked it as recommended in the recipe.  I have made a few modifications however.  After peeling the tongue (my dog LOVED the results of the peeling) I shredded the meat, placed it in a medium sized bowl and added the following ingredients:  1 can of kidney beans 1 can of hot kidney beans 2 tablespoons hot sauce 1 envelope of Old El Paso Taco Seasoning 1/8 cup of broth (the water the tongue was cooked in) as well as all of the onions from the pot.  I mixed this really well and after sampling it for taste and 'hotness' it is in my fridge marinating until dinner time.   It already tastes DIVINE.  I'm not going to tell my 15 year old twins what its made of...because I know they will love it otherwise!!  i

I cooked the tongue for about 10 hours, shredded it, cooked the tomatoes and 1 jalapeno, then just threw the onion and meat in and cooked it altogether.  It was wet, but the best tongue taco's I've ever had and everyone else who was willing to try it, raved!

This dish is excellent.  I even got my wife to try some and she said it was really good.  The salsa is a little spicy, but I think it has just the right kick.  If you want to tone down the spice I would only use 1 or 2 peppers.  I had the meat in the crock pot for about 12 hours.  I took out the meat and removed the outer covering or layer of the tongue.  It shredded wonderfully.  If you are hesitating trying this meal, do not.  The meat is similar in texture to barbacoa.  A warm tortilla, some lengua, and a squeeze of lime with some salsa.  That my friends, is a good place to be.

This tasted just like a real Mexican restaurant!  I was skeptical of beef tongue, but a friend gave me one, so I tried this recipe.  I added some dried oregano and a little bit of cumin and chili powder at the end. I cooked it in the crockpot for about 7 hours on high.  The salsa is really good too (I substituted jalapenos for serranos and deseeded first).

Honestly, I was frightened of this dish just because of what tongue is and how it looks.  But, it was delicious.  I used a pack of beefy onion soup instead of the onion, no added salt and a little more garlic.  I did not have a bay leaf but it turned out fine.  The skin peeled right off after cooking with no problem and the tongue tasted  just like a very rich roast beef.  I used roasted green chile instead of serrano served on home made tortillas.  So for all you doubters out there - don't be afraid to try something different because in this case, different is good!

I made this recipe for the first time exactly to the recipe. It turned out good but it was missing that"umph" I think next time I'll add a taco seasoning packet to the water and some bouillon. Thank you very for the recipe I plan on making this more often in the future. Thank you again :)

I have to admit we were a little skeptical about this recipe. But it was wonderful. I did what another reviewer did and instead of covering with water I covered with chicken broth. It was so tender and delicious, even my picky 15 year old son loved it.  This recipe is a keeper.

I made exactly as is. When I assembled the taco, I made half with the salsa and half with cilantro, onion, and freshly squeezed lime. I did prefer the cilantro, onion and lime topping. As for the beef tongue, it was tender and tasted good. It did seem to lack in flavor but I am comparing it to a restaurant recipe and not homemade. Served with Pico de Gallo and Best Guacamole.

I made a few changes, but this was really good.  We bought our first steer last year and I got a tongue... ok, what the heck to do with that.  Get on Allrecipes and find a recipe.  I used chicken stock that I made from some left over chicken, it was spicy,  instead of water, and that meant I didn't need to add salt.  I didn't have a bay leaf, so I used oregano.  I had jalapeno's from my garden so I added 3 of them.  My husband had tongue as a kid and wasn't too excited, but we both really enjoyed the recipe, it really was like roast beef.

My husband is from Mexico and is a big fan of tacos de lengua (beef tongue tacos). So I was a little nervous the first time I served him this dish. But it was delicious and he absolutely LOVED it. I've now made it several times and it has beecome a household staple. Thanks for this fabulous recipe!

I have about a 3lb cow tongue.  Put in the slow cooker last night for 8 hrs, then put in the fridge.  Woke up this morning and warm it slightly in crockpot.  I'm having trouble peeling off the skin.  Also, the meat isn't shredded.  It seems almost tough, like it would be chewy.

After tongue is cooked, you must peel the thick skin off.  Discard it.  Thank you for sharing a great recipe. I now have 2 recipes on this site to use!!! Please do share more recipes!!!

Very easy to prepare. I did my" Green Goddess Pico de Gallo" recipe instead of the peppers & tomatoes. I also softened the corn tortillas in hot vegetable oil. I finished the tacos with a squeeze of lime. Very nice!

I cooked this exactly as written for the recipe, and found the meat to be quite bland and mushy.  I will not be making this again.  It smelled great while it was cooking, but that's as far as it went.

i made the sauce as written and i combined it w/ the shredded meat. it was very good. i cooked mine on high for 5 hrs as another reviewer suggested. i had a very hard time getting the membrane off and it was very difficult to shred. i would suggest sticking to the recipe and cook it on low.

I am currently in Hanoi, Vietnam and I though why not try this here. I was able to get fresh tongue and it made a differenace. My husband loves this dish he said it tasted just like the resturant he used to eat this at in Texas. I did cook everthing together and added 1 cup of chicken broth. Now all my friends here want this recipe. This is a keeper.

I absolutely love Lengua tacos. I read a couple of reviews:  I use the same spices,but you can add chili powder, plus cumin, and seasoning salt. Another option for the seasoning is to add a jar of mole. Excellent recipe!!

I have been making this for years! About once every 2 or 3 months, I will fix this. It is wonderful! Tasty and inexpensive. I also enjoy it with w squirt of yellow mustard on it,not with the taco's of course. I have to Sample and make sure it's done, that's when the mustard comes out. Update: 09-24-09,I made this today for tomorrow's supper. I slow roasted it,in the oven 300 degrs.for  6 hrs. along with tonight's kalua Pig. The tongue is Terrific! Tender and flavorful. Making taco's with it.Thanks again Mama Rivas:) This dish does make me smile! Patty

We have been fans of beef tongue forever. We prefer cold salsa on the side with plenty of fresh lime juice and cilantro. Also, add oregano when cooking the tongue. If you only use a portion of the whole tongue for tacos, slicing up the remainder of the tongue for sandwiches is a heavenly meal, with Dijon mustard and maybe a little mayo.  This is 'poor peoples' food, but you wouldn't tell it from the price.    BTW, smoked tongue is the greatest!

Really love this recipie.  I just don't tell the kids.  We told them what it was after the first time I made it and they had eaten it, mind you they were saying yum the whole time. They said they would never eat it again.  So, now I make it and don't tell them.  I just say we are having beef tacos and they come running.  It is super delicious.  If you have never "worked" with tongue before, get over the boiling/peeling part.  If you can rip the skin off a chicken and cut it up, you can deal with the tongue.  It is the best meat, and this is the best recipe!

Very simple to do. I did not do the sauce though. I purchased tortillas made down the street at the local shop. Topped the meat with diced onions y cilantro(from the Mexican market) and a squeeze of fresh lime juice

I have to say this was my first time making beef tongue and it was all together an awesome experience! I followed the recipe except I used my slow cooker and made it outside on the balcony overnight. Call me weird but I wanted it to be ready for morning breakfast without the smell of "meat" so early indoors. Although I made my own salsa; I love this recipe and will share with others. Thank you.

This was the first time I’ve ever made tongue. I used this recipe for cooking the tongue, and it was fantastic! It was incredibly tender and tasted much like roast beef. We bought pico de gallo, so I can’t attest to the tomato/Serrano part of the recipe, but I’ll definitely use this recipe again.

This was my first time preparing this and it turned out phenomenal! I used beef bouillon and taco seasoning, in addition to the onion slices & garlic (used minced) & bay leaves. The flavors blended real well and no salt needed. Next time I will either just make on the stove or use the high setting on the crock pot. It wasn’t quite tender enough to easily shred & I cooked it on low for 10 hours. I transferred it to a pot and finished it off on the stove, about an hour or two, checking for doneness periodically. It ended up turning out great & shredded much easier afterwards. I was able to peel the tough layer of skin off no problem. The taste & consistency is very similar to pot roast, as others have said. Kept the meat warm in the crockpot set on low until it was ready to serve. All raves over here, even my daughter loved it. I will be making this again in the near future!!

I used jalapeño peppers and added some salt and pepper. Reminded me of my trips to Mexico. I blended the peppers and tomatoes in the food processor. Added A good squeeze of lime and some cilantro to top it off. Very easy and taste great!

I had never cooked or eaten tongue before so this was certainly a new experience for me. This recipe is simple, easy to make and delicious. The only thing I would add to the recipe is to peel off the outer layer of skin on the tongue before shredding the meat; otherwise, this becomes an extremely difficult task to accomplish. The flavor was great; much better than I expected. I will definitely be making this dish again.

Here is my variation:

I cook the tongue with garlic only in a regular pot for about 2 -3 hours.
Once shredded I fry (no oil needed!) the tongue on a pan and add salt to taste. 
I use chopped red onion that I marinate in lime juice at least two hours before eating.
Chopped cilantro is mandatory!
My hot sauce is made out of jalapeño peppers and tomatoes about 1:1 for mild 2:1 for spicy. I cook them and then blend thoroughly adding a little olive oil.
I always have flour tortillas and corn tortillas available.
Avocado is a wonderful addition to this taco. 

I still have to find the first person who do not love this tacos. I have fed them to "people who do not eat tongue" for a pleasant surprise!!

My kids thought I was losin' my marbles when I said we were having this for dinner! They refused to eat! But when it made it to the table and they saw how much everybody else was diggin' it, they caved in. Now I can't make it often enough. This is a must try!

Ha! I was just looking over the recipe to cook a couple of beef tongues I have in my fridge. The first two times I made this, one tongue was just barely enough for my 3 kids without me or my husband having any. I looked a this recipe today and thought "this cant be the recipe I used before"! Apparently, I didn't read over it correctly and cooked the tongue WITH the tomatoes and the peppers as well, instead of making salsa!! It was so good that I'm going to make that "mistake" again!
