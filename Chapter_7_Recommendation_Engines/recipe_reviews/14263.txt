Great dressing - definitely clean and simple. It's perfect over mixed greens. I did add a bit of minced garlic as I just love the stuff and a pinch or two of sugar but other that this a very good salad dressing to highlight a good quality balsamic.

Anyone that loves Balsamic Vinegar will truely appriciate the robust simplicty of this little salad accessory! Also a wonderful addition to the dinner table as a dipping for hot crusty bread, this yummy concoction will make you forget all about that boring butter cube! You may even begin to believe you've been transported to a European Salt-o-the-Earth household if it's served complete with a hearty pasta and bottle of chianti! 
For my second mixing, I changed it around a bit. I upped the quantity to make a cup and a half (3 parts olive oil, 2 parts balsamic vinegar, and 1 part purified water) as the guys in our house were practically trying to drink it out of the jar!! Also, I did throw in a bit of granulated garlic (use your taste-buds to judge the right amount for you). It was heard said from the proximity of the couch that someone doesn't know what they're going to tell Mr. Newman! ;)

I enjoyed this dressing, and will surely use this recipe as a base again. I sampled it before putting on a salad, and I did decide to add about 1 teaspoon of sugar and 1 teaspoon of roasted garlic (made by slicing the top off a garlic bulb, drizzling with olive oil and sprinkling with salt, wrapping in foil, and roasting for about 45 minutes at 400 degrees; when cooled, squeeze the soft, caramelized garlic cloves out of the bulb). The dressing was good to begin with, but just perfect for my taste after the additions. As petty as it may seem, I didn't care for the color it turned the salad: a brownish color. It looked like spoiled lettuce, despite the good taste. I believe firmly in the importance of presentation, so this was a turn off to me. I think when I use it again, I will try white wine vinegar instead of balsamic to alleviate the problem. Surprisingly, the dressing was enough for a salad that served 4, one more than the recipe says. Altogether a good recipe-- glad I found it!

This is great!!! I now make it all the time for my salads.  I was wanting a salad dressing with no salt and no sugar.  I love the balsamic vinegar.  I definately make it in larger quantities!

I tried this recipe because I forgot to buy dressing at the store, and I had all of these ingredients on hand.  My husband and I both really enjoyed this dressing.  We will definitely be making this again and again.  Very easy and tasty.

This is one quick, easy recipe made with stuff I always have on hand.  I must admit, I added some garlic to mine, but I have a thing for garlic... This could easily be used for a meat/veggie marinade or for dipping fresh bread.  Thanks!

Oh, my.  I love this stuff.  I added some garlic powder and some ground romano cheese, and a tiny pinch of sugar, and it's marvelous! I just made myself a salad at 2am JUST so I can have some of this dressing!  I'm definitely making this my new favorite dressing!

Very simple, very good. Make sure you use a quality balsamic vinegar otherwise it won't turn out as well. Who knew something this simple would make salad greens taste SO good? NOTE: I might try using a little fresh minced garlic next time but it was quite good as is.

i am So picky about my dressings, and could honestly not believe how tasty this one was! i have ran out of olive oil because of this recipe,due to my putting it on my now TWICE-daily salad! it does look very *rustic* and authentic on the salad. even my 2-and 4-year olds will eat this. i chose not to doctor mine, just seasoning with cracked black pepper and salt(fleur de sel)as the recipe states, and i usually doctor EVERYTHING. i really have been eating this recipe since i found it last week. 
if you really want to treat your guests, serve them a simple salad of just GARDEN FRESH cherry tomatoes, halved or quartered, lightly tossed with a splash of this dressing, and VOILA!
very yummy

This was so easy and very good! I used it to dress up some simple sliced cucumbers and black olives. Yum! I threw some Parmesan cheese in the salad, it worked out pretty well.  My 1 year old liked it too :)

I have to say that after all the rave reviews, I was very disappointed with this salad dressing.  The oil kept separating from the balsamic vinegar and the taste was very tangy.  I would highly suggest using good quality balsamic, as I think it really makes a difference with so few ingredients.

My Italian husband liked this dressing for its simple, UNDER the  top taste.  He always thinks salad dressings are too overpowering to really taste the vegetables in a salad. The second time, I added garlic and he was OK with it.

MMM YUM! I was looking for a salad dressing made with olive oil that I could eat while on my detox diet and this is it. I didn't add the garlic, but next time I'll try it that way.

This was very simple and quick to make and tasted great.  It also used ingredients that I normally have on hand.  I made it when I ran out of bottled dressing.  I would definelty make this again.

My husband wanted me to try baby spinach leaves for the first time. So we made this dressing to have with them. I have to say I love the dressing and dislike the baby spinach. I'm going to suffer through the baby spinach tomorrow at work just so I have something to have the dressing over.

Simply and tasty.  I enjoyed this with just some greens.  The recipe has such simple ingredients, that quality becomes very important.  Using really good olive oil and balsamic vinegar makes the recipe special, since there's little else besides that in the recipe.  I think the oil/vinegar proportions were great, and the only thing I can think to do to improve this is add some minced garlic (but that's because I add garlic to everything that isn't dessert).  Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful recipe. This is our favorite for bread dipping; sometimes the guys want red pepper flakes added. Thanks, Andrea~

Thank you so much for presenting this recipe. If there is one thing anyone who cooks needs to do is: learn to make salad dressing. DON'T ever, ever buy that awful stuff from the supermarket. For a few dollars you can stock your cupboard with olive oil, a variety of vinegars and there you go. Just pour everything in a small Mason jar and shake.  I like to add honey ( I'm a beekeeper), some dried herbs, whatever.  This is a great starter recipe. My go-to vinegar is white balsamic---all the flavor but with a lighter color. Thanks again.

I actually use this recipe as a base. I usually don't measure the amount of vinegar and oil I use, I just eyeball it. I also like to add salt and pepper, some dijon mustard and sugar. I love the addition of oregano in this recipe. I usually make this in a jar or other sealed container and then just shake it really hard until it blends together. It's easier than trying to whisk it hard enough to make it emulsify.

I love the versatility of this recipe.  You can add all kinds of extras to suit your taste.  I mixed in a pinch of sugar and some roasted garlic...everyone loved it. To the reviewer who complained that the oil and vinegar kept separating, some basic chemistry lessons may be in order.

A simple and quick salad dressing that can be made with items easily found in your pantry.  The flavor is satisfactory.  I love the flavor of balsamic vinegar, but this would not be my go-to salad dressing recipe.

Love this salad dressing. It has the perfect ratio. I use a full tsp GREEK (the best) oregano (check your local Greek specialty food shop for freshly dried oregano). I also add a pinch of sugar whenever I'm making caprese salad for a sweeter dressing. Yum!

An easy to prepare salad dressing. To the ingredients, I added 1/2 tsp of Dijon, 1/4 tsp of sugar and 1 clove of garlic, minced. I tossed the dressing with greens, grated carrot, chopped red cabbage, toasted pecans and dried cranberries. Thanks for the recipe, Andrea.

So simple and very good.  After we made it we made it and tasted it we decided to add a pressed clove of garlic and that really enhanced this dressing.  I would suggest making this a head of time to allow the oregano to soften in the oil and balsamic mixture.  Thanks for the recipe

I've realised as a basically non-picky eater I am quite fussy when it comes to salad dressings. Either they have too much oil or too much vinegar. This one however was perfect for my tastes and I didn't need to make any adjustments. I used it on Tomato and Asparagus Salad from this site. I'll definitely be using this every time I need a balsamic vinegar dressing. Thankyou Andrea.

I really enjoyed this dressing!  Just the right amount of each ingredient!  It is better if made the day before.  I enjoy it at room temp rather than refridgerated.  This dressing is much better than you can buy!

This is the best salad dressing you will ever need. A little crushed garlic added to the mix is even better. And remember folks, don't drown your salad, just DRESS it! A little goes a long way.

It was a little oily for my taste so I added a little additional balsamic and then it seemed kind of flavorless. I don't expect to be making this again.

I will never buy bottled balsamic dressing again! I did add 1/2 tsp. dijon mustard the second time I made it, which I think improved the consistency a lot. I also added a little sugar and garlic powder, about 1/4 tsp. I then topped the salad with craisins and pecans. DELICIOUS!

This salad dressing was delicious.  I added a teaspoon of sugar and garlic powder and   thought the added sweetness tasted great with the balsamic vinegar.

Fantastic salad dressing! I doubled it and then added a small finely minced garlic clove and a quarter-teaspoon of sugar. Delicious!

I originally learned this recipe from my (Sicilian) grandfather, who adds a bit of sugar and garlic power in as well.

This was so simple to make. I used this when I wasn't able to eat any sugar or anything that broke down to sugar. My favorite dressing is ranch, but this was great for what I needed it for. Instead of using regular salt, I added garlic salt, but kept everything else the same. I've had dressing similiar to this in restaurants and I think they call it Balsamic vinegarette. It's probably about the same thing.

Really good! I took some other reviewer's suggestions and did 3 T olive oil, 2 T balsamic, 1 T water, 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano, 1/4 teaspoon garlic salt, and a dash of salt and dash of pepper. Lovely! Thank you for this quick salad dressing!!

Very yummy-this is a quick and delicious go to dressing recipe. I added just a bit of garlic and sugar to tweak it to my taste.   I've tried lots of bottled balsamic vinaigrettes and they were all gross-this one is hands down fantastic and super easy.

I will never buy salad dressing again. This is it! I did the exact recipe (olive oil + balsamic + salt + pepper + organic), and added the following: pinch of light brown sugar and pinch of garlic powder.  YUM!  I am seriously going to empty a jar of dressing and fill it up with my own concoction.

So fresh and easy.  I tripled the recipe and grated in one clove of garlic since we like that.  Friends raved about the salad (romaine, carrots, bell pepper, chyote, feta) with this dressing.

This is fantastic. It took less than two minutes to make, and almost that short a time to devour! SUGAR FREE! How many salad dressings can you buy that are sugar free? HUH? Well? This stuff is A-1.

An excellent base, you can do a lot to alter this recipe to your taste. I didn't have straight oregano so I used Italian seasoning and would do that again. I felt that the ratio of vinegar to olive oil created an oily feel, so I added an extra tablespoon of vinegar.

This dressing is so versatile and easy, I've made many variations. You can add garlic powder or minced garlic, sugar, Italian seasoning, and I usually add Red Wine Vinegar as well. One thing that I noticed from another review --OIL AND VINEGAR NATURALLY SEPARATE--ITS CHEMISTRY--JUST SHAKE IT UP!!!

Good with a pinch of sugar for my taste. I used this to dress a random mix of cold noodles, tomatoes, red onion, broccoli, and carrots. Topped with shredded parm cheese and it was nice and refreshing.

Fabulous!  I scaled up to 9 servings.  Put everything in a jar, adding a couple drops of stevia and a mere tad of garlic powder, then shook the jar vigorously.  It tastes better as it sits at room temp for even a day or two.  No need to refrigerate, since there are no raw ingredients in it.  Best dressing I've made in a while.

Made exactly to specs and it wasn't bad at all...Will try adding garlic next time to see if that kicks it up a notch. It's a keeper,  especially as it doesn't call for any sweetners.

I first made this, as written, because I was short on ingredients and time.  I was surprised at how much I liked it, but I'm a big fan of balsamic vinegar.  It's a perfect dressing for a weekday, on-the-go salad just for me.  I have taken to adding garlic powder and crushed red pepper to it, just to personalize it.  Toss it with some greens and feta cheese and I'm a happy little camper.

Very nice dressing. I added a bit of sugar, as per some other reviewers. I like a slight bit of sweetness in dressings but it was a little too sweet, so I think I will try both with less sugar and also without any the next couple of times I make it. Still good though... my boyfriend and I each had 3 helpings of salad with our dinners!

It's good! It tastes fresh and adds just the right amount of zest to our salads. I liked how easy it was to make, as well. I am beginning to make salad dressing in avoidance of soybean or canola oil and this one will be a staple.

Simply delicious! 
 Since I've been reading labels on salad dressing, I've been thinking why put all those strange ingredients on my fresh greens??
Thanks for helping me on the quest to eat better!

great basic dressing you can do a lot with. I gave it 4 instead of 5 because I made a few changes that gave it a little more pazzaz but it's all about personal taste.  If you are interested here is what I changed.  Equal parts EVOO and vinegar because I felt it was a little too oily in the original, whole garlic clove fresh oregano and I put it in a magic bullet type blender type blender.  I think next time I will add fresh basil in too.  All in all small changes to a great dressing!

In an effort to be more health concious, I have been trying to get away from bottled dressing and this is a perfect and easy option.  I gave it a 4* rating as I used Italian seasoning instead of oregano, and garlic salt to taste.  My 7 year old daughter recognized it as the dip we use for foccacia bread, so I'm very happy the kids will use this, too.

Great mix! My wife said that it reminded her of the salad she used to get at The Flying Fork, a fantastic Italian restaurant in our home town. So I can't complain about this vinaigrette w/ that compliment =D

I love this dressing.  My Italian friend makes all of her salads this way.  Two things she adds, however,  are: garlic powder and a sprinkle of sumac (a Middle Eastern herb) over the top.

This is a really simple and good recipe..the only reason I rated it a 4 is because it seemed like the oil overpowered the vinegar flavor, so I doubled the vinegar to my liking and then it was delish!

I made the dressing according to the recipe but found that it lacked some flavour and the balsamic vinegar was overpowering. I had to modify it to adjust the flavours. I didn't like the dried oregano either. I would recommend using fresh instead.

This recipe is awesome and versatile.  I did it all as in the recipe but definitely added more italian seasonings.  It's great to be able to just add a little more of each of the ingredients to make some more of it!

Yummy! Makes a perfect amount. Delicious with tomatoes. Like others though, I found it could use a bit more flavour. I added a pinch of sugar and garlic powder

I don't know if my balsamic vinegar was bad or what but this just didn't turn out as I expected.  Maybe I'll purchase a new bottle and try it again sometime as I can't believe what I had was what got all the rave reviews.

this was very good. I changed it a little I used red wine vinegar instead of the basalmic and next time I'll use a little less oil. sprinkle with parmesan cheese. this is good I'll make it again thanks.
