This is the best soup recipe I have ever found. It took me about 3 tried to get it just right. The first time it was very stringy (used too much of the asparagus bottom) and the second time it had flour lumps in it (make sure flour is desolved before bringing to a boil). I bought the asparagus ready to use (the bottoms cut off) at Trader Joe's. That fixed the stringy problem. I also used a steamer to cook the asparagus (for about 12 minutes) and the onions (threw them in at about 6 minutes). From there, I put that into the blender with 1/2-3/4 c. vegetable broth. Everytime I make it, it's gone by the end of the day. My family loves it and so do my co-workers.

Double YUM!!  I used chicken broth and skim milk, added the juice of one half lemon (about 2 tsp), and used seasoned salt instead of regular.  Also, had to use a little extra broth to get a good puree from the blender.  To make it easier and quicker, I'd recommend chopping the asparagus into small pieces (inch or two is good), and cook veggies with the lid on to reduce evaporation.  Loved it!!

This is EXCELLENT!  I've made it maybe 6 times, and every time, I surprise myself with how good it is.

I bought an immersion blender recently.  It's just the $13 Proctor Silex model - nothing fancy - but it saves a bunch of time on this recipe.  After I've steamed the veggies, I take a small bit of the withheld broth, mix it with the flour, salt, pepper, and butter in a pan, and cook the roux.  Then, I simply put the roux in the pot with the veggies, add the milk and extra broth, and use the immersion blender to mix the whole thing up.  It easily purees the veggies.  I add the yogurt and lemon at the very end.  Delicious, and it seems to be as tasty as the original recipe.

I made this for a group of 7 people. One of them didn't like asparagus but decided to try it anyway. My daughter said "no way, not eating it". Well they all ate it and loved it! I doubled the batch and that was perfect for 7. I noticed a few people mention the stringiness. I used very large asparagus because that is all the store had. I cooked it until VERY  mushy. It did not have ANY strings in it. Because I simmered longer I had to add extra broth.

Thought the soup was great and very easy to make.  If you have an immersion hand blender it's even easier.  I didn't have any trouble with stringy asparagus because I cut it up into small pieces to cook.  Also, I used regular milk instead of soy and chicken broth instead of vegetable broth.  Lastly, I added some sour cream.

Immersion aka stick blender made this soup smooth and creamy. Simply added the flour, salt and pepper to the cooked onion and asparagus and stired. Then added  everyting else and blended. Wonderful flavors!

Delicious! I used 2% milk instead of soy and used 1/8 tsp onion powder instead of regular onion. I also only pureed 3/4 the asparagus and cut the rest in 1 inch sections and added it to the mixture.

Good, but you really need a powerful food processor or blender.  Mine just didn't really get the job done, and while the flavor was good, the texture was awkward.  The yogurt, lemon, and cheese really do make for a sharp, delicious soup and this is certainly hearty enough to make a meal of.  I added a little nutmeg to mine, also, for a bit more flavor.

This soup was surprisingly delicious! I admit I was a little skeptical even after reading the rave reviews. Unlike another reviewer, I loved the addition of vanilla soy milk and vanilla yogurt instead of plain, and I would definitely recommend straining as much as possible.

Delicious!  I used tzatziki in place of yogurt, and it worked wonderfully.  Topped soup with asparagus, mushroom and macadamia nuts sauteed in butter and chardonnay.  I was thrilled with how tasty this soup was, how decadent it felt, and how very quickly it came together! Will certainly make again :)

We absolutely loved this.  I did make some changes.  I used chicken stock instead of vegetable stock, for flavor.  I used an entire carton size of broth in the recipe.  Also, I sauteed the onion in butter first.  Then added in the asparagus and poured in about a cup of broth, then covered the pot so the vegetables could steam.  I used regular milk instead of soy.  I added the rest of the carton of broth to the flour and butter/milk mixture.  When it thickened, I poured it into the asparagus and onions and then used the immersion blender to puree it.  I also added 1/2 cup parmesan cheese directly into the soup at the end.  I topped the soup with a dollop of sour cream in each bowl.  Yum.

This soup is absolutely fantastic...and healthy!  I have made it many times and have come up with some favorite substitutions.  I use a little more than a pound of asparagus and cook the asparagus and onion in a little more broth than called for until both are quite done in order to get the perfect puree.  The secret is to use fat free half and half instead of the soy milk and to use greek yogurt instead of just plain yogurt.  The end result is thick and creamy with a hint of tang...yet extremely healthy!

This soup was great, very smooth and creamy.  Try straining the puree before adding it back for an even smoother result.  Can't wait to have again!  Perfect for asparagus lovers!

I used whole grain flour instead of flour, olive oil instead of butter, and chicken broth instead of vegetable. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. It's savory and sour without being overpowering on either. This would be great sauce. Perhaps over cheese raviolis? And you could definitely use a different vegetable if you wanted to. Broccoli, butternut, green peas....

Wonderful recipe, and such a beautiful colour in the bowl!  I used a creamy, mild natural yoghurt, and I really could have doubled the quantity of yoghurt to get that faint 'tang' to the soup.  I'll use a Greek natural yoghurt next time for more acidity.

Love it, easy and great hot or chilled. I didn't have a problem with stringiness - not sure if people used too much of the tough ends of asparagus *hint: if you hold the asparagus spear by both ends an bend until it snaps, the bottom half where it snapped naturally should be discarded.* I also simmered the asparagus and onions, covered for about 15 minutes or until very soft. I added some fresh grated pepper, can't go wrong with that! Love it, will be making it often!

Very good, but I think you have to like asparagus in order to enjoy the soup and get past the color/consistency!  It really does look like a slightly thinned pea baby food!  My only changes were to use regular 2% milk and sour cream in place of yogurt b/c I only had fruit flavored! Also, I had roasted the asparagus the night before for dinner and used the leftovers to make the soup, which was perfect : )

Delicious! Made exactly according to recipe and I really liked it. To avoid that stringy texture of the asparagus, simply snap the ends off by holding firmly only at each end of the asparagus and bending until it breaks. The asparagus will snap off where that dryer, stringy texture begins. Discard the butt ends that come off. 
I did listen to earlier reviews and let it sit for a few hours in the fridge which helped as it was ready for dinner when I was! Definately recommend making according to recipe before you rate it.

I loved the sour taste of the soup.  What an adventurous idea to add yogurt and lemon juice to a hot soup (well, at least to me it is!).  It is very refleshing to start a meal.  Thanks for the great recipe.

It was all right.  I only added about 1/2 cup of milk because I felt it'd dilute the asparagus taste too much.  Either way, it wasn't utterly fantastic but I didn't think it was bad.  It was missing a more complex flavor to it--it was a bit bland/one-dimensional.  Probably won't make it again since I wasn't too impressed.

This was one of the BEST soups I've ever had.  I used half and half instead of soy milk so it was even creamier.  I will definitely double or even triple the recipe next time I made it as it only produced about 3 1/2 bowls.  And believe me, you'll want more. A tip-to avoid stringiness, simply hold the piece of asparagus by the bottom and middle top of the stalk and break.  It will always break at the point that the top half will be perfect.

I absolutely love this soup recipe!  Asparagus is a favorite of ours, but I feel that even if you didn't care for the vegetable, it's a great way to get these healthy veggies into your diet.  Followed the recipe, with just a substitution of chicken broth for vegetable broth because that's what I had on hand.  It's a very quick and easy to throw together soup - unlike other recipes which have to be prepared a couple hours in advance.  I did use a little more asparagus than called for and kept out about half of it to be cut up into 1" pieces and added after pureeing the rest.

This is wonderful. I used vegetable oil instead of butter b/c my son is allergic to milk. I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth (all I had). Would definitely make again.

I am an asparagus lover but this soup was a little too bland for my family.  It needs an additional ingredient (I'm not sure what) to make the flavor more interesting.

Good and creamy!!  The flavors blend together well and it is extremely filling for only 150 calories.  I used vanilla yougart and vanilla soy milk and I thought it was too sweet.  Good, but sweet.  Next time I'll be using plain.

Pretty good.  I thought it would be better made with half & half and 2% milk, and sour cream instead of the soy milk and yogurt.  Made this way it was too heavy tasting.  However, I did boil the veggies covered with a lid and my soup was smooth and not stringy at all.  Next time I will follow the recipe, but probably still not use soy milk.

Just finished this for supper, I substituted with chicken broth that I made yesterday and sour cream in place of yogurt. I found it good but slightly bland, next time will add garlic as in other suggestions. Will definitely make again as I love asparagus.

easy to make and delicious. There are many ways to make variations of this... and the lemon, asparagus and yogurt are such a delicious and healthy combination. I added lemon zest as well.

I got to test out my new blender today.  :)  This soup really hit the spot after a damp and chilly day in Seattle.  I used dairy milk instead of soy milk because it was what I had on hand.  The result was a very rich and tasty soup (although I imagine that asparagus picked earlier in the season would have yielded something even more savory).  Even with the soy milk, though, this soup would still probably end up very rich.  .....  Still, the recipe could use a little something extra; despite being tasty, it was a bit boring.  Next time I make it, I'm going to add a spice of some sort to offset the vegetables.  Maybe some caraway?  Cloves?  Either that or something spicy, like chili or cayenne powder.  If I find something that works, I'll edit my review and let you all know.

Not too sure about this. My mom made this recipe I found and accidentally used vanilla yogurt. So it had a sweet flavor, which was not very good. I don't know if we'd try it again. Besides the sweet flavor by mistake it was okay.

Excellent soup, we loved the combination of lemon/yoghurt/asparagus. I cut the ends of the asparagus before cooking them to avoid any strings in the soup.

This was very easy and delicious.  I used 1% milk instead of soy milk, and chicken broth instead of vegetable broth and it turned out great.  I'll definitely make again and again!

I've made this recipe 3 or 4 times now and it is awesome!  My husband and I both love it!  He even threw some asparagus in the shopping cart on a recent shopping trip, asking for this soup.  My only variant is to use regular milk instead of soy. This is my new favorite way to eat asparagus!

I make this often - love it.  I use low fat soy milk and greek yogurt.  I usually consider 2 "bundles" of asparagus to be equal to one pound.

This was o.k. but a little too creamy.  I followed recipe but used "no chicken" broth and greek yogurt.  Next time I'll use less soy milk and yogurt and more broth, that way the asparagus flavor won't be too diluted either.

This soup is fabulous!!!  Not only does it taste amazing, it is so easy to make!  I cooked the asparagus (cut in 1-2 inch pieces) with onion powder (not a big onion fan) and chicken broth (didn't have vegetable broth) in my pressure cooker; took 4 minutes and came out perfect!  I made a roux with the flour, butter, salt, pepper and milk.  Then I added the rest of the chicken broth to the blender with the asparagus to make it easier to blend.  Mixed them all together and added the yogurt and lemon juice.  So easy and so delicious!!  A definite keeper!

Very tasty, a nice combination of tangy and creamy with the asparagus. I added a clove of garlic with the onions and asparagus, which I thought added to the flavor.

I wish I could give this more than five stars! So good that my family was begging for me to make it again (which is good because we had a lot of asparagus this season). I've never considered myself an asparagus person, but I think this recipe converted me!  I used chicken stock instead of vegetable broth, skim milk, and non-fat Greek yogurt, which almost made this taste like it had cream in it.  Smooth, creamy, and elegant! I can't wait for local asparagus season next year so I can make this again.

This soup is wonderful. I just used regular milk. Also, I suppose if the stringiness from the soup bothers you, you could use a food mill to blend it.

There are so many dimensions to this soup! It's the perfect consistency and the taste is phenomenal! We used 2% milk instead of soy milk. I'm not sure how people are finding this soup stringy?...the asparagus is pureed which means those 'strings' are ground up in the food processor. The recipe is perfect as is, don't change a thing.

Very good.  The only thing I would change is cooking the flour for 2 minutes in butter. The soup tends to get lumpy.  I think next time I will shake the flour with the cold milk before adding it to the pan.  That works when making gravy with no lumps.

Loved, loved, LOVED this soup! Hubby & I gave up meat for Lent and discovered this soup for a dinner option. Can't say enough good things; it was creamy without being too rich & the flavor of the asparagus was delightful. If you're not too sure about this soup, PLEASE try it because you won't regret it!

I used 1% milk and the juice of half a lemon.  Next time I would strain the mixture after adding the puree to the broth and before adding the milk and yogurt as my finished product did have fibers in it and I had to go back and strain it at the end.  Otherwise, this soup was delicious and I would definitely make it again.

This recipe is very simple and easy to make, just like a soup should be. It has a light, tangy flavour (a combination of the yogurt and the lemon juice) - not a strong asparagus flavour, but delicious. I thoroughly enjoyed it, my boyfriend not so much - I'd give it a five, he would give it a three, so we compromised on a four.

This recipe is outstanding!! I use chicken broth instead of vegetable because I keep a big jar of broth powder in my cabinet and I use regular 1% milk instead of soy because that is what I keep in my fridge. YUMMY!!!!

I thought it was just a tiny bit too tangy, but it grew on me with each spoonful and really it's a very tasty dish. Will probably make it again but reduce the lemon juice and yogurt a bit.

This was a wonderful flavored soup!!  I used chicken broth and milk products instead of soy.  Even with skim milk it was creamy and delicious!  My only problem was the asparagus was stringy.  I even cooked it very well and used my emulsion blender.  I would try it again for sure!

Fabulous recipe!  My partner who hates asparagus soup loved this.   I didn't have all the ingredients.  I used organic low-sodium chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, fat free plain yogurt, and skim milk instead of soy milk.   This is a great tasting soup with a reasonable amount of sodium.

A yummy soup indeed.  I didn't add salt (more than enough in the stock!) and in fact would opt for going low-sodium broth if using store bought.  I was concerned that it make lack some flavour, so added some ginger for a bit of a kick.  Will definetly make this again.

I tried this with asparagus and it was great.  Now I use the basic recipe with all kinds of vegetables, mostly broccoli and carrots, and I mess around with the yogurt amount--I like more.  It's always delicious.  Thanks for such a healthy and simple soup recipe!

Delicious. I have made it three times both as the recipe says and vegan and it is always a winner! I usually double (or triple) the recipe and freeze some.

I left out the yogurt and lemon juice, and the soup was still delicious.  I topped our bowls with crumbled blue cheese, which complemented the flavor of the soup nicely.

This is one of the best soups I have EVER had. Excellent! My one tip to people who had stringy asparagus is to break each piece separately, discarding the bottoms. The asparagus will tell you which part of it to use! Cool, huh?

I loved this recipe it was very light and tangy I would definately make it again. One suggestion though, try using greek yogurt instead of regular yogurt it makes it a bit tangier.

Incredible!  This one blew me away.  I cut back on the salt and tried with asiago cheese which was wonderful.  I'll make this all summer long!  Tried it with Orange, Walnut, Gorgonzola, and Mixed Greens Salad with Citrus Vinaigrette recipe on this website.  It was a great meal!

Fantastic soup- some adjustments though...I nearly doubled the asparagus, simmered it a while to ensure a nice texture, used rice milk instead of soy, and added about 1-2 tablespoons of dried dill. Awesome rich taste, even without the parmesan.

Great tasting soup! My 10 year old loved it, even though she usually detests vegetables in any form. Had no problem with strings because I prepared the asparagus differently. Instead of boiling it in broth, I snapped off the ends & boiled in 1 inch of water for only 3 minutes before putting the asparaus in the blender with the broth & onions.

This soup was delicious. I did add some Mrs. Dash table blend seasoning to the flour along with the salt and pepper. Also I cut about 2 inches off the bottom of the asparagus which I guess eliminated the stringyness. The parmesan cheese is an absolute must!

This was my first expirement with asparagus soup..I AM FLOORED!!!! SO IS MY NEIGHBOR!!
The substitutions i made were, i used half and half instead of soy milk ( i wanted it mega creamy) but next weekend when i try again it will be heavy cream.. and i used a twice as much asparagus as the recipe called for i really love asparagus, its my favorite veggie!
YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED AT ALL!!
I forgot to buy the parm cheese, but i added some extra cracked pepper

My husband and both enjoyed this fast and easy soup.  (Golly he doesn't even like asparagus) :)  I am anxious to try this same recipe with fresh broccoli as was suggested in another review. The bonas is a "healthy choice soup".

I did not like this soup with asparagus. But it was fabulous with 1 lb of broccoli flowerets. My family and I also found that using vanilla yoghurt instead of plain gave it a richer more desert like flavor.

Very good! I used my blentec blender to purée the asparagus after it simmered and had no issues with stringyness at all. I used cream instead of soy milk, and used chicken stock instead of vegetable stock. Yummy!!

This is a tasty recipe. I used chicken stock as that is what I had, and left out the yogourt as I had none. Along with the lemon juice I added the zest of half a lemon. Also, instead of parmesan, I put feta cheese in to serve. Delicious!

This was very easy to make and tasted amazing!  The only difference between the recipe and what I used was almond milk (instead of soy) and coconut milk yogurt (instead of cows milk yogurt).  I was blown away at how good this tasted!  One of my two boys (my 9 year old) gobbled it up and my husband has requested that I double the recipe next time I make this!

I made this to use up some asaparagus I had and wow was I impressed! I had to make a couple minor changes to make it OK for my son who has a severe dairy allergy, but nothing that I think changed the original intention/taste of the recipe by much. I substituted dairy free butter, almond milk, and I served his portion before I stirred in the yogurt (of which I used sour cream since I only had flavoured yogurt on hand). Also, I added an extra 1/4-1/2 cup of broth in the blender because it was too thick to puree properly.
My picky 1.5 year old loved it. My 15 year old LOVED it. My husband and I loved it. My only complaint about this recipe is that it didn't make enough for leftovers! Next time I'm doubling the recipe.
***BTW, adding sriracha sauce took it over the top for my teenager. The flavours work awesome together and it didn't take away from the asparagus taste at all.
Thank you so much for this, I'll be making it often!

This is the best asparagus soup recipe ever.  It's easy to make and the results are extraordinarily delicious.  Make sure you wash, double wash, triple wash your asparagus to get the tenacious sand off of your asparagus or you'll have grit in your otherwise perfect soup.

Had to use vanilla yogurt and lime juice instead of lemon.  It turned out very delicious.  I will probably add more black pepper next time.

I thought it would be bland because of the amount of liquid but it wasn't. I recommend drizzling some lemon olive oil on each before serving. It made it a lot better.

five stars for the flavor, but the method is only 3 stars. There's really no need to have so many pots and make it so complicated. saute some onion until soft and then add the asparagus, cook that up for a few minutes and then add your broth. bring that to a boil (add some black pepper if you like) and get the asparagus really soft and tender. Stick an immersion blender in there and blend away until smooth. add some yogurt and milk and blend again. garnish with grated parmesan and some reserved asparagus tips. DELISH! thanks for sharing :)

I gorge on this soup during fresh asparagus season. I assume you could use frozen asparagus if you get a craving for it during the winter months, although I haven't tried doing that. I forgo the Parmesan cheese, preferring the fresh spring flavor of the vegetables. Super easy, super good. It doesn't get better than this.

awesome!  I loved this - but did tweek a tiny bit with half-and-half instead of soy milk and five-blend Italian cheese instead of Parmesan (as that's what we had on hand).  My son (not much of a cook at 26 years old) even asked how HE could make it at home for himself :o)  We've shared with the neighbors who loved it too.

Simple and yummy! I used asparagus and leaks that were in this week's box from our local crop share. Per comments, I chopped the veggies small and simmered for about 20 minutes. Since I didn't have yogurt or sour cream on hand, I used an allrecipes substitution of 1 tablespoon lemon juice in 1 cup of heavy cream which supplied the tartness. At this point I let it cool and put it in the refrigerator until we were ready for dinner. Then I reheated it and use the immersion blender again before finishing with the lemon juice and cheese.

I really enjoy this super healthy soup.  I use more asparagus than it calls for.  I make sure it is cooked until mushy.  It tastes even better the next day.  A great way to sneak in veggies.

I just made this, and had to run back to the computer to review - it is delicious!  I am on weight watchers and it's 3 points per serving, which makes it a great addition to my recipe book.  I used 2% milk instead of soy and nonfat greek yogurt.  I also kept adding water to the veggies as they boiled so they could cook for at least 15 minutes.  My asparagus were quite thick and I wanted to make sure they were completely soft.  When I blended the veggies I let the blender run for about 5 minutes to guarantee a soft texture.  The soup came out velvety and smooth, with a creamy texture and a little tang from the yogurt and the lemon.  You would think I had used a ton of heavy cream!  I look forward to experimenting with other flavors in this soup, like roasted garlic or curry powder.  A+ recipe!

We made this soup for our family, and it was a huge hit. You get the perfect taste of fresh asparagus, and we often pair it with some peasant bread.

I love this recipe and have been making it for at least a year now.  I really like it with roasted garlic.  I roast a whole head of garlic and puree it with the aspargus.  It gives it more savory notes.

Thanks, Nanook - this is a winner.  Instead of vegetable broth I used shrimp broth and I omitted the parmesan cheese.  This makes a creamy but light soup, bursting with flavor.  We will be having this again.

Excellent soup. We subbed chicken broth for the vegetable broth, used sour cream instead of yogurt and skipped the lemon and parmesan. My kids ate it and asked for seconds.

Wow, amazing soup. I did tweak a few things-used chicken broth, whole milk and sour cream. Also, I needed to whisk the flour mixture thoroughly after adding the broth to get all of the lumps out. I didn't know what to expect as I don't have much experience with making soups, but I will definitely make this one again!

This soup was excellent! I made very few changes, although I added sea salt to the asparagus and onion while cooking, and I used skim milk instead of soy. Thanks so much for the recipe! I will definitely be using this one again!

WOW!  I could barely put my spoon down.  This was outstanding.  I didn't have soy milk so I used half and half.  Also, I don't own a blender or immersion mixer so I pureed the asparagus in my bullet...worked well enough.  I served it with toasted rye bread.  Delicious!

Update 11/23/2019
I've made this a few more times since my last review and wanted to comment on a vegan version that I made today.  In lieu of the yogurt, I used Tofutti sour cream and replaced the soy milk for coconut milk.   It was delicious and stood it's own to the published version with dairy products.

This soup was easy to make, had a wonderfully creamy consistency and tasted delicious.  Be sure to cook the asparagus well to avoid "strings".  I had rave reviews from my guests.  I used low sodium veg broth and omitted the salt in the cooking but sprinkled some salt on the top after ladling the soup for those who had no problem with sodium.  I didn't have plain yogert on hand so used lemon yogurt and omitted the lemon juice.  As one of my guests was an "Asparagus Nut", I will be making this soup again, I am sure.

Really good, I didn't have everything on hand so I substituted what was in my pantry.  I used Chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, and condensed milk instead of soy milk.  It turned out well and I'd make it again.

Great soup.  I modified things just a tad.  I sauteed onions, asparagus, and mushrooms in 2 cups of vegetable broth with some butter.  I then took the vegetables and moved them to a food processor and strained the remaining liquid for later use.  In the processor I combined 1 cup of 2% milk, 1 cup of whipping cream, and the yogurt.  I then added that mess to the flour mixture.  To serve, I topped with crumbled  mozarella and a pinch of dill.  Loved it.

Great flavor, perfect consistency.  The parmesan adds a great extra flavor.

I substituted some ingredients to use what I had on hand (2% milk, sour cream, chicken stock) & added 2 slices of turkey bacon in the puree.  

I'll try this again as written & this recipe goes into my "go to" quick/easy meal fixes.

Excellent.

Best asparagus soup ever.  I've substituted chicken broth for vegetable broth, regular milk for soy milk and sour cream for yogurt and it's still super yummy.  My father (chemo patient), won't eat hardly anything right now, but he ate two bowls of this soup.

This was terrific - followed the recipe exactly. I reheats very well.  Make sure you rinse your asparagus thoroughly - evidently I didn't do as good a job as I thought the first time I made this and I had a couple of gritty spoonfuls!

This is absolutely delicious, but I'll tell you what, as simple as it is, it's even more complicated than it needs to be. I found that if you boil/steam some asparagus and white onion in some broth, then add salt and pepper and puree it in the blender, add a cup of plain Greek yogurt, and stir, it tastes exactly the same! SOOO easy and so delicious.

This is probably one of the best recipes I have tried.  So creamy it tastes like it's loaded with calories, but isn't.  I used 2% milk and chicken broth.  Delicious.

This soup was EXCELLENT! I used chicken broth,  skim milk and vanilla yogurt and the flavors were perfect!!! My blender is old and not too strong so I was worried about getting a smooth consistency, but I cooked the asparagus until it was almost mushy and it blended perfectly. I've made this twice so far for friends and it's a huge hit. Thanks for the recipe!

I left a little of the aspargus puree back and added it at the end.  It really perked up the color and gave it a nice texture.

I thought this was pretty good. My husband really liked it. I think I might have used too much onion. Definitely don't go overboard on the onions, since they aren't sauteed in this recipe and can be strong. I used 2% milk instead of soy.

very good and easy recipe!  as a cooking teacher for kids 10 and under most wanted nothing to do with asparagus, but many  of my pickiest eaters enjoyed this soup--- the for flavor I would give it 4 stars but that it is so healthy is why I give it 5, the moms couldn't believe how creamy it was with so little fat---just a suggestion, try subbing the yogurt with non fat greek style, has more body and much more protein than regular yogurt--overall great recipe!

This soup tastes good and is also healthy since it doesn't have all the cream some other soups have (four stars for taste, the fifth star for being easy to make and good for you!). I chopped my asparagus first, but otherwise strictly followed directions and it came out very nice.

This was WONDERFFUL!  My boyfriend had seconds and came back for thirds!  I followed the advice of other users and avoided stringiness by chopping the asparagus into 1-inch pieces.  I used regular milk instead of soy milk, and I added a dash of nutmeg.  Being an asparagus fanatic, I used 2 lbs of asparagus, and I adjusted the amount of liquid accordingly.  I will be making this soup often!

So I thought this soup was great! Used 1%milk, nonfat plain yogurt. No parm cheese. But had great flavor. Only problem was my boyfriend thought this should be a sauce instead of a soup...he kept wanting me to put pasta in it...Will make again, possibly with pasta shells or rice in the soup.

This recipe was fantastic! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because there was no garlic in the recipe! I added two cloves of fresh garlic to the puree step and it added a whole new level of flavour. 
It was easy and delicious! Even though I had to use chicken broth instead of vegetable... NO foodstores I went to had it!
Very rich though - I'll be eating the one batch for the next week for sure.

Instead of 1/2c yogurt, I used 1/4c yogurt and 1/4c sour cream, because I LOVE the taste of sour cream.  But don't leave the yogurt out -- it adds great zip!!   I also used regular skim milk and fat-free chicken stock b/c it's what I had on hand... it turned out fantastic.  I've made it several times and always devour it.

Yum!  I used sour cream in place of the yogurt and a little bit of garlic powder when I added the salt and pepper! My seven year old said it warmed his tummy.  I can't wait to use this recipe with friends.

5 Stars ++++.  Healthy yet still creamy.  Excellent just the way it is.  Don't leave out the lemon juice.  My only hint is to make sure you puree thoroughly. Sprinkling of Parmesean on top is essential for taste also.

This is a really great asparagus soup!  I made it per the instructions except I had to substitute lime instead of lemon juice.  I gave the recipe four out of five stars because it needed a zesty note to really stand out.  I tried paprika, but it wasn't what I was looking for.  I WILL make this again, and I will just tweak the seasoning.

I usually make Cream of Aspargus Soup I but decided to give this a try. I made it early in the day and I did not care for it at ALL but as it sat in the refrigerator it did get a little better - but still very bland.  We love asparagus and you could hardly taste it.  I will stick with my Cream of Asparagus.  This is a great soup for Vegans though.  Thanks submitter.

Five stars! This soup was amazingly easy, and fun to make, even with all my subsitutions. I only had vanilla soymilk, so I had to use regular whole milk. I used chicken broth since I didn't have vegetable broth. I used Herbamarare in place of salt, too. Still came out awesome. I'm freezing half for a chilly day. =)

This was good. My first time for asparagus soup. I don't think I'm too crazy about the lemon for next time.
My husband Loves asparagus & says this is the best soup he has ever had.

This soup is incredible!  I too had problems with "strings" even though I used 3/4 cup of veg broth to simmer in for 20 minutes.  I thought I had cooked them long enough but I guess I was wrong.  All I did though was put the soup through a strainer and it was magnificent!  I also used 2% milk.  For sure a keeper and is good enough for company.

I loved it!  No problem with stringyness -- I used really young and thin asparagus.  Don't leave out the parmesan!

I thought this soup was okay.  I am a real fan of soups and an even bigger fan of asparagus, but it just wasn't the best of both worlds.  
My husband thinks it may have been the soy milk - which he despises the taste of.  I, on the other hand, love soy milk so I really don't know what it was.  Perhaps my expectations were too high...

I really enjoyed this soup and plan on making it again. I did not have the veg. broth so I used chicken instead. I will try with veggie broth next time. Also instead of Soy milk I used 1/2 cup 1% milk and 1/2 cup evoporated skim milk (makes it richer & creamer). I am also going to try with other veggies.

We love asparagus but were getting just a little tired of our usual recipes when I found this soup version - and being lactose intolerant I don't get to enjoy "creamed" soups. I made this for my husband and didn't tell him the ingredients - it was "love" at first spoonful! - Then I brought it as my addition to a friend's dinner party - it was an instant hit as the soup course to Roast Beef. When we were leaving she handed me my cleaned,empty pan and said - sorry - "I stole the rest of your soup , it was so delicious I wanted the left-overs for myself!" -  I just emailed her the recipe- Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

So easy and so fresh!  This was a great way to use asparagus.  We had a meal with this creamy soup, garlic bread and apple crisp. A nice light fall meal.

My family raved about this soup. After a late lunch, we weren't in the mood for a conventional dinner, so everyone helped themelves while watching TV. Served w/ fresh pears and a variety of crackers, it felt like comfort food. Substitutions are easy -- I was out of yogurt, so used nonfat cottage cheese (pureed). Low on Parmesan, Mozarella worked great as the primary cheese, with Parmesan as garnish. The only major change was doubling the onions. Delicous -- thanks, Nanook!

I made no changes and it was some of the finest soup I have ever had! The flavors were complex, not melded; and it was just so pleasing! I would not make this without the lemon. I used very good, low fat (not fat free), organic creamy yogurt; very fresh. But it is the RECIPE that did it! Oh... I used "Better Than Bouillon" vegetable base.....

I love asparagus and asparagus soup, but had never made it myself until I decided to try this recipe. Usually after trying a recipe I'll tweak it here and there , but this was a rare exception. The only change I made was using regular 2% milk instead of soy milk (I just personally don't like soy milk very much).

This recipe is a keeper! I am completely impressed by the full rich flavor of this soup. I used regular milk instead of soy. I've been on a quest to try all sorts of of new meals for my family and this was a hit. I served with Parmesan Cheese and a side of fresh bread.

This soup is great :) I used organic, low sodium vegetable stock. I also substituted soy milk for 2% milk and it came out great!! The yogurt gives it a beautiful texture!! It's my new, go-to recipe for asparagus soup!!

Wow, this is a REALLY good soup. I made this using asparagus from my mom's garden — she brought me a bunch and I was not sure what to do with it. Like other reviewers, I used regular milk (2%) and chicken broth, because that is what I had on hand. It is so amazing. I am on my second bowl. P.S. My mom showed me that if you peel the lower portion of the asparagus with a vegetable peeler (just the last couple of inches or so), it won't be stringy. Works for plain asparagus, and also a good tip for the soup. Thanks for a delicious recipe!!

Usually my boyfriend will eat anything I put in front of him… with this recipe, that was not the case. The flavor was odd, needed more of something. Will probably not make again. On the plus size, seemed very healthy..

This soup is fantastic.  I just used my little immersion blender in the pot to simplify -- and cut down on dishes -- and subbed chicken broth and cow's milk.  My two year old sucks this stuff down like you wouldn't believe... I always double the recipe for him, my husband, and myself, and it's gone in a day.

LOVED this soup... so easy and sooo yummy. I had co-workers asking me to bring in another batch and share it with them. I used 1% milk instead of soy, and chicken broth instead of vegetable - and it was still amazing. I would definitely make these for a starter when having guests. Yumm.

Love this soup, it is so fresh and clean tasting, as well as being beautiful. I used EVOO instead of butter, and I also added some fresh baby peas just before using immersion mixer. Served with a drizzle of evoo, fresh mint, and wedge of lemon, along with grilled sourdough bread.Yum!

Fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly. Will definately make this again and try adding different veggies to change it up. I cooked the asparagus way down too. It is creamy even with fat-free milk and fat-free yogurt. Love, love, love this recipe.

Followed this recipe as stated and gave it five stars due to the fact that it was a fairly healthy soup.  I did use whole milk in place of soy, only because that is what we have on hand.  Next time we may use Greek yogurt instead of regular yogurt to give it more bite and protein.  The plain yogurt gave it a sweeter taste.  Overall, very good!

This is a great recipe! I'd never had an asparagus soup before. The lemon adds a great light flavor, as does the parmesan. I cooked the asparagus until the tips were coming apart and it was mushy. I had cut off the bottom inch or two before cooking, and then cut them in half to make things easier. I also used my immersion blender when done which had the soup ready to serve in less than two minutes. I used Chobani plain greek yogurt and used about half of the cup. Overall GREAT tasting soup.

I'm not sure how to rate this one, it was fun to make but I didn't like the flavor. I could taste the yogurt & it was too much for my taste. I did use plain greek yogurt & am not sure if that's why the flavor was too strong for me. My husband really enjoyed it though. I also had problems with the flour clumps but it doesn't specify the size of pot to use & I think a large pot was too big, causing the flour/butter to be too thin. Maybe try a regular saucepan.

Awesome quick recipe!  I got an immersion blender for Christmas so I simply combined everything and pureed it in the pot.

Received a good amount of compliments.  Would definitely make it again!

Awesome recipe!!  Next time I make it I think I will add a little shrimp.  It was everything I had hoped it would be.  One of our favorite restaurants serves a Shrimp and Asparagus Soup and I think this recipe would be even more perfect with a little shrimp.

Very nice! I made with chicken broth and used half soy and half 2%. I would definitely try it again.  I will make double the recipe and add the milk when I thaw and reheat.

Use LOTS of no salt seasonings along with required salt. Asparagus tends to be a bit bland so I let the soup sit for a day before serving and it was terrific! I used nonfat greek yogurt and I was quite pleased with the results.

The addition of tangy, thick greek yogurt and lemon juice really does brighten this dish. And our favorite Sartori Parmesan (omg is this stuff good!) just took it over the top.  Thanks so much for sharing... it's now one of our favorite tastes for Spring.  :o)

This is fairly easy to make, and tasty. My biggest complaint was that it was pretty salty. I used just the 1 tsp. of salt the recipe for, but I think because I used a chicken stock instead of the veggie stock, the salt in the bullion probably added too much extra saltiness. My advice would be to cut down on the salt in the flour mixture if you are adding bullion that has been made with salt. Some reviews said people who don't like asparagus will like this soup; I don't see how since it is *very* asparagusy. This, however, is not a problem for me, since I love asparagus. If you do, too, try this recipe as a new way to cook it!

DELISH!  This reminded me of split pea soup without all the starchiness.  (hope that doesn't ruin it for anybody! LoL)  Based on what I had on hand, I used 1/2 skim milk and 1/2 half&half, and used sour cream for the yogurt.  Sooo good.  Made this for lunch today and I do believe I will finish the whole pot myself - it's THAT good!  (the recipe doesn't say, but definitely cut your asparagus up before putting in the pot)

This is one of the most delicious thing I have ever tasted! I made it for the first time today and just changed a couple of things. I didn't have vegetable broth so I used fat free chicken broth instead. Also I put an additional cup of chicken broth and that way the consistency was perfect to my taste. The flour was lumpy in my case too and I just fixed it with adding the flour mixture (butter, flour, broth and milk) into vegetable mixture and blend them one more time in the food processor. And the result was just yummy!!!! Thank you for the recipe..

This soup was awesome.  I made the soup as is with just a couple of exceptions.  I steamed the asparagus and onion, then used an immersion blender which made the blending very quick and easy.  I also used chicken broth and skim milk, and added the juice of half a lemon.  I used a shaved parmesan on top which totally completed the soup!  It was awesome!

This soup was fantastic! I've been making soups for years and have been known to spend hours trying to make the flavors come together. This was quick and easy. I used chicken broth, and greek yogurt. (on hand).
Thanks for the recipe!

This was really great!  Just make sure to puree long enough in the blender.  Also, I substituted skim milk for soy, chicken broth for vegetable, and soy flour for regular (to keep it gluten free) and it still turned out wonderfully.  Recommend this recipe whenever asparagus is on sale :)

I mistakenly thought I was thawing some homemade chicken stock, but it turned out to be cream of celery soup.  I used it in the recipe, with no regrets.  Next time, though, I'll sauté the onions and steam the asparagus in water.  Then, I'll do step #2 with the soup, add the asparagus, onions, and milk and purée everything together.

This soup is already low in fat, but I cut some more fat by using no fat greek yogurt, skim milk, and omitted the cheese.  I made my kids, ages 7 and 3 something else for dinner since they don't like asparagus.  They ate their dinner first, then saw what we were eating and asked if they could try some...and they liked it and had their own bowl!

This was so great! I didn't have any Parmesan cheese but it was still delicious. I did keep about 1/3 of my cooked asparagus and onion out and added them into the soup whole. It give you something to chew.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I also used skim milk, and had no fresh onions so I used a tablespoon of onion flakes.  It was delish.  My husband is just so/so with asparagus and he loved it.  It looked beautiful and tasted fantastic.

This soup is creamy and delicious! Just as good when made vegan. I had to add a bit more veggie broth when blending the vegetables to make them smoother.

This was a decent soup, but I couldn't really taste the asparagus - it just tasted like a generic pureed green vegetable soup. I did like the addition of yogurt and lemon at the end to add some brightness to the taste, so I may incorporate that into other recipes, but it just seems like a waste to use fresh lovely asparagus in a soup where you can't even taste it.

Excellent!  I used the Greek yogurt Total since it's thicker and I used only a dash of milk but added a dollop of sour cream.  I didn't use the cheese but I think the sour cream and Greek yogurt helped give it a creamy taste. I added a little thyme (since I think the combination with that herb and asparagus is delicious).

When my husband came inside from doing yard work and was told he was getting SOUP for lunch he was NOT happy... BUT this soup is so yummy he got over it.  LOVE IT.  So glad it's asparagus season right now.

Maybe it was the color but this was off putting in appearance and I didn't feel it tasted that good. Ate it the first night, did not like.

Absolutely wonderful!!!  I added some garlic powder and a little extra vegetable broth.  I also used my imersion blender, which made it very easy.  One of my favorites.  I'll definitely be making this again and will likely try it with other veggies.

I also used an immersion blender - this was the fastest, best tasting soup ever!  I used skim milk and fat free chicken broth with light sour cream.  I had some day-old french bread, so tossed with some olive oil, spices and baked to make some tasty croutons to go on top. My husband though he went to heaven!

Great soup...only giving it four stars because I didn't have a blender! Thought we did, but accidently left it in storage. Im sure its better blended to thicken and spread flavor.   Pretty easy soup to make and with skim milk its fairly healthy, but tastes rich & creamy (even using 2% yogurt). Will try again once I have a blender handy :)

Omigawd. Best. Soup. EVER. I am currently eating this and I am SO happy!! I had my doubts about half way through, but this soup makes me proud to be a vegetarian! I followed the recipe "to a T" and it worked beautifully. Used unsweetened soy milk (can't see it tasting as nice, with regular) and plain nonfat yogurt. THE BEST.

Very yummy!  However, I tend to make recipes with things I already have in my pantry so I substituted a few things: lime juice for lemon, chicken stock for veggie, nonfat milk for soy, mozzarella cheese for parmesan.  Even with all of these substitutions, it was great!  It was very fresh tasting!

Great soup. I replaced the butter with olive oil, and the rice milk with nonfat milk.  Also used nonfat yogurt and more pepper than the recipe called for. Light and healthy!

This was the second time I made this soup.  The first time turned out much better, as I used just top-halves of asparagus stalks and steamed the asparagus ahead of time.  The texture was perfectly smooth the first time around.   This time, I used grilled asparagus (from last night) the grilled flavor is overpowering instead of a nice incorporation.  It also gives the soup too much texture.  Apparently I didn't cut enough of the bottoms off, because this time, the soup is really stringy.  My advice, don't use grilled asparagus and be sure to only use the top-halves of the stalks...  I'll make this again, like I did the first time.  I love the edge the yogurt gives it and I think the parmesan at the end makes the soup.  It's the easiest soup recipe I've ever tried.

Wonderful soup! Would change the minds of Asparagus haters.  I used 3/4c of milk and 1/4c heavy cream instead of the Soy milk, but otherwise didn't change a thing.  I will be making this again...often.

Really creamy, smooth, buttery, and, oh yeah asparagus.  Followed the recipe exactly and really liked it.  The parmesan really works well.  Paired nicely with sauvignon blanc.  thanks for this one.

This was outstanding!  Every time asparagus goes on sale, I buy extra so I can make this soup.  I'll snap the stalks, cut off the woody ends,  and freeze them till I have enough...can you ever really have enough?  I use about 5 bundles of ends...THEN cook them down in the chicken broth with the onion.

Yummy!  Took the advice of others and steamed the broccoli first.  Didn't come out stringy at all, thanks.  Doubled the recipe and it was delicious.  Never had asparagus soup and was a bit hesitant but I had a lot of asparagus I needed to use up.  Very creamy and tasty.

Really nice flavor from a relatively simple recipe. I was impressed with the deep and rich taste considering there are very few ingredients. For the review who made mention of a 'stringy' consistency; try using thin asparagus or if not available, cut off the thick fibrous tips or consider peeling the outer fibrous layer.

Loved It!  I did also include broccoli, since I had it on hand, and really loved the flavors.  I did use whole milk, chicken stock, and added a dollop of sour cream to top it off and for garnish. It added a dash of creaminess.  Whole family (including my 21 month old) asked for seconds.

This soup was amazing!!  This was my first time making asparagus soup and this recipe was very easy to follow.  Make sure to cut the asparagus ends off.  When cooking the asparagus, onions, and broth, I made sure the asparagus was very tender so it would puree well.  I did not have any soy milk on hand so I used skim milk instead.  Asparagus is on sale again this week so I'm going make this soup and freeze it!

FANTASTIC! So easy and so nutritious. Asparagus was on sale so I bought 3 bunches. Used both bunches in the recipe, but replaced the yogurt with sour cream. Do zest some lemon (peels) when serving and a couple of drops of tobasco sauce - contrasts very nicely, nice presentation.

tastes good but a little too salty... maybe b/c of the vegetable broth. added more soy milk ... about a cup or two... made it smoother~

Good soup and easy.  I used chicken broth instead of vegetable and I think it gave it a lot of flavor; good thick texture.  Would make again.

Made this twice in the week. I thought the lemon juice and yogurt were a little weird but it gave the soup a nice tang. The parmesan on top was so good.

I have made this recipe many times and it has always turned out great but i haven't tried it with Soy milk. I use 1% or skim milk. I passed it on to a friend who loved it also and said it was 2 points on WW.

This is one of my all time favourite soups.  Excellent flavour.
I have to take a star away because of the stringy fibers.
Perhaps I'm doing something wrong but I find it a bit unpleasant.
If someone can tell me how to prepare it without the fibers, I'd make this soup every day.

Fantastic!! Some minor changes. I doubled the recipe, used all chicken broth instead of vegetable broth (2 cans total). Used only 1 c. plain unsweetened silk brand soy milk, and used 1 pkg. (12.3 oz.) firm style SILKEN tofu instead of yogurt. I also added some raw broccolli to the simmering broth as I had some on hand. The tofu made it really rich and creamy! Healthy and really great tasting the whole family loved it! We will have this one often. You gotta try this recipe, its the perfect time of year for a rich creamy soup! The tofu really made it creamy, as though it had heavy cream in it! My hubby cannot have dairy, so this was a superb recipe for him.

This soup was DELICIOUS!  I did not have high hopes for an asparagus soup, but I found myself wanting it again and again.  Plus it was easy; the only ingredient I had to buy just for this recipe was the asparagus.

I can't believe how good this was.  My girlfriend and I love it.  I will definitely make this again.

I used  regular milk instead of soy milk and chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, but that was just because I had those things around.

We thought this soup tasted great. We had it with grilled ham and cheese sandwiches -- delicious meal! I followed the recipe exactly and it was pretty easy to make. The only slightly difficult part was making sure it was being stirred at various points while also adding ingredients. Tasty meal when asparagus is on sale :-)

I am on a liquid diet (after jaw surgery last week) and this was just excellent! I added a bit of cream to the milk since I am not watching calories. If I had to change anything at all next time, it would be to use 2x as much asparagus -- I'm not sure how that would affect the consistancy, but I would like a bit more asparagus (rather than cream) taste. Of course this issue could have been caused by the cream I added!

This soup was wonderful!  I skinned the asparagus spears for a creamier puree, substituted low fat milk for the soy milk and used low fat yoghurt.  I didn't have parmesan cheese so substituted with romano and it was fantastic!

Wow!  I finally found a great way to use all of the Spring time asparagus.  My husband and I had this for dinner last night and it was delicious and so easy to make.  I substituted fat free yogurt for regular and used light soy milk and it still tasted great.  Thank you for this great recipe!

My very Favorite of all time recipe!
I have found one thing though, If I use just plain vegtable broth, instead of a boxed organic type I grabbed one time, it just doesnt taste right.  I think the name is Imagine vegtable broth.  
I also use regualar milk, and 3/4 cup of Parmesan.

Thanks so much!

Absolutely awesome! Used low sodium chicken broth instead of vegetable broth and 1% milk instead of soy. This recipe motivated me to freeze some asparagus while it's in season so we can enjoy this year 'round. Thanks Nanook!

Delish, and so easy!  Guests loved it!  Did not have any half n half so I subbed butter and milk.  I also pureed it at the end to thicken it, was delicious and I will be making it again.

Delicious!!  I used unsweetened almond milk and chicken broth and the flavor was fantastic.  I used the food processor to puree the veggies, and it came out nice and smooth.  I'll be making a double batch next time!!  Thanks for sharing!!

This soup is a winner! I had almond milk so I used it instead of soy. The second time I made it  I  added finely chopped yellow and orange peppers. I’ll definitely make this again.

Really good and easy.  I added a medium shallot and a stalk of celery I had leftover, and skipped the soy milk.  I didn't weigh the asparagus but used 2 avg sized bunches w/ white parts discarded.

I absolutely hate food wastage, so have several freezers. One is always being today to discard the parts of veggies that are not well edible, but I threw the snapped-off stringy parts of quite a lot of asparagus into the freezer for when I would want to make asparagus soup. This recipe appealed to me for its simplicity, but I don't cook with a microwave, nor do I see the point of putting garlic powder into a soup instead of the real thing. It's different with salad dressings and such. So I changed it considerably. I stewed up my frozen asparagus ends into a nice broth into which I dissolved a veggie stock cube. I used more of this than the recipe calls for. I had about a pound and a half of frozen asparagus that needed using. I chopped it into inch-long pieces  and after sautéing them and the chopped onion and garlic,  I whizzed it up with my immersion blender. I also don't think much of using skim milk or 2% in cooking. Other reviews had mentioned the need for some tartness in an otherwise good soup, and as I had both leftover Greek yoghurt and frozen lemon peel, I added that, as well leftover cream that needed using, and a good teaspoon of dill and one of salt. Everyone loved the soup and I will definitely make it again, possibly trying lemon juice instead of the peel next time.

So good. I had so much asparagus and never made asparagus soup so thought I’d give it a try. My kids liked it too.  I added chili powder to this because I add that to everything.

Excellent soup! I made twice the amount and it happened that several friends turned up, so I had enough to go around They all loved it - particularly the subtlety of the various flavors blending together! I was faithful to the recipe, only substituting Greek Yogurt for regular. You definitely need to remove the more woody parts, and I found that it helps to cut the asparagus into third lengths so that they all fit under the liquid: and keep cooking till soft (mine took around 12 minutes to be soft enough to puree).

I made it with the ingredients, however,  I substituted skim milk for  of soy milk, almond flour instead of white flour and Greek plain yogurt.  It is truly a delicious recipe!  This will always be my go to recipe for Asparagus Soup.

I’ll make this again!  it is delicious!  I did substitute 2% milk for the soy milk.  I made sure woody bottoms were off before steaming vegetables, cooking them in broth would work just as well. I didn’t have enough liquid for the emulsion tool to work, the food processor did the job well. I also used Better Than Broth Vegetable Base, 11/2 tsp in 11/4 c water.

Sooooo good! I'm happy, content and full from this delicious soup fit for company. Ok, I followed the recipe as much as I could, but used greek yogurt, 2% milk, and lime juice instead of lemon because those were the ingredients I had on hand. I also used my Vitamix set to the soup setting, after sautéing the veggies. Then followed the rest of the directions as stated. Seriously, I'm over the moon how great this tastes! Go for the Greek yogurt, I was happy that's all I had! I feel like it added a fair amount of protein to the soup. Ahhhhh, now to go have some more!

Made it three times using only the onion, asparagus, chicken broth simmer , then a sort of browning the butter with flour s & p, and adding back in the asparagus simmer to thicken, then added juice of half a lemon.  Put a sprinkle of shredded parmesan in bowl before ladling soup in.  Fantastic taste of summer.

I took this to a party and everyone loved it!. (I made a double batch) I probably used more onion then called for, accidentally used lime instead of lemon juice but that tasted great and used Fat Free Organic Milk in place of soy. I took one star away because I could not get the asparagus to puree in the blender, it did nothing. So I had a hand chopper from Pampered Chef and that worked great. After I made the flour mix, I just mixed everything in the crockpot and let it cook on med. for the morning. Made transportation easy also. Everyone asked for the recipe!

I'm not big on soy milk so I used regular 2% milk. I also used chicken broth as I didn't have veg. This is one of my favorite soup recipes.  It freezes well for lunches too!

I skipped adding any kind of milk. No Yogurt or sour cream. I added three cloves of chopped garlic and one bay leaf. I used two packets of Herb-Ox Chicken bullion and one block of vegetable bullion. Three cups or water and I used thin asparagus, After simmering for 30 minutes, I removed the bay leaf and pureed the remaining ingredients.. Back into the pot and I added the reserved tips and  reheated the soup slowly. Ten minutes later it was ready and the tips were still crisp.   It was delicious, low calorie, and satisfying.

I used whole milk and greek yogurt to make it extra creamy. Turned out perfect! Very easy to make, and if you cut up the tough ends small before blending, it is an excellent way to avoid having them go to waste.

Because there are only 2 of us, I did cut the recipe down..  I basically followed the directions...but ran into a problem with a stick blender and had to haul out my regular food processor, even though the asparagus was cut in small pieces.  I left out the onions  and the flavor worked quite well.  We used regular cow's milk in the soup.  Fortunately I forgot to use salt when I made the thickener, as the vegetable broth we had (Better than Bullion) was saltier that I expected, so there was plenty of salt in the soup.

The taste of this once done right is 5 stars, but there were not enough directions to make it correctly the first time.  As others have noted, it was too stringy.  I simply strained mine, but next time I will not use the ends and possibly cook the asparagus longer.  I also substituted regular milk for the soy milk, added a bit of lemon zest and about 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes for another layer of flavor.  I will definitely make again as per my adjustments!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This recipe should not be as good as it is considering how easy it was to make. Used plain Greek yogurt and almond milk. Also added the parm directly into it at the end. This soup is outstanding.

Easily my favorite soup recipe. I use normal cow's milk and don't add lemon, but everything else I follow exactly by the recipe. Perfect served with crusty bread

I made this for a ladies luncheon and it went over with rave reviews. My husband loved it as well. I followed the directions except substituted chicken broth and used regular milk instead of soy. Used my Vita Mix to purée and all went fine, not stringy. Will definitely make this again.

I felt like this recipe needed a little bit more so I added blended broccoli, Celery and kidney beans and instead of lemon I used honey. Was amazing.

This is my new favorite recipe! I have yet to add the yogurt, lemon, and parmesan because it tastes so good before I even get to that that I just stop there, but I always break off the woody part of the asparagus stems.  This is a perfect Fall/Winter soup which goes great with a crusty baguette. From kids to old folks, so far only high praises for this recipe.

This is so good. My soup also turned out a bit stringy, but I didn't mind. I used 2% milk instead of soy milk, and used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth.

I substituted cream for soy milk, used sea salt, and added about a tablespoon of lemon juice.  It was really yummy!  I have left overs in my fridge and I can't wait to eat them for dinner.  Next time I'll try Greek yogurt as suggested by another reviewer.

Loved the flavor and creaminess! I chopped off the bottoms of the asparagus and simmered for a while due to the "stringy" reviews, but next time I think I'll strain the purée before adding it to the broth. I changed a few things too... I added 3 cloves of garlic to the asparagus/onion/broth simmer and used chicken broth instead. I also added a little extra butter cause my roux seemed too dry with all the flour! I also added a dash of red pepper flakes to the roux/broth mixture for a little kick and some more depth. I used Greek vanilla yogurt and 1% milk cause that's all I had, and it turned out great! I also used half of a very juicy lemon because I love that tang. Was amazed by the creaminess and flavors! Will make again.

This soup is silky and light and very tasty. Immersion blender helped with the blending.. much better than a regular blender. 
Would not hesitate to offer it to my guests at a dinner party.

I used water instead of vegetable broth because i didn't have any on hand and so I had to add little bit of chicken bouillon to give it some more flavor.  it was a little grainy even though I pureed it in the blender for a long time.  Maybe it had to do with the asparagus.  Other than that, my dad loved it and it was a healthy soups (sans the butter) that I may try again.

A creamy asparagus soup that feels light and crisp. Simple and easy to prepare.  I made it with 2% milk and fat free greek yogurt and the result was fantastic (coming from someone who does not care much for cream based soups). My family loved it too! Will do over and over again for sure. Must try!

I made this tonight only subbing the vegetable broth for chicken stock and used 1% milk vs soy milk and added a little minced garlic.  Served this with a grilled ham and swiss sandwich and it made a very filling meal.  My children even thought it was delicious. I only gave the recipe 4 stars because I did sub some ingredients and I think that made the difference. As written I only give it 4. With the changes definitely a 5.

Great recipe - just what I was after.  Don't overdo the lemon juice - you can always go back and add more for balance.  I used College Inn white wine & herb broth, almond milk (instead of milk) added freshly ground nutmeg and garnished with toasted whole almonds and oyster crackers...truffle butter and Trader Joe's truffle salt made this a gourmet treat!

I didn't have enough asparagus but I needed to use what I had. I followed the directions and everything turned out perfect. Very tasty. Definitely make it again.

This was delicious!! I followed the recipe to the letter and it came out perfect! I'm saving this for sure!! I love how easy it is too, very easy simple steps. I was reading some other comments and am going to try the broccoli instead of the asparagus too, that sounds like it will be great!

I've made this twice already and it is awesome. The last time I made the mistake of using too much fresh lemon juice and it sorta killed the taste. A little goes a long way. It's the only way I'll eat asparagus now. Don't forget to eat with a spoonful of sour cream on top!

I have been making this soup for years using the recipe as written except using 2% milk. Today I made it with broccoli instead of asparagus. I reduced the amount of parmesan and added shredded sharp cheddar and both my husband and I like it even more than the asparagus version.

compared to other aspargus soups I have tried, this was descent. The asparagus I used were the larger kind and it took 15-16 minutes to cook. When I measured out my yogurt I realized I only had 1/4 cup left. That amount worked fine. I usually cut the amount of yogurt in half in smoothies anyhow, because I find the taste dominant. I didn't have soy milk, so I used an equal amount of low-fat milk. I followed everything else as it, but to lower the sodium I used 1 no-sodium vegetable bouillion cube for the whole recipe and cut the amount of salt to 1/2 a teaspoon. It was plenty! I like soups that include the garnish, and these garnishes worked well taste wise. Just time wise, with all of the components, it does take a bit of preparation and clean-up. Also note, if for presentation purposes, the asparagus does sink pretty quickly.

This was sooo good.  I added about 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper as well when I made the roux, because we like it a bit spicy.

Soooo Good! I made a few changes. For me I like my soup spicy so I added one jalapeño with the seeds at the beginning with the asparagus and onions.  I also used Steak seasoning for the "ground Pepper".  Finally I used Greek non-fat yogurt and non fat milk.  I will definitely make this over and over again.

Did I miss the part about simmering the asparagus first?...
Also, I must have missed the part about putting the flour/butter mixture together with the vegetables ...
Assuming that's where they go?!
I use a website like this because I am not a trained chef, I need to know all the details.
 I found this recipe very disappointing :-/

We loved this, but it was stringy.  I used an immersion blender.  Maybe next time I'll use a blender.  The flavor is definitely five stars; I'll work on the texture.

Just made this recipe for the first time.  It's great!  I love being able to indulge in a creamy soup without having to feel guilty.  It was very easy.  Also used skim milk in place of soy, chicken broth when I ran out of vegetable broth, and greek yogurt; also used an immersion blender. Will definitely make again.

I used vitamin D milk instead of soy milk and sour cream instead of yogurt.  I pureed the mixture after adding the flour and butter to get rid of the chunks.  It turned out very flavorful.

It was really good. I liked the flavors together. I used frozen asparagus and skim milk. It would have been better with fresh, but I wanted to use up what I had in the freezer. Overall, this soup is delicious.

This is excellent and easy! I used chicken broth,1% milk and cream cheese because that is what I had on hand. The method was easy and so fast! I used the fresh asparagus I didn't use at Easter! I will make it again & again! Thank you

This was a great way to use up the value sized bundle of asparagus I got on an impulse. Very tasty flavor and I see a lot of potential for different directions. My one problem was the strands of asparagus fibers that never blended, but that may be because I had tough asparagus and a basic blender. Next time I'll strain before adding the veggie mixture. I also added rosemary and thyme, which was nice. Will be re-attempting :)

This was the BEST soup I have ever had!! It was so flavorful and delicious! I served this to a few friends who absolutely hate asparagus, and even they loved this soup. The flavor combination is truly exquisite! And it's not that unhealthy either! I used nonfat greek yogurt instead of regular to up the protein. It also wasn't that hard to make. I'll certainly be making this recipe again and again!

I loved the soup, my 8 month old loved it too, my 3 and 4 year olds didn't touch it because it was green, but I'm sure they would haved loved it. Here's what I found: I had to double the yogurt and a decrease the salt to 1/2 teaspoon. Other than that, so yummy.

Cooking is always challenging for me but even I was able to nail this soup! I followed the recipe  as indicated except that I used skim milk instead of soy. I was also nervous because I do not have a blender but I used my Magic Bullet & aside from having to puree in small batches - it worked great! I love this soup & intend to make it again tonight. My only complaint was it lacked a bit of flavor for me - but I sprinkled some lemon pepper on it and it was AMAZING! Healthy and easy!

this soup rocked! so fresh and lovely. easy too. 

here's what i changed: i cut up the asparagus and boiled it in 1 c of broth along with the onions and 1 clove of garlic. i let it cool before i poured it into the blender. 
i SLOWLY added the flour to the butter as to avoid lumps and stirred continuously. success: no lumps. if you get a bit lumpy, add a bit of broth and work them out. 
i used nonfat milk and sour cream. next time i'll use 1/4 c. sour cream. it'll still be creamy.the lemon created a nice balance in flavors. 
a nice light oil garnish would rock. i'll try hazelnut next time. 
easy to make and it totally taste great.

Very nice.  Added a dash of cumin at the end and gave it a lot more flavor.

This was delicious!  So easy to make!  I subsituted soy milk for lactose free milk.  I also added extra vegetable broth to mix in my blender easily.  Also added extra lemon.

My husband fixed this for Mother's Day and it was creamy, tasty and comforting.  He said he left out the milk (oversight) but the end result was still good and a nice medium consistency.

I made this soup for the first time, last night for a Mother's Day dinner party.  It was a huge hit! A definite "do again" for my family and friends.  I added about 1/4 cup white wine at the very end to thin the soup a tiny bit.  Yum, yum.   It wasn't stringy as some of the reviews noted, but I blended mine in the food processor to begin with, then when all was mixed together in the soup pot at the end I blended again with the submergable hand blender.

I made this last night.  For a lowfat soup or any soup, I think it's one of the best I've ever had!  I dislike soy milk so I used 1% milk & had an open carton of low-sodium chicken broth so used that instead of the vegetable broth.  DELICIOUS!

I followed the directions exactly, only cut up the asparagus into 2 inch pieces to cook.  It was perfect.  I had no problem with strings or anything...it was delicious.  I will try it with broccoli as someone suggested.

This is great! I used about 16 big white asparagus, bottoms snapped off. Sauteed in 1/2 C veggie broth. Meanwhile did the butter/flour/rest of broth (1.5 C- I just did 2 cups water total with a boullion cube then split it up) in another pot. I mixed it all together with the milk, using an immersion blender, then added yogurt and lemon juice (about half a large lemon), with pepper. No salt, boullion is already salty. Very good! Much easier that the recipe implies.

This was my first try....I would use more asparagus and/or less parmesan next time.  The cheese was a little overpowering.

Nice recipe. I enjoy making vegetarian soups at home to avoid the fact that restaurants often use chicken stock.   This came together easily. Pureed with an immersion blender. Used bouillon instead of home made or canned stock. Worked well. Fat free milk and yoghurt. Would consider making this for my gluten free friends, sans the roux. It's a fairly thick soup on its own and I doubt the flavor would be much altered with this change.   Thanks for sharing!

I enjoyed this soup but my husband said it was missing something. I had problems with it being stringy but next time I will try cutting the asparagus into smaller pieces and cooking them a little longer. The only changes I made was that I used 1% milk instead of soy and I don't usually use flour to thicken so I replaced it with cornstarch. Next time I think I will add some garlic.

I think starting with the roux is the brainstorm of this recipe...I've tried other asparagus soup recipes that didn't get as creamy. I used organic chick broth, and I tweaked the liquid quanitities with what I had in my fridge, so instead of soy milk and 1 cup of yogurt, I added more broth, 1% milk, half n half, and a 1/4 cup of yogurt.  Delicious.

I made this for my boyfriend and we both LOVED it!  I'm not even a huge fan of asparagus and I can't wait to make it again.  It's a heavy soup, so don't use it as an appetizer, but it makes a great side dish.

Really enjoyed this except I'd recommend half the yogurt and lemon. I tasted it just before these additions and it was a five in my books but then the last 2 ingredients made it too tangy. Also I used 2/3 asparagus and 1/3 broccoli and omitted the parmesan cheese. Thank you....definitely will use again.

Great! A very light soup, the parmesian blends so well with it! I was actually skeptical that the asparagus flavor would overpower the whole thing but it didnt.  Def one that my husband and I would eat again, try it with the chicken with asparagus and mushrooms recipe also on allrecipes.com

Omg! I made this for my daughter tonight. She loved it...then I tasted it and ended up having a bowl myself. Who knew asparagus soup could taste so good. I did use vanilla yogurt by accident, but it was still delicious. Next time I will be sure to try the plain yorgurt.

this was absolutely delicious. i added a bit of minced garlic in with the vegetables, and upped the liquid (used 2 cans of veggie broth--one can with the veggies, one can in the second half). this was unbelieveably good--so easy and healthy and fresh.

This was delicious and surprisingly simple to make.  I did not add the yogurt because I did not have any on hand and it still turned out fine!

This was really simple and good...the name says it all. It tastes fresh. Only change I made was to use regular skim milk instead of soy milk. Yummy and healthy! Thanks for sharing!

i followed the recipe exactly and turned out just like the picture.. it didn't taste bad.. but i didn't know what to make out of it... even my bf who is not at all picky wasn't very impressed.. it's creamy but the taste of yogurt in it was just weird for me..

Very easy recipe and great flavor, I thought it was going to be a bit bland, but it was great.  I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, and it turned out great.

Lovely soup.  I am a novice soup maker, and found this easy to make.  My only substitution was 2% milk instead of soy.  Freezes well also.

Well the writer is right... everyone does love this soup.  I was a little cynical when I was making it, because it didn't really smell good and it definately didn't look good.  The taste however was awsome.  Great recipe... I'm a believer now.  I used 2% milk because I didn't have regular soy milk and thought the parmasean was one of the best parts.

Very good soup! It was a little bit more work than I thought but it was worth it. I boiled the veggies until they were very very soft and it was not stringy at all after pureeing. I also added a little bit of garlic because we love it! Used 2% milk and homemade yogurt. One reviewer said that it is good with broccoli too so I want to try that next. Yummy creamy soup!

Excellent soup!  I've made this one twice already.  I like to add a can or two or corn to it at the end. Also I use cornstarch which I prefer to flour because less is required.

Delicious soup that is creamy without the cream. I used 2% milk instead of soy milk, because that was what I had. Also left off the parmesan, as I was serving it with cheese biscuits (Ceddar bay from this site). It was delicious. Thanks!

Delicious!  Followed it exactly, and it turned out so yummy.  Instead of just using the tops for garnish, I chopped them in thirds and threw them into the soup.  It needed to be thickened up a bit at the end, so I added some cornstarch and water.  I will DEFINATELY make this soup again and again.  :)

This was excellent.  Simple changes made to use what we had on hand were sour cream instead of yogurt, chicken broth rather than vegetable broth & regular milk instead of soy milk.  We added extra sour cream & it was divine. Would make this for anyone.  My 16 year old loved it.

I am a HUGE fan of asparagus, so I ate this breakfast, lunch and dinner! I used a leek instead of an onion, 1% milk, and white pepper instead of black. I also added a dash of onion flakes, and dill weed. YUM.

I followed previous reviewers' suggestions and used a stick blender and added cumin and garlic.  Easy, tasty, low-fat soup.  Will definitely make again, using the base recipe, with potatoes, and with broccoli instead.  Versatile recipe.

This was a delicious soup.  I was surprised at how creamy it was with so few milk products.  It was pretty tart though, so next time I'll use less lemon juice.

Made this following the instructions to a T but wasn't a fan of the result. I think the parmesan cheese was overpowering but not sure if removing it would improve this soup. Thanks for sharing but I don't think I'll be making this again.

The whole family loved it...even my three year old!  I used my immersion blender and mixed it all at the end together as others had suggested.  I did not have yogurt on hand so I used 1/2 cup of lowfat cottage cheese.  I also used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth and fat free milk.    Will definitely make this again!!

Made it for a group with several vegetarians.  It was pretty good.  The soy milk gave it a little different flavor, so I might use a little less next time, but overall it was nice with a fresh salad.

Very good, doesn't need anything though I did add rosemary.  I think anything else would overpower the simplicity of this spring soup, thanks for the recipe!

Very good. I actually preferred the soup without the parmesan, because I thought that it overpowered the taste of the asparagus.

I like asparagus.  So when I saw this recipe I had to give it a shot even though I was a little concerned if I'd like it.  But it was awesome.  Only changes I made was organic skim milk, Horizon brand fat free yogurt, and chicken broth instead of veggie broth (it's what I had on hand). The nice thing about this recipe is that I can make a big batch and come home from work at noon and heat up a bowl.  Then lunch is served.

AMAZING soup! It's just to die for! I love the fact that this recipe is vegetarian! There is no guilt associated with eating it or serving it to your friends and family. It has a wonderful smooth and creamy texture and the asparagus flavor is fresh lively! Its a spring time favorite at our house. Thanks for the great recipe!

Wow, what a great soup.  I used half asparagus, half broccoli and substituted milk for soymilk.  We ate it lukewarm with a tomato and walnut salad and crusty bread.  Will definitely make again.

I used the soy milk as suggested and replaced the other dairy ingredients with their soy counterparts and this soup was a complete disappointment.  It tasted like warm soy milk with a hint of asparagus.  We added numerous ingredients to try to salvage it but it was barely edible.  Very disappointing after such rave reviews.

Oh man! I am eating this right now and it's great! I love asparagus and creamy soups, but I wasn't sure how this would come out. But bam! I used 3/4 cup broth to simmer the veggies in (cause I had 2 cups) and 1/2 tsp more lemon juice. I also accidentally got sweetened plain yogurt, but the subtle sweet accent is not without it's charm. I bet sour cream would be good too. Thanks!

A good way to insure no stringiness is to break off the tough bottom part.  Hold the stalk end and snap it off where it starts to be pliable.  Very easy and quick, or very "snappy!"

Delicious!!!! Loved it even though my food processer also couldn't get it quite smooth....I'll have to get the imulsion blender as mentioned in previous reviews. I agree it is hardy enough for a meal on it's own also. Thanks!

This soup needed way more liquid!  I did use a little more asparagus than the recipe called for, but the amount of broth this called for wasn't even close to enough.  When I was cooking the asparagus and onion, the 1/2 cup of vegetable broth boiled right off and I wound up adding more.  I didn't want to keep adding liquid that the recipe didn't call for, so I stopped cooking the asparagus before I was sure it was done, which was a bad idea, since it turned out kind of stringy.  I added extra water at several points during preparation and the soup still turned out very thick at the end.  I actually did like the flavor, but unfortunately it was so stringy that I wound up throwing it away.  If I'm brave enough to try making this again, I'll at least double the liquid and make sure to cook the asparagus very thoroughly.

I used this recipe as a basis for my first Asparagus soup.  Instead of onions, I used leeks and used 2% milk rather the soy milk.  I reserved 3/4's cup of asparagus/leek and coarsely chopped for texture. I prepared it early so it would refrigerate for at least 5 hours.  After warming it, I ladled the soup in the bowls and shaved with a vegetable peeler a couple slices of parmesan cheese and topped with a tsp of chopped almonds.  I liked using yogurt which complimented the taste.

I just made this recipe for the second time and absolutely love it.  Question. Is there any way to prevent the floss like asparagus strings? Maybe I'm not boiling it long enough. I used chicken broth becauase I did not have vegtable broth....delicious!

Delicious!  I can't believe how great this tastes using basic ingredients.   I don't have a food processor so I used a hand blender and puree the vegetables little by little.  I only had chicken stock and brown whole wheat flour so I used that.  For some reason when I added the flour to the butter, it became pasty (not sure it's suppose to be that way) but once I added more stock it liquified together.  I sprinkled grated mozzarella on top upon serving and yum!  Next time, I will use vegetable stock and top it with feta cheese.  Thanks for sharing!!

Super fantastic. This soup is packed with flavor and it all comes from the asparagus, no fancy spices. My husband raved about it and my six year old son licked his bowl clean. I sprinkled the top with some feta I had left over from the night previous and I like the slight bite that added to the dish.

Very good.  I think next time I'll try it with vanilla yogurt; the plain yogurt lent a slight tang to the flavor.  I also can't wait to try the soup with broccoli!  Thanks.

To insure a smooth soup, I used a large strainer to remove strings.  Real crumbled, cooked bacon was added as a garnish to bring more flavor.

Easy to make and very tasty!  This rivals the best asparagus soup I've had in the best of restaurants.

My husband absolutely loved this recipe - in fact he ate all of it at one sitting.  I tried it but didn't like it (I am not a huge veggie fan though).  But he said that it was very, very good.  We used regular milk and he put cheddar cheese on his.

This soup was absolutely wonderful!  Rich and creamy without a lot of hassle or time invested in making it!  I will make it again and again.

I used a very flavorful beef broth because that was what I had.  I did overpower the asparagus.  I used twice the onions and swiss cheese so it wasn't as good as it would have been, had I followed directions!

I grow asparagus and sometines have more than I can roast.   This is a great recipe for that extra batch!  It was quick to make and really rich tasting, even tho I used fat free yogurt and skim milk.  Thanks!

I followed the recipe in its entirety and it came out excellent. (Well, I added some more Parmesan cheese to top it off) Great taste and texture. I guess regular milk would have worked fine also. A hand held electric "boat" mixer helped out a great deal.
