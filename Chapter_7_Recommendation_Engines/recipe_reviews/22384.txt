Perfect everytime.  I microwave ingredients 2-5, at 2 minute intervals(stirring after each)until thickened, then add butter & vanilla.  Old-fashion taste and no scorched pots.

I have already tried to make this recipe 4 times, and each time it comes out watery and not solid, somthing must be wrong with the mesuerments.

Easy and delicious pie.  I used spelnda instead of sugar at a 50% ratio.  I'll make this again for sure. 

 For the person who said it came out watery 4 times, you need to let it boil a little bit (1-2 minutes) after it reaches a boil. til its somewhat of a pudding consistancy.  Not boiling it enough, Iis why yours came out watery, I am sure.
