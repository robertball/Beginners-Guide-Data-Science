This recipie takes a long time to pt together, but at the end of the day its worth it! The taste is full and hearty. Its a good recipie for a church pot-luck supper, since there never seems to be enough meat dishes at those events. Its also a good idea to have two people preping this recipie. enjoy!

Okay I made this with a few changes.  Here it goes!  I didn't have chicken but I had some turkey in the freezer left over from Thanksgiving I used it instead.  I didn't have the pork loin, so  I chopped up some pork chops and I didn't have the beef stew meat, so I used ground beef.  I cut the receipe in half and followed the rest of the directions.  It came out fantastic.  This is a wonderful stew. Very satisify on a cold day.  I served this stew with homemade bread right out of the oven.  Ummmm!!!!!!  ( I used the Crusty Bread Receipe from this site also.  Very good bread.)

the rutabaga makes this different, special, and great! gives any veg. soup or stew better and more flavorful. It's a shame so many people don't know it's virtues.
