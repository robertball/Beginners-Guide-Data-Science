Pretty good, but I had trouble keeping the strawberries on the skewers. And instead of the lemon marinade, I used honey, lime and soy sauce...really good. My husband and I liked these a lot and served them with rice pilaf and a nice green salad. I agree that a roasted strawberry is a real treat, too! :)

For a little bit of a contrast, add a vidalia onion or a red onion. It really compliments the fruits and chicken, making the kabobs not too sweet.

This was really good,  but we added a few things to make it more interesting.  I added onions,  just to cut the over sweetness of the whole dish,  and also parboiled some sweet potatoes,  which I diced large and added to the kabobs.  They were REALLY good with the rest of the ingredients.  My husband and children gave this one a thumbs up,  and we are serving it to some guests this weekend for a BBQ.

These are incredible Kabobs! They are really pretty and everyone loved them...I highly recommend them! Don't make more than you can eat in one day, because they don't make good leftovers, but there probably won't be any left anyway! REALLY, REALLY GOOD! (I marinated the chicken overnite...really good flavor!)

The pineapple was SO good, but the strawberries didn't have much flavor.  I think next time I'll just leave them out.  The chicken was awesome with the nutmeg.

This was really yummy! I used more cinnamon and nutmeg than listed - doing it to taste. I also used more pineapple, and some green peppers to add more color. The roasted strawberry is very yummy and different. The meat was a great flavor, tangy and sweet. It was a wonderful change in kabobs, and gave me lots of ideas. Will definitely make this again. Thanks!

I used turkey instead of chicken and it was good, too.  My husband said the marinade was a little too "lemon-y" for his taste but I liked it.  The real surprise was the strawberries!  If you've never had a roasted strawberry then you're in for a treat.  They taste really nice.  We lost a few strawberries when they fell off the kabobs and into the fire but on the whole most of them made it.  It does look exotic and is something different for guests.   A keeper!

We made this for a friendly kabob cook off and they were great! Make sure to buy really fresh strawberries (not too ripe), or they'll probably fall off. I added basil leaves to the skewers for an extra bit of flavor - fantastic. I also didn't need anywhere near a whole cup of butter to brush onto the kabobs. A half cup should do the trick. Enjoy!

I hate to put anything negative but, this was not a very good recipe. I followed the recipe completely and I was not happy with the way the chicken tasted. It had a very strong lemon flavor and the glaze did it no justice at all.

This recipe is so interesting (in a great way) The strawberries give it a nice change from the usual kabob. I agree with another member the vadalia onions are a must as they take on a sweetness when cooked. Tip for the strawberries: try to find firm ones that are less ripe as they will stay on better and not become too soggy. Delicious!

Wish I could do 4.5! These are really very good...I marinate them for at least 4 hours. Overnite is even better. This last time I used pineapple juice, honey, lime juice and a dash of soy sauce...yum! The key to perfectly cooked chicken on these is to heat the grill on high, put the skewers on and turn it to the lowest setting for about 10 minutes, turning every 1.5-2 minutes. It's funny, you either love the strawberries or you hate them! Every time I make them, half the people say they are awesome and half leave them on their plate!  Really sweet strawberries turn out best...next time I'll cut the hull's off & sprinkle them with a little sugar & put them back in the fridge before I put them on the skewers. Or I'll skip'em alltogether and try vidalia onions & pineapple (Fresh is much better than canned by far!)

Very tasty and unique.  I enjoyed these but knew that my husband would not as he hates pineapple.  The texture of cooked strawberries was definately different and the berries look a little sad when cooked but very nice flavor!!  I probably won't make these often as I am the only one who likes them in my family. (Baby is too young to eat these!)

Served this for company and just got an ok response.  Probably wouldn't make it again. Everyone liked the pineapple, the strawberries got mixed reviews (either love them or hate them) and the chicken was too bland even with doubling the spices.  Probably won't make again.

The flavor was a little boring in my opinion and the texture of cooked strawberries was not enjoyable to anybody in the family. I think it would be much better with more spices and without strawberries!

I just made these and my family and I were not impressed. The strawberries were incredibly soggy and all you tasted on the chicken was the lemon juice. I marinated for a few hours. Don't know if I'll do these again.

Excellent dish and impressive.  I modified it as follows:  1/2 cup lemon juice 1/4 cup lime juice instead of 1 cup lemon juice.  Added pearl onions to the kabob.  After trimming fresh large strawberries I sugared them and let them set for 3 hours.  Served over rice mixed with frozen baby peas.  It turned out very colorful and for Christmas Eve this year I will be substituting Scallops and jumbo shrimp for chicken and adding bellpepper.

This really was good and great for a refreshing summer dish.  I added green peppers and onion also and took the advise of another reviewer and used some soy sauce, honey, and balsamic vinegar with the pineapple juice for the marinade and then to the butter to brush on before the grill.  Very good!!

These came out much better this year than when we made them last year.  The ripeness of the strawberries made a huge difference, last year they were not that good.  I marinated the chicken overnight, 1 hour just doesn't seem like enough.  I love this dish in the summer!

They were really good but I needed metal skewers instead of wet wood ones.

Great tasting and looking. Had a little trouble keeping the strawberries on the skewers. My guests loved them.

I made this for my wife for Mother's Day.  Neither she nor my son expected to like it, but we all thought it was wonderful.  I served it with brown rice, and they went together very well.  I also served zucchini sautéed with garlic and olive oil.  My wife said it would perhaps have gone better with a spinach salad and a sweet dressing.  We will try that next time.

I added red onion like someone else suggested. I think there were too many strawberries, a little too sweet for me. My husband loved the onion, but also feels the same about the strawberries. I will try this again with less strawberries, but more onion and pineapple.

This recipe was great! The strawberries were very mushy when they were done cooking but they tasted like strawberry jam. The chicken was great also.

Made the chicken taste too sweet, almost un-cooked.

I loved the marinade for the Chicken but the strawberries didn't fare well on the grill.  I will probably make this again but I will put the strawberries on the top rack instead of on the skewer.

well, this recipe was intersting, but as others have said, the chicken was a little bland. the strawberries were an aquired taste, but overall this was good. if you are looking for something a little different to impress guests than go with this dish!

taste becomes a little overwhelming after two or three kabobs.
