The sweet potato tasted really delicious but the chicken was a little disappointing. Next time I'll use less vinegar and I'll use grape juice in stead of the very expensive pomegranate juice - I'm sure you wouldn't taste the difference. Also, I didn't read the recipe properly and cut the sweet potato into fairly small chunks but it was just right; any larger and it would have been undercooked. Unlike the previous reviewer my chicken browned nicely (skin side up, above liquid) and the dish looked lovely with the green onion and pomegranate seeds over.

We really liked this, but we just made it with chicken breasts, not the whole chicken.  The sauce is tart, which we liked, but if I made it for company, I'd definitely use less vinegar.

In response to BIDPOOL: I've had the same thing happen to me when making a pomegranate-based butter sauce. The trick is to use a non-reactive saucepan (i.e. stainless steel).

I did not care for this recipe. This turns an unappealing shade of gray when baked.

The best part were the sweet potatos and they weren't even cooked all the way through. The chicken was virtually tasteless.

I made this recipe despite the reviews, we thought it was amazing. I used white wine vinegar, and pur√©ed pomegranates instead of juice then mixed the marinate in a jar, placed chicken thighs skin down, poured half marinated in let sit for hour, then turned chicken and poured rest of marinade on, baked and came out browned and yummy.

The flavor was not bad but nothing special for us.  I had to cover the dish and increase the cooking time to get the potatoes all the way cooked and everything was the same purplish/brownish/gray color and looked very unappitizing.  Very different from the picture posted.

We followed the recipe verbatim.  The potatoes turned gray.  The flavor was unimpressing.  Everyone ate their portion, but no one asked for seconds.  I took a straw poll... this dish got a "thumbs down."
