I'm sorry to say this recipe didn't work for me. I followed the recipe with the exception of reducing the serving down to one. I was not willing to risk the wheat berries in such a large quantity just in case it didn't turn out well. So glad I did!  First - there is not enough liquid to cook for 30 minutes.  At the 30 minute time the berries were a bit soft so I proceeded. The berries never blended, they spun and spun but didn't do much else.
