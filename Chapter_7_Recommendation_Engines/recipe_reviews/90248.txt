That's a great guacamole recipe you've got going here, gigemmandy! (just add the tomatoes to it!)
I only added  garlic and (red) onion to the ground beef( no lime juice, no cilantro) but I think I would add those ingredients next time. And the combination  of guacamole with melted Monterey Jack cheese is delicious on a burger... who knew? My Mom loved hers, and I can't wait to try these on hubby when he gets back into town. By the way, this recipe was chosen as one of the weekly dishes for our cooking club on 9/3 and it went over really well. Thanks for the recipe!

These were great!  Burgers were very juicy.  Didn't change a thing.

I halved this recipe, as I was just cooking for two. The Guac was awesome. I used turkey ground instead of beef...for a healthier twist and it came  out great! (I just used a little extra lime juice because turkey meat is drier) i just eye-balled the cilantro and onions based on what we like and it came out great. My boyfriend said if I was a chef at Dos Cominos (a popular NYC Mexican restaurant) I could charge $20 for a half portion of the guac. IT WAS GREAT!

WOW!!!! We 1st tried just the burger & knew that was a 5, then we tried with the guacamole topping. These we fantastic. Didn't change a thing, but will probably add a dash of salt next time. Plain burgers are out. These are very juicy & flavorful.

I thought this was okay.  I did make some changes.  I made my own guacamole.  To the meat I added the cilantro, jalapeno, garlic and an egg.  The meat had good flavor however they fell apart on the grill.  I also stuffed the burgers with m. jack cheese slices prior to grilling.

The guacamole was really tasty but the meat kind of fell apart while cooking & didn’t have a lot of flavour. I think these burgers would be much better topped with some salsa & sour cream along with the guacamole.

I did this two ways.  First, I had patties, so about 10 minutes before putting them on the grill I sqirted them with fresh lime juice and some chili powder.  When I grilled them, I threw on some minced onion and put cheese on top; the cheese sealed in the onion.  All the meat eaters could say was...NADA!  They were too busy chewing like crazy!  I'm a vegetarian, so I did the same with a veggie grillers and it was SO good!  Thanks for a great recipe all around!

Really good flavors in this.  Next time I will add some no-salt seasoning to the burger mixture.  The guacamole has a little salt in it which is perfect for that, but the burgers were a little bland even with all the good stuff in them.  Hubby was leery about having a burger without his usual ton of ketchup, but he really liked this.  :)

This was very good  I've always used packaged guac mix and often don't like it.  The only thing I will do different next time is to use onion powder because my daughter doesn't like onion bits.  Otherwise it was great alone and/or on top of the burgers.

Wonderful! I made up the patties for these about a month ago when I found a really good sale on ground turkey. I froze the patties (putting some wax paper between each patty. These were sooo good!

Great guacamole recipe, but did not prefer the cilantro inside of the hamburger. 5 stars just on the guac recipe, but add about 2 tbls lemon juice.

Really enjoyed this one. Absolutely loaded with flavor. Made it as the recipe called for with one exception- added some cilantro to the guacamole.
This is a keeper for me

This burger was pretty good. My boyfriend like it a lot. It was a little spicy for me so next time I'm planning not to add so much jalapeno.

Great recipe but since I didn't have hamburger I used tofu instead and pita bread instead of buns and parsley instead of cilantro and artichokes instead of avocados. Other than that great as is.

Without the guacamole these wouldn't have much flavor. My burgers held together fine and the only change was to use pepper jack cheese. I mixed the meat up a couple of hours ahead of time and they still lacked enough flavor to make it worth the extra work. If I make these again I'll up the seasoning or just make plain burgers with the guacamole, which was quite good. Id rate the burger a 3 and the guac a 5 so 4 it is.

Good burgers. But don't eat the guacamole separate from the burger, as it lacks a little flavor. Thanks for sharing.

I made this into a salad, rather than serving it on a bun, just to save a few calories.  I made the burger and the guacamole as the submitter intended and I served it on a bed of lettuce with green onions and additional tomatoes.  On the lettuce portion we drizzled ranch dressing.  This was something a little different for us and we enjoyed it.

Really good burger!  We used turkey instead of beef and cut the recipe in half.  The guacamole is very refreshing on toasted buns.  Served with sangria for a nice summer meal.

These were really good but I think we would appreciate them more if we had burgers more often. We don't allow ourselves to eat many burgers & while these were good, we couldn't help but wish we were eating them our standard way. Although we LOVED the patty & will use it in our next  burger sans guacomole. We only made 3 pattys but used all the lime, garlic & onion...adding just a bit of cilantro. I did catch Gigemmandy's review so I knew to put the tomatoes in the quac (which wsa some pretty good quac BTW). I served these w/ Southwestern Cactus Salad, Jalapeno Hot Sauce & chips, White Sangria & mango ice cream for dessert.

Wow this recipe is the best. Coworker suggested that I try it and hubby and I love it since then. Now we have burger thursdays :). Only thing that I have done different was adding some seasoning to the meat. I am Jamaican so love me some seasoning on my meat. Other than that this recipe is fabulous. Yummy, making it tonight again.

We were ready to try something new in burgers so we tried this recipe - so glad we did! It was so yummy! We decided to save some time and got store-bought but freshly made guacamole and the burgers were a hit with my husband, our teenage daughter and son. This is a keeper!

I LOVED the burgers! I used my own guacamole, which is similar to the one listed here but a few differences, but the burgers were fantastic! They were moist and very flavorful, and I did not have any problems with them falling apart, which surprised me because when I make burgers with onions in them I seem to have that happen a lot, just make sure you dice them really small.  My kids loved it too, and they wouldn't put any guacamole on it, but I thought the addition of the guacamole really brought it all together. I will definitely make this a regular recipe!

We have made these burgers several times since finding this. We have tweaked it a couple of times just to change it up. For example we added a couple of slices of bacon on top. And we have switched out the Monterey Jack for some pepper jack just to give it a little bite. Every version is just as yummy as the original! Thanks for sharing!..

Excellent as a turkey burger.  I greated the onion and add more lime juice in to keep the ground turkey moist.

My husband and I have made these burgers quite a few times now and they are AMAZING! We are burger snobs, so to run across a recipe we like and don't end up altering 95%, it's a rare thing. This is by far my favorite burger.

Everyone LOVED these! Made them exactly how they should be made as noted in the submitter's review on the first page of the reviews. The cliantro and chili powder goes in the burger meat and the tomatoes go in the guacamole. Thanks so much for posting this delicious burger recipe.  UPDATE:  This is still the best burger! Love it. We paired it with the Fresh Tomato Salsa from Allrecipes.com and some chips. Thanks again for sharing!

These were ok. The burgers themselves were dry and pretty flavorless. Next time I will double the seasonings and lime juice.

This recipe gets a 5 from me because I love guacamole and the burger mixture would be excellent even without it. My husband is less of a guacamole fan than I am so he gave it a 4. I did, however, use a guacamole recipe from this website that I had already made instead of the one provided and we used a shredded Mexican blend of cheeses on top instead of Monterey Jack slices.  We will definitely make it again!

These burgers were really great, esp the guacamole, some people commented that the burgers fell apart so I added some bread crumbs to the burger mixture.   Also added salt and pepper in the guacamole which really brings out all the flavors, I didn't measure the onions or cilantro, just added them to fit our tastes and used pepper jack cheese on the burgers for a little extra spice.  Great recipe!

I followed the recipe to a "T" (with the changes that the creator corrected) and was sort of dissappointed, but not completely.  I will likely revise this recipe and try again, because this is a mesh of everything I love.  The burger was good- but as other reviewers noted, it needed a bit of salt (at least 1/2-1 tsp, I didn't put enough in), but was otherwise good- very juicy.  And this one is my fault- I served them on wheat buns, and the sweet flavor competed with the tangy lime. I'd use white buns next time.  
Bottom line, the recipe is a good outline, but I'll change some things next time.

I thought these were really good - so many flavors to take in.  I actually used cilantro in both the burger mixture as well as the guacamole (because guacamole just ain't guacamole without it!!).  I would make these again - to change it up a notch. I did think the guac was outstanding - some of the best I have had and I plan to bring what's left of it along with me this weekend so my family can enjoy it too.  Thanks much!

I will definitely be making these again but will add more lime juice, salt, pepper and garlic. Oh, I also did them on the Foreman grill. Thanks, Gigemmandy

Awesome!  Made it according to the recipe.  Better than the guacamole burger at Red Robin. The whole family thought it was likely the best burger they’ve ever had.

Very, very good and I made them with Turkey instead of beef. Although the turkey burger was dry alone, it was unnoticeable with the guacamole.  I didn't add or subtract a single thing to this recipe. Wonderful recipe for a change on Burger Night which we have every Friday.

The guacamole is amazing, although I did have to add more lime juice and salt, but that's just for my taste buds ?? the burger is ok, I def had to add more salt as recommended 1-2/1 tsp and lots more lime juice. The burgers also kept falling apart ?? didn't know what to do about that. I also substituted the cheese with pepper jack, YUM! Overall, very yummy.

Overall this recipe was really good. My family really likes it hot, so I used Pepper Jack instead of Jack. It still wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be, so next time I make it, I will add cayenne pepper instead of chili powder and I will use serrano peppers instead of jalapenos. I will definitely make this recipe again.

I was totally disappointed in this recipe. I was expecting a lot more flavor given the ingredients but all I really tasted was the avocado. Granted, I did not use the cilantro because no one in my family likes it. I even added Frank's Red Hot sauce afterwards and that did not make a difference.

I was too lazy to make the guac so I picked some up from a local restaurant here. Used ground chuck and the burgers were so juicy and delish. Also used orowheat sandwich thins as buns for less carbs

Super good!!! The only thing I thought was that the guacamole was way to dry. I will try putting some mayo in it  next time.. Don't know why that was. Otherwise the taste was amazing.

This was okay, I was really excited for it but it wasn't as great as I had hoped.  Followed the recipe exactly except for I used pepper jack cheese.  The guacamole wasn't the best I've ever had.

Best Burger I had so far! I didn't think the combination was to good sounding, but when I bit into the burger it was excellent! I also added the tomatoes to the Burger and it gave it a more juicy Burger, will try it the other way next time!

These sounded real good but neither the burger or the guacamole were that good.  The burger was somewhat bland, the guacamole was okay, and together they were just okay.

The guacamole was awesome. I have never added cilantro to it but it was a awesome idea. Once I got it all cooked and put togather, my grandparents were very impressed. I have now started bringing just the guacamole to parties and my friends love it!

I really liked the idea of putting the tomatoes in the hamburger instead of the guac.  My boyfriend doesn't like tomatoes but I still sneak them in whenever I can.  He still said the hamburgers were great and he did not mention anything about seeing tomatoes.  I did use a red chile powder but it was "Chimayo Chile".  I got the idea from a local trendy restaurant here in Denver that uses Chimayo in their gaucamole.  I will make it a point though to try the gauc with Chili powder next time.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

great burger.  I left the tomato out like many other reviewers.  The burger was moist and the quac was wonderful. I was a bit worried because the chili powder really made the qauc look ugly.  However it did taste good.

This was very good. I followed directions exact and I thought the hamburger patties were delicious. The guacamole was good too but I felt it was really to much garlic. So next time I will tone it down a bit.

The guacamole was a big hit!  Not too spicy, but just enough.  The burgers had a great taste and together they were really awesome!!!!
