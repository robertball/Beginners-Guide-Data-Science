I had a serious challenge with trying to get the sugar and water to turn the amber color, without scorching it...  So, after trying to do this 2 times, I gave up.  Instead I added caramel bits (you can buy them at Wal-Mart).  I added about a 1/3 of the bag to the hazelnut in my double boiler, added about a 1/3 cop of the heavy whipping cream and let the caramel melt in with the hazelnut.  Had to work it a bit, but turned out amazing.  So far I have made 2 batches and plan on making more!

The trickiest part was the caramel, but after doing it once I quickly figured out what I was doing wrong and made it perfectly. The end result was amazing BUT wasn't really the flavor I was hoping for. I didn't get enough of the caramel taste so next time I will make extra caramel mixed with salt and drizzle it on top to make it have a true chocolate seasalt caramel taste:)

I've never made truffles and these came out amazing! It took a bit of work and the trickiest part was the caramel but that's just becasue I don't know how to make caramel... Everyone thought they were great, and very pretty, so I will use this recipe again if I need a classy dessert.

My son and I mad these, and they were great!  Followed the recipe as written and did not have difficulty with caramel sauce, although it was lots easier to make it with another person.  I have always been scared of making truffles but they were not difficult as long as presentation isnâ€™t important.  Definitely need practice to make them giftable.
