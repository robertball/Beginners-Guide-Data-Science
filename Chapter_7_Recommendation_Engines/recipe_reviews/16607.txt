Awesome idea and pretty too.  I usually put 2/3 of the brownie batter into the pan first, then ALL of the cream cheese on top, then add remaining brownie batter.  This way, it makes a nice swirl, and not too white on top.  I sometimes use a 9-inch springform pan to make this then cut into pie wedges and garnish with fresh strawberry slices for an easy, attractive, elegant dessert.

OMG! These were sooo good! I used 2 pkgs of supreme brownie mix, because i love thick brownies. I added 1 tsp of vanilla to the cream cheese mixture, and 3 tbs of butter, and 1 tbs of flour, it really helps with the texture.  Definately use parchement paper to line the pan to prevent sticking or tough edges.  soo delicious, much easier this way and just as good as the "from scratch" method! thx!

Fabulous. And so easy! I made them in a 8x8" glass pan since we like our brownies thick. It did take quite a bit of extra time to cook them through, but they were well worth the wait! Definitely pour 2/3 of the brownie batter in the pan first, then the cheesecake, then drizzle the remaining batter on top before swirling with a knife. It makes for a much better marbled effect.

I made this just as written, no modifications, additions, or otherwise messing around with the recipe. It's easy to mix together, turns out perfectly with no issues or problems whatsoever, and looks pretty.  Having said that, however, the brownie part wasn't chocolatey enough and, because the cheesecake filling was swirled in, the flavor of that kind of got lost too. Unfortunately, this is only an average cheesecake brownie that I think would be worth trying again with a "from scratch" brownie batter.

This recipe is so easy and tasty. It really looks elegant too. I used a basic brownie mix and prepared it on the box per "cakelike" instructions. I added a tsp of vanilla to the cream cheese mixture for some extra flavor. I had no problem mixing it up even with the cream cheese right from the fridge. It's important to cook this in a preheated oven (I did it in a glass pan 350 degrees.) It was done when the toothpick came out clean and the top started to brown a bit. As an added touch I put chocolate chips on the top while it cooled. Don't try to cut it up until it is completely cooled. Wonderful quick easy recipe. Thanks Nat!

This was really good, and I am a from scratch type of person.  I'm not sure what happened with the other people who said it was too runny.  I cooked it 10 mins longer than the regular box directions, and I could have cooked it a little less than that.  Two things: 1)  Make sure and mix the cream cheese mixture until smooth and thick.  I didn't soften the cream cheese before mixing.  2)  I added 1/2t of vanilla to add a little more flavor.

Tasty!  Very quick and easy, goes on top of homemade brownies as easily as a mix.  I find it actually tastes even better after you've let it refrigerate overnight--the topping tastes even more "cheesecakey."  It can also be made into a fancy treat if you make it in two round pans, cut into wedges, and top with raspberries.

Very easy and good!  I love how the brownie texture does change to more like a cheesecake, very moist!  I would definitely pour 2/3 of brownie mix, then cream cheese mixture (using small dollops all over, even corners) then place remaining brownie mix on top before swirling with knife.  Easy!!

HELPFUL TIPS:  Unless you double the brownie mix, you really will have a flat/extremely thin brownie.  I posted 2 pictures showing the thickness of the entire batch (2 boxes) to give some an idea.  With two, they turn out the correct thickness for a brownie IMO.  Just make 1 box, put it ALL in pan, then put cream cheese mixture, and top with another brownie box mix.  Fits a 9X13 perfectly w/o even reaching near the top!  Definitely line your 9X13 with parchment or foil (w/pam), so you can easily pull out the entire brownie w/o any crumbles.  Also a must to wait for it to completely cool before doing or you will not have nice squares.  I baked mine for 50-55 minutes (until toothpick came out clear), and it came out perfect.  I also took the advice of adding 1T of flour, 3T of butter to the cream cheese (which I took straight out of the fridge before mixing).  If you're a frosting person, adding frosting and then crumbled oreos really makes it the perfect dessert!  I only gave the recipe 3 stars b/c even with changes the users here gave (and w/o), the cream cheese part is not spectacular tasting.  I thought "Brownie Caramel Cheesecake" from this site had a better rating AND tasted spectacular! This is good enough for something quick though when you have to bring something to a potluck or kid's school.

These were easy and delicious!  Adding homemade cheesecake filling is so much tastier than the boxed version of cheesecake brownies.  I also lined my pan with foil sprayed with Pam.  When I cut them into squares, they looked (and tasted) like something from a bakery.

I needed something quick and easy to take to my friends house for her two little boys.  This fit the bill. The kids loved it and quite frankly so did we.  It was too easy.

Yep, thats right my butt isn't going to get any smaller with these around.  I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese, added some vanilla & made them in muffin tins, which was a little tricky due to the fact that space was limited to "swirl".  MMMM.  Try strawberry cream cheese WOW!  Thanks Nat!

I made these for a birthday party.  I followed the directions (used margarine). I used the "Best Brownie" recipe on this website because it makes great brownies. This recipe was awesome! Basically it tastes just like fudge-y/chocolate cheesecake but without the crust and no cracking in the centre like a regular cheesecake. Everyone liked them. They took about 31 minutes to bake in my oven, the Best Brownie recipe usually takes about 10 minutes in my oven so that's a lot of extra time. 
Anyway, you should definitely try this one!

Since my first attempt, I have made mocha cheesecake brownies (3 tsp instant coffee, 1 tsp cinnamon) and peanut butter cheesecake brownies (1 ice cream scoop of cruncy peanut butter) with this recipe. The peanut butter one was especially good!

Okay, I can not, can NOT bake for the life of me. But this recipe is foolproof, so I had to give it a shot. I made it exactly as written, didn't change a thing. All I can say is WOW! The end result is none other than amazing! Not only do they taste great, but they look so pretty. This is a keeper for sure, thank you for sharing!

I altered the recipe a tad, adding half a jar of caramel between the brownie layer and the cheesecake, still swirling it together. OMG... it is so delicious, I have had people beg me for the recipe and tell me they were going to make them right away!

This recipe is good, but seriously, be careful.

When the recipe says "9x13 inch pan," Listen to it. No, it doesn't matter whether the box calls for an 8x8 or 9x9 pan. You want a 9x13 pan because if you don't, the brownies will not cook, because if you follow the recipe for the cheesecake portion, you will have a LOT of cheesecake topping. Which is great, but this thick layer will absolutely prevent the brownies underneath from cooking properly, especially if you're using a recipe that calls for an egg. Yes, the mixture will come out incredibly runny, unless you use a shallow pan. Messed this up one, got it right a second time when I realized my mistake. Don't do what I did, follow the instructions!

I have made these three times already and my husband & colleagues think that they are awesome. My only tip is to add a little bit more vanilla extract to the cheesecake mixture and not to over-swirl the cheesecake topping as I did the first time.

*laughs* These are from an evil, evil place... They're SO good that I am afraid that I'm gonna eat the whole darn pan of 'em.  (Added a tbs of butter / splash of vanilla / and tbs of flour to cream cheese mix)  DH claims he doesn't like Cheesecake, but he was packin' these in his cheeks like a squirrel preparing for winter! *For fun, I colored the cream cheese in Packer green & gold, and swirled that in*

I used Betty Crocker reduced fat brownie mix and fat-free cream cheese, which made these treats extremely low-fat.  I lined the baking dish with foil so they could be lifted out when done baking, which helped a lot (be sure to use lots of cooking spray).  But I had to bake them for 50 minutes, and they were still completely impossible to slice.  Next time I'll try cupcake-style to avoid both problems!  Also, make sure the cream cheese mixture is completely smooth before adding to pan.

This is a great recipe - and with such wonderful results no one will think you cheated with a brownie base mix. I baked mine in individual muffin tins and didn't swirl the cheesecake mixture, instead it acted as its own layer on top of the brownie. Then drizzled with melted dark chocolate - came out amazing!

A+ on presentation. B- on taste. Not worth the extra work as written. Everyone agreed that they just tasted like regular brownies. Next time I think I'll increase the cream cheese mixture.

Oh yeah! These are as scrumptious as they are simple to make. My one and only change was to add 1 teaspoon of vanilla to the cream cheese mixture (would be great with almond flavoring too!). Oh so very, very yummy!! And oh yeah, don't forget the old trick of cutting perfect brownies - cool completely then use a plastic knife. :-)

One of my favorite recipes! People always request these when there's a potluck. I usually add 1/2 a package of chocolate chips to the batter as well.
Edit: made these again and tried another variation - used cinnamon hazlenut coffee instead of the water and added about 2 tablespoons into the cheesecake batter as well and I think this was the best they've ever tasted. Be sure to not bake these too long...I think they're best when the toothpick just barely comes out clean.

Wow! You just cannot beat this recipe for time, ease or taste! I love (semi) homemade baking recipes and this is one of my go-to faves. I've made them a few times now using different brands & types of mixes and they are wonderful EVERY time. Today I added mini choc chips to the brownie batter and, again, got rave reviews. Thanx for the recipe :)

Our family loves these and makes them a few times a year! We follow the directions exactly, except  I put 3/4 of the brownie batter in the pan, followed by the cream cheese mixture, and then the rest of the brownie batter. Swirl and they turn out really pretty!

we used  2 boxes of betty crocker supreme mix with the hershey's syrup.  i had my son add 1 vanilla to the brownie mix. to the cream cheese mix we added 1t almond extract and the 1T flour and 3T butter as other reviewers suggested. also added 1/2 c chopped almonds to the top layer of brownie mix and made cakelike recipe. we layered 1/2 brownie mix, cream cheese mix and remaining brownie mix in 9x13 pan and baked for about 1 hr 15 mins. also in the last 1/2 hr we turned up the temp to 350 from 325 and added 5 chopped ghirardelli dark chocolate/sea salt/chopped almond medallions scattered over top.  i loved it

There seems to be some confusion as to whether this recipe is meant for an 8x8 pan or a 9x13 pan... I used a 9x13 pan and doubled the cheesecake portion, because I really like cheesecake! I also used a double recipe of "Deep Dish Brownies" from this site [my favorite brownies ever - but I only use 4 eggs for a double recipe and no baking powder so they're really fudgy]. Yes, they take longer to bake - mine were in for about 45-50 minutes in a glass pan. They were the perfect blend of cheesy richness and chocolatey goodness!!

i've made these a couple of times now, and they are absolutely the easiest cheesecake brownie to make ever.  the quality of the "boxed" brownie mix is key to how good they are.  so far, the best brownie mix is ghiradelli double fudge!  they taste better when they sit overnight in the fridge!

definitely will continue to make over and over again... except when using a 9X9 baking pan there is too much cheesecake mixture.

I frequently change up how I make my basic brownie mix to save on calories, but not sacrifice taste.  I made the brownie mix with mostly applesauce for moisture, and a little oil for the fat.  I used light cream cheese and a dab of vanilla extract, then layered my two mixtures to have a upper middle layer of cream cheese instead of on top.  My in-laws were visiting and could not stop eating them.  I'm sure they had no clue that they were reduced fat because they tasted so great!  Thanks for the post.

Great recipe, a quick easy way to turn regular brownie mix into a home-y creation. I mixed the cheese batter to much and they turned out rather a beige color than marble-y, next time I will be more careful when mixing.

These brownies are simple but delicious!  I have used this recipe several times (I've given them to a friend for their birthday, my internship mentor, my in-laws, my family, and I have enjoyed them myself) and I always get compliments.  I usually save a little bit of the brownie batter to pour on top of the cheesecake mixture which helped it swirl better.  Other than that I followed this recipe exactly.  One of my favorites!

Delicious! I put the brownie mixture down, layered in a good deal of caramel (squeezable bottle) then put the cream cheese mixture on top. Swirled all together. Mmm Mmm Mmm. So good!

Followed the recipe almost exactly (used 1/3 unsweetened applesauce and 1 tbsp oil in the brownies) and they turned out delicious. Thanks! What an easy and yummy recipe! Hubby, co-workers, everyone loved these brownies.

These came out amazing!  I first I was worried when I sneaked a piece about half an hour after pulling them out of the oven and they weren't very sweet at all, kind of bland actually.  After letting them cool for a few hours, they were great, and the next day they were even better.  I used an 8x8 pan and cooked them for just over the recommended time, and added the vanilla to the cream cheese mixture per other reviewers.

I don't know why, but I made these last night and they came out horrible...it may have been due to my addition of butter, flour and vanilla to the cream cheese (another reviewer suggested this) or because I used a spray instead of grease on the pan.

Simple and wonderful!  One note: though the recipe says that you should follow the brownie mix's instructions for baking time, your best bet is to begin to check the brownies around that time.  Some mixes are perfect then, others need 15 or 20 minutes more.

I used a family size brownie mix and doubled the cream cheese mixture, it was delicious!  I would definitely make it again.  I also dyed the cream cheese mixture orange for Halloween, it was fun.

Made as last minute potluck.  First dessert to go.   SO easy.  SO good.  I followed directions for cake-like brownies and based in a 9x9 pan.  Not sure how long I baked them.  Will definitely make again.  OH - also added vanilla extract to the cheesecake.

The first time I made these I followed the recipe exactly, and they turned out pretty good, but not cheesecake-y enough for my liking.  So, the second time I made them I doubled the cream cheese part and added a couple of spoonfulls of peanut butter.  

The other change I made was in the assembly of the two mixtures.  I put down a thin layer of the brownie mix in the pan and then spooned on a couple of dollops of the cheesecake mix and swirled.  I repeated this until all the batter was used up.  I found that this method gave me a much more swirled brownie with a better distribution of both flavors.  I had enough batter to make two 8 by 8 pans, and everyone absolutely loved them!

This recipe is fantastic and best of all EASY!  In my family, I've gained the reputation as being the one who brings the sweets to family gatherings.  But, this time, I was too tired to make the usual multi-step bars and brownies, so looking for something easy and quick, I decided to give this one a try!  I made these for a Memorial Day get together in May and again for the annual 4th of July barbecue.  Holy cow were they fantastic!  These were sooo moist and they couldn't get any easier to make.  These got lots of A++ reviews from my family and friends.  I'm going to let them keep thinking I slave all day in the kitchen to make these wonderful brownies - but really I'll know the truth! ;-)

These came out great! They taste great and look really pretty as well. I also added a splash of vanilla extract. Make sure to let your cream cheese warm up a bit on the counter before using it, you will not have lumps that way.

These were pretty good. Nothing spectacular, but still tasty. Might try adding some espresso powder to the cheesecake filling next time.

This was super yummy! I took the advice of others and added the cream cheese mixture in the middle, then more brownie mix on top before swirling. They were very moist and delish! The only thing I would change next time would be to add more cream cheese. But that's just my personal taste :)

Really liked these.. Very yummy.. wish that they had a little bit more cream cheese in them, but i'm sure that would be easy to fix.. Thanks for sharing.

Just adding the cream cheese topping makes regular brownies gourmet! I should have covered the top with foil towards the end, as the cream cheese browned a bit to much and looked burnt

I rarely make anything that isn't from scratch, but I sure am happy that I went out on a limb and made these! I followed the recipe exactly and when they came out of the oven I topped them with a little bit of blueberry pie filling. Yum!

Eh, not bad but not great.  I used a thick chunky brownie mix and I think that hurt it.  I had to stir it a ton for the cheesecake mix to not be all at the top.  Maybe if I try again I'll use a lower quality not chunky mix.

Quick and simple recipe if you don't want to have to make brownie's from scratch.  I like Ghirardelli brand brownie mix, adding the cream cheese mixture makes for a delicious dessert or snack!

Delicious!!! Used a package of Ghiradelli Dark Chocolate Brownies (I refuse to use any other brownie mix), and sprinkled some ghiradelli semi sweet chocolate chips over the cream cheese mixture after swirling a bit.

I did add two tbs of flour to the cream cheese mix for better texture.

Doubled the batch and it was still gone in two days. Thank you!

Easy and Yummy!  I poured 2/3 of batter in and then dropped the cream cheese and then drizzled the rest of batter over before I swirled together, like others had suggested.  I also added 1 tsp of vanilla to my cream cheese mixture and had to cook about 10 minutes longer than the box stated.

I have made these before with Orange food coloring in my cream cheese for Halloween, I forget now what I called them.  Tonight I made them green, and called them Leprechaun Brownies.  They were yummy, but I really needed to mix my cream cheese a little more or layer it.  I think my brownine was a little too moist in the center but it hasnt seemed to bother anyone :-)

First of all, I must say how easy and delicious these were! I used Duncan Hines chewy brownie mix and used a 9x9 pan. I recoMmend putting down 2/3 pf the brownie mix, adding the cream cheese mix, and then adding the rest of the brownie mix and swirling with a knife. They turned out perfectly and it was the most amazing combo.  Thank you Nat!!!

Good, but they really weren't that much better than just the boxed brownies. They definitely needed another 10-15 minutes on top of the cooking time on the box.

I made these brownies a little different and came out with a fabulous cheesecake! I made a box of brownies according to package directions,then I mixed 2 packages of cream cheese, 1\4 cup sugar, 3 teaspoons vanilla, 1 egg, and 1 tblspoon butter. I half melted all cream cheese ingredients in microwave and mixed them well. then i dolloped a very generous amount in brownie mixture. i swirled just a little and baked at 350 for 30 minutes. it was perfect! and very pretty.

I made this recipe with the following changes. 2 8oz pkgs of cream cheese 1 egg 2 tbl sour cream (to give it that real cheescake flavor/bite) 1/2c sugar I also added a tablespoon of vanilla to the brownie batter as well.  My boyfriend loved it.  I will be making this again.  I think the brownie would've overwhelmed the cream cheese if I hadn't added more cream cheese, so this only gets a 4 star.

SO EASY and tasty!  Perfect for a lazy day when I don't feel like making goodies from scratch.  The cheesecake topping adds nice presentation and flavour to the brownies.

I added some espresso powder (read from other recipe) for kick.  I also baked them in cupcake pan.  Not too bad but I regret not making them in bars.

It was a total bust, the cream cheese mixture did not melt into the brownies in anyway. Also when it was cooking the sides burned but the middle was still dough like.

Made this for my coworkers last week and it was a huge hit! One week later and they are still talking about it. One girl even came to me and begged for the recipe. She said she can't stop thinking about it! I did do as others said and layered it (brownie, cheesecake, brownie). Otherwise followed the recipe

REALLY delicious and so easy!  Perfect to take to pot-luck type function.  

Followed recipe exactly, but put 2/3 of brownie batter in pan, followed by cream cheese mixture, followed by remaining brownie batter, and then swirled together.

I didn't use a box brownie mix, I used the recipe for Mmmm...Brownies on this site. I did add in some vanilla to the cream cheese mixture. Mine took a good 50  minutes to bake, but that was because I used an 7X11 pan. We took them to a BBQ and came home with an empty pan.

Soften the cream cheese first! This is such a simple and delicious recipe! Brownies look like something from a bakery once cut into small rectangles.

Love this delicious little twist on boxed brownies, this last time I used I didnt have an egg for the topping, so just used cream cheese, sugar and vanilla and spread ontop of brownies before refrigerateding.

Like little nibbles of Heaven! Hubby says not to make brownies any other way. I used 2 boxes of Jiffy brownie mix so I used a 7x11 pan instead.  And I substituted raspberry syrup for the water called in the brownie mix to give it a slight hint of raspberry.

These were just okay for us.  I mean how bad can brownies with cream cheese swirled in be?  Easy and fast- but kinda tastes that way too, not special or really delicious.  Probably won't make again.

Delicious!  Very easy to make (my 9 yr. old daughter made them herself), and were very moist and pretty.  As other reviewers mentioned, they are not too sweet, which was nice.

as much as i love to make things from scratch, it was nice to find a yummy recipe to "cheat". the only difference was that i took the recommendation of the 1/2 tsp of vanilla and i also reserved a small amount of the brownie mixture. after topping the brownies with the cheesecake mixture i dolloped the brownie mix and then swirled so that the whole thing doesn't get entirely combined.

I had to throw something together and a box of brownie mix was the only thing I had in the house. I used a smaller pan to make them thicker and baked them longer. Soo good!

I love this idea. Brownie + cream cheese?!? Yum! I combined this recipe with Brooke's Brownies from this website instead of box brownies. Next time, I'll try this with a more cake-like brownie, although the fudgy quality of Brooke's did combine well with the cream cheese mixture. Another thing I'll do next time is not follow the advice of other reviews. The cheese layer does need to truly be a top layer, as opposed to 2/3 brownie, then cheese, and then final brownie layer. My brownies have a stronger chocolate flavor, and I was really looking for the cheese to shine through. I can wait to make these again!

These were good, and very easy, which I loved. Based on some of the reviews I read here, I went with a "supreme" mix (comes with an extra little packet of chocolate syrup to mix in) to make sure the brownies would be chocolatey enough. But be sure to read the box directions - my mix recommended a smaller pan size and suggested a 9x13 only if you wanted thinner brownies. The finished brownies were a bit thin, so I'll probably try a smaller pan next time.  I did as some other reviewers suggested and poured in 2/3 of the brownie batter, followed by dollops of cream cheese mixture, then the rest of the brownie batter. The swirl effect came out very nicely.

These brownies are quick and easy to make. They tasted great! I used one bag of Ghiradellhi brownie mix in a 11x7 glass dish, and they were a nice thickness. I also added chocolate chips. This is a great recipe because it doesn't take much time or ingredients - especially nice if you need to make a quick dessert.

Not impressed.   I have had brownies similar to these and I was disappointed that they didn't turn out like the ones I have had before.  They were pretty blah.  I will keep looking.

Very yummy and easy! To add some flavor I added some vanilla extract to the cream cheese mixture.  Make sure the cream cheese is softened before you mix it all together.   Put 2/3 of the brownie mix in the plan, add the cream cheese mixture then top with the remaining brownie mix.  This adds a nice mix of the two.   Enjoy!

I've made it three times. #1 the original recipe, was delicious and I give it five-stars. #2 I added ¼tsp of milk and vanilla extract and it was still unbelievable, i really like what vanilla does for the cream cheese and #3 and what INSPIRED me to leave this review: my husband and I brought this to my family's and they loved it. We had it on our dinner plates and I scooped up a scallion with it on accident. And then I made everyone try them with fresh chopped scallions on top and the tang with the cheesecake and the chocolate... it was delicious! Everyone thought so, even my brother who has a firm hatred of onions. Just add on top and I think you'll find a very nice flavor.

I took these to work today for Halloween and they were a huge hit! I used food coloring to turn the cheesecake batter orange. I took the advice of other reviewers and reserved 1 cup of the brownie batter, and placed it on top of the cheesecake batter, pulling a knife through to swirl it. I'll definitely make these again (next time with walnuts). Thanks for the great recipe!

I bake these in mini muffin cups I've sprayed and don't have to worry about cutting them.  They always get rave reviews.

This recipe is just what I was looking for and it worked out great. For the 8x8 inch pan I used I ended up with a lot of cream cheese mixture left over. I would probably use only about 5-6oz of crm chz for that size pan again. Very Good. Thank you!

Made this for a dinner party and it got rave reviews! I only had 4 oz of neufchatel cheese so I mixed that with 2 oz sour cream and 2 oz. cottage cheese- may not sound great, but once blended it tasted fine. Its actually a great way to lower the fat and calories a bit!

Simple and easy way to "fancy up" boxed brownies. I like to toss in about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips into brownie mix. I bet this recipe would be super good with a homemade brownie, but it's hard to beat the ease and speed of this recipe.

We like thick brownies at our house so I made this in a 9x9 pan and it took almost an hour to bake completely, even though I swirled the cream cheese mixture into the brownies it all went to the top making two layers, that may have been b/c I used reduced fat cream cheese anyway the end product was good no complaints from the testing crew and it was gone it two days!

Everybody thought these were amazing! I did take some suggestions from others to make them the night before and refrigerate till serving time. I also added some vanilla extract to the cream cheese mixture and swirled it all together with a butter knife. Very good!

These brownies taste great!  I would recommend using a 9x13 pan instead of a 8x8 or 9x9.  It took mine about an hour and 15 minutes to bake all the way through in an 8x8 glass pan.  I will say that the wait was worth it, but next time I don't want to wait that long to taste them!

First time I wish I had followed the recipe as is instead of listening to the reviews. It's best to add the cream cheese on top, not add another layer of brownie because when swirling, the cream cheese becomes too incorporated into the batter so there's not enough distinction between the cream cheese and brownie part. I added the 3TB butter and 1 TB flour, but I don't think it made any difference. The cream cheese mix didn't set up better like a cheesecake at all. Still, great brownies...very addicting if you love cream cheese like me. I'll follow the recipe next time!

EDIT: Okay, after been demanded to make this three times in a row within two weeks, I'm going to admit now that it's a 5 star recipe for its ease and pure likeability. Even I like it, even though it bothers me as a make-from-scratch type of person. When I make this now, I don't swirl at all since I tend to mess it up when I swirl and I follow the instructions exactly, instead of adding anything else. What I really want to do is add the cheesecake topping to my favorite brownie recipe from this site, Black Bean Brownies:)

This was quite literally heaven! So chewy and decadent! I used Betty Crocker's Hershey Triple Chunk brownie mix. Also took the advice of another review which said to line the pan with foil. I did that and it turned out simply perfect! The edges were perfectly golden brown and very chewy and wonderful. I don't like it when the edges are all crisp and blackened lol! The foil definitely fixed that problem. My boyfriend and I can't keep our hands off of them!!! We limited ourselves to 2 per day =))

I could not believe something so easy could be so good.  I used Duncan Hines Chocolate Brownies and followed the recipe.  I took them to a Red Hat buffet today and they gobbled them up.  The other poster was right they taste twice as good the second day.

These are good and quick, however I still like the "from scratch" one I have previously used.  Taking suggestions from other reviewers, I added 1 Tablespoon flour and 1 Tablespoon butter to the cream cheese mixture.  And, because my husband likes coconut, I added 1/2 cup coconut to the cream mixture also.  I forgot to just put 2/3 of the brownie mixture in first and then the cream cheese and then the rest of the brownie mix.  I would suggest you do this as it is easier to swirl in the cream cheese mixture.  I used an 11x7 glass dish.  Baked at 350 degrees for 40 minutes.  They were good and we expecially like the coconut in them.

Very good and easy recipe for when you don't have alot of time, but want to add a little extra "pizazz" to your brownies. I used D. Hines dark choc. brownie mix., and an 8 x 11.5 x 2 in. glass pan- baked them for 42 minutes at 325 and they turned out quite nicely.

W*A*R*N*I*N*G - These brownies are highly addictive.

I was very pleased with this recipe and made only a slight change - I added some vanilla to the cheesecake mixture.

I do have a tip though, B. Crocker's dark chocolate brownies are the best complement to the cheesecake.  Take this from a person who makes brownies almost daily.  Really.

Disappointing as these were kind of bland.  The cream cheese portion does not stand out.  There are much tastier ways to use a brownie mix and I won't make this again.

This brownies are awesome!  I used Ghiradellis double chocolate brownies, the ones with the chocolate chips.  The cheese mixture was a bit lumpy, but it was fine after it baked.  Instead of swirling the cream cheese in, I just poured it on top of the brownie batter, so that each flavor was still distinct.  I recomend using an 8x8 inch pan so that the cream cheese part is as thick as possible.  It takes about 10 minutes longer to cook.  These are so much better after they have been refridgerated, don't judge them until you have had one that is cold.

Really yummy and simple recipe.  I used low fat brownie mix and 1/3 fat cream cheese.  I also added green and red food coloring to the cream cheese and swirled it.  It was a great idea from another reviewer.  Thanks.

This is very similar to a recipe my roommate got on a Lord of the Rings site.  The only difference is the CINNAMON.  I added two teaspoons to the brownie mix (but you can do one if you don't want it that strong).  IT IS SO GOOD!!!

This cheesecake topping can also be used on chocolate cake or cupcakes.

Great and quick recipe!!!
For a little added decadence, mix in a few tablespoons of cherry pie filling or orange marmalade (if doing the marmalade, warm over gentle heat and add a splash of Grand Mariner!)
YUM!

I made mine in 9 inch square pan as others had recommended. Box said 33 minutes but it did need an extra 5 minutes as center was really jiggly. Warmed a tub of fudge frosting and made a glaze for them too. Added vanilla to cheesecake mixture as well. Everyone raved at dessert as I made it for company!

This recipe is the gold standard at my house.  I do add 1 TBL of flour and a spec more sugar to the cream cheese mix as many reviewers suggested .  Honestly, these are even better the second day (but they often don't last that long). Cook until the cream cheese is set - but not yet brown.  Amazing!

I looooove this recipe! It’s  super easy to follow and requires little ingredients. I did like some reviewers said and added only 2/3 of the brownie batter in the pan first, then the cheesecake mix and then the rest of the brownie. Swirled it all together with a plastic spoon and it came out beautifully!

Hi frenz!
My very good friend Dr. Sanu Beetee made this cheesecake brownie yesterday and OMG! My husband ate his own hand dunked in the brownie. What an excellent recipe! Very pretty cool and tasty and easy and fun and yummy and sanu-licious!
Please try at home but make the brownie batter from scratch because why not ???????
Alter : Along with sugar add 1/4 cup salt for excellent salty flavour.

Don't be concerned about the review that says you can't use a smaller cake pan (9X9 or 8X8). Just bake it another 10 minutes give or take; just keep an eye on it. Nothing is better than a thick brownie! Great recipe!!! Don't hesitate giving this a try, you will be so happy you did.

I'd suggest cutting the amount of cheesecake mixture in half. Just too much cheese and it makes the marble pattern looks "too busy." I added diluted strawberry jam before doing the marbling to make it a strawberry cheesecake brownie. Also added 1 tsp of vanilla extract and 1 tsp of flour to cheesecake mixture as other baker suggested here. Taste is awesome. Just doesn't look too pretty and the surface of the brownie is quite uneven.

I have been making this for years.  Instead of browning mix, I have tried it with a regular dark chocolate cake mix and dollops of cream cheese mixture on top.  Delicious! No icing needed for the cake.

Omgosh!  I think these were the best brownies I've made!  Was invited to dinner & offered to bring a dessert.  Asked for suggestions- "brownies or cheesecake".  Didn't have time to make a cheesecake, so I looked up "Cheesecake Brownies".  These were a huge hit & I resisted the urge to eat another one (of only 3) that were leftover on my way home!  I did add the tsp of vanilla to the cheesecake part. I did the 2/3 brownie batter/cheesecake/remainder of batter layering that was suggested and I added a few mini chocolate chips & cinnamon chips on top after it was done baking.  (And I can't say it took much longer to bake than normal.  I like them soft!)  Thank you for this yummy & SO simple recipe!  I'll be making them again, I'm sure!  =:)

Made exactly as written, brownies from a box, it's ok. Not bad, not great, I'm not sure it's an improvement. They look fancy but taste average. You mostly taste the sweetness, not cheesecake or chocolate. Brownies from scratch next time!

Great recipe and very easy. I did add 1 tsp vanilla to the cream cheese layer the second time I made it and I think it had a much nicer flavor. I also added mini chocolate chips to the cream cheese layer and made it in a mini cupcake pan like black bottom cupcakes. A hit all around. The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 was the additions I felt it needed.

I'm giving this 5 stars after the changes I made.  The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly and didn't think there was enough of the cheesecake part.  The 2nd time I doubled the cheesecake recipe and also added vanilla, and it was perfect!  If you want mostly brownie with just a touch of cheesecake, follow the original recipe.  If you'd like it to have just as much cheesecake as brownie, double everything but the brownie mix.

Very nice twist to a baking staple (: 

I used Betty Crocker's brownie mix, mixed the batter by hand, layered 2/3 of the batter-cream cheese-remaining batter, swirled with a knife, and baked in a 8x8 pan at 325F for 40 minutes. 

My brownies were underbaked!!! ): But that's probably my own fault. I ended up freezing the gooey parts and calling it baked fudge! Mum said it tasted wonderful still hahahaha. 

Will try this again in future; this time with a longer baking time. Helpful tip to make your brownies fudgy: Dont mix too much air into it, and before baking, bang the pan on a hard surface to release the bubbles. 

Great recipe, thanks!!!

These were great! They do have to cook about 10 min longer because the cream cheese mixture was added though. I added a drizzle of almond extract to the cream cheese and it was awesome!

Delicious!  Easy to make and a hit a our friend's house.  As recommended, I poured 2/3 of the brownie batter in 1st, then cream cheese mix (I added 1 tsp. vanilla), topped with rest of brownie batter.  For brownie mix, I used Ghirardelli Triple Chocolate..so rich and moist!

these are sooooo good. my second batch is in the oven now! I used this cream cheese mixture on the betty crocker cookie brownie mix so they are like cheesecake cookie brownies! I add chocolate syrup to the brownie mix to make them chewier.

Yum! I love these things, even though we did use a Ghirardelli box mix for the brownie base. Very rich and tasty. Baked them in a 9 x 9 pan, since we like them thicker, and the box called for baking 45 minutes. These baked about 35 minutes.

Great basic recipe and an easy way to make a brownie mix special.  As a variation, for Christmas, I added peppermint extract to the cream cheese mixture.  After baking, I topped the brownies with chocolate chips and a sprinkling of crushed candy canes.  They were adorable and tasted great!

Brownies+cream cheese=yummy in my tummy! I used an 8x8 pan, triple chunk brownies, and used a small amount of cream cheese swirl. Baked it for 35 or until the sides are done (tested it with a toothpick). There's also a pillsbury cheesecake swirls available in a box but sometimes its not available and only at a certain store.

Remember, these are dressed up box brownies not home made.  Having said that, these are really goood and super easy.  I keep the ingredients on hand and can have a yummy dessert in no time at all.

I made these last night using the Best Brownies recipe from this site instead of brownie mix and they turned out wonderful.  I swirled the cheesecake mixture right into the brownie mix instead of just on top, and I added chopped walnuts.  It had to cook for quite a bit longer than the 30 minutes, but once that knife came out clean, and they cooled, delicious!  I will definitely be making these again!

No problems here, I used the Best Brownies recipe off of this site instead of a box. That recipe makes enough for an 8X8 pan and this amount of cheesecake gave a nice generous proportion of chocolate to cheese, I would probably double the recipe if I was making a full 9X13 pan. Thanks for the recipe.

Hmmm!  Yummy!  I was looking for a very fast cheesecake alternative and this was perfect!  I used my own recipe for brownies and then added vanilla to the cream cheese mixture, as suggested.  Very yummy mixture of brownies and cheesecake!

YUM! I added 1 tsp self-rising flour and 1 tsp vanilla flavoring to the cream cheese mixture. I also sprinkled a handful of chocolate chips on the top of everything before baking. It's great!

I doubled the batch to take to work yesterday ...The taste was not to my liking. They looked beautiful, the swirl was really nice...they rose perfectly, the edges were great...the taste was not. I didn't throw them out like I wanted but I should have. I will try and find a better recipe.

I paired this with the Best Brownies recipe (here on the site) since I don't like box mixes (which tend to be low on flavor--aside from sweetness). The two recipes combined make the perfect cheesecake brownie. And like cheesecake, they're even better the day after baking, once the flavors have blended.

Yummy!  I couldn't locate an 8x8 pan (which is waht the brownie mix called for), so I used a mini muffin pan.  Perfect!  I used others suggestions with adding about 2/3 brownie mix, then cheesecake mix, remaining brownie mix.  They were bitesize and perfect!  Thanks for the recipe!

I can't give this a 5 since the base is a boxed mix but they were really good!  I used raw sugar in the cheesecake mixture and saved 1/3 of the brownie batter to put on top.  That way, it swirled much easier and looked prettier.  Plus, some of the cheesecake filling is sort of in the middle, which is yummy.  In a 9x13, mine only took 25 min. in my convection oven.  This is a great recipe to go to when you need something quick and don't have time for a from-scratch dessert.  Thank you!

Great recipe.  I like having this around when I don't feel like going the home made route.  I added vanilla to this recipe and I think it really helps.  It needs to be cooked much longer than the box will tell you.

I used this recipe and followed the recommendations of some of you and used the 1/3 less fat cream cheese and added 1/2 tsp. of vanilla for the cheesecake portion.  I used a chocolate fudge brownie mix also that added a bit more flavor for the brownie with the cheesecake so the two wouldn't get too mixed up. I split the batter for this two ways- I made 12 "muffins" and also a smaller round pan version.  I didn't swirl the two though b/c I wanted the flavors to stay separate so instead I topped with some milk chocolate chunks (about 5 per muffin) and cooked for about 25-30 min. (until the toothpick came out clean) I filled them up 2/3 with the brownie mix and 1/3 cheesecake.  I used the rest of the mix for the round pan which I also topped with the chocolate chunks instead of swirling and it, too, came out delicious. My family LOVED these and it was so handy in the muffin cups b/c the portions aren't too big- just right :)  We will DEFINITELY be doing these again.

Taking a previous reviewers advice, I also used 2 boxes of brownies and also added 3 tbs of butter, 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tbs of flour to the cheesecake mixture.  I had no problem swirling the cheesecake mixture on top.  Just take a spoon, and add dollops all over the poured mixture and use a chopstick to mix and swirl.  The brownies came out incredibly moist and the cheesecake topping was rich and perfect.  I took them to work and they were a huge hit.  An instant favorite easily and yes, possibly the best brownies I've ever made!

Sinful!  I made these in a 9 inch springform pan, and they turned out beautifully!  I also followed the tips on the filling that wifey suggested.  Instead of just layering the cheesecake mixture on top, I saved a portion of the brownie to swirl through on top as well.  Pretty enough for company, but comforting and easy enough to whip up for the family!

Pretty easy and a nice way to use boring brownie mix.  The cream cheese for some reason wouldn't get smooth but they still turned out well. I might use a smaller dish next time to get a thicker brownie or use less cream cheese because the cheesecake part is pretty thick.

Loved the topping but the first attempt was a failure because I made the brownies in a 9x9 pan, and they just didn't cook through. Recipe is optimal in a wider pan (not as deep).

These turned out very good and they were very easy. I used 1/3 fat cream cheese, and you couldn't even tell! I used parchment paper to make them easier to pull out, but they turned out great! Thank you!

These were easy to make, but far too rich and kind of gummy in texture. We ended up having one each for dessert and the rest just sat in the pan until they got tossed. Sorry that I can't recommend this.

This recipe was a terrific way to make a prepared box brownie mix extra special.  I normally hate to read reviews that give 5 stars after the reviewer made multiple changes, so with that said, I only made one change myself, out of pure necessity.

As a result of using egg whites in another recipe earlier, I found out that I was one egg short after starting the recipe.  Therefore, I used two eggs in the brownie part, and one (leftover) yolk plus a few TBSPs of milk along with the cream cheese for that layer.

I layered half the brownie mixture, then the cream cheese, the the remaining brownie mixture, then swirled it all together as another reviewer suggested.

It was the first dessert gone at our July 4th family reunion, and the whole gang wished I'd brought more!  Thanks~

I followed the recipe exactly.  Very simple, quick and easy, but honestly I felt like it ruined the brownies.  I would have enjoyed the box brownies all by itself better.

These are SOOO good. I followed the recipe, but used the Best Brownie recipe that's on this website. They were delicious. The only thing was that they took a while to cook, but they were well worth the wait. I will definitely make these again. =)

I tried an 8x8 pan and even after cooking the brownies an extra 10 minutes (at least), the center brownies were still liquid.  The topping was going to burn so I ended up just serving the outer fully baked slices.

Nice and Easy and awesome. I had no problems- I followed the recipe as was except vanilla in the cheesecake mixture. I used the brownie mix that is family size for a 9 by 13 pan and made them cake like because that's how we liked our brownies- cooked in 28 minutes and were even better after being refrigerated. These are a keeper definitely! Thanks for sharing.

I used the Bombshell Brownie recipe for these and I really liked them. I think I'll add 3 or 4 more ounces of cream cheese next time just because I like them with more cream cheese, but still really tasty.

Even though I left the cream cheese out for a few hours, the cream cheese mixture was clumpy. I had to squished it through a filter, so it was a bit time consuming. Nonetheless, they tasted good in the end. The cream cheese added a tangy cheesecake like contrast to the thick chocolate brownie which tasted better after refrigeration.

Ok, so I'll be one of the few to rate this brownie and say I did not like it.  It definately does not have any cheesecake flavor and the texture that the "cheesecake" part adds just turned me off....it was slightly grainy(and it was mixed enough).  Sorry did not like these at all.  We even ended up throwing out more than half of a pan of them!

These were yummy. I didn't use brownie mix but used the Best Brownies recipe off of this site. They turned out yummy. They took about 40 minutes to bake, but they were delicious. I used low fat cream cheese to make these. Very delicious.

I'm not a big fan of boxed mixes, so I used this recipe with my go to brownie batter. I also cooked down a pint of fresh raspberries and swirled it all together. The end result is fantastic! I highly recommend trying this out with berries as I did. Extremely decadent.

Excellent recipe!I made this recipe at night,refrigerated it overnight and Yum Yum Yummy!I made a few adjustments as suggested by others and a few of my own.I didn't add chocolate chips to cream cheese mix,instead 2 tbl.sour cream and 1 tbl. flourfor more of a light,less sweet consistency as the brownie layer is sweet enough.Absolutely deee-lish!

These brownies came out good and they looked very nice too!  I added 1 tsp of vanilla to the cream cheese mixture as suggested by other reviewers.  I did have to cook the brownies longer than usual, more like 40 minutes instead of the usual 30.

I made these for my best friends birthday. Everyone loved them and thought they were so unique. They were delicious and easy to make, I suggest melting the cream cheese beforehand and using low fat because they taste just as good this way. (but you save on the calories!) I will make them again for other events, easy and tasty.

My 7 year old daughter has been asking for the brownies with the "white stuff" swirled in. This recipe was perfect, and was so easy, she made most of it. Tasted wonderful. This one is definately a keeper.

Wonderfully easy and just as tasty! I find I have to cook mine an extra 5 minutes or so to ensure they are done. Like another reviewer, found it best to add 3/4 of the batter then the cheesecake mixture and then the rest of the batter. Makes it easier to achieve the 'swirl'.

Very good recipe.  Adds a nice twist to the ordinary brownie and is extremely easy. I add food coloring to the cream cheese mixture during the holidays to add a little extra pizzazz. Red for Xmas and orange for Halloween.  Kids love it!

Very good.  I used it with a homemade recipe in an 8" pann; had to bake for about 10 minutes longer, and they pufed up around the edges--but tastes great, just what I was looking for.

This is a great recipe, and a huge hit at the office.  I've used both packaged brownies and made brownie mix from scratch and it goes well with both.  My only suggestion is to make it a little more gooey and chocolatey, is to add more chocolate chips.  I like to mix milk and dark chocolate to intensify the flavors.

Excellent picnic brownies. I added 2 T of sour cream to the topping mixture as well as 1 tsp of vanilla. I stirred about 1/2 C of sea salt chips into the brownie mixture and then also spread some on top, more as decoration, about 8 minutes before baking was done.  I under baked a little too - so they were very moist. The mix of flavors was scrumptious! Great reviews at the picnic.

My son wanted this for his birthday, instead of cake. Turned out amazingly moist and delicious!
A few swaps... I made double. I used one less egg than the brownie mix and recipe required (total 6 needed, used 5), 12 oz cream cheese, 2/3 cup of sugar.

So Yummy! Oh and the kiddo loved them!

My 79 year old neighbor has a serious sweet tooth.  His wife died 6 months ago, so I try to do some baking for him.  These brownies were a HUGE hit with him.  He doesn't like his dessert to be too sweet and this was just right!  They stayed moist until he had the pan finished.  I appreciated that they were quick and easy to fix!

When I made the cream cheese mixture it became a liquid which would not have worked so I added another block of cream cheese (thankfully I had one) and made it a more "cheesecake" consistency.  The result turned out okay, but the original recipes liquid cream cheese mixture would not have turned out because I have run into this exact problem before with another recipe.

I made this with the additions suggested by other cooks.  The taste is very good.  When I make it again in a 9x13 pan, I will double for thicker brownies.  I hesitated to make it in a 9x9 pan due to comments from one other review, but I will probably try that in the future.

I used 2 brownie packages, an 8×11 glass dish and cooked it at 350 for 52 minutes.  Delicious!  Now, saying that, I will make this again exactly as the original recipe states.  I believe by doubling up on the brownie mix changed the authors original intent.  As much as I liked the brownie cheesecake...I think I will like cheesecake brownie even better, as the author intended.

Thanks for posting.

Easy. Tasty.

Next time I'd use a slightly smaller pan (batter barely reached the edges of my 9" x 13"), and bake just 2-3 minutes longer than the package suggests (at least for my oven) to account for the cream cheese addition.

i made this for a Labor Day gathering (with hundreds of others in attendance).  IMHO these were the best dessert to be had.  I am making again for 2 family events coming up this weekend!  After reading reviews, I did add 1t vanilla to the cream cheese mixture.  I may have cut back on the sugar slightly.  I also filled pan with 2/3 of brownie mix, then cream cheese mixture, then remaining batter before swirling.

I used 2 boxes of chocolate chunk brownies in a 9 x 13 pan and prepared as directed.   I put about 2/3 of the batter in the pan, then added the cream cheese mixture, then topped it of with the rest of the batter, swirled the batter and cream cheese mixture and baked as directed.    These brownies are delicious, I made these bars for a wedding shower and was a huge success.

This recipe is so simple to make. I added 4oz cream cheese, 1 more egg & 1 tsp vanilla extract. I used 2 boxed brownies since i like it to be thicker and added chopped cashew nuts. Sooo yummy! Will bring it to my husband’s family on the weekend! For sure they will love it too.

This is a very tasty and easy recipe and it baked all right, but I have to admit my cheesecake batter turned out very watery, and when I tried to swirl the batter, it didn't do anything! I made this for a group of about 16 kids, and they all wanted seconds! In the end, okay recipe.

I love making cheesecake brownies, especially for work birthdays (huge hit!). A couple helpful tips - make sure your ingredients are at room temperature.. they will mix better. Start with cream cheese and sugar, beat for 1 minute, then add the egg and mix for another minute. I like to add some vanilla extract for extra flavor, and top with crumbled Oreos / chocolate morsels / nuts. Similar to other comments, I add 2/3 of the brownie batter into the (aluminum lined / PAM sprayed) pan, dollop and swirl with cheesecake filling, then top with remaining brownie batter.

I made this today EXACTLY as the recipe stated.  It wasn’t “rocket surgery”.  It turned out flat and undone even after baking it an extra 20 minutes.  The brownies were doughy and not baked but the cheesecake topping was starting to burn when I took it out of the oven.  I think that maybe the brownie batter should be baked for 15 minutes or so before the cheesecake topping is added and then baked for another 15-20 minutes more.  This was a terrible recipe and I am so sorry I didn’t use my cooking instinct and do what I just proposed. Not a happy baker tonight.

These were very delicious!  I would make them again for sure however you cannot follow the heating time on the brownie mix because mine ended up taking over 50 minutes to bake.

I love extra cheesecake so I doubled the cheesecake portion and put 2/3 of the brownie batter on the bottom, then the cheesecake batter and then the remaining brownie batter.  They were sooooo good and easy!

Recipe came out great! I used a box mix that was on sale and it worked out fine. I don't get why some reviewers say theirs came out soupy. Following the directions on the package and this recipe makes it come out great! I will try it  in a 8x8 pan next time as I want my brownie to be a little thicker in height. Thank you for the recipe!

Easy and good. I have a question though and I wish this site allowed people to pose questions and answers!  It says nothing in the recipe above about whether these need to be refrigerated? I hate cold hard brownies, but due to the cream cheese I feel they may need to be in the fridge. I don't know what to do!

Okay I haven't baked it yet, but the swirling effect came out so beautifully I had to snap a pic! Took others' notes and poured 2/3 brownie batter, then cream cheese mix, then last 3rd of brownie. Swirl with a knife and voila! I'll edit when I taste...

I followed it exactly I would recommend adding some chocolate chips or Hershey syrup to it to make it a little more chocolatey and definitely split the batter and do two thirds of the brownie mix first then the cheesecake filling and then the brownie on top and swirl going to try to add some vanilla and butter next time as well

Delicious!  Such a fast and easy way to spruce up those ordinary boxed brownies, if you don't want to make them from scratch.  I used to make brownies this way when I was young with my mom.  I couldn't remember the recipe for the cream cheese mixture and this recipe was perfect!  The only thing I did differently was to add in 1 tsp. of vanilla into the cream cheese mixture.  They came out so yummy!  Thank you for sharing!

I followed the directions. Maybe I beat the cream cheese too long, but it was like soup. I was trying to get little cheese lumps out since the directions said it had to be smooth. Ugh! What a mess.

I subbed dark rum for the water in the brownie recipe, and added 1 teaspoon of coconut flavoring to the cream cheese-- coconut rum brownies!  They were a hit, but I think I'll try to cut the oil in the brownie mix by 2 tablespoons and sub with rum next time, as the rum flavor wan't dominant enough (for me).

Wonderful, delicious and super easy. I used a Ghirardelli brownie mix and baked in a 9x13 pan for 25 minutes at 325, preheated. Came out amazing!

Hosting an impromptu dinner party with limited ingredients on hand, I chose this recipe. I added the vanilla, sugar and flour suggested by other reviewers. Be sure to refrigerate for a few hours before cutting/serving. I used 8 x 11 pan.

Ijust did not care for it.  The brownie part was cake like, and I don't like cake like brownies.  The cheesecake texture appeared 'rubbery' and the top collapsed in ridges after it cooled down, wasn't expecting that. . I usually get expected outcome when I follow  the recipe, but not this one.  Wasted time and resources.

Fantastic!
I followed the recipe as instructed except I only added walnuts to the Brownie mix.  I ended up baking about 15 minutes longer to get the tooth pick to come out clean.  They were perfectly gooey.  A hit with young and old!

Not too sweet, although I substituted powered sugar for the white sugar in the cheesecake filling. And not quite an entire cup either.

Made these to take into work and they were a huge hit! Like many comments suggested, I used 2 boxes of a fudge type brownie mix and I added a bit of caramel sauce as well (not a lot, just a bit on top). Wasn't entirely sure about cooking time but I put them in for just under an hour and they came out great and very moist. They were quickly devoured and everyone just loved them. Whenever I end up making these again I might add some crushed walnuts on top just for more texture.

People liked it.  I used half the brownie mix on the bottom and half on the top over the cheesecake portion.  It was a little mushy in the middle of the pan while being crunchy on the corners, but the folks I made it for were happy as they had different views about the perfect consistency for brownies should be. Next time I will add more vanilla to the cheesecake portion.

I used a larger boxed brownie mix (22 oz) and baked in 9x13 glass pan.  Total time to bake was 35 minutes.  Hub loved it.  Also, I lined pan with parchment paper which made clean up easy.

No need to change anything in this recipe, it looks and tastes great exactly as is.  If you are baking for a large group like a pot luck, better make two.  Some people were disappointed because it was gone when they came back for seconds.

Made this as is, except took the advice from other reviewers and added a 1/2 tsp. of vanilla extract to the cheesecake mixture.  I came to the party late, right after the birthday cake was cut, and my brownies were  still devoured!  I got reviews with words like Heavenly, and Scrumptious, and Best brownie they've ever had!   This recipe is super easy and is definitely a keeper!  Oh, and I refrigerated them overnight , and they were so still so incredibly moist!

My mom had this same exact recipe since I was a kid and it was always one of my favorites! I make it every Christmas as part of the cookie trays i give out as gifts, and I always have people begging for more! These brownies are dangerously good, watch out or you'll eat the whole pan by yourself!!! :D

Disappointed with this recipe. Brownie batter was disproportionate to the cheesecake layer, and as such, was very thin. The cheesecake layer was also impossible to spread . It didn't turn out good.I followed the recipe exactly.

These brownies were so easy & very good! I used Duncan Hines dark chocolate boxed brownie mix, prepared it for the "fudgy" type of brownie, & added in some vanilla extract to the cream cheese mixture. They turned out great. Definitely will be making these again!

i made these in a divided pan for brownies where you can take out the divider and they're divided (don't know if I'm describing it well).... brownies don't usually stick and I used spray but these really stuck to the dividers.  Oh well... froze what wasn't appealing for ice cream topping :)

Not much to add to what's already been written.  Nice, quick easy dessert to dress up a boring box of brownies (which I always have on hand for a chocolate fix).  I think the brownies would taste more like cheesecake if I'd chilled them before serving.

These brownies were excellent!  They look and taste great, are super easy to make and are very moist.  My family gives them two thumbs up.  I will definitely make these again.

I have made this recipe before, for St. Patrick's Day, I added green food coloring to the cream cheese.  I used a good quality dark chocolate brownie mix, and cooked them a tad longer, and I am glad I did otherwise they would have been undercooked.  It's a delicious recipe!

These look professionally done. I tricked a friend with, Ghirardelli Double Fudge brand of brownie mix, she couldn't believe I made these from a box, they are so good! This will dress up my cookie plate for Christmas. I put 2/3 prepared brownie mix into a 9 by 7 sprayed tin foil pan. I mixed the cream cheese mixture with the one egg, added 2 tablespoons of icing sugar, and 1 capful of vanilla to give the mixture some yummy oomph. As I spread the cream cheese onto the batter there was simply not enough cheese mixture. I did not want the cheese layer to sink and disappear into the base layer. I mixed up 1/2 a block more of cream cheese with 1 capful of vanilla and 1 tablespoon of icing sugar. I spread the new mixture of cream cheese onto the untouched areas of the brownie batter. This amount of cheese was plenty. I dropped the remaining batter onto in large blobs and began to drag the knife through it. I will add less batter to the top next  It looked a mess as I started swirling the knife through it. Then the pretty swirls started. I stopped when the cheese and chocolate had the pretty dragged effect all over it. I had to bake it for 20 minutes in total. It was wet still at, the extra 5-minute point, wet in spots at the 15-minute mark, and done at the 20-minute mark. I used a tinfoil pan to transport to a party. I lined my tin foil pan with more non-stick tin foil. PS swirling the mix is fun. I will warm them and add chocolate/caramel sauce with ice cream, sometimes.

Cheesecake part was too liquid-y & didn't taste or have the texture I expected. It was not like ones I had before.
I don't know if its that it is better to use powdered sugar or if I overbeat it. I see other reviewers had a problem with theirs being too liquid-y as well though so I don't think I will try the recipe again.

These were an epic fail for me, but it was my own fault/ I wasn't sure how much to swirl the brownie and cheesecake mixture. i think i did it too much and the cheesecake was non-existant except for the cake-like brownies that turned out. Also, the timing is wrong for this. It says to make as directed on brownie box-- wrong. mine said 24 min. It ended up being like 45 minutes because of the extras. I'm sure next time they will be good but all i had was a cake-like brownie that took 45 minutes to cook and 600 extra calories thanks to the "cheesecake" mixture which i didnt even taste :(

These were really easy to make and yes if you use an 8x8 pan it takes longer. Next time I think I'm gonna try to make more of the cheesecake part as I'm a huge cheesecake fan.

Made this for a work function last evening. They were just a great hit that they disappeared in no time. I only made one slight adjustment as others suggested and that was add vanilla extract to cream cheese mixture. Will be making again soon.

I really liked these brownies. I used the Fudgy Brownies on this site for the base. An easy way to spruce up brownies and make them extra special. I will add vanilla to the cream cheese mixture next time, but otherwise it was great. Thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe and have made it several times for parties.  I make the brownies in an 8 x 8 or 9 x 9 pan so they aren't too thin.  I add 1 tsp of vanilla to cream cheese mixture and chocolate chips to the top before baking.  I used the Betty Crocker dark chocolate brownies and I save some of the brownie mixture to put on top of the cream cheese mixture before using the knife to marble.  So yummy!

Very easy, and they turn out to be very good.  Will be using this one again.  I made them last night, and my guests were very impressed.  I recommend using a fudge brownie mix, goes really well with the cheesecake flavor.

Incredibly easy. Perked up my normal brownie recipe. Just had to add 20 min to the cooking time due to increased thickness. Cooked until brown around the edges.

Ohhh, these are Good! I didn't have access to a hand mixer today, so I used 8oz of "whipped" cream cheese (which I let sit on the counter for a while) and a metal whisk - seemed to work just fine. Used Betty Crocker Fudge Brownies box mix and I thought there was a little too much of the cream cheese mixture (in comparison to the brownie mix in the pan), so I only used about 3/4 of it. And I did add 1tsp vanilla as suggested by so many others. Lined my 13x9" baking dish with parchment paper, which I definitely recommend for easy removal and cutting. Mine took 10-12 mins longer to bake than the package instructions (so for those using an 8x8 pan... yeah, probably not going to work properly). They look pretty and taste Fantastic! Best once completely chilled. And THANK YOU to Sue for mentioning the use of a plastic knife to cut brownies. I'd never heard that tip before and it works beautifully!  Thanks for sharing this recipe - love them.

I had to bake this an extra 20 minutes and it still wasn't done (I was afraid of overbaking the brownies, so I took them out of the oven anyway). They were still good, if a bit unbaked in the middle.

It is a terrible recipe! The cream cheese doesn't mix up like it should. The recipe should specify whether granulated sugar or powder sugar. Granulated makes it runny and won't set up right.

Very easy recipe.  Didn't make any substitutions or additions.  Tasted really good, but my only small gripe is that the cheesecake taste got a little lost in the brownies.  Perhaps it was because I sandwiched the cheesecake layer between two layers of brownies.

I was first drawn to this recipe because it looked so easy to make. I love easy recipes and certainly was not disappointed by this one. The two desserts I love most are cheesecake and brownies so why not combined the two. In order to spice up this recipe, I added in a bag of butterscotch chips into the brownie mix. I have to say that this took away from the cheesecake flavor. However, it did make it the brownies sweeter. I love rich brownies and by adding any type of chips (chocolate, white, butterscotch, etc.) you will definitely get richer brownies. I think it’d be interesting to try cherry chips to have cherry chocolate cheesecake brownies. The only issue I had with these brownies is they took a long time to get done. I used an 8 x 8 pan and baked them according to the package which said 35 minutes. They needed to back an additional 15 minutes and then they still were not done. Overall, I say they baked for at least an hour which made the outsides extra crunchy. I would suggest putting them in a 9 x 13 pan so they will bake more evenly.

These are good and a best seller when I take my baked goods around to raise money. I really whip up the cheesecake part till it is super fluffy and add a bit more sugar, between 1/3 to 1/2 cup. I have also added raspberry flavoring to it for a twist. I tried adding raspberry preserves to the brownie part, but if needs to be on top and used sparingly or it will stick to the bottom of the pan as it settles as they bake. This also lends itself to additions of chocolate chips, or whatever sounds good or is hanging around the kitchen.

This is surprisingly simple, but I don't care for brownie mix. I used my own brownie mixture instead, and it turned out pretty well. This is more of an add on to a brownie recipe than a recipe in itself (if that makes any sense) but when I need a cream cheese brownie, this is where I get the recipe from.

SO EASY! SO DELISH!  my husband nearly DIED when he came home from his third shift job to find that i'd left these treats on the stove for him... i added about a tablespoon of lemon juice and a table spoon of vanilla to the cream cheese mixture, and substituted a half cup of stevia for the cup of sugar.  i also baked mine in a 10inch casserole/pie plate, so they were on the thick side and took closer to 45 minutes of baking time.
they were GORGEOUS and SCRUMPTIOUS! will definitely be making these gems again!

These have been my go-to brownies for years! I use Giardelli double chocolate mix, and they turn out PHENOMENAL! Very fudgy. Bring them to get togethers and the other guests' brownies sit while these disappear first!

If you use the cheapest brownie mix, the "cheesecake" part will make it fluffy! Its not too over-whelming, either. Its definately saved in my favorite recipes, & will go on my blog!

So easy and soooo good! The only minor addition was that I added 1 tsp. of vanilla to the cheesecake mixture. Everyone enjoyed these, thanks!

I love it when I can make a really simple dessert that looks like it took a lot of skill. This is one of 'em! I added a splash of vanilla extract to the cream cheese/sugar mixture and it made a tasty improvement on an already delicious base. The brownies were a crowd pleaser, for sure.

YUM! the only difference I made was, I took someone elses advice and added vanilla bean flavoring to the cheesecake mix, I think that really helped with the flavor. will definately make this over and over agian.

These were so easy and very good! I followed the recipe exactly. They were moist, and I liked the cheesecake flavor the cream cheese mixture gave to an otherwise ordinary brownie. The one thing I would do differently next time is bake them a bit longer, because they were a little crumbly, and I think I underbaked them.

I just tried this tonight. Unfortunately, I used an 8x8 pan and it seems to be taking FOREVER ( I mean in the vicinity of 2 hours + to get the bottom baked. But it does taste DELICIOUS. Very good idea for sure. I just need to figure out how to bake it faster. I have the temp low because I don't want to burn the top while trying to cook the bottom.

I was disappointed, especially after reading such rave reviews. I followed the recipe step by step. I had to bake the brownies for about 30 additional minutes more than instructed on the box, as both layers were still dripping wet. And while the taste was melt in your mouth, the texture was a real mess. As I attempted to slice them into squares, the cheese layer separated from the brownie layer, while the brownie layer fell into pieces. Nearly a quarter of the pan ended up as a crumbled mess. I finally gave up and told my husband we have some delicious brownie bits for ice cream sundaes. So 2 stars for the taste only.

Really good!  Nice recipe for when you're in a hurry to have a yummy dessert and but don't have many ingredients on hand.  My only problem is the brownie mix I used called for an 8x8 pan but I cooked them in the 9x13, so brownies were a little thin but still tasted great.

These brownies are wonderful! I didn't change any of the ingredients. I prepared a supreme brownie mix and pour 2/3 of the batter in a 9x9 glass dish. I then prepared the cream cheese mixture and poured the all the mixture on top. Then I weaved a remaining chocolate batter on top. I used a knife and created a swirl. I baked it for about 45 minutes. Superb! No reason to alter any ingredients! :)

Excellent and Easy! These were eye popping at a party and everyone wanted to know how I made them look like that. I suggest adding a bit of vanilla to the cheesecake spread for extra flavor.

So easy and super yummy!  I would even like to add some raspberries to it and I think it would be even better.  :)  I agree with putting 1/2 the brownie batter in, then the cheesecake mixture, then the rest of the batter.  It makes the zebra effect come out a lot better.

Wonderful brownies, husband came home during work just to try them. My swirls look better than the picture I used a knife to make them. Could be a little more chocolatey though so next time I will add chocolate chips to batter.

I made this for a friend's birthday party, and wow, did everyone love it! It's very rich though, but I like it that way. Unfortunately I don't have a mixer, so it was a bit hard trying to prepare the cream cheese mixture and get rid of the lumps, but I was able to get everything done with a wooden spoon and extra effort :) Thanks for the recipe!

Good, rich.  Hard to mess up a box mix!  Disappointed about the cream cheese mixture.  Next time I'll double it so it will be mixed into the entire batter as opposed to just the top.  Had to cook longer than the box directions called for.

These were really good. A good time saving dessert if you're pressed for time. The kids loved them.

Really good.  I also added chocolate chips to the cream cheese mixture.  Don't know how aesthetic the top layer came out...but quick and delish.

Adults gave this 5 stars, kids gave them no stars. I used the cake-like brownie recipe and added a splash of vanilla to the topping and they turned out great.  Thanks for the easy-to-do recipe!

I used it following my brownie mix's instructions for cake-like brownies. Maybe if I used the fudge-like recipe (I think the difference is in the amount of eggs) it would have turned out a little better. They tasted better cooled than warm out of the oven

Delicious and very easy.  I needed a way to jazz up the box mix and this was perfect.  I topped them with sliced and fanned strawberries.  I took them to a dinner and they went really fast.

Thought these were just okay. I gave this  4 stars because as far as the recipe goes, its good! Just didn't add that much, but some extra fat content in my opinion. Thanks anyway!

So delish you have to hide them! Did as other reviewers and put 2/3 of brownie mixture then cream cheese mixture and finish with the rest of brownie mixture. Also added vanilla extract to the cream cheese mixture.

This is a favourite dessert in our house for sure!  It's easy -- although not necessarily quick.  I find it takes about 50% longer than the regular brownie recipe to bake.

Fantastic effort to outcome ratio on this recipe. This is perfect for when a last minute dessert is needed. Corner Bakery sells these for something like $2 each. Way cheaper to make yourself. Only problem is in the recipe suggesting that you follow the baking instructions on the back of the box... when you add these extra ingredients you're going to have to bake it a good deal longer than the box suggests. I've made these twice and I don't even know how long they took; that's how many times I kept checking if they were done yet. You need to at least give an extra 3-5 minutes to start.

To die for as is.  Made exactly as the recipe stated, and they came out beautifully.  I also made a low fat version with low-fat brownie mix, egg whites, and fat free cream cheese, and tasted just as good.  Excellent when topped with strawberries and fat-free whipped topping.

These were good but my husband and I both think the ratio of brownie to cheesecake should be increased. If two packages of cream cheese were used I think these would taste more like cheesecake brownies which, in my opinion, would be tastier!

Could this recipe be easier?  No matter where I bring this I never have to deal with leftovers, everyone loves them from my in-laws to my husband's guy friends to the members of my stay at home mom group.  This is one of my stock recipes, thanks so much!

These were okay. I think I may try a different recipe next time.  There seemed to be too much cream cheese mixture, so I only used about half, but wished I'd followed the recipe a bit closer.  Thank you for posting though!

I had my own recipe for this that I made more than 15 years ago but since I didn't want to look for it I opted to use my favorite resource, allrecipes.  Was pleased to find a few options to choose from, particularly one that starts with packaged brownie mix -still my favorite.
This is still in the oven baking so I will hold off on the rating/raves until I taste the final product.

These are very tasty and pretty. I followed the recipe exactly and cooked 10 min. longer than the package directions and they were undercooked in the middle(not the fault of the recipe, but whatever i always do wrong when cooking brownies)! Parchment paper makes it so easy to remove from the pan, and keeps edges from burning and makes for easy clean up. Now, i just have to figure out how to properly cook a brownie!

Made these for my cousin and her hubby and they liked them enough to want the recipe...I thought the cheesecake mixture looked like way too much, so I didn't use it all - probably should have, might have been a more pronounced cheesecake flavor if I did - but impressive to look at and rather tasty.

Excellant!  I also used Betty Crocker's Dark Chocolate Brownie mix and it was the perfect combination of sweetness and richness.

I love this simple, delicious way to improve on a typical boxed brownie!  I've made it several times and everyone really likes them.  I recommend saving about 1/4 of the brownie batter, and drizzling it on top after drizzling the cheese mixture, and THEN swirling.  This way some of the "cheesecake" winds up as a sort of "middle layer" of the brownie as opposed to just on top.  I've found it to result in a prettier swirl and more appealing presentation as well.  

Can't go wrong with this one!

I used a homemade brownie recipe rather than a box mix, and added mini chocolate chips to the top. Turned out great, they taste terrific!

These were excellent. My family thought I had bought them from a restaurant! I did add a little flour, water, and vanilla extract to the cheesecake filling. I also served it with fresh raspberries. It was fabulous!

I didn't use a mix; I made the Baker's chocolate one bowl brownies (recipe on the box of unsweetened baking chocolate.)  Turned out chewy and delicious.

These were good, not outstanding. I was impatient and microwaved the cream cheese to soften- DON'T do this, it makes the cream cheese layer weird and spongy.

I really liked these Cheesecake brownies.  I've never liked things ultra sweet, and thus, the cheesecake flavor was a great addition to the brownie mix.  I added a tablespoon of flour, two tablespoons of butter, and vanilla, to the cheesecake mixture before swirling it into the brownie mix.  I also cooked these for about 40 minutes.  They would be awesome with some Vanilla Bean or Cheesecake Frozen Yogurt or something.

Update: Like others said, they are twice as good the day after and refrigerated.

We didn't care for these too much.  They were ok but nothing I'd make again.  The plain ol' brownies out of the box are better.  They were very easy and looked pretty though!

Absolutely delicious. I combine this recipe with the "Frosted Cake Brownies" recipe and they come out wonderful. I do agree that these taste better after being in the fridge for a day.

This is a very good brownie. I used Hershey’s cocoa and made brownies. Then made the cream cheese mixture and swirled it through the brownie batter. They were fudgey but still good.

Turned out very moist, cream cheese NEEDS to be marbled, "perfectly", or else the taste is off-putting. We recommend serving either chilled or warmed. Great for Holiday baking! because you can dye the cream cheese accordingly.

I was expecting to be totally wowed when I took the first bite.  Okay as far as brownies go, but not the best I've ever had.  Maybe next time I'll add chocolate chips or try a different brownie mix, if I make them again.

This was simple and delicious. Cheesecake brownies are a personal favorite of mine, but too often I encounter really dry ones...not these though. I used a brownie mix with fudge and little chocolate chips in it. As a previous commenter suggested, I added some vanilla to the cream cheese mixture. I poured that over the brownie mix, swirled it around on top and put it in the oven. It took a bit more time than regular brownies to cook, but it was well worth it! I will definitely save this recipe, it looks nice, taste great, and is really easy to make.

If you're out of brownie mix like me, I suggest using "Brooke's Best Bombshell Brownies". I just omitted the chocolate chips (which I'm sure would have still be good) and then put the cream cheese layer on top. My son did ask me if my brownies were sick, so as you can tell they didn't look that great! I couldn't get much chocolate mix to come through when I swirled it so it's mostly white on top. Next time I'll save a little batter and dribble it on top so it swirls better. They were a bit gooey, so I'll cook them  lower for longer than 45min. next time, but they did taste great!

This didn't have nearly as much of a cheesecake flavor as I was expecting. Flavor was okay, but nothing special. The best part about the brownies were how pretty they looked. :)  I think I'll try it w/ strawberry cream cheese next time as someone else suggested, that sounds awesome!

These were okay.  The brownies are better straight from the box though.  I was dissapointed, as was my family, we were just expecting something spectacular I guess.

I would have given 3 stars, but I think it may have been my fault. Getting the timing right was a little tricky.  Needed longer than package directions, but when I baked longer to cook the middle, the cheesecake turned brown.

These are the best brownies I have ever had!  The prep time was minimal and it was cheap to make.  They did take longer to cook than the box recipe called for, as other people have said as well.  I used fat free cream cheese and it still had a lot of flavor.

This was a great recipe!! If you love regular out-of-the-box brownies, you'll love these! The cream cheese is a nice touch.  I followed the recipe but I may try a different flavor of cream cheese or add some vanilla or almond extract just to try - but it's great as is!

I really enjoyed this recipe, simple and elegant. Unfortunatly, my brownie mix was half the size recommended in the recipe so I had to cut the recipe in half. I loved the taste of cheesecake and brownie together and had no problems with the recipe. Thank you Nat!

I made these in heart-shaped muffin tins for Valentine's Day.  My cream cheese mixture came out a little runny, and it was hard to swirl in the muffin cups, but they were still delicious.

I followed the recipe as written and these turned out really well.  Nothing too fancy, but a nice way to jazz up a plain box brownie mix.  I prepared the brownies per the "cakelike" directions and they were nice and fluffy.  I also used a glass baking dish (if that matters).  No problems with lumpy cream cheese or runny batter over here.

These taste good, look good, and were easy to make- nothing way out of the ordinary but great for a quick treat. My only complaint is that my cream cheese mixture never got completely smooth..I mixed it for a long time with a stand mixer, and even after trying different speeds and leaving it on for probably 5-10 minutes, the mixture was still very lumpy but as far as I can tell (I've only tried the scraps!)it didn't really affect the taste or texture.

It was delicious.....I always thought brownies were too boring so this is a good way to spice them up. I should have mixed the cream cheese mix into the brownie mix a little more because the cream cheese mix just layed right on top. But it did make a beautiful marble design. I would definitly recommend it, it was so easy and yummmmmmy!

I felt these were too thin in a 9x13 pan. The cream cheese mixture was runny and did not swirl nicely (even though I only used the egg yolk). Family still ate them, but I will stick to my own cream cheese cupcake recipe.

Great recipe!! Not only is it good, it is so easy to prepare and everyone will think you spent a lot of time making them. I have made this several times and they disappeared quick. I would recommend this to anyone who has to make a dessert in a hurry or is a fan of cheesecake and brownies.
