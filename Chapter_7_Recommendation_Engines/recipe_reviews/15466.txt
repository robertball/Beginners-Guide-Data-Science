I am giving these a strong 5 but with *large adjustments* I made them 3 times to get what I thought was a perfect PB Cookie:I always use part butter part crisco(I like the texture)so.. 1 stick of BUTTER, 1/4 c.Crisco,I use 1 cup of Crunchy PB, 3/4 cups of chocholate chips, 3/4 cups of P.B. chips,I have to use 1/2 cup more flour, I use milk(don't go over the 1/4 c. or they wil get candy like & to soft) I do pop in a pinch of cinnmn. NO nuts..the crunchy pb works great,cook for 14 min. (I live in Oregon) GREAT COOKIE!!

WOW, these cookies are phenomenal! I did make a few changes, 3/4 cup peanutbutter, a 1/4 more flour and oats, and I added some finely chopped peanuts (cause i forgot to get crunchy peanutbutter)plus I used milk rather than water, baked at 350 for 14 minutes. Thank you Anna, these cookies are going in my permanent cookie file!

AWESOME COOKIE!!!  I added a little more peanut butter & about another 1/4 C flour, used peanut butter chips (didn't have chocolate on hand), dropped them on the cookie sheets in BIG spoonfuls, baked a little longer than recipe recommended.....perfection!!  This is the peanut butter cookie recipe I've been searching for a very long time....YAHOO I finally found the best peanut butter cookie recipe on the planet!! My opinion is shared by my family included my 2 year old son who is quite the little cookie critic!!  Try these, you won't be disappointed!

add 1 cup rice krispies at the end with the choc chips...they give a great crunch and make this an "everything" cookie, great for kids too!

substitute 1/4 c milk for the 1/4 c water--it helps soften the oats and improves the texture of the cookie--milk is traditionally used in recipes with oats.
increase peanut butter to 1/2 cup, and add an extra 1/4 cup flour as they can be a bit sticky. a mega yummy cookie!

Yummy, yummy!!  I was looking for something different and out of the ordinary.  So, I took advice from a lot of other reviewers and combined it.  Here's what I did....substituted milk for the water, used 1 cup peanut butter, added 1 t cinnamon, 1/2 t salt, 1/2 c butterscotch chips and 3/4 c coconut.  They were soooo good!!  I also baked them for about 12 minutes.  Leave them on the cookie sheet for several minutes before putting them on the cooling grid so they don't fall apart.  My cookies didn't look anything like the picture, but more like a traditional oatmeal cookie.  Great recipe!!

I made some minor changes to the this recipe and was quite pleased with how they turned out.  I increased the peanut  butter to 1/2 a cup, substituted sugar for equal amount of SPLENDA sweetener and omitted the water altogether.  This made for a lighter textured cookie and a lower calorie option! Very good cookie.

We really liked those. Not too sweet, not too peanut buttery, not too chocolatey, just really nice, and soft and crunchy at the same time. Mine looked nothing like the ones in the photo, but were still quite edible :) My batter was of a great consistency, I had no problems with this recipe (unlike other people did). Might add chopped pecans to them next time, for extra crunch. Yes, we'll be having them again! I also froze half the mixture to cook at a later date and that worked really nicely too. I chopped slices of the frozen dough and baked as per the directions. Yum!!!

I thought this recipe lacked a strong distinct flavor.  Not bad, but not the best recipe ever.

I made these on a whim a few nights ago because the ingredients matched what I commonly have in my cupboards. I followed some of the suggestions about adding more peanut butter and substituting milk for water, and they turned out beautifully! My boyfriend and his mother (very picky eaters) LOVED them, especially because they stay so soft. Thanks for the great recipe!!

this cookie was good but  I think they need to be cooked longer, and they fall apart, so I am going to try these by cutting out the water. I think that is to much liquid for a cookie recipe

I just don't understand the high ratings by some.  It was more of a cake like cookie, dense, with little if any taste.  It rose like a little cake; I'm sorry, but cookies should be sweet and chewy, not bland and flat cake like creatures.  I won't be making this recipe again...sorry.  I believe in telling it like it is.

Wonderful taste & texture!  My family ate this up quickly.  I added more oats than it said because I was in the mood for an oatier flavor.  I also was out of vanilla & used almond extract, delicious!  Will be making this again with Reeces pieces.  Mmmm!

Just made 'em, and I approve! I followed the recipe to a T, except I used steel cut oats and subsituted a cup of whole wheat flour for the white. These really are a combination of the three cookies - they spread like chocolate chip, are crumbly like oatmeal, and had a bit of crunch around the edges like a peanut butter cookie. One thing I found: It took more like 14 minutes to get a cookie cooked enough that I could get it off my baking sheets in one piece. I will be making these again.

awesome Cookies, Everyone loved them even my in-laws had some. I followed some reviews and added less water. I also added an extra half cut of white chocolate chips and let the batter rest for a few min. They were delicious.

I was excited to try these after reading the reviews and eating a similar cookie my cousin had baked.  I followed the recipe with just a couple minor modifications make by other reviewers, but quite honestly found the end product rather "blah."  I think they needed salt - and maybe something else.  One thing that occurred to me afterwards is that I used Adams peanut butter (non-homogenized). This may have contributed to the texture problems: the batch I just made from a  different recipe with Jiff PB turned out much tastier.

These were really good!  The only changes I made to the recipe were to add more PB because we are PB nuts and then I had to add a bit more flour to the mix.  I took these to work and everyone just raved about them!  Thanks for sharing!

I must have done something wrong.  They taste ok, super rich, but the consistancy is perhaps too dense.

Theses cookies were nothing of what I thought they would be.  The ones in the picture look absolutely delicious.....but the ones I made look dry and crusty.  Although they are moist, I can barely taste the peanut butter and the oatmeal.  Adding water was a big mistake.  That should never be added to a cookie recipe. Next time I will add two cups of peanut butter and exclude the water.

the water in the recipe or what.  Being wet also made them take longer to bake than what was in the recipe.  The taste ratio of peanut butter, chocolate chips and oatmeal was excellent, I just wish they were fuller.

I read the review BEFORE I made these. There were some good suggestions and I too made the following adjustments: I used 1/4 cup of milk instead of water. I used 1 3/4 c of flour and 1/4 tsp more baking powder (not soda - either is fine)and 1 c of crunchy peanut butter. I also used 1/2 a bag of semi sweet choc chips. I used the other ingredients as directed in the original recipe. I baked for 12 minutes (set kitchen timer). The cookies came out perfect. approx 30-40 cookies depending how large the drops are - I used a tablespoon not a teaspoon

I couldn't decide what kind of cookies to make so I searched for a cookie that had everything and I found this recipe. These cookies are really yummy the only thing I changed was I put 2 Cups of chocolate chips since 1 cup was not enough for us - ha! I like the subtle peanut butter flavor with the texture of the oatmeal. I might try next time putting 1 Cup of chocolate chips and 1 Cup peanut butter chips just to enhance the peanut butter flavor.

These are fantastic, both with and without the chocolate chips! I used the adjustments recommended by others (milk instead of water, extra 1/4 cup of flour and oats) and they turned out beautifully soft and tasty!

The texture and consistency were fine, and they looked SO good coming out of the oven...but they were incredibly bland. Totally blah. Very disappointing.  I even did as others suggested and added PB, etc. DEFINITELY not making these again.

Perhaps it is me but mine fell apart before i could get them off the cookie sheet. I followed the recipes exact and they were a mess for me. The pieces were very good though so the flavor of the cookie was great but they didn't hold their shape for me. :( I'll try them again though and if they still fall about, I'll just have to add them to vanilla ice cream. ;) Oh what a shame! ;)

Fabulous cookies and quit simple to make. Thought it was weird to put water in a cookie recipe though but it seems to have worked out fine. I cut the chocolate chips down to a little over a half a cup and they tasted great. I recommend this recipe.

These cookies are sweet, but oddly bland.  Not enough of a peanut butter taste to actually be peanut butter cookies....not chocolatey enough to be chocolatey.  Indistinctive and not really worth the trouble to prepare.  I followed the recipe exactly, making none of the changes suggested by other reviewers.

This recipe is easy but it lacks flavor. I added more peanut butter because I thought 1/3 cup was not enough. Something is missing --maybe salt.

This was excellent.  I took others' advice and used 1 tbls. milk in place of water.  Because we have sugar issues I also cut the white sugar in half and measured brown sugar unpacked.  No one noticed.
The chocolate chips and peanut butter made these cookies sweet enough.

I lost my favorite recipe from my grandmother, so went in search of a new one. This is an amazing find- my kids and I loved it from the first taste of the batter :0) We followed the recipe but wanted to add in some M&Ms so used half and half chocolate chips. DE-licious.

These cookies were okay.  They were a bit on the bland side for me--I couldn't really taste the peanut butter.  I personally prefer oatmeal cookies to be chewy, and while these had a nice moist, soft texture (closer to cake-like than oatmeal-cookie-like), I won't be making them again.  If you just love peanut butter cookies, you might enjoy them.

Overall good recipe but cannot really taste the peanut butter, so a bit of a waste.  I did double thre recipe and added 1 cup of PB but still not enough may try again but adding more PB.

I liked the recipe (and so did my husband), but made some minor changes: cut the amount of butter in half and replaced with canned pumpkin, used peanut butter chip instead of chocolate chips (as you can see, I love Peanut Butter!), and also added 1/2 cup of chopped nuts for more nut flavor.  These are delicious!!!!

This was my third time making these and this is definitely one of the best cookies I've ever had. Here's what to change/add:

Use 1 cup pb instead of 1/3
Add1 t cinnamon
Add ½ t salt
Use ¼ cup more of flour

And bake for 14 minutes. It's best to make the cookies a little smaller to make sure the middle gets done. They fall apart right out of the oven but after a couple of minutes they will stay together easily. So good.

Very delicious.  I used 1/2 cup of peanut butter instead of 1/3 cup, and added peanuts (I put them in a bag and slammed them with a metal ladle to crush them a bit) and mixed them in.  I scooped closer to a TBSP size dollop for each one, and baked them at 375 degrees for about 11 minutes.  The result is a chewy, crunchy, chocolately, peanut-buttery, delicious cookie!

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. However, like most people I made some adjustments. First, I used only 1/4 cup butter because I upped the peanut butter to 1 cup + (estimated) I also only used 1/2 cup brown sugar. I added cinnamon and changed the water to milk. Also omitted the chocolate chips because I didn't have any. They turned out amazing though! :) Will most definitely make again.

Had a craving for cookies just like these.  As per other reviews, they could've had more peanut butter flavor.  I didn't measure the peanut butter, but I know I added more than what the recipe called for.  I also used some whole wheat flour in place of the all purpose flour.    I had to bake for about 13 - 15 minutes.  Came out soft and chewy...yum!

Soooooooo good. I loved these cookies. I took the other reviewers suggestions and added milk instead of water and added more flour and more peanut butter and cooked them for 12 minutes. I added a cup and a half of peanut butter and a half a cup of milk. Very moist.

Yeppers, this was a great cookie.  Lots of flavors combine to make it very yummy.  For some reason I used milk instead of water, but that was my only change.  Thanks for a good recipe.

When i saw this recipe I just had to try it! Plus, my family had been bothering me to make peanut butter cookies for them.
How ever, I did make a few changes. I did what another review said she did ( add 1 cup rice krispies at the end and increase the flour one more 1/4 cup and pb to 1/2 cup) I aslso added 2 table spoons of cocoa and instead of regular chocolate chips i used white and milk chocolate swirled chips.
They turned out great and made 24 decent sized cookies. Half of them were gone by the next day! Will definetly use again! :)

UPDATED 4/22/05 - Hi!  Me again - left a review 8/19/04.  Was here scoping for a banana bread recipe and felt the need to let you know (again),Anna how wonderful these cookies are.  They've become a real staple in our household.  They are so versatile - and while your original recipe was great my kids just love to add new things.  Since the recipe is so basic and simple it really works out well.  We've used m&m's in place of the chips and butterscoth or peanut butter in place of choc chips, traded a cup of oats for a cup of coconut.  And once - just for the heck of it I added a 1/2 cup of pumpkin.  I liked it - kids didn't.  Ah, well :)  Really moistened em up though.  And while I like em right out of the oven, my strange little ones prefer em frozen still.  I make these cookies atleast twice a month - and when they're gone the kids (and husband) are after me for more :)  Thanks again for the great recipe.

Made these exactly as the recipe states. The texture was great, crisp on the edges and soft and cakes on the inside, but I was definitely missing the peanut butter flavor.  Needs more peanut butter, but I would certainly make these again with that minor adjustment.  Everything else about this cookie was great.

easy recipe and great tasting cookies, i followed the directions, but agree with other reviewers, it could have used more peanut butter.  I also added coconut to them mixture.

These cookies are amazing, but I did incorporate Leanne's edits of 1 cup peanut butter, an extra 1/2 cup flour, 1/4 milk instead of water, and 1/2 tablespoon of cinnamon (what oatmeal cookie DOESN'T have cinnamon??) and a pinch of salt.  I also added 1/2 cup of m&m's and 1 cup butterscotch chips.

I used a 1/4c standard disher/ice cream scoop and got about 30 cookies.  I did notice that on a lighter, shiny-surfaced cookie sheet they spread a little more than on my darker sheets.  They also come out a little crumbly but nothing that's going to dissolve in your fingers.

And they are RICH.  And SO GOOD!

Well since I'm the one with the account I get to do the posting. My daughter made these cookies today with a friend and they were fantastic. Only change she made was instead of the chocolate chips (we didn't have any and I wasn't going to the store), she subbed in Reeces Pieces. Great texture, and they made more than 3 dozen. Will make again for sure.

This is one of my absolute favorite cookie recipes!  I have never had a failed batch and no other cookie goes better with a large glass of milk than this one.  A few minor changes:  double the amount of peanut butter, add 1/4c more flour, sub milk for the water and you have the perfect cookie.  Enjoy!

The cookie dough was the best, could have eaten it by the spoonful!.  The baked offering needed more sugar as it wasn't sweet enough to compliment the peanut butter and chocolate.  This is a soft cookie, not chewy.

These cookies weren't bad - as an Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookie!!  I used about 1 cup of Peanut Butter & even still I couldn't taste it at all.  Don't know if I'll make these again though.

I tried this recipe and liked it, but it had not one flavor that stood out.I made a few changes, instead I added nuts and more of the chips and less oats and it came out very good.A well rounded cookie

Awesome but I did a few changes. I added milk instead of water. I used 1/4 cup coco( just remove egual floor). I added 1/2 cup each white chips, peanut butter chips and choc chips. Kids tried to eat in one day.

This is overall a good recipe.  I didn't find that there was enough peanut butter flavor (even though I had increased the amount to a half cup).  I also used milk instead of water, and cut out half a cup of sugar.  The texture was lovely, and it was a hit with my family.

I agree with another viewer as there wasn't a strong enough flavor to them; my little sister who is a peanut butter lover asked if there was even any peanut butter in these. Next time I would probably even DOUBLE the peanut butter and cut back on the chocolate chips. I would probably give them another shot with some alterations. Thanx !

My family liked it a lot, it is a soft, very light peanut butter taste, slightly chewy cookie.I think I'll try to add more peanut butter next time.I found  that you need to add about 4 min. to cook time when using light metal cookie sheet.

This wasn't as good as I was hoping - I used tips from previous reviewers and used milk instead of water, as well as putting more peanut butter in. Unfortunately, it turned out somewhat bland. I was hoping for a crispy on the outside, soft on the inside sweet but not too sweet cookie. It had the same texture throughout (not crispy on the outside) and wasn't very sweet. It's an okay cookie, but just not what I was hoping for.

This is a very good recipe. I followed others' advice and used milk instead of water, added 1 tsp cinammon, and used 1/4 cup more flour and peanut butter.  My family loved these. I would give them a 5 but since I had to make all the changes, I am giving them a 4.

Great, soft, flavorful, gooey cookie :)

I followed other reviewers on some things.  I used milk instead of water, I increased the flour, added cinnamon too.  I doubled this recipe since I was making xmas baskets...and added molasses at the last minute, just a 1/4 c for the entire dbl batch and they are wonderful!!  Thank you so much for this recipe!!

I only give this 3 stars because I followed the recipe exactly and did not change anything, could barely taste the Peanut Butter and my baking soda must have been old because they did not rise as I would have thought they should have.

Hubby said these were very good and light tasting. I did use milk instead of water,added a little more than 1/2 cup peanut butter and a little more flour. My cookies were a little smaller than the ones in the photo. I made 5 dozen. Will make these again!

I used vegetable shortening because I didn't have butter. I increased the flour to 1 3/4 C. and increased the peanut butter to 1 C.  I added 1/2 t. salt and used quick oats because I didn't have regular rolled oats.  I replaced the water with milk.  Instead of eggs, I used an egg replacer made of ground flax seed and water.  Just blend 1 C. of ground flax seed with 4 C. water in a blender for a few minutes.  1/4 cup flax mixture equals 1 egg.  I used a whole 12 oz. bag of chocolate chips.  I baked these for 12 minutes.  These cookies were great.  I couldn't ask for a more perfect cookie. Hubby and kids gobbled them right up.

A great and delicious recipe when a few changes are made. Use milk instead of water, 1/4 cup more of flour and 1/2 cup of peanut butter. I also added 1 cup of frosted flakes for a sugar kick and the cookies turned out great! The baking time is more like 12 min.

Easy and tasty, but hard to get off the cookie sheets - mine turned out thin. Also, they had to bake closer to 12-15 minutes.

These cookies are awesome!  soft and chewy, moist in the middle and slightly crisp on the bottom.  I made them as a treat for my boyfriend and his family, and they all gobbled them up.  I made them a second time during a family scrabble match, and everyone was fighting over them!  They really are delicious, if you like peanut butter and chocolate they are for you.  Two tips:  if you really like peanut butter, add an extra 1/4 of cup (or more) and also, it comes out better if you add the peanut butter and water AFTER you put in the flour mixture, not before.

OMG! These are the best cookies I've ever made and hubby agrees too! I did as other reviews suggested and used milk instead of water, 3/4 c peanut butter, 2 cups of flour and 2 cups of oats. They melt in your mouth and the best flavors of oatmeal, chocolate and peanut butter! Can't wait to bring to work to share!

As the recipes is, I rate them low. With modifications I am guessing they are much better. . My daughter made these herself and learned the lesson of always reading a few reviews before starting to cook.

Followed the suggestions of other posters: substituted milk for water, increased pb to 3/4 cup, flour to 1 3/4 cup, and oats to 2 1/4 cup. Also added crushed peanuts to make up for my "smooth" peanut butter. Dough was somewhat sticky but cookies are very good. This recipe is a keeper. Thanks to those who made these recommendations.

These are so good that my husband is refusing to let me bring them to the office tomorrow! I made them exactly as the recipe states except I added an extra big scoop of peanut butter and a handful of coconut flakes.

These cookies are awesome.  I took some of the suggestions to increase the peanut butter and substitute milk in for the water.  I also used all whole wheat flour which worked out well.  I've used regular sugar and used the Splenda blends and both have turned out well.  I have also used peanut butter chips in addition to chocolate chips for added creamy PB flavor.

These came out great, I did add some peanut butter chips and chopped nuts to the batch.  Making them extra yummy.  Next time I might add some ground flax seed to make them a little more healthy!  thanks!

So we used "raw" sugar instead of white in this recipe. I think that was a mistake as they came out kinda bland and not so sweet. I'm sure it's a good recipe if you stick to the specs.

I wasn't happy with the way these turned out.  They were bland and cake-like.  I had  a recipe similar to this that had more flavor and was crisp and chewy.  I think the water is unnecessary, instead more butter, peanut butter and a little salt would help.

A nice oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe. I added more vanilla than called for and used creamy peanut butter, as that was what I had on hand. I will make these again.

These cookies are chewy, nutty and delicious, though my audience felt the chocolate chips were  over the top. I'm working on modifying it by adding LOTS of different kinds of nuts to make them even nuttier. Yum!

These cookies are awesome.  The only thing I added were chopped walnuts.  You may want to double or triple the recipe because 18-20 cookies will not be enough.  Great recipe.  Thanks.

Oh my goodness!!  These cookies were so delightful.  I made some changes.  I add 3/4 cup peanut butter, chopped walnuts and I used a variety of chips (chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, and white chocolate chips).  I didn't have a full bag of any of them.  WOW!! The family ate them faster than I could bake them.

These were pretty good!  I didn't read the reviews before making them, and next time I will add a bit more flour, and a bit more peanut butter as they were a bit soft for my taste, but they were delicious!

The cookie batter was very sticky and it was  difficult to get my cookies off the pan after baking.  My cookies almost crumbled after being taken off the pan.  The cookies tasted all right, but I couldn't really taste the peanut butter.

I loved this cookie. The first batch was made to the directions but with chunky peanut butter. I'm always afraid of over cooking so I took them out prematurely and they ended up like soft batch cookies you buy at the store. Still tasty. After that I added more peanut butter and flour as recommended and baked longer. These were pretty fantastic. Next time I will try milk instead of water and adding cinnamon.

This was a great, simple recipe.  I loved it.  I used 1 cup of peanut butter, milk instead of water, more chocolate chips, and I added 1/4 a cup of sour cream to make them soft.  They were great!

These were very addictive. I cooked 1/2 of the cookies according to the directions...Then decided to add more peanut butter and choc chips. I actually pulled them out of the oven to add the extra ingredients, so the choc chips melted through the dough...making it extra yummy.

Great recipe!  Followed other reviews advice, sub'd milk for water, used 1 cup PB, and added the tsp. of cinnamon.  Ended up using WAY too big of a scoop so had to bake longer, however the first off the rack, still warm is UMM UMM Good!  Definetly be making more! BTW, mine didn't look like the pic. either. Still wonderful tasting!

We all enjoyed this cookies very much. We were looking for something with oats and peanut butter, so this recipe got our attention. Also, I intend to switch the white flour with wwheat flour and I know it will be even better for the kids. I did skip the water since the "becel" we use is more liquidy than butter or regular margerine - they still taste great!

I think this is a great cookie.  I read all the reviews B4 I made it. The only thing I did different was to use dark brown sugar & 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.
I had to bake them for 12 minutes.
The recipe made at least 6 dozen.
I will make this again.

These were excellent! I brought 15 to a party, and they were eaten immediately. I upped the peanut butter to about a 1/2 cup, and this added a little more flavor. Even still, the peanut butter was subtle. I also added about a half teaspoon of cinnamon, as others have suggested, and it was perfect.

Great cookies, even though I'm a peanut butter fanatic and would have added a bit more to the mix.  Also, I used quick oats, instead of rolled.  (You work with what you've got).  Still, even though I might have added a little more PB, I find can't seem to stop eating them.  I will be making them again.

Well, I liked the texture of these (not sure why anyone had problems with them being dry) but could not taste the peanut butter at all.  I am so glad I added 2 C of chocolate chips instead of 1 C or these would have tasted like nothing.

Good, but a little too soft - they fell apart too easily (even though they were thoroughly cooked).  If I make them again I'll eliminate the water.  Hubby and kids thought they were good enough but didn't say they were great and weren't clamoring for more (like they were with the whole wheat sugar cookies I recently made from this site).

Perfect!! My whole family enjoyed it. I added peanut butter chips. They would've tasted good without them also. I have made them several times since then.

Maybe it's just me, but these were the worst tasting cookies I've ever had right out of the oven.  There was too much baking soda.  I must give credit, the cookies came out looking very good.  I added 2 cups of semi sweet choc chips and that helped.  2 days later the cookies tasted better.  But overall not a good recipe.  Needs a little work.

I substituted milk for the water, whole wheat flour for the white, splenda instead of the 1/2 C white sugar (you can't even tell the difference), I used egg whites only (from 3 eggs), and added sliced almonds. 
These cookies hit the spot. They were so moist and yummy. I became instantly popular with these. I'm telling you, they're a winner! Thanks Anna!

If you can't decide what kind of cookies to make or if you are looking for flavorful crowd pleasing cookies.........these ARE the cookies to make!
I added a "pinch" of cinnamon to the recipe and I also used crunchy peanut butter and they were delicious!!

I must have done something wrong because these cookies were so bland and tasteless.  I've checked the recipe and it looks like I followed it to a "T".  So, I unfortunately would not recommend these cookies.

Subtle peanutbutter taste makes them even better.  I found the dough too thin so added more oatmeal and then they were great.

my toddler loves oatmeal, so this is a great recipe for him. Of course he felt the recipe needs more chocolate! And I'd have to say it was great with an extra 1/2 cup of chips :)

These cookies are fabulous and just the way I like them--soft and chewy in the middle and crisp around the edges. I added milk chocolate chips instead of semisweet and I also added 1/2 tsp of kosher salt. We all loved them.

Although I would prefer just a smidge more of the peanut butter taste to come through, this is a fabulous recipe.  My co-workers devoured 4 dozen cookies in a single day.  Make these cookies and they will speak for themselves.

I made these with the adjustment notes in the comments. I added 3/4 cup crunchy pb, sub milk for the water, and increased the flour and it’s by 1/4c. These were amazingly delicious.

These cookies are having an identity crisis- There isn't enough peanut butter flavor to call them a peanut butter cookie and not enough oatmeal flavor to be an oatmeal cookie . Definitely not enough chocolate. These were very bland. If I make them again, I would either add more peanut butter, more chocolate  or some cinnamon.

Increased crunchy p. butter to 3/4 c, added 1/4 c more flour and used whole wheat flour, added 1/4 c more rolled oats and used 1/4 c sugar free vanilla creamer in lieu of  water.  Used dark chocolate and omitted white sugar.  A very healthy delicious cookie!

These were just so good, I did change a couple of things that others did. I used milk not water,,, and I added 12 cup chopped peanuts. One of the best cookies I've ever made. Yummy

I followed other suggestions and increased the peanut butter, I used natural PB, so no extra sugar there. I also reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup, and still found this too sweet, next time I would reduce the sugar more.

These were great!  My son and friends loved them. As suggested in other reviews, I increased the peanut butter.  Insteed of additional flour, I added an additional cup of oatmeal. Definitely a keeper!

I loved the recipe and it turned out very well, but it could use some more peanut butter. I could hardly taste it. I recommend decreasing the butter if you increase the peanut butter to maintain the consistency and prevent the batter from being too oily.

This cookie recipe is very easy to make.  My only real objection with the recipe is that it seems a bit sweet for my taste.  If I make it again, I will likely decrease the sugar slightly.

They were tasty but I made these based on the lovely picture Ali posted.  Alas, they look nothing like that, they don't spread much or get golden brown.  I used a small ice cream scoop to drop the dough, cannot imagine using a teaspoon as directed!  (That would explain the 8-10 minutes cooking time though). It makes about 4 dozen 1 1/2-2 inch cookies this way

I would have given this 5 stars but I made many adjustments from other reviewers and they were delicious.  I used 1 cup crunchy peanut butter, 1 stick butter, 1/4 cup crisco, 2 cups flour and 1/2 tsp salt and, of course, milk instead of water and baked for 15 mins as we like our cookies more on the crispy side.  Those were the only adjustments and next time I am going to try rice krispees as someone mentioned adding them in a review and it sounds really good!

These cookies are delicious. The only changes I made was use 1/2 c of butter and about 1/4 c more crunchy peanut butter. My husband asked me to make these again, he loves to take them to work and have them with his morning coffee.

I've made these cookies in the past with great results.  However, My nine year old nephew needs a gluten free diet and often misses out on treats.  I made these delightful cookies with a gluten free all purpose flor that I purchased at a health food store.  The result was amazing!  Hint:  instead of dropping onto the tray by spoonfuls, roll into a ball and flatten with a fork.

From the suggestions of other posters; I used a full cup of Peanut Butter, 2 cups of flour, and some coconut. ''

Really good cookie, still kind of bland on taste though. 

I will make again, maybe add some more Peanut Butter.

I made some changes: more peanut butter, doubled the baking soda, milk instead of water, more vanilla.  Also, refrigerated the dough for an hour or 2, helped them hold together better and not spread out too thin while baking.  Baking soda helped with a little more rise and salty flavor.  Very good, but still not exactly what I was looking for.

These are super tasty. My only complaint is the rolled oats are not allowed enough to get a good cook. Next time,I will use quick oats which should render a softer more cooked cookie.

Very yummy.  I like the texture, crispy on the outside and soft inside. I did increase the PB to 1/2 cup, reduced the sugar to only 1 cup of dark brown sugar and also reduced the butter to 1/2 cup of butter because I just like cookies less sweet.  Definitely will use this recipe again.

The flavor was yummy, but I didn't care for the texture which was flat and chewy-crispy. I prefer cookies to be puffy and chewy-soft.

Made these cookies exactly as stated in recipe.  Although, they were ok I didn't care the the cake-like consistency and also they did not seem sweet enough for me. Maybe if I would have added some chocolate chips that would have been better.

This recipe is a good base but I did change a couple things. First, I like using Crisco instead of butter. It gives the cookies a better texture and colour. Second, I added about 1/4 C of flour to make them spread a little less in the oven so that they wouldn't all get stuck together. I also added more peanut butter, about 1/4 C as well. I would use more peanut butter than that even cause they didn't taste too peanutty to me which was a little disappointing. Other than that they were actually really good. Everyone at work loved them!

These cookies turned out great.  I subbed 1/2 c. turbinado sugar for 1/2 the brown sugar because I was out.  It added a nice texture.  I also used milk instead of water and increased flour and peanut butter as others did.  Big scoops of dough made large, yummy cookies.

I used mini chocolate chips and added some  cinnamon. Everyone loved them!  They ended up flat and crispy but very flavorful.  Sort of an adult cookie, not overly sweet.

This cookie was just okay. One star because the batter was yummy, one star because the texture was good and one star because it was moist. But there just wasn't much flavor.

My cousin and I made these cookies for a sugar rush, and as far as that goes, they are terrific.  The taste is great and we found ourselves eating the dough ALOT!!!!  We did find the dough a little runny however--maybe we needed a little more flour or a little less water--but it didn't damper the flavor one bit.And the cookies were a little rough coming off of the pan.  But all in all a great cookie that we will make again!

I followed the advice of other reviewers-- I increased the peanut butter, added some cinnamon and added extra oats to thicken the batter. The cookies were still pretty bland. I think they are trying to do too much.

I loved all the reviews, but I have to say when I made it I had to add 1cup more oats and half the water. I also added 1/2 c. of peanutbutter and 3/4c coconut with walnuts and 2T. mollasses. It was perfect. My husband and 40 of his co- workers coulnd't stop eating them

The texture was fine, but the taste was minimal.  I upped the PB to 1C and doubled the chips as well, still not much more than a chocolate chip cookie.

Delicious!  Nice texture, great taste!  Per other reviewers comment, tried adding 1/2 tsp cinnamon and it adds a great flavor.

I was looking for a recipe for cookies and couldn't decide what to make.  These seemed to fit perfectly. These cookies did take longer to bake than the recipe said.  I'm not sure if this was because of my oven or not.  When they were done, they were very good.  I will try them again.

This is a wonderful cookie with all the stuff we love!  Can't wait to try them with the new Special Dark chips.  I think crunchy peanut butter is especially good in these.

I wouldn't say these are bland; I'd say they have subtle peanut butter flavor. That, combined with with texture of the oats, makes for a nice cookie. I made them much bigger than (24 heaping tablespoons + 6 HUGE 2 tablespoons) and baked for much longer--around 16-17 minutes. Mainly I watched to see when the bottoms got brown. They turned out crispy, which was good with the oat texture I was talking about. Long story short, I like them. They are not overpowering in sweetness.

This cookie recipe was extremely dry.  I brought them to work and my co-worker told me it was like eating sand in the Sahara.  That can't be good...

This is one of the best I've tried lately.
Just enough peanut butter, not overpowering.  Chewy AND crispy!  Family and friends all loved them.  Dough seems a bit thin, but no harm.  Makes more than 3 dozen in my kitchen!

Delicious, nutricious and easy to make! We added extra peanut butter and choclate chips to make these soft and chewy cookies even more delicious!
