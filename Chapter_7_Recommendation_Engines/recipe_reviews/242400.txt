Great way to use up some of those small “scraps” when cutting up a watermelon! I used a bit less honey and sugar just because I wanted more of the natural fruit flavor. Turned out great!

I used especially sweet watermelon but still put in the honey. My family LOVED this and asked me to make more.

I just made this recipe 2 days ago and my girls loved it. I had to Google it again today hoping and praying that I would find it and I did! It is now saved as a favorite :) I'm sure I'll be making a lot of this during this summer. Thank you

Very simple to make because of readily available ingredients.  I didn't have any lemons so used lime instead but they turned out great!  My kids love them!

It was exactly as I had hoped. So refreshing. Definitely a keeper. I always have WAY too much watermelon left over, good way to use up the leftover.
