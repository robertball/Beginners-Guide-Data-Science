This salad is refreshing and guilt free!!  I highly recommend it; the only change I made is I reduced the salt to 1/2 teaspoon.

This was delicious! I served it with a simple tilapia and squash soup. I couldn't keep my spoon out of the salad bowl while the fish was cooking. My sweetie asked for this to be put on the regular rotation.

Healthy, yummy, exotic! Do use lime, it's essential. I used Jalapeno pepper instead.

This is so good! Very light, refreshing, and addicting! Like others, I used jalapeño instead of serrano. Next time I might add cilantro. This recipe is a keeper!

This is a delicious combination of flavors. I leave out the onion because I'm not a fan. I've also made it with mango instead of pineapple, which is equally good and almost exactly like another salad I've made (that one is served with a lime-cumin grilled chicken breast and cilantro vinaigrette, which is excellent).

WOW!  This was delicious, and hotter than HADES because I forgot to seed the serranos.  I took this to my weekly women & wine group, and it was an instant hit! All raved about the dish, yet no one complained about the heat -- it might have been the wine not talkin'... I'll definitely make again and try taking out those pesky seeds.

Thanks for sharing a very good recipe. Made half the recipe and still had leftovers.  Used less salt because we watch our sodium and used red pepper flakes because I didn't have a fresh pepper.  Think this is easy to adjust to what you have -  Excellent.

I don't know what to think of this? I have eaten mango salsa, which is a little like this. However, the flavors aren't seeming to blend to me for some reason. I would suggest using fresh pineapple. I used some of pineapple on the store shelves. It didn't give it a bright color. Also, sitting in juice, it may have made it more sweet than it should be for the recipe. The pineapples are very dominant in this. I used lemon juice instead of lime juice. Maybe, the lime is needed. I also subbed jalepeno for the serrano like most others. Now, I just have to figure out some way to use this the best way. On the first day I used it on a quesadilla, which was okay. It made it kind of sweet. I did half of the recipe and it still made about 2 full cups easily. I hate to waste food, but it has been sitting in my fridge so the rest will more likely get tossed.

Light, flavorful and delicious. I just made it following the recipe minus the pepper because of kids who don't like spicy. Everybody loved it and asked for more. It's delicious, very easy and quick, couldn't be better. I will be making it regularly.

Very good salad! I bought a pineapple on sale and had an avocado that was perfectly ripe, so looked through the recipes for a salad that would use these.  I cut the recipe in half.   I had no cucumber so used a red bell pepper instead, and I think I prefer the bell pepper.  One small shredded Serrano seasoned this salad perfectly.   My husband enjoyed this salad very much, as well.

My two kids were skeptical of this while I was quickly putting this together to accompany pork carnitas, but it turned out to be their favorite part of the meal! Had to omit hot peppers because of kid’s delicate tongues but added cilantro. Will definitely make this again. Yummy!

I swapped out the cucumber, which I don’t care for, for mini sweet peppers and added canned artichoke 1/4s. Thickened the juice from canned pineapple with the lime. Just the right touch of sweetness. I love anything that’s fruity.

I made this recipe and it was ok, i wanted to try and freshen it up so i added cider vinegar, replaced the cucumbers with pineapple, orange juice, and iceberg lettuce because i personally thought that it was too heavy with that much avocado, sorry! Try the recipe and make the couple of changes and it was very refreshing and bright...

I had to make some alterations.  The cucumbers don't sit well with the hubby and only used a dash of salt.  Other that that this is a wonderful recipe.  It keeps well for a couple of days, also.  I want to try it as a chicken salad base, too.  I will definitely make this again.

I would reduce the salt personally, but that is just me.  Otherwise super flavorful as is!
