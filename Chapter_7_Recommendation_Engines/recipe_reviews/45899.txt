Very tasty recipe!  I added 2 cloves of chopped garlic.  I also added chopped cucumber to the finished recipe for a little added texture.

This was great served cold on a spinach topped toasted whole wheat bagel bread.  I doubled the rice and avocado, and just used a roasted red pepper and parmesan vinegarette.  I added the tomato to the salad.  Delightful!  Thanks!

Overall it was not that challenging to make and received a fairly positive response from the guys I was cooking for. However I felt it could have used a little more flavor. My suggestion would be to season the meat to taste, and then follow the rest of the recipe.

the other reviews make me think its just me, but this recipe needs serious help. My husband and I though it was seriously bland and kind of dry.

I followed the recipe to a "T" and it's a wonderful light meal.  Would be great for a summer lunch.  My hubs said this is a definite meal to repeat!  

I think next time I'll add some cucumber and use the whole avocado.

This is a great light meal.  I substituted scallions for the onion, used italian parsley, added 1/2 a Jalapeno, and created my own flavored rice vinegar by adding lemon pepper to Aji Mirin rice vinegar. Tasty!

Great recipe!   So far we've just tried it cold (refrigerated the mixture) in warm pitas.  It was flavorful but not overpowering.  The fresh parsley added some great flavor and the avocado was a nice addition.  I definitely recommend this recipe.

Delicious! I love this recipe! I enjoy mild flavors, so I enjoy this recipe as is, and find the flavor stronger the longer it sits on my tongue. However, I read over the reviews just before eating it this time and noticed something: this meal has anti-flavor. There's something strange about it: normally when I add spices to plain food, the spices determines the flavor. In this recipe, the plain dominates. It's hard to taste even the avocado unless I really try. I don't know why... perhaps it's the dressing? Next time, I might try using store-bought Italian dressing in place of the olive oil and rice vinegar. Notes: I added garlic powder and yellow bell pepper, and omitted tomato slices. Also, my rice vinegar was not seasoned. The fresh parsley is an important component of the flavor -- dried isn't nearly as flavorful.

These were magnificent! I made this for the welcome home party for my sister a few days ago. I doubled the rice and avocado as well. She loved them. I usually prefer stuff like this to be warm, but that's just me. Maybe I'll try one cold next time. Delicious recipe. Definitely unique as stated above, but I don't think the picture does it justice.
