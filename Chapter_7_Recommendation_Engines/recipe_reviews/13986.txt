I thought it was a bit too spicy with the chiles, but then again, I used jalapenos.  Also, mozzarella may not be the best choice of cheese because it tends to get chewy once heated.  Cheddar or parmesan might be better.

DELICIOUS!!  I made this for dinner last night, but I made one change -- I used alfredo sauce instead of the tomato-based sauce.  WOW!!!!  It was fantastic!  I will definitely make this again!

I was surprised how tasty this came out! And I'm embarrassed to say I ate the entire thing on my own in one sitting. Next time I'll have to double this recipe if I plan on sharing it. :)

Delicious (and super easy)!  I doubled the recipe, but kept the same amount of chilles (family preference) and I think any more would have been too much.  I used marinara sauce and I do believe you have to be careful on the type of sauce you use.  IMO the "plainer" the sauce, the better the outcome.  The cilantro adds a wonderful flavor.  I wasn't sure if my husband and little guy would like it, but they both cleaned their plates.  This is a definite keeper in our house!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was very delicious. I did make a few changes though... I added about a 1/2 cup of chopped onion and 4 large garlic cloves sliced and instead of fresh cilantro I used 1 tsp of dried cilantro and I used Parmesean cheese instead of Mozzarella... My husband wished that it had some meat in it so next time I think that I will add some ground beef or cooked diced chicken...

This was surprisingly very good! I used one jar of Bertolli spaghetti sauce and 1 tsp of dried cilantro otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. It is quick and extremely easy to make. Delicious!

Would honestly give it about a 3 1/2.  It's a good, different spin to put on ravioli's.  Good every once in a while to mix up the original

I like this recipe, but I think it needs to be more specific on the type of spaghetti sauce; I can see how if you pick the wrong kind to do it with you won't get great results. The comment I got when I made it was that it basically tasted like salsa on pasta, but I don't entirely agree with that. I will make this again.

This was really awesome. The fresh cilantro made this dish! I followed this recipe exactly and recommend it to all who are a little tired of the same old spaghetti sauce taste.

It was alright but the sauce was fairly mediocre.
