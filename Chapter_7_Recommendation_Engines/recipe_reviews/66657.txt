It was wonderful, though I made a modification, using a can of mild green chilies, because my kids don't like spicy foods, and I didn't have jalepenos anyway. I'll try it with the jalepenos some time, though, because without the seeds, they're really mild, and add wonderful flavor! Thank you!

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe.  I used 4 ears of fresh corn, a green pepper and 2 jalapenos because that is what I had on hand.  I also used a little less butter than called for. I baked it in a 8 inch square glass baking dish and it came out perfect.  It was not greasy or runny.  I will definately be making this one again.

Very, very good. Unfortunately I had to leave out the jalapenos (for the kid's sake). Used 2 cans of corn (drained) because it was what I had on hand. I wanted this to have a little thicker consistency, so I first melted the cream cheese and butter together (with no milk). The consistency was perfect, so I omitted the milk altogether but added two cans of diced green chilis (undrained) and the taste was wonderful. I did not use "fat-free" or "low-fat" versions of cream cheese. For the rich, yummy flavor, sometimes you need the fat. Thanks for a great alternative to my corn casserole recipe. This is really quite tasty and made the perfect side dish for tostadas.

This was absolutely wonderful!  It is very rich which is what this dish is named so I don't know why people would complain about it being rich since that is what it is suppoosed to be.  After you take it out, you need to let it cool off for about 10 minutes and it will thicken up.  I added more jalepenos because we like ours really hot.  It was the best recipe that I've ever tried!

Very easy and a big hit with guests.  Added it as a desperate attempt at a mexican side dish and was surprised to see it completely gone at the end of the night.  Would be great as a hearty dip with chips as well.  Fattening but worth it..

This was the star of our dinner and really outshone what was probably a really great maindish.  I made it exactly as written, with the exception of using 1 can of jalapenos instead of the fresh as my grocer was out.  Whew!  One whole can may have been much as it was REALLY REALLY REALLY spicy.  But the sweetness of the corn and red pepper was so refreshing in contrast.  I will definitely make this again and will probably use half a can of jalapenos.  Or rather, I'll just double the recipe except for the jalapenos, because my family could have eaten plenty more of this!  Mmmmmmmmmm!  One of the most surprising and tastiest side dishes I've ever had.  Definitely too rich for every day, but it will make any occasional dinner special!

Made this for dinner tonight.  Used 1 1/2 bags of frozen corn (24 oz instead of 16) heavy cream  instead of milk, 1 tbs Tony C's seasoning and 4 oz can of green chiles instead of the jalapenos. I was a little worried because it looked a slightly runny, but it was absolutely delicious.  The "sauce" did "firm up" a little after standing for about 10 minutes.  Rave reviews from EVERYONE!  Will DEFINITELY be making this again.

be careful if you double this recipe, ours seemed to need less liquid doubled. A very tasty compliment to Mexican meat dishes!

I have made this casserole for years..we LOVE it! I use poblano (4-5) chili's and jalapenos(1-2)...sometimes green chili, if I have some. I remove the seeds and chop into small pieces and then brown in bacon grease. I let them get all roasted looking. Then proceed putting it together. IMO frozen corn is the only thing to use. I always run mine under hot water and drain really good.  I don't use the butter..I don't think it needs it, and maybe a little less milk. If I have it, I grate some sharp cheddar cheese in also. I made this over the 4th...I LOVE IT!!!

Excellent dish! My husband thought it was way too hot. My son and I loved it. I cut the jalapenos down to only 2 T of diced from the jar, used canned mexicorn, pimento pepper, 3 T butter, half & half, and neufchatel. So yummy!

I used one can of mild green chilies in this recipe instead of jalapenos only because I was feeding small children--I made no other changes. This was just okay. There seemed to be more sauce than there was corn and it didn't have a whole lot of flavor. Very bland.

This was fabulous! I needed a Mexican dish for a pot luck, and tried this one.  Only I was concerned it would be too hot, because I tasted it after adding only two jalapenos, and it brought tears to my eyes, so I didn't add any more.  Turns out the peppers loose their heat in the cooking process, I should have followed the recipe.  
I did substitute sour cream instead of milk, and I topped it with a little grated cheese after it was done, about 2Tablespoons.  It got rave reviews and everyone wanted the recipe. What a success!

Great flavor! I used sliced jalapenos from a jar-approximately 2 jalapenos worth(& they have seeds:) Plenty of spice for us. We added this inside burritos-delish!! I do think I would halve the milk next time because they were pretty runny.

Although it smelled absolutely wonderful while baking, the taste just didn't live up to the smell.  I found it bland and my 5-year old who loves her vegetables barely touched it.

I made this with some of the HOTTEST peppers around (my venezuelan friend grows them in her garden). The heat was so strong my mouth was numb for about 5 minutes after each bite, but it was STILL good enough to finish! (Though I like blazing hot things...)  To make it a tad healthier, I only used about half the cream cheese and butter. Love freshly grown corn from a local farmer so cut that off the cob uncooked (it is so tender you could eat it raw) instead of using the frozen variety. I sauteed some onion and tomato with the red pepper before adding it to the corn to bake.  After it was cooked, I added cilantro to the top. Tried it with a dollop of sour cream as well and it was very good either way.

Used 1/2 and 1/2 green and red bell peppers and 6 jalepenos with seeds.  yummy and very spicy.  would be very good still with less jalepenos.  Made as a side dish for the Chicken Tinga Tostadas on this site.  We actually ended up using this as another topping on the Tostadas.

This was delicious! I am always wanting a side dish with mexican food other than rice and beans and this ( and calabacitas) are my new favorites! I took adivce from a few other reviewers and altered this dish to suit my family's tastes ( we have 2 toddlers, so I can't make anything too spicy) I used most of a small can of green chilis, some diced red bell peppers, onions and garlic to add flavor, and it was so great! I will make this time and time again, and make it super spicy when the kids are not around!

If there were more stars, I'd give them.  This was fabulous.  We only used 4 jalapenos, thinking 8 would be too many, but the recipe is right.  So yummy!  And even more delicious the next day!

Assembled casserole and refrigerated about 3 hours before baking for company.  Followed baking instructions and was perfectly cooked.  I made exactly per the recipe except chickened out and only used 2 jalapenos and added a 4 oz can of chopped green chiles.  Could have used more jalapenos (my fault) and also thought it needed a little salt maybe added to the cream sauce.  A really good dish, thanks for the recipe!

Made this recipe and really liked it.  I cut the butter in half and used some roasted hatch chilies instead of using jalapenos.  It turned out great and people we going back for seconds.

This is wonderful! I have made this at least 5 times so far. I use 1/4 cup butter and no milk. I add in about 4-5 T of a mixture of red & green pepper and onion. Also, I sprinkle some chili powder and cumin into the cream cheese & butter and then stir in about 2 T chopped pickled jalapeno's. You can adjust this recipe to how mild or hot you like it.

Rich is an understatement.  You can actually see the butter floating.  It would be sooo much better without so much butter.  Would be tasty as a dip with chips.

Used green chilis instead of jalapenos. Very rich and creamy with great flavour.  Rave reviews from the Thanksgiving crowd. Reduce the milk if using home frozen corn that is much juicier than commercially frozen corn.

I only used 3 jalapenos because my 6 year old was going to eat this and I didn't want to make it too spicy.  Next time I think I'll use 4 or 4 and 1/2 jalapenos because it was quite mild with just the 3.  This is tasty corn and a good treat when you can afford the added fat and calories to your meal.  (I also used neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese - still really good!)

I thought this was okay.  Didnt have to much flavor other than cream cheese, it seemed a little overwhelming.  I also didnt add all the jalapenos and it was still very spicy, I used 3 jalapenos and 1 serrano pepper.  I also used a orange bell pepper instead of red because it's what I had on hand.  Not sure I will make this again, if I do I will make some changes.  It would be good with some onion and maybe some cilantro mixed in at the end.  Thanks for sharing!

This was FANTASTIC.  I was afraid of the jalapenos so I used the some chopped green peppers instead.  Everyone raved about it.  Said it reminded them of jalapeno poppers.  My husband is wheat-free so he was especially happy.  When I took it out of the oven the butter and cream cheese seemed to have separated and I was concerned, but I stirred it all up and put it on the table.  It almost immediately came to together.  We had a little left over and I had it for lunch.  The flavors were great the next day.

I had this at a party last night but it was served as a dip instead of a side dish.  I think that the person who made it used one and a half packages of cream cheese and only 1/4 cup butter.  It was really good on tortilla chips!

This corn was awsome!! My 6-year-old nephew gave it 10 thumbs up!I doubled the corn, but only added half again as much cream cheese and butter. Also added garlic salt, and pimento instead of red pepper, onlt bc I didn't have any. I mixed it without the jalapenos, and put half in 1 pan, then added jalapenos to the other half and cooked it in a different pan....one for the adults, and 1 for the kids! Everyone LOVED it!!

I made this dish for our Mexican Fiesta this past weekend. I doubled the recipe and this recipe was almost gone before the end of the night. The leftover tasted even more great as the jalapeno taste was able to sit in better.

My family thought this recipe was just okay and not worth the splurge in calories and fat as some treats definitely are. I only used four jalapeños including their seeds and it had just the right amount of heat. However, I will not be making this recipe again.

I was disappointed.  This recipe was really fattening, so I cut out just a bit of butter.  I expected the consistency to be less soupy.  Also, using 8 jalapenos would be ridiculous.  I used one and it was already quite spicy.  I don't know if most used canned or took out the seeds?  I used fresh with the seeds in and one was perfect.  We never finished the dish though, it just wasn't exciting.

This recipe is perfection.  So simple and EVERYONE loved it and asked for the recipe!  I deseeded the jalapeños and used two cans of corn (drained) rather than frozen but other than that left well enough alone.  Definitely a keeper!

"Rich" Mexican Corn is right! With all the butter, cream cheese, and milk, the proportion of dairy completely overpowers the veggies...at least for my palate. This recipe sounded great as written, but was disappointing when made. I ended up turning this into a corn chowder by adding several cups of chicken broth and some bacon crumbles.

I was skeptical about this recipe but since its from Dallas, TX, I figured I would give it a try. I ended up liking it! I halved the recipe but only used 2 jalapenos because my kidlets are not into spicy food...yet. :)

This was good but gets 4 stars because there were too many jalapenos - I would reduce to maybe 6 next time or use some pickled jalapenos.  Also, it was not quite as firm as I would have liked - maybe omit the milk next time.

Hot would not even begin to describe this dish.  I used half of the recommended amount of Jalapeño peppers and it blew the roof off!  Additionally, this dish is extraordinarily rich so a little goes a long way.  Because of the richness of this dish mixed with the extraordinary heat, I would give this side dish three stars.  However; after I blended the entire dish up, it made a fabulous dip for baked pita chips which bumped up the rating to a very deserving four stars.

My gf and I didn't really like this dish.  I added some salt and pepper but it still didn't have much flavor.  It was very greasy and oily.  Mine never browned in the oven and it never thickened up enough even after letting it sit for 10 minutes.  I only used 1 canned jalapeno with seeds because I thought 8 would be too many.

This was really good only next time I will add half the butter. But the flavor was great.

I was looking for a recipe to go with Mexican food I thought this would be really good.  And it was.  But it was really rich.  It only made it once.  And I don't know if I will make it again.  I like my vegetables steamed and I know that is boring .

First Id ever heard of. While prep , I decided to put diced (1 clove Garlic ) instead of powder or garlic salt . Added salt and pep to the butter cream cheese mix while bubbling and 
 chopped celantro. Have not tasted yet but love all ingredients, So just a FOUR for now!

So good! I made two versions and both were a HUGE HIT! I followed the directions for the milder version, adding a smidge more butter and cream cheese to add to the creaminess. The second, I spiced up by using jalapeño cream cheese and added several more extra spicy jalapeños from our garden. It was even better reheated the second day after all of the ingredients melded together overnight! Definitely will be making this again!

I’ve made this dish many times.  It’s always a hit.  While you can tell it is rich and not low in calories, it is worth it every once in a while.   Depending on the crowd I will cut back on the jalapeño or go full force.

I first made this for a family BBQ a year ago. It was eaten as a side and a dip. It’s really great both ways. I had a can of diced jalapeños but I only used a quarter of it. It would have been too spicy for most people had I used the entire can. I had a jar of roasted red peppers so I diced about half a cup of it and threw it in. I used shredded co-jack cheese, all mixed in the casserole. After baking I put more of the cheese on top and returned it to the oven. I removed it after 6 minutes. It was golden brown and bubbly. It turned out perfect. I had no leftovers.

I love the original recipe but also that you can change it according to what cheeses you “have” on hand and not make a huge difference KEY to my life style… anyway I took to a football potluck and noticed people didn’t quite recognize just what to do with this new dish ??? so I put a steamed street taco tortilla on a plate and dished a line of the recipe in the middle and left it in front of the pot with the sauces…LOL and of course had a tortilla keeper filled with steamed small street taco corn tortillas available and the baked warm corn dish!!! DELISH

I make this recipe without the milk or jalapenos, but add cooked, crumbled bacon, a couple sliced green onions, and salt and pepper to taste. It always gets rave reviews!! I will have to try it with the jalapenos. Sounds delicious. :P
Thank you for the recipe!

We don’t do spicy, so I left out the jalapeños and added onion and garlic powder for flavor. It was DELICIOUS!!!! Also- cooked in the crock pot- no air conditioning and didn’t want to heat up the oven! Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent flavor.  Brought it to share and it all disappeared.  Used one jalapeno and four grilled ears of corn, added onion and garlic.  Unfortunately I didn't have cream cheese so sprinkled on some shredded Mexican cheese.  I'm sure cream cheese would have made it even better.  Thank you!

Easy and very good.    I halved the recipe and used one can of corn.  It was enough for four  servings. 
I added half a sweet onion as well.  I made this with Goya Mexican rice and cheese quesadillas for a very easy dinner.  It made the other two boring menu items much less blah.  Keeper for sure.

This was delicious! I only used 3 jalapenos (which was enough) and omitted the red bell pepper (which would have been yummy, but a family member does not like bell peppers). Also, it took longer in the oven than I wanted it to, so I placed it in the microwave for the last 7 minutes. And, could not find 16oz of frozen corn, so I used 24oz. The whole dish was comsumed - no leftovers whatsoever!

I made the recipe as directed except i doubled it and added cooked bacon and colby and cheddar cheese on top for the last 5 min of cooking. I only put the 8 jalapenos though. It came out amazing and was very spicy!! Will make again!!

Good, but slightly bland. I'd add more spices--cumin, salt, and oregano?--and less fatty/oily ingredients. It was a little greasy.

This was very good!  Very rich and creamy just like the name suggests.  I did make a couple additions:  I added 1/2 small red onion, diced  and 1 (4oz) can chopped mild green chiles.  I added less Jalapeños because I knew it would be too spicy for my kids.  I will definitely  make this again!

I will definitely make this again. Next time I will try using the canned green chiles instead of fresh jalapeños. I think it would give it a wonderful mild flavor that will mix well with the creaminess of the corn. I used three jalapeños  that were cleaned well and deseeded and unfortunately they were so spicy that most people couldn't handle much of the dish. It wasn't the recipes fault...just a gamble you take with fresh peppers sometimes. Other than having that new plan, I just added a tiny bit of salt and pepper to taste. It was great!

I need to add this to my list of ideas for potlucks and having company over. DELICIOUS and I even used Neufchatel cream cheese and did not use jalapenos. I also used unsweetened vanilla almond milk and light butter. It was pretty runny this way, so maybe I'll use more corn next time.

I loved this dish.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I made 1 1/2 times the amount since we had a large crowd for dinner.  I did add a little shredded Colby-jack to the top at the last 10 minutes.  Super creamy, cheesy and yummy.  I deveined and seeded the jalapenos since many of my family don't care for super spicy, but I would love it spicier!  Thanks for the great recipe.

I made the recipe to compliment a carry-out Mexican meal. It was wonderful. The recipe makes 8 servings but six of us nearly ate it all. I made no changes to the recipe and will definitely make it again. BTW, when hot out of the oven and still all melted  and gooey it is a fabulous chip dip!

I first found this recipe as a dip to use with tortilla chips and took to a party. Everyone loved it and since others have made it as a side dish. Great either way.

I made this as a side and everyone lived it. But, on my own plate, I tested a small amount with drained and rinsed black beans. It was a great addition that gave the dish a slightly more earthy taste. The black beans were stirred in & the leftovers (only two of us for dinner tonight) will possibly be a main dish or a hearty dip tomorrow. Thank you for a very easy and tasty recipe!

This corn is absolutely delicious!!  Very easy to make, and unbelievably tasty!  I was almost shocked at how flavorful it was, and the depth of flavors that hit your tongue.  Definitely making this as a side ANY time I make tacos... or whenever I just crave it! ;)
* I did add a can of green chilies to the melted butter, milk, and cream cheese mixture to add more flavor.  (I still used the jalepenos though!)

This was delicious! OMG, can't wait to make it again. Made slight modification, I added cotija (mexican cheese) and cayene pepper.  It was amazing and i can't wait to make it again!

Great taste and easy prep.  Took this to a neighborhood gathering and it was well received (empty casserole dish).  I doubled the recipe, though only used 8 fresh jalapeños (w/o seeds) and did not add the red pepper.  I cooked it at least an extra 10 minutes and the consistency was fine - a little thicker than a normal dip.  I also scattered some cheddar on top the last 10 minutes for some curb appeal as it looked a bit pale.  The cheese definitely made it more inviting and got people to try it - and once tasted they came back for more.

The puddle of grease at the bottom did not look appealing at the potluck. Would recommend trying with way less butter.

Verrrry bland - even tho I added sauteed onion and garlic as well as about 1/2 small can of green chilies.  Also very rich, tho I knew that going in, given the title.  But really, that's all there is to this dish - just richness.  Won't repeat it.

I made this but doubled the recipe and added things. I used 4 cans corn, 16 oz. cream cheese, 3/4 cup milk (1/2 c. & added extra 1/4 cup when mixture looked too dry), 3/4 cup butter (again, added extra 1/4 c. when too dry), 1/2 onion (diced), 1 lg. red bell pepper (diced), 5 jalapenos w/seeds from half of them, garlic powder, some salt, 1/2 tsp. hot chili powder. I sauteed the veggies w/out corn in pan and cooked cream cheese, milk, & butter in another pan. Then, I added it all together w/ the corn (drained) and baked in oven. Toward the end, I added shredded sharp cheddar cheese to the top of it. Delicious! It paired awesomely with bbq grilled chicken.

Followed every step but used only 3 jalapeños, great dip. Next time I make it I will double the recipe to 6 jalapenos. My mom asked for the recipe, everyone loved it !

This was a hit at our family dinner tonight!   I doubled the corn, left out the peppers, and added a large can of diced green chilies.  Next time I think I will top it with some crushed tortilla chips. Will definitely make this again... Super easy and quick.

So tasty! I used only half a red pepper though. Also used diced canned jalapenos (used 1/4 of the can) since we don't like it too spicey. But this has become a family favorite! Yum!

My husband is a corn lover so he really enjoyed this.  In my opinion, the corn mixture needed some salt.  I will add it next time.  I used five jalapeno peppers and removed the seeds.  Eight seemed like way too many.  Although this dish was tasty, it just wasn't AS good as I expected it to be.  Also, as another user said, the dish didn't brown at all on top.  I left it in the oven for 45 minutes and the suggested temperature.

Definitely a hit. I make a dish similar to this quite often, but never had added red bell pepper to it before. That really added a nice taste and color to it. I can't take the heat of jalapenos, so I used a can of diced green chilis. Very good. I will be making this again, thank you!

I made a few adjustments to this recipe...I use half the butter, add a little salt, and create a topping. Crushed tortilla chips or crushed corn flakes mixed with a little melted butter (use the other half of the butter) or bread crumbs sprinkled over the top. My friends love this recipe! I can't go to any party w/o taking this along.
