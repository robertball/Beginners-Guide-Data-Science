I agree with others that this is just the very best icing for spice cake, but have you tried it on soft applesauce cookies?  Out of this world!!

Fantastic!!  Thick but spreadable for cakes or cookies, but chill it a bit in the fridge and put it in a piping bag with a star tip and woo hoo!  I did that for my Christmas Cookie exchange on the iced pumpkin cookie recipe from this site (replacing this icing for that one).  I baked the cookies in mini muffin tins instead of on cookie sheets and pressed the center down well right after they came out of the oven to make a nice sized indentation. I piped the icing into the hole and they looked so beautiful.  They were the most popular cookie at the exchange and I received so many compliments on how they looked as well as how they tasted.  And the best part is that piping is actually so much easier as well as faster than a  regular icing method.

This is the kind of icing you would find on a fresh baked maple bar.  It's perfect.  No adjustments needed.  I had regular whipping cream on hand which worked great.  I randomly drizzled it over the top of a pumpkin roll spice cake, then added some toffee chips as a finishing touch.  I'll fess up to admit I left a few tablespoons in the bottom of the pan so I could enjoy dipping my fingers into it for a sweet treat.  This one's a keeper.

Mine was a spreadable consistency without adding the hot water.  Perhaps it was because I sifted my powdered sugar.   The icing has a nice browned butter flavor but the quantity  is small, as someone else noted.  It was enough for a thin layer on a 9x13" cake, but definitely it should be doubled for a layer cake.  I used it on a pecan cake since I liked the idea of butter pecan, and it complimented it well.

I admit, I haven't tried this one yet, but this was exactly the kind of frosting I have been looking for.  I am going to make my pumpkin bars which I used to use a plane buttercream frosting, but this looks perfect.  I almost gave up because all I could find was recipes with cream cheese.  Call me odd, but I have never liked any kind of cream cheese frosting.  Love cream cheese and even in desserts but frosting?  No thank you.  Finally!  This looks perfect....how can you go wrong? UPDATE: Used this as well for my fresh apple cake recipe and it was perfect! So AWESOME!

Great recipe that I will definitely make again. I needed this to drizzle over a bundt cake and it worked perfectly. I browned the butter in the microwave, used fat free milk, and needed only 1 T. hot water to make a drizzling consistency.  I am thinking that cream would make a difference in the consistency? Anyway, it was perfect for my needs and thank you for the recipe!

This frosting is perfect atop of scones. I have made pumpkin, apple cinnamon and chai all with this same frosting. It is absolutely a crowd favorite.

I made this for a banana cake and it was very good.  I tried it and loved it but thought that a little cream cheese would be awesome with the banana, so I threw in about 3 ounces.  I whipped it until it was light.  Oh. so. good!

Excellent!! I am pairing it with a Spice Bread Recipe. I did not have any heavy cream so I just added 2% milk and it came out great. I also added a little bit of nutmeg and cinnamon. Delicious!! and super easy!!

I made this to go on some pumpkin cupcakes I made.  Per the submitter's note, I added a little more powdered sugar to make my icing thicker.  I also tried the leftover icing on french toast and it was very tasty.
