this recipe was not a keeper for us.  The cake part was kind of dry and we just didn't care for the flavor of the cream sauce even though we like coffee.  Maybe someone else will have better luck with the recipe.

I thought this was a pretty decent, if standard, dense torte-like cake.  Very rich flavor, and although mine came out a bit dry, I blame myself for overbaking.  I didn't try the sauce, but instead served it with ice cream, which helped mediate the richness.  The cake was also pretty easy to make, which was a plus.

This cake was pretty easy to make.  The batter is very thick and made a dense cake.  It wasn't as moist as I thought it would be and the coffee cream sauce wasn't as yummy as it sounded and too thin to compliment the cake.  Overall the cake was easy and tasted great.  Next time I'll omit the sauce.
