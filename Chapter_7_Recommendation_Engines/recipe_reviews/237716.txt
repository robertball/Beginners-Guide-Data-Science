I wanted this for my lunch and really liked it. As the submitter suggested, this is a perfect recipe for customizing with whatever you happen to have. Since I didn't have pickled peppers, I subbed dill pickles. I also felt that the amount of garlic called for would be too much, so I just sprinkled and tasted until I liked the flavor. While I ate this for lunch, I can really see it on an appetizer tray as well.

Even my husband who hates wraps loved it. I substituted cream cheese with Boursin cheese added only spinach, pickled peppers and cheddar cheese according to recipe, it was delicious!
Thanks

I love this! The only change I made was reducing recipe for 2 servings which I ate by myself(oops my bad). Thanks for a great recipe.

Made these as one of the Appetizers for our small new years party!  It was just great..  I did have to make a couple small substitutions (Different chiles. I used Chipolte ) and different cheese, I used Manchego, to make do with what I had on hand,  but it was great!  and I am sure it will be better when I try it again!

made it a second time, but used banana peppers instead of pickled peppers. I also added a little mild salsa to the mix.  Tasted much better!

This was really simple and tasty!  I was craving spinach and cream cheese, but didn't know what to make, and I came across this recipe.  I inadvertently added salt, so it was a tad too salty.  Other than that, it was great.  You can use whatever you have on hand.  I think next time I will add red peppers for a little crunch and extra flavor.
