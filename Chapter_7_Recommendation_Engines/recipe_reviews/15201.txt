I thought this was pretty good, but the rest of my family was not crazy about it.  Probably won't be making again.

Made just the lamb filling (steps 4 and 5), without the curry but with a pinch of mint. Served with spaghetti and brown butter. Delicious!

I had high hopes for this recipe, but I'm sorry I can't recommend it.  One disclaimer:  I had to stop halfway through, and resume cooking the next day as I did not have many of the ingredients that I thought I did.  Instead of scones, I used refrigerated biscuits for the topping, and they were really good with the Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top.  But the lamb filling was lacking something, and tasted very gamey.  Also, after baking, it turned out very greasy.  Both of these are possibly due to the quality of the ground lamb.  Even so, I would probably not make this again, as much of it seemed off.  I'd sooner make a standard shepherd's pie, maybe with that biscuit topping.

My review ifs for the topping and presentation only.  I will edit the review when I make the stew.  That said, I loved the scone the parmesan gives a slightly sharp flavor.  I think I may add an herb next time, maybe some marjoram or basil.  This really helps stretch a skimpy serving.  Thank you.

My wife and I tried this recipe last night, and there seems to be something wrong with the scone topping directions.  Since it's just she and I, we cut the recipe in half.  After adding the specified amount of butter, the mixture was not even close to crumbly.  We added what amounted to an additional 2-3 tablespoons to get the mixture right.  Also, my wife needed to add extra milk because the dough was just too dry.  When it came time for us to cut the dough, there was no way we could make the amount of scones specified with a thickness of 1 inch.  We had to roll out the dough about 1/4 inch thick to make six or seven 4 inch circles.  (Remember, we cut everything in half.)  In the end, the meal was tasty, but left us questioning the recipe.

The kids really enjoyed this but the measurements on the recipe for the cobbler wasn't accurate as I needed a lot more milk. Tasted good and liked that it was a one pot meal

Made this tonight. It was delicious. To cut the fat, I dry fried the lamb, then added the onion, cooking a few minutes to soften, then poured off the fat before adding the garlic and other ingredients. I added the peas frozen. (We get them in bags in the UK and the peas have been frozen individually, so they pour.) Like other reviewers, I couldn't get the number of scones at the stated thickness and needed to add a little more milk to make the dough workable. Fewer scones meant bigger gaps, but there were still enough to go round. I also substituted cheddar cheese, because my husband doesn't like Parmesan. We really enjoyed this as a nice alternative to Shepherds Pie. Will make again.
