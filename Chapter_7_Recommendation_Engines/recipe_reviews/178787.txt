I made these for a group of friends last night and every one loved them.  The key is to make sure they are bite sized - you must put the whole piece in your mouth or you'll make a mess!  I spread 1/3 cup of mozzerella on each side, instead of the 1/4c that the recipe called for just to make the bites a bit sturdier.  I spread the mozzerella around the phyllo dough, kind of like a barrier, to help keep the chowder from seeping out.  Will definitely use again and may tweak for other flavors.
