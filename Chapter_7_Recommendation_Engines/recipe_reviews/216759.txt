I made the recipe exactly as stated. It came out perfect. For me, it covered 12 rolls, not 24. I did use buttermilk in the icing only because I had a touch left that I had to use. This was just what I needed--thanks Cara! NOTE: This recipe does not say to sift the powdered/confectioners sugar. I really didn't mess with that but I did run a wisk through it to break down the bigger lumps in the sugar. It just makes for a smoother icing. For those like me who forget to let the cream cheese sit out before using, I let the cream cheese sit in a small bowl on my heating pad (the same one I used to help my rolls rise) on low/medium for 20 minutes or so to soften it up.

This is my recipe - just a note, it will cover 24 tiny rolls or 12 large (like the ones frome the mall).  I guess that got left out of the description!  Thanks for all who try this - it took a lot of trial and error before I came up with this one.  My family loves it and I hope your's will too!

Wonderful cinnamon roll icing! It's easy to make and so good you could eat it all by itself. I used a 3 oz. pkg. of cream cheese and decreased the amount of butter a bit. Since I only had skim milk on hand I opted to my husband's half and half. Definitely make sure your butter and cream cheese are softened. I gradually put everything into my kitchen aid mixer and gave it a whirl. This came out so smooth and creamy -perfect for Sunday morning cinnamon rolls. These frost about 12 large rolls, but then again I LOVE icing! Thanks for a great recipe, Cara M.!

This one's a plate licker!!!  It is absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe, except that I left out the milk and salt. It made the icing a little thicker, which we like. That allowed the icing to melt into the cinnamon rolls.  I will never fix cinnamon rolls again without using this icing! Thanks for sharing the recipe, Cara!

I like icicing which is fluffy and less thin.  This icinig is not creamy but almost the consistency of gloss.  I would decrease the liquid next time and also use a little less butter.

Super good!I've always used a recipe that used more cream cheese and figured I'd like it better that way. Tonight I didn't have enough cream cheese left for my regular recipe so I tried this one. I am pleasantly surprised and I now have a new regular recipe. Thanks so much!

My wife made this for some homemade cinnamon buns and it was the best icing I've ever had!  I brought them into work and you'd have thought people were starving.  She has a homemade roll recipe that uses potato flakes.  Look for one online like that and top with this icing!

The name says it all!  Personally, I prefer the ratio of 3 oz. cheese to 6 tbsp. butter but that's just because I like the cream cheese tang to be a little more pronounced.  However, as written, it is still the perfect compliment to cinnamon rolls.

Amazing....easy and tasty!  We used to top some gluten free cinnamon rolls....yummy!  In response to the person who complained about the consistency....this IS thinner than cake frosting, but absolutely perfect for cinnamon rolls.

I made a coffee cake for a dessert auction and normally use a standard drizzle icing, but wanted something better.  Found this recipe and will NEVER use anything else.  Thus is OMG good.  I do think for the coffee cake I will make it a little thinner next time.  Thank you for submitting this recipe!

The recipe calls for so much butter, it came out with a buttery  flavor, and not too much of a cream cheese taste.  I'd recommend reducing the butter by quite a bit, and upping the cream cheese AND sugar.  

Also, started by melting the ingredients on the stove, and it came out nicely, and thin enough to drizzle.

This icing was absolutely delicious and very, very simple to make.  It was the perfect combination of flavors and not overly sweet like some recipes.  Please make sure your butter and cream cheese are at room temperature. To have more control of the icing consistency, add the vanilla, then slowly add the milk until it gets to your desired level of thickness.  Absolutely amazing recipes!!!

Extremely easy, and yet so perfect.  Really, to me, the perfect amount of cream cheese for flavor and consistency, but not too much to make you think you are using a cream cheese icing, which I don't really want on my roll.

I made a pumpkin cake today and just couldn't find what I was looking for to top it--this seemed just perfect...and it was!  I used heavy whipping cream instead of milk to really fluff it up.  I added a picture so you can take a look!

I made some homemade cinnamon bread and wanted a spread that we could spread on it. So, I made this icing and served it on the side. I did make a couple small changes; instead of the milk I used pure maple syrup and I doubled the amount of vanilla extract. It was simply delicious.

This is the perfect icing! I have used just confectioner's sugar and milk with a little butter and vanilla for years and it ALWAYS comes out too runny or too sweet. I stumbled upon this while looking for something to top my cinnamon rolls and this was absolutely perfect. I will never use another recipe again! Note: I didn't use salt and it was still awesome.

I normally hate when people review it and then have a bunch of changes and then rate it since then its not the original recipe, but I made slight changes to this recipe to better fit my taste. 
The basic recipe is awesome by itself! Creamy and tastes great! My tweaks I made were just to add about one more tablespoon of butter and a little less vanilla. I also added just a little bit of lemon extract (about half of the cap full) and it made it even more delicious! I will definitely use this recipe again and again!

I tried this recipe for the first time. I omitted the salt because my butter already had salt in it. It was heavenly divine. I recommend this icing for anyone looking to make cinnamon rolls taste like Rhodes cinnamon rolls or better.

This is fluffy and rich and it tastes great! I will use it on cake and other desserts too!
I changed it to 3 ounces of cream cheese instead of 2.

This is classic Cinnabon style frosting. It makes a bit more than you *really* need for 12 buns, so if you, like me, prefer a heavily frosted bun, there's no need to double the recipe.

It also chills and freezes well if you like to make things ahead of time.

This is a perfect glaze. I grabbed the sea salt because was handy and I love a bit of salt in my sweets, and it is glorious. Tiny pockets of sea salt flowing through the glaze. I'll be using sea salt in all my frostings from now on.

I thought this was a really good recipe, with exception of too much butter.  It may have been because I use high grade Irish butter and not a grocery store brand. I made it twice, and the second time I put 1/2 the butter, and 3 ounces of cream cheese. It was still plenty sweet enough.  For 1/2 of the recipe, I added orange extract instead of vanilla, and that was also exceptionally good.

Very yummy!  The only thing I didn't do was add the salt because I used salted butter and wasn't sure if that would be too much.  It went perfectly with the cinnamon rolls!

I made the "90 minute cinnamon rolls" recipe and made this icing for the first time today .
It's FANTASTIC ! It's not too sweet , not overpowered with a cream cheese taste either .It's 
Perfectly balanced . I will use this for all of my sweet pastries that require a glaze or icing.
Great recipe Cara !

I had a bunch of company up and made home-made cinnamon rolls but didn't have a good recipe for the frosting. I had all the ingredience on hand and made this frosting and I think it complemented my rolls. Everyone loved them. It covered 16 rolls and I probably could have covered up to 20. There was more than enough. Thank you- great recipe!

This is a really good recipe! Since I only had a small dish of rolls (about 9 medium sized ones) I cut the recipe in half and it worked great and I loved it because it was not so overly sweet, like you sometimes get at places and you have the feeling that your teeth will rot away while you eat it. I think at the next try I will decrease the amount of butter just by a little.

This is SO YUMMY!!! I like cream cheese icing but the cream cheese part is usually so overpowering. This is the perfect combo. It was so light and fluffy my coworkers couldn't believe there wasn't any cool whip in it.

This is the absolute perfect combination to make perfect icing!  I first thought to myself, really, how great can a frosting recipe be?  5 stars?  I have made it a thousand times & can it really be better?  Yes, it can!  Use the exact measurements & you will get perfect frosting!

This is by far the best cream cheese frosting I have ever had. In fact, I like it so much that I thicken it with more confectioner's sugar and use it on cupcakes. I hate buttercream so it's always good to find other icings that work, and I don't really care for too much sweet stuff but I can eat this icing by the spoonful.

Yum! I only had 2 cinnamon rolls, so I reduced the recipe down and didn’t make any substitutions. I will definitely be making this icing from now on!

Properly named! Perfect icing first try, and I even made a half batch! Made it to go on top of GF Cinnamon Rolls from a mix. Great taste! My family wants to spread the leftovers on cookies and crackers. Thanks!

I would give this 1/2 if I could.  The ratio of butter to cream cheese is backwards. This should be labeled butter cream frosting.  IT IS LIKE SPREADING BUTTER ON YOUR ROLLS!  

I found a recipe that is 4 oz cream cheese and 1/4 cup butter, 1 1/2 tsp milk, 1/2 tsp vanilla, and 1 1/2 cup confectioners sugar.  Super fantastic.

Yes, it’s a little bit of work. I didn’t quite understand how rolling it out you should be. I added a little bit of not Meg to my sugar and cinnamon mixture .

I love this recipe!  I cut the recipe in half for some mini cinnamon rolls I made for my Christmas work party.  It's so creamy, and the cream cheese adds some nice flavor.  I also think it cut some of the sweetness of the confectioner's sugar.  I will definitely make again!

I doubled the cream cheese as we prefer a more cream cheese flavoured frosting.  As written you couldn't really tell there was even cream cheese in it.

I used heavy cream instead of milk. Added a bit more vanilla extract. I had accidentally bought crescent rolls and family requested cinnamon rolls. I baked the rolls, but instead of twisting them into crescents, I left them flat so we could use the cream cheese icing. The rolls were a HUGE hit with the family! Every single roll was eaten! We had plenty of icing left over. I’m figuring out now how to use it and not waste that deliciousness!  Very easy to make. I would have added more powdered sugar if I felt the icing was too thin, but it wasn’t. It came out perfectly. Easy to spread on the roll. Will melt some on hot rolls, but so will commercial icing. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks you for providing this easy and delicious recipe.

I followed this recipe exact, & it tastes overwhelmingly too buttery. I did the taste test & it tasted like I'm eating fluffy butter. Adding more of the other ingredients did not help unfortunately. Definitely cut back on the butter A LOT by at least 4 tablespoons. I doubt one needs 7 tablespoons. I've had a better recipe but lost it & came to this one since thinking it would be just as great since I saw it was advertised as mostly "5 stars" with hundreds of reviews. Boy was I wrong. I'll continue to search for the long lost recipe that was better than this.I will say that the texture is lovely/perfect. The taste is horrendous unless you like eating fluffy butter by itself

I was making cinnamon rolls and realized that I didn’t have enough icing because someone had been licking the icing jar. So I clicked the first recipe I could find and this was even better than the jar that comes with the rolls. I used water instead of milk and it worked just as well.

Fantastic recipe! I have used this three times now and failed once. Make sure you soften the butter not melt the butter or it will be a disaster. The flavor and consistency are perfect and it is now my go to recipe.  Thank you for sharing!

made it as per the recipe.  I think it's one of the best.  Lighter than a cream cheese frosting but with just a touch of the cream cheese in the taste.   Super tasty!

Delicious! I had Neufchâtel cheese so I subbed that, as well as Crisco instead of butter. Delicious!

I love this recipe. By mistake, I used heavy whipping cream in place of the milk and omg, it’s amazing! A very nice frosting that isn’t thin or runny. This is my go to recipe from now on. Thanks for sharing!

This was even better than I hoped. Had a group of kids over, and they said it was better than grandma's. I won't tell, but you should try it.

Turned out wonderful! I doubled it so there was plenty to cover 24 rolls. I have learned always use 8oz of cream cheese with 8 tablespoons of butter.

Very good! Like others, I used 3 T cream cheese and 6 T butter; reduced milk to 1 T and increased vanilla to 1 t.

Love, love, love! I like frosting to be on the thicker side - very easy to spread but not runny at all - so I used half the milk and half the salt.  Cannot rave enough!

More of a 4.5/5 than a 5/5. I only added 4-5 tablespoons of butter and instead added 3 ounces of cream cheese. Delicious!

Started making this icing and thought it looked gross and ALMOST threw it away to go with a different recipe. So glad I stuck it through. This is by far the best icing I've ever tasted.

I followed this recipe exactly and it tasted overwhelmingly like butter to me. It needed way more cream cheese and sugar to make it taste like...not just butter? I will not be making this recipe again.

This is so delicious.  I did leave out the salt, but followed everything else exactly.  Nice thick texture and not the overwhelming cream cheese taste.  This will be my go to for my cinnamon rolls going forward.  Yum Yum!

While I didn't have cinnamon rolls to throw this icing on, I did put it on a nice big pan of pumpkin bread! It was perfect. The cream cheese didn't overpower the icing or the bread. I will definitely use this again - wouldn't change a thing!

Dear Cara (my Queen),
First of all let me thank you for providing such a simple yet decadent resolution to my cinnamon cake dilemma. It’s nearly 10:30 here and my brother and I have decided to create a cinnamon bun... but better. Think of a hypnotizing spiral made completely of cinnamon buns. But as my brother and I began rolling out each prepackaged roll we soon began to realize that the small packet of icing included would no longer fulfill our needs for the sheer amount of bun. Given that your recipe was the first hit on google and our large bun only had 10:32 left to cook, our lives we’re destined to cross. My dearest Cara, we could not be more satisfied with the outcome of our monster bun, topped with your succulent white sauce, your sweet, sweet wet goo. 

We will probably both wake up with diabetes, but thanks to you it will be worth it all.

This is delicious on cinnamon rolls, I followed other reviews and didn’t use as much butter. This makes a nice frosting on rolls. I was going for a drizzle so I thinned mine down. I think this would be good on cupcakes too! I am keeping this recipe!

This rivals the Cinnabon icing! I sometimes add a tablespoon of cinnamon to it when topping a coffee cake For a bit more flavor. This recipe holds up well for about a week in the fridge.

I added 1 additional oz of Cream Cheese & followed the recipe.
No problems with the ingredients or recipes and the tips for softening the butter & cream cheese worked perfectly.

Easy and delicious! Some of the reviews say it wasn’t enough frosting but it was plenty of frosting for 12 large cinnamon rolls, maybe even too much.  I did sift the powder sugar ahead of time and I think that helped make it smooth.

Okay, it really IS that good ;)  I made some cinnamon bread and everyone asked for icing - this is PERFECT!  Whipped it up in the KitchenAid in no time.  This recipe is a keeper!

Perfect Cinnamon Roll Icing.. It was GLOSSY (as it is supposed to be it is not cake icing after all, duh people) Flavor is phenomenal.. Who wants fluffy icing on a Cinnamon roll.. It is a glaze. If you do like a thicker icing add more powdered sugar.

Made this frosting to go on my cinnamon rolls this morning and it is the best! Make sure cheese and butter are cool yet soft. When blending I thought it was going to be runny but keep blending and add sugar slowly it thickens up and looks great.

I, too, made the recipe exactly as outlined.  Seriously, it was so light and fluffy.  This will be my go-to cinnamon roll icing.  I was able to frost 27 small rolls, and even had a little leftover.  All of the leftover went to "waist" -- mine!   :)  Great recipe!  Thanks.

This is good but not cream-cheesy enough.  I tried it then after tasting and looking at other recopes, doubled the cream cheese to 4 ounces.  This improved the taste and the consistency for me.   Maybe that's just a preference thing though.  Overall, it's good and I would use it again with that same adjustment.

When you make a recipe, you have to always be aware that certain things can affect the outcome. No two people measure ingredients the same way, and those ingredients can vary in moisture content and require slight alterations on any given day. 

This is a great recipe, just be measure with care and adjust the liquid to achieve the consistency you're looking for.

I followed others' suggestions and increased the amount of cream cheese to 3 oz and decreased butter to 6 tbsp. In addition, I omitted the vanilla and only added about 1 tbsp of milk to thin it out and make it easier to spread. These modifications helped me achieve great results, imo.

This was delicious! However I added another two teaspoons of milk and 1 additional cup of confectioners sugar to the second batch to make it go further. Nonetheless, the recipe is perfect without any changes.

Great recipe,  but I prefer a strong cream cheese flavour so I always add more cream cheese ( usually 5-8 oz) and then a bit more milk to bring it to the proper consistency.

This made my cinnamon rolls perfect.  The icing was light and fluffy and not overly sweet.  (I used it on the Jiffy Cinnamon Rolls found on this site.)

This frosting was delicious. I did as others suggested and did 3oz cream cheese and 6Tbsp butter. Was not over powering by either. Will use this recipe from on for my gluten free Cinnamon Rolls

Who needs the cinnamon rolls when you can just have this??? It is so good! I licked the beaters. I licked the bowl and spoon. (When I was all done laying it down thick on some gooey cinnamon rolls, of course ??)

I'm not sure why people said it was runny... I thought it was the perfect consistency for cinnamon rolls. It would not be thick enough to ice a cake. I did make a double batch because I made 40 rolls. There was plenty of icing. I really think the dash of salt makes this recipe, perfect balance for the sweet of the roll

Perfect frosting!  I do NOT like cream cheese at all, but this has just a hint of the cream cheese tang, that went well with our cinnamon rolls.  I did use just a little less milk so it was slightly thicker.

I made this recipe exactly as it is written. Excellent consistency and sweet, but light flavor. It melted beautifully on homemade cinnamon rolls hot from the oven and did not harden as it cooled. All the rolls were gobbled up Christmas morning. This recipe is a keeper for when I need a good icing for various sweet breads/rolls.

I was able to cover approximately 40 3-4" rolls. It was lightly applied not doused in frosting so it really went quite far.

Really great and taste recipe. I would definitely be saving this recipe. I personally prefer less butter, so instead of using the 7 tablespoons, I used 2 tablespoons, and I totally omitted the salt. It came out great; really smooth and creamy. Im always looking for a way to make things with a little  less calories and lower sodium; it was healthier for my family and I didn't have to sacrifice taste! Next time, I will add a little bit of lemon juice to amp up the flavor. Thank you!

This was such a great recipe for icing on your cinnamon roll recipe. I added one more oz. of cream cheese and one Tbs. less of butter, perfection! 
It was just right for the balance of flavor I was looking for, not too much butter and definitely not too much cream cheese, which I think can over power. I was actually surprised how amazing it tasted. I did add an above standard vanilla extract to it, I'm not sure if this made a difference, but I sure did like it.

So good, I used it on pumpkin bread as more of a glaze. Very easy to adjust if you want to go thicker or thinner, I add more milk or less. Delicious!

I did use butter flavor extract instead of vanilla extract.  It was superb!  This is great for kids to dunk fruits in too.   Note: even though you may be tempted to add more milk when creaming, don't - add a smidgen at end if you need, 'cause a tsp. of milk really makes a big difference, and hot cinnamon rolls just make this frosting melt anyway.

This icing is delicious...I needed to cover 2 pans if cinnamon rolls  so I added 4 oz. total of cream cheese and just a bit more vanilla but left measurements for the milk the same so it would be a little thicker and also cut the butter in half because its rich enough and really doesn't need that much butter. I will make again for any baked goods that needs an icing or glaze

I work at a pizza place in a small town and I always told my boss I loved cinnamon rolls. Today I asked if I could make a cinnamon roll dessert pizza. I used this icing recipe and it was perfect. Then my boss told me if I found a good name for it I could put it on our menu. Thank you for the recipe.

Good, I used it for 12 cinnamon rolls as well, it was a little over the top but it worked well for my cinnamon rolls since they were more crispy. Great recipe! I would add a spritz of lemon juice (to resemble cinnabon's recipe for their icing).

Lovely icing,  wonderful recipe! I used this icing to drizzle over desert pizzas I was experimenting with and it worked perfectly. The amount of cream cheese is just perfect as it gives that extra richness and creaminess while still allowing the buttery flavor to shine through as well. It paired perfectly with the strawberry and cream cheese pizza and I forsee using this recipe to top many other baked goods. My entire family loved this icing, it's definitely a keeper. Thank you for a great recipe!

This was perfect!! I used it this morning to top the 90-Minute Cinnamon rolls from this site (really really good and easy). I only needed 1T of milk. I has more than enough for my 12 standard sizes rolls. Everyone loves it.

Excellent! I tweeted it a bit by only using 1 tsp. Of half and half and only a pinch of salt. This gave it more of a frosting consistency.  Reminds me of Dong Phone King Cake frosting.

This was a very good recipe that I would definitely use again...I would suggest adding something to make it a little bit thicker because it is a very thin icing.

The PERFECT icing for cinnamon rolls!  The cream cheese is just enough for great flavor without being overpowering. Delicious.

This is a wonderful icing. Used a little less butter only because I had 1 less tablespoon and so a little less powdered sugar to keep proportions correct. It came out great and frosted some cinnamon bread I made earlier today. Will make again.

If you are wondering if should keep searching for "the right" recipe...STOP! THIS IS THE ONE! 
Followed recipe as is and it turned out awesome. My husband didn't like the first glaze I made (too sweet), but  he loves this one.
Thanks allrecipes

This is perfect cinamon roll icing. I love the cream cheese flavor, but it isn't too rich. My only advice is to not spread icing until you are ready to serve the rolls right after. This isn't an icing that is thick and will stay thick while sitting on the counter. You want the icing to stay in the fridge until you need it because it will seperate a little and melt.

This was INCREDIBLE. Like no lie. It really transformed my rolls. The dough/roll by itself was really good but the frosting with the original recipe was too heavy on the cream cheese so it made the rolls taste funny. This was PERFECT. SO PERFECT. I made 16 relatively small rolls and it covered them perfectly with a little extra for me to snack on which is always a plus (:

This was the first time making this recipe for the icing, it was very good, I'm not a big salt person so I could tell the salt in the recipe even though I used what was on the recipe and I could taste the salt, so next time I will use 1/8 tsp and not the 1/4 tsp. Other than that, it went very well with my home made cinnamon rolls. Thanks for the yummy icing recipe.

This recipe is the best tasting one I've tried!! So yummy and just the right consistency.  I warmed the cream cheese before using it.  I also used whole unhomogonized organic milk I had for our toddler and that extra creamy milk made it a beautiful consistency. Soooo good!!

I made this as stated and its way too buttery for my taste. I prefer a sweeter icing and all I could taste was the butter which overpowered the cinnamon rolls. I will make it again, however I will increase the cream cheese and decrease the butter in half and probably add more powdered sugar and a tad more milk if needed. A very good recipe to start with.

This really is the perfect cinnamon roll icing!  This recipe has the perfect hint of cream cheese flavor, just enough richness from the butter, and just sweet enough.  Just a note, if you use salted butter you may want to omit the additional salt.

I just made this and it is Very good. It is just a little to buttery. Next time i'll use maybe 3/4 of a stick of butter instead of the whole thing.

Outstanding!  I paired this icing with the Pioneer Woman's cinnamon roll recipe. Sooooo good!  The perfect amount of sweetness (not too sweet, like most icings)...the cream cheese tang balances out the flavor perfectly. This will be my go-to recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

This was WONDERFUL! It came out fluffy with just a hint of cream cheese flavor, not overpowering for the cinnamon rolls. Even as it melted over the rolls, it stayed fluffy. I think that the person who said it was too runny must have melted the butter and/or the cream cheese, or they are confusing frosting (for a cake or cupcakes) with icing for cinnamon rolls. This was perfect!

I make this with GOOFYDEBBIE's "Ninety Minute Cinnamon Rolls." I've made this as is many times, but recently I used fat free milk and reduced fat cream (neufchatel) cheese and had no problems. I also use 50% more cream cheese to balance out the sweetness.

Just tried this icing recipe for the first time this morning and it is wonderful! The only minor change I made was to add a bit more vanilla because we like a heavy vanilla flavor. This whipped up so nice and creamy, light but thick at the same time. I used my Kitchen Aid mixer and made sure my butter and cream cheese were softened but not at all melted. (If your butter is melted at all you will get a thinner consistency of icing)  I let the mixer beat on power 6  for a few minutes and the icing came out just perfect. Used it to frost a 13x9 pan of cinnamon rolls that I made using 1/3 of the dough from Grandma VanDoren's white bread recipe with filling made from Clone of a Cinnabon recipe (both on this site)  Delicious!! Thanks for the great recipe!

I made some changes, due to the lack of ingredients. Instead of cream cheese I used vanilla yogurt. And instead of butter I used crisco. I was actually shocked at how well it turned out!

Your recipe was JUST PERFECT CARA! My wife made a new cake called Cinnamon Roll Swirl Cake. We were both tired of the usual glaze with the too sweet & tasteless powdered sugar. This is Easter & this recipe made the day. Did not change one thing! Again Thanks Cara.

Thank you for such a good icing recipe that easy to whip together!  I have battled finding the perfect recipe and tried several and after trying this one I promise I will not look any further this was definitely the best icing I have made for cinnamon rolls!!!!  I've learned I have to add my milk after the powdered sugar bc too many icing recipes have come out too runny for my liking but I think I used 1.5 Tbsp of milk.  But regardless such a good taste

Delicious, used fat free half and half and vanilla bean paste.  Used the icing to enhance frozen cinnamon rolls.  Big hit with the family.

This is a very good icing.  I decreased the butter by half and it still turned out great.  I just thought that amount of butter was over kill.

Cara, Thanks for posting this! My husband made cinnamon rolls & my son said the last time, the icing had too much of a cream cheese taste. (just like you had said!) Indeed, THIS one is perfect! Yum! Perfect for a snow day! -Maryellen

This recipe was perfect!  I am making three batches of cinnamon rolls to see which my grandson likes the set, but used this icing on them all.  Not too cream cheesy!  I did use heavy whipping cream, because I had it, and used a little more to get it a tad thinner.

Perfect!  I followed exactly and left in my stand mixer to whip for several minutes while my family was opening Christmas presents.  The batch was just perfect for about 16-18 rolls, or a 13x9x2 pan of rolls.

I used heavy whipping cream instead of milk. I am pretty sure I have died and gone to heaven :) Only thing I will do different next time to suit my own taste is add a little less sugar.

Very good. I am going to use the whole 8oz package next time. I would've liked it thicker but I'm glad I had let the cinnamon rolls cool down a bit. The cinnamon rolls were very good also. Cinnamon roll 2. I think I did good for the first time making cinnamon rolls with icing. Thanks for the recipe.

Oh my goodness! Like other reviewers have said, the recipe title is completely appropriate.  I made strawberry rolls today (like cinnamon rolls, but with strawberries), but I am always unhappy with the cream cheese icing that is included in that recipe.  I found this... and I must say, I now have a perfect match.  My only problem was I thought I had 12 large rolls, but they must be medium-sized (3-4 inches across).  I had a little too much icing, so I will do 3/4 of the recipe next time.

This was excellent!  I only had whipped cream cheese and by mistake I totally melted the butter and it still came out heavenly!  The only problem with this recipe is that I can't stop eating it!

This really is the perfect cinnamon roll icing! Tastes just like cinnabon! Its not too heavy, sweet or thick and it melts into glaze when you put it on the rolls! Absolutely perfect!

The perfect amount of cream cheese, not overpowering at all.

Thank You for the wonderful recipe! I didn't have any cream cheese so was going to make just powered sugar frosting then ran across a package of Laughing Cow cinnamon cream cheese spread I had bought to try on my bagel. So used 2 of the wedges in place of the 2 oz. of cream cheese. All I can say is YUMMY!! Have now found my new cinnamon roll frosting. I had a hard time not just getting a spoon and eating just the frosting!

This was awesome! My husband is not a big fan of icing and he really liked this as well. He said it wasn't overly sweet like a lot of icings are. Based on some of the reviews I read saying the icing was too thin for them I only added 1 TBS of milk instead of the 2 that it called for. I think it came out perfect and was just wonderful!

Oh my word!!!  This is the best icing ever!!  Love how it has a hint of cream cheese but not too much.  This is my go-to recipe for cinnamon rolls.  I could just eat it straight out of the bowl!!

Very good! The only thing I had changed was that I used strawberry cream cheese (didn't have plain).

I love this simple recipe...my kids are lactose intolerant so I substituted the cream cheese with Tofutti cream cheese and used lactose free milk.  I halved the recipe since I used it to frost the gingerbread cookies I made, which only makes about 16 cookies. (recipe on allrecipes...the roll out ones).  Tasted delicious and so easy to make.
