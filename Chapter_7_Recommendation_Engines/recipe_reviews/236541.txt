We really liked it. The white sauce was a bit difficult, I recommend you mix the flour, salt and pepper together before putting it in the butter and I did end up adding an additional tbsp of flour to thicken it. But it turned out really good. I had a block of Coby Jack cheese that I shredded to used with shredded mozzarella  instead of the mexican cheese mix.  I think that helped keep the Lasagna together.  All my past lasagnas just fell apart on the plate, but this was easy to cut into even pieces and stayed together on the plate.  I didn't have any problem with it being too liquidy like someone else said.  You have to be careful to drain the meat really well, and not over cook the spaghetti sauce because it can get soupy and since it's going in the oven for 55 minutes, it doesn't need to be pre-cooked.  I thought it was going to be too much sauce but it was perfect.  I didn't add any other ingredients.  Overall, we enjoyed it and I'll definitely use this recipe again.

I was glad to find a recipe without ricotta cheese.  I did not find the recipe any easier to prepare than any other lasagna recipe, and it did take me a lot longer than 20 minutes. Also I couldn't get the white sauce to thicken up, even after 30 minutes!  Finally I added a third Tbsp of flour and it thickened.  The final lasagna looked okay before cutting, but it was incredibly soupy.  I had added some cooked and drained vegetables to the red sauce so that may have somewhat increased the liquidness, but it was really just lasagna noodles floating in liquid sauce on one's plate.  I think there is too much pasta sauce in the recipe as written.  The recipe calls for 2 (28 ounce) jars of sauce, so  i added 2 24 ounce jars of sauce.  But perhaps the person meant 2 jars of sauce TOTALLING 28 ounces.

the recipe is good, I would never have used a Mexican cheese blend. My white sauce didnâ€™t thicken but everything turned out fine. I cut this in half and it filled my 9x13 and 8 servings.

Perfect quick and easy. I did everything exactly as recipe state. It set up fine! I let it rest for about1/2 hour as we were chatting. I used 2 jars of Ragu and I added water around the edges. It was great!

I liked this recipe.  I added mushroom & onions cause my family loves them and used well drained hot sausage with lots of Italian seasonings.  Since no ricotta, I put  cream cheese on eat noodle.  Family loved it.
