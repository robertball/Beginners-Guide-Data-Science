This turned out great!  I used regular orange cake mix instead of white mixed with gelatin.  I had absolutely NO problem with it staying in the pan - and my pan was a 9x5(I even measured).  Just in case, I placed a cookie sheet on the rack underneath.  By the way...that's a good thing to do when trying a new recipe.  That way if it does spill over, you just have the cookie sheet to clean.  I ended up letting it bake for a few extra minutes(I was feeding a baby), but it still was fine.  I didn't quite use a whole 1/4th cup poppy seeds, but I used an entire 0.8oz container - almost 1/4th cup.  As for the coconut cream pudding mix, I don't think you HAVE to use it(as another reveiwer put it..).  Maybe it adds a bit of a different flavor...or compliments the orange...at any rate, of you don't want to use coconut, use vanilla!  Not that big of a deal!  Anywho...as I said, this bread is wonderful!  All it needs is a powdered sugar icing drizzle and yuuuuuuuuuuummm!!!

This bread was ok.  The recipe calls for a 9 by 5 inch pan.  I used that pan and in the oven the bread started overflowing ou tof the pan.  It was a big mess to clean up and the cake is not very put together.  I don't understand why you had to use coconut pudding.  I will not try this again.

This recipe should be made in two pans. I used one as directed and it overflowed badly.

This overflowed all over the oven and pan and then hardened and was a mess. I will never make again.

This is a fabulous recipe! The only thing I did differently is add some orange zest to the batter.  I think next time I'll use orange juice for the liquid in the glaze. My company couldn't stop raving about this bread! (It's more like a coffee cake.)
