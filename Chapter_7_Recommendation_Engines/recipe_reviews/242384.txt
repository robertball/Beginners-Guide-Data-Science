My family enjoyed these saying they were "the best ribs we ever had!"  They were tender inside, with a crisp, savory shell and just a hint of sweetness.  The only change I would make is to decrease the amount of salt to 1/8cup.  Thank you for the recipe, Smithfield!

Perfect flavor balance between heat and sweet.  I added some garlic and onion powder as well.  I did brush on some BBQ sauce at the end for an extra tangy zip!  This is definitely a finger licking good Memphis ribs recipe!!!

Our new favorite recipe and brand of ribs! They turned out wonderful and juicy. I added BBQ sauce at the end and wouldn't change a thing. Using Smithfield/Farmland ribs definitely is what has made these great. Meaty and great taste.

Wow, these were tasty!  I really liked that they were not overly sweet, with just a hint of heat.  I followed the recipe for the seasoning, choosing instead to put the ribs on my electric smoker.  I smoked them for 4 hours, between 225 and 250 degrees, and they were done.  Mine were firm to the tooth, but not tough or stringy, really enjoyable.  Bonus:  doing these outside on the smoker, instead of partially cooking them in the oven, kept all the heat out of the kitchen.  I'll definitely do these again!

These were some of the best ribs we have ever had. Used Farmland Ribs and they were great, the price was good also. Most of the time we rely on sauce but these were so good and tender we didn't need any. Looking forward to having these again.

A complete success!  I followed this recipe to a t and it is RIDICULOUS!  So tender, just the right amount of spice and came together in minutes plus, of course, the time on the grill.  I WILL be making this one again!
I should disclose that I did everything that the recipe called for but got them started in my Ninja 3-in-1 Cooking System.  After that, I took them to the grill to finish them and give them that smoky flavor.  I then basted them with BBQ and they caramelized just beautifully.   I am currently living in a hotel while we are building a home and there is a grill here for the guests.  Since it has been raining off and on all day today, making them in the Ninja then finishing them on the grill seemed to be my best bet.  I was able to get them on and off the grill between showers! I LOVE this recipe!
