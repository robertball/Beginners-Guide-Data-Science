This is a good starting point. The first time I made it I found it needed more veggie. So the next time I added carrots and celery which made it much better. I also added two cinnamon sticks during the stewing time.

I'm not a big beef stew person, so I should've known better than to try this.  
If I were to try it again, I'd add the apples towards the end (they were mush of nothing...depends on what you want), and skip the herbs, using only salt and pepper....to enjoy the cooked down wine flavor more.

If you enjoy beef stew, I would bet you would enjoy this.

When I first added the red wine to the stew, it seemed like it might be a bit overpowering to the other flavors.  After it simmered, it was delicious.  I wouldn't hesitate to serve this uniquely flavored stew with popovers or cornbread and a mixed greens salad to dinner guests.

I really enjoyed this dish. It was simple to make and tastes great. I didn't have the dried spices on hand and only used half the amount of basil. I also held off on adding the apple until the last 15 minutes of cooking.  I would definitly make it again!

I cut down on the flour and used olive oil instead of butter - for health, not taste . :-)  Also I find fresh apples fall apart too easily, so I use dried apple rings to avoid mush.

Very nice stew.  Made some changes based on what I had on hand - sweet yellow onion instead of red and no shallot.  Used 1/2 cup of red wine so supplemented with splash of red wine vinegar.  Husband didn't really like it, but doesn't like anything cooked with wine!

Excellent! Very flavorful and my picky husband and sone liked it.  I did make a few changes for my family's tastes: skipped the flour dredge and just browned in canola oil; used white wine instead of red (that's all I had) and added an 8 oz can tomato sauce. I also used less onion and didn't use shallot.

We thoroughly enjoyed this dish.   Thanks so much for sharing!    I made half the recipe which was about four servings.

Very tasty.  I followed the recipe, with the exception of adding the apples at the same time as the pork.  I added them at the end.  Mine came out very soupy.  I had to add 1/2 cup of cold water and 4 TBS of flour to it to get it to stew thickness.  Next time I will up the amount of pork to at least 1.25 lbs.

I made this with pork stock since I had a pork bone in the freezer. Simple but delicious. Spice combination was just right. I might try it with a cup of white wine next time.

Great taste, although I would have preferred it less watery.

Wow! This was SO good! The combination of beef broth, red wine (used a $5 bottle of cabernet sauvignon) and herbs was fantastic! My boyfriend couldn't stop raving about it. 
The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because I didn't want mushy apples, so I put them in in the last 15 minutes so they softened but were still slightly crisp. I also added 2 additional TBSP of flour at this time to help thicken it up because it was still pretty thin. Delicious! Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this for a gaming night with friends.  It's amazing!  Everyone loved it, I used pino nior and doubled the recipe.  It took longer than 45 minutes to render down but it was well worth the wait.  I will be making this again for sure.

Delicious flavors! Loved it!  I added a bit of Crushed red pepper because I like spicy. but otherwise, used as written.
