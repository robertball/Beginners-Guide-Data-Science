Mmm. Maybe it's just that I only made two of these, but I didn't find the recipe to be difficult or time consuming. I skipped the peeling step, though, and I patted the dough into rounds rather than rolling it out. It yeilds a crispy, biscuit like crust, and a soft, warm apple. (Braeburn, in my case.) I rubbed the cinnamon sugar mix over the inside of the dough before wrapping the apple in it, and used a bit of allspice, rather than nutmeg. I also stuffed them with golden raisins. They would be lovely with vanilla ice cream, but if you haven't got any, a cold glass of milk will do. Incidentally, if you scale it down to two servings like I did, you might want to double the sauce.

This recipe is quite tasty.  I recommend using very tart apples, and cutting them  into quarters instead of halves, then rolling the crust to a very very thin layer which can be cut into 16 sections total, one for each apple quarter.  This decreases the cooking time by about 10 minutes and makes a smaller serving size.

These were a little bit of work having to make pastry dough, but they were really yummy.  I served them with vanilla ice cream which was wonderful.  My sauce did not turn out, though, it was runny and separated.  I followed the directions, but the sauce was not what I expected

I made the dumplings spaced out to make the look more decorative.  It worked but they spread out and became quite the filling desert.  I had these warm with ice-cream as a desert and then again the next morning, cold, as a breakfast.  Delicious :)

The taste of these dumplings is definately 5 stars, but the time it takes to make them bumped it down a notch.  Between peeling and coring the apples, making the crust, and making the sauce, these took about an hour to make and get in the oven, then another 45 minutes to bake. If you are planning on making these, make sure you have the free time and energy.  After tasting one though, the hard work was all worth it!  Thanks for a yummy recipe!

These turned out wonderfully. The sauce was thick and very flavourful. I will definitely be making these again.

You don't need the butterscotch topping for this to be good. The crust came out excellent, and I used whole wheat pastry flour.

I like a "flakey crust" apple dumpling and the addition of baking podwer gives these dumpling an almost biscuit like texture and taste. The apples and sauce were tasty but overall I was disappointed with these dumplings and would not make them again.

These are the best! My mom and I have been using this recipe for years and get rave reviews every time we take them somewhere. The only change I make is using store-bought pie crust.

Fantastic!  No major changes.  I quartered the apples instead of halving - much better serving size.  I put 1-2 teaspoons of the sugar-cinammon-nutmeg mixture into each smaller dumpling.  While I had a lot of the sugar mixture left over, I thought it came out perfectly.  Sweet, but not too sweet.  Also, I forgot them in the oven.  They may have been in an extra 20-40 minutes.  Well browned, but delicious.  I used Winesap apples - a rather tart apple.  I brought it to the neighborhood cook out and they disappeared like hot cakes!  The doughy part was wonderful.

really wonderful. I like how you do 1/2 an apple per dumpling, its a much more appropriate size, but still big!! this is absolutely to die for warm with vanilla ice cream. the butterscotch sauce is so flavorful, it's addicting.

The grandchildren loved these apple dumplings and even my hard to please son-in-law thought they were great.  The pastry is much easier to make than a pie crust type pastry and tastes better too!

I tried this recipe and loved it!  I couldn't believe how fluffy the pastry became.  It was light and moist.  Add a scoop of vanilla ice cream when serving...it's delicious!

Made this last night for my hubby who is a LOVER of apple pie and scaled it down to use 2 apples.  Hubby loved it, the dish just took FOREVER in the oven (it seemed) to make the apples soft enough to his liking... haha.  I didn't peel them either, next time I will peel the apples.  DH loved the sauce it made the most.  Very yummy!

Mmmmm this is so good!  At first I thought it was going to be kind of difficult and time-consuming, but really once the apples are peeled and halved the rest just flies by.  The brown sugar sauce doesn't taste exactly like butterscotch but it's still very good and it really compliments the apple taste. Also as an added bonus, my kitchen smells fantastic after baking this. I am going to serve these to my family tomorrow and I'll bet they're going to love them. Thank you Carol for the recipe!

My very favorite apple dumpling recipe!  My children go crazy when they smell them baking after school.  Thank you.  No adjustments to any of the ingredients for me.  The sauce is perfectly delicious and that's all we eat it with.  These are so delicious they do not need ice cream or any thing else.

Never had apple dumplings before so I don't know if these were good or bad.  I enjoyed them but won't make them again.  But it may just be that I'm not an apple dumpling fan.

These were awesome and fairly easy to make (no matter the recipe, I have issues rolling out dough). We will make again.

This is the first time I've made apple dumplings and it was fantastic! Baked for 40 min at which point the dumplings we're starting to go beyond golden brown. The apples inside were definitely done. The amount of dough was just right for the small-medium size apples we used, but would be insufficient for large apples. The tartness of the Granny Smith apples was a good contrast to the sweetness of the dough and sauce. After removing from the oven I used a brush to coat the tops with the sauce which turned out nicely. Great recipe! Nice dessert by itself, but paired with ice cream or whipped cream would also be good.

I halved the recipe and baked in a 9x9 pan. I still used 4 apples as mine were on the small side, I quartered them and placed them in the pan. I used butter for shortening and added some extra milk to place dollops of batter over the apples, which I then smoothed. Definitely do not forget the butterscotch sauce, it really makes the recipe! I used 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice for the spices. Next time I think I will try all brown sugar in the sauce. Mine baked in 45 minutes, served with vanilla ice cream. These were very good and easy.
