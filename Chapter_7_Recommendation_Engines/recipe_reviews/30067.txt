This was a wonderful salad. I made it for a dinner party and everyone enjoyed it. I did not make any changes to the recipe.

Great recipe...after a bit of improvement (no offense to the original recipe, but I always spruce up every recipe I encounter). First off, I added a few leaves of fresh basil torn up. Next, I also added three sliced green onions. I also added a dash of salt. Although, I didn't want to deviate from the original recipe to much, a few minor additions were what gave this already tasty recipe a personal touch. Thanks to the contributor for this new favorite!

This was very easy to make and good.  I always have peppers on hand (My three kids love them) and I had some spinach to be used up.  I served this with Raspery Tilapia (from this site) and rice.

Easy, healthy, delicious, great presentation.  The recipe did not specify regular or seasoned rice vinegar.  I used seasoned.

This definitely is "super easy" and tastes wonderful!  I opted for shredded Parmesan cheese vs. grated and added just a little salt, pepper and garlic to the dressing. Next time I might add a little red pepper flakes for a little added "kick".  This was very light and refreshing and you can easily adapt this to suite your tastes.

This was very good!  I used a mix of red, yellow and orange bell peppers because I had all of them on hand.  I used seasoned rice vinegar and the dressing turned out nice and light and just ever so slightly sweet.  I’ll make this one again!!

Beautiful, healthy and great tasting salad. I used roasted garlic seasoned rice vinegar mixed with EVOO and a dash of coarse salt and fresh ground pepper. The dressing was much better after sitting in fridge overnight. I also used both red and yellow peppers. I will make this again.

Very yummy and EASY. However i did add yellow peppers instead of red (that's what i had)but i also added a slove of fresh garlic pressed with the dressing and a tiny bit of onion salt, and whisked that all together! YUMMY! Thank You for this simple recipe.

This is a great salad - dressing was awesome. I did add a little bit of honey and a drop of sesame seed oil. I also added tomatoes (I didn't have bell peppers on hand) and smoked salmon to the salad - perfect combo. Thank you for sharing.

Surprisingly good and refreshingly simple.  I didn’t mix up the dressing, just drizzled the salad with the oil and vinegar (in the 3:1 ratio we prefer) and tossed.  I’d make it again.

Great recipe!  Would the creator PLEASE specify seasoned OR natural rice vinegar.  Most cooks have seasoned(sweetened) rice vinegar on hand. 

 I bought organic rice vinegar(not seasoned) for this recipe and it worked out great!

Delicious! Made this on Saturday for a potluck and everyone loved it, it was so good I am making it again tonight! I followed the recipe with the exception of using red, yellow, and orange peppers, and tomatoes. I also used less oil then the recipe called for and it turned out outstanding!

I'm a huge fan of spinach and red peppers, but this didn't do anything for me. I just don't think the flavours went very well together.

This was fabulous!!  I added some sliced red onion, toasted almonds, and crushed garlic/salt/pepper to the dressing.  It was great!!  I made it today for lunch and added grilled chicken on top!  This would also be great with roasted red potatoes, chopped avocado, fresh mushrooms, green onion, and chopped tomato!

A refreshing twist on a classic, the sharp Parmesan (we used a black peppercorn parm) and the rice vinegar really make the salad.  We also added scallions like I saw a couple of others did. Every flavor is simple and delicious and it's a great start to almost any meal.
I made this for my husband's birthday and he said it's his new favorite salad.  I think that says it all!

Really wonderful!  Who'd have thought to use rice wine vinegar in salad?  I used an orange pepper, decreased the EVOO by half and kept the vinegar the same.  I added lots of fresh ground pepper.  Amazing!

I wasn't sure we'd like this. My husband is veggie-phobic and I thought it might be too strong in vinegar. It wasn't. It was perfectly light and delicious. My husband said it was refreshing and asked me to put it on my "permanent to do list". Ha! I will!

My husband & I really enjoyed this!  I can see myself using the dressing for other salads, too.  I added a crushed clove of garlic to the dressing along with a little pepper.  Excellent use of fresh spinach!

I gave this 5 stars because of how easy it is to make and how good it actually tastes. I had spinach and red peppers I needed to use and wanted a side dish for grilled Salmon. I am so glad I found this recipe and just happened to have everything on hand. My husband loved it as well. We will be making this many more times!

I was looking for a quick, easy,  good, and inexpensive salad to take to someones house for dinner.  This salad was so good and used ingredients I typically have on hand.  It took about 5 minutes to make, and I received so many compliments.  Perfect for when it's your turn to bring the salad!

This is delicious! To make it a little less caloric, I mix the dressing 1 part oil to 2 parts seasoned rice vinegar.  Add the dressing to taste rather than as written. I also add a yellow pepper.

I googled a recipe for fresh spinach and sweet peppers, and this one came up.  I had both a red pepper and an orange one (as in the photo) but no rice vinegar so substituted balsasamic.  I was amazed that my guests LOVED it and wanted the recipe! Later, I prepared the rest of the spinach using red wine vinegar, which worked fine.  Then from those leftovers, I made a wrap with Mission brand "sun-dried and basil" tortilla.  That was best of all!

I made this for dinner as an accompaniment to oven fried chicken.  I used "Lady Lerandia's" additions of green onions, torn basil leaves and a little bit of salt.  I used red and yellow peppers because that's what I had on hand.  This was absolutely delicious and so quick and easy.  This will be a regular  addition to my salad rotation.

I made this salad using 1/3 green, 1/3 yellow, and 1/3 red bell pepper, and I also added some chopped green onion. I also used a grated Parmesan-Romano cheese blend instead of just Parmesean. This salad was so easy and fast to make, and it was light but flavorful. I definitely will be making it again - even for company - as I think anyone would enjoy it.

Indeed super-easy and also delicious!  I am in love with seasoned rice vinegar for salad dressing; the little bit of salt and sugar in it is a beautiful complement to the veggies.  I will def use this recipe again.  Thanks!

Super Easy Spinach & Red Pepper Salad Haiku: "Super easy, yup. But really needs seasoning. Like salt & pepper." I adore spinach, red bell pepper, and parmesan, and this sounded like a healthy way to incorporate them together for lunch, but one lick of the dressing and I wasn't overjoyed, so I had to had a couple grinds of black pepper, some salt, and garlic powder. With some red onion and cucumber on the side, (wish I'd had cherry tomatoes too!) it was a guilt-free lunch, easy to throw together!

We enjoyed this very much. Only changes done were to use orange, red, and yellow peppers, plus a bit of sliced onions to taste. 
Thank You for posting this. Good base recipe to use.

Like others, I added salt, pepper and garlic.  Was very good.  Had to use white wine vinegar due to not having rice vinegar.  What a healthy recipe.

This is a really tasty, quick little salad.  It is so yummy that even when we don't have this exact salad, we use the rice vinegar/olive oil dressing all the time anyway.  Delicious!
