My 10 yr. old made this for a school demonstration project - everyone enjoyed it!  We experimented with blending the pre-measured dry milk powder in blender to make it more smooth- and we liked that, too. Original recipe makes alot, we scaled it down to 2 servings and it was plenty for a snack for our 4 kids. A tasty and healthy snack!!A+

I teach preschool and my students loved this recipe.  We mixed each ingredient at a time. Each student was given a little dry milk on a tray and a handful of the peanut butter mixture.  The mixture was kneaded by the students until smooth, this was a great sensory activity! All of my students loved the taste, what an added bonus!

I had this recipe years ago when my daughter was a toddler and it was terrific! So easy and non-toxic ! What a great alternative to the store product. I made a copy for the mother of a toddler that lives next door so she can enjoy it. Her grandmother recently told me that she kept putting the store brand in her mouth and she had to throw it out, so I'm sure she'll appreciate it.

My two year old loves this!  Similar to what my mother used to make for me as a child.  I prefer to half the recipe and like to use corn syrup in place of the honey for a lighter flavor.  I've also found that sifting the powdered milk before adding creates a smoother textured dough.

Only used the first two ingredients like others suggested and it worked great!  My two year old loved to have playdough she could eat, though just a few bites was plenty for a snack! And cutting the recipe down to 5 servings, there's still plenty left in the fridge for another day.  Thanks for the recipe of a fun treat we all remember as kids!

This was really fun!  Substituted Maple syrup for honey.  Kids loved it and have plenty to play with for snack tomorrow! We reduced the recipe to 6. Thanks for the fun!

I've been looking for this recipe.  I remember this as "edible playdough".  I used this when my nieces came to visit.  They had as much fun as I did as a kid.

Omit the confectioner's sugar. It's an old recipe. We made it with equal parts of peanut butter, non instant powdered milk and used maple syrup or honey to make it pliable. Kids love to mix it up. For non instant powdered milk, use a blender. Pour in the instant powdered milk, knock the air out of it, pour that into a measuring cup, continue.. When you have as much as the jar of chunky peanut butter you used (8 oz peanut butter plus 8 oz non instant powdered milk), that's it! Mix them together! Or, go to the health food store and buy non instant powdered milk, it's still used in a lot of recipes. I would make it into balls, put melted choco chips into bottom of a small cupcake paper, place the ball into it, then dribble more chocolate on top. Also placed a walnut on top for decoration.  It's better to make cornstarch playdough for the kids, and teach them this is candy, to eat sparingly.

My kids LOVE this. I use Trader Joe's organic peanut butter and organic honey. HOURS of fun. Great for group playdates or rainy days stuck at home.

It wasn't bad, but I thought the honey flavor was a little strong.  Still, it was fun to play with.

Really, really, really sweet.  The consistancy was okay...but I was a little concerned about the huge amount of sugar.  I can think of better playdough recipes (less sticky and more colourful) and healthier snacks.  It was okay and I think that older kids would have fun helping mix the ingredients.

This is a great recipe, although I cut back on the milk and honey, it is not necessary to take it out.  And if you are having a problem with a honey flavor, you are probably using a dark, or strong flavored honey.  Buying a local, raw, light colored honey will not only help your playdough taste delicious, but it has the added bonus of helping ward off local allergins!

Awesome recipe! I have my neice and nephew in town for a couple of days. Since the recipe made 15 pieces I used the (calculate button) and typed in 2 one for each of them. I don't see the point in making any more servings than children playing with it. One large ball each for them was enough, and why waste the ingredients. I subbed corn syrup for the honey because it is more economical. I used Skippy creamy natural peanut butter, that has vegetable oil instead of shortening. I think now it was a good choice, as some people said their dough was too greasy. I think this is more about playing with it than eating it anyway, but neat they have the option to taste it. I think they would have a tummy ache if they ate all of that dough. So, I am not sure why some people complained of the taste. Either way, they are having a great time playing with this. I gave them a tiny wooden roller, some minature cookie cutters, and I also luckily have a plastic covered table cloth. They thought this was neat, thanks.

My children and I made this tonight! We thought it would be a fun project and snack too! I found that I had to use a lot more powered milk than was called for because it was very sticky! We made enough for 5 servings, which was enough for twp children to have a lot to play with (too much to eat). After they were done making shapes we cut up pieces of bananas and wrapped the dough around it …. Talk about tasty!

I love peanut butter playdough. Even my husband and I like to eat it and it's such a fun thing to serve up when you have visiting little ones! I used it as a fondant to decorate the top of a cake for my nephew.

This recipe needs a bit of tweaking. Our playdough came out way too dry. We added more honey, but my kids only ate about a tablespoon full each and the rest was played with for a while and then thrown out. They said it was too rich, I agree.

It tasted pretty good and the kids enjoyed playing with it. I would not make it again, due to it was a pain to make. After you add the honey, you have to fold in the Dry Powdered Milk. It took forever to mix and at the end, it was very frustrating. Not worth the aggravation.

A comment to the grandparent looking for an alternative to peanut butter in the recipe. My daughter is allergic so if you can, try almond or cashew butter. It's found in most large groceries. I've made this before and think that the milk powder adds nutrition and less sweet than the sugar. I think it's more of a treat than plaything, but good for young kids that put everything in their mouth. I'd try without honey or cut way back. Fun!

Love this recipe.  My grandson is 2 and love to play and eat, but he is allergic to peanut butter. Can I use something close to peanut butter like Nutella or the Hersey spread?

Not exactly what I was hoping for. I used the full amounts of peanut butter, confectioners' sugar, 1/2 the amount of honey and a good cup full of the powdered milk. It was still too dry, so I added a bit more water instead of honey as other reviewers said it was sickeningly sweet. It was okay, moldable, but not the smooth, playdough like texture that I was hoping for. My daycare kids loved the taste though!

My little girls loved this!  They had so much fun playing and sampling the dough.  I only used powdered sugar and peanut butter as suggested by others.  Thank you!!

I followed the suggestion of others and scaled it down to five servings using only the first two ingredients: peanut butter and powdered sugar. My kids had a blast and as the dough gets warm and sticky, I just add some more powdered sugar so they can continue to play.  Great idea and totally worth doing with your little ones.

I've made this a few times now.  It works well no matter how you make it, but I like some of the changes recommended by other users.  I like sifting the powdered milk and use about half honey and half corn syrup.

You don't need the last 2 ingredients to make playdough. Try it and see.

I got the idea of making this for my 2 1/2 yr old son for Valentines Day from the "Jon & Kate plus 8" show. I LOVE this idea however the powered milk didn't mix in very well for me. I'm not sure what I did wrong but all in all it provided me with some awesome one on one time playing with my son.
