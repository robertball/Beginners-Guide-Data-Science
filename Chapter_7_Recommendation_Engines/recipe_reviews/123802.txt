YUUUUUUUMMMM!!  I didn't have any pecans on hand, so I made without them.  After reading the other reviews about too much butter and them being hard I altered the recipe a bit.  I used the same amounts of butter and sugar but I increased the flour to 3/4 and I used 2 eggs and increased the cinnamon to 2 tsp.  Baked for 37 min, and they were AWESOME!  Crunchy outside and like a brownie inside!

These are great - taste kind of like a cross between caramel and apple pie (without the apples of course).  We are not fans of nuts in our baked goods, so I omitted them.  Definitely cut these while they are warm bacause they firm a great deal as they cool.  Oh, and I'd suggest cutting them into 1-inch pieces as suggested.  Additionally, rolling these in powdered sugar is a bit messy - next time I'll just sprinkle the powdered sugar on top.

Freaking awesome. Took them over the top and added half a bag of Hershey's cinnamon chips. Lordie. These are addictive. Don't make them unless you're going to a potluck otherwise you'll eat them all. Didn't last through the night.

These were so delicious! Very chewy and flavorful. I didn't have any pecans, so I substituted coconut, and also added 1/2 cup cinnamon chips. I'd love to try it with the pecans next time.

MMM, These are really really good.  I cut the butter down a bit per other reviews.  I also accidently melted the butter when I was softening in the microwave so not sure what effect that might have had on them.   The only thing I wasnt thrilled with was that they seemed to take a really really long time to get done in the middle.  I ended up turning the oven temp down a bit to make sure the middle was done and the outside edges werent overcooked.  I added a few white chocolate chips as thats what I had on hand.  My husband LOVED them.  Will definitely make them again.

Excellent flavor; definitely a bit crunchy once cooled, so do cut while warm. Once you warm them up in your mouth they are very chewy and soo delicious! I used chopped pecans instead of finely chopped, and I think it was a mistake; the bars are small enough that the big pecans make them fall apart easier. Rolling in powdered sugar is a bit of a hassle but definitely worth it!

I liked the recipe ok. It came together super simple so I'll give it 4 stars for that. It was however hard to really tell when done. I cooked mine for 45 minutes. I rolled on batch in 10x sugar then decided as other reviews said that it was easier to sprinkle a heavy coating on top after I had cut it into squares. Then I let cool a bit and took out the pan. I didn't have extra butter problems others reported, but I used real salted butter. The taste was good, but it wasn't anything more than just a snicker doodle / sugar cookie taste. I don't think I will make these again.

I only gave this recipe 5 stars because it didn't go any higher!  These bar cookies are beyond phenomenal!  I have made them twice now and they have turned out perfect both times.  I plan to make them many, many more times in the future.  Thanks for sharing!

These cinnamon bars were soooo good ans chewy! but the only problem is that they contain so much butter. When I took off the pan, butter was dripping off of them. In the future I will decrease the amount of butter to maybe half. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

These did not turn out at all as a cookie bar, but crumbled up and sprinkled over ice cream or other desserts, it is great.  It ended up like a praline crumble which I will contemplate making for that purpose in the future.  I too couldn't seem to get them out of the pan and they were far too crunchy to eat as a cookie-type bar.

I doubled the recipe and cooked in a 15x10 pan. The kids dont like nuts so just pressed the pecans into top of 2/3rd of the pan.  Was Very Yummy! Tasted like pecan pie!

These were good. Very soft and sweet. The edges crystallized overnight though and it was hard to cut edges. But they were still yummy

These are sooo good.  I reduced the butter by a few tablespoons according to others reviews.  Perfect, not greasy at all.  Just sprinkled powdered sugar on top to make it easier.  Quick to whip up in a hurry!

These are really good.  Did not roll in the sugar, didn't need it.  Has a really good cinnamon flavor.  They were really flat.  No matter, and they were chewy, yum, love the edges.

I really liked the flavor and I loved that they were chewy.  But they were hard to get out of the pan cause of the stickiness- not sure if I underbaked them or if that's how they really are.  I also agree they were a bit too greasy so I will definitely make again using a little less margarine and see what happens.  I usually don't add nuts to this kind of dessert, but I did put pecans on top on half of it and I actually really enjoyed it that way as well.

They smell amazing, and cook up better than I expected them to. The dough is very thick, and I thought it might be a bit too dense, but I curbed my desire to fidget with the recipe (I did use 3/4 c flour instead of 1/2, but other than that I was good) and decided to see how it went. Good choice on my part. Thank you for sharing the recipe!!

These were wonderful!  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect.  My husband doesn't like chocolate so I have a hard time finding desserts that we both love- but these won us both over!

These were really good when they first came out of the oven but I didn't care for them after they hardened.
