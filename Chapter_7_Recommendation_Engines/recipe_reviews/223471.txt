I've made this twice in the last few weeks and it's delicious.  I do it a little bit backwards.  I trim the asparagus and marinate it in about 2 tbsp of soy sauce and approximately 4 tbsp of sesame oil along with some finely minced garlic.  Then I heat the grill and cook the asparagus.  When it's done I pour the marinade over the roasted spears and serve it hot.  We all love it.  I don't add salt because the soy sauce takes care of that but I do add some freshly ground black pepper.

I really enjoyed this recipe, although was a little salty the first time I made it.  Cut back the soy just a little after that.  I do everything like instructed, and have even sprinkled with sesame seeds and do a quick seer to warm when it comes time to serve.  Get's all kinds of people to eat something they didn't think they liked!  Thanks for sharing.

I'm not a big asparagus fan, but this was really good!  I did make a few changes, like using Teriyaki Sauce instead of Soy Sauce and I added about a teaspoon of lemon juice and a pinch or two of brown sugar.  The sauce carmelized on the asparagus and we all finished off a whole batch of asparagus!  Will make again!

I hate asparagus but I made this and I ate so much I hardly ate my steak.  I did double or triple the marinade because we had a big bunch of asparagus and let it sit in the fridge for about two hours.  This is the only way I will make asparagus from now on.  This is DELISH!

I swapped the soy sauce for a healthier alternative of Braggs Liquid Aminos- gives that same flavor but is all natural (and less sodium). I also used only 1 tsp sesame oil and 1 tsp olive oil. Very tasty and healthy- I will make this agian!

This was very good.  I marinated it in the soy sauce with a little sesame oil and some olive oil and sprinkled it with sesame seeds.  Then i grilled it and served it hot.  My one child who likes asparagus said, "Make this again Mom.  This is good!"
