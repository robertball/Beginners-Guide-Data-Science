I'm glad to see the recipe has been revised!  I, too, had to guess at mixing.  The size of the pan is also not mentioned. The first time I made them I used a smaller baking sheet, and I had to bake them for about 30 minutes.  This time I used a 15 x 10 pan, and it was better.  I still had to cook them for 18 minutes, yet they are still the gooey texture you should look for.  These are very easy to mix up!  I would recommend not greasing the baking sheet; with this amount of oil, it's really not necessary and makes the batter much easier to spread.  I add 3t of baking powder and 1t of salt to the recipe with all-purpose flour.

So easy and fast... If you don't have self-rising flour on hand (which I did not) just be sure to add a little baking soda and baking powder.

I followed this recipe exactly and was quite pleased with the results.  Although it's not my favorite bar cookie, it's definitely very good and and I would definitely make it again.  I also love that the ingredients are things I usually have on hand - great for satisfying sudden cookie cravings!

These are an awesome change from the traditional chocolate chip cookie. I'm glad someone went in and fixed the mistakes in the recipe. If you make it just as it is now, you will be fine.

These are overall a good recipe...2 cups of choc chips is waaayy too much even for a choco lover, I used just 1 cup.  I also used a 1/4 c. less oil which made the batter a little bit stiffer but the whole cup seemed like too much. They are still very oily and moist.  these take much longer than 13 minutes to cook, more like 25 and are still gooey like the recipe says.

I added 1 cup craisins and 1 cup chopped almonds instead of the chocolate chips. I also used 1/2 cup melted butter and 1/2 cup oil instead of 1 cup oil. They were very good!

Turned out great!  I love how simple the recipe is and how quickly they come together.  I tasted the dough before putting it in the pan and they seemed like they were missing something so I added about a half tsp of butter flavoring and that really seemed to do the trick.  I also added pecans to ours.  These make a great breakfast treat as they are kind of a cross between a blondie and a granola bar.

This recipe has lots of room for improvement. Specifying the size of baking pan required would help a lot since this greatly affects the baking time.  I also agree with some of the other reviewers in that the cookies are very bland and have too many chocolate chips.  Easy to make, but I'm not sure I would make them again.

My 1 and 2 year old daughters loved them, but my husband and I both agreed they were bland and not even close to being sweet enough. I didn't use self-rising flour, so maybe that was the issue?

I had been looking for a chewy chocolate chip bar recipe and this was perfect. Not certain why other reviewers didn't like this recipe, I found it Easy & Awesome. I cut back on the chips just slightly and the amount was perfect for my family's taste. I used a 10x15 pan, next time I might use a smaller pan for thicker bars. As stated by earlier reviewers, I added baking powder and salt to my all purpose flour since I didn't have any self rising on hand. Overall WONDERFUL!

Really not that great of a cookie.  Too many chocolate chips, not enough oatmeal, not all that great even if these things were changed.

I love oatmeal-raisin cookies and I was looking for a good oatmeal-chocolate chip cookie to match.  I just didn't care for the texture of the oatmeal.  Maybe I should have let the dough sit for a while before cooking.  But my son loved them and thought they were like cookie dough so I give it a 4 star rating.

This recipe is incomplete.  The directions don't mention adding the oil or oatmeal from the ingredient list.  I guessed at the procedure and they turned out ok, but it wasn't easy.

The reason I really like this recipe is simple: I only used one measuring cup for the whole thing!  Woo Hoo!  They were a bit too sweet for me, so I may add a pinch of salt to balance that out next time.  However, I am more than happy to make these again! 
 A whole pan of cookies and I only had to wash the cup and a bowl!

Easy and good, used for a town fundraiser.  Switched most of the oil for melted butter I had on hand and sprinkled dry ingredients with just a bit of salt to make it taste a bit sweeter by opening the taste buds.

These are my 17 year old son's favorite cookies. I make them all the time. I have to bake them much longer but that could be because I use a baking stone. I find them a little too sweet; however, that plus the gooeyness is why my son loves them.

These are awesome!  I had to substitute the oil with coconut oil because I didn't have any and I think that added even more flavor.  They are very rich so a little piece goes a long way.  I will make this again because they are soooo easy and delicious.

They are WAY too sweet! Next time, I will reduce the chocolate chips by 1/2 and add in something nutritious like nuts and/or dried fruit.

My mom really liked these so I'll make them again.  This recipe didn't have any salt called for, & I added 1/2 tsp, because I think it just balances the sweetness.  So next time I think I'll decrease the sugar and maybe increase the salt to 1 tsp.

Very good and very easy!  After reading the reviews I made two minor changes:  I used 1/2 the oil, added 2T melted butter and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce. I also added chopped walnut pieces and instead of all chocolate chips, I used 1/2 chocolate and 1/2 butterscotch.  I didn't have self-rising flour so added 3 tsp of baking powder and 1 tsp of salt. I baked it in a 13x9 pan (that's all I have) and for about 20 minutes. They are delicious!!!

I substituted baking sugar substitute (Splenda) for the white sugar to decrease calorie count. These are hearty and delicious. Just became my new oatmeal cookie recipe.

The first time I made these I did not care for them.  They were dry and not brown on top. I decided to try them again since they are so easy to make. Here is what I did different. I spread the batter in the bottom of my broiler pan which I lined with foil. I then baked them for 13 minutes then put them under the broiler for exactly 2 minutes. They came out delicious, brown on top and the chocolate chips were melted leaving a moist delicious cookie. I now make these cookies weekly. My husband and three boys just love em.

I just made these and they turned out great! The perfect amount of chips.  I used barley flour (all I had in the house) and they turned out just fine. Good stuff.

These turned out great, I brought them to a cookout and they were almost gone before the burgers were cooked. A mix between a cookie and chewy granola bar. The only changes I made were instead of oil I used 1/2 c. applesauce and 1/2 c. peanut butter, I used mini chocolate chips and my flour wasn't self-rising.

Quick & easy to make. I found it needed longer to cook.
