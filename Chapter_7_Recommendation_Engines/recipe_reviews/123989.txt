This bread is fantastic!  I made it just two days ago and we're running out already.  I used 1 c. white sugar & 1 c. brown sugar, and also used 1 1/2 c. white flour & 1 1/2 c. whole wheat flour.  I also increased to 1 t. cinnamon, and added in 1/2 t. pumpkin pie spice in addition to all the other spices.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used 1 3/4 c. shredded zucchini, which I squeezed some of the liquid out of before mixing into the batter.  I made two mini loaf pans, which baked for 50 min., and one 8x4" pan, which I left in the oven for another 20 min. (1 hour, 10 min.).  I did the toothpick test and they turned out great.  Everyone loved this bread and I will definitely be making it again-- and probably soon, since our zucchinis from the garden are still producing.  Thanks for an excellent recipe, Pat!

Overall, very tasty.  Like some other reviewers I would add more zucchini if I did it again, as this is mainly a pumpkin loaf as is.  I'd also lower the cloves and up the cinnamon.  I used 3/4 of the sugar called for and it was still very sweet.  I also substituted applesauce for half the butter, to make it a bit lighter.

This recipe is very good. I added about 3/4 of a cup of raisins in addition to the walnuts.I used an entire 15oz can of pumpkin. I also used about 1 and 3/4 of a cup of zucchini.To make it a bit healthier I used one half whole wheat flour, one half regular. Used 1 cup brown sugar, one cup white as well. Really really good, I cant stop eating it. I made it two days ago and over half the batch is gone. It made two regular sized loaf pans. Will definetly make again.

This bread is so easy to make - quick to put together also.  I made a double recipe and it made 12 mini loaf pans.  For the double recipe I used 1 cup melted butter and 1 cup veg oil (that's the only major change I made).  I love the taste of butter but I've come to realize that oil creates such a nice moistness & texture for quick breads so I figured that a combination of the 2 fats would be ideal.  I personally think that a bit more spice is needed in this recipe and I usually am not one to prefer spice.  For a couple of my loaves I sprinkled a mix of brown sugar, cinnamon and granulated sugar on top before they went into the oven.  It created a nice, slightly crunchy streusel like texture and added a bit more spice.  I think I would continue to sprinkle that on top if I made this again.  I left out the walnuts on some also and since I do not care for nuts, I preferred the nutless loaves.  But this recipe and it's lovely spicy aroma reminds me of fall, except that I'm using my summer zucchini!  It's very tasty and quick and probably pretty versatile - like if you wanted to add coconut or chocolate chips or dried cranberries etc. I'm rating it 4 stars instead of 5 because I think a bit more spice is needed but I DO think you should give this a try.  It's a great way to use up the zucchini.  For my double recipe I used an entire medium size zucchini.

Wonderful! I made this the day before Thanksgiving when I wound up with extra pumpkin after I made my pumpkin pie. I baked it in a bundt cake pan, and made a cream cheese icing for it the next morning. Perfect for Thanksgiving morning brunch along with a breakfast casserole! Everyone loved it.

This is a great recipe to make into muffins -- so portable and easier to serve.  I also used a cup of trail mix that included sunflower seeds, cashews, peanuts and more in place of the walnuts.  I sprinkled toffee chips on top of each muffin also.

This was sooooo good!  It was a nice change from plain old zucchini bread.  I doubled the recipe and made four loaves, took them to work and everyone devoured them.  I was asked for the recipe numerous times.  Will definately make this again!

You just can't beat the combination of fall flavors in this wonderful easy to make quick bread. It has a dense texture similar to a pound cake. I added chopped walnuts and dried cranberries for some extra texture. The recipe made two nicely sized loaves. Follow the recipes and you won't be disappointed.

Let's face it - one pumpkin bread recipe is pretty much the same as the next - at least in my experience anyway.  And here's another good one.  The  combination of pumpkin and zucchini is different, and it works.  The golden bread dotted with specks of green is quite pretty. Like all I've tried, this bread is moist but here's the difference - this one calls for butter, not oil, and its flavor can't be beat.  This had just the right amount of spice too.  I made a half recipe, as I had about a half cup of pumpkin leftover from another recipe.  I baked it in an 8x4" rather than 9x5" pan that resulted in a cute, not too tall loaf.  The batter only filled about half the pan, so I know I would not have been pleased with how "short" the loaf would have turned out had I used the larger pan.

Awesome! Today I made 4 different recipes using zucchini and this was the best!  The pumpkin and zucchini pair well and the spices are just the right blend.  Because I had so much extra zucchini I upped the zucchini to 1 3/4 cups and it was perfect! I am going to freeze zucchini to be able to bake this with fresh pumpkin this fall. Thanks Pat for a great recipe!

Very simple for my oldest son and I to make together. This is one of two zucchini bread recipes we chose for today. I used half whole wheat flour and having two oranges I had to use, I zested one and used the fresh juice from both, heated to boiling, to soak a cup of raisins in. The smell of this baking reminds me of Christmas, this would be a good give-away gift. I did have to cover the loaves with foil at the halfway point to keep the top from scorching. Very nice bread. Quite hearty and most comforting. NOTE: This is even better the day after. The flavors get a chance to melt together and develop. YUM.

Yummy! I made these for snacks to pack in my husband's lunches. I used one cup of sugar, 2 1/2 cups wheat flour, 2 cups zucchini, 1 1/2 cups pumpkin, 1/2 c. olive oil + 3/4c. applesauce (instead of margarine or butter). They are so moist and light, not too sweet and packed with goodness! Yumm! Will definitely make again.

This bread was fantastic! I followed a couple of the suggestions in the comments (1c white sugar and 1c brown, 1 3/4c zucchini), and it turned out great! I will definitely be making this again soon.

I don't even want to look for another recipe.  I substitute one cup of white sugar for brown, skip the walnuts, and bake for 42 min.

Like the bread! I left out the walnuts since even though I personally love them, we intend to shre the bread with those who may not. I did add a touch more zucchini and will add even more next time I made it, which may be tomorrow! Other than that, it's great! Very moist and very tasty!!

I made a lot of changes to this bread and it tasted fantastic!  I'm sure it would taste just as good with the original recipe too, but I thought I would share my changes because I made it even more healthy.

I cut the sugar and butter both in half (so 1 cup sugar and 1 stick butter), used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, did not use cloves or walnuts, and added 2 apples (peeled and chopped) and approximately 1 cup of whole flax seeds.

This made 2 loaves of bread and it was fantastic!  The bread was sweet but not too sweet...  The first loaf was gone in 1 hour.  The only thing I'll do differently next time is add more zucchini and possible another apple or 2, and try using no sugar at all.

Love this recipe, so easy and yet so so so goooood!  I baked the batter into muffins.

These are the changes I made to trim the recipe:
- 3/4 cup of margarine
- 1 cup of brown sugar + 1/2 cup of dried black currants
- 2 cups of flour + 1/2 cup bran + 1/2 cup oatmeal
- used fresh organic pumpkin and zucchini instead

The end result--18 medium size ultra-moist muffin with wholesome goodness!  They make perfect breakfast and I just baked them yesterday and 2/3 are already gone!!!

This bread is amazing. My daughter, who is a very very picky eater, is devouring it. And it makes the house smell so good!! I did change a couple of things to my preference, I used 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce. I did not use nuts, and used about 1/3 cup extra pumpkin. I also used 1 cup packed brown sugar and 2/3 cup white sugar. With these changes the bread is pretty healthy. 140 calories, 4 grams of fat, and 3 grams of protein per serving (made 3 loaves, a serving being 1/8 of the loaf). I never would have thought to add Zucchini on my own, I am glad I found this recipe!!!

I made this yesterday afternoon...it was gone by last night.  My kids LOVED it.  I added almost a cup more zucchini because some left after shredding it.

I think it's pretty good, very moist. Will make again. My kids loved it, so it was nice sneaking in those extra veggies.

I made this for a get together and everyone was raving. Even people who previously mentioned a disinclination toward pumpkin were delighted with this bread. I added more zucchini, per others' suggestions, substituted apple sauce for half the butter, and added less sugar. I also used half wheat flour. This recipe is so great, I think any minor alterations will still leave you with a superlative bread. Great recipe.

AMAZING! This is actually the first thing I ever baked from scratch, so if I can make this, ANYONE can! It came out super moist (but not too gooey or mushy), and the flavors were perfectly balanced.   My roommate ate almost half of the loaf! He sends his compliments too ;)

I've been meaning to review this recipe for a while.  I LOVE this bread and it's always a big hit, even sent a loaf to my dad in Afghanistan.  I originally chose the recipe because the description mentioned my hometown :)  This bread is DELICIOUS (it makes great muffins too!).  Thank you for the amazing recipe!

Excellent bread! :)  I used raw sugar and cut out 1/2 a cup of it and it is still plenty sweet.  I used two cups of zucchini.  And instead of butter I used a cup of milk, not for fat concerns, but because I had milk that needed using up.  I baked it for an hour then turned the oven off and left the bread in the oven over night.  Came out really moist and great tasting.

This is my favorite zucchini bread recipe by far. I added nutmeg and allspice and substituted almonds since I hate walnuts.

I made it exactly as the recipe says, but cut it in half as I only wanted one loaf.  It was really good and I had many compliments on it when I brought it as a treat to my office.  I would add more zucchini if I did it again but that is just personal taste.

this is a great base recipe, but i of course customized it!  i used 4 eggs, brown sugar, real butter, doubled the spices and added ginger, and used 3.5 cups shredded zucchini and forgot to add the walnuts.  i made them into muffins, it yielded 24 perfect sized muffins and baked for 30 minutes at 325.  SO GOOD!  these are absolutely a new favorite twist on pumpkin bread/muffins.

I halved this recipe and made into muffins.  I used applesauce in place of the butter, pumpkin pie spice in place of the individual spices, and white chocolate chips instead of walnuts (which I did not have).  Great combo of flavors the whole family - including the finicky dh - loved.  Thanks for sharing!!!

This recipe is great!! We veganized the recipe by replacing the eggs with 3 Tblsp of plain soy milk and 1/4 cup more of the canned pumpkin and replaced the margarine with Earth Balance spread.

I really enjoyed this! I'm not at all a fan of pumpkin flavored things but this was really great. The recipe was very simple and easy to follow. I used an electric chopper for my walnuts and zucchini which I think made the taste a little less prevalent in the final product. I also had no cloves but over all, this is GREAT! My family loved it. I'd make it again.

Good tasting bread!  What a great way to use some of the canned pumpkin I had leftover from another recipe.  As I am not a baker, I followed the recipe but added a little extra pumpkin because I had 1 1/2 cups left.  Turned out great.

You can also make it more healthy by substituting 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup flax meal, and 1/2 cup wheat germ for equal parts of the all purpose flour. The wheat germ gives it an even more nutty flavor. AWESOME! We are loving this 'health' bread and its a great way to use all the pumpkins from our big patch.

I made these as muffins rather than bread - just greased a muffin tin and baked them a bit less time. They are amazing! They make a great on-the-go breakfast, and I've received tons of compliments.

Wonderful recipe!  Just made a few changes for personal taste: 1 c. white sugar, 1 c. brown; 1/2 c. canola oil, 1/2 cup applesauce instead of butter; 1-1/2 c. each all-purpose & whole wheat flour.  I did add more zucchini because it needed using up.  Instead of 2 loaves, I made one & a batch of muffins, adding raisins to the bread & chocolate chips to the muffins for the kids. Excellent!

This recipe is great.  I also added 2 cups of zucchini instead of the 1 cup and it came out perfect.  I found I need to bake the regular loaf pans for 1 hour 10 minutes or so, not the 45 - 50 suggested but it was amazing

Quite fabulous indeed!  I've made so much of this in the past week, and I keep getting more requests from friends, family, and strangers!  It's super moist, and oh so yummy!  I left the walnuts out simply because we don't have nut fans at our house, but it sure doesn't seem to miss them.  I also use fresh pumpkin...cuz I have a ton. ;)  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!!

I also used 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown and 1/2 white flour and 1/2 wheat, increased cinnamon, added cloves and used 2 cups shredded zucchini. I mistakenly never added the butter and it still turned out moist and delicious. My picky 2 year old loves it, even the husband was impressed with our super healthy treat!

I made this bread for my family and everyone loved it! It's pretty easy to make and is full of flavour. I added a bit more cinnamon and baked for about 10 min. longer than suggested and it came out perfectly moist and ready to eat.

A wonderful recipe to have on hand when you have just a little pumpkin and zucchini leftover, which I did.  I cut the recipe in half to only yield one loaf.  I then cut the butter in half and subbed applesauce for the other half.  The result was a perfectly spiced, moist bread.  I never would have thought of the combination of pumpkin and zucchini myself, so I am sure glad someone else did!

Like others I used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar.  I also added pumpkin pie spice and extra zucchini.  I only had one loaf pan on hand, so I made one loaf and put the extra batter into a muffin tin (made 9 good sized muffins).  For the muffins I baked at 350 for about 24 minutes...fluffy, moist, yummy!!

Made it exactly as written.  I would add more zucchini.  It was fun to share this with my English friends who could not image what "courgette bread" tasted like.  Several asked for the recipe.

This is very tasty.  I took the advice of some other reviews and cut back on the sugar to 1 1/2 c., used less cloves and more cinnamon.  I also peeled and chopped 2 apples and stirred in.  Used pecans instead of walnuts.  Will make again.  Nice fall treat.  Gave it 4 stars because I made the changes.

It was perfect.  I made it with zucchini from my CSA box and pumpkin I grew myself (the puree came out of my freezer). I added 1 cup of chocolate chips to the recipe to ensure that my daughter would eat it (she did).  I baked it for 50 minutes. Yum!

I cut this in half and made only one loaf for Thanksgiving - it was gone fast.  Then I made the full recipe and ran out of zucchini - but I made up for it with chopped apple.  It turned out just as moist and was great. I also just used pumpkin pie spice for all of the spices since I didn't have them on hand. Thanks.

This recipe is yummy. Neither myself nor my husband care for nuts in bread, so I substituted some chopped dates for the walnuts.
It came out so moist and flavorful.
I'll be making this recipe often just to share with friends and family!

My teenage boys have been asking when the zucchini will be in season so they can have this delicious Pumpkin Zucchini Bread.  The spice blend is perfect, and there is a great contrast between the crisp crust and moist interior.  Tasty warm. What does it taste like after it has completely cooled? I may never find out!

This is a wonderful recipe as is. It has a delicate flavor that doesn't overwhelm with any of the spices.  The only changes I made were no nuts and instead of bread, I made muffins.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Very good!  I was cleaning out the freezer and found a cup of frozen zuchinni and a cup of frozen pumpkin...so I looked for a recipe to use it up.  I changed it a bit to make it more healthy, (boyfriend has high cholesterol) egg beaters for the eggs, 1/2 C applesauce and 1/2 C Earth Balance for the oil, and I replaced the nuts with dried cranberries.  I also doubled the spices.  I did forget to add the vanilla and but was still very flavorful. I will definitely be making this again.  

I also didn't have a 2nd loaf pan so I used a Angelfood tube pan.  It took about 65 minutes in the oven.

This is a delicious recipe!  I added about double the zucchini and I used canned pumpkin pie mix instead of regular pumpkin and added a little more than the recipe states.  I added a bit more cinnamon and extra walnuts as well.  I made muffins instead of the bread and baked at the same temp for 25 mins...they turned out great, moist and so delicious!

Delicious!!!  I did make some alterations based on other reviews and what I had on hand:

Subbed all whole wheat flour
1 3/4c sugar
Doubled the zucchini (maybe even a bit more)
Subbed canola oil for butter
Doubled cinnamon
Halved cloves
Left out the nuts.

I baked these as muffins at the same temp for 25minutes- it made 24 muffins plus enough for a mini loaf extra. My 5 year old asked "what smells so delicious!" as they were baking. Yum!

i love this recipe and my husband does also. I did not add the nuts because my husband is not a fan of them and I also added extra zucchini.we also had some homemade chocolate frosting in the fridge so we glazed the top of some muffins that I made from my batch. OH SO GOOD!!! love it and I am going to pass this on.

I give this 5 stars, but I changed a lot that resulted in a less than stellar product.  That it still came out as good as it did, is AMAZING!  My changes included: used one cup whole wheat flour and 2 white, used all applesauce and no oil, subbed pecans for walnuts because that's what I had.  I also cut the sugar to one cup total, splitting white and brown.  I added about 1/2 C more zucchini and pumpkin.
To improve my final product, I will be adding back some more sugar, but that's it!

Wonderful, easy, the perfect thing to make your neighbors jealous in the Fall! I make this pre-Thanksgiving and give it out to my mailman, neighbors, grandparents, just about everyone. They all love it, and when I tell people with kids that there's zucchini in it? They can't believe their picky kids just ate a couple veggies without a complaints. Well, until it comes time for the last slice!

Delicious bread!  I did make a few changes, using the called for ingredients, except in the following cases:  used 1 C white sugar, 1 C dark brown sugar; 3/4 C melted butter, 1/4 C applesauce; 1 1/2 C whole wheat flour, 1 1/2 C all-purpose flour; 1 tsp ground cinnamon; 1/8 tsp ground nutmeg; 2 C shredded zucchini; no walnuts.  The result was a wonderfully moist, delicious bread.  I will be making more of this to use up more of the zucchini I have in my refrigerator.  Much better than just plain pumpkin or zucchini bread!

This was tasty bread.  Not too pumkin-y at all. I did as other's suggested and added more zucchini than the 1 cup.  I used 4 small zucchini.  Made 1 loaf, 24 mini muffins (1 pan full) and 6 mini loafs (about the size of cup cakes).  Froze the minis to see how well they store.

this was amazing, and my husband LOVED it!  I was a little worried, because I only had about 2 1/2 cups of flour and I accidentally added 1 tsp of baking powder, but it turned out just fine.  I did use pecans instead of walnuts, because that is what I had on hand, but it worked.

My friend makes mini muffins from almost all quick bread recipes.  She then freezes them and toss them in the microwzve for a few seconds for her girls.  I made this recipe using half whole wheat flour and half brown sugar.  I doubled the recipe and none of them made it to the freezer!!!  I guess I will have to wait until no one is home to actually make this recipe and freeze the muffins!  Great recipe.

Oh man, I've got a new favorite!  I loved how these flavors combined so subtly and the cloves really came through to make you think of fall!  Used 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 whole wheat flour, 1/2 all-purpose flour.  I bumped up the cinnamon just a touch.  Doubled the recipe to make 2 9x13" pans.  Each baked at 350 for exactly 30 min.  I think I'm going to make this right before my mother-in-law comes over next time because the whole house smelled fabulous!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Awesome! Pumpkin can sometimes not be as moist as some quick breads, so the zucchini ensures the moistness. I don't like to waste stuff, so I used a small can of pumpkin (1 3/4 cups) and doubled the recipe. I made 4 loafs, but they were small, so next time I'll do 3. Like other reviewers, I did increase the amount of zucchini. I used two smallish zucchinis for the double recipe I made (approximately 3 1/2 cups).

I read the reviews and added a bit more pumpkin and more zucchini, i also drained the water out of the zucchini. I cut the sugar and replaced 1 cup of it with brown and used 3/4 c white. I used non-dairy type butter made from so oil and it was awesome! Increasing the spices also made it amazing!

It's going fast around here!

I have made this recipe several times and ALWAYS get asked for the recipe. I find it a wonderful way to use up the fruits of your summer garden with a fall twist! Top a slice with sweetened cream cheese and you have a wonderful additional to your afternoon tea/coffee.

Good Recipe although I made a few changes.  I didnt have pumpkin so I used sweet potatoes.  That kicked off the other changes.  I used spiced rum instead of vanilla, pecans instead of walmuts and made a glaze with butter, sugar and a hint of rum in it.  Great out of the over, better the next day.  The spices are perfect though.  I was getting tired of bland zucchini bread.
THIS IS A KEEPER.

My husband and two-year old loved this recipe.  I baked it as mini muffins so I made some modifications to the recipe.  I used 1 cup of vanilla yogurt instead of the butter and added 1/2 cup of applesauce.  I baked the mini muffins at 350 degrees for 10-15 minutes. Delicious!

Delicious!  My husband hates nuts, so I left out the walnuts.  I added pumpkin pie spice in addition to the other spices.  I also used egg beaters instead of eggs to cut down the fat/calories, but no one could tell the difference.  My husband and mother do not normally care for pumpkin.  However, they both loved this bread!

A household favorite and a perfect way to use up that zucchini. Bread, muffins, even in a 9x13 with cream cheese frosting.. YUM!. It's also really good fried in butter. It freezes well, too. Perfect as written!

Awesome recipe, subbed half cup of butter for half cup of applesauce and subbed quarter cup of flour for wheat germ. I added more zucchini too. Super moist and tasty!

This bread is delicious, although I did make quite a few changes. I'm gluten free, so I used equal parts Bob's Red Mill's GF oat flour, GF biscuit mix and GF baking mix. It seemed really sweet, so I cut the sugar to 1/2 c. brown sugar plus 1 TBSP each honey and molasses. To cut down on the fat, I only used 2 TBSP butter and used applesauce for the rest. I increased the spices and ended up using about 2 c. zucchini. Finally I used roasted, unsalted pumpkin seeds and dried cranberries in place of the walnuts. Om nom nom!

We loved this recipe!  Was so moist and full of flavor. A great fall bread!

I used a full can of Pumpkin and baked the whole recipe as a double loaf in a 9 inch square baking pan at 350 degrees for 1 hour and 10 min.

I have been craving pumpkin and my mom gave me an extra large zucchini from her garden, I had everything else in the pantry and this was a cinch.  I did like everyone else and increased the amount of zucchini, it probably ended up being more like 2 cups (squeezed). I also used 1 tsp cinnamon and added some ginger.  I multiplied the recipe by 1.5 and made one regular loaf, two smaller ones, and four muffins.  The smaller loaves are in those store bought aluminum pans (I think 8 in.) and I'm going to give them to some people and keep the big loaf for myself.  THe muffins are fantastic too. This is quite tasty!

Delicious! My boys give it 2 thumbs up. I did double the recipe so I could freeze some but its such a hit it will likely be gone in the next few days....it made 2 large loaves &12 lg. Muffins. I used half brown/half white sugar, doubled the spices, added a bit of ginger as well, I thought it needed at least double the cinnamon, & we like spice in these type of recipies (pumpkin/zuchinni etc...) a quarter of the flour was whole wheat.....added some choco chips to the muffins too. Very versatile recipe, easy to customize for your likes (nuts, chocolate, coconut). Great! Thanks! Love the  combo of beautiful fall flavors

I was looking for a new way to use my garden zucchini, and this sounded yummy for fall. It turned out yummy, but a little less moist than I was expecting. Maybe my zucchini was a little dry, or maybe it's because I used 1/2 cup butter 1/2 cup oil. But it's good bread, and I would make it again.

This was a good recipe, however, tasted almost exclusively of pumpkin, and I was using zucchini picked fresh from my garden, so I can't blame it on a bland store bought zucchini lol.  I would personally recommend using more zucchini if you are looking for flavor from both veggies in the bread.  I don't know if I will make this again.  Perhaps if I grow my own pumpkins next year and have success, I may try this recipe, otherwise, I will stick with making plain pumpkin bread without the zucchini, which is what I've always done in the past.  Oh, and I've always used canned pumpkin, just as I did with this recipe.

I made them for first time today.  Absolutely delecious, moist and easy to make.  Since other reviews recommended draining and adding extra zuchinni I did and turns out perfect.  I added at least 1 1/2 cups or so more for a quaddrouple batch.  Also extra nutmeg, cloves and cinnamon.  Will add this to my recipe collection.

This recipe is wonderful.  I didn't have the canned pumpkin, so I subbed in 1c sweet potato that I baked in the microwave.  It turned out great, and my kids loved it.

Turned out very well. I used extra zucchini--close to 1 3/4 cups, a mix of Splenda and brown sugar, and used a 9x13 inch pan. I had to cook it for close to an hour. Very tasty, although the inside was more creamy than bread-like, even with the shallower pan and longer cooking time.

Fantastic!!  Easy, and my 15 month old love it.  I made 1 5x9 loaf and two small loaves which I froze.  I didn't have the nuts it called for so I substituted some semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I also used half whole wheat flour and half all-purpose.  I put extra zucchini too just because I like to.  I'll be making this again!!

This was an excellent bread.  The only change I made was to add raisins.  It turned out moist and very flavorful. This one is a keeper!

I thought this recipe was great.  I added 1 cup of chocolate chips, and everyone loved it.
