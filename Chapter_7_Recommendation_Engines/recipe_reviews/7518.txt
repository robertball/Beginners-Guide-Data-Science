Absolutely gorgeous! I just followed the recipe exactly, except added a little bit of clove. Perfect if you're a beginner like me.

This is a European style cake.  It's quite dry and not particularly sweet, but frosting helps with the extra sweetness.  I will probably not make this one again because I like my cakes more moist, but it's a great recipe if you're looking for a European style cake.

Ever since I was little  carrot cake has always been my favourite and there was a certain cafe I'd go to up until I moved to Germany and for 3 years I've searched for a carrot cake recipe like there's and I have to say this not only is the recipe I have been looking for but it is much much better than theres :D What impressed me even more was that my horrified fiance who couldn't believe his eyes when he saw me putting carrots in a cake and was adiment that I had just ruined a perfectly good cake mixture ate 1 whole of these cakes to himself.

I think I'll half the mixture next time though as I got two beautiful cakes out of this in 10 inch pans. Also I iced it with the cream cheese frosting recipe I found on this website.

Absolutely fabulous! I made this for the first time yesterday for Easter dinner and it was superb! Not too sweet (which was perfect after a meat-filled main course) with lovely flavours. I made cream cheese and bourbon frosting (from this site) and drizzled it over the top. I also added some ginger to the cake mix.  Everyone wanted some to take home! And it was a perfect little breakfast indulgence with a cup of coffee this morning, too ;)

This wasn't the best carrot cake I've ever had. It was sort of dry. It wasn't very flavorful. It needed to be a bit sweeter. Tweaking it with some more sugar and maybe some more oil might help.
