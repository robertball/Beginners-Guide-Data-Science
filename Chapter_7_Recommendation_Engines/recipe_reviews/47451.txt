I've been looking for a good way to make a malt milkshake and this was it. I blended everything except the soda water, and then stirred it in at the end so it stayed fizzy. This was perfect, with just the right amount of malt and sweetness.

This is the perfect shake to help chill your mouth out after the orthodontist or oral surgeon.  Add a shot of chocolate or strawberry syrup to change the flavor.

I've had a bad sore throat for days and spent lots of money on milkshakes. I found this easy recipe and have made two for myself today. Carbonated water is also called seltzer water, and you can use ginger ale as a substitute. Much cheaper than getting one out and just as good.

This was a big hit with the whole family! We were able to add flavors to fit each taste, some liked the vanilla, others prefer chocolate or strawberry, very good recipe to play with. The only issue I had was that it was too thin, Add another scoop or 2 of ice cream and it thickens up perfect!

it was ok. i had to add some more ice cream to thicken it up a little. but that could be because i used 1% milk.

I adore Vanilla-malt shakes!!! I had no idea that seltzer water was used. I LOVED this one. Mine was a bit runny also, but more ice cream made it perfect. GREAT recipe. Thank you.

The mixture turned out too thin. Maybe it's because I used 1% milk? Even after adding more ice cream, it was still way too thin.

3/7/16 update: I attempted to make this again, and as written, it is still too thin, almost watery. But when I put two more scoops of ice cream in the mix and pulsed it another two or three times and the consistency was near perfect. If the mixture starts out too thin, just keep adding ice cream until you get the consistency you want. Common sense, right? If it were common, it would be more common ...

I made this exactly minus the carbonated water. Turned out great! Keep in mind I made this without the water and it is not thick at all, so if you add the water I can't imagine how liquidy this would be. It is more of a vanilla malt drink than a shake.

Can anyone tell me WHERE on earth I can purchase powdered malt?  I have searched for YEARS and I have never been able to find it.  I would love to try out this recipe but I'm missing a main ingredient.  Anyone who can help me out?  I live in the Phila. suburbs.
Thank you!

To answer the previous post "BECKWILL", I couldn't find malted milk powder at the stores either. I found it on AMAZON, made by Carnation, and buy them 3 at a time. The powdered malt milk also makes grest fluffy pancakes, when mixed in your reg. batter. This shake turned out a little runny, so I don't add much water.

I love this milkshake! It's my favorite recipe I use when I feel like making vanilla milkshakes. 

Although I do everything according to the recipe, I never use the carbonated water. I prefer it that way.

Thanks for sharing.
