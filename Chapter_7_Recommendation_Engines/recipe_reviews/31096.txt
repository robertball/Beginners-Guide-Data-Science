My grandchildren always ask for this when they visit.  I did adjust just one part and it may help someone else.  After the pork chops are tender, remove to a heated plate.  Leave the cover off the pan and sprinkle the onions with a little white sugar.  The water will evaporate quickly and the onions will carmalize beautifully. Serve them on top of the chops and then make gravey in the same pan.

Delicious! BUT, I think the second simmer is meant to be uncovered so the liquid can evaporate and onions camelize.  About 10 minutes before they were done I had to boil down the liquid.  I will definitely make these again, but I will uncover the skillet for the second simmer.

I received this wonderful recipe today in my Allrecipes.com daily recipe e-mail.  Luckily, I had everything I needed on hand.

It had just started cooking and my husband came into the kitchen to see what smelled so delicious!

I used a skillet with a top that allows steam to escape (from Cook's Essentials line on QVC - wonderful products.  

I added garlic (early on) and mushrooms (at very end) like others here had suggested.  I also added extra onion and would suggest a minimum of 2 - could be more if you like onions.

The chops cooked so well with the steam able to "escape", that I did not have to leave the lid off at any time.

End result???? An absolute winner!!!! I would use for company....... They were soooo good - this is the first I've taken the time to write a review.

Enjoy!!!!!

This was very good!!! My boyfriend is not a big fan of pork chops but he loved this. I browned the chops first, removed them from the pan, added the onions and a teaspoon of sugar. I carmalized the onions than added back the chops and used 1 cup of beef broth in place of the water. Excellent, will make again and again.

This recipe gave me a good start for something new with pork chops.  Here are the changes I made: I used pork loin chops, sprinkled them on both sides with salt, pepper, sweet paprika and cajun seasoning.  I browned them on both sides in olive oil removed them from the pan, added a little more oil and added the onions.  I sprinkled a little sugar over the onions and covered them to simmer for about 5 minutes. I uncovered them and continued cooking them until they turned a beautiful brown. Add the meat back in and cover with 2 cups of chicken broth and simmer for about 20-30 minutes. Right before I was ready to serve them, I removed the meat and onions, made a gravy with the liquid, put the meat and onion back in and after it all thickened up, I served it over white rice. YUM, YUM, YUM!!!
Thanks for the recipe.

Removed the pork chops and carmelized onion and added a bit of beef boullion to the water, plus some cornstarch, and brought it to a boil - thickened up nicely and made a great sauce to drizzle over the chops.  Used salt & red pepper to coat chops and season onions.  This one's a keeper!

Soooo easy and so delicious.  My husband, who says he doesn't like pork chops, really loved this dish.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and used a little more onion (1 and 1/2 onions)as well as the advice to remove the chops after 40 minutes and then carmalizing the onions with a bit of sugar.  I turned the heat up to speed up the carmalization.  I will be using this recipe often and may try different herbs with it and also will try the suggestion of apple juice in place of water. I love recipes that are easy to try variations. I use many great recipes from this site and this one is a big winner with me.

what a nice change from oven baked pork chops!  i tood the advice from many of the reviewers and doubled the onion and used chicken broth instead of water.  in addition i added some sliced red peppers for flavor and color.  i also took the advice of taking the chops out of the pan after they have seared and returning them after the onions had carmelized.  
my husband and my father both loved this dish.

Although I followed previous reviewers' suggestions to decrease the salt and pepper (I decreased the seasoning salt to 2 tsp. and decreased the pepper to 1 tsp.), it was still very salty and peppery for both my husband and myself.  Otherwise I think it would have been a tasty dinner, but unfortunately the the saltiness and overwhelming pepper bite ruined it.  I uncovered the pan in Step 3 as others suggested.

This is a bood basic recipe made two changes.  First I chopped 6 slices of bacon and browned in skillet (and removed)Season pork chops w/Lawry's and pepper and place in bacon grease. Cook and brown on each side, remove chops to a plate and add onions and bacon until golden.  Return chops to pan, cover and cook for another 15-20 min on med/low.  I didn't have to add the water but you can do so, just a little at a time.  Before finishing turn chops twice in the pan to get the good carmel color.  They were very very moist and had great flavor.

Absolutely Awesome!  I followed some of the other reviewers and toned down the salt and pepper.  Removed pork from pan and carmelized onions with a teaspoon of sugar. Returned pork, covered and simmered with a cup of beef bouillion broth.  I didn't allow the liquid to evaporate completely, instead added a cornstarch/water mixture to thicken and served over mashed potatoes. So GOOD!  Will definately make again!

These are really good, but you have to be very careful not to get too peppery.  Also, the first time I cooked these, they took FOREVER! The second time, I cooked them at a little higher temperature, and uncovered them for part of the cooking time; they were faster, but not as tender.  Oh well, they taste good enough that I'll try to find the perfect combo of temp and time! Overall very good.

Awesome. Simple. Quick. Delicious. This is the way I have always made pork chop. Suggestion: Add some soy sauce or oyster sauce for taste and colour.

After reading the other reviews, I only added enough salt and pepper to lightly coat each side of the pork chops.  After browning the meat, I just let it simmer in the onion mixture for about 45 minutes.  It turned out absolutely WONDERFUL.  I am NOT a pork chop fan, but I will definitely make this recipe again.  These pork chops take a bit of time (not possible during the work week for me) but it's a "thumb's up" for the weekend!

This is a great basic recipe. I took the advice from some of the other reviewers and took the chops out after browning them (mine were the thin-cut chops, so the cooking time was reduced). I first carmelized the onions (using a bit of sugar) then added about a cup and a half of beef broth (in place of the water) and some cornstarch to create a gravy. However, I also added about a quarter cup of brown sugar to broth/onions mixture, then returned the chops to the pan and simmered it all together (with the cover on) for about 30 minutes. Fantastic basic recipe. I served it with mashed potatoes. Thanks!

As the recipe is...it's 3 stars max; but the way I doctored it up...it was like 10 stars!  I used a pork rub to season before I browned the pork....then removed the chops once browned and sauteed the onions (2 yellow onions thinly sliced) with 1 tsp of sugar.  Then added the pork back and added 1 cup of apple juice instead of water.  Then followed the recipe.  It was amazing!  It was the first time I've made pork chops and actually wanted more than one!  My husband ate 3!

Awesome Chops!  I substituted chicken broth for the water and they were so tasty & moist.  My onions were small so I used 3 and I would probably do 4 next time.  Thanks for the great recipe:)

My husband and I greatly enjoyed this recipe.  I used 1 inch center cut loin chops sprinkled with cajun seasoning.  I also added a pinch of sugar to the water because my onions were really strong.  As several other reviwers noted, cooking the chops uncovered in step three allows the liquid to reduce and the onions to caramelize.

Fabulous and easy!  I added fresh garlic while I was browning and reduced the amount of salt. As others have said, I too took off the lid for the remaining time and it took about 25 minutes.  Served with buttery mashed potatoes and fresh string beans - yummy!  Highly recommend!

Very tender - my husband loved it.  I rubbed Montreal Grill Seasoning on pork loins and subsituted chicken stock for water.  Also, I always brine pork and chicken before cooking. (brine is equal portions salt and surgar in water - brine for 30 min only)

I thought this recipes was INCREDIBLE...with a few modifications. I added two cloves of garlic to the oil when I browned the chops, and I also seasoned them with the salt/pepper and floured them slightly before browning. I, too, used beef broth in place of the water, and 2 T. of cornstarch REALLY helps thicken the sauce. In addition, I brushed one side of the chops with a thin coating of Korean hot pepper paste as I was browning them (adds a great kick!). Took about 45 minutes for 6 - 1/2" thick cuts after adding the onion, covering the pot, and simmering.

I sprinkled less seasoning than the recipe, and added fresh garlic to the oil. My picky son ate a whole chop, then later ate another! The onions and broth went great with potatoes. Too bad there were none left for lunch the next day!

Really easy recipe! I'm usually a shake and bake fan but this is sooo much better! Practically fool proof. And I read some of the reviews suggesting to leave it uncovered, which I did, cooking time was faster even :) thanks for the tips

This dish is on of the best pork chop dishes I have had in a long time. I'm the only one in my family that likes onion so I only used half of it. Will use the whole thing next time just for me. Lol it was wonderful. I did however add about 6 dashes of whatsthishere sauce for a bit of added flavor. Very yummy and will definitely make again.

Wow, I was very impressed by these pork chops!  At first it doesn't seem like it was going to work out, I was a little leary of the water (I did start out only using 1/2 cup, then added more when it evaporated.  I also left the pan uncovered).  In the end, the onions, pork and water made a lovely brown, flavorful sauce.  I didn't use all the salt and pepper, just sprinkled it on both sides.  My pork chops were super thick too, (about an inch thick) and they remained tender.  Served this with Harvest Rice Dish from this site.  A wonderful meal!

I found it to be so salty. The onions were not so much carmelized as they were mushy after having boiled in the pan of water for 30 minutes.  I cut the salt by 1 tsp and the water by 1/4 cup and also left the lid off the pan for step three. If you enjoy eating salt straight from the salt sellar this could be the recipe for you. Otherwise, steer clear!

Followed the recipe and it came out exactly as pictured, which is all I can ask for right? But I was still so proud of the way the pork turned out from this that I wanted to shout it from the rooftops! I was terribly afraid I was overcooking the pork and that it was going to be tough, especially because I use on sale meat which is usually tougher and less fatty anyway. However, the pork came out fork tender and juicy. I'm actually going to make it for a friend of the family this Christmas, who hasn't had pork in a long time because he has trouble eating tough meat! Now a small word about the onions. I did take the meat out of the pan to let the onions finish cooking down, just so they'd get that lovely brown and I did use two onions because I like them with a sprinkle of sugar on top, but I didn't think that altered the recipe enough to constitute posting a new recipe for it instead of a review. And as wonderful as the pork and onions were, I was serving it with some mashed potatoes so I did make a gravy from the pork and onion fond(?), with some chicken broth and a bit of flour. It came out lovely. I really do recommend this recipe for pork lovers to try! Thanks so much!

Defintely too salty, and I used only 1 tsp of seasoning salt.  To lower the fat, I just used a  vegetable oil spray in the pan and the chops were very tender!  Next time I would use 2 large onions and 1 tsp regular salt.

Very tender and would have been wonderful if I had used less salt than called for.  Next time I will only use a maximum of 2 tsp of salt and add an extra onion.  The onions were wonderful!!  Also, as others have stated the last cooking time should be UN-covered so that the liquid can evaporate.  I realized this after cooking for about 10 minutes covered.  I removed the lid at that time and it turned out beautifully.  Great presentation, very tender and delicious!

These have potential - but I do agree with others that it is way too salty.  I even cut down because I did read the other reviews.  My pork chops were also dry (pretty much boiled for 30 minutes so I'm not surprised).  I didn't have enough liquid for a gravy (because it boils down in the second step) so I just spooned the onions and sauce over the meat but there wasn't enough for potatoes.  Perhaps for me I need a change in the cooking method - I do like the idea of carmelized onions over top, but I think next time I'll just fry the chops and prepare the onions separate.  Thanks for the recipe!

These chops came out amazingly tender and juicy; I didn't even need a knife to cut them, just a fork. I used chicken broth instead of water, stirred in a dash of brown sugar to the onions, and used extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I agree with other reviewers that the second simmer needs to be with the lid off. Also, 20 mins may be a bit much on the second time around, but it surely didn't hurt them any! Hands down the best pork chops I've ever had...ever.

Easy, easy, easy which is what I LOVED about this recipe (I'm too busy enjoying this weather to cook)!  Well my suggestions would be to saute the onions in the oil, or even use butter, before adding the chops.  I also used garlic herb Mrs. Dash instead of the seasoned salt and then cut the pepper in half on the kids' portions.  I tried this with chicken broth and made a pretty decent gravy.  Chops were tender, and although the onions never caramelized they were very tasty (I used a vidalia), but as another reviewer mentioned, one onion is not enough unless it is very large.  I will make this again, thanks Pamela!

This was tasty.  I used creole seasoning instead of seasoned salt and it gave it a good kick.
I think that in number 3 there is an error. It should read:
UNCOVER and cook until water evaporates

My pork chops were thicker & I made 5 so I used 2 onions. I seasoned w/lawry's & pepper but did not use anywhere near what this recipe calls for. I followed the advice from other reviewers by sprinkling the onions w/sugar & NOT covering. Absolutely fantastic!! The onions MAKE this dish! This is easily a 5+ star dish w/a couple changes!! From start to finish, these took 30 min.

I took the advice of some of the others and used less salt/pepper and left the skillet uncovered for the second simmer.  After I took the pork and onions out I made a bit of pan sauce with approximately 1/2 cup of white wine, 2 tablespoons of dijon mustard, 1 tablespoon of milk (didn't have any cream) and some garlic.  I didn't measure it out though so it may need to be adjusted to taste.  It didn't make much but a little went a long way and it went great with the pork!

These were very good. I have to agree with many of the others here though, the onions were not truly carmelized. I coursely ground fresh pepper onto the chops and sprinkled on a fraction of the seasoned salt that the recipe called for rather than risking too much spice. I cooked them according to the directions for the first part but left the lid off after turning the chops. There is no way for the water to evaporate if the lid is on the pan. Next time, I will use, at most, 1/2 cup water. Regardless, simple and delicious. The chops are tender and flavorful.

This was a last minute idea, and I used 1/2 cup of white wine and 1/2 cup water, two onions and added garlic powder with the salt and pepper mix.  The chops were done on time, the water/wine evaporated, the onions carmelized, and we all thought they were pretty tasty!  I would make this again.

I'm so glad I read the reviews of others. Being a "new cook" they were of great help. The recipe is a great one that I will definitely do again & again! Easy but it does take longer than stated. I used less seasoning as others suggested & also used beef broth instead of water as well as 2 onions. I left lid on for first 30 minutes & then left lid ascew for what was last 35+ minutes to help keep chops REALLY moist & stewed but helped allow liquid to cook off a bit faster. Served with garlic mashed potatos & cashew green beans! GREAT MEAL for a beginner...my husband's words!! Thanks Pamela for receipe and gang for comments!!

I normally hate pork chops but this was WONDERFUL.  I've cooked it twice and i tried chicken broth once and beef broth the other, both are great.  I also used Tony Chachere's Cajun  Seasoning Orginial which made it a bit salty but then I bought some without salt and OMG it was good.  Leave a bit of juice and pour over some mashed potatoes.  MMMMMmmm  Good! We eat this weekly now.

In lieu of water,I used 1/2 c. reduced-sodium chicken broth and 1/2 c. apple juice and although I had to use flour/cornstarch to thicken the gravy, it was very tasty! (I would not add the apple juice next time as it was a bit too sweet for me). I let my thick chops simmer with the onions and removed the chops when they were done and left them warming in the oven while I carmelized the onions in another pan. Worked beautifully. Next time I make this, as suggested by many other reviewers, I will add some extra onion. My boyfriend gobbled up this dinner, which I made with some sour cream and chive mashed potatoes. Great recipe, but the key is really to season the chops before you begin simmering them. The whole house smelled wonderful!

I make this pork chop recipe with a little changing.  I lightly brown the chops, add the onion & lightly brown.  Then I add the water, simmering with lid on and I also squirt ketchup over each chop, simmer on low with the lid on adding water and ketchup when necessary.  I cook it until the chops are fork tender and the onions are nearly cooked away.  The ketchup, water and onion mixture makes a nice gravy to drizzle on top of buttered/parsley potatoes.

This has become one of our standard recipes with a few additions. I use regular sea salt and fresh ground black pepper instead of season salt and I also add dry thyme leaves, about 1tsp or so and some whole grain mustard when adding the water. Makes a wonderful gravy! I also saute the onions till they are soft and starting to color before I add the pork chops--that also really adds to the flavor.

This is a delicious, quick and easy recipe!  I did use beef stock instead of water and I add plenty of extra onions.  I did not cook it as long as called.  I simmered them for 15-20 minutes then removed the chops and added some cornstarh mixed with water to thicken the sauce.  My family went crazy!!!  Thanks

These were so delicious. I'm not generally a fan of pork chops, but I followed previous reviewers instructions and sugared the onions after removing the pork. Which a difference it made to the appearance! 

Boyfriend gobbled them up before I'd even finished laying the rest of the meal on the table!

The method to this recipe is amazing! My husband and I love black pepper, but I must say that I will reduce the amount of pepper I use next time.  I didn't have seasoning salt so I made my own: 3T Kosher salt 1T Paprika 1T Celery Salt 2t Garlic Powder 1t Onion Powder or crushed dry onion 1/2t Cayanne Mix together, and store in sealed container.  This recipe opened my eyes again to the world of pork, thanks so much!! I will definitely make this again and again.

What I love most about this recipe is all the ingredients are in the house all the time and it's SO easy to make! I had to add flour to the liquid to thicken it up in order to serve, however my husband requested that I make more sauce next time in order to have more to serve over the potatoes. So next time I think I will use a roux (or just flour) and more onions and water to make it into a gravy sauce.

This turned out pretty good. I would recommend taking it easy on the pepper, however. I accidentally added too much which affected the end result. (My fault.)

My family enjoyed this recipes and I made a few minor changes.  I used less salt and pepper and added a package of onion soup mix when I added the onions and covered.  It was a hit!!!!

This was a nice and easy recipe. I did add 1/2 packet of onion soup mix as one reviewer recommended. I also only used 3/4 C water and added a 1/2 tsp of cornstarch at the end to thicken the sauce. I also added about 1/2 lb of mushrooms. I served it over rice.

We used beef broth instead of water and less salt. This was a hit - my husband told me to keep the recipe and begged to eat the last piece. It's easy too!

Delicious and easy - my chops were only about l/4" so I just browned them, then followed directions for the first 20 min of carmelizing.  The chops were done by then so I kept them warm and followed what others did by not covering the pan, adding some sugar and carmelizing them more quickly that way.  Will make again.

I think people are missing the point with this recipe.  Don't pull the pork chops out and let the onions carmelize; Leave them in until the liquid is evaporated(it takes much longer than the recipe calls for).  The pork chops will seem dry at first, but when you leave them in long enough with the liquid, they become stewed and practically fall off the bone.  Definetly double the onions, and don't cut them too thin.  This recipe was wonderful if you do it right!

Wow.... waaaay too salty for us.  The pepper adds a bit of a bite, but the overwhelming salt really overpowers any flavor the meat would've had.

Good recipe, but after a few tries, I've altered it: Preheat the pan on high. Only rub some brown sugar on the chops, no salt or pepper. Brown chops  quickly on both sides. Add 1 cup apple cider or juice with the onions. Cook for about 20 minutes uncovered.

My husband loved this and would give it a five.  I thought it was very good and easy, but can't quite give it a five.  I reduced the amount of salt and pepper and put some beef bullion in the water.

We were not pleased with this recipe at all.  The pork ended up tough and salty...I don't know what I was thinking even trying this...it's basically boiled pork chops!  The onions were not caramelized...they were boiled!  Will not even attempt to make this with changes.  Sorry.

Okay, so there was some extra water that had to evaporate, but it's really not that big of a deal.  Basically it's a good recipe, just experiment with it depending on your taste.  I added a few cloves of minced garlic (love it), some seasonings, and another onion and my husband and I enjoyed it and it wasn't dry--a problem I tend to have.  Give it a chance-it's yummy.

Well, what can I say?  It was nothing fantastic.  I used half apple juice and half chicken broth instead of water, and as noted by other reviewers, the liquid took forever to evaporate.  So instead of running the risk of having cork-like chops, I removed them, took the lid off to reduce the liquid.  In the end, it was *alright*, but there wasn't much pay-off considering the cooking time (about an hour) and all the fuss.

Being new to this site, I did not think to read the reviews before trying out this recipe. I wish that I had though because the suggestions all sound wonderful, but as it stands the actual recipe itself isn't that good at all.

My mother used to make pork chops like this only she always used  juice for the liquid (from canned pears or peaches, or apple juice).  I have continued the tradition. They are delicious! I think thin cut chops work best.

I changed things up a little bit. I dredged the pork in seasoned flour. (Seasoning Salt, Black Pepper and Smoked Paprika)  Instead of water, I added a 10 oz can of chicken broth and 1/4 c. of Cognac.  (White wine would have worked well also) I let the broth come to a slow boil and then simmered them with no lid. I had 8 Boneless Pork Chops and used 3 onions. This was a great idea and have no doubt that the original idea would have been great. Thought it only fair I too add my additions.

This was a delicious easy to make dish. I used low sodium season all and didn't measure, just shook on what I thought it needed. I used a Texas sweet onion. I forgot to add the extra salt and pepper after turning these and glad I didn't as it didn't need it. The carmelized onions were wonderful and made this dish really flavorful. This took about an hour to make from start to finish. Thanks for the great dinner!

This cooking time is much too long.  Overcooked my 1 inch thick chops.  For pork to be tasty it needs to be 145 degrees.  Next time will decrease the time and it should be better.

MOIST - EASY & YUMMY !!!  Since reviewers stated the water did not evaporate enough - I was ready with a TABLESPOON of Cornstarch mixed with some flat cola to thicken up the liquid.  I thought the spice rub too peppery for my taste - but my fiance' loved it!!  I will use this recipe again trying various spices to jazz it up a bit.

Very good with some changes. :)  I used 1 1/2 onions, also added some mushrooms that needed to be used up.  I seared the pork chops, removed them, cooked down the onions and then added the pork chops back w/ water and a beef buillion cube.  There was a lot of liquid and it didn't seem to be evaporating and my pork chops were done.  So I removed the pork chops and thickened up the sauce.  It was delicious!  It was like an onion gravy.

The first time I tried this I stuck to the recipe and it was just ok, the recipe sat for over a year until I tried it again. This time it was excellent....!!!! I did make a few changes, I browned my onions slightly with a pinch of salt and pepper and instead of water I used a 1/2 cup of Pepsi and kept it covered for about 20mins on a low heat. I uncovered to let the liquid reduce I served with whole grain rice that I made with chicken broth and mixed veggies. I will absolutely make this again.

Awesome recipe! I adjusted the recipe to include a fresh sliced mushrooms, tony's (cajun) seasoning instead of season salt, and a few splashes of worcesthire sauce. Oh and a very light dusting of brown sugar about four or five minutes before serving. Everyone loved this dish...kidos included.

Followed the other reviews and carmelized the onions first, replaced water with beef broth to make gravy and cut way back on the salt. The whole family loved it.

This was pretty tasty. I did follow some of the other reviews & removed the chops so that the onions carmelized better. I will make again.

Delicious, whole family loved it from pre-school to teen to adult ! Did follow others recommendations on removing chops while caramelizing onions. And used 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup apple juice and left lid off for last 15- 20 mins.

Good, but "caramelized onions" are actually something very specific, this is just nice grilled onions. Rather basic recipe - good for a jumping off point

I made this recipe almost as written, with the only change being to substitute low sodium chicken broth for the water. It turned out beautiful - very easy preparation, and extremely tasty. The chops were tender and the onions were delicious! With our hectic work schedules, we are always looking for new ways to prepare quick weekday meals. This one is a keeper!

DELICIOUS!! I made a few changes :) I lightly floured and salted the chicken and browned in oil. Then thinly sliced onion and covered chicken with the onions and added 1 cup apple juice and a pinch of sugar.  Let the chicken and onions cook with lid on for about 20 minutes.  Then, take lid off and let simmer uncovered for another 20-30 minutes or until onions are caramelized!

I have to give this just two stars as it is written because the amount of salt was so very excessive.  It really ruined the meal for me and I did cut it back as it was based on other reviewers recommendations.    Next time, I would go with 1 tsp of season salt, half a teaspoon of pepper for 6 (4 ounces each0 pork loins.  That is less than a third of the seasoning the original receipe calls for!  That is how salty it was as to me!  and this is coming from someone who loves salt!

I am usually terrible at making pork chops, they come out dry, but these came out great.  My husband who does not usually like pork chops liked these, too.  Unfortunately, the kids wouldn't touch them, even without the onions.  I made the changes suggested by the other reviewers - added a little sugar to help carmelize the onions and removed the pork chops to not overcook them.  I also added a little chicken bouillion to the water for flavor, would like to try apple juice next time.

This was sooo gooood. I am the only one in my family that likes onions but they loved the taste of the pork. I thickened the juice into a gravy and served over mashed potatoes. My son poured the gravy over everything, loved it.  I did not use all of the seasoning as it seemed to be too much. Very good recipe. will surely make again.

Was in a hurry to find new recipe one night but didnt have an onion so I used lipton onion soup mix. To my suprise turned out great! Browned the chops like recipe said and added water and soup mix when they were done I thickened up the remaining soup/water with flour and it made an awsome gravy my husband said it was the best pork he ever ate.

Very good recipe. I made two changes,Made the water apple juice and I added two apples to the mix and cooked them down to make a great apple onion sauce to cover chops on the plate. We loved it.I'll be making this again and again. Thank you for sharing.

This meal is delicious but I altered the recipe a little. After simmering for 20 mins I flipped the chops and seasoned the other side of each. But instead of waiting for the water to evaporate, I uncovered the chops, cooked for an additional 15-20 minutes. Then I removed the pork from the skillet, leaving the onions and remaining water, and put them in a hot plate to keep warm. I raised the heat to med-low and added 1 1/2 tsp of sugar to the remaining onions and water (the sugar cuts back some of the saltyness and turns the water into a glaze-like substance. Continue cooking glaze for a couple of minutes or until reached desired consistancy. Spoon glaze unto chops and serve.

I really enjoyed the ease of this recipe. It hit the spot. I used McCormic's Steak seasoning on both sides of the chops and then cooked as directed. It turned out wonderful. I didn't even need a knife to cut the chops with they were that tender. I made a gravy out of the juice and onions and it was a big hit! I am definitely going to be making this a regular dish at my house. Thanks for sharing.

I made this recipe and it wasn't the best but it was ok. I substituted apple juice for the water. It made the meat nice and tender and it was a little sweet. I don't think I will make it again since I don't like pork.

Excellent flavor combo with the pork & onions.  The meat comes out very tender.  I took past reviews' advice and cut back on the salt & pepper.  I also added beef bouillon to the water to simmer.   Also, after the meat finished simmering, I removed the meat and and most of the liquid and reserved it, then caramelized the onion by adding 1 tsp. sugar to the pan and cooked the onions with the sugar for about 5 minutes.  Then I added a small amount of corn starch to the reserved liquid and put it all back together.  Yummy!

If you make the recipe as written, you will have to take the pork chops out to boil down the liquid and carmelize the onions.  I did as others suggested and took the cover off for the final simmer, and my pork chops were pretty dry.  I used Penzey's 4S seasoning salt and they were pretty tasty without any additional spices.

I made this in the crockpot.  I cut the liquid amount significantly and added beef bouillon ("better than bouillon" brand)and a drop of soy sauce, a drop of worcestershire sauce, and two cloves of garlic.  I did not add salt since soy sauce is salty. I added mushrooms to make it look more sophisticated.  I served it with wild rice and asparagus.  The rice wentperfectly with the chops but the asparagus didnt seem to compliment the meal too well.

excellent recipe!  pork is moist and very flavorful.  I used Mrs. Dash for the seasoning salt.  We tried this recipe a second time with mushrooms and white wine instead of onions and water- also turned out well.

As most reviewers noted, this is a good basic recipe.  The technique DOES need tweeking.  Add more onions, less liquid and finish evaporation of liquid with lid off.  I used garlic and added apple slices at the end of cooking process.  They should soften, but not disintegrate.  Use a firm apple,e.g., Granny Smith.  If you want, you can add crumbled sage leaves to taste with appple slices. (Go light on sage, it's a strong herb.)

I was a bit disappointed in this, insofar as it seemed to take forever for the water to cook down, and by the time it did, my onions were mushy.  I just didn't really care for the flavor at all, but my husband did.

Well, I thought this was a good recipe.  As some reviewers suggested, I browned the chops, removed them from pan, and then carmelized the onions with some butter and brown sugar, then replaced chops to pan and piled carmelized onions on top.  I simmered chops while I assembled the balance of dinner, and it was a very satisfying and tasty dinner.  Thank you for your recipe, Pamela!  I loved it.

I was hesitant to try this recipe after reading some reviews calling it "bland," but I want to assure you all that it is anything but!  My husband said they were the best pork chops he's ever eaten.  I did dissolve a cube of chicken boullion into the water and added about 1/2 teaspoon of beef boullion to the water also.  When I added the thinly sliced onions I tried to make sure they were on the bottom of the pan, under the pork.  Delicious!  Perfect for a very low-carb main dish.  Also, I just sprinkled the chops with seasoning salt, pepper and garlic powder on both sides - I didn't measure the seasonings.

My family absolutely loved this recipe.  My 4 year old daughter is a very picky eater and refuses to eat most everything.  I prepared these pork chops for dinner last night and she ate 3 of them.  She even came back a couple of hours later wanting more.  Gotta give this one 5 stars.

This was pretty great, but a bit spicy.  I would reduce the pepper.  Followed other review recommendations (substituted chicken broth for water, more onion, carmelized onions).  Made sauce into gravy and served over garlic mashed potatoes.

I really like this recipe, but I actually prefer to, as others have done, double the onions, and after the pork chops are done, remove them, then caramelize the onions with a bit of brown sugar. I also throw in a splash of vinegar at the end to give them a little more flavor. Turns out great, though!

This was yummy!  I followed as directed, the only thing I might change is to use 1 LG onion or 2 small, I only had 1 small and it wasn't enough to put over the pork chops when they were done.  This tastes great and very easy to prepare, plus my husband loved it!  I will certainly make it again!  =)

excellent !!!!! I was afraid to make this because my hubby doesn't like pork very much. He LOVED it. I took the advice of others and added a small amount of salt & pepper but I did add cajun spice seasoning instead of seasoned salt. This gave it a zippy taste. Also I added 1/4 cup more of water finished the simmering for 40 minutes, uncovered. I had a good deal of broth left which I made a flour & water paste added it to the broth to thicken. I also added a bit of gravy master to the gravy to add a little color. Spooned over chops and mashed potatoes. Nothing is left. MMMM GOOD.

this was definitley supposed to be lid off for the last simmer. There is no way that all of that water would evaporate otherwise. It comes out perfect with lid off about 10 minutes.

This is a great recipe!  For the seasoning salt I used Old Bay Spice.  My husband was 2 hours late getting home from work so I just let the chops and onions simmer on low with the lid off.  By the time we got around to eating the onions were carmelized to prefection and the chops were very tender.  My husband asked that I keep the recipe and make again.  I would reccommend for anyone making this recipe to simmer for atleast and hour or two!

absolutely delicious. I used chicken broth instead of water based on other peoples reviews and cooked it without a lid. I don't care much for pork chops but this recipe has changed my opinion.

These were delicious and moist!  I do agree that after the meat is tender and cooked thru I suggest taking the meat out and leaving the lid off while the liquid cooks down. When I first put the onions in to saute before the water went it I added about 5 strips of pre-cooked bacon to saute with them, because they were already cooked it added a lot of flavor without added a bunch of extra grease to the pan. After the meat was done cooking I did go a step further because I love a good pan sauce and added about a Tblspn of dijon and some parsley and time while the water  was cooking down and oh man that sauce was yummy.  I have no doubt it was great without the add ins but those just kicked it up a notch.  I will definitely be making this again....the family gave a thumbs up for sure.

Overall the dish was very very good. However, my knowledge of carmelized onion, which may be limited, is that carmelized onions are cooked separately basically fried at is slow low temperature for several minutes. These however, in the recipe, are I guess you might say kind of boiled. That was the only disappointment other than that , family enjoyed  them. v

This recipe as written is guaranteed to result in badly overcooked pork chops. I'm not sure if there's a way to make it work.  But the pork chops should be taken out of the pan as soon as they are tender, which would probably be only 5-10 minutes of simmering with the water and onions. Maybe trying using half the water, taking the porkchops out when they're done, and then uncovering and turning the heat way up to caramelize the onions while the pork chops cool while set aside. That might salvage it, but I won't be using this recipe again.

I seared the chops first, as suggested by many other reviewers, then took them out and set them aside while I started cooking the onions. Then I added the chops back along with the 1 cup of liquid (I used chicken broth rather than water) and cooked for 10 minutes more uncovered. The chops came out very, very tough and dry. I think they would have been even more overcooked had I left the chops in the pan the whole time. The onions were good, but I think that was due to the fact that I cooked them a bit before adding the liquid. I think caramelizing some onions and piling them on pan seared chops would give a better result!

Made this last night and it was very good and easy.  Use a large onion... the more the better.  I suggest that you use a bit less water and REMOVE the cover after 20 min.  The recipe suggests you cover the second half until the water evaporates but if you cover there is nowhere for the water to go.  Will definitely make this again.

Delicious and oh so easy!  My husband who isn't a pork fan raved about how good this is, and it will be my new go-to pork chop recipe. I halved the recipe and cut the salt to 1/2 tsp which I sprinkled on rather than rubbed - not so messy. Once the water had evaporated to about 1 cup I added 1 tsp cornstarch and 1/2 tsp garlic powder, as others suggested, and whisked it with a miniature whisk to make a gravy. I was able to do this around the chops so no need to remove them. It was fantastic served over a grain mixture! I agree with other reviewers about using more onion and will double them next time. Thank you Pamela for sharing an excellent recipe!

I haven't tried this recipe but it's very similar to how I make my Pork Chops. I brown the chops first and remove them then put in onions, after they start to get soft I put the chops on top and add 1 envelope of Onion Soup mix and cover with water and let simmer for about 20 minutes. It makes a great gravy over mashed potatoes!

This was a huge hit! The only changes I made was to replace the water with beef bullion and increased the onions.  Otherwise.....followed everything.  The pork was so flavor able and moist! We cooked ours in a cast iron skillet to really get the brown and caramelized onions going.  This is definitely a keeper!!!

overall pretty good, and certainly easy. followed other suggestions to remove chops and add sugar to better caramelize the onions on their own. then put the chops back to simmer for roughly 30 minutes. then added corn starch to thicken the sauce. removed lid after 10 min because it wasn't reducing or thickening. eventually gave up on "gravy" but flavor was fantastic and we just poured the onions and sauce on top of the chops.

it was great! a keeper!  i would reduce the 1cup water to 2/3 or 1/2 cup as it took a lot longer than expected to "reduce" the liquid.  otherwise it's a winner!  my husband loved it and it smelled great when you walk in the door!  i used thin chops and they were so moist!

I made this with two large bone in pork chops, so adjusted the salt and pepper amounts.  After reading some of the reviews, I removed the chops after searing and doubled the onion adding a pinch of brown sugar and used homemade beef broth instead of water.  These turned out very enjoyable; served with buttered parsley potatoes and green beans.  Thanks for sharing a keeper for us, Pamela Newland.

I had two pork chops and an onion so I made this for lunch - fantastic! I did as others suggested and used chicken broth in place of the water and kept the lid off the pan during the second part of cooking, and they turned out great! I will be making this again soon.

I am making this for the second time.  This is delish and easy too!  I love the fact that it needs so few ingredients.  This is a keeper for sure.

This dish was great except by using seasoning salt it was way too salty.  Since I don't like much salt to begin with I would definitely make this again but using herbs and other spices that would give the flavor without the huge amount of salt.

Excellent, easy, and quick.  It's been a hit ever since I first tried it!  My husband and my kids (ages 5 and 3) love these pork chops and I love making them.

4.5 Stars: I used pork loin chops and thought these were very good.  I did not measure my seasoned salt and will keep a better eye on that next time. The onions were delicious.

Onions never caramelized even after an hour. Chops were tender but bland.

As an amateur wine maker I always have something on the shelf so instead of the water I used home made Muscadine wine and as others mentioned did the second phase with the cover off. Gave it a 5star would have been 10 if I could. First time I have been compelled to write a review.

Tasted good, but I made ten chops with two cups of water.  I grew impatient waiting for the water to boil down and caramelize the onions - so I thickened the water with some cornstarch/water and made a gravy.  I had took the advice of others and added beef boullion into the water, which helped flavor the gravy.  I think the caramelized onions would have been delish but I had hungry family members!

Yum. Similar to one that my mother in law makes. Did a few things different... Used olive oil instead of veg (of course). Double the amount of onion. Used wine instead of water to deglaze the pan. Also sprinkled a T or so of flour in the deglazing process to make the onion more of a gravy. I cooked the chops and onion separately (used same pan) and then after deglazing, put them back together in the pan with the lid on to simmer for 15 minutes. Could actually simmer longer for more tender meat - or put into casserole dish & put in oven for 30m.

I never really cook pork chops, but this recipe looked easy enough for a novice such as myself.  Delicious!  I made a few small changes for taste.  Instead of veggie oil, I used extra virgin olive oil.  Also, I used beef stock in lieu of water, added some mushrooms and kale towards the end of the simmer.  We also like spice in our house, so I threw in a touch of cayenne.  Threw over wild rice and used the juice as gravy.  will definitely make these again.

I love this recipe as is! But it's also wide open for artistic changes. So versatile but I seem to go back to how it was written although I do add a bit more onion, nothing better (almost) than caramelized onion.

Wonderful recipe!!!  Great flavor and very moist!  I'm not sure why, but the water never really evaporated for me (I checked...and I did add the correct amount).  Regardless, they still turned out great - maybe next time I won't put the full amount of water in.

Probably the easiest meal I have ever made.  I uncovering during the third step for about 15 minutes then removed the chops and boiled to reduce the liquid even more.  I also added parsley and rosemary to give it another layer of flavor.  Next time I would add a second onion.  Serve it over rice and it makes a quick, tasty meal.

this was really good except for the amount of salt. also, i browned the pork chops, removed them from the pan and carmalized the onions for a few then added the pork chops and 1cup of chicken stock instead of water back to the pan and simmered for 20 mins coverd. then i took the lid off the pan and reduced the liquid till it was a nice sauce. the chops were nice and tender and the sauce was so yummy with potatoes!!

I am honestly not a very big fan of pork. However, this was so good! I simmered the chops in one cup of chicken broth instead of water and added some sugar to the onions in the last 10 minutes. It turned out absolutely delicious! My picky husband even loved it! I will definitely make this over and over again!

Okay here goes. They were freaking awesome....I'm a pepper guy so I didn't use all of the salt they asked for but just enough to cover the chops and then pepper them. I removed the lid the second simmer but I think the 20 minutes was a bit to much. They were good but maybe a bitwell done. I'll experiment the next time with about 15 for the second simmer. I removed the onions and mixed some water with corn starch then into the water and juices and the gravy turned out terrific. Had that bit of peppery kick to it that I like. Definitely will make again. I give it 4 stars because I think everything needs a bit improving......enjoy.

With all the cautions of it being to salty I initially didn't put that much salt. But while cooking, a dash of salt here a sprinkle there then simmering with a little white wine = a little on the salty side. It was still good. I added mushrooms. The meat was soft and it had good flavor. I never have any pork recipes but, this is a keeper. I just have to be careful with the salt next time.

This is absolutely to die for!  Of course we love onions.  It is even better in the slow cooker.  The meat just falls off the bones.  So simple but full of flavor.  I used beef/chicken broth instead of water.

Excellent chops, and very tender.  I recommend leaving lid off for second part as there is alot of liquid, unless you want to make a gravy as in previous reviews.  I didn't read about the brown sugar until after I made it.  I will try it next time.

I followed the recipe, except I uncovered after 20 minutes and turned the heat on high to boil off the water.  When 80% of the water was gone, I removed the meat and added 1 tbl brown sugar.  Stirred until water was gone and onions were light brown.  Added the meat back and warmed.  Absolutely delightful dish!

Very good. I used two onions and after removing the chops, discarded 1/2 the liquid. Also added,as suggested, sugar to the onions. Sprinkled with garlic powder and left uncovered to carmelize.  Will keep in my recipe box as a Goodie

The chops are so tender and flavorful. They hold well the next day if you have left overs. I do recommend cracking the lid when you are reducing the sauce. It will take too long if you do not.

Excellent flavor! I followed the suggestion of beef broth instead of water and it turned out great. I did use too much sugar (my fault!) but over all this was a great recipe and I will be using it again! Thanks!

This was fabulous!  Tender, tasty, and de-lish!  I did add onion and beef broth after removing the chops and onions to get a little extra juice to pour on top when I had put them on the platter.  Thank you so much for submitting this recipe!  SO EASY!!!

Instead of salt and pepper, I used TommyRay's Q Masters Dry Rub (Chicago area product) on both sides of two 1-inch boneless chops. From other reviewers, I added two garlic cloves sliced very thinly, three sliced baby bella mushrooms, and the onions. Browned the chops, removed them, then cooked the onions, etc., a bit. Added water and some white wine and put the chops in on top. Cooked about 40 minutes total,  removed the chops and onion mixture, then made a gravy with cornstarch and more water with the scrapings in the pan. Served with mashed potatoes. The chops were tender and delicious. Will make this again. Thanks for the basic idea.

All in all, it was pretty good. I followed the recipe, and left the cover off like the previous reviewer suggested, but the pork chops themselves turned out a bit plain on their own. I felt that the amount of water required was a little excessive as it might have overcooked if I waited for all the water to boil away. Also substituted the water for half apple juice: it sweetened the onions a bit more, and thickened the sauce slightly.

It was okay. I think we can make a better pork dish than this with 40 minutes though. A tad bland.

WOW! This is a new staple in my cook book. I used bone-in pork chops & chicken broth instead of water. I took the chops out after the 20 min. simmer and added corn starch to the onions to thicken it up. It was absolutely delicious. Even my toddler and 5 year old ate every bite!

This was really an EASY and Tasty dish, I used more chops to feed my greedy family of four and I sliced my chops a lil thinner than a half inch just a little, and I used two onions(we still wanted more onions) after browning the meat, I took it out then caramelized the onions then added some cornstarch to the pot with the onions stirred it, then I slowly added two cans of chicken broth stirring as it thickend some then I put the pork back in and let it simmer for about 20 mins. with the lid off, we ate it over white rice and I cooked cabbage too, the whole family loved it, I will be making this again and again, Thank you.

I make this dish all the time, but watch the seasoning VERY carefully as it often becomes too salty or too peppery, and requires extra water. I also add mushrooms and zucchini to the onions at the very beginning. It's best enjoyed over rice as my sauce is always watery at the end and does not go well with pasta.

Well, this was just great, even with the error in directions (you definitely should leave the dish uncovered for the second simmer).  I used chicken broth in place of water and omitted the salt.  We were so impressed--with garlic mashed potatoes these chops tasted like a dish in a nice restaurant!

This was easy to make, and its so yummy. I have made it twice. Once with spanish onion and once with a regular cooking onion. I feel the chops with the spanish onion were much better. However, I still would make this dish with cooking onions, if that's all I had on hand.

Changed a bit, used 1/2 envelope of onion soup mix and only 1/2 cup water.
Used only half of the pepper and no salt. At the end thickened with a little flour. Very good

The onion topping came out very tasty, though they did not turn out the way I would expect carmelized onions to turn out.  They were more like disintegrated onions.  I also used two onions, and when I first put them in the pan, I thought it was way too much.  But the onions shrunk (i.e. disintegrated) so much, there was hardly enough.

But I thought it tasted good.  I will try some of the other suggestions in the reviews and try again.

A 4 Star average is misleading for the recipe.  We didn't care for this at all.  It was a little bland, nothing special.  The leftovers didn't get eaten.  Won't make again.

These were great and very easy.  I used apple juice instead of the water and added 1 tsp. white sugar.  Left the lit off after adding the juice so the liquid could evaporate (took 20 minutes).  Will make again and again.

Well, I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I made minor changes that I thought would enhance the flavor to my preference.  So, my rating would be unfair because I didn't truly try this recipe.  I used about a 1/4 cup white cooking wine and 1/2 cup water - also added 2 cloves of garlic to onions.  I will not make this again.  I had a hard time getting the water to evaporate, it took longer than an hour.  It finally did but there wasn't any carmalized onion left..only mush.

I would use less seasoning salt and an additional onion. Cooking time took longer then stated. Thanks for the great recipe!!:)

Good recipe.  I'd read all the reviews and made many of the suggested changes.  For me, the water called for evaporated in time (25 minutes) and I added more to steam mushrooms on top.  Also sprinkled some chicken boullion crystals with water.  Next time I would add some wine in with the water as well.  For seasoning I used a mixture of Garlic Powder, Seasoned Salt, and Pepper in a shaker and dusted both sides as well as adding while reducing sauce.  Also next time I would reduce the sauce for a bit first before adding the onions (They became a bit soggy.)
All in all, a good recipe for something different to do with my usually grilled Pork Chops.  Served with Roasted Brussels Sprouts recipe from this site (Didn't love that one)
Thanks for the recipe, Pamela, and to everyone else for your tips and suggestions.

Nice and simple with good flavor. After I removed the chops and onion from the pan, I deglazed it with white wine and served the sauce over the pork chops & onions. It was very flavorful and dark brown. I think next time I'll do a half-n-half mixture of wine and chicken broth and reduce slightly to make more of a sauce.

I used 1 inch loin chops which I soaked for 6 hours in a brine consisting of 8 cups water, 3 bay leaves, few dashes red pepper flakes, 1/3 cup seasalt and tables of sugar. Used 2 onions - everthing else the same.  Took longer to cook than 40 minutes, but it was worth the wait. I too removed lid during step 3.  Oh, added one chicken bullion cube and cut salt way back - because of the salt water brine soak.  Thanks for submitting this one!

Very yummy but VERY SALTY!  I took the advice about using low-sodium chicken broth (which really added great flavor!), but I thought that the saltiness was too much for me.  Overall, the dish was great, but I will definitely cut back on the seasoned salt next time!

I thought these were way too salty and too much pepper.  Also, it took forever to evaporate all the water off the onions.  I finally took the chops out and turned the heat up to high.  One onion wasn't enough either.  Bottom line, I really didn't care for this recipe and won't make it again.

Very good ! after all the mention of too much salt i decided to omit it and use mrs. dash ...then salt to taste at the dinner table . there were many who mentioned adding less water and being confused about the simmering method , so as suggested i kept the lid on for 15 minutes and removed it for 15 minutes ( my chops were not thick )it was not terribly thick so i made a milk and cornstarch mixture to add to the liquid in the skillet , it worked ! also used garlic powder. no complaints here !! yummy !!

Excellent Recipe! Although I did cut the salt and pepper in half because it was way too salty the first time.  I also added some fresh crushed garlic. The whole family loved it and I will be making it often! Very easy to make!! Thanks for a wonderful recipe Pamela!!!

I followed this recipe to the tee, they weren't salty and my onions were not carmalized it was all so watery. It didn't taste bad, but it didn't taste good. I would give it a three and a half if I could, because it wasn't bad, but I was expecting so much more. Maybe it was just me, I encourge anyone to try it, it appears it was only me...

I actually used this recipe on deer meat (thinking I had defrosted pork chops, I had deer chops instead).  This was a very tasty dish!  I didn't find it too salty, I don't know if that is a difference between the types of meat or not.  I just lightly sprinkled seasoned salt and ground some pepper on each side.  The recipe didn't say what size onion to use, and next time, I would use more - a large onion or two medium onions.  The onion does cook down quite a bit.

I only used half the seasoning salt and the pork chops were still a little salty. I will make the dish again but with a few changes. Next time I will omit the seasoning salt and just rub the chops with good old salt & pepper.  I would also suggest simmering for at least an hour and using 2 onions.  The onions reduced so much there weren't enough to enjoy.

Very good but will definitely cut back on the salt and pepper next time.  I only used 2 tsp seasoned salt and 1 tsp pepper and it was still too peppery for the kids.  Otherwise, it was a very good meal.

I loved this dish. I made it last night and served it with mashed potatoes,  green beans and a salad. Since there are only 2 of us, I made half the recipe. The only thing I would change is to add more onions. They were delicious over the mashed potatoes. I will be making these again.

It seemed like it would take forever to simmer until all the water had evaporated. After another 20 minutes, I took it off the burner and served it.  Very good.

Would have given it 5 stars but recipe should have included making a pan gravy from that delicious pot liqueur.  I place a good sear on all sides , including the fat cap [ i used thick bone in loin chops] and once browned placed in a cold oven set to 275.  I caramelized the onions adding a teaspoon of sugar as others recommended then added 1.5 cups of stock and simmered the chops for 10 minutes which was ample to get them to 165.  Chops & onions returned to warm oven while some cornstarch & water thickened  the remaining stock to make a delicious gravy.  I simply cannot image the need or resulting texture of simmering 20 to 40 minutes.

If you keep the lid on in step 3 the pork chops over cook and the onions don’t cook down and carmelize. Instead, after step 2 is complete, remove the pork chops to a plate and cover with foil. Continue to cook the onions on high heat with no lid until carmelized.

I substituted the water for apple juice as another reviewed suggested, makes the onions sweet and a great combo with the pork chop.

This is a nice take on a simple-but-delicious main dish. I use organic butter instead of oil to brown the onions, then skooch them to the side of the pan when they are about half-done  and add the pork chops. Sweet onions such as Vidalias are good, but believe it or not, even very hot onions become sweet when you caramelize them. Add some sweet bell pepper slices with a little water a couple of minutes before you turn the chops and lower the heat just a bit to braise the chops and vegs. I turn up the heat again after turning the chops and I arrange the fully cooked onions and peppers on top as the chops finish browning on the bottom.
Sliced mushrooms are also a good addition. You can deglaze the pan and make a delicious gravy. I cut the water in half, added no salt. I also doubled (at least) the onions...we like a little pork with our onions!

1 Cup of water is wayyy too much for this recipe. Also this is not even remotely in the realm of how you caramelize onions. Looked it up after this didn't work, you need to brown the onions first and then deglaze the pan, but definitely not with a whole cup of water with only one onion.

It turned out pretty good. The pork chops cooked through a lot sooner than noted and I ended up with way too water in the end. I'm thinking 1/4 cup of water would be sufficient.

Very very good, nice and tender. Like most of the others here, I discovered that it is necessary to cook uncovered after the first 20 minutes in order for the liquid to evaporate. Even uncovered, the cooking time is considerably longer than the 45 minutes  estimated in the recipe. In humid conditions, it can be as long as 2 hours.

Despite how much water these are cooked in, they came out really dry. The water never fully evaporated, nor did the onions brown. Waiting for that to happen I think may have caused the chops to overcook. Perhaps they should have been uncovered a bit? My husband liked them anyway. But I won't make this again.

These are tender and delicious using the recipe as is. Sometimes I follow the suggestions of adding more onions and skewing the lid a little for the second simmer I remove the pork chops after searing and put them back in once the onions just start to soften, and sometimes remove the pork chops and add a little water and cornstarch mixture to make a delicious oniony gravy. They are delicious however you fix them. We like thinner pork chops in this recipe.

I make this all the time.  Instead of adding water I use  red wine.  Juice is delicious with Italian bread.

This was super easy and wonderful.  I made it in my electric skillet and bam! it was done!  I made it just as directed and wouldn't change a thing.  I served it with low cal roasted sweet potato bites and it was the perfect meal!

I often have trouble with dry pork chops, but these turned out tender and delicious. I also did the second simmer without the lid so the water would evaporate some.

I'm not a big pork chop fan but this was very simple to make and DELICIOUS. I did caramelize the onions before adding the water but this recipe is definitely a keeper!

Really yummy, even my picky 6-year old cleaned his plate! Took a lot longer than 20 minutes to caramelize the onion though (more like 45 min) and I would also recommend adding a second onion for more delicious flavor!

Husband thought the pork chops were a bit overcooked but I found it so easy to make and I don't find pork chops easy to cook. So for me it got 5 stars. Did add butter and cornstarch at the end to thicken the sauce.

I followed this recipe last night for dinner and it has to be the best pork chop I've ever made. 
However, 2 things: keep kid off for second simmer and use a lot more than just the 1 onion. 
Also, I added some sazón to the water and it worked perfectly! 
Happy cooking xoxo

My boyfriend and I loved it.  It was super tender.  After the flip i let it simmer for about 45 mins and there was still water in the pan but I kind of said screw it.  It was so tender that all you needed was a fork to cut it.  We will definitely be making this recipe again.

We're not crazy about pork chops, but every once in a while I try to make them again anyway.  My husband thought they were excellent, I thought they were about 4 stars, the kids liked them too.  I mostly followed the recipe except used a bit less salt and used chicken broth instead of water.  I left the lid on the whole time.

Pretty tasty.  I didn't measure the seasoning salt and pepper, just sprinkled it on.  I cooked the onions up a bit before adding the liquid (used beef broth for fuller flavor).  When the chops were done, I removed them from the pan and thickened the sauce up with a cornstarch slurry.  Next time I will add some mushrooms too.

My family loves this but I usually have to drain off the liquid after the pork is cooked through. Then I cook it uncovered until the onions are caramelized. Very flavorful, moist and easy.

Wow, this was delicious!! My husband loved it!!! I did make a couple tweaks based upon other reviews.  I went with Michelle's from Nov 2005 and used the bacon! Sooo good!! They were a tad over cooked so I need to watch the timing a little better next time. closer to the 15 mins cooking time.

Tried this receipe for the first time and I loved it...I did add spicy pepper and garlic powder when I browned the pork chops, otherwise pretty much followed the recipe.  I do agree with the other reviewers that once you turn the chops over, turn your stove to med-high and leave uncovered to evaporate the water...stir often.

This recipe turned out amazing!
I used Red Robin seasoning as the "seasoned salt" and sautéd the onions with a little garlic powder before adding the water... FYI: I read reviews and followed the advice to leave the pork chops cooking uncovered in step 3, rather than recovering them... These surpassed my expectations!

The pork chops themselves came out pretty dry with the recommended cooking time. The onions certainly made this dish. I used apple juice instead of water and it gave it an amazing, sweet flavor. I would make these again and cook them longer on a lower heat to retain more moisture in the meat. I think maybe I will try them in the crock pot next time.

This dish was really really good...My only issues were that I ended up having to remove the pork chop from the onion in order not to over cook them.  I also had to remove the lid from the pan, as the water was not evaporating.  The onion ended up being a little mushy.  I also added mushroom.  Next time I may remove the pork chop earlier, and not cover it with a lid.  Other than that the flavor was really really good!  Will definitely make again with my modifications.

I love this.  It's so simple and flavorful, and I could eat the onions for dessert, seriously.  One of my friends tried his hand at the recipe and added lemon pepper and garlic powder too, and it was excellent.

Loved the idea but the execution wasn't what we hoped for.  Flavor seemed lacking and because of simmering the onions (rather than how I normally caramelize them) they seemed to have an odd texture.  Definitely edible but probably won't make again.

Used 6 loin chops, 2 small/med onions, added several dashes of liquid smoke, mixed 1/2 (large) bullion cube with the 1 C water.  Didn't cook the liquid down too much.  Added Wondra to thicken just a bit.  Very good, although the meat wasn't quite as tender as I had expected.

Take it easy on the seasoning salt. It was great, but too salty. I also made gravy with the drippings in the same pan. Outstanding!

Easy is the key word here! The pork chops were very tender and juicy, something that is always a challenge with pork.

What a great way to enjoy pork chops!  I've made this recipe five times in the last month, I like it so much!  However, I believe the amount of water to add is variable, and near end of cooking pan may have to be uncovered to reduce sauce.  Scrumptious!

This was fabulous when I made it tonight but I made a few modifications. The total cooking time ended up being closer to an hour than 45 min. I browned the chops, removed them then caramelized the onions, adding 2. t. of sugar & 1/2 t. paprika. Added back the chops, then used 1 c. of beef boullion (used the concentrated paste, Better Than Boullion). Simmered covered 20 min., turned then simmered another 15 min. Removed chops turn heat to high, whisked in a paste made of 2 T butter & 2 T. flour, let it bubble a couple minutes while whisking. Turned down the heat to a simmer, added the chops back in... spooning the gravy over the chops. Covered and simmered another 5 minutes. Placed chops on a platter, gravy in a bowl. Served  with steamed new potatoes & green beans. Fabulous! Hubby was thrilled at the new addition to our menu.

Excellent!!! I love this recipe! It's super easy, minimal ingredients, and tastes wonderful. I did leave uncovered at the end to let water evaporate, but that is the only thing I did different from the original recipe.  Next time, I will probably double the onions.  I will definitely make this often!

These pork chops were great. Made a few changes I browned the chops in oil, added onions with some sugar carmelizd them a bit used chicken broth instead of water cooked for 40 min. Yummy! Husband requested them again and teenage daughter gave them a thumbs up.

Simple and delicious recipe! Following the advice of others I browned the chops in the oil, removed them from the pan and added the onion and 2 tsp sugar. Once the onions had carmelized beautifully I put the chops back in the pan with the onions, poured in one cup chicken stock and covered/simmered for 30 min ( I used thick chops so they took a little extra time). I then removed the cover and let the sauce simmer/reduce for an additional 10 minutes. I served them with acorn squash and roasted brussel sprouts. A wonderfully satisfying meal!

Easy and delicious.  My kids loved them. I did leave the lid off after the first 20 minutes and it made it's own sauce.  Will definitely make this again.

I gave this recipe 4 stars because it was as easy to prepare as it was tasty.  I added a tsp of sugar after I removed the pork chops and the onion was fantastic!  Nice to break away from the same old pork chop recipe I usually make!

This is a really delicious recipe and I will definitely be using it again. I was pressed for time so I halved the amount of water used so that the onions would caramelise faster.

My husband thought this was fantastic! I loved how fast and easy it is. I can be out of the kitchen in no time! I thought I might give the chops a quick brown on the grill and then caramelize the onions with them next time just to see how the flavor changes. Also, I might try putting in some orange or yellow bell pepper strips with the onions just for a change and make it like a pork fajita meal. I can see this any time of the year. I think it would look pretty served surrounded with parsley mashed potatoes. This is definitely worth making.

This is very good. I gave it 4 stars because I changed it a little bit. I did a true carmelization of the onions with a little sugar before adding the pork chops. However, this was a great idea that hadn't occurred to me before- it's my new favorite way to do pork chops! Thanks for sharing!

Chops turned out great. Mine were very tender. Followed recipe for the most part. I had trouble carmalizing the onions, but I think that is because I just don't do it that often. Very good, will do again, great lunch the next day also.

This is my kind of recipe! SO easy and very good! I followed the recipe exactly this time (with the exception of taking off the lid for the second simmer and turning up the heat). However, we'll use a little less pepper next time and more onions. It's been a LONG time since having a pork chop this tender!

I love this recipe and I personally don't like pork chops, but these just sounded so moist. And.... they are. I did follow a few suggestions from other reviewers. I used beef broth instead of water, I used 2 vidala onions and I added already sauteed mushrooms at the end. In fact I'm making this for my second time right now. They turn out very flavorful and moist.

I've made this twice and it came out nicely both times. Once was with chicken instead of pork. Both times I used cajun seasoning because I was out of seasoning salt, and used chicken broth instead of water. It wasn't a favorite but it went over well and I will make it again.

I liked this recipe. I use this when i need to make dinner and don't feel like it. heheh its very easy and I don't need a bunch of ingredients. I don't drink wine but my mom and Mother in law do. After they leave i always have some left in the bottle so i substitute the water for white wine. This gives it a nice flavor. I will put some chopped garlic in with the onions as well. The to top it off I serve it with a vegi and brown rice so I stay on the healthy side. Husband loves it!

I wish I would have read the reviews before I made this. It did not have much flavor and my pork chops were really tough. I definitely think it needs to cook longer. The onions didn't caramelize either. I think with some work it could be really good.

These were super tasty!  Had them for dinner a couple nights ago.  Used extra thick boneless loin chops and subbed canned beef broth for the water.  After cooking, removed the chops and onions, drained off most of the liquid, then whisked in some flour to make a roux, added the reserved liquid and the rest of the can of broth and made a gravy to go over the chops.  I only made 2 chops and there were plenty of onions, but I'd at least double the onion for more servings.  Served this with garlic parmesan mashed potatoes.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe ROCKS. My guests loved it. I only had half of an onion on hand so I made some modifications. I added a tablespoon of minced garlic to the oil before the browning process. I also added 1 beef bullion cube to my 1 cup of water and about a teaspoon or so of cornstarch. I skipped the second addition of salt & pepper as I tasted my sauce right before that and it already had excellent flavor. I also left the cover off after about 20 mins and maintained a good amount of what turned out to be a gravy. Served this with mashed potatoes--EXCELLENT!!

These were wonderful!! They were a little bit salty for my taste though so I would cut back a bit on the seasoning salt. Maybe it makes a difference that I used Lawry's because they are a bit saltier than most. But, still wonderful!

Before cooking this, my husband informed me that he only like shake n bake pork.  Well, he loved this recipe!  I liked it as well.  I did as previous reviewers suggested and carmelized the onions with some white sugar and a touch of brown sugar as well.  I was very happy with how everything turned out.  Thanks!

I found this to be really salty.  I think I may use 1 cup of apple juice or concentrated apple juice next time and add in some sliced apples.

Too much salt, pepper, and grease ruined the dish, particularly the Vidalia onions I used which tasted like a mouthful of salt. The only saving grace was that I used half the pepper and the pork steaks were an inch thick; otherwise, it would have been unbearable. I gave it a three rating because my kids and husband said it wasn't that bad--but they didn't eat the onions. I won't make this again.

It was a bit salty, I wish I had taken the pork chops out after they were done and added some sugar to the onions to get a bit of sweetness. i think this would make the saltiness a little less intense. I'll do this next time!

This wasn't really what I was expecting.  It wasn't bad, but I had to make a lot of changes for it to be good.  I salt and peppered (and added garlic powder) both sides of the chops to my liking, browned, then added double the amount of onion, and chicken broth instead of water.  The chops were completely done after 20 minutes, in fact they could of cooked for less time because they turned out a tad dry.  This leaves a problem with the remaining cooking time.  So I took the chops out after 20 minutes to continue "caramelizing" the onions, except they never did because there was too much liquid. The sauce never thickened, so I had to add some cornstarch + water.  The chops were a bit bland (even with broth) and the onions never really caramelized.

4 or 5 stars from most reviewers? What do they usually eat - cardboard? I seasoned chops with my favorite chop rub, adopted many reviewer suggestions, such as brown chops, remove from pan, brown onions & add chops back w/ beef broth. Onions were ok, chops were dull, boring, somewhat dry. I buy high quality chops so I doubt it was the meat.  Won't make this again.

These turned out very flavorful and delicious.  I'm a huge fan of caramelized onions anyway, but never would have thought of making pork chops like this.  Because of reviewers saying the recipe measurements created a dish that was too salty and peppery, I didn't measure the seasoning salt and pepper.  I just sprinkled the seasonings on both sides of the pork chops how I usually would and went from there.  Also, I didn't need to add any water for the second half of the recipe, because the pork chops had released enough juices on their own.  We served this with buttered peas and four-cheese mashed potatoes.

Delicious. I thought the pork chops were a tad dry (I think recipie should indicate what size chops to uee). I cut up chops and covered the in the sauce. removed chops and cooked onions uncovered. Needs more onions. I also added a pinch of sugar. Husband liked it although it was different from the way he likes his pork chops. I will make again.

These are very good, however I substituted chicken broth for the water and this added a nice flavor. Also as suggested, I left the pan uncovered while simmering. Very tender, love these!

I added extra seasonings because I was worried this could be too bland. I seasoned the chops with salt,pepper,poultry and italian seasonings. It gave it a really nice flavor. My problem was with the water used. After reading others reviews stating that 1 cup of water was too much, I used at least half less. I'll try this again in the future and see how it works with even less water.

I added a few red pepper flakes and some ground ginger at the beginning too - I also sauteed the pork chops instead of veg oil...it was very good. Also - on the second simmer - you need to remove the lid otherwise the liquid will not cook off. Overall it was easy and good!

These do taste good if you add your own little touch to them. You need to spice the porkchops accordingly or you will end up with a bland dinner.
Use common sense and your own tastes for spicing...I like to rub my chops with plenty of salt, pepper, garlic and paprika.
This recipe is pretty simple and quick. There is not much to it, if you like onions then you will like this recipe.
I gave it 3 stars as it does taste delicious but, it is not a ground-breaking recipe.

I never rate anything, but I had to this time... These were the BEST pork chops I've ever had BAR NONE!!

I followed the uncover suggestion as other reviewers had, and rubbed a little sage along with the seasoned salt and pepper (to taste, didn't measure)

The greatest!  I had to tell my Mom about it!

We love these pork chops. I have made them many times. I always add extra onions, because they are so good. I do the second simmer with the lid off, as recommended by others. Next time, I may try some of the other reviewers' suggestions.

I should have read the reviews before I made this - too much water.  But tasted great and really tender meat.  I added an extra onion, used only 1/2 tsp salt, and added red wine vinegar to the water.  Really good easy meal.

Loved this one...super easy and tasted great.  Because we love onions i added extra onions also sprinkled about 1 teaspoon of garlic powder on the chops along with the other seasonings.  family loved it!

Good easy recipe.  I did take the advice and added only 3/4 cups of water. After the water and onion mixture reduced and the onions were yellow I then removed the pork and added another 1/2 cup of water mixed with 2 teaspoons of cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  I whisked around in the pan until the sauce thickened and then added the pork back in.  It was so delicious.

YUM! YUM! What an easy, tasty recipe!!!  I will always do pork loin like this from now on.  I am going to experiment with chicken.  I changed the recipe by using only 2/3 cup water (as recommended by others), cajun seasoning instead of the salt and pepper alone, and one of those little tubs of garlic dipping sauce you get with pretzels.  My GOSH it was good!  Oh yeah, if you like onions (which I do) use 2 onions instead of one.  Don't forget to add seasoning to your onions. They will cook down.  Be sure to leave the lid off the last 20 minutes so that the water will actually evaporate as recommended by the other folks who have rated this recipe.

This recipe was excellent.  It took a lot longer to cook then expected.  I removed the pork chops and turned the heat up to high evaporate the water.  I agree with the other reviewers that the lid should be removed.  My husband loved it.

This is an easy, tasty, and flexible recipe, a real go-to whenever pork is on sale.  I serve it with baked apples and yams along with a side salad or a steamed veggie for a rich and satisfying fall meal.

These pork chops are surprisingly tender after cooking them in the skillet. After cooking them several times I find it's better to add less water, because it takes a long time to evaporate.  Excellent with mashed potatoes!

I made the adjustments as suggested.  I sprinkled on the seasoned salt and pepper and also some Mrs. Dash.  I used 2 onions and sliced them on the thick side. I used 1/2 cup beef broth and they turned out great.  I wouldn't call the onions caramelized but they were very tasty.  I will make again with the new choices.

Good. I used less seasoning salt. I couldn't get the water to evaporate so I drained it into a bowl and used wondra to make a gravy. Served over the chops & mashed potatoes.

The chops were flavorful and tender.  I reduced the amount of pepper like some others recommended.  The onions came out mushy, but still tasty.  I think I will reduce the amount of water added to them next time. Had sauteed asparagus and a portabello mushroom risotto to go with it.

I added sliced portabello mushrooms and caramelized some halved brussel sprouts to add to the mix.  Then sprinkled in a bit of dried thyme leaves before simmering.  It's not a pretty dish but boy is it good!  My boyfriend wants this one again this week!  I served it up with a medly of wild rice.

This is a great recipe.  I scaled it down to 2 servings and used 1/2 can beef broth instead of the water, then thickened it with cornstarch, as another reviewer did.  

I'll definitely make this again.  YUM!

Very very good.  Pork chops were very soft and moist. The only thing I might change would be the amount of seasoning salt...it was a little too salty for my taste...Next time I will use only 2 tsp instead of 3.  Very good overall...enjoy

This recipe is wonderful.  Definitely a family favorite. Even my picky eaters love it.  Very easy to make, I did add beef broth and more onion. Also added mushrooms.  Takes longer than recipe calls for. About an hour to let liquid reduce, but chops fall apart they are so tender!!  Thanks.

I had to tweak this because i'm on the south beach way of eating. I used olive oil, and i added a half a cup of water to make it quicker. This is the best pork chop recipe i've ever had, and we eat it once a week!!

Very flavorful, moist and tender pork chops.  It did take me close to 2 hours to cook (until the liquid evaporated), but well worth the wait.  I removed the chops and lightly browned the onions. I also used 2 onions instead of 1. It was a huge hit!  Thanks.

This was a great tasting recipe but the way it is written, it took 2 hours! The last part of the recipe should say, "remove cover and simmer until liquid evaporates".

What an easy, delicious, low cost/LOW CARB pork chop dish! I scaled my recipe to 6 for my slightly larger family and it worked out great.  I also added a little of both chicken & beef boullion granules to my water (as suggested by others), otherwise following the recipe to the "T."  My family is very pleased!
As a side, I also prepared the "Baked Whole Cauliflower" recipe from this site..... it was the perfect accompanyment!  Thanks!

This was a wonderful dish.  My kids loved it, even my picky eater.  I did make some changes based on previous reviews. After browning the chops I kept them warm in the oven while carmelizing the onions. I replaced the water with chicken broth and added more onions since they are so yummy and shrink down a bit.  I also added 1 tbsp. brown sugar to the sauce to sweeten it up a bit and WOW.  I added corn starch to thicken the sauce then smothered the chops and potatoes.  My husband gave this dish the thumbs up.  He is a gourmet cook and that means a ton to me!!!!  Thanks Pamela

This was delicious!!! I used low salt chicken broth insted of water. I used the seasoned salt on my husbands and Mrs. Dash Herb and Garlic on mine. I used 2 onions and added some mushrooms. I added no salt and just a little pepper. After the first simmer I took off the cover, took out the chops, turned heat on high until liquid was gone and onions were caramelized. I then added back the porkchops and covered with onion mixture, recovered and heated on low. I served with raosted poatoes, peppers, zucchini and mushrooms. Nice and tender and very flavourful

Rather than the seasoning salt and pepper, I used about four tablespoons of LITE soy sauce (my husband is Chinese, children half-Asian)and these chops turned out great!

My husband is on the Atkins diet and I was looking for a low-carb pork chop recipe, and this was the one I used.  Husband loved the chops, and the carmelized onions was great over the caulitatos I made with it.  I will use this recipe again.

Good flavor---took a super long time for the onions to caramelize and I got a little anxious so I probably could've cooked them longer and made the dish even better!

Unbelievably good for so simple a recipe! I cut a pork loin into chops, removed after browning, as suggested by others and carmelized the onions with a little brown sugar. Returned the chops to pan, added beef broth, and covered. Great! served with mashed potatoes!

I thought this was wonderful and so did my family.  I seasoned the pork chops with a garlic seasoning salt to my liking, I used chicken broth instead of water.  The liquid didn't absorb, so I added some flour and water and thickened it and then poured the gravy over the top of the pork chops when served.  My family said it was the best gravy ever.

I love this recipe. I used the seasonings to my taste and used chicken broth as others had mentioned. I also removed my chops after browning both sides and added my onions and browned them also. Everyone loved this and asked for it again this week. Thank You Pamela!!!

This was so easy and tasted great.  I used apple juice instead of water and simmered about twice as long.  Very tender.

We make this alot, only instead of simmering the onions and pork in water, we use chicken broth. I don't usually season my chops, because the chicken broth adds a nice flavor. This is great with the recipe for Baked Mushroom Rice.

I thought these were pretty good.  They were so easy.  My liquid did not completely evaporate, but I liked having a little juice to spoon on top.

This recipe was a bit of a let down. The pork chops were very tender and juicy with excellent flavor. The onions however turned mushy and the water never evaporated. I did use a white onion and am not sure if perhaps that made the differance. I will not make this recipe again.

I browned the pork chops very well and cooked according to directions. After 15 minutes I remeoved the pork chops and added a bit of red wine to the onions. Them cooked on med high heat to reduce the liquid. I will also add another onion next time. Really needed two.

We decided to bread the pork chops and set aside.  We made a gravy from the onions and drippings.  We also added more seasonings.  We added red wine to the gravy.  This recipe needed more ingredients and is a little too basic. It really isn't worth even printing when you change it that much.

This was a great recipe, although I should have taken the advice of so many others who have tried this and not have used so much salt. 

I will definetly make this again, but with much less seasoned salt.

Next time I make these, will only use 1/4 cup of water as even with the lid off, the water would not simmer "off" and the onions then were mushy.  The chops were great, having a lot of onion flavor and very tender.  Maybe I had the burner set too low.  But I will make again.

I thought the pepper taste was too pronounced, perhaps using less and using fresh ground pepper would make it better. They were good but I would definitely tweak it before making it again; they're a nice change of pace.

These pork chops were really good even though they were a little bit salty.  Next time I'll use the seasoned salt more sparingly.  I also simmered them uncovered as other reviewers had suggested.

Very tasty! My husband who always thought he hated pork chops, loved them. I altered it a bit by doing a quick marinade of worcestershire, soy sauce, horseradish, mustard, and garlic before hand. It made a great gravy too. I definitley recommend.

Super easy to make, great flavor!  I made it to take to my neighbors for dinner, and they praised it highly!  I agree with the other reviewer, I think that step three should be to cook uncovered, which is what I did.  There's no way one could cook away 1 cup of water in the stated 40 minute cooking time if left covered.

I loved the method but changed up to suit my taste after reading other reviews. I sprinkled both sides of the boneless chops with seasoned salt and fresh cracked pepper. Took them out of the pan after browning, caramelized one huge thin sliced Utah onion with some sugar, mixed a cup of water with a teaspoon of better than boullion and deglazed the pan. The chops went back in to simmer for 20 with the cover on. Took them back out and kicked up the heat to boil down the sauce, thickened it with a corn starch slurry and added a dash or two of kitchen bouquet before putting the chops back in to heat through.  Amazingly tender and flavorful. I’ll make it again.

This has always been my “everyday” pork chop recipe. Pork chops, salt and pepper, onions and water! Can’t get much simpler than that! It’s always easy, always good. The reason I’m sending this review in is because my directions differ slightly and may make all the difference since I noticed many of the submitted pictures have very, very pale onions and gravy. Caramelized onions are brown, rich and sweet. I first dry then brown my pork chops on each side, in a tiny bit of butter, then remove them from the pan. Then, I add the rest of the oil or butter and the onions - sauté on low medium heat, when rich brown, I deglaze with water, get all up the brown bits, adjust seasonings, and return pork chops to pan, covered, to finish cooking. This results in a nice, dark, rich, oniony sauce. In this way, the caramelized onions, which take much longer to cook, won’t over cook your chops.

Made this tonight for dinner. It was so good! I love that there are not a ton of ingredients. You can really enjoy the taste of the pork. Sometimes I think there are too many seasonings that overpower a dish. Not this one! This one is a keep and will make again in the future!

Rubbing seasoned salt on was my big mistake. We hardly ever add salt when cooking. Other than that we enjoyed the chips cooked this wa. Will make again omitting seasoned salt.

I omitted the salt all together since me and hubby take BP medicine.  I used boneless pork loin chops and sprinkled both sides with cayenne pepper.  After browning I poured in a can of low sodium beef broth and the onions, covered and simmered 20 minutes.   Flipped the chops and simmered another 15 minutes.  Then removed the chops and stirred in water/cornstarch mix to thicken the sauce.  These chops melted in our mouth.  Hubby ate 3 of them!!  Thanks for the recipe.

i browned onions for a few minutes with a little balsamic vinegar before adding vegetables stock and covering pan.  i also used monterey steak seasoning instead of season salt.  i sprinkled a tablespoon of dried rosemary on pork chops before i put lid on pan.  when done, i pulled out two chops with onions and added sliced brown mushrooms and a little more balsamic vinegar for my pork chop and cooked a few more minutes.  it was delicious.

This was easy and I had all the ingredients! I used 2 tablespoons of Tony’s Creole seasoning, fresh black pepper, 4 garlic cloves slices (or diced, your preference) and 6-8 dashes of Worcester sauce. My family loved it! Even the one picky eater. I served with steamed broccoli. Next time I’ll have some buttered mashed potatoes. :)

Perhaps the recipe calls for too much water. It takes quite a while to cook it off and get to caramelizing., which is the only reason I am not handing out five stars. Started this almost an hour ago following the recipe.

Was too salty, without using the second salt application. Probably will not use it again. Much prefer my pork chops in my mushroom soup recipe in my Slow Cooker.

I've made caramelised onions so many times before and it seems to me that the sugar has been missed in these ingredients otherwise the onions here are only steamed in the water, hence me giving it only 2 stars. Caramelising means to use sugar to caramelise the ingredients. This is why so many others have commented on added a little sugar.

Great starter recipe. I used my rib rub for the chops, browned them, then set aside. Used 1 onion with a bit of sugar to brown them. I cut up some mini potatoes and added to the onion. (cut in half so they cook) then put the chops back in the pan to simmer. I also used a mix of chicken stock and apple juice for the liquid.  When potatoes were done I made a gravy. The potatoes go well with the onion gravy. May add cut carrots next time as well.
I simmered the whole thing for about 1 hour.  Turned out well. I will make this again.

I was slow being the first time to make it so it took longer than it said.  The chops were Very tender but too salty for me & I did not use nearly as much season salt as it said to use.  I needed either a bigger onion or more than one because it just did not make enough after it cooked down.  It seemed to take a long time for all the water to cook away.  I will make it again but I will probably alter it a bit to suit our taste.  I loved how tender it was & it did have a good flavor.

Delicious. I used regular salt, not seasoning salt. I also looked at other reviews and used two onions not realizing until the end it called for 4 chops, I only used 2. But I love onions so it was perfect. Definitely for 4 chops you need 2-3 onions. Otherwise, it turned out perfect. I served with mashed potatoes and carrots/green beans.

I liked this recipe. It yields a juicy pork chop. I did however used broth instead of water and added minced garlic, because I like my meats to have some flavor. My only suggestion would be to uncover the chops for the second simmering to evaporate the liquid faster or to put them in the broiler. The sauce that resulted was a bit thick which looks like a gravy. My onions did not caramelize but I know it is because I did not evaporate the liquid completely. This recipe is a winner!!

Made this twice now, first time I used a pinch of five spice and nowhere near the amount of salt and pepper suggested, really good. 
Second time, again I only seasoned how I would a steak, only this time I used steak seasoning on Chops instead of the five spice and fried onions for five mins before adding water, a tasty meal both ways.

I cut the recipe in half with the exception of the water.  The pork chops had good flavor but the onions didn't caramelize.  Onions tasted good also but not as good had I remembered to use half the water also.

I didn't have seasoning salt so just used salt and pepper. I used two onions as we like our onions and I simmered it longer so the pork chops were super tender. It was amazing.  This was a lighter and healthier version of a similar recipe my mom used to make with flour and milk gravy instead of just water. I will make this again.

Delicious!  I agree about it being too salty as written, but we used less, and it was great.  After the 20 minutes of cooking with the water, we removed the pork and made gravy with an added flour/milk slurry.

4.5 stars, actually. I made only one big change to this, and that is only because I don't have any seasoning salt at the moment (I know.... who let's this happen?) so I used "Good " made by Big  Ranch (as in rooster, people! Get your minds out of the gutter and into the kitchen.)  I am sure that this recipe would be good as written, but the Good  took it over the top. 
The only other thing I did differently than the recipe is that I put the onions under the pork chops, and removed the chops when they were done to allow a better carmelization of the onions.  I made these in a cast iron skillet and they turned it so lovely.

It was ok.  Hubby & Daughter liked it.  I was just so so on it.  I didn't use all the salt after reading the other reviews.  Otherwise made it as per instructions.  Made a gravy with drippings and left over broth.  That helped things quite a lot.

Congratulations Chef John!  This was delicious. No changes except only cooked 2 chops.  I served it with mashed potatoes, a salad and a green vegetable.  My husband and I loved it!

This is so good!  Made it exactly as directed until the 20-minute mark.  At that point the pork was done, so I removed the chops from the pan, cranked the heat up a bit, and let the onions brown and the liquid reduce.  The flavors in this are outstanding and unexpected, given such simple ingredients.  I think this one is going to be a regular!  Served it with home fries and mixed vegetables.

This is how my mother always cooked her chops on the stove.
The next time I make I will follow the other reviews by using broth or apple juice instead of water.

Didn't have seasoned salt so used some substitutes but the taste was pretty yummy. However the meat was tough though I did cook it in broth for about 30mins. Next time I'll tenderise the chops first then cook. Will definitely try again s the taste was good. Thank you for sharing!

I sprinkled some Roasted Garlic and Herb season on top along with the salt and pepper and they turned out amazing.

There are only the 2 of us, so we cut everything in half.  Next time I'd cut the water in half again, to 1/4 C.  Otherwise, it was very good.

I followed the suggestion of adding a pinch of sugar to the onions while caramelizing.  Bad choice.  I should have used thin cut, bone in chops, but I had thick cut boneless on hand. Maybe I'll make it again, but NO SUGAR.  As made, it wasn't good at all.

I made the recipe as per recipe but found it was over seasoned and the amount of water was too much! I will make it again and will change accordingly! The pork was tender and delicious!

Loved this recipe, pork chops came out nice and tender. Two things I would do different next time:  add less seasoned salty as it did taste a little too salty and I would also add a lot more onion.  Everyone felt they did not get nearly enough!

I agree that you should at least double the amount of onions.  I also added sliced mushrooms and diced garlic, and substituted lemon pepper for seasoned salt.   With all the water content of the onions and mushrooms, I could have cut back on the water by 1/4  and had to cook uncovered for about 15 minutes to get the right thickness of the saucy/gravy.   But it was delicious served with mashed potatoes and a garden salad.  I'll be making this again.

This is the best recipe for pork chops!  I think thick chops are a must. I caramelized the onions first and set aside. Then browned the chops, and added the cup of water and onions. Perfectly done (in a dutch oven) in 20 minutes and OH so tender! The onion broth was delish over mashed potatoes. You don't need anywhere near the amount of salt and pepper the recipe calls for.  Just season both sides of the chops (I used Lawry's.)  I will definitely make this again.

I've made this  basic recipe for several years. I cut the onion into slices  which  gives me  basic  onion rings.  The only change was that I didn't let all the  water evaporate.   I used  it as a  sauce over mashed  potatoes.  An easy and delicious  recipe!

It was good, but I would use less water next time - I cooked it longer than the recipe suggested and there was too much liquid in the pan.  The onions didn't carmelize  like they should have.

Definitely will make this again, I am a huge fan of healthy food for sure! However I did have to decrease the amount of salt I used due to a healthier dieting plan I have myself on. Pork chops usually are not the most healthy things in the world, but I tell ya, sacrificing some of the ingredients for healthier ones make all the difference. Thanks so much for sharing this awesome recipe, it was without a doubt delicious!

Followed all the changes noted.  The onions and sauce were great but the pork chops were still dry and chewy.  And it needs more flavour.   I might try this again with chicken.

I read reviews before I make a recipe and I was tempted to change this one after reading the reviews and I'm sure the changes would make a good meal to. THIS RECIPED STANDS ON ITS OWN THE WAY IT IS WRITTEN!! I was skeptical about if the onions would brown after boiling, if it would need extra fat to brown them, etc. but it turned out excellent as written. The only negative was that it was a little too salty for me (I measured out the season salt which I usually don't do), but my husband didn't think it was too salty. Next time I will use about 2 tsp. total and not add the last tsp. to the onions when cooking off the water. I did boil uncovered to get the water to cook down. Next time I may use a little less water because that step took a while, but the onions with the water, season salt and pepper made a wonderful sauce to put on the pork chop. I thought it would not be very flavorful, but it was EXCELLENT!

I love this app! It's easy to get to with pictures, clearly listed ingredients and directions. Then there are  comments, some helpful, some not so and some funny. What's not to love? Thank you for making my cooking easier and more pleasurable!

Very easy and delicious. We changed the seasoning a little bit to use less salt, and still came out good.

This is great!  I browned the chops on each side and removed them from the pan. Caramelize the onions in butter with a teaspoon of sugar. Add the flour  and then a can of beef stock   ( no water) and 1/2 a packet of Lipton onion soup mix. add the chops back in and simmer for 20 to .30 mins. For seasoning I don't use salt just garlic powder, paprika and a little pepper.

This is very similar to what my Mother would make for me back in the day. Although she used veal, pork is just as good! I also read somewhere in the comments about adding cornstarch (I used potato starch) to thicken the leftover watery sauce. I did this and it turned out pretty great. Thanks for sharing, and enjoy!

If I'd read the reviews and made a few tweaks before making this, it'd be at 5 stars. As it stands, these are the best pork chops I've ever cooked. I have a bad habit of over cooking and was scared after 35 minutes that these would be overdone, but they were actually perfect. There is way too much salt though. I will probably cut the salt in half next time. The onions also didn't carmelize, so I moved the chops to a plate and kicked the heat up, then added some cornstarch and made onion gravy instead.

If you don't like salty things, make sure that you go easy on the salt with these when rubbing them, and don't even bother adding the extra salt

I have made this recipe at least 8 times for my family.  They all love it and it is so easy.  I used to make it as directed, but I have changed one thing.  I flour the pork chops with flour and season salt and then fry them first.  It just makes them better and helps to thicken the sauce a little when you put them back in the pan.  I also use chicken broth instead of water as suggested in the hits that pop up in the recipe.

I attempted to follow the recipe to a T but got distracted in my spices cabinet. I used less season salt than described, beef stock in place of the water, and added garlic because well, it's delicious. I did follow the suggestion of removing the pork chops to a plate while the stock and onions boiled down, and then thickened the resulting sauce with a little corn starch slurry. The resulting dish was DELISH! I will definitely be making it again!

I used three onions and would add more next time - 
Even my 11 year old daughter liked them which is a great compliment as she doesn't care for pork chops.

Definitely worth making.

This will be in the rotation! A great chop when the grill is not available in the cold of winter. I seasoned the chops with a Korean spice mix (garlic, onion, sugar, sesame etc).  I browned the chops in my cast iron skillet, then put them in a 200 degree oven while I started to cook the onions.  I added sugar to the onions as others had suggested and cooked most of the water out.  Then I put the chops back in my pan and lowered the temperature to low and let them cook until they were done.  I don't have a lid for my cast iron, so I loosely covered it with foil.  It held in moisture, without boiling the meat. The family all loved it!

I used creole seasoning because I didn't have seasoned salt.  I also used chicken broth instead of water. I followed the recipe and left the chops in the pan while reducing the liquid because I didn't want to have to hassle with keeping them warm.  I turned up the heat and cooked uncovered, turning them every five minutes.  Most of the liquid was gone in another 20 minutes.  

I took them off the heat when there were a few tablespoons of liquid left because I wanted a little sauce and not just caramelized onions.  They were tender and juicy and I am glad I used the creole seasoning.  It gave them a nice level of spiciness.  Served with some brown rice, and some fresh green beans I steamed on top of the rice in the rice cooker.  I will make again.  Very easy meal especially when I need to cook for one.  But I cooked two thick chops for some leftovers!

The onions didn't  really caramelize, and even after simmering awhile I was left with a lot of liquid. 
Reading some other reviews I see a lot of good suggestions, but as it is, just alright. I won't make it again.

This is an easy recipe, yielding really delicious chops. I did enhance it by making my own rub for the chops. I used garlic sea salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder and oregano and basil. I rubbed the chops both sides with this. Also, instead of water, I used apple juice which really cranked up the flavor and at the end, I removed the  chops to a platter to let the liquid reduce and at the very end, I added a good portion of fresh cilantro. MMM MMM good!

Was a little salty. Consider reducing salt or if you use the chicken broth as recommended by another member, ensure it is low-sodium.

Very delicious. Preparation is really easy.  I used only pinches of salt to season since my husband has to be on low sodium diet.  I browned pork chops 12 minutes each side before onion and liquid was added.  It then took me more than an hour to reduce liquid (lid open).    Since I had too many apples at home, I added apple ( in addition to onion).  The sauce turned out super delicious.  Thanks for the great recipes.

Followed the recipe.  Incredible taste, incredibly tender chops.  Was a big hit.  A new "go to" recipe for pork.  The best quote from dinner was, "I wasn't hungry but these are incredible.  May I have another?"

I used pork medalions I cut into 2 " pieces.  I used chicken stock instead of water    And added green and red peppers so I did change it quite a bit.   Served over rice.  Made green beans with bacon and small salad and apple sauce for sides.  Was a big hit.   Really fast and so good.   Thanks for the great idea.   L. Meaney

Nice recipe: If you slice your onion first, cover it in a little bowl and microwave 2 minutes, until nicely wilted, you save a lot of time trying to caramelize.

My husband couldn't get enough!  I did like others and removed the chops to cook up the onions.  But I also added a bunch of chopped collard greens from the garden and wilted them down.  When they were cooked, I added a jar of pork gravy and added the chops back in to simmer and finish cooking.  Served the mixture over mashed potatoes.

Rather than vegetable oil I used garlic olive oil! It was amazing. I also used far less seasoned salt. Such a simple delicious recipe!

This is my new favorite recipe.  Super easy, super good.  I agree with some other posters, at step 3 you're going to want to take the cover off the pot.  And all told, it takes about an hour to boil off all the water and get the chops to their falling-apart, sweet tender goodness.  Loved this.  The hubs loved it, too.

I followed the recipe for the most part. However instead of cooking oil (only because I didn't have any) I fried up bacon and used the bacon grease which added more flavor. I also had to uncover the pan during the 2nd simmer at the last 10 minutes so the water could evaporate faster and still have caramelized onions with bacon sauce! Pretty yummy.

I seasoned my pork with garlic salt and a little bit of pepper- gave just the right amount of kick on the outside, and the onions were amazing. Listened to other reviewers and used more onions than the recipe called for- good thing, since my husband (who doesn't have the same 'love affair' I have with onions) kept trying to take more onions off my plate. I didn't add any sugar to carmelize the onions and thought they came out delicious. Added to the rotation!

This is good. I knew the onions would not carmalize with the lid on. I took off the lid and removed the chops and let the onions cook and most water evaporated. I only used 2 tsp of seasoning salt and left the black pepper the same. The gravy was good, what little there was. I had rice for the side and that was perfect! You could add corn starch to thicken it if you want gravy. In some reviews other used garlic and other spices. I think I will do that next time.

very easy to prepare with items typically on hand. It took me more than 10 minutes for the water to evaporate.  I feel that this recipe can be improved by frying the chops in one pan, sauteeing the onions in butter  and seasonings in another pan, then combining both aspects.  everyone in the house loved the smell. thank you for the recipe

I have made these 2 times. My store had loin roast on sale for 98 cents a pound so I wanted some new good recipes and found one here. The first time I made this exactly as written. I served this with mashed red potatoes and fresh green beans. The chops were melt in your mouth tender. The second time I made these I used a green bell pepper with the onion and a jalapeno pepper. I also used a cup of chicken base, 2 cloves of garlic and about a tablespoon of fresh Rosemary. Both ways were equally as delicious. Go for it. You're going to love it.

This is the only method I ever used that the pork is actually TENDER.  I also use broth instead of water and deleted the salt entirely cuz of the sodium in the broth. As far as the onions not caramelizing, you could just do them separately while the chops are braising.  A keeper for sure.

Everything is better with carmelized onions!!   I am making some tonight to serve over left over steak with cheese in a sandwich for DH.  I always add a little butter or olive oil to pan, turn heat to high for a few minutes then simmer covered until he gets home.

These are very good and easy to make. Definitely a keeper. I make something similar that my Mom made all the time.  After browning the chops and onions, I add a can of stewed tomatoes with oregano and the other Italian spices.  I put them through the food processor and add a can (or more)of water and/ or chicken broth.  Add more Italian spices and 1/2 tsp of vinegar.  Makes a great sauce to serve over mashed potatoes. I sometimes thicken the sauce with flour.

Easy & delicious. So much so my son looking at his meatless pork chop bone stated,"Oh how I wish I could have another one of you." These were fork tender. The only thing I did differently was floured mine then browned them in the skillet. Will definitely be my go to pork chop recipe!

I've fixed this recipe many times and it's five star as written.  Over a period of time, I've made a few changes for my own personal preference.  I always use beef or chicken broth instead of water and once I added some green peppers and put in when I add the onion and ever since then I've always make with onions and green peppers.  Simmering for the twenty minutes or so makes the pork chops moist and delicious! Yummmmmmy....

My husband doesn't really care for pork chops, but he says this is the best he's eaten. The carmelized onions make the pork very sweet, and the cooking method made even the thinner sirloin chops I used very tender! Will defintely make again! Thanks!

We liked these for a quick and easy meal.  The only thing I did differently was to about a TBSP of sugar as others had mentioned.  The onions really added to the flavor of the pork.  Will probably make again for a quick meal for the 4 of us.  Just not something I would make for company!

These turned out really moist and delicious.  I followed previous advice and substituted beef broth for the water, but not sure I would do that again.  It was a tad on the salty side - maybe reduce the salt?  But they certainly were juicy and flavorful.

Delicious!  I sauteed the onions in some bacon grease then set aside until needed.  Fried the chops in the same pan.  When done, I removed the chops to  warm plate.  Next, I tossed the onions back into the pan and deglazed with a bit of water.  This left the onions golden brown and extremely tasty.  My husband, an onion lover, was quite impressed with the caramelized onions and we both love pan fried chops.  Quick, easy, tasty!  This is a definite keeper

These were so delicious. They did need to be uncovered midway through though.  I just added a clove of minced garlic, and paired it with some rice with rosemary, and man, was this amazing.

Yummy recipe.  The liquid didn't evaporate all the way for me (and I did uncover it), but it didn't take away from the taste at all.  I liked the onions in the "sauce".  Very flavorful.  Chops were slightly dry but overall a tasty and easy recipe for a weeknight.

Followed some suggestions and used mushrooms and chicken broth and instead of water for more flavor.  I also didn't let it completely evaporate so I could pour some over my rice.

This was a good recipe but something was still missing.

Everyone in the house absolutely loved this one!  I used a little less seasoning salt and a little garlic salt.  I also doubled the recipe without a problem and it turned out great.  The second simmer is definitely supposed to be UN-covered.  Will make this over and over.

These pork chops were very good.  I changed the recipe a little.  I didn't have enough onions at home so instead of regular onions I poured a packet of Lipton Onion Soup Mix over it and 1/4 cup of white wine and a 1/2 cup of water.
It had such a nice smell and tasted great.

For some reason I didn't read the comments beforing trying the recipe and this was terrible.  Maybe with a lot less salt and pepper, it would be awesome.

Cooked this for dinner yesterday, and my picky husband really enjoyed it, also 2 of my grown sons who just dropped by, I always double my recipes, so there is always enough, need less to say they all had a double serving.

This is was good. I did take the suggestion from others and added extra onion and beef broth in place of the water. I did add some garlic to the onions and added some garlic powder. But all in all it was good. Thanks

Great recipe!  Next time I will add a little less salt and finish with the cover off to speed up evaporation.  Otherwise I loved it!  Very flavorful!

really good! I made a rub using the seasoned salt, pepper and enough olive oil to make a paste, then put them on the grill.  I carmelized the onions on the stove.

Easy, good flavor, a little on the chewy side.  Like most other reviewers, the liquid did not all evaporate.  I would make it again.

Very good and easy recipe.  I opted for garlic salt and Italian seasoning instead of seasoning salt and beef broth instead of water.  I let it cook for over 20 minutes but it never evaporated.  I was afraid it would get dry if overcooked, so we ate it without the full caramelization of the onions.  But, it was still good.

I added a lot more onions and used chicken broth. I had huge chops so I cooked covered for an hour, removed the chops, and let the water steam off. I did get tired off waiting so drained off about 3/4 cup of water. Tasty.

This was tender and yummy, I wish the recipe had been more clear as to how long the cook time really was. The final step of cooking the water off is much longer than 20 minutes. I'm still not sure? I had to pull off the pan and pour the rest of the water out cause all my other side dishes were ready! But still easy for the end result!

Everything was fine. Although, I HIGHLY recommend NOT using all that salt and pepper. They really detract from the flavor. It was spicy, TOO spicy.

Okay, but not great.  The onions were pretty good, but the chops came out dry and kind of boring.  Won't make again.

This was okay, but nothing to rave about. The pork turned out a little dry. Maybe I cooked it too long.

I used small chunks of pork and cooked in a big wok. i kept the lid on for about 20 mins, it took another 10 without the lid for the water to cook off. I poured a small amount of the water into a soup I was making along side, added alot of flavour.  Very tasty, makes the meat melt in your mouth.

I liked how tender the chops came out but my water never evaporated like it had said in the recipe directions. The chops also did not have enough flavor for my family. Will make agian but add a different spice ( we really like montreal seasonings) and maybe cut down on the water. They were simple and easy to make.

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars just for the delicious vidalia onions (although the chops were tender and juicy).  Previous reviewers are right, this takes longer than specified -- 1.5hrs for me.  I left the pan uncovered after the initial 20 minutes to help the water evaporate.  I plan to use this method in the future to carmelize onions and mushrooms to top steaks, chicken breasts, etc.

I made these just like the recipe said, except I added the  onions ( two instead of one, and I may add another next time- I did use small onions, so that may have been why) to the pan first and then added the chops, browned them and then added the water.   Also, it did take about 1 hour for the liquid to cook down, but it really made the chops TENDER!  I made a side of rice and served the onion mixture on top of it with another side of roated red potatoes.  Very tasty without a lot of work!!

This was yummy. Based on reading other reviews I added beef broth and took the lid off for the last 15 minutes so the broth would evaporate. I also added mushrooms. I added two onions and would add even more next time.

I made this last night and it was very good!!  I didn't use enough onion (it looked like so much... but they shrink! LOL  Next time, I'll use more) and I drained some of the oil for fear of adding the water and onions to it.  I'm glad I read some of the other reviews too.  I did take the lid off for the final cooking and even scooped out some of the water - and I only used a half of a cup...  Husband said they were very good and I'm sure I'll make it again!!

We love this recipe.  I've made it twice with two different cuts of chops and both turned out fabulous!  The meat is moist and very flavorful.  I did not end up using all of the salt and pepper mixture.  I found that just seasoning the meat was enough for the recipe.  I also had to take the lid off of the pan the last 1/2 of the recipe to get the liquid to reduce.

We thought it was too salty and too much pepper. The onions were nothing special. The meat was tender but it did take much longer to cook than stated. I would not make this again.

I had over 3lbs of pork steaks, so I used 2 lg onions and tried 1 can of beef broth (14oz) instead of water.  Way too much liquid...I used cornstarch to thicken it, added sliced fresh mushrooms, and then I went back to my old Lithuanian boss' "original" stroganoff sauce...mustard, sugar, and sour cream...My family LOVED it!  Except for the onions, and using Splenda, it's a low carb meal that I'll be making again and again (still not sure about that caramelizing)...Thanks, Pamela!!!
