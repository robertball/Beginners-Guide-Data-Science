OK, what's everyone's problems with cooking dried beans???  I make some kind of bean soup every week though I usually use navy or pinto beans or both together.  I rinse & check the beans for foreign matter, takes less than a minute.  Then I cover the beans with water so that it's 2 inches over the beans.  Bring to a boil, then turn down to a simmer & cover.  Takes about 2 1/2 hours to cook pintos, maybe half an hour less for navy beans.  I never ever bothered with the soaking or boiling for 2 minutes and waiting an hour or any of that unnecessary stuff.  (However, if you have gas problems from eating beans, it might help if you do that, as described by BugsNRoo.) And if you can't be bothered with or plain old just don't have time to cook dried beans, then just open some canned ones, rinse and drain them and stop whining.  Wanda, you have been treated poorly!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

4 stars because the recipe submitter forgot to add that you need to do some sort of soak before you use dried beans. Although I'm sure most home cooks know to do a soak! I did a quick soak first where I covered the beans in water brought to a boil took off the heat and let them sit covered for an hour. Then I drained the water and rinsed them and started cooking. I used ham hocks which helped flavor the soup but I probably had much less ham in my soup than called for. That was my only change to the recipe. My husband loved the soup! I thought the sour cream gave it a nice creamy texture and it felt good eating it on a cold day. It was simple and it didn't take a lot of time to make. I will be making this soup again in the future!

This was the first time I made a 16 bean soup and my husband and I thought it turned out suprisingly good. I followed the directions on the bag of beans for sorting rinsing quick soak and cooking. 30 minutes before beans finished cooking I added the spice packet that came with bag and also 1 lb of cooked ham 1 can of diced tomatoes 1 chopped onion 4 cloves minced garlic (because we love garlic otherwise 1 clove) and 1 cup sour cream. I liked how the sour cream idea from this recipe added a little more rich flavor instead of just a water only based soup. Maybe next time will try with the cream corn too.

No biggie using dried beans. It simply takes time/ planning to soak. I chop sandwich meat ham and cook it w/o the sour cream so I can freeze some easily. We just stir sour cream in each bowlful. True it's an unappealing color but tastes great enough to remain on our favorites list. Serve with cornbread.

This is very simple and very tasty! I did follow another reviewer's suggestion to soak the beans overnight and that helped ensure they were cooked all the way through.

Okay but not a chest pounding soup. Used Bob s Red Mill 13 Bean Soup Mix since it was on hand - - didn t think losing 3 beans was a deal breaker since one bean was lost between the title and ingredient list.

Taste was a 4 but I reduced it for hassle/time factor. I just think it would have been so much easier to open several cans of beans and add some spices. It looks innocently simple but working with dried beans I think is just a pain. Beans will NOT cook by boiling and simmering for an hour or two. I have to boil them soak them overnight and then simmer them for quite some time the next day. My mother had to do this my brother too. Are we the only three people who can't make dried beans ready in 2-3 hours? Or does everyone else just like hard beans? I know what boil and simmer mean and this just doesn't work. And they'll never get by on 6 cups of water. I don't know how much I added but I lost count at about 11-12 cups. When the beans were about 3/4 done I drained them and just covered in water added the flavor packet and the ham itself to help add flavor. And then added water as needed to get a thickish soup that still had flavor. It was pretty good once it was done which was a full day. (That doesn't include the time going through the beans which I always do since I have found rocks in them.) I had doubts about the sour cream but think it just made it better. But I won't be making again any time soon. There's plenty of easier bean soups out there.

This was good and full of protein. I omited the ham because I am not much of a meat eater. Still good.

This was okay but I probably won't make it again. The color was not very appealing once I added the sour cream. I was looking for a comfort food type dish but this didn't quite make it for me.

My family loves this soup! When I have the time I do cook it for a little while longer (because I think all bean soup gets better the longer it cooks). Otherwise I cook it exactly as the recipe calls for and it comes out fantastic everytime!! Thanks for sharing.

Instead of soaking your beans over night a faster way is to rinse your beans(you may find little stones in with them)So take the time to rinse and look. Add your beans to 3 or 4 cups of hot water bring to a boil.Boil 2 min sit a side for an hour. Helps with the cooking time

loved the addition of the cream corn and sour cream from other recipes I have tried. The Hubs gave it rave reviews. Make sure you soak the beans for an hour before you make the soup though. I used a smoked ham hock while the beans were cooking then took it out and chopped it up when I added the sour cream and corn. Perfect dinner on a cold winter night.

We really liked this! I wasn't sure if I was supposed to add the spice packet so I did not. Didn't seem to miss it! Nice ham soupy with a hint of sweetness from the creamed corn and creaminess from the sour cream. It's a keeper!

I soaked the beans for much longer (and there was no gas as a result) but the recipe was great. My husband found it meaty-satisfying and it was just plain tasty!

This is a very simple and easy recipe to follow. I soaked my beans for a couple of hours before starting this recipe. The first time I made it I did as directed. The second time I'm adding more ham and a little bit more seasoning. Otherwise this is a very easy quick recipe. The leftovers are amazing!

This was wonderful and very easy. Not sure why some people have such a problem. Sorted and soaked the beans overnight. Drained and added part water and part chicken broth.8 cups of liquid is a little much. Would cut it down to about 6 cups. I did not use the cream corn. I was afraid it would make it too sweet. Did not add the sour cream to the pot but added to individual bowls. This very flavorful and filling. Perfect for chilly days. Will make again.

I’m gonna 5-star this but with some changes. During the covid19 lockdown I used what I had! No corn, but added lots of chopped ham, sautéed onion & celery, carrots and fresh parsley. Seasoned with Twisted Pig seasoning

We loved this soup. Soaked beans, then followed recipe as written.
