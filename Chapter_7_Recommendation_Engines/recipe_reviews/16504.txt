This recipe is very simple to make and REALLY makes a great appetizer!  I am on Weight Watchers so you can lower "Points" by using 2% cheddar, lower fat bacon and mayo with the same results!  Yum.

Delicious and hearty snack!  This recipes is very flexible and easy to change with a bit of grated onion, or a 1/2t. of horseradish.  Cheeses can be substituted as well.  It's great with Swiss cheese in place of Cheddar. They freeze well too. After cheese mixture is spread on the bread, I freeze them on a cookie sheet and when frozen, transfer them to a plastic container or bag.  To bake- just place on sheet and pop into the oven.  (only takes a minute or two longer than fresh.)

Yes this is the best all-time hors d'oeuvre ever.  Add some horseradish instead of the mustard and a dash of sherry, and you will pump up those delicious flavors even more!

This is a great recipe for an easy appetizer! However, it is a bit salty. Next time I will try using the low sodium bacon instead. I also improvised with half of the appetizers by adding one slice of a grape tomato (like a tiny plum tomato) to the top of the bread before adding the mixture. It turned out very tasty, as the tomato stayed firm under the filling. I'm also going to try using this as a filling for my homemade dough. Thanks!

These were simple and fast to make.  Acutally made the "cheese and bacon mix" ahead of time which made it even easier day of ....  They tasted fine, am thinking the pumpernickle bread is a little too strong for mildness of cheese mix.  Next time may try plain crostini or even warm cheese mix in crock pot and use as a dip versus topping.  Will make again but will make changes beforehand.

I have just made my third batch of these for the Holidays and about to make one more for New Year's Eve!  Fantastic reviews from my guests. I did, however, make it easy on myself and used Oscar Meyer bacon bits instead of cooking all that bacon....same flavor!

Yummmmm!  I made this today for the first time...it was a BIG hit!  I only made a single batch, because I was unsure if it would be good.  It was delicious, and I could have used a double-batch, since everyone loved it.  Next time I will def make a double batch.  I did not get 30 pieces-but I was generous with the amount I put on each slice of bread.  I used light mayo and regular rye bread squares-the small ones that come in a 1-pound loaf.  Soooo good!  I highly recommend this recipe, quick and easy...and a crowd-pleaser to boot! :)

I LOVE this recipe!  However, this specific recipe says to place them in the broiler for 5 minutes.  Well?  I burnt the first batch by doing this, I would recommend check them at two and a half minutes and see how they are from there. It was quick and easy!!

I'd say this is would be a five star recipe with a few changes (I've made these several ways). I halved the mayonnaise because they're just too greasy, and I also sub creamy horseradish for the mustard. Oh, and I've done these with bacon I baked (so much easier when doing lots of bacon) and chopped, but I've also done them with real bacon bits--taste exactly the same!

I made these as a quick lunch to go with bowls of tomato soup--kind of like a white trash version of grilled cheese. I added a little onion powder, garlic powder and hot sauce to the mayonnaise mixture before schmearing it on the bread. No. It is unacceptable for me to make these again. Want to know why? Because after I made all of these we ATE. ALL. OF. THESE. Holy cow, were they tasty! Dangerous but delicious.

I made this for a cooking demo a my local grocery store for their Holiday Open House.  They were well received by everybody.  A solid 4 1/2 stars and an easy appetizer for any party.

On top of delicious, very pretty with the dark pumpernickel.  With such strong ingredients:  pumpernickel, bacon and sharp cheese, don't be afraid to use the spiciest mustard available, or it can get absorbed and lost.

My broiler was occupied while I made these, so I put these on a baking sheet at 350 degrees for 15 minutes which worked really well.  My guests loved these!

I made this recipe for New Years Eve get together and had countless raves. Said it was best thing they had tasted in a long time. Also had a suggestion that tomatoes would taste good on top after broiling as it tasted like a BLT. I also used a 8 oz package of bread instead of 1 lb. maybe the 1lb. mentioned in recipe was typo. Will definitely make it again.

These were just ok. Edible, but not very enjoyable. They're extremely heavy and greasy. And I have no idea where the word "puff" comes from! It's just a greasy glob of bacon and cheese on toast. Didn't go over big in a group setting, they barely got touched. I probably won't make again.

I did not really care for these too much the bacon and tomato cups on this site were much better. These were just missing something. My husband ate them and thought they were ok.

Very salty, but good.  I suggest using a very thin layer over the bread to ease the saltiness.

These were wonderful. I took them to a party and they were gone in 5 minutes. LilAngelsMommy, try them again. I have done that with recipes that everyone loved and I didn't. Sometimes I was suprised when I made them for a second time.  Just food for thought!  Good Luck..

I made these for a party and they went over really well. I thought it was good, not outstanding. I have other bacon-cheese appetizer recipes that I really like so I don't think I'll end up making them again.

These were good, but very heavy and greasy. I served them for guests on a Football Sunday, they all seemed to like them but they sat heavy afterwards. Probably will not do them again.

Oh, I simply loved these.  So good I didn't care about the unhealthy factor.  I think they would be good with rye bread as well.  I made a very small batch and it went a long way.  The mix kept in the fridge very nicely.  I will serve these at my next party.

Made these appetizers for my daughter's birthday brunch, and they were gone so fast!  I wish I made a double, or even triple batch!  Everyone loved them, and they were so simple to make.  I made the mixture the night before, and spread it on the bread right before the party.  Delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This made a great appetizer.  I couldn't find the small pumpernickel loafs of bread at the store so I used rye and pumpernickel swirled bread and just cut it into small squares.  I also sprinkled some sliced green onions on top.  Tasted great and they did not last long!

These are fantastic!  I made them for a quick New Year's appetizer.  It worked great!  I used a jar of real bacon bits to make it quicker, and made up the filling the night before.  It was so quick to just pop them in the oven, and they are delicious besides!  I will definatly be making these again.  I already have a Super Bowl request for them.

These were just okay.  The bread was a little soggy, which didn't surprise me with all of these oily/greasy ingredients.  Taste was okay, but I don't think I'll make them again.

Excellent...I made it even quicker by substituting a jar of pre-cooked bacon pieces instead of taking the time to fry bacon.

There is NOWHERE that I take this that it isn't the first thing gone.
So easy, and so good.  I do have a bit different version now after many ways of making it usually because of a request being made and me not having all the ingredients at the time.  But as a result I think it tastes even better (if possible).
I use the Sesame French bread that is sold at Walmart, delish and CHEAP! I also use the sharp cheddar and mix it with Monterey jack cheese.  I have also used smoked gouda with some swiss and boy oh boy is it good.  Also another recommendation is do not skimp an cheap bacon full of grease, use a leaner better brand and you will not be disappointed.  
The point is, flavor is discretionary and what is great to one could be better by another, just use your favs and I bet you will be always asked to bring this too!

This was excellent. I did make a few minor modifications though, two out of necessity. I added chopped fresh jalapenos as I love that combo. I used ciabatti rolls cut into quarters & used the top & bottoms (I live in a very small town, the grocery store by me didn't have the party bread) and spread the cheese mixture then baked @ 400 degrees for 15 minutes. The cheese came out puffy & the bread had a nice crisp on it. I didn't broil, the way the smoke alarms are set up in my rent house when I broil anything my smoke alarm goes off! But everyone loved these, they went quickly!

Just a quick note, in reading some of the other reviews I think some people are only putting in 9 oz of tortellini, hence the "extra" sauce. The recipe calls for two 9 oz pkgs of tortellini for a total of 18 ounces. Try this on for size and see if it doesn't make a nice difference. I LOVE this recipe!!!

Sinfully easy to make and always a fav at gatherings.  I use more bacon than the recipe calls for and extra sharp cheddar.

This is a great and easy appetizer to prepare.  I make a variation of this recipe substituting grated pepperoni for the bacon and adding finely diced green peppers to the mix.  Kids as and adults both enjoy!!!

I served these on Christmas eve and they were a hit with everyone (kids included) even though I used an 8 grain bread (sliced in half).  We don't care for pumpernickel. Would like to know what other kind of bread others might use.

These were fabulous and so quick and easy.  I couldn't find the pumpernickel rounds so just bought a loaf of pumpernickel bread and cut it into 6 pieces. Everyone raved about them and wanted the recipe.  Thanks.

Easy and yummy!  I tried using a small cookie scoop to put the bacon mixture on the bread slices.  It worked to portion equally but the mixture didn't really spread out much so I don't think I'll do that again.  Used a 4.3 oz. bag of real bacon pieces to save time.  We'll be serving these treats during the upcoming holiday season - thanks!

We used to make a version of this back in the 70's.  We used swiss cheese and a little onion with the mayo and baked them on Pinas rye crackers.  Love them!!

I make these all the time, but I add one small can of chopped black olives to the mixture and I do not mix in the bacon.  Instead, once I spread the mixture on the bread I then sprinkle bacon bits on top of the mixture.  I also bake mine at 350 degrees until bubbly rather than broiling.  This is a special favorite with everyone at our parties - especially the guys.  YUM!!

It is really fast and easy.You can add chopped mushrooms and green onions for some additional flavors. Pile it on a baked potato, and rye bread wedges instead of pumpernickel is very good, too.

Had something similar years ago, but instead of bacon, flaked crab or chopped cooked shrimp were added. As I recall, they were delicious and, up till now, I had been unable to locate a recipe for them.  Can't wait to try it.

These were very good. Some of the reviews were not favorable but I had no problems with the recipe and mine even puffed up! I used Italian bread instead of pumpernickle because of personal preference. I also added some green onions and used horseradish sauce instead of mustard. My guest liked them alot and at the end of the night the plate was empty. I'll make them again.

I loved the ease and little time it took to make this meal. I added a fresh jalapeño pepper (finely chopped), 8oz. Of shredded Queso Quesadilla cheese (1/2 or 4 oz for filling and other half for topping), a 10 oz. can of Rotel diced tomatoes with habaneros (with Taco sauce) to "jazz up" my dish and add a little heat. 

This was a "winner, winner, chicken enchilada dinner"!

I used turkey bacon and 2% cheddar cheese and placed it on a thinly slice of my paleo diet-friendly bread. One reader mentioned adding a slice of tomato under the cheese which sounds great.

This recipe was very simple to make. Some tips: I use kitchen shears and cut the bacon before cooking it. Very simple to just cut it right into the pan. I use my small cookie scoop to put it on the bread, it's just the right amount on each one. I use the back to spread it around. I added some garlic powder to it for a little extra flavor. I will make these again and again and again!

This was a very easy and very tasty appetizer. Served at football and it was well received.  Made exactly as directed.  Party bread is not available in my area so I used a hearty pumpernickel I bought in the bakery section of our super market and it did the trick by just cutting into pieces.  A keeper recipe for sure.  Thanks Mike!

So good! We can't stop eating it. I added a diced green onion  into the sauce, but can sprinkle on top for garnish like the pictures show. I have made this several times & will continue to do so.

Five stars from hubby ... I think I would have preferred it without the mustard. Next time ... thinking of adding crabmeat and eliminating the mustard! Yum! OR using RYE cocktail bread, Swiss cheese, and Corned Beef, with maybe sauerkraut in there too!

Just YUM! We did make this on white bread due to my lack of interest in other breads, but it was delish! My husband felt it was too much bacon, but he was heartily voted down by the others at the party. It was pretty salty.

The fact that this was so unbelievably easy to make, gave the flexibilty of using a gluten-free vehicle, and had NYE guests commenting how tasty this was, it's hard not give 5 stars.  Personally, it was a lttle salty for my tastes. can probably make a few modifications on that note.  But overall the perfect quick put together app.

Great and tasty.  They didn't have pumpernickle bread at my grocery store, so I used garlic herb bagel bites.  Pretty good substitution.  Very easy to make and everyone loved them.  Will make this again.

Very tasty!  Nice change for a snack!  I just tried this recipe using what I had on hand:  deli-style sourdough sliced bread, which I cut into 6 pieces per slice, a Mexican blend of shredded cheese, mayo, spicy brown mustard and Oscar Meyer Real bacon bits.  I stirred most of the bacon bits into the cheese mixture and sprinkled just a little bit on top of each bread piece.  In approximately one minute under the broiler, they were puffed, the cheese was nice and melty and the edges of the bread were looking just a little toasty.  They looked nice and tasted yummy!  I will make again with pumpernickel.  Thanks  MIKEC5426 for sharing.

This is about the most addictive treat!! Made it for Easter last year on both pumpernickel and rye party bread squares. I wanted to make this for Christmas Day this year and had the hardest time finding the party breads, so I used those Pepperidge Farms Sandwich Rounds. I cut each into 4 pieces. First batch, I split the rounds open so each made 8 pieces. Second batch I left them together so each made 4. I like them better without splitting them open. Ugh...bad thing is that there are no more!!

Easy & very good.  The kids did not go crazy over them, said they had too much mustard so maybe I'll tweak it next time, but overall they were well received.

This was quick, easy and delicious.  The second time around I put a little less mustard in the mix, because it overtook the other flavors.  I'll be making it again.

These were so easy to make I got my 16 yr old to put them together since I had cooked the bacon the night before. My husband is not a huge fan of pumpernickel and he was sold after one bite. Can't wait to make them again.

This was a BIG hit at our New Year's Eve party.  My executive chef husband LOVED them.  The recipe does not mention green onion, but now that I look closely at the photo, that's what seems to be on top.  Next time I will definitely add them!

I also made this for a New Year's Eve Party.  Quick and easy.  I was able to do the broiling there and they were great hot out of the oven but also good later.  They were a big hit.  Will definitely make them again.
