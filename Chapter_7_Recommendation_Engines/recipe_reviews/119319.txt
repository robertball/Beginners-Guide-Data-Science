So easy...so decadent!  I practiced this one with DH in preparation for a birthday dinner this weekend.  I will try this with a spice cake and apple pie filling (and cinammon) in the fall.  VANILLA ICE CREAM is a must with this.  Lots of room for creative combinations.  Yum!

This was ok for me, it was lacking some zing to it.  I felt the cherries were lost in the rest of the cake.

it's easy and quick, you don't mess all the kitchen and the cake is there: it's not impressive, that's all.
