Great flavor amazing! But mine did not get quite thick enough to use as a pancake syrup. I use over yellow and vanilla cake when I poke holes to infuse the flavor then cover with a light whipped frosting! Its a favorite at family get togethers!

I am now going to make my second batch!  I followed the recipe and got exactly what I was after!  Mixed with maple syrup on top of buttermilk blueberry pancakes, this syrup is yummy!  Thanks, goodeats!  UPDATE:  When I made this a second time, I couldn't get it to thicken up.  But I learned something from my friend, Baking Nana, who wrote this:  Corn starch granules absorb water when heat is introduced, and they start to swell and thicken the mixture. The solution reaches its thickest point at about 175 and 205 degrees F.
As the cooking temperature reaches somewhere near boiling (near 212 degrees F), the starch granules swell to their maximum size and burst open. At this point most of the starch molecules escape into the recipe, releasing the water that had been absorbed by them to be released back into the mixture, resulting in thinning.  So next time I will add the cornstarch at the end!

Excellent!  Great way to get rid of those extra's lemons and it doesn't take that long to do it!  I made it with both sugar and splenda and both taste very good.  We did find the splenda batch separates in the jar when sitting, but once it was shaken everything blended nicely.  It's nice on anything, cakes, ice cream...the list is endless!  Thanks for the recipe!

Great!  Does what it is supposed to do -- add a sweet, lemony flavor!   I used it as a syrup for lemon blueberry pancakes.  I like the lemon flavor a little more than blueberry so I went looking for a lemon syrup and found this one.  I made a half recipe and did not put it in jars but it would make a great Christmas gift.

I made it without the cornstarch and added another cup of lemon juice - perfect lemonade starter for spring and summer.

Fantastic recipe. Great flavour and very refreshing. I did however  go one step further and strained it through a muslin cloth before bottling it.

Nice and easy. Added a little more cornstarch when it didn't thicken enough. It,was a very good recipe.
