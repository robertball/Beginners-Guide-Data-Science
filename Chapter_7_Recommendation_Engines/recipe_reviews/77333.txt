I have used this very recipe for the last 10 years or so. Granted, the cookies are bland. They are meant to be decorated with sugars or frostings. Any sweeter and they would be too sweet to enjoy. Only four stars because they need the decoration, which can be very time consuming depending on the complexity of your designs. Overall, a great, easy recipe for quick holiday cookies!

They are fool proof!  Very soft and taste good.  I used Almond instead of vanilla!  My family loved them!

These are the best cut out cookie ever. I had lost by Eagle Brand cookbook and happily found the recipe here. I love that these cookies are so soft, last awhile if they aren't eaten up before I barely get them decorated and the sweetness, or lack of, perfectly balance all that sugary frosting.

It is dry and soft, like a piece of bread.  The eagle brand milk gives no flavor to this bland cookie.  I tried this recipe thinking it would be a great new recipe, and I was very disappointed.

I loved making and eating these cookies. By not adding sugar to the dough and then using the confectioner sugar glaze it was just the right amount of sweetness for my family to enjoy.

The dough was easy to work with but the cookies were bland and tasteless. They needed sugar or something. 1st suggestion, don't use this recipe. 2nd suggestion, if you do, then roll them thin and use lots of icing.

My kids and I just got done making Santa's cookies.  We wanted to try them to make sure they were good for him.  We couldn't even finish one bite.  I followed the recipe exactly and they were not good.  I never leave bad reviews, but I didn't want anyone else to make bad cookies for Santa.  Sorry!

This recipe handled nicely. The flavor was not what I expected and the texture after baking was harder than expected, but overall a good cut-out cookie that packs well and holds up to gift-giving. I will probably use this one again; my 2-year-old and 4-year-old grand daughters would be able to work with the dough with me. That gives it an extra star rating!

This recipe is very easy and the dough was easy to work with after 2 hours in the fridge.  The cookies also held their shape well.  They weren't very sweet, so they definitely need a glaze or icing to be sweet enough.

One of the best cut out recipes I have ever made. I made these with school age children and they LOVED them.

I've made these cookies for about 10 years. My husband's grandmother has an incredible recipe for sugar cookies, but it's a little involved. The kids have been able to throw these together by themselves which can come in handy when Mom is wrapping presents. Here's some tips...(I agree that they are on the bland side.) Use a nice, classic butter cream frosting made with real butter and vanilla. Bake the cookies on parchment paper and DON'T OVER BAKE! Any cookie that you over bake will taste bland. I look for the first cookie to have a touch of gold and then take them out. If you store them in an airtight container with the frosting on them, they will stay soft and the flavors will meld.
