I was looking for a quick cookie recipe using ingredients I had around the house, and these were very quick and wonderful.  Didn't have almond extract so I used lemon, and they were so light and airy, just very good.  Will make them again!

I followed this recipe, also, and I too, had them melt out of shape.  I added another 1/2 cup of flour (or so, to the right feel) and pressed them again with better results.  They are a VERY TASTY cookie, so it was worth the trouble.  I'll probably use the adjusted version as "spritz"-like cookies with the press.

I followed this recipe to the tee and it turned out as such a disappointment. It didn't hold shape at all and were really mishapen. I was ashamed to serve them for dessert but they were tasty. I rated this a 2 only because it was still tasty regardless of how horrible they looked.

This recipe was ok but cookies turned out more like wafers than fingers.  Pretty tasty though.
Halloween trick - added green food coloring and then tipped one end of the fingers with slivered almonds to make scary "witch's fingers."
