It was pretty good, but the sauce was a little lacking.  I added some bottled alfredo sauce - just a little - and it helped some.  The seafood, mushrooms and asperagus were awesome, and turned out just right.

I prepared it a little different.  More like a stir fry and put it over zucchini noodles.  Enjoyed .

Followed the recipe to a T and I have to say it wasn't the best. I'm really disappointed in how this came out.

Sounded good. The flavors did not blend. Cooking times were questionable; I cooked the scallops as called for and they were over cooked.
