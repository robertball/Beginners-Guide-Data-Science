I tried following the recipe, but just could not get the carrots and potatoes to stick together. So I tried shredding finer. Still wouldn't stick. Added an egg and it was still difficult to get it to stick. I just don't know what I was doing wrong. I was so hopeful that these would be great for the hubby.
