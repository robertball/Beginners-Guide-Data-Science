This was one of the first ways I ever cooked pork. The teriyaki sauce and the molasses work perfectly together. The longer you marinate the pork, the better it will taste. I like to serve this with lap salad or vegetable fried rice.

My husband said these were the best pork chops I've ever made! I marinated for 4 hours and cooked on a grill pan, 10 mins per side was perfect. Thanks for a keeper!

Loved the flavor from the molasses/teriyaki sauce...such a simple idea that turned out great! I cooked them on my charcoal grill, basting with the sauce they were marinated in (for 1 hour).  This one is definitely a keeper...simple and delish! Served with the Parmesan Roasted Grilled Corn and Simple Grilled Vegetables, both from this site...

This couldn't be any easier to make! I marinated for a few hours in the fridge before cooking. Yummy!

Did not have Teriyaki, so opted for thick dark Soy sauce and Molasses... Wow as well. 
Thanks for the idea

Good recipe period. Loved this and will make again. You can add and subtract from this recipe, like adding orange zest ect. But the basic works. Marinate longer than 30 mins. Overnight would work.

I've never cooked with meat other than chicken, so this was a nice, easy, simple-looking option for me to ease in on. It turned out exactly as easy and simple as it looked, and came out pretty darn good too! The marinade only made enough for me to coat the three chops I had, so I might increase the amount next time, but the proportion was lovely.

These were AMAZING!!! I let them marinate overnight and they came out absolutely perfect! My daughter asked for them in her lunchbox the next day, and she usually doesn't like leftovers.  Lol Definitely a new family favourite! Thank you!

These chops were delicious. I used thin, bone in chops. I mixed 2 tbs of teriyaki marinade with 1 tbs of molasses and put them, covered in the fridge for 2 hours. I used cooking spray in a nonstick pan at medium heat for 2 1/2 minutes per side. They were tender and juicy! Great easy recipe. Thank you!!

I mixed the marinade for these in the morning and let them marinate all day. I was very disappointed when I took my first bite after pulling them off the grill and I could not taste the marinade AT ALL. The chops were good.

I didnt try this recipe yet but it  looks really good. Someone made the comment that you suggest baking these but i dont see anywhere where it says that.
