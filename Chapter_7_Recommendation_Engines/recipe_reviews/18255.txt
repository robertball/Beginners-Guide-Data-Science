I originally submited this recipe several years ago.  It has continued to serve me and my family for now nearly 43 years.  I would just like to address those persons who are unhappy because of the name and claim it is not "authentic" Boston Baked Beans.  This recipe was passed to me from my mother-in-law who passed away 11 years ago at the age of 87.  It was her recipe so I don't feel it is my place to change anything about it and still give her credit for the recipe.  She was a wonderful wife and mother who lived in the state of Wisconsin who when younger enjoyed cooking for her family and friends.  To her this was Boston Baked Beans.  She was not a fancy cook so to her, living in the age before computers and cooking websites, this was authentic.  Please just enjoy it and don't get so hung up on the actual name.  I continue to take this to group gatherings that rave about it and ask about the recipe.  To me this is what is important and not the actual name.  I hope many more people will try this and I know you will enjoy it regardless of the name. Copy the recipe, use it,and give it whatever name pleases you.  AJRhodes

I made this successfully in the crock pot.  I soaked the beans overnight, drained them, skipped the simmer-for-2-hours step, and followed the rest of the recipe using the crock pot.  I cooked it on low for 20 hours, and did have to add water periodically.  AWESOME.  thanks you!

Out of all the baked bean recipes I found on this website, this is the only one made from scratch.  I didn't want a "redo" of the canned stuff.  These came out really good and even though you had to plan ahead, they were super easy.  I also added some garlic, and cooked the beans with ham hocks for more flavor.  I tripled the recipe for 25 people and had plenty left over.  Everyone wanted the recipe!  It's a keeper!

Definitely a keeper- I used all of the same ingredients listed in the original recipe, but I wanted to make mine in the crockpot.  I soaked my beans for 8 hours, then simmered my beans for 1 hour.  I layered the beans, onions and bacon in my crockpot, then added a double batch of the sauce.  I added enough water to cover and set on low for 10 hours.  I like my beans thick, so for 2 hours I left the lid off and the sauce thickened very nicely.  I had many requests for this recipe.  I can't wait to make it again for Memorial Day.

This is a great recipe.  I soaked the beans overnight, but skipped the simmering for 2 hrs part and put them straight into the crock pot.  On high, it took about 10 hrs for them to get tender and edible, so if you timed it so that they went in the crock pot before work, they'd be ready to go when you got home that evening, eliminating the need to be home for any cooking.  I pan fried diced bacon before putting it in the beans, to eliminate some fat.  I didn't have dry mustard, and I added some BBQ sauce and smoke flavoring to the mix.  It has a great flavor (just like Bush's Baked beans).  Just don't be in a big hurry to eat it, the beans definitely take awhile!  If you're dying for homeade baked beans, just substitute canned navy beans, and you can skip the soaking and 10 hours of simmering.

This reminded me of my mom's baked beans.  DELICIOUS!  It was my first attempt at making baked beans from scratch, but certainly not the last!  I used Canadian maple syrup instead of molasses, and onion powder instead of onion (I ran out of real onion).  I also saved a couple slices of bacon, fried it until crisp, and crumbled it for garnish - very yummy.  A loaf of homemade bread fresh from the oven topped off the meal.  Just like when I was a kid!

I'm typing and eating at the same time!!!
I didn't bother with the tough parts, you know, adding it all in a casserole dish. I just mixed it all up and tossed it into a crock pot. I also substituted cubed black forest ham instead of the bacon. It worked great. I'll make it again and again.

Good recipe...but I learned a long time ago that when soaking the beans overnight, toss the water that the beans soaked in and rinse the beans thoroughly under cold water -- that eliminates the "gas-causing" effect of some beans.  Just a suggestion...

Perfect flavor and presentation, Anita! I've never had a baked bean recipe be so precise and come out so perfect. In only 3 hours with a stirring half way through cooking time, we had great baked beans! My husband just kept saying "this is a keeper, this is a keeper"! Gee, I think he liked them...;)

I didn't have navy beans, so I used pintos.  Only used the molasses, not the sugar, was plenty sweet. Very good flavor.  I did add some liquid smoke.  Good recipe.

The flavour of this recipe is excellent.  I, like many other reviewers, had never made baked beans from scratch. I'll definitely make this recipe again, including several modifications for our taste. 

We found them too sweet, and would recommend adding a little bit of sugar at a time, to taste, or omitting entirely.  Also, I added about 4 Tsp. tomato paste in addition to the ketchup, wanting a bit more tomato flavour.  That worked nicely and didn't increase the sweetness as ketchup would.  I did not add bacon, as I didn't want the smokey flavour and they were great.  The food processor worked very well for the onions!  Had I fully covered the beans with water I would have found them wet enough.  They were just a little dry this time.  I don't think they need to be cooked for quite as long.  2 hours was more than enough in my oven at 325.
Thanks Anita for a great recipe!

I thought this recipe was great! I didn't change the ingredients at all, despite a few reviews saying it was too sweet. It was NOT too sweet at all. The only modification I added was using precooked bacon that you get at Costco ( didn't have raw bacon). I used about 9 slices. I also added about a teaspoon of liquid smoke.  I soaked the beans overnight, let them boil for about 40 minutes on medium high-until they were firm-not soft. Popped them into the slow cooker on high for about 4 hours with the lid on and removed the lid for another 30 minutes so some of the liquid could evaporate. Everyone in our family really enjoyed this recipe and has begged me to make it again. No more canned beans for me, unless it is an emergency. Thanks for the recipe!!!

Fantastic results-I used maple syrup instead of brown sugar and simmered about 45 min(till just tender, don't over cook or they'll be mushy) after soaking 4 hours and then baking . The key to tender beans is the simmer before putting them in the oven.  If you add your other ingrediants to hard beans they will never go soft no matter how long you bake them as the sugary ingrediants toughen the outer part of the bean if they aren't pre- cooked. My mother in laws were like bullets as she just soaked and then baked until I told her this.

Not a bad recipe, but if you are using dried beans, I would drain and re-rinse after soaking, and keep the cooking water. Why on Earth would you want to use the same dirty soaking water in your food? Beans also contain ogliosaccharides, mostly on the skin, soaking washes that off and thus reduces gas issues.

I would give this 4 1/2 stars, if possible. Being from Boston, I made a couple of slight changes...I omitted the ketchup. I also added a dash of ground cloves. Instead of cooking in the oven, I decided, as others, to use my crockpot...No need to heat up the oven in the hot summer temperatures. I rinsed and covered the beans with water overnight. In my crockpot, I added 3 1/2 cups water, with the beans and all the other ingredients; stirred to combine, covered and cooked on the low setting for 12-14 hours (until the beans were tender and the sauce was thick).  Excellent!

I was 20 years in Maine and this is the closest recipe that I have found that is similar to what my grandfather used to make.  I tried "as is" first and then modified to what I could remember.  I used salt pork instead of bacon.  Much better but you have to salt to taste instead.  I omitted ketchup and worcestershire sauce as I didn't want a BarBeQue bean.  I rated this 4 instead of 5 due to the modicfications.  I upped the brown sugar to 1/3 cup and added one Tablespoon more of molasses.  You could easily add the molasses to taste.  I will definitely make again with the modifications.  This goes great with the Brown bread recipe also on this website.

These beans would have been magnifacant minus the extreme saltyness - we LOVE salty food, but 2 teaspoons was WAY TOO MUCH! I will make this again minus the salt. Dissapointing....

I wanted to recreate my mother's baked bean recipe I forgot the steps.  Mom would lay the onions on the bottom, the beans in the middle and the bacon on top.  I also remember she would take a cup of the baked beans out the last hour of baking.  She would mash this cup of beans and add it back into the baking process.  Other than that, this was much like my mom's.  A keeper!

These beans are the very best! They taste exactly like grandma's beans that take 2 days to make!!!
I left out the bacon because I don't like the smokey flavour.  These only took 1 hour to make!  I used 2 cans of navy beans and I poured them straight into the caserole dish with the onions.  I added the water and the sauce and they were done in no time!!!

OMG these beans have left me wondering how in the world I could have ever thought that canned beans were delicious! These beans were beyond delectable. Although I tweaked the recipe slightly (adding 1/3 c of pure maple syrup, a blop of prepared mustard instead of the dry, and teaspoon of minced garlic), I didn't go far enough out to take the original character out of the dish. The smoked bacon I used added an additional bit of savory depth. My partner pronounced them orgasmic! What could be better on a Saturday night! ;)

My family requested 'vegetarian' baked beans for Easter.  I made this recipe and omitted the bacon.  I know this would be amazing WITH the bacon - but these beans are so good, that honestly, I didn't miss the bacon either. Excellent!!!

Doing these in the crock pot was just great! I was pressed for time, so I did the hurry-up method of cooking the beans rather than soaking them overnight (the hurry-up method being where you boil the beans and then let them soak for an hour), and then I combined all of the remaining ingredients in a crock pot and cooked them for about ten hours (overnight, skipping the step of cooking the soaked beans, and boiling the sauce ingredients together). Also I didn't have mustard powder so I just used a good squirt of yellow mustard. 

I cooked them on low for five hours and realized they weren't getting done, so then turned the crock pot up to high. I probably could have just done high the entire time, as the beans came out just a little tough. Also, I used bacon that wasn't very smokey so I added about a tablespoon of liquid smoke and wished I had added more. I will definitely make this recipe again, though next time I will try more liquid smoke, a little more molasses, and I will boil the sauce down more at the end so that it gets darker and more flavorful.

I had almost given up on making baked beans from scratch; I'm glad I looked one more time and found this one! Very good! I needed them vegetarian, so I left out the bacon and added some liquid smoke at the end. I also made them in the crock pot so I don't add salt until the end either, as it can keep the beans from softening up.

Beans were already tender in step 1, so baking until tender in step 5 does not make sense. All the extra oven time is really all about cooking the meat. Skip the meat, save the planet, and save 2 or 3 hours!

Although good, this is not Boston Baked Beans, so please don't be mislead by the name. Boston Baked Beans are very dark from the molasses and contain no tomatoes or ketchup. This recipe has a distinct tomato flavor to it. I am a New Englander and am still looking for that perfect Boston Baked Bean recipe.

I used a quality thick sliced hickory-smoked bacon and added a small shake of Liquid Smoke. I made no other changes or substitutions. To my surprize, everyone loved this--even my bean-hating husband and two picky boys. Out of this whole recipe, one small serving remains. This will replace my original recipe using doctored up canned beans. These were AWESOME.

I've made this recipe before and it was wonderful! However I appreciated the note from the person whose beans wouldn't soften. Mine wouldn't either this time. However this time I couldn't find dry mustard so I added a little Dijon mustard and I think that's what did it. Since Mustard is made with vinegar the acidity in the mustard didn't allow the beans to soften. I added only about a 1/2 - 3/4 tsp of baking soda to a doubled recipe... and it worked! I didn't want to add too much because I was afraid you might be able to taste it.

Love this recipe!  Such little prep time & so yummy!  I double the recipe, pan fry the bacon (I still put the grease in the bottom of the cassrole dish for flavour, I dont discard).... To a double recipe I add 2 tbsps maple syrup, 2 cloves crushed garlic & 1/2 teaspoon crushed red chili flakes to make it my own & have that Canadian spin!  Super yummy!

I would have give it 5 stars, but it was way too salty.  Next time I make it I will eliminate the salt entirely - the bacon adds plenty while cooking, and you can always add a little more if necessary toward the end.

Super easy and delicious beans.  I soaked the beans overnight and in the morning threw all of the ingredients in the crockpot.  Cooked on high for 7 hours and they came out perfect.  I added a bit of bbq sauce and chili powder.  I couldn't find navy beans in the store so I used northern beans, worked just as well.

Very good. I did use a slow cooker though. Also added some chili flakes for a bit of bite. I find it rather comical that those that disliked it changed the recipe, made it wrong, or complained it takes to long and have to preplan. The whole point is to make baked beans from scratch, if that's not what your looking for buy a can of beans. LOL.

I would have to say this recipe is SPOT ON! I wouldn't change a thing!  I think soaking the beans, as well as, the slow simmer (whether you choose a crock pot or conventional oven) is the way to go!  These classic recipes are what they are for a reason.  I strongly lean toward the more tradional method of oven baking.  We WILL make this recipe AGAIN ... and AGAIN ... and AGAIN!  ENJOY!!

I made this for my husband's birthday party and it was a hit!  Everybody wanted the recipe and loved the taste!  The only thing I did differently was simmer the beans for 1.5 hours and put then in a crock pot on low for 8 hours.  Perfect.  I made a triple batch and there is only a little bit left.  I made it again recently and followed the recipe exactly, except I layered the ingredients in the crockpot without boiling them.  I put it on high for 7 hours, removed the lid and cooked them on low for 1 hour to thicken.  Perfect!

Made these for the first time today and we liked them a lot.  I made per the recipe, except for using 1 tsp. salt instead of 2 tsp.  I simmered a full two hours before baking, and added some of the bean water halfway through because they looked a little dry.  After about 3 1/2 hours, they again looked dry on top, but were pretty "soupy" underneath when I gave a quick stir, so I kept them in the oven uncovered for another 45 minutes or so.  These weren't as sweet as my usual baked beans (which are very sweet), but they were a nice change for me and dh actually liked them better.  They are time consuming, but very little of it is hands-on.  I will make these again.  Thanks for the recipe!

after getting home around six to find all we had to eat was a couple of metts, i wanted to make baked beans, but didn't even have any canned. decided to improvise on this recipe since i didn't have the 5+ hours called for. i made the sauce pretty much as is, except i didn't have molasses so i used dark corn syrup (!) and i cut the salt in half (could have used even less). added a piece of bacon and one slice of onion, chopped. after it simmered for about 10 minutes, i added a can of drained great northern beans to the pot and let it cook 10 minutes more. i had one portion, my husband ate the rest - he loved them! not too shabby for on the fly.

Fine enough recipe and yet, the cooking method disappoints, for me.  I find the texture loses something to the soaking AND boiling AND baking.  These might be better described as "boiled" rather than baked.  A soak over-night is best, with a longer baking time, a whole onion (not diced) and clove (typically pierced into an onion half that's for flavor).  The boiling is useful if an overnight soak isn't possible (a quick soak, often mentioned on bean labels).  But, doing both made the beans to mushy for my taste.  Long, slow baking, covered then uncovered creates a tender but recognizable bean with a sticky, developed sauce.  ether a s

CUT BACK ON THE SALT!  **unless you are in love with salt** I was so happy I listened to the other reviews where it said that as I tend to not alter a recipe the first time I make it.  I cook for 2 people here and halved this recipe and it makes plenty for 2 people.  I also used my "mini" crock pot to make these.  I soaked the beans for a full day and boiled for 2 hours in the evening and put it all together (minus the worcestershire sauce....a personal taste thing) with a tad more brown sugar and let it go all night on the low setting.  I got up and cooked them all day on high and they are very good and not to sweet at all.  SO, if you don't want your oven blasting away all day on a hot summers day then start these a day before and put your crock pot to good use.....the effort will be rewarded.  THANK YOU FOR POSTING this recipe for us to enjoy!

I made a double batch of these beans for a big barbecue party. I cooked the beans in my crockpot before transferring them to my bean pot with the other ingredients. I put it in the fridge overnight and cooked them the rest of the way through the next day. The notion of adding raw bacon felt wrong to me, so I cooked the bacon halfway before adding it to the beans. I probably kept the bean pot in the oven about an hour too long (5 hours instead of 4). When I checked the beans at around 3 hours they still seemed soupy. I lost faith and took the lid off for about an hour to cook off some of the liquid. This resulted in the beans being slightly stiffer than I was shooting for. When I make them again I will trust the recipe (although I will still pre-cook the bacon). This is a really nice recipe that I enjoyed cooking, serving and eating. Thanks!

The beans were tasty, but too much trouble since they taste pretty much the same as canned beans. There was way too much bacon. If I made them again I would cut back to 1/4 pound. Also, cooking beans till tender before assembling, then cooking till tender in the oven too, doesn't make sense. After soaking overnight, I cooked the beans half an hour and that was plenty. I also reduced the oven temperature to 250 degrees, and baked for 7 hours.

Yummy!  Did not have molasses, so used pure maple syrup instead, and frozen chopped onion.  I also made second batch of sauce and added it after an hour.  The only other thing I did differently was to only soak the beans for 4 - 6 hours, simmered for an hour to an hour and a half, then threw in the oven for 2 to 2 1/2 hours.  I probably should have left it in the oven a little longer to fully "melt" the bacon in, but it was just so good when I test tasted, I couldn't wait longer.  Went very well with twice baked potatoes, baby back ribs, and corn muffins.

Amazing flavour.  I put the beans into a pressure cooker with 12 cups of water and cooked it for 40 minutes. The beans were a perfect texture.  I then layered, (Chopped bacon & onion) and added the liquid mixture, but only cooked it for 2 hours.  The taste was the best that I have ever made. Very moist and well recieved with my family.   Thanks!

These were very good; however I did adjust the molasses amount to our personal preference.  We are used to the thick, dark molasses flavored beans.  I add approximately ¼ cup of molasses and a sliced onion when I doctor a can of baked beans so needless to say 3 Tablespoons for a large crock was not going to work for us.   I added additional molasses and reduced the amount of salt and followed the remainder of the instructions of the recipe and achieved terrific results.

These beans were great with a few changes. I doubled the molasses mixture (except the salt) and added 1 tsp. of liquid smoke. There was no need to add water during cooking. I also used salt pork instead of bacon. The beans were full of flavour and were a rich brown colour. I got rave reviews!

Delicious! Will make again and again. Recipe doesn't say to, but we cut our bacon up into chunks before adding to the beans. Mixed night before and stuck in oven the next day. Worked great!

I've been looking for a recipe for Baked Beans for a long time and they always call for canned. Finally I came upon this ine and it is delicious. Unlike many of your reviews I used this recipe with no changes. I served it to guests and they all gave it high marks. This recipe is now in my collection filed under the highly used column.Homemade beans do not even compare to canned beans.Thanks.

Tasty! For  those who complained about mushy beans. I believe it maybe the quality of the beans you brought. I have made more dry beans than I care to try and count and they never came out mushy....until today AND  I noticed it right after soaking them.  I couldnt even boil them the 2 hours the recipe calls for (they were already too soft). I used the quick soaking method (bring to a boil and set aside)rinsed them, mixed in the other ingredients as the recipe calls for and baked for an hour - 90 minutes. half the time uncovered. It still came out great. I didnt have molasses or brown sugar so i just added about 1- 1 1/2 cups white sugar. turned out great. family loved it, just talking about it makes me want more.

This is my new favorite baked bean recipe. Only thing I changed out was the bacon - my husband's a vegetarian - so I substituted with a little canola oil and liquid hickory smoke, which provided the flavor and texture bacon would have added.  Very kid friendly recipe.

I made this recipe, to feed 24, for a church picnic and everyone absolutely loved them! I skipped the part about simmering and went straight into the crockpot. I let them cook about 20 hours on low and the response was so overwhelming that they had scraped the crockpot clean! We have another event coming up at the church and I was asked to bring these again, only in a larger quantity, so that those who did not get any last time have a chance this time. Definitely a keeper!

Great recipe!!! Delicious!!! I did not change the ingredients and it was perfect. I used a slow cooker, so I soaked the beans overnight then simmered for an hour, rinsed and cooked on high for 6 hours. Very tender and flavorful. I found the simmering for one hour key. if near the end of that you let the water evaporate and lightly brown the beans before slow cooking, they give off a wonderful aroma and smokey taste. No need to add smoke flavor.

These beans turned out exactly as I had hoped they would.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Plumb tender beans, full of flavor and a perfectly seasoned broth. This really hit the spot.

I'm so angry with myself for not actually baking these in the oven (it was SO hot here, I wimped out).  I tried the crockpot method - it worked, but without (duh - slaps forehead) that lovely *baked* taste.  Flavor is outstanding.  Making again tonight - in oven

These are so good. I doubled to sauce and it made the perfect amount. Next time I will try half brown sugar and half maple syrup.

This was great!  I have a secret addition though that makes everyone go wow!  What is in here that's different?  Depending on amount made I grate on large apple with the skin on, it is delicious.  Adds great flavor.

This was a great recipe, just the right amount of sweetness.  I would make sure to simmer the beans long enough in plenty of water.  I stirred the beans halfway through cooking to avoid drying out the top layer.

Ever since moving back to New England, I've been dying to make real baked beans for my Miamian boyfriend.  I tried this recipe and it came out great except that the beans were a little dry.  That was completely my own fault, but I'd never made beans before so didn't know that I would need to soak my beans in LOTS of water so I'd have plenty of liquid for cooking.  Let this be a caveat to future bean cookers!  Otherwise, these were wonderful!

These beans were just sweet enough, it's the flavor I've been looking for without the long wait and without the mess.  I used a mild flavored molasses.  My family
 simply loved them.

This is a great recipe for homemade beans. The only change I do is omit the ketchup. No self-respecting Yankee I know adds tomato to their beans (just not our thing). Other than that...yum!

Excellent recipe! Everyone who has tried it loved it! It was too hot to cook this in the oven so I found that the crockpot worked well. I even cooked the beans there first. Less pots to wash and much cooler was to cook on hot days! The only change I made was to replace my favorite barbeque sauce instead of the ketchup.

First time making Baked Beans from scratch. Had them for a Memorial Day party. Everyone said they were awesome. My son said they tasted like Bush's. Added no salt, 3/4 lb of bacon, for the ketchup I used half ketchup and half BBQ sauce. Then 10 hrs in crock pot.  Thanks for a great recipe.

May I say...oh my god...lol. This was my first attempt at homemade baked beans, and I was nervous...and as I was making it, I second guessed myself a few times. But if you make this recipe..TRUST IT! I changed nothing, but did not add as much salt as it called for, only because I do not add salt in many things, however, next time, I will do exactly as it calls for. I had a long day so just stuck it in the oven on a lower temp (225°F) and put it in a bit earlier. It has just come out of the oven now, and of course, I had to taste, and it was fantastic! Just waiting for my rolls to finish, and supper will be served. The only thing I would do differently is double the recipe, because I feed myself, hubby and 4 kids....am thinking on trying to jar this to make as a quickie supper on soccer nights and such. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was a great start, but I found the spice amounts minimal, and therefore bland.  I upped the Molasses to 4 T., the ground mustard 2 T., and the Salt to 2 T. With those changes, I found it lovely!

These turned out fantastic.  I thought it was going to turn out too sweet but it really came out just right.  I made this one for my folks and they were raving about it.  Instead of soaking the beans overnight I used the quick-soak method you can find on the back of most bags of beans.  Maybe next time I'll add some diced ham!

This recipe was very good. I made it to go with Christmas dinner and it was a hit. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 of what it called for because I was worried it would be too sweet. I also left out the bacon. It was great!

This is a great recipe, which I'm actually making for the second time right now. I vary it somewhat; I leave out the bacon (this time I'm going to use some Liquid Smoke to see if I can recreate a bacon-y flavour), and I'm thinking of modifying the amount of molasses and brown sugar just a tad so there isn't so much sugar in it. However, it's a great base for experimenting with homemade baked beans, and I'm glad I found it..! Top-notch recipe.

I double the batch size and I used 2 LB's of dry pinto beans for this recipe. I soaked them over night in quart size ziplock storage bags. I cooked the beans on the stove top in a large pot. I used the soaking water plus I added enough water to cover the beans (about 2 inches above beans) for cooking.cooked the beans in water on medium low heat covered with a lid for about 2 1/2 hours. I drained the cooking water and added the dry ingredients and mixed well. I added a little water so the beans mixed well in the pot are were not so dry.

These are some of the best baked beans I've ever had. Very delicious, I would give it more than 5 stars if I could.

These take a SUPER long time to cook in the crock pot. They tasted ok. I did have to add more brown sugar, salt and mustard. I cooked them for about 11 hours and they still weren't completely done. I would recommend cooking them the day before that way they are sure to be done and taste good!

Loved the flavor of these, but could not get the texture of the beans right.  The first time I made them, I ended up with very tough beans so I tried them a second time with more boiling time and ended up with the texture of refried beans.  This is probably my issue, but the flavor was great so I'm going to keep trying!

I'm sorry but I did not care for this recipe. I doubled it exactly but I found there wasn't enough sauce, even once water was added. Water kept diluting the flavor! The beans lacked depth of flavor, all I could taste was the mollasses so I added liquid smoke which helped a tiny bit. If you follow this recipe's directions for cook time you'll wind up with soggy beans. Will not use again.

Excellent! I used wild boar side bacon from the farmers' market and doubled the recipe. I served it both for a birthday dinner and brunch (almost 30 people in total) plus had a lot left over. They didn't make it to the freezer though, they got eaten over the next few days. I had a lot of rave reviews!

I love making this recipe. I have always cooked the beans in the oven but this last time I put it all in the crockpot after the simmering method. This worked out just as well and took about 7 hrs on low for the beans to get tender. I also add more of the ketchup and spices as I like it saucey.

Excellent recipe.  I didn't have time to cook the navy beans from scratch so I used two cans of navy beans, drained them, reserving some juice, which I ended up not using.   I also substituted maple syrup for the Molasses.  I cooked them till bubbly, about 45 minutes.....absolutely delicious!!

This is soooooo good and easy! I confess however I have a pressure cooker so I didn't soak the beans I just cooked for aprox. 40 min before throwing in the oven. I don't know why would anybody buy canned baked beans, unless they are camping ;)

This is a great baked bean recipe.  Although it really bugs me when someone does a review with all kinds of modifications, I had to make one modification out of necessity...I substituted 1 tbsp Dijon mustard for the dry mustard as I had none.  I also crisped the bacon first to get rid of some fat.  They were delicious, even better the next day...this is the baked bean flavor I remember as a kid.

These were wonderful! I also wanted to cook in the crock pot, so I soaked dried beans overnight for 8 hours, drained, then simmered in new water for 1 hour. Transferred beans to crock pot. Sauteed bacon and onion, chopped up the bacon and added it to the crock pot. Then I heated a double batch of the sauce on the stove and added it to the crock pot. I doubled everything but the salt, I used 3 tsp. Added a little bit of water, maybe 1/4- 1/2 cup and let it simmer on low for 9 hours. During cooking I added a little bit more ketchup, as I thought it was a little too sweet. next time I'll maybe subtract 1 TBS molasses and maybe a little brown sugar. My husband and even picky step daughter went back for seconds.

We make lots of baked beans in our house because my son takes them for lunch at school every day.  We decided to try a new recipe, and found this one to be a bit on the tangy side.  If you like a sweet baked bean, you may need to add some extra sugar or even some maple syrup.  The nice thing is that you can taste the sauce after a few hours of cooking and adjust as you see fit.  They DO carmelize nicely towards the end, though, so don't go overboard with the sugar midway through the cooking.

I read many recipes that required so much sugar and I really was against making something with lots of sugar.  I came across this recipe and after reading its ingredients figured I'd give it a try.  I doubled the recipe to make sure I had enough for all the people coming over for Independence Day.  It was about 11am on the day I needed these for 7pm dinner, so I decided to pull out the handy-dandy pressure cooker and cooked my dry beans for 30 min in the pressure cooker (just as good as soaking overnight and cooking them for 2-3 hours until tender, but only takes 40 minutes.  Outside of that I also wanted to cut down on the fat content so I diced up my bacon, fried it til crisply, then rinsed the bacon in colander with hot water.  Good healthy way to rinse the fats away from cooked meats that are not lean.  Other than that I followed the recipe to the letter.  It was wonderful.  I think next time I will experiment with a bit of fresh garlic (just cause Im not one to adhere to a recipe, and enjoy the "creative" aspects of cooking) - So please feel free to use this recipe, you will not be disappointed, lower in sugar than most recipes, and if you wash your bacon, you also lower the fat content exponentially

This was an OK recipe for me. I made it as is, but found when it was done it tasted OK.  My husband and I thought it needed a little something. I rated the recipe as written a 4. Maybe I was used to all the beans from my family get togethers that are sooo good. They were all the doctored up canned baked beans though and I wanted one from scratch so I tried this one. So this recipe provided a good starting point for me and then I just changed it for my family's tastes. I added an extra TBS of molasses, an extra 1/2 C ketchup, an extra 1/4 C brown sugar, an extra 3/4 tsp. dry mustard, added 2 T vinegar and 1/2 tsp. garlic powder. This made it to my family's liking. I found I only needed 1 C of water with this recipe in my crock pot and it worked well and didn't dry up. I have made my version of this recipe a second time and will make it again as well as serve these at my sons graduation party.

This is an easy and delicious recipe.  Though it takes a long time, it doesn't really require much effort on your part (other than being home to monitor).  I made a vegetarian version with fake bacon and vegan Worcestershire sauce.  Two other things I changed:

1) Ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and veggie bacon already have a lot of sodium.  To reduce sodium in the dish for health reasons, I skipped the 2 tsp of salt and instead just sprinkled a little salt (less than 1 tsp) in the water in which I simmered the beans.  It tasted fine, salt-wise -- not bland at all.

2) I was always taught that you should not cook beans in the same water in which they were soaked.  There may be good reasons for cooking them in the same water for this particular kind of recipe.  I am a novice cook -- I don't know.  But still, I followed the earlier advice and drained and rinsed the beans after soaking, and cooked them in fresh water.  This worked just fine.

I simmered my beans for a little over an hour initially, and I wondered if I would really need to bake them for a full 3-4 hours after that.  Based on some of the earlier comments, it sounded like they might end up overdone this way.  But it really did take 4 hours in the oven before the beans were tender.  One thing I will change next time: I will wait until towards the end to put in the veggie bacon.  It is not like real bacon, and it gets overcooked when you bake it for 4 hours.

Too salty between all the bacon and the 2 teaspoons of salt.  Disappointing.  I followed the directions exactly, added extra liquid when needed.  Just way too salty.

I loved this recipe :) the only thing I changed because I wanted to make it vegetarian was, 3 TBSP Diana's Gourmet Western Smokehouse BBQ Sauce.  and 3 TBSP of Diana's Gourmet Original BBQ Sauce. My father loved them :) They turned out great. Thanks :)

This is the first baked bean recipe I've ever found that didn't include a can of baked beans, and it's also the first I've ever made that worked!  I thought I would be able to cheat by using canned beans, and cut some time off the baking; nope.  You need the full 4 hours (or more) for the sauce to reduce to the appropriate thickness.  I served this with cornbread and for us, it didn't quite make a meal, but it might have if I'd served a few veggie dishes along with it.  Thanks!

I love homemade baked beans and these are pretty close to what my mother cooked. She used ham hock instead of bacon and pinto beans but everything else is the same. Oh yeah, hers won't as sweet but very good.

Excellent.  My mother had a homemade bean receipt in her head.  I would always try to ask how she made it but could ever get the way she did it. Baked beans was her favorite meal. When she passed away the year I made these beans for her memorial supper for my family.  They were a huge hit and tasted very similar to moms.  Thanks so much for having this Recipe and I found it.

When the sauce ingredients were mixed together with the liquid of the beans the taste was great but as soon as they reduced it became a cloying oversweet taste. I'd reduce the saucce ingredients by half, also the bacon as it's about the beans and a 2-1 bean to bacon ratio is too low. Also the beans were over sweet. Next time, I'm adding half the bacon, half the salt and half the sweet stuff. To recap, too salty and too sweet.

I left out the 2 teasoons of salt altogether, as it was completely unnecessary with all that bacon and ready-made sauces.

On the sugar front, against by better instincts, I followed the recipe faithfully. It was like some kind of candied bean dish, and virtually inedible.

If I were to do this again, I would eliminate the brown sugar entirely, or perhaps just put in a pinch. And I would swap out the tomato ketchup for a tin of tomatoes. I'd also add in some celery to enhance the savoury element. I don't care whether that's authentic; 

I'm in the UK and have never had this dish cooked by an American, but I did Hugh Fearnley-Wittingstall's version of this dish from his Meat cookbook a few years ago. That one was enjoyed by my American flatmate at the time. But to me even that dish was on the sweet side.

Really easy and so good.  My mother and grandmother always refresh the water after the soaking.  It is believed to reduces the "gassy" effect of the beans.  Also adding a little bit of baking soda will reduce the same side effect.  The only draw back is the beans will not be as dark but the flavor remains

The first time I cooked this in the slow cooker for about 20 hours on low.  I have a newer crock pot, so they're a bit hotter than the older ones.  20 hours on low was way too long.  The weren't burnt, but they definitely didn't taste as good as they did after the 10 hour mark.  I now cook mine for 10 hours on low and it's perfect.  If you're doing this in the slow cooker, you may need to test this recipe a couple of times to get the cooking times right, because the temperatures of slow cookers vary quite a bit.

I am a foodie for sure! This recipe is the best recipe for baked beans I have found. I make them a couple times a year for years now. You can always tweak it a bit to suit yourself but this baby works! Something about making that sauce does it. It adds a depth and another level of flavour.  I put less bacon because I don't want so much fat. This recipe is absolutely delicious. Kudos!

I would give this more stars if I could. I make this for the company picnic every year and every year the entire 6qt pot is eaten.  I do mine in the crockpot and I don't soak the beans first because I find the beans get too mushy. Great recipe.

I love this recipe. The beans are delicious. I found soaking the beans over night then simmering them for an hour then baking them for an hour got them done perfectly.

I made these beans last year at our annual picnic, I tripled the recipe since we have about 30 people that show up.  After I was done cooking everything, I thought it looked like too much, but by the end of the picnic they were gone! (I was really hoping for leftovers too)  This recipe is simple and the outcome is fantastic!

I make this will molasses cured bacon.  Delicious.  Make sure to add enough liquid to the beans--otherwise, you don't end up with much sauce.

Delicious!  Soaked the bean overnight and put everything in the crock pot the next day on high.  It was done in about 8 hours.  They taste just like bush's but better!

I did not simmer my beans long enough and after 10 hours in the crock pot they were still tough.  I did some research and read that baking soda would help with the simmering water.  I decided to add 1 tsp to the already prepared recipe.  What did I have to lose?  I cooked them another hour on high, with the lid off and it worked!  Very delicious!

Thank you! Finally a recipe that isn't doctoring cans of baked beans. The only things I did differently was to cook the bacon first. This recipe is perfect for us. Not overly sweet.

I soaked the beans for the day, use maple syrup istead of molasses and thro everything into the crock pot - cook on low for 20 hours.  I removed the lid for last 2 hours to thicken.  Delicious.

Pretty good but I thought it a little bland.  Also, this is NOT a recipe for any of you who are on sodium restricted diets.  Per serving, this recipe boasts a whopping 1300+mg. That's more than two teaspoons(!!) of salt per serving.   I'd omit adding any salt, opt for low sodium bacon and add less of it in favor a little olive oil to replace the fat, and maybe swap out the Worcestershire for smoked paprika were I to make it again.

4 stars because I felt like it needed a little something. Turned out the something was about 1/4 tsp of liquid smoke. Excellent recipe though and will use again!

absolutely delicious!  Cooked mine in a crock pot for 8 hours and they were a bit overdone.  Next time, if I do them in the crock pot again, I won't pre-simmer them.  I think pre-cooking is only needed if you're baking them in the oven for less time.  If you have the time to cook them all day, soak them over night and skip the pre-simmer step.  Oh and I used regular mustard instead of dry-- just squirted it in there to taste.

What a very nice recipe. It is simple to prepare and very satisfying to the taste buds.                (My modifications are as follows) I used a couple Tsp. of tomato paste and the ketchup as the recipe calls for and added 1 chopped green pepper as well as Maple syrup because I did not have the molasses. It was a nice treat to have here in Italy and was a joy to serve to all my Italian friends. I will make this again. Very nice recipe once again.

I have made this a few times  but never in the oven, yet, just too hot. I have done in crockpot overnight and all the next day, and also used pressure cooker to cook beans then simmer.  I also can't remember to buy molasses so instead of brown sugar I used muscovado which has a higher molasses content than brown.  One minced jalapeno per each recipe adds another layer of flavor without being too hot. Go ahead and double or triple so you have some to freeze, these are so good they don't last.

I *adore* baked beans. In an effort to avoid canned food additives and preservatives, I decided to look into finding a recipe I could make from scratch. THANK YOU AJRHODES3 for this recipe. YUMMMM! Like some others, I cooked them in a crockpot on high for six hours instead of the oven, removing the top the last 2 hours of cooking to help thicken. The only thing I would do differently next time is leave out the salt. The bacon adds enough salt for those of us who are sensitive to it.

When hundreds of people say a recipe is good and I didn't like it I'm willing to admit it's me, not the recipe.  Still, I found the beans seriously overcooked before I'd finished simmering them, so I started over with a new batch.  This time I only simmered them about 30 mins and baked them about 1.5 hours.  I also doubled the sauce, which is delicious.

Absolutely wonderful!  Only change I made in the recipe was that I didn't have enough bacon so I added about 1/2 cup diced ham.  After they were cooked they didn't seem very "saucy" so I added about 1/4 cup quality bbq sauce.  That did it.  They are by far the best baked beans I've ever had!

I was so excited about this recipe.  This is the second time I've tried making baked beans in my lifetime (using navy beans) and I just can't seem to get the knack of it!  Half of my beans are always hard even though I soak them for 8 hours and then put them in a roast pan in the oven for 4-5 hours.  What am I doing wrong?  I researched how to soak the beans, and the pros said that first you sort out the bad ones, soak the beans for no more than 8 hours or you could ruin that traditional bean 'texture' and throw out the water when cooking (it will have dirt and chemicals in it, plus it removes some of the gas-inducing essence from the beans, while losing next to none of the good vitamins and minerals).  Maybe simmering will help afterwards before putting in the oven?  Anyhow, we're going to look for a milder sauce as this one was a little spicy for our liking.

These are good.  I soaked them overnight and then skipped the boiling step and made them in the crockpot.  They were on low for 10 hrs and done, so my crockpot must run hotter than some of the other reviewers. Next time I think I will add less salt, but other than that this recipe is pretty easy and has good results.

I'm originally from Cape Cod.  My mother used to make these beans when I was growing up.  I tried this recipe as is and couldn't find anything wrong.  It brought me back to my childhood.  EXCELLENT!  I have made these twice now and will definately make over and over.  I used the crock pot.

YUMMMMMY! Was the consensus when these hit the table.  Only thing I did differently was, I was out of dry mustard and used 1 squirt of Dijon, and I didn't have molasses and used a good squeeze of dark golden syrup.  Definately going to make these again.  Thank you for sharing.

It was so nice to find a recipe for baked beans that did not start with a can of  baked beans already! And these came out wonderfully! It's not too sweet, very evenly flavored, with none of the 'processed' under-taste you get from a can. I subbed in two cans navy beans because I found the recipe last minute, and it was still great. It took about 1 1/2 hours, uncovered for the last half hour to get it nice and thick and gorgeous. Next time I will use dry beans and I am sure they will still be wonderful. I served them with pulled pork sandwiches and corn pudding. I think I may have to try canning this at home so I have it on hand quick.

These were very good.  I did make them just as the recipe said, and they turned out fine.  I even used an authentic, old bean pot!  I will probably use my crock pot next time, but I just had to use the old bean pot the first time.  I will also make them barbecue flavor next time.

Great baked bean recipe! Like some of the other reviewers I worried that the sauce was enough to cover the beans. When you mix it all together it's a very light brown color and very soupy, but as it cooks it gets nice and dark and thickens. Nice recipe and it smell wonderful!!

I was in a hurry and had to use canned pinto beans instead and it was great! I cooked the bacon and onions together in one pan and made the sauce in another. I rinsed and drained the pinto beans, mixed them with the bacon, onions and sauce and it tasted great!

This have good flavor, the only thing that I changed was making sure that the bacon was fried up first, to be able to keep it low-fat.  I also added some hamburger to liven up the flavor, too.  I like my beans on the sweeter side so I also added a bit more brown sugar.  You could also sweeten up the beans by adding a bit of maple syrup.  I was embarassed by how many people asked for the recipe at a large get together recently.  There just beans, but a huge, huge hit.

This is a wonderful recipe - tastes just like my Mom's! I would recommend cooking them for 6-8 hours at a low temperature in the oven 325 or so. You will have to add more liquid as they cook but they will develop a deep brown colour and an amazing flavour - worth your time!

I'm sorry but nobody liked this recipe at my house. I have never made beans from scratch before, this just wasn't what I was expecting. I found the sauce kind of vinagary (maybe the ketchup or worcestershire sauce), but I think I would like it better with a darker, richer, sweeter sauce. I'll try one with maple syrup next time.

This is a keeper!  I made this for the first time this weekend and followed the recipe exactly as written.  I was so pleased with the outcome, and everyone at the BBQ raved about the dish.  The only thing I had a problem with is the size of the dish for final assembly.  The recipe suggests to use a 2 qt. bean pot or casserole dish, and I had to use something bigger in order to have room for the sauce and bean juices.  (Now, I know!)

This recipe was pretty good! I've never made baked beans and I'm really impressed with the outcome.  I ended up soaking my beans for almost 2 days (couldn't find a long enough time i was at home) While I was preparing everything it slipped my mind that we had no onions!  So I subtituted with onion powder.  I also didn't want it to take too long so i did a quick shortcut to boiling the beans in a pressure cooker for 10mins, And boy was i relieved it wasn't mush when i opened it! It actually turned out pretty well. There was some that was mushed up but it's something you could expect even when just boiling it and stirring so it wouldn't stick at the bottom. I shoule have lessened the time to maybe 8 mins, but i was pretty content with the outcome. So for you who have pressure cookers and want to cut back on 2hours of cooking time, i suggest 8-10 mins in the pressure cooker.  I thought i could also shorten the time while baking...but after 2 hours in the oven (and a bowl of the beans down my tummy) i decided that it wasn't quite done. So i set the timer for an hour and 15mins more and viola!  The husband loved it and so did I! The center turned out with little to no sauce when I served it, so instead of layering all the beans at the bottom, at suggest doing 2 layers of beans and sauce.  It turned out dryer than i expected but you can remedy that with a tad bit more sauce and the water you boiled the beans in. Great Job Anita! Thanks for sharing.

My first baked beans in my new Lodge dutch oven. The flavor was excellent. One tip: keeping it in the fridge dries it, so freeze it.

You DO need the time for slow cooking but these beans are definitely worth it - in a word "GREAT"!  Start mid-morning and you've got a wonderful dinner dish - my husband especially enjoys the aroma as they bake!  "Mama Mary"

I have not tried this recipe yet. You say "Bake for 3 to 4 hours in the preheated oven." I am a novice cook, and I am not sure what temperature exactly to bake at. I am guessing 200 or 250, but I want to be sure. Could you clarify please. Thank you. Selen

I made this recipe with canned kidney beans after stumbling across something quick and easy. The result was phenomenal, though in hindsight the bacon should've been browned first-I'm still new to a lot of cooking. 

I'll be making this again for 4th of July weekend, though this time it will be entirely from scratch. Family has requested that I keep it to kidney beans, and I will be removing the salt. With so much bacon, there's very little need for the added salt. Definitely a favorite and extremely easy to make.

Just made these and the flavor is great!  I followed the recipe exactly, and the only comment is the skins on the beans are a bit tough, but I read that adding salt to the soaking water helps with this.  Will try that next time and leave the salt out of the sauce to compensate.  Great recipe.  Thanks!

I have searched and searched for a real baked bean recipe and was so happy to find this.  Because real baked beans take a couple of days to prepare, with the soaking etc, my son and I make a huge batch and can it so we can enjoy these yummy beans any time without the extra work.  For canning we make extra sauce, fill the jars 2/3- 3/4 full of the bean, sauce, onion & bacon mixture then add more sauce to leave 1 inch of head space and can according the directions that came with our pressure canner.  In fact, we're working on a batch as I write this! Yum.

I found this to be a great tasting and simple recipe (although time consuming when using dry beans). I totally ignored all the baked bean recipes that included canned baked beans as an ingredient since I believe that is simply a modification and not an actual recipe on its own. 
The only change to the ingredients I made was that I cut the amount of salt in half and will most likely eliminate it all together the next time I make this. Between the bacon, ketchup and Worcestershire sauce, the sodium content is well covered.
Although it may seem like I should not give it 5 stars based on my comments, all I can say is that the taste and texture (not thin and runny like the canned versions)suited me very well.

My sister makes a baked bean dish that everyone loves. However, I've never made baked beans from scratch before. I've been hungry for them and this recipe looked like a good one to try!

At the start I decided to double everything. I rinsed the navy beans then set them to simmer for 3-4 hours on the stove, until they were tender. After that I drained them and transferred them to a crock pot. At that point I added all the ingredients mentioned with the addition of 1/2 lb. of browned hamburger. I added more brown sugar and molasses to taste. In error I didn't reserve any of the bean water but I never needed it. They are the perfect consistency and taste WONDERFUL!  
I will add that I left them in the crock pot over night on a low setting.

I am not from Boston so I cannot say if these beans conform to their style, but I am from Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, and I will say that these beans are pretty  close to perfect. The only adjustment I made was I put 1 of the tsp salt in the simmering water with beans, and the other tsp with the sauce, and, added 3 more tbsp molasses than it called for. I simmered for 1 hr. These beans are perfect!!!  Thank you indeed very much!

I have made this recipe at least 8 times and it is always a crowd pleaser.  I have made it exactly as printed more than once. The directions are perfect and the beans turned out well each time.   I have done it in the crock pot lots of times.  My whole family prefers this method.  The beans hold their shape a little better and it always seems to fit my schedule better.  I follow J.P.'s suggestions: I made this successfully in the crock pot. I soaked the beans overnight, drained them, skipped the simmer-for-2-hours step, and followed the rest of the recipe using the crock pot. I cooked it on low for 20 hours, and did have to add water periodically. AWESOME. thanks you! Whichever way you you try it you'll be a happy hostess.  It's the best.

I have made this twice now.  It's amazing!  I usually take a shortcut and use canned navy beans.  6 14.5 ounce cans Navy Beans is about the same as a 2 cups dried beans.  I rinse the beans well and then follow the recipe as written.  That is really the only change I've ever made.  Everyone loves these and they are delicious as left overs as well.  Perfect to take a long to a pot luck or BBQ!

This is my favorite baked bean recipe! I have made this recipe several times and as one user suggested-I double the sauce ingredients (but not the salt).  I soak the beans overnight-but skip the simmer step.  Then they go straight into the crock pot to save the fuss.  I have found that it takes about 8-10 hours in the crock pot on low.  Well worth the wait!  Thanks for sharing AJRHODES3!

It is best to fry the bacon and cut into pieces prior to baking.

This was the first time I had ever made baked beans, and I was preparing it for a group that includes a vegetarian and a person on a no-salt diet. In place of salt, I used Zesty Mrs Dash, and I just left out the bacon. Also, I couldn't find "navy beans" at the store, so I ended up getting kidney beans. (Afterwards, I looked it up and found out that "navy beans" and "white beans" are the same. Oh, well.) Anyway, I made this in the crock pot, and everyone in my group DEVOURED it. Even the guy from Boston said they were really good. 

Thank you for providing an excellent base recipe for me to work off of. I will definitely be making this again. And yanno, I'll probably stick with the Mrs Dash. It tasted great. :)

Wanted a from-scratch recipe like grandma's.  This did it.  Yummy!  Yes it takes some time, as do all dry bean recipes.  Very flavorful.  Again...yummy!

These beans had a wonderful flavor.  I made the recipe as printed except I added a little extra brown sugar because I like the sweetness. I found the recipe way too runny the first day. I really don't blame the recipe though because I think I added too much soaking water. However, the taste was wonderful and especially the leftover beans were perfect re-heated.

Tasted just like the stuff you buy from a can but much better as it's made from scratch and with love.  I skipped the soaking process the 3rd time I made it because the first 2x I made it they were a little mushy.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!  Love it.

This was my first time making baked beans and they came out GREAT! I followed the recipe exactly. Wasn't sure if you were supposed to chop up the bacon, and I did. I actually feel like the 4 hours could have been cut back to 3... The beans are borderline mushy. Maybe this is because I soaked (overnight 6 hours) or simmered (a full two hours simmering) them for too long because I have never made them before! I didn't have to add more water halfway through, either. I can't wait to make them again! This recipe is a keeper!

I make this when I make ribs and they are always a hit.  I also skip the simmer process and let the beans cook in the crock pot for 10 hours on high and they are just as good as the original method.

The taste was great, but the sauce was a little too thin. I recommend using a lot less water when you bake them if your beans are already cooked. They were easy to make, but I will definitely be adjusting before making again.

this is an amazing recipe, let me start by saying 2 cups of dry beans yeilds like 6 cups

i used pancake syrup instead of molasses and also used dark brown suger (higher molasses content and a deeper flavor), I changed the servings from 6 to 24 and did a big batch, using 2 onions and 1 pack of bacon

the first time I made this I used 6 cans of beans on a 3x sized recipe, and I used great north, navy, and kidney beans, which made for a nice contrast of textures, the canned bean water also works well

I have a 2nd batch in the oven now using only great northern beans bought dry and soaked overnight (10 hours), this is the 24-serving batch and will go nicely with the brisket in my grill

I soaked them for almost 14 hours, and then baked them in the oven for almost 5 hours. I continued to have to add liquid yet the beans didn't seem to get as soft as we like them. The flavor was wonderful, but next time I need to figure out how to get them softer.

This is a wonderful recipe! It is somewhat time consuming, but is well worth the time.  I made these thinking that 2t of salt was too much, but the beans absorb some of the salt and after they were done, it was not too much. I substituted BBQ sauce for the ketchuo to give them more of a barbecue flavor.  My only negative remark would be that it was hard to judge how much of the bean water to put over them. I have printed the recipe and will definitely make these again!

Excellent Recipe. I tried it in a crock pot with the navy beans and it took forever. So I used the rest of the recipe and added it to a large bulk can of baked beans and it made them delicious!  It was the cheapest can of beans I could find so I was skeptical but it worked like magic!!

With a few changes, this is my new baked beans recipe! In order to make it vegetarian, I omitted the bacon entirely and replaces the Worcestershire sauce with 2 tsp vinegar, 1 tsp liquid smoke, 1/2 teaspoon apricot preserves and however much garlic powder came out when I vigorously shook the container. I was cooking for a potluck, but didn't have 4 cups of beans, so I made 1.5X the recipe. That was a LOT of beans. The original recipe is much more than 6 side-dish sized servings! To save time, I cooked the beans in the crockpot on high for a couple of hours instead of soaking them. That was the plan anyway. I forgot about them and overcooked them so they were mushy. Had to stir in the sauce because there was no way it was going to penetrate the slop of the mushed beans. I was sure I'd ruined it, but thought I'd give it a shot anyway. Turns out, the baking time dried out the beans enough to return some of that texture. Got so many compliments on this. YUM. Even the baby couldn't get enough!

I made this in my 4 qt crock pot.  I soaked the beans for almost a day (just because it turned out that way).  Used chicken broth instead of water.  Cooked them 18 hrs, stirring a few times and skimming fat at the end.  They were done sooner, but I turned the pot to high and took off the lid to cook down the liquid the last couple of hours.  They were delicious!

I made this dish exactly as written. I thought the beans were not very flavorful and I had to "doctor" them a little. I ended up adding more molasses mixture and baking them longer. They came out great. I made them a second time, and I doubled up on the molasses mixture and I baked them a full 4 hours. Perfect.! When you add the bean liquid as specified, it waters down the molasses flavor. In my opinion, it tastes much better when I doubled it.

Thank you for a bean recipe that takes dried beans.
My husband loves these. And I will make them again many times. The only thing I like to add is a little cayenne pepper for some zing.

I'm sure these would have been tasty IF I had known that the cooking process stops after the first simmering process. My beans were not tender as I would have liked.  After simmering them the required 1-2 hours (I did 2hrs) they were still a little el dente. I thought they would soften when I baked them.  Nope....stayed like little bullets.  Next time I'll simmer them longer or better yet, do them in the crock pot.

Classic Boston baked beans!  Bring on the brown bread!  I've been making this same recipe for years.  Kudos for not using canned pork-n-beans; these are REAL baked beans.  I make them in a slow cooker depending on when I plan to serve them, but follow as TBYE7 suggested and take off the lid for the last 2 hours to thicken them up; Boston beans are thick, not runny.  thanks for posting!

Yum...I skipped the overnite soaking and cooked the beans on high in my crockpot for 3 hours with twice as much water as beans.  Then I added all the ingredients (used only 1/4 lb of bacon instead of 1/2) except the salt. I cooked in the crockpot for 3 more hours and then added 1 teaspoon of salt instead of 2 and left it uncovered for an hour to thicken the sauce.  I don't know if it was just my crockpot but the beans came out tender and perfect.  I made brown bread to go with it.

I LOVE this recipe!! So nice to find one that uses dry beans rather than canned which makes this recipe much more authentic and old fashioned. I like to use salt pork instead of bacon, and reduce the salt greatly, other than that, the flavor is very YUMMY!!! Definitely a keeper! Thank you for sharing :)

I dont know if I did it wrong, but I made this 2 times, once scaling it larger, then the 2nd time, I made it without scaling for more servings. The recipe is way too sweet. And the beans needed +2-2.5 extra hours on top of the number of hours called for, I think 5 or 6? 
Maybe I dont know what boston baked beans are supposed to taste like, but for me, it was hard to eat.

This recipe is almost identical to the one in the Rival Crockpot cookbook, and I have been using it for years.  Some differences in amounts of ingredients.   I use 1/3 c molasses, regular mustard, and 1/2 c brown sugar.  If you don't have time to soak beans, you can use 2 -3 cans of drained navy beans.  Works equally well!

The first time I made this was for 50 people and half way through the cooking time I tested it for seasoning and found it way, way to salty so I had to toss in 4 large potatoes to fix it up and it worked out very well.   The second time, I made it for 12 and scaled the salt back to one tsp from the 2 tbsp suggested.   I think it's the addition of the bacon which makes it so salty but all in all, this recipe is definitely a keeper.   In fact, I've got some going right now to accompany the new years ham and scallop potatoes tomorrow.  Notes:  I add 4 cloves of chopped garlic to the sauce, soak the beans for 2 nights, simmer (not boil) for 1.5 hous and bake for approx. 6 hours @250 in a relic of a bean crock and these are without a doubt the best baked beanes I've ever had.    Now if only they'd cure tomorrow's hangover.

This is just the taste that I had been looking for. They are adequately sweet and not too tangy. I like to reduce the molasses and replace the sugar w/ stevia to make them healthier, as well as use canned white beans for ease of prep. This is a great recipe, and adaptable as well. Thanks for sharing it!

Great flavor. Soaked beans for 7-8 hrs, bring to boil for 2-3 minutes, turn heat off & let it sit for 1 hr. Drain water & rinse beans. Put fresh water in pot & soak overnight. Next morning, drain bean into crock pot, reserving water. Add back reserved water after layering the beans, bacon & onions to barely cover beans.  Took advice of reviews by  * frying bacon [cut into pieces 1st],  * decreased the sugar, adding bell pepper[red, yellow] and jalapeno [seeded, diced], liquid smoke.   * Took crock pot cover off the last 1 1/2 hr(after cooking about 7 hrs on low before removing lid) so sauce would thicken * Need to check liquid & stir periodically so that there's enough liquid. * Beans sitting there will absorb a lot of the liquid so do not let it dry out too much.    * Yields a lot of beans & flatulence

This is an excellent recipe! Very tasty. Made the recipe as stated and it turned out great. I will likely need to lessen the cook time a little on my current stove/oven, as it is a 50's/60's model and runs hotter than the more modern electrics I've cooked with. Thank you for a delicious recipe! :)

PERFECT!  This recipe is PERFECT!  It was my first attempt at making homemade baked beans and it was so easy.  I followed the recipe to a "T" but did leave out the onions because I didn't want onions in my beans.  The addition of bacon was my favorite part.  It cooked nicely without precooking.  This recipe has definitely found a home at our house.  Thank you AJRHODES3 for sharing!!

Great recipe not to difficult but time consuming with the cooking process, but well worth it. I doubled the recipe and used my cast iron kettle in the oven. Inexpensive dish if you are using dried beans. Most items you would have on hand in your pantry.

My husband , who doesn't like baked beans, said these were the best he ever tasted.  I was making them for a luncheon, so I used canned navy beans because I didn't want to take a chance the beans wouldn't soften. Next time I will try them using dry beans. ( more economical) But the flavor was amazing!

my family liked the recipe it was easy to make and it took me about 2 hours (if you are going to be cooking beans more than once you got to get a PRESSURE COOKER that is what we use in my country) here is what I did 1- let the beans on water overnight 2- put the beans with enough water over them so there is at least 2 inches of water (on top of the beans the beans) on the Pressure Cooker without lid on high until boil 3- put the Pressure Cooker lid and let it cook on medium (for just 40 min) 3- do the oven thing for 40-60 min and you are done!

This recipe was a huge hit at our bbq. I was very short on time, so I used rinsed canned navy beans. (as much as I didn't want to) This also cut down on bake time. It only took about an hour in the oven. I didn't feel like they were too sweet, b/c I think the Worcestershire sauce gave it balance. I think using the canned beans changed the consistency of the recipe, but I really don't think it changed the taste. It was wonderful!

I made this twice. Both times in my crockpot. First time I made it on high for 10 hrs I came home to completely burnt beans. This time I cooked them for 10hr on low but would suggest checking around 8 hrs. Also when soaking the beans do so in a flat dish as the beans soak up a fair amount of water. They are good but I think they are a little dry due to overcooking. Overall I will certainly make again but reduce the time, double the sauce and add more water then "just covering" the beans as stated. Thanks though, appreciate the from scratch recipes!!

Thank you for an absolutely FABULOUS recipe.  I've tried and failed before, but husband and I really loved these.  Made in a crock pot.  Flavored my simmer water with ham base, and added ham I'd had in freezer. Will definitely make again and again.

My wife, by her own admission, is not a very good cook but this recipe made her look like a gourmet chef. She made these beans for a party and they were a hit. Very flavorful and with the perfect thickness.

This ROCKS!!  Even my picky step-son loved it!  This is better than my grandmother made.  I never did get her recipe before she passed on.  I've been looking a long time and making many dud recipes.  I did add a little dash or two of ground ginger like she use to.  She claimed it helped to make you not toot so much!

I put this into my slow cooker and let it simmer all day long for like 9 or 10 hours on low- it was lovely!We loved it.  It made loads, so I put some in the freezer for a quick side or baked potatoe topping on another night.

I did start with tomato sauce instead of ketchup to keep with the "nonprocessed" food idea.  The flavor was awesome!  Had to keep tasting them just to make sure.... My family comprised of myself, my husband and 7-year-old daughter actually ended up finishing up the entire batch in one setting. Am making them again today for a family party.

These are delish.  I made mine sans the swine, and they were still super-tasty.  If you're doing them in the crock pot, cook them longer.  Mine took every minute of 2 hours of boiling and 5 of cooking to make them soft.

Well, I didn't have the best of luck with this recipe:(  It took about 4 hours to cook.  I did soak them, I did boil for two hours, then I baked them and had to for 4 hours and they were still hard:(  Oh well, I gave it a shot.

I am deathly allergic to beans, although I wanted to make them for my bean loving family on Christmas as a surprise!  Well, for not being able to taste test them, the family loved them.  I guess I did good.  Was kind of time consuming, but they loved the taste.

These are great sticking with the recipe, but I made a couple of modifications  – get rid of the water the beans are cooked in, double the liquid part of the recipe and add a Sam Adams Boston Lager.  These are simply AMAZING.  I’ve made them like this 3-4 times.  With smoked brisket and home-made bread – everything is gone fast!

I could not believe how good these were.  It was pretty time consuming but very easy.  When I made the sauce to put on the beans it did not look like enough at all, it did not come close to covering the beans, but when I pulled them out of the oven two hours later to check on them they were completley coated and smelled all so heavenly.  I did not change a thing and they came out fantastic.

I was initially very disappointed with this recipe, but it improved vastly after "resting" for a few hours.
I had a hunch that the sauce might taste better if I let the ingredients blend overnight in the refrigerator before heating and adding to the recipe. I'm a vegetarian, so I had to make some adjustments; I used Henderson's Relish instead of Worcestershire sauce (they're quite similar), and I added some smoked torula yeast and a few tablespoons of butter instead of the pork. I also lowered the temperature to 300º and baked for about 7 hours (the soaked beans had been boiled for an hour). The texture is great and whatever soupiness was there disappeared after sitting until cooled, but I still taste too much vinegar (my only complaint); the fact that I used Wholesome Sweeteners blackstrap molasses might be having an adverse effect as well (a bit too much like licorice).

This was a GREAT base recipe!  I kinda "wung it" and took a bag of kidney beans and a bag of white beans... soaked them in a large bowl until they had expanded and ended up having to take some out so that I would have room in my (6 qt)crock pot.  

After soaking, I reserved some of the liquid and put the sauce together by taste on the stove.  (I did add a touch of vinegar but not much and I also ran out of the dry mustard so I added a few TBS of dijon to deepen the flavor)  After the sauce came together I poured it into the bottom of the crock pot, added a full pound of chopped bacon and 2 onions (chopped) and stirred it all together with the beans and then added a little of the reserved liquid from the water the beans soaked in to cover the beans. I cooked them on HIGH for two hours and then turned the beans down to LOW and allowed them to cook slowly overnight.

When I woke up the beans tasted GREAT, but had a little too much liquid so I left them on LOW and took the lid off so that the liquid would evaporate some.

I did add one more chopped onion after I turned it off for some texture.

So excited!  I made my first baked beans from scratch!  I always wondered if I could and they taste GREAT!  It's a great recipe for when you are making baked beans for a crowd.  If it was just for my family - I think opening up a can of Bushes Baked Beans and adding a few things would do the trick!

Recipe was great, but onions vary in size. Rather than say 1 onion, say 1 cup (or whatever amount) chopped onion, which would make the recipe more accurate, and consistent.

We enjoyed this recipe, and it was easy, however my beans cooked more quickly than stated. They also retained to much water, so next time I'll add less of the cooking liquid. The flavour was lovely though. I only used half the bacon to make it a bit healthier; I chopped it up and layered it as directed and it was plenty. Thanks for the recipe!

This is the best recipe I have found for baked beans. I made a few changes, instead of using bacon, I used a left over ham bone from easter. I boiled it with the beans for about 2 hours, pulled the meat off, added an onion, and put it all into the oven for about 3 hours. I used all the liquid from the beans, at first it seemed a little watery, but as it baked they thickened up nicely. Oh, I added 1/4 cup more brown sugar, just because I like my beans sweet. Yummy recipe!

These were quite good. I didn't have any worcestershire sauce & it did taste like it might be missing something?? I also cooked in the crockpot. Still I would rather make something like this then buy it. I will make these again :)

These baked beans are excellent! I didn't have navy beans, so I used pinto beans.I soaked the beans overnight & put them in a crockpot, cooked on high for 7 hrs, then on low for 3 hrs. Added some maple syrup.  Served them with Baby Back Pork ribs. My husband just raved about the excellent taste on both.

Never having made baked beans and not really having a clue how to make them, the recipe did not call for adding water while they were baking in the oven. CHECK AND ADD WATER or something!!!! I didn't and the beans.. the ones that weren't burnt to a crisp had a decidedly smokey taste and that was only after the minimum time in the oven. Doh! So remember.. if you've never made them like I hadn't.. check and add water.. very very important!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Have a great day!

Most delicious beans I have ever made!  I brought them to a first birthday party. They were a hit! I did not adjust one bit,  absolutely perfect just as written.
 For the people who like to complain about the name,  don’t even listen to them complain  I thought the story behind the recipe made it more fun to make and enjoy! Thank you for sharing

I never attempted to make baked beans because I felt intimidated. I tried this and I am so pleased with the outcome. The beans turned out delicious! Not too wet or too dry! Perfect really perfect. The taste of the beans were wonderful, not overpowered by sweetness was my favorite part. I can’t wait to make them again!

Just made this delicious recipe and can't stop eating.  Thank you for sharing old-fashioned goodness skipping processed canned beans.  The only thing I changed was cooking the bacon and onions in a cast iron pan (future cornbread will be baked) and adding fresh water. I always drain my beans to help sensitive tummies in my family. Again, much appreciated!!!

Very easy and flavourful recipe!!!  I made this last summer for first time ever and received nothing but great feedback.  I plan on making them again in a few weeks for a party!  For all of the complainers out there, put a lid on it and try another recipe or tweak this one to your liking!  People are hear to help, offer, and or suggest, so keep your negative thoughts to yourself and move on...

I loved this recipe!  My family loved this recipe!  The flavor of these beans was outstanding and did remind me of baked beans i had in Boston.  I'm always looking for a good basic baked beans recipe using dry beans, but I'm still searching for that great southern/Texan baked beans recipe.  This recipe, I was told by my family, should NOT be messed with to achieve my goal of southern bbq beans.  I will be making these again!

It was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly as is and thought they came out perfect. My hubby and guests really enjoyed the dish as well. It really reminded me of the beans my grandmother used to make. This recipe will be my go-to for homemade baked beans.

Overnight soaking of dried beans can ferment them, amplifying their notorious digestive aftermath. (If your soaking water has bubbles on top, fermentation has begun.) Try the faster way: inspect the beans, discard any foreign matter, rinse them & place in a large pot with 10 cups of cold water. Bring to a boil & stir in 1 tsp. of kosher salt & ½ tsp. of baking soda (to tenderize them & help them brown when baking). Boil for 5 minutes, turn off the heat, cover & set aside for 1 hour. Then drain & rinse them very thoroughly with water. BTW, the black pepper & mustard powder in this recipe are essential deep-background flavors in baked beans, so don't leave them out. I'd use more of both. I also use: a yellow onion specifically; Great Northern beans (richer, nuttier flavor); more molasses & less brown sugar. BTW, classic Boston baked beans don't include Worcestershire, ketchup or bacon (modern additions!). They use salt pork (but not fatback). If you try salt pork, though, be careful: a small package can have many thousands of milligrams of sodium in it!

These are gooooood. I made in a deep disposable aluminum roaster and baked them on top of a cookie sheet (for transporting in and out of the oven). Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a "t" and the beans are amazing!! Very well rounded flavor.

This is the 2nd time I am making this dish, both times I have done it in the crock pot, this time I cut my soaking time short, I needed to get them cooking in crock pot because I have family coming today! When I made these for Easter, they were a hit!! I followed directions - (I made a double batch and doubled), minus salt to a T, I had left overs that time and took to work and shared with co-workers who loved them as well. This time since I have vegetarians coming, I cut out the bacon and added 1/2 teaspoon of liquid smoke. They smell great and are going to be another hit!!! 

I do not understand how anyone would not love this recipe, or at least be able to tweak it to their liking!!! I am so thankful to have found this recipe and this will be a keeper and something I make at least 2 times a year!!

These were perfect! I went with the recipe and made them in the oven, not the crockpot like other reviewers, and if you have the time I would recommend doing so (it's really not that much work if you are home for the day). I cut my bacon up into very small pieces and stirred the beans occasionally. I didn't have dry mustard so just used regular yellow mustard and it was fine. These are great!!

This was a huge hit at my son's birthday BBQ. I made it in a crockpot instead of the oven so I could slow cook it overnight. I also, cooked the bacon before adding it to the beans adding the onion and a little jalapeño during the last few minutes in the pan. It gave it a warm, smokey flavor without being too spicy.  Everyone asked where I found the recipe :)

I can't believe I made Baked Beans from scratch! I took top reviewer J.P.'s advice and made them in the slow cooker, adding extra water every few hours.  No one could believe that the girl who used to be dubbed "Helpless Hamburger" made baked beans from scratch!  Even non bean-eaters were eating them, declaring them to be different than the canned version.  The investment of time is absolutely worth it!

This is absolutely one of the best Boston bean recipes I have eaten and so easy to make. I forgot to soak the beans overnight so brought a pot of water to a boil, and soaked the beans for an hour, drained and followed the recipe....sooooo yummy and my family loved them. Will put into my favorite recipe file.

Just awesome. I did not use bacon and I messed up and used one half cup of brown sugar instead of one quarter cup but was awesome. I used vegetable broth instead of water to simmer the beans. Awesome recipe. Will use this recipe for baked beans happily ever after. Thank you so much for sharing.

My husband was craving baked beans. I found this recipe. I did change it a little. I boiled the beans with ham hocks and dried garlic and dried onions.  I made double the sauce but used half molasses and half maple syrup. I then put it in the crockpot for 8 hours on low omitting the bacon.  Everybody loved it and practically licked the pot. Thank you.  I was finally successful at made from scratch beans!

Great recipe overall! I use a traditional bean pot which makes it even more authentic. Depending on how long beans have soaked I might have to add more water to prevent drying out. Soaking really makes a difference to the bean and it's tenderness, try not not miss this step. Enjoy

Excellent beans.  I followed exact recipe. Last half hour I broiled to crisp up the bacon.  Flavour was really rich, husband loved.  Thanks for sharing :)

Amazing!  Made them for the first time last weekend and have already had several requests to bring them to my brothers 4th of July BBQ.  These are going to be a family fav!  I made them exactly as the recipe directed and they came out great.

This is a fantastic recipe! And it's practically mistake proof. I ended up making them in my slow cooker; I soaked the beans overnight and cooked them until tender before I added the rest of the ingredients. When I did add the rest of the ingredients, I accidentally miscalculated the amount to double and ended up quadrupling everything but the beans, bacon, and onion; they were still amazing.  The extra liquid also allowed me to cook them longer without drying out.

Excellent! I didn't have to time to soak the beans overnight, so did the "quick soak" method of bringing them to a boil, covering the pot, and letting them sit for one hour. Did the rest of the recipe as called for, but all in a crock pot. So delicious!

Made this yesterday and this recipe is fantastic. Had made other recipes for baked beans unsuccessfully.  This was so easy, I made the recipe as noted with an addition of maple syrup.  Have added this one to my recipe box - a keeper!

Followed the recipe to the letter. I was going to do what one reviewer did and put it in the crock pot for 20 hours, but to have for dinner, I'd have had to start it at like 2 a.m. Not happening. These were full of flavor, had the right texture, and were, overall, quite good. My mom especially liked them. :)

I usually make these exactly as written, and people love them. Great recipe! As the author suggests, you'll probably need to add some reserved bean water, maybe a cup or so, a couple hours into the cooking time. Also, this recipe doesn't yield a huge portion, so you may need to make two batches if you're feeding a lot of people.

This was my first attempt at homemade baked beans and it will not be my last !!! Thank you for an amazing recipe. I made a couple small changes as I am vegan so omitted the bacon and used a couple drops of liquid smoke . Used vegan Worcestershire . And we don't use ketchup so I used 3 heaping tbsp tomato paste and a splash of vinager and a extra tbsp of brown sugar :) turned out aaaaaaamazing

EXCELLENT !!!! Easy to make.  This was my first attempt at making Baked Beans and I was very excited with the results.  My 10 year old daughter can't get enough.  My mom always tried to make baked beans and they NEVER came out right.  ALWAYS HARD!  I can't wait to give her some of "mine"  

THANK YOU FOR THE RECIPE

I have been making baked beans in my crock pot for years, and never really measured the ingredients but tried to pull it off and my beans were O.K.  I made these beans yesterday and WOW!!  I soaked them overnight, then put everything in the crock pot. After about 6 hours, they were done!  Wonderful and tasty, I didn't have to modify the seasonings at all.   I like them thick with lots of sauce, and I got a wonderful batch of beans. The only change I made was to use cut up pork belly instead of bacon, less sodium. Thanks a heap for the recipe, I am keeping this one. :-)

Wonderful! Really good flavor. I didn't have any navy beans, so I used half pintos and half small red beans. Next time I'll use navy beans. Thank you SO much for this recipe! I have to make almost all my food from scratch because I have a severe allergy to MSG, processed food, and man-made chemicals and pesticides. It can be tricky. This "from scratch" recipe is just fabulous!!

I made this bean recipe yesterday, while I didn't really change the recipe I did a few things different. The first thing I did was rinse and inspect my dried beans (this step is really necessery)Then I soak the beans changing the water a couple of times.  When I put them on to boil and did it with fresh water, your beans will tast better when you do this and your gas will be less. For the bacon I used bacon ends and pieces instead of strip bacon.  You can cut away a lot of the fat this way, and the chunky pieces taste great after baking.  The one thing I did change was the amount of salt, you can always add it later if necessary.

I have now made this recipe twice and both times it was a hit with the crowd of people at our pot luck.  

I did not change the ingredients at all.  I did find however that both times I needed to add liquid so the beans would not dry out and with that being said, there was not enough of the original liquid left from soaking the beans even though I had plenty to start, so.....I simmered a medium sized pot on the stove with some beans, once the beans went into the oven.  This way midway thru when I had to add more liquid, I had some of the bean water to add, rather than just plain old water.  

Perfect recipe, I wouldn't change a thing!!!!!

These had great flavor.  I soaked mine overnight drained and then boiled for an hour and a half.  I put everything in the crockpot and cooked on high for about 7 hours and thought the were still a little hard for my liking.  I will for sure make these again but will start soaking in the morning and the boil at night and start the crockpot that night to cook overnight into the next day.

I tried this for a family bbq. My husband is always a skeptic when in comes to trying new foods, but he loved this recipe. It was a big hit with everyone else. He even took it for lunch the next day. I put it in a crock pot for the final 3-4 hours of cooking, since it was way too hot to have my oven on that long in July. I will fix this again and again, even in the winter months. Thank you for a delicious recipe.

Very good recipe.  I used 3 tablespoons of maple syrup plus 1 tablespoon of Molasses (for the colour) and added 2 tablespoons of Tomato paste (as we prefer the taste of tomatoes).  Cooked it successfully in the Crock Pot for 8 hours on low after simmering for one hour on the stove top.

Not huge baked bean fans in our family so I thought I'd try a scratch recipe....I hit the right one FOR SURE!! 
I rarely use canned beans for anything because they are so easy(yet time consuming) to prepare and they haven't been stored for months in TIN...
SOOO I made the recipe EXACTLY as written except I did not have Navy beans(I used pintos) or Worcestershire so I used A1 instead, and I forgot to save the bean cooking liquid( I used a small amount of water)  THESE turned out AMAZING!!  I do like the sauce thick so I removed the lid and baked the last 45 min or so, they came out not mushy nicely thickened and DELICIOUS!!  I will NEVER buy canned BBQ beans EVER!!
Take the time to cook an absolutely amazing recipe for your friends and family this summer, their smiles and the empty pot at the end will warm your heart !!!
I would rate this 10 stars if possible!!

This has been my "go to" recipe for baked beans for years.  I use a 1 LB bag of navy beans, which is 3 cups, so I multiply the recipe x 1.5.   I often cook my beans w/ a ham bone if I have one from from a recent dinner, then add the bone in during the cooking process (removing it before serving, of course).   Like other reviewers, I skip all the fussy stuff and just toss it all in the crock pot, stir it up and let the crocker do the rest of the work.

These beans went from Boston to the Tropics today.  I had a few slices of fresh pineapple that needed to be used up, so I added them to the top of the beans...delish addition.  I think the thing that I liked the
most about this recipe is that the beans didn't turn to mush like so many baked bean recipes do.  The beans still had a firm texture even after cooking for the better part of the day, and the sauce was rich and thick.  And I suspect they'll even taste better tomorrow cold.  A definite keeper.

Made exactly as written and the flavor was great.  I did have a problem with the bacon being firm in some bites and slimy in others.  Next time I will just roll it up on a toothpick and discard after cooking. All my guests felt the same.

I guess I am one of those people that change things and then rate a recipe :) I made BBQ tonight and had a craving for baked beans. Of course I didn't have time to soak navy beans so I just used lentils and cooked everything on the stovetop. I am also a vegetarian so I left out the bacon. I can't wait to try these with navy beans in the oven! I never want mushy canned baked beans again!

This was a good recipe that I will make again with a few tweaks.  First, the beans were a bit dry and not saucy enough.  I'll add more water next time.  I also think two hours to bake them was enough.  Great recipe though, thanks!!!

Yummy, yummy, yummy. I may try with maple syrup instead of molasses, but they are so good as they are that I might decide not to mess with the recipe at all!

Very traditional and great flavor! In New England, bean recipes are handed down for generations. You would be surprised to know just how old the baked bean recipes in those authentic Yankee kitchens are. This recipe is great just the way it is, but switched out bacon for small pieces of salt pork and added 1/2 cup of the good maple syrup. Thank you AJRHODES3 for sharing your family recipe!

My family really liked this recipe.  I omit the bacon and used tomato sauce instead of ketchup, cooked them until tender then into the crockpot on low for 4 hours until they were thick.  Yum!

I made this without bacon.  I used lean pork.  Beans being high in protein this became our maindish.  Some beans as FYI, no matter how long you cook they do not get soft.  It is the beans not the recipe.  I used the crockpot, soaked and cooked the beans before hand.  I never measure anything.  A habit my grandmother had.  I too like thicker so the top went off for the last little bit.  I also used Splenda and Splenda Brown sugar.  With these changes we had a lower calorie, lower fat and higher protein meal.  My family ate it up.

Excellent recipe!  I loved that the beans were made from scratch and not just dressing up canned beans.  I did make them for lunch, so I soaked and cooked the beans the day before.  The next morning I finished the recipe and let them cook for 4 hours.  I did add barbecue sauce as well, but that was just my husband's preference.  It was good without it as well.  This is a definite do again!

This is my first time making beans and they came out looking and tasting delicious.  I omitted the salt, ketchup and cut the white fat from the bacon for this recipe.  It came out great and will definitely make it again.  No way does this recipe taste like canned beans.

This recipe tastes just like the ones my grandmother made.  She never wrote recipes down and everything was measured "a dash of this" or "about this much of that".  She passed away years ago and we thought we'd never have beans like Grandma's ever again.

Thanks for sharing this recipe.  I agree with other reviewers that this "from scratch" recipe is by far the best of the baked bean recipes here.

A good Boston baked bean recipe.  I would certainly make again. I found it took 10 hours to cook but started it ahead so it worked out great.  I added some garlic and a touch more of the dry mustard.  As a few others noted I did add more water at the end.  Thanks for sharing a tasty recipe with all of us.....

I've made this several times last winter season, but do have my own little twist. First, I fry half a pack of bacon, cut into pieces on med/low until crispy. Half-way through I add the chopped onion to fry and soak up the bacon flavour. I save the bean water, and put the beans in a crock pot, and add all the rest of the ingredients at the same time. I also add 1 can of tomato paste. When the bacon is crispy, I add it and the onion to the crock pot, turn on high, and 41/2 hours later, BEANS! I like to serve my beans with buttered toast, and they're also great in the morning with a fried egg on top. I like my yolks runny. DELICIOUS! This is one of my winter staples.

Love this recipe. Very few out there where you start with real beans, not canned. Have done in the crock pot and baked. Prefer the crock pot. Can start in the morning and not worry about monitoring a dish in the oven.

This is now my official baked bean recipe.  I never made homemade baked beans before these past couple months when I tried a few recipes and found that this one is my favorite.  I prepared exactly as written but as they cooked I added about another few tablespoons of brown sugar.  I like my beans a bit on the sweet side.  Awesome recipe, thanks!!

This recipe did not make enough sauce. My end result looked NOTHING like the main picture up there. The sauce was delicious, and I think in the future I would have to quadruple it to get beans in a red sauce instead of beans in a watery reddish clear liquid. I will also add less water, not covering the beans with water all the way next time, and just put a lid on my dish so it steams them, and stir periodically. Thanks for the recipe!

I made these for a party and they were gone before everyone got through the line.  I made them without bacon since some vegetarians were there and doubled the sauce because they got a little dry without the bacon.  Flavors were amazing though!  Everyone wants the recipe.

This is a very good Baked Bean Recipe.  Like others, I was looking for one that used dried beans.  I used Pintos.  I didn't have molasses and substituted maple syrup instead.  It came out very well.  The whole recipe was gone after our Labor Day cookout.

Excellent bean recipe and will definitely be a keeper!! Cooked this for Easter dinner for the in-laws and got rave reviews and got asked for second helpings.... and thirds and fourths!
I did make a change and cooked it in the slow cooker so I could have room in the oven for my ham.  Boiled the beans for only 1 hour, then threw in all the ingredients into the crock pot.  I did mix then boil the sauce as the recipe called for, but next time I will skip boiling it.  Put the crock up to high and left it for 3-4 hours. 
I also added a little extra bacon!
Thank you for sharing!

This is exceptional.  I did not have bacon so I used bacon bits, otherwise followed the recipe.  Oops, no I didn't - I didn't read carefully, just threw everything in my crock pot including my unsoaked beans and it was GREAT!  Just what I was hoping for!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.  : )

This is a great recipe.  Where I live molasses and navy beans are not available.  I substituted honey and red beans.  These were the only changes to the original recipe.  But I did take the suggestions of others and cook in my slow cooker.  Fantastic, just like the baked beans I used to buy ande love while I lived in the US.

I made these the other day for some friends, and it was a hit.  I did make a few changes to suit my needs.  I didn't have brown sugar, so I just used white sugar and extra molasses (essentially the same thing).  I also substituted 1/4 c barbeque sauce for half of the ketchup (I always put barbeque sauce in baked beans).  I also only used 2 thick slices of bacon instead of the 1/2 lb, since my friends and I are watching our weight.  I did end up keeping it in the oven longer than I should have, so I added a bit more of the bean-cooking water with 1 T cornstarch.  I will definitely make this again.  Mmm...

Fabulous!  I added some diced green bell pepper (sauteed it with the onion, garlic, and bacon), and cooked it uncovered for the last 2 hours to thicken the sauce.

This recipe was delicious.  The only problem was they dried up.  I had to add more water which I'm sure took away from the flavor.

THE BEST Boston baked bean recipe I've ever tried!  I cut back on the bacon a bit and used jarred Dijon mustard instead of dry.  My bean pot will be filled with this recipe many more times & enjoyed with steamed brown bread.

Awesome! These are the best beans we have had in a long time and very easy to make. I stirred a little white flour in some water and added it to thicken them a bit and they were perfect.

I adjusted to cook in the crock pot.  Used 1/3 cup of molasses and 2 tbsp of tomato past rather than ketchup, also used applewood smoked bacon.  I added enough reserved cooking liquid just to cover.  Was very salty, next time I will reduce salt to 1/2 tsp.  Cooked on high for 1 hr, then reduced to low for 6 hours.  Stir a couple of times and check to be sure not too dry.  
Reminded me of the Beans my Grandmother cooked when I was a child in MA.

I halved the recipe as there was only three of us. Only thing I changed was to use pinto beans instead of navy beans. I left the beans soak for about a day, and followed the recipe perfectly yet my beans still came out hard. I did halve the cooking time since I was only making half the recipe, but 2 hours wasn't enough. Then I put them in for about another hour. Still hard. The sauce tastes great though I did have to use a little water and cornstarch to thicken it up a bit. I liked the idea of this recipe since it called for dry, not canned beans and I had those on hand. I will try this again using canned beans and altering the cooking time. EDIT: I have tried making this a few different times, soaking longer and cooking longer but the beans are still hard. Going to look for the navy beans, as the pintos really aren't cutting it. Try using half ketchup, half (maple) bbq sauce and 1/4 tsp. liquid smoke and substituted Dijon for the dry mustard.

Wow, these are the best baked beans I've had since my Mom's. We did them in a crock pot, they took about 6 hours. We backed off on the brown sugar and added a little apple cider vinegar. Great recipe.

I liked this recipe just fine; the taste was overall good. The one thing that stood out to me is that I do think it was too ketchupy. It didn't have as strong of a molasses taste as I expected and as I remember having in the recipe I grew up with. So I added a lot of molasses and next time would cut back on the ketchup. I'd probably increase the other seasonings as well to counter the strong ketchup taste.

This is really easy to make - I short cut with canned beans and it still comes out great.  I simmer my sauce for about 5 minutes before pouring it over the beans.  Always have to put a baking sheet under the casserole dish as they love to bubble up.  Love the flavor that is enfused throughout the entire dish.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I remember my father making baked beans as a kid, he was a really good cook but I never really liked his baked beans made from scratch.  I preferred the Van de Camps that he would doctor up over the ones he would make from scratch.    These were sooo good.  I did as one person had recommended and doubled the sauce recipe to pour over the beans and cooked them in the crockpot.    These were great.  Maybe a little too sweet but a great base recipe to make changes to as time goes by.  Next time I plan on adding a pepper and maybe some apples and cutting down on the brown sugar a little.  I am very please with the way they turned out though.

While this recipe is pretty good, I prefer the Crock Pot Recipes I have seen on better recipes. I especially like the variations they offer. While I do work with them, I honestly love the recipes they offer, as well as their selection.

I was really excited to try this recipe. I've never attempted baked beans before and love to try new things. However, I must have done something wrong. The beans looked amazing [much like the profile photo], they smelled amazing, yet they had an odd, almost burnt flavor. They didn't look burnt and the texture was perfect. Thus, I will give it another go and see where I goofed.

Awesome Recipe which i followed to the letter but only added 2 tsp of liquid smoke which was a nice touch.    Rather than baking in the oven i used a slow cooker for about 8-10 hours

Very good! I was out of molasses, so I substituted 100% pure maple syrup. I had never made it before, so I have to remember that it won't actually *look* like baked beans until it's almost done. (using crock pot method)

My toddler loves baked beans but I'm not crazy about him eating a lot of canned goods, so I decided to make them from scratch. Didn't add the bacon, instead used turkey sausage. Came out great. Great recipe...definitely a keeper.

These were delicious! I made them for an Easter brunch of 50 people. I made two batches, one in the oven like the recipe suggests, and one in the crock pot. The beans baked in the oven were of  superior flavor, for sure! I doubled the recipe and it served 30 adults + 20 children. It makes a lot!

This is a great basic recipe that is easy to modify to taste.  I soaked the beans (I used heirloom tepary beans) overnight in chicken broth (low sodium), covered in the fridge.  I added roast garlic, to the soak and did not change the liquid when cooking.I used a whole pound of turkey bacon .  I doubled the amount of sauce, and added apple cider vinegar to taste for a little extra kick.  The whole party loved it!

Delicious!!  I made a few changes.  I soaked the beans overnight, but did not simmer them - I drained that water and rinsed the beans then put them in the crockpot with 5-6 cups of water, 2 onions and 1 tsp salt.  Cooked them on low for 4 hours.  Then added all the other ingredients (with the following changes - only 2 tsp Worcestershire, 1 tsp dry mustard, and no additional salt and a dash of liquid smoke) to the crockpot and continued cooking a few more hours.  I did not use bacon.  But truly a delicious recipe!!!

The beans have a very nice flavor, but the baking process took two more hours than the recipe called for.  I ended up adding more of the sauce and water to finish up the baking.

I made this in the crock pot and it worked out great! I doubled the recipe to use a 900 gram bag which is 2 lbs. I soaked the beans overnight then added the sauce ingredients in the morning, I use 1 can of no salt added tomato sauce for the ketchup as I am on a low sodium diet and enough water to just cover the beans. I left out the bacon, personal preference. I cooked the beans for 12 hours on low, adding water as needed, they were awesome!

This was very good and mine came out very juicy and i did not need to add extra water at all. I did add a little real maple syrup at the end for a Vermont flavor.

These were great!  I love that this recipe uses dried beans.  Instead of cooking these in the oven, we put them in the smoker with some ribs for about 5 hours.  They came out tender and full of flavor.

Exactly the recipe I was looking for! Great taste and easy to make. I also drain the soaking water, use fresh water to simmer the beans. I only simmer for 30-45 minutes (I use that water) then cook the beans in a crockpot overnight on low. Wouldn't change a thing but I guess you could adjust molasses and sugar to taste.  In the morning they're done. If they're not thick enough for me I take the lid off and set it on high and let them cook some more until they are the consistency I like.

I goofed and forgot to soak overnight.  Tried simmering for 3 hours then cooked for only3 hours.  Definately needed more time.  The flavor was incredable though and will make them correctly next time.

This recipe was good and easy!  Instead of using bacon, I used 2 tbls of liquid smoke.  It was the same flavor, but less fat.  I also baked these in a crock pot, but added too much water.  Next time I'll put in less water and molasses.  Definitely a keeper.

Not sure what happened.  But these beans were chewy; the sauce had an unpleasant taste.  Will not be making this again!

I thought the beans were really sweet, I'll make it next time with no sugar and add sugar as it cooks and I taste it.  I cooked the bacon seperately and added it right before eating since my stepdaughter is vegetarian.    I couldn't find dry navy beans, so I used canned navy beans, threw everything in the crockpot on high at lunch time, and it was ready for dinner.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made these beans today on a lazy saturday afternoon. I have to say that they are awesome and totally beat out a can of baked beans any day. However, maybe it was my preparation but after i simmered them for the recommended time they were a little mushy. I definatley doubled the sauce as many reviewers recommended which made the beans much more flavorful. all in all this was a GREAT resipe, the only recommendation I have is to maybe simmer the beans aldente. B + M eat your heart out!

This recipe is fantastic.  The finished product tastes like Bush's Baked Beans, but I grew up eating B&M Baked Beans, which have a different flavor.  If you prefer B&M Baked Beans, you may find this recipe slightly too tangy as I did.  Next time I make it I'll increase the molasses and decrease the ketchup.

I'd probably give these about a 4.5 stars.  They were really really good.  I mainly made these because I had all the ingredients on hand and I wanted to know how much better they were than store bought/canned baked beans.  Honestly, they were delicious, but canned (Bush's) are really really close to being just as good.  I did use 2 cans of white beans, one being navy beans and one was another kind of bean. We made the bacon up (to drain the fat) and then crumbled it to add in the pot. I would make them again (just to say, "they're homemade!"), but canned are pretty much just as good.

Very good...reminds me of my mother's recipe I lost. Growing up in NB, Canada, home baked beans were a staple. I didn't have enough bacon for this recipe but it was still very good. Next time I will cook the bacon first, to try to cut down on the bacon fat. I also can't get the dried beans I wanted here in Indiana, but northern beans worked out well.  I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe....

These are great- a nice recipe for beans from scratch. I made it in the crockpot, soaked the navy beans overnight first. it took about 10 hours but they were worth it! I have made many bean recipes over the years, but never used a crockpot. (And believe me, not all of them work out). Stick with one that does It is the easiest, best tasting, and energy efficient. Your search is over- this is the one.

I, too, cooked this in a crock pot.  Turned out pretty good.  I prefer it with a little more brown sugar, but this wasn't bad at all.  Will certainly make again.

1st time bean baker... had my fussy neighbour over for supper and baked a ham too. Best baked bean recipe I ever tried. Worked very well. I did substitute half of the ketchup with some barbecue sauce I had on hand.. added some great flavour. Will definitely keep this recipe to make over and over again! Thanks alot!

I wish I could rate this 10 stars.  Outstandng.  I searched a long time for a baked bean recipe that did not use canned beans.  I made this for a large crowd and everyone raved "best beans ever".  Only changes I made was not adding the extra salt (personal preference).  I also pre-cooked the bacon to cut down on the greese.

I followed the recipe exactly except for the bacon. I added no bacon and it was very good the first night. I do not think it froze well as the leftovers were not very good, but hey, if you can use up the recipe at one meal it is great!

These Beans were Great! I followed the recipe except rather than baking them I put them in the crock pot. I tripled the recipe so that I could have left overs. But we ended up taking them to my nieces birthday party the next day. They were a huge hit and went well with bbq pork. This is a keeper. Thank You AJRHODES3

I'm not a fan of canned beans at all, so was on the hunt for a homemade bean recipe that didn't start with a can of baked beans.  This is a really great recipe, and super easy.  I like foods that have a bit of heat to them, and about 1/2 tsp of Chipotle Chili Powder proved to be a great addition.

These were tasty.  The recipe was a bit time consuming, but it's a good recipe.  My family has a lot of food allergies, so this is the only way they can eat baked beans -- homemade.

I recently made this recipe for my daughter's and son's 13th and 5th birthday parties as a side.  The only thing I did differently was buy the beans precooked in a jar, but followed the recipe for the rest of it.  The beans turned out fantastic, and everyone loved them!  Thank you so much for this recipe, I will be using it again for my boyfriends twins 5th birthday party and I'm sure it will be a success again!

Never buy canned baked beans again! For years I would not eat canned baked beans  because they tasted so 'blah'. This recipe has great flavor and texture. I didn't change a single thing in the recipe and I love it as is. Yum!

Best baked beans I've ever tasted.  This was my first attempt at making baked beans from scratch, and they came out perfect.

Lots of calories, though.  Next time I will make some low-sugar substitutions and see how they come out.

Although it is a lot of work - I love this recipe! I've made it twice and the first time I had to boil for 4 hours and cook for 4 - there was not enough sauce or instruction to soak them in lots of water so the were a little dry but still ver tasty. This time, I soaked them with the water filled to the top of the dish and let them sit from 7 pm until 12 noon and boiled for 2 hours. I tripled the sauce and actuall have some boiled reserve left over. My husband loves them, I love them and will make again. I always make with molasses bread as a side...mmmmm!!

I was not too pleased with the outcome on this one. It was my first attempt at baked beans and I think I may have failed and not the recipe. I tried it in the crockpot but I believe I loaded the pot with too many beans (I doubled the recipe) so it was still very watery after 9 hours of cooking on high. I tried to thicken it with flour and water and that didn't work. SO I think I may try it again at a later date and hopefully I can edit my rating to 4 stars or more!

I used this recipe to break in my new bean pot on Memorial Day, and couldn't have asked for a better maiden voyage.
This is how baked beans are supposed to taste!  Will make again often.

Very yummy. I baked them all day in a crock pot on high instead of the oven. That way I could plug it in on the patio and not heat up my house on a hot summer day and still enjoy homemade beans at our bbq!

These were a hit at our last BBQ.  I really liked the fact that the beans were not very liquidy at all.

I have been trying to make good baked beans for years and have not been successful until now. This a great recipe! I didn't have the time to soak fresh beans so I used two large cans of Pork & Beans which had been drained. It turned out beautifully. Just keep an eye on it to monitor for dryness.

My mother told me these tasted like canned beans. Huh. "Do you like canned beans?" "Yeah." So there you have it. If you like canned beans only with a lot more work these are the beans for you. I personally thought they were slightly better than canned beans. Either way, they were good.

A really excellent baked bean recipe!  So easy to make - it's in the oven the whole time.  I added a bit of extra water, since I like them fairly wet.  Absolutely delicious!!!

This is exactly what I have been looking for.  A friend of mine used to make "Boston Baked Beans" that were delicious just like these.  I have made them several times now.  It is exactly the complex flavor I was looking for not present in other recipes. None the less, it is relatively easy to make. Thank you so much!

I made these beans for a summer side dish in a crockpot.  I used two tblsp. Molasses instead of 3 and added 1 tblsp cider vinegar. I used a lean hickory grilled pork chop instead of bacon.  I cooked on low for 4 hours. They were tender and delicious, not too sweet and had a nice amount of sauce.

I followed others' advice for adapting to a crock pot, but kept ingredients and amounts the same. These were excellent. I wasn't sure if I needed to cook the bacon before adding, so I didn't. It seemed to turn out just fine.

These beans are very delicious. An important step to add at the end though. You MUST stir the beans thoroughly at the end of the baking in order to combine the ingredients.

Delicious!!! Followed the recipe pretty much as written just added some garlic and jalepeno  cuz we like spicey and I couldnt be happier with the results. Boiled the beans after soaking (and rinsing) for about 45 minutes and baked for 2.5 hrs. I made a double batch but tripled the sauce. Thanks for a great recipe,  cant wait to make them again.

This bean recipe is out of this world fantastic! I don’t care what you call it, it’s the best! The only things I did differently was I used a 12oz. pkg of bacon and I sautéed the onions, which I do for all my dishes. I’ll be making this often as my family loves it!

Adapted to the pressure cooker. Delicious results!

Rinsed the beans and added to pressure cooker with 8 cups water (no soaking necessary). Pressure cook on high for 25 minutes and allow a natural release for up to 25 minutes, then quick release. Drain beans and set aside in a bowl.

Sauté bacon in pressure cooker while scraping the bottom. Add onions once bacon is browned. Sauté until soft and golden. Add other ingredients one at a time and then add beans back into the pressure cooker with 1/2 cup water.

Pressure cook on high for 15 minutes with a quick release.

The family gobbled it all up (approved by 3 kids and 2 adults).

Regretfully I replaced the water the beans soaked in with fresh water,  as a result the beans lost some of it's smooth texture.  But I am still giving it a 5* because everybody at the potluck loved them.  And the corn intolerant person was so happy  they were made with molasses and not corn syrup.

Great base recipe for outstanding baked beans.  I cooked mine in a crockpot and made the following changes:

1) Used thick cut bacon
2) Added 2 cloves of minced garlic
3) Used 1/4 cup ketsup and 1/4 chili sauce instead of just ketsup
4) Added two dashes of sriracha sauce to boost flavor with a hint of heat
5) Didn't bother heating the molasses, salt, pepper, dry mustard, ketsup/chili sauce, worcestershire and brown sugar in a sauce pan - just mixed it all together in the slow cooker with the beans and leftover soaking water
6) Cooked in the crockpot  on low for 8 hours.

Very well received at neighbourhood potluck - I'll never buy another can of beans again.  So simple and tasty.

Enjoy!

After spending so much time prepping and cooking these beans .....came a huge disappointment. They were dry (I had to make 4 more batches of the sauce and they still weren’t good). Never again!!!

I have been making this same recipe for years also. It was passed from my grandmother, to my mother, and then to me. So I want to thank the creator/submitter for this recipe because, it is exactly the same. None of us ever lived in your area, but share this much loved recipe.  It must have been the generation or the same cookbook. My mother always said she was 'a plain cook', but there is nothing plain about this and there is never any left over. And, I agree, don't get hung up on the name. They are wonderful baked beans regardless of what you call them. BTW, you can cook these in a slow cooker on high following timing and procedures and not heating up the whole kitchen. Results will be the same.

These beans are so good!  I simmered the beans for 45min on the stove top then put them in the slow cooker with a double batch of the cooking sauce for a darker rich color.  
Cooked the beans on low for 9.5 hours. The bacon was so tender and in small pieces when the dish was done. Next time I'll bake them in the oven.  Wanted to find a recipe close to the one my aunt made when I was a little girl. Glad I decided to give it a try.

Soaked/cooked as state.  Baked bacon in oven till almost crisp.  Drained grease but left a coating in the pan.  Cooked diced onions in the pan for 10 min turning to absorb some of the bacon fat.   Transferred all to crock pot layering as stated.  Cooked overnight then removed lid for an hour or two b-cuz it was too watery.  Also,I substituted chili sauce for the ketchup so it would have a sort of smoky flavor.  BEST BEANS EVER!!

This and Chef John's version are my go-to recipes and I've made both many times.  I would recommend cutting back on the salt, however. I've found that 2 tsp of added salt is unnecessary.  Between the bacon and ketchup alone, there's already about 2600 mgs sodium in this recipe, and adding 2 tsp more salt just adds another whopping 4700 mgs sodium to the mix.  A bit too salty for my taste, not to mention an unhealthy amount of sodium.  If you find this a bit too "ketchupy", try using 1/4 cup ketchup and 1/4 cup dark/smokey BBQ sauce of your choice. You can use either light-coloured  (also called "brilliant yellow") or dark brown sugar (also called "old-fashioned"). Makes almost 6 cups.

I've  been looking for a homemade baked bean recipe for a long time.  This was so good, the best.  I made a few changes:  1.  cut the recipe in half....2.cooked the beans in a pressure cooker for 10 minutes on high in chicken broth....3. put the beans in a one quart crock pot.....4. layered as per recipe, but added no salt and pepper, used only half the bacon, doubled the onions.....5. cooked on high for 3 1/2 hours covered, removed cover and cooked for another 1/2 hour....so good, a keeper

Never made baked beans before, a good friend was coming for her birthday dinner and she loves baked beans so gave it a try!  I did follow someone else's advice about draining the water the beans were soaked in, rinsing and added fresh water (with a cube of vegetable stock) and cooked for one hour and when checked beans were done.i. Being a hot day I used a crock pot..came out perfect!!

I made this for a large group get together and everyone loved it.  I doubled the batch and made a few minor changes:  I cut down on the onion a bit (my personal taste/preference) and diced the bacon.  I did not layer the beans, bacon and onion, but mixed it up.  Since the onion and bacon were diced, this was easy to do.  I also mixed the sauce in instead of pouring it on top.  I also cooked this in a crock pot set on high instead of baking in the oven and it seems to do well.  This is definitely a keeper recipe and I will be making it again!

This is our go-to baked beans recipe! Absolutely love it, although we add only 1/2 teaspoon of salt and use a crock pot to soak/cook the beans before assembling and baking. That way we can eat them up same day!

I liked baked beans before, but this recipe's got kick so now I love them!  The only changes I made was to reduce the salt to 3/4 teaspoon, and I use a slowcooker. Simple and delicious every time, a favourite recipe that I've shared with all my friends, and now in regular rotation at home.

This is a keeper.  The first time I made it following the recipe completely but next time omitted the bacon to save calories.  It was still great!

Good base recipe.  I gave it 4 stars because I felt I had to add more brown sugar and molases to give the recipe and extra punch of flavour.  I liked the bacon addition though, but chose to place half of the bacon raw in the roasting pan, then shortly before it was done I added the other hald of super crispy bacon that I previously cooked.

I followed this recipe to the letter. I used a cast iron casserole dish and it was too hot at the temperature stated. Next time I will cook for three hours at 325 degrees. Other than that, delicious. I did about 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda to the bean water.

I can't exactly answer for the flavour of this recipe because I made some changes to the ingredients, but the recipe was the only one which used dried beans to start and the directions are clear and precise.

This was a good start but for my family's tastes it was too heavy on the molasses flavor and just not zesty enough. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and waited until it was all baked together with the bacon and onion. But even then the molasses hadn't mellowed and there was just no zing. I added half a bottle of regular barbecue sauce which helped raise the tang factor but then it wasn't as sweet as I would've liked.  Next time I'll use much less molasses, maybe add some vinegar and more pepper, and trust the taste of the sauce before it bakes.

I made a big mistake. I thought that if I made these in the crockpot they would be wonderful. Not so .Cooked them on high for 9 hours. Added water. Used lovely salt pork. Kicked up the dry mustard. Beans were boring. Wonderful ingredients. DO NOT MAKE EM IN A CROCK POT.

Loved, loved, loved this!  My husband hasn't stopped raving about how good these were...and it has been 4 days!  I didn't decide to make them until around Noon, so didn't soak them overnight.  I just simmered the beans in a pot for 2 hours and then moved on to putting them in the oven.  They were a perfect texture!  I skipped the Worcestershire sauce as I don't particularly care for that flavor--used a bit of vinegar for the acid.  Delicious!!  Thanks so much for sharing!

Been searching for a good baked beans recipe, and this is it! You have to plan this one, anything short of the 6 hour cook time yields inferior results, I've gone 1 and 2 hours further in the oven for fantastic results. I use this recipe as the base for my beans as I like mine with more "oomph" (spicy).

If you follow this recipe and allow for the full cook time, you should have amazing beans still.

Very time consuming and labor intensive to make, not really worth it. The beans took forever to tenderize on the stove, there was hardly enough sauce to fully coat the layered beans, and there wasn't enough bean water left to cover. Afraid of diluting the flavor with tap water, I baked it for less time to prevent it from drying up. 

The finished product tasted OK, but not terrific. Not really all that better than canned beans. The sauce did however taste good (maybe a wee bit salty) when it was freshly made. Next time, instead of spending all that time, I'll just make the sauce, and use it to dress up a can of beans.

Excellent. I used some fresh end-of-season pole beans I had left over from the garden that had matured too much to eat in the pod. (No need for soaking fresh beans. I did increase the amount of fresh beans to account for moisture difference between fresh and dried beans.) Like another reviewer, I cooked these in my crockpot for convenience and they turned out excellent. I don't think I'll be buying canned baked beans any more.

These were good.  I did not tweak the recipe.  The problems I had were that they were too mushy because they cooked too long and they were too salty because 2 tsp of salt is way too much.  Essentially this is a good recipe and I would make again with adjustments to cooking time and salt.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Followed the recipe with the sole exception that I only used a scant teaspoon of salt and (since it was what I had on hand) used great northern rather than navy beans.  I'm a 3-decade vegetarian, but often cook meat for my husband.  The way this recipe is structured, I was able to prepare it in two casseroles:  the first following the recipe exactly (but with the full complement of bacon) for my husband, and the second casserole which just omitted the bacon.  Served it with Kentucky Biscuits from this site and fresh corn on the cob ... Pure Happiness!!!  Thanks so much for sharing!

Thanks for posting this recipe! I made baked beans from scratch last weekend. I cooked the dry white beans and I put everything in my Crockpot, including raw onion and raw bacon, they ended up slow-cooking all day and all night. They were super excellent! So doing them from scratch just means thinking way ahead.

I made this recipe with a couple changes.  I bought cans of navy beans, so didn't have to go through soaking etc.  I also added a little bit of hot sauce to the sauce. Will make this over and over, flavor is great.

Not sure what happened.  Followed this to the letter but it was so soupy that I had to drain off a lot of liquid and of course flavor got drained off with it.  I was hoping that it would be thick and dark like the photo... Any suggestions?

This is the second time I made this delicious baked beans. The first time I used two cans of pork and beans, drained and then added all the ingredients, this just made it faster to prepare. This time I’m starting from scratch, I omitted the the dry mustard and Worcestershire sauce. Instead of plain ketchup, I used hot ketchup, I also used pepped bacon ends to give a little kick. I will see how the family reacts.

Update
Instead of soaking beans overnight, I used two 29 oz. cans of pinto beans. This way I was able to cut down cooking time dramatically. I also precooked the bacon and added it to the rest ingredients and simmer it for about 1 hr. Total time about 1 ½ hrs. Instead of 5 hrs. To give it a little kick, I added ? teaspoon of, 100 scoville, Cayenne Pepper.

I made this recipe after trying several that were not so successful. This was stunning. At our family BBQ for 35 people, there was not a bean left.This is now my go to recipe.

These beans are delicious. Instead of bacon I use a tsp. of liquid smoke and a generous pour of maple syrup. I put everything in the crockpot and let it simmer overnight or all day. Then I let it sit for a few hours. They get better and better as time goes on. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was awesome - very close to another recipe I used to have.  The only thing I did different is used a ham bone, which I added during the simmering part and then diced in the ham.  I also finished it off in the slow cooker because I was using the oven for something else so I just added an hour or so to the cooking time.

I made this with a bag of dried beans that I soaked overnight.  I'm not certain which type of beans I used (I forgot) but I don't think there is a specific rule about this...a bean is a bean is a bean...in my book.
I didn't measure two cups of beans as the recipe instructs, I simply used the entire bag as I mentioned.  I also didn't measure the salt (I now see another person rated this recipe 1 star due to excessive saltiness).  Personally, I think salt is a judgement call so add it or not as you see fit.
I would give this recipe 5 stars but what holds me back is the need to soak beans overnight...I tend to cook thinks on a whim and this recipe requires planning.
I will make this again.  I was thinking of throwing in a handful of walnuts for some reason...just for some bite.  Sounds odd but might be delicious! :)

This is very good, I use salt pork in this recipe and leave the salt out, cause the salt pork puts enough salt. This is my mothers recipe when we where little, she always said use salt pork and never add salt when you use salt pork. I also rather used salt pork I have to cut up myself instead od the sliced stuff they slice in the super market.

I made a few alterations. I used salt pork instead of bacon and only 1 tsp of salt. Other than that I followed the ingredients to the letter. I soaked my beans overnight, drained them. I didn't simmer them, since I'd never seen my mom do that, instead I threw them in my ceramic bean pot with all the other ingredients and let them go in my oven at 350 all afternoon. I checked every so often adding water as needed, testing the beans for doneness, and took them out when they tasted right. Couldn't be easier. Delicious flavor. The ketchup made them taste a little different than the true Boston baked beans I grew up with, but I actually like these better. Way more flavor. Great recipe.

We had a bbq potluck at work and I was chosen to bring baked beans. I wanted to take something other than just out of a can beans. I had never made my own baked beans before but found this recipe and it seemed easy so I thought I would give it a shot. Let me begin by saying.........FANTASTIC!!! Everyone loved them. There is one person who does not eat pork so I made them without the bacon and they still came out great. I can not wait to make these again but with bacon this time. Let me note that besides omitting the bacon, I followed the recipe to a tee maybe that's why some people complained in earlier reviews that they are a bit too salty for them so just cut the salt to 1 tsp or omit entirely. I do not have a 2 quart baking dish so I used a regular  9x13 pan I covered the beans with the reserved juice, baked for an hour and 1/2, uncovered, added a bit more juice and stirred, baked uncovered for another hour, stirred in a bit more juice and baked for another hour and they came out perfect. I did not give this 5 stars but JUST because of the cooking time but I am definitely keeping this recipe and it will become a family fav.  Thank you so much!

These were the WORST baked beans I ever tried. Screw the oven method, they were way too dry, not enough seasoning or sauce to save them. Slow cooker method, not much better. I wasted a fair amount of expensive ingredients on this recipe, will NEVER do so again. EVER.

Delicious!  I have made these twice.  The first time, I used the ingredients as the recipe was written. The second time, I added 1/4-1/2 tsp cayenne.  Both times I put the beans in my slow cooker (on low for 6 hours) after simmering them for 45 mins.

Excellant recipe, I followed some other reviews and cooked it in slow cooker.  Soaked beans overnight, no simmer, slow cook on high for 10 hours.  This was my first shot at this recipe so I will make some adjustments to account for personal taste

This was my first attempt at baked beans and eveyone loved them!  Since we were in the midst of a heat wave,  I soaked beans overnight, drained and, using fresh water, cooked in slow cooker set at 3 1/2 for about 5 hours till tender.  I drained, reserving 2 cups of liquid, added the rest of the ingredients and baked for about 1 1/2 hours without a lid.  I was a little upset because they were pretty runny, but didn't want to overcook them, so just turned off the oven.  When I went to take them out an hour later, they had a nice dryness on top, but were almost too thick! (Quickly remedied by adding some reserve liquid...)  Will definitely make again.  Even though there are only 2 of us, they freeze well and much prefer homemade to anything in a can!

WAY TOO SWEET!  I had to wash half the beans off to mellow out the flavour of all that sugar.  The molasses would have been enough, but everyone else seemed to say it was good the way it was. Will not make again :(

This was the first time I had ever made baked beans from scratch, and these were really good! The only thing I would change in this recipe (my husband suggested it), was maybe a little more brown sugar. Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

Not sure how to rate this since mine turned out fantastic, but I made necessary change to make it so.  It has great ingredients though.  I did a 16 oz pkg of navy beans, and salt only to taste.  I cooked the bacon and onion in a cast iron dutch oven and then added the rest of the ingredients. I cooked my beans about 1/2 way in boiling water. I poured off the water and rinsed with cold water to stop the cooking while I was making the sauce.  I put in the beans and added an appropriate amount of water.  I cooked in dutch oven at 350 checking every 1/2 hour.  It took 1 1/2 hours and they were fantastic!  So yummy!!!!

I'm very new to cooking with beans and had tried a few other recipes before I found this one for Boston Baked Beans.  WOW is all I can say!!!!!!  These came out absolutely terrific!  I actually tripled the recipe and what a delicious taste!  I used five different kinds of dried beans and used my crockpot - it came out perfect!  I think the whole key to this recipe is the layering technique & cooking the sauce before pouring it over the beans, bacon and onions.  This recipe is a keeper for sure!!

Great recipe. I made the mistake of using half canned white beans and 1/2 dry pinto beans, and they didn't get quite cooked all the way through after 2 hours in the oven. Take your time with this and do it right, it will be delicious. Next time i make these I will most likely cook the bacon first as well, modifying it.

Fabulous. Some dry bean recipes leave you with broken teeth but not this one. I had everything on hand but bacon, so I had to go vegetarian-style. Added a touch of olive oil and extra salt to make up for the absence of bacon fat; vegetarians, this works!

Perfect! Everyone at the cookout LOVED these and they're not even accustomed to baked beans. I followed the instructions precisely and only substituted Great Northern beans for Navy and used turkey bacon (I don't do pork). It didn't specify how to encorporate the bacon; but after a little research, I decided to precook the bacon for the bottom layer and leave the top layer uncooked, and cut all into 1-2" pieces. I used a cast iron Dutch oven and they turned out amazing. Thanks!

I made this recipe in a crockpot - low for 10 hours.  Only had to add a little water about mid way through.  Everyone loved it!  We didn't have any leftovers.

Very good!  But I soaked them for 8 hours and then boiled them for about an hour and they were very close to being done already.  I cooked them on LOW overnight and they were definitely done.  10-20 hours was definitely not needed.

Added 1/8 tsp of liquid smoke and a full pkg of bacon.  Cut bacon in pieces and cook.  Remove and cook onion in bacon grease.  When onions are cooked, removed with slotted spoon and put on paper towels.

This was a great recipe! After making it once, I added a few things of my own. Following the same prep, I added 1/4 tsp of celery seeds and 1/4 cup of maple syrup. The ends result was excellent! Better than the original.

These beans were delicious but a little salty.  I did however make a few revisions of my own.  I used the crockpot and I cooked the bacon a bit before adding it to the beans.  I also added chopped green peppers to the recipe and sauteed those with the onions, in the bacon fat, before adding them to the pot.  Lots of flavor and yummy but I will certainly cut down on the salt for the next batch.

These are wonderful.  I made mine in the crock pot.  I doubled the sauce to avoid dryness.  I used the origal amount of salt.  It was perfect.  The flavour is wonderful.  I was a little uneasy.  All the reviews say it takes a lot of time.  I simmered mine from 7 until 8 am.  Then I placed them in the crock pot in layers at 8 am....and they will be completely done by 2 pm....I cheated and ate a bowl a little early.  I've been afraid of making home made baked beans from scratch all this time for nothing.

I loved these beans. I used salt pork, because that is what I used to growing up with Grandma's recipe (which I lost). I did cook in the crockpot after soaking over night and cooking beans for about an hour. I added more brown sugar and some maple syrup near the end cooking. I prefer them a little sweeter. But yummmmm

Oh my goodness these were fantastic.  I soaked the beans overnight for about 10 hrs.  I only simmered them for an hour.  Then I threw everything together in the crockpot.  I doubled the sauce and used the reserved water to make sure the beans were all covered.  After 8 hrs I removed the lid and cooked 2 more hours to thicken up the sauce.  It is quite a process but super easy.  They taste way better than canned beans and you get so much more for the price!

Delicious!  We doubled the recipe and made this in our cast iron Dutch oven to serve with a ham dinner.  For those concerned about saltiness, remember bacon is very salty.  Omit added salt and cut back on the bacon if this is a concern.

This was awesome. Really it wasn't terribly difficult just required some planning. I made them exactly as written except I made a little extra sauce half way through baking but that was just personal taste. Very much worth the time.

This tastes like beans from a "jar" only better. I used half the salt and I think it also tastes good if you use a heavy maple syrup instead of molasses. The syrup makes it a little sweeter. This recipe is good with or without my tweeks.

Wonderful!  I substituted cooked ham for the bacon.  Next time I would omit the salt though since pork has so much to begin with.

I liked this recipe, however my husband and my 2 year old son LOVED it! I found it a little sweet, so I'm going to use only 2 tbsp of molasses next time. I also added 2 cloves of crushed garlic, no salt and used 2 tbsp of onion powder instead of onion because my husband can't eat onions. I also placed the beans with the water and the rest of the ingredients in the crock pot for 8 hours on low. Will definitely make this again! Thanks for the recipe!

I am so glad I found this recipe! I have been making most of my food from scratch, because I have become a lot more conscious of what is in the processed foods we eat. This means no baked beans and certainly no barbecue sauce. These are so much better than store bought! I added onion powder, liquid smoke, and used a teaspoon of brown sugar. I make this sauce and use it on it's own! Thank you for such a good recipe!

Outstanding just as written.  However, I took  Sammy's advice (about 8 posts back) and added a  tsp of liquid smoke.  I think it improved the sauce and I think you'll like it, especially if you're from the South. Fantastic AJRHODES3.  Many thanks.

While it was flavorful I don't think it was worth all the trouble. Doctoring up a can of beans would have produced the same results.

This is a wonderful recipe as it stands. I made it according to the recipe but added quite a bit more molasses toward the end so it would get darker, and sweeter. I also added about 1/2 pound of ground beef, so it more like a meal instead of a side dish.

This is a great recipe.  Very tasty.  I doubled the sauce portion of the recipe with exception to the salt.  I probably shouldn't have doubled the pepper (although I liked it).  I also used ham instead of bacon because that is what I had on hand.  I let the beans bake all day in my oven at a lower temp and as suggested, removed the lid for a couple of hours to thicken up.  I love this recipe and will use it again!

Great base recipe but for my taste was WAY too sweet!!  I recommend tasting before adding sugar.  I also suggest cooking bacon prior to adding to beans as the texture of the bacon was not good!!  Will use the base recipe again with my own revisions

This is my go-to bean recipe and I've made it countless times exactly as written.  Tastes just like my grandmother's used to.  Tonight I made them using pinto beans (I have a 25 lb bag to use up) and I actually liked them even better, if that was possible!  I have found that if I cook them entirely in the crock-pot there is no need to soak them overnight.

All I can say is WOW. I despise beans and I think this is LOVELY. My dad says it reminds him of when he was a kid and the 'old church ladies' use to make really good beans. Which is a huge compliment.. I'm forced to make this at least once a week! Definitely worth a try, you won't be disappointed!

Wonderful!  I did as a few other commenters did, and made these in the slow cooker.  I soaked them for 8 hours or so, got them into the slow cooker, covered them with the sauce and then a bit of water.  I actually did this last night, and then before I left for work I started them on low.  This afternoon I turned them up to high for the last three hours and they came out absolutely perfect!  I used leftover ham (diced) instead of bacon.

These were delicious. The only cahnge I made was to use great northern beans instead of navy since it's what I had on hand. Next time I make I will probably skip the bacon just because I'm not a big fan.

I was looking for a recipe that didn't use canned baked beans, and this was exactly what I wanted. I doubled the sauce (except for the salt) per other reviewers suggestion, and it was just perfect. They had just the right amount of sweetness. Brought them to a cookout, and they were the first thing to go! I will use this recipe anytime I want delicious homemade baked beans.

This was a fabulous side dish!  We loved it!  I did alter the recipe some and used canned Navy beans.  I used some bacon grease and sautee'd the onions for about 5 minutes and added the rest of the ingredients, adding the beans and bacon last.  I used water in place of the cooking water and it was still wonderful!  Definitely a keeper!  Definite 5 stars!

I created this recipe in the slow cooker, as it is summer and it's impossible to put the stove on for that long...  Too hot!  I put it on "Low" for 10 hours and it turned our beautifully!  I omitted the salt and painstakinly removed what fat I could from the bacon.  Everyone loved it!  My husband said it tasted just like his moms.  I've make it twice since then.  I double the recipe because it freezes nicely and makes for a great lunch!

I started this the night before, cooking the beans with a meaty ham bone.  After simmering for a few hours, the beans were soft, so I removed the meat from the bone, drained the bean liquid (I used both white beans and baby lima's and it was great), mixed it all together with the called for ingredients and a small splash of liquid smoke, and set the crock pot to cook low over night.  About 2 hours before serving, I put the dish in the oven @ 350* to start, then down to 250* after it bubbled awhile, stirring occasionally.  Took it to a BBQ, and not one bean was left.  Good thing I tripled the recipe.   These were not runny, so easy to eat with out them running all over your plate.  The ham was a bonus, so I will do it like that again.

This is a fantastic recipe!  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because mine were a bit too watery.  I had to raise the oven temperature at the end and cook them for 10-15 mins longer to get them to the right consistency.  The taste was perfect!

This is the first bean recipe that I have made that actually lived up to its claim. Everyone liked them. Some more than others but overall it was a win. I did the soak the beans overnight and stopped the cooking when the beans were Al Dente. When the beans were baked in the oven they finished cooking through and tasted great. The texture and the flavor was what I would expect if I had ordered them in a restaurant.

Very nice!!! My husband absolutely loved these beans. We added a ham hock and some pieces of pork with bones and a couple of cloves of crushed garlic. This came out very delicious. One thing though, next time I might omit the brown sugar as we both found it a little sweet. I think the molasses would give it enough sweetness. This is definately a keeper and worth taking the time to make. Thank you for sharing this with us all.

Great home-made flavour. The only deviations I made were to use smoked bacon bones instead of bacon and maple syrup for molasses since I didn't have any.Cooked everything in slow cooker for 8 hours. Didn't put salt, seeing that the bacon bones were already salty. Everyone who ate wanted seconds. Yum!

These are really good! My beans were tender after cooking so I only baked them for 2 hours and they were perfect. I also doubled the sauce and mixed everything in a bowl before baking. Super recipe, I will never buy canned baked beans again! Thanks!

The Saturday before Memorial Day 2009.  Tried your Boston Beans and it was just what I was looking for, where, I cook my beans first.  This is easy, great and everyone should try it once.  I have a 20 year old grandson who does not eat beans at all and a 15 year old who will eat them but does not care a great deal about beans. Next time I cook them I will start with 4 lbs. of beans.  The 2 boys ate all the beans and I got to taste them. Go easy on the potato salad and bar be que and do lot of beans. From 1 happy granny in Texas.

Good.  The flavor of the beans came through well.  A bit too much molasses for my taste.  I think I will halve next time I make this.

These are better than the recipe that is kept a secret by the dog.  The only thing I can say is that it takes two hours for the beans to get tender and I did what someone else did and doubled the sauce.  They were a big hit.  Thanks so much no more buying baked beans in this house.

Absolutely wonderful taste.  My changes: 1 lb of pinto beans instead of navy beans.  I doubled the sauce ingredients and after the beans had boiled for about 90 minutes, I put them in the crock pot with all the bacon, the sauce and some of the water, turned it on high (about 325) and left them for about 8 hours.  They were still a bit firm, but I like my beans that way. I'd imagine that more time = softer beans.

These beans were the first I have ever tried.  The flavor was great, I tried to follow the recipe exactly for the first go around.  I did take the advice to cook the bacon first, I wasn't sure if I should cook it crisp or not, so I cooked it in the oven on 400 for 7 minutes.  Everyone loved the flavor, but we all decided I should have doubled the sauce as they were awfully dry.  I simmered the beans for 1 hour as they had soaked a lot longer than I had planned.  I believe they cooked in the oven for 3 hours.  Still I little hard, but I didn't want them to get drier.

I cook for about 30 people at an assisted living home & they love this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly (except I use northern beans instead of navy) the first time around and they loved it.  The 2nd time I used canned northern beans so I could skip the overnight soaking & boiling and they couldn't tell the difference.

I was looking for a classic baked bean recipe using dried beans, and this fit the bill perfectly.  I doubled this recipe, soaked and precooked the beans as recommended.  They turned to mush--next time I'd skip boiling the beans before they're baked, and I'd also pre-fry the bacon before adding it to the beans.  They were fabulous, but shoe leather would be fabulous combined with that much bacon fat.  Wonderful flavor, though, and perfect amount of sauce and spices.  I added a little liquid smoke per another review, and some extra molasses because I didn't have any brown sugar.  I'll make this again and again!

This was the first time I had ever made baked beans from scratch. I thought they were easy and very good. I did add about a tablespoon of finely diced bell pepper before baking. I will make these again, possibly upping the sweetness a little. Thanks for sharing.

I recommend cooking the beans much less before baking and using about half the bacon. You may need to add a little more liquid if you precook then less. I choose to use a spicy honey mustard intead of ground mustard but the gound musterard is probably fine too. All in all, I would say these are great.

Excellent bean recipe.  I forgot the brown sugar and found it plenty sweet enough, with great flavor.  I only had time to bake the beans for 1 1/2 hours, I think with another hour or so they would have been perfect.  Great recipe, thank you for sharing!

I made the recipe exactly as written and while I thought the sauce part was very good, I had issues with the beans, especially the one another reviewer had mentioned about the beans falling apart after so much cooking. I'll hang onto the sauce part of the recipe, but I'm using canned beans next time and adjusting the cooking time.

I am used to a more spicy bean. I added some cinnamon to kick it up a bit. Still, it was a very good basic recipe and like other cooks mentioned, it was the only "from scratch" recipe on this site. Thanks for posting it!!!!!

I am not a gigantic fan of the result of this recipe.  The cooking times yielded a VERY mushy pot of baked beans.  Will keep searching for something a little more solid!  Favors were great though!

These are good but no better than Bush's Baked Beans from the can. I have no complaints about the recipe, and I followed it exactly. Everyone thought the beans were great. However, although the recipe is easy to follow, it is also time-consuming. And I don't think, in this case, it's worth the extra time to make these beans homemade when Bush's is just as good, faster, and cheaper. If you want the glory of homemade baked beans, then this recipe is for you.

I have never attempted making baked bean before now so I can't compare this to any other recipe.  I did all of the cooking in the microwave (at the lowest setting) it was very hot today and I didn't want the oven on for hours. These were excellent beans, I cut down the sugar and I need to add more water during cooking.  I will be making these again for sure.

I soaked the beans for 17 hrs (I know.. a long time.. overnight+all day while I was at work!), came home and boiled them for a little under an hour and they were good to go. I followed the recipe, but couldn't find a 2qt dish, so I used a 8x8... and it was really full! Halfway through, I realized there was just too much liquid and it was watering down the taste (probably my fault for using the wrong size dish), so I made another batch of the sauce and mixed it in with the beans, baked it for the rest of the time, and it turned out great! Great flavor! Like another reviewer said, they taste similar to the can, so I'm not sure it's worth all that time, but I'm not too picky and the can taste fine to me. Oh and I only used 4 strips of bacon. Anyway, thanks!

I only use this recipe now.  I use bacon ends and pieces instead of bacon slices and just start to cook them before adding them to the bean mixture.

Good, but I had to add 1/2 c more brown sugar.  I like them sweet.

I followed the recipe except that I left out the bacon and used some tomato paste in place of half the ketchup (I ran out of ketchup).  Great flavor...just a bit too sweet for me.  Next time I will try replacing the ketchup entirely with tomato paste and maybe cut back on the brown sugar...or maybe try replacing the sugar with maple syrup to make it a bit healthier.

These were good.  I didn't cook my beans long enough so they were a bit tough--my fault though, not the recipe's.  The flavor was very good, however, I'm not sure they tasted that different from canned beans to justify all the time it took to do these.

I made these beans for my Brother's first annual Octoberfest. Scaled the recipe to 15 servings and added a bit more molasses and brown sugar. I used a ham hock in addition to about half the bacon as well. After baking I cut up the ham from the ham hock and added it right to the beans. Everyone loved them!! This is a great recipe and I plan to make them for any large family gatherings in the near future. Thanks for the recipe Anita!!!

This must be the best baked beans ever!  Quit using the canned varieties; they don't hold a candle compared to this.  I used my slow cooker instead of the oven, lining it with foil for easy cleanup.  My one and only addition was adding two jalapeno peppers to one of the two batches I made for people who liked their beans with a kick!

These were really good but I probably won't ever make the effort to do it again. Too much time involved and no better than the kind in a can. I do think this had way too much onion flavor.

This was good, but felt it was missing something or needed more flavor.  At the same time this might have been my fault since I added smoked sausage slices instead of the bacon (to turn it more into a main meal instead of side dish).  Once I doubled the amount of ketchup, dry mustard, and brown sugar it was pretty darn good.  Also added some smokey tobasco.

These were pretty good. I like the idea of soaking your own beans instead of using canned, but I think these could be spicier. I will make them again, but maybe tweak a few things.

Not a lot of work, just a lot of time.  Tastes pretty close to the canned stuff. It's good but we probably won't make it again.

These were good, but better the next day.  I added some liquid smoke.  I think I would have liked a bit more of a 'barbeque'-type flavor, but otherwise these were great.

This was wonderful !!!  I made it pretty much like the recipe stated, I used less bacon though.  I had my doubts at the beginning with the sauce, it did not seem like very much in comparison to the beans, but it worked out beautifully.  I will be making this at work for a barbecue and am certain it will be a hit.  Thank you for sharing.

Excellent, I made this for a 4th of July feast in Germany - There is no molasses at our little store so I used Zuckerrueben Syrup (sugar beet) and it worked out great!  We sure miss our at home beans but this was a good treat!

I made this dish trying to emulate my grandmother's baked beans, and it came very close!  I used 1 cup each of navy, great northern, pinto, and lima beans.  My grandmother uses kidney beans in her's, so that's an alternative too.

No one but me liked this one. It was good as far as beans go. I found it tasted a little to peppery for my liking. Probably won't make this again since my family didn't care for it.

I love these baked beans. The only change I make is that I use 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 maple syrup. I've lost count of the times I've made them and everyone raves about them. Thank you for posting this recipe.

One of my kids asked for baked beans, so I made this recipe per the ingredients, or maybe with slightly less salt (I didn't really measure it). I did adapt it for my pressure/slow cooker: Soaked the beans overnight, pressure cooked on the bean setting in the morning (35 min), then stirred in the remaining ingredients, slow cooked 7 hours. My kids didn't check when they got home but 2 hours later (keep warm setting), they were fabulous. I don't care that much for beans but I liked these a lot and my kid ate three bowls!

The beans were outstanding so much better than. Using canned beans and doctoring them up. I was short on time so I cooked a bag of rinsed, presoaked beans in the Instant Pot for 20 minutes then added them (beans only) along with the sautéd onion and bacon and doubled the sauce to a casserole dish. I cooked for about an 90 minutes in the oven, everyone loved them. I did not add salt, and did add Worcestershire, not too sweet or salty.

Delicious recipe! I only made one change. America's Test Kitchen suggests that if you really want a creamy, smooth texture without mushy, gluey beans (and no split beans)that you should brine them. I simply added 1T salt to enough water to make 2 quarts with beans and soaked overnight. I did simmer the beans in the brining solution but discarded it before baking. I added fresh water to the pot for that step. The beans turned out perfectly seasoned with great texture! Definitely a keeper!

I really like this recipe, but it has one fatal flaw. I point this out only because of so many people who have gotten sick with neurological disorders, like M.S. Never use the same water that you have soaked the beans in overnight. It's very possible that they have pesticides still on them.
That's the poop. All else was fine.

Couldn't eat it. Followed directions exactly but the beans turned out very oniony and mushy/overcooked.

This was a huge hit at a recent party. The only change I made was I cooked it in a crockpot instead of the oven. It turned out great.

I didn't make any changes on the initial take.  Then I tweaked it a bit but the original recipe is good to go.  Thank you.  Boston Baked Beans are the only beans I care for as a side dish.

I made this last night and I would make it again!  This was super easy, tasty and a crowd pleaser.  

My changes:  
We had a vegetarian in this group so I omitted the bacon.  The beans were STILL so good.  The next time the bacon goes in. 

I started this too late so I decided to make this in the Instant Pot.  I did not soak the beans ( I never soak beans). I cooked them for 30 mins , released pressure,  then added all the ingredients  straight into the pot, then pressure cooked for another 30 mins.  Viola!  It was done and delicious!

Changed the ketchup to pureed tomatoes added hamburger meat.  Requested as part of a farewell meal.  Teenagers tried them and loved the sweetness.  Will definitely make again.

I made a quick version of this using an Instant Pot that turned out well. I didn’t soak them but cooked Great Northern beans with 8 cups of water on high pressure for 30 minutes and did natural release for an additional 20. Meanwhile, I browned sausage in a large pot and added the other ingredients to make the sauce. Drained the beans and added to sauce. Delicious!

It was very easy.  The flavor was nice. I added a bit of Tabasco sauce so the vinegar would brighten it up a bit and it gave it a mild heat that I like. I did not use any salt except what I used to simmer the beans.   I never soak my beans either.  I have never had a problem.   So yes to those people who want to know, this is a sweet recipe.  The amount of sugar is a clue. :)  I used home made bacon which was also sweet.  These are akin to canned baked beans but fresher tasting and you control the ingredients. In my opinion a little vinegar or lemon brightens and offsets the sweet. I will do it again. I served with ribs and slaw.

I like the overall flavor but turned out too thick.  I followed the recommendations of others and used a crockpot.  After only 6 hours, the beans were starting to burn on the sides and bottom of the crockpot and it was very thick.

Delightful. The first time I made this, I didn't let the beans simmer enough. This time I did, and it was excellent. The flavour was a bit sweet and savoury. I doubled the recipe and it was all gone within a few days. I also made the black bread recipe on all recipe to go with this and it was perfect together. A hearty meal that felt like a treat.

This is now a firm favourite.  I increased the amount of ketchup to offset some of the molasses flavour.  Every one enjoys these beans.

Too salty and lacking flavor.  My step dad seriously doctored it to make it taste good.  I simmered these for about 18 hours.  I did cook some of the moisture out of the bacon which didn’t really yield oil as I hoped.  It must have been the brand of bacon.  I don’t think that was the problem as it was still a little raw as It went into the crock pot.

yeah, this is good. I subbed out the bacon for salt pork. By hour 3.5, it had a nice brown thick layer on top of goodness. My husband just scarfed down the whole plate, this is definitely going to become a monthly staple!

I made these beans and they came back out very good.  I had to add water to them while they were cooking as the liquid seemed to evaporate quickly.  I’m making them again for our 4th of July party.

I made this in an Instant Pot. I doubled the recipe(because it is so good). Combined all the ingredients( beans dry)in the IP and set it for 45 minutes with a natural release.  The only adjustment I made is to replace the brown sugar with 2 tablespoons of honey.

Great recipe. Mom use to start with B&M beans but can not find them anymore. This is close to hers though.

Great Recipe.  I didn't soak the beans overnight and instead boiled them for an hour before using.  Worked great!

Made exactly as written, but unfortunately they did not turn out. The flavor was ok, but I had to add so much water to keep cooking them that the flavor was weak. I soaked the beans overnight, simmered for two hours, and baked for 5+ hours and the beans still weren’t tender.! You really need to add too much liquid to keep them baking for that long. Terrible.  They were so dry, the ingredients don’t make a sauce at all for the beans.

Firstly, I sure wish all posters would remember to include what the recipe yields. It’s very hard to guess. Unless I missed it, I see no yield info?

Secondly, maybe I did something wrong? I doubled this recipe to make enough for about 20 people, and it was very dry. In the end I think I’ve used at least 4x the sauce instructions, using a heavy Dutch oven in my oven at 350 degrees. And the beans are still a bit tough. I’ve got it in the oven for another 25 minutes. I did add some water x3, and still very dry.

But, I think the flavor is very nice, and super close to what my Irish cousins in Boston make, so I wanted to give 5 stars if I wasn’t missing the two noted things and thanks for sharing your family’s recipe !

I made this about a year ago, a double batch, my first time making baked beans entirely from scratch.  I didn't use ketchup, used some tomato sauce and upped the molasses.  Used some whole grain mustard instead of mustard powder. 
 Used a little less bacon.

Made for a friend's birthday, he and his sisters love beans, they grew up poor and they ate a lot of beans.  Both he and his two sisters said they were the best ever... high praise indeed.

Authentic or not, a great baked beans recipe, I'm just about to pick over my beans and get ready to make some for tomorrow.  I'm a pretty accomplished cook, nearly 60 yo, and it's rare I think I wouldn't change a thing next time.  Well, I will be using some side pork instead of bacon this time, but that's minor. 

I made an account to review this, thank you so much.

I hate to say it, but miles better than my mother's

Good base recipe but I added a lot more of the ingredients to achieve the desired taste and I used chopped ham instead of bacon. I also used my slow cooker but I didn't pre soak the beans as I never do. I forgot the type of beans I used but I don't think they were navy. Can't seem to find my amended recipe.

First time making these, followed everything to the letter and they turned out fantastic. A bit more detail on what type of molasses though would have helped, sulphured vs unsulphered. No biggie, I figured it out and went with the unsulphered and I opted for the Great Northern beans instead of the navy. Everything came out great, thankyou!

This was the perfect meal to test my new Dutch Oven with. It did a great job :) I let it slow cook all night after testing it after 3 hours. It still needed a bit, but it cooked overnight and was great.

The last hour when you take the lid off,  take a cup of beans out and mash them and put them back in to thicken the beans.

Not a fan at all. Maybe I’m just used to baked beans that are more rich and thick but the consistency and flavor were lacking in my opinion. I followed the recipe exactly as written.

I used to enjoy these as a kid growing up in New Hampshire.  I have tried a couple different recipes and this one will be my go to!  It was relatively easy, just takes a little time, but worth the wait.  I like to follow a recipe as stated the first time, but because I was out of bacon I used 1/2 a pound of salt port cut in small chunks and rendered it part way before adding it.  I also did add a little maple syrup at the end for both the texture and sweetness.  They were great and my husband loved them!!

These beans are delicious, great flavor. I cut back on the salt to 1 tsp. Used ham hock. They definitely needed some added liquid after 2 hrs in the oven.

PERFRECT!  It was all I was hoping for. Went to friends' for dinner and brought this - even toddlers loved them.    I did a power soak - boiled the beans for 2 mins, let it set for 1 hour, then simmered for 1 1/2 hrs before combining all ingredients and baking 2 1/2 hrs.      I doubled the sauce except for doubling the brown sugar, and, I omitted the salt since I had 6 strips of bacon in there. (just conscious of my salt intake).  Came out great, and pretty.      Next time, I think I will use the  Instapot  up until I combine everything and bake.

This was a good recipe as is, however i took it overboard a bit and chunked up ham with the beans and used red onion and layered it all in the casserole dish first. The sauce I found was too watery and wouldn’t thicken up so while it was boiling I added 1/3 cup of xanthum gum to it to create a really nice sweet molasses brown sugar sauce that was the consistency of pasta sauce. Stirred that amongst the beans and ham in the casserole dish then added  crumbled bacon on top !
This turned it into crack Boston  baked beans  lol

This is a great recipe! It is one of the few on here that the first step doesn't require opening a can of baked beans...
I personally don't add salt because the bacon adds enough for my taste. I did a little bit of dressing up as well to make it a little bit more southern. But again this is a great recipe and should have 5 stars.

I pretty much followed the recipe except I did do like one other person said and doubled the sauce . I left the beans soak well over 24 hours , I drained and rinsed them, then put them in the crock pot. Added the double sauce and several times over the next 10 hours I added small amounts of water . They were such a hit for a pig roast I was attending .

This was delicious but next time I'll add more bacon, less salt and more brown sugar.

I love this recipe and have made it many times over the years.  My family loves this recipe as well.  This recipe has the perfect amount of salty sweetness.  Sooooo many recipes call for using canned baked beans and adding MORE brown sugar- yeckhhhh.  Try this recipe its so worth it.

I made exactly as the recipe called for. It turned out perfect and taste great. I wanted a recipe that didn't call for canned beans or worse yet canned baked beans. This is one is a keeper.

I have had homemade beans my entire life growing up in a French Canadian family. This recipe is even better then my mother's. I followed the directions but replaced the bacon with pork belly and also added a 1/4 cup of smoky bbq sauce. The beans were fantastic. I will be using this recipe from now on.

A little time consuming, but very easy to make. Well worth the extra effort for 100% homemade baked beans. I was scared it would not make enough, but I was able to feed 6 people and still had leftovers. Definitely will be making this again!

Made your recipe for a 4th of July BBQ Pool Party and it was perfect! I made it the day before allowing time for the flavors to really marry and it was delicious. This was my first time making Baked Beans and your recipes was very easy. Definitely making again. Thank you!

I made this for my Father-in-law and followed the directions. He absolutely loved them and I inherited his family bean pot. I soaked the beans over night and did as it said (except I cut the bacon into bite size pieces) they turned out amazing! I highly recommend this recipie.  I will be making it over and over again.  Just remember, home made beans take lots of time, if you don’t rush it, you will be successful!

Baked these in a dutch oven and everyone raved about them. Such a nice change from canned baked beans that always seem to come out mushy.

I made these for a Summer Party.  I used my crockpot to cook them.  I soaked the beans over night then put into the crockpot, layering with the bacon, onions (and added some minced garlic) (I actually multiplied the recipe x 4, because I was having a lot of guests and used 2 crockpots).  I followed the sauce recipe, then added it into the crockpots with enough water to cover the beans.  In my opinion, the sauce recipe needs to be doubled or at least 1.5x, otherwise, the water really dilutes the flavor.  I cooked them on low for about 14 hours., then turned them on warm after that.  A couple hours before serving, I turned them back on low.  They were delicious!!!

My MIL used to cook her own baked beans from scratch for my husband all the time. He wanted me to try to make him some and the recipe she gave me was not exactly what he remembered (she said she never put bacon in hers but he specifically remembers there being bacon lol). So basically I merged this one and hers together. Substituted a jar of great northern beans for navy beans.  I used a bit more ketchup and brown sugar, and used regular mustard, not dry, added about a lb of ground round along with some sautéed onions. No salt added. I also used about 3/4-1lb of bacon-hard to tell exactly how much since I tend to eat it as its cooking ;)Forgot to mention that I just slow cooked it on the stove top in a stock pot. Husband loved it, kids didn't but they don't like any beans except green beans. I don't really like beans either, baked or otherwise and even I thought they were pretty good, Will be making these again. And again.

Huge hit. I added a chopped bell pepper. Cooked it in the crock pot on low, as others did, for about 20 hours. Followed all other prescribed instructions.

BOSTON BAKED BEANS What I did- Soak the beans overnight, then gently boil/simmer for 2 hours. Add all the ingredients EXCEPT THE KETCHUP AND SALT to the crock pot. Cover with just enough water to come to the top of the beans or a little less. II used salt pork and after the beans cooked in the crock pot I shredded the pork. Cooked on low for about 16 hours. At the last 2 hours add the ketchup, salt and I added a little bit of tomatoe paste about 1 tbl. You can add a little more of the molasses

Made these today in the crock pot. The best beans I’ve ever made! I suddenly black eyed beans that I had soaked over night then simmered for about n hour. Because I didn’t have much ketchup in the house, I swapped it for Sweet

Fantastic!  I soaked the beans overnight. Layered everything into my crockpot, cooked on low for 8 hours.  I don’t see how anyone could say the beans were still crunchy. I read one review that said they cooked them in the crockpot for 20 hours. I call bs on that one.  It would have turned into a gooey burnt paste.  Did not change or alter any ingredients and it was awesome! Hubs loved it!

I followed the suggestion of "JP" who reviewed this recipe 1/27/2005 and made it in the crock pot.  Since I'm vegetarian, I didn't add bacon.  I soaked the beans overnight and then dumped the beans (including the liquid--although the beans had soaked up quite a bit of it) and the other ingredients into my crock pot.  Stirred everything and then cooked on low for a full day.  I stirred it periodically but did not add any more water.  The beans were cooked but not soft/mushy like canned beans.  Flavor was OK--didn't knock my socks off (maybe because I didn't add bacon).  I may come back to this recipe after trying others.

This is an excellent recipe for baked beans.  I make a double batch a few times a year for my tribe of young men, it is a favourite for sure!  The only adjustment I make is using tomato sauce instead of ketchup.  Thank your for sharing.

In-cred-ible.  I cut the sugar down to 2T.  Next time,  maybe I'll cutting all the sugar and half the salt.   But just as it is, this are most wonderful.  Pair it with Heritage Corn bread!

After soaking the beans overnight I cooked them in the same water, then added them to the sauce and baked them. I only added a tsp of salt and found that to be perfect. Delicious

Decadent bean goodness! This totally makes a hit as a side to slow cooker pulled pork and some sweet slaw. I use a six ounce can of tomato paste and 1/2 tsp ground cloves in place of ketchup. Pinto or northern beans will work fine if you don’t have any navy beans on hand.

I left out the salt as Canadian bacon has enough of that haha and I soaked the beans a lot longer because of previus experience with navy beans.   It's true.......these are the best baked beans I've ever tasted and so easy to make.  I will definitely be making them again.

Wonderful! 
Instead of ketchup I doubled the brown sugar. And added 1.5 cups tomatoes, blended with the onions for the highly sensitive texture people in our family. Served with a heavy, full-flavored Anadama bread, and honeydew melon. 
We all loved it... down to the youngest child.

This was fantastic. Only change I made was to sub half the molasses with maple syrup, only because we were feeding toddlers, too. Rave reviews. 2qt casserole dish was too small—size up.

Amazing. I boiled the beans in a cast iron Dutch oven, which really helped them soften up. Needless to say, my bean pot was emptied in just one dinner!

One thing no authentic "Boston" baked bean recipe would EVER include is ketchup!!  No hint of tomato flavor whatsoever should be detected in any way ... that is a major no no, and it's what sets the commercial brand B&M (still the most authentically New England tasting commercial version) apart from the other national (mostly midwestern variety) brands.

Amazing recipe! I love "old fashioned" baked beans, which, here in Quebec, normally have some maple syrup in them, so I added about 1/2 cup real maple syrup to the recipe. YUM! Will definitely be making this again. And again =)

We used the same ingredients only substituting 3 cans of already cooked white beans for the dried beans, fried and drained the bacon, and then cooked it in a slow cooker for 4 hours...just incredible results.

I soaked overnight and skipped the simmering. I doubled the ingredients and made mine in the pressure cooker. Everything else was made just like the recipe called for except the sugar which I only used a tablespoon. Sweetness was just right.  Cooked for 45 minutes and left in pot for and hour to bring pressure down. Beans were tender and wonderful. This is a keeper.

I'm not ordinarily a bean person, but with this recipe, I'll make the exception. There was just the right amount of sweetness that I would expect from Boston Baked Beans   By making sure there was always sufficient water to just barely cover the beans while baking ensured they were moist and full of flavor.

It took a long time to make this and I wasn't impressed.  I like Bushes baked beans in a can better.  I thought freshly made would taste better but it didn't.  I made it for a large BBQ we hosted and have so much leftover.  Not looking forward to finishing it.

I was really worried about making baked beans from scratch, but my husband really wanted some.  His grandpa use to make them from scratch and he really missed having them. I found this recipe and decided to give it a try. WOW! One in the win column for me. Thanks very much I will be using this and only this recipe in the future.

The flavoring was perfect, but I did not cook the beans long enough - they were still hard.  Soak them longer and cook them longer than the recipe calls for.

These beans are absolutely the BEST !!!  I was looking for a recipe to take to my husband's family reunion (about 55 people) and chose this because of the wonderful reviews.  I made the recipe exactly as stated and doubled it.
Everyone was crazy for these beans, asked for the recipe and we came home with an empty dish.   Thank you so very much for sharing this fabulous recipe!!

These are the best baked beans ever!!
Normally I use dry beans but I was invited to a cookout and had to make them quick.  I used canned navy beans and followed the recipe.
Fantastic!!

(I accidentally submitted the previous review without finishing)... These baked beans were exactly what you would expect. They were simple and delicious. I used my pressure cooker and cooked the syrup like topping on my stovetop and added it in with the beans. It was phenomenal. Not too sweet, so you can indulge a little. Thank you for sharing!!

I decided to try my hand at homemade barbecue and wanted a baked bean recipe to complement the meat. This one was great! The taste test in my house is my picky 8 year old stepdaughter, and she loved this, asking for leftovers the next day. I followed the recipe as written except that after soaking the beans overnight and then simmering for 2 hours, they still were not soft enough for my liking, so I put them in the pressure pot for 30 minutes. Will skip the simmering and just use the pressure pot next time. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This was my first time making baked beans of any kind and I loved this recipe.  I did however change  a couple of things.  I added about 1/4 tsp of hot sauce and some  smoked ham hocs and didn't use the salt and they were quite delicious.  Thanks AJ!

This is a wonderful recipe! I do not often leave comments on recipes but this one is well deserved. I have made this countless times over the last several years. It is requested by my family anytime we have BBQ. All my family members have also asked for the recipe. I have made this as the recipe calls for several times soaking the beans and all but I have also made it with canned beans and it turns out great. I always double the recipe and use 8  15oz cans of navy beans drained.  Then I double the rest of the recipe. I also cut the bacon into bite size pieces. Then I just dump everything into the casserole dish and stir it a little. I bake for around an hour until it is nice and bubbly. Excellent recipe!

Made these to go with Fathers Day cookout. They were super delicious and I got several compliments. I did end up making more sauce to add as they cooked. Also took off the foil cover I had on for the last 30 minutes cooking which made the exposed bacon crunchy. Thank you Allrecipes for sharing such good recipe!

I admittedly skipped some steps and used canned beans, I doubled the recipe and used 4 cans of Navy Beans. Since I skipped steps one through three I cooked my bacon and sautéed my onions in the bacon grease until translucent and a bit golden. I then proceeded with making the sauce for the beans with the onions and bacon. I combined everything,poured into my casserole, and placed cooked bacon slices on top. I cooked for 30 minutes covered and 30 minutes uncovered at 350 and my family devoured them but I thought they needed a little something more (more garlic and mustard)... I would have given a 4.5 stars if I could have.

PERFECT! Followed the recipe exactly X3. Had a BIG party and these beans were the first thing gone. I am not an especially good cook and, until now, I have never been the one who's recipe everyone wanted. 
This was a proud moment for me. Now I have to bring them to every neighborhood party. 
THANKS!!

Really good flavor.  I did the quick soak method because I was short on time and a lot of my beans cracked after the 1-2hr simmer.  BUT, after cooking in the oven several hours, they did not get any mushier.  I took the others advice and halved the salt.  Seems perfect.

Love the recipe, but needed a Vegan option:  I of course substituted out the pig.  There is a soy based bacon I plan to insert in the beans.   With or without that, I think this recipe is a full on tasty delight!

This recipe is much like the home made beans my mom makes, pretty similar to Bush's too. I can already tell this is gonna be great, and I just mixed the ingredients in the crock pot. I didn't have bacon, but the beans were par-cooked with a ham hock. I cut down on the salt, about 1 tsp instead of 2. I think that tiny bit of Worcestershire makes a nice "rounded" flavor.

Being my very first attempt at baked beans, I wasn't quite sure what what to expect, either in making the dish or the taste end result.  I was pleasantly surprised with both.  It was easy to put together, and very tasty.  I stuck  to the recipe (except for salt--I did not add any, and even used no-salt ketchup!).  My normal way of cooking is to tweak every recipe.  I am glad I didn't experiment this time--this is definitely a keeper as-is!

Brought back memories of a recipe of a long time ago.  The same except salt pork and no salt in place of bacon and a little more sugar.  Fat back O.K. but easy on the salt.

I made this several years ago because it reminded me of my Mom's.  She has passed away, and I didn't have her recipe.  My family loved it, no matter what it is called.  If you've never made home made baked beans, definitely try it.  You can always add your own touches.

I made this as a double batch. I also did my beans a little different. I rinsed, then boiled for 5 mins. with a tablespoon of baking soda. I then drained and rinsed and boiled one more time on medium high heat for 20 minutes. After this I simmered my beans till they were almost soft.  I also browned my bacon in a sauce pan till they were just about brown, I then added my onions. After all of this I put my sauce in the crock pot added my onion bacon mixture, drained my beans and added them, mixed well and set to high for three hours.   I received rave reviews that afternoon.

I wasn't sure about the water so ended up more towards the maximum time at last stage. I did cut up the bacon into manageable sized pieces. It was delicious.

Oh these are heavenly.  I did them in a crockpot and the smell throughout the day was wonderful!  Thank you for an easy, but completely homemade version of Boston Baked Beans. My only change was cutting the salt, because my bacon was rather salty. Rolling my eyes at the "bean police" reviewers.  As a relative of Nathan Hale, I will continue to refer to this dish as "Boston" Baked Beans in honor of AJ's MIL.  Chef John has another version without ketchup, if that's to your liking.

I followed the recipe as written plus I added about 6 drops of liquid smoke.  I also put whole onions and pieces of salt pork in while it was  cooking.  My husband likes his beans a little sweeter so I increased the brown sugar to 1/2 cup. I cook these in my crock pot for 10 hours or until the beans are soft and the liquid is absorbed.

Great and Easy too! I didn't have all the ingredients for the sauce so used a low carb bbq sauce mixed with bean water from the cooked beans. I would just check on the beans every hour or so and added some more liquid if needed. In about 3 -4 hours it was done and delicious.

This is a good starting recipe that I substituted ham for the bacon and added a little yellow prepared mustard in addition to the dry. While I used the 1/4 brown sugar, that was a tad too sweet for me, so I'll reduce net time a bit.

This was absolutely delicious.  The recipe did not say whether the bacon should be left whole, cut up, or cooked before assembling - so I diced the bacon and sautéed it, poured off most of the fat and then stir fried the onions before putting in the casserole.  I found the beans to be a bit soft, so next time I would cut the cooking time by one hour (in the boiling process) and I only baked them in the oven for  3 hours, rather than 4.  The flavour was fabulous.

followed the recipe completely except cooked in the crockpot. Soaked the beans overnight and simmered on the stove although not until completely tender thinking they would get mushy after hours in the crockpot. Flavor was great but beans were a little firm for our taste but a triple recipe all went at a birthday party. After reading a few more reviews we will try simmering the beans until tender then adding the other ingredients.

Sorry, i keep trying to pst a review and hit 'return' on keyboard when in this app it is the 'done' or submit button, meaning several attempts have been incomplete. My point is to say this is a fine recipe and those wishing more 'authentic' Boston baked beans need only make a few changes. It'd be wise to taste as you go, adjusting accordingly. Try this:

Very very good! I always add in a little syrup or molasses or ketchup throughout the cooking process and adding the bean liquid throughout also. Definatly would make this recipe again.

After they were done, it needed something so I added 1/3 tsp of tumeric and 1/2 Tablespoon of paprika.  That was it!  Lots of raves about the beans!  Also, I agree with another cook who said it was too salty.  Next time I will cut salt in half.

Excellent! Everyone raved about this dish. I used canned beans instead of dried, Dijon mustard instead of dry, and cooked everything in a slow cooker on high heat for three hours. I cut up turkey hot dogs and added those the last hour. Fantastic. Thanks for this recipe.

This baked bean recipe...a side dish....was the favorite dish of the entire table. I cooked it in a crock pot overnight, added some water as directed.  I initially used half the salt in the recipe, but had to add a little salt at the end of cooking time.  Finished it off with a little  brown sugar at the end.  Fantastic.  These beans were devoured.

The sauce was rather runny, and the flavor was okay. Not a rich, tasty flavor like store bought baked beans, more like a watered down, slightly different tasting rendition. It was okay for what it was, but if you are looking to create a product comparable to store-bought, this is not the one.

I doubled the recipe as I was making this for a large group. The only change I made was a reduction of sugar by 50%. It still turned out way to sweet for our taste, no one wanted seconds. I think the combination of sugar and ketchup makes it to sweet. I'll make it again, but only add small amount of sugar if needed.

These were excellent.  I doubled the amount of "sauce." 

Also, my cooking times were somewhat shorter, both for simmering the soaked beans and for the baking. I ended up not removing the top of the baking pot or adding any reserved bean liquid.

This dish was quite good. I like that it uses all scratch ingredients. However, I should have been more careful to check the beans as they were simmering. I had set a timer for 90 minutes according to the recipe's direction of 1-2 hours and didn't bother to check them - They were very mushy. Luckily we had some canned great northern beans on hand so I just used those instead. (could have been my dried beans were really old? I don't know, but next time I'll pay more attention to them as they simmer).

Delicious! I definitely added spices (garlic powder, onion powder, chili flakes, less salt ~ maybe 1/2tsp, more pepper). Taste as you make the sauce, and once you add it to the beans! I added more wet mustard (didn't have dry) amd Worchestire sauce. PLUS I made a double batch of the sauce. And I added 1/2lb bacon, instead of 1lb. I only added water again once during baking. Baked for 4 hours; checked every hour.

This recipe is great! For a bit easier, use 1/2 package of dried navy beans ( 8 oz) and do the quick soak on package directions.  Boil 2 minutes covered, turn off heat, sit 1 hr. Drain off water till just covered, simmer 1 hr. This will be about 2 cups of beans that the recipe calls for.  Add chopped onion, simmer for 30 minutes, put on some jazz/swing music, add all other stuff and simmer for 2 hrs covered in pot. Take lid off last half hour to help thicken.

This is one of those great recipes that looks and tastes just familiar enough to those accustomed to the canned variety that they will try it, but blows the familiar out of the water in every way. My husband informed me as we were sitting down to dinner that he does not like baked beans, then cleaned his plate and happily ate leftovers the next day. I made these as written, except for doing a quick soak (bring beans to boil for 2 min, cover and remove from heat for 1 hr) instead of overnight due to time constraint. Update: the second time I made these, I discarded the soak water, used fresh water to simmer, and used the simmer water to bake. Makes for a slightly thinner sauce, but eliminates the gas factor after dinner! I also decreased the salt to 1 tsp both times and feel it is plenty.

So I made these following the crockpot directions and skipping the simmer for 2 hours.  Even after 20 hours in the crockpot on low, I still had to cook another 6 hours on high (and I did soak them first).  I used chicken stock to keep the fluid level up - not very much and the last 2 hours I threw in about 1/2 a cup of Makers Mark - they were very good and the amount of sauce was perfect, but next time I am going to use the stove top way and see how they come out.

My whole family really enjoyed these! The only change I made was to omit the salt, since the bacon added plenty. I simmered the beans for 2 hours and then put them in the crock pot. They did turn out a bit dry, but that was completely my fault-- I had the crock pot set on high and forgot to turn it down before heading out to a baseball game (which went into extra innings, naturally). I'll definitely make these again(sans the ballgame)!

This was my first time making baked beans so I guess I don't have much to compare to, but they were phenomenal! I did use a bit less bacon than listed (I just stopped adding it when I felt like there was alot..) and I did cut up the bacon prior to adding. I also took the foil off maybe an hour into baking because the sauce looked really thin, and it thickened up just enough. They are SOOO good.

No changes.  Terrific as is.  Perfect combination of mild sweetness and saltiness.

Excellent recipe. I made a few slight adjustments to fit my family's tastes. Versatile recipe for sure. This was our First time making homemade baked beans and it won't be the last using this great recipe.

The beans had great flavor but were very dry. I'd make them again but definitely increase the sauce.

Oh my goodness thank you! I was looking for a side dish, and every baked beans recipe called for baked beans!? I almost gave up! Well, since I was already cooking dinner, I used 2 cans of pinto beans. I eyeballed the ingredients, and it came out sooo gooood! Thank You! =D

Made this and followed recipe to a T! But after 4 hours cooking time beans where still not soft.  Now I don't know if I am just so use to eating canned beans or what, but I cooked them another almost 2  hours. So of course had to add more of the liquid ingredients.  Everyone loved them and said how yummy they where, so I think they next time I may try and tweak this a bit by doubling liquid and cooking time even more than that.

I am not sure why I got a wild hair to make my own from scratch, but I am glad I tried this recipe first.  They were delicious.  Not sure what I will do with so many beans, though.  :)

I made the recipe exactly as written and it was super good.  I have a bean pot that I got  many years ago and I cooked it in the pot.  Actually, I did cook it at 300 degrees for a longer period of time, but the ingredients were the same.

I have made this several times.  Canadians should be aware that Canadian ketchup has more sugar than American ketchup.  (8 tsp per half cup).  To compensate, reduce sugar by at least half and add up to I tablespoon of vinegar.  That way they won't be sweeter than the recipe writer intended.

I made this for a cookout and it was a big hit. I did change a few things, i soaked the beans over night and drained them the next morning. I skipped the simmer for 2 hours part, and cooked them in a crock pot instead.  I didn't have the dry mustard so I substituted 1/2 teaspoon regular mustard. I cooked it for 12 hours on low, and it turned out wonderfully!

WOW! First time making beans from scratch, everyone raved about them, even my teenage son who normally doesn't like beans!  I used maple syrup instead of molasses.  Layered everything in crockpot on HIGH for 6 hrs, browned (in crockpot insert) uncovered in oven, stirring occasionally,  and returned insert to crockpot for a couple more hrs. (was cooking a ham in another slow cooker, so I added approx. 1/4 cup drippings)
AWESOME!!!!   will definitively make again and again...  thanks SOOOOOOOO MUCH!!

Delicious. I'll never go back to the canned version after having these! Every one at the party raved about how goo these were!

If I were to change one thing it would be to leave the bacon whole so that I can remove it before serving. This was MY preference only, as most others liked the bacon pieces left  in the beans. My reason behind this is because I just don't like soft bacon!

I don't like when people change recipes and then rate it -- so I apologize for doing that.  I bought a vintage West Bend electric bean pot at a thrift store.  My mission was to make baked beans that tasted like my mother's.  I left out the ketchup because she never used it in her baked beans.  I increased the molasses and brown sugar to 1/2 cup each.  Followed everything else exactly except for cooking them all day and was delighted with the results!  Just like my mother's!  She always used salt-pork, but the bacon was a great and easy alternative.  Will definitely make these again.

I have made this recipe two Christmases in a row with rave reviews and am making it again this Christmas. I serve it with Honeybaked ham, cauliflower gratin, my own version of corn succotash and pecan pie. Huge hit with the in-laws. This year, however, I am going to add a little chipotle in adobo since we are a spicy family.

Did this in the slow cooker on low for 13-14 hours, just skip the simmer for 2 hours part. I had to add about 6oz of water twice more but they turned out great. Big hit at the site Christmas pot luck.

I've made this recipe many times and it's excellent. I always double the ingredients and I use half of the salt. After three hours I remove and mash two cups of the beans and stir it back in gently. I also add one half a cup of 100 per cent  maple syrup. Very tasty. Thanks

We liked this, but I found the sauce to be more of a bbq sauce flavour than the baked bean flavour i was expecting. I decreased the salt by A LOT and used ham instead of bacon and also cooked it over a stovetop instead of the oven. Was fairly sweet and had a lot of flavour!

This was delicious! Will definitely make again! I added some cheese at the end, did not use 2 tsp salt and replaced the 1/4 cup sugar with unsweetened apple sauce. We didn't miss the sugar at all, still plenty sweet! Your family member handed you down a gem!!

I thought it was great. I doubled the servings and it turned out delicious. It's also a great base that you can tweak to your liking. Very pleased with this recipe.

Thank you for this wonderful recipe for Boston Baked Beans!  So far I have to say this is the best recipe I have found!  The ingredients were perfect for a nice light and not overly sweet beans!!  Myself and my husband really enjoyed them!

The next time I use this recipe, I am going to try using ham hocks just to see the difference in the flavor!  I had read one of the reviews and this person said she really liked the flavor!

I made this is the slow cooker. I soaked my beans and made them in the slow cooker on low over night. I then fried my bacon and the veggies and then added them and the other ingredients to the slow cooker and 3 hours later, the flavors had melded to create my son's new favorite!

This is easy and delicious! I omitted the mustard as I am not a fan.

I made this as written and I am giving this 4 stars as written because it's almost perfect.  I baked it and it got a little too dry so I pulled it out and added some water to it.  When I tasted it, it still lacked that zing that I wanted so I made another batch of the molasses sauce and added that to it before I put it in the fridge for the night (it was already midnight at that point).  This morning I tasted it, and it had that zing!  It was a TAD too sweet but other than that it was perfect!!!  Perfect consistancy, texture, taste, and smell.  Next time I make them I will double the sauce but cut the brown sugar back from 1/2 cup to 1/3 cup.

Totally awesome. Used a glob of prepared mustard and BBQ sauce for the powdered mustard and molasses, respectively. Canned beans can't come close.

This recipe was excellent!  I've always made baked beans that weren't the right consistency or they were too bland.  This recipe was awesome!  I used two cans of undrained beans - one of great northern and one of pinto because that's what i had.  I also didn't have dry mustard so I used a tablespoon or so of yellow mustard - I just threw the ingredients together in a le creuset and baked for 4 hours.  I only did the salt and pepper to taste... this recipe is definitely a keeper!!  Can't wait to make it again (it makes your house smell heavenly)!!

I have been making this recipe for a long time and it is always well-received. The first time I made the recipe as written. Over the years I have tweaked it to our tastes. I reduce the Molasses to 2 Tablespoons to make it less sweet. I eliminate the Worcestershire Sauce, since we did not care for the flavor it imparts. I bake the bacon in the oven before preparing the casserole. I prefer to make this in a crockpot for parties. Great recipe!!

This is my first time trying a baked beans recipe before. Never will I go back to eating beans from a can! This was very delicious, I loved the smell in the house because of them. I did find it a little salty so next time I am going to add just 1 teaspoon of salt. But this is definitely a keeper.

I doubled sauce.  Next time use less water or maybe add paste instead of some ketchup.  I thought it needed more time in crockpot, but guys couldn't wait.

I've been working hard at eliminating processed and canned products, so this fit the bill! I usually follow a recipe as posted the first time! I hate when the reviews are based on how someone has changed a recipe, and their thoughts on the changes. I followed this, with one exception, at 3 1/2 hours, the beans were a little firm, and I wanted more saucy goodness so I made another batch of the sauce and put them back in the oven! This is a keeper!

I love this recipe! I double it up. I've also made some tweeks. As the water boils down, I add chicken stalk. I add a little more dry mustard and molasses.  And I chop the bacon b4 I put it on the beans.

Love this recipe! Made many times. Will be making modifications this time as now i live in Asia some ingredients i can not find. Molasses will be replaced with dark corn syrup (cant find pure maple syrup either), and i will be using canned beans, and making in a slowcooker (which i usually do). Hopefully it will turn out as good as the original and the beans will not be mushy.

The best baked been I've made in a long time.  I followed the recipe as presented (halving the salt)  and using a slowcooker instead of the oven. I'll be making this one again.

Followed the recipe exactly for my first ever attempt making baked beans.  YUM.  Great.  The house smelled amazing (i.e. like my grandmother's house) for hours while it was cooking.  Will make it again!

Loved it!  Spices and seasoning perfect.  I cooked my beans in a pressure cooker and finished them with the sauce as described in a crock pot for the 3-4 hrs on high.  Family loved them!

The sauce in the recipe is absolutely delicious.  HOWEVER, I did make a couple of changes when I did the recipe. Firstly I tripled everything except the salt, left that for a single recipe, too much salt for me and only one and a half diced onions.  Finally, since I did not pre-cook the navy beans rather than adding just the water from soaked beans  I added water and 1/4 cup of Spiced Rum.  We put them into a crock pot for five hours, let cool completely then refrigerate overnight. The next morning I added 1/4 cup of molasses, another 1/4 cup of Spiced rum, and 1 1/2 cups of water and started them on low again. 
In the end I had to cook in the crock pot for about 18 hours.

After soaking you want to discard the water. The point of soaking is to get rid of some of the complex carbs (the part that makes you gassy) and puts them in the water. The recipe I make is very similar to this. I always add some barbecue sauce and whiskey.

This recipe was okay.   We really like baked beans in my home but this didn't go over very well.  First it was too sweet and second it was too tomatoey.  Those two flavors completely overpowered the bacon.  It's too bad because it smelled wonderful while cooking and it was easy.  I ended up using canned navy beans and cooked it in a cast iron pot for about 2-1/2 hours.  The beans were perfectly cooked.  I won't be making this again.

Very good recipe.  I did not have bacon, so used a ham bone.  This provided great flavor and I did not need to add additional salt.

I followed the recipe exactly as posted. Turned out very good with a nice deep sauce. I did not find this too sweet nor too salty, but very pleasing for my pallate. 

I could not find navy beans at my grocery store so i opted for "small white beans". I cooked this for 5 hours at 325 degrees and the beans were still firm. I had to use all of the remaining bean liquid, and checked every 2 hours for top-up.

This was a great recipe.  I used 1/2 cup less beans, but the same amount of sauce.  Fabulous.  Soaked them overnight and cooked them today.  The crock belonged to my grandmother.

Made this recipe on Saturday/Sunday. The only change I made was to saute the onions first, then added the spices and condiments to the onions. I also subbed Frank's Ketchup Style Red Hot Sauce for half of the regular ketchup. Other than that, followed recipe as written. Delicious! My husband and son love baked beans and these were a winner!

Easy enough to make and it tasted great, although I didn't add all the bacon only a quarter of it and it was delish. I will make again and just double everything.

By far my favorite bean recipe! I skipped the bacon and added some ground beef for extra protein. Plus I took it to work every day for lunch for the week! Great flavor, great recipe! :-)

I used canned beans sine I was short on time. I used one can each black, white and kidney. I also used a whole package of bacon (12pz.). Baked them for 2 hours and they were amazing!!! Great recipe!

This recipe takes time and planning but is well worth the effort.  I used 2 slices of bacon rather than 1/2 lb.  That was the only change I made.  Truly delicious!

I tried this recipe as written and the although I think I should have monitored and adjusted the simmering time (my beans were much too soft), the flavor was fantastic!

I doubled the recipe and it didn't have as much flavor as I thought it would. Next time I'll double the dry beans and triple sauce ingredients.

Simply Delicious!  I just made this recipe today and had to rate it!  I followed some other reviewers advice and used my slow cooker.  
(1) I let the bean soak all day yesterday periodically adding water as needed.  
(2) This morning I layered uncooked beans, instead of onions I used onion powder, then 5 slices of applewood smoked bacon.   
(3) I drizzled some of the sauce over this layer and repeated until I finished the beans and bacon.  
(4) Then I filled with fresh water and let them cook.   
(5) Set on High for 2 hours.  
(6) Drizzled about 3 Tbsp on Maple Syrup at this point
(7) Follow with setting on Low for 8-10 hours.  
They are soft and all the bacon has melted leaving little bits!

While these are a little time consuming to make they sure do taste better than the ones that come in a can.  When I'm in a pinch and I'm making these last minute I use canned beans and shorten the baking time.  Everyone loves these.

Delish!!!  Have been looking for a recipe like this...I cheated and used canned beans-black, kidney, navy...and added a bit of garlic.  I had some leftover corn and saute'd it with the garlic, onions, and bacon in bacon fat! I use a large dutch oven on the stove instead of the oven. Let's just say it was yummy...Thanks for a great recipe!!

Fantastic! I tripled the recipe to feed 6 adults and 4 kids - everyone had seconds or thirds, they were super delicious. The only thing I changed was I didn't bother to layer anything. I just mixed it all up and baked it that way, and it still turned out perfect. I wouldn't change a thing.

Canned Pork and Beans makes wonderful baked beans if you need a quick start and cuts the baking time to less than an hour. Using this recipe and add some finely chopped green bell peppers adds more color and a little more flavor.

So good! I made these in my bean pot and it was my first attempt at making a from scratch bean recipe in it. It turned out so good that I even got my kids to eat beans! I did use a 1/2 cup of molasses instead of 3 tbsp for a bit more sweetness but kept everything else the same. Perfect. Thank you! Gonna try it in the crock pot next.

These taste fantastic!  So, so easy and the aroma while baking is intoxicating.  We are very salt sensitive, so the only change I made to the recipe was to omit the salt. Yummy.

I originally had this a 4 star but went to a 3 star. It was too sweet for me. It was better the second day. Now I didnt follow the recipe completely. In order to speed it up I used pre cooked beans. I will look for another recipe for baked beans.

I made this exactly as directed and was very disappointed. It completely lacked flavor and I would have preferred plain old navy beans. I managed to salvage the recipe by making another batch of sauce, adding more water and baking for an additional 45 minutes. My vote- it's not worth the time it takes to make. I guess it's back to doctored up canned beans until I find a better recipe.

If I could give this more stars I would.  Simply delicious.  I made this Boston Brown Bread with raisins to go with it to make a simply bean dish into a protein worth of a top place in my rotation of meals.  Thank you for taking the time to post this.

I love baked beans, specifically vegetarian beans but since we tried to go organic eating healthier BUSH was not am option. This is an absolutely lovely recipe, I made some substitutions and actually doubled the sauce for the beans instead of adding more water (we like sweet baked beans!)
So the extra sauce was in addition to the water from the beans that was reserved from simmering.
 I didn't have dry mustard on hand so I used bone suckin' mustard no molasses so I used honey and I wanted veggie beans so I added bell pepper, I don't use Worcestershire sauce but regular soy stood in perfectly (I didn't sub anything else I promise lol) but they were delicious.Next go round I will not use the slowcooker  it took forever so unless you've got all day just use the oven. I did take one reviewers suggestions for thicker sauce and left the lid off at the end,I imagine you could do the same thing in the oven by pulling back the foil a bit our removing the lid. Wonderful recipe :-)

I've never made beans from scratch before; i even had trouble finding dry navy beans...but with that said I was pleasantly surprised how well they turned out. I didn't change a thing other than to half the recipe since it was only my husband and I eating them.  I served them with ribs and coleslaw.  Now I can't wait until summer to bring these to our next family BBQ and shock them!

I never made beans before but a couple of months ago I decided I'd try.  I used this recipe and WOW.  My 83 year old father loves them and always says these are the best beans he's ever had.  My daughter in law takes a bite and closes her eyes and moans and says the same as my father lol.  I've made these 4 times.  This recipe is easy to follow.  The package of beans I use have almost 3 cups of beans so I add a little more ketchup and brown sugar, probably 1/8th of a cup. Two T of Worcestershire 1 teaspoon of mustard 5 T molasses.  And always soak the navy beans overnight or 8 hours.  Simmer on the stove top for 2 hours 3 hours in the oven, shut the oven off let them set for 30 to 40 mins just to soak up the liquid.  PERFECT  I make biscuits (the recipe on the back of bakewell creme) is the best.

Eeek!  Way to greasy.  Put less than the recommended amount of bacon and I still spent an hour skimming the grease out of it.  Tasted ok.

The first time I tried this recipe was for Thanksgiving. It was a hit! Two weeks later and this is now the fourth time I made this recipe. I am addicted to this. I substituted regular mustard for dry mustard, I didn't use any molasses. My wife does not eat pork so I make it either with meat, turkey sausage or no meat at all and it still tastes wonderful.

This is a superb recipe!  I made them in a crock pot with only half the brown sugar and took the cover off for the last couple of hours to reduce the liquid.  Yummy!  I'll make them again and again!

I love homemade baked beans!  This is my go to recipe.  I don't put in the bacon due to diet restrictions and add a pinch of cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg.  Turns out great every time!

Delicious...like my Mom's!!  I used a large, thick ham slice, cut into bite-sized pieces. Next time will use a little less worcestershire, about 1/2 T.--it's a great addition but don't want to overwhelm flavor of other ingredients. Could use a little more brown sugar. Thank you for this great recipe!

I tried this recipe when asked to cookout for 40 men working in the oilfield. It was very easy to follow and a huge success. Such a sucess that I have been asked to do it again. The only change I made was to add a dash of liquid smoke to give it a more bbq flavor.

These beans were really good!  I did leave out the brown sugar based on other reviews but in the end I added some in because it was not quite sweet enough w/just the molasses.   Will make these again and leave myself enough time for soaking and cooking next time.

I ran out of time and did not have time to soak my beans.  Instead I bought canned white, kidney and black.  Used some of the juice the beans were already in, and followed the rest of the recipe but used the crock pot.  They cooked over night.  And my beans are not dry.  Love love it.  Thank you.

My first attempt at homemade beans and sooo good! I agree that you have a chance of over cooking the beans so check them closely at 2 hours. Added a diced red bell pepper and  minced chili pepper.

This is a delicious recipe! I wanted to make bake beams from scratch...none of this 'open a can of this' and add a 'can of that' business. This will be my go to recipe for beans from now on. I made it nearly exactly as written but made a larger batch. It is also 90+ degrees today, so I used my slow cooker as opposed to the oven. I also don't soak my beans overnight, but rather, cook them on low for several hours, then drain and rinse them, add them back to the slow cooker and add the remaining ingredients. Voila! Delicious and easy!

Super easy to make baked beans and they taste great too! My family loves these baked beans. The only change that I made was leaving out the onions and adding some onion powder. I was kind of worried when I took the lid off at 2hrs because of the amount of liquid but after another 2hrs of cooking they thickened up nicely.

These are wonderful!!!!!! After reading some of the reviews... I soaked the beans for 8 hours, simmered in soaking water for 1 hour, slow cooked for 10 hours and then cooked uncovered in slow cooker uncovered for 1 hour.  I doubled sauce and added reserved bean water to cover beans in slow cooker.  I also added a bit of maple syrup to the sauce.  These are perfect and delicious!

pretty good. my bf likes bbq beans so i added some into the sauce and i made an extra half batch of sauce midway thru the oven baking and i used bbq sauce instead of ketchup. I didn't use the worchestershire since i personally can't stand the stuff.  For me when boiling the beans they were in about 45 mins. The beans were really lite and soupy at the 3hr point so i uncovered it and baked it for about 30 more minutes to thicken. Which probably didn't needed to be done because the beans soaked up whatever remaining liquid and the beans darkened up beautifully. Still pretty tasty I do think next time i'll cut the salt if doubling the sauce. It was a bit salty for my but my bf thought it was fine.

I made these for our Christmas Eve dinner. They were completely gone!  I really liked them myself. I would, however, decrease the sweetness by either decreasing the amount of molasses or brown sugar.  It may taste better if I would just add more mustard and leave the molasses and sugar the same.  I'll have to play with it.  I took a few shortcuts - I used canned beans to cut out a few hours of work. I drained and rinsed the beans. I sauteed the onion and bacon and threw ALL ingredients into a crock-pot on low for a few hours.  it really doesn't take long to cook these in the crock-pot since the ingredients are all cooked - just the flavors will have to marry.

Delicious!  I used white beans and soaked them overnight with water and a bit of baking soda.  In the morning I rinsed the beans and boiled them for an hour.  I also cooked the bacon a bit to remove some fat.  After that everything went into the crockpot for the day and it turned out fabulous!

This is my "go to" baked beans recipe.  I adjust the sauce to a little sweeter, according to my family's tastes.  A wonderful from scratch recipe.

My first time making baked beans. Loved it! I used red kidney beans because that's all I had and used maple syrup instead of molasses and only 1 tablespoon of brown sugar but it tasted great ")

Excellent.  Followed as written with two exceptions: used turkey bacon slices instead of regular bacon, and did the fifth step in my crockpot for 7-8 hours (a hot cooking one).  Worked like a charm ... delicious beans.

I soak the beans over night, bring them to a boil 3x with a 1/4 tsp of baking soda in the water, poured off each boiling. The last boil is when I follow with this recipe. We had it in the slow cooker on low for 24 hrs lol. The flavor is the best baked bean recipe I have ever tried. It is dark and thick and delicious.

These beans are amazing.  The suggestion of doubling the sauce is a good one and I will do it the next time I make them.  Instead of bacon I used a low fat sausage.  This is an easy bean recipe to make.

Excellent flavor. I skipped the simmering step and just cooked them on the stove. Nice and easy. I also halved the bacon and it made difference.

After reading some reviews, I was concerned that this recipe may be too sweet, so I reduced the brown sugar to 3 tbsps and it came out perfect.  My husband hates beans and molasses but has asked for this dish again already.  I served it on Good Friday with Newfoundland Cod Cakes - a perfect match.  Next, I'll serve it with italian sausage.  A definite keeper

These beans were soo yummy!  I made them exactly as written, no substitutions or changes. I love the canned maple beans so I might try substituting some maple syrup for some of the brown sugar another time.

It is fantastic to have a recipe that consists entirely of things I already have in my kitchen.  I dislike canned foods generally, and buying canned baked beans and adding things to them is hardly cooking in my mind.  The two places I deviated were to use half a leftover ham bone in place of bacon, and I baked them for 6 hours instead of 4.  After 4 hours, the beans weren't quite to the texture I wanted.  After 6...awesome.

Very good.  Almost the way I usually make them.  I used my 150 year old crock with lid to bake for 6 hours.  Also no ketsup.  I added a bit of brown sugar. One half an apple diced up small a bit of dry mustard and a teaspoon of vinegar. Yummy...They were all gone by the end of  dinner.  Thank you very much.

These were very tastey, but they took a lot of time to cook in the slow cooker. I liked them a lot, but I'll probably just stick to canned since they were very similiar, just required a WHOLE lot more effort.

From reading Ralph Moody's books, we wanted to make the New England beans his mother made.  This recipe fits the bill and is delicious!  I don't think our family will ever be able to go back to the canned baked beans.  These are so much better!

Incredible!  I think I'll leave out the bacon next time because the beans are excellent, and don't need the extra fat tainting them! Excellent w/ cornbread, as suggested.

Delicious! I was out of ketchup and used barbecue sauce instead. I eliminated the brown sugar because the barbecue sauce is sweeter than ketchup. And I skipped the bacon and added just a teaspoon of liquid smoke. DELICIOUS! I served it with drop biscuits and barbecued chicken, and my 3-year-old asked for more.

Great recipe, my first time making baked beans from scratch and came out great. The night before I soaked pinto beans in ice cold water.  I first fried up the bacon in a deep pan.  I removed the bacon and put aside for later. I used that same pan with the fat and bacon bits to cook the beans for almost 1.5 hrs.  This simmered the water down to very little so I didn't remove the water since I figured there was a lot of flavor in the water.    After that I just added the bbq sauce ingredients minus the brown sugar (all still in the same pot).  I also added about 1/4 teaspoon of emeril's essense and 1/4 teaspoon of dried chiptole powder too.   After the sauce was done, I added the bacon all crumbled up and some left over ground taco meat I had in the fridge from the previous night. Baked it all in the oven for about 3 hours.  Came out great!

Very nice! I used pinto beans instead of navy, added a *grunch* of garlic and a little bit of sriracha, left out the molasses because I didn't have any and used about twice as much mustard powder. Since I'm the only bean lover in the house (oh no, I have to eat an entire batch of beans!), I also tried a bowl diluted with water and a tiny pinch of chicken bouillon granules, and it made for quite a tasty soup.

I have been looking for a recipe for beans for a long time,and these are really tastey beans.The bacon I used was called campfire bacon.It has a really good smoke flavor and sure added to the taste of the beans.I also doubbled up on the sauce and the beans just sucked it right up.Thak You for the great recipe.

Very good recipe.  I have made them several times, I add the whole lb of bacon and a whole sweet onion but keep the rest of the ingridents the same.  Everyone smells them baking in the oven and can't wait to eat them

This turned out great! I soaked the beans in luke warm water from 10pm-7am. I drained them and they sat around for a few hours. Then I boiled them for about 40 minutes. They looked like they were all turning to mush. I was very worried I would have mush as a final product. They sat again for a few hours and then I baked them for 2 hours. They ended turning out great-not totally mushy and some of the beans still had a bit of a bite to them. My husband loved them!!!!!!!!!! I scaled the recipe to 4 servings. I doubled the liquid ingredients-but only did 3 tbsp of the molasses instead of the 4 that would have doubled it. I will definatly make this again. It is quite durable.

I give it 4.5 stars.  I cooked the bacon before I added it to remove some of the fat.  I also put the beans in a crock pot after simmering the beans on the stove. It cooked between 4-5 hours on high. I needed to simmer the beans for more than 2 hrs - this might be because of the higher altitude I was cooking at. Overall, this recipe was a hit and I will make it again!

This was my first time making beans from scratch.  I think they turned out great.  I made them for a BBQ and came home with not much left.  I made a double batch.

These were good but too salty for our taste. My guests ate them but no one really commented so I'm not sure if they liked them or not. Also, I wouldn't say they were a lot of work but making them was certainly very time consuming. I was disappointed because I expected them to taste so much better than canned but they didn't. Not really worth the effort then, in my opinion.

Fantastic, I used Maple Syrup instead of the brown sugar and a bit more dry mustard, much thicker and best served the next day with a thick slick of homesteader bread from this site! Thanks, nice to find a recipe using dried beans....acadian

This was really good, considering I am not a big fan of beans. I did, however, use canned beans because I didn't have time to soak.  It was simple and yummy.  Everyone loved them.

The flavor was excellent - smokey and full. The beans became mushy - I will decrease the boiling time.Kids loved the beans and we coupled them with some shredded cheese.

These were good.  I used great northern beans because that's what I had.  I tried to put them in the crock pot but didn't cook them long enough so they were a little tough.  I will bake as instructed next time.  I had never had beans with molasses before and I think I may prefer them without it.  I will try again with and without.  They did smell wonderful while they were cooking.  It's nice to have homemade instead of from a can.  Thanks

Thanks! I have been searching and searching for a "real" baked beans recipe. All the recipes I found used canned beans. My husband loves baked beans so I want to surprise him with this recipe!

Not for the impatient, I pulled these beans out of the oven 24 hours after I put them to soak. They were very good though!!! Yum! I left out the bacon to save money (that's the same reason I am making my own beans). So, for those of you with the time, this recipe is a must! The only suggestion I would make is to add even more brown sugar, they weren't sweet enough for me.

This took a lot of time (not a lot of effort), but it was really worth the flavor. I doubled the sauce for more flavor and added an extra 1/4 cup of brown sugar. Next time I will cut the salt in half in the barbecue sauce - it was pretty salty. Otherwise, it was very tasty!

Delicious! Used BBQ sauce instead of ketchup.  Easy too.
