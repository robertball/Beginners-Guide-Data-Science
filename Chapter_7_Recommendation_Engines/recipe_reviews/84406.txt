My wife loves when I cook this for her. I made a few changes to make it a little more interesting though. First, I use The Best Thai Peanut Sauce recipe I found on allrecipes. Instead of frozen stir-fry veggies I use fresh red bell pepper, a yellow pepper, fresh snow peas and a can of sliced water chestnuts. I also use a light flour instead of the cornstarch. Before serving I also add a little extra sauce as my wife likes it that way. 

Personally, I really enjoy making this dish!

We loved this and declared it "restaurant good." We used fresh veggies (snow peas, mushrooms, onion, red pepper, green onions). I did not batter the tofu, just soaked it in soy sauce and sauteed it. I made my own peanut sauce from this recipe: 3/4 cup light coconut milk, 1 tsp. red curry, 1/4 cup smooth peanut butter, 2 Tbs. brown or raw sugar, 1 Tbs. lemon juice, 1/4 tsp. salt. It was a little sweet, so I recommend less sugar and adding some pepper flakes or paprika. Making your own peanut sauce ensures the sauce is vegetarian, which many store-bought ones are not.

Excellent tofu!! (To make sure the tofu didn't fall apart in the wok, I placed the tofu block under a cookie sheet with a coffee can on top to weight it down. I let it sit for probably 45 minutes. That squeezed out all the excess water.) The veggies were a little on the plain side because they're stir-fried with no sauce, so I added some soy sauce to taste at serving time. I will definitely keep this recipe for the future!

I really enjoyed this dish.

A few tips: 

(1) Use FIRM to EXTRA FIRM TOFU (a response to those complaining about it "falling apart"); I used MEDIUM: that's all I had.  

(2) I took some frozen green beans, thawed them, cut onions, added celery, salt and FRESH ginger.  Great vegetable dish. 

(3) My minor complaint: too much oil, so I will probably use 1/4 C oil next time. 

(4) If you have a Trader Joe's in your area, i would strongly suggest using their Peanut Sauce.  Fabulous!  I only have about 1 TBSP left over, but it was great.  I now know to not use too much sauce next I make this dish.

Good luck and thanks for reading.

This is a great recipe!  I used fresh veggies: Broccoli, red pepper, green pepper, red onion, bamboo shoots, celery, carrot and bean sprouts.  Buy extra firm tofu and cut it into 1/4 to 1/2 inch squares.  If you drain the tofu it shouldn't crumble.  By cutting it smaller, you get more peanut taste instead of tofu.  I also poured the rest of the peanut sauce, from the jar, over the dish when I was done.  I might suggest pouring some peanut sauce over the veggies too and heating through if you really like peanut sauce like we do.   This makes a great left over for lunch.  I added soy sauce to the rice I served it on and it was great.

I do not hesitate in giving this recipe five stars.  My son loves cooked carrots, tofu & peanut butter--so to throw all those flavors together into one recipe turned out to be a real HIT with my preschooler.  That means we were able to get peas, broccoli & water chestnuts into him unawares with the fabulous coating of peanut sauce.  My husband upped the hot sauce on his serving tableside, my son did not consider his own as-is serving too spicy, & this is a wheat-free recipe (for me), so it won all all fronts!  We loved the textures with the fried tofu over rice vermicelli and the crunch of crushed peanuts.  NOTE--there is a lot of peanut in here, so if you have even the slightest sensitivity, beware.  2nd note--the time to make this is underestimated.  It took lots of prep time--namely making the peanut sauce (I used a recipe from a Stir Fry book, which tasted delicious, but required some food processing).  A new favorite!

Before this recipe, I hadn't discovered a way to make tofu's texture and taste appealing--and this created an incredible stir fry that even kept well over a few days in the fridge. Very good!!

I was very pleased with the way this dish turned out. I didn't follow the recipe exactly as stated, because I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand. I also added some additional ingredients to suit my taste. Instead of stir-fry veggies, I used a mixture of frozen sliced carrots with broccili and cauliflower, which I added to one chopped sauteed onion and three 3 cloves of minced garlic. Powdered ginger was used, but next time I will be sure to use fresh. I skipped the eggs and tossed the tofu in arrowroot, instead of cornstarch, before cooking it in the hot oil. I used a very good prepared Thai peanut sauce and added whole almonds, as suggested by another reviewer. To enhance the flavor more, I added five spice powder, garlic powder and soy sauce. We all loved this dish and found it was best served over rice. The almonds complimented the flavors well and added a nice crunch. This is definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

For the new year we plan on eating meat only 2 days a week, so we tried this as it is a vegetarian dish. My husband LOVED it, I thought the veggies were a bit dry. I tried adding more peanut sauce to fix the problem, but it made it too spicy.

As a vegetarian (10 months and going strong!), I was anxious to eat something rich and hearty today. I absolutely love Thai coconut curries and soups, so this recipe was very appealing to me. My local grocery store didn't have any peanut sauce by the jar. Instead, I found Taste of ThaiÂ® brand Peanut Sauce Mix- which was a package of 2 envelopes of powder. The directions say to mix both envelopes of mix with 1 can of coconut milk to yield 2 cups of sauce, so I used 1 packet with about 3/4 can of coconut milk to make more sauce. I fried the tofu over HIGH heat because it was taking more than 5 minutes to turn golden brown over medium heat. Another thing: I looked at how much oil was left in the pan and decided to drain off ALL OF IT! After I got rid of the oil, I drained the fried tofu onto some paper towels and proceeded to make the sauce in the same wok until it thickened. I then added the fried tofu along with the veggies. I used frozen stir fry veggies, and I didn't care for the wet, soggy texture. I would definitely use fresh veggies next time for a more desireable al dente texture. All in all, great flavor, but I have to admit I regretted not being generous with the ginger. I would use 1 HEAPING tbs. of minced ginger next time. This stir-fry was served with brown rice. Could do without rice or noodles... easily. All that tofu really fills you up. THIS IS A DELICIOUS STICK-TO-YOUR-RIBS type of dish.

This makes for a pretty darn good meal. I liked it. Another option if you want to cut the fat content down some, is to substitute the dry fry method when prepping the tofu (google it if you don't know how). That will eliminate the need for deep frying methods. This will cut down the oil requirements, eliminate the eggs and cornstarch, and will help dry out the tofu enough where it won't fall apart. This will also result in the sauce being absorbed a little better. Either way though, this is a pretty good recipe.

Loved it! Got my boyfriend to eat tofu.  Made extra sauce and served it over rice noodles. YUM 

I used powdered ginger instead of fresh, and fresh veggies instead of frozen.

Very tasty, if you add sauce to the vegs., such as soy sauce, or a liquidy peanut sauce, or some other stir fry sauce. I used fresh vegs. (snow peas, bell pepper, onion), which cooked during the stir-frying, and a homemade peanut sauce. The vegs. were perfectly crisp-tender! I did try it exactly as written; pleasant, but the vegs. needed something. The tofu cubes were very good - loved the peanuts & ginger! I started with less oil in pan because 1/2 cup oil is so much (for me); had to add close to that amount though, because the tofu absorbed almost all of that oil. I will make this again, but with some sauce to flavor the vegs.

This is the best way to cook tofu.  It's nice and crispy.  I used fresh vegetables: pea pods and mushrooms.  It was even better the second day.

This tofu stir-fry is delicious.  My husband, a meat and potatoes man, even enjoyed it.  My kids are not big meat eaters so this meal was perfect for them.  The tofu is unoffensive to their taste buds.  I used 5 different types of fresh vegetables.  Yum!

yum! I used a bag of frozen peppers to save time, and added a can each of bean sprouts and bamboo shoots. I tossed the veggies back in the pan when the tofu was done to distribute the peanut sauce more evenly. Served over rice noodles...it was great! I'd definitely make this again.

I softened 3 cloves of garlic, a quarter of a large white onion, and a 1/2 teaspoon of minced ginger in oil in a wok. Then I added broccoli, red and green pepper, mushrooms, and some sliced water chestnuts, and cooked them in some jarred peanut sauce.  In a separate pan, I fried the breaded tofu cubes until they were crispy and turning brown, then lifted them out of the oil with a slotted spoon and added them to the veggies in the wok. I drizzled on more peanut sauce and added some Sriracha chili sauce, and stirred everything up. We ate it with brown rice. I had never had tofu cooked this way and I really enjoyed it. I wish that it had stayed crispy after I added it to the veggies and sauce, but it kept a nice flavor.

Not bad Not bad at all. I used a schezwan sauce and chopped walnuts in substitution of the peanut sauce/peanut combination. I used a tablespoon of olive oil for frying the veggies & a tablespoon of olive oil for frying the tofu. I also didn't have fresh ginger; so I used 1/2 a teaspoon of ground and it still gave it a nice flavor. There are endless possibilities with this recipe as a base. I also really liked how the cornbread turned out as a batter on the tofu. It came out nice and golden brown.

This is hands-down the tastiest tofu recipe I've ever made - my husband and I love it!  It's messy to coat the tofu with the cornstarch mixture, but so worth the clean-up.  Delicious!

A resounding success as our first attempt at a dish with  tofu.  My husband raved about it, and he was very skeptical beforehand.  :)

Really delicious. I was skeptical while cooking the tofu, but after I added the peanut sauce it was very good. I sauteed fresh vegetables instead of frozen. It turned out pretty spicy but I'm not sure if that's because the store-bought peanut sauce I used was spicy or because I added a lot of ginger. Good thing we love spicy. Thanks for a great recipe!

I took Darter02's advice and used Best Thai Peanut Sauce (which was AWESOME!), used fresh veggies (green and red bell peppers, snow peas), and just fried the tofu in peanut oil rather than egg batter it. It was pretty darn good!

Delicious- it's a great way to cook tofu to crisp it up a little bit. I used a bottled peanut sauce that was spicier than I expected, so my 4 year old didn't love it, but my husband and I did :)

I just made this, and had to rate it. All I can say is "yum!". I added fresh broccoli to the veg mix, and made sure to press the tofu to get out the excess water before hand. To make the peanut sauce I used the "best thai peanut sauce" recipe (found on allrecipes). I used olive oil to fry the tofu, and it tasted great. I made sure to drain the excess oil before adding just enough sauce to coat the tofu, and then I put the veg back in and tossed it all together over low heat. I served it over rice, and it was just delicious. The best part is I have left overs for the week :-).

My eight-year old daughter is finding that she's not a big fan of meat, and wanted to try cooking tofu for dinner.  I, on the other hand, am a big fan of meat and generally turn my nose up at tofu.  I decided to humour her, searching for highly rated tofu dishes on Allrecipes.  She honed in on this recipe. It was simply amazing.  My whole family loved the dish, even dad the carnivore (me).

We prepared this with fresh vegetables: red pepper, snow peas, bok choy, green onion, and water chestnuts. 
My only change on this one would be to either reduce the oil for frying the tofu or to drain it after  frying.  The remaining oil didn't combine well with the peanut sauce, and left a bit of a soupy separated pool of oil in the bottom of the dish.

Thanks for posting, and for changing my opinions on tofu!

I am only giving this four stars because I made several modifications to the recipe. It turned out great! Like some of the other reviews, I simply marinated the tofu in a little soy sauce a touch of peanut sauce instead of the egg and cornstarch. I also added a bit of thinly cut sliced beef and extra small shrimp in while I was sauteeing the tofu. Lastly, I added some canned pineapple chunks as a bit of a sweet garnish

This was soooo delicious! I kept eating the vegetables even though I was full because this tasted so good. Used Thai Peanut Sauce recipe from the website as someone suggested. Next time, I may try panko bread crumbs instead of cornstarch.

Excellent recipe! I used the 'best peanut sauce recipe' on this site, and made a few modifications: flour instead of corn starch when frying the tofu, and for the veggies, I started sauteeing a tablespoon each of chopped ginger and garlic, then added a tablespoon of soy sauce and a tablespoon of the peanut sauce. Gave a great flavor to the veggies that worked nicely with the tofu. Thanks!

I looooove this recipe. I started looking for tofu recipes when my father-in-law who is a vegan, came to visit. It was made specifically for him, but after tasting this, the entire family wanted it.This was my third attempt at a tofu recipe and this is just absolutely delicious. My hardcore husband who does nothing but beef, gave this a 5 star rating so that should tell you.

Great recipe and very filling. I had to use more cornstarch then stated in the recipe. I also used 1/2 of the required oil (heart healthy) to fry up the tofu. To make it a full meal, just add a little bit of rice.

Wonderful flavors. I took a combination of suggestions: Fresh veggies, stir fried with chinese 5 spice in very little canola oil. Added tofu (not fried) that had been flavored with 5 spice and a touch of Kecap (a sweet soy sauce). Served this mix over a bed of asian noodles with the "The best Thai Curry Peanut sauce" (from this website) as suggested. You will make this again and the fat content has been cut back drastically so enjoy!

Tofu dishes are often bland, but this one is nice. I skipped the eggs and just coated the tofu with cornstarch. It browned pretty quickly.  I prefer to use just fresh vegetables and I also added a little hot pepper and garlic to give it more flavor.  A bit of a clean-up involved (no matter what I do, the cornstarch winds up everywhere) but otherwise not too much work.  Love the peanuts in there...

Very good, and very flexible!  I used chicken instead of tofu, and I didn't batter them.  Used fresh vegetables instead of frozen, and marinated both chicken and vegetables separately in some of the peanut sauce before cooking to infuse the flavor a bit.  Served over rice noodles, though I think in hindsight I would have liked it better with rice.

I really enjoyed making and eating this dish.  I think that the tofu was perfect.  I did only use 1/4 cup of oil instead, still came out great.  I would highly reccomened this to anyone, even those who don't care for tofu.

I love this recipe but found it took a little longer to make than the recipe states. Next time i would just cut the tofu into fingers, coat and cook them, then cut into cubes.  I used the recipe for Best Peanut Sauce which i found on allrecipes and it made the perfect mix of flavours. will definatly make this one again.

This was the first tofu recipe ever that I actually like. The only thing I did different is that I put the corn starch mixture in a ziploc bag and did the tofu shake n bake style, which made it quicker and clearer.

This was delicious! I made a few changes.  I substituted sesame oil for vegetable oil for cooking veggies (kept vegetable oil for the tofu, since that would get expensive). For the veggies, I started out with sauteing chopped garlic, ginger, and onion. I used fresh vegetables instead of frozen (have tried a number of different combinations, including mushrooms, broccoli, cauliflower, bell pepper, zucchini, squash, green beans, etc). I added some sriracha sauce to the egg mixture for spice. I also used much less peanut sauce (more like 3 tablespoons than 3/4 cup).
With these modifications, it takes me longer than 30 minutes, more like an hour start to finish.

Absolutely love this recipe. I usually make it with broccoli, red peppers, onions, and sugar snap peas. Sometime double bread the tofu (flour, egg, flour) and use a mixture of flour, cornstarch, and cornmeal (or just flour/cornstarch or flour/cornmeal). When I don't have access to store bought peanut sauce I've made "Thai-style peanut sauce with honey" from this website. It's very good with this recipe. Thank you for this gem of a meal! It's one of our favorites in my house.

I followed the recipe exactly. The tofu never browned and the cornstarch gave it a really weird texture and flavor. I did not get the crispy texture I had hoped for when I read the instructions to coat in egg and cornstarch. Also, I don't know if it was the water from the tofu or what, but I ended up with a soupy mess when frying the tofu. Plenty of people seemed to be successful with this recipe; unfortunately, it just really didn't work for me.

Breading the tofu cubes was a mess (used firm tofu and it fell apart while dredging).  There was even more of a mess in the skillet when the tofu was fried - crumbling tofu, globs of batter which fell off of the tofu. Also, too much peanut sauce.  AND  I doubled this recipe using 2 lbs of tofu and nearly 40 oz of veg. but still just got 4 respectable servings!

Easy to make but I have had much better tofu peanut stir-fries. This one fell flat. I will keep looking.

This recipe was a disaster for me.  I usually stir fry tofu without breading it and it's great but I decided to go along and bread it.  I may have cut the tofu pieces too small but the cornstarch and egg became all gooey and tasted weird.  Next time I definitely won't try and bread it and just stir fry the tofu like normal.

I made this recipe according to the recipe. It was tasty but the texture was awful. When I mixed in the peanut sauce it became very clumpy. Also, that much cornstarch and oil cannot be healthy.

Loved this method for cooking the tofu.  But one egg is plenty for a 14 oz package of tofu.  And 1/4 cup of oil is enough for frying it.  Like others, I used fresh veggies and I used pre-made peanut sauce from House of Tsang (found at the grocery in the Asian section.)  We could easily have this once a week!

I enjoyed this dish.  Instead of frozen veggies I used steamed fresh vegetables and a homemade hot peanut sauce also from this site.  A healthier way is to use canola oil and served with brown rice.  Will make again.

This is my favorite tofu recipe by far. I used half the amount of cornstarch and omitted the frozen vegetables, using sliced red pepper, broccoli and bias cut carrots instead. I also cooked the veggies in a little soy and hoison sauce. Unfortunately the peanut sauce I used was too spice for my kids but I LOVED it!

The sauce was decent, but the batter was awful. It wouldn't stick to the tofu and simply created a nasty paste enveloping non-crispy tofu chunks. Wouldn't make it again.

Good recipe.  I fixed this for my boyfriend and I. Garnished it with green onion and fresh cilantro and served with rice noodles. Delicious. Also added crushed red pepper flakes to the peanut sauce and tofu, since we like ours a bit on the spicy side. Thought the tofu could have used more sauce for our liking, as we had to add more to our plates. And as another reviewer mentioned, there was too much oil when frying the tofu; I had to strain off the excess. I would use 1/4 c. oil instead of 1/2 c. But overall a good recipe. I imagine I will make this again.

Really good flavor. I found the coating of the tofu to be unnecessary. Next time I will cook the tofu, uncoated, using about 1/4 of the oil.

Using flower instead of cornstarch helped a lot! And only 1/2 the amount of oil was needed.

It came out a bit bland the first time but I made it with more seasoning the next time and it came out absolutely delicious!
The only person in my home who didn't like it is my sis & that's only because she believes peanut butter should only go on bread with jam *rolls eyes* go figure :P

This is a really versatile recipe.  The tofu tastes great, but you can also substitute shrimp or chicken too.  But fresh vegetables always taste better than frozen.

I needed something to finish up my home-made peanut sauce in the fridge, and this fit nicely.  A couple of suggestions though: I cut my tofu too big, and I think that it should be cut into smaller cubes, as it absorbs more flavour.  I stir-fried the veggies with sesame oil and soya sauce, and than added them back to the tofu mixture for more flavour.  Personally, I thought it needed a bit more spice.  I will make this again, but next time  I'll probablly add five spice powder as another reviewer suggested.

This was a great recipe -- I followed it exactly, but found that it took closer to 15 minutes, rather than 5, to brown the tofu. The tofu coating was nice and crispy. I also used a bit of soy sauce when stir-frying the veggies, which was a nice addition, and served everything over jasmine rice. When I make this again (and I will!), I plan to use extra firm tofu; firm tofu held up just fine, but I prefer the texture of extra-firm in stir fry. Also, I will try making my own peanut sauce, since the bottled stuff is never as good. Wonderful quick, easy, cheap recipe!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It taught me how to cook tofu in the way that Chinese Restaurants do.  However, it did not follow the recipe to a "T."  I did not want so much salt in my meal.  the way I cut out the salt was that I didn't add any.  I decided that the high sodium "stir fry marinade" was enough.  I also used fresh vegetables that I only cooked for a few minutes.  Also I find that stir frys cook quicker in Peanut oil.  If you let the oil heat up first, Peanut Oil can get much hotter than most other oils without it starting to burn.  This enables you to fry the tofu quicker with the ingredients burning.  I tried to cut down the oil as much as possible, so I fried the veggies in just a tablespoon of peanut oil, while I used the majority of the oil (1/2 cup I believe) for frying.  Another way that I trimmed down on the oil was that I didn't use the oil I fried the tofu in to finish making the dish.  Rather, I transferred the tofu to another wok (you could use another frying pan) that had a little bit (1 tbsp or 2 - use your best judgment) and simply added the stir fry marinade and tofu together in that pot.  I didn't give the full five stars because I disliked the prepackaged nature of the recipe.  I did give it four because it taught me how to make something I've never made before.  Thanks!

Taste good.  I think the taste really depends on the peanut sauce you use so use a good one.   Tofu takes a lot longer than 5 minutes to brown.   I used fresh green beans, brocolli, carrots and green onion.  The tofu is also good just fried without the egg.

Wow! I was a bit skeptical about the combination, but this dish was SO good.  My husband and I both really loved it.  I omitted the eggs, just fried the tofu in a thin layer of olive oil until crispy, then added the peanut sauce.  For veggies I used carrots, onions, water chestnuts, baby corn & snap peas over brown rice.  I would recommend this recipe to anyone, vegetarian or not!!!  I plan to serve this next time I have company over.

This is excellent..The only way to eat tofu.  Even my children who do notlike tofu loved this.  I added 2 cloves garlic, 1 Tablespoon of fresh ginger and also cut up my own stir fry vegetables.  Great and thanks for a wonderful way to eat tofu.

This is absolutely delicious!  It's become our favorite way to eat tofu!  Turns out fine if you don't have ginger on hand, but it's better with it.  I would recommend this to anyone who would like to try tofu.

I love peanut sauce and asian food...but this is a good example of why I go out to get it! What a nightmare! The tofu was sticking and kept falling apart, keeping it from getting crisp on the outside. The flavor rocked...but my inability to cook the tofu ruined it all!

This is a really tasty dish, my husband (who never gets excited over tofu) even liked it.  I forgot the ginger and didn't miss it.  My vegetable blend had sugarsnap peas, carrots, mushrooms and onions and it fit into the recipe nicely.  I served with brown basmati rice.  I will keep this one in the rotation!

I should say I made something inspired by this. What I did do is fry the tofu as directed.  It was my first time cooking tofu and my husband is not normally a fan but he liked this treatment. I made my own peanut sauce (coconut milk, peanut butter, Thai red curry and garlic chili paste.). Used fresh veggies and served it over rice noodles.  Very tasty. Nice texture.

I love this recipe for the how-to on frying tofu. I first cut my tofu block into 4 pieces and drained them for about 30 mins. I omitted the egg and lightly dusted each cube with cornstarch. 1/2 c of oil was too much for me so instead I did a healthy pour. I fried for longer than 5 mins, until each side was golden brown, and sprinkled with salt. This recipe is great since you can use any assortment of veggies, I kept it simple with sautÃ©ed garlic and onion (cut into chunks). I threw in a large handful of cilantro which was excellent with the tofu and peanut flavors.

This was good, I used the peanut sauce recipe from the spicy baked tofu.  The sauce is a little thick but tastes great so I added some water.

This is good, but I changed the recipe because I don't like frozen vegetables.  I used fresh carrots, celery, squash, bean sprouts, mushrooms, and of course garlic and ginger.  I also made my own peanut sauce, so maybe I should not really be reviewing this recipe.  But the tofu was excellent!

The tofu did not fry well for me. I followed the instructions exactly and I even drained and patted it dry before breading it. I won't be making this recipe again.

Tastes very good although sweet. Didn't make much sauce, was sticky. Very very very filling! You do not need a big portion.

YUM!  This hit the spot!  I didn't have any cornstarch so I used flour as someone suggested.  I will use cornstarch next time for the extra crisp.  I didn't have any peanut sauce so I used some stir fry sauce and sesame oil.  Will make this again in the future and follow the recipe next time.

I love this recipe! I used fresh vegtable and added soy sauce to it while it cooked. The best peanut sauce is made by Trader Joes. I tried another kind and it was kind of sweet.  Trader Joes is not. Oh, I also added some slice mushrooms to the stir-fry as well. I have made it twice and I keep a jar of peanut sauce in the cabinet now.

This was my first time making a tofu dish for my two daughters and husband.  It turned out great.  I dipped the tofu in water instead of egg to make the dish vegan, and I fried them up in 1/4 cup oil and dumped out the remaining.  Next time I might pour 1/2 cup peanut sause over tofu and the remaining 1/4 cup over the veggies so they are more flavorful.  Everyone was happy with this dinner and the leftovers were pretty good too.

Just okay,  for the amount of work it takes to fry the tofu - it took three batches - I do not really think the end product was worth the effort. Although we ate it I will not make this again. Followed recipe.

As a vegetarian newbie, I was excited to try this recipe for tofu which I have not been able to cook satisfactorily.  This recipe was a disaster.  Even after I pressed and drained the tofu, it fell apart when I put it in the egg and then sopped up the entire cup of cornstarch resulting in a glewy homogenous mass that stuck to the pan and did not brown.

Delicious! My husband couldn't stop raving about it.   I just made a few revisions -- I didn't have any tofu on hand, so instead swapped in 3 vegetarian chicken breasts. I used flour instead of cornstarch, and less than a 1/4 cup of oil, as a 1/2 cup seemed like too much. I also added some fresh red and yellow peppers and water chestnuts to the frozen veg mix.  Turned out fabulous!!

My wife and I really enjoyed this recipe. It is a very tasty dish without a lot of work. It's not easy to find vegetarian dishes this tasty that don't involve a lot of prep time or a lot of ingredients. I didn't know the tofu pieces would expand as much as they did when they cooked, so I would advise that you cut the tofu into pieces that are quite small.

Wonderful recipe! I used a Thai peanut sauce and fresh veggies (broccoli, bamboo shoots, zucchini, sprouts, mushrooms), added fresh minced garlic and canned ginger. After frying all the tofu (about five batches in a wok), cleaned the wok out, put all tofu in, added peanuts and sauce, and finally, the already cooked veggies. GREAT taste and texture.

Prep time says 15 minutes, but apparently doesn't include the time it takes to make the sauce. Just a lot more work than I expected. Oddly, I am usually the one that likes new dishes and husband doesn't, but this time he liked it and I just didn't care for the taste. Not the worst thing I ever had, but I won't be making it again.

I followed the recipe exactly (other than using fresh veggies vs. the frozen ones) and it even came out looking just like the picture.  However, it tasted like cornstarch.  My understanding is that tofu absorbs the flavors around it, but in this recipe, the only flavor around the tofu as it cooks is cornstarch.  Obviously plenty of other people like this recipe, but I won't me making it again.

I LOVE this recipe! I used flour because I didn't have cornstarch on hand but the tofu still turned out great. I also used jasmine rice and the whole bottle of peanut sauce. After cooking the tofu and adding the sauce I mixed the veggies, peanuts, and more peanut sauce into the wok before serving over rice. I will be making this on a regular basis!

With food prices soaring we decided to try eating more tofu.  This was the first recipe I tried and it has become my husband's NEW FAVORITE.  My kids didn't like it, hence only four stars.  I used fresh veggies instead of frozen.  the more colorful the veggies the more devine it looks too!!  YUM

I thought this recipe was great.  I used the peanut sauce from this site and fresh veg as others had suggested. My husband liked everything except the tofu.  Next time I'll use chicken and save the tofu for when I make it just for myself.

This was a good and easy recipe that was enjoyed by our whole family. Peanut sauce was not used, we used a thai marinade sauce which more preferable to our palettes since one of our family members has an allergy to peanuts. I would make this again. It was served with steamed rice, orange chicken (from this site) and singapore noodles (from this site).

This recipe was totally edible and my husband and I both liked it, but we are both of the opinion that peanut sauces simply go better with noodle dishes.

This was almost great. The problem may have been my own and not the recipe's. The tofu was nice and crunchy until I added it to the vegetables. Then it got soggy. May just add it as a side dish next time.

This turned out to be a great dish.  My only qualm with it was the ridiculously understated cooking time.  5 minutes at medium heat?  For me it took about 25-30 minutes and I ended up turning the heat up to medium high.  I also recommend using soy sauce while cooking the veggies.  Also taste your peanut sauce, I used Thai Peanut Dressing and it turned out to be a tad on the tart side.  In the end the meal was very good though.  One of the few things my girlfriend ate an entire plate of.  That definitely says something.

I love this recipe! I'd never eaten tofu before this dish, and this has gotten me hooked. This stir fry is one of the best, and I will make it again soon!

Everyone in our family really likes this dish...even our most picky kids! In my opinion you can get by with using a lot less cornstarch, but otherwise it is perfect.

This was pretty good. I used all fresh vegetables. I'd recommend trying the peanut sauce first, if you've never had it before. It was my first time having it, and it was a bit sweet for my taste. My husband loved it though!

It was my first time cooking with tofu and I agree that you need firm to extra firm. I used soy sauce instead of peanut sauce and it was delicious.

Very good, I loved the way the tofu texture turned out.  I used fresh veggies but other than that followed the recipe I didn't have any trouble with the tofu sticking, something I worried about from previous experence. I used a non stick wok.

My family and I just do not like the flavor of the peanut sauce, the tofu and veggies were great by themselves.  I do not think there is a problem with the recipe but rather our tastebuds not being aquainted with the flavor.
