Followed recipe exactly and put it in my small slow cooker.  So easy and it makes a tasty, filling dinner.  I shredded the chicken and put it in tortillas with lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, and sour cream.***Had about 1/2 left after first meal.  Made a Chicken Taco Soup the next night by adding leftovers to 2 (14 oz.) cans diced tomatoes, one can blended, 1 can whole kernel corn, 1 can kidney beans, and 1-2 T. of Taco Seasoning I from this site.  Delicious repurposed recipe!

Awesome & easy! I didn't have 4 hours so I cooked on high for a little over 2 hours, shredded it then cooked on low for another 20 minutes. Adults had on hoagies with melted moz on top. Kids loved with white rice on the side. Great for slow cooker Sunday :)

I flipped out a bit when I realized I had NO tomato sauce in my pantry. Whoops. I did have V-8 so I used that instead. I also threw in a handful of fresh cilantro. This smells AMAZING, a lot like the salsa chicken I make on a regular basis. I can only assume we'll love it just like we do salsa chicken. I plan on spooning the sauce over mexican rice and I've made homemade refried beans to go with it. Can't WAIT for dinner. NOTE: I was able to make this in my "Lil' Dipper" crockpot which saved me on counter space and it cooked it perfectly. Cutting the breasts each in half filled up the crockpot 3/4's of the way through so I didn't need to worry about burning my ingredients.

I followed this recipe as posted, except I only had white onion and 2 chicken breasts. To make up for the missing breast, I added a can of black beans. I put the chicken in the crock pot, then poured the beans around it, then layered the remaining ingredients, as instructed. I cooked it on low for a little over 4 hours. It smelled wonderful when I got home! When I took the lid off, I was a little worried that it wasn't going to work well for taco filling (in soft corn tortillas) because it looked a little watery, but when I used the forks to shred the chicken, it absorbed the excess liquid. It made for excellent tacos! Thank you for sharing!

Extremely easy and flavorful!  I used hot salsa since that was all I had and it was quite spicy, but great... I put the meat in tacos with shreaded cheddar and sour cream.  My husband wants it on rotation :)

This is very good! The chicken is not dry and just falls apart! I made burritos out of it with green chile and cheese!

I completely forgot the red onion but this still tasted great.  I added a few dashes of red pepper sauce too.  Served over rice but husband suggested to serve in fajitas next time.  Great flavor.

This was so good!  That even my husband who doesn't even care for chicken loved it.  I was looking for a recipe that was for chicken legs when I can across this recipe, and I liked the ingredients.  I did however change some things to what I had, and because I was in a hurry.  I used dehydrated onions and garlic, and used !/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper instead of chili powder.  I found out my cayenne pepper is really, really hot, and that is why I used only half the amount.  So I can't wait to try this again with chicken breast like it calls for.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent. Made this for the first time today and served it as both the meat in tacos for the kids (5&9) and on Mexican salads for the adults. It was a universal hit. We'll try the chipotle pepper idea next time to spice it up a bit.

This was pretty good.  This is the first time I have cooked in a crock pot.  My crock pot doesn't have a low + 4 or 5 hr option, (it has a "high 4 or 6 hour" setting,) so I set it at "low 8 hrs", and took it out after 4.5 hours.  I live at a high altitude (7000ft+), so things usually take a little longer to cook, but I guess this didn't need extra time. The chicken tasted a little dry and overall it was a bit too spicy for my tastes, so next time I think I'll try cooking it for 4 hrs and try putting in only 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper.  I ate mine on a tortilla with cheddar cheese and some sour cream.  I think it would taste good on a tortilla with plain white rice (that the sauce leftover in the crock pot would flavor) and maybe some bell peppers.

This was a great recipe!!  I even used the typical blah tasting frozen chicken breasts that come in a bag!!  The next day I made tortilla soup from the leftover chicken!  I just added the chicken to some chicken broth with some corn, carrots and crunched up tortilla chips!!!  YUMMY!!!

This was so good.  My family loved it.  I didn't shred the chicken.  I just served the chicken breasts as is and the great thing about this is it's only 4 points on WW points plus plan!

Awesome.  Ingredient changes: added one chicken breast (all 4 thawed in the fridge), used a full (small) can of tomato sauce, used half a white onion instead of red (what I had on hand), 3 cloves of garlic total, and doubled the cumin and chili powder.  BUT, I made/put this together EXACTLY as directed, which I was really skeptical of, given the layers + no mixing (although I did mix the onions and garlic together on the chopping board, and also stirred together the spices) -- but I was AMAZED (and ecstatic) that this turned out so well with such little prep required (and I had everything on hand!!).  Friends raved about it, will definitely make again!

This was such an easy recipe. I used 4 chicken thighs and added a can of pinto beans in the crock pot which made this dish. My husband had 3 helpings. I also served the chicken on gluten free corn tortillas after removing some of the juice. Other than the addition of the beans, I made this recipe exactly as called for which is rare for me. Great keeper!

Recipe was okay.  Make a lot of food, but was lacking in flavor..maybe if the sauce was thicker.

this was tasty.. worried about others saying it was in need of extra spices, i doubled the cumin and chili powder.. i wish i would have sprinkled a bit more salt but that can always be added at the end.. i used half of a small white onion and garlic powder for the fresh.. i splashed a bit of tapatio as well.. i made this with one large breast 11 or 12 oz and three skinless, bone in chicken legs.. i added 1/4 cup of water just to ensure it wouldn't burn.. ty for the recipe.. ~~UPDATE: made this again for dinner and it was great.. used 1 lb chicken breast, El Pato (hot) tomato sauce, 1.5 tsp each of garlic powder and chili powder, 1/2 tsp onion powder, and 1/2 tsp kosher salt (will reduce it next time to 1/4 tsp).. this was almost perfect but a little on the dry side as i didn't add the water this time.. ty again for such a great base

This was so tender! I cooked it on high for a few hrs then turned it to low for a few more. It had a great flavor and was not too spicy. The kids ate it with no complaints. I served it over brown rice with a side of broccoli.

I'm not a shredded chicken lover but this recipe ended up being an instant favorite with the family. It was really good, especially with some mexican rice. Also, just fyi the recipe worked just as well with chicken breasts on the bone. Thanks for sharing.

Delicious! Super easy and tasty recipe. My hubby loved it. I added a can of RoTel tomatoes for a little more spice and it was just perfect. We served it with white rice and flour tortillas. Thanks for sharing :o)

This was very good! I added double of just about everything to spice it up and it turned out juicy and the perfect spiceness for my kiddos! We used it in tacos, but are thinking about using the remainder in chicken enchiladas. Thanks for the great and easy recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly, used a good quality jar of salsa.  But this still was not liked by my family,  I served in pitta breads with a side salad.  This was a quick easy to throw together meal but not something that I will make again.

I made this tonight for dinner. It was very good and easy. I did not have Garlic Cloves so I just used garlic powder. We ate it in soft taco shells with lettuce, cheese, and sour cream. I will make again!

This is delicious and we ate it in soft tortillas.  It is perfect to make on a weekend day when I can turn the crock pot off after 4-5 hours.

This recipe was super easy and delicious!  I added a chopped up jalepeno and used more tomato sauce and salsa than it called for so we would have more sauce.  I served it over brown rice and the sauce made amazing spanish rice.  Can't wait to make this again!

I added a pic of my version. I was short on time so I cooked mine in the pressure cooker. I also doubled the recipe and browned six fat chicken breasts and one finely chopped small onion in oil in my pressure cooker. Then I  added all the other ingredients and cooked in the pressure cooker for 12 minutes. I didn't have any chili pepper on hand, so I eyeballed the ground cumin and curry. I actually think it was better that way. Once the pressure cooker released the steam on its own accord and I shredded the chicken, I poured some of the juices in the pot over the shredded chicken. I also added fresh cilantro as you can see in the picture. My kids LOVED it and it was completely healthy!!

This is super delicious and easy to make. Ive made it even more simple by using just chicken breasts, jar of salsa, a splash of chicken broth and a few dashes of homemade taco seasoning. I'm not a tomato fan so I skipped the tomato. Everyone who has it loves it!

Loved this recipe!! It's not very spicy, for those who love spicy foods like I do. It has a lot of flavor, which is what I loved! Very tender. I started it a little late, so instead of cooking on low in my crockpot, I cooked it on High for 2 hours. Came out perfect. Will definitely make again!

Meh, this was just okay for me. It tasted like chicken and salsa. There are definitely better uses for chicken in this website.

Made this before work adding frozen chicken breasts.  My boys gobbled it up.  I'll add more spice next time as this wasn't very spicy.  Excellent flavor and the chicken was not dry at all.  Served them in tortillas with guacamole with lime-cilantro cauliflower and black beans. Very easy, satisfying week day meal.

I made as directed, no changes.  So simple with on-hand ingredients.  Family loved, even teen boy who is sick of eating so much chicken in our household!  Fantastic on its own or as topping for tostadas/filling for tacos.  This will go in regular meal rotation - thank you!

I made this exactly as written and it was great!  Served it on warm taco-size Flour Tortillas, and let everyone select their own toppings of chopped onion, cilantro, lettuce, avocados, cheese, hot sauce, sour cream and lime sections to squeeze onto the meat.  It was a hit!  I also made the "Best Spanish Rice" recipe from this site, and Refried beans.  It fed 5 adults until we were stuffed, and 1 active 2-year old, and there are still leftovers!

My boyfriend said it needed a little more flavor, but I liked it! We served it over rice the first night, with the crock pot juices spooned over the top (which made it more spicy). Tonight I had leftovers in a tortilla with shredded cheese, which I liked even better. I might try it with hotter salsa or add a little hot sauce next time.

Yum! Turned out great! I used bone-in thighs (3) that I wanted to use up.  Used a combo of regular chili powder and ancho chili powder that I had around.  I did add a bit more of both than called for, as when I tasted it an hour before serving I wanted it kicked up a bit in flavor. Due to some time issues, mine cooked a lot longer than expected,  but it was awesome anyway!  De-boned and shredded, which was so easy.  Served with soft tortillas and hard shells along with typical taco fixings (sour cream, sharp cheddar, lettuce, tomato, onion).  My daughter loved them, despite her fussiness and prejudging.

Delicious and easy to do with items on hand! I too threw measurements to the wind -  added cilantro and a couple diced jalapenos from my garden. Just shredded the chicken and of course had to take a taste - fantastic!

Really yummy. I used a little extra tomato sauce since I had a small can and didn't want to save a small amount. I'm glad I did because I think the chicken needed the extra sauce. I served this in a tortilla with shredded cheese, broccoli slaw, lettuce, and jalapenos. It was a hit!

Down right tasty in spite of the lack of tomato sauce which is an absolute staple in our house; don't know how I missed that, but  the cupboard was bare!  

Kept all the other ingredients the same and wonderful barely described it.  Plan on using the leftover chicken for chicken enchiladas and my taste buds are already salivating.  A two meal dish is always a hit in our household!

I made this and in all fairness I have a chicken taco recipe that I have been making for years that is amazing and actually more simple then this. I wanted to try something different so I made this with the following exceptions- no onion (boyfriend hates onion) and I added red chili pepper flakes because I put them in everything I can. I used Pace medium chunky salsa. The recipe is easy but the end result was very disappointing. The chicken was tender but the flavor was off. It almost had a sweetness to it. It was edible and we did put it in crunchy taco shells with shredded cheese, lettuce and my awesome homemade salsa so maybe had I used fresh salsa it would have been better. Anyway- not good for either of us. Two stars for ease and tenderness of the chicken breast.

Made a cooking change that I have found makes a HUGE difference when results are bland (occurs with every slow cooker recipe that doesn't have creamed soup IMHO). Cook protein in water only (I eyeball it, but make sure protein is covered). Remove protein & shred. Dump water. Then add protein back to empty slow cooker & add spices, etc. and cook for 30-45 minutes on low. Makes a big difference.

Made variations of this many times.  My main advice?  Find some really good salsa, stuff that you love eating by itself, and forget anything else.  A good salsa should add all the flavor you need.  Typically I dump in some celery ribs or chunks of some other acceptable vegetable first and then the chicken so it doesn't rest on the bottom.  I shred my chicken when there's an hour or so to go and mix it back with the sauce.  You can do a finer mince on the celery or whatever at the same time.  If you end up with too much liquid, use the extra to make some rice to go with this.

Made per recipe, cooked in crock pot an hour or two longer just because I did not get home from work on time!  We had burritos with cheese, sour cream, tomatoes, and salsa - excellent.  Super easy, will definitely do again.

I doubled this recipe and added corn. There was enough stock that you could actually use it for chicken tortilla soup you could shred and leave in half the chicken and have the other chicken breasts for another yummy meal. So so so good and super easy!

Delicious! I used four chicken breasts with 3/4 jar of "hot" salsa and did not use chili powder. I used the rest of the ingredients listed. I cooked on HIGH for 3 hours and then shredded the chicken and put it back in the slow cooker on LOW for 1 hour with the addition of 1/3 cup of chopped cilantro. I am serving on flour tortillas as tacos with shredded Mexican cheese and sour cream along with Mexican rice and refried beans. I will be adding to my monthly rotation of recipes!

This is a super moist, and versatile, chicken recipe.   I made to use part in a pasta recipe and froze the rest to use later.   It'd be useful for chicken tacos, burritos, nachos, and quesadillas.  THANKS for the recipe, shmeya!

Yummy! Used 2 huge chicken breasts, 1 Tbsp minced onion instead of the red one and a whole chipotle chopped with seeds and about a heaping Tbsp of adobo sauce. Cooked on High for 4 hours then turned it off until we were ready to eat about 1 1/2 hours later. Delicious over brown rice and there is enough left over for 1 person's meal.

This was good. I will make this again. The only thing I added was cilantro in the last hour of cooking. I made fajitas with the chicken.

super easy and full of flavor! Made without onion and added a few dashes of pepper sauce and made tacos/burritos with it. Tasted even better the next day. This is a winner!

I made this for dinner tonight. It turned out so yummy! I didn't have fresh onion or garlic on hand so I used onion salt and garlic powder instead. I also increased the recipe a bit to make more. So it was kinda improvised in the amounts of the ingredients. It turned out amazing! My family loves it. I can't wait to try it for things other than rice :) Thanks for posting this! :)

Delicious. I put it over rice and didn't use chili powder due to small kids and wife that doesn't like spice. I added fresh oregano, rosemary, and basil. Also added a couple peppers red and green from the garden just chopped up. Kids enhaled this!!! Will be made again.

This recipie was so amazing. We used chicken tenders instead of full chicken breasts because that is what we had. Other than that we followed the recipie exaclty. The chicken came out so tender and shredded so easily.  I served it with spanish rice, shredded colby jack cheese and flour tortillas we made burrtios. The only downfall we didn't make enough my fiance wants more!

I made this for a work party and it was completely gone in 15 minutes. Like others, I doubled the spices and added a small can of green chili’s. When there was about 10 minutes left I added some shredded cheese and mixed it all together. Everyone loved it and several people asked for the recipe.

I used chicken legs because that's what I had on hand. I doubled the recipe and used minced onions instead of fresh.
 I added some frozen corn and fresh avocado .It was delicious over quinoa and brown rice and it made a great bowl.

I felt as did husband, that it “needed” something. The chicken was tender, but bland. This may have been because of the salsa I chose, so next time, I would select a different one. I would brown the chicken for a little added flavor and add more spice to up the flavor.

I used 2 boneless, skinless chicken breast and 2 bone in, skin on chicken thighs. This was amazing! I followed the recipe exactly. I did end up cooking it in my crock pot for 8 hours on low, instead of the 4-5 hours, the meat completely fell off the bones, did not even run across 1 bone ! I served it over rice. Some guests had it wrapped on corn shells , with sour cream on the side.  I will definitely be making this great recipe again. Thank you Shmeya for sharing.

I add extra onion, garlic, and about 12 oz of chicken broth (with at least 1-2 tablespoons of chicken base).  I also tend to add more like 1/2-1 Tbsp of both chili powder and cumin, as well as adding 1-2 Tbsp dried cilantro, 1 Tbsp onion powder, and 1/2 tsp red chili pepper to give it some spice. You'll have to cook down the mixture a bit before you add the chicken so there isn't too much liquid at the end but it ends up tasting amazingly flavorful.

To make it more of a salsa verde shredded chicken, I leave out the tomato paste and sub the red salsa with salsa verde, 1 can green chili peppers, and the juice of 1 large lime. If there isn't enough lime taste, you can add some lime zest.

I love this recipe because you can use it for a very healthy dinner where you simply spoon a large amount on a small corn tortilla and top it with cheese, tomato, onion, and guacamole, so sort of like a tostada but without the fried tortilla. To make it even healthier,  like to sub iceburg lettuce instead of the tortilla so it ends up being sort of like a lettuce wrap.

My kids loved this!! It was as so easy and so yummy on Kaiser rolls. My family begged for the left overs the next night. This would also be delicious in a salad and I’m sure many other things. I will be making this again for sure. Probably once a week!

This was excellent!  I made for a birthday party and needed to make more, so I made this using 8 chicken thighs.  I prefer thighs to breasts because they are juicier.  I doubled the rest of the ingredients and it was all gone at he end of the party.  The only thing that I changed was I used white onions because I didn't have red.  I got lots of compliments on how good it was.  I will definitely make again.

A big hit!  Served for dinner for our extended family.  Put 4 frozen boneless, skinless chicken breast, added a can of chili beans, and subbed a can of Rotel for the tomato sauce ( without the juice).  Otherwise followed recipe with a bit of additional spices since I had added chicken.  Used half regular chili powder and 1/2 chipotle chili powder.  Cooked on low for 51/2 hours, shredded the chicken and kept on Warm till time to eat.  Served with corn tortillas, lettuce, cheese, avocado, olives, and tomatoes.  Everyone loved it.  Will definitely make it again.

This is very tasty. The first night I served it on tortillas. Unfortunately, we didn't have any sour cream which would have been good with this. The second night I made spicy rice to go with the chicken. The two together made an excellent combination and this is how I will serve this dish from now on. Both my husband and I enjoyed the meal and agreed it is definitely worth repeating.

We loved this.  So simple, cheap, fast, easy, versatile.  Love this shredded in the flour tortillas with jalapenos,  cheese, guacamole but also put on rice later in the week with veggies and a more normal meal.  Good anyway you want to do it!

This turned out so well! The chicken was juicy and flavorful. I used half of chipotle salsa and half of medium salsa. The best part was it wasn't too spicy for my husband and just enough slice for me!

Super simple and delicious recipe that you can eat a lot of ways!  I make it at least twice a month. We make soft tacos out of it. We've also used it to make shredded chicken nachos, tostadas, and I've served it inside a halved avocado.

This was a very good and versatile recipe. I used it on taco salad, rice, tortillas, add even a Mexican egg scramble.

We like very hot and spicy foods so I added adobo sauce.  
Awesome!

This is a great recipe.  Served with cilantro lime rice, tortillas and salsa, guacamole, sour cream.  Huge hit.  Froze the rest of the chicken and used again for spicy chicken nachos.  It's a keeper!

Making this for the third time. Have served it as tacos and as chicken breasts with a Spanish rice. Definitely "in the rotation" I tend to go a bit heavy on the garlic and cumin, and have used white onion every time because it's what I always have around. Great, tasty dish

I love this recipe!  It is a staple in my home.  I sometimes play with the ingredients and add black beans. I've even been out of  tomato sauce etc and just used 3/4 a jar of Pace hot picante sauce and it is still delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

After reading the reviews, I made quite a few changes and it turned out absolutely delicious! I used 16oz of fresh salsa and 2 tbsp. of tomato paste. I then doubled the garlic and spices that were called for, and added some fresh cilantro. When I say this was delicious, I am not exaggerating. I am salivating right now just thinking about it.

I made this in a large slow cooker for my husband and myself for the first time last week.  I followed the recipe to a T and after I thought it was pretty good and my husband did as well, but I wasn't sure it was something we would make again.  The next day there was a small amount of leftovers, so I put them in a low carb tortilla and added a small amount of ranch as a sauce and ate it as a wrap...delicious! I loved it so much that today I used our small slow cooker to cook just 1 piece of chicken, followed the recipe for the remaining items (added double the called for salsa and tomato sauce) and added in half a jalapeño pepper and half a red bell pepper, with the ranch as sauce after cooked.  Today's version will be an easy go to lunch that I will be eating weekly.  Fantastic!

I have made this twice and it was awesome both times.  Added red pepper flakes and Sriracha to kick it up a bit. Served in a wrap with plain Greek yogurt and guacamole. Rave reviews from my friends. So easy and delicious.

I thought it was tasty and healthy, but my husband was not a big fan.  Probably because he is more of a meat and potato guy.  I put it on taco shells with lettuce, cilantro,and the usual additives.

Turned out really good! Great flavor with the added chipotles in adobo sauce. I blended two chipotles with the salsa, tomatoes, and spices. Left out the red onion and used some minced dried onion I had on hand instead. Also used 1/2 cup of chicken broth in the bottom of the slow cooker. Cooked on low for 8 hours. Took chicken out and shredded it Ina bowl and then added a cup of the juices to moisten it. Used it for chicken soft tacos. Kids loved it. Really good! Thank you for the recipe!

I'd make it again.  I used hot salsa.  I filled whole grain tortillas with it, covered it with enchilada sauce and cheese blend for a Mexican burrito.

Super easy to make but in my family's opinion in need of additional spices. After making it, I added additional salt, chili powder and cumin - as well as a little cinnamon - to give it more flavor.  I served the chicken in crunchy taco shells with corn, black beans, pickled jalepenos and avocado. So delicious!!! This is also a dish I think you could easily freeze for additional meals (just the filling that is). Also, in my opinion this dish is not spicy at all - not at all - which is why I added the pickled jalepenos on top. If you are looking for spicy, I would add Rotel diced tomatoes with jalepenos instead of plain canned tomatoes. You could also use hot salsa instead of medium which is what I used.

It smelled great while it was cooking.  We added the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce as well.  There was no spice or any  spicy flavor to this at all.

Great taste, very simple, most ingredients on hand. A little juicy for putting in tortilla. Would drain some off next time.

It was okay but we didn't love it.   Basically, I followed the recipe but it needed more and different flavor.  I added scallions and black beans the second day.  It was a bit better.

Versatile -- we liked it.  Easy and adaptable.  I made it as written, but I can imagine cranking up the heat or cooling it off.  Useful on its own or as a filling for sandwiches or tacos.

I made it as the recipe called for. The chicken was really nice and I easily was able to shread it by smashing it with a potato masher in the crock pot. I will make it again but next time will add a little more Salt and I will double the cumin. I will also chop 1 jalapeno pepper up and add it for a little more kick. We made Tacos with it but could easily have made burritos or nachos with the meat. I took yellow rice and added chopped tomatoes with chilies to it for Mexican rice. Real nice and super easy meal.

Depending on how much tomato sauce you use I would recommend adding corn starch and cheese to make the sauce thicker but the flavor is perfect!

This has great flavor!  The only thing I HAD to change was to use mild salsa so the kiddos could eat it.  The hubs and I did do a nice shake of some hot pepper seasoning after we made ours though :)  Very good and made our house smell wonderful!  Thanks!

Great easy recipe! I make it at least 2 times a month. I use a full 8oz can of tomato sauce, with no other changes. My boyfriend loves it and I've made it for taco night with friends, all rave reviews.

So incredibly good and so easy!! I used organic chicken strips to cook the flavor in and used 3/4 of a jar of local salsa instead of the tomato sauce.  I also used a garlic mill instead of minced garlic to make it quicker and it was amazing!  I used corn tortillas to make it healthier and added green salsa, Serrano peppers and cheese as a topper to make it as good as any restaurant tacos I've ever had. The other 3 people in my office demanded the recipe. :)

I chopped the onion and garlic and put it as a bed for the chicken.  My experience with slow cookers is that the meat needs to have a bed to sit on so it doesn't burn.  This was delicious and has been added to my mix.  I work mornings and my husband 3-11 so I make the night before in the slow cooker, shred the chicken and reheat on the stove before he goes to work.  I think letting the flavors marry overnight 
makes it even better!

One of our favorite Mexican restaurants serves a terrific "burrito jalisco".  I have wanted to find a chicken recipe to equal it and this is it!  I shredded the chicken and made a burrito dinner and it was excellent!!

This was really good!I served in tortillas with lettuce raw onions and sour cream. Only thing I added was a little bit of Habanero Red Pepper Garlic seasoning and used a regular onion as I didn't have a red one. I used the left overs with some pasta and left over tomato sauce. It was really yummy. Thanks for the recipe.

Great taste! The chicken released a lot of juice so I ended up turning this into chicken chili by adding some boiled beans that I had as leftovers from a previous night.

I made this the other night, and received rave reviews from my family.  The only thing I did differently was added a can of enchilada sauce (the tomato taste was just a bit too overpowering for us).  It was served with rice, sour cream, and tortillas, which was scrumptious! I have added a new recipe to my rotation, thank you!

I don't usually change recipes when I haven't tried them before but I decided to make a couple changes to this one.  I used 4 chicken breasts, an entire bottle of salsa, 1 can of tomato sauce, 2 cans of chicken broth, chopped garlic, cumin and chili powder.  I cooked it on high approx 4.5 hours, then I shredded the meat and drained put the meat back inside the cooking liquid for about 30 min longer, to give it some extra flavor.  Used it to make chicken burritos, it was delicious!

Really yummy, easy recipe! The only two things I changed was I added a tsp each of garlic and onion powder and I used mild salsa because my family doesn't like spicy food. I served it with tortillas and cheddar. In the morning I used the leftovers with scrambled eggs to make breakfast burritos and it was fantastic the second day too! Will definately make again!

Tried this recipe and added a little Adobo seasoning.  It's really a great recipe but turned out really acidic with all the tomato sauce and salsa so I added one packet of Splenda at the end and it balanced it just right.  I also added a few skinless chicken thighs to the breasts and that turned out well, too.  Great recipe! Served it in corn tortillas with some fresh cilantro and chopped onions like they serve in taco carts here. . . , that was good!!

This was a good recipe to stem from.  Needs more items added to it like spanish rice or green peppers and tomatoes.  Also need to flavor it more.  I would double the cumin and chili powder next time.

Very quick and simple recipe.  Fork shred and served in tortilla with sour cream, guacamole, and/or shredded cheddar cheese.  Or drain the liquid well and use as the ingredient in a tamale bake recipe or any other recipe that calls for shredded chicken with a mexican-style bent.  Also good in macaroni and cheese along with fresh diced jalapeno.

Pretty good. Served with rice, but next time would use as a taco or burrito filler.

The best!  This chicken falls apart.  I serve it on baked potatoes or in tortillas.  I had to increase the serving size because my family that doesn't care much for left overs was so upset that there weren't any.  It's a delicous low calorie dish that is very easy to make & doesn't require any special ingredients.  Great job!
