OMG! My husband and I LOVE wings and we make our own hot sauce so we rarely venture to make any "different" kinds of sauces. Well, this little gem is a real winner and I'm so glad I tried it - no changes at all. It's fabulous! It's a little heat with a little sweet! If you love wings you have to try this recipe at least once......

This is the best chicken wing sauce ever! I had 9 large chicken drumsticks, first I took 1 cup flour, 1/2 cup bread crumbs, salt and pepper, mixed in a bowl,I coated the chicken in this mixture. then I melted 1/2 stick of butter and poured it into a disposable foil lasagna pan coating the bottom of the pan, place the chicken in the pan and bake 20 minutes at 400 degrees turn chicken and bake 20 more minutes. when chicken is done coat with saauce and enjoy! can't wait to use this on bonless chicken strips. Thanks for sharing!

Very interesting wing recipe. I had my husband try it as he's the wing master. He followed the recipe exact(no subs for him, he's still green in the kitchen) and it came out perfectly. Good flavor.

I realized I was out of honey mustard so I made the "yummy honey mustard dipping sauce" from this site.  Hubby grilled some chicken legs and this sauce was perfect.

These were OK.  Maybe it was the honey mustard I used (French's) but the mustard really was overpowering.  If I made these again I would try a different brand of honey mustard and do a 1/2 1/2 ratio for hot pepper sauce and honey mustard.

Great recipe very similar to "Hurricane Wings" Gold Rush...I added a tablespoon of sugar to cut down on some of the tang.

I put this on chicken legs and we cooked them on the charcoal grill. I used salted butter and omitted the salt called for in the recipe. I didnt try one but my husband liked them alot he ate 4 and a hamburger.

Super spicy but lots of flavor.  I would have clicked five stars but while people seemed to like the flavor, they didn't go very fast at the Super Bowl party compared to the Honey Chipotle and BBQ wings.

Don't know what happened! The wings were pricked and marinated for four hours and they came out bland. I tried this recipe along with the Lemon Dijon wings and I'm happy I split the batch of wings for this very reason!

Made this with chicken breasts and it turned out great.  I used dried cilantro instead of basil, and only used 3 cloves of garlic.  I put the extra marinade on the stove and simmered it for 10 minutes and poured it over the chicken and rice.  Really good!

Great basic recipe to use if you want something to go off of. We used this recipe as a starting point for the sauces we made.

I cannot stress enough that you need to flour the wings first, then toss them. Otherwise the butter in the sauce runs off into the pan.

Delish!

I made this with half the hot sauce since I am a heat wimp. I liked it. My teenager likes to have his mouth set on fire so he probably ended up doubling the hot sauce in the end. He kept adding too it. Thanks for the recipe.

It was good, but a bit to tangy with the mustard.  It was very tasty when everything is hot, but by the time you get to the sixth wing to eat it, the butter makes it coagulate and it's not good at that point.

This recipe is so easy!  I made it using a few chicken thighs I had that I chopped into nuggets.  (It's what I had in the house and we wanted gold wings.)  These were eaten so fast!  I'm definitely adding this recipe to my "go-to's" for quick and easy snacks or suppers!

made this and it was amazing. I didn't have any honey mustard so I made my own. I do not know if that altered the taste of the recipe over store bought honey mustard.

I used catlemans brand bbq sauce that was Carolina style. And Franks red hot. Tasted awesome. As far as I'm concerned. Similar to the 99 restaurant.

I used Honey Mustard Dressing II from this site, which we LOVE, but it's more of a dressing/dip. I'd say to make sure your honey mustard doesn't have a mayo base, and I think I'd try it with less butter. It tasted a little too mayonnaise-y and greasy the first day, but it was great the next day. It reminds us of the Colorado Coppers wings at our favorite wing place ever!

I'm always looking for different wing sauces. This one is a keeper. I didn't even need any dip.
