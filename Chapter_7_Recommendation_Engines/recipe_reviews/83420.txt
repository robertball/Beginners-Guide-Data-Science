I think when you read this recipe, you can see that it would be bland.  There is no mixing of the flavors.  So, I did steam my broccoli in my Micro steamer for 2 to 3 min.  Then I added the broccoli to the garlic in the skillet to saute, for about 2 min... set aside off fire with lid on it for about 2 min. I then put the broccoli, garlic and cheese in with pasta, put on lid and let that set as I finished the rest of dinner about 10 min.  O and I forgot to save the pasta water, so I put in 3tbs of chicken broth.. I only made 1/2 of this recipe as there is only two of us.  You have to let the flavors meld. I did not change the recipe just the course of how its prepared to more flavor.  If you want more garlic taste too, add a few cloves to your pasta water as it cooks. Thanks... I tried this because broccoli and pasta is my sons favs...

This is a standard Italian dish...I like to cook the broccoli in with the pasta for the last 5 mins...then drain. I use closer to 8 cloves of garlic, saute in oil, add pasta water and 1/2 cup of chicken broth..simmer so flavors meld.Mix all together and add plenty of grated cheese and fresh ground pepper. Make it into a meal by adding shrimp or Italian sausage to the garlic and oil, then combine everything! Mangia!

If you are looking for a pasta dish without a heavy cream or tomato sauce, this received rave reviews from diners.  I added toasted pine nuts (1/2 cup), sauteed red pepper flakes (1 tsp.) to give the recipe some depth.  By request I will be making this again.

This was a simple almost healthy dish. I used whole wheat elbow pasta since I had it on hand. I also boiled the broccoli since I don't have a steamer. I sauteed red pepper flakes with the garlic & I poured the oil in until I got a nice consistancy. This was loved by my 3 children. I will be making this cheap dinner again.

I had to add a little extra to this b/c it just sounded bland. Instead of bowties, I used Barilla tortellini (large package), and instead of just garlic, I used 1 tsp. Mrs. Dash Tomato, Basil and Garlic mix (I think next time I'm going to add 2 tsp instead--to give it more flavor). It came out WONDERFUL. This is such a good recipe. I'm eating the leftovers for lunch right now, actually. Also, instead of just Romano, I used Kraft's Parmesan, Romano and Asiago cheese mix---but only b/c my store didn't have just Romano. Hubby even said this was a keeper and he's not one for pasta dishes!

Wonderful! I did make some changes-I cut the recipe in half & didn't measure the broccoli; I just eyeballed it. I also used penne pasta; all I had on hand. I only used 1/4 cup cheese (used a parmesan/romano blend) & that was really all it needed. I also didn't use the pasta water-also found that unnecessary! I cut up 1 lb chicken, seasoned it with italian seasoning & garlic & added that to the pasta/broccoli for a one-dish meal. I also used 2 tsp Mrs Dash tomato basil garlic blend which made it taste great; highly recommended! A very tasty, quick meal.

My family enjoyed this recipe tremendously! Even my 3 year old! I did make some changes though; instead of Romano I used parmesan cheese, instead of steaming the broccoli separately I added to the garlic and oil and covered for about 10 minutes, instead of plain salt I used garlic salt and because our family loves garlic, I used about 10 total garlic loves. This recipe was easy, extremely tasty and filling.

The basic recipe is good, but it's not enough. You need to add plenty of other spices...garlic powder, italian seasoning, salt, and basil were my choices. I also thought that it would be really dull with just broccoli, pasta, and spices so I spiced it up a bit with hard salami chunks and pepperoni slices. It was a huge success at our family christmas party! I sauteed the garlic as prescribed and steamed the broccoli. Thanks for the great base recipe, I just like my pasta salad with a little kick!

Nothing fancy or particularly special, just good - but then just about anything mixed up with pasta is a winner in my book.  I cooked up some bacon along with the garlic and added it along with some of the drippings. Nice accompaniment to our roasted stuffed chicken.

Easy to make and had everything on hand. I added some garlic and onion spice and mixed everything in the pan on the stove for a few minutes before serving. I will make this again!

I have been making this simple, delicious recipe for years. Only thing I do different is I add a few pats of butter to the olive oil and garlic mixture, and I add the cooked pasta to the skillet to toss before transferring to a serving bowl. Sometimes I skip the addition of cheese for a lighter side dish, but if I serve this as a main dish, I always add the cheese. Oh, and I also use 1 or 2 extra cloves of garlic. Sometimes if I'm short on time, I use frozen broccoli in the steam bags, which makes this recipe super quick to put together. In my book, you can't go wrong with this dish, we all love it :)

I made a version of this recipe (did not do any measuring) and added some sliced shallots and shredded mozzarella cheese. I also added salt & pepper. Yum!

I made this last night and got rave reviews from my husband and two teenage boys.  The only reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5, is because I made a few changes to note.  
I cooked a few chicken tenderloins in olive oil in the skillet to give the meal a little something extra.  I threw that in with the cooked, drained noodles, and then in the same skillet (added more olive oil), I sauteed the garlic and some pine nuts, and then tossed the steamed broccoli into it to combine the flavors.  I then put all of that into the noodles/chicken, and seasoned it with basil, red pepper flakes, and salt and pepper.  I tossed it with the romano cheese and served it.  I doubled this recipe, and our family of four ate almost the whole thing!  Very yummy!!  
Bon Appetite! :)

This recipe was pretty bland, but a great base recipe and concept.  I added red pepper (like someone suggested), more garlic, and basic Italian seasonings.

Very bland. Ended up putting a jar of Alfredo sauce on top of it. Added additional seasonings though I reduced the minced garlic amount. Won't make again.

I thought it was good, but pretty bland.  Maybe some red pepper flakes and a little italian dressing would've spiced it up a bit.

My family has been making this for years.  It's a fresh and simple side dish or lunch item.  Those looking for a complex meal this is not it at all and is obvious by the ingredient list.  It's not helpful to say this is bland or no flavor when clearly it's not meant to be something more than it is.  If you like more flavor then add them.  I've add red pepper flakes, black pepper, or a sprinkle of Italian dressing times for something different but mostly I love it as is.

I made a couple of small changes; cut the oil to about 1/3 of a cup, blanched the broccoli for 2 minutes and then added to the garlic in the pan to blend flavors. Kids loved it too.

Pretty good base recipe. I did as others suggested and sauted the broccoli with the garlic. Next time I might add pine nuts, a dash of red pepper (maybe?) and some basil.

I changed quite a bit.  Instead of cheese, I used diced salami and cooked it on the stovetop, adding the garlic, onion, yellow bell pepper, and broccoli to the salami.  When the pasta was cooked, I mixed it together.  I had shredded cheese on the side to add if desired.  I thought it was great, and very healthy as the pasta to veggie ratio was good.

this was quick and good. Not too much variation at all either -  I blanched the brocolli and then sauteed it quickly with the garlic and oil. I also used Kosher Salt instead of regular salt. My daughter ate every bite...so it was have been good.

If there was a 3.5 rating I would have given it to this dish. A little bland but over all a nice simple dish. I will make again but take the advice of others who said they would add butter to the oil

We added sweet sausage, red pepper flakes, and extra garlic.  Also substituted chicken broth for the pasta water and then sauteed everything together for a few minutes.  Turned out EXCELLENT - we will definitely make this again.

Overall I thought this was o.k., I ate my helping, but my overwhelming impression was: BLAND!  I even added grilled chicken, pine nuts, extra cheese, & garlic and basil seasoning as others had suggested in other reviews and it still was missing "it."  Definitly underseasoned for my taste and my husbands as well.  Not sure what else to try to make it tastier...so I guess that's it for this recipe!

This recipe is excellent, and I've been cooking it for several years now, but I usually modify it to add a little more flavor and some lean protein. For starters, I always use whole wheat or multigrain pasta. Then, I'll typically follow the recipe directions listed. To add protein, I'll cook 2-3 chicken breasts on the stovetop seasoning them with Mrs. Dash's tomato and basil garlic seasoning along with dried parsley and a little onion powder. Once the chicken has been cooked through, I slice or dice it (depending on my mood) and toss it into the broccoli & bowtie mixture. Then, I add 1/4 to 1/2 cup of tomato & basil flavored feta cheese crumbles and toss the pasta once again to blend the ingredients well. As someone who is not a pasta lover, I find this dish to be delicious, healthy, and satisfying. It makes a ton of food, so it's good to make early in the week and eat all week long or for a dinner party where you'll need to feed a crowd. I've always received tons of compliments on this dish when making it with the modifications mentioned above. I hope this helps!! :-)

Easy, tasty, dinner. I used the recommendation of adding chicken stock and red pepper flakes. It was easy to leave some noodles and broccoli plain for my picky eater.

This is my second time trying this dish, and the second time was definately the charm. The first time I made it exactly as written and found it a tad dry and bland, as did many other reviewers. I really wanted to like this dish because it is so easy and a different way to enjoy pasta. This time I did things slightly different. First. I steamed my broccoli to our liking. When mixing everything together I decided to add about 1/4 cup butter in addition to the olive oil called for (I used extra virgin) for some extra richness and stirred in about 6-8oz. feta cheese. It turned out fantastic! I know I will be making this again and again. Thanks for posting :)

This was really good. My only suggestions are to increase the amount of broccoli and throw in some extra cheese. Otherwise wouldn't change anything. I don't agree with other reviewers that it's too bland. The Pecorino Romano gives it a lot of flavor. Make sure you put on a generous seasoning of pepper--that perks it up even more.

I love pasta and I love broccoli, so decided to give this a try.  I took note of reviewers'comments and made some changes.  While steaming the broccoli and cooking the pasta, I sauteed some turkey Italian sausage (remove casings) in a little olive oil, adding the garlic and some red pepper flakes in the final minutes of cooking.  Then I mixed the steamed broccoli, drained pasta, sausage and cheese all together.  I ddi add some of the pasta water to give it a little "juice".  I'd recommend using either chiecken or trkey Italian sausage, and use spicy if you find it gives it some additional flavor.  This is a nice dish; the original recipe is a bit ho-hum and suggests using way too much olive oil!

This was good but lacking in flavor. I didn't seem to be able to add enough seasonsings. I think next time I will let the dish cool and toss with Italian dressing.

I cooked the broccoli for a few minutes with the garlic, oil, basil, red pepper flakes, and a chopped shallot.  Then let it sit off the flame for about 5 minutes.  Letting the pasta sit with the broccoli and cheese definitely helped the flavors meld.  Will definitely make again.

I liked this concept a lot, I usually always make pasta with a red sauce so it was a nice change.  However, I did change it up.  First, I bought precooked shrimp and heated it with the garlic(I used 4-5 cloves finely chopped)in olive oil and seasoned it with garlic powder, coarse black pepper, cayenne pepper, and dried basil.  I cooked for about 10 to 15 minutes(making sure to stir frequently)and then added the steamed broccoli and cooked for a few more minutes in the oil.  I then added the mixture to the pasta, added romano cheese, and olive oil and pasta water as desired.
Turned out great!

It was okay, bland, which my kids liked, I think it was missing something.  Because I am a cook who needs to follow an exact recipe I can't figure out what to add to make it more flavorful, but a good basic recipe.

Ok, this was pretty good but be sure to follow suggestions, such as "cheesecakemama". I followed it plus added a pinch of pepper flakes or to taste and some crispy crumbled bacon from breakfast. Add chicken broth instead of water, salt and pepper to taste and you have a pretty tasty meal. Its great for a side dish or leave out the bacon and you have a vegetarian meal.

I really did not care for this receipe. I cut this recipe in half, and instead of sliced garlic, I used minced garlic (the one that comes in the jar)and added Mrs. Dash's Tomato-Basil-Garlic seasoning. To me it had too much garlic flavor... Maybe it was because I used the minced garlic instead of the sliced garlic, I don't know. I like garlic, but I do not like tasting garlic hours later after I ate .... Probably will not make again.

Followed the recipe as written but after mixing it all up added garlic powder, salt and pepper.  Found it a bit dry so if I make it again will add either Italian dressing or oil to moisten it.

This was great as a base, but I did change it up a bit by adding two links of hot Italian sausage, cooked in skillet, then chopped. I added frozen broccoli to the pasta for the last few minutes. Drain pasta then stirred in the sausage and grated cheese. Big hit. Quick and delicious.

This is a great recipe.  I needed more broccoli I didn't have Romano cheese only Parmigiana will make again with more broccoli and Romano cheese.  Even my picky son who does not like pasta ate the whole thing!

A basic recipe that you can build up to your tastes by adding spices and herbs. Kids really enjoy this recipe but for adults, I'd add some crushed red pepper and even some basil. This is a tasty (and cheap) lunch for the family. Thanks for sharing!

See, this recipe has been in my family for YEARS and the major differences lie in 2 added ingredients: a dash of paprika and a dash of crushed red pepper flakes with the oil and garlic.

I think a little lemon zest and juice helps lift this up. I like using the pasta water in sauce. Easy to whip up with whats on hand. and tasty.

This was a very basic pasta recipe.  Nothing to really be excited about.  We steamed the broccoli in the microwave and used chicken broth to add extra flavor.   We may make it again, but with adjustments.

Very good and simple. Not a "wow" dish, but filling and tasty. No need for extra salt if you are using the Pecorino Romano cheese, imo.

This is the first recipe I've tried from allrecipes.com, and it certainly won't be the last! I am definitely a beginner cook, and I found this recipe easy to follow. I think from start to finish, it took me about 30 minutes. My husband and I like garlic, but next time I think we will cut out a clove. Four was a little strong for us. We will definitely make again, and will eat yummy leftovers all week!

This recipe has been a standard in my family(Italian) for years. I suggest though to steam the broccoli, when it's almost cooked throw the broccoli in with the garlic and saute for a few minutes. I also use about 1 cup of chicken broth to add flavor. Top with cheese and eat with bread and a salad.

I've been making this recipe since I've been on my own.  I like it with even less spice than what's called for in the recipe.  Sometimes my taste buds need a break and this is the recipe that will do that.  I will have to try it with the garlic and cheese.  I usually just eat it with the noodles and broccoli and a little salt and pepper!  This is also a good before payday meal too.  I totally recommend this for those of you who just need something simple, plain and just delicious!

I steam fresh brocolli all the time but never thought of tossing it with pasta.Good way of getting the kids to eat their veggies. You can also take about 5 or more cloves and slice the garlic and then put the cloves in a bowl and combine with some olive oil. Then take that garlic and put in the bottom of your steamer, then the brocoli. Drizzle the broccoli with some more oil then steam. It will infuse the broccoli and cook the garlic at the same time.

Quick and simple! Next time I will add  some chopped fresh basil to the oil and garlic to add flavor to the somewhat bland cheese sauce. But as simple as it is, it is tasty.

With a few minor changes, this recipe turned out EXCELLENT! After steaming the broccoli, I tossed in with the garlic and oil for a few minutes. That helped to blend the flavors a bit. Also, I took a suggestion from another review to use chicken broth instead of reserved pasta water. This recipe was quick, easy and good!! I will definitely make it again...thanks!!

The only thing I added was 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes to the oil.I let them sit a couple minutes with the garlic in the oil with the heat on low.  When the broccoli was finished, I stirred in a tsp or so of shallot butter to add an extra layer of flavor.  Dee-lish!

This was the first thing we made in our new house tonight - we all enjoyed it very much.  Instead of fresh broccoli, we used a whole bag of frozen and it was fine.  Everything else we did as the recipe.  I think we will try adding some grilled chicken to this as well.  Very yummy meal.

I really enjoyed this recipe, I only changed it by using whole wheat pasta.  It was super easy and tasty too!  I will definately prepare again for a fast meal.  I may add shrimp or chicken next time around.

I also added more broccoli, and i grated some fresh motzarella into it as well. Season it with salt and pepper and it was delicious, everyone loved it!

I make a version of this in which you sautee 1 anchovie, with the garlic and a pinch of pepper flakes, before adding the broccoli and finally the pasta, and for gods sake use fresh grated cheese! it only takes a few minutes and tastes better then that waxy tasing kraft stuff

I enjoyed this recipe, but my children were not impressed.  I will make it occasionally, but not as often as I was hoping.
