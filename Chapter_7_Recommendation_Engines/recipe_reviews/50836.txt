After reading the other reviews I made some changes. The end result was PERFECT!!! IT CAME OUT BETTER THAN MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT. If you make it this way you will not be dissapointed. This is what I did: I mixed in the blender 1/4 c canola oil, 1 medium onion, 1 red bell pepper and 5 cloves of garlic to create a chunky paste. I then sauted it for 4 min, lowered the heat to simmer and added 2 tsp minced ginger, 2 tbsp curry powder, 1 tsp ground cumin, 1 tsp sugar, 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes and 2 tbsp flour, mixing energetically for 2 min. I then gradually added 2 c of light coconut milk all the while mixing energetically untill the sause thickened and became uniform. I simmered the sauce for 4 min, then increased the heat to medium-high again, added the shrimp, mixed well to coat and cooked for 4-5 min. Finally I added 1/2 c chopped fresh cilantro and 3/4c shredded coconut, mixed one last time and turned off the heat. THE RESULT WAS HARDLY ENOUGH FOR 2 CURRY LOVERS!!! YUM, YUM, YUM! THANK YOU DAKOTA and all the reviewers! I also plan on making this with chicken and I will try peanuts instead of shredded coconut next time.

This recipe needs to have the roux made in the beginning of the sauce (to eliminate any pasty taste).  I used a combination of butter and oil (3 TBPS) and sauted the onions in that, then I added the spices and 2 TBPS of flour, eliminating the cornstarch.  Cook for one minute then add the coconut milk.  I used 2 TBSPS of curry.

This was absolutely fantastic.  The only changes I made were I doubled the coconut milk, curry powder, and crushed red pepper flakes, and just before I served it I added some shredded coconut.  Wow.  I will definietely make this again.  I think it would also be great with tofu or chicken instead of shrimp.

The way I made it was only worth four stars, but I made some poor alterations.  I didn't have coriander or cilantro and I love both... so I shouldn't have made it without them.  Secondly, I didn't see the need for the teaspoon of sugar, but in hindsight, I should have.  On a good note, I did what a prior review AGLIKA recommended and put the first few ingredients in a food processor before sauteeing.  This thickened the sauce nicely and I didn't have to add the cornstarch/H20. I also up'd the red pepper flakes which gave it more heat.  I cannot wait to make this recipe again THE RIGHT WAY.
On a Side Note:  I always loved curry-coconut shrimp in restaurant eventhough nutrition-wise, it's right up there with alredo sauce.  So, I could never bring myself to make this at home considering how terribly fattening it is.  However, this recipe is LowFat, LowCal, and LowCarb... amazing!

This was a delicious recipe.  I stuck with the recipe, substituting only light coconut milk for the regular variety (save a couple of calories) and omitted the red pepper because I didn't have it on hand.  I added a little cornstarch at the end, but I think I would leave this out next time - it was actually a little too thick.  BONUS SIDE DISH: I made a middle eastern coconut rice on the side (cooked the rice in half light coconut milk and water), then after cooking, added toasted coconut (toasted in a pan with a little olive oil), toasted almond and toasted raisins, all mixed through the rice (do all the toasting separately).  With the curry-coconut shrimp, it was absolutely delicious!

1/2 cup of coconut milk was not enough and I did NOT need to use the cornstartch.  If I had, then it would have been way too thick. This tasted good...just not made exactly as written.  UPDATE:  I made this tonight and the general consensus is there needs to be more sauce.  I used 2 tsp of sugar instead to suit our taste, hubby thought it was too spicy I thought it was just right.  Next time I will cut the red pepper and double the sauce.

This curry sauce is absolutely delicious and goes really well with the shrimp and brown rice. It's not too spicy but still has some kick. I'd love to try it with chicken and veggies. I'll omit or use less of the cornstarch next time, though; it made the sauce too thick.

Warning - if you're not a fan of either coconut or cilantro, pass this recipe by! Hubs fits into this category and rates this two stars! If these aren't your issues, however, read on.  This was a beautiful dish in terms of both presentation and flavor.  Seasoned just right in my judgment, so that no, one, spice dominates.  Quick and easy to prepare, this recipe really delivers.  I enjoyed it a lot! (Again, Hubs not so much)  I served this over jasmine rice with steamed baby bok choy and yellow patty pan squash.  A treat for both the eyes and the palate. Oh - and I didn't find it necessary to add any cornstarch!

I made this recipe last week and my husband looooved it. He's not a big fan of coconut, but he really enjoyed the sweet spicy taste. I give this recipe 4 stars because its easy to prepare and make. I used regular coconut milk instead of light and the sauce thickened without the need of cornstarch.

We enjoyed this dish!.. I doubled the curry because I love curry and the coconut milk; I used 1/4 tsp of cayenne instead of the red pepper flakes.  Other than that I followed the recipe and added just a squirt of lime juice at the end with salt and pepper.  Pretty good but I have other favorites!

Made this tonight and we loved it! I modified it to match aglika's review plus served it over basmati rice that I cooked with 1/2 light coconut milk and 1/2 water - then added toasted slivered almonds and coconut. So this is what I did...I mixed in my Vita Mix: 1/4 c canola oil, 1 medium onion, 1 red bell pepper and 5 cloves of garlic to create a paste. I then sauteed it for 4 min, lowered the heat to simmer and added 2 tsp minced ginger, 2 tbsp curry powder, 1 tsp ground cumin, 1 tsp sugar, 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes, mixing energetically for 2 min. I then gradually added 2 c of coconut milk all the while mixing energetically until the sauce thickened and became uniform. I simmered the sauce for 4 min, then increased the heat to medium-high again, added the shrimp and pre-cooked chunks of chicken, mixed well to coat and cooked for 4-5 min. Finally I added 1/2 c chopped fresh cilantro. I mixed one last time and turned off the heat. I served this with toppings options of toasted coconut, fresh coconut, and peanuts. YUM, YUM, YUM! Thank you Dakota and aglika and all the reviewers! This was quick and easy and will definitely be a favorite I will be serving to guests!

This was absolutely amazing! However I did have to change a few things.. Like the other reviewers, I added 2tlbs butter to the oil before saute the veggies (added 1 cup peas) and added 2 tlbs curry instead and 2 tlbs flour with the seasoning instead of cornstarch at the end. Also, I added about 3/4 can (14oz) of LITE coconut milk. Everyone went crazy over this! You might add a little more flour at the end when cooking the shrimp - it all depends.

way too bland- i was expecting a lot based on the reviews, but it was nothing like good thai take out unfortunately. After looking at other recipes - it seems that it needed tumeric, fish sauce, and ginger.

First, I will point out that this recipe is bang on to a recipe in the 2nd cookbook of Janet & Greta Podleski (Crazy Plates - 1999 - recipe is called On Golden Prawns).  I have all 3 of their cookbooks, which are fabulous!  Literally, the only change is that this recipe on AR calls for only 1/2 cup of coconut milk, while theirs calls for a cup, but many reviewers feel it needs a full cup, and I agree!!  All that said, this is a very good recipe with great flavour and easy to throw together!  I left out the cilantro at the end as we dislike it and I used more than 1/4 tsp of the pepper flakes.  I personally found the cornstarch (I didn't use the  full tablespoon) was required to thicken this somewhat, although depending on how 'saucy' you want the liquid, you may or may not want to use - some people did and some did not!

after making it the first time i realized it needed more flavor doubled all the spices and added tumeric, and didnt need to add the corn starch,. I also got creative and added alfredo sauce ommiting the coconut milk and sugar. I know it changes the whole recipe but it turned out great. this recipe would get 5 stars if you increase the spices especially the curry powder.

Came out delish but I followed the recipe losely. Added eggplant and I did not have peppers. Also, i added a lot of extra coconut milk (a whole can) as we like a lot of sauce. Adjusted spices accordingly. Also added tumeric. Overall, great dish! Will definitely repeat!

We really enjoyed this dish over some brown rice with a side of roasted cauliflower, broccoli and tomatoes. I  omitted the onions and red peppers ( my hubby's not a fan) and used madras and harissa pastes instead of curry powder. Very tasty.

This is very good.  I had a pound and a half of shrimp and doubled the recipe adding imitation lobster meat to make up for the half pound shrimp i was missing. I didn't quite follow the recipe and made it in a Wok instead of skillet, but it came out great.  I did however substitute flour for cornstarch, i wish i hadn't, the sauce was delicious before the addition of flour.  Next time i'll use the cornstarch.

This was good with the following changes: I added one whole cup of coconut milk, doubled the curry, added 1/2 tsp of ground ginger (will add fresh ginger next time) 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/4 tsp cumin seeds and topped with green onion, chives and a sprinkle of paprika. Had a good mild spice to it. I will make again and NOT use the corn starch and water mixture - made it too thick.

I give this recipe 4 stars as written, 5 stars with the changes I made. I left out red bell pepper because I didn't have any, but I doubled everything else (except sugar...I left it at 1 tsp). I also added more garlic and added minced ginger. I also used finely ground Indian red pepper and it's HOT - so I used 1/2 tsp. I did add the corn starch and wouldn't do it again. The thickness was fine before it was added but I did it anyway. I served over brown rice and it made plenty...definitely something new in our dinner recipe collection!

I found the taste pretty flat and pastey tasting, there was no salt or soy sauce in the recipe and I feel it could have used it. I don't think I would make it again.

Excellent with some minor revisions: I used 3 well seeded jalapenos instead of bell pepper. Still did the crushed pepper flakes and it was not hot - just a mild spice. Did not thicken the sauce, not necessary, it thickens enough if you just let it sit 5 min before serving. Used 2 cups light coconut milk, and for oil used 1/4 c ev coconut oil. Also added 3 sliced stalks celery and small can of bamboo (both excellent with it). Did fresh basil instead of cilantro - gave it an absolutely delicious Thai flare (don't used dried basil, only fresh, they're completely different flavors). Fry the shrimp first, set them aside and do the veggies with the sauce (celery will cook fast, nice to leave some crunch to it too). Add the shredded coconut, basil and shrimp to serve. SOOO good. The tsp sugar (and a pinch salt if you wish - salt increases detection of sweetness on tongue) are really crucial, it is not the same without it.

This  was ok. It needs more BAM! It didn't taste *bad* it just didn't wow us. I left out the red pepper simply because I was all out. I didn't need the cornstarch as the mixture was already thick (fine by me; I don't like adding it if I don't need it). Needs more *something* ... more curry, more coconut, some salt...something. I'll work with it and tweak it, though. It's a good base recipe.

It was good, tad too sweet for me. Next time i won't add so much sugar. I didn't use any cornstarch, I read the reviews and everyone was saying the cornstarch wasn't needed, so therefore I didn't use it. My husband didn't like it, he said it was too sweet as well.

I made this dish for my family and it was a great success.  It was perfectly sweet!  I made it a little spicier than this recipe by adding an Asian chili sauce.  I also added a tablespoon of curry sauce to the vegetables while they were frying in the beginning.  Half a cup of coconut milk wasn't quite enough, so I added a few tablespoons of water along with it.  My family ate every last bite of this, it was delicious!

This was delicious! I followed some of the reviewers suggestions, but this is a really nice recipe. I didn't have a bell pepper (my boyfriend doesn't like them) so I just added a bit of honey to replace the lost sweetness and substituted in frozen stir-fry veggies. We will definitely have this again!

Quick and easy and delicious! I altered the recipe a bit though. I rinsed the shrimp to remove any excess salt and omitted the salt the recipe called for. I used the entire can of regular unsweetened coconut milk and added a little more sugar. I used cayenne pepper and should have added more than I did 'cause I love heat! I omitted the cornstarch and added a bit of fresh-squeezed lemon juice at the very end. Not as sweet as you might think! YUM!

Great recipe, however I prefer a little more heat so I doubled the amount of curry in this recipe. I also added a little lemon juice and a small amount of butter in with the coconut milk, otherwise I followed the recipe as written. I made this for my father and his friend. It was gone in minutes. I recommend doubling this recipe because it will go that fast. I will definately be making this again in the near future.

I thought this recipe was mediocre. There was hardly any curry sauce with it and not enough spiciness. Also, it seemed like a lot of shrimp for the small amount of curry.

Overall very tasty!  My husband referred to it as "suburban curry."  Agree with previous reviews. I would triple the light coconut milk and double everything else.  The additions of brown rice, coconut flakes and raisins on top were also a nice addition. Next time I will add carrots and diced potatoes. Cornstarch not necessary. Enjoy!

Honestly, I am usually a good cook and follow recipes well (but I usually add my own ingredients when needed). But for whatever reason this recipe did not work out for me at all. I was very disappointed because everyone's reviews were so great and I have no idea what I did wrong. I had all the ingredients but I did not have the cornstarch, but I don't think that is what was missing. The taste was very bland, so my husband and I were trying to add more spices to it- and it just did not help at all. I could not even finish this dish it was so tasteless. I would like to make it again to see what I did wrong- because it smelled delicious- it just needed a kick. I may be wrong, but I am thinking that if you add a little ginger and lime it may help bring out some more flavor? Or chili peppers? I will read through the reviews again and add what people suggested next time!

I followed the advice of the first reviewer about making a paste in the blender and it worked really well.  Unfortunately, the flavors were a little bland.  I was surprised to see no salt in the original recipe (although I added some on my own accord).  My bf and I couldn't put my finger on what was missing.  I would recommend as others have maybe some ginger, lime, lemongrass, or something to cut through or balance out the coconut creaminess and the spice.

Will make again followed "aglika's" advice but may just try it as is next time too.  THE RESULT WAS HARDLY ENOUGH FOR 2 CURRY LOVERS!!! YUM, YUM, YUM! THANK YOU DAKOTA and all the reviewers! I also plan on making this with chicken and I will try peanuts instead of shredded coconut next time.

Easy to make but not very flavorful.  I think that I should have used a red curry paste like another one of the reviewers said they used because it would have been much better.

This is a 5 star recipe with similar changes to another reviewer. I made a paste out of the onions, red pepper, garlic, ginger and oil, sauteed the paste, added the spices and a TBSP of flour and cooked for a few more minutes stirring to blend. Added the coconut milk and simmered it until slightly thickened and added a bit of salt for flavour. Added the shrimp and the cilantro, removed from heat once the shrimp was cooked through and served it with brown rice linquine. Absolutely superb!! My hubby was a happy man.

This recipe was awesome! I changed a few things though. I omitted the cornstarch, water, and sugar. Then I used 2 cups (or 1 can) of lite coconut milk which made it more of a sauce and I doubled the seasonings. Also, it was great served over Jasmine rice. I will definitely make this again!

I followed AGLIKA's suggestions and made this.  I make alot of curries, and this one was easy since the ingredients are all things we don't have to run to the grocery store for.  I like my food spicy so I added a green chili, seeds and all to the blender. I also didn't measure my coconut milk, I just added 1 can.

Wow, was this ever good! Hard to believe that it's light (but you have to use the light coconut milk). To lighten it up further, I used olive oil spray rather than the oil; didn't miss it at all. A double bonus was how quick it was to put together. Some of the other reviewers said it needed a bit more heat (plus I like heat), so I added about a teaspoon of red curry paste to the vegetables and spices while they were sauteeing. I also added about a 1/4 teaspoon of salt, which really made the flavors pop (amazing what a little bit of salt does for that) and perhaps a tablespoon of minced fresh ginger. What it didn't need was the cornstarch, as mine thickened beautifully all on its own. I used jumbo shrimp (13-15 count) and served it over brown and red rice with wheat berries with roasted broccoli and onion wedges on the side, with a salad dressed with 1 tablespoon of marmalade (melted) with a splash of rice wine vinegar, to which I added a tad bit of chopped mint and freshly ground pepper; very fresh. Guess what...having it all again tonight!

Amazing sauce. It reminds me a bit of a curry we used to have in Sri Lanka. SO good! I followed what the other reviews said and made a roux by adding some butter and a tablespoon or so of flour to the onion and spices that were frying before adding the coconut milk and not using the cornstarch. It turned out great. I served it with Jasmine rice which was really tasty too.

The flavor was excellent, but I suggest using a 14 oz can of coconut milk and tripling the spices. There was not enough sauce for a pound of shrimp.

Yes, I used cooked shrimp rather than raw. Will use raw shrimp next time and will increase the recipe for the sauce by 50%. My husband loves lots of sauce with his curry.

I followed the recipe as posted, but increased spices to what reviewer aglika suggested.  Next time I will try using 1 TBL curry powder instead.  Overall, the recipe was very good, but with 2 TBL curry powder, the coconut and shrimp flavors were overpowered.  I also used a full can of coconut milk, and felt the quantity of sauce was just right.

Yummy! This was my very first time making curry, so I didn't really know what I was doing or how to judge a recipe for it. This was as good as what we get at the Indian buffet. With that being said, I did agree with other reviewers that it didn't make enough of the sauce, so I doubled for the sauce and threw in an extra teaspoon of curry in also. I didn't add the cornstarch either because I didn't have any and it turned out just fine.

This recipe turned out alright.  Omitted the cilantro (don't like) and the cornstarch - we felt the sauce was thick enough.  Bumped up some of the spices, but the recipe still felt a little bland/one dimensional.  It tasted a little better the next day but not enough to make again.

Delicious taste. I should have doubled the mixture though, or served it with some vegetable dishes. In my opinion, it didn't make nearly enough for four.

Needs more sugar, more heat, and some salt.  I added fresh pineapple and used regular coconut milk.  Calories from cornstarch or coconut milk....hmm, prefer coconut.  I used I cup of coconut milk, 1/2 low fat and 1/2 regular.  I added fresh ginger and fresh basil.  Also, I prefer veggies crisp, so I cooked veggies with shrimp!

Lovely!  I used roasted red peppers from a jar since that is what I had and followed the advice of others and doubled the sauce and cooked the rice in coconut  milk.  Next time I think I will try just a bit more red pepper flakes to kick it up a notch.

This recipe was easy to make. The coconut/curry flavour is wonderful. I doubled the recipe to make enough for a family of 4. I also found salt helped bring out the flavors. I will make this recipe the next time I'm in the mood for Thai food.

I made it with Salmon and also doubled the curry and coconut milk. My family loved it and thought it was comparable to our favorite Thai restaurant! Thanks!

As is, this recipe is a 3 star recipe. I realized this as I was cooking it, and ended up using an entire can of coconut milk because we like a lot of sauce for our rice. I didn't use light coconut milk, so the sauce was thick enough and didn't need cornstarch. However, since I made extra sauce, it definitely needed extra spices. Next time, I'll add much more garlic and this recipe needs salt. I'll definitely make this again, but with modifications.

Quick, easy and tastes good. I added a 3/4 cup of coconut milk instead of the 1/2 cup, and 1/2 tsp more of curry. I left out the cornstarch and water, sauce was thick enough!

It's a bit bland if you make it using only the ingredients listed. I added finely chopped fresh ginger, a dash of cinnamon, sea salt and freshly ground pepper and that helped make it more flavourful. I also used more coconut milk than the recipe called for. I wouldn't make this recipe again.

Not to bad,,,, i forgot the sugar which i think would be a nice touch. I like spicy food so i added a 1/2 jalapeno pepper and served it over Pad Thai noodles. I'll make this again..... yummy!

4 or 5 stars, couldn't decide. I used modifications that first reviewer suggested with a couple additions like tumeric and garam masala. I used 2 Tbl of ginger that comes in the tube and omitted the sugar, because it has sugar in it. I will definitely make this again.  garnishijavascript:__doPostBack('ctl00$ContentPlaceholder$edit$saveButton','')ng with lime next time to see how it is.

I followed aglika's modifications, but needed to add more sugar, salt and pepper, a pinch of coriander, a few shakes of garam masala, more cumin, and -most importantly- a few squirts of lime to finish it off just right.

Yummy! I made 2 versions, one with shrimp, the other with chicken, both were very tasty. I ended up increasing the coconut milk while I was cooking it. I used a hot curry powder which  gave the flavor a boost. I will add a little salt next time. Definately a new favorite.

I was a little disappointed in this recipe. I followed it exactly and there was not nearly enough sauce and what little sauce there was was very thick. I ended up adding more coconut milk to compensate and that helped some.

This recipe made a great curry! I think it is important to note that I did use a red curry paste, which included a variety of other ingredients (like salt), instead of using curry powder; this dish, followed exactly to the recipe's instructions, might not be as good as what I tasted.

Very good! I did not alter this recipe much at all and I found it to be very flavorful. I added a pinch of cayenne powder and a pinch of mustard seed, as well as about 1/3 cup of chickpeas (garbanzo beans). I used splenda instead of the sugar-- couldn't tell a difference.  I may have added a bit more coconut milk to thicken it up as well. It was my first time cooking anything curry- related and I was very impressed with how flavorful it was. I served it over a low-carb wheat tortilla.

I followed what the first reviewer suggested and it was great. I just added salt, and decreased the amount of coconut flakes at the end - using about 1/2 cup rather than 3/4 cup. Will definitely make it again. by the way, the cilantro looks and tastes great at the end so don't leave that out!!

I followed most of the modifications - generally I found it bland, even when I increased the spices, and let it reduce to increase concentration of flavour. Bland in comparison to  curries and similar dishes I've made myself before.

So if you don't really like hugely spiced curries this may be for you (spiced as in spices, not as in heat). But I was generally disappointed.

I followed aglika's suggestions to a tee and it turned out WONDERFUL!! She suggested putting coconut in at the end, but i found the flakes a tad fibrous and tough in such a creamy sauce. I will not put 3/4 cup of coconut in next time, maybe more like 1/4 cup if at all. The consistency was wonderfully creamy and the spices were spot-on. If you are looking for a different and taste-tingling way to cook shrimp, give this recipe a try

This dish was delicious. Like others, I made some modifications- chicken bullion, fresh minced ginger, and I omitted the coriander since I didn't have any on hand. Since I like sauce, I used the whole can of coconut milk. I served it over wild basmati rice. It was yuuuuuummmmmy!

Good basic recipe but I think the high ratings are coming from people's own tweaks to this recipe, and not the recipe itself. I used the recipe as a jump-off point as I realized as made it was not to our taste. We like it a bit sweeter, with a little salty and lots more curry. Used a whole can of coconut milk instead as the amount of shrimp (and we also used scallops too) wants it, especially if you want some over rice. We used extra red bell peppers, and some snow peas. I used 2 tbsp at least of curry, and probably about 3/4 tsp salt, and at least twice the sugar the recipe calls for.  With the tweaks it was delicious! My rating is for the recipe as is. As is, it was too quiet and bland without enough complexity.

While this recipe was ok at first so I made many modifications as it was quiet bland and the coconut milk was overpowering for us (these are all aprox not exact) I used 1 large clove garlic, 2 tsp cumin, 1 tbsp coriander, 2 tbsp curry powder, 1 cup coconut milk, 2 chili dried chili peppers (crushed), 1 tsp cayenne, 2 tsp sugar, 3/4 can of chicken broth. The chicken broth made a world of difference. I didn't add any sort of flour (yes it was thin, but we like it that way) or cornstarch and I added 1 zucchini, 1 sm potato, 1 sm onion, 2 carrots, and it was very tasty!

I skipped the whole last step of adding the water and cornstarch, and I think the sauce was delicious the way it was.

i tried this recipe once, and i liked it. but i did modify it because i didn't have red bell peppers - i used green bell peppers instead. and if i were to make this next tme, i won't add in cornstarch. something about cornstarch that makes the texture of the curry unpleasant.

This was great! Light and tasty, I served it over basmati rice and it was spiced nicely. I took some of the other reviewers' suggestions and added a little bit of margarine to the oil when stir-frying the veggies and added flour (not cornstarch) and water to the mix before pouring in the coconut milk.

I did as the first person said and substituted flour for corn starch.  Came out really spicy, but I used curry paste instead of powder.  Definately plan to make it again with a few more vegetables.

I too took the advice of the other reviewers and increased the curry, doubled the coconut milk (next time I will use the entire can) and made a roux before adding the milk.  It was WONDERFUL, my family enjoyed it, and our daughter's guest for dinner, who doesn't like shrimp, inhaled it!  If you don't mind the curry smell in your house for a few days, you have to try this one out!

Very Tasty Sauce. It was quick & easy outside of the fact that I had to squeeze my own coconut milk (no grocery shopping). I used parsley instead of cilantro (again no leaving the house) and added a bit more sugar in the end...as a matter of fact I added a bit more of all of the ingredients, but the concotion is great. Season it to your liking.

This recipe was absolutely amazing! My family just loved it.
I did keep the changes the others suggested.
1) Add some butter to the oil before frying.
2) Add 2 tbspn curry powder.
3) Add 2 Tbspn flour before adding the coconut milk.
4) Double the coconut milk.
5) Dont add CS + water.
6) Add salt to taste.

I made this today and it was a bit of a project!  I incorporated all the ingredients, varying amounts a bit; I.e., increased the curry powder to 2 Tbsps and the rest in the  recipe amounts. Used frozen raw shrimp which came out tender and tasty. But the whole dish was more sweet than I prefer and otherwise  not much flavor..,, Slightly more taste with some added salt, I am not sure what else might be added . A bit of lime juice also helped. I kept wondering whether a !title cocktail sauce may help next time, but didn't have any to try. Suggestions? It is not more hot spice that was needed but something to deepen the flavors. Judi David

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except used green beans instead of red pepper and dried oregano instead of coriander. I don’t think it needed the cornstarch mixture, as it was thick already.

I read the previous reviews and did a bit of change up because people were saying that it was not flavorful enough. I doubled up on the garlic and chopped two big cloves. I used regular coconut milk instead of the light and it was thick enough to omit the water and cornstarch mixture. I added about 1 tsp of turmeric (which really does not have a lot of taste) and used about 1/2 tsp more each of the coriander, cumin and curry powder. I used a Malaysian ginger curry or I would have added some ginger too. Next time, I might add 1/2 - 1 tsp of ginger in addition to the ginger curry. I also added about 1/4 tsp of   my favorite pepper blend (Pirate's Bite from the Spice and Tea Exchange). The result was absolutely fabulous. I am definitely going to make this again and again.

I didn’t have coconut milk so I put in some Soy protein non-dairy and added unsweetened coconut flakes. I also substituted Stevia instead of using white sugar. I am definitely doing this again. I served it on a bed of left-over flavoured basmati rice I had made. I also didn’t have red pepper flakes. It was delicious

So good and really quick to make. I think it took about 15 minutes (excluding 45 minutes for the brown rice)! I actually used the full can of coconut milk, and added a bit more red pepper (ground, not flakes).  I didn't have coriander so I skipped it. It tasted like a restaurant meal.  My house smelled like curry all night though, which was the only downside. Would absolutely add into regular rotation.

Yummy!!! Did double it for more sauce, and ended up adding about 1 cup chicken stock which gave an ample amount sauce for pouring over rice(try the curry rice recipe on this website-awesome!!), and extra curry-because I cannot get enough curry!!  Thank you for this yummy recipe!!!

This "Curry-Coconut Shrimp" was quite good, and completely changed my idea of what a delicious curry is supposed to taste like. I didn't have my usual Thai Red Curry paste in the cupboard, so I decided to follow this recipe, and used a homemade Indian-style curry powder. Based on other reviews stating that there wasn't enough sauce, I doubled up on the spices and coconut milk so that there would be more sauce, but it was completely unnecessary. My dish had so much sauce that it looked quite soupy, but the sauce was so delicious that I didn't mind eating my main course as a soup. I left out the cornstarch since my coconut milk was naturally thick. I can imagine that this dish could have so many delicious variations depending on the curry powder used to make it. Thank you dakota kelly for sharing your recipe.

I made it as written and it was easy to make and was fine.  I agree that it needs a full cup of coconut milk and a dose of fish sauce.  Also, using medium or small shrimp would be better and cheaper.  Its a solid weekday recipe, easily scalable for however many people will be home for dinner.

Aglika's suggestion made this dish awesome and I basically used that recipe in place of this one.

Delish! Served it over a bed or rice noodles. However, it didn't seem like there was enough sauce with using only 1/2 cup of coconut milk.  I added the whole can plus 1/2 cup of water.  Unfortunately for my husband, though, it was a bit spicy (I'm not complaining).  No big deal - he just topped it with some sour cream.  ;)

I made this about a month ago.  It was my first attempt @ making this dish after having an excellent restaurant version.  I, as others did, doubled the coconut milk and added more curry.  However, this is a great base recipe and I can't wait to make it again for myself...BF won't eat curry.  A great base!! Thanks!

I love thai food, and I was excited to try this recipe, I followed all of 'aglika's recommendations exactly as stated and was thinking it's going to yield a great result, this tasted nothing like I've had at good thai restaurants, I didn't enjoy it, I can't even explain why the sauce tasted off, but the combination of the flavours just didn't taste right.  I will not make it again.

This is soooo good!  Cures a curry craving.  I made the changes suggested earlier about adding extra coconut milk and added some grated coconut to the finished product.  YUM.

After reading all the reviews, I decided to follow the Aglika's custom version from Nov. 6, 2004, basically because there was more spices and coconut milk, which gives the rice a nice sauce. It has the same ingredients but in varied amounts. We couldn't get enough! Thanks for the recipe and the variations. :)

I followed aglika's suggestions, and it was delish! One thing: instead of coconut milk, I used creamed (solid) coconut and melted it into milk. This way I could make it as thick as I wanted (by adding more coconut) without using flour or cornstarch.  works perfectly :)

Made exactly as directed the first time. Was very good, no complaints. Second time I made it I didn't have shrimp so I used chicken. Didn't have red pepper either. But I added some tomato paste and was still very good.

This could have been 4 stars perhaps had I not added the corn starch and added something to make the shrimp spicier.

This recipe was good, although I changed a few things about it.  I did the recipe just as it was, and it was a little tasteless.  I added some chicken bouillon, and red thai curry paste as well.  I also added a squeeze of lemon.  I will keep the recipe and also add the extra ingredients as well.

Um, just ok from a curry-lover...I used a whole can of coconut milk so I wouldn't waste any. I think it was the texture of the shrimp that threw us off. We much prefer the chicken curry on this website, texture-wise.

The sauce is great and would probably be good with chicken too.  I usually add a little extra coconut milk and salt.

I was not a huge fan of this as I thought it was a little too thick and I could taste the "grit" almost of the curry.  I think i was expecting something a bit sweet. I did add sugar to this after trying it and that helped.  My roomate did enjoy it (after the sugar was added).

Really healthy, really fast, really tasty!!  This recipe can easily be modified to personal tastes (as many commenters have), but the base is good on its own.  I usually add a bit of fresh ground peanut butter and some raisins myself

I love the recipe reviews and always use the advice given:  I used 1 cup of coconut milk but skipped adding the sugar, and used 1 tsp each of the spices.  This was fabulous with the Reisling wine as recommended.

Nice, quick , and easy! My very picky father even liked it!  I used a whole can of coconut milk so there would be more sauce for the rice I served it over, so I increased the spices to taste.

I loved this, and my finicky teen-age boys even scraped their plates. (Can't get much better endorsement than that!) I didn't have red pepper, so I used a green pepper I had. Also, served with cups of peanuts and coconut at the table, as offered with Indian fare. Will definitely make again. I tried using one reviewer's suggestion to make a roux at the beginning using flour and butter, but that didn't work out well for me. It was too thick, and then I was adding more coconut milk to try to thin it out again. I think if served over rice, the coconut curry sauce is just the right consistency -- without flour or cornstarch imho.

This was delicious and I didn't make a single change to the recipe.  Next time I will make it a little spicier though.

Wow! This was great! Much better than the recipe I had been using. I added more curry & red bell pepper. I didn't use the cornstarch or flour to thicken the sauce, but next time I will as I want to use a little more coconut milk. I will surely be making this again!! Thanks!!

My family loved the concept of this meal, I made fried cabbage, brown rice and sweet cornbread with it and my husband and I declared next time I make this meal use brown suger instead of white other than that they said it reminded them of a west indies dish and everything else was great.

I cooked this for my mom and dad and they said it was the best dinner they had ever eaten.  I would say add more curry (I went in with about 1 and one half tablespoons) and a little less cornstarch unless you want it really creamy.  I would tell anyone to cook this... it is easy and delicious.

This recipe was a total disappointment. I followed the directions exactly but it came out much too sweet and very bland. I had to had a tbsp of green thai curry paste to salvage things. 

Bust.

This was very bland.  I tried to salt it and add Tandoori curry at the end to give it some flavor, but it still is very bland.  I think it might taste better tomorrow after the seasonings have marinated.  I think if I tried this next time, I might marinate the shrimp.

We really liked the combination of spices in this recipe. However, in my ignorance I used coconut CREAM and not coconut milk. This made the curry sauce much too sweet. To speed up the preparation of the sauce, I pre-measured all the spices and chopped everything up front, just as if I were on a cooking show. This made a potentially labor-intensive process a fairly simple procedure. I will try this again, next time using a little more red pepper and using the correct coconut ingredients.

This is really yummy!!  This is very close to a dish I had at Chino Latino in Minneapolis.  I add some chuncks pineapple and the juice in before I add the shrimp to add in some extra flavor.

I thought this was missing something, but I couldn't put my finger on it. The cornstarch gave it an odd texture. Rather than work on modifications I will try other recipes.

This was delicious! I made it exactly as aglick suggested. I even trippled it for my large family and used frozen shrimp for ease. I have just begun reading Elephant Walk and this inspired me to try making shrimp curry and to drink a whisky and soda (drank while preparing curry). This recipe lived up to my imaginings and transported me to Ceylon.

aglika's review is RIGHT ON!  I followed that to a tee and it is divine.  Hot Hot Hot, so not for the faint hearted, but if you love curried dishes, it's oh so good.  Thank you for posting and thank you, aglika, for your excellent revisions.

Be sure not to chop vegies up too much - makes too much liquid.  If you use two large strainers, places minced vegies in one then use the other on top to squeeze extra liquid out, very helpful.

I LOVED this sauce but did not enjoy the shrimp in it.  So, the second time I made this, I replaced the shrimp with a can of drained & rinsed chick peas.  It was delicious!  The next time I make it, I will increase the coconut milk a bit.  Also, I serve this over Jasmine rice.

This was just okay, hence 3 stars.  I didn't add the peppers as they give me reflux (I am pregnant again) I doubled the milk and curry , I substituted the coconut milk with 1 cup evaporated milk and 1 teaspoon coconut essence it cuts the fat to just 6 grams (a quarter of an ounce) I added frozen peas to sweeten it a little, it was quite bitter and salty.  Not fantastic, but definatley easy.

This recipe was great with a few changes.  I omitted the corn starch and made a roux as the other review stated. I also doubled the coconut milk, used 2 tbsps curry, and added one cup frozen peas.  Perfect with some good naan!
