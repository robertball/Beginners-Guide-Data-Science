crowd pleaser. everyone always begs for these but i recommend the following:

1. don't use double stuf oreos (they fall apart, it's messy, just don't try it)

2. you can subsitute almond bark for the outer coating, it's delicious.

3. the chocolate outer coating is really really hard to put on the oreo balls so first make sure that you CHILL the balls. then melt the chocolate on low heat or microwave and my method of dipping (so that the balls wouldn't fall apart and get the chocolate all dirty) was to take two spoons and kind of roll it around / spoon chocolate onto the ball.  

(that's because the toothpick into an oreo ball sometimes causes the entire thing to fall apart)

I have been making these Oreo Truffles for years, and have used all different flavors of sandwich cookies...from Nutter Butter to Coffee & Cream Oreos. Each is delicious.  My favorite batch is the one where I add crushed BUTTERFINGER to the Peanutbutter Oreo cookie mixture.  I use about 2-3 regular sized candy bars to 1 pkg Oreos.  There are so many options with this recipe...

Good recipe - easy to follow and ingredients are non-threatening/easy to find.

A word to the wise.  I'm not great with baking that requires complete attention.  This does!  The part where you cover you Oreo "meatball" in chocolate.  

A few hints: as you melt the chocolate, stir constantly and stop as soon as all of the stuff is melted - even a smidge before you think it's totally done.  Use a slotted spoon and drop the cookie in and pour the chocolate over it.  Move quickly or else the chocolate cools and it's like walking in quicksand.

The toothpick thing didn't work for me and was discouraging in the beginning - despite chilling the stuff it didn't stay together and "muddied" the chocolate. The spoon method was much, much better.

Excellent!  I followed the advice to crush cookies in the processor AND then add the cream cheese via the same way.  You'll know it's well blended when the whole cookie mixture turns into a big blob...it won't be crumbly at all.  I also chilled the dough for about 15 min before rolling.  I then chilled the balls (in the freezer) for about 10 min while I melted the chocolate.  I dipped 1/2 the batch at at time & then melted the remaining 1/2 of chocolate for the 2nd tray of balls.  YUMMY.

I got this recipe for "Oreo Balls" at my cooking club cookie exchange last year and have had HUGE success with them. I made them for my hubby's company picnic and they were so well received that I had people actually asking if they could pay me to make them for their families for the holidays!  The recipe I have is the same as this except it calls for refrigerating the scooped balls for 1 hour before dippings, and also calls for dipping half of them in milk chocolate and half in white chocolate, then drizzling the opposite flavor over the top. (a slotted spoon works really well for both dipping and drizzling) An A+ recipe for sure!

These are great - and a hit at the party!  Really easy to make - I think the dipping worked well with using a teaspoon and fork - resting the truffle on the fork and using the spoon to pour the chocolate over.  I think the trick is to try and handle the truffle as little as possible and trying to keep them at the tip of the fork so that you can slide the fork out without having to touch the truffle when putting it back on the wax paper.  Chilling them for at least an hour helped (I think mine chilled for a little longer than an hour) and I kept them on wax paper on a metal cookie sheet to help keep them cool while I was dipping.  My next ones I'll try with a different cookie - probably nutter butters since after telling guests about this version, I got requests to make them next time with the peanut butter cookies!  I got many compliments so definitely making again :)
They are rich, so you can't have too many of these at one time - but maybe that's a good thing!

These guys are awsome, and great for x-mas gifts. To make the chocolate coating look really gourmet, melt 18 oz of semi-sweet chocolate chips or baking squares with 2 oz of paraffin wax(I use gulf wax found in canning section) and coat as specified in this recipe.  I used a whole package of double stuff mint oreos and they were awesome.  My husband went crazy over them.  Next I will try nutter butter cookies.

Love these!!! They were the hit of Christmas!!! All gone at the end of the day and everyone wanted the recipe!  I drizzled white chocolate on the top instead of sprinkling the cookie crumbs on top. They looked fab!!! A HINT: I rolled the balls of cookie and put in the fridge - this firmed them up a bit, then I dipped them in the melted chocolate. (I also used a "double boiler" it works better on the chocolate IMHO). I am going to try peanut butter cookies and a dark chocolate or maybe even a mint cookie. The possiblilities are endless!!! Enjoy

These are awesome, and I'm not even a big fan of oreos.  Two tips:  Add 1-2 tablespoons of crisco to your dipping chocolate as you melt it.  The taste will not change, and it helps to liquify the chocolate so it's much easier to dip the balls in.  To dip the balls - break the two middle prongs of a plastic fork and use the fork to remove balls from the melted chocolate.  It's much easier to help remove the extra chocolate using it.  Make sure you allow your balls to set a little in the fridge/freezer before dipping, as others have recommended.  I love using milk choc. chips and white chips.  I dip some in the milk choc. and some in the white, then drizzle the opposite on top.  They really make a nice presentation together on a plate.

I found just breaking up the Oreos and then using my stand mixer to mix with the cream cheese worked very well.  In fact, it adds an extra crunch if you eat them soon after mixing and before the cream cheese has had a chance to moisten the Oreos.  When forming the truffles, I use a 1-inch scoop and then wear disposable gloves to form the truffles so the "dough" doesn't stick to my hands.  Then pierce each truffle with a toothpick and freeze for a few hours.  Remove the truffles a few at a time to dip into melted chocolate.  Because the truffles are frozen, the chocolate adheres quickly.  After truffles are coated with chocolate just remove the toothpicks (twist the toothpick and it will just pop out).  I then add a dollop of chocolate to fill in the hole.  Also, remember to add a tablespoon of Crisco to the chocolate to make a better consistency for dipping and it doesn't alter the taste.

Unless you plan on serving them directly from the refridgerator, then skip these all together.  Just 5 minutes on the table warms these up making them really gross inside and practically in-edible

A few hints for those unsure... 1. Refrigerate the oreo 'dough' for 1 hour before making them into balls.  It will make the rolling so much easier!  2. I stacked my balls on a paper plate, and then froze them for about 15-20 minutes.  I found that freezing the balls before putting them in scorching hot chocolate made them much easier to handle.  3. Follow the directions on the Bakers chocolate box.  Microwave for 30 seconds on high, then stir, then another 30 seconds plus 10 seconds for each additional square of chocolate you heat up.  Worked perfectly every time, and the people at work are raving about them!

These are fabulous and so easy to make! I made two batches to take to my niece's 11th birthday party this weekend one with oreos and one with nutter butters.  (I couldn't resist sampling one of each.) I definitely recommend a food processor to crush the cookies into fine crumbs - it took no time at all. Also, the slotted spoon method of dipping the truffles AFTER they are CHILLED for at least an hour is a great idea.  To set the chocolate I put the truffles on wax paper and put them in them in the frezzer for a couple of minutes.  This is definitely one for future parties and Christmas.

Really good! I didn't find these much more trouble to make than, say little meatballs. I did refrigerate the dough before making the balls and before coating them with chocolate, and that worked well. Using about 2/3 of a tablespoon each, I ended up with 42 balls. I melted the chocolate in a stainless bowl over simmering water, then turned the heat way down to the lowest setting and left the bowl in place. Drop a ball into the chocolate, flip it with a fork, then use the fork to fish it out. Use a small offset spatula to scrape the excess chocolate from the bottom of the fork then roll the ball onto waxed paper. It took 9 1-ounce squares of chocolate and there was less than 2 tablespoons remaining. I dusted half of them with ground up cookies per the recipe. On the other half, I did white chocolate squiggles. Sister dropped by, "tested" one...then absconded with half of them! They will be going (or so she says) to the quilting class at the local sewing store tomorrow! BTW, the package of Oreos was 1 pound 2 ounces (18 ounces), containing exactly the correct number of cookies (9+36). Glad I didn't eat a couple thinking I would have plenty left for the recipe! All in all, these are well worth the couple hours needed to put them together. The half of the recipe I have left will easily last here for a week or so. I'll try adding a little instant coffee (a tbsp to start) or a couple tbsp of maraschino cherry juice. And I'll try them with the mint or peanut butter cookies as well!

OH MY GOODNESS! I wish I had discovered this sooner. This is SO GOOD, words can't describe. I made 24 balls half white chocolate and the other half with milk chocolate. You must put the balls in the fridge so they can harden before coating them in chocolate. I used toothpicks and I had no problem, I just threw the ball in there and used a spoon to drizzle chocolate all over. I also made some in mini muffin paper cups, I put chocolate first and let it dry, then I put oreo mixture and more chocolate on top. They look just like reese's but instead of peanut butter its a delicious creamy oreo center. I will DEFINATELY be making this again.Totally try it you WONT be dissapointed!

One of my (and my family's) most favorite treats. We absolutely love these frozen. This is great for Halloween (using white baking chocolate in place of the semi-sweet) to make "eyes" or for Christmas cookie platters. These never fail to disappear soon after you make them. This works with any combination of Oreos (or even Nutter Butters!) and baking chocolate. NOTE: It's much easier if you crush your cookies in your food processor, then add your softened cream cheese. It really saves you an added step and a whole lot of mess in the long run. Also, if you chill your truffles for an hour before you dip them in the melted chocolate, they'll coat a lot easier without getting tacky.

I've made these several times now, and I've got it mastered!

Here are my tips:
1) Use a blender or food processor to get your cookies really fine.  It keeps them from crumbling in the chocolate.
2) As soon as you've mixed in the cream cheese, make the balls and put them in the freezer for 30-45 minutes.
3) Use a fondue pot for your chocolate! It keeps the chocolate at the PERFECT temperature without ever having to worry about it burning or having to constantly stir it. 
4) The mint oreos are AMAZING! My favorite variety. Don't use double-stuff, yuck! I also tried Nutter Butters, but they weren't as good as expected. They lost the peanut buttery flavor, so if I tried those again I would reduce cream cheese and add some Jif. 
Good luck!

drizzled these with white chocolate. simply awesome and irresistable - extremely rich but soo delicious! I have acually been offered money to make these! for a helpful hint - i used my crockpot to melt the chocolate - set on warm. checking on and stirring every so often. it took a few hours to completely melt - start it in the mornin when you grab your cup of joe/or the night before. it kept all day until i was able to get to it. :)

My cousin made these for her children's birthday about a year ago and I fell in love with it. I've since made this recipe a few times and it is always a crowd pleaser.  I crushed the cookies and mixed the cream cheese in by hand in the past (what a pain!) - this time I used my Ninja food processor. Hello why didn't I do this before? It literally took all of 1 minute.  My food processor crushed the cookies into the texture of graham cracker crumbs (unlike when I was doing it by hand in the past) and I added the softened cream cheese to my processor until it all clumped together into a large blob. Then I used my cookie scoop to measure out uniform truffles. I usually freeze them for a few hours or overnight THEN proceed with coating them in chocolate. The truffles keep their shape and the chocolate hardens quickly. They do defrost quickly once removed from the freezer but not quick enough to make a mess while I'm dipping them in chocolate.  When I'm done, I just refrigerate until ready to serve.

These are amazing!!  I made them as a trial run for a women's dessert I'm going to in December and I had to give some of them away to a friend...otherwise I would eat them all!!  I refrigerated the rolled balls for two hours before dipping in the chocolate.  I dropped them into the melted chocolate, rolled them around gently with a fork and lifted them out with the fork.  I had no problems with them falling apart at all.  I look forward to trying other variations like Nutter Butters or adding crushed Butterfingers as other reviewers suggested!

So easy and so yummy!  Not just good for parties, but these will make incredible gifts for anyone.  The only thing I did that wasn't in the recipe was I chilled the cookies before I crushed them and then i chilled the cookie/cream cheese balls before I dipped them in the chocolate.  It made the whole process much easier to work with and less messy.  My truffle balls did not fall apart.

After reading the fab reviews and loving Oreos, I thought I would add this recipe to my Christmas trays. Personally, I thought they tasted like gooey oreos and were not very appealing in texture. I should preface this by saying that I usually make hand dipped truffles with good quality chocolate. This just had a cookie dough consistency that does not appeal to me. I will throw a couple on my trays and whip up some "real" truffles. I wish I would have just hand dipped the whole oreos for a more pleasing outcome.

I have made these for a few yrs now for the holidays and everyone loves them, i recently lost the recipe and was happy someone had put it in here.  I have found if you chill the balls first they coat easier without becoming soft as fast.  IInstead of a fork for dipping,  I let them chill and then use a toothpick inserted to dip and use another to push off onto wax paper.  You can easily go back and "swirl" the chocolate where the hole was left giving it a professional look. I have  also used mint chocolate chips and/or the mint oreos, for a different flavor.  It is a recipe you can easily play around with  to provide a variety without digging up several different recipes to do so.

delicious and simple to make. As I was reading through the reviews, one person said that double stuff oreos won't work because it is too gooey. I was disappointed when I realized that I accidentally bought double stuff. Since I was bored, and wanted to make them, I added 1/2 block of cream cheese instead of the whole thing...this compensated for the extra filling from the cookies, and it had the right consistency! So, if anyone wants to make them but onlyhas double stuffed, just 1/2 the cream cheese and you are good to go!

People think I spent tons of time making these but they were so easy and absolutely fantastic. I did have wonderful luck using the slotted spoon trick that other reviewers have used. Much easier than trying to dip each with skewers or two spoons. Using vanilla oreos and strawberry cream cheese is also a huge hit.

I've been making these for several years now.  I call them Oreo balls.  I also make them with the Mint, Peanut Butter and Golden Oreos as well and they are always a hit!  Definately chill them before coating in chocolate.

This was so easy to make you can make it with your kids!  Only thing I would change is: Don't dip them in the chocolate, put them on the tray and spoon drop melted chocolate on top.  Much easier that way.  These were a big hit and I passed this recipe onto many friends and relatives.

I actually blend a whole bag of oreos with one package of cream cheese and then flash freeze for 30 minutes.  Then I melt chocolate bark in the microwave and dip the balls in and then put them back in the freezer.  I like them frozen better.

These are incredibly sweet. I made them into cake pops and covered with white chocolate. They taste better the next day, though. The flavours mellowed out and weren't so insanely rich. The white chocolate covering then makes them more moist inside, all creamy and dark.

This was a huge hit during Thanksgiving dinner so I made a few batches for Christmas dinner and presents.  Instead of using an 8 oz. package of cream cheese I used a 12 oz. tub of whipped cream cheese, in addition  I added 4 drops of pure vanilla extract and 1 tablespoon of milk with the whipped cream mix.  Instead of using baker's baking chocolate I used hardening chocolate for ice cream, it was alot easier to cover the Oreo balls that I individually laid on mini cupcake holders.  I made different variations and decorations on each batch for a nice arrangement of truffles.

Highly addicting!! These balls have been a huge hit everywhere I've taken them.  I used a food processor to crush the Oreos (some people told me they didn't get the Oreos fine enough and they didn't taste quite as good), and place them in the refrigerator overnight to firm before I coat them in chocolate.  I've also tried the mint Oreos and they turned out really good too.  Make a double order-they won't last long!

I have been making these little morsels for several years now. I dip them in white chocolate or almond bark and then sprinkle them with colored sugar, decorative morsels, or drizzle chocolate on top.  These are quick to make and absolutely yummy! My children love them.

We had a Christmas party at work last year and one of the girls made this recipe.  She called it "reindeer balls".  It was a huge hit with everyone at the office.  The recipe was passed out to just about everyone.  I made them for our family Christmas party a couple of days later and they too LOVED them.  You can get creative with them -  try using different flavored Oreos, like mint or peanut butter, use melting chocolates and try different colors!  They are simply amazing.

I used this recipe and dipped oreo balls into vanilla almond bark.  Delicious!  To decorate I just used food coloring on the remaining almond bark and drizzled it over the balls with a spoon.  Great for baby showers drizzle pink for a girl and blue for a boy.

I have made these for years.  I prefer white Ghiradelli chips melted with about 1 tablespoon shortening to thin it.  Also I got a great idea from another dipped recipe.  Use an egg seperator to dip the ball in chocolate.  Excess chocolate runs through the slots.  Works great!!

AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!!! This has to be one of the very best recipes i have ever done! We loved them except hubby, he doesnt care for chocolate. I think im going to be making these for Christmas in a few weeks and going to double the recipe, the only problem I really had was dipping the balls into the chocolate. Heres what I did, I took each cookie apart and put the filling in another bowl so that way when I crushed the cookies up they wouldnt get sticky from the filling, then i put the cookies on wax paper, then covered with another sheet and used a glass to crush, took a few minutes, then I put the crumbs in a bowl with the room temp. cream cheese and cookie filling, mixed real well then shaped into little balls and put on a cookiesheet lined with the paper and refrigerated for about an hour then took them out and dipped in the melted choc. it got kinda messy ay this point, Turns out i ended up using chopsticks to dip them in, a few of the balls tried falling apart, but nothing major, after all were dipped, placed them back in the fridge where they now sit with hardened chocolate and ooohh so DELICIOUS!!! Thank you!!

It is DELICIOUS! My boyfriend LOVE this oreo truffle. If you switch to 1/3 less fat cream cheese, it is much easier to dip in chocolate because it holds much better. I usually use a skewer(those wooden BBQ sticks) to dip my chocolate, and it is great.

Froze the balls before dipping in chocolate.  I used some with nestle mint choc chips and they were spectacular.  Used crumbled oreo to cover where i lifted out of chocolate.  Used electric fondue pot for melting chocolate for easier melting.

Made with Newman's Ginger-O's and candied orange peels and tofu cream cheese...added 1/2 c chopped orange peels to the 'oreo' cream cheese mixture and topped with candied peels instead of crushed cookies, which ment more truffels...

These things are easy and taste great.  When I dipped the balls in chocolate they feel apart.  To fix that problem I put the balls in the Freezer for about an hour.  Then I dipped the frozen balls in Chocolate and had no problem at all.  Make sure that you have some milk handy or you'll be running to the store after trying one of these.  Thanks for all the people that have reviewed this recipe.

Amazing!  I used semi-sweet chocolate chips melted in the microwave.  Worked great, just rolled balls with fork and let extra drip off.  Then I rolled some in nuts or crushed toffee candy.  I might make these every year.

I made these and everyone loved them.  I also made a batch with peanut butter in place of cream cheese and they were even more delicious!  Be warned, though: The minute you stick the peanut butter and oreo balls in the melted chocolate, they start melting, so they make delicious truffles, but they're not exactly round.  They're sort of flat, but even yummier than the originals, IMO.

I melt a little white chocolate and cut the corner of a ziploc to squeeze in stripes on the tops after the truffles are finished. Also, before dipping in chocolate, refrigerate the balls for about 20 mintues so they don't stick and fall apart once you put them in the hot chocolate.

Super easy.  I much prefer these covered in white chocolate. I melted 6oz Bakers white. Instead of rolling & dipping the balls, I drizzled the whitle chocolate over the balls after they were chilled on wax paper.  Not only did they look beautiful but doing it this way was a fast and easy way to complete the job. Drizzling also left the ball with a great taste - not overly sweet.

I just finished this recipe and I must say, I have to re~do my truffles because the recipe did not say; chill the cream cheese and oreo mixture before dipping it in the choc. I dont bake or make things like this but good thing I got 2 of everything at the store. There is no way that I can serve these ugly truffles...so a re~do is a MUST.

I made two batches of these truffles. One batch used cream cheese and the other used neufchatel (the lower fat version of cream cheese). I had an awful time trying to coat the batch that used the cream cheese; the truffles fell apart when they hit the chocolate even after they spent the night in the freezer. The batch that had the neufchatel in it stayed together beautifully! I had no trouble coating them in the melted chocolate and they ended up looking like something from a fine chocolatier. Both batches were DELICIOUS, but for the added ease of coating, I would suggest using neufchatel instead of regular cream cheese.

I make these but use white almond bark instead of the chocolate coating. With almond bark flavors you can change it up a bit and even add food coloring to the almond bark if you want to really decorate for whatever you are celebrating.

These are always a favorite when I make them for parties.  I use half milk chocolate chips and half semi sweet.

Delicious!  Easy, but a little bit time consuming to make.  I found the easiest way to coat the truffles in chocolate was to: 
1. Rest a truffle on top of 2  skewers (the type you would use for kabobs) with one hand (sort of like balancing a truffle on chopsticks).
2. With a spoon, pour the melted chocolate over the truffle (with the excess falling right back into the pot of melted chocolate)
3. Use both hands (one skewer in each) to lay the truffle on wax or parchment paper.

These were great.  If I hadn't eaten one 2 before I took them to a party I wouldn't have gotten one because they were gone in about 10 minutes!  I did learn that you can't dye white chocolate with regular food coloring so don't try that.

Excellent! You MUST freeze/chill them for maybe 1 hour before dipping, it makes it really easy to coat. Flavor is great but I'm thinking maybe adding some almond extract for more depth in flavor...

Tips- Freeze the truffles after rolling them into balls for about 45 minutes until they are firm. This makes it much easier to dip in chocolate. Then, instead of using semi sweet chocolate, try using white chocolate. It tastes much better that way. Also, you could try a mint version, using mint chocolate cookies and half of the mint filling and follow the recipe from there. Keep the chocolate-dipped truffles in the freezer until serving time. If you don't want to dip them in chocolate, you could sandwich one in between two square "snaps" pretzels and they are also good.

These were easy to make and a big hit at a church reception.I left out the 9 cookies to crush for crumbs and drizzled white chocolate over the tops instead. My dough yielded 40 balls.

Really Good and incredibly  easy. I just used my fingers when i rolled it in chocolate, it was messy but really easy. i also put them in the freezer for like 5 minutes after I finished rolling them in chocolate and they hardened supper quick. Also I used a blender for crushing up the oreos, first I crushed them with a rolling pin then put them in small batches into the blender.  Word to wise I also only got like 30 truffles instead of 42. The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because I felt they were overhyped( by my friends, family, etc);I excepted something out of this world and these just didn't quite do that plus I enjoy real truffles a whole lot better. These were still really good though:)

These were very easy, and so good!  I crushed the oreos in my small food processor, and then mixed them with the cream cheese with my hands.  After rolling them into balls, I froze them on the wax paper covered cookie sheet for a couple of hours.  I used the two toothpick method  for dipping in chocolate, and I dipped half of the batch in white chocolate and the other half in semisweet chocolate.  Then I put the excess chocolates in a ziploc bag, snipped off a corner of the bag and piped white chocolate drizzles on the chocolate covered truffles, and chocolate drizzles on the white chocolate covered truffles.  They were beautiful, and everyone thought I had bought them from a bakery!  They were a hit at the New Year's Eve party!  Thanks for an easy and delicious recipe!

Although I kept my Truffles in the fridge for 24 hours before dipping they fell apart and the almond bark just would not stick to the balls.  They were very unattractive so I just kept them for my family to eat...which they did happily.

Most decadent yummy crowd pleaser.  One thing I found frustrating was the chocolate cooling to quickly when trying to coat. So I melted chocolate in pyrex bowl and placed it in a med saucepan that had boiling water in it. Then the chocolate stayed warm enough to work with. Made coating much easier.

These never fail at a party! Sometimes when I'm lazy I just drizzle the chocolate on top - when I feel fancy I dip the balls in dark chocolate and drizzle white chocolate to give the Oreo look.  It makes it easier to combine if you pop the cream cheese in the microwave for a few seconds

Have had the ingredients for days and just got around to making these!  Mixed the cream cheese with the Oreos wit the cream cheese in the food processore as suggested.  Woudl definately have all the balls rolled and chilled prior to dipping in the chocolate next time. They taste like truffles from a guormet chocolate shop!

Really delicious!!! I also made some with Nutter Butter cookies instead of Oreo's and my family went crazy over them. And then I also made some with mint Oreo's. I think they add more cream filling to the Mint Oreo's so I added some Girl Scout mint cookies to the mixture because they were too mushy without them and they were wonderful!!! I also added about a half cup of the mint chocolate chips to the baking chocolate for the mint truffles - fantastic! A big family hit and a new yearly tradition to make. Thank you!!!

Always a hit! I crush my cookies in plastic freezer bags using a non-metal meat tenderizer mallet (double bagging the cookies before crushing).  I use 32 Oreos for the "filling" and only 3 for the "sprinkles". The Kraft website directions calls for 3 cups of cookies for the filling and that's what 32 Oreos yields for me. I usually dip mine in white chocolate using the 2 fork method of rolling and picking up and it's the best method I've found so far. I've also dipped these in melted milk chocolate/peanut butter chips, but thought the covering overpowered the Oreo taste (even though my friends inhaled them and said they were awesome). I've also made these using Nutter Butters dipped in milk chocolate, Chips Ahoy White Fudge Chunk dipped in milk chocolate & drizzled with white chocolate, and regular Chips Ahoy dipped in milk chocolate. Basically 3 cups of crushed cookies, a block of cream cheese (1/3 fat works out fine in the recipe too) and some kind of melted chocolate is a winner every time. My "technique": Make sure there are NO loose crumbs after combining cream cheese & cookies (I don't have the benefit of a food processor); Refrigerate cream cheese/cookie mix at least an hour before rolling into balls (2+ hours is best); Use a melon scoop to scoop out dough for balls to get a consistent size; Freeze balls at least an hour before dipping; Sprinkle with crumbs or decorative sprinkles as I dip so chocolate won't harden before I've sprinkled them. They're addicting!

love these recipes. i read about them in some blogs and decided they'd make a cute holiday gift. i used mint oreos and a mix of bakers/confectioners melting chocolate. my only advice is to use the entire package of oreos (don't reserve any for topping, just top with sprinkles!) and maybe 3/4 of the cream cheese... i felt like mine were a little too creamy but perhaps i just over processed the oreos? not sure. my dad raved about these :)

I tried melting a large portion of chocolate morsels in my microwave when all of the sudden my smoke alarms went off.  Smoke filled my kitchen.  I melted the remaining chips with half a stick of butter on the stove.  One whole stick of butter would have been better.  They turned out fine, the kids loved them, but I felt weird biting into a ball of cream cheese.  Blech.  I don't think I would make these again.

These were a big hit with the kids at Christmas.  Got to be a real chocolate lover to appreciate the richness of this treat.  I almost panicked when making them because I realized I did not read the directions closely enough and only bought 1 package of the semi-sweet chocolate.  Surprisingly enough, the 1 package was enough to cover all of the truffles.  If I had bought 2, it would have been wasted.

These were a big hit with the family for Christmas. They are very rich. I made a batch using mint oreos and this batch was very wet and I had difficulty even after freexing them holding them together to dip in chocolate. It worked they just didn't look pretty but made up for it with their taste! Great for Holiday cookie trays as one batch makes alot, there are few ingredients and they are simple to make.

Amazing!  Easy and fun to do!  We did the mint oreo cookies and oh my goodness good!  We also did lemon cookies and that was my favorite!  For these to turn out right you MUST refrigerate the dough before dipping. Enjoy!

I formed the balls and put them in the fridge to cool for about 45 minutes. Then I used a fork and slotted spoon for applying the chocolate. I believe the word my husband used after eating one was "delectable". I will definitely make these again!

YUM! So not healthy for you but a fab treat every once in a while. My Mother-in-law made these for us for a couple of years and I just made some this year for neighbor/friend treats. I found a few key things to do that made them really easy. First of all I ground the oreos in my food processor in batches (my processor isn't big enough to hold them all). Then after trying to mix the oreos with the cream cheese I found it easier and more efficient to mix in my food processor, again in batches. As a previous reviewer suggested when it is really smooth and starts to ball up it is ready. I then chilled for about an hour, rolled them out, chilled again for about 30 minutes and had no problems dipping in the chocolate. The smooth consistency from processing them I really think made all the difference.

I make these every holiday season. I use both chocolate and vanilla almond bark instead of real chocolate, as it sets up quicker without using the freezer or refrigerator. I then decorate with a piping bag, and the contrasting color of almond bark to what I coated them in. I find the best way for me to dip the balls in chocolate is to chill them for about 15 minutes, then use a clean toothpick (wiping off the toothpick between each dip). This results in a tiny hole on the top, but I just smear a little chocolate over it with the toothpick before it sets, and you can't tell. Tap the toothpick on the side of the bowl to drain off extra chocolate before removing the truffle. If you drizzle with white almond bark, then sprinkle with holiday colored sugars, they look very pretty. I have even piped stars and swirls and such onto the tops. So easy and fun!

Oh my gosh!! These are awesome. I made 2 batches. One regular Oroes. One mint Oreos. My only recommendation is, don't use double stuff. Grabbed it by accident and it made it hard to work with. But I did put the rolled balls into the freezer to make it easier to dip. Definately will make again!

I could not believe how delicious these are.  I am not a huge fan of cream cheese, but the combo of the oreos mixed with the cream cheese is amazing.  I melted dark chocolate chips and dipped the balls in and to make them look fancy I melted white chocolate chips and lightly drizzled that over the balls once the chocolate hardened.  Very very yummy, now one of my favorite recipes!!!

A hard chill before rolling into balls and then again before dipping into your coating works best.  Best trick I found was to get lollipop sticks and a block of floral foam.  You can dip 100% of your Oreo ball into your coating and then just stick it in the foam block.  If they are really cold before dipping, it only takes a minute or so to harden.  Remove them to a plate and just keep reusing the sticks until done.  Extremely simple and neat. I do about 8 at a time.  Wonderful!

Made for my husband for valentines day and he absolutely loved them! Couldn't have been any easier or better. I did use a 1 inch scoop to make them and was just a couple shy of the 42. Thanks for putting down such great reviews and tips for this recipe. Will make it again!

A much more easy alternative to cake balls. Tasted just as good, if not better, without the baking.

Heaven. I froze the balls for one hour with toothpicks and had NO problem dipping in the chocolate. I put them in the fridge for 15 minutes and had no trouble sliding them right out..makes it very easy to dip. These were gone in one hour. I only got to eat one!

Very cheap, easy to make, and definitely a crowd pleaser! I used a pack of regular oreos, 1 pkg of cream cheese, and a about 12oz of semi sweet choc chips. The only problem I encountered while making these, the chocolate would harden after a couple minutes, so it would become difficult to cover the truffles with the chocolate. I would recommend melting portions of the chocolate as your dipping. I will definitely be making these again and want to try white choc next time!

I made these with White Chocolate & served them with the Snow Flake Cocoa for desert at our New Years Eve party.  It went over GREAT!  Everyone loved them, and I was wishing I'd made a double batch!  I just threw the cream & cookies together in my food processor, rolled balls, dropped them in the melted white chocolate, carefully rolled them around, and scooped them up with a fork.  Worked great!

this recipe is a favorite with my friends. they always want me to make them whenever i have to bring dessert to a party.. we call them dirty snowballs =] i do two things differently that i think makes them taste a heck of a lot better: i used white chocolate or white almond bark for the coating instead of semi-sweet chocolate. also, i put the uncoated balls in the freezer for at least half an hour before i coat them, then i put them back in the freezer overnight. they taste much much better when they're icy cold... which is why i call them snowballs =D

I made these and took to work with me.  Everyone loved them!  Next time when I make them I will take the advice of others and put the truffles in the freezer before I dip in chocolate.  It might make that part a little easier.  It was quite messy but worth it!

This is one of my all-time favorites!  I make them frequently and they ALWAYS get rave reviews.  I prefer to coat them with white chocolate.  These freeze well in an air-tight container.  Just take them out as you need them.

I've been making these truffles for years and I'm pretty sure my family wouldn't let me in the house at Christmastime without a tin or two in my hand.    I do make a couple of changes, however.  1 package of cream cheese isn't enough.  1 1/2 packages works much better, or if you really like cheesecake, use 2 packages.  I also dip them in white bark, then sprinkle the top with crushed Oreo that I saved at the beginning OR crushed Andes mints!  If dipping is difficult for you, the best way is to break off the center tines of two plastic forks and use those to help you dip them.  No more awkward lumps, bumps, or bare spots!!

Definitely easy to make. OK tasting. If I make them again, I'll be trying white chocolate instead.

Made these for a dinner party recently and everyone was blown away.  I tend to dislike recipes that use premade ingrediants, but these are so delicious that I am happy to make an exception.  A successful variation I made was using mint oreos with white chocolate and green food coloring.  I also tried Nutter Butters, but those were not nearly as good as the Orea ones.  One note is that you only need to reserve 4 cookies worth of crumbles and you only need 14 oz of baking chocolate.

These are great! I made them for a Thanksgiving celebration on my boyfriend's side of the family. I was nervous, because so many of them are fantsatic cooks. I brought them in, and the entire day people were asking

 "Who brought those treats, they are so delicious! I have to have the recipe!"

It made quite the impression!

Here is a couple of tricks.  Use a food processor.  The finer the cookie crumble the better it stays together.  Make sure your cream cheese is soft and use your hands to work the cream cheese into the cookie crumbs.  It should end up like dough.  Do not refrigerate the cookie mixture before you roll it into balls, but after. Use a double boiler.  The chocolate will be too thick and you won't get a nice smooth covering if you microwave it.  Put the ball on the fork and lower it into the chocolate then when you bring it out, tap the fork against the side of the pan which will make a more even coating and get rid of excess chocolate.  Rather than sprinkle with cook crumbs, drizzle with white chocolate.  Makes a much prettier truffle.

If I could give 10 stars I would, WOW these are easy and so good I have to double and triple the batch just so I can taste one before the family eats them up.  Thanks for sharing!

This has become a favorite at our house. We make these several times a year, but coat them in white chocolate instead of semi-sweet. Usually use almond bark. Tried the dark initially, but prefer the white. Don't set aside 9 cookies to top. 3-4 is more than enough.

I was all fired up and ready to just slam this recipe since the dipping part initially was a big pain in the a**!!!  However, I stopped and read several reviews and calmed down.  First - these are some of the tastiest morsels you will ever eat, but I had trouble with melting and then coating with white chocolate.  The balls were chilled, but I just couldn't get the stuff to coat and I ended up with a big blob of chocolate. I was using a double boiler also! I transferred the blob to a small dip size crock pot and I added about a tablespoon of shortening; and then it just worked. I gave up on the skewers and just used a slotted spoon and another spoon to coat.  I may try again with the stick since I really wanted a pop presentation.  But the balls are in the fridge now and have hardened beautifully.  Still not as pretty as the pictures, but I topped with colored sprinkles and they look great. I think I will try the melting chocolate from craft stores as others had suggested, but I was determined to use what I had on hand.  I can honestly say, I will make this again, but I'm much wiser  now!

I used reduced fat Oreos and reduced fat cream cheese.  I would only reserve 4 cookies to sprinkle over the dipped truffles.  After balling the dough, I put it in the freezer for about an hour.  I microwaved 16 oz. milk chocolate chips and 1 tablespoon shortening for 20 second intervals until melted.  I dipped the end of a lollipop stick in the melted chocolate and stuck one in each ball.  I then dipped the balls and made truffle lollipops.  Everybody LOVED these!

The first time I made these, I was at the store and didn't remember if the recipe called for semi-sweet or milk chocolate so I picked up both. When I made them, they were really, really good. This time, I picked up just semi-sweet and made them and they are not nearly as good. I think next time I will make them the same way I did the first time or maybe I will try all milk chocolate. They are just not sweet enough as written.

I chilled the oreo balls for 30 mins, dipped them in chocolate, fished them out with a fork in one hand and a spoon in the other, and then chilled them again for another 30 mins.  It's messy, but deliciously worth it.  There's lots of room for exploration!!  ex. milk chocolate, white chocolate, peanut butter, buttefinger, mint oreos, nuts, etc.

I feel so sophisticated offering people these truffles.  This recipe is a keeper!

Great!! But must use the Almond Bark don't use the semi-sweet!!! The Bark is so much cleaner and hardens within minutes so you don't even have to put it in the refrigerator.

3 Thumbs Up! My hubby and both boys loved these. Tips for dipping:  chilled oreo/cream cheese mixture 10 mins before rolling into balls. Chilled balls in freezer 30 mins. before dipping.  Stirred in approx. 1/4 tsp. Crisco Oil to melted chocolate. Dropped ball into chocolate, coated with spoon where needed, tapped the dish to get a smooth coat before removing.  Drizzled with milk chocolate.

This was very easy to make, but the problem was rolling the chololate.  I found that the more expensive chocolates rolled nicer and made smoother truffles.  Good idea from the other reviewers to use other cookie types.

I made these for Christmas and they are DELICIOUS.  I may give them out next year as gifts.  I did refrigerate the balls before dipping them in the chocolate and added sprinkles instead of the cookie crumbs otherwise I followed the directions.  There are many variations I intend to try including white chocolate and flavored extract, but the recipe is great as written.

Ugh!  These truffles are amazing!!  I just couldn't stop popping these little delights into my mouth :P!  My sister-in-law brought them over to our Christmas dinner and the delicious fudge-y goodness is just ridiculous!  They taste like someone slaved over them watching every single step painstakingly to get perfection into these little bite-size treats.  Mmmmm mmm!  NOTE: Not good for those who don't like dark chocolate; however, they are surprisingly not overly sweet at all.

these were the biggest hit of all my christmas treats! I doubled the recipe and used one package of peppermint Jo-Jo's from Trader Joes and one package of regular. They had a delicious, not too overwhelming peppermint flavor. Very yummy! Also used 1/3 less fat cream cheese. Didn't affect taste at all.

Very rich.  I used fat free cream cheese.  I put the cream cheese/ oreo crumbs mixture in the freezer for about 30-40 minutes to harden it up.  Then, it was really easy to make the mixture into the  balls.  When I dipped the balls into the chocolate the outer chocolate hardened VERY quickly even while I was finishing the rest of the balls.  I wish I didn't crush the 9 cookies in the beginning.  I didn't use them.  I wish I had the whole oreos to eat.   I actually used mint oreos for Christmas.

This recipe is delicious and excellent for children to make.  I purchased milk chocolate candy coating that was microwavable, and my girls were able to make it themselves (with just a bit of assistance from me.)

So good!  I made them for christmas so I added some crushed peppermint on top instead of crushed cookie.  I used a fork to set the truffle on to pour the melted chocolate over the top then I scrapped them gently onto waxed paper and stuck them in the freezer so they would set up quickly.

I love these! I've been making these for about two years. I would recommend a couple things. One, use a double boiler (or a bowl inside a pot of boiling water) for melting the chocolate. It is easier to dip them, instead of having to reheat via microwave, and it also helps the chocolate to stay at the right temp. Also, if you're  going to make these with different flavor oreos, we LOVE them with the mint oreos, and then add about half a bag of mint chocolate chips (Andes mints are what we use) in the melted chocolate. Helps bring out the flavor.

SO GOOD!!! and so easy too! These truffles are absolutely delicious! The first time I made these I didn't have a food processor or blender, so I put the cookies in a ziploc and rolled over them w/a rolling pin. This works ok, but I would recommend crushing half at a time if you do it this way. The second time I made them I used my blender, and the cream caused it to keep stopping because everything was stuck in the blade. My solution: put small batches in a ziploc and crush, then in the blender to finish it off. (unless someone wants to buy me a food processor-I'm sure it's much easier)

Update on 1/17/11:  These tasted great but weren't that attractive when first made.  The looked smoother after they cooled some.  

Original review 12/23/10: Is it just me?  The chocolate coating kept getting so thick.  I would try to heat it a little to thin it out and it would smell like it was burning.  These will probably taste ok but they look like something out of the cat box!  A man in my office made these for our Christmas party and his were pretty but mine look awful.  It is so hard to coat the balls.  I wonder if would be easier to use chocolate chips instead of the baking chocolate squares.  Mine look nothing like the picture...those are all smooth.

Sooo good!  I decided to expand upon the recipe and try them with Mint Oreos!  Something about the "stuffing" is different than with the regular Oreos, so you need to use more wafers (scrape the stuffing off about 9 more cookies) or dough will be too gooey.  But the result is AWESOME!  Minty goodness.  I used white chocolate to dip them.  So good!  Next, maybe the peanut butter Oreos??

I've made these a few times and they are easy and delicious. Didn't and wouldn't change a thing. A lot of people have asked for the recipe. Very chocolatey and rich.

PS: try replacing the oreos with NutterButters! Delicious!

So delicious and so easy. I crushed the oreos in my food processor and then added the cream cheese to it and mixed it all together then I melted the chocolate in the microwave stirring after thirty second intervals. Instead of crushed oreos on top we sprinkled them with colored sprinkles. Easy peasy.

These were very good. I made some mint and some chcolate creme. I don't have a food processor so I needed to crush them in a bag. So that it wasn't so messy, I twisted the cookie off one side, and scraped the cream into the cream cheese. It came off in one piece and no mess in the bag when I crushed the cookies. For dipping I placed the truffle on the end of a fork like others and spooned the chocolate over it.

These truffles are tasty and pretty easy to make as truffles go.  My mom accidentally used my bakers chocolate so I had to use chocolate chips and it worked out fine.  You also don't need to crush 9 cookies to sprinkle the truffles.  I think 5 would be fine.  Thanks for the recipe.

this is a great recipe... everywhere i take the I am asked at least 5 times for the recipe.  I use the white chocolate or vanilla meltys instead of the milk or dark chocolate to cover the balls.  Beware of trying to speed up the cool down in the freezer when you put the balls in the chocolate they expand and will crack the chocolate.  Another helpful tip... use a toothpick to dip the balls, you can place a drizzle over the top later, it covers the hole just fine :)

DANG!  I hate to be one of the bad reviews because believe me, these sounded amazing. I thought they were to sweet and gooey.  Something about this recipe just didn't work for me.  I have made regular "truffles" by the dozen in the past so I am no novice but I won't make these again.

I have made these several times and love them! My tricks are to first, roll all of the oreo mixture into the balls and put on the cookie sheet and then into the fridge for about 1 hour. 
Then I pull out my handy dandy wilton chocolate melter pot thing and get the chocolate started. (It's great because it keeps it at the perfect tempered temperature.) Then I pull out the balls and dip them into the chocolate doing 2 rows then putting them back into the fridge for 20 minutes. Repeat this until done. This keeps the oreo stiff enough to hold up to the chocolate when dipping. DON'T put them into the freezer, they will sweat and become soft when you take them out. When just using the fridge I have found that the chocolate keeps that satisfying crunch no matter how long they have been sitting on the table. ***Also, make sure your chocolate is warm enough because if it isn't tempered it will coat the oreo balls too thickly thus creating a soft exterior.***

I needed to bring something for a baby shower at work. However, I didn't feel like buying any pricey ingredients and I had limited time, so I decided to try these. Everyone in the office LOVED them! Multiple people asked me for the recipe. I was tempted to tell them something overly complex, but decided not to lie since a million hits come up when you Google "Oreo Truffles."

On the advice of other reviewers, I froze the balls before spooning the chocolate over them. I made some with semi-sweet chocolate and some with white chocolate. I added canola oil to the melted chocolate to make it easier to spoon over the balls and to make the chocolate look prettier. I only melted a little chocolate at a time, so I didn't have to worry about it hardening too quickly.

Been making these for years! Never had one person say they don't like them.   Easy, simple, and tasty! Great for any occasion, I definitely recommend using the mint oreos and dark chocolate! Very tasty, and fun to experiment. My sister calls them better than, well, the three letter you know what word, balls! ;) Thanks!

I made these for my daughters Kindergarten class and everyone, even the teachers love them! My daughters teacher is begging me to make these for next snack day! :) I like to use vanilla almond bark and use sprinkles according to the season (green and red sugar crystals for Christmas, hearts for Valentines, etc.) to help some of the decor show up. This week, I have snack day and w/Easter coming I may just use the baker's chocolate w/the pastel Easter sprinkles I got so they show up. :)

I got this recipe years ago calling for almond bark, but the bakers squares work also. Covering the entire ball works best for me if I chill the balls in the freezer 10-20 minutes, then inserting a toothpick, dip & cover, let the excess dip fall and then stand the dipped ball in a piece of styrofoam. (I now save all styrofoam when I buy anything packed in a box like my last printer!) Once they are all dipped and and stuck, the whole thing can be set in the refrigerator. Toothpicks can be pulled out after the dip has hardened. If I find I need to melt more bark before I'm done, I put the undipped ones back in the freezer until I'm ready. If they are not chilled long enough, they won't stay on the toothpick without falling. I tried mint double stuff and it works, but required more time. I had to freeze the dough 10-20 minutes to make the rolling easy, then freeze 10-20 minutes after rolled to make the dipping easy, then refrigerate. They should also be kept chilled (especially double stuff ones) because they longer they sit at room temperature, they become very very gooey. They tasted better chilled to with the mint. My friend tried using nutter butters and they were NOT good. They tasted more like play dough than a cookie!

Like other reviewers I always chill them first.  I don't chill before rolling them with my 5yr old little helper.  I pop them in the freezer for a while & then transfer to the fridge prior to dipping.  I use a strong plastic fork with the 2 middle prongs removed (just bend them back and break off).  

I also like to mix my chocolates and use a variety for dipping, chocolate almond bark, then add both dark & milk choco candy bars & chips.

I also line a cookie sheet & sprinkle excess cookie crumbs to help the bottoms from sticking.  I tap the dipped truffle on the side of  the pot to remove excess chocolate & just drop onto the sheet.  I usually only take out about 6 from the fridge at a time so they stay chilled.  You may have areas of uncovered truffle, just use the tip of the fork to recover the areas.  I then sprinkle each one with extra crumbles, nuts, decorating colored sugar or powdered sugar...be creative.  After I have a cookie sheet filled I then pop them back in the fridge to cool again.  My 5 yr old does not like minty things, but loves the Mint Oreo Truffles.

Anytime I have taken these to a gathering, there are never any left.  So leave a few at home for yourself to enjoy later.  This is now one of my staple recipes I take to all parties at their request :-)

ENJOY!!!!

My Family loves the Oreo Truffles! I use my small fondue pot to keep the chocolate from getting hard. This makes it easy to dip. Hope this helps

Got this recipe from my cousin at Christmas and have made it several times. Actually won first prize at our church's chocolate buffet for Valentines Day. I think people are trying to make them much too difficult.  I did use the regular Oreos but want to try the double stuff and different flavors.  I put 5 at a time in the blender, dumped each batch into a bowl and then added the softened cream cheese. A pastry blender worked great to mix together and then used a cookie scoop to make the balls. That makes them very uniform and your hands aren't in them so much.  I then round them and squeeze to make them stick together good.  Chill well. I used just almond bark to dip and they were fantastic.  I found the toothpicks were a pain so after the first time just used 2 forks and put them on waxed paper.  So many possibilities of variations.  Use your imagination.

I have been making this recipe for years (using the full package of regular Oreos, not double stuff), only I dip in melted white chocolate or almond bark, then drizzle milk or dark chocolate over (using a plastic bag with a hole in one corner), giving them a very professional look.  The best way I have found to dip is to do one side, let it harden, then dip the other side and then lay them on the original flat side created by the first dip.

This is a family favorite during the holidays! However, you have to have a serious sweet tooth to really appreciate it...which my family does.  I put the mixture in the frig for a bit to make it easier to roll.  Once I roll them I put them in the freezer and let it sit for a couple of hours, it makes it easier to place in the melted chocolate, the chocolate immediately hardens around the balls when I place them on the waxed sheets.

Made them for Superbowl.  Everyone loves them and they are so easy.  Remember to put them in the fridge after mixing them and for several hours after putting the chocolate on them.  Used a plastic fork with middle two prongs broken off to dip in the chocolate.  
Also, keep the oreos whole, no need to scrape off the filling!

I made a batch each of peanut butter w/choc coating and oreo w/white choc coating using the suggestion of freezing the dough balls a few minutes first, adding crisco to the chocolate or white chips,  and using a broken fork to lift  from the coating.....they are perfect and taste wonderful!

They aren't too many overrated recipes on allrecipes, but this is definitely one of them. They tasted like exactly what they were, Oreos crushed and doused in cream cheese, covered in cheap tasting chocolate. I was hoping the combination would together taste like greater than the sum of the parts, but it really didn't. I would've rather just eaten the box of cookies and not wasted my time or made the mess. They really just don't taste very good.

Did I miss something? These did not taste good. I love oreo cookies, and cream cheese but when I made these for the holidays, and tasted one, I was too embarrassed to even give them to family and friends. I even tried them with almond bark candy coating and milk chocolate. I was disappointed. And I made them because I saw they were HIGHLY rated. So, I just wanted to share my experience in case someone has taste buds similar to mine. I will not make these again.

I have made these at least 10 times now.  I use almond bark or white chocolate instead of semi-sweet because I like the balance of flavors better.  Everyone who tastes them falls in love with them, even people who don't like Oreos (can you imagine these people exist?).  They're so pretty and easy to make and really are fool proof.

Love this recipe, and have made it at least 10-12 times so far.  I crush the Oreo's in one of those nut choppers you push down on with your hand.  It may take a few times to crush up all the cookies in little batches, but it still seems easier than the large zip lock bag.  (of course I probably used that method before even thinking of the hand chopper)

** I wanted to point out one important thing..... it seems the newer packages of Oreos only have 39 cookies in them.  So if you take 9 out, you only have 30 left, not the 36 the recipe calls for.  **

Easy and delicious! I used Ghiradelli semi-sweet chips melted in a double boiler with 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil for a smoother consistency. Took them to a friend's the next day and they were loved by all! In fact, she asked for the recipe tonight because her husband is jones-ing for them! Enjoy!

I have been making these for years & these truffles are probably the reason I keep getting invited to christmas parties. Everyone loves them!
A few tricks I've learned:
1. Food processor for the oreos. Then I knead in the cr cheese by hand.
2. Place balls on a cookie sheet in the freezer for 15 min before coating.
3. USE VANILLA CANDY COATING / ALMOND BARK. (Not white chocolate.) It is much easier to work with and solves the problem of them tasting too rich.

These were such a hit!!!  

I used the holiday oreos with red filling thinking it would be more festive, not knowing that once everything is mixed up, you can't see the color of the filling...it's just all dark brown goodness.  

So so so so SO GOOD!

I followed someone elses advice and froze the balls prior to dipping, as well as using two spoons instead of toothpicks.  

Also, I used ghiradeli chocolate!  Mmmmmmm...

Oh. My. Gosh. Love this recipe. I just wanted to make a dessert and didn't want to do cookies again. Found this recipe...it is a KEEPER! My new go-to for sweets. I followed other advice #1, chill to "dough" after mixing. #2, I mixed it up a little and added half regular Oreos and half Golden Oreos. #3 I melted the chocolate in a glass bowl over simmering water. It worked great at keeping the chocolate melted while dipping the balls. #4 I used a serving size spoon with holes to put the ball on, used a regular spoon to scoop the melted chocolate over it, then used a fork to move the ball to the wax paper. A little messy, but that's totally okay with me.
It's a hit with everyone who's tried it so far!

Warning: ADDICTIVE!! These little gems are super rich and super yummy! Takes some patience sometimes to get the chocolate coating to be nice and smooth but well worth it! Made these for Christmas about 4 years ago and have made them every year since.

With all the great reviews of this recipe, I think I was expecting it to be better than it was.  Not sure I like the Oreo taste of the truffles - thought by mixing with cream cheese they would be creamier.  They were okay but just didn't hit the mark of being "amazing".  Will continue to look for a more traditional truffle recipe.

These are so wonderful! I made them for a pitch in  at work and everyone asked me for the recipe! I make the balls and put them in the freezer with a tooth pick in them. They stay in the freezer for about 15-20 minutes, then I use the toothpicks to dip them in the chocolate. It works out pretty well. I would love to know how others get them to look so perfect!

I don't know if I'd call these easy, but they are delicious! I used a fork and a spoon for dipping and had a friend sprinkling on the extra cookie crumbs after I pulled them out of the chocolate so they didn't harden before I got to that step. Also tried the Nutter Butters but the Oreo ones were much better!

I made these in 2 batches using Newman's Organic O's in original and mint flavored...both were a big hit! I replaced the semi-sweet chocolate with Ghirardelli bitter-sweet chocolate....amazing! Definitely use a food process for the blending of the cookies and cream cheese. It was easier to mold the truffles if you let the mixture sit in the fridge for 20-30mins. I also let the truffles sit in the fridge for about 4hrs before I dipped them in the chocolate. Using a double boiler for the chocolate made the dipping process pretty painless. Easy & tasty…thanks for sharing!

Made these once as directed, but they were too chocolately for me. Made a second time with an equivalent amount of Nutter Butter cookies (about 26 for the filling if anyone's wondering), dipped in melted semi-sweet baking chips, and then rolled in either butterfinger crumbs, skor pieces, or white fudge pretzel pieces.  I would recommend using the Baker's chocolate as directed, as I found that the melted chocolate chips were too thick for dipping (kind of had to plunge in and then scrape off excess).  I also highly recommend those three toppings, as they are delicious, easy, and look great too.  However, this recipe is too dense/rich for my taste.  It's kind of funny to watch people's faces when they take too big of a bite out of these.  They are better when they're cold though, and I think they're also better after a day or two in the fridge.  Definitely have a beverage at the ready when eating these!  Oh, and the short ingredient list is still a plus.

I made these for a valentines day party and put red and white sprinkles on them while the chocolate was still warm. My only complaint is that they are only good when chilled, I set them out at the party and they tasted different at room temperature. I also used the double stuffed oreos so I really didn't taste much of the cream cheese. They sure are a rich chocolate treat!

Absolutely delicious! I was worried they would be too rich as I don't like extremely rich desserts but they were perfect. Thanks for sharing!

I made these for my boyfriend and they were, as the recipe suggested, very easy to make.  The taste, however, was less than satisfying for me (my boyfriend is easy to please in the food department).  The taste of the truffle was not impressive.  I expected to taste more oreo, but I felt the cookie was completely lost in the recipe.

YUM! I served these at a bridal shower, and they were a hit! Very easy to make and so delicious! They need a little crunch, so the cookie crumbles on top help.

I would have probably rated these higher a few months ago but I've recently began trying to give up processed foods and eating "natural" foods.  I know why would I then make Oreo Truffles?  Well, it was the Holidays and the kids wanted to make cookies and candy and we tried these and what should have been just decadence upon decadence it just tasted really really sweet.  Not much flavor but a shocking explosion of sweet.

I've made these over and over again and they are always a big hit.  I generally dip them in chocolate bark and decorate with a swirly frosting line.  Also, don't have them too cold when dipping or the chocolate will crack.

These are amazing! I used half chocolate almond bark and half completely unsweetened baking chocolate. This brought down the sweetness of the shell and accentuated the deliciousness of the oreo inside. I also mixed some instant coffee into the shall. AWESOME. We gave them away and got rave reviews.

I've been making a version of these for a few years now. They are easy and delicious. I dip mine in dark chocolate and refrigerate and then drizzle white chocolate over the dark chocolate, this makes for a pretty truffle.

This recipe has made it impossible to show up at a family function without bringing them! You MUST use Ghiradelli chocolate morsels when making them. (it is the only brand that will melt well for me) Good luck and be warned that if you make these once, you will forever be hounded about bringing these everywhere you go!!

I know these as Wow Balls.  Why “Wow Balls”?  Because that was the first and only word I was able to utter as I enjoyed my first delicious bite of one of these glorious goodies.   Wow.  Chocolate haters beware – this recipe is not for you. These balls are rich, decadent, and oh-so-delicious.  In a word:  WOW.

This simple recipe is both cheap to make and tasty!  I used reduced fat cream cheese and oreos.  I also used 4 huge (movie-size) bars of Symphony chocolate instead of the Baker's.  Using a double boiler, I broke up all of the chocolate in the pot and then turned the heat on.  As it says in the review below, make sure to turn the heat off as soon as it's melted.  Instead of using toothpicks or spoon, I used tongs, and it was a breeze to clean up.

These are awesome!  I did one batch with regular Oreos dipped in melted white chocolate, and another with crushed Nutter Butter dipped in dark chocolate.  Both are amazing.  Form into balls and place in freezer for 1/2 hr. and they are solid enough to poke with a toothpick & dip in chocolate.

I thought they were a little too sweet, however they received rave reviews and were gone quite fast at the Christmas party.  Maybe try white chocolate on the outside.  Easy to make.

Easy recipe was great for Christmas, my only recommendation is after you make the mix put it in the fridge or freezer for 15mins then roll your balls and then dip it in the melted chocolate =)

Oreos.  Cream cheese.  Chocolate.  How could it be anything less than great?  This was "the cookie/candy" this Christmas.  Everyone LOVED them (even my son who "doesn't care for chocolate").  These will be made every year for Christmas at our house!

These are fantastic!!! I chilled the balls for 1 hour before dipping in chocolate, both white and semi-sweet. I used a slotted spoon and it worked great! Everybody raved over these easy-to-make, delicious treats!

These are to die for.  I have been making these for years.  If you have not made them - give them a try - you will be glad you did.  Here are a few tried and true shortcuts.  I use my food processor (this helps to make the oreos crumbs fine) also cuts the prep time in half.  I always refrigerate the balls first on a wax paper covered cookie sheet (for about 30 minutes). Then to cover them - I use  chocolate almond bark (you can find at wal-mart) it really melts and covers well.  Dipping the cold balls in the chocolate helps it set fast. Also,  I usually only get about 30 from the recipe (not 42 as the recipe shows)

Wonderful and versatile!  I used peppermint flavored cookies and 2 blocks of cream cheese, but they were the hit of coffee hour at church, and in Christmas gifts.  I used chocolate almond bark, and once I added semi-sweet chocolate chips. I don't think you can hurt these things!

Everyone flipped over how good these truffles tasted.  So simple and fun to make.  I found that using a wooden spoon to dip the truffles into the chocolate worked very well.  Followed suggestion to put the "dough" in the freezer for 10-15 minutes before rolling into balls and dipping into chocolate.  Thank you for the great recipe!!! This is a keeper.

These are amazing. It's pretty essential to chill the Oreo mixture before rolling into balls, and then chilling again before dipping into the melted chocolate. I just balanced each truffle on a spoon, rolled in chocolate, then pushed it off the spoon onto wax paper with a chopstick. I used a high-quality blender and the mix didn't stick at all. Brought them to the office for Christmas and got rave reviews.

I used double stuf as well as mint oreos-no problems, even without chilling as some reviewers recommended. The balls never fell apart and my kids had fun helping roll them and toss them in the chocolate.

Very time consuming, but pretty and delicious.  They made a nice gift to give to others.  I did all of the mixing in my food processor.  Half were dipped in white, the other in semi-sweet choc. chips.  The dipping didn't look perfect, but when drizzled with the opposite color the imperfections were not noticed.

These are wonderful!  They chocolate is a little hard to work with.  Make sure you use a very small pot to melt the chocolate as it is not very much and will be much easier to deal with in a smaller pot.  In fact, if you have a 'chocolate pot' that would be best!  I put my balls in the freezer before dipping, it helps.

Used my food processor to chop cookies. Mixed cream cheese and cookies in the processor, also. No problem forming into balls. Put balls on wax paper lined cookie sheet and popped in freezer for about 30 mins. Following the advice of another reviewer, I used two plastic forks, with the two middle stems broken out, to dip the balls in the chocolate. Very easy and turned out pretty. These will propably be on my Christmas Candy list each year to come.

These are INCREDIBLY tasty. I really REALLY liked the flavor. The only reason they get 4/5 stars is because they absolutely did NOT make 42 truffles as the recipe predicted they would. I only got a little under 30 out of them and they were no larger than the truffles that I made out of the "cake balls" recipe from this same site (which, coincidentally predicted fewer cake balls than I created all 3 times that I've made them!) Regardless, great taste, great look, but wish they made more!

We do these with mint oreos too. Be sure to make them SMALL... bite sized. Secrets to not pulling your hair out. Mix all ingredients and chill...being in MN I stick them outside for 5-10 minutes but a freezer will work too. Robb into balls, put on cookie sheet and freeze again to dip in chocolate almond bark & drizzle with vanilla almond bark. They are putzy but worth it!

Amazing!  My daughter called these "dirt balls" before we dipped them - funny.  I, too, used the food processor to mix in the cream cheese (having the cream cheese at room temperature was key!).  Easy!  I refrigerated the balls overnight, and boy, were they easy to work with!  The amount of chocolate to melt seemed like a lot, but you will need it, so don't skimp.  I used red and green sprinkles and crushed candy canes for Christmas - festive!  Thanks for the recipe!

These turned out really nicely, and look beautiful. They were a hit! My only dislike is that they are a bit too sweet. Maybe if the chocolate were thinned out a bit to make the coating a little thinner, they wouldn't be as sweet. Otherwise, they're wonderful!

I have to give these a 5 star (even if I thought they were just ok) because everyone else in the family thought they were awesome.  My son thought they tasted & looked like they came from a gourmet store.  My elderly mother who doesn't like chocolate could not quit eating them.

My whole family ADORES these.  I really, really reccommend using white chocolate candy coating instead of the semi-sweet chocolate, however...it really makes the difference between a 4- and 5-star recipe.

Awesome taste and relatively easy to do. I made them into balls & then refrigerated overnight. In addition to this recipe, and after reading a few others ideas, I made a separate batch with Nutter Butters. Same base recipe but I also added 2 giant heaping spoonfuls of peanut butter, then after dipping I topped with crushed peanuts. They look amazing -- like something you would buy in a upscale candy store. One thing to note: these candies are incredibly rich!

My husband and I loved these and he loved them more than I did' only because of the mess they were to make.  (that is why I gave them 4 stars) I highly encourage letting the cookie/cream cheese mixture sit in the freezer for a while (I went and did another whole cookie recipe)  Then I was able to role them in a ball and pierced them with a skewer stick to dunk in the warm chocolate mixture; and because they were plenty cool and firm they did not melt into the warm chocolate.  I kept them in a airtight container in a cool pantry room and they kept for a long time and were very tastey little treats.

These are great tasting and really pretty but they lose a star for being a pain. I use chocolate chips instead of the chocolate, but it was way thick and didn't want to make a nice thin coat. I finally just dipped it in a little chocolate, then rolled it around between gloved palms to smear it, then rolled it colored sugar or cookie crumbs.... only way to get them remotely pretty. It does work better to work with the balls frozen. These are yummy and pretty but EASY is a lie.

Absolutely easy.  I refrigerated the balls while I melted the chocolate.  Don't melt all your chocolate at once.  I used semi sweet baking chips and didn't need two whole 8 oz bags.  I used a regular fork to dip the balls into the chocolate but too much chocolate kept sticking to the fork.  I had a disposable plastic fork so I broke off the two inside tines and it worked perfectly like a professional candy coating fork.  Made the job simple!

Super easy and really delicious and rich!  I think I may have seen it mentioned in another comment but putting the chocolate in a slow-cooker was a great approach.  Break up the chocolate as much as you can then add to the slow-cooker.  Bring the heat up to high and cover stirring every few minutes until smooth.  Then drop a well chilled truffle into the pot, roll around with a spoon until coated, remove with a spoon and drop on waxed paper to let it cool.  Worked out great!

I made these last Christmas for a gift for my choir's gift exchange. I coated them in milk chocolate, and then, after they'd cooled, I melted white chocolate and poured it into a squirt bottle. On the top of each ball, I made little musical notes w/ the white chocolate. They looked VERY professional. I put each ball in a tiny paper cup (mini cupcake liners) and put them in a flat box. They were quite a hit and SO yummy.

I made these last Christmas.  They were so easy, and yummy too!  I used Archer Farms mint cookie Oreo knock off and I think the mint is a must!  If you use regular Oreos make sure and add in some mint extract.

I have been making these for 10 years or more.  I have tried every possible flavor of oreo (I agree with another reviewer-do not use double stuff oreos, they do not work well).  Favorite is still the original.  People cannot believe what these are made of when you tell them.  These are frequently requested at picnics, potlucks and office parties. Give them a try, you wont be dissapointed. (store them in the fridge in an airtight container)

Really easy and yummy.  Not that messy if you do the following: Put the 36 Oreos in a large plastic heavy duty freezer bag. Finely crush them with a rolling pin and then add the cream cheese.  Massage the bag until well mixed.  Use a 1" scoop to form the balls inside the bag (I used the Pampered Chef scoop) .  Do refrigerate the balls before dipping in chocolate.  Use a spoon to plop and cover the balls with chocolate and pick up with a slotted spoon or fork.  I drizzle the white chocolate on top- not as messy as sprinkling the crushed Oreos and it looks prettier!  This year for Christmas I will top with crushed peppermints.   Seriously, I barely had messy hands using this method and less clean up!!

These are super rich.  I love rich but these are a bit over the top.  As others suggested, chilling the dough was a big help.  Toothpick did not work..I used a spoon to dip into the chocolate.  I decorated them with some melted almond bark and they looked very professional.

These are very, very rich and delicious. I love Oreo cookies and this recipe is another way to enjoy them. I tried the toothpick idea that other reviewers suggested when it came to dipping the truffles but I didn't have much success. I still had some of my son's old infant spoons so I would drop the truffle into the chocolate, then place it on the baking sheet and then smooth it out a bit with the baby spoon. Instead of dipping them all in semi-sweet chocolate, I dipped some in white chocolate. I also rolled a few in powdered sugar and some in cocoa powder. I plan on making a large batch for Christmas!

I made one truffle to experiment because I only had Trader Joe's Joe-Joe's which are candy cane flavored oreo cookies. I eye-balled the cream cheese and mixed it with one crushed cookie, then dipped it in a melted Dove dark chocolate (red wrapper) promise. It made my eyes roll in the back of my head!  These are awesome and I will make it exactly this way in huge batches to give away this Christmas.

So heavenly! After shaping into balls, I put in the freezer for 30 minutes. Then I dipped them into melted milk chocolate instead of Semi Sweet (personal preference) These are so easy to make, and just plain wonderful.

These are delicious -- a big hit at my Christmas cocktail party. I preferred the batch with a white chocolate coating better than the milk or dark chocolate, personally. Also, I recommend making some with mint Oreos instead of the regular ones for a little extra deliciousness.

So easy!! Every time I bring these I get asked for the recipe. I have made the with every flavor that oreo makes. They are very good with original dipped in white almond bark. YUM!! Make sure to use two spoons to roll the balls around in the chocolate. I did this for the first time and don't know why I didn't do it sooner. I have always refrigerated them and then used a toothpick to assist in the coating process. My son and I did three batches in a half an hour!! I will never think twice about making these because of time.

So so so SO easy and fun to make. I recommend adding some of the Oreo icing you can now buy in packets at the store. It gave the oreos better flavor.

Wonderful!!!!!! I made them for an event and they were a hit. AND super easy. Tip: let your chocolate cool slightly, drop refrigerated balls into chocolate using a slotted spoon, drain the excess choc and use a small spoon to roll the ball off into crumbs to coat. (I did 3 balls at a time using this method. Super quick and easy)

Amazing! So easy & so good. Been waiting a long time to try these & finally made them and wish I hadn't waited so long! After combining the cream cheese & cookies together, I put it back in the fridge for a bit to let it harden a bit. I rolled a few balls before doing that & they were sticking to my hands as I was dipping them in chocolate. The extra few mins in the fridge took care of that problem! Will make again soon for sure!

OH SO GOOD! I made these for my daughter graduation party. I made over 500 all different styles, I made some with lemon cookies and added some lemon extract so good with white chocolate. other with Nutter Butter and of course Oreo. Almond bark works the best as coating.

The recipe is indeed easy to make.  Refrigeration of the dough before making the balls and then again before dipping into the melted chocolate, as recommended by other users, does make the job easy.  The treats were actually fun to make.

But it just did not taste that great.  I had higher expectations from a 5 star rated recipe.  The chocolate coating is tasty.  The inside is not.  The combination is so so.   The thicker the coating the better they taste.  The inside would benefit from better ingredients.  

I recently made better truffles using another recipe.  I believe that you cannot go wrong with simple and tasty ingredients such as dark chocolate, heavy cream and butter instead of cookies and processed cheese.

I made the balls a bit smaller than the recipe called for and used 30 broken cookies to the 8oz of cream cheese.  I also dipped them in white chocolate instead of brown.  They were the hit of the brunch.

This recipe was wonderful.  I used milk chocolate bits with a teaspoon of vegetable oil instead of the baking chocolate and they turned out great.  I also tried them using the nutter butter cookies and they were amazing.

These were a hit. Only thing was it only made 27 for me and mine werent big or anything. Im doing these agan and I guess I will double the recipie to get hopefully 50. This was great. I made 13 white chocolate and 13 mild chocolate. the regular white nestle chocolate chips turned out fine. The semi-sweet baking store brand chips turned otut good to. I myself prefer white chocolate so I am a bit biased. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars was because of the amount made. Other than that they were all gone in like 5 min and people raved about them all night.

I decided to make this for Valentines Day and all of my friends loved it! Everyone asked for the recipe! I do have to say that it was kind of difficult to roll the balls in the chocolate. So make sure you put them in the freezer for 15-20 minutes before you roll them in the chocolate. I also dipped half of the ball in the chocolate because it was easier for me. If you want the whole ball to be covered in chocolate then I suggest to dip it in the chocolate, put it on the wax paper and add chocolate to the part of the ball that was not dipped.

i finally made these for the holidays! but i gotta say, i was a little disappointed. they were a total pain to roll in the chocolate, not easy at all. and although they were quite tasty, if they were left out at room temp for a little bit of time, they became really mushy and kinda gross. they need to be kept refrigerated!! these are not the kind of treats that you leave out on a plate for people to eat on their own time. sadly, i wish i had known this BEFORE i made them.

Great recipe! I wanted to make a 'test run' with these and make 10 at first instead of 42. So i used 2oz cream cheese and 4.5 peanut butter OREO'S cookies. I crushed the oreos in the food processor. I put the cream cheese in the microwave for 10 seconds then just mixed that in with a spoon to the oreos. Then I chilled in the fridge for 30mins and then the mixture was very easy to work with. I chilled another 30mins after making the balls, then rolled them around in melted chocolate, added some cookie crumbles on top, and left them in the fridge over night. VERY EASY AND DELICIOUS! Will be making these again with a variety of combinations (different cookies, rolled in walnuts, coconut...etc).

Easy and delicious! Dipped in white chocolate. Took a while to dip, but well worth the time. I refrigerated the balls before dipping, then used two forks to dip and moved truffle back and forth between forks to help chocolate drain off.

Love this recipe.  So Easy and Oh so Yummy.  I did one thing differently, I use white almond bark/chocolate to coat the balls then sprinkled with oreo crumbs.  I just love the contrast and it looks like an oreo inside out, LOL.

I made these for the first time for Christmas and WOW!  They are delicious and there are so many variations you can try.  It was a little time consuming to coat them but they came out perfect and I just added crumbled cookies as the topping.  I did freeze the balls and it worked out fine.  You really can't eat more than one because they are so rich.  I brought some into work and everyone raved about them.  I want to try them with the strawberry oreos for Valentines day.

==EDITED==

This is one of my go-to recipes. My gained wisdom:

Instead of using Oreos, use Famous Chocolate Wafers (http://www.amazon.com/Famous-Chocolate-Wafers-9-Ounce-Boxes/dp/B000FA38ZE). Tastes like the cookie part only of Oreos without the filling--makes it extra chocolatey and dense, and less sweet. 

For the topping, instead of the crushed cookies, I use a fork to drizzle melted white chocolate, then sprinkle SEA SALT or other large grained salt. It looks GORGEOUS and so professional, and the salt makes it 3x as delicious.

Best way to dip truffles: CHOPSTICKS. If you are proficient with chopsticks (as I am), this is by far the fastest and neatest way to do it.

More variations:

filling:
crushed toffee, single nut in center, crushed toasted nuts, liqueurs (orange, coffee)

outside:
crushed toasted nuts
cocoa powder
toasted coconut
powdered sugar
white vanilla candy dip (looks great with the dark filling)

Delicious, beautiful yet easy to make.  A little time consuming to make them really pretty but so worth the effort.  I put them in the freezer before dipping in chocolate to make them easier to handle. Everyone loves them and i was asked for the recipe several times.  I made them the first time as instructed with a full pkg of cream cheese but found the balls too soft and mushy. I adjusted the amount to 1/2pkg and i make two different flavors with one pkg. Golden oreos and candy cane flavored ones are favorites.

I make these drizzled with white chocolate. I also make this recipe with nutter butter cookies dipped in white chocolate and drizzled with milk chocolate for Christmas gifts every year. They're always a huge hit and look so nice!

Absolutely phenomenal!! I made them and the entire family LOVES them. They store well in the fridge in a sealed container too. Like others have said, chilling the balls for about 15 min before you roll them in chocolate helps them stay together, and I used two spoons to roll the ball around and then just drop it directly on an aluminum covered pan. YUM!

I make these every Christmas and they are always a hit. I have never had any problem with them falling apart, and I've used about every Oreo possible. It does help to freeze the balls before you dip them though, or they turn to mush and are almost impossible to work with. I've done a ton of combos, and the favorite so far was strawberry milkshake oreos with a white chocolate coating, and peppermint with a semi-sweet coating (both seasonal flavors).

I use white melting chocolate and use chocolate sprinkles for the top. After rolling the balls, I place a toothpick into each one and place in the freezer for a short time.  The toothpicks make for easy dipping into the melted chocolate and much less trouble than forks. Remove the toothpick after dipping, by pressing another toothpick against it, and place a drip of chocolate to hide the hole, place your sprinkles over this area. Chocolate is easily melted for 30 seconds at a time in the microwave, stirring between intervals. These are beautiful, everyone loves them and can't believe they only have 3 ingredients!! LOVE this recipe, Enjoy!!!!

Roll them small, they are rich!  Also, 9 oreos for topping ended up being too much for me.  Based on reviews I refrigerated the mix for about 20 minutes before forming the truffles, then placed on a wax lined cookie sheet in the freezer for 30 minutes.  A double boiler will help keep your chocolate the right temp.  Too warm and it will cause the truffles to fall apart.  I worked in small batches - took 6 out of the freezer at a time.

The taste of these, OH MY GOSH!!!!!!!!  I just need to work on my coating skills.  This was the first time I made a candy that needed to be coated in chocolate and I did half in milk chocolate and half in white chocolate and I ran a bit short (from my inexperience I'm sure).  I'm sure you know they were not pretty, but sure did taste good.

These were good, i was hoping they tasted more like cream cheese but they didn't. I took out all of the stuffing from the cookies, I didn't have the problem others were complaining about, making the balls was easy just time consuming and dipping them in chocolate wasn't a problem either. I topped them with peanut and pecan pieces and they were good next time I'm going to put nuts inside with maybe a drop of caramel and entire pecan halves on top!! Yum!

So easy and soooo good. Be sure and let them set in the fridge before you dip them though or you'll end up with a mess. I HIGHLY suggest using mint cream oreos, the mint just takes this dish to a whole other level.

These truffles are absolutely sinful.  However, for some reason, the coating did not get firm even after being in the refrigerator overnight.
I have used chocolate coatings for many years on numerous truffles and cookies and bars and this is the first time I run into this problem.  
I am not worried about having them left over regardless of the softer coating.  They are wonderful.
I will try it again with chocolate and parowax.  I'm sure that will do the trick.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

We made the inner part of the truffles one night, and dipped them the next morning.  Our experience: a potato masher did a good job breaking up the cookies since we lacked a food processor.  The Oreo/cream cheese mix was oily, but not hard to work with when room temp.  We rolled the balls without much trouble, then refrigerated them overnight.  The next day, the balls were cold and hard--ideal for dipping.  To dip them, we melted the chocolate over a double boiler, and kept it just hot enough to steam and pour, but not so hot it might melt the balls.  We put one ball at a time into a slotted spoon, and scooped a little chocolate from the double-boiler on top of each and rolled it around.  We put the wet truffles onto a greased cookie sheet, then refrigerated them a half hour.  The result: delicious!  The cheese had thoroughly blended with the cookies overnight, so the insides of the truffles are creamy and soft.  What a hit!

These were great!  I did put the mix in the fridge before I rolled them to make them roll easier before I dipped.  You can only eat 1 because these were very rich!   I learned you cannot melt white chocolate in a microwave.  :(

Everyone loves these. If you make them with double-stuffed oreos the filling will be really soft and creamy. I also like to make different flavors. I've added crushed walnuts, shredded coconut and finely chopped maraschino cherries to the cream cheese and cookie mixture before rolling them into balls. Cherry tastes wonderful dipped in dark chocolate rather than semi-sweet. When I can find the mint oreos I make mint oreo truffles simply by substituting the regular oreos with mint oreos and dipping them in melted mint chocolate chips.

YUMMY!  Very rich so They are better as small bites, but everyone will devour them regardless!

Made a vanilla version with the vanilla OREOS... Oh my goodness!  They are like little bites of Cheesecake. I also tried putting a tiny bit of raspberry jam in them and they were  amazing.

Very good and pretty, but very rich.   Instead of crumbled oreo on top I used chocolate sprinkles, I think they made them much prettier.  They taste better after being chilled in the fridsge rather than room temp.  Great for gifts.

So easy but tastes like it comes from a gourmet bakery! I have made these numerous times for graduations, showers and wedding receptions! They're super easy to customize with colored chocolate to drizzle over them! Absolutely delicious, there are never any leftovers!

I made two different batches of these. One was just the regular cream cheese and Oreos. The other was a cream cheese, Oreos, and peanut butter mix, with a peanut butter and chocolate coating. MMMmm they both came out amazing! VERY sweet though. 
After mixing the cream cheese and Oreos together I threw the bowl in the freezer for a little while to harden a bit first. It makes it A LOT easier to dip in the chocolate when they are more firm. 
I melted the chocolate in the microwave.. you might want to let that cool off a little bit first before dipping them too. 
I don't think you really need to crush 9 whole cookies to sprinkle on top.. maybe just 5?
All in all these were delicious!

This recipe is delicious and easy to make.  With all the Oreo flavor variations, there are many different ways to go with this recipe.  My latest was the mint-flavored variety, and I used peppermint oil to add to the Hard Chocolate Glaze from this site to cover them with.  I dip them once into the Glaze using my old-time olive picker.  After they dry I dip the tops in again so I can use the crumbled cookies I had set aside.  If you are only dipping the tops, seven cookies is enough to set aside.  These are delicious!

I want to hate these evil little things because they were a good amount of effort, but they were TOO GOOD! Made the truffles exactly as the recipe indicated (though I did chill them before dipping them in the chocolate) & took them to a wine tasting event.  At least 10 people came up to me and told me they were amazing (they went reaaaallly well paired with a chanti the wine house was serving) - thanks for sharing!  :)

Loved it!!  I mixed the cookies in the food processor, then I put into my stand mixer to add the cream cheese.  The 'dough' formed the balls nicely immediately after mixing.  Then, I put the balls in the freezer for about 3 hours.  I used almond bark (melted in a double boiler - which I HIGHLY recommend) to coat.  I stuck a toothpick into the frozen ball, dipped/swirled into the melted choclate, pulled off the toothpick by turning the coated ball upright (w/the toothpick coming out of the bottom), putting the toothpick between the times of the fork and slowly pulling UP with the fork.  Then, I eased the ball off of the fork onto waxed paper.  Since the balls are frozen, the coating sets up pretty quickly.  I drizzled melted Chocolate almond bark for aesthetics.   They look AND taste great!

These are so yummy and make a great gift, especially at Christmastime. I refrigerated the cream cheese and crumb combo for a day or two prior to coating with chocolate, but that was because I was distracted by other holiday preparations.  However, the firmness of the mix helped in making the little spheres.  I used a mix of chocolate chips and squares of baking chocolate, and I felt that it was too thick to dip the balls in, so I added a little unsalted butter and that helped greatly.  I'm not a fan of using wax or coating chocolate... I find it too waxy tasting or feeling.  Butter work really well, but I did keep all the treats in the refrigerator until time to eat them or give them away, they would have softened up too much at room temperature.

These came out so great.  People thought I had bought them.  Instead of putting the crumbled Oreo on top of the truffles, I drizzled white chocolate on top (I also did a batch where I dipped the balls in white chocolate and drizzled with milk chocolate).  They came out wonderfully!

Great and easy recipe! I tried to make this a little more low-fat by using reduced fat Oreos and light cream cheese. I think you cannot taste any difference! I used all the Oreos, not reserving the 9 crushed cookies, and used a hand mixer to blend the crumbs and cream cheese. I rolled the cookie mixture into balls and put them in the freezer on a tray for about 30 minutes. For chocolate (instead of Bakers semi-sweet), I used the meltable candy-making milk chocolate wafers you can buy at craft stores or party stores.  I find melting chocolate chips makes for a grainy mess and I didn't have bakers chocolate.  The melting wafers made it so much easier.  I used the technique where I placed the Oreo ball on a fork and used a tablespoon to coat the ball right over the bowl of melted chocolate. Then I transferred the coated ball to the wax paper with a toothpick.  The chocolate hardened quickly, and I opted to take out the toothpicks.  This left a small hole on top of each truffle, so I made some white decorator icing and covered the top with a white swirl.  They look professional and taste awesome!

I give it a solid 2, maybe close to 3 star.  I don't know what I did but they turned out horribly wrong.  Literally, the only thing I can taste is cream cheese and nothing else!  Crushed & mixed cookie/cream cheese. Chilled 20min. Shaped into tsp balls. Chilled 45min - 1hr. Dipped in melted chocolate (maybe chocolate too hot?) & some of them broke apart and melted when they came in contact with the chocolate. Rolled/sprinkled with crushed oreo's & a couple with cocoa powder.

I made these for two different gatherings during the holidays and they were a hit both times. The second time I experimented with Mint Oreo and white chocolate coating - delish! These will definitely remain in my recipe box for a long time!

Really yummy. And so easy, this is a keeper. i sprinkled cookie crumbs on one batch, sea salt on another and a combo of crumbs and salt on a third batch. All were well-received and tasted like gourmet truffles...if only they knew.. : ) Thanks!

Super easy and delicious. Also addictive. I had no problem with using double stuff oreos. And I used white chocolate instead of semi-sweet or milk chocolate. 10x better!

These were a HUGE hit. I made them for a new years eve party, and everyone raved about them. Mind you, I showed up and there was a huge table of desserts that were store bought and I didnt think theyd even be noticed, but they were gone in a few hours! When making them, I bought a package of semisweet chocolate, and  also a package of reese's peanut butter morsales. Such a disaster trying to melt the reeses chips! They were gobby and did not work as well as the choc chips.

These are super easy to make. I originally made them for a friends birthday party, everyone kept asking where I bought them from. I made them with mint oreos as suggested by other people, much better then the boring plain ones. and I also made some with vanilla flavored almond bark they looked "fancy" with chocolate sprinkled on top. I have since made them several times and will be making them again! I will try with peanut butter cookeis next time as someone suggested.

Made a half batch (weighted the oreos) and it turned out perfect.  The only change I made was to use white chocolate candy coating and froze the balls before dipping.  Everyone loved them!!!

These are really good and very easy! (And a great use for Oreos that might have gotten a little not so crispy!) I dipped half in chocolate and rolled the other half in crushed pretzels. They were both good but the pretzels got soft after storing...they were great immediately after making though!

A big fan of Oreos but was slightly disappointed by the truffles. I thought the taste was quite dull? It was still good, but I guess I had higher expectations since Oreo cookies are like the bomb! 

As for the "easiness," I'm not expert at cooking so I had trouble with this especially the process of "dipping the balls in chocolate." That process did not end up the way it was described as I ended up using a fork to hold the ball and yeah..Maybe I didn't  melt the chocolate correctly..yeah I don't know. But it did turn out decent. Enjoy!

I suggest that everyone makes these!! They are so simple to make and taste so freaking good. I also strongly suggest that you make these the day before. There is no comparisan. If I had to rate the the same day, I would give them only 3 stars. also, you MUST cool them in the fridge before coating them in chocolate.

I've made these a few times now. Every time I make them, I double the recipe and they get gobbled up quickly. I always get requests for the recipe/ to make them again for other get-togethers. I use both white and milk chocolate chips and both combos taste great. It is a little bit time consuming but well worth it. I would suggest firming up the balls before dipping them in the fridge so they don't fall apart and make sure the chocolate is smooth before dipping so that the end product isn't clumpy. All in all, great recipe! Make sure you have milk on hand cause these things are rich.

Great recipe! I threw the cream cheese in the processor after I made a mess trying to mix the crumbles and cheese in a bowl. It mixed perfectly when turned on low. When covering the balls, I tried a fork and a spoon and eventually ended up just using two spoons. Definitely chill the balls for about 15 minutes before dunking. I left half of the batch in the refrigerator while I covered the first half with chocolate. The balls are much less mushy this way. I also drizzled them with white chocolate since I don't like the look of the crumbled oreos. I made the mistake of using the microwave to heat up the white chocolate and ended up burning it so I tried again using the double boiler method. I'm messy when I cook, so I was completely covered in chocolate before they were finished! This was too much fun to make!!

These were very simple, but a little messy. I think the oreo/cream cheese mixture would be easier to handle if chilled. I used a wooded scewer to dip the balls in the chocolate. Topped with red and green jimmies instead of crushed cookies.

Easy, fun, and delicious! Everyone loves these! I didn't have any trouble with the truffle falling apart during the dipping process...I chilled the balls in the fridge for an hour before dipping, used forks to scoop out of chocolate, and placed in little truffle baking cups. I used my food processor to crush the cookies and only used 34 cookies. I then used my mixer with the cookie paddle to mix the cream cheese in with the Oreo crumbs. Dough formed into balls easily. My 3 year old daughter helped for the balls. I told her just like rolling play-dough!  It was a fun project for us to do.

These are VERY good and extremely easy to make. I made the recipe as stated and ADDED 1 1/2 teaspoons of Vanilla. I didn't have to refrigerate my dough prior to rolling into balls like many of the other reviews. I used a melon baller to get uniform size balls. After forming into balls I did refrigerate for maybe 20 minutes just to set back up after warming in my hands. It wasn't very messy coating these with chocolate either. I didn't use the famous "spoon" method. I had one clean hand to pick up the new balls and place into the chocolate bowl and my other hand rolled the ball around in the chocolate, once coated I picked up with my fingers and shook to get excess off and placed onto wax paper lined cookie sheet. Then drizzled with white chocolate. VERY good and they melt in your mouth. Thanks for the recipe, I will be making these again.

Made them last night. Super easy and delicious! My brother doesn't like chocolate-dipped treats so we set a few aside and covered them in frosting. VERY yummy!

Yummy! My son surprised me with this treat (he loves Oreos so he made a double batch!)  He used a white chocolate to dip them in which made them very pretty on the Christmas cookie plate.  Will have to add these to my annual cookie/candy list!

I have been making these for a couple of years now and I have tell you it is the easiest and most delightful.   When making more than one batch, I will use flavored cream cheese, such as Strawberry flavor.  Very good!

These could not have been easier to make!  For Christmas, I used peppermint oreos to give them a festive flavor.  My friends and co-workers raved over them!  :)  Def would recommend!

This recipe is divine....but you should also try doing this same recipe but use Mint Oreos.  What a fantastic taste.  I also found that after rolling the mix (pre-choc cover) they rolled easier in the melted chocolate, if I put them in the freezer for about 8-10 minutes.  Then roll in the choc bark.  The truffles are also perfect, frozen!

These are a big hit with the kids!!!  I always use Double Stuffed Oreos; i see another reviewer said it's really messy and don't use them, but I've never had a problem.  Try it with the MINT OREOS!!!  To die for!!!!

Super easy to make.  Just be sure to chill the balls before putting the melted chocolate on.  Definitely use two spoons to get the chocolate on the ball.  Place the ball on the spoon and use the 2nd spoon the pour the chocolate. Then pass the ball to the other spoon.  This will keep the ball from falling apart.

Easiest way to dip, is to make and freeze balls then dip in chocolate as they will be very easy to handle and the chocolate will firm up faster as well. Very nice addition to my christmas cookie plate

Do yourself a huge favor> make sure your cream cheese is super soft then refrigerate the oreo/cream cheese mix/balls before you even attempt dipping these suckers in chocolate. Man will that save you some frustration!!

I have made these since 2007 and they are a hit with everyone!  So easy and economical to make too! Add mint flavoring for a minty chocolate truffle, or I have also used cherry extract or cherry juice, just a little, for an different flavor)!

Delicious and rich! The only thing I did different was to use white chocolate since there was so much chocolate already, and eliminated the sprinkles (which left me some extra Oreos to munch on). White chocolate isn't as creamy and didn't cover very evenly, so the chocolate drizzle was added for presentation, because it's all about presentation, right? :)  But they are awesome!

Easy to make and yummy to eat. BONUS: They LOOK like they took a lot of effort! I only save 4-5 cookies for the topping. That is more than enough. I crush oreos a couple handfuls at at time in a blender. It goes super fast. While I'm doing that, I let the baking chocolate melt in my mini crockpot. The chocolate melts smooth and stays melted as I dip the oreo balls. I've never refrigerated the balls prior to dipping (why add an extra step & more time?). I've never had a problem just dipping them at room temp.

This is a GREAT recipe.  It was very easy for me to make with my kids, and the falvor turned out wonderful.  We have kept them stored in the fridge, and that keeps the truffle from melting.  The whole family loves them!

Great recipe! My aunt gave it to me. Just a few hints that I find helpful. When rolling the mixture into balls, I like to use gloves. It doesnt stick to the gloves, like it does on your hands. After rolling, place on a pan and place them in the freezer. It helps them from falling apart when you coat them with the chocolate.

Delicious! i love the moist/soft/gooey center. Although they are really rich they taste very good.  Tip: Put in freezer while melting chocolate so that they can harden. It makes dipping A LOT easier.

I agree regarding the almond bark.  That is my coating of choice :) Then they become Oreo "Snowballs".  One tip I will give though...When giving them as a gift(i.e. goodie basket, etc.), make sure the person receiving them knows to keep them refrigerated.  I gave some years ago and the person called me after 4 days of them being on the counter and said "There is something REALLY wrong with these white things"...live and learn!

Can't really mess this up. I put each ball on a toothpick and dipped just until it was all covered in white chocolate. Looks fun and tastes yummy.

I make these every Christmas. I made them for my son when he graduated from boot camp and after her gave some to his platoon brothers I had twenty new Marines calling me Mom. I do however use all the Oreo crumbs in the recipe and dip them in the white almond bark then drizzle with chocolate. I use a teaspoon to dip out the amount for the ball and it makes it a perfect size truffle.

These are sooo good. Very rich, but a great gift for any chocolate lover! I used my smallest cookie scoop (abt a tbsp and a half) to make them all the same size. Wish I had an even smaller one because these are almost too rich to eat a whole one by yourself at the size suggested. I didn't have any problems forming them into balls right after mixing it all together, but I did refrigerate them for a couple of hours after forming into balls.  I used Hershey's Milk Chocolate Chips. The chocolate bark didn't work well for me. It hardened to quickly because I was dipping cold truffles into it. It took me a couple tries to get them “pretty” when I was pulling them out of the chocolate. Don't get discouraged... it just takes a little practice. (My hubby didn't mind eating the "ugly" ones! Ha ha)   These taste best if you leave them sit out for 10-15 minutes before eating. Using forks to pull out of the melted chocolate worked great! These were even better the next day when the cookie crumbs had a chance to soften. ***UPDATE 01-18-11*** Bought a 1.5 tsp scoop. PERFECT SIZE! You might wanna halve the batch because this smaller scoop made almost 100 truffles (I think it was like 94).

I've been making these for years and EVERYONE loves them. I use mint oreos in the filling and crushed candy canes sprinkled on the tops for Christmas.

I have been makin these for a couple years now.  This year I got original Oreo's, chocolate Oreo's, and mint Oreo's.  I always use milk chocolate then drizzle with white chocolate.  Since I have 3 different kinds, I'll drizzle the original with white, then put green food coloring in the white chips for the mint and blue for the chocolate flavored Oreo's.  SOmething a little different:)

Just made these and they were super easy!  I was a little worried about covering them in chocolate after reading all of the reviews, but my method worked wonderfully.  I ended up getting 48 balls out of this recipe.  First I allowed the balls to chill for 2 hours.  You probably don't need that long, but I had other things to do and the timing worked out perfectly.  I melted the baker's chocolate in a glass bowl in the microwave per the instructions on the box.  I only melted one box at first, and it ended up covering the majority of the balls.  In the end, I ended up using 2 additional squares from the second box, & it was the perfect amount, but if you want to be sure you will definitely have enough chocolate I would recommend using 3 squares from the second box.  To cover the balls in chocolate I simply put the ball in the bowl of melted chocolate, used a spoon to stir it around & cover it, then fished it out using the spoon and placed it on the cookie sheet & wax paper.  I sprinkled crushed oreos on top of 24 of them, then I melted some white chocolate and used a ziploc bag to drizzle the other 24 with white chocolate.  Both kinds turned out beautifully!  These things are delicious, look like you bought them at a gourmet chocolate shop, and are a guest favorite!

Love it - especially when I use the mint oreos and the white chocolate! (Peanut butter also is a nice change).  We had a difficult time at first dipping the truffles and making them look nice, but I think we've found a system.  After creating the balls, put them in the freezer for at least 20 minutes.  Cover a piece of foam (crafting or one out of an appliance box will do) with waxpaper, use toothpicks to pierce the bottom of the ball and dip while still cold, then poke into the foam to cool.  We started pulling from the freezer in small batches and it worked much better.  The truffles weren't falling apart in the chocolate and the coat was much nicer and smoother.  Very easy to pop out the toothpick.  We also liked to drizzle with another chocolate to differentiate between flavors.

Adorable and awesome! They are much easier to dip when they have been chilling in the refrigerator for a several hours. I drizzled them with white chocolate and put them in truffle boxes to give as gifts to my friends and family who hosted my baby shower. Everyone loved them! So delicious :)

Wow! How can something with so few [basic] ngredients taste like it came out of a fancy chocolate shop? These are to die for!!! Takes some work when it comes to coating them in the chocolate... most of the work involves not eating as you go!!!

These are simple and get rave reviews!  I used 1/3 fat cream cheese, which worked just fine, and almond bark.  Also used suggestions from other reviewers to refrigerate the mix before making into balls and after making into balls.

DECADENT!  I can't believe how easy they were to make.  I mixed them up pretty quick.  Rolling the balls took me awhile but I did do 4 different batches.  I chilled them for an hour as recommended by others and then coated them.  I made the oreo ones and the peanut butter ones, but I also took it a notch further and used strawberry cream cheese with vanilla cookies and then did pineapple cream cheese with coconut cookies and rolled them in coconut flakes.  Absolutely amazing how nice they turn out!  I dipped some in dark chocolate and some in regular semi-sweet chocolate and then somein powdered sugar.  I can't wait to show them off at the baby shower.  I will be sure to post a pic!  Thank you for sharing the recipe it is a favorite in my kitchen now!  (P.S.  I save a few back of each and am keeping them in the freezer and will dip them later for Valentine's day to suprise my Hubby since he has been tasting all afternoon and loves them!)
UPDATE:  I added a photo- I used them to decorate around the shower cake that I made - it looked incredible and everyone RAVED about what a great idea!

Maybe it's because this was my first time making truffles but these were not worth all of the effort.  The centers were difficult to work with as they had the consistantcy of bread dough only oilier and not as stiff.  When I tried to coat them with chocolate they started slipping throuht the lines of the fork which would cause bits of it to fall into the chocolate and being so fine, would have to be mixed in.  I ended up using a spoon and just spread chocolate while they were still on the wax paper which I could only do after being in the fridge all day so that they were hard enough but after 14 or so minutes, they would go back to being doughy.  I couldn't coat the bottoms unless I went back and did it after they had hardened.  It was extremely messy and I will most likely not be using this recipe again.

These were crazy good.  I used 60% bittersweet chocolate on half and semi-sweet on the other half.  People seemed to favor the bittersweet.  Also, rolling them with forks did not work for me.  I ended up just using my hands and got far prettier results.

I know this recipe says "easy" but all my friends and I think they are a PAIN to make because it takes  so much time to roll and dip them.  They are worth the effort at least a couple of times a year though because they are really good and really rich!

Wow! These were awesome! I took some tips here and made three different batches. One as written, one with Nutter butters and 2 butterfingers, and one as written with a package of thin mints thrown in. They were all wonderful. My personal favorite was the mint batch.

I put the balls in the fridge to harden prior to dipping them in chocolate. After being in the fridge I rolled them again before dipping and they came out nice and round.

Although this recipe was rich, decadent, and sinfully pleasurable, I had to give it 4 stars purely for the hassle it put me through!  I wouldn't necessarily call this "easy".  That or else I just have a chocolate melting and coating handicap.  Since it claims to be "Easy" I thought this would be the perfect PMS reliever.  When actually it was the cause of more grief!  A) they were a mess to form into balls (and yes, I did refrigerate the dough) and B)My chocolate did not melt and coat as beautifully as the other pictures.  Way too much of a mess.  I will probably not attempt again.  But they were good!

WOW these are incredible! my family are big chocolate lovers and they feel in love with these amazingly rich and easy truffles. Instead of crushing cookie crumbs on top of the truffles I used Non-pareils holiday sprinkles to make them a little more festive.

These are a holiday favorite. Suggest dividing your batch into a few smaller bowls and add some "big kids" flavoring....raspberry liquior, orange liquior, rum ect.  If you find the standard recipe tastes too much like cream cheese or like Oreos (go figure), these flavor additions are likely to win you over.

I have made these now with mint Oreos , White Chocolate Oreos , these are so easy and rich, a little goes a long way, great Christmas Candy with just a little colored icing drizzled on top, I did not sprinkle Cookie on after dipping in Chocolate ,You need to be fast for that but a drizzle of white chocolate makes them really shine.

These are amazingly easy and delicous! I made them to recipe and loved them. Then I got creative and dipped them into mint chocolate and sprinkled a few red decoratifs (small red drages) on the tip top. Sooooooooo pretty and perfect for Christmas. I enjoyed the minty with the chocolate center. Thanks for this recipe. It's a keeper!

I used melt canned frosting(any flavor) in the microwave to dip mine.  Before dipping, pinch one end to make them more almond shaped, put two slivered almonds in the pointier end and dip. Then pipe 2 eyes and a nose on the pointy end and a curvy tail on the other and you have Merry Christmouses.

These are fantastic, and so easy.  I was afraid they would be too sweet, but they were just perfect.  One note - don't try to make double the recipe in one bowl.  Make one batch at a time.  I tried to save time (even though they are quick to make anyway), and it was impossible to mix them properly, so I had to keep them in the freezer so they wouldn't fall apart.  Stick to one batch at a time and they are perfect.

These truffles are absolutely PERFECT!  I didn't reserve extra crumbs for decorating, but I did coat in dark chocolate almond bark and drizzle with white chocolate.  I will probably do the opposite next time as I think white chocolate/white almond bark would taste delicious on these already awesome candies.  The almond bark is a bit cheaper and it is fast to simply pop it in the microwave for a quick melting.  I made them for my family and my husband's family at Thanksgiving, and they were devoured before I could get out of the kitchen.  If the cookie/cream cheese mix is too soft, pop it in the fridge for about 20 minutes before rolling them into balls.  Although the balls will look small when you first make them up, they really get bigger when they are dipped in chocolate.  These are definetly going to be a regular addition to my Christmas candy plates.  (I am making them with peppermint bark, peanut butter ritz dipped in chocolate, chocolate pretzels, and "puppy chow" mix)  Since making the oreo truffles for my family, several of them have already made it again for themselves at home.  I thought I love peanut butter balls the best, but oreo truffles are now my favorite holiday treat!

I make these all the time -- my boyfriend begs me to make them! I don't normally top mine with crumbs though. Also, I use the fat-free cream cheese because it's easier to mix with the Oreos. Try using mint or peanut butter oreos - taste just like your favorite Girl Scout cookies!

Excellent, and easy! Make sure to freeze the balls before dipping, so they don't fall apart in the chocolate.

So easy and very delicious. As someone else said do not use double stuff Oreos if you chill or freeze the balls they hold together better. 
I do the same when I make cake pops.

The balls are good but I didn't give it a 5 star because I find it simply taste like an "Oreo"!!  Nothing special.  I used the exact ingredients stated in the recipe.  I did the following and they were not messy at all and perfect in appearance.  1.)  I used my food processor to chop the oreos then I added the Cream cheese to the food processor.  I left it on chop until all of the oreos were completely mixed with the cream cheese.  2)  Using a 1 tbsp measuring spoon, I scooped a heaping spoonful of mixture (packing it against the side of the bowl) then popped it out on the edge of the ball.  I placed them on a tray covered in wax paper.  I then stuck toothpicks in them to allow me to hold it while dipping.  3 )I put them in the freezer for about 45 minutes.  4) After freezing, melt chocolate in a dish deep enough to cover the ball when dipped.  I used a measuring cup.  Melt chocolate only until smooth (in attempt to keep the temperature as low as possible).  5) ONLY remove a few balls at a time.  Use toothpick to dip into chocolate.  Place on a tray.  6) Sprinkle crushed oreos on top while chocolate is still soft (bc they will not stick later).    7) Once balls have hardened, gently pull out toothpicks.  Suggestion:  Do not leave balls on counter too long.  If you keep them i the refrigerator, they will hold and remain hard enough to eat without messy fingers!!!  ENJOY!

I just tried making these last night and everyone loves them. For half of them though, I took the cream out of my leftover oreos, balled each individual piece up, and then molded the oreo/cream cheese mixture around them before dipping them in the chocolate. I wasn't sure how well that would turn out, but it ended up being perfect, and those ones are everyone's favorite.

mhmmm! I love, LOVE these oreo truffles. I would make these all the time if I could! :) BUT here is what I did:
I crushed about 32 oreo cookies for the mixture, and three more for the topping. I used a 12 ounce pack of the semi-sweet chocolate instead. It was ALMOST enough (I had rolled 54 balls from the oreo+cream cheese batter/mix, but my mother kept taking my oreo & cream cheese balls!!)  for melting the chocolate, I had a medium saucepan about 1/3 full of water, and put a bowl on top to melt my chocolate in. I put about 5 of the balls into the bowl of chocolate, and used a rubber spatula to cover them with chocolate (& make sure that you hurry bc it starts to fall apart, and the chocolate hardens!) I used a fork to grab it and put it onto mini cupcake liners. I was able to dip about only 38 of the balls into the melted semi-sweet chocolate the rest had disappeared. I had topped mine off with oreo crumbs, melted white chocolate, melted white chocolate and oreo crumbs, and some I just left without toppings.

This recipe is really sweet, and goodness, it's so easy to do with so little ingredients. I will definitely make more in the future!

These are so easy and seem like you must have spent forever making them. Make sure you chill/freeze well before dipping in chocolate.

O...M...G...sooo good and so rich, nobody could guess they were made with only cookie crumbs and cream cheese! Very elegant looking when you drizzle with white chocolate and put them in little baby cupcake papers.  Can't wait to experiement with other suggested flavors. Thanks!

This is going to be my favorite recipe, I had made this for party and everyone's jaw dropped when I told them this is homemade. It was a sure crowd pleaser. Next time I am going to add a pinch of salt because I found it very sweet or use bitter chocolate instead of semisweet chocolate.

These are so good and easy to make. Perfect for a Halloween party. I didn't srpinkle them with crumbs instead I drizzled melted white chocolate over the set chocolate dipped truffles, which made them very pretty. I used organic "oreos" instead.

I get requests for these at least once a week, however you MUST put the balls in the refrigerator or freezer before trying to dip them. It also helps to add a little oil to the melted chocolate to smooth it out. They taste a lot better when you haven't shed tears trying to make them - I speak from experience. :)

These are delicious and a big hit with my husband. He actually brought the recipe to me one day and asked me to make it. He had it at a get together with other soldiers. This is the second time I've made it. The only thing sort of confusing about this recipe on here is that a regular thing of oreos doesn't have as many oreos in it as the recipe says. It says crush 9 oreos, set aside, and then crush remaining 36 oreos. There aren't even 36 oreos in the whole thing even with the same ounce bag of regular oreos, so I panicked at first when I only had one thing of oreos, but it still worked perfect. I'm actually making them right now for my hubby's birthday tomorrow. I couldn't find the recipe he brought home to me but it's the same on here and I always love to refer to this website :)

Oh, and we also cover half in flaked coconut. The biggest problem is that one is never enough....

I love this recipe because it is very easy to make and you can become super creative with the recipe. For mine I dipped the oreo truffles in melted milk chocolate, peanut butter, butter scotch and white chocolate. Just make sure that you don't let the chocolate over heat because it will solidify!

These recipes was time consuming and messy but well with it!  I followed a numberof others' recommendation to refrigerate the cookie cballs before covering with chocolate, and using a fork to dip the truffles in the chocolate and both worked well. The truffles were beautiful and tasted great.  I can't wait to try other cookies like Nutter Butters and Mint Oreos and other toppings like Nutella.

So easy and everyone always LOVES these - they never last more than a day.  I just throw an entire bag of oreos (usually double stuff since that's what we buy) in a ziplock freezer gallon bag - and smash away.  Then I throw it in a bowl with a block of cream cheese.... electric mixer... They are ready to roll right away.  I don't know if its the extra oreos or what, but I've never had a hard time rolling them in the chocolate.  Sometimes I'll roll them all out, and pop the pre-rolled balls in the fridge while I melt the chocolate (but not necessary) - just helps the chocolate set faster.

Delicious!  I used double stuffed oreos since I had those.  Mine were sticky, so I put in the freezer for a while before making the balls.  I, personally, have difficulty when dipping into the chocolate so mine were not "pretty" but still taste great. Can be a little time consuming, but worth the effort.

Easy and delicious!
I put the dough in the freezer for a couple of minutes after mixing to make it easy to form the balls. After making the balls, I put them in the freezer again to make the dipping easier. I use two forks when dipping; drop the ball in, roll it around, and pick up dripping the excess with the forks. They go into the freezer one last time to set. After that I enjoy them very much.

So dangerously delicious! I made these at Christmas time and haven't stopped craving them since. The extra crushed Oreos that you sprinkle on top isn't necessary… But it does look prettier. You have to make sure you sprinkle it right after you dip the Oreo balls in the chocolate though, or else it dries too fast and it won't stick to the chocolate. You don't need near as much chocolate as it says to coat the Oreo balls with either. I made a batch with regular Oreos and another with mint Oreos. They were just Kroger brand Oreos too and they were so good! I think I almost liked the mint ones even better. I made 1/4 batch today since we had some Oreos and cream cheese on hand. (Didn't want to get carried away and gain a ton of weight again)! :) I used 2 ounces of cream cheese and 9 Oreos and 1 little square of almond bark. I didn't use any Oreos to sprinkle on top this time. I formed them into 13 little balls with this batch. Can't wait to eat them!!! :)

Such an easy way to make a yummy dessert.  I actually used the peanut butter Oreos and subbed out 1/2 the chocolate for a bag of peanut butter chips.  Holy cow, these are addicitve.  Great recipe!

Add a couple teaspoons of vegetable oil to the melted chocolate..it will help with all the problems listed.  It will not change the taste of the chocolate and it will still harden up nicely.

Delish!  I chill the mixture before rolling into balls, then freeze the balls before dipping.   Adds to the prep time, but makes it easy.  I usually end up melting more chocolate for dipping than the recipe calls for.  The sprinkled crumbs on top didn't stick well for me, so I just skip that part.

Super recipe. If chocolate stiffens add a small swirl of honey and reheat and it should bring it back to smooth consistency. Also, for a more holiday taste you can use "peppermint or regular mint" oreos in the mix. Also, try using white chocolate for any that are allergic to the semi sweet or dark varieties.

Just made these for the second time and they are even better.  It definitely helps to let the mixture sit before you roll it into balls, it wasn't as gooey and easier to work with.  I also let them sit in the fridge for an hour before I dipped them. Putting about 1 tablespoon of Crisco helps the chocolate melt smoother (I used almond bark).  Using 2 forks to dip is something I wish I would've done the first time around: so much easier and not as messy! Hope this helps, enjoy!

I won't be making these too often because they are WAY TOO HARD to resist. Oh my gosh!!!! I don't have a food processer so I mixed everything by hand. I crumbled the cookies in a ziplock bag first, then used a sifter to make the crumbs finer and be a little easier to mix.

These are so easy to make and taste absolutely delicious! I've made them multiple times now and the only thing I change is the amount of cream cheese. I put 1,5 packages of Philadelphia instead of just 1 as I think it tastes more creamy like this. Other than that it is a great and easy recipe!

Excellent as written with the *must freeze before dipping* advice from all... but you've got to try these with Mint Oreos! I ran out of chocolate, so instead I rolled each ball in the crumbs then drizzled with chocolate. Woo Hoo! Tastes best when really cold.

I used Chocolate Oreos with the Peanut Butter Creme. I used 4 oz of Cream cheese and about the same amount of peanut butter. I dipped it in melted Ghirardelli milk chocolate! Delightful.

Everyone loved these.  They were easier and faster than the cake balls I made and they taste divine. I used chocolate almond bark with a tbsp of shortening (melted together in the microwave), and I placed them in the freezer for about an hour before dipping.  Amazing!  Thanks for the recipe...can't wait to try out the variations.

I substituted reduced fat oreos and 1/3 less fat philly cream cheese and these came out great, plus I felt alittle less guilty eating all of them.  half way through my dipping chocolate was starting to get difficult to dip in so I added some Bailey's to loosening it up.....the taste was sensational!!
Perfect little treat for your mouth!

I worried that the cream chz & oreo mix would be a sticky mess, but it wasn't a bit.  Freezin' the little balls before dipping in choc is key.

Wonderful.  Crushed Oreo's using a mini food prep.  I added small cubes of cream cheese to the food processor (basically enough to break break up the cream cheese) then used hands to fold the cream cheese into rest of the Oreo.  Refrigerate for an hour before rolling into balls.

My family loves these Oreo Truffles, especially my cousin, she could eat a whole batch herself! But i use vanilla chocolate instead of white chocolate, i think that it taste alot better! I had to make alot of christmas goodies in 2 days so i made these oreo truffles and hey loved them so much, they were very pleased with them! So i recomend the truffles for all your partys, they taste good and are very cheap to make!

This may be the easiest and yet glam holiday cookie, yet! I took these to a holiday cookie swap and they were a major hit. To add a modern touch, sprinkle with coarse salt for the salted-chocolate lovers out there. Also try "Golden Oreos" and white chocolate. Great recipe!

make sure the oreos are crushed really fine, use all the oreos, otherwise it tastes too much like cream cheese.

My family loves these.  I changed the recipe up by using almond bark instead of baking chocolate.  I have made several different version of the recipe by change the type of cookies.  Regular Oreo cookies dipped vanilla almond bark, Mint Oreo cookies dipped in vanilla amond bark, Vanilla Oreo cookies dipped in chocolate almond bark and
Nutter Butter Peanut Butter cookies dipped in chocolate almond bark. My families favorite is the Mint Oreo.

Okay these were a huge hit. I made goody bags for people that I work with and for people that my husband works with and I was getting instant messages all day with "OMG". My husband said I needed to make at least 60 more bags next year, because people that were not in his department came up to him wanting truffles. These were easy to make and I will be making them again soon. Awesome recipe.

These were good. I used two forks to cover them in chocolate (used almond bark). Refrigerated after covering them, then took them out for everyone to try and they ended up "sweating" I guess. There was a small amount of liquid that oozed out...maybe something I did wrong? But they tasted yummy!

OMG OMG OMG@ These were FANTASTIC. I added 3/4 tsp of orange flavoring.... YAY! Love those chocolate oranges at the holidays? that's exactly the flavor but in one of the best truffles I have ever eaten. Definitely worth trying (again and again).

Love this recipe. One suggestion: after you form the balls, stick them in the fridge for 30min-hr. This helps keep them from falling apart when diped in the melted chocolate

DELICIOUS!  Made these with my son's girlfriend.  They came together quickly as I used the food processor to crush the cookies.  This gave a even, smooth texture to the truffles.  We blended the cookies and cream cheese in the mixer and made the texture even more creamy. I used candy making discs by Wilton, in vanilla and milk chocolate.  The vanilla was so pretty with the cookie crumbles on top! We did think that 9 cookies for the topping was WAY too much with all we had left over.  Would reduce that to 4 cookies next time and just add the rest to the cream cheese mixture. 
I recommend popping the formed balls into the freezer for 15 minutes prior to dipping.  This helps the chocolate to stick much better.  We used 2 forks to dip and transfer the coated balls.  Worked far better than a toothpick!  No doubt these will be made often!

I have been making these for quite some time now. I like to add about a 1/3 cup of Kaluha.  Also, I use Wilton candies.  They melt really well and come in many different colors.  Fun for the holidays!

HOLY HOLY THINGS I CAN"T SAY!!  Had this two days ago at a family wedding.  I've had them before, I think most everyone present had, but here was the kicker... the cook used STRAWBERRY Oreos for the truffles!  It was completely out of this world and I have never tasted the likes of it.  My husband keeps laughing at me because on our way back from the wedding I kept zoning out in the car.  He thought something was wrong but I was just lost in truffle-thought.  Lol!  You MUST try these with strawberry!

This really deserves 5 starts...so easy and so impressive!

I followed the recipe EXCEPT I added a couple of tablespoons of shortening to the melting chocolate; a trick I learned to make really smooth chocolate when making chocolate covered strawberries and pretzels.

Who doesn't love a recipe with only 3 ingredients???  I can't wait to try variations suggested in the other reviews!

The only critique was rolling the truffles in the chocolate. It was very messy and the overall result on the truffle was sloppy.

I made a variety of toppings including toasted coconut and expresso powder. I took instant expresso and ground in the processor then sprinkled on the truffle.

These were absolutely delicious! I've made them quite a few times now, and they never fail! I've always used the regular oreos. DO NOT add anything to the melting chocolate. It'll only make it thinner and you won't have much of a chocolate coating on the outside. If you love oreos and chocolate, definitely make these. You'll probably need a glass of milk afterwards! :)

I didn't change a single thing in this recipe and it was phenomenal!! I made these for a family reunion this weekend and was crowned the "chef" of the family! Like I had read in some reviews, it is a bit time consuming, but only to make them look "pretty"; if I didn't have to concentrate on the presentation side of it, it would have gone a lot faster. Either way they were delicious and I will definitely keep these as my go to recipe to impress my guests!

Delicious!!  I used semi sweet chocolate chips instead of the bakers bar because they were cheaper, they worked great.  I can’t wait to try with peanut butter and mint Oreos.

Theses truffles are delicious! And very simple to make. I made a few changes that work great. 1. After forming the balls I freeze them for 20 minutes so they are nice and cold when trying to dip them in the chocolate. 2. I have also used Bakers dipping chocolate that comes in the microwaveable cup instead of the semi-sweet. It taste great and the chocolate dries rather quickly. 3. I only use the double stuff oreos since they taste creamer and they turn out the same as the originals.

Beautiful and delicious!  I recommend melting some white chocolate chips in a ziplock bag, cutting off the bottom corner of the bag, and using it to drizzle white chocolate across the tops of some of these. Thanks for this recipe--it's significantly easier than any other truffle recipe I've come across and just as yummy.  Can't wait to try it with mint oreos!

Delicious! These are messy to make, but super yummy! I used vanilla flavored almond bark instead of chocolate to coat them. For the cookie, I made some with Oreo's and some with Keebler chocolate chip cookies. Both were really good! Before I coated them I put them in the fridge for an hour. To coat them I used a fork to dip them into the melted almond bark.

Super yummy! Everyone in my crew loved it. I have lots of people asking for the recipe! It takes about 1 oz of chocolate for every 2 truffles I found. I used a spoon, and just dumped it in my bowl of chocolate and pulled it out extra chocolatey. Thank you! Will make again!

These are fantastic and easy to make!!! As I was reading the reviews I saw alot of complaints about the dipping process...I think the key is to make sure the oreo balls are very chilled...I put mine in the freezer for at least an hour before dipping, and I used almond bark...They came out great, did not fall apart, and no oreo crumbs left behind in the chocolate!!! All in all a great recipe!! Thank You!

These are so simple and delicious! My daughter made them for her "Thank You" bags when she had her baby. A couple of these in a little plastic bag tied up with ribbon looked so special. Instead of using bakers chocolate, she used melted semi sweet chips. She also dipped 1/2 of them in melted white chocolate instead of the semi chocolate. The contrasting color balls carry on the Oreo cookie theme. Everyone loved them!!

These are soo good! I've made them twice, and both times I have gotten great compliments. The first time I used regular oreos, but the second time I used mint oreos. They were beyond delicious! I have a very hard time with the chocolate coating so I usually just dip the tops of the truffles into chocolate. It still tastes the same = Amazing!

These were super easy to make, but very time consuming.  The chocolate step was the most time consuming part.  I did mix the cookies and the cream cheese in my Ninja processor, made the balls, and then chilled in the fridge for an hour first.  I sprinkled the chocolate dipped truffles with additional crushed cookies.  Everyone at the party gobbled them up.  I'll have to give the Nutter Butter ones a try!

VERY Rich!
We made the recipe as is & had way too much material. Next time we'll use 1/2 the box of oreos & only 1 box of chocolate squares, or maybe 9 or 10 squares instead of 16. Tip- make sure your melted chocolate is cool before you dip or it slides right off the truffle.

These were very tasty and there is many variations you can be creative with. They were very rich in chocolate flavor and I loved the texture. They were a hit at the party I took them to. Nobody could figure out what was inside of them that made them so yummy!

These are delicious!  I made them exactly as written in the recipe.  That being said, I will make one change next time.  Instead of dipping in melted Baker's chocolate, I'll buy the melting chocolate that you get at a craft store that is meant to be used to coat treats.

So wonderful!!  I made these for my baby shower and they were great.  My guests and I enjoyed the flavor.  I had to buy Nestle Tollhouse chocolate morsales and it was too think and difficult to work with, but I had to use it because it was all I had.  So, I don't reccomend using chocolate chips to coat these in.  I will be making these again, but with the correct chocolate for dipping.

Very good, and easy with the exception of the melted chocolate step. And even with that trouble, they look very pretty. My only small issue is the texture. It's bordering on mushy/crumbly, when I want it to be creamy. I'll tweak it and try again. Possibly more cream cheese will help...

I dipped these in white chocolate instead of semi-sweet and then decorated them as eyeballs for Halloween. They were a big hit! Would definitely make again and try with the semi-sweet chocolate.

My family loves these! They can't wait for special occasions to roll around because they know Oreo Truffles are coming! Very easy to make, but don't use any other brand but Oreo. They just don't turn out as good.

OH MY GOSHHH!! These are so awesome--and easy!! Lately, I've been fixated on making cake balls (per Bakerella book Cake Pops) but they take hours to make. These truffles, in my opinion, taste just as good and are whole heck of a less hassle! I crushed (food processor) up one entire package of reduced fat Oreos and then bought 2 packages of Reeses PB Cups (the ones that come in packages of 6 and are usually on sale for $1). I crushed up the cups and oreos and mixed them together (saving some oreo crumbs for topping later) making pb cup oreo balls. I ended up not needing to refrigerate/freeze them because the balls had a good consistency. We have an old wire with the octagon base that we used to use to dye easter eggs, but now I use it to put the balls into chocolate bark and take back out again. Really useful. Anyways, I bought red chocolate bark and after all the dipping and everything, sprinkled with leftover oreo...they looked really good with a red/black thing going on! : ) Refrigerated them until time to serve---they're better cold!.

I have never made truffles of any kind before and I'm SO glad I tried these! I spend so much money on truffles for myself and for guests and gifts. These truffles are better than any store bought ones I have ever had! They are also so simple to make. They didn't have the Oreo taste I was expecting, so if you aren't a die hard chocoholic you might not like these. However, if you love chocolate and you need an easy recipe, this is your best bet. The best part is, they are easy to make, inexpensive to make, very delicious and they make an absolutely elegant treat. Perfect for parties or guests! Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe!

Family thought they were gourmet! I rolled the ball in crushed Oreo's immediately after dipping in chocolate and that tasted great. White chocolate was great for the outer shell also. Love the recipe, so simple! Definitely refrigerate before dipping in chocolate for best results.

I made these for a party and they went fast!!!!  I did use some of the suggestions: put them in the freezer about 15 minutes before dipping them in chocolate, I used 2 forks to dip in the chocolate (I dropped the ball in and then used the forks to roll them around and pick them up and out), I used wax paper to keep them on). This turned out great!!!!!!  My friends would like me to put cherries in the middle...didn't know if that would work!  I will have to give it a try!  I also used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of bakers chocolate, it is cheaper!

These are out of this world good. 

I dipped mine in special dark chocolate and left them sitting in the refrigerator for about 3 days before eating them. My husband and I did not like them at all when they had only been in the fridge for a day, they had an odd taste to them until they had sat there for a few days.

I made these with tofutti "better than cream cheese" to make them dairy free.  The consistency was easy to work with.   I had no problem rolling the balls.  I didnt want to bother with the chocolate coating so I just rolled them in the reserved cookie crumbs and that worked perfectly.  These are quick and other people loved them but for me they taste like pre-chewed oreos.  best served chilled.

I had these at a superbowl party and made them for Valentines day. OMG these little balls are so Delish! I covered some in white chocolate and others in semi sweet. I prefered the white choclate. I think next time I will put them in the fridge to harden before covering in choc. Will def make these little bites of heaven again!

These were awesome!  I would say you need more oreos though, or less cream cheese.  I covered these with white chocolate and sprinkled some crushed oreos on top - divine.  Thank you for this delicate easy recipe!!

they are totally awesome. the only thing i did different was only made four oreo and cream cheeze balls so i shorted the recipe and only used 9 oreos and took the cream in the middle of the oreos out of two of them for  sprinkling on the top! and heated up the cream cheeze and oreo mixture for a few seconds so it was easier to mix together... all in all this recipe is great

So easy and delicious!!!  Make sure you start to melt the chocolate using the lowest heat possible because when it starts to scorch, its all down hill from there.  I used dark chocolate and it was amazing!

I'm a beginner baker but these were so simple! After mixing ingredients, I made in to balls and let sit in my freezer for about 15 minutes. Held together well while dipping in the chocolate. A supervisor at my work said after I brought them in they were his new favorite desert!

This is the most awesome recipe...EVER.  To the people who say it's messy, or not firm...you MUST do this a food processor, crush the cookies till they look like dirt...then add the cream cheese and blend until it forms a ball of dough. You should have no problems rolling them.

Very good. I used a bag of milk and mint chocolate chips melted for outside and it made them just festive enough. I would like to try them with double stuffed just to see if it made them taste a tad better, but they are still very good like this.

These are very yummy, but I should have read the reviews before making them because I think it would have helped ALOT to chill the balls for an hour before dipping them.  We used the Mint Oreos instead and they are delicious and easy, great for all the Christmas parties :)

Phenomenal....I had these at a Christmas party yesterday and am now making them for an "Ugly Christmas Sweater Party" tonight.  My friend that made them did mention they were hard to cover in the chocolate...but I am going to try the previous suggestions of chilling the balls for an hour, then melting 1/2 the chococlate for 1/2 of the balls, then melt the other 1/2 and finish.  I think these are going to be a big hit!!

I added in a tsp. of vanilla extract to the cookie/cream cheese mixture, and dipped the chilled truffles in almond bark (white).  Family likes them, but to me, they just taste like a plain old Oreo.

Very tasty!  Thanx for the recipe!  I made some as the recipe states, and I made another batch adding 1-1/2 cups crushed peanut butter cereal and dusted with additional peanut butter cereal... turned out beautifully!

WHO KNEW that a bag of Oreos could produce such amazing tasting truffles!!!  Made these last night with my two daughters and they were not only simple, but DELICIOUS and look like store bought truffles!  I followed the recipe exactly, using a slotted spoon and fork for rolling in the chocolate, and it worked perfectly.  I did refrigerate the balls before dipping.  Also, I made double the amount of balls (two pkg Oreos and cream cheese) and only one recipe (2-8oz pkg.)of the melted choc. and I had plenty of choc. for all of them.

These were delicious and were a hit at my recent holiday potluck at work.  They are a bit messy to make and somewhat time-consuming (I do not have a food processor so that made crushing the cookies a long process) but it was worth it.  Some of the truffles I sprinkled Christmas jimmies on top which made the tray very festive-looking.  I highly recommend this recipe and will make again (and hopefully I'll have a food processor next time around to make life easier!) :)  Also I was thinking you could probably try this recipe with different types of cookies.  Thank you!

These were easy and very good but extremely rich. I have a major sweet tooth and could barely finish one of these. I made them as a Christmas gift for the employees of my local post office and they disappeared fast. One change I would make- 9 cookies for the crumb topping is way too much. I had lots left over and ended up mixing with leftover cream cheese and making about 8 more truffles. I would only use maybe 4 cookies for the crumb topping. All in all a good recipe!

Super easy and great.  Must put mixture in freezer of fridge to firm up before putting on melted chocolate.  Works great with the new Oreo Fuggies.

I've never made truffles before and this was a great starter!  Very easy and very tasty!  Same great Oreo taste, but much more gourmet!  My batch made only about 30 truffles, and I had a lot of leftover chocolate and crumbs for topping... maybe plan ice cream sundaes for the leftovers.  Be careful with the melted choc. temp, it started getting lumpy as I heated it.

Tasty, but more work than the name implies.  I even chilled the balls in the freezer for 30 min, but they fell apart in the melted chocolate.  The taste almost makes it worth it, could use a bit more cream cheese, I think.  Guests and family enjoyed them far more than I did.

Awesome!  So pretty and so rich.  I chilled the oreo mixture overnight, used a cookie scoop to get the same amount each time and it was so easy. These will be staples at wedding and baby showers I host, as well as Christmastime.

Made these today to put in our Christmas Baskets. They turned out wonderful! The first batch, I made with the candy cane oreos(mint flavor wasn't strong, making me wish I'd added peppermint extract to the mix). Second batch, I made with peanut butter filled oreos, and added instant coffee for a mocha flavored truffle. These were everyone's favorite! I coated all the truffles with semi-sweet chocolate, and topped with a varaition of crushed peppermints, coconut, drizzled white chocolate and shaved white chocolate mixed with shimmery red & green sprinkles. I did freeze the truffle mixture before coating with chocolate. I will certainly make again! Thanks for sharing. **Update** I froze the truffles, thawing a few hours before serving at a dinner party...they were even better than before! And the mint flavor from the candy cane oreos was perfect...no need to add extra flavor. The guests loved these truffles! Gave out the recipe several times over:)

I have made these for years. A tip to make the dipping easier...I use the melting chocolate found in craft stores.  It is much easier to work with and if it starts to set too much, you can just heat it back up!

These were good but VERY rich. VERY chocolatey! They were easy too, I found that chilling the oreo mixture for about an hour makes it much easier to roll in the melted chocolate. I melted the chocolate in a small slow cooker, this worked great! I skipped the extra step of topping with oreos (completely unnecessary) and put them in small cupcake liners so they looked nice :)  I will make these again, but only when I want a very rich and filling dessert!

Great, but the chocolate is a pain. After trial and error; I melted two bakers blocks in microwave for 60 sec, stirred, then placed my chilled oreo drops in the bowl with the chocolate and rolled them around with a spoon in the chocolate until covered, then placed them back on the cookie sheet.

These are soo good! Usually I can't finish a truffle because they are so rich, these are rich, but not too rich.  I brought to work and had to give the recipe away at least five times! Delicious. I just have trouble with the dipping, I hope I can become a pro, because I have been requested to bring to holiday dinners.

I actually like using the white almond bark as a coating on these.  I also will chill them before dipping (freezer or refrigerator).  I can't say enough good things about these - one of my all time favorite sweets!

I usually add a bit more cream cheese to make the truffles a bit more moist. Still an awesome recipe with only one block of cream cheese though.

I made these for a Thanksgiving, and got GREAT reviews! People absolutely loved these!   However, I found that crushing 9 cookies was a little too much for the garnish. I think 5 cookies for garnish would be enough. Also, I scooped the balls with a tablespoon, and found that they became a little too bulky. 3/4 tbsp or 1/2 tbsp would probably be a better size for guests to nibble on. All in all, it was a great recipe, and should be a big hit at any party!

I have made these for Christmas for about 6 years now and everyone asks for them!  If I don't bring the Oreo truffles, I'm in trouble.  I have varied my dipping chocolate which makes for a yummy variety of truffles.  I like to use semi-sweet, white chocolate and Andes mint chocolate baking chips.  The only suggestion I have for the original recipe is to refrigerate the truffles before dipping.

DELICIOUS!  Great recipe, enjoyed by all.  I put my balls in the freezer for a few hours b/f topping with the chocolate.  They were fun to make!

These are great for parties. They are very rich, so the smaller you make the balls, the better.   I use a tiny cookie scoop (which leaves one side flat) so that they have a uniform size and sit nicely on the serving tray.

Delicious!  Everyone raves about these.  I use the entire bag of oreos in the mixture not reserving anything to sprinkle on top.  I am sure it is good either way, but I wanted to avoid the extra step.

These are so easy and come out so good its hard to believe they are homemade. We used mint Oreos and they tasted like thin mint girl scout cookies! :)  To cover them in the chocolate, we found that the best way is to drop 1 or 2 at a time in the chocolate and roll them gently around with a spoon, and then  use the spoon to scoop them out and plop them onto the wax paper

I made mine wiht mint Oreos. Can't believe that two simple ingredients could result in such a creamy truffle filling! They disappeared before I could try one (sniff, sniff) but my guests RAVED! Make sure to chill the filling well before shaping. It's very soft otherwise. Also, dipping the frozen balls into chocolate makes them easier to handle, but I found that the chocolate shell cracked as the truffles defrosted. Might be something I did wrong, as no one else seems to have had that problem. Anyway, I'm looking forward to trying them again using other flavors.

This got rave reviews at bunko - everyone asked for the recipe.  A few tips - I used a pastry blender to blend the cream cheese and crumbs, and that worked really well.  I let the blended mixture sit in the freezer for about an hour.  Then I rolled the balls and let them sit in the freezer for several hours.  I used almond bark which melted easily in the microwave.  Then I placed a few balls at a time in the melted chocolate and lifted them out with a slotted spoon.  The balls held together well because they were frozen, and the slotted spoon worked well in removing excess chocolate.

I will not make these Truffles again. My husband, kids and I didn't care for them. Oreo's by themselves taste better, and don't even need to put in the time and effort.

Awesome recipe, absolutely delicious and impressive. In general, however, I find truffles to be a bit of a pain in the you-know-what to make. I still can't decide if these are worth the effort to make.  I skip the toothpicks and spoons and dip the truffles on a fork and then scrap it off on to wax paper using a thin spatula.

AMAZING!! Oddly, I could swear these got better every day and are best 24 hours after made.  Suggestions: Either mash the cream cheese and Oreos together using utensils (rather than hands which will warm the mix too much) or make sure you refridgerate the mix before attempting to make the balls. This will ensure you actually get pretty, round truffles.   Next time, I am going to to try to use milk chocolate. Semi-sweet chocolate was great but I like milk and heard that you can easily substitute the Baker's for two packages of your favorite chocolate chips)

YUM YUM YUM! Crowd pleaser every time!  I've made a few spin offs using different cookies as well. The Mint Oreo Truffles are so good, but when making remember to only use 3/4 pkg of cream cheese, otherwise your dough will be very greasy.  The Nutter Butter truffles are really good, but very peanut buttery. I've also made what I like to call a "Snickerdoodle Truffle" using a package of Vienna Finger cookies, 3/4 pkg of cream cheese, and a few shakes of cinnamon.  Then coated them in white chocolate.  These are my favorite by far!

I love these choclate balls.  Cant get enough of them.  When my husband dipped his balls in the chocolate  I knew they were going to be heaven when I got them in my mouth.  Be carefull about the size because sometimes its hard to get huge chocolate balls in your mouth.

These are so easy and delicious.  They are very rich in flavor.  Chilling the balls before dipping them into the chocolate is a must.  I used a large bowl and put several balls in at once to coat them.  I then dipped them out with a spoon and laid them on wax paper, before sprinkling them with chocolate crumbs.  Very easy and very good!

I think the people that had problems either whipped their cream cheese or used double stuffed oreos. DO NOT DO EITHER OF THESE. The object is a dense truffle no air needs beat in there. And, the double stuff just adds a wet element. The only other thing I can think of is to crumb your cookies in the food processor until it starts to clump together. The filling makes this possible and if you add the cream cheese at that stage you'll end up with a wonderful dough.   I used nutter butter and mint chocolate oreos. Definately the nutter butter as my fave. It trumps buckeyes and I'll use this recipe instead. Can't wait to try this with other cookies.

I have made these before...a friend calls them reindeer balls.  They are a little time-consuming, but well worth it!  For a little variation, try baking a red velvet boxed cake mix, cool, then crumble in a bowl & mix with one can of cream cheese icing.  Refrigerate to firm up the mixture then dip in white chocolate.  So pretty!

Very easy to make!  I had a lot of luck with the two forks idea.  Also, 9 cookies for the top was way too much.  I probably could have gotten away with 5 cookies for 48 truffles.  I only wish they were a little sweeter.  Maybe next time I will use milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet.

So amazingly delicious!! I followed other users directions and put the whole pack of oreos and cream cheese in my food pro and let it go until it came together. I had to add a little heavy cream (maybe 1 tablespoon) bc it was so dry but then it came together. I let them sit for an hour before rolling in chocolate. They are amazinggg! Very rich! LOVE THEM!

This is perfect. Just what I was looking for. I made these a couple days ago and my family loved them. I went out to the store and decided to get the ingredients but i forgot what the chocolate was for melting so I bought milk chocolate chips. I had some trouble when I tried to melt them on the stove but in the end it turned out fine. I didnt have a food processor nor a rolling pin so I put the oreos in a big ziplock bag and crushed them with a peanut butter jar, which worked fine.

These were delicious. When I started to roll them in chocolate, I found that it was pretty much impossible to do, so I came on here and read some reviews and found that I should chill the balls before trying to dip them. That worked great. Still, though, it was very difficult. The chocolate was way too thick and after a while I ended up wrist deep in chocolate just smearing it on the little cream balls. It was very very messy, but it worked, and the finished product was amazing. I think they're more mini-chocolate cheesecake balls than truffles, but no matter, everyone loved them. I also made the oreos from scratch and didn't add any cream filling to the cookies, and that worked just fine.

These were NOT easy.  I will never make these again, and I recommend that no one else bother either.  It is worth it to just go buy some.  I love to cook, but these were extremely messy and did not look good when they where done. They were not round, and it was VERY hard to coat them in chocolate.(I used a slotted spoon with melted morsels)  I would recommend taking the word "Easy" out of the title of this recipe and buying yourself a box of truffles instead of slaving for 2 hours to get a ball of goo.  The only reason I am giving this recipe a 2 is because my husband and his friend said they tasted good.

I love these! They are sooo good. A friend of mine made them around Christmas time and called them "Reindeer Poop." :) I have made them a few times and always use chocolate flavored Almond Bark I find it works a lot better.

Very easy and very rich.  I made these as part of a "thank you" treat bag that I handed out to a group at church, and this was definitely the most complimented item out of everything I made.  I used a 1/2 inch cookie scoop to make the balls, froze them for about an hour, then rolled them with my hands to smooth out the rough edges before dipping in the chocolate.  Drizzling with melted white chocolate makes them look fancier - everyone thought these were really complicated until I told them there are only 3 ingredients!  That's my kind of recipe!

We thought these were just ok; we would not make them again.  I read in a magazine a tip for making truffles so you don't get the dreaded "foot".  As messy as it is, you put chocolate in the palm of your hand, roll the truffle around and then put the truffle on your tray.  It works!!

Super YUMMY!!! So incredibly easy too.  Took these to a cookie exchange and they were the first itme to disappear.  Everyone was shocked to find out how simple they are to make.  I drizzled white chocolate on top for decoration so they were not only delicious, but attractive too!

This is a great recipe and very easy! I agree you don't need 9 cookies for the top, 5 does the trick. I also make them with nutterbutter's instead of oreos sometimes. They are all a hit! Also I use an egg seperator to dip them out of the chocolate...works perfectly.

I made these but did my own tweeking. I put 1/2 tsp of almond flavoring and used the large package of milk chocolate chips.  Then I got melted some white chocolate and put it in a ziploc bag. cut the tip and drizzled it over the top.  Teachers LOVED these.  I will be making these every  year as christmas gifts for teachers (I had 12 teachers).  I made two batches of these. By the way, I found if rolled them into balls and froze them instead of putting them into the fridge, it was alot easier dipping them in chocolate with toothpicks!  Messy but worth every minute!!!!!

Yum!  Really good.  Took another's suggestion and stuck the balls in the fridge for almost 1/2 hour before dipping them and had no problems.  Also, only used 8oz of baker's chocolate and it worked perfectly.

These were tasty, but they tasted less like Oreo Truffles and more like Oreo Cheesecake Truffles.

I love these and so does everyone I know! If you want to save some fat grams, you can use low=fat cream cheese (neufchatel cheese) without sacrificing the flavor. When I'm pressed for time (or just feeling lazy), I skip the melted chocolate and lightly coat them in cocoa powder, instead. No one notices the difference!

These are about the messiest little treats I have ever had the pleasure of making. I had chocolate from my nose to my toes! But my fault, I should have read the reviews that said to put them in the fridge before trying to put the chocolate on them. But these little babies are truly delicious!

OH-YUM!!!  These were so easy and so good!  I even tried to make them a bit healthy by using reduced fat oreos and light cream cheese!  I did not save any crumbs for the tops, instead I dipped them in the chocolate and then melted some white chips and put them into a sip lock bag, snipped off the end and drizzled the truffles-beautiful and tasty!  I will make these again!

For ease and short ingredient list, this recipe is excellent. My friends are all raving about my 'melt in your mouth' truffles. I only needed about 1 box + 2 squares of semi-sweet chocolate per batch (important to note if you're multiplying the recipe - of course you can always dip extra oreos, pretzels, fruit...have an all out fondue party). And definately freeze 20 min or so between rolling and dipping and again before rolling in extra oreo or they will lose shape. You can add peppermint extract to the chocolate for a twist.

These were super easy and very tasty.  Took in the limo with a large group on a wine tour.  Nothing better than chocolate and red wine.  Next time I will add a small amount of shortening to the chocolate before for dipping.  Seems to make a smoother chocolate.  Thins it down a bit.

These won my husband's holiday party bake off :) Using a double boiler to melt the chocolate definitely helps. I think next time I will add mini mint or white chocolate chips inside and then drizzle on top to add extra texture and flavor...yum!!

My only change was to add a cup of powdered sugar. They were not sweet enough without it. Be sure to beat the mixture for a while, until it looks like thick brownie batter. Otherwise easy & delicious!

AWESOME!
Tips:
-Use a cookie scoop so they're all the same size.
-Use different flavors of oreos. I love using berry or mint.
-To add even more flavor options, add a couple tablespoons of coffee syrup flavoring (like raspberry, creme de menthe, or vanilla)
-These don't have to STAY in the fridge for a party. They can be out for a little bit and it won't hurt them. I wouldn't go over an hour or so though.
-Use candy coating for a final "fancy" outside.
-Use sprinkles instead of cookie crumbs on top. Or better yet, use a seasonal sprinkle for a festive look!!!

We spooned the Oreo mixture 
onto parchment paper, put in frig then rolled into balls and used choc almond bark with spoons, worked great.  Love what you can combine to make these different every time.

This recipe tastes good but is pretty awful to make. I spent a ton of time waiting for things to be the right temperature. First, softening the cream cheese. Then I froze the oreo/cream cheese balls with toothpicks per other reviews to make dipping it in the chocolate easier. They had to be REALLY frozen for the dipping to go well. If they were still soft at all, they would fall apart while i was doing the chocolate part. Then I stuck them in the freezer again after they were coated in chocolate for a few minutes.
Again, tastes really good, but isn't as easy as the recipe seems, and with all the added wait time, it took way longer than 1.5 hours.

I've been making all sorts of dessert recipes to sell at my mother's business as a way to make some money for college, and let me just say these were a hit! And sooo easy to make! I read some of the other reviews and blended the Oreos in my ninja and then, after they were crumbs, added in a block of cream cheese. I didn't use Philadelphia, just the Great Value kind, and it worked perfectly. I left my dough in the blender cup and stuck it in the fridge for about 30 minutes before I rolled it into balls. I think 10 minutes would have done the trick, but I was icing cookies so it had to wait. Once I rolled them into balls (I made 23 large balls) I stuck them into the freezer and started crushing the 9 Oreos in a ziplock bag. A spatula and a little anger did the trick of getting everything crumbly. Then I melted the chocolate, which took much longer to get nice and creamy than the instructions said. I used two spoons and put two balls into the bowl at the same time. Rolled them around in the chocolate until they were covered and then dropped them on a parchment-lined baking sheet. My little helper sprinkled the crushed up Oreos on top while the chocolate was setting and then we popped them in the freezer overnight. Just tried one this morning and they are DELICIOUS. So rich. They are probably a heart attack in your mouth but 2 hours later I'm sold out!!

This is a great recipe. I used Almond Bark chocolate flavor which is much cheaper and worked just fine if you want an alternative.

Delicious! But you'll need more cream cheese than noted here and actually whipped cream cheese is easier to work with. Also, the oreos didn't blend in the blender, we had to smash them in a sealed bag. Finally, recipe doesn't say how to dip in the chocolate -- use a spoon, I guess. I was burning my fingers trying to do it by hand.

This was too easy. Be sure to refrigerate those truffles for at least an hour before dipping them in chocolate. My mind is spinning with other possible combinations. My only concern is how we are expected to use EVERY Oreo for this recipe? My cookies suffered a few casualties while they were being made. :)

These are awesome, and rich. So you can't eat too many at once. Same as others, I did add about a tablespoon of Crisco to the semi-sweet chocolate while melting. Something I did totally different was I heated the Oreo cookies and cream cheese (after putting Oreos through the food processor) and they blended together very easily. They stuck together in the balls very well. I went ahead and placed them in the fridge as I was dipping them and only took a few out at a time to dip in the chocolate. I had absolutely no problems with them crumbling or falling apart. 
Although, just know that it makes for a soft center in the truffles. So, if you're looking for crunch, this may not be the way to go, but you definitely still taste the Oreo.

Holy cow! 
After reading reviews I thought I'd say...
It takes a while to crush a whole bag of Oreos at once. Plan on 15 minutes. My friend tells me to use a food processor.
Using double stuff Oreos is a lot stickier when you crush them-but it can be done and tastes great. 
The other Oreo flavors work great too. My favorite is mint!!
Definitely chill after you roll the cookie/cream cheesy goodness together. 
The truffles Do NOT get gooey or melty if you leave them out of the fridge. 
Chocolaty outside coating can be messy. Melt on your hands and not in your mouth if you handle it too long (children). Have bibs ready. 
I had a hard time making the balls small enough (1 inch) to get 40 something servings. I had half that many servings. Think about doing multiple variety of cookies and make lots!

You want to impress people? Make these truffles! I have been making them for years and everyone loves them! I've drizzled them with pink for baby showers, red & green for Christmas...the list goes on and on. The only embarrassing part is when they ask for the recipe and I have to reveal how easy they are to make. Kind of blows my image of being a gourmet cook ;)

So easy & delicious! Every time I make these, I'm always asked for the recipe! My favorite variation is to use mint Oreo's & melt down Andes Thin Mints for the chocolate coating. Add a drop of mint oil if you love mint like I do (be careful not to use more than that otherwise it's overwhelmingly minty).

I make buckeyes every year another cookie that needs dipped in chocolate. I typically use a shish kabob skew with a small ring on the end. Much easier to drain the excess chocolate off the cookie. It also leaves a decorative ring on the top of the cookie.  ALSO a friend of mine suggested that I use a CROCK POT to met the chocolate - I did this year and it is SO easy..

I have made this with both oreo and nutter butter cookies and it is fantastic! Like other users, I refrigerate the cookie mixture for an hour before coating in chocolate. I also do not put the cookie crumb topping. I found the easiest way to work with the dipping chocolate is to melt half of the chocolate in the microwave for about a minute and a half and to use a slotted spoon and regular spoon to coat. Using half of the chocolate at a time seems to work well. I did have a more crumbly truffle with the nutter butters, but I think I did not crush it enough as I used the plastic bag and rolling pin method. While it was not as creamy as my oreo, it still came out fantastic! A little time consuming to make, but totally worth it. The truffles are very rich, and I have been asked to make them for other parties, with someone even offering to pay me to make them for their kid's birthday party. Very good and easy recipe... Makes me look like I know what I'm doing :)

I love love love these truffles, but the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because they're too greasy if making as directed above. I use a whole package of oreos plus another 15 or so. The truffles hold together better plus you get more truffles. And they are TOO DIE FOR!! Oh, we like the regular oreos, but we LOVE the mint oreos dipped in white chocolate!! (I use the Wilton White Candy Melts. They melt really easy in the microwave and don't need any oil or anything added to them and the flavor is really rich.) They have just a hint of mint. SO GOOD!!

So delicious! My boss had his wife make these for us around Christmas and everyone loved them so I had to try them myself. So simple and so good.  I found the easiest way to make these is crush the Oreos in a plastic bag then add the cream cheese right into the bag and just squeeze it all up until its well mixed.  Then just turn the bag inside out and dump it into a bowl and roll it into little balls.  Make sure the chocolate is nice and hot so that it goes on smooth when you roll the balls in it.  Keeps really well in the fridge, my husband and I ate these right up!

Made three flavors, the oreo as described, one with vanilla wafers as the cookies and some powdered sugar, and one with crushed andes mints and some chocolate flavored cereal to help with thickening the texture.  Used two plastic forks for dipping and kept the chocolate on the stove in bowls over simmering water.  Blended all in the food processor and chilled the mix before even rolling.  Then froze prior to dipping.  ** Only mistake was putting them on a wire rack to dry.  Too hard to get off! should use wax paper **  Placed them in little shiny candy cups.  The white and milk chocolate made them look like I had made several varietys.  you can check pic.

I LOVED these!!! I bought a chocolate melting pot (escentially a mini crock pot) and melted the chocolate in the microwave and then poured it in the crockpot so that it stayed melted until I was done. I then used a disher, slotted spoon, and a regular teaspoon. I used the disher to scoop out some of the mixture and then released it onto the slotted spoon. Then I used the teaspoon to pour heaps of chocolate on top of the truffle. Then I beat the splotted spoon onto the crockpot so that the chocolate settled down to the bottom, through the slots in the spoon and back into the pot. I then used my teaspoon to scoop the truffle off and slide it onto wax paper. I had no problems at all and never had to touch the truffle until I was ready to eat it. I did chill the balls first in the fridge for about 30 minutes.

I have made this recipe for years and was glad to see a very similiar version here. The small differences are just personal choices, but this is a GREAT recipe. Definitely freeze the truffle balls for at least an hour before covering in chocolate, it makes it so much easier. (I often will make them and freeze overnight and finish the next day). I have made variations of this and it is always a major delight. It seems to work better to only melt a portion of the chocolate to cover at a time, that way it stays smooth and remains the perfect consistency. I used Ghiradelli chocolate instead of Bakers and usually mix part milk chocolate and part semi sweet. Keep chilled until ready to serve. You'll make lots of people happy with this treat.

This is a very basic recipe for oreo truffles. It's good but we found we liked the vanilla almond bark for dipping and then drizzled with melted semi-sweet chocolate chips. I also weigh the oreos before making them crumbs to a full 18 oz. which is what the oreos used to weigh before it went to 15.5 oz. They come out perfect but they have to be refrigerated. My family likes them right out of the freezer. They never get real hard and they keep very fresh in a ziplock freezer bag. I've seen them done with yellow, green and chocolate bark on lollipop sticks and drizzled with white chocolate for a baby shower. They were absolutely adorable! Have fun with them!!

I've been making this recipe for years now, though no one quite knows what it is. You can also press the mixture into a square plastic-wrap lined pan and let it set over night in the fridge before cutting into squares or rectangles. I like squares, dip them in dark chocolate spiced with a hint of peppermint flavor. Then using a decorator's piping bag you can make white chocolate ribbons on each piece for a fancy designer look.

I made these for my daughter's birthday party. They were a huge hit and the girls would give it 5 stars. I used semi-sweet chocolate to coat - and I personally think almond bark or white chocolate would make them even better. The semi-sweet chocolate made the truffles very rich and delicious. I took the other advice and froze the truffles for a couple of hours before coating, and only melted enough chocolate to keep it smooth and easy to use when coating and melted more as needed. It was easy and not nearly as time consuming as I thought it would be. Would definitely make again!!

I know these have high reviews but we didn't really like them very much.  We found them to be too rich for our tastes.  I followed the recipe exactly  so I'm not sure why we didn't like them as much.

WOW are these ever good! My wife won't stop raving about them! Maybe I made them a little large, but I used a 13 oz bag of Newman-O's (organic oreos) and only got 13 truffles. I followed the tips from reviews and cooled for 2 hours in the freezer before coating. Also, since I had so few, only needed 8 oz of chocolate. Try some, they're easy and delicious!

I screwed this up somehow with the baker's chocolate. Don't let it melt too long!!! I tried to add milk to thin it; it turned out crappy. :-( Need to give it another shot.

these turned out great. not only did thy taste amazing but the also looked amazing, i used oreo crumbs on top and drizzled white chocolate on them for decoration. i had little to no issues rolling them in chocolate, as long as it was at the right temperature. i also used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the bakers chocolate because it was cheaper (this worked just as well)

Love this recipe, everybody is a big fan of these whenever I make them! I reuse the fillings as icing by reheating it for several seconds or so in order for the fillings to liquidize (or get less chunky) a little bit.

I got this recipe from a friend along time ago and whenever I make them I find it easier to put them in the freezer before dipping in chocolate. Also if you don't dip them in chocolate and just keep them in the freezer they are great on warm summer days(:

I make these at Christmas for my annual cookie exchange...and everyone loves them.  I use white merkens wafers and the white almond bark mixed together for an easy but solid coating.  Get creative and use mint chips or skor chips with your chocolate!

I did not have high hopes for these but I thought: oreos, cream cheese, what could go  wrong? 

So I decided to make them for a housewarming party that I was hosting... Although I almost broke a blender (my bad), I finally succeeded to make them. They are surprisingly easy. 

After a while in the fridge, I gave it a go with my boyfriend. They are incredible!!! Amazing! Perfect! I cannot find the words. Incredibly creamy and tasty would probably work. 

I served them to the party and it was a huge hit! And a lot of the people invited were people working with my boyfriend at Ladurée which is a French pastry restaurant. Even the chef, who makes incredible food could not believe it! People were joking around that I should become a pastry chef!

Highly, highly recommend them, they are just gorgeous and a real crowd pleaser

Easy way to impress folks. I love this for special birthday treats. I make mine bigger, seems to keep them more moist.Can't wait to substitute a few different cookies to spice this one up. Peanut butter and butterfingers here we come! :)

Perfectly delicious! The layers that make it interesting: hardened outer layer with a fudgey center. Strong chocolatey, buttery flavor! I had to make sure I had a glass of milk with one of these to balance it out!

Love these, always a huge hit! Smaller truffles are easier to eat, and have less calories :)

I have made these 3 times now and everyone loves them sooo much. The only thing that I changed was not putting the cookie crumble  on top but I have drizzled some white choc on top of the dark or vice versa. My kids also love these and I must say that they taste the best when frozen.

These are delicious! I did not like the cookie crumb outside, so I just left them "naked" dipped in chocolate.  I used reduced fat Oreos, reduced fat cream cheese, and white chocolate chips.  They did take quite a while to make and were a little tricky to mix, but I will definitely make these again with different flavors. Great recipe!

This recipe kind of hurt my feelings.  I baked lots of beautiful and difficult treats for Xmas and these were what I got compliments on.  So quick and easy and they do taste great.  I chilled the balls and dipped them into melter coverature using a dipping tool that costs about 2 bucks at any cake decorating shop.

I loved these!  Easy and so versatile, you can really change it up and make so many variations.  I used this recipe and then changed it according to what I had in the kitchen.  No name chocolate cookies, skor chips and cream cheese, milk chocolate coated and then more skor bites on top.  Cheese cake fix without eating a whole slice!  Going to make more this week with different types of cookies and fillings to make a tray:)

I've been making these for years. (Funny my original recipe calls for 20 oz. pkg, but the pkg sizes keep decreasing)  I don't reserve any of the cookie crumbs, but mix it all w/ the cream cheese.  After making the balls, I refrigerate for an hour before dipping in the chocolate.  I use chocolate discs from the candy store or other quick hardening chocolate coating and melt the chocolate in a double boiler to prevent over heating.  Plus it keeps the chocolate hot while dipping.

My daughter made these last night they were that easy. I helped dip some just cause I wanted in on the fun too! We did some in white chocolate (almond bark) and some in chocolate candy coating (that's what I had). I of course sampled each version and both were yummy!

Chocolate lovers will be happy!  Most couldn't guess that these were made with Oreos.  Next time I may add some Kahlua or perhaps Chambord.

I love oreos. I love truffles. Oreos + Truffles = Love
If you don't mix it evenly some taste like oreo balls others taste more like truffles. I preferred the oreo truffle taste. I halved the recipe, so when you do this add A LITTLE more cream cheese than half a stick. I made 28 balls from half of the recipe, which was definitely a good idea.

These are great, I've made them for christmas and party functions.  I find using a small cookie scoop rather than rolling them by hand works best.  I have also skipped the cookie crumbs on top and glazed white chocolate over top or used crushed candy canes,  sugar sprinkles, and crushed nuts over top.  Having several different tops make them look that much more special when they are displayed at parties.  They really are pretty easy to make and worth it as compliments will soon follow!!  They make great gifts too!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I made these ahead of time for a Christmas party and they were so good the kids ate them all before it started. They were so easy to make, I had them remake the batch before the company showed up. After mixing the cookies and cheese, we place in the fridge so it was easier to roll then placed the rolls in the freezer so it was easier to dip. The smaller the ball the more pop-able they are. We then tried multiple variations such as mint, pb and strawberry oreos, white/dark chocolate dipping and they were all fabulous.

These are delicious! I highly recommend you refrigerate the oreo/cream cheese mixture before attempting to roll the balls. About an hour or so. 

Everyone who ate one asked for the recipe - so good!

Yummy and easy!  I used 32 reduced fat Oreos ( I didn't have a whole package) and reduced fat cream cheese.  Tasted great!  Instead of topping coated truffles with remaining Oreo crumbs, I just put sprinkles on top.  I also used vanilla and chocolate almond bark to coat the truffles.  Use a fork to dip them and tap the fork on the side of the bowl once coated.  It helps get any remaining chocolate off.  Enjoy!

Made these following almost exact instructions. I used milk chocolate instead but that's just because I prefer it and instead of sprinkling cookie crumbs I glazed them with white chocolate. Soooooo good and way easy. Thanks for the recipe!!!...oooh just thought of something: Maybe using golden oreos next time (I love those!)

I tried a similiar recipe to this one i.e.  finely crushing one pkg of Oreo Cookies, removing 1 tbsps of the crumbs and setting  aside.  Mix the cream cheese & remaining crumbs until well blended.  I used an electric mixer.  Shape into 42 balls.  Refrigerate 30 mins.

Melt choclate squares as directed on package.    Then follow #2 & 3 as stated in this recipe.
 
These Truffles call for a sweet tooth as they are very rich.  I recently served these Truffles at a friend's birthday gathering and they were a huge hit with all the chocolate lovers.

These were so much fun and easy to make, plus they were awesome!!  I put them in the freezer about 20 min before dipping them in the chocolate.  I put a drop of canola oil in the chocolate to make it smoother. I had no problem rolling them and they stayed together perfectly....will make again for sure...thanks!

I do not have much experience with baking so I was a little tentative. However, they came out excellent. My family loved them. I listened to one review and broke the two middle prongs out of a plastic fork for rolling the balls in the chocolate. Excellent idea. It worked great. I also added about a half tblspn Crisco to the chocolate as suggested and this worked fantastic to make the chocolate smooth and creamy. I microwaved the chocolate also which worked fine. Following the suggested tips resulted in this recipe being easy and successful for me to accomplish!! Thank you.

I don't like chocolate, so I can't give an opinion for myself, but I made these for the first time and took them to a Christmas party, and they were gone within 20 minutes. Everyone was fighting to get some more. Easy to make and people love 'em

These were great! I gave these out for Christmas along with some other candies and these were the star! Very easy to make.  I froze the balls, then used two spoons to swirl them in the chocolate.  I also used chocolate chips instead of the squares (they were cheaper) and they still tasted great.  Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

I have made this many times. I keep the balls in the freezer before dipping. When I dip I jab them with a tooth pick and use it to dip and carefully pull them off to dry. Also I like to use vanilla instead of chocolate.

I am usually horrible at melting chocolate, but this time I melted semi-sweet chips in a double boiler with about a tbsp of vegetable oil.  The oil made the chocolate smoother, and it stayed hot and melted longer for dipping the oreo balls.  I even had more than enough time to transfer the melted chocolate to a smaller bowl so that dipping would be easier.  Also, I used a fork/spoon combo when dipping.  I put the balls in the chocolate, covered them using a spoon, lifted them with a spoon, and transferred them to the sheet with a fork to avoid a puddle of chocolate from the spoon.  I think next time I may even transfer them to a wire cooling rack with a cookie sheet underneath to catch any chocolate drippings.  I did have too much melted chocolate and too much leftover cookie for the garnish.  I would recommend only using a 12 ounce bag of chocolate and maybe crushing only 4-6 cookies for the garnish.  We have yet to eat these as they are still cooling, but we are very anxious - how could they be bad?!

These are great ... my co-workers are devouring them as I type this review.  I made two varieties, one using the Oreo cookies and the other using the Nutter Butter.  Both are very good.  I will add this treat to my Christmas recipe file.

I made 5 desserts for friends, and this was the overwhelming favorite.  So I made a second batch.  a few days later.  The second time I added 2 Tbs crisco to the chocolate (I used choc chips) and that made the coating SO MUCH EASIER and prettier.  I did have to make more of the coating than the recipe calls for (both times).  I used a slotted spoon and regular spoon like recommended.  The first time I used my medium size OXO cookie scoop and only got about 20 balls - they were too big.  The second time I used the medium scoop then divided those in half to get about 40 balls.  These were the perfect size.

These were good, but not great.  They tasted exactly like an oreo dipped in chocolate... which is exactly what they are, but for some reason I thought the cream cheese would impart at least a little flavor into the finished product.  Next time I will try using mint flavored oreos or a bit of raspberry jam to add flavor as another reviewer suggested.

Very easy to make. I didn't need to put the cookie and cream cheese mix in the fridge. I just mixed very well and made 1 inch balls. I then melted my chocolate. I used chocolate chips in a "double boiler" (a normal sized pot with boiling water with a smaller pot in the large pot). I slowly melted the chocolate. While it was melting I added some butter to thin out the chocolate to make it easy to dip and it gives the chocolate a nice shine when hard. To dip the balls without having them fall apart I used 2 forks on either side of the ball and then dipped away. With using the forks the extra chocolate drains off the ball.

Tasted very good, but very messy and hard to dip in chocolate.   If I make again, I will try almond bark, that may be easier to dip truffles in.

These are great. This time I used a package of Cool Mint Creme Oreos for one batch of them. After I had the dough mixed together it was very very sticky...not thick enough. I checked the package and sure enough, the cool mint oreos only have 30 oreos in the package compared to 39 in regular Oreos so you will need to adjust your measurements for the oreos. I think they are going to turn out okay but the dough was not quite the right consistency.

Awesome! I used my hands to mix the cream cheese and cookie crumbs thoroughly, and chilled the balls for an hour or two in the fridge before dipping. I used 8 oz baking chocolate and 8 oz white chocolate for dipping. I used a spoon and fork to roll them in the coating, and then drizzled them with chocolate to dress them up a bit. Delicious.

Try these for the holidays using mint Oreos, coat with the chocolate then drizzle with white chocolate and sprinkle on the tiniest bit of very crushed peppermint candies.

YUM!!  These were wonderful!  They will make a great House Warming gifts and Thank You gifts!  I’m always looking for different ways to treat my friends and clients.  I looked online and found a company that sells these polka dot pastry boxes that are so cute!  They will make the gift complete.  http://www.boxandwrap.com/bakerydots.html

Excellent! Incredibly messy, but, worth EVERY chocolatey-gooey-mess of clean-up. Recommend chilling in fridge prior to rolling (for 15 min.) Also tastes delicious if you insert chocolate covered coffee beans on top of the balls prior to chilling for an hour :)

I agree with the reviewers about how easy this recipe was. I did use a fork to roll the balls in. I found that the toothpick didn't work and two forks were way too cumbersome to work with. I do think next time I make these, I will use bark vs. the chocolate. The chocolate did thicken up towards the end and became slightly more difficult to work with. I also think though that bark looks prettier and smoother than the chocolate looks.

These are amazing! A big hit with the coworkers. A lot of people seem to have problems with the balls falling apart. My suggestion is instead of stirring the crushed cookies and cream cheese is to mix it with your hands.  Works wonderfully and they don't fall apart or make the almond bark messy. :-)

These are so easy and so so good! I've made them several times. I took them to a dessert party and used Christmas sprinkles on the tops. They were a hit. I also made some using Mint Oreos and used white chocolate to dip them in. Very versatile.

Wow! I had so many compliments on these that i was hesitant to explain how EASY they were!!! I made regular, mint, peanut butter, and raspberry. I used regular, mint and PB Oreos and followed the recipe exactly and they were phenomenal! I added raspberry preserves for raspberry ones and I did have a bit of trouble- my fault- getting the consistency right was tricky but they came out great after I added a bit of confectioners sugar and lightly oiled my palms before rolling them into balls. Thank you, thank you!!! Great holiday recipe!

This truffles are really easy to make and taste great! My only complaint is that they are really decedent, and rich. If they were just a bit lighter they would be perfect.

FANTASTIC!!!  I used Nutter Butter cookies and Nestle semi-sweet chips, melted....and they came out delicious!  Dropped each ball into the chocolate, rolled around with a wooden spoon to coat and removed with 2 forks.  Easy peasy!!  Thank you for this awesome idea!!  Happy Holidays! :)

Awesome....they're so fun and easy to make if you follow a few simple rules. First use a food processor if you have one to crush the oreo's and mix in the cream cheese. Also make sure you stick the balls in the freezer for 20 minutes or so before dipping in chocolate. This will make life a lot easier when dipping. I dip in batches too, that way the others don't get all gooey while sitting out waiting. Third when you dip the balls don't use toothpicks! I tried one like this just to see how it would work....total failure! Use spoons or forks...this will make life a lot easier! Delicious! Made these for Thanksgiving and they were a BIG hit!!!!

I used a basic tub of vanilla frosting instead of cream cheese and it tasted phenomenal. My boyfriend and I scarfed them down fast. Thank you.

I followed the recipe exactly.  These are so easy to make!  I got the recipe in 2010 and have made them for different parties/events all year.  Every time I bring them somewhere they are a hit!  I will definitely continue to make them.

Excellent recipe. Here are some changes.  Form the ball.  Make a depression in the center and put a red cherry.  Press dough around cherry.  Freeze.  Don't use a tooth pick to dip your oreo balls.  Use a wooden scewer, it is thicker and works sooo well.  Sprinkle with favorite topping or refreeze and later drizzle with a contrasting color chocolate.

These are delicious and so easy!!! Tip melt in microwave and then use two spoons to roll it around in chocolate.  Also definitely refrigerate before rolling.  I refrigerated mine for 2 hours before rolling in chocolate.  Im making some more holiday ones and bringing them home for the family.  I know they will be a huge hit!!

I made the truffles into mini footballs for a tailgating party. Instead of rolling the oreo mixture into perfectly round balls, I rolled them into the shape of a football. I would use milk chocolate next time to dip and cover. The semi-sweet was a little to bitter for my taste. Plus, kids usually go for milk over semi. After they've been dipped and have chilled for a bit in the fridge, use a toothpick dipped into melted white chocolate to draw or drizzle on white lines for laces. They turned out really cute and were a hit at the party.

Excellent and simple. Made these for a Hallowe'en potluck at work, coating them in white chocolate and using food colouring to decorate them as eyeballs. My recommendation for dipping: if you are at all adept in the use of chopsticks, they work very well as there is little surface area of the chopsticks touching the balls themselves which helps to keep the coating smooth.

Great recipe with a ton of flexibility.  I first experienced these at a party where someone made them with mint-filled Oreos - decadent!  I substituted choc & white choc almond bark for the baking chocolate.  Use a food processor for easy prep - I dumped whole cookies and chunks of cream cheese and it mixed up perfectly.  Roll the balls and refrigerate for atleast 1 hour, then dip into melted bar using toothpicks.  Easy and elegant.  Everyone thought they were store-bought!

Wow, these are so simple to make and taste amazing!  I was looking for the oreos with peanut butter filling, but couldn't, so I used chocolate instead.  I also used melted white chocolate instead.  They were sooo good and everyone was very impressed that tasted them!

Incredibly easy and delicious (considering the ingredients). I always freeze the oreo/cream cheese balls for an hour before coating to make them easier to handle and don't bother with the toothpick. Use a water bath to keep the baker's chocolate melted while coating. The chocolate coating will harden fairly quickly when the balls are frozen. I've tried topping with crushed oreo, toasted and crushed walnuts, and toasted and crushed pecans. Pecans were my favorite.

These taste amazing and are simple to make but they might be too rich for some people.

So easy and delicious! Here is the trick to making the mixing and shaping part Super simple: use food preparation gloves! Initially I was frustrated trying to mix the crumbs and cream cheese with a spoon, so I just put on the gloves, mixed it with my hands, and then shaped them by hand as well. SO easy! These are very rich so I made mine a bit smaller (about tsp. size) and was able to get 70 out of one complete package of mint Oreos and 8oz of cream cheese.  Easy, delicious crowd pleasers :)

I recently made these for the first time.  As it was my first time attempting to make truffles, I followed the recipe just as it said.  the only difference is that I used semi sweet chocolate chips instead of the Bakers chocolate.  While they were easy, the most time consuming part was dipping them in chocolate.  I melted  my chips in a double boiler.  I froze the filling before coating in chocolate and I had absolutely no issues with it.  They tasted sooo fantastic! Everyone that I have had try them has said the same thing.  Very sweet   but oh so good!!

Wow, these are yummy!  I rolled the oreo and cream cheese mixture into balls and then refrigerated as others had suggested.  This really helped when it was time to coat them in the melted chocolate. I sprinkled each one with red, white and blue jimmy sprinkles before the chocolate set for 4th of July. These are delicious, but I think I will try Baker's milk chocolate next time instead of the semi-sweet.  Just a personal taste thing.

These were a real crowd pleaser. They were easy to make and looked like I bought them from a store they were so pretty. (I did a white chocolate drizzle on them). I used the other readers tips on coating them and had no problem.

These were delicious! I made them into footballs for a Super Bowl party, but I have to say, even with freezing them, it was near impossible to get a true football shape. If you're happy with just round balls, they're fantastic. Anything trickier than that requires some clever ideas....or at least cleverer than me! Overall though, these are amazing. Rave reviews from everyone that came to watch the football with us.

these were so hard to make. i didnt think it would be a big deal but every time i tried to drop the oreo balls into the chocolate crumbs would come off and ruin the coating, making it look anything but delectable. also, not that its the recipies fault but i kept somehow burning the chocolate.

Tasty, simple recipe. The possibilities are endless as to the types of cookies that can be used. I loathe the dipping in chocolate part (have done far too many batches of cake balls) so you really need to attain the right consistency for a speedier process. Will make again when I'm having the craving!

These were a hit at book club and will definately make them again.  I think they are great as is, but I didn't need all 9 cookies for decoration, nextime I'll probably do 4, the remining ones either going back into the recipie or might find themselves in a glass of milk.  
Also I ran low on chocolate, so I covered half in vanilla almond bark... that worked well and tasted good too.

These were SOOOO easy to make.  The part that took the longest was rolling the truffles into balls.  But it was worth it.  I definitely recomend chilling the truffle balls before dipping them in the chocolate.  I didn't have any problems with them breaking.  I made a second or third batch with PB oreos and Mint oreos.  The PB ones I also substituted about 1/3 of the cream cheese with peanut buttter and added a little but of peanut butter to the melted chocolate.  I sprinkled chopped peanuts on the top which looked nice.  The mint ones I added a little peppermint extract to the truffle and to the chocolate and crushed candy canes to sprinkle on top.  Soo yummy and soo easy.  I will definitely make these again.  :)

I made these for some ladies at work and they LOVED them! My boss said it was the most amazing thing she's ever eaten. Everyone was asking for the recipe and made me write it down and copy it for everyone before I left work. I've made them several times since and used white chocolate for dipping instead of milk or semi-sweet,comes out very very good!!

These were amazing. I baked three batches for church. I did one batch regular, one with peanut butter oreos, and one with mint oreos. You can combine different flavors of chips too. They all came out perfect!! I had to cut in the cream cheese with a pastry blender. It was too thick for my regular blender. Definately doing this again!!!!!

Oh WOW- these were amazing!  I will say- take the advice of other reviewers and chill the oreo "balls" prior to dipping them as they are just too fragile to work with otherwise.

Tasty truffle easy to make dipping is a little tricky.  I used white chocolate melts not a big fan of dark chocolate.  There was a bit of pieces of cookie in the truffles but they were still good just gave a bit of crunch is all.  Made these twice, big hit no leftovers.

So rich and so easy to make. I kept the ingredients the same and froze the mixture for an hour before I rolled into balls. Also froze again after the balls were formed before dipping in chocolate. Huge success!! I didn't have any left to enjoy!

I found the chilling worked to keep it together, but one thing that I had found that seems to work even better is to use less oreos. The first box that I bought only came with 30 oreo, so I used all of them in the food processor. I have never had a problem with the oreo falling apart and they still taste great!!

Fantastic! I used the minty flavored oreos and only one and a half packages of white baking chocolate. Oh so good, and extremely easy!

Delicious. Let the balls cool off before dipping in chocolate. Followed with a spoonful of oreo crumbs, coconut or skor candy bits on top. Was much easier having extra hands (my 6 & 4 year old daughters) to add the extra bits. Try not to make them too big...it's a very rich and filling treat. But also extremely addictive! I found them much better once cooled or directly from the freezer. Thank You! I'd like to say I'll make them again but they are dangerously delicious.

These little tasty morsels are heaven in your mouth!  I made these instead of Christmas cookies and everyone LOVED them.  I dipped them in white chocolate instead of the Semi-Sweet, and then drizzled milk chocolate over the top of them.  I also refrigerated them after I mixed the oreo crumbs and cream cheese for a few hours.  Otherwise they crumble.

very easy.  I used 2 forks to roll the balls in the melted chocolate - no problem.  Then put in fridge for an hour to chill.  Only complaint:  I did not get 48 as the recipe calls for....i only got 22.  I made the balls very small so I don't know what happened.  Did anyone else have this problem?  Very good and easy to make.

These get 5 stars for versatility and simplicity.  They took me less time to make than regular chocolate chip cookies.  I has some Andes mints on hand, so I replaced about 1/3 of the baking chocolate with those to give the truffles a nice peppermint flavor.  Other chocolates could be used, for dipping or drizzling.  In addition, flavored cream cheese (think strawberry cream cheese) could be substituted with great results. To "dip," I simply rolled the balls in the melted chocolate with a fork, scooped them up, and shook them a little to release excess.

An easy and wonderful truffle. I used half Baker's Chocolate and half chocolate discs that you find in the candy making section of the grocery store. This was suggested to me for ease of coating and the Baker's Chocolate gives the rich flavor.

Wow!  These are terrific!  I had no problem with them because I froze the balls before dredging them (using a fork) in the chocolate.  These go quick so make a lot!

We love these. We make them for everything! We made them for a wedding and used white chocolate and purple tinted chocolate chips. We did half white and half purple. Then we drizzled the opposite color over top from a baggie with a very small puncture hole. They were beautiful and tasted wonderful!

I use white almond bark instead of semi sweet baking chocolate.  Melt green and red decorating chocolate wafers and drizzle that over the truffles..  I call them Oreo snow balls.

The first time I had these about 8 years ago I coudn't belive when I found out that I was able to make them myself.  And soooo easy to boot! Instead of the melted chocalte I do use the almond bark in vanilla flavor.  For Christmas, I sprink wth nonparleirs.. can't be beat for a cookie tray.  They last a very long time in the refrigerator (if you have to keep them that long!) Another 5 star review from me.

These are always a huge hit. I like to crush some starlight mints or candy canes into the mixture, nice and fine. It gives it a perfect wintry bite. These are ridiculously simple and amazingly decadent.

DELICIOUS!! These are what oreos should taste like!  They are a bit dangerous to have in the house, though, since they are just the perfect 2-bite size.  I did omit the chocolate on the outside, so I guess technically they are not truffles, but I just rolled them into balls, refrigerated them and then rolled them in sugar.  They look pretty with the white sugar on them and it was SUPER easy with no chocolate mess!

These were sooo yummy! Not only were they easy to make, but they look like something you buy from the store, so pretty. I used mint oreo instead which gave it even more of a holiday flair.

My family has been making these for years and they are always a hit. We have experimented a lot with different cookies and coatings but what is really wonderful are extracts! Try adding a rum extract or a raspberry extract in the mixture just before rolling. About a tablespoon gives the extract just enough to really be tasted.

This recipe is so simple and amazing!  You definitely have to chill the balls before dipping - it keeps them from falling apart! :)  I used white chocolate to dip them in - awesome!  Will be making again soon, thanks again!

I've been making these for years!!  I sometimes use the Mint Oreos for a change.  Since they have more filling, they are creamier.  Double stuff Oreo's don't work as well- they are too soft!  I always freeze mine before coating them in almond bark so they don't fall apart.  When they cool, I drizzle melted white chocolate over the top for added decoration.  This is one dish, that no matter how much you make, you will never have left-overs!!!  :)

I followed a few suggestions from other users - I chilled the rolled up balls in the fridge while I melted the chocolate. By chilling the balls, it made them less crumbly and easier to coat the chocolate on. I used two spoons to roll and coat the melted chocolate onto the ball. I rolled the ball between the two spoons and let the excess chocolate drip off. One thing I wish I did was have more patience letting the excess chocolate drip off... using slatted spoons helps. If you don't let the excess chocolate drip off, you will have balls with pools of chocolate attached to them when they are done hardening (not as appealing). Other than that.. it was really easy to make and delicious.

Truly easy and very delicious! Only thing I will change is reserving some of the crumb to top the truffles with...completely unnecessary. Use the crumb to make additional truffles, it'll be more worthwhile.

These are amazing... :) one thing, i personally don't think you need to crush all 9 cookies for the added decoration on top. For me it was a waste to crush that many and didn't even come close to using it all for the tops of the truffles. (Maybe only like 3 or 4)  I'm bringing these to a party tomorrow so we'll see how  fast they go ;)

These are a total crowd pleaser and are fairly easy to make.  These are much easier to manage if the oreo mixture is chilled before rolling in chocolate.  Although the original ingredients make the best truffles, it's fun to experiment by adding a couple of drops of mint extract, or using white chocolate instead.

This recipe is .  Last week, I used the truffle recipe by Eagle Brand and it was perfect.  This recipe however is tedious and it's not really a truffle no matter how you make this.  It's difficult and time consuming.  They don't set well.  I won't be using this recipe again.

This is a wonderful recipe, so easy to make and my kids had so much fun helping me. Just a quick tip: after mixing cookies with cream cheese put the mixture on the parchment paper and in the freezer for a few minutes, roll it into the little balls and put it back into the freezer, take a few at a time and dip in chocolate (we mixed almond bark with semi sweet), that way the balls don't fall apart and we used a fork, spoon and a toothpick (to wipe extra chocolate when the oreo ball was on the fork).

Fun treats to make with the kids. Always a hit! Highly recommend refrigerating Oreo balls before dipping in chocolate; otherwise they soften too much and disintegrate as they warm up. I use a large knitter's stitch holder (looks like an old fashioned diaper pin) to dip the Oreo balls into the warm chocolate. Simply bent the clip to a 90-degree angle, which allows me to rest the Oreo ball on it while I dip. Then I use the straight "arm" of the stitch holder like tongs. Works like a charm and allows me to use just the right amount of chocolate to coat the Oreo balls!

These were delicious. I made them for Thanksgiving last year, one batch with regular Oreos, and the other with peanut butter (my personal favorite. They were a hit, to say the least. I think the 50+ treats being shard amongst my family were gone within a half hour. Next time, I might try the mint Oreos. That seems like it might be good.

Easy! Easy! Easy!  Make sure that the cream cheese is really soft, otherwise, it is difficult to mix up.  I didn't have a food processor, so I did it with the rolling pen.  Next time, I will not reserve crushed cookies for the topping.  I will use them all in the mixture, then top with sprinkles.  I'd rather have MORE truffles to eat!  Huge hit at a dinner party.

These are a little messy until you get the hang of dipping. I prefer white chocolate, so that's what I use and you have to be careful not get "crumbs" in it, but they are delicious and worth the work! Using a fork to dip the truffles it the easiest thing I've found. And they're great plain too (that's the way my hubby prefers them!).

I love this recipe and I make these all the time for parties because they're yummy, easy, and everybody loves them! I've played around with different flavors too; I've used nutter butters instead of oreos and covered in dark chocolate, i've also used mint oreos and covered in white chocolate both are amazing but I gotta say the original is my favorite. It is super difficult to get the chocolate to stick to the balls, whether you cool them or not. I don't recommend the toothpick it makes them fall apart and creates a mess! First I add a little cream with the chocolate while melting, not a lot, but it makes the melted chocolate runnier. Then I use two spoons, one for the ball and one to pour the chocolate over then I just toss the ball between the two. When I run out of time I just roll the balls in powder cocoa and it does the trick! Hope this helps!

These were great!! I used my kitchen aid, with the wisk to crush the cookies then added the cream cheese. I couldnt wait to try one so I ate one while the choc. coating was still warm and i didnt care for it all that much. So i made half with and half without. After i tried them chilled I should have definitley covered them all!!

EVERYONE, you must try to make tea truffles out of these. They are a HIT! I infused loose leaf Jasmine tea in one small batch, blueberry rooibos tea in another batch, and earl grey tea in another batch. Continue making them with the same prodcedure and you get the tea taste. Also, sprinkle the tea leaves on top!m They're
amazing desserts! Super easy and super delicious. I processed the a whole pack of oreos in a food processor to make the job easier compared to the rolling pin. I dipped half of my batch with white and other half dark chocolate.   The  melting chocolate I used are Candy Melts from Michaels Arts and Crafts store. Since I don't have a double-broiler, I simply microwaved them and they were great to work with.  I also freezed them for an hour and used toothpicks to dip them.

I've made this a couple of times. I liked them better using chocolate chips rather than the baking chocolate, the bakers chocolate becomes fairly thick and hard after refrigerating. The chocolate chips thins out when melted and isn't quite so hard when refrigerating.

I've been making these for years.  They are always a hit, super easy to make, only 3 ingredients, you just can't go wrong.  I like to use the white almond bark sometimes to switch it up but either is great.  You just can't go wrong with this one!!

I have been using this recipe for years now and everyone raves about them.  The favorite in my family is the mint oreo version.  If you use the mint or any other kind of cookie with more filling in the middle you can cut back on the cream cheese to make the "dough" easier to work with.

My daughter took one bite and said, "Bleh, What are these?  Oreos and cream cheese?  Yuk!"  Guess there's no foolin' her, though everyone else liked them quite well.  One ball was enough to completely satisfy my sweet tooth craving.  Two would have sent me into a coma.  The bottom line is if you like oreos and cream cheese, you're in business.  If not, there's no magical transformation here, so don't go there!

These are delicious and always please the masses. I make them fairly small, almost bite sized because they are very sweet. I chill the balls before dipping them in chocolate and always find it's best to use a slotted spoon or small tongs to do the dipping. I also always use white chocolate since it makes them look and taste better (in my opinion). So easy and so delicious! I recommend them for events or gifts as everyone seems to like them and I never come back with any left.

I put the oreo cookies in my food processor and then added the softened cream cheese.  Food processor made this super easy.  Had to put batter in the fridge to allow for easier rolling.  Added a touch of margarine to chocolate to allow for it to be smoother and thinner for dipping however, the dipping was the only part of this recipe that was a bother to do.  Overall, whoever tasted these either "loved" them or found them way too sweet.

Very good. My boyfriend's coworker has a similar recipe where she triples(?) the cream cheese and then adds vanilla to cream cheese mixture.

Yum! I've made these over and over and always get rave reviews...and everyone thinks I accomplished something really difficult! A little time-consuming, but easy. Have never used the food processor, crush the oreos in a plastic bag and the cream cheese will soften any bigger chunks and result in a uniform truffle. I use chocolate almond bark exclusively now and use the fork method to dip the truffles. (I agree with chilling the rolled balls first!) I like to place the finished truffles in mini muffin cups--the balls themselves aren't very attractive, not that it's ever been a deterrent!

These are very easy to make, but being a novice baker...I wasn't really sure how to properly coat them in chocolate without squishing the mix or leaving finger marks on the truffles. But Mmmmm were they great!!

Awesome! The only change I made was that I sprinkled a little bit of the oreo crumbs on top of the balls insead of rolling them.  It is too hard to roll them.  I also sprinkled some red sugar on top for Valentine's Day.

My roommate made these and they were amazing.  She used bamboo skewers and dunked them in the chocolate and then put the skewers in green florist foam to get hard.  It worked out really well.  She then, while standing in the foam, would drizzle melted white chocolate on them to make them fancy looking.  They were awesome and hard to not eat while she was making them.

I give this 5 stars for taste and being such a crowd pleaser. I made them over the holidays and they were gone in no time. Which was very surpising since I made a little over a hundred ping pong sized truffles. I do suggest storing the oreo balls in the fridge for a good half an hour before dipping them. I used a heavy duty plastic knife and spoon to roll them in the chocolate.  I also think they are much better in white chocolate.

I have made a lot of candies and truffles, and these by far were the messiest to make that I have ever attempted.  The cream cheese for some reason did not "stick" well with the oreos, and it was an utter mess.  It was not a great way to start my holiday cooking.  They tasted good (especially after a day or two), but they were so difficult that I don't think I'll make them again.

I wish I could rate these 4.5 stars, because that would be more accurate. The truffles were a total "5" for taste and appearance, however were soft and difficult to work with. I ended up having to stick them in the freezer before dipping them in chocolate. Then the opposing temperatures caused the truffle to ooze out any cracks in the chocolate. Other than that, I didn't have a problem. Also, I found that I needed to use all of the oreos that the recipe called for for the truffles. Hand beating was not nearly as effective as using the countertop mixer. After all of these adjustments, the recipe is pretty much perfect and got rave reviews from the 20 or so people who received them for Christmas from me! I served them in little tins with the "Peanut Butter Truffles" and "Easy Decandent Truffles" from this site. The Oreo ones were my favourite. I decorated them by dipping in chocolate and sprinkling with a dusting of Oreo baking crumbs.

My name is amy and I AM a chocoholic. These are literally the best thing I have ever put into my mouth. FANTASTIC! I just don't know what I can say to describe it. I ate them first at my cousin's house dipped in white chocolate. She made me a bagful to take home and I mowed through them in the first day. Now I have been making them at least once a week. The  key is COLD, they must be cold to roll and to dip. I'm in love.

These are dangerous to have in the house they are so good!  I used whipped cream cheese and they came out even better then with regular cream cheese.  I made some dipped in chocolate, some plain with chocolate, and some just rolled in powdered sugar.  Everyone loved them but the ones rolled in powdered sugar were my guests favorite.

These truffles are absolutely DELICIOUS and are so unbelievably simple to make.  This is the second time I've made them in the past couple of weeks and I think I've perfected the process (without changing the recipe). TIP 1: Once the cookies & cream cheese are mixed, REFIGERATE mixture for an hour. TIP 2: Use a Mellon Ball scooper to scoop out onto the waxed paper. TIP 3: REFIGERATE the rolled balls another hour to harden.  This makes it easier to roll in the melted chocolate. TIP 4: Try different chocolates for dipping!!   I dipped some in White chocolate  and some in semi-sweet chocolate; the white-dipped ones were FANTASTIC.  The two flavors really complimented each other!!!  Definitely a keeper of a recipe...

Yummy, and oh so easy. My six year old loved helping me make these. After crushing the cookies in the food processor, I added the cream cheese directly to the food processor. Chill in the bowl for 30 minutes. ONLY USE REAL CREAM CHEESE!  Used a small cookie scoop to scoop them out, and then chilled again. The rolling in melted chocolate is messy and time consuming, but worth it! I made two batches for Christmas. The first using Peppermint Jo-Jos (Trader Joe's Oreos), melted semi sweet chocolate chips, and then drizzled with melted peppermint kisses. The next batch I made with Chocolate/Vanilla Jo-Jos, and covered in white chocolate, and sprinkled with red, white, and green nonpareils, and they were beautiful! I will make these every Christmas from now on!

I had no problem at all of rolling the crushed Oreo mixture upon refrigerating them for 1 hr but found the process of coating with melted chocolate to be too much a hassle (even using 2 forks as advised by others). The chilled Oreo mixture tasted extremely nice which contradicts to chocolate coating as I can't find good chocolate at our local store last night. I had to give away the 2 boxes of finished truffles to workers this morning as we really didn't enjoy eating any of it. Guess I won't be making it anymore… judging from the hassle of making, rolling and coating, coupled with washing with the extremely-difficult-to-get-off hardened chocolate over my bowls and forks, etc as well as time and effort spent.

Chocolate filled chocolate, how can you go wrong! These are by far my most favorite thing to make in my tiny overworked kitchen. The most important thing to remember though, is that while this will always taste exquisite, the presentation matters most in truffles.  Drizzle some contrasting colors over the top, white on dark... I like to mix it up, with a sweet chocolate coating and drizzled in white and dark chocolate. A few other changes that i HIGHLY recommend are to use half Oreo's and half Girl-scout thin mints. you get an amazing mint flavor that will make your mouth water. I also like to add the Oreo dusting to the drizzle, not the main coating.  For anyone wondering. A great trick to melting chocolate without a double boiler, is the microwave! chop your chocolate up to pea sized and microwave for 30 seconds at 50% power. do this a couple of times while stiring to melt perfectly. when the chocolate is almost melted, just stir it and let the chocolate melt itself. I prefer a ceramic bowl for this cause it dissipates the heat well. french onion soup bowls work great as well.

So super easy!  I've ended up making 4 batches this holiday season because anytime my husband gives them to someone to try, they beg me to make it.  My 6 year old helps me roll the balls out and she adds the oreo "sprinkles" at the end.  She and I have had so much fun making these and my husband has had more fun devouring them.

I have made this recipe several times.  This is a great wedding cookie recipe.  I always drizzle a little white chocolate on each truffle. I have tried with mint oreos and tinted the white chocolate w/ green.  Today I am trying this with the Christmas peppermint  oreos & drizzle w/ pink or red chocolate.  I have a small scoop I use to make them all uniform. Placing the rolled truffles in the freezer for about 20-30 minutes makes them easier to dip & they stay firm. These are awesome! Need a 10 star.  I alwyas get 5 doz.

Best recipe ever! Always the hit of any get together, guaranteed! The options are endless as far as variety and decorating. I, too have struggled with the dipping but I discovered a trick last time I made them. I used 2 fondue forks because I had literally tried everything else and they kept falling apart and looking a mess! I used one to stick in the the balls (after freezing to get as firm as possible!) and I used the other to slide the ball off of the first one onto the wax paper and fix and inconsistent texture on top. They really did work wonders and made the process much easier! My favorite way to decorate is to dip a fork into the opposite chocolate that the ball is dipped in and sling around over the top of the balls- gives them a very fun look.. Any type of sprinkles or colored sugar make them look great too! Can't go wrong with these! Don't worry if yours turn out messy looking at first, they will still taste AMAZING and you will figure out a method that works for you!

These are out-of-this-world good!  And easy!  I followed the recipe to a tee..  and while I began melting the chocolate, I put the truffles in the fridge to chill (for easier dipping later).  I also enjoyed how minimal the ingredients were, and the cleanup was not so bad either.  Just make sure to sprinkle on the topping within a minute of dipping in the chocolate (the chocolate dries fast)!  I used the Oreo crumbs for most, but also added some fresh, chopped bacon to a few (for those chocolate & bacon lovers out there)! :)

Prefer it with white chocolate.  To avoid the mess and inconsistent size I use an ice cube tray as a form.  Put a little melted chocolate in, add a slightly smaller molded lump of cookie mixture and press gently into chocolate.  Cover with more chocolate to form around the creamy center.  Chill and once cold, just pop them out like ice cubes.

This is an awesome easy recipe that tastes awesome with little effort. My son enjoyed crushing the cookies in the ziploc bag. Do freeze the balls for a little while it makes them much easier to work with. I want to try this again with mint oreos. Oh... and if you want a thinner chocolate coating leave your chocolate on a double boiler while dipping. I personally don't like the thick coating that turns out if the chocolate cools too much.

very easy and yummy. I used white choc candy disks. Melted on half power until melted. Also you only need 6 cookies for crumbs on top. And when dipping them I used a 2 prong fork worked perfect for me. I did not freeze dough before rolling I did freeze after rolling for 15 minutes.

Excellent! I'm horrible in the kitchen, but took the advice of the other reviewers and they came out great! Someone even said "Bakery Quality"! Definitely freeze the dough for a couple of minutes before rolling, then refrigerate before dipping in the chocolate. Only melt 1/3 or 1/2 of the chocolate at a time. I made 3 batches - one with regular oreos, one with mint oreos, and one with peanut butter oreos! I added a drop of vegetable oil to the melted chocolate to give the truffles a nice glaze - Came out beautifully!

I love this recipe. It turns out delicious every time and it's a good thing it tastes so good because my truffles always come out looking so ugly. I've tried all sorts of different methods for coating these. I always chill the mixture and I've tried toothpicks, 2 spoons, 2 forks, a slotted spoon....none of them work. I still haven't yet found a method that works for me.     I've found that the best way to make the mixture, and this will take you about 10 extra minutes, is to separate the oreos from their stuffing. I usually open the oreo, scrape the stuffing out into the bowl with my cream cheese and toss the oreo into the baggie that I will crush the cookies in. Then I beat the cream cheese and oreo stuffing, then continue beating as I add in my bag of oreo crumbs that I crushed. This makes the mixture so smooth and easy to work with when it's chilled.     I like to top mine with melted white chocolate piped on with a baggie with a hole cut in the corner. It dresses them up some because mine are so ugly that they need all the help they can get. But where it counts - the taste - is GREAT!

Who knew something could look so elegant and only consist of a few ingredients?! These are VERY rich but wonderful for gift giving.  I made them and put them in "Girls Night Out" martini glasses and gave them as Christmas gifts to my girlfriends. I agree with another reviewer who said these are better than the cake balls that are so popular.

Wow!  Easy Peazy Parcheesy!   Delish!  I took them to work and people could NOT believe it when I told them how I made them.  I had everyone writing down the recipe.  Duh!  What's to write???  3 ingredients!   Oh yeah, I did add a butterfinger to the nutter butter ones.  I will add some kahlua to the oreo's next time or maybe some cayenne pepper to give it some hidden heat.  :)

I agree, these are sooo easy and yummy. Though we call them "reindeer balls" at my house!! One other variation that we love is to add a teaspoon (or more, depending on taste), of instant espresso. To make these easy to tell apart from the regular ones, I dip these into melted white chocolate. Sometimes I sprinkle colored sugars on them while still wet. Freezing the balls for a short time helps for me, too.

Absolutely fabulous!  I used 1 package of vanilla Baker's chocolate instead of the 2 packages of semi-sweet, and it was more than enough to coat all the balls.  To make the balls, I used a melon baller which helped speed things up and was a lot less messy than rolling the balls by hand.

Wow.  Absolutely delicious.  I dipped half in white chocolate and half in semisweet.  I liked the white better, because the semisweet was just a little too sweet for my taste.  I might try milk chocolate next time.  These are a deliciously sweet treat...I can't decide if they're more like candy, a cookie, or a little cake...but either way they're fabulous and they make a great presentation.

Wow....just made these and they are fantastic! I used my food processor to crush the cookies and then added the cream cheese  and blended it together. I bought the Baker's chocolate that is already in little cups to melt in the microwave which made that part easy. I rolled the balls with no problem and put them in the fridge for 15 min. before doing the chocolate. I put the balls on a fork and used a spoon to pour the chocolate over. Then i sprinkled the crushed topping on top. Put them in the fridge until ready to serve. I thought they were easy.

yummy!!!! using this recipe for a bake exchange.  Might try using mint oreos and white chocolate.  These truffles have to be kept chilled for obvious reasons, and they are definately easier to dip when they are frozen, and the chocolate sets almost instantly.

oh these were yummy! not as easy as i hoped for because the chocolate was a pain but the time and effort were well worth it! i refrigerated the oreo mix before i rolled them in to balls and then again after i rolled them. i think it made it much easier to roll in the chocolate. brought them to my company pot luck and they were devoured!!

Delicious and very easy. Do use the slotted spoon method to coat in chocolate that other reviewers have suggested. I also recommend chilling the balls for an hour between rolling and coating. Easy and so good.

I wish I could give this more than 5 stars!  I made these for a baby shower and everyone was RAVING about them!  They are so easy too if you cool the cream cheese mixture before dipping them in chocolate.  I will definitely be making these again.

REALLY GOOD. I followed the directions exactly and refrigerated them overnight before dipping them in chocolate. I found that resting them on the edge of a fork and spooning the chocolate over the truffle worked best. I brought them to a bridal shower and they were gone in 5 minutes.

These are better than you can imagine.  I use the chocolate almond bark for dipping instead of the semisweet baking chocolate.  Definitely chill the balls before dipping and I have found a fork works best for dipping.  Place the chilled oreo ball on top of the fork and dip.  Do not pierce the oreo ball with the fork.  When you bring the fork out of the chocolate simply tap the fork on the edge of the bowl and the excess chocolate will run back into the bowl.

I made these along with my Christmas cookies this year, and my husband loved them.  They are super rich and are definitely for chocolate lovers. Super easy to make, no cooking needed, a perfect recipe for your favorite chocoholic!  (Also great to bring to a party because they look so pretty)

These are SO DELICIOUS and so easy!!  you can't go wrong with these.  We've used regular oreos, double stuff oreos, blended them til smooth 1 time, the other time we crushed with a rolling pin and there were still some "chunks".  We covered the first batch with melted chocolate, the toher time we didn't even bother!  Any way you have them they are great, and not too over-the-top rich like some truffles can be.  We used a small scoop to portion these out and then froze them for easier handling.  We'll be making these again and again!

I have been making these for a few years. I found the recipe in an issue of Kraft "Food & Family" mag. They suggest scraping the filling out of the Oreo's, although it is time consuming I have done it. Both ways are great though and I am always asked for the recipe. I usually top some with chopped pecans, some I drizzle melted white chocolate across and some get the crushed Oreo's. The variety is so pretty!

These are AMAZING, and they are sooo easy to make. They honestly look professional. I used a box of Trader Joe's Candy Cane "Joe Joes" (which you can only buy around the holidays) instead of Oreos - they have crushed bits of candy cane in them, they made the recipe PERFECT. I used Ghiradelli milk chocolate to coat them, and drizzled white chocolate (same brand) over them. Wonderful!!! 
Updated: I have also made these with Double Stuffed Peanut butter creme oreos, and those are to-die-for good!! Super!

very good and very easy. I wasn't sure if teh recipe called for removing the cream filling or not, but i was in a hurry and didn't want to. i took the whole package of cookies and broke them up into my mixer and let it have at it for a few minutes. then added the cream cheese and was good to go. 

i would shape the dough into balls then chill, and coat in chocolate.

the two fork technique really does work the best. i thoughth a slotted spoon would work but it tracked chocolate everywhere! i was skpetical that the balls would stay on the fork but the chocolate helps the balls stay on the forks while switching from fork to fork to get rid of excess chocolate.

also these are pretty sweet so smaller balls are better

We have made this twice, once with semi-sweet and once with milk chocolate.  We thought the milk chocolate was much better.  We topped them with melted white chocolate "piped" from a zip lock back each time.  Great recipe.

This is (by far) my favorite sweets recipe. I have made this so many times for the Christmas Season and I continue to have many many requests for it. I agree with putting the truffles in the fridge for about an hour before dipping, and dip fast! Otherwise these guys start to melt. I also drizzle mine with white chocolate after being dipped in milk chocolate - and I used double stuff instead of regular. 
FABULOUS recipe. Can't go wrong.

I made these yesterday to put in cookie bags for work. They were a HUGE hit and people were "trading" other things in there bag for these! I did use milk chocolate to dip them in, and the good kind. Don't know what difference it made.

These were so easy to make and looked beautiful.   I thought these were wonderful and very chocolatey.  I did have a few people along with my husband tell me they thought it needed something else other than just chocolate.  Next time I might add some coconut, nuts, or toffee bits.

People actually asked for "take out containers" for the truffles!
Wonderful and quick dessert!

These are AMAZING! Next time I am going to make a smaller batch and use less oreos and more cream cheese, as I'd like the centers to be more creamy. I put the balls in the freezer for 1/2 hour and used a double broiler so I could only melt the chocolate I needed.

Excellent! I've made these a few times--they taste better a day or so later...less OREO-like. Sweet, rich, indulgent treats! Will make a great (and impressive!) Christmas treat to give!

They taste great, but a lot of assembly. Instead of dipping each "ball" I took the spoon and drizzled the chocolate on top.  I used only one package of chocolate morsels this way instead of two. Made it super easy and less messy. Thanks for the recipe.

These truffles are delicious and foolproof!  My kids love them, and I always end up making extra batches of them. I agree that they should be refrigerated before coating them, it just makes them easier to dip. I like to dip them in milk chocolate.

They are really tasty, Creamy, and you really cat go wrong with OREOs in baked goods.  I dont know if i rolled them too small but it seemed for me to take a while to roll and dip them...of course the hubby bunrded my 2nd bowl of melted chocolate so that might have made it seem to take too long.  Next time (and yes, there will be a next time) i will settle in front of the tv at the coffee table rolling them dipping.

I've made these a lot in the past. I have a couple of questions for anyone who can answer it. Can these be made 2 weeks ahead of Christmas ? Are these okay to freeze like I do peanut butter bon bons. I freeze them and they do good in the freezer then bring therm out and let them sit out of the container to defrost. I just want to make as many of my cookies ahead of time as I can. Thank you for your help in advance

I made no changes, but next time I would refrigerate the rolled balls to get them really firm before dipping them in the melted chocolate.

I used a family pack of regular oreos and 4 oz. cream cheese (recomended in one of the other comments).  I dipped some in white chocolate and some in milk chocolate. I much preffered the milk chocolate coated ones. Thanks for the recipe!! Super yummy!

1. There are no such things as 16 ounce bags of Oreo's.2.They were not as "easy" as they looked.  The melted candy (chocolate) did not work as anticipated.  It is truly a learning experience.
3. Won't make again.

Have made these on several occasions. I do not sprinkle them with crumbs after dipping, but rather I use sprinkles, jimmies, or a  zig zag drizzle of melted white chocolate.  People fall all over themselves to eat these when I serve them.

I LOVED this easy recipe. The inside of the truffle was nice and creamy you can definitely taste the Oreoes inside and out. I used Chocolate almond bark instead of the bakers chocolate because the bakers chocolate doesnt harden as well as the almond bark. Overall this recipe was a hit with the family, everyone loved it!! I'm going to make this again but with different type of Oreos.

After reading the reviews, I was excited to try this recipe.  I was very disappointed with how it turned out.   Most of my time was spent cleaning up the mess afterwards, as this is a VERY messy recipe.  (ok, might be part messy cook :))   IMO...this recipe was expensive, messy and didn't make enough truffles for the effort.... and the taste,  em...just ok

I found this recipe a few years ago and all I can say is that they are awesome!  It wouldn't be Christmas without them.  They are great the way they are but I have found I like them even better dipped in melted mint chocolate.  They are a big hit at any party I take them to and never have any left to take home.

These were a HUGE hit this year at Christmas - many, many compliments.  I thought they'd be a bit easier to make since there's no actual cooking involved, but melting the chocolate and dipping the truffles was very messy and hard to get them easily coated before the chocolate started to cool.  Worth the trouble though!

The best form of oreo I've ever eaten! Over the course of a month every bag of oreos i kept buying were getting eaten before I could make this recipe. When the time came to make them i only had half the amount of oreos needed, so made half a batch. They were gone in almost 24 hours... with only 3 of us. My husband wished he didn't eat so many oreos so i could've made the whole batch of truffles. :-)

Super easy, fun to decorate and play with, and very cute.  My 10 year old son loved making these for a cookie exchange. We decorated them as white chocolate snowmen with mini Oreo hats and chocolate reindeer with pretzel antlers and candy eyes and noses.

I was surprised how much I wasn't amazed by these. I LOVE Oreos and I just thought these were "eh" ok.  I love cake balls and the texture of those but what I didn't car for was how dense these balls were and the colder they are the less  flavor you get. I recommend leaving them out for an hour or so. I also think mixing in some Oreo crumbs after the Oreo cream cheese mixture was made. The texture was just boring in my option.

I have made these for several years and have also used Nutter Butters, vanilla oreos, and mint oreos. Always turn out yummy! I throw the cookies in the food processor and pulse them to crumbs, then add softened cream cheese and pulse just until blended. I refrigerate then use a cookie scoop and roll in powdered sugar. I often have the kids make these because it is so quick and easy.

Just made my first “test batch” in preparation for the holidays and brought some to work to share. They were a huge hit! I made half with milk chocolate and half with white chocolate. I used several tips found in other reviewers’ comments – I chilled the dough in the fridge for about 30 minutes before making the balls. Then I froze the balls on 2 separate baking sheets for an hour before dipping in the chocolate, and took one sheet out at a time for dipping. I added vegetable oil to the chocolate and had no problem with the chocolate getting too thick and the frozen balls didn’t fall apart in the chocolate. I tried a couple of methods for dipping – the toothpick method worked well for coating, but I messed up the top of the balls trying to get the toothpick out. When I tried to fill the hole and with chocolate it just made the tops messy looking. The fork and spoon method worked best for me. I am already thinking of varieties for Christmas – mint Oreos with Andes chocolate chip morsel coating, crushed peppermint on top, red/green sprinkles, etc. Easy and excellent!

UGH. Never again. It's not worth the trouble and mess it makes in the kitchen for a couple dozen fairly mediocre tasting truffles. Dipping the truffles in chocolate was incredibly tedious and annoying because there's no way to get them from the bowl onto the tray without them either flipping over and exposing the unchocolated underside (was using a fork to lift them out of chocolate) or falling apart in the bowl, even after I refrigerated them for 15 minutes prior to dousing them with chocolate.

At the end the taste was amazing but I didn't know how to dip the Oreos so it created a big mess.  I suggest getting 3-4 packages of bakers chocolate.

This is my first tims making truffles but i really liked the mixture. I took the cookies apart and separated the cookies from the cream. After I crushed only the cookies in a bag and then mixture it with the cream cheese. After I mixed in the cream. (Was I not suppose to do that?) The mixture became very sticky and I tried rolling them into balls and then covering them with the cookie crumbs. The crumbs helped it some but then after I tried covering them with chocolate and the ball fell down. Where did I go wrong?

This is a win! It's so delicious! I didn't cover it with chocolate instead, I grind the Oreos added creams cheese, make them into ball shapes and I put it in the freezer. They are so yummy!

Just gorgeous. Impressed a lot of people with these, which is great, because they're so simple. My only problem was, it was hard to roll them in the chocolate without them falling apart at times or getting really messy. I solved that by stabbing them with a bamboo skewer, dipping, and then placing on the tray. then drizzled a little extra chocolate on top to cover the hole made by the skewer. Altogether really delicous.

I crushed the Oreos first in a food processor then added the cream cheese and processed until it came together like dough.  I chilled it in the freezer for about 20 minutes, rolled out the balls and freezer them again for 30 minutes.  Only dipped half a batch at a time since they defrost pretty fast.  Overall it came out great for my first attempt!

I'm not big on baking so the simplicity of this recipe appealed to me. My only comment, more crumbs over cream cheese. They are messy to roll when too creamy. I forgot to Chill them before dipping in the chocolate but I used a double boiler and a slotted spoon . By the end the chocolate was getting tough(it's ok, the kids were more than happy to eat the rejects)  They were a hit at the Holiday party and I won 3rd place.... No leftovers to bring home either. I used the Mint Oreos, yummy!!

What's not to like about this recipe?  I even made it kid friendly!  I put the cookies into bags and let my 2-year-old smash it with a rubber mallet.  Then I dropped the cream cheese in the bag and let him squish it around.  Then he helped me roll the mixture into balls and put in on a cookie sheet.  The only thing he couldn't help with was the chocolate dipping.  They were a hit at the party I took them to, although the elder crowd did mention they were a little too sweet and rich.  One note, though:  let these sit in the fridge for a while, probably overnight.  That gives the cream cheese time to soften the cookie crumbs, and makes them much more truffle-like.

Classic and a versatile  recipe for a lot of different uses, cookie pops, truffles and other stuff. It can be shaped into forms that can then be dipped in coating of your choice.

EASY is right!  These are a big hit at my house with the resident Oreo nut.  I made them last year and couldn't keep him out of them.  This year I used Mint Oreos and they were great too.

I have made these twice now for a cookie exchange.   I always get asked for the recipe.   To dip into chocolate I bought a Wilton chocolate warmer and it worked like a charm

SO SO good!! I only reserved three cookies to use for decorating the tops. I used a cookie scooper to make each ball nice and uniform. I froze for a half an hour, and then used the fork method for dipping in chocolate. Had no problems. Decorated with remaining crushed cookies and also festive holiday sprinkles! THANK YOU! These are sure to be a hit.

This is a great recipe & it really isn't difficult (like some people said in other reviews)it just takes a little patience & time & a few tweaks!I did use less cream cheese because I read so many reviews saying it was too moist so I used all of the cream cheese block except about 1/4 cup.I used semi-sweet chips & made my own doubleboiler by filling a large pot halfway with water & keeping it on low heat & placing a small pot inside (Be careful to NOT let water get in your chocolate-it will ruin it!) & melted the chips that way. It was pretty thick so I added about 1 tbsp of crisco to thin it out. Once you roll the balls of the oreo-cream cheese mixture, put them in the FREEZER for at least 20 minutes. Then use a toothpick to pick them up & do a quick dip in the chocolate & then tap the toothpick on the side of the pan about 30 times or until it stops drizzling. Then, to put the truffle on the wax paper carefully shake it off the toothpick (don't use you're fingers or a fork or else it will make it look ugly!) & it will evenutally fall off. You can fill the little toothpick hole by dipping the toothpick in the chocolate and dabbing it on the hole and it gives it a pretty swirly top on the truffle (see my pic)! Do as many as you can until the balls need to be chilled again. If they get too warm they will start to crumble when you are trying to dip them so keep them chilled. When you give them as a gift just tell people to keep them refridgerated. They are absolutely divine!!!

Very very yummy.
I keep them in the freezer and bring out a few when we have guests. They are a great consistency with a crisp chocolate crust.

Such simple ingredients create an amazing truffle.  I've also used different Oreo flavors (i.e peanut butter and mint Oreos), also phenomenal!

Everyone loves these but I found that just 36 cookies is too sticky so I use 40 cookies and have about half a pack of cookies left for later of if I'm making another batch ( I always buy two packs just in case). The extra 4 cookies makes it less sticky and easy to role without chilling. I also found that 9 cookies is too much extra to cover that balls with, 4-5 is plenty and I make about sixty smaller ones instead of the larger one inch. Sprinkles also make these really pretty and still just as amazingly tasty.

OMG, these are ungodly good!  A few suggestions:  I ended up crushing them in a ziploc with a rolling pin--quick and easy.  I used a small ice-cream style scoop which was the perfect size for the balls & made a flat bottom.  Froze the balls for about 45 minutes, then dropped them in the chocolate, rolled them around and scooped them with a slotted spoon so that the flat bottom was down, tapped it a few times to get the drips off and pushed back onto the cookie sheet & froze again.  I will leave them in the freezer until ready to serve.  They can sit out awhile, but will get soft after some time.  Will try other cookies and coating next time.  Fairly quick, easy and a pretty recipe.  Great to make with younger kids. Or make ahead of time for a party, store in freezer until ready to go.

These are delicious! They are very, very sweet so be prepared. I found the dipping is easiest if you have 2 people. Put truffle on a fork and hold over pot with melted chocolate. Have other person spoon chocolate over truffle. Slide truffle off fork with a toothpick onto wax paper. This sounds complicated but it saves a lot of the chocolate and isn't messy.

These were a big hit. I made them with the kids at Thanksgiving and I barely got one because the guests scoffed them all. We did use Cadburys dark chocolate and dusted them with cocoa. They were as good as any fancy name brand truffle I've ever had.

This had ingredients I love: Oreos (I crushed them in a food processor), cream cheese and chocolate chips. But together? Pretty yucky. I made these axactly according to the recipe, right down to the brands. I took it to a party, and word got around they weren't worth it. I'm surprised, and glad I tried these. But again? No thanks. I'm an experienced cook and baker, and this is one of those rare times my review isn't even close to the majority's.

Did not care for these.  Tasted pretty much like an oreo that had extra filling, minus the crunch.  I did not care for the consistency and it was way too rich.  I wouldn't bother making these again.

This is the first high starred recipe I've tried on Allrecipes that just didn't fly at my house.  It's so simple I don't think I did anything wrong...but it turned my oreos into something that was less good than a regular oreo and made it...not quite good enough for seconds!  I did melt some peanut butter and drizzle it on top, and that improved the flavor somewhat, but I won't be making this again.

I've been making these for years and I have experimented quite a bit, with lots of success.  If you want a little variety, try making these with Golden Oreos, and add coconut to your cream cheese and cookie mixture.  Roll them in white chocolate and voila!  Delish!

There is a spring-loaded olive / pickle fork you can use to make your life easier in the dipping process. Search for it online, I included a pic of it. As far as the truffles, I make them once a year around the holidays and take them to work. Normally I will run out of the entire batch before first break. Great recipe, easy to make and only 3 items to pick up at the store!

These are to die for! What a huge hit!  I use 1/3 low fat philly cream cheese instead (comes out super moist). Oh, key is to freeze the balls for a half hour before dipping into chocolate (easy to manage).  Will recommend .....

I've successfully created the balls, which are now in the freezer. I tried melting semi-sweet chocolate chips but the chocolate seemed too thick. In my effort to thin the chocolate, I ruined it. I've read mixed reviews on using chocolate chips vs baking chocolate. Can I use chocolate chips successfully? If so, how? And, once dipped in the melted chocolate chips, will the coating harden at room temp?

These were very tasty - but were a disaster to make and I'm undecided if it's worth the effort ...

Awesome!  If you can find the peppermint Oreos (mint are okay too), they are especially tasty holiday treats.

I know I'm just reiterating what everyone says when I claim that this recipe is great, easy, flexible ingredients-wise, and a huge crowd-pleaser! But I've seen a few reviews stating that the dipping of the balls can be tricky. Just use two forks, not spoons or toothpicks, tap the fork holding the ball a few times in the edge of your mixing bowl, then wipe away any excess from the bottom of that fork with the free one - works every time! And I'm a HUGE klutz.

Way late to the party--made these Christmas 2010, and used Trader Joe's Jo Jos in mint, added mint extract to the lime green candy melts I used--and called them Grinch Balls.  DO chill for at least an hour before dipping.  I want to try this with Ginger Snaps and sweeten the cream cheese--maybe with vanilla and sugar, or mix in some cream cheese frosting...

Wonderful!  These get lots of compliments and you can make them early, freeze for a couple days, then let thaw on the way to gatherings.  Make sure to put the balls in the freezer for about an hour before drying to dip.  This helps the balls stay attached to the toothpick to dip.  These taste good frozen but taste even better cold.

Major hit with the kids (and adults)!  The only problem is that its messy to prepare. There must be an easier way to roll the truffles. Other than, I would definitely make them again.

I love this recipe! They are one of my signature truffles I make.  I have also done another variation of this with vanilla oreos and white chocolate. They are amazing. I have also used a mint chocolate for dipping. That gives it the mint oreo feel.

If you're on a diet, it's best not to make these or even keep looking at the recipe because these are SO AMAZING AND ADDICTING! I LOVED this recipe! The truffles were so delicious and so easy to make! I HIGHLY recommend this! (And if you think you won't need a whole pack of OREO's, you're wrong!)

These truffles are delicious! Followed the directions exactly, except I chopped part of a cookies and cream candy bar into tiny pieces (almost shavings) and put that on top while truffles were still tacky. Looked great and tasted even better!

I substituted white chocolate for some to dip in. 
Next time I'm going to try a different variety of oreo such as the peanut butter filled oreos. Chop some reeses peanut butter cup finely to either mix in or to sprinkle on top.

Here in Phoenix, our local dollar store has 1lb packages of nutter butter pieces(already ground up cookies).  I used a bag of those and mixed it with the cream cheese. I used other recommendations for using a food processor to incorporate the two together perfectly. I chilled them in the deep freeze while I melted the chocolate(I used almond bark since I keep that on hand). I then used a slotted spoon to dip the truffles.  Instead of using cookie pieces as the outside garnish, I treated it as a regular dessert truffle and gently sifted cocoa powder over the truffles, and set them up in the deep freezer. Hubby is going to LOVE these(his fav candy is Reese's). They are his Valentine's day surprise since he works nights.

Very delicious and easy although very rich- can't eat too many at a time! I find it's even better with nuts, shredded coconut, sprinkles, or white chocolate shavings on top. Enjoy!

Very yummy! As others suggested, I chilled dough for 1 hour before rolling into balls, and then chilled ballls before dipping in almond bark.  It was much easier to work with, but I still had some crumbs fall off into the chocolate.  Luckily the crumb topping disguised the "dirty" chocolate and they were still attractive.

These were a hit with family and friends at our Christmas party.  We made them with Mint Oreos and rolled each ball in finely crushed pecans prior to dipping in chocolate.  Dangerously delicious!  Looking forward to trying this recipe with other flavored cookies.

Ok ladies and gents... this is by far the easiest recipe yet known to man kind. I rate 5 star for taste,prep,and directions. So easy my 8yr old could follow. Came out great. Since I had a smaller crowd I cut the recipe in half. I also found one 12oz bag of chocolate is more than enough with a lg amount left over.

I have to laugh at the name.....EASY?!?! I'm still trying to find the best way to dip them in chocolate without having a big chocolate base. I highly recommend freezing them! I ended up sticking toothpicks in them and dipping them. Once the chocolate set, I drizzled with the opposite (while or milk) chocolate to cover the toothpick hole. They are delicious though!

SO ADDICTING!!!  a little time consuming with having to dip each one, and by the end the melted chocolate was a little "muddy" looking, so the last few truffles came out bumpy, but whatever!  they tasted awesome!  will definitely make them again and again.

No where in this recipe does it say to refrigerate the dough for awhile to stiffen, to make it easier to make the balls, I had a mess today, I'm sure they will taste fine, but they are not very pretty !

I've been making Oreo Balls for years, and they are usually the first dessert gone at our church functions.  I generally use half semi-sweet choc. and half milk choc.  Then I drizzle white choc. over the top to make them look pretty.  My family begs me to make these over and over again.

I use Mint OREO cookies instead of the regular flavor, and everyone LOVES them!  I actually crush the oreos into very small pieces, dip the chilled (so much easier when they're chilled) balls in chocolate, and roll them in a bowl of oreo pieces.  Tip: Using a crockpot to melt the chocolate and keep it warm has worked well for me.  We keep them in the freezer for the holidays, and they are always a huge hit!

Yum!  So easy and so good!  I refrigerated the mix overnight due to my schedule and had no issues with the mixture "making a mess" or falling apart on me while I was dipping and coating them.  I also took other's advice and added the cream cheese into the food processor after I crumbled the oreos and it was a great recommendation!  You have got to try these!  Definitely a crowd pleaser!

Great.  Took to a Christmas pot luck and everyone raved.  I used truffle dark chocolate from a candy store which I already had and crushed small candy canes to sprinkle on top.  Had it the recipe way too and although the chocolate i used was my desire, I can't say it wasn't just as good with the semisweet chips.

I love this recipe but I make one small addition.  I add 1/4 c of powdered sugar to cut the bitterness  and richness of the cream cheese.  Also, try freezing and then eat straight from the freezer - AMAZING!

These are absolutely delicious!  And they really aren't that difficult either. Do take the other suggestions and FREEZE the cream cheese/oreo mixture before you dip it into the chocolate. It definietly helps to prevent the truffles from falling apart. Great recipe!!

The recipe, as written didn't work well for me. The "balls" never hardened well. I had to chill the dough before even rolling them. I froze the balls but when they hit the warm chocolate they softened and left oreo behind. It was quite a mess and didn't come out looking anything like all the lovely pictures posted here. I tried the fork trick and that didn't help much. They look awful, but taste good. I wonder if you used the whole package of oreos if it would make the dough stiff enough to make this work? I'm so disappointed!

I just made a batch of these.  They are delicious!  A great thing to make with the kids because of the no baking! They loved mixing everything and making the balls. I did freeze them before and after rolling for about 20 minutes.  Also, I used almond bark instead of chocolate chips as someone suggested.  They seemed to be a bit messy (the cookie crumbs), but other than that great!  I made half of them with white chocolate and the other half with regular chocolate.  I drizzled the leftover chocolate over the top of them after dipping to make them a bit prettier. I do not have a food processor, but it would have been much easier and quicker if I had!

I've made these a few times and they're so good. The only downside is that they're kind of messy. I'm pretty new to all of this, so I think it's fair to say that the messiness could be totally my fault. These are really easy to make and everyone I've made them for love them.

Won. Der. Ful! I just made these and they were super good. My picky sister said that she wanted more. And more, and more! I'm sure everybody at the party I'm taking these to will love them.

I've made these before and they're always a huge hit.  This time I added mint extract to the cookie and cream cheese mix and coated them with dark chocolate... Amazing!!  Also, if you don't have wax paper, use aluminum foil and coat with nonstick spray, works great! :)

Oct.23,2011 -- I only made half a batch to test for a party. I had refridgerated it for a while before taking it out and boy, once it was on the table ....... gone! I had used white chocolate and I think it made a big difference.  Since these were rich, I think I will make them a tad bit smaller. I also think these balls are better than than cake balls. Update: Dec.28,2011 - Since, I like using white chocolate, you must use a double broiler. Also, take a plastic fork, break out the 2 middle tines and it  makes the perfect "dipper"

I'd had these before, or something like it, and I'd expected more Oreo flavor.  This recipe as is tastes heavily of Cream Cheese.  I might decrease the amount of cheese if I try it again.

By far the easiest truffle I ever made, but  they taste like you'd slaved away for hours in the kitchen.  You can also get creative with how you decorate these.  Would be great to give at Christmas time.

ok, the chocolate was a mess!  If you add some edible wax to it - it would be much easier!  Other than that - it was pretty easy.

These are always a hit.  They are kind of a pain, a mess, and take some time, but the end result is well worth it!  I make them for the winter holidays and everyone in my group now looks forward to them.

These are so amazing I made a few variations of this First i added mint extract to them and drizzled with white chocolate that i added green food coloring to, I also added orange extract to them and drizzled with white chocolate that I added orange food coloring to, I also made these with white Oreo's in original , mint and orange, I'm going to keep experimenting with this recipe as it is my all time favorite sweet treat and the flavor combinations you could make is crazy, Love Them, you must try theses if you have ever had cheese cake bits (store bought you keep in the freezer) these are almost identical but way cheaper then buying them

I actually found almond bark worked better for dipping.  I made some for a bday party and sprinkled the top with rainbow sprinkles - they came out so cute, everyone loved them and I couldn't believe how easy they were.  I always make peanut butter balls at christmas time - this year i'll make these instead with nutter butters...MUCH EASIER

Great recipe - death by chocolate cheesecake truffles essentially.  my only suggestion would be that if you like the cream cheese to be more prominant like in a cheesecake, i would add a lot more cream cheese. maybe double.  i'll try it next time and let you know.

I love these. My friends and I call them death mush because they are so rich but they are worth it!! I usually throw in some vanilla just for some more flavor, and I recommend using an electric mixer for combing the cookie crumbs and the cream cheese. The last time I made them they weren't as creamy and the only thing I did differently was I hand mixed them.

I've been making these for a while now. They are such a hit at parties. The first time took a little longer than expected but the times after that went quick. I use the bakers microwave chocolate disk for dipping. It's quick and easy. I also use my pampered chef scoop to get the truffle shape. Makes my job easier and not as messy.

Loved these!! They were a huge success and I got multiple requests for the recipe. 
I chilled them before covering in chocolate per other reviews but I found it easier to dip and roll in bowl of chocolate rather than using the spoon technique. I also mixed it up and made with Mint oreos and covered in white chocolate.. delish!!! I will be making these again for sure.

These were absolutely wonderful! I used regular oreo cookies and they turned out great. They were a little hard to dip in the chocolate as it would warm up the cream cheese, but they were worth the effort :) Very sweet! Next time I will try the golden oreos!

My daughter made these for a party.  They were VERY easy and just delicious.  She rolled them a little larger and got 36 truffles, however, I would roll them a bit smaller as they are quite rich.  We also used a 12oz. bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips (it was a lit less expensive than the Baker's chocolate) and there was a lot of chocolate left over.  Next time I'd start with half the bag, you can always melt more chocolate.  This recipe is definitely a keeper and we will certainly make them again!

If your looking for a super easy but looks like you spent a long time making it treat, this is it! I love to make them for when I have guests over and just have a plate of them on the table for easy munching. Make for easy clean up too because there are never any left.

Made these for Memorial Day and they were a huge hit.  Everyone thought they were purchased and not homemade.  I made as directed; however I did freeze the balls before I dipped them for approx 30 minutes.  Turned out GREAT.  I also used only 4 cookies to sprinkle on top and had PLENTY left over.  GREAT RECIPE.

These were really fun and easy to make. I took them to a potluck at my church and got tons of compliments! I made them with several kinds of oreos...peanut butter, mint, fudge, and regular. Loved them all!

What's not to love about these?  I made 1/2 a batch using raspberry oreos. Dipped the chilled truffles in choc. melting wafers. The raspberry flavor really tasted good. I thought about using rasp. extract in the choc coating, but it wasn't necessary. They are very sweet, which could be cut by using  bittersweet choc.

These came out OK. I used exactly the ingredients listed, same brand and all, and I thought they were a bit too sweet. Next time I think I'll use a more high quality bittersweet chocolate.

Great recipe.. I kinda botched it a bit cause I thought chocolate would be too thick at first and I cut it with too much milk, after like 2 days in fridge they were still amazing and a lil more solid.

I have used a similar recipe for years and always get RAVE reviews. I usually add 1 Tsp of vanilla or peppermint extract when making for the kids or 1 Tbsp godiva liquer when making for the adults. I do agree that freezing the balls before dipping really helps. I use hershey or toll house chips for the chocolate then roll them in crushed candy canes for Christmas.

I have made these a few times for parties and have always gotten rave reviews and been asked to bring them back! Different varities of chocholate (semi-sweet, white, mint) and cookies work great too.

You can use all sorts of cookies for these too. I love to make them with chocolate chip cookies. It tastes like cookie dough, but I crush up the store bought kind so they are fully cooked.

The end result is fantastic, but I found them to be really fussy. 

The bakers chocolate I used didn't solidify like it should have. It just ran into pools. Luckily, I had some gulf wax laying around from our peanut butter balls. I melted 2 ounces into 16 ounces of bakers chocolate. It gave the chocolate a nice glossy sheen and everything started hardening properly. Note: if you've never used this before, you have to work fast on sprinkling the the truffles with crumbs.

We used a toothpick (a new one for every ball so the chocolate doesn't collect and leave huge holes) and that worked out for us as long as it was twisted out immediately after setting it on the wax paper. The fork recommendation left big gouges in the truffles.

I sort of shunned the recipe after all that work and little payoff. They didn't taste great after they set for an hour or so. I put them in the fridge overnight. This morning we tried one and they're definitely better. I would recommend at least 24 hours in the fridge so that they really set up. If you serve them too soon you really taste the cream cheese.

I absolutely love these! I made them with chocolate and white chocolate... both were delicious.  I just recently made them with the mint oreos for st patrick's day. I was hoping the inside would be green.  They didn't stay green (probabl because of the dark color of the oreo) but the mint was SO GOOD.  They tasted similar to girl scout thin mints.. probably a little better! I will be making them with the mint oreos from now on! :)

Very easy to make, this is actually my first time making and tasting these :o) So far I have the yummy oreo and cream cheese balls chillin in the fridge, then will be coating them in some chocolate with maybe a hint of peppermint to give them a different kind of flavor. Going to try the spoon way of dipping the balls in chcocolate. Can't wait to see how these turn out.  Ok so they are all done up and waiting to be given to family members. Snuck one to taste and WOW I found it very tasty, creamy, like a fancy'ish oreo lol. Can't wait to hear what the family thinks since this is the first time I've made em.

Excellent!! I used the food processor to crush the cookies to make a nice fine crumble.  Once I mixed in the cream cheese I refrigerated the cookie mix for about 30 minutes, rolled them in balls and refrigerated again before dripping them into a mixture of melted milk&white chocolate.  Then rolled then into chopped walnuts (used food processor).  A-ma-zing!

Taste great, but not worth the effort to me.  You really do need to work fast dipping the frozen balls into the melted chocolate and by doing that the chocolate hardens (too late to add the remaining oreo spinkles).

Very delicious. I use hershey kisses melted instead of the Bakers semi-sweet chocolate. I think it makes them taste a little bit better. The batch I made recently was with the holiday candy cane kisses, they were a HUGE hit!

Easy and sooooooooo decadent!  I refrigerated the truffles before coating in chocolate and it made it easier to deal with.  For about half of the truffles, I also added some peppermint extract to the chocolate for an even more amazing treat.

WOW! Very yummy and everyone raved about these! I experimented and found that using "candy melts" chocolate saves you from having to store them in the fridge for and hour after. If you're crunching for time, try this!

Incredible!  Super easy to make, super good to eat!  My 7 year old niece came through the dining room, looking for more, exclaiming "those chocolate meatballs are WONDERFUL!"  I didnt have a processor.  We just used a rolling pin and plastic bags.  So we mixed the cream cheese up by hand, and I think literally with our hands by the end of it.  I did chill them off before rolling, and then again before dipping.  I wasn't part of the dipping, but I think my sister ended up using a fork and a slotted spoon.  I used Milk Chocolate chips that I melted in the microwave.  Some of the balls were a little bigger than others but we tried to make them bite size, knowing they were going to be super rich.  I did use Fat-Free cream cheese and they were still excellent!  Will make again next year (and maybe again this year)

Very simple recipe, received nothing but compliments! I mixed everything, chocolate crumbs and cream cheese, in a food processor. Found the mix was a little easier to roll into balls after refrigerating for an hour or so. Just a tip, I ended up putting the balls on the end of a fork and pouring the melted chocolate over them, then sliding it gently off onto parchment paper.

I made this for the teachers potluck, and it got rave reviews from all!  I substitued the Semi-Sweet baking chocolate with German Chocolate.  I also used Great Value brand of "oreo" cookies from Walmart, to save money. This is so easy and delicious.  They "look" beautiful too.

Amazing.  I used mint oreos - yum!! Instead of the baking chocolate, I used chocolate almond bark at the suggestion of a family member - it worked great.  I chilled the insides in the freezer for a few hours, stuck them each with a toothpick, and dipped them in the almond bark (melted over low-low heat).  I learned that if you leave the toothpicks in and spin them out once they've cooled a bit, the hole you need to cover is much smaller and it didn't fall apart for me. Will be making these again for sure!  Update: made again with Nutter Butters - very good also, but I think I prefer the oreo.

Taste delicious!  I've made 2 batches so far.  One with regular Oreo cookies and the other with Peppermint Oreo cookies.  My problem is getting them to look good after dipping in the chocolate.  Still working on that!

So good and a crowd pleaser!  I used mint oreos because I love chocolate mint.  Another review suggested using a slotted spoon instead of a toothpick and I found that to be very helpful.

These truffles are excellent and very easy to make. I followed advice from other reviews and used a beater to mix the crumbs and cream cheese together. I then used a one tablespoon cookie scoop to measure out the dough before rolling it into balls. Next into the freezer for one hour before dipping into melted white chocolate chips. Sprinkles on top and voila! The truffles are VERY rich but I still prefer the oreo fudge over these.

Excellent recipe. I did not have any trouble with crumbling. I made sure the cream cheese was very soft and then mixed cream cheese with finely chopped cookies with my hands (after a thorough washing of course:). This allowed me to really combine the ingredients and form into large ball. They sat in fridge while I prepared the dipping chocolate-and perfecto! Sinfully rich!

These are delicious and I don't even like cream cheese. I mix butter with the chocolate morsels till the consistency is a little thinner because it makes it easier to coat. You can either use a small crock pot or you can melt in the microwave for 1 minute, mix, and then 20 second increments. To make dipping easier, I used a big spoon with slits in it, so the extra chocolate drips off & transport the truffle with a tiny spoon to parchment paper.

these were really yummy. the only problem i had were that i had trouble melting the chocolate. it just all globed together. so i had to add milk which ofcourse, wouldn't harden later. so they were a sticky yet yummy mess.

Very good.  Will use  my food processor to process the cookies next time - used a plastic bag & rolling pin & the cookies stuck to the side of the bag making it more work.  Dipped some in white & some in chocolate coating & used different autumn sprinkles on them.  Will make a nice treat for Thanksgiving tomorrow. :)

Always turns out great - and very easy recipe to remember and share with co-workers. After dipping in white chocolate keep some melted chocolate reserved and add instant coffee to taste... makes a mocha drizzle that is yummy! and a very elegant presentation.

It was easy enough for my kids to help me making them:)  They wanted to lick their fingers while shaping the balls which was a "no, no"...!  I took them to teachers Thanksgiving luncheon today and it was gone by the end.  It was a little sweet for me, but few have asked for the recipe, so it was great:)

We own the local jewelery store and every November we do a ladies night.  I always get to do the baking for these events.  I made these truffles.  They turned absolutely AMAZING!  I had several people ask for the recipe and a few even asked where I bought them!!  Def the best truffle recipe I've ever tried!

This is a simple and quick dessert.  I can make these in a jiffy.  Always nice to bring to a friend's house and they go great with a tall glass of cold milk!  To answer an previous question, yes, you do grind up the whole cookie; including the cream filling.

I can't believe that I've never rated this before...we have been making these for many years and everyone absolutely LOVES them! Very simple to prepare and great flavor. Sometimes I dip them in milk chocolate and sometimes in white chocolate, both are fantastic. This is a recipe that that will remain popular through the years (as long as oreos and cream cheese exist, lol)~YUM! :)

This has become one of our new favorites.  I had to scale it back (what a shame) because I had one bag of mini Oreos to use.  I dipped (or rather poured over) these into white chocolate and them topped with some some fall sprinkles.  Refrigerated them to set up, and they are yummy!!!  Will be making these again - I think they would be great to take to a holiday party, especially with all the decorations you could use.

Very good but rich.  Used magic bullet to chop up Oreo's.  After making into balls, stuck in freezer for 2 hours before dipping in chocolate.

I make these every year around Christmas time and their a big hit.  To make more of a variety I also dip in vanilla almond bark, and use nutter butter cookies instead of the oreo for a peanut butter truffle.

This was so easy and the finished product was great!  A great alternative to cookies and cupcakes at bake sales.    I served mine on candy sticks.  The kids loved them!

These are delicious .. They take a little time to make and i suggest only taking a few out of the freezer at a time they melt pretty quickly which makes them harder to put chocolate on.  But other then that my whole family loves them!!

These were really good, and easy to make.  They were a little too sweet for me, but my husband and guests LOVED them.  I didn't think that the 9 leftover cookies were enough to coat all of these - next time I'd grind up more for the coating.  I also found 1 bag of chocolate chips to be enough, and when I ran out of cookie crumbs, I just rolled them in the chocolate by itself.

OMG!!! These were the bomb! Got rave reviews. Easiest way I found to dip in melted chocolate was to use two forks and set onto wax paper to harden. You can make these for any occasion and add accents (additional colored candy melts drizzled over, candy sprinkles for whatever holiday/event you are celebrating.) Yum!!!

fantastic recipe - I didn't dip them in chocolate but drizzled melted white chocolate on the top in a decorative design for a wedding cookie tray. It was a last minute addition to the tray but the hit of the cookie eaters.  So easy.   This recipe is truly a keeper to be added to the holiday cookie trays from now on!

I make desserts for our family restaurant. One day I was in a hurry and didn't go through the trouble of dipping these in chocolate. No one minded and they sold out just as fast as usual. Now I never dip them and save a lot of time and mess!

Excellent !  Easy and decadent.  I made 100 to give as Valentines to our church women's group.  People could not believe it when I told them they were made of oreo cookies and cream cheese.  I've had lots of requests for the recipe.  I didn't sprinkle them with crushed cookes but rather drizzles them with white chocolate.  They looked great.

Super easy to make.  My family loved them made them for desert.  They did not last long.  Dipped some half with white chocolate.  As the other reviewers stated chill them before you dip them and you will not have any issues.

I made these for a family get together and they LOVED them! They are easier to roll when you stick them in the freezer for a little bit before dipping and I used a toothpick which worked fine for the first half until the mixture thawed out. Also, instead of sprinkleing them with the cookie mixture, I sprinkled powder sugar on top of them. Pretty! And yummy!

These are amazingly easy and incredibly yummy and RICH!  I made these for my husband and son who both love oreos.  I personally do not care for oreos (at all)...so I really wasn't even planning on tasting.  Well, after they went on and on about them - I decided to give one a try!  I actually thought they were outta this world yummy.  Granted, they are extremely rich and I can't imagine eating more than one - but WOW - the taste and texture were not what I expected and a very pleasant suprise.  I did freeze the mixture before rolling in chocolate and it seemed to do the trick.  I mixed chocolate almond bark with white chocolate chips and that made a WONDERFUL coating (again...very rich)!

Simple and fun! Add them for decoration to a cake or decorate them with fun colored sprinkles. I might make these and add other candies to make spiders on Halloween. I have a 3 yr old Spidermand fan!

Wow!  Good!  Easy to make!  My daughters helped me make the balls and loved it.  Of course they had to try one and make sure that their work was quality :).  Many other reviewers stated that they had problems with the balls falling apart when they were coating them.  I did not have this problem at all.  Just make sure that when you roll the cookie/cream cheese balls, you roll them until they are solid.  I told my daughters it was like playing with playdough.  I used white coating and reserved a small amount.  I colored the reserve coating green for St. Patty's Day and made criss-crosses over the tops.  They looked store quality!  You could use any color if you use the white.  You can also use different sandwich cookies for different flavors.  I'm going to make them in the shape of eggs for Easter!

Pretty good.  My guests liked them more than I did.  I think the filling makes a better filling for a cake - and I was right!  I used the oreo-cream cheese stuff in a cake layer and it was a huge hit!

This is a great recipe. I followed other reviewers but freezing the pre-made balls for 10 minutes in the freezer prior to dipping in chocolate. They turned out wonderful. I used them in a cookie exchange and they went like hot cakes!

I could only give four strars because the chocolate on the outside ruined them. I put white chocolate on the outside after reading peoples comments and they were to die for! I did, however, use a mold, but they still turned out perfect!

For sure the most popular item at our party. I was almost embarrassed to admit how easy they were. Next time I make them I'm going to split them in half and do half chocolate & half white chocolate for the outer coating. Also, don't be afraid to make them small - they go along way!

I make these every year and alway get requests for the recipe. It's easy to improvise with. This year I used mint oreos and sprinkled candy cane pieces on top. Make sure you freeze the truffles before you dip them in chocolate. This way they don't fall apart as you're dipping.

Pretty easy to make.  Had a little bit of clean-up time, but then again, I'm a messy baker.  I found that using my blender worked (as I do not have a food processor).  I put in about 4 cookies at a time and used the chop and grate settings.  I found that it is important to make sure you follow the directions and have the balls pre-rolled BEFORE you melt the chocolate and start dipping.  I melted 4 oz of the chocolate first (1 package)and dipped 1/2 the batch.  Then, I melted the other 4 oz. of chocolate and dipped the rest of the batch.  This kept the chocolate from hardening too quickly.  Didn't take too long to make, and this was with me entertaining a 1 1/2 year old during the process!!

These are my daughters favorite treat.  She is turning 6 this week and has requested these as a birthday treat.  She has re-named them "chocolate meatballs". Wonderful treat for both kids and adults. I make them with almond bark coating and drizzle with dark chocolate.  The look beautiful!

All I can say is WOW about this recipe. The result is absolutely AMAZING. I could probably type pages of praise about this recipe. I had no idea that with just these three ingredients you could make something that tastes like you would pick up in a gourmet chocolate shop! The inside is so creamy and rich and the coating perfectly compliments it. It doesn't even taste like cookies were used to make them at all!  I let the balls chill overnight to make it easier to dip and I melted my chocolate in a glass bowl over a saucepan of simmering water. With the balls chilled that long, I had absolutely no problem dipping them. So easy, so delicious, I DEFINITELY recommend this recipe to anyone!!!

These take some time and effort but they are delish. Its easy enoughg to mix it up using mint or PB oreos, but avoid the double stuffed oreos. You can also sub 1 can of sweetened condensed milk for the cream cheese if you are worried about the truffles sitting out -- however they are much better with cream cheese.

Originally, a friend made these for me and they were delicious. So, although I'm generally inept at baking, I decided to give it a try. Because my local grocery store didn't have precisely what the recipe called for, I made these substitutions: 1) 12 oz. Oreo cookies 2) 8 oz. Nestle semi-sweet chocolate.  Overall, the truffles came out pretty good. VERY RICH. I think I am only capable of eating one before needing to stop for hour for another. I do wish I had used some oil and the slotted spoon idea because dipping the chocolate definitely needed both.  So with this these proportions and making slightly bigger truffles, my friends and I made approximately 25 truffles. Good enough size to individually wrap and hand off as gifts. Overall, though, very very easy to make. The longest time is the cooling, and the most difficult step is properly coating the oreo/cream cheese balls. I would recommend this recipe to others.

these truffles are yummy! it is pretty simple to make, but as a first time baker/new cook, I had no idea how to melt chocolate. So suggest looking that up if you don't know now, cause its trickier then it seems. I burnt my first batch of chocolate. And I suggest using the microwave. To coat the balls, I had a laddle full of chocolate, and used a spoon to roll my chilled balls around. This worked beautifully, and the truffles turned out pretty!

I have been making these for the past few years, and they are requested at every family function.  I make regular oreos with white chocolate and golden oreos with milk chocolate.  The original recipe is the best, but it is definitely a recipe you can change up for great results every time.

These are so good! I used white chocolate almond bark instead of melting the baking chocolate because its easier I think. It made quite a few and after our get together they were all gone. So delicious. If you're an Oreo fan you'll love these.

I made these for Christmas and everyone raved about them. I couldn't make enough. They are best after refrigeration. If you eat them right away, they don't taste anything like the final product. These are also very easy for kids to make.

We call these "Oreo Cookie Balls". They are SO very easy, a little time consuming in the rolling and dipping, BUT so worth your time. Be sure to make alot because you will see they dissapear FAST! "Trust in the LORD with all your heart" ~Proverbs 3:5

I don't know why everyone has had such a hard time with these in the chocolate. First of all you MUST use double stuff Oreos. Put them in the food processor until finely ground. Then throw in 8 oz. package of cream cheese and you might have to stop the processor and stir it around a little to get it to mix well. It will form into a huge glob when it gets well mixed. Then use a teaspoon to make the balls and put on a cookie sheet. Stick a toothpick in the middle and put in the freezer for at least an hour. I use half a package of white almond bark and chocolate almond bark. Only melt one kind at a time so it is nice and melted while you are covering the balls. Follow the directions on the almond bark package to melt. Then dip the chilled balls in the almond bark and place back on the cookie tray to harden. Cover half with white and half with chocolate almond bark. Then melt one more square of each kind of almond bark and drizzle over the tops of the truffles. If the chilled balls start to fall off of the toothpicks while you are trying to dip them then stick them back in the freezer for a few minutes to rechill. SO yummy and such a crowd pleaser.

This recipe was the easiest!  I did chill the mixture 1 hour before forming into balls.  I also made some with a white chocolate dip and some Christmasy sprinkles.  Chocolate and cream cheese...what's not to like!!

I made these for a holiday party and they are amazing! I actually made them with fat free cream cheese and reduced fat oreos to make them a little "healthier," and they were DELICIOUS! You would never even know that they were made with the fat free stuff! We had our chocolate fountain running the night of the party so we simply held the balls under the running fountain, which created a nice, smooth coating. I am going to make them again, as per the request of some family and friends, however I am going to use regular Baker's chocolate, so we shall see how it goes using some other user's suggestions for easy dipping!

Personally I LOVED these, but Im a big sweets fan, alot of people thought they were to sweet, even I could only eat 2 or 3 of them. I did exactly how the recipe said, except i didnt have a food processer so i used a blender which is a pain because you can only crush about 5 or 6 at a time. I didnt have a double boiler so i used a saucepan with boiling water with a larger saucepan laid over it. I found the chocolate stiffened fast after about the first half and they were starting to look sloppy, a added a little bit of milk which did wonders!!! They were definitly yummy!

These are super easy and taste wonderful! I found that when melting the chocolate to coat them, it was easier to put 2 tbsp of butter with the chocolate so that the chocolate didn't dry out.   Also, I substituted sprinkling cookie crumbs on top at the end with a sprinkle of powdered sugar  Next time I plan on trying out different flavors of oreo... maybe mint, or maybe the white oreos with white chocolate!!

These are simply delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great.  My daughter and I made them and gave them away at Christmas and everyone loved them.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  Yummy!

The Best!  I made these for Holiday treats and everyone thought I purchased them.  Tricks: Use a tablespoon to make the oreo balls.  Then put in freezer for at least  1 1/2 hours; this makes it easier to coat the balls in chocolate.  Melt the chocolate in a double boiler and add a small peice of baking wax (this gives a professional gourmet look).  To dip the chocolate use a spoon.  Then place on wax paper.

WOW.  All I can say is WOW.  These are so good.  Made them for a platter for my husband to take to work and received rave reviews.  They were so good I'm making a 2nd batch for us for New Year's (before I start that diet!!).  I found the dipping process a bit tricky but I put the truffles in the fridge until firm then used a fork and spoon to roll them in melted chocolate chips and it worked pretty well.  They sure tasted great!  Will think of a way to make them look a little prettier-I sprinkled the pile with colored sugar and I think melted white chocolate or powdered sugar or something would make them look nicer.  But I love them as they are!  UPDATE:  The ones dipped in white chocolate were even better!!!  And they looked prettier too!

I made this on 3 consecutive nights.  The first night I crushed the oreos and mixed it all together and put it in the fridge.  The next night I made them into balls using a cookie scoop and put them in the freezer.  The following night I dipped them in the chocolate and drizzled with cream cheese icing.  They were perfect and it was nice to do it a little at a time.

Thought these were delicious.  I used mint oreos and reduced fat cream cheese and feel that it left the inside a bit "doughy", so next year I may use the regular cream cheese.  I reserved 9 cookies for toppings as the recipe stated, however, I feel that 3 maybe 4 would have been plenty and used the remaining in the mix.  I dipped mine in Baker's white chocolate mixed with some crisco to give it a nice shine and much easier to dip.  I sprinkled with cookies crumbs and also colored sugar---so pretty and very tasty.

The taste is so awesome! Tastes just like what the pros make. Some hints: 1. Use a food processor. It's SO much easier and the idea of rolling over OREOs in a plastic bag doesn't work. (I tried it, and it was a mess.) 2. Make sure to refrigerate or freeze the dough before and after making balls to keep the balls firm. 3. I rolled the balls in melted chocolate with a spoon and I scooped chcocolate onto the balls with a spoon as well. The fork/toothpick way is just too awkward. 4. You better refrigerate these if you want them to stay good. The cream cheese inside will go bad when exposed to warm temperatures for too long. Overall, I love it!

These were extremely easy to make. Rolling them in little balls was very easy and then placing them in the refrigerator made them easy to dip them in chocolate. Be sure to spoon them out the chocolate and not fork them out.

These to me were just OK.. not bad but not spectacular either. More trouble than they were worth really. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of rolling the balls in the extra crumbs, didn't do that. Also used a handful of holiday peppermint oreos along with the regular ones. All they really tasted like was mushed oreos, maybe I did something wrong? Also, I made half last night and half this morning. The half of the mixture that I put in the fridge overnight kinda fell apart and was hard to roll into balls this morning. Probably won't make again.

Absolutely DECADENT!!! I made the mixture, rolled them into balls and placed them in the freezer for about an hour. When I dipped them in the chocolate they held together beautifully. Didn't get any oreo residue in the chocolate. Wonderful recipe!

These are sooo good.  I dipped them in chocolate and white chocolate and put them in a tin to give as gifts for Christmas. Just remember to keep these refrigerated as they do not keep well left out due to the cream cheese. This is my 2nd year making these to give as gifts and they are such a hit.  You will look like a star!  Insanely easy too!

These are wonderful. I brought some to work today and have never heard such rave reviews. I did read the frustrations from past reviewers on dipping the ball into the chocolate. So, I used a gravy ladle which worked perfect. Spooned a little melted chocolate in the bottom, dropped in a ball, spooned a little chocolate over the top then scooped it out with the spoon. I only chilled the dough in the freezer for maybe 10 minutes and did not have any fall apart. I also used my food processor to crush the oreos and my kitchen aid to mix. They could not have been easier or more perfect.

These were delicious! I ended up putting them in the fridge before dipping them in chocolate (for 2 hours because I had other things I needed to do). I ended up melting my chocolate in a bowl over a pot of boiling water and then just left it on there so the chocolate would stay nice and runny. I dropped the truffle balls into the chocolate, used a fondue fork to swirl them around, and then used 2 fondue forks to pull them out - worked great! I'll definately be making these again!

I've never made candy before but made this with the nutter butter substitution for a contest and won 1st place. Other tips:  1. I used more cream cheese than in the recipe to avoid the crumbliness.    2. I chilled the dough for an hour before dipping.  3. Used almond bark for the chocolate.  4. After the dipped candies had cooled and hardened, I melted butterscotch chips and drizzled in a zig zag pattern across the top, and sprinkled on crushed butterfinger.  Better to do with a helper so you can add it quickly before the butterscotch starts to dry.  5.  I stored it in an airtight container in the fridge for 5 days, then let it "breathe" uncovered in room temp for 6 hrs.

These are so easy and taste so great! My plan had been to make just one batch and I dipped them in Nestle's Mint and Choc. chips.  These were so good that I decided to make another batch and try dipping them in white choc.  What a beautiful platter they make with both white and brown choc. mixed together!  If I had to pick...the white is a more attractive truffle.  Oh...even 5 oreos is too much to keep as crumbs for the top.  Next time, I'll only use 3 at the most.

My husband and I made these for the first time last night and they taste great! If you don't have a food processor I recommend taking the filling out of the oreos before crushing them with a rolling pin, and then just add the filling to the mixture. Also, as for dipping them in the chocolate, I found it worked best to stick the balls in the freezer for 15-20 minutes, and then dip them in chocolate using a tooth pick. We tried covering them with chocolate using a spoon as some suggested but it was very messy!!! Next time we make these I will use milk chocolate or even white chocolate. Great recipe!

These are really easy to make and delicious. The only thing I changed was I used Wilton's candy melts to roll them in instead of the baker's.

I have made these so many times and always get a "wow" & "these are awesome". My sister-in-law hides them from my brother...lol. I use the candy coating..dip some in chocolate & some in the vanilla and drizzle vice-versa in the opposite flavor. Also use chocolate sprinkles on top. My fave is the vanilla w/ chocolate drizzled on top w/ buttered toasted finely chopped pecans on top..yumm. Have also used the multi-colored sprinkles for the kids. Will be making these tomorrow for Christmas gifts.

These were a hit! I made them with candy cane oreos, and everyone loved them! I am making more this week and trying them with the golden oreos and regular oreos. A good tip that many people suggested was to refridgerate the balls before coating, this seemed to make the process easier. I also spooned the chocolate on instead of dipping, which was also easier and less messy for me.

These are yummy!  They are not as rich as normal truffles, they are more sweet than your average chocolate truffle.  I've used different flavors of Oreos and they are all great.  However, I would recommend using dipping chocolate instead of baking because it looks nicer, hardens nicely and doesn't melt in your hands while you eat them.

This was my first time ever making truffles.  They were so amazing.  I actually didn't even use all of the crushed cookies with the cream cheese.  I chilled the balls while using my crockpot to warm the chocolate.  It was just perfect.  Will be making these for friends soon.

These are fantastic. It doesn't sound like much reading the ingredients, but these got raves from everyone and were the first thing to go off the gift trays. I chilled these until they were firm before dipping in chocolate and it worked out well. I only made a single batch but seeing as they were such a hit next time I will double this. Thanks, this was so easy!

Very easy to make, but VERY sweet.  I decorated the tops with chocolate jimmies instead of the crushed cookies, and served them in paper truffle cups.  They looked really professional, and noone could believe that they only had 3 ingredients.  I can't wait to try them with nutter butters and milk chocolate!

I've been making these for years now, everyone is always asking for them.  I got the recipe from a "Kraft" magazine.  I always use the mint Oreo cookies in mine because I love the combination of chocolate and mint.  My only suggestion/adjustment is that you don't quite need 9 cookies for the topping, I'd say you could get away w/ 5 or 6.  I always have too much crumbs for topping left over.

Yum! I'm a begginer in the dessert dept. These were relatively easy but the review tips were a huge help! I used only about 25 cookies for these. Also I found from other suggestions that freezing the balls before dipping was much easier than handling them soft or even chilled. I also froze the finished product for an hour before packaging them as Holiday gifts.

Really yummy, really easy.  I coated them using Nestle Dark Chocolate and Mint Morsels -- the bag's a bit smaller than the usual bag of semi-sweet morsels, so you'll probably want two bags, but they melt easily and the end product tastes AMAZING.

I've made these many times...i've got nothing but good response from EVERYONE who tries them. The one change I made was using white chocolate instead of regular chocolate. For the holiday season I recommend adding come crushed candy cane to the tops...it makes them look and taste that much better!

Great recipe!  My husband and son are addicted to these things.  I took them to a party recently and everyone requested the recipe.  Even the pickiest eaters love these.  I actually dip them in white chocolate, though it seems to be harder to work with than milk chocolate.  My experience is that Candi-Quick works the best.  It comes in a microwaveable tray that's quick and easy to use.  I make the balls using a small scoop and refrigerate for a while to firm them up (makes them easier to dip).  I simply plop the ball in the tray of chocolate and spoon the chocolate over the top.  The I lift it out with a fork to allow the excess chocolate to drip off.  Then I place them on a metal baking sheet covered with wax paper.  It will take 2 trays of Candi-Quick to cover all the balls.

I enjoyed this recipe a lot, but like some others, the cream 'cheesiness' was a little too much.   I cut the CC in 1/2 to 4 oz and added 3 oz of butter.  The consistency was the same.  To replace the richness (w/o the cheese flavor) of the cream cheese I added 3 Tbl of KAHLUA....who can argue with a little kick in their truffle.  They turned out great

Easy with only 3 ingredients but what a MESS to make. The oreo/cream cheese mix is very greasy then trying to cover them in chocolate is a total mess - I did use semi-sweet chocolate chips so maybe that was the problem.  I was very disappointed. My friend said it tasted great, but was very rich (I don't eat chocolate) !

delicious!  You can use a 1tbs. dipper it, the stainless steel scoop with the sqeeze release handle.  It makes equal balls and gives a flat bottom for them to sit  on the wax paper.  No rolling needed! I had 48 ready to dip in under 10 minutes.

Very good and easy to make. Just a tad messy just to warn you. Use a food processor to chop up the cookies into fine pieces, and with a hand held mixer, use this to blend the cream cheese & cookie crumbs. I put the whole mixture into the fridge for an hour at least (overnight if you can, works the best). I use a small cookie scoop to make the balls, and dip with a fork (put ball at the edge of fork) and use a spoon to pour chocolate over it. I also dye the white chocolate red and green during Christmas time. These are a hit and everyone enjoyed them!

Newmans cookies work great and have better indgrdients than Oreos.  I also like to use a white chocolate.  Giradelli makes all natural white chips now. I would love to find a similiar recipe that does not require refrigeration.

Wow!  Just perfection!  I wanted to test these out (& didn't want too many around the house) so I made 1/4 recipe.  I followed the tip of a previous reviewer & broke the two middle tongs off of two plastic forks & used them to dip -great idea!  I dipped them in Wilton's Light Coco candy melts & then drizzled them with some semi-sweet chocolate that I added a little shortening & Wilton's Creme De Menthe candy flavoring to.  After reading reviews, I was worried that these would be a major pain to make but they were surprisingly easy & impressive -especially considering that they are rich & a little goes a long way!

I thought this were just OK. Honestly I think I prefer my Oreos in their original form...with a glass of milk. I didn't think these were worth all the work.

Oh. my. god. These are phenomenal. I had a lot of trouble melting my chocolate (especially the white - so much so I ended up making it into a paste and manually covering the truffles) and dipping. I chilled the truffle for 15 minutes before balling and chilled one hour before dipping. This is a must!! I'm trying to think of a reason for making another batch this week... Oh! I used REDUCED FAT cream cheese and Oreos - couldn't taste a difference and didn't feel as guilty!

These are really easy and delicious!  My family always requests these around the holidays and I have added several variations to make them different; mint oreos, nutter butter, and I've also added different flavorings to the chocolate such as almond & mint for an extra kick.

These are so rich, delicious and simple!  They taste just like truffles/candy from an upscale candy shop and are also very pretty when using holiday colored OREO'S! Five stars plus from me!

Awesome!  Much easier to do when I just throw the cream cheese into the food processor with the oreo crumbs.  I also used melted semisweet chocolate and oil for the ganache topping.

These were delicious!  I froze them on a cookie sheet in balls and then, dipped them using the spoon and fork method.  Better the next day.

These truffles were amazing! Way better than I ever expected. I followed the recipe exactly, and they came out perfect. No need to make adjustments. I only froze the truffles for two hours and they were fine. I love watching everybody's reaction when they take that first bite. I will try putting toothpicks in the truffles next time to make dipping them in the chocolate easier. I will definitely be giving these as gifts this year in little Christmas tins.

These are AMAZING!!! I made these last year at Christmas, and sprinkled them with red and green sprinkles.  I plan on making more this year and giving them away as gifts.  I also like to use the milk chocolate melting chocolate you can get at Hobby Lobby.  Last year I made them too big, thinking my cookie scoop would be too small.  They are SOOO rich that I will make them smaller this year!  Yummmmm!!  Thank you, thank you for sharing this recipe!!

Oh so delicious!! I made half the batch using milk chocolate dipping chocolate because I ran out of semi-sweet, and I actually liked the taste better. No one had any complaints about either batch, though. I also used reduced fat cream cheese, but the taste and texture were still great. Take note, these are A LOT more time and labor intensive than I had initially planned. The dipping process became pretty trial and error for me. I topped the truffles with orange stripes for Halloween, and you couldn't tell that I hadn't quite figured out the dipping, though. I'll be waiting until I have a food processor for crushing the Oreos before I make these again, but they're wonderful!!

Hmmm....I;d like to give thid recipe 5 stars for taste but 4 stars for being WAY off on the time it takes to do this recipe.  You definately need to chill the cookie mixture for at least an hour before you dip them in melted chocolate.  I also found it helpful to inset a tooth pick into eacg ball before chilling them on a wax paper lined cookie sheet.  This made it much easier to dip the balls in melted chocolate.  I found melting the chocolate on the stove in a steel bowl over hot water made for really smooth chocolate.  Make sure you a tsp. of shortening to the melted chocolate to give it a nice sheen.  You will need to be really careful when taking the toothpick out after dipping the ball in chocolate but trust me, this method works the best!

I cant begin to tell you the reaction you will get from people when they eat one of these....They think you are the most talented and best thing ever. These are ridiculously easy to make and they taste like they came from a professional. I made these for a freinds bridal shower..... gone in 60 seconds. Well almost. Make them.

these are great... i cannot believe that the simple ingredients become so impressive. I giggle when people say "you made these?!" because they're so easy and there are so few ingredients. make sure you chill the balls before dipping them. not only does it help to keep the chocolate smooth and clean, it also helps them retain their shape. I added reese's pieces to a few, some butterfinger, butterscotch, etc. i dipped some in white chocolate, also. I made a few different shapes, too. thanks for making me look good!

I refrigerated the oreo mixture before rolling for 10 minutes, and then put the rolled balls in the freezer for 15 minutes before dipping into white chocolate. Tasted like cookies and cream. Very good.

I like to mix in a little vanilla extract (or another flavor if you like) to the oreo/cream cheese mixture.  I also refrigerate the oreo mixture prior to rolling in the melted chocolate.

These are really easy, fun to make and absolutely delicious.  We didn't make them for any occasion, just messing around on a Sat.  I don't have a food processor but I do have a 13yr old son who was more than happy to crush the cookies in a ziploc bag & that method worked really well.  I also used the Baker's baking chocolate squares for dipping b/c thats what I had on hand.  I melted a box w/a little shorting and it worked just fine.  I used a melon baller for the scooping and shaping which was really easy.  Some people mentioned that they fell apart easy but, I never had that problem.  I also didn't refrigerate before I dipped, the chocolate didn't harden until I sat them in the freezer when I was all finished.  It only took about 15 min. until they were ready.  I can't wait to make these for a special occasion and decorate them really pretty.  I took a pic of them but didn't dress them up which they looked fine but there is a lot of potential there.  Thanks for this great recipe!

You also put the insides of the cookie (the cream) into the food processor.  The recipe wasn't clear on that and I had to think about it long and hard.  I was worried the cream would get stuck in the processor blades but in the end, it was finely grounded into the cookie crumbs.  I wouldn't sprinkle it with the crumbs at the end.  It's more attractive if you leave the chocolate shiny.

Husband loves these. I tried the recipe with lemon cookies and white chocolate. Not as good as the OREOs.

I have mixed feelings about these truffles. While they truly were easy for me, the end result did not suit my taste. After sitting in the freezer in an airtight container for a few hours I only tasted all the flavours separately and I didn't like the tang of the cream cheese. I tried one today and it seems that all the flavours needed time to meld together as I did not taste the cream cheese today. Now I love Oreos, but for some reason, as much as I want to love these, I can't. They aren't bad per say, but it's not something I would make often or in large quantities. It just didn't make my taste buds dance.

I thought these were just ok. I did half in white and half in milk chocolate(Bakers)The milk (semi-sweet) went much faster than white chocolate. They are definitely rich. Little too much chocolate for me but the kids enjoyed making (oh what a mess) and eating them. Not a truffle for sure. Don't think I would make again but thank you for the recipe.

Super easy to make. Made it for people and my work and they loved it. They all asked for the recipe and for me to make it again. One suggestion, I would only use the Baker's chocolate, I tried using nestle chips the second time and it was pain and didnt work as well

I just made this tonight. They are good, but VERY rich. I made half with Almond Bark, and they turned out better in my opinion.  The almond bark was not as rich and you could actually taste OREO!  So this was a good recipe. I will just make it with almond bark in the future. Enjoy!

Made these last weekend for a birthday party, they were awesome! A lot of people mention having trouble with the dipping, I used a technique that worked for me...use one of those miniature ice cream scoops to form the balls, then stick them in the freezer for about half an hour. Take them out and stick toothpicks in them before dipping them in chocolate/toppings (I used chocolate sprinkles, they worked well), and then put them in mini cupcake papers and let them chill in the freezer again. You can either serve them with the toothpicks in, or take them out and turn them over for a more "perfect" look.

I have to disagree with so many people on here.  I'm shocked by this because I'm really not a great cook and I usually make a mess of the kitchen when I do use it!  This took me from start to finish almost exactly 1 1/2 hours. I used Nutter Butters as some other people suggested so I don't know if the peanut butter makes them stick together better than the Oreo filling, but I had no problem rolling them or covering them with the melted chocolate.  I put the mixture in the freezer for like 10 minutes before making the balls (rolled with my hands) but I didn't freeze/chill the balls after I made them.  I went right ahead and stuck a toothpick into them and dipped them right into the chocolate.  They didn't fall apart at all. Some stuck on the toothpick a bit when I tried to put them on the cookie sheet I was using, so I gently helped them off with another toothpick.  I'd say this isn't super fast, but it was really easy and I don't even own a microwave so I had to melt the chocolate right on the stove.  As for the taste, it was very chocolatey like some people mentioned, and mine were kind of dry.  Next time I'll probably use fewer Nutter Butters (or whatever I mix in there) and maybe more cream cheese.  Regardless, with the sprinkled topping, they look great and professional almost and were really, really easy I thought.   Thanks!  :)

I like dipping these in white chocolate. It gives it a different type of taste. More of an "inside-out" approach! Always a hit at parties. Very yummy with Mint flavored Oreos too! Dye the white chocolate to make them pretty on the table too!

I could eat these until I got sick. They were a big hit with my family at Christmas too!! Be sure to chill the mixture before you roll it into balls, and only take out half the mixture at a time. It's also good to chill/freeze these for a while before you try to dip them. Makes the process much easier.

O.k.  I made these for Mother's Day. I personnally did not care for them. But half my extended family did. More like the consistency of a chewy brownie in the middle than a truffle. I don't think I will be making them again and I don't think the word "easy" should be put in frontn of the name...because they were not.

These were awesome! The store was out of Bakers baking chocolate so I got semi-sweet chocolate chips instead, they worked wonderfully. The dipping process was messy, slow and a little hard. At first I was using my hands, but they just fell apart, so I got a fork, placed a ball in the bowl and used the fork to scoop the melted chocolate on top of the ball. I found out that the more you moved the actual ball, the more it fell apart. So try and move the ball as little as possible. A great recipe, and I will definitely make again!!!

I actually got this recipe from a friend whose son now requests these instead of birthday cake!  
Oh so good!  Brought them to a Christmas party last year and they were literally the first item to go.  I sprinkled colored sugars on them and used white and dark chocolate.  Cannot go wrong!  Enjoy!!

These were very very good!  The only reason I gave this 4 stars was because I had to keep sticking the balls in the freezer to keep them from falling apart when dipping them in the chocolate.  I used the semi sweet chocolate and the vanilla flavored almond bark.  I like the almond bark better and I think it looked prettier especially with the contrast of colors from the oreo cookie crumbs.

I made this for a party and it was well received.  I got my recipe from another place and was told to use the candy chocolate you get at craft stores, don't worry about that, getting chocolate chips from the grocery store worked just as well. I covered mine with dark chocolate and then did a white chocolate drizzle over them after, so they were pretty. Only things I didn't like: 1. Dipping was a pain, maybe should have gotten that dipping spoon. Use something wider than a measuring cup, next time, i might try a square baking dish surrounded by a hot towel or something to keep the chocolate melty longer. 2. do not get water in your chocolate. 3. These are very rich so I suggest maybe dipping one half in dark chocolate, let them cool, dip the other half in white chocolate. 4. Next time I will use a non-chocolate cookie, maybe peanut butter or ginger snap.

These were wonderfully easy to make...until I tried the chocolate dipping part.  I now just roll them in finely chopped nuts instead (I use all the cookies in the truffles and don't reserve any for topping).  They don't need to be any more chocolatey, and the nuts (I used pecans) are a great complement to the taste.

Fantastic! I used white chocolate instead of semisweet. Also I used the food processor to mix in the cream cheese. Then chill for a while to make rolling into balls easier.

I have made these twice using Oreos.  I made them most recently using Nutter Butters instead.  I never thought they could be better than with Oreos, but I definitely like them better with the Nutter Butters.  I used 30 cookies, but it seemed a little dry, so I might use fewer next time.  I did use a little of the crumbled cookies on top and I think it makes them look nice.

YUMMY!! These are delicious, but you have to be a chocolate lover because these are so rich!! I did have with white chocolate, and half with semi-sweet. I melted my chocolate in the microwave- very easy, just 50% power and stir about every 30 secs. Also, put the oreo balls in the freezer while you melt the chocolate or you'll have melted oreo balls!! I bended all the oreos in the food processor first, then added the softened cream cheese. Very good!!

I made a recipe just like this, except using white almond bark instead of semi-sweet chocolate for dipping.  These are SO good!!  I drizzled melted milk chocolate chips on top for a professional look.  I gave some away as a gift and the recipient was just raving.  They are easy, but time-consuming with all the dipping.

These were great.  The only change I might make next time would be to use white chocolate and the semi-sweet together.

This is very simple but time consuming, especially when you are making alot. I made 250 of these things for all of my staff and clients for the holidays. They each got a celephane bags with a few of these in them. Everyone raved about it, some even asked for the recipe. My advice is to freeze the balls on a waxed lined cookie sheet before and after dipping them in the chocolate and try to keep them partially frozen until you serve them. They taste much better. I also did not reserve any of the processed oreos for re-dipping. It seemed like an unnecessary step. To make them extra pretty, after you dip them in the chocolate and it sets, melt white chocolate and drizzle it with a fork on top for a very nice effect.

I made these twice. The first time I followed the recipe exactly. They were good, but the second time I used all of the oreos in the mix and dipped them in white chocolate. They were scrumptious! Could definitely taste the oreo. I melted just a little dark chocolate and made designs on top of the white chocolate. They turned out beautifully.

These are awesome, I made a ton of sweets this holiday season and these were by-far the favorite. I have no suggestions for improvement, they're perfect the way they are. Follow the recipe EXACTLY and you're set.

This was so super easy and got sooooooo many compliments!  This will be a go to recipe to wow a crowd.  I ground up the Oreos whole in the food processor - 10 at a time in a smaller one.  Then mixed with the cream chesse and put in the fridge for awhile.  Then I used a small cookie scoop to make the balls, then dipped in chocolate and put on wax paper to dry.  I just sprinkled the reserved oreos over the top and added some festive red sprinkles.  You cannot taste that these are oreos they just wos!  Sorry that I have to wait a year until the next cookie exchange - this is what I will be taking!

These were pretty good.  I was expecting them to taste more like oreos and cream cheese but it really did not have that flavor exactly but a nice chocolatey flavor.  I attempted to do white chocolate but melted it wrong...i then mixed some milk chocolate and some white chocolate and drizzled with semi sweet.  I used a small melon baller to make the balls and then put them in the fridge. The dipping in melted chocolate was a chore and it probably did not help that I was rushing it.  I used skewers, that was probably the easiest. May try again with peanut butter too.

I used chocolate almond bark instead of semi sweet chcocolate and drizzled some white chocolate almond bark over the dipped oreo balls. For Valentines Day we always use the white almond bark and tint it pink and use for dipping . There are never any left .

A WONDERFUL recipe!!  Someone elsewhere suggested using 1/2 lb melted white chocolate to drizzle over the top for the "oreo" effect.  A big hit this Christmas with my family and friends!!  Definitely a keeper!

I made this recipe based on all the good reviews.  It is soooo good!!!  It is  great with lower fat cream cheese and reduced fat oreos. Also, as noted by another reviewer, I tried it with the peppermint oreos at trader joes which was good if you like the minty flavor.  White chocolate drizzles create  a great presentation.  I will definitely make every year

I'm not a big chocolate fan but my family is and they love this recipe.  If you have OREO lovers in the house - this is a must.  Very easy - my 4 year old helped me roll into balls.  Make sure you refrigerate them before dipping - makes it much easier.

Yum! These are so rich and delicious. I actually received these for a cookie exchange and they were the hit of the day. My 6 year old would eat the whole box if he was allowed to. My husband hates cream cheese, so I tried to trick him into eating one, didn't work. His loss! You can taste the cream cheese, but that's what gives them their richness.

Substituted vanilla almond bark for the chocolate, and removed cream filling to cut down some of the richness - still extraordinairly rich without.  Highly addictive.

I make these every year and they're awesome.  People (my husband especially) always ask for them; I've also added mint flavoring or different flavored oreo's and they're still great.  I drizzle white chocolate over the tops when the other chocolate has set.  This year, I think I will try using nutter butter cookies for something different

These are an instant hit! They are the most requested “Cooke” that I make at Christmas time. Plus, with the flavor variety that Oreo offers, the possibilities are endless. Other than the original, mint is the second best according to friends and family. I also use the thin Oreos because they are easier to crush and the cream cheese flavor really comes through for a more cheesecake taste.

These are ah-mazing!  I tried the 'batter' and thought they weren't so great.... but the finished product was fantastic.

I added a few peppermint Dove squares which gave a great subtle peppermint flavor.  I would totally do this again.

I think next time I would set aside less cookie crumbs as I had more than enough left over.  From 9 i would probably do 6 and thus add more to the mix.

I used Newman's wheat free "oreos" and it turned out well, just not as many "balls" since there are less cookies in the container.  I'm a big fan of this recipe.

This was super easy. My 9 year old did all of it except the dipping in chocolate part, which was even easier using the 2 spoon trick I read here than anything I've had to dip before.  These were delicious and people raved about them.  We will make these for Christmas every year now.

Great recipe.  If you like mint, it’s also great using the mint Oreos.  To make dipping easier, I used cake pop sticks and decorated the outside as the chocolate cooling I decorated them for Xmas.  Would be easy to incorporate all sorts of holiday themes.

Super easy to make.  Great for a last minute dessert idea or for fun with the kids.  I suggest you freeze or refrigerate the balls before you dip them in chocolate, it helps keep their shape when dipping.

I make a mint version for the holidays. I use regular oreos, blend them in the food processor, add about a teaspoon peppermint extract. Then I work in cream cheese with a spoon, then knead by hand to ensure a good mixture. I don't always chill them, but I let them sit in a stainless steel bowl, so I think the chill from the cream cheese remains. I use two bakers chocolate semi-sweet bars and melt in a double boiler with a couple of T of crisco to ensure a smooth texture. I added another 1/2 teaspoon of peppermint extract and topped the dipped balls with crushed candy cane.

So delicious. I used off brand cookies and had 10 less in the package but they still turned out great. I also just used semi sweet chocolate chips for dipping. It takes focus and some patience but the outcome is worth it.

Variations - instead of Oreos, use: 
- 1/2 package crushed graham crackers plus 2 tbsp amaretto, covered in white chocolate
- 1 package crushed keebler pecan sandies plus 3 tbsp rum
- about 30 crushed vanilla wafer cookies plus 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips
- vanilla sandwich cookies, colorful sprinkles
- lemon sandwich cookies, key lime juice, 2 drops green food coloring (covered in white chocolate, rolled in graham cracker crumbs) 
- or add peppermint extract to the Oreos for a mint version

I made these and they were delicious and such a crowd pleaser! I doubled the batch and used 1 double stuf oreo pack and one regular. I froze the batter before making the balls, then froze again before coating in chocolate. Personally I needed probably double the amount of baking chocolate or at least one extra pack per batch but people wanted to buy some off me! super delicious

I decided to mix this up and use the peppermint Oreos. It was a wonderful twist! I will say that I struggled at first because the batter was too soft to effectively dip in the chocolate. So I rolled the truffles into balls and put them in the freezer for about 25 minutes. I used chocolate chips that I melted in the microwave and they worked just as well. The only thing you have to be careful of is, make sure you are generous when dipping the balls or they will just end up frustrating you.???

I’ve made this numerous times, very simple recipe so it’s hard to go wrong. Reading the reviews helped. I made the balls then covered and refrigerated a few hours. I believe  the chilling made it so much easier to coat them with chocolate.

My daughter and I made this for a small gathering. We only made half a recipe which yielded 18 truffles. The flavor was very good and it was easy to make. However, we did not crush the cookies too finely since it was hard to make the truffles with the fine crumbs. We would definitely make it again.

quick recipe.  no baking.   Second time I made them, they were very soft and mushy.  I tried to double the recipe and they were mushy.  Had to add more crushed oreos but had the same out put.

Turned out great! So cute! We used double stuffed cookies and it turned out fine, we also used Neufchâtel cheese instead of cream cheese also turned out fine. You probably don’t want to use milk chocolate, we did that and then the truffles were to sweet. We put them in the fridge before we dipped them. Yummy! Thanks for the recipe!

So easy and so fantastic! I put the truffles in the freezer for 10 minutes before coating with Ghirardelli melting wafers, used a fork to roll them and a spoon  to cover any missed spots, so no problems at all with them falling apart while coating.

I thought that the recipe could have used a little work, because they didn't have the right number of Oreos in a package so there weren't enough Oreos for the top crumble, there wasn't enough white chocolate to cover all the balls and I ended up having to melt over twice the amount. I wish they'd given more specifics too, and it would have been easier to chill the balls before trying to dip. Big mistake! Flavor was good, but too sweet for  my tastes. Overall, definitely not my cup of tea.

These are amazing, but beware that they are not for the novice or impatient!  This was a 2 day project.  Your chocolate can easily harden, and it can be tough to wrap the oreo mixture in the chocolate sauce.  So be patient, and it if you make it to the end, you are likely to leave your guest in a chocolate coma!  We suggest trying to warp the oreo mixture in some other things such as caramel or peppermint bark (which surprisingly 5 different stores had never heard of!).  Those are easier to work with, and make the treats a little less sweet.  I chose to top them with a strawberry puree, which blended fabulously, and also made for a much more beautiful presentation than all black.  It is well worth all the effort.

Easy recipe to make in a pinch!! I recommend getting a "Family Pack" of Oreos (which is still 16oz) because you'll have a few left over. Follow the directions word for word, and you'll be good to go!! I made about 25 total, but I made them bigger than the recommended 1 inch size. This is a new favorite dessert recipe!

This wasn't my favorite. Made exactly as recipe said and took them to a work function and they were not a hit. Not sure if it was the brand of chocolate I used but they weren't good. Way too rich and they get melty and mushy if not in a cold environment.

These are not as easy as they seem.  My advice,  once you have made the truffle balls, put them on wax paper and freeze.  Otherwise they are too mushy to be coated by chocolate and they turn out very lumpy indeed.

I made these twice now and my friend already asked me to make them for her baby shower.  I don’t have a food processor so I blend the Oreo in my Ninja blender then I mix the cream cheese I put it in the fridge for over two hours then I take them out and roll them into balls.  I realized it’s best to put the chocolate in a cup and dip the Oreos in there makes it easier, then I immediately sprinkle the crush Oreos in there.  I’m giving it four stars because the directions could have been better.  I brought lollipops sticks from party city you can get them from Amazon too that way it can be eaten as a cake pop.  I realized the best thing to do is once I roll them into the balls I dip the lollipops stick into the chocolate and stick the stick on the Oreos then I put it back in fridge to get harder.  It seem it’s a longer process but it’s worth it if you want to do the stick, if you doing them for a party you can do them the day before.

I didn't have the bakers chocolate so I used a 12 oz. package of Nestles semi-sweet chocolate chips and they turned out fine.  I used a fork to roll the balls around in the chocolate and it worked perfectly.

As for the taste---my children loved them and I thought they were good, but not life changing.

These were really good, but make sure you don’t use unsweetened chocolate. I did that by mistake and it was very bitter, as would be expected.

I made the truffles with milk chocolate almond bark and it work the same. Exempt you have to use 10oz to cover all of the truffles. I also added the creme frkm the inside of the oreos after I mixed the  cream cheese and oreos together.

Very good, I made it with red velvet Oreos which only had 25 cookies, so I reduced the cream cheese by 2 ounces and mixed in a quarter cup of mini chocolate chips and they were delicious! For the topping I mixed cocoa powder and powdered sugar and they were gone in a few minutes.

I have made these before but with this recipe reserving 9 cookies seemed to throw off the ratio compared to cream cheese because they came out too mushy even after refrigerating.

Excellent recipe, easy to make. Had to chill the dough before rolling the balls then again before I did the chocolate  coating. It was a hit at Christmas.

These are great! The only issue is that they did not make the serving amount shown. We made pretty regular sized balls (22g each) and only ended up with about 26 servings. I will make them smaller next time, (20g?) but not too much smaller. They were just barely too big for the little paper truffle cups. (The chocolate coating adds to the size of the balls more than I thought it would.) Also (note to self) white chocolate seemed more difficult to work with than regular chocolate. I used Tollhouse white chips. Maybe add a little oil? I did freeze them after the balls were formed. It took quite a while to get them all coated. (I tripled the recipe and it was 4 hours start to finish.) I used an icing bag with a tip to drizzle the white chocolate onto the dark and vice versa. Overall it was a lot of fun, and pretty easy. It would be fun to experiment with different types of candies/cookies. Thanks! :)

I followed the recipe exactly. This was my first time making. i put Oreo mixture in fridge for about 20 minutes, then made balls. I put balls in freezer for 15 minutes. This made way easier when rolling omg chocolate. I used others idea, of using 2 forks to roll in chocolate. Topped with Oreo crumbs, sprinkles. Yum!!

I made these the first time according to the recipe and they were very good. The next time I made them I changed a couple things. 1. I used double stuf Oreos, 2. I used milk chocolate for dipping. After I roll them into balls I freeze them for at least half an hour which makes them easier to dip. Also, I like to make a bunch and freeze and put in a resealable plastic bag until I need them. Yummy!

So easy.  After reading reviews, I used nutter butter cookies and put the entire bag in a processor to pulverize.  I then added the room temp cream cheese and blended with the cookies in the processor.  meanwhile, I microwaved the chocolate in a plastic bowl and used a small spoon and fork to drop the small peanut balls in to the chocolate.  They stayed firm and I had no issues with them falling apart.  I put them on a wax paper covered cookie sheet after dipping them into the chocolate.  I also bought caramel peanuts and crushed them and sprinkled them on top of the finished balls before I put in the fridge.  They look great, they taste great and they were super easy.

These are everyone's favorite year after year.  To make the process of dipping of the balls into melted chocolate as easy and clean as possible, I freeze them overnight.  Before the melted chocolate hardens, I put sprinkles on them for a more festive look.

I made these for a baby shower and everyone loved them! However, they were not the prettiest. I refrigerated the ball before dipping them in chocolate but it was difficult to drain the excess chocolate. If anyone has a good tip to improve the presentation of these, I would give the recipe 5 stars.

I made this expecting to make 100 truffles and like the reviews said it fell apart. So I threw the ingredients in the freezer for like a month, and when I took it out and let it thaw it was nice and creamy smooth so I used it as a cupcake frosting. Absolutely raving reviews, everyone asks how I got the Oreos blended in so well.

These are a holiday favorite around my house! I recommend using double stuff Oreos (these have never fallen apart for me), and making a batch using white chocolate bark, which is my favorite, and another with semi-sweet chocolate bark, which seems to be a hit with the kids.  For anyone who does not have a food processor, I made these in my mixer for years, using the paddle attachment, and that worked well.  Also, I've found that using two spoons helps when dipping the balls into the chocolate, so that you can completely cover them as you gently roll and scoop them through the chocolate. Add sprinkles for a fun and fancy garnish and people will believe you spent hours making them!

I didn't get a chance to try one as they disappeared so quickly!!
advise I would give is to chill down the mixture in the fridge first, then roll into balls, then place into the freezer to harden as this makes them much easier to dip into the chocolate.
I used the peanut butter oreos. 
Hope I can actually try one next time!.

Easy peasey excellent recipe! The only thing I did different, was using Minee fruit flavored sandwich cookies. I made half the recipe since the cookies are smaller than Oreo's. Just a hint of fruit when eaten. Glad I read lots of reviews. Added butter to the chocolate to melt it better. Will try other cookies when my 13 year old grand daughter comes to visit in June. Or sooner!

these were incredibly easy to make and delicious. if you don't like chocolate they're definitely not for you though. i'm thinking ab using maybe a white chocolate coating instead next time or maybe use peanut butter cookies instead of oreos

These were amazing and easy to make I melted the chocolate by putting a pot full of boiling water and a Pyrex bowl over top of it and stirring the chocolate occasionally until it was melted. You should definitely make this recipe!

A crowd pleaser! I have made them exactly as the recipe dictates and have also made them with mint Oreos. Both are delicious but the mint Oreos were my favorite! I dip mine in Dove dark chocolate.

This was extremely easy to make and turned out fantastically. Friend's kids were begging for seconds. Made a couple small adjustments: added a little over a teaspoon of Bailey's and added 1/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder to the Oreo mixture. This is a recipe that can be easily altered but just be careful about adding to much liquids to the instructed Oreo mix. If too wet, it will be hard to form the ball shape.

This recipe did not turn out  well, the oreo cream cheese mixture was too crumbly no matter how much cream cheese i added. When I went to dip it, it all fell apart so I just ended up pouring the chocolate on. I had added grahm crumbs sto try and make it stick together so they ended up being crunchy ish.

Made these for a crowd. They are delicious!! Easy to make. I put all the cookies in the blender and then stirred in the cream cheese by hand until it was all an even consistency. I used white chocolate for another batch of them and then drizzled some of the opposite flavor chocolate over them for a professional look. Best served chilled.

Absolutely delicious.  Even with no additional topping but the crushed oreos. Tip (if you overheat the chocolate): add pats of butter until consistency thins.

These are delicious.  I mixed them up and then froze them in a single layer on a cookie sheet.  I then put them on a ziplock bag to dip later.  I used a different chocolate dip (chocolate chips and a tablespoon of shortening) and dipped them while frozen.  I read not to do that, but they turned out perfect.  I could see that if they sit out long they may get very soft, but I served them from the refrigerator and they were loved by all.

I can only find packages of 27 oreos these days, a 300 gram package.  Downsizing?  I would edit this recipe to read 45  original oreo cookies, without a package size.  I would also state the number of squares of chocolate, as many manufacturers are downsizing their baker's chocolate packages.  Otherwise this is a fantastic recipe that has never failed.

These Oreo Truffles are amazingly easy to make, I started making them at Christmas about 7 years ago, and most people love them. Some DO say they are to sweet, so I made a few changes. First, I never tried making them with double stuff Oreos, I would think they wouldn't stay together.
 I use a regular size package of Oreos, 1 package of cream cheese, and I don't dip them in melted chocolate. I mix the Oreos & cream cheese in my food processor, then place the "dough" in the fridge overnight. I make the Oreo ball the next day, then roll them in powdered sugar, colored sprinkles, finely chopped coconut, and chopped nuts. Some people like the nuts, others like powdered sugar, this way everyone gets the one they like!  This Christmas I'm going to try wrapping some of them in marzipan, and some in vanilla sugar.  
 ( Vanilla sugar is two cups of sugar with the inside of two Madagascan vanilla beans, placed in a lidded jar, and shaken, then stored someplace cool & dry for a week, or longer)

This  was really good and filling , but i do recommend refrigerating the little oreo balls before putting chocolate on them or else they`ll just fall apart. Other than that i do recommend making these, especially for christmas!! :)

They were very tasty but lost the round shape when it came to rolling in the chocolate. My chocolate did not get the fondue consistency for whatever reason. I will make these again because it's just fatty goodness and great with red wine.

These are AMAZING - and simple to do. A friend brought them to work once a few years ago and I fell in love, I've been making them for parties ever since and everyone always raves about them.

I loved these, but just a tip mix the oreos and cream cheese with your hands. It is so much easier than using utensils.

I absolutely love this recipe. It is the best non baking dessert I have ever made. They are super easy and fun to make. Instead of using semi sweet or milk chocolate, I used two packages of white chocolate and they turned out even better!

Great Recipe! However, I found that it does not make as many servings as it claims. Delicious, but very sweet, so it is not necessary to entirely cover the truffles.

The cream cheese and Oreo part were very easy. Just simple mixing and crushing. The chocolate on the other hand was a disaster. You deffinalely need a double boiler to make the chocolate or it'll burn. You can do it in the microwave or it'll burn. I ruined two rubber wear and a pot making the chocolate. I'm not the best baker but I know my chocolate and this chocolate was terrible to work with.

Turned out very well.  I made three batches- one with regular Oreos, one with Lemon Oreos and white almond bark topped with lemon zest, and one with Nutter Butters.  All three turned out great!  Easy to decorate with drizzled white chocolate or edible glitter.  After adding cream cheese I placed mixture in fridge to firm up and then I placed the balls in the fridge after shaping before dipping in chocolate also.  Will definitely be making again.

These are straight-up delicious. I put the Oreos in the food processor, then transferred the crushed cookies to a bowl and used a fork to mix in the cream cheese. I used a small cookie scoop to scoop small balls of dough onto a parchment lined cookie sheet. I just drizzled the melted chocolate on top - I skipped crushing the extra cookies for a topping and used sprinkles. Refrigerated for about 15 minutes. Done! As a side note, I noticed Oreos now has a lemon flavor and I think that would be delicious with a white chocolate drizzle and some lemon zest.

I have made these several times in the last month by request of family members. These are amazing, rich, and delicious - even my family members who dislike sweets like these decadent truffles.
A few tips that I've learned:
-Refrigerate the dough for about 30 minutes before dipping in chocolate. This helps the chocolate harden quickly onto the ball and helps the balls retain their round shape.
-Use a tablespoon to scoop out the same size balls each time.
-Only serve these directly out of the fridge, otherwise they get way too soft (although still delicious)

OMG, these are SO good!  I had trouble covering them in the chocolate too. I tried a fork, a slotted spoon, then two spoons but ended up having hubby help me by holding a spoon with chocolate in it then I put a ball in and rolled it around to cover, sometimes pouring some on top. Definitely time consuming but oh, so good!

These tasted ok but aren't worth the trouble. Dipping them in chocolate and getting them to look pretty is impossible. And after they sit out for a while, they get mushy and greasy and gross.

Great recipe. These got waxed on Christmas Day! The only thing I would say is freeze them after shaping them, they got a bit soft after shaping and rolling them in the chocolate got... well a tad messy. I also dipped one half of the batch in Green and Blacks almond milk chocolate to give it them a nutty texture... Was delish!

The only thing I did different was split the Baker's chocolate to 50/50, Semi-Sweet/White, as this was all I had on-hand.  These turned out perfect and were so easy to make, though I need to practice dipping a bit more.  Highly recommend these as a sure crowd-pleaser.

Just made the recipe as a test run before new years.. an we will definitely make them again.
Easy to make and very delicious.... they are on the "heavier" side, meaning very filling.... I will test some more with walnuts and almonds just to give them that little crunch.. but these are very good... I imagine 3 of these and you are all set for the night, and that might be pushing it.
We made them with vanila, chocolate and strawberry orios, nice simple variety.

They turned out amazing and were a big hit at our Christmas party! I did use peppermint Oreos (seasonal) to get into the Christmas spirit, they were really flavorful.

After reading these helpful reviews, I went one step further and put the Oreo balls in the freezer. That seemed to make them  easy to handle.
These are super easy, very pretty, and people seem to love them!

I had a batch of homemade Almond Butter cookies that were a couple days old and I thought...why not make Truffles for my Christmas Cookie Gift Tins?  Perfect!  Followed this recipe, using cream cheese and Almond Butter to make the frosting mixture.  Dipped in the chocolate - definitely add a little Cisco -and for finishing touches, a zip lock with a cutoff corner filled some melted white chocolate to quickly drizzle some prettiness over the top, a few red, white and green sprinkles and they looked and tasted like a million bucks!  Chilling of the filling before AND after rolling is the key to easy success!  Fantastic recipe, and the possibilities are endless!

I used Oreo Double Stuff and after mixing them cream cheese and forming the balls, I put them in the freezer for about 30 minutes. I used milk chocolate chips and dipped each ball using a toothpick. They turned out delicious and everyone loved them!

Excellent and easy to make.  I make them using Ghirardelli white chocolate as the coating.  I think they look nice with the color contrast and they aren't as sweet.  I also refrigerate them for awhile before I dip them as this makes the chocolate coating firm up faster.  People are always impressed and think they are labor intensive.  SHHH... they don't need to know the truth.

My husband loved this! I made it with a few changes based on concern that the cream cheese would taste odd in combination with the Oreo mixture. 
So, I used double stuffed Oreo. I put 5 rows of cookies in the processor and put aside 1/2 cup of the crumbles for garnish later. Then added 1/2 to 3/4 cup of cream cheese and about 1/4 cup of (pre-made) cream cheese frosting.  It's not exact, I was looking for the consistency of wet sand when I squished the mixture in my hand, but not too wet/sticky. I squished/formed it into dense balls, no rolling. Chilled in the freezer.  The chocolate used to coat made a difference. I started with chocolate bark I needed to use up and ended with a more expensive (Ghirardelli) brand of chocolate. The bark made a rough looking truffle but didn't melt when it touched my hand. The G chocolate made gorgeous, smooth truffles but melted more quickly. The end product was an Oreo truffle that tasted more Oreo than cream cheese but had a little bite to it. My hubs said it's the way Oreos should be. :) I hope this helps those who said it tasted weird like Oreo and sour cream....

You need to refrigerate the dough a little first BEFORE you roll them into balls; then, freeze them BEFORE dipping them in chocolate. Otherwise, you will get a gooey mess as some have described. Also, making these with semi-sweet chocolate is not good. They are way too rich! I think white chocolate works best, but that is my opinion.

Takes a very long time to make, and they have to chill, so I recommend making them the day/night before. Overall this is my favorite recipe on this website!!! It's amazing you can't just have one. Whenever I bring these to a party everyone LOVES them and asks me for the recipe.

Everyone loves this recipe! The only adjustments I've made is white chocolate for the coating.  This year we are going to try some variations with the different flavors of oreo that are available one being Lemon. I plan on adding a bit of lemon zest and lemon flavoring to both the filling and white chocolate coating. We will also try using the holiday peppermint flavored oreo, I think that one would work with any chocolate coating and add a dusting of crushed peppermint candies.

This is a great recipe the truffles set in about 2 hours and are delicious the bakers chocolate tastes really good on the truffles and if you put the hot bakers chocolate on top and then cool it immediately it will set much quicker!

These are so easy to make and came out absolutely delicious! My 7 year old practically made these himself. The trick is to make sure you freeze them for at least na hour before coating them with chocolate. I kept half in the freezer while I worked on the other half. We melted milk chocolate chips inthe microwave, in 30 second spurts, with 2 tablespoons of coconut oil. The chocolate was the perfect consistency. We used a chopstick to dip them, let the chocolate run off, then dusted them with different things: salt, dark chocolate, cinnamon. I don't even like oreos, but these are SO GOOD! I'm just hoping we have some left when our guests arrive!!! Oh, and like another reviewer said, they need to stay refrigerated until ready to serve.

I've made these many times in the last 3 years and they are always a huge hit!  Every time I make them for a party people think I'm some kind of baking genius (and I'm no where close). After I mix the softened cream cheese and Oreos I set them in the fridge for about 30 minutes to cool them down (makes less crumbly balls). I use the entire Oreo bag and don't sprinkle crumbs on the top because I'm too lazy. I usually use about 4-6 packets of baking chocolate to get full coverage.  I also melt 2 packets at a time in different bowls to prevent burnt chocolate.   Yum!

I don't bother with the reserved crushed cookies for topping any more, & just used the whole thing for the truffles.  It doesn't need it & you get a couple more truffles.

Tough time rating this one, as personally I did not like them that much.  But, they were easy to make and got rave reviews, selling out quickly at a bake sale.  My original intent was to put them on sticks (a la cakeballs) but they kept slipping off, so I just stuck with the ball form.  I refrigerated them for a good 24 hours before a 3 hour bake sale, and they held up well.

I've been making these in the same way for the last 10 or so years, way before I ever saw this recipe, but this is how I do them, too! My dif is I used white chocolate (still the baking kind) to dip it in. It is a giant hit at parties and talk about guilty pleasures, haha. After loving these bad boys, I developed some food allergies/sensitivities so I now use gluten-free "oreos" (I prefer kinnikinnick's "KinniToos Chocolate Vanilla Sandwich Creme Cookies") plus non-dairy creme cheese (I like Tofutti's) and a non-dairy white chocolate (I like Oppenheimer's Vegan White Chocolate Chips). All directions are the same and you will not regret it whether you follow my tips or the wonderful author's great recipe. Thank you for posting this wonderful treat for all!

These turned out amazing! Although I didn't need that many grounded Oreos for sprinkling on top of the truffles. I would recommend 4-6 oreos for sprinkling :)

I wouldn't  call this "easy".  The only easy part about it was using 3 ingredients.  The Oreos were easy to chop and mix with the cream cheese, but you have to get your hands dirty and dig in.  Rolling the balls was time-consuming, but not as sticky as I expected.  The hardest part was dipping them in chocolate.  Pieces of Oreo were falling off into the chocolate dip so it wasn't coating well, and forget about trying to roll them in the leftover Oreo crumbs afterwardsThey still tasted good though.  Very rich.

Very easy and delicious. I used the suggestion in the comments to let the balls chill before dipping them. I ended up figuring out my own way to dip the balls into the chocolate. You will find that while dipping them you figure out which way works best for you.

Typically I am not a fan of cream cheese outside of a bagel, however this is the exception! Absolutely delicious with rave reviews from everyone that had one. I was a little concerned with it being left out of the fridge too long but these were gone within minutes. These are my new go-to for cookies!

Great Recipe! Instead of Chocolate, I put almond bark with chocolate flavored coating. Gave it a crunch for sure! Not a big fan of cream cheese, I've got to say, but one person couldn't stop eating it!!!

This is really good!  At the end instead of putting oreo crumbs I put a few grains of coarse salt before the chocolate got hard.  Soooo good: salty/sweet! :)

Simple, quick, delicious. I like anything chocolate but these Oreo truffles are officially at the top of my list. I chilled the Oreo balls before I smothered them in melted chocolate in order to help keep the balls from falling apart. Ill defiantly be making these again.

Omg! This easy to do recipe makes me feel like a natural born baker..lmao
Soo good!! Big hit!! 
I read other reviews and found it a little odd that some had issues with the balls falling apart in the chocolate. That did not happen with me but i did roll and squick and re-roll the balls to make sure they were tight!!
I actually just put the oreos in a bag and beat the hell out of it lol
then "played" with it in a bowl with the cream cheese. I kept at it until it was a black blob! So I reeeally got in there!
Then shaped them and my sister melted chocolate for me. I used two spoons to coat and I just rolled it off the spoon..
They are sooo good but tasted more like oreo when it was left in the fridge for a few more hours. I could only eat a few they are sooo rich but gosh so good!
Very glad I came across this and will keep making for a very long time!!
Happy eating everyone!

Love these!! I used semi-sweet chocolate chips for the coating and it was perfect. So easy to make but a little time consuming when it comes to dipping them. Will def make again... Perfect to bring to parties.

I LOVE these normally but saw this recipe on here & decided to follow it exactly since it got so many good reviews. Semi-sweet chocolate? Really?  So disgusting. I will definitely stick to milk chocolate or white chocolate next time. Semi-sweet is way too strong for me.

These little things are the best. They look and taste so sophisticated, your friends won't believe when (if) you tell them it's only three ingredients. As some of the others have said, I refrigerate the balls before coating them in chocolate.  If the chocolate is clumpy, warm just a tad longer until it is smooth when mixed. It will make for easier coating and prettier truffles. The one downside to this recipe is that it usually takes me a couple hours to get all the balls rolled and coated. Maybe I'm just slow.

Everyone always begs me to make this again. Tip: A good way to crush Oreos is to put it into TWO (in case it breaks) plastic bags and slam it against the countertop. You can also lightly tap a hammer o it, just make sure you do that on a cutting board still in the two plastic bags. You can also make these into pops by putting toothpicks or popsicle sticks into them. If you do popsicle sticks, though, make them a bit bigger.

Everyone always loves them. I have had some say they can be too sweet, but it's more personal preference. Some people like sweets, some prefer salty or savory. I switch the full flavor cream cheese for 1/3 fat or fat free. Sometimes I do a mix. Freeze them for a few hours before you coat them in chocolate. I usually grab a few at a time out of the freezer, dip, then grab some more. You don't want them to fall apart in the chocolate. Wax paper is your best friend while making these. After I dip them, I put them into the frig to completely cool. You can even make them like cake pops by dipping sticks into the chocolate and insert into the ball before refrigeration.

I love this recipe and it is a huge hit everywhere I take them! Instead of dipping them in chocolate, I pour the chocolate over them. It still covers well and has extra chocolate around the bottom. And my kids are able to help doing this way. 
I do chill for longer than an hour just to make sure they are good and hard and then chill again for over an hour. I do store them in the fridge instead of out just to make sure they stay together.

I only gave this 4 stars because I added a few things. First I used Mint Oreos and added 1/4 cup powder sugar and 1/2 tsp vanilla. It's a little messy making the balls. I refridgerated them for about 1 hour before dipping them in melted Andes Candies (mints). My family loved them!

I really liked these truffles, (and so did the girls from my softball team) the recipe made a lot too. I didn't have baking chocolate so I tried using chocolate chips, they didn't melt very well and we had trouble coating the truffles but we managed to get a clean end result.  To thin the chocolate we Added CRISCO shortening (as needed)and that helped to thin it a little. It also took ALOT of oreos... Great end result though. :D

I made these for Thanksgiving last year - but used Sugar Free Oreo cookies and sugar free baking chocolate to melt.  They were AMAZING and I was able to serve them to my Diabetic guests!

Had these at a pot luck we threw for my father's 64th birthday. They were phenomenal! I had to try them at home, and they were just as easy to make as they sound. Definitely use a food processor for all the mixing to get them super smooth (just like an expensive gourmet truffle) and chill the mixture before forming the balls, as the processor will warm it up a bit.

I saw one person commented that these can't sit out at room temperature and became "really gross" after 5 minutes on the counter. Not sure what happened with their batch. The ones at the potluck sat outside on an 80 degree day for half an hour and were fine. Though, I would definitely store them in the fridge when not eating them because of the cream cheese.

I also made a variation to this recipe. I used golden oreo's and added about 1/4 tsp of orange extract  to the recipe, it turned out really good.

This is super quick to make if you crush the Oreos in a food processor, blend using a pastry mixer, and use a small scoop to form the balls. I whip this up all the time!

Every time I make these, they barely make it to the table before they are devoured. When I am looking to mix it up when making these truffles, I'll substitute the peanut butter filled Oreos.

Super easy and delicious. I put the balls in the freezer for about 10 minutes before dipping them in chocolate. I used a slotted spoon to dip them. Wonderful recipe!

After making these for the holidays, they've become the most-requested dessert for all of my family get-togethers! I like to switch up the flavors, peanut butter Oreos worked great!! It helps to chill the balls before dipping them in the chocolate. Also, 3-4 Oreos reserved for the topping is plenty. So don't waste 9!

my sister made these last Christmas and they were incredible, so I thought I'd try them for a 4th of July party. Mine were a little bigger (probably 1.25" to her .75"), but the chocolate coating totally didn't work for me - too soft! Even after being in the fridge, they were still pretty soft. I did half with white candy melts instead, and though they hardened better, they were thicker and gloppier, no way to win! I wouldn't make them again, despite how delicious they are.

Great simple recipe. Don't thaw cream cheese much. Use REAL chocolate. Freeze the mix for about 30 minutes before turning into balls. Might have to refreeze again half way through making the balls. Also, this recipe freezes really well. You can just make some ahead of time and have them on hand in the freezer.

This was really, really easy and good! Perfect for an amateur cook like myself. I made some for Mothers' Day this Sunday and I brought the leftovers to school, where they were gone by noon. One friend even didn't believe that I made them, which was like an insult rolled into a compliment haha. Well, anyway I would definitely make these again! The chocolate didn't melt properly, but that's a small kink to be worked out. Thanks OP!

I love making these for my students and colleagues! I make 150+ each time I make them and they are gone in 10 minutes! I personally love to add mint or peanut butter. Mint/white chocolate = Heaven!

Super easy, but they definitely take time!

This one is good!  Kept the pre-dipped balls in the freezer for a few hours before coating with chocolate.  The costs vs. output is a bit disappointing which is why the four stars.

Much easier than it looks!  I would recommend white chocolate for the dip as it is much easier to melt and spread than regular chocolate.  Tastes better, too, in my opinion.  I used lollipop sticks in each to make the dipping process easier.  Took another reviewer's advice and only used regular Oreos (i.e., no double-stuff).  I made mine a bit larger, and only came out with around 30.  Don't think I'd want them much smaller.  Definitely a crowd-pleaser!

I've been making these for years... Use double stuff Oreos!   Tip stick balls in freezer for a few mins before dipping in chocolate (helps them from falling apart) .  These are always a huge hit.  I don't particularly try making mine extra neat I think they are more fun messy and lumpy and more flavorful.  I've experimented with different chocolate and different Oreo fillings!

My boyfriend LOVED them. It was really hard to make small I was able to make about 15 of them semi big. For sure making this again but maybe next time will use a mold.

These are great. They're my husband's favorite dessert!  Don't leave them out of the refrigerator for too long.

this recipe is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G it didn't make the complete 42 truffles (it made about 23) but they made up for the laque from the rich chocolaty tast! they tasted like little balls of oreo cheesecake, sooooooo goooood.
i brought these to school and shared with my fiends and they all loved them! (so did my teachers). so many people have bin asking for the recipe to!
i strongly recommend these amazing treats for any occasion.

I used white almond bark and it was great it is a good change they are always a hit. None are left after a party. This is a great substitute for the chocolate chips. You will not be disapointed. You should try this recipes because I know you will love it! :)

Oh. My. God. These are ridiculously good. So rich, so delicious, and so easy to make (apart from dipping the balls in chocolate). I never really got the hang of dipping the balls in the chocolate. I tried the fork/teaspoon and 2 teaspoon methods some reviewers described, and most of my truffles looked nothing like the beautiful photos attached to this recipe. Doesn't matter - they tasted so good that no one cared that they weren't exactly beautiful to look at.

This is the most requested item I have ever taken anywhere.  Be forewarned...once you make them, you'll never stop.  I have also made them with Nutter Butter Cookies for a peanut butter flavored filling.

I thought these tasted great! My mom (who does not really like Oreos), did not, however, like this. 

So if you like Oreos, you will love this dish, if you do not, skip it! 

Oh, and I tried to use candy melts vs. the original baking chocolate, and the candy melts tasted much better. :-)

Whoa - these are legit.  Made them for Valentine's Day for my Oreo-loving husband.  Tasted pro!  I did leave them in the fridge for a while before I coated them with chocolate, to make them easier to douse.  YUM.

I don't know why but 36 cookies wasn't enough to make the dough firm.  It was runny and very soft. No matter how long I kept it in the freezer, it didn't keep its form.  I ended up adding 12 more cookies and then it was perfect! Everyone loved it!! What a great recipe!

These things were so good, after 5 minutes after I made them, they were gone!! Not even a crumb left, and fingers licking the bowl. These are the best OREO balls I have ever tasted! Thanks for the great recipe Tab! =)

Watch out, you'll be addicted!! I made the mistake of trying my first one room temp and it was very sweet. The key is to refrigerate them and keep them at way. I kept them in my fridge for about 2 weeks and had 1 a day :) I'm so sad I ran out!! And as another review said, it's easier to cool the truffle mix before trying to dip it.

Really easy and a big hit. I froze my truffles before dipping them in chocolate and did not have any trouble. I did try white chocolate and it was a disaster, it is very difficult to work with and I ended up ruining a whole box of white chocolate.

Pretty good.  I wouldn't say that they're easy necessarily - dipping in the chocolate was kind of a pain.  Might have been better to dilute the chocolate with a bit of Crisco.  And they tasted good, but they weren't the best thing I've ever had.

We were looking for some new ideas for the holidays and this looked easy. It is!! Everyone loved them and my wife took them to work where they were devoured! While making our first batch my wife put a few drops of orange extract in. Very yummy. Next batches we made we used different flavors of Oreos (strawberry, mint, and peanutbutter). Even dipped the strawberry ones in white chocolate! The peanutbutter ones we did add a big spoonful of peanutbutter. They were all yummy!!!

You have to try it with the mint Oreos!  I crushed them in my food processor, added the cream cheese, and then froze it until the mixer was firm but still pliable.  It's also best to dip them in chocolate after they have been thoroughly chilled. Did I mention using the mint Oreos?! Yum!!

You can't get any easier than this!  Very rich and highly addictive.  I drizzled in white chocolate rather than dipping them.  Keep them refrigerated till ready to serve.

Delicious! I used a generic brand of oreos and ther were not enough in the package. i didn't need 9 oreos for topping though. Next time I will only leave maybe 3 for that. I would rather do a chocolate drizzle anyway. I recommend using a few less oreos in the main mix, that way there is more cream cheese that keeps the balls together.

These are yummy, and very easy. The recommended 9 cookies for crumbs was way more than we needed - probably could have used half or a third of that and had plenty of crumbs to sprinkle. My 9 and 6 year old children had a wonderful time rolling the balls and dropping them into the chocolate to be coated. It was lovely to have a recipe they could help with and actually truly be helpful and save time, and they loved it.

I made these and brought them to work for Christmas treats. Everyone loved them! I used a rolling pin since I didn't have a food processor. It took a while longer and there were larger pieces of Oreo because of this but they still turned out great. I think I may have coated them with too much of the chocolate because I did not have enough of the melted chocolate to cover all of them. I would suggest using a bit more if you like them really covered!

So easy and soooo delicious!! The trickiest part was to dip the balls successfully in and out of the chocolate. I used the 2-spoon trick. I used chocolate almond bark for the chocolate which is easier to work with.

This recipe is easy to do, and doesn't take much time. I do agree with everyone who says to chill them before you dip them into the chocolate though. I also found that I never got the 42 yield, only about 36 (and they were 1 inch) I'm not sure what happened there. I used regular oreos for the center and mint oreos for the topping. Yum.

Super easy, especially since I used a food processor! I read the recipe wrong and instead of sprinkling the cookie crumbs over the chocolate, I rolled them in it...turned out great anyways and I'm not sure I would choose to do it any other way!!I just went from rolling them/spooning chocolate over the ball to transferring them to a bowl of crushed crumbs and rolling them in there, then carefully taking them out with a fork. Very easy process with no chocolate dripping.

These are fantastic! However, this recipe does not make 3 and a half dozen. For me it usually makes about 30 but it definitely varies. my advice, make extra if you are planning on a certain number (for gifts for example) and eat the excess!

These came out wonderfully. Chilling the OREO balls before dipping is a must and make sure to keep them very cool while serving. Enjoy!

I have used this recipe for a fundraiser for our preschool and am now getting 50+ orders a year for these delicious and super easy truffles.  I put my own twist on them by adding marachino cherries and different flavorings or dip them in white chocolate instead.  You can't go wrong!

i made this for thanksgiving, and they were an absolute hit!!! everyone loved them, but it is a little tricky trying to coat them in chocolate... make sure when u make them, the chocolate u get to melt, will actually melt well. mine almost started a fire in the microwave when i made it, but im sure theres a much better way to melt the chocolate. other than then it was awesome. next time i make them i will be sure to find a more simple way to melt the chocolate, other than that the recipie is absolutly amazing. i am totally gonna make them for future family and friend gatherings!!!

Oh my gosh these were good. My husband always makes homemade peanut butter balls every year and I wanted to add something new with it. My brother and his wife came down Christmas night (we always put out a lot of treats for company stopping by) and they actually argued about which "truffle" they preferred. She liked these and he liked my husbands'. Traitor. :-)

so easy and so delish.  I made these for my husbands 30th bday bbq and everyone loved them!
They fell apart when I was dipping them in chocolate but I stuck them in the freezer for 30 min and they worked perfect.  Such as easy and wonderful dessert

These truffles are awesome! Three ingredients and they wow everyone who eats them.  I made them for friends and they were amazed when I told them how simple the recipe was.  They look great too.  For a little added bonus, I added a little amaretto to the oreo/cream cheese filling.

Love, love, love! These are soo good. I use white almond bark in place of the chocolate. Even better using candy cane oreos at Christmastime with a sprinkle of crushed candy cane on top.

Oh how I love these. So sinfully delicious. I end up eating so many, they're just so good! And I wouldn't reccommend using lowfat cream cheese- but reduced fat oreos work fine.

Deeeelish! These were so great and I got rave reviews when I made them! I dipped them in Baker's milk chocolate dipping cups and it worked great. I then chilled them in the fridge until firm then drizzled white chocolate over them, then chilled again until ready to serve. I set aside the 9 oreos like the recipe called for, but didn't use them, the white chocolate drizzle was a lot prettier. These are super good, but very rich so don't forget the milk!

These were fun to make! Made me feel like a little kid again as I had chocolate all over the place.  They turned out delicious and I can't wait to share them with my co-workers tomorrow at our Secret Santa reveal party.  Hubby and my son wanted to eat them all and I had to force them out of the kitchen.

Just made these; please be aware there are some pkgs of cookies out there that are not 16 oz.  I used Gharadelli chocolate to dip some in and also some white chocolate chips.  I did not roll mine in cookie crumbs.  I used some Christmas sprinkles for mine.  Also drizzled chocolate on white ones, and vice versa.

So good and very addicting! very easy recipe - especially crushing the cookies in the food processor. I also found using my hands to blend the crumbs and the cream cheese the easiest. I put my mixture in the fridge for at least an hour and had no problem rolling them in the chocolate. Used red sugar sprinkles for topping and liked it.

These are a favorite at our house! I just have one tip... when taking the ball out of the chocolate, use a fork to lift the ball and gently tap the fork on the side of the ball to get rid of the excess chocolate. It works great every time! :)

These are so yummy! Everyone I have made them for loves them. Try them with the other flavors of oreos. The favorite in our house is the Golden Oreos dipped in white chocolate.

Everyone loves these delicious Truffles.  I used double and even triple stuffed oreos and just recently the half white and dark oreos.  I put the oreos in a steel bowl and use a mojito stick to mash the oreos. Using white chocolate on the outer seems to be the way to go.  Seems like most people enjoy the contrast.

Fella from work brought some in that his wife made, so it was the new addition to our Holiday sweets last year. We used the double stuff for the filling and reg. Oreos for rolling. Now it takes more double stuff to make the batch up, but it who doesn't love more filling? That and we rolled some in mint chocolate. Talk about YUM, they were the first to be gone in all three of our houses. (My Sister and Best Friend got together.)

Simple and easy to love.

Made these for a Thanksgiving treat and they were a huge hit! I mixed the cookie crumbs and cream cheese with an electric mixer until it looked like chocolate fudge and then put it in the fridge for over an hour. They rolled very easily and held together great through the chocolate dipping.

These taste amazing! I followed some of the other users guidelines and used 2 spoons to dip the balls. It was a little more time consuming than I had anticipated but I thought they were great! Unfortunately, many of my family members thought they were too rich. I will definitely make these again though.

These are pretty tasty! Not too much work either, got mine ready last minute in a little more than a half hour. Froze them in batches as I kept working on the others. I personally think I'll try a different coating next time just for a change.

These are so easy and so yummy! I followed the recipe exactly but found the outside coating a little to powerful (and hard to do!) So, the only thing I did differently to this great recipe was change the outside coating of chocolate. Instead of dunking them in, I drizzled white chocolate and then topped with the Oreo crumbs. I get asked to make these on a weekly basis!

Very very tasty, but they are better if you use chocolate almond bark instead of semi-sweet chocolate.

Great, easy recipe!!! I have made it several times. Some tips are: not just mix but mush oreos and cream cheese for a smooth interior. mix for a more crunchy touch. When melting chocolate make sure to melt a little at a time, too much will make it solidify and unable to be melted again. White chocolate will make it prettier and then design with a darker chocolate.

I don't know where I got this recipe from, maybe here.  3 ingredients and people love and request them all the time.  I make truffles from scratch using the best ingredients, yet this are my most requested.  Easy and wonderful!

Fabuloso!! A friend at work gave us these for a gift and I had to have the recipe! I've made them numerous times & they are so easy! Definately agree that it's better to chill the balls before dipping. I also use the dipping chocolate found in the baking isle. It's called chocolate bark & you just melt on the stove top but have to keep an eye on it!!

I loved this recipe because it was so easy...and especially since it was NO-BAKE!  (I'm a terrible baker).  I think these are a cute, festive treat to make for any occasion.  I made mine with rainbow sprinkles since I was giving them to someone on their birthday I thought it would be pretty!  I tried to do white chocolate coating but white chocolate is harder to melt than regular chocolate so I screwed it up.  So easy!

Everyone else seemed to love these but I myself wasn't a huge fan.  They have to be served directly from the fridge because they are really gross if they get warm IMO.

These are delicious.  Add a little pectin to the chocolate and it won't melt when you hold it.
Works great.

whomever added this recipe..thank you.  I can't even keep these on the table, I had people actually hiding them from others..lol.  Would recommend the balls smaller than what it calls for, because they are soooo rich.  Another, very welcome addition is mint oreos, they really make the recipe and people seem to like them better than the original oreos.  Fantastic recipe!!!

These were amazing! I'm new to baking/cooking (newlywed) and had no problem making these. I did take others advice to chill the mixture then roll into balls and chill again before coating,and it went pretty smooth. I'm an Army wife with a hubby who works 12 hours shifts,so I made them as an xmas gift to the boys at his job. They LOVED them and I've been asked several times ,already, when I'm making more! I can't wait to try different variations! Thanks so much for the recipe! :)

These taste great, but what a pain in the neck to make! I would hardly call them "easy". I did one batch with regular Oreo's and one with mint Oreo's for my husband's office. Maybe that's why it seemed like so much work. I also had a hard time getting the cookies to crumble in the food processor - I had to do 5 or 6 at a time. Tedious, but they do taste good.

Addictive, unique, and rich! My best friend is the one who found this recipe; after I indulged in the truffles she made, I couldn't wait to try it myself. The white chocolate is my personal favorite...but you can't go wrong with any combo. They do require a lot of patience and they are a bit (a lot) messy to make. Worth it!

I brought these to a Thanksgiving potluck and they disappeared.  I actually saw the kids come up and steal half the tray for their table.  The only changes I made were using chocolate almond bark to coat them, because its what I had.  I also didn't sprinkle the top with the extra cookie crumbs because it just made them messier.

Excellent, fairly easy to make even for me; did the plain (no double stuff) and the mint one's. Next time I do the mint one's I'm going to try less cream cheese (maybe 3/4 package) because they were moister and harder to work with than the regular one's.  Melted chocolate in the microwave, punt in the fridge for a few hours, and got out to dip in small portions.  Would definitely make again!!!

This is a great recipe . . . I used milk chocolate as the coating for half and white chocolate for the other half.  I prefer the white chocolate, as the milk chocolate was a bit too much chocolate (if there is such a thing)  :)

I cooked these last year for Thanksgiving.  I made two batches of these, and every single one of them was eaten.  Everyone raved about them, and complained because they were eating too many.  I was new to the dipping in chocolate thingie, so mine weren't as pretty as some, but delicious none-the-less.  I'm hoping to perfect the dipping method more this year. :)

These were really good.  I crushed the Oreos in the food processor and then I added the cream cheese to the processor.  I then scooped, rolled the truffles, and placed them in the freezer for about 20 minutes.  After that I melted the chocolate in the microwave but I don't think it was warm enough because I had trouble evenly coating the truffles.  Other than that they tasted pretty good.

These are very easy to make but a little time consuming. I tried covering them with semi sweet chocolate and it totally masked the oreo flavor. They are much better with white chocolate. My fiance thinks I am a top chef after making these! If he only knew ;)

These are soooo good and easy!  I don't save any of the cookies to grind up and sprinkle over the top and the only thing I do different is to use milk chocolate chips with a little bit of paraffin instead of baking chocolate.  They taste even better the next day!

This is by far the easiest and best truffles ever!  You cant go wrong with this recipe and the results are just amazing! I have made these truffles numerous times.. they are a hit every time!  I chop up the oreos in a food processor and add the cream cheese to the food processor to mix them together.  Roll little balls and put them in the refrigerator for a while.  I would recommend only taking about half out.. working with that half to dip in the chocolate and then take the other half out - its just easier to work with the truffles when they are cold! I have used white chocolate, vanilla, and chocolate for the coverings and different types of garnish.. you can really do anything - just simple recipe.. a keeper!

Overall this was a very easy to use recipe.  I added  a few teaspoons of cherry rum to the melted chocolate and it gave the truffles a nice shiny finish (plus it made the dipping process easier because the chocolate was smoother).

Amazingly easy!  A must at work functions.  Put a row of oreos at a time into the blender & pulse it to crush it the quickest w/o burning up your motor.  Refridgeration does help.  Use a single fork to roll the ball in the chocolate & tap the ball off the fork onto the wax paper.  Sidenote - only use 4oz of creamcheese for specialty oreos as there's less in the pack.  Another great way to get mint flavor is to add creme de menth (to taste) to the chocolate. Very pretty as it turns white chocolate a pretty green color.

I made these for a holiday party and people went NUTS for them. I have been asked repeatedly to make them again and again. I like to smash candy canes and sprinkle the peppermint dust over these once freshly dipped in the chocolate, but anything will do. I'm thinking about toffee-covered ones next. YUM!

This is another YUMMY, EASY and EVERYONE LOVED it recipe!  This is a "get your hands sticky" kind of recipe.  A few things that I did differently was I scraped the cream from the cookie and set it aside.  I used the cream (a little larger than a pea) and shaped the cookie around it- for a nice creamy surprise when you bite into it (I hate to waste something so yummy and why not?!)  I used Smith/Kroger brand Chocolate Bark as Baker's tends to be a little thicker in consistency-which if that's the case, add oil (drop by drop) and mix well.  I used a glass (or ceramic) cup which keeps the chocolate warmer longer -if you don't have a double boiler.  I used a fork to fish them out of the cup-the spaces between it helps the excess chocolate drip off.  If you're a perfectionist, making the cookie as round and bump-less as possible is the key here, as the chocolate shell will only accentuate the lumps and bumps.  However, if you like the lumps and bumps- adding a few accented chocolate lines over the top of the truffle and drizzle some extra cookie crumbs on top will quickly detour the eye from imperfections and YUMMY nonetheless!

So good!! I brought these to my school counselors and they raved about them. I added a bit of melted chocolate to the cream cheese mixture which made them even better. I didn't put the crushed cookies on top, I instead drizzled white chocolate on top. One fabulous truffle, definitely try these out :)

Simply delicious! This was definitely the hit dessert for Easter! I used melted white chocolate chips to coat them and drizzled them with melted semi sweet chips in a ziploc bag with the tip cut off. I did however have trouble with the mixture starting to become undone, so make sure it's properly rolled and refrigerated for longer than an hour. Also with the white chocolate I added a tbs of vegetable oil to thin it and make it easier for dipping. Toothpicks helped a lot! Definitely give it a try the mixture is so delicious I could even eat it by itself!

I love this recipe.  Impress your friends and family with what you can readily find at the store.  I just melted semi sweet chocolate chips for dipping.  I made it before for  a neighborhood supper club and found that after about two hours in the fridge, they are even smoother and yummier.  I'm signing off to make a batch for my hubby right now!

Great go-to recipe!  I've made these three times in the past month and they have disappeared in the blink of an eye all three times.  I use chocolate bark coating kept melted over a double boiler for dipping and it works like a charm.  The dipping is a bit time consuming, but it's worth it for the final product.  I will say that crushing 9 cookies for topping is a lot.  I used the crumbs I crushed for the first batch for topping all three batches.  The crumbs keep well in a air tight container, so it worked out well.  I can't wait to try this recipe using all the different flavors of Oreos.

Used white and regular chocolate and drizzled opposite flavor over each one. Took to my boyfriends for Christmas and it was the 2nd fav dish to the pork tenderlion and the little ones fought over the last few.  Thanks a bunch!!

What can you say? SO good. Sometimes the chocolate can be hard to deal with, but once you get the swing of it, it's easy. Mine didn't look as pretty- but they didn't last long enough to get a good look!

Taste is right on! I made so many for Christmas give aways and they are so labor intensive that I don't want to make another truffle again for a long time. The ingredients are deceptive. So easy to make the filling. Rolling them all in chocolate is soooo time consuming for a large batch.

Delicious! When I don't have time to mess with the dipping, I roll them in toasted coconut, oreo crumbs or mini chocolate chips. Definitely a keeper! Made them for a bridal shower and they were a great favor wrapped in a truffle box with ribbons!

These were SOOOO rich and good.  Very simple to make.  I do recommend chilling the cookie mixture for a little while before dipping.  And my advise on dipping: Just put down a lot of newspaper on your counter, use a toothpick in the center of each ball, dip, swirl, and use a spoon so cover any missed spots.  Just set them down and they'll dry just fine.  Mmmmm.. Oreos and cream cheese...what more could you want?

omg...these are amazing...they are kind of a pain to make but sooooooooo worth it, i crushed the oreos in a small food processor 3 at a time, so if i had a normal sized one that would have been a breeze....and i melted chocolate in the microwave but the balls weren't too easy to dip in there they didn't fall apart but the chocolate kept thickening up maybe next time i'll freeze the balls for a little before dipping....i will DEFINITELY be making these again ALOT..love them!

these are great!! my family realy liked them, they are almost gone.  do put in fridge for an hour before trying to dip them in choc.  i also took them out of fridge in small bunches to keep the rest cool until i could get to them.  this kept them at a good temp for dipping.

I made these for Valentines Day. I decorated them with pink almond bark. They turned out very cute. Both my boyfriend and I tried them just after they hardened and were dissapointed. I stuck them in the fridge, thinking that I would just give them away, a few days later I was putting them in something to take them to work. Tasted one, they were 3 times better!

The Oreo and cream cheese part was easy, but the melted chocolate part was a study in failure. My truffles look like little piles of poo.  Tasty little piles of poo.  Not as easy as the recipe suggests, wish I had read more reviews for hints on chilling them before dipping.

These tasted ok, but were not really worth the extra effort. Eating the Oreos from the box was more satisfying for a chocolate craving. I'll stick to making ganache truffles from now on - same amount (or less!) work, WAY better taste!

Fantastic!  Yummy!  I made these for Valentine's Day and they are excellent.  I used reduced-fat cream cheese and reduced-fat Oreos so I didn't feel SO gulity for eating them!  After rolling all the balls, I chilled overnight and that helped with the dipping.  I used milk chocolate Toll House chips instead of Baker's, but I think the center is what makes this goodie so good anyway!  I did have to add about a tablespoon of half and half so I could mix them with my hand mixer.  No food processor :(  Enjoy!

OMG!!!! Good thing I made half a recipe or the results wouldn't be pretty around the waistline. Next time I'm going to make some w/mint oreo's because I love them. When I first tried one right after making I didn't think they were a 5 star, but after being in the refrigerator for several hours OMG. I swear the longer they sat the better they became.  The BEST truffles from this website without alcohol in them.  Very EASY to make with few ingredients.

Made these as stated. They were very easy and SINFULLY DELICIOUS. if you make these you will never crave upscale storebought chocolates again. As others suggested, this recipe would be good to try with other filling/coating variations. Go make them now for your Valentine!

these are really simple and delicious. next time though i will only crush 4 or 5 Oreos for the topping, because i was left with way to much topping. but that is okay my boyfriend will use is for an ice cream topping! other than that my friends loved them, will be using this recipe as an addition to my Christmas cookie collection. thanks for the great recipe!!

AWESOME!!  These were so good I had people stopping by the house just to try them after hearing how good they were!  I didnt change a thing except using less oreos for the crumb topping.  Instead of 9, I used 4 and I still had more than enough left over.  I did, however, use all 36 oreos for the filling.  The dipping was a bit challenging so I used two forks to pick the balls up.  Dont be discouraged when you see the fork marks -- they get covered when the chocolate runs off.  After sitting in the fridge for a few hours they look amazing!  I will definitly be making these again....and again!

All my friends loved this and I made it for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day and he raved about it! Basically just make sure you chill the "dough" a lot inbetween steps and that makes rolling and dipping a lot easier

These are SO good and extremely easy.  I make the truffles using the reduced fat oreos and 1/3 fat cream cheese and then freeze overnight before dipping into the melted chocolates with two forks and put them onto a wax paper lined cookie sheet.  The chocolate hardens quickly so make sure you sprinkle the crushed cookies on the wet choc. so it sticks.  I coat 6-10 at a time and then sprinkle the cookie crumbs.

I just made these with Trader Joe's Candy Cane Jo-Jo cookies and they were FANTASTIC! Since these particluar cookies are only produced around the holidays you can acheive the same flavor with peppermit extract or combining crushed peppermint candies to the mix. These vanished in no time! Give it a try sometime :-)

I learned this recipe 3 years ago, known as oreo balls, and I am in LOVE with them. But one thing i want to change is that I like them better when they're more chunky, not just crumbs on the inside, so i hand-smush them. Yeah, it's messy, but fun when makin with a friend! Haha.  Also you can use vanilla almond bark to dip them into to get a different flavor.

According to my extended family, these are fabulouse and for that I give the recipe 5 stars.  But personally I am not that crazy about the cream cheese in this.  Unusual, since I love cream cheese in nearly anything.

Made this recipe for Christmas and it was too die for. I added some shortening to the melted chocolate to give me more working time. I also used a fork to dip the balls into the chocolate. This way the extra can dip through the slots.

I made these as gifts for Christmas and they were a HUGE hit. No one could believe how easy they were to make. I used mint oreos and used white chocolate chips that were colored red and topped with green to make them festive. I will be making again for Valentine's day!!

Very delicious, melt in your mouth truffles!  The oreos made a nice crunchy inside but smooth at the same time because of the cream cheese.  So very good!

These came out great! I went to a non-grocery store to get stuff I needed for the recipe and they didn't have baking chocolate so I bought semi-sweet chocolate chips. I don't think they melted as well as the baking chocolate but it still worked! They look fantastic and taste delicious!

I can't believe how amazing these are! They were so easy to make and tasted like store-bought chocolate candies. Everyone who tasted these asked how I made them. The inside is so gooey, just like a real truffle. Its amazing how something so simple is so satisfying! These are also very pretty and would make a great gift if packaged nicely!

These were easy to make, and popular at our Christmas parties, though I found them a little too rich for my taste. Everyone concurred that they were much better dipped in white chocolate than milk chocolate!

These are SOOOOO easy and I got RAVE reviews from everyone.  I made 3 batches of these the first round for all the neighbors along with some other goodies and these were by far the favorites.  I put the oreo/cream cheese mixture in the freezer for 1 hour before coating in chocolate as suggested which was a life saver.  After these were such a hit at Christmas I made another batch for our New Years party.  I used the limited edition candy cane oreos that only come out around the holidays and they were EXCELLENT!  They tasted like thin mint girlscout cookies!!

Very easy and tasty recipe! I make these for holidays and use different Oreos sometimes. My husband likes the mint Oreos crushed on the inside, and I also add a few drops of mint flavoring to the chocolate coating on the exterior. YUMMY!

These were a HUGE hit with my Christmas company!  I used white almond bark for the coating and drizzled a bit of chocolate almond bark ontop for a fancy look.  I should have made more because they went fast!

I made these for Christmas to share at the gatherings I went to.  They were good and got good reviews.  They are a bit rich, so most could only handle one or two.  I wish I would of used milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet.  I did however, drizzle some white chocolate over the semi-sweet onces that looked fancy, as well as dipped a few completely in the white chocolate.  The white chocolate ones got better reviews than the semi-sweet ones.  Easy to make though!

These are a Holiday tradition.  I use white almond bark for the coating, then squiggles of chocolate almond bark on top.  Store any leftovers in the refrigerator.

My first batch was tasty .. but not pretty at all. Let's put it this way - my kids called it "Reindeer poop" I don't know how to make these look like truffles from a candy shop but they do taste like they were from one. Thank you for the recipe  :)

I made this recipe in the food processor. It mixed up very easily. My only thought was that the dough seemed very gooey afterwards, possibly over mixed. I first tryed these at a school function and the cream cheese appeared to not be totally mixed in. I'm wondering if thats how they are supose to look or the way mine came out? Also, should these be stored in the refigerator? The two forks with the center tines removed worked great for dipping. I found that the chocolate coating cracked on several balls so a re-dip was done. I used crused candy cane on some of the balls which was tasty.

Oh my gosh! Worth the effort! Absolutely delicious! My fiance discovered them before our family arrived for Christmas dinner and I thought there would be none left by the time they came!  Definitely refrigerate the cream cheese/oreo balls for about an hour or so before attempting to dip, otherwise they'll be too soft and fall apart. I melted 4 ounces of chocolate at a time so it wouldn't solidify while I was dipping, perhaps more time consuming but it worked for me. I didn't have a technical way of dipping other than dropping in a ball, rolling it around with small cappuccino spoons, and pulling it out. I'm looking forward to trying these again next year with the holiday flavoured Oreos!

I used good cream cheese and Ghiradelli chocolate and they were divine. Everyone loved them!! After mixing the cookies and cream cheese together and placing it in the frig for 30 minutes. I then used a small scooper made for cookies, to get them all the same size, I scooped them out. Wore medical gloves and shaped them into balls without any problems whatsoever. Again in the frig for 30 minutes then dipped them with a candy dipper into the Ghiradelli chocolate. Very simple and I did not have any problems with them falling apart and no cookies under my nails.

This recipe is wonderful! I made some for christmas I everyone loved them. I kept having to make more because everyone was eating them so fast. I also tried different flavored oreo's like mint, and candy cane. With the candy cane oreo's I used white baking chocolate and then sprinkled with candy cane.

Warning - these are addicting!  I don't have a large food processer, so I crushed the cookies in a ziplock.  Then I whipped the cream cheese in my electric mixer and added the crushed cookies and beat until it came together.  I also used a small cookie scoop to make sure they were all the same size, then rolled into balls.  I dipped in dark chocolate and almond bark.  We liked the almond bark best.  So easy and fantastic!

wonderfully delicious!!! And true to it's name, it was very easy to make these balls of goodness. My family loved them yesterday...so much that there wasn't room left for cake, pie, cookies, etc! I used the tip about keeping our hands clean and wet, worked great, along with the slotted spoon method. I can't wait to make these again...you can do so much with them and really express yourself! I had quite a few people (including kids!) ask me for the recipe. Big hit. :)

These are so incredibly decadent, people never believe how easy they are to make.  I have made them with both white and milk chocolate and both are equally delicious.  I love how fancy they look-  they are perfect for gift-giving in a pretty holiday plate wrapped with cellophane.  I find that the best way to mix the cookie crumbs and cream cheese is to dig right in with my hands.  Then I pop it in the freezer for about 15 minutes, which makes rolling them into balls a cinch!  I'm sure I will make these many times!

These are great!  I made them with Oreos and used chocolate candy coating from the baking aisle.  I also made them with Nutter Butter cookies and the same chocolate candy coating.  Very good and very rich!

My family loved these truffles. My dad actually took a 3 day leave on his 'diet' to have some of these. Though my little brother didn't like these, probably because he is very picky. Its a great Christmas gift also.

Oh my gosh!!  These are amazing.  I used the entire package of oreos, ground them up into powder, then mixed them w/the softened cream cheese and a teaspoon of vanilla.  You can use different flavored oreos (I tried mint flavered too!) and they we incredible.  I refrigerated for an hour after rollng.  Also, I melted Mercken's chocolate dsks nstead of the baking chocolate.  Reaalllyy good!  Got tons of compliments.

A co-worker made these but slightly different.  They were so amazing i had to make some myself! Some things I do different that I think makes it easier is- I use 1/3 less fat cream cheese... still sweet but not as sweet or oily.  I also use milk chocolate from melted chocolate chips.  I mix one box of cream cheese with one box of crushed oreos and refrigerate.  After they are chilled, then roll them and dip them.  I put them in the chocolate, roll them with a spoon and "plop" them on waxed paper.  They arent as "pretty" but so yummy!  And refrigerate after.  I dont add the crumbs to the top, just seems like more effort then needed.  I have also made them with mint oreos... I love mint and these surprizingly have a very slight hint of mint, which is also very nice!

Okay... maybe I'm missing it, but no where did I read that you were supposed to add the oreo filling back into the mix with the cream cheese. I'm sure you can all see where this is going, but I'll say it anyway. Yes... I did forget it!! Also, just so you know... it did taste gross, but what a recipe!! I had already coated the candies in chocolate, and knew they weren't going to be any good, so I just threw them back in the mixer, and added the cookie filling back into the mix. It turned out (even though I had coated it with chocolate)!! I will make this again, and next time it will be done correctly!! :)

These taste amazing! However, I rated it 4 stars due to proportions stated in the recipe. I was able to get by with one 8 oz box of chocolate. It also seemed like 9 crushed cookies for the topping was waaaay too much. I would also suggest sprinkling the topping right after you dip each piece in chocolate (I waited until done with all of them and the first ones were already set). I bet these would be even more amazing in white chocolate.

These truffles are incredibly simple to make and have a very rich flavour. I halved the recipe, using only half a box of double stuff oreos (my favourite) and half a brick of cream cheese, which yielded about a dozen truffles. I froze the cookie/cream cheese mixture for about an hour as per the other reviews and it made it much easier to form and dip them. I'm looking forward to trying a variety of cookies and toppings. Thank you very much for sharing!

A co worker brought these to work yesterday and they were a big hit so I thought I would try making them for a party tomorrow night. I found the center a little messy to work with. Put the balls in the freezer for awhile to make it easier to dip in chocolate. Melted chocolate almond bark used a kabob skewer to dip the ball into the melted chocolate, placed on wax paper and spooned oreo crumbs on top immedicately before the chocolate firmed. Very good recipe. Will make more before Christmas.

I made these to take to my office party at work. Everyone loved them. They were a huge hit. They are sweet but not too sweet since the outside is semi sweet chocolate. Someone else who reviewed said not to use double stuff but i used the double stuff oreos and they turned out wonderful. I think they were better than the normal oreos.

Made these last Christmas. They are so easy to make. I put them in the freezer for an hour or so before I dipped them in chocolate. It made it much easier to coat them. My sister begged me to make them again this year.

These are easy and delicious to make!! I put each truffle in a small cupcake holder to display at parties and they are a huge hit. I would suggest put the balls in the freezer for some time before dipping in chocolate, too. Also, if you use Mint Oreos, they tend to be mushier and need more freezer time. I roll in-between my hands to smooth into more of a ball before dipping. YUMMY!

I have been making these for a couple years now and they are a hit with EVERYONE you will meet. So so good! I also add a tablespoon of shortening to the chocolate chips and melt it in there to thicken it up, if you don't have shortening laying around then follow the exact recipe with no worries.

Awesome!  A little messy when dipping in chocolate. I found rotating between two forks when removing the truffle to wax paper worked pretty well.  I made my first batch using white chocolate...incredible flavor.  My second batch I made using Oreo Peanut butter cookies.  I added maybe a 1 1/2 tablespoons of creamy peanut butter as well and then dipped in semi-sweet...I have two words for you..."YUM MEE"!!

These are great! My sister's friend recommends using white chocolate almond bark and drizzling a design on the top of the chocolates rather than sprinkling the crushed OREO. Still great!

I love oreos, so they weren't bad. A bit cream cheesy tasting, but everyone seemed to like them okay. I'd rather they taste more chocolaty than like cream cheese though.

These are fool proof.  Three ingredients. Doesn't cost much to make this in bulk and give away either.  I have also made these using peanutbutter cookies instead of oreos...JUST as good as a reese cup, if not better!

These are awesome!  Heres my tip tho - after you have crushed the oreos in the food processor, just throw the cream cheese into the food processor as well.  Hand mixing was next to impossible!

Super easy recipe and very delicious!!  Great one to do with the kids.  I agree that you can do the whole crushing/mixing process in the food processor and then roll into balls.   Enjoy!!

Loved this recipe to bits!! but coating the balls with chocolate was pretty much of a hassle, to be honest. other than that, it turned out great!

These are really good. But what is not to love about oreos, cream cheese, and chocolate.  I placed the mixture in the fridge overnight before balling up and dipping in the chocolate.

I have also been making these truffles and various other truffles using the same technique, for years.  They are always the first to go.  Just to add: I have the best luck dipping using a fork and then pouring the chocolate over the ball with a spoon.  I also like to use white and regular chocolates and decorate with drizzles of the other, jimmies and the like.  You can't go wrong with this easy recipe.  Oh, wanted to add: if your chocolate gets hard just keep nuking for a few seconds to re-melt and add a couple drips of milk if necessary to thin it out.

I have been making these for a few years.  They are fantastic.  Everyone request that I make them, if they only knew how easy they truly are. I also melt a small amout of white chocolate and place on a spoon and shake/drizzle over the plate of truffles makes them very pretty.  I do this instead of reserving the 9 oreos for the top.

I love these truffles!!!  We had them at a cookie exchange one year and did not know the name of them at the time because the cook would not reveal her recipe.  We dubbed them better than sex cookies.  :)

My sons are crazy about these.  I use almond bark instead of baking chocolate.  I dip half in chocolate bark and half in white- then I drizzle the opposite color on top of them.  They look very fancy and taste delicious.

I made these with semi-sweet chocolate chips instead and it was super easy!  My husband took them to work the next day and they were gone by lunch...I will be making these again for Christmas.  Very rich and creamy.

These are excellent but the chocolate coating can be a bit frustrating. I was reading all the tips and didn't see this one-thinning the chocolate with either butter or shortening makes the coating task a lot easier and the results a bit more professional.  I also tried the mint oreos but found that the cookie filling was too thick. Could have just been my lame food processor. The nutter butter ones are great!  I'm gonna try adding some flavored extracts for fun!

These were good, but not great.  My boyfriend and I couldn't put our finger on what was off, but it might be the semi sweet chocolate.  If I make them again, I might use milk chocolate instead.

These are awesome!!  After I roll them into balls I put them in the freezer for a couple hours and it makes them easier to dip in the chocolate.  I also use almond bark for the dipping.  Very yummy!!

I will agree that these are easy - and if you chill the rolled balls, they are a cinch to dip. They are tasty, and my family gave them 4 stars (compared with other truffle recipes we have made).

They are delicious.  Everybody loved them.  Although I did have trouble coating them with the chocolate once they were rolled.  Next time I make them I'm going to chill them before I coat them in chocolate.

These are so easy considering how nice they look and how yummy they taste! The only hard part is getting the chocolate coating onto the rolled balls. Everyone has their own favorite method--I found a fondue skewer helpful to hold the ball while I ladled the chocolate on with a spoon. My husband used the two-spoon method (cup it with one spoon while rolling it around in the chocolate with the other). We drizzled white chocolate over them once they'd set, and they look very elegant that way. I haven't tried making them with peanut butter cookies yet, but it sounds delicious!

I made these for the holidays last year. They were a hit! Everyone wanted the recipe! I use almond bark to dip them in...its very delicious! I refridgerated them for an hr before dipping them. And I also added a couple of teaspoons of water to the oreo and cream cheese mixture to soften and make them more pliable. They were wonderful and very moist on the inside like a brownie!! Hope everyone loves them as much as my family does!!

Very easy to make. I used milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet chocolate. I first made the dough (creamcheese and oreo mix) and left it in the fridge for 20 minutes. Then I made them into balls and put it back in the fridge for another 30 minutes so they get firm. I used a double broiler to melt the chocolate. I also used a fork to dip the balls in the chocolate. They didn't fall apart and it was easy to get a nice coating all around. Instead of sprinkling with oreo crumb...i sprinkled nuts instead. They came out great and tasted delicious.

these are sooo good.. A little hard to cover the balls in chocolate. 

i followed a few reviews and put the oreo balls in the freezer for 15 mins before dipping them in chocolate. 

Then i poke the balls with a toothpick and dip it in chocolate and stick them on foam.(packaging from the dvd player)and put them in the freezer immediately. 

take them out in 10 minutes, take the truffles out of the toothpick and drizzle it with white chocolate.. Yumm

I've done this recipie a few times with my boyfriend. It's always a hit.i noticed some people have trouble with the chocolate coating.. the first time we made this we decided to add coconut, dip in chocolate then in coconut, it adds flavor and makes it look nicer.. this recipie is so basic, theres endless ways to change it.

These are wonderful except next time I would use almond bark as others have suggested. The chocolate is so hard and messy to 'roll' the balls in that they come out way too thick with chocolate. The inside is yummy though!

These are INCREDIBLY delicious!    I've made them using dark chocolate chips and they are even more rich than using the bakers chocolate.

Instead of shaping into ball I shaped into almost ovals and made chocolate mice out of these. I followed another recipe on this site for the ears (sliced almond)and pull and peel licorice for the tail and eyes, and a pink sprinkle for the nose. They turned out so great.

Easy and delicious. Scooped out the cream cheese/cookie mix into little balls and froze them on a cookie sheet. After they had hardened, I melted the bark, dropped one ball in at a time, and used a fork to scoop the balls out. Laid it back on the cookie sheet, sprinkled the crushed oreos on top and placed it back in the fridge. Had to work fairly quickly but it turned out awesome :)

Super Easy and relatively fast (I did freeze before dipping and used a spoon and a fork for the process). Sprinkled some with chopped pecans and decorated some with white chocolate strips. To do the strips: Put a few (about 20 chips)white chocolate chips in a ziploc bag and push them all the way to one corner. Microwave 30 seconds at a time until they melt, squeeshing with your fingers everytime. Snip off the corner (not too small or the bag will pop when you squeeze it) and using fast side by side movements draw lines on top of the truffles. Drawback: TOO RICH! OMG!! Even without chocolate on top!!

These look like they took hours but were so quick & easy! Everyone loves, I did regular oreos dipped in white chocolate, rolled in almonds..so good! I also did pb oreos in white/semi-sweet chocolate. You have to put these in the freezer for 30 minutes after rolling. Stick a toothpick in them prior to freezing, then dip in chocolate, its quick, easy & they dont fall apart!

What a great recipe! I rolled them into balls, inserted a toothpick and then put them in the fridge for a few hours. Then I dipped some in white almond bark with chocolate drizzle and some in chocolate almond bark with white drizzle. I put them back in the fridge and 1 hour later took them out and the toothpick just slipped right off. Turned out great and sooo easy!

These are so wonderful! The only thing i dont like about this recipe is dipping the oreo balls into the melted chocolate. I've tried everything from toothpicks, spoons, slotted spoons, hands, and i still cant get the chocolate on them easily and pretty. still wonderful though!

These were really good. What I did instead was scrape the cream off of all the oreo cookies first, mashed up the cookies than mixed the oreo cookie filling with a bit of cream cheese into the mashed up cookies. Tasted exactly like oreo cookies dipped in chocolate.

i enjoyed making these-it was a challenge & I did not make them for anything special-just sounded yummy & I had the stuff in hand. the dipping part was not so hard & I did not cool balls first-which i would recommend it would probably be a lot easier-though it was not too difficult uncooled. i used a slotted spoon dropped a ball on it & dripped chocolate from another spoon, and used the spoon to dress the chocolate on-worked fine-beautiful..next time i will take the time to dress them up a little more-they were very yummy..thanks!

I love these!  I've made these several times over the past year, and they are always a big hit.  I like to add 1/2 tsp. peppermint extract to the oreo mixture.  I usually only have to use 1 1/2 packages (or 12 squares) of the chocolate to melt.

Everyone loves these, but they are very rich.  This time I made 1 batch using regular oreos with milk chocolate outside and 1 batch with peanut butter oreos and almond bark outside. I don't know which I like better. These are a definite treat...only made for special occasions.

oreos, cream cheese and chocolate...what can be better?!!  These were super easy.  I put the balls in the freezer for about 15-20 min before dipping in the chocolate. I then melted the chocolate (I used 80% milk chocolate chips and 20% semi-sweet) and they were so easy to roll with a spoon and fork.  So easy and so delicious.

Definitely make the truffles the day before (literaly takes minutes)then refrigerate over nite. The next day dip the truffles, I used two forks scooping the balls and letting the chocolate drip through the tongs of the fork. I think I might try a milk chocolate dip next time (personal taste).

This is AWESOME! Well worth the work, but still VERY easy to make. It was simple for me to do, because I froze the balls before dipping for about 40 minutes on a tray lined with wax paper. I used a fork for dipping, and let the excess chocolate run off before placing back on the wax paper. I used Chocolate Almond Bark which works so well. By the way I only used 30 cookies, instead of 36 mixed with the cream cheese, because I knew it would hold together better when dipping. All I can say is YUM!!!!

Dirty Snowballs!  Someone brought these to a gathering and I have been searching for the recipe.  Everything is the same, accept I had them dipped in white chocolate.  They were called Dirty Snowballs... so it didn't matter if you got oreo mixed in with the white chocolate.  I took other's advice and thought the double boiler and slotted spoon were a must!

Very decadent and very delicious. I preferred the ones I coated in white chocolate because of the contrast. I also followed other reviewers' advice by keeping the dough chilled and only working with half of it at a time

Decadent.  These were so easy and delicious.  After putting them in the fridge for about 20 minutes, I used a cookie-scooper to make them bite-sized (it made the process quick and uniform).  Then I dipped them in dark chocolate.  Enjoy.

This is a fun EASY treat. I like to add coconut to oreo/cream cheese mix. Then after I dip them in chocolate I sprinkle coconut on top. They are so freakin' good. If I don't put coconut on them, I drizzle white chocolate on top... or dip them in white chocolate and drizzle dark chocolate. THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS.

No matter what anyone says... DO NOT USE MORSELS - use the best quality chocolate.  The recipe that I used to make these was the same, but it called for morsels, not Baker's.  It was a nightmare to dip the balls in the chocolate.  They looked clumpy and absolutely horrible.  After trying a few, I improvised with good quality milk chocolate and they were SO much easier to dip.  Tasted great.  I also drizzled with white chocolate, although the oreo crumbs would be fantastic. Word to the wise:  the smaller the balls, the better they taste.  If they are too large, they will taste too rich and cause a tummy ache!  Definitely a hit though!!

Very easy to make, simple ingredients and affordable!  Key - make sure cookies are fine and the mixture will stay together good!  I used a fork to roll then drain the chocolate.

I made these last Christmas and they did not last very long.  This year while talking to all the girls about what we were going to have for dinner I only got one specific request.  "I want those Oreo truffles!"  They cared not what the main course would be as long as Oreo truffles were going to be there!

Pretty good, but not as popular as I expected on the dessert buffet table.  I used white chocolate instead of dark for coating.

Made this as written.  Everyone raved.  For christmas I am going to use the mint Oreos instead and drizzle some white chocolate (tinted green and red) on top.

Just a helpfull hint.  Melt the chocolate in the microwave per the instructions on the baker's chocolate box.  It made my life much easier.

Delish, back breaking though:)  Takes forever to make, but worth it.  I used melted chocolate chips for some of them and Wiltons melting discs for others, in addition to the baking squares.  My favs were the wilton chocolate discs because they harden.

I was hoping these would be close to the chocolate covered oreo cookies that are only available at Christmastime. These were better. Very rich, but very good. I had problems with melting the chocolate, but I usually do. I got it on the second try. My husband loved these and ate the majority of them.

I made these as directed, but instead of sprinkling Oreo crumbs over the chocolate-covered balls, I rolled them so they were completely covered in Oreo crumbs.  Absolutely delicious!  I almost made myself sick on these!  I took them to a Christmas party and everyone there loved them, too.  I will definitely be making them again.

No matter what event we attend, I am always asked to bring these.  I dip my in white chocolate.  I have also found that refrigerating the dough before rolling out the balls makes it much easier to handle and it doesn't flake off in the chocolate.

A client of mine (while I was working at a weight loss center no less) gave me this recipe printed off the website several years ago. She went looking for it because someone in town was charging $12 a dozen for them and her friends loved them. I have since made them on many occasions and had requests to make them many more. While time consuming, this recipe is quite easy. The last time I made several batches for an event my husband even helped. (He was so proud)I do change one thing however, I don't like using semisweet chocolate, so I using milk chocolate molding discs. I actually gave these out in nice tins for Christmas one year and people kept asking where I bought them! These are a huge hit!

I used strwberry milkshake limited edition oreos (the store was out of mint) and they turned out great!  I used only 1/2 of the cream cheese because I wanted it a little more firm to mold into egg shapes for easter. I loved it and so did the kids, I decorated them with sprinkles and writing frosting.  Can't wait to try other flavors!

these weren't the 'easiest' things I've ever made...I think I had the ratio of cream cheese to cookie off, but I managed it in the end. Covering them with chocolate was a pain, but the overall affect was worth it. The filling turned mousse like the day after they were made, everyone loved them!

I absolutely love these - but a warning, unless you love chocolate you might not feel the same way.  I've taken them to a party and people either LOVED them or thought it was way too much chocolate.  Also, if you drizzle white chocolate on them it is easier to melt the chocolate and then put them in a ziploc bag with a tiny end cut off - it makes it so much easier and nicer.  I colored the white chocolate red/green to make them more festive.  Will make again and again!!

I made these for Christmas.  All I can say - is my gosh, are these ever rich!  Gave some away in the tiny candy cups and everyone loved them.  The only thing I hated was having to keep them in the fridge when it was already overloaded from Christmas food.  This is a keeper but you can't eat too many.
