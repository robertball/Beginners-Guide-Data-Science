I make this cake every xmas:  one of my favs!  I found recipe many yrs ago in SL Heritage Cakes, the bible of southern cakes.   WM Great Cake, as it's called in SL,  is a somewhat of a 'white fruitcake,' but minus the traditional fruit cake flavor.  Very dense and not too sweet.   I'v found it generally takes an extra 1 hr 5 mins:  you'r lkg @ 3 hrs+ in oven.
