sorry I should have stated I don't use all the olive oil at one recipe. I make the orange olive oil to use again. It is just easier to infuse the olive oil when there it a bit more oil than about one table spoon. So after you infuse the olive oil I would only pour about 1 table spoon on top. Save the rest for another time.

A nice change to ordinary steamed green beans.  Easy to make.  Next time I'd use more orange zest and a little less oil.

I was surprised how flavorful and good-looking this dish was. I used about 3 1/2 teaspoons olive oil, and this seemed to be just right.

These were delicious and tender. Great side with roasted potatoes and pork Marsala as in the photo. Easy to make.

No changes and used all the infused oil as I made a big bowl.  It was wonderful and certainly will make it again.  Company was most impressed.  I never made infused oil before and not hard.  Can also cook the beans just prior to company arriving and finish off just before serving. Yumm.

I tried this first with asparagus, and later with green beans as I had a lot of oil left over. The oil had a subtle orange smell, but the flavor really didn't come through on the veggies. You definitely need the orange zest to get the orange flavor. And even then it was just a little too orange-y without any balancing flavor. Not bad, but I won't make it often.
