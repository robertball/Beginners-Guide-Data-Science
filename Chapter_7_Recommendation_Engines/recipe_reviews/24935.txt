I really liked this bread, although bf didn't, so I don't get to make it again.  :o(  He just didn't like the taste--guess he doesn't like curry or turmeric?  I made it into rolls and used my breadmaker to do the dough.  The rising times are very long--wasn't sure if that was for a reason or not.  It can take that long for me if I just leave the dough out but if I put it in the oven with the light on it doubles in about 1/2 hour.  I didn't use clarified butter--just regular margarine and they were fine.  The baking times seem long, but it did take about 1/2 hour at 400 for my rolls to bake. I halved the recipe and made 8 rolls.  Thanks for sharing!
