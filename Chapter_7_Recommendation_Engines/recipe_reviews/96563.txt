Highly tasty.  Highly addictive.

We substitute one can of black-eyed peas for a can of shoepeg corn to add a little variety.

This recipe is AWESOME!   I added only one jalepeno since I am a wimp and I use evoo and garlic wine vinegar instead of what is called for in the recipe, and I add a few more peppers and such.  This is a must at get togethers!

I've made this many times before using Good Seasons salad dressing as the "marinade" - while that is good, this is MUCH better. A subtle yet tasty twang - I used Rotel tomatoes (blue can) beans, corn, black eyed peas, small diced chiles, some chopped jalapenos, cilantro, green onion and a couple squirts of lime juice - addictive way to squeeze in veggie servings!

This was awesome and I will definately make again. Word of caution: WHEN CHOPPING THE JALEPENO PEPPER, WEAR GLOVES!!! I had some weird reaction and my hands burned like they were on fire for about 6 hours. It was horrible!

i really like texas caviar but i only had balsamic vinegar so i used that and it was too strong. plus there was a lot of juice. i ate this as a side dish with a barbecue dinner and it wasn't as good as i remembered. i think eating it with tortilla chips would  be a good accompinament.  my kids thought the texture of the black-eyed peas was weird. i will try it again but with regular red wine vinegar.

This was a surprise hit at my last family party.  I had an uncle in town who is vegan, so I tried to find something extra I could make for him to enjoy besides salad!  My in-laws who are usually very resistant to trying anything new and different devoured it, and were asking for the recipe.

Mine was a little on the blander side because I only used 1 jalapeno, and removed all the seeds and ribs because I didn't want it to be too spicy.  So I had to re-season it with some salt, pepper, and garlic powder after it was refrigerated.  So, just like the recipe states - taste and adjust the seasoning to your liking.

I would make this again!

Made this to go along with a big BBQ I did.  Everyone was a tad leery at first until they tried it, then it was gone in no time.  Matter of fact, I didn't even get to try it.  Thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe!  I make a double batch everytime.  I do like to add a little bit more heat with an extra two serrano peppers and one or two more jalapenos.  I also like to add a few fresh tomatos!  Make sure you drain the fine diced tomatos really well and rinse and drain the peas.

This was a delicous way to get our "good luck" black eyed peas for the new year. My husband hates black eyed peas but actually ate more than a spoonful of this.

I brought this Texas Caviar to a Family BBQ back in July and have since been asked to bring it to every family get together.  It's simple to make and a nice addition to any party.  It's now one of my go to recipes for parties.

Wow! So so good.  I diced fresh tomatoes instead and added white corn.  I gave some to the neighbors who used it on fish tacos and they loved it.

This was a HUGE hit with my family this weekend. It's traditionally good luck to eat black-eyed peas on New Year's Day (southern tradition). We are not from Texas, but we live here and we don't care for black-eyed peas. This recipe was the bomb!!! Did not change anything, but did add one small can of diced green chiles. Thank you!

Very good and got rave reviews at the party that I took this to. I used one can black beans, one can black eyed peas, cut the oil in half and used lime juice in place of. Oh, also used green onions in place of white. So yummy!

Delicious! I substituted one can of the black eyed peas with black beans. Next time I make it, I will do it the night before to give the flavors time to blend. Thanks for the great recipe!

Very very good.  I only use 1 can of black beans, add a can of corn, use fresh tomatoes and garlic, and make half the dressing (with almost full amount of spices).  After 5 tries, this is the way we like it best.  Also, it's not necessary for the fresh pepper to be a yellow or red pepper, green works just as well, and is even fresher tasting.

Not as tasty as I had hoped.  I usually make Poor Man's Caviar by FAIRBORN on this site and I will continue to use that recipe.  I sub Rotel for the tomatoes in both recipes, which adds flavor.  I think I prefer the other recipe because the flavors are much more complex, the green onions, franks hot sauce, avocado,and oil and vinegar pairs perfectly with tortilla chips.  It also calls for black beans instead of black eyed peas, which I also prefer.

I love this because the seasonings are really well balanced and I go to this recipe for that part.  I actually add a can of black beans, a can of shoe peg corn, just one jalapeño, green onions in the place of regular onion, and because I love bell pepper and frequently have several colors on hand, I dice some of each and add that too.

This is a family favorite with fritos scoops.  I make a double batch adding black, pinto and small red kidney beans as well.  I had been looking for a recipe with no corn as I don't care for it.  The dressing was spot on, I added only a couple of tsp. of sugar.  The cilantro is a must!  Gets better even after a day or two!!

OMG - this was awesome. I subbed one can black beans for one of the black eyed peas, added yellow hominy and switched the yellow pepper to an orange one for color. Unlike a previous reviewer I used Balsamic vinegar and thought it was fine. I used the leftovers to make wraps with diced chicken and some avocado. I could eat this forever.

This is a great recipe to sneak in those black eyed peas for New Year's good luck.  Served with corn chips, tortilla chips and cracked pepper and olive oil crackers, it was well received.  Couldn't find my red wine vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar instead.  Didn't seem to matter.  This one I will definitely make again.

Wow!  This was soo good!  I only used 4tbsp of EVOO and I used Rotel instead of plain petite diced tomatoes.  I made this as an appetizer to serve with chips, but I think it would be great with tacos.

Huge Hit! I loved it, the kids loved it and it even went on the Dad's Camping trip and all the other kids and Dad's loved it. Great with tortilla chips. I ran out of red wine vinegar after 4Tbls. but it was plenty. I would also limit the oil to about 4Tbls. as well.

This is wonderful! I made my own black eyed peas just to cut down on sodium. I also added one ear of fresh corn on the cob, used green bell pepper because that is what I had and I was out of cilantro. I also had to use  Mezzeta tamed japolenos because I didn't have any fresh. Main point... ALL my kids LOVED it!! pretty good to get the kiddos eating some more healthier sides, hey are 5, 7 and 9!!!!

I've had Texas Caviar previously, but I've never made it.  This was both easy AND delicious!  I had a friend tell me that he normally hates stuff like this and he couldn't stop eating it.  The only things I changed were that I used a combo of red and green bells peppers, used Ro-Tel tomatoes instead of the diced, and added a squirt of lime juice at the end.  This is even better the next day and I'm looking forward to enjoying this tasty concoction on my next batch of nachos!

Didn't use jalapenos or bell pepper since I didn't have any. Added 4 oz can chopped green chiles. Used canola oil instead of olive oil, and 1 fresh squeezed lime instead of red wine vinegar. I loved this recipe - flavorful, delicious, and satisfying. Next time I would probably use just half the oil though.

I'm a Texan and have tried a number of recipes for this dish--all good.  However, everyone at my house on Super Bowl Sunday said:  "You don't have to try any more Texas Caviar recipes.  This one is a KEEPER."  That's good enough for me--and, VERY unlike me--I didn't change a thing!  Kudos to Pam Anderson for this great recipe.

My husband loved it.  Asked me to make it again.  Change a couple things for our taste.  Black beans instead of black eyed peas and no jalapenos.  Still great. Definitely make again

I followed this recipe fairly close.  Only put in one jalapeno as we dont like it too hot.  Added some flavor, but could use two and still fairly mild.  Didnt put much olive oil as I didnt think it needed it.  Also did not put cumin in as I dont care for it.  I added a bit of spike seasoning which added a great flavor.  I will make this again.

Love this!  I make this quite often and the only modification that I make is leaving out the jalapeno peppers and the bell pepper.  Sometimes I use Italian dressing instead of the olive oil/red wine vinegar. Even my picky kids like this.  I serve with corn chip scoops.

This recipe is amazing.  I followed it almost exactly although I did add kidney beans.  It's so good.  It's something that my friends (some vegan, some vegetarian, some meat eaters) all loved and wanted me to make over and over.  This is definitely my new favorite go to meal.  Thanks for the recipe.

I tweaked this just a bit. Instead of 2 cans of black-eyed peas I used 1 can of black-eyed peas and 1 can of black beans (drained & rinsed). I substituted a can of Rotel tomatoes for the diced tomatoes and jalapenos and substituted red & green bell pepper for the yellow bell pepper. I used the exact amount of red wine vinager & oil called for and I found it to be a little on the vinagery side - you could probably cut back and still have great flavor.

This is wonderful, simple and nutritious! For more color and interest, I substituted one of the cans of black-eyed peas for a can of black beans then I added some canned corn. Perfect!

I had to make this recipe for a dinner group.  It ended up being enough for our dinner party as well as another small party the next night and I still had left overs!  My husband talks about it often.  I used evoo because it was all I had.  I served it with tortilla chips.  I did drain out a little of the liquid because there seemed to be too much, but I think it would have been just as good with it all.  I am definitely going to make again and again.  It's a refreshing change to regular salsa.

Oh my gosh. This is soooo good!  I used canned black beans instead of black-eyed, fresh tomatoes, and I added a lot of corn.  It was delicious!  I made 1/2 batch and it was gone within the hour.  Very healthy too.  This will be a regular item at our house.

The homemade dressing really kicks this recipe off!  I did end up adding a few things.  I omitted the jalapeno and the yellow bell pepper.  I added a can of black beans, a can of pinto beans, 2 cans of shoepeg corn and 2 cans of chopped green chilis.  Everyone flipped over it... will definitely make again!

I liked this recipe a lot.  First time trying Texas Caviar.  I changed the recipe to my liking and it turned out great. I replaced canned corn for the yellow pepper (didn't have yellow pepper). I also used one can black beans and one can black-eyed peas & doubled the jalepeno pepper.  Also, I used just 1 teaspoon of white vinegar and the juice of two limes, real garlic instead of powder. Options are endless... Avocado would be a great addition as well!

Really delicious!!! Neede a different way to serve black eyed peas for New Years day. Make sure you let it set in the fridge for at least an hour to let the flavors meld. It really males all the difference.

I really wanted to give this recipe 4 1/2 stars but I can't so I settled for 4.  I took this dish to a get together and I had mixed reviews.  I felt it was lacking something for taste, not sure what,but it could use something to sweeten it a little or maybe a little hot sauce to give it a kick.  I did use black eyed peas and black beans, Rotel tomatoes, added a small can of corn, red onion, a little garlic powder and some diced avocado prior to serving.

This was so good - most recipes I came across use bottled Italian dressing so this was a nice substitute. Also, instead of 2 cans of black eyed peas, I used only one, added 1 can of black beans and one can full of thawed, frozen corn. For the onion, I used red and used red pepper insted of yellow. Great color! I only used one jalapeno as the ones I bought were TOO hot! As for the amount of dressing, I kept that the same. This is going to be a great recipe all summer long!

Fantastic.  i used 1 can black-eyed peas, 1 can black beans, and only 1 Jalapeno ( no seeds) and red, not yellow peppers.  It disappeared when I took it to work.  Was spicy but not upsetting to others' tummies.

So, so, so good! I left out the jalapenos and reduce the amount of cilantro to let the other flavors shine. It ended up being perfect! A friend who has made another version of this for years asked me for the recipe because it was better than hers!

Texas Monthly Magazine featured an article about Texas Caviar this month. It says that Helen Corbitt, a head chef of Neiman Marcus for 17 years came up with the original recipe for this dish in 1940. Neiman Marcus even canned it and sold it in their stores. Just thought I would share a little bit of history.

Made this for a family dinner.  It was a real hit.  Family gobbled it up.  It was used as a dip, on top of salad, and even over the grilled chicken.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Addictive recipe!!!! I omitted the olive oil and added 2 diced avocados and the juice of one lime.  Also, used fresh black eyed peas from the farmer's market, just boiled for a few minutes unil soft. Next time I may add another jalapeno.  This will be made over and over in my house.  Thanks!

Absolutely fantastic. I made a bunch of changes (added avocado, used red rather than yellow pepper, omitted cilantro) and it was still delicious. The key, I think, is the awesome dressing!

Made this for New Year's Day and it was wonderful!  We thought it was just right - I used two jalapenos but removed all seeds and most of the ribs... For our family - the heat was just right.  A keeper - Thanks!

This is always a hit at parties because it's light and easy to eat.  I serve w/ Tostitos scoops.  It makes it easy for people to walk by and grab a bite without spilling it off the chip.  The only change I make is black beans for the black-eyed because of preferred taste.

This is so delicious! I used Hepworth Farms mixed cherry tomatoes and cut them in half instead of diced canned tomatoes. Also, I used half the seeds from one of the jalapeños for a little spice.

This recipe is really good!  I used fresh grape tomatoes instead of canned and added some frozen corn. I don't like black eyed peas but really liked this!  It tasted similar to a 3 bean salad to me.

I brought this to GNO last night and it was a hit. Everyone wanted the recipe. Next time I make this I will double the recipe and use fresh tomatoes instead of canned (a previous reviewer was correct -- if you use canned, drain very well!). Loved it!!

Thanks for a recipe that doesn't use the bottled dressings!  I'd been looking for a Texas (Cowboy) Caviar recipe that skipped out on the preservatives and hydrogenated junk... this recipe is fresh and wonderful!

I live overseas and Wishbone is so terribly expensive and probably full of preservatives so I prefer to make the dressing myself. I pretty much followed the recipe  except for using a different pepper as we also don't have jalapenos and it really hit the spot

This is outstanding! I've also tried adding a half-cup of partially cooked whole kernel corn, VERY well drained. I've had so many people ask for the recipe, that I started keeping copies of it on hand.

I always have to double this recipe, because it is so addicting. I follow the recipe exactly, slightly adjusting the jalepeno for heat and sometimes adding a ripe, chopped avacado or two.

Love it!  I made it last year for New Year's 2008 and I plan on making it again this New Year's eve.  I served with with Tostito's scoops but also ate the left-overs by the spoonful.  Yum, Yum, Yummy!

Update:  So I did make it for New Year's 2009.  This time I added two chopped avocados and used 1 can of black-eyed peas and 1 can of black beans.  I also didn't have fresh cilantro so I used dried.  I'm still in love with this recipe!

I just made this for work and it's a hit. I used one can of black beans and one can of black-eyed peas, a can of corn in place of the bell pepper, and habenero peppers instead of jalepenos. I'll probably add one more pepper in the future to make it a little more spicy. Will make again!

Really good recipe that could be used as a dip at a party.  I used fresh tomatoes, pinto beans because they were in the pantry, and omitted the jalepeno for my wife.  The red wine vinegar made it for me because it added just the right amount of sweetness.

I made this for a Christmas Eve gathering and it was such a hit!!  Everyone loved it.  I made it EXACTLY as written and served with Tostitos Scoops.  Deliscious!!!!  We really liked the black eyed peas, try them even if you think you won't like them.

This is soooo good (and pretty good for you if you eat it with tortilla chips and not Fritos)!  Of course, it tastes best with Fritos but you can make it healthy if you want. Fantastic recipe! This one is definitely a family favorite.

This was very good. I used green onions instead of yellow and added a chopped habenero for some heat. Great with chips or alone.

I loved this!  I had never had it before but it was delish. I had about a half can of black beans and added that as well, and used some red onion for the onion in the recipe. Great on tortilla chips and as the filling in lettuce wraps.

Recipe doesn't call for any corn, although it clearly shows it in the photo. Any time that I've had Texas Caviar, it has corn in. Otherwise the ingredients look good.
Might want to update the recipe to include the corn.

Terrific recipe!  I make this weekly and my hubby says I'm addicted.  The great thing is you can vary it and it STILL comes out great.  I like to add canned corn too after I lightly char it in a frying pan w/ a bit of butter.

Great recipe. Great as a dip with chips ( or Fritios scoops) or served with grilled chicken or flank steak.
I start wih one can each black beans and black-eye peas, rinsed well. From there I add in sliced fresh grape tomatoes , 1 ear fresh corn, half a diced red onion, one seeded and diced japelono pepper and half of a diced green or red pepper. For the dressing I follow the recipie as written except for  adding a  bit more S&P, cumin and about a half tablespoon of balsamic vinegar.

We had never tried black-eye peas, and I heard they were a New Year's Day necessity for 'good luck'.  Made this salad up in the morning so it had all day to meld.  The flavors blend well together.  It would be great to use with tortilla chips, but we ate it as a side salad to go along with pork and sauerkraut.

This is a nice alternative to a more tomato-centric salsa, and a nice change of pace.  It's good scooped up with chips, used to top tacos or nachos, or scooped onto a bed of greens as a cold salad.  I usually dice up an avocado and throw that in, if it's going to be eaten in one sitting by a large group (avocado will brown if it sits too long, even with the acidic vinegar and spices). I have also done it with one can of black beans, one can of blackeyed peas, and it's good either way.  As with most Tex-Mex-ish things, I've found it to be worth the additional effort to grind fresh cumin from seeds if you have a mortar/pestle or molcajete. The difference in flavor is stunning.

Classic Texas Caviar Haiku: "I should've made more! I bet leftovers are GREAT, alas it's all gone!" Had a spontaneous BBQ and made this as written (served w/ Tostitos Scoops), and while I've made varied recipes of Texas Caviar in the past, this one blows them all away. I watched as 4 and 5 year olds, and 30 and 40 year olds alike dug into the bowl w/ delight, afterwards demanding the recipe. I can only imagine how could it would taste the longer that it sits in the fridge, so next time I'll be sure to make a larger batch!

Oh boy was this addicting. Served it with tortilla chips. I did make some changes. I used fresh tomatoes, cut the recipe in half, added avocados and kept the dressing amount the same. Very, very good! A keeper.

It was good, but a little soupy = Olive Oil overkill.  Would loved to have more "green" in it because it did not look as appetizing as the picture here.  It was mildly spicy.

I don't care for black-eye-peas so I use blace beans.  I also add 1 can of shoe peg corn drained.
Adjust the seasoning as needed.  I also like to use fresh red and yellow grape tomatoes halved instead of canned.  I am going to a fish fry on Thursday and will bring this dish to serve as a side.

Love this recipe!  After making it several times as written, I now add fresh corn and sub a can of black beans instead of black eyed.   I also use a can of Rotel instead of diced toms (undrained), and drain it all the next day.  The recipe is wonderful as is, and can be modified to what you have on hand or to your preference.

This is a good recipe! I've made it as is and also with some additions such as corn avocado, pinto beans. I have decreased the oil to 2 tablespoons. I've added with shredded pork loin over tortilla chips and served as a nacho platter. I make some form of this once a week!

I now live in West Africa and brought this to a potluck where I was the only American among people from all over, and we were supposed to bring  a dish from our country.  It was a hit and was the first dish all gone. Used the local hot pepper and cooked the buckeyed peas in a a pressure cooker because I couldn't find any canned.  Found tortilla chips in a French supermarket in a small bag  for an outrageous price.  All worth it.  Yum!

Very good!  I've made it tonight so that the flavors can meld before serving it the first thing after midnight=New Year 2019!  There will be good luck waiting for all who savor this Texas Caviar!  Ironically, this is very similar to a recipe I make called Black Bean Salad.  The main difference being black eyes peas instead.  I would make this again, primarily on New Year's Eve.  I plan to serve it to my guests with blue corn tortilla chips.

Yum, Yum, Yum. Quick and easy and so darned good.  I followed the recipe but did reduce the oil (used 3T canola) and red wine vinegar (4T).  Oops, and since I didn't have any jalapenoes, I used a can of Rotel with green chilies.

Excellent idea, but I used lime juice instead of vinegar and did not use oil or cumin. Opted for black beans, black-eyed peas, Ro-tel, onion, jalapeño and fresh garlic. Easy to adapt recipe to what is available and personal taste. Best way to eat black-eyed peas on January 1st!

This is a fave everywhere I take it!!! It's one of the most requested recipes when I leave any gathering and have brought this. Only thing I add is a can of shoepeg or white sweet corn. I serve with Scoops (one bag of corn and one bag of multi-grain chips)

Made this recipe without changing a thing and it was the hit of our Memorial Day barbeque!  Definitely make it a few hours ahead of serving time so that the flavors develop.  Even the guests who had never had black eyed peas loved it!

My family isn't crazy about black beans so we use pinto, leave out the bell pepper and add a can of corn to stretch it and it's a winner for us.

Delicious!  Exactly what I was looking for to duplicate a dish by the same name that I had eaten before.  I did use 1 can black beans,  1 can black eyed peas, 1 can corn, and 1 can Rotel, all drained.  Then I added about 3/4 c. of fresh cherry tomatoes, quartered.  I thought the dressing was a little vinegary, so added a touch of sugar to cut.  Overall, I was very pleased!

Brought this to work for a Labor Day luncheon. Everyone devoured it! Have to confess I used what I had in the pantry, 1 can kidney beans, 1 can black beans, 1/2 can diced green chilies and some lime juice  along with other ingredients.It's pretty adaptable to what you have. Served with multigrain scoops chips.

Delicious! I substituted 1 can of black beans for one of the black eyed peas, added 1/3 bag of frozen corn, and added 1/2 red bell pepper. I did not use all the dressing. I definitely will make this again!

Try roasting corn on the cob on your BBQ and decobbing.  Great way to use left over corn.   Cumin and fresh cilantro a must with a little lime juice. A touch of smoked paprika really gives a true cowboy fling.  Not too much though.

I used a can of rotel so there was my jalapeno a also used red kidney beans instead. I wanted a more meaty bean and it was delicious. My teenage son is an athlete and this high protein snack was perfect.

I have made this so many times. It's gobbled up every time.  Great share @ a gathering. Makes a lot. I always add lime juice. I do use 1 can of corn, black eyed peas, black beans instead of 2 cans of black eyed peas.  Make it!!

I've made this 10+ times, each time a little different depending on what I have on hand. Today's version has a can of black beans and one of black eyed peas. Other times it might be garbanzo beans instead. I use about 1/2 of the small cans of jalapeno slices (diced up) instead of the fresh jalapeno. And I always add about 1/2 cup of frozen corn kernels (they quickly thaw while marinating). Great recipe!

Big hit with my husband and our dinner guests. Not so much with me. I reduced oil to 3 T and vinegar to 4 T. Did not add cilantro (personal preference). Diced tomatoes were a bit mushy; next time will use fresh tomatoes with seeds removed. Will make again! SusanKathleen

Seasonings are perfect!  Also try using a can of black beans (drained and rinsed) and a can of no-sugar-added corn (drained) in place of the peas.  Excellent!

The only change I make is that I don't use the can of tomatoes.  I chop a fresh one in there or leave it out.  Plus, parsley seems to be more of a crowd pleaser than cilantro, so I often sub that.  This is very good!!

You can make this a lot easier by skipping all the wine vinegar, oil and spices and just using Italian dressing. I leave out the cilantro and hot peppers, because I don't like hot things.

This was WAY better than I thought it was going to be (I'm not a fan of legumes in general) -- took it to a New Year's party, followed the recipe exactly, and it was gone by midnight. If making for a smaller bunch, I would cut the recipe in half -- it doesn't seem to keep well in the refrigerator (becomes runny).

This is the first time I've eaten Texas Caviar.  My grandmother told me I need to make this to celebrate the New Year, so I did.  Very yummy!  I might keep the seeds in the peppers next time, to add a little more pica.

Good basic recipe. Added 4 cans cans of black beans, 2 cans white corn, and 2 cans yellow corn to make a much bigger batch. Doubled the dressing & seasoning. Added 10 chopped roma tomatoes instead of canned. Also used 1 whole green and 1 whole yellow pepper. YUM!

This recipe is a huge hit at family gatherings. I follow it exactly but I also add the juice of one lime to give it a fresh citrus flavor, which was suggested to me by my sister-in-law who shared the recipe with me. It is perfect.

My family loves this.  My 7 year old likes to take it in her lunch instead of a sandwich.
