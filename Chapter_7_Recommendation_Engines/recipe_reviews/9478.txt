Fantastic!! The only thing I did differently was to immediately spread them on wax or parchment paper to cool.  Very easy to remove later on.  Thanks for the recipe - sending to relatives and guests during the Christmas Season.

These are wonderful! The only complaint I have is that these should be placed on paper towels after baking.  My pan was a mess because I let them cool on the pan.

These nuts require a "taste" for them. I served them at a party this holiday season. Some people loved them and some hated them. Not really a kid friendly recipe.

I made these nuts and jarred them for Christmas. My Grandpa loved them and squirrelled them away! He brought them out occasionally to share "one or two" with my Grandma and then he'd hide them again! With just a slight bit of sweetness to them, they are very yummy!

I make these nuts every year at Christmas since my Mom gave me the recipe about 5 years ago and we all really like them!  They are too hard to resist if they are in front of you!  I make them for family and friends and they all really like them too!  I agree, they should be put on parchment paper after cooking to cool.  I wouldn't suggest paper towel though.  I tried that once and they stuck to it.

I did not like these at all.  There are much better recipe options for sweetened nuts.

These taste good but WOW, that's a lot of butter. I think it could easily be cut back to 2 or 3 Tbsp. and still do the job. I used almonds, walnuts, and pecans. The pecans were so coated with the mixture that they were unrecognizable. I may make these again with modifications, possibly adding some cinnamon for more flavor.

This is the best candied nut recipe I've ever found.  I changed it to nothing but almonds and serve them to friends and family.  I will try to send some as gifts this year.

Nice snack! Sounds like alot of butter but it all gets absorbed in baking and didn't seem too buttery after cooling. Might try cutting down on butter next time but will have to be careful.

These are good, but too much butter.  I had to put them on paper towels to absorb it.

My Mom makes these nuts every year. Hers calls for 5 cups of walnuts (or pecans). I feel this may help the greasiness issue some people are having. Or at least try with 4-4 1/2 cups. 

I stir mine about every 5 minutes to prevent burning. And I cool on aluminum foil.
