This cake is tasty and moist... but it doesn't taste like red velvet at all. I didn't use food coloring since the batter was bright red, but when it baked up, it turned brown (like chocolate). I think if I made this again, I'd add a little more cocoa powder and call it a chocolate cake. Also, how sweet your beets are will determine how sweet the cake is, so taste the batter and adjust the sugar accordingly.

I absolutely loved this cake. Will make it again soon. 
I hate using too much food coloring. It is a very delicious and healthier alternative.

The beets give it a very deep red coloring. This is a very moist and not to sweet tasting cake. I like it best without the icing. I made the sheet cake but would like to try a Bundt and sprinkle confectioners sugar over it in lieu of the icing.

Made this recipe twice. Without food colouring, both times it came out a brown colour and I found there was little to no flavour . The first time I thought maybe I did something wrong, second time it was the same. I  Will be scrapping this recipe and looking for another

Very moist cake! Love using the beets as a "secret ingredient" for moisture. I decided to leave out the food coloring to make it more natural- it was a gorgeous deep magenta batter and cooked up brown- guess I missed the other review that said that happened! I will make again and use the coloring to make it red for Valentine's Day, and might try it without the cocoa to see how that turns out.
