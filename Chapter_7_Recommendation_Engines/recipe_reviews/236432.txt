I had a 1.25 lbs of some cheap hickory smoked ham steak and a family to feed. I found this and it looked good. To flush out the the recipe, since I had more than double of the amount of ham the recipe asked for, I added 1 tbs of honey, 1/4 cup of pineapple juice, and a dash of ground cloves to imitate those flavors I remembered getting as a kid eating ham at a church dinner. It turned out perfect and my family asked me to add this to my repertoire.

I tried this and it came out very good. I cut the brown sugar back by half and only used enough butter to create a thin sheen on the pan. very quick and good. I served with roasted okra,tomatos and onions.

Simple and delicious! I melted the butter in a sauce pan and added brown sugar. I grilled the steak and basted it with the brown sugar butter mixture. My husband said make this again. A keeper for sure! Served it with bacon swiss scalloped potatoes.

I have been making brown sugar ham for years and I just use a little olive oil in the pan, brown the steak sprinkle with brown sugar, turn it over allowing the brown sugar to melt into the ham steak and sprinkle a little more brown sugar if needed.  I don't measure, just use what I need.  My husband loves this, but I don't care for sweet meat, but make it for him once in while.

Did it with a full 1/2" thick ham steak,  but added a little some sliced pineapples and about 2 Tbsp of juice to the butter and 1 Tbsp of Dijon mustard to the  brown sugar mix.  Turned out great!

I too make this all the time!  It is a quick weeknight meal. I brown the ham in a little butter then I mix a little yellow mustard with the brown sugar. I baste the ham and then flip so both sides are coated and continue cooking until it caramelizes on the ham.  Yum!

I have been doing ham like this for years. I usually do smaller pieces and serve with eggs for breakfast. 
I always add ground cloves. No need to measure, just sprinkle on to your taste. Makes this even more delicious.  I do not measure the brown sugar or  butter either. This is so easy,  enough butter to cover the bottom of the skillet, sugar taste and sprinkle on the cloves. You cannot miss! The longer it cooks it will start to caramelize. Add a little butter if you think it needs some as it cooks. Take it out when you like the doneness. 
Make a little extra (like bacon), you will want to sample a piece. Yum! :)

After reading the reviews I also added mustard and sliced pineapple with some of the pineapple juice.  Prepared it just like it said.  Served it with scalloped potatoes and peas and carrots.  This was awesome!  So easy and the kitchen smelled wonderful while I was cooking it.  The slices of pineapple caramelized with the ham and it was heavenly.  Husband loved it.  Will definitely make it again!  Thanks for sharing...

Great recipe! I used a grillpan and made the glaze in a seperate pan. I cooked each side for 3 minutes and then started to glaze with each flip. I flipped each side one to two more times ... no more than a total of 5 minutes. The ham was still tender.

This was really good and economical.  I used a ham steak that was over a pound and found that the amount of butter and brown sugar was too much.  There was a lot left in the pan that went to waste.  Plan to make again but cut down on butter and sugar.  We ate this with eggs which went very well together.

This was very easy and fast to make.  I added a tsp of Dijon mustard as one reviewer suggested because it sounded like it would be too sweet. It wasn't too sweet, and I don't think the Dijon made a big difference.  I will decrease the butter next time because it really isn't all needed.  It caramelized nicely.  I'll be making this again when I feel like something different. It's a keeper.

Since I'm cooking only for 2, I cut the brown sugar and butter down to 3 tablespoons of each and only used half of a huge ham steak. This recipe is so easy and super delicious! My husband went back for seconds, which he never does!!

This was really just to sweet for me, especially for a small 8oz piece of ham.  I would recommend reducing the butter and sugar by half & adding in mustard or honey to create more of a glaze than a Carmel sauce.

this was very good and a quick meal. I found that the amount of butter and brown sugar was a bit much, and think maybe, as someone else stated, that melting the butter and brown sugar together in a sauce pan and then basting may have been easier. This will be a keeper.

I used half the sugar and butter with a spoonful of Dijon mustard, judging by a few of the reviewers recommendations.  I think I will follow the actual recipe to the tee next time.  I want it to be sweeter than it turned out.  Will submit another comment when I cook it again!

It was delicious and simple...everyone liked it. It did make a mess to clean up in the pan though. I’ve never done a glazed bacon before, but now I will have to try that as well after enjoying this!

I had ham steak in the freezer and didn't know what to do with it so here I am. This recipe wasn't bad, the flavor was good. I did add honey and boiled the ham in the glaze. I'll use the leftovers in eggs for tomorrow's breakfast

Delicious. But my brown sugar got crunchy during last step. Perhaps my heat was too high- but I thought it was low enough.

This was a very easy and tasty recipe. With there only being my husband and I left at home, we get to have the taste of a baked ham, but without the expense and leftovers of a whole ham.

Just perfect for our Easter dinner, coupled with baby carrots and a Southern style green bean and potato dish ala All Recipes. My family has shrunk considerably. An entire glazed ham - even 1/2 of one - would feed us for a month, with all of us tiring of it no matter how good. This recipe was just enough for the three of us with a bit left over for snitching.;) And it was every bit as good as a regular ham would have been without near the work and mess.  Hooray.

This recipe is so easy yet so delicious.  The only thing I did different was to add about 1/4 c. of pineapple juice and then cubed pineapple chunks in the final 5-7 minutes of cooking.  The ham was so moist and tasty, & the pineapple chunks added even more deliciousness.  Served with baked potatoes, roasted zucchini, & garden tomatoes.  This meal was easy, inexpensive, & delicious.  : ) My kind of meal!

Was like a ham steak in caramel sauce; not that special or really worth making again. I prefer a sauce with more punch; more spices or blends of flavors.

We also love this quick easy recipe that can be tweaked to your taste. An addition I make is to sauté apple slices with the ham until soft. Then follow the directions as stated. all of the flavors blend nicely.

Came out great, will definitely do this again. I usually find ham steaks too salty, but it's all we had in the house so I figured why not. Glad I did!

Nice easy way to add flavor to an otherwise "ordinary ham steak".  Had it with green beans and mashed potatoes and it made a delicious lunch the next day.

Decided to try this instead of the orange juice - maple syrup glaze. Followed the very simple directions exactly. Glaze turned into an almost hard candy shell. Have no clue why but I won't be trying this again.

Over cooked for my taste.  I found the end result to be too dry.  Starting out with a fully cooked ham steak, it only needs to be heated.  I would suggest skipping step one and cooking less time in step two.  I was able to save this by serving with my ham sauce.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Made the recipe as instructed. The only addition was adding 1/4 cup pineapple juice to the brown sugar and butter.  My teen who normally dislikes ham steak loved it!

This was SO good. I've never made ham steaks before, and when I went to check my freezer for a pork roast, this is what I grabbed. A quick trip to All Recipes and this was the first recipe I tried. The family loved it so much, and it's just so easy. It is now on my "quick fix" dinner rotation!

Maybe I measured something wrong, but next time I'll use less butter or more brown sugar, so the result is a bit thicker.  Loved the taste and ease of preparation.  Just missed 5 Stars!

First time making Thanksgiving solo, and my father asked for (wouldn't you know) the ones thing I don't know how to make. Pork of any sort is really my weakness haha! He's a hell of a picky eater so to find that this was such a crowd pleaser with him and the rest of the visiting family was AMAZING. Definitely a worthy meal and going in the recipe box.

I love this recipe because it's nice and makes for tasty leftover that I like to use for collard greens.  Some days I just use the basic recipe that the author posted here, other times I use a bit of apple cider vinegar on the ham, then coat it with a mix of brown sugar and cloves.  I know it sounds odd but it's a really nice and zesty dish.

I am a hamaholic and this was pure deliciousness. I fixed a 1 lb ham steak and split it between the 2 of us, a 1/4 lb serving would have been a tease. We had scrambled eggs and home made buttered biscuits to along with the ham, talk about pure Southern comfort this was it.

Ok this way but with my family recipe additions I prefer it.  Add powdered Keens or English mustard powder to your heat tolerance one half tsp is my preference and a splash of cider vinegar to taste like 1to2 tsps for 2 servings adjust depending on how much glaze you are making and how many ham portions you are doing of course. I like a bit of clove taste...3 whole cloves sweated into the  to the glaze mix on low and remove them or a pinch of ground cloves to taste.  Cuts the sweet but leaves it savoury flavour. Try this way for more punch tho Mom used the way you wrote it or just honey on her ham steaks when sauteing them.
