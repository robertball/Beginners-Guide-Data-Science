Man did this bring back memories.  My dad used to make this for us when i was a little girl.  This is one of the best comfort foods.  We too ate it on toasted white bread and had plain chips and RC Cola.  Thank you for making me take time for a wonderful memory.

To make three smallish servings, I used 4 slices of bologna, around 3 TBS of mayo and around 2 TBS of dill relish (we prefer it to sweet). I ground the bologna up in a mini-chopper, and then added the rest and pulsed until it was blended. It only chilled for around 40 minutes, but yummy! We had something similar to this growing up. I call them Spammiches: You mash or grind up a can of Spam (we used Prem up in Canada), add relish and mayo or Miracle Whip and mix well. You pile/spread the mix on hamburger buns, top with a slice of cheese, and broil in the oven until the cheese is melted. SOOOOO excellent, I love them to this day. Thanks for the reminder, Diane! And your recipe is excellent too! :)

I haven't had this since I was a kid when my mom used to make it. I don't remember her adding the corn syrup so I left that out and it wasn't missed as the relish added just enough sweetness. I also threw in some minced onion. Hubby was a happy boy, but the kids wouldn't go near it! Thanks Diane!

I tried this recipe for the first time today. Unlike many of the other reviewers, I nor my husband had ever even heard of this stuff prior to finding this recipe here.  Out of sheer curiosity, we opted to give it a shot.
Well, my husband loved this spread and has asked me to make it regularly!
just a few tips:  I used a slab of beef baloney from the deli (buy it by the pound, only ask them not to slice it).  And rather than using my food processor, I  used a potato-masher, and it came out just right! 
I also reduced the mayo by about half, and added a pinch of both onion and garlic powders, plus a dash of pepper blend to the mix. Served on soft, warm  toasted rolls, this stuff was really good.

My mom made something like this. She used ring bologna, sweet pickles, onions and green pepper all ground together and used miracle whip and mustard to mix. I LOVED this. Thanks for reminding me ...I gotta get me some of this again

This was very tasty. Good choice for little kids. I usually fry bologna but this is another way to have lunch in a fun way. Great with crackers too! Thanks Diane.

This is an awesome spread.  My mom made it for years.  I have made it with  dill pickles or sweet pickles.  I have used leftover ham.  If you use a sweeter type ham like spiral sliced use sweet pickles.  If I use dill pickles I add roasted garlic.  I always add salt, pepper onion powder and garlic powder.  I always use mayo but I know people that use miracle whip.  It's personal preference.  It's really good if you add shredded cheese and make a grilled sandwich.
