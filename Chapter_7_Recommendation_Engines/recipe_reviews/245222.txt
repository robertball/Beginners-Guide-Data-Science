My icing sugar ended up melting and burning to the cookies because of how long I had to leave them in the oven for.

Did not look like the picture. Maybe I should gave dusted them with icing sugar when they came out of the oven. Taste great. But I would make them again.

Kept the cookies on the small size so they would cook in 8 minutes. Turned out perfect.

No issues here,  good cookies.  As for having to leave them in too long,  make sure the oven is well and preheated and make the cookies smaller so to cook faster
