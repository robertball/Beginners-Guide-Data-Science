INCREDIBLE! I used jlg83's advice and decreased the oil to 2 Tablespoons and the recipe was so good! I can't imagine using more than 1-2 Tablespoons of oil.  I also omitted the pecans to decrease the calories. I ended up with enough marinade for more than 2 lbs. of asparagus. Also, next time I will follow the microwave directions for blanching the asparagus using the "Microwave Asparagus Salad" recipe. It ends up with a quick and easy clean-up. I didn't think I would like the soy sauce and I was right, I LOVED IT!! UPDATE: Used the leftover marinate with steamed brussel sprouts and loved it! Cooked the asparagus, chilled it overnight and served it the next day. Steamed brussel srouts using the Birds Eye steam packs in the microwave and added to the marinade. Let sit overnight and it was so GOOD!! WILL MAKE AGAIN!

I made this as a side dish at a grill out. Awesome!  We couldn't stop picking at it and the dish was gone, even though it made alot. I did not add as much oil as it called for, and I think next time I'll try seasame oil.  Also I would recommend plunging the asparagus in cold water after steaming to retain the bright green color.

One word: Yum! I made slight changes/still great. Since the previous posters all thought it had more than enough oil I used 2Tb too. Since the soy gives it an Oriental flair I used sesame oil....and for same reason I used rice wine vinegar instead of cider vinegar.

I made this recipe for a friend's 60th birthday party and got rave reviews.  It was easy to make, looked great on the serving plate, and tasted wonderful. I increased the serving size to 30 and still had no problems.  I'll make it again and again--for friends and family.

My ex-boyfriend's mom always made this for Christmas. It tastes amazing! I got the recipe from her last year. The recipe she used only calls for about 2 tablespoons of oil, which would make it healthier. We also used white sugar instead, but I'm sure brown would be good. I can't wait to make this again!

Yum!  I made these for Easter lunch this year and they were a hit.  I was worried as I was preparing them because the marinade had a very strong aroma (not bad, just strong).  My worries were unfounded because the end result was a delicious side dish that I was able to make ahead of time.

This recipe is five star all around - easy, delicious,and made ahead of time.  All of my guests loved it.  The asparagus looked beautiful on the platter, and would also be picnic friendly.  The only change I made was to reduce the oil to 1/3 cup, although 1/4 cup would have been enough.

This is delicious, and very easy to make.  Perfect for a make-ahead dish for a picnic or potluck.  Uses ingredients you already have on hand.  I used Sesame oil also, and it gave the asparagus a wonderful flavor.

This was okay, not something to rave about, especially the nasty baked on mess it left on my stove top as it simmered. I myself thought the taste was okay, but my husband and kids begged to differ. The marinade is pretty strong in the spears if you don't drain enough.

This is DELICIOUS and a great option for a cold vegetable, I plan on making it for Thanksgiving.  The pecans are a wonderful addition!! I followed advice to reduce oil and plunge asparagus in cold water.   Thank you!!

The marinade is terrific! I made it all and only needed half so I used the rest as salad dressing. It's GREAT on salad and I'm definately going to make it as a dressing again! As for the original recipe...it was amazing too and I know I'll make it again! I also took the oil down to 2 tablespoons :)

I used 2 Tbsp olive oil and added the lemon zest to the marinade. I also put the asparagus into cold water after cooking. They were bright green and yummy!

I served this at my reception last weekend and everyone loved it!  I may have cooked the asparagus too long initially, because I wanted it to be crisper, but it was still really good!

Even after cutting back on the soy, the flavor was just too strong for me.  My vegetable crazy parents did not finish these so I think they weren't their favorite either.

Very good! Half the dressing and you will have plenty (no sense in draining away twice as much). I found this just a little heavy on the soy and oil, but otherwise delicious! The toasted pecans are a great touch. Thanks for the recipe!

Made this for an arts benefit and it disappeared in the wink of an eye amidst all the pasta salads and raw vegetable trays! A real hit--used 3 bunches of asparagus, lite soy sauce, only 1/2 cup sesame oil, 2/3 cup rice vinegar and added some powdered ginger to add oriental flavor. Don't leave out the pecans; they add crunch and protein. Very tasty and portable dish!

Update: I took this to the Buckeye Bash and it is so carefree to transport. This time I decreased the oil to 3T as many suggested and liked it even better. I also used white Balsamic and toasted almond slivers. //Loved this! So easy to make and nice to have prepared ahead of time for a BBQ. I used pine nuts and it was received quite well. Very good and will be making this again.
