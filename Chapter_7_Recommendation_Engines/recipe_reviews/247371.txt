7.31.16   My mother always put garlic slices in her pork roast, and it adds incredible flavor particularly in a boneless pork loin.  The mushrooms were a nice touch and enhanced the gravy.  There are times when you just want  comfort food, and this pork roast definitely scratched my itch!.  Thanks, Bren, for sharing your recipe.

Quick and easy, very tasty, the gravy is even better the next day, we also rubbed the pork down with the same spices, we will definitely make this again.

Excellent combination.  I did double the seasoning.  My family likes garlic. I also rubbed some of the seasoning on the loin.  I received rave reviews from my son and his date.  Thanks for the recipe. Will definitely be making it again.

Delicious, a great way to serve a pork loin. Only thing i did was use fresh herbs. Have made this a few times and it is my go to pork loin recipe. Love the flavors.
Thank you Bren for a great recipe.
Made this for the Jan.2018 Clean East Challenge.
It is Delicious and would recommend it highly.

I made this last night and it was delicious. Very tasty and moist. Didn't have chicken broth so used beef, and lots of mushrooms. Definitely will make this again.

My new favorite pork roast recipe. I doubled the garlic, (garlic fan) and that made for spectacular flavor. Used red wine instead of white, it gave the sauce a deep brown color which added to its appeal. Also doubled the mushrooms, and glad I did! My family, kids included, asked for seconds. The sauce was the best part, but the roast was a close second.

This makes a delicious gravy.  I used a 1 1/2 lb roast and kept the rest of the ingredients the same as the recipe, except for the garlic which I omitted

I served it with sour cream on the side which turned  it into a fabulous pork stroganoff for those who opted to add it!!!!!

Easy once you get past all the different steps & wording. I used others suggestion & rubbed the spices on the roast which I think brought out flavor more than just mixed in with the mushrooms. I baked the loin at 350 for about 75 min & it was very juicy, but cooked more than we would usually do.  When I took the meat thermometer to the meat it was up to 160 & still rising. Next time I'll bake at 350 for an hour and see how that is. If the directions weren't so wordy where I wouldn't lose my place in what I was doing the recipe would've probably gotten a 5 star. Now I've underlined the "need to do" things so I can follow it better.

I would cook it for 30 minutes and then check the temp.  50 minutes is to long

This is a very good recipe which I am considering to move to my holiday folder! It is simple yet very worth to prepare for special occasions. I did change the order or the steps but did not change the recipe ingredients at all!  Will make it again hands down!

Was really good and fairly simple.   Gravy came out delicious as well.    Had to cook meat a bit longer then suggested but once it was finished it was tender and flavorful.

This is a perfect recipe as is!  The only thing I changed is I used regular cremini mushrooms since it's what I had. This recipe is going going straight into my favourites box, it's the one I'll use from now on.
