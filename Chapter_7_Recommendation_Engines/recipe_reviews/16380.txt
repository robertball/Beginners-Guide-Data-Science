This was super easy. I did not care for it. I felt the meat was a little tough while some of the potatoes were not cooked through. The taste was ok. I won't make again.I used the london broil, maybe it works better with other cuts of meat.

My whole family loves this recipe, even my 5yr old..and he doesn't like most meats.  I make this the same way, except I cut the salad dressing in half and use my crock pot to cook it.  Never had tough meat, and the potatoes are always done.

I found that 1 hr was not enough cooking time (potatoes were uncooked and meat was tough.)  I added another 45 minutes and the casserole was great.  Meat became tender and potatoes finished.  My family liked it.  (I also used large potatoes.  This feeds alot of people.)

Takes much longer to prepare and cook than what the recipe calls for.  Taste was pretty good- a little sweet.

This meal was less than great.  I followed the directions and it came out bland.  We added butter the first night for flavor.  The second night, we added rice.  The third and final night, we added beef stock and a few other spices and made a stew.

I really didn't care for this. The flavor was ok but because it had to cook for almost 2 hours to get the potatos cooked it got really dried out. I would make it again and maybe cook the potatos beforehand. I would also carmelize the onions beforehand. I'm going to try that.

I thought this was very good.  I think it would of been better with a stewing meat instead of the london broil.  I had to cook it for 2 hours to get the meat and potatoes softer.  After I browned the meat, I used a 1/4 c beef broth to scrape up the brown bits in the frying pan and then threw in the onions for a few minutes and then put them on top the meat.  A lot of flavor in those browned bits!  I had to add some caesar dressing to my vinaigrette to get 16ozs and it still had great flavor.  I would make this again.

This was a decent recipe.  I halved the salad dressing as suggested by others but I found it to be blander than I expected.  Next time I will marinate the meat in the dressing as well and add some garlic.

It takes a longer than 15 to prep this recipe, but it is worth the extre time.  The whole family like even my finky teenager.  I did make one change however, I cut the amount of salad dressing in half.  It works better that way.

Wow - this just tickeled my taste buds - we loved it. On advise from other reviewers I increased my time to 1 1/2 hrs., it probably should have gone to two hours. Next time I will use my slow cooker. I didn't have red wine & vinegar salad dressing but I did have two pkgs of Good Seasons Italian dressing mix. I made it with burgundy in place of the water, red wine vinegar, and used olive oil.  It smelled wonderful cooking and I loved what the salad dressing did to the flavor. This will definitely appear on my table agin.

This receipe is so easy and delicious.  I used 1/2 bottle salad dressing.  I cooked it for 2 hours so that it was real tender. I also thickened the juice for gravy.

We found this tasty.  I only made half the recipe, I diced the potatoes as other reviewers said the potatoes didn't cook in the alloted time and I found that was a big help.  I also used a raspberry vinegrette dressing because that is what I had and it came out flavorful.

1 star if you follow recipe. I made this because I had the meat and was impressed by the short cooking time. Well, the cooking time is way too short (should have read the reviews FIRST). Also agree too much dressing is called for. Thank goodness the meat was on sale and I was able to make it edible by cooking another hour and adding salt for flavor and also starch to thicken the "gravy"

Made this the other night and the family loved it. I followed the recipe mostly how it is written, except I used 10 ounces of the dressing instead in the 16. I didn't want it to be too intense. I also added in a pinch of garlic, some salt, and pepper when I cooked the meat. It turned out really good. Prep is pretty easy. Great recipe. Thanks for sharing with us.

I thinly sliced a flat iron steak and marinated in half the salad dressing overnight.  After browning meat, layered with onions, green beans, and sliced carrots.  Topped with cubed left over baked potatoes and poured some more salad dressing over.  This was an easy and tastey meal, but next time I will make my own red wine dressing due to it being a little too oily.

Something is missing from the recipe, I agree with the other reviewer, meat was too tough and dressing taste permeated the meal.  Not very yummy.

I tried this in the crock pot and cut the dressing down by half.  It turned out quite well but next time might try throwing in some more seasonings for a little more flavor.

I substituted red peppers for green and made the salad dressing myself with lots and lots of garlic.  I also melted a little provolone cheese on it at the very end.  It was rich, but really good!

This was not too great.  Everything tasted like salad dressing, and the meat was tough.  Not worth the time it took to cook it.
