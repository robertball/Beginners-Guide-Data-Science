I made these when I used to do daycare. The cookie the recipe is referring to is Nutter Butters. The white chocolate or chips with cocoa butter melts and tastes best. I have never quite melted white chocolate as long as directed, though, but keep an eye on it because it burns quicker than other chocolates. I also add a tsp. of vegetable oil, or so after it is melted, to help with coating. Then, refridgerate the finished cookies to harden. The kids really liked these.

This is a cute use of the cookies. 
I haven't done the ghosts yet, but did this several times making snowmen with the Nutter Butter cookies. I used white chocolate coating that you can buy at any store, and for the snowmen, used mini M&M's for buttons.  Cute, and they always get eaten!

This is a great recipe!  Very fun, easy to do, and kids get sooo excited when they see them.  Here is a helpful hint in response to some of the negative comments; instead of miniature white choc chips, use white "coating" choc chips.  They are designed for recipes like this and, unlike white choc chips, they do not contain cocoa butter which makes them much easier to work with.  Hope this helps.

I made these. My brother in law is allergic to nuts. So I used E.l. Fudge cookies instead. A big hit at the Halloween party. Will make again.

I made the snowmen several years and served them to adults.  What a hit they were.  A little time consuming but lots of fun in the end.  I believe I'll try the ghosts and serve them to adults also.  
No tweeking, just folow the directions.

Every year I make White Chocolate Nutter Butters for Christmas, 1st time I came to Allrecipes to see if there was a recipe posted and this is what I found, while the themed name is for Halloween, it still follows the idea of sense with the ingredients, with extra embellishments of sorts to use for the Christmas theme. It is a favorite for my kids, family and friends and I will continue to every year. TY

Very cute idea.  Used reg size choc chips and they worked just fine.  Did half white and then colored the rest with an oil based orange coloring.  My 6 year old had fun placing all the eyes.  Will likely make again for Halloween although the flavor is just average- more of just a cute thing to do.

This is such a cute idea but it really didn't work very well for me.  The white chocolate never got to dipping consistency.  I tried twice, once in microwave, which turned it hard before it ever got soft and again, and once on the stove where it got to a thick spreading consistency (which doesn't work well) but never dipping.

These were a big hit at my teenage son's Halloween party. I didn't have mini chocolate chips so I used black frosting for the eyes. The white chocolate was hard to dip so I ended up smoothing it on with a knife which was a little messy but worked okay.

Cute idea.  Relatively easy to make.  Somewhat messy to  coat in chocolate.  The chocolate coating over the peanut butter cookie makes this concoction almost too sweet for me.  Made them for my nephews (ages 8, 6 and 4).  They loved them.  Had orange icing on hand since I was making the AR Witches Hat recipe and used it.  Actually, it gave the "ghosts" and eerie almost ethereal  look which I liked quite a bit.

I loved it mostly because of it's simplicity.  It is difficult to dip with such a thick base (which gives it a super-rich taste) so I would be tempted to add a little thinner to the chocolate next time.  I also wondered if strictly oval cookies would work as well since the indentations from the hour glass cookies get covered by the chocolate anyway (particularly if peanut butter is not your thing).  I will make it again with those changes.

Have used this method for snowmen, ghosts, reindeer (break a couple pretzels and press into coating - red mini candy for nose) and it's always a hit. I also use about 1 T. shortening in the white coating, and I use a shish kabob or skewer to dip. That helps with any filled cookie - slide into the filling and dip for better coverage of the coating.
