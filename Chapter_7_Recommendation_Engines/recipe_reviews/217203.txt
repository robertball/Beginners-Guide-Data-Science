This was ok, nothing to rave about.  I just happened to have all the ingredients on hand and made today.  I was a bit hesitant to try something with cottage cheese vs. ricotta and a white sauce with chicken bullion/milk mixture instead of all milk and the cream cheese though sounds great didn't work.  It had an ok flavor.  Next time I will do the standard white sauce with parmesan and not cream cheese and do a traditional ricotta cheese filling.  The zucchini concept is great, carrots are always wonderful too and if one isn't crazy about zucchini you could easily substitute that with spinach.

I used low fat cottage cheese and fat free cream cheese and this still turned out delicious.  I bet it would be even better with richer cheeses in it, but I was trying to cut some of the calories.  I very much liked this recipe, it was different from other vegetable lasagnas I have made.  The best part is my veggie-disliking hubby said this was good.  That makes it 5 stars in my book!

Don't boil the lasagne noodles before using them.  The recipe turns out firm and perfect that way.  Cuts down on prep time also!

This was very tasty! It was a bit saucy/watery when served.  I only used two bouillon cubes and omitted the salt in the sauce and it still came out great! I also used dry basil instead of fresh and no onions. I love the sauce!!! I would definitely make this again.
