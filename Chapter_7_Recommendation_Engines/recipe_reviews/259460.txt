Fabulous .. I didn't have enough cheese so I added an extra egg and I used my favorite turkey peppered bacon. Yes rolling them is time consuming so I tried them in three different shapes.. per recipe, in a waffle iron and baked in mini muffin tins.  The ones  baked per recipe... maybe a few minutes longer came out nice with a nice crunch. The ones in the waffle iron came out darker, had a crunch bit didn't have the nice  firm center of yumminess.. just crust. The ones baked in mini muffin tins taste just like the rolled ones to me.. with less hassle.   You can see the rolled ones in the red dish in my photo and the blue dish held the ones baked in mini tins.  Since I dont have little ones who care what they are shaped like, I'll use the mini tin since it is less work for me... I will make these again for sure

These were very good. I liked the combination of the bacon and the ranch dressing. I did not dip them in anything because I thought the flavors were just right.

I enjoyed it and it was simple enough to make. My husband didn't care for it but he ate it (which is a win). They were a little crusty on the outside.  Could've been my less-than-reliable oven.  I might make again and try it on my grandsons.

Hint:  Mix it all up and put it in a ziplock bag. Cut the tip so you can use it like  a pastry bag and squirt the tots out to the desired size. Much easier and tidier than forming balls. Delicious but crumbly.  The ranch dressing powder really gives is a special flavour. I'm going to have to find some way to make them less crumbly. They fell apart and were difficult to eat. But still delicious eaten with a spoon.

These were excellent! They are a bit time consuming but still excellent. As the recipe submitter mentions, the key is in step 4. You've really got to get as much moisture out of the broccoli as you possible can. If you think you've got most all of it out but then end up with more than you thought, you'll just need to add some extra panko. Again, these are excellent and good way to get the kiddos to eat broccoli.
