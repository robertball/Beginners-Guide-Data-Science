I have made this many times over the last couple years and never left feedback. This is the best tres leches cake. 

My hubby if from Michoacan and for our son's baptism we went to my sister inlaws home 7 hours away and ordered one from up there. My husband stood up in the middle of the party and appologized to the guests for the cake that was ordered because as he said " my wife makes it way better" but in spanish.

And as for the feedback that if you don't have or us a stand mixer you aren't a real baker BS. I have baked for years and this cake has been don 3 times a year for about two years now and alway turned out great with a hand mixer. This will be the first year i use my stand mixer. Remember not everyone can afford a $400 piece of equipment. That does not make them any less of a baker. Just s less fortunate one.

I just served this cake and received high compliments!  I have tried 6 different recipes for this cake and the 7th time was a charm.  Trust me, I've had many different types of this cake and the reviews vary.  I used one less egg and added a tbs of rum to the milk mixture.  It also helps to let the cake sit overnight.  It had the correct consistency and was not a nasty "wet" cake.  Use the freshest ingredients and the cake is perfect.

For all the bad ratings out there on this recipe, I wonder if the people were cooking instead of baking.  There is a difference, and those that know it know what I'm talking about.  When the recipe calls for the butter to be at room temperature, that's what it needs to be at, or otherwise bad things can happen.  Creaming the butter and sugar is an important step, one that can't be done by a half minute of the hand beater, rather it should be done in a stand mixer until it is light and fluffy, like the recipe calls for.  The only substitution I made was to use cake flour instead of all purpose, due to the fact that cake flour has less protein and gluten, making it able to be lighter and fluffier than all-purpose, which is better for crusty breads and other yeast risen baked goods.  That being said, this was an incredible cake that had all my guests raving.  Follow the recipe exactly as it says, use the proper baking utensils, (If you do a lot of baking, you already have a Kitchen Aid stand mixer.  If you don't, you don't bake much.) and enjoy!

This is EASILY the worst Tres Leches recipe I have ever tried. The cake is nowhere near firm enough to support the milk mixture without becoming soggy. You might as well put a store bought yellow cake mix in a bowl of milk.  In addition, the timings are not even close to being correct. The cake won't even have set by the time it gets to 30 minutes.

On the good site, this recipe is what finally got me to register for this site. I really wish I had read some of these reviews before wasted my money on this. 

NOTE: If you have tried this recipe, you STILL don't know whether you like Tres Leches because you still have never TRIED Tres Leches. This is DEFINITELY not it.

I followed the steps exactly and I still ended up with a very heavy, eggy cake.  I got the comment that it tasted like a quiche.

I have had tres leches before and I absolutely love it, but this recipe didn't seem to give the right directions.  I thought that i was doing what the recipe said to do, but it ended up comming out very heavy- almolt like a custard.  That is not how tres leches is supposed to taste. For all the work it required, it seemed like a waste.

***I took this cake to a Cinco de Mayo party.  Everybody loved it.  I thought it was a little time consuming and difficult to make for a novice baker.  However, the tres leches "sauce" was incredible.  I had trouble getting the center of my cake to cook.  I cooked it so long that the outside edges became hard.  Overall I gave it 3 stars.

This is not a good recipe for this cake. The frosting is fine, this is usually how I make the frosting for tres leches because it is quick but use  BIANCAS CAKE RECIPE.

It was awsome. Not too sweet, just perfect. everybody loved it. Easy to do. Best to pour the liquid the same day. I did the cake the night before and pour the liquid and put it in the fridge and couldn't turn it the next day. Had to put hot pads over it.

I found this cake to be a wonderful, true Tres Leches cake, I really don't know what people are complaining about.  Follow the recipe...room temp butter, and be sure and gently fold in the eggs.  The only variation I made was that I used 3 eggs, not 9. My cake didn't taste like eggs at all and it made a perfect sponge cake.  This cake does take more like 45 minutes baking time.  It was not set at 30 minutes (maybe due to the difference in fewer eggs).  I baked the cake in a springform pan and cut into two layers.  (Be sure and knife around the edges before removing pan) I put each layer in its own pan then I added the milk the first day and let the cake sit in the frig soaking up milk until the 2nd day.  It is hard to remove the layers this way but I was able to slide and stack the two cakes with a spatula.  I put whipped cream filling and strawberries between the two layers, and it came out beautifully!  I didn't use this icing, I used the one on Allrecipes titled Whipped Cream Filling, only I tripled the conf sugar to get it sweet. That recipe uses gelatin to stabilize the icing so it will last longer.  The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because of the baking time, the eggs need reducing, and the icing recipe isn't stable or sweet.  I needed my cake to be good for a few days in the frig and the icing in this recipe will break down faster.  BTW, I don't have a stand mixer either and I have been baking for YEARS!

I have made this quite a few times, it does take time and patience and yes it is best if done a day early.  I have never had a problem with this recipe, I will admit that my Viking mixer does make it a bit easier but have done it with a hand mixer also.  Just remember to have everything ready and at room temp. butter and for eggs so they beat fluffy.  Don't be in a rush for this one.

I'm not sure what the others that rated this recipe might have done or tried before but...everyone I've made this for raves about it. The friends that introduced me to it at work...everyone raved about it. It cake does have an "eggy" taste and I've made it with 8 eggs instead of 9-seemed to make difference in rise or texture and tasted less eggy. Making this cake is deffinately an art-you really have to take care with folding in the egg whites. Baking time is an estimate for every oven-just let it cook a bit longer, until it sets, usually 40-45 minutes for me. Other than those things, it does not taste like a "boxed Cake" my friend tried it that way and we HATED, well not really but definately not the same taste or texture!

This is the worst Tres Leches I've ever had.  It doesn't taste like tres leches or have the consistency of tres leches.  I made it twice thinking I had done something wrong the first time. But it wasn't me, it was definately the recipe.  I think it has too many egg yolks.  I'm not sure.

The base recipe is excellent.  We have always bought this cake from a mexican bakery for about $50 so it is great to find a recipe for a fraction of the cost. You have to know what to expect to enjoy this cake it is traditional to Hispanic culture.  I cut the sugar and sweetened condensed milk in half and substituted unsweetned coconut milk. PERFECT! The coconut milk is a perfect addition giving the cake a slightly nutty flavor. The cake is definatley too sweet.  I recommend adding sugar slowly to taste instead of the exact amount.

This cake was too dense, cheesecake-like, had too many eggs to be spongy, the worst tres leches I have tried, and I agree with half of the negative reviews made for this. The author probably has never tried the REALLY good tres leches before (and only tried the mediocre ones), that is why she believes this is the best. But....I love the 3 milk ingredients that are supposed to soak up with the cake, because I didn't have to follow this recipe for it. I made my own.

This was a wonderful desert!  I added some crushed pineapples to the top and it was even better.  I would think mandarin oranges or another citris would be good as well.
Thanks Marti for this delicious cake.

The milk sauce is yummy.  However, the cake itself is too dense and eggy for a true tres leches.  Good flavor, but not quite what I was hoping for.

Whoever said you have to use a stand mixer was right. I used mine to make the batter, transfered it to a different bowl, then used the mixer to make the egg whites peak. I followed the directions exactly. This cake is so delicious! If I ordered it for dessert at a restaurant I would not be disappointed. Thanks!

Marti,

I think there are two main problems with your recipe:

1.  Too many eggs: 9 eggs will tend to weigh the cake batter so much that you end up with an eggy hard cake

2.  There needs to be at least two 14-oz cans of condensed milk otherwise you taste the evaporated milk too much which results in a raw rather than sweet taste

I am from Nicaragua (the place where this cake originated) and I can tell this recipe is not it.

This cake was really good, but it didn't soak up the milk mixture very well and that made it very messy.

My roommates usually do all the cooking.  I decided to try this dessert as an "end of the year treat".  They LOVED it!  I tried a tres leches dessert at a popular Mexican food restaraunt and this recipe ranks right up there with theirs.

No sour grapes here, because it is always fun to try out a new recipe, but this version of Tres Leches did not work for me.  I felt that this cake became too dense, and "cheeselike", after adding the milk mixture.  I ended up, cutting the cake into tiny cubes, putting it into goblets, with a little raspberry jam, toasted almonds, and whipped cream, to recycle it into a sort of "tres leches trifle".

I tried this for my family and the cake tasted very good. The only problem is that it wasn't sponge cake... it was more like pound cake. I'm going to try this recipe one more time in the oven I'm used to, and we'll see how it goes!!!

I made this cake for Mother's Day, and took it over to my boyfriend's family's house. I followed the recipe exactly, hoping that the cake would not be dense, as I'd read in other reviews. Well... it was dense. It fell as soon as I took it out of the oven. The frosting and milk combination was delicious and spot on, but if you choose to use this recipe, find a different recipe for the sponge cake.

This was fantastic, a desert you need to make for company, otherwise you will eat the whole thing. However the reviews posted here made it work!  I used 8 yolks and 8 whites, creamed the softened butter in my Stand mixer, made sure ALL the ingredients were room temperature, and baked for 50 minutes!  I also topped with cool whip... it was delicious.  I made this twice (first time as a test second, time for company) and it was PERFECT each time.

this is the second time I've made this cake. I've done it very carefully, mind you, because the first time it didn't cook in 30 minutes; it was runny and I had a time limit. This time, it's been sitting in the oven for about 50 minutes already and it is nearly done. This must be about equipment because I am positive I have done nothing wrong...

REMEMBER TO SOFTEN YOUR BUTTER.  Try putting it in a plastic tupperware and beating it with something flat, such as one of your measuring cups.  Stir it until it is soft, then gradually add the sugar.  stir until FLUFFY.  Then add the other ingredients listed, MIX WITH A FORK, and as soon as it's all together in the same bowl, begin whipping it to smooth it out.  MAKE SURE IT IS A SMOOTH BATTER before you put it in the oven.  About the milks, stir them SLOWLY and GENTLY with a SPOON.  Trust me, it's much simpler.

As an addition, I substituted the Cream of Tartar with 1 teaspoon evaporated milk and about 1/4 teaspoon baking powder, and I baked two smaller cakes out of this much batter.  They both turned out wonderfully.

This is the very best Tres Leches cake recipe I have seen so far.

I certainly don't understand the bad reviews for this recipe, and I really don't get how some people ended up with a cheesecake consistency.  The key step is folding in the egg whites...that is what incorporates air into the batter to make it nice and fluffy.  I had no problems with this, and it turned out just fine for me.  I did use cake flour though, so I recommend it for anyone planning to make it.

PEOPLE--YOU NEED A KITCHEN AID MIXER TO MAKE THIS CAKE.  And use the wisk attachment for EVERYTHING.  When i alternate the flour milk mixture, i just keep the mixer pumping and i add them alternately.  The whipped topping, i suggest putting the bowl into the freezer for a while and add then i whip the topping WITHOUT sugar.  i fold the sugar in with a spatula.  This is the ONLY recipe i will ever use and thank you :)

This cake is awesome!  It's very easy to make and it's delicious.  I made it for a function at work.  Everyone was sort of wondering about it.  Once one slice was served, everyone wanted a piece.  In fact, someone said they would have paid for a slice at a restaurant.  This will become my go to dessert to take.  It's a little messy to travel with the milk, so it would be better to be in a dish that has a lid.  I whipped the cream for the top right before we served it so it would be nice and fresh.  Delicious and quite a hit!

My cake was a little dense too.  The milk didn't soak in well.  It tended to go down the sides and under the cake.  I probably did something wrong.  I'll try it again as it did taste very good.  Maybe use something bigger than a fork for hole poking would help.  I substituted a can of dulce de leche by nestle for the plain sweetened condensed milk.  It was great with that change.  just a little different flavor for us dulce de leche lovers.

I agree with Charisse 100%.
This is the worst Tres Leches I ever had. It's not spongy at all. It really looks like an insipid cheescake.
I'm frustrated because instead of reading the reviews after my first try, I simply assumed I did something wrong and repeated 4 times to have the same result. Too bad. Now I'll try to contact Charisse to ask her for a real Tres Leches recipe.

30 minutes is not enough to cook this cake.  I cooked it long enough so I could stick a toothpick in and it would come out clean  The cake came out very eggy.  THis recipe uses way to many eggs. It was not spongy at all.

I'm sorry to say this, but I will stick to making cream puffs and eclair cakes, this recipe was time consuming all the effort I put into it, and afterwards the cake was hard and heavy like a rock,did not obsorve the milk, I threw away the whole cake, because no one like it.  This recipe in a one star for me.

After tasting this cake at a Mexican Restuarant here in Texas, my hispanic friend insisted that I make it for her Easter gathering.  Being quite the baker, and having baked many cakes before, the crowd raved over this cake and proclaimed that I had outdone myself and that it was the best cake I'd made yet!

This is an excellent cake and sorry that it was not a success for a lot of you.   Unfortunately, for this type of cake, you require time and patience and cannot be made in a hurry.   Instructions need to be followed exactly and the result of all your labors is worth it.  As to the controversy between hand mixers and standing ones I have used both and it can be made with a hand mixer successfully - just requires more time and patience.

My daughter and I made this as a project for her Spanish class.  I have only ever had Tres Leches at a restaraunt before and this seemed very yummy to me!  It definitely tastes better the next day after the milks have had time to soak in.  I was dense and a tiny bit eggy but it seemed to work.  I might try a different recipe next time just to experiment but I am saving this one in my recipe box!

Did not like this recipe at all.  The cake was very dense and I could really taste the egg (lots of them!).  Plus, it was time consuming to make.  Won't be making this recipe again.

At this time I am only giving this recipe a 3star. I had the same problem with it not baking in the center and it is extrememly dense and eggy. I am going to try it again, and will re-rate at that time. I used cake flour as well instead of all purpose for the same reasons. Trial and error I say. I love Tres Leches so I will keep making it until it comes out right!!!

I attempted this recipe for my friend's fiance's birthday...what an embarrasment! The milk didn't seem to absorb into the cake, it was so runny! I guess making it overnight might have been a better move.  I followed everything stated in the recipe, but I did increase the baking time.  I don't know where I went wrong.  It was dripping in my car, dripping on my way up to her apartment, it was a total mess! After reading all these reviews, i'll give it another try.  Thank goodness someone bought a Carvel cake!

This is the worst recipe for any cake I have ever made. I bake all the time. There are so many eggs in the cake, they sink to the bottom of the pan while cooking leaving the top half of the cake nearly perfect and fluffy and the bottom half very hard and dense. Not suitable at all for serving. I'm moving on.

Recently I was in Manuel Antonio, Costa Rica, where I had some really great Tres Leches cake ar a tapas restaurant. My felow diners all agreed that it was outstanding. Upon my return, I just had to try and recreate this gem. I used this recipe and brought the cake to a friend's home where it was met with raves of approval (one of the guests is the manager of a very upscale banquet facility and she asked for the recipe). I was just invited back for Easter dinner and have been asked to bring the Tres Leches cake. I agree with other posters that "unless you have a Kitchen Aid, you're not really a baker" is just absurd. (I do have one and love it, but managed pretty well before I got it. Being a photographer, I should have taken a shot of the first one...I will next week. This is an excellent recipe, thank you for sharing it.

This recipe FAILS! You need a convection oven AND an electric mixer to even come close. I've wasted my time twice with this recipe. Tastes like an omlette, I call it the failure cake.

Loved this.  I used cake flour, took my time beating the ingredients, used 1/2 teaspoon of cocounut flavoring and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla.  Also, I poked wholes in the top of the cake with a cooking fork.  It was delicious!  The cake is heavy and moist and wonderful!!!!

After reading all the reviews (positive and negative), I decided to make this cake anyway.  Well, I'm sorry I did!  The cake ended up VERY dense and I was very disappointed (especially since I  planned to serve it at a New Year's dinner).  I decided to leave it for the birds...they'll need something heavy to eat to hold them thru the winter. I gave it 1 start for the sauce...very good.

This cake was very dense and in no way light.  My son loves Tres Leches cake, but we will keep hunting for a better recipe.  This one was not a keeper.

I think it's weird that there are so many conflicting reviews on this recipe. I suppose those who don't like it aren't making it correctly... It turned out great for me, although I did have to bake it longer than 30 minutes. It isn't that time consuming either, if you plan the steps right.  Also, my boyfriend suggested we put a little holiday spin on it, so we added 2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice to the batter before folding in the egg whites, and substituted egg nog for the evaporated milk in the 3 milk mixture. SO RICH! But so yummy!

Made this today, according to the recipe.  The resulting cake was denser than I like, perhaps a result of using butter in the batter.  The Tres Leches recipe on this site submitted by Monica is a straight forward sponge cake. Once the milk is absorbed, this cake has a wonderful texture.  Using coconut milk instead ofsweetened condensed milk can add a nice flavor variation.

This cake came out too dense (too many egg yolks required for this recipe). The cake didn't absorb the liquid as well. The cake tasted fine on its own, but it did not work out as well as other Tres Leches cakes I have tried.

This cake is delicious! I pay $25.00 for a cake that tastes exactly the same at a local Mexican store. I make this for my family and they loved it. I also made it for my ESL (English as a Second Language) students, they all asked for the recipe. I am going to use this recipe for Birthday cakes from now on!   Thank you Marti!

My first cake. My previously skeptical wife declared it to be the best cake she's ever eaten (I'm not about to disagree with her on this) - better even than her Lady Baltimore Cake. It does seem to be a heart attack on wheels but some things are worth the danger.

I'm giving this recipe four starts rather than three because of the popularity at our office food day. Everyone loved it. 


My cake came out very dense.  It rose nicely, but fell when it cooled.  I decreased the eggs to 8.  Not sure if I over-folded my whites into the batter. This made it difficult for the milks to absorb.  (I used a 15 oz can of evap milk. Have not seen a 5 oz can) 


BUT, the cake was very delicious.  And I did use my KitchenAid with the whisk attachment. :)  I'll try again maybe with this recipe, maybe with another...

Tres Leches is one of my favorite desserts. I tried making this recipe while in Quito,Ecuador at 9,300 feet. It didn't come out as well as I had hoped it would, but it was my first attempt at Tres Leches. I look forward to trying it again when I get back home at 5,200 feet. I'll let you know how it comes aout at a lower altitude.

I made this a day and a half ahead of time.  I was told it was so rich and good.  I personally do not like milk so not a good judge. Three or 4 days later, I took the remainder to my husband's office and they loved it also. I followed the recipe exactly as it is written.  The only difference was that I waited until the next morning to pour on the whipped cream and sugar mixture. I was told it was good, but really rich.

A really good cake. A little bit more dense than I am used to(and I know how to bake), but not too dense to be bad. Excellent taste. I even cut the egg yolks down to 8 and yes you do have to increase the baking time to 50 minutes.

I must be a glotton for punishment...I have tried to make this 3 times now. First time i had a very eggy cake. Second time I followed directions to a T. Third time, the "outside" edges were perfect, but the middle tasted like an omlet again. So, i will just leave this one to the professionals!

I haven't made the cake and so I feel I don't have the right to really rate it, but I wanted to comment on the recipe itself because tres leches cake ... the kind made in it's country of origin, Nicaragua, is never made with a butter cake.  It's a type of sponge cake frosted with meringue.  So, if you are having trouble with this cake, try it with a sponge cake recipe and see if that doesn't solve the problem of it being too dense.  Again, I have not tried this particular recipe, so blow this off if you have and love it.  I just thought I'd add that it's usually sponge cake.

this recipe is the best around for tres leches!  i did tweak it just a bit.  i baked it for 50 min. and where is says to add 5 oz. of evaporated milk, i added 15 oz. (one can).  make sure you are patient when you make this cake and that you wont be pressed for time!  especially when you are adding in the flour/milk. also, don't "over fold" your egg whites into the batter, streaks of white are okay! excellent recipe! i suggest serving with fresh raspberries!

Cake was like mush...tooooo much liquid.  If you cut down on the liquid you add on top of cooked cake it would probably be good.

It was not as good as I had hoped it would be.  It was also a bit too "egg-y".

My boyfriend is mexican and could not believe that I made this cake. He said it was better than the one sold at our local mexican food store. All his coworkers were pretty impressed too, especially when they found out a white girl made it!!

This is the best tres leche cake recipe!  I've been making this cake for almost 12 years.  It takes a lot of effort but it's worth not taking short cuts.  I hate when I order tres leches cakes in restaurants and the cake is a soggy mess.  This cake is thick and moist and a total compliment to the sauce and whipped cream.

I took another reviewer's suggestion to cut back by one egg, but I still had issues with baking time and milk absorption. I had to leave it in the oven for about an hour! By that point, the top had become a very dark brown and had to be cut off so that the cake would actually absorb the milk mixture. I only used about half the milk mixture before it stopped absorbing, but the cake wasn't as moist as it should be. I think next time, I'll try to solve this surface area limitation issue by halving the recipe entirely, still cooking it in a 9x13 pan, so that it may actually finish cooking at the 25 minute mark and absorb more of the milk mixture.
