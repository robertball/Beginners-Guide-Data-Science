It is a very good cookie to cut out and quick to bake. but i did find out something you kneed to sift the flour then measure it my dough was stick and i didn't have enough flour in the mixture.  Other than that it is a good cookie and easy to do.

Wonderful recipe!  My grandma made a similar recipe with buttermilk.  This one is much more moist and tender.  I used a cookie scoop so they took less time to cook.  Around 6 minutes.  Also just used sanding sugars instead of cinnamon and sugar.  Very good and yes cakelike.  when I was a kid we called these type of cookies sugar cakes! Very yummy indeed!!!

This is one of the first cookies I made when I started baking as a young girl. It has been a tradition for Christmas every year. I have now passed it on to my daughter. I add a tsp of Nutmeg for an little added touch. My all time favorite.

So happy to have found this recipe!  My mom used to make these for me when I was a kid.  We called them Sour Cream Softies.  The recipe appeared back in 1970 in an issue of Family Circle.  The cinnamon-sugar is really what makes the cookie here.  As other reviewers have said, this cookie is soft and "cake-like" but that's why they're called SOFT sugar cookies.  The dough is very sticky, but we always just kept in the refrigerator, and then formed it into balls and placed them on the cookie sheet... worked like a charm!

Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.  It brought back so many happy memories of baking with my mom.

This was very good.  Not a crispy or chewy sugar cookie.  It was dense and soft- exactly what the title states.  I substituted 1 CUP plain yogurt for the sourcream and the recipe turned out fine.  These cookies would make a perfect combination with mocha frosting to make a "whoopie pie" type sandwich cookie.

I have made this cookie twice now. Both times it has come out like a cake instead of a cookie. I followed the recipe very closely. I don't think it tastes like a sugar cookie at all. The dough was great tasting but I think I'm going to make it into a cake and frost it.

These are very cakey cookies.  I added 1/2 t of almond extract and 1/2 t of vanilla and I'm glad I did because they would've been bland without it.  I was looking for a cookie recipe to use up some sour cream which is why I made these but I doubt that I'd make them again.

I love these cookies, you can vary them and add cocoa, molasses, or even cinn/sugar and make snickerdoodles. My children love them. Not all cookies have to be chewy/firm or crunchy to be cookies. Sometimes they can be cakey. It's good to be different.

Not a huge fan of this cookie but that may be my personal bias. It was really soft but not in a good way. I was expecting a cakey cookie, not crunchy but not like this. It was almost like eating a cookie inmitating to be cake...I think it may have been the sour cream and I did use reduced fat so that may have had something to do with it. I will not make these again

Sorry, but definitely not a keeper recipe. I would classify this cookie as a "sinker". Just made these last night because I'm trying to find a recipe that is similar to my Grandmother's sugar cookies.  Was sadly mistaken.  These cookies are more like biscuits than cookies - bland and dense. In working with the dough, it was extremely sticky while trying to spoon onto cookie sheets even though I had refrigerated it for a few hours. Secondly, you absolutely MUST spray the cookie pans or else be prepared to scrub pans.  After the first bland batch, I increased the amount of cinnamon/sugar toping by 3X's.  That at least helped to sweeten it up a bit. Was surprised at how bland these cookies taste once baked since the raw dough was decent to taste.  If you do try to bake these, you may want to add another layer of flavor like almond or maple.  Back to looking for a sugar cookie recipe that is closer to the awesome flavor of my Grandma's. Am happy to accept recipe suggestions!

I followed the recipe precisely and found the dough extremely sticky and difficult to work with.  Next time, I'll follow the suggestion to refrigerate and then roll into a ball.  Basic cookie, but tasty.

Would not give this to anyone!  Made two batches, the first came out plain, so the second batch I added nutmeg, did nothing to help. The cookie was springy almost like a spounge and had almost as much flavor as one... This tastes nothing like a sugar cookie, new or old fashioned.

very good.  Mine turned out round and puffy, but still dense like a cookie.  Would be really good with a cream cheese frosting. Will make again!

Definitely a keeper!!  This is a great, simple cookie.  It is cakey, which I like  I used margarine, didn't have butter, and they still worked!!  I think I might try and ice some next time.  Oh, definitely sift the dry ingredients together.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I got this receipe many, many years ago from my husband's aunt (kind of a "welcome to the family"!), only she adds chocolate chips to hers. I've never had them without chips, but I bet this helps make them taste a little less like a pancake and more like a cookie.  These are absolutely my husband and daughter's favorite cookie- I know I'll earn big points when I pull this recipe out!!

I followed the directions down to the t,using a professional kitchen aid mixer.I was expecting a soft sugar cookie, instead what I got was a sugary pancake, a good pancake but frosting a pancake not what I planned on doing with my God son.

I would never make these again. I have never had to throw away cookie batter before, but the batter was not cookie dough consistency. It was like pancake batter. If you added more flour, it just tasted like dough, not cookie.

This is not a 4 star recipe.  My cookies came out of the oven very thick, and had the texture and taste of pancakes. They also did not round out very well and did not look at all apealling.  Now I am grumpy because I made these to send to a friend as a gift, and i will have to start again.

Perfect. But recognize that these cookies are very cake-like and don't spread much. They cook up fluffy! I didn't sugar/ice/glaze mine at all. Yummy with milk!

Very easy dough to make and bake.  No rolling involved or needed.  They also stayed quite puffy and cake-like.  These were very sweet, almost too sweet, especially when my plan was to frost them.  I would reduce the sugar by 1/4 to 1/2 cup if I was to make these again.

I make these cookies every year for the Holidays and a few times through out the year.  Instead of cinnamon and sugar on top I sprinkle with colored sugar for a holiday look.

I didn't have any sour cream so I increased the butter by 1/4 cup and added a couple drops of milk until the dough wasn't dry.  I rolled the cookies into 1 inch balls and they came out perfectly round.  They were a little puffy but tasted great!

The recipe was easy to follow and they tasted great (not too sweet).  My only concern is the texture... they came out too fluffy and cake-like for my liking.  Also they are nothing specieal to look at, little bumpy domes of cake.  Overall, this is a good start to a great recipe... I will try to tweak the ingredients just a bit.  Thanks!

This is good if you want a light and fluffy sugar cookie.  I didn't like it though.  It was too airy.  They didn't round out well in the oven (I wouldn't give them to anyone looking like they did).  Taste was okay.  Nothing fantastic.  I won't be making them again.

This is an incredible cookie.  You really need to add the cinnamon and sugar to the top, it gives it the flavor that it needs.  My kids ate every single one of them!  Since I am not good with rolled sugar cookies, this one was just perfect.

These are wonderful!  I made some variations to make them healthy.  I used unbleached flour and stevia instead of sugar (1 tsp. of stevia did the trick), and also used maple yogurt instead of sour cream since I was out of sour cream.  I then made frosting with equal parts of cream cheese and butter, mixed with stevia and honey to taste.  They turned out beautifully, and it's nice to have a soft, tasty cookie with no sugar during the holidays!

When I was a kid my Mom made wonderful sour cream cookies (as we called them) by rolling them and cutting them out (and the dough was so good to steal and eat when her back was turned).  So I had a hard time believing you could make these as a drop cookie!  I did and they were wonderful! They were fluffy, delicious and looked like Mom's and the dough was even good to eat (Disclaimer: It has raw eggs so don't try this at home kids). They did get a little clammy when stored but I think I might have used too much sour cream. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!  It will surely be used during the holidays & when I have a hankering fr it (did I say hankering?)

There are lots of kinds of sugar cookies. This is the big, thick, soft kind my mother always made.  I left out about 1/4 cup of sugar and they were plenty sweet. Beautiful texture,  The sour cream and butter give them a beautiful flavor.  We eat sugar cookies for our shortcake with strawberries.  these were perfect.  My new go to cookie.

I made these they are so soft and warm sooooooooooo good and with some home made buttercream icing i love love love them. It wasn't in the directions to refrigerate but i did for one hour prior to cooking the dough was so gooey i though it best for handling to firm up the dough a bit, look up a buttercream vanilla icing recipe to put on them promise u will fine these to be divine

This is just like a cookie that I made with my mom as a kid and had been wishing for. They are perfect for vanilla half moons. I do cut the sugar down because they are a bit too sweet for me, especially with frosting.

I didn't have sour cream so I used a 6oz container of vanilla yogurt and  2oz of sour milk (whole milk and vinegar). The cookies were amazing! Fluffy and soft like a cookie should be!

I liked these cookies, they puffed up a lot and I used the cinnamon sugar on them to sweeten them up. I realized I should have taken a picture but my friends and family ate them all up!

I bake for our city's community theatre cvoncession and I am always looking for a cookie that does not have ch9ocolate or nuts in it.  I found it in this wonderful cookie!  My husband raved...and also suggested instead of cinnamon sugar, use cocoa sugar.  I will try that especially for him.  Thank you very much f0r my new "find"!  Elizabeth

Very Good Cookie.  They bake up big and soft.  I didn't coat with the cinnamon-sugar as suggested, and I'm glad I didn't - these cookies are sweet enough with out them.  Also - I used the Splenda Baking Blend in place of the sugar (using 3/4 cup of the Splenda Baking Blend).  This is a winner.

I think I'm going to experiment with this recipe a little and then maybe it could be better. The cookies were very soft and I liked the taste but they came out almost an inch thick. I like cookies that are thinner than that so I think I'll play around with the amount of baking powder/soda in this recipe. They were almost like little cakes rather than cookies.
