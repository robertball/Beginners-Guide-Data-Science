We looked for the best Buffalo Wing experience when creating this recipe and tried many wing sauces. We found Defcon 2 Medium Sauce from Defcon Sauces online, and it was far superior to all the others we tried.  It is an award winning sauce that won't disappoint!

These were very good. I like how crispy they turned out. we used Sweet Baby's Buffalo sauce. I like the baking method!
