I think a good start to any a la vodka sauce is the pancetta. I started this recipe by browning 6 slices of pancetta without any oil and adding the sausage to the drippings, then launched into everything else. I also upped the vodka quantity to 1/4 of a cup and upped the heavy cream to 3/4 of a cup. I completely omitted the salt. I used Contadina crushed tomatos with roasted garlic. The meal was definitely "restaurant quality"

This recipe is top-notch and would rival any Penne a la Vodka that you'd order in an Italian restaurant.  I prepared it almost to the letter, and it was perfect.  I have also tried this a different way by making it a lowfat dish.  I substituted turkey sausage, and instead of heavy cream, I used half and half blended with 1 tsp. of corn starch.  It was a fantastic lower fat variation and tasted just as good as the original.

I changed this recipe. 3 tablespoons of white wine instead of vodka, added spinach, tomato sauce and extra red pepper flakes, simmered the sauce 30 minutes and melted parmesean and feta cheese.  made for a large group.  got rave reviews, tasted just like penne rosa from noodles and company!

I frequently do a sausage pasta with a fresh sauce but never occurred to me to do a vodka cream version.  Great!  My only alteration is in the pasta choice.  Pardon, but I am a particular snob in this area.  For a sauce like this one with roll-away chunks, a more appropriate pasta choice is one that snuggles the sauce - in this case I go for an egg noodle or at least the widest fettuccine you can find.  Tubed pasta work better on thinner sauces that need a little traveling compartment.

This was good although I have had better sauces but I must say I liked the addition of the sausage. It actually tasted better the next day. I would make it again. The ony thing is I reduced the oil and the salt I felt the amounts given were high.

All the signs of greatness:  Tastes really good, is fast and easy, and also pretty darn inexpensive!  I went a little easy on the crushed red pepper (it was still nice and spicy), and topped each serving with a little shredded fresh Romano.  SERIOUS YUM, especially with a glass of red wine...

I browned the sausage separately and then added it to the sauce.  For the sauce I sauteed some onion, used 1/4 c. of vodka, 1 c. of whipping cream, and added some fresh basil.  Overall, I think the sauce is better without the sausage.

My family loved this. I thought it was very similar to Bowties w/Sausage, Tomatoes & Cream (also on this site) and may consider using that recipe as my base vodka sauce.
I followed the directions pretty accurately with only a few minor changes. I put literally a drop of EVOO into the pan and browned my sausage whole. I think 2 links crumbled as written would have been lost in the sauce. I drained the oil and fat from the pan reserving about 1-1/2 Tbsp. in the pan for flavor. I cut down to 1/2 the amount of red pepper to make it more kid-friendly. I also cut back dramatically on the parsley. As I was chopping it I realized that it was a lot so I sprinkled it little by little until I got the flavor I wanted. I ended up using a little over a tbsp I would guess. My only other change was to use a little over a half pound of a variety of pastas.(finished up the boxes) I served it with grated parm and think that next time I may add it to the sauce during cooking for a much better flavor. The flavor of the dish was good but I definitely recommend increasing the vodka A LOT! You could barely taste it. Also I think I prefer my vodka sauce a bit more creamier than tomato-ey so next time I will definitely add more cream to the dish as well. Overall this was a very delicious dish and was loved by my whole family. My 22 month old went back for thirds!! It does make a lot of sauce so be prepared for extra...perfect for dipping garlic bread into.  Thank you Star!

This was wonderful and so quick and easy!!  I did drain the sausage and also added the cream after bringing the vodka to a boil (wasn't sure about cream boiling and curdling).  I only had hot italian sausage on hand, and it was great - next time I'll try the sweet!  This was very similiar to 'Rigatoni ala vodka' my husband and I used to order at a local restaurant - also good with the addition of chicken breast cooked in the sausage grease (sounds weird but tastes great).  Thanks for the recipe!!

In spite of the good reviews this recipe gets, neither DH nor I was a big fan.  Maybe we just don't like vodka sauce.  Had only had it once before (the jarred stuff from Trader Joe's), but still wasn't that enthralled with it from scratch.  I halved the amount of EVOO; used spicy Italian sausage, so halved the red pepper flakes; also halved the salt based on other reviewers' comments, and halved the amount of pasta for just two of us (still had leftovers). Used fire-roasted crushed tomatoes, and threw in a bit of prosciutto with the sausage for some additional flavor. Served with shredded parmesan and whole wheat sourdough rolls.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Star!

So easy and very tasty, this is easier to make than my usual spaghetti sauce.  Loved it and my family loved it!  This is a keeper!  I made it exactly as stated minus the parsley.

I've made this a few times now... My husband and I  LOVE it.  Made it exactly as written a few times, but lately I've modified it slighty. I now add tsp of Basil and 1/8 cup of sugar... just to add a bit of sweetness to the sauce.  I've started using 1/2 and 1/2 cream.  Tastes wonderful.  Thanks so much for sharing!

Delish! I used 1/4 C non-fat milk and 1 T low fat cream cheese instead of the cream, and it still tasted great, and cut the calories/fat down significantly.

The flavor of this sauce was outstanding. We bought some high quality vodka, and that made quite a difference. Also, we were happy to find the mini "airline" versions of the vodka so we could get good quality without spending a ton. There are a couple things I would change next time I make the sauce, though: 1. I would use more sausage. We couldn't even tell it was in there. And 2. Use tomato sauce instead of the diced tomatoes to make the sauce a little thicker, it was really thin, and for a creamier texture. But, delicious nonetheless, and we look forward to making this recipe again!

Very good for never having made it before.
Extraneous comment:  I don't know how people can rate a recipe, after changing it so much it's not the same recipe.  Especially giving it a poor rating.
Make the recipe as stated, THEN rate it.  Much better for the rest of us who rely on accurate ratings.

Yum, yum yum! I added a bit of dried oregano and rosemary, used just a sprinkle of salt, left the sausage whole (for those who didn't want any). I simmered the dish with 1/4 cup of vodka for a good 30 minutes. Added a generous splash more with the cream in step 4. This one's going into my tried & true file. Thanks, Star Pooley!

If I could give this recipe more than 5 stars I would it is the BEST! Every time I make this every one is raving and asking for the recipe.
A few tricks of the trade, use a whole pound of ground sausage (spicy ot mild to taste), 6 cloves FRESH garlic, a whole cup of whipping cream, 1/3 cup vodka, and use Delmonte 4 cheese sauce (usually 99cents in a can)
AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Try it out you will not be dissapointed.

Easy, flavorful and restaurant-quality.  Basic assembly but not so basic taste!  Easy add in to the weekly menu.  Followed instructions exactly with the exception of subbing chicken sausage for Italian sausage to save some cal/fat grams.  Was awesome for food-lover and picky-eaters alike.

This sauce was as good if not better than some I have had in restaurants. I didn't even remove the sausage from the casing..just cut it up into small discs and browned it.

This recipe was exceptionally easy, and incredibly delicious.  Rather than use italian sausage, I opted to brown boneless pork chops in 2 tbsp butter/ dash of olive oil, and allowed them to braise in the tomato sauce for approx 2 hours before I added the vodka and cream.  I know it sounds a little odd, but there is nothing better than a fork tender pork chop with spaghetti!  I also added additional garlic, onions, shredded parm cheese, and fresh basil right before serving.  5 stars!

I love this recipe. I always use more than 2 links of sausage (for 8 servings... 2 seems like way too small of an amlount!) and use hot italian sausage and then just leave out the red pepper flakes. Otherwise I do not change a thing. It is one of my favorite quick and easy recipes and it really impresses people!

This was awesome, everyone loved it, even better the next day. The only thing I would do away with was the amount of oil to cook the sausage, made it a little to greasy for me, but really good taste

I have made this MANY times, and I'm convinced this has to be the BEST Penne alla Vodka recipe on this site.  I tried another tonight and it didn't compare.

Best meal I've made yet! My boyfriend and his brother loved it and finished the leftovers the next day. The amount of olive oil does seem like it's going to be too much, but once you add the cream it all comes together perfectly so don't stress if it looks like there's going to be too much oil

This is very close to the recipe I use.I had vodka penne at a restaurant a few years ago and it was superior to any I'd had before.Really delicious.Fortunately I knew the chef and asked him what the taste was that I couldn't identify.As odd as this sounds,he dices Canadian bacon very small(about 4 oz.)You cook it in a small amt.olive oil until very brown and then proceed with the recipe as written.No other meat needed.For me,I also run the crushed tomatoes thru the food processor as I like the sauce smooth but that's individual preference.When some friends of mine come for dinner they always ask me to make this.

I have been making this dish for over 5 years exactly as stated. Oh, I've been tempted to add more sausage but haven't. I usually try these recipes as stated the first time, unless prior reviews indicate some changes would be beneficial, i.e.: way too much butter or way too much cream, etc. This is one of those I won't be tinkering with. On occasion I have forgotten to add the vodka and didn't really notice a difference. This dish is like American Chop Suey on steroids. Oh, and it's easy! 
Thank you Star Pooley!

This was an ok-sauce. It lacked a lot in the flavour department. I think next time I'll use more vodka and doctor it up a bit with more spices.

Really good! Sauteed some minced onion with the garlic and then added sausage and cooked for 5-10 minutes on medium to med-high. Then added tomato paste and rest of ingredients. (Did not have crushed tomatoes so used a can of tomato paste.) Added a tiny bit more vodka and also used half and half instead of heavy whipping cream. Added extra butter to make up for this. Used two links of polish sausage, decased and chopped up. Used dried parsley instead. Yum!

Yumminess.  Used a combination of whole wheat and "regular" pasta.  Omitted the parsley, crushed red pappers and used a little less salt (1/2 tsp).  Used sweet Italian sausage (not in links).  Even though I made quite a few changes, it was still fantastic.  Would definitely make again.

This is awesome... here is the low down on what I changed as per other people's reviews:   3/4 c. whipping cream, 1/2 c. vodka, added chopped red & yellow bell pepper, used double the amount of sausage and added sliced chicken breast.  My husband and his 2 friends ate almost the whole pan....if you want to impress...make this dish - mahalo Star!!

What's really nice for me about this recipe is that you can substitute real sausage for Morning Star vegetarian sausage.  I halved the recipe and still used a bit less oil and red pepper than suggested but the whole can of tomatoes.  Don't worry about the cream curdling, it does fine.  Tasted great but I can see using half and half instead of heavy cream to make it healthier.  Whole wheat pasta would probably work too.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was great!! I don't eat meat, so I skipped the sausage and made everything else as directed. It was just a tad spicy and the cream added a nice richness. Next time I will add a bit more crushed red pepper, just cause I like my food spicy. Great with pasta or over chicken, and super easy.

This has become a favorite in my family. Recently made it for a dinner with 10 guests, and it got rave reviews. 

I've made this several times now, and for our tastes I double the vodka and cream and a pinch extra red pepper flakes. I've used penne and spiral pasta, and prefer the spiral. 

For those who think it's a bit dry, I think that 1 pound of pasta is too much. Try 3/4 pound for a better balance. 

Thanks for the recipe, Star!

Made this recipe with two changes and it was GREAT!  My boyfriend LOVED it especially the sausage, however I'm sure it would be fantastic without the changes.  I put a total of 1lb of ground sausage and added basil, per another reviewers recommendation, it looked and tasted great.  Next time, because I'm a garlic lover, I will add more garlic.  I recommend this meal for pot luck or group gathering, makes a ton and was quick.

Update:  I've been making this regularly for 6 years!  Still an easy, delicious dish!  

Awesome, restaurant quality pasta dish!  I have made it twice.  First time as per recipe:  husband and I loved it, but too spicy for kids aged 2,4 & 7.  Made it a second time, and used only 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper, and used a full pound of Italian seasoned turkey sausage, and an extra can of tomatoes.  Kids liked it the second time.

I will absolutely make this again!

Love this recipe! Quick & easy to make. I've made it with ground beef instead of sausage and it's just as wonderful. My boyfriend has decided this is his favorite dish, and says he has a foodgasm every time he eats it!

OMG....AMAZING!  Used turkey sausage instead of italian sausage, subbed 1 can of tomato paste + 2 cans water for the crushed tomatoes, and subbed butter/milk for the whipping cream.  Still came out FABULOUS!  The fiance was raving about it all night!  We both loved the spiciness from the red pepper flakes - I'd added in about 3/4 tsp for a little extra kick.  Also added a bit of basil, garlic powder, and smidge of dried parsley vs fresh.  Would recommend this to ANYONE!

This was a terrific recipe that I pretty much followed to the letter except that I had sweet Italian turkey sausage  and used that.  The bonus was that it was probably a little lower in fat.  Wonderful flavor and the vodka gave it a very subtle boost in flavor.

Pretty sure I did everything wrong and that's why this sucked for me, so if you're trying to make this recipe vegetarian, DON'T.  Since I wasn't using sausage, I added red pepper and garlic to the crushed tomatoes.  WRONG.  Didn't have vodka either, and I hate the taste anyway (why was I attracted to this recipe?) so I figured I'd just leave it out.  Added the cream and the parsley (not fresh) and this was bland bland bland.  Ended up adding massive amounts of Parmesan (that helped a lot) and adding the sausage in the end, but I'd screwed it up too much by that point for it to be salvaged.

Great recipe!! I did however make a few changes, I used fettuccine, 8 cloves of garlic, 3/4tps of red pepper flakes, 5Tbs of vodka,1/3 cup of parsley and 1Lb. of hot Italian sausage. Obviously I like intense flavors and this recipe delivered!

I love vodka sauce but had never made it before, so I gave it 4 stars.  But it is a very simple sauce to make and can be made as is.  I hate to read a recipe and see 10 billion remakes of it, so  I won't do that.  The only little bity changes I made was dried parsley instead of fresh (even easier) and little dried basil as well.  This is an easy weeknight meal.

Excellent recipe! Super easy, I made double for a party and there was plenty! I used chicken instead of sausage, left out the red pepper flakes, turned out fantastic! Really easy and very good!

This is my favorite dinner!!! I use hot sausage because I like spicy. I use whole wheat pasta and turkey sausage to lower calories. I also add an extra link or two to the sauce. It even tastes delicious without vodka. Thanks for a WONDERFUL recipe!

We enjoyed this recipe, but it was a bit oily and I only used about half the specified amount of olive oil.  I would make this again as the flavor is good, but I would only use a tablespoon of olive oil.

My husband loved this dinner and could not stop talking about how delicious it tasted. I used 1/3 cup of Gray Goose Vodka, 1 cup of heavy whipping cream.hot Italian sausage,orange pepper(do not use green) and a package of sliced mushrooms, than the garlic... cooked in olive oil and added to the sausage. I made a salad and had crusty bread a bottle of red wine.

This was really delicious. The sausage really added a punch. Use as spicy of an Italian sausage as you can handle to add to it even more! I had no vodka on hand and made it without, and it was great anyway.  Added about a tablespoon of sugar to get rid of some of the tartness of the tomato. The penne will absorb all of the sauce, so don't mix the two if you're planning on keeping this for leftovers.

This is an awesome recipe!  You MUST simmer sauce once vodka (added 1/2 cup) has been added (30 minutes).  Also, put sauce in the blender...this thickens the sauce.

Great pasta dish. The sauce sort of tasted like a Beef Stroganoff Sauce. I used 1/2 Cup of Vodka and 3/4 Cup of Cream on my first try (As others suggested). If you have kids you might want to stay with the original amount of vodka because, although most did burn off, my friends and I still felt some of the effects afterwards (Maybe let it boil longer?). Also, I like spicy food and using the spicy sausage seemed to make it EXTRA spicy. If you like REALLY spicy food then go for it, otherwise I'd stay w/plain or sweet (as the recipe states, possibly try out the plain/sweet sausage first time and if it is not spicy enough use spicy sausage the next). It was overall easy to make for this is my fifth recipe I have actually cooked (college student) and it came out alright! So as the cliché states, "If I can do it you can do it!" Have fun!

FANTASTIC!  The flavor was great and the vodka wasn't too strong.  I added some garlic powder and oregano to give it a little more spice and also added a few red and green bell peppers.  I would suggest adding slightly more sausage than the recipe calls for if you like meat.  Thanks for the great recipe ~ my family absolutely LOVED it!!  :)

Made as written the first time and it was okay-good.  Took JDowning's advice the second time I made this and started with pancetta and upped the vodka a bit - it made a huge delicious difference!

This is a delicous tomato sauce. It is different than other sauces because the vodka brings out other flavor compounds in the tomatoes. Very simple and makes a satisfying dinner.

Excellent recipe.

I used spicy Italian sausage that was ground up (not in casing) and added extra garlic and red pepper flakes.  I also used half and half and it was just as good and lower fat than heavy cream.

I'll make it again and again! Thanks for a great recipe!

We liked this one.  My wife said next time I should double the amount of Italian sausage since 1 lb of pasta is a lot to cover for less than .5 pounds of the sausage.  But it still tasted great.

My husband and I made this for dinner tonight and it was delicious.  We did double the sauce.  We did this because the sausage came in a pack of 5 so instead of having half of the pack left over, we just went ahead and made double the recipe, using all the sausage.  Best part is we have plenty left over for lunches!  We also used mild sausage instead of sweet because that was what was at the store and took the advice of others and used 1/4 cup of vodka (or 1/2 cup since we doubled the recipe).    Really easy to make and really good as is.

This has become a family favorite!  We use 3 sausages and just boil them and slice instead of breaking them up.  Then use the same water to boil the noodles.  Also, we buy a small can of tomato sauce to help freshen up the leftovers as they can dry out a little.  Soooo delicious!

I made this using the canned tomatoes that the recipe called for, and it was TERRIBLE!!!!  However, after throwing it away, I started and over using my favorite bottle of tomatoe SAUCE and it was really GOOD!!  My recommendation: forgo the canned tomatoes and use tomato sauce.

Delicious, Simple, and Easy! Definitely a keeper. I suggest making the sauce first, then boiling the noodles while the sauce simmers. Also, it's easier just to buy ground italian sausage than get links and take the sausage out of the links.

I'm giving this the 5 star benefit of the doubt, as my husband doesn't like sausage and I had to make it without.  Because I didn't have the sausage flavor, my sauce was tasting kind of bland and I added Italian seasoning.  I also eyeballed four "glugs" of vodka and added some more cream (to use up what we had).  This made a yummy and easy peasy dinner - thanks!

I made this last night to go over my homemade ravioli and it was a HUGE hit. I only added half the pepper flakes as I was afraid of it being to spicey but next time will either had the entire amount or use Pepper vodka. This will be a staple sauce in our house!

This recipe doesn't have many seasonings and I thought it would be bland but it's anything but! It is very tasty. Once you make this there is no point in ordering it at a restaurant. Very good recipe.

I am considered by most to be a very good cook, never mess up recipes but I did not care for this. This recipe doesn't work if you prepare it as directed. Dry with absolutely no sauce. If you do double up on the sauce you'll find that this still has a really bad taste. You can try to "fix" it with other additions, but why bother. Just find a different recipe.

This was delicious!  It was even better the second day.  I mistakenly bought hot sausage - I will try the sweet sausage next time - however, the hot sausage in it was delicious!

This is an excellent "starter" recipe. You can substitute cubed chicken breast for the Italian sausage, if you'd like to go lighter. I start the water to boil at the same time I start the recipe, and everything finishes together! Oh -- and I like texture in my sauce, so I use one can of crushed tomatoes and one can of the petite diced tomatoes (the two cans adding up to about 28 oz). I also use  about 1/4 cup vodka. YUMMY!

Absolutely delicious! I made a few minor additions to enhance the flavor of the dish. Cut up a bell pepper and grape tomatoes and substituted the whipping cream for a homemade version. Will make this dish again soon very soon.

Delicious!  I halved the recipe and used 1/2 pound of bulk spicy Italian sausage.  I still added the extra red pepper flakes as I do like it hot.  I had to use cream cheese since I had no milk products except skim but that was still a wonderful addition.  Also basil instead of parsley but that was just a taste preference.  I will make this again!

This was fantastic! Even my 9 yr old that HATES anything spicy LOVED it!  I followed the recipe with some slight changes.  I put 3/4 cup cream (instead of 1/2), 3 tblsp Vodka (instead of 2), and substituted fresh basil for the parsley.  I will make this for my sister before she can claim this as her recipe find.

Loved the sauce!  Made this sauce as written other than the red pepper flakes...used 1/8 tsp of hot sauce instead.  Served it over chicken instead of sausage.  My 3 fussy kids (2, 4 & 5) gobbled it up!  Hubby loved it.  Was great with a nice glass of pino grigio.  2nd try: added some Kraft Philedelphia Herb & Garlic cream cheese melted on top of the chicken...to die for with this sauce!

Love how easy this is, so few ingredients! I sauteed a small onion before adding the sausage. Could have a used three or four suasages. I also added a whole cup of cream, more vodka and a half cup of parmesean. YUMMM.

I have made this sauce several times and did not review it because I lef out the vodka. I decided to review the recipe because it just seemed to be the best of all the tomato cream sauces on this site, a perfect balance of ingredients. The only other change I made was to use 1/2 n 1/2 instead of cream. Sorry, I have also subbed chicken and shrimp instead of the sausage.

This is such a fantastic recipe! Each time I make it, I get rave reviews and everyone asks for the recipe. The changes I make to this are: double Everything except the pasta (I like to make this and freeze it for quick meals, and the pasta absorbs the sauce)... Extra garlic, I throw in some oregano, and cut back the salt. I also throw in a little mozz and parm cheese at the end! :)

I didn't have any vodka (I'm 6 months preggo) and I omitted the red pepper (I also have a 4 y/o) and this was still amazing! Followed the rest of the recipe to a tee. Thanks so much for sharing. This one is a keeper, for sure!

Hubby really liked this so will give it good rating but I was not so keen. It was okay but nothing special in my opinion with just a tad too much tomato flavor.  Made it exactly as directed.

This was awesome!! I used turkey bacon instead for the meat and used a little more red pepper flakes, as I really like spicy food. Used creme fraiche instead of cream and it just turned out delicious; and the best part: it is quick!!!! I highly recommend this recipe.

This just sounded like it needed some dried basil for a more flavor and I'm glad I added some.   I also drained the oil before adding the tomatoes.  Yummy!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was delicious. I left off the salt (the sausage is plenty salty) and used just enough olive oil to lightly coat the pan (around the pan twice). I didn't have whipping cream so I used half and half and it worked fine. Cut way back on the red pepper flakes for the kids - just added a dash, although hubby and I would have liked more. Definitely a keeper.

I just made this and it was fantastic! My only recommendations are to add a little sugar and salt to make the mixture less bitter. I also grated parmesan cheese on top afterwards. 

Absolutely delicious, overall and well deserving of the top-of-the-heap ratings.

This was delicious! My husband loved it and my 11 year old son, who tends to be a picky eater, asked to have the leftovers in his lunch the next day!!  I made the recipe exactly as it is written, except that I used Italian flavored canned tomatoes instead of plain. Thanks for the great recipe!!

Beyond fantastic. I used the whole package of italian sausage, i used 1 4oz package diced pancetta, and I added 15oz can diced tomatoes.  I also used 1/4 cup vodka and 1/2 cup cream.  LOVED it!

This was pretty good but I can't decide if I'll make it again or not.  I followed the recipe to the letter and some bites were really good while others were just ok.  After reading the reviews I expected this to be the best pasta I'd ever eaten.  Good, but didn't blow me away.

This is probably one of my greatests recipe finds.  I used 1/2 tsp. red cayenne pepper and it was definitely too much.  The next time I used 1/4 tsp.  We like a little more sauce so I used less pasta.  The whole family loves it!

One of the best pastas I've ever made! The pasta sauce came out perfectly- the only things I changed are I used spicy Italian sausage instead of sweet and I added a little more vodka. The recipe was easy and delicious!!!

Just finished making this and devouring most. Hubby loved and I did too. The red pepper flakes give this a real kick, if you love spicy food you will love this. Oh...no crushed tomatoes at home so used rotel and tomato sauce.....and this is good and easy, not time consuming at all. Nice for dinner guests too but you have to continue lifting up sauce from the bottom...just mix it right before serving.

Very Good! I can't wait to make this again! I had some sundried tomato and garlic chicken sausage in the freezer, so I sliced those and used them instead of italian sausage. Divine!

This was great, didn't change the recipe much at all. Just added some fresh chopped spinach and a little squash to the sauce and it came out great.  Used a 1/4 cup vodka too per someone else's request.  Someone mentioned it was too much salt, that may be if the sausage you use is salty, so adjust the salt accordingly.

I made a couple minor changes - i halved the amount of garlic and substituted with two minced shallots. I also used fresh basil instead of parsley.  I used a very light turkey Italian sausage that I got at Whole Foods. Yummy!

This was really good, but I made a few changes to use what I had available. I used fresh basil rather than parsley, grilled chicken breast rather than sausage, and I sauteed some cherry tomatoes to add a fresher taste.  Used penne rigati to soak up the sauce, and topped with freshly grated parmesan cheese.  This will stay in my rotation!!

This was really good.  I added chicken instead of the sausage, fresh basil, oregano, and no parsley.  After it was finished cooking I added a small can of tomato sauce to make it a bit more creamy.

This was really fresh and yummy.  I added about half a bag of baby spinach to the sausage and allowed to wilt down to sneak in some veggies.  Turned out fantastic!

Fabulous! I took the advice of a few other reviewers and used almost a cup of cream and about 1/4 cup vodka. I used 12 oz penne instead of a pound, and I'm glad because I don't think there would have been enough sauce with a whole pound. Regardless, this is a knock 'em dead kind of recipe. I will be making it next time I have company. It's just a shame I was eating alone tonight!

I have made this delicious recipe many times.  Last time I made it I accidently used Hot Italian Sausage instead of sweet, and I only had two different kinds of canned tomatoes.  Still turned out awesome.  And super easy!!

I loved this recipe. It was really easy (especially when I cook after getting off from work). I didn't use any red pepper flakes because I did not have any and my boyfriend doesn't really like spicy food anyway. The only other thing I did was cut back on the oil and salt (i didn't think all of it was necessary) and added more vodka than it was called for. This was just great. It was even better tasting the next day. Even my boyfriend liked it and he's EXTREMELY picky with what he eats. I will definitely make this again.

This was wonderful.  What I love is that we generaly have 90% of these ingredients on hand, we just needed to buy the whipping cream, and the recipe doesn't even need the sausage if you don't have any (although i'm sure it's terrific with it).  My husband was craving a dish from one of our favorite restaurants, and this was almost a perfect match.  This might be the first thing he's cooked on his own and it turned out great...so who knows, maybe he'll surprise me more often!!  Thanks for the recipe, will be a keeper in my house.

This is an excellent recipe.  I've been looking for a good vodka tomato sauce and this is it!  I used 1/4 c. vodka and cut the sausage into chunks instead of crumbling it.   My husband was very impressed with this one too.

Very tasty. My one caution is the excessive salt. The canned tomatoes have plenty of salt in them to start with, so just add more later if needed. And it is very spicy, I'll cut the spice by half next time.  I added 1 TB. of olive oil to help brown the sausage and then I drained off the grease. Thanks for a great recipe. I give it 4 stars only because it needs an adjustment with the salt and oil.

ADD A RED ONION - trust me, you will not be sorry.  Chop a red onion very finely and sautee for about 10 minutes just after your garlic browns.  We also add about twice as much vodka and a little more whipping cream (it makes the leftovers less dry).  We skip the sausage since I'm vegetarian, but I'm sure it's good either way.  We add some fresh grated parmesan to the top as well.  This is my favorite dish I've found on allrecipes, with our changes. Try it - especially with the red onion!!!

This recipe was fantastic. I made a couple of changes per the previous viewers. I doubled the recipe for the sauce and I added 1/3 cup vodka versus the 2 tablespoons. I also added some romano cheese to the sauce to thicken it up a bit. I also think this sauce would be good with sauteed mushrooms added in. I will definitely make this one again.

GREAT RECIPE!  I did make a few changes.  I added 3/4 cup cream.  Added more red pepper flakes.  Put an entire mini absolute vodka bottle (2 shot bottle.) I added yellow and red peppers and mushrooms and sauteed them then added them in with the sausage.  I also used spicy sausage. Put a tad bit more parsley in too.  Topped it all off with some grated parmesan.  THis is a definate make again and share with others recipe.

This was very yummy.  I did change it a bit, depending on what I had in the house.  I had some bulk italian sausage, so I used that.  Next time I would break the meat up into smaller pieces, because I left them too big and they didn't "go" with how smooth the rest of the sauce was.  I used an Italian seasoning blend that included red pepper flakes, and it was just spicy enough.  I used whole wheat penne, and finally, I never have alcohol in the house, so I put in a splash of red wine vinegar instead.  It was an easy, yet elegant meal.

Made this again last night (4/4/06) and it was fabulous. I made a few changes.

1. I've used both italian sausage and turkey sausage, both great. I cook the sausage in the skillet with 'very' little oil

2. I use about 6 cloves of garlic, we love it. 

3. I ended up using like 4 tablespoons vodka and 3/4 cup cream. I think next time I'll use more vodka, I can't really taste it. 

4. I also didn't use the entire 1 lb package, I wanted all my noodles to have a good amount of sauce. I also used dried parsley flakes...I let them simmer with the tomato sauce prior to adding the cream/vodka...then sprinkled more at the end.

This is definitely a keeper, and you can always tweek it to the way you like it.

This recipe was amazing!! Due to the previous suggestions, i decreased the salt, and added in some extra sausage instead (hot sausage) and it was amazing. a definitite hit with everyone and very manageable to make. Also, the portions may be a little off- i would say that doubling the recipe would feed four without worry.

Believe it or not, this recipe is much better if the vodka is not cooked off.  Try tossing 2 tbsp each of vodka and heavy cream with pasta immediately before serving.

The sausage definitely adds a different flavor to the sauce but I like it better without.

This dish is so amazing, super easy and such a unique taste and different. It will have your guests wanting more and for the recipe. I added it to my cookbook already! Instead of whipping cream I added 4 tbs herb and garlic cream cheese. It was dandy!! Xo

It was so delicious.  I left out the parsley because I'm not a big fan of it, but I put in baby spinach which was really good.

Love this dish. BEST vodka sauce around. I've made and shared this recipe with a lot of my family. Can EASILY swap out any kind of protien, I've actually never made it with sausage (not a big fan), shrimp and chicken can also dress it up nicely!

I loved this recipe. It was flavorful and quick.  I used Trader Joe's mild italian chicken sausages which made it budget friendly too. They're $3.99!  I'll definitely make it regularly. Thanks so much!

This was a great sauce, exactly the consistency I was looking for.  I might substitute garlic powder for minced garlic next time to keep the sauce smooth.

This recipe was good when I tried it the first time, but the second time I added pancetta to it and it was GREAT. It sort of rounded the dish off. Less oil too.

Absolutely delicious! I loved the kick that the crushed red pepper added! I followed this recipe to a tee and it was perfect! No changes needed. My family couldn't get enough of it and we all agreed that it was restaurant worthy. This recipe will most definitely become a regular and a new family favorite.

Delicious! I did use a pound of sausage (hot Italian), so I omitted the red pepper flakes. Also, I used a little more than 1/4 cup of vodka and used the salt to taste. Super simple to make and very tasty...this is a keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Loved this, though for my family 1/2 t red pepper flakes was a little too much, just a little. I also added some red, yellow and orange peppers for some veggies.

Very good, easy to make, and inexpensive! I made this recipe without any changes and it came out wonderful. I used a food processor to chop the sausage for the sauce and then browned the meat a little longer with the garlic to bring out all the flavors. The texture was perfect for the sauce. I also browned a few extra links of the Italian sausage and sliced them up to use as a garnish/side. The full recipe makes a TON of food, but the leftovers are just as good as the first time around. This is definitely a repeat recipe for me!

Absolutely delicious!  I made no changes to the recipe as written.  Once the sauce is tossed with the pasta (i think a few reviewers may not have done that?) the sauce is "soaked" into the pasta.  Served family style with italian bread and a Caesar salad - awesome!  The only change I will make next time is to add another sweet sausage link.  Just our personal preference.

Wonderful! Even my pickier eaters loved this. We did double the sauce right off because we always seem to like more than most recipes cater to. We will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for sharing!  :-)

This was fantastic!  Definitely a little spicy (which I love), so if you don't like heat you should cut back on the crushed red pepper.

I used double the vodka it called for and also added some pre-cooked shrimp at the end when I added the pasta in.  I can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch today!

This wasn't really a great penne vodka recipe.  It was good if you're looking for a creamy, spicy sausage gravy, but it didn't make the cut for me in terms of penne vodka.

I followed the recipe as indicated, except I didn't have any fresh parsley.  It was good, maybe I will use less penne next time as it was a little dry for my liking (but the taste was good), I will also try using chicken instead of sweet Italian sausage.  Thanks Star Pooley for sharing your recipe!

This was amazing!  I got 12 ounces of hot Italian sausage and left the casings on, pancetta, and a red onion and sauteed all those together first before adding the crushed tomatoes.  The boyfriend loved it too and we wouldn't change a thing!

Made it to the recipe (OK I added just a twinge more sausage) and it was great. I used San Marzano crushed tomatoes. Even our picky receptionist at worked raved. Easy and quick.

2.5 stars. I'm being generous. There's no way this will be ready in 25 minutes. It took me an hour. Even if I somehow speed-cooked, 25 minutes is completely unrealistic. As for the food, it was OK. Pretty bland. So then I doubled the garlic AND the crushed red pepper. It was better but not by much. I won't make this again. Sorry.

We just made this dish 2 nights ago. It was wonderful. Rich in flavor but not over the top. Will definitely use this recipe again!

This is awsome!! I'm not a fan of sausage normally, but it adds another layer of flavor. The last time I made it I wanted to trim down the fat so I substituted fat free half & half and my husband didn't know the difference.

I needed to double the recipe, so I used five sausages, and added two 15 oz. cans of tomato SAUCE.  Everything else was doubled precisely.  I added one whole yellow onion finely chopped, which I thought gave it a more restaurant-like flavor.  I also added 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese at the same time as the cream, but that's just based on my tastes.  It came out great!

I rated 4 stars for ease of recipe. I added additional 1/8teas. salt and 3-4 tbls cream, which I felt it needed.. I also substituted chicken sausage and used 16oz to make it a richer sauce. Also, if using a "cooking version" of Vodka with a lower alc content, it needs more for flavor.

This was very good and shockingly quick and easy!  Felt like I was making a gourmet dinner in record time.  It was a little too tomatoey with the crushed tomatoes so next time may try with tomato sauce for a smoother texture, but otherwise it was delicious!  Will definately make again!

pretty good just needs more flavor, however I did substitute milk and cornstarch forcream which cuts fat as well as flavor, I would just add more spice when im making next time, and go for a spicy sausage

I took the recommendation of another reviewer and used fettucine noodles but wish I would have stuck to the penne. This was really easy and tasty, but just as a warning it did not re-heat well. I always mix the leftover sauce and noodles together for leftover pastas and typically get a decent lunch out of it, but this one not so much. I would also add more sausage next time, just a bit....

This is a great recipe.  Have done exactly as written and a little twisted at times, always with great results. Try diced tomatoes with peppers for a spicier flavor.  Try omitting the sausages and topping with some fried eggplant.  Thanks Star for adding a strong adaptable candidate to my recipe box.

It turned out delicious! I used 5 cloves garlic and less salt than it called for but still tasted a little salty. I only had diced tomatoes so used those and mashed them a little during the cooking phase. I had one sweet and one hot Italian sausage so used those and it tasted great. My husband gave it a thumbs up which means a lot because he's an excellent cook and I am not. I really love Allrecipes! Almost all of them have been great!

This was an easy and YUMMY recipe. A few things I did: I couldn't find mild Italian links so I used 1/2 lb/package of bulk Italian sausage (we like a little more meat in our pasta sauce :) ).  Also, added 1/4 cup of vodka, a little more cream, and some basil.

This one's a keeper, IMO. Thanks for sharing and thanks to a friend of mine who mentioned this recipe on Facebook. :)

This is spot on to my recipe.  I make this every year at a camping get-together with about 20 people. It's always a hit.  I used to use pancetta, but found the sausage to be an easier taste addition.  I do up the amount of vodka and cream, but it's awesome as written.  Thanks!

This is a fantastic dish. I love to make it for company. If you have a Trader Joe's in the area they have great sweet Italian sausage to use for this dish. I used fresh tomatoes instead of the crushed tomoatoes and just let them slowly simmer for a little while.

Really enjoyed this and it was very easy. I substituted chicken for the sausage and part-skim ricotta for the heavy cream. Also added some thyme and parmesan cheese on top. Yummy

So delicious!!!! Definitely 5 stars. I doubled recipe used 2 lbs sausage. Perfect. You could probably skip the red pepper and just use half hot and half mild. Made a huge family style bowl for 8. Plus leftovers!!!! Could have used even more sausage really. Thanks so much!!!!

Awesome, my husband loved it and asked to add it to the rotation!   I followed it the recipe to a T except I used tomato sauce instead of crushed tomatoes because we don't like chunky sauces, and it came out just fine.

We love spicy food, and this recipe did not disappoint.  It may be our favorite pasta sauce ever.  I added an extra 1/4 t crushed pepper flakes, and used ff 1/2 & 1/2, but other than that I followed the recipe as written, and we absolutely loved it. Very easy to make, and we'll definitely have this many times in the future,

This was amazingly good! Only subs I did were, ff half n half, and I had no parsley, only fresh basil, so I used that. We LOVED it. Next time I will add  one more link of sausage.I regularly make vodka cream sauce, but with the addition of the sausage, it moved up a notch! THANKS !!!!!

This sauce was definitely restaurant quality. I followed the recipes exactly, except I was 1/4 C soli vodka and 3/4 C cream. We mixed it with whole grain pasta. My husband absolutely raved over this one.

An outstanding pasta & sauce!! Definitely beats some other vodka sauce recipes that call for waaaay to much booze.  This one is just light enough on the vodka and the "spicy" to be good for the whole family.  Everyone loved it!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I made this for my husband on valentines day and we both loved it!  Next time I will use a little less crushed red pepper, but we still had no problem licking the pan after it was all gone!  :~)

I have eaten -- and made -- much better vodka sauces than this. This isn't terrible, but it isn't what we think of when we want pasta at my house. P.S. The vodka was undetectable, but I don't know if upping it would improve the overall situation here. This has a bland flavor suitable for little kids coupled with spicy heat unsuitable for kids. I'm not really sure what I'd change (to help future reviewers out) either, but thanks for the recipe, we always enjoy trying a new one!

This was super good and super easy!!!  Only thing different that I did was add 1/4 cup vodka and 1/2 cup cream.   So, so good.

Okay, so I've been using this recipe for probably a couple years now and I must say that it is a favorite. My husband goes crazy over it! I've made it for friends, my parents, and everyone LOVES it! This has got to be one of the best recipes I have ever made! The only thing I did different was to use hot italian sausage instead of the sweet italian. (My husband prefers spicy) Also, I used ground red pepper because I didn't have the flakes on hand (just be sure to use less if you're substituing the ground red pepper). All in all, this recipe is a hit every time!

With no vodka, only a half-can of tomato paste and a small can of stewed tomatoes and just one clove of garlic, I decided I could make this work - and it turned out wonderful! I squeezed 3 links out into chunks to make it a bit meatier for my guy, and cut the red pepper in half. (We're wimpy with hot stuff) I just added water to the rest of the can of paste to make the sauce and a dash of italian seasoning so the paste wouldn't bland everything. I can't wait to try the recipe as written (except for the pepper of course) because this had an awesome flavor. The heavy cream really does add a little somethin-somethin. I got 2 thumbs up, so you get 5 stars! Thanks.

S-I-M-P-L-I-C-I-T-Y at it's best.. Being Sicilian, I made a few changes only for our familia's likings, I used salmon instead of sausage.. I use fresh diced up, (can be used too), cook in the oil till slightly pink, make sure not to over cook, then follow recipes as directed for cooking,. I crushed fresh cherry tomatoes, and added a tad of tomato sauce,& added fresh basil, oregano,tad of parsely, followed cooking times as directed. I added more vodka (Grey Goose) than called for due to adding some sauce with the tomatoes.  served with fresh asago & parmesan.. This is just from a Italian prespective and likings... The recipes is great as is.. Well Done!!

If I could give this recipe 10 stars, I would.  This recipe is AMAZING, ... and SOOOOO easy!  I used prosciutto rather than sausage.  Huge success!  My husband LOVES Vodka Sauce and this one was no exception.  He does however love spicy foods, and the red pepper flakes were a bit too much for him, so I think I will half that the next time.  Thanks so much for a terrific recipe!!!

This is quite yummy, but I like the Penne w/ Vodka Sauce recipe from this site a bit better. I added 4oz of pancetta in with sweet turkey sausage. Also, I put the vodka in at the same time I added the garlic and red pepper (upped it to 1/4 cup). Finally I used fat free half and half instead of cream. Made the recipe MUCH healthier and thought the taste was still very good.

This was ok. I have a Vodka Sauce that I usually make that is very very similar, but I think I like it better. I liked the sausage in it since I do not normally add it, and unfortunately I can not make it spicy because of the kids. Good, but not spectacular. Update: I make this all the time now, it has turned to a five star for our family. I use a pound of sausage, and add the cayenne, the kids really like it.

This was great.  The only change I made to this was to add some tomato sauce with the vodka/cream to sweeten the base a little while keeping the tomato taste.  Will make again, but with a little less pasta, as I was full after a half serving of this.  A+ recipe.

I don't eat meat, so I skipped the sausage, and I also made the sauce without the pasta, to pour instead over portobello and asiago cheese ravioli.  It was incredible!  I used the leftovers the next night on top of a spicy cheese gnocchi - so good, we had it two nights in a row!  This sauce is really versatile and I love the spicy kick!

I make this recipe pretty much exactly as listed, other than changing the pasta to what I have on hand (fusilli, callentani, farfalle, etc.), and there are never any leftovers.  Just the right amount of spicing!

I loved this recipe, will definitely make again.  I decreased oil to 2 tbsp. and used half and half instead of whipping cream as that was what I had on hand and I increased vodka to 1/3 cup.

I like to use the 28oz cans of tomato sauce that already have basil in it. I will also dice up about three roma tomatoes with the sauce. I never add salt, there's enough of that in the canned tomato sauce, and the oil really isn't required at all - perhaps just to prevent the sausage from sticking to the skillet, if anything. During the final minutes of cooking, I'll add about a tablespoon of oregano for a little zip.

Pleasantly surprised at how good this was!  I have tried the jar vodka sauce and this was SO much better.  Pretty much followed the recipe except I accidentally opened a can of diced tom. instead of crushed so I used it and blended it with the hand blender and it turned out just fine.  I used a mini bottle of vodka and ziti instead of penne.  I will double the sauce next time because I thought it could definitley use more, I didn't even add the entire box of cooked pasta because I didn't have enough sauce.  After initially tasting thought it needed just a little something more so I added some onion and mushrooms, a sprinkle of basil, oregano and black pepper topped off with grated parm. cheese.  My husband has already requested this for an upcoming fishing trip.

This was good!!! We've never before cooked w/vodka, but this turned otu nice! I was hesitant about the pepper flakes, since I like a little spice, but not too much, so I just sprinkled some in. I felt like it was lacking in flavor though so next time I will either try spicy sausage or more pepper flakes! Also I used only 3 garlic cloves and we couldnt taste any garlic so will add more (we are garlic lovers though) To make it a little healthier, I used turkey italian sausage and used lowfat half and half and 1 tsp corn starch (to thicken) and lowfat 2% mozzarella chz. Will try this again w/some adjustments! Thx!

I made this last night for dinner and it was excellent.  I followed the recipe except that I didn't have heavy whipping cream so, I substituted heavy cream for it.  Delicious recipe - thanks for sharing.

I had never had a vodka sauce before I made this.  I did follow a fea other reviewers and added more vodka...I used Turkey sausage and used half the called for oil.  The flavor of the sauce was great and I think next time I may add a bit more cream.  Thanks Star for the recipe and my QC friends for the recommendation!

I've made this recipe so many times I've lost count!  This is one of the few recipes where I don't make any changes.  It's great as is, super easy and impressive enough to serve to guests.  Serve it with some freshly ground parmesan cheese and a nice crusty baguette.  Leftovers are great too!

I love this dish!! I omit the sausage and 1/2 the oil (actually, I probably only use 1/4 the oil).  I've also used dried parsley and dried basil. Thank you for sharing!!

This one will go on my Tried and True book.  We loved it.  The only thing I changed was to use Italian style Stewed diced tomatoes and parmesan cheese.  I will use more Vodka next time.  I did use Absolut Vodka.  We had left overs the next day and it was even better.  The spices had blended more and it was superb! Thank you Star!

This was an excellent recipe.  I did make a few changes:  I used 1/2 cup of Vodka and 3/4 cup of cream.  I also added about 2 tablespoons of fresh chopped basil with the tomatoes and omitted the parsley.  I also used an entire package of sausage cut into bite size pieces.  This recipe makes a lot so be ready for leftovers.  It's just as good if not better the next day.  Next time I want to try with shrimp.

I also chopped up some fresh basil and added it into the sauce. This was a very simple yet tasty recipe. It got rave reviews from my supper club members last night.

This was great with just a little tweaking - we like things spicy, so I used the hot Italian turkey sausage (1 package/5 links) as well as the crushed red pepper flakes.  I also added half of a red onion, diced, with the garlic and increased the vodka to 1/4 cup.  Dried parsley worked fine, but I would consider adding some fresh basil next time.  I also used one box of bowtie pasta (1 lb.)I omitted the salt and we never missed it.  I had enough to feed at least six hungry people!

We liked this one. My husband thought it needed more meat, so next time I will double the amount of sausage. Think it would be great with sauteed onion, mushrooms, and fresh basil added. Maybe even a little bit more red pepper. We topped ours with shredded Parmesan cheese and used mini penne pasta - very good. It's a fun recipe to experiment with.

I am so diggin this sauce!  Made it exactly as written, but added onion.  This sauce in my opinion would be delicious with any meat you would like to try it with, or just by itself with pasta....yum.

mm, very tasty!  I used evaporated milk instead of cream, added some paprika, onion, and extra red pepper flakes (we like it spciy!), and just used dry parsley.  I also made the sauce without meat, but added cajun spiced chicken to the dish afterwards.  Husband loved it, and it tastes great as leftovers!  :)

I've only used the sauce from this recipe and love it.  Try Fire Roasted tomatoes (Muir Glen Organic), and after letting everything simmer for a while, put it in the blender for a smooth sauce.  You definitely need the simmer time though to have the alcohol evaporate and for the flavors to blend nicely.

This was wonderful!  I made it for my entire family one night at our week at the beach and everyone loved it.  I didn't deviate from the recipe too much - just added onions and mushrooms and used italian sausage and it was a HUGE hit!  Several people went back for thirds (yes..thirds!) and this is coming from very picky Italian eaters...not just any italian will do.  It was easy to make and tasted great.  It had a nice punch to it but not too much.  I was worried based on some of the other reviews that it might be too "heavy" with the cream but it wasn't at all.  I used the biggest can of crushed tomatoes though so that may of helped thin it out.  I also added one fresh tomatoe diced which adds some freshness to it.  It was perfect!

Decided to try this due to all the great ratings and I AGREE!  Easy to make and delicious.  I followed the advice of a few others and used one half cup of half-and-half instead of heavy cream, and added one half cup of vodka.  Sprinkled it with fresh parmesan after serving - delicioso! I made mine the night ahead up until the point where you add cream and vodka.  Took it out of the fridge the next evening (I think it was even tastier for the extra time!), added the cream and vodka and hot pasta.  Super easy prep for a great meal! Will definitely make again.

I did not care for this at all. This didn't turn out at all like I was expecting, and that may be my own fault for not being much of an Italian food conoisseur. I just didn't like the flavor - I was expecting something much lighter in color and that had more a mixture of flavors than just tomato. It's hard to describe. Sorry this one didn't work for me :(

I made this recipe using spicy Italian sausage and followed the remainder of the recipe exactly.  Turned out great.  Simple, tasty, quick, and suitable for company too.

This recipe was easy to make and very tasty.  I served it for a small dinner party and got rave reviews.   I did add some sauteed onion and red/yellow/orange peppers.   I also made the sauce in advance leaving out the cream and vodka.  Just before I served dinner, I heated up the sauce, added the cream (I used low fat half-and-half) and vodka and it came out beautifully!
Definitely will use again for dinner parties.

This is the best pasta dish I have made!  A new favorite at my house.  Everyone I have made this for has LOVED it.  I made some changes as noted by prior posters.  Browned a little panchetta with less oil before adding the sausage (also using less salt).  I also used 2 14 oz cans of diced italian tomatoes; 3/4 cup of cream and 1/4 of vodka.  I am making this as a side dish for a large group for Thanksgiving.  Making it ahead of time because it tastes great the day after.

Wow, this was really good! I also followed the advice of previous reviewers and used 1/4c vodka and 3/4 cream.  I used hot italian sausage because we like things spicy! This was easy to make, and tasted like something right from our favorite Italian restaurant.  I will be making this one again for sure!

This was delicious.  I completely left out the salt and only used 1 tablespoon of oil.  I also splashed a few drops of vodka over the finished sauce right before I served it, due to a few reviews that were disappointed there was no vodka flavor.  The sauce was a bit thinner than we are used to, but it was still fantastic.

I could have found this recipe at an Italian restarant! Soooo good!  I did switch hot sausage for the sweet and added more peppers but I like it spicy.  Really easy to make and quick!  20 minutes and it's done.

OH MY GOODNESS!  This is so incredibily delicious!  My husband and my son loved this dish & had heaping seconds.  I am very impressed with this one.  I didn't use the olive oil - you really don't need to.  I used fire roasted chicken sausage -- yummy. I used half -n- half to cut down on the fat and it turned out great.

Only change I made was I substituted 3/8 cup nonfat half and half and 2 Tbsp light sour cream whisked together for the whipping cream because that's what I had on hand. Very tasty and easy to prepare.

I have made this recipe meatless, and my family prefers it that way.  Using good crushed tomatoes (i.e., San Marzano) gives the sauce a rich full bodied  taste where meat is not necessary.

Fantastic! To me it's a new twist with the vodka and the family loves it. Since I didn't have red pepper flakes, I used lots of ground black pepper with cayenne pepper. And the sausage I used a Dutch smoked sausage. It's delishhh!

Love the simple flavor of the sauce in this recipe - in fact, I find myself "testing" the sauce numerous times before it is served so I can savor it for myself! I will admit that I do not eat much pork or red meat, so I substitute half a pound of ground turkey (cooked through before added to the sauce) and think it tastes delicious that way as well.

This recipe was absolutely delicious, and very easy. I substituted Thai Kitchen lite canned coconut milk for heavy whipping cream because I cannot have dairy. I also used Italian style chicken sausage, to cut down the fat content a little. It was a big hit! Highly recommend.

This was just OK. My 5- and 4-year olds loved it and asked for more, however I could tell it wasn't blowing my husband's skirt up, nor did it mine. There just wasn't enough sauce. It dries up instantly after the pasta is added. It was lacking in the flavor department as well.

We love this recipe, but I made a few modifications: I used beef instead of sausage, added about a cup of chopped onion, 1/4 cup of vodka, and a cup of cream. I brown the meat, drain it, then add salt, pepper, crushed pepper flakes, then the garlic and onion. After I sautee it, I follow the rest of the instructions. It comes out pretty awesome, and all of my family loves it!

1 29 15 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/11815/penne-with-spicy-vodka-tomato-cream-sauce/ ... Wow.  Those crazy Italians & their simple but so fabulous style of cooking!  Easy cleanup, too.  What more could you ask for?!  Nah much!  :D  Sauce was good before & after the additions of vodka & heavy cream.  'Trying to figure this here - feel free to help - I halved the recipe, but accidentally used a half pound Johnsonville mild Italian sausage instead of one 3.5oz link - does that mean I essentially doubled the sausage amount since I was halving it?!?  I think so.  Regardless, I doubt I'll halve it next time.  :)  Wow.  Good.  Next day:  Boy child, 17, remains silent on his opinion; but after school, went right for it!  :)  How do I add more stars?

This was easy to make and very good.  I used spicy sausage instead of sweet and didn't add all the cream, but other than that I followed the recipe and everyone enjoyed it.

I loved this recipe. Instead of the sausage, I used Hillshire Farms Italian Style sausages and just diced them up. At first I thought I had too much sauce, but it ended up being the right amount. I am a new cook (I only have a few meals that I am good at: meatloaf, Parmesan crusted chicken, shish kabobs, stuffing, and some pasta salads) and will definitely be adding this to my list of favorites.

I have made this 4 times now and we LOVE it! Even my 5 year old loves it!! So much that I doubled the recipe this time so that we can have left overs! We changed it up a bit this time and used half sweet Italian sausage and half hot Italian sausage. Very good! On our routine dinner list now. Thank you!!!

Delicious, easy and quick!  Followed the recipe precisely, except for the sausage.  We had hot Italian in the freezer, and cooked it in thick slices rather than as ground meat.  The sausage added some extra heat to the dish but the sauce itself was perfect for our tastes.  Would serve this to company.  Thanks!

I loved the spicy of it; was a little too spicy for the kids although I used almost half of the red pepper suggested. I would definitely try it again but with chicken. I can only imagine how good that would taste. I love a good pasta and sauce recipe.

I've made this recipe so many times and it's an easy go-to recipe when in the pasta mood.  I have made the recipe exactly as written which is excellent.  Now that I so familiar with it, I've tweaked it a bit into my own version, which tastes just as good, if not better, just a bit healthier.  I replace the regular Italian sausage with  Turkey Italian sausage.  Sausage creates it's own "oil", so I just coat my pan with Pam before cooking.  Instead of heavy whipping cream, I use fat-free evaporated milk or fat-free half and half (whichever I have on hand).  I use fresh tomatoes and put them in the food processor (same measurements that the recipe calls for).  Everything else I keep the same.  Using the fresh tomatoes instead of the canned gives it that fresher taste and cuts down on that extra sodium.  Great pasta dish with a little less guilt.  No matter which way you make it, it's quick, easy and won't disappoint.

I loved this recipe.  I used Chicken Italian sausage and I changed the crushed tomatoes to those with basil and garlic.  I simmered the mixture longer than 15 minutes to get it a little thicker.  I loved it because it was fast enough to do on a night that I work.

Followed the recipe pretty much as written but i did increase sausage to a full pound.  And dont second guess amount of red pepper flakes like I did.  The amount in recipe will be plenty!  I doubled and it was very spicy!

This is so yummy! I love it. I used ground Italian HOT sausage instead of links. It's simpler that way! It won't get lost in the sauce as long as you don't break it apart into tiny pieces. My family loves their meat so I made sure it was at least a quarter size for each beef. I've also used hot brats and they worked just as well! I did not add any olive oil when using the ground Italian sausage. I also did not add any salt besides to the boiling water for the pasta. I felt silly using Grey Goose vodka but that was all I had! Poured whatever was left in the bottle. I also have used Riesling for my 2nd time and it was just fine! I also added a tablespoon or two of Italian seasoning. The best part is that it is SO easy and SO yummy! Can't go wrong with that:) I think this recipe will still be fine without the vodka or any alcohol if you don't have it, but then again it wouldn't be called vodka tomato cream :P P.S. I really think Italian seasoning helps a LOT with the flavor.

I've never reviewed a recipe before but this one really got my attention. The only thing I did differently was I used mild Italian sausage instead of sweet Italian. That's only before the store I went to did not have sweet Italian sausage. Probably a bit to spicy for my bf's taste because of that but it still came out delicious.

This is really good and definitely easy. I used half of a 16 oz package of Italian sausage and only about 1/8 tsp of crushed red pepper and since I had diced tomatoes I used them in place of the crushed tomatoes. It was delicious. I skipped the parsley and didn't miss it. I did cook longer with the vodka just to be on the safe side but no longer than 5 minutes, then added the cream. I'll be making this again often.

Very good but... I personally think it was too much pasta for this recipe; half a lb. would've been perfect. I slightly modified the recipe by adding 2 tbsp. chopped red onion, 6 thinly sliced white mushrooms, increased vodka by a 1/4 cup, and using spicy Italian instead of sweet (couldn't find it). I browned the sausage, then drained the fat, return sausage to skillet and then sautéed garlic, onion, mushrooms and red pepper flakes, stirring until garlic browned. Also I didn't add any salt...my husband and I skip it in all our recipes. We'd rather use fresh herbs and spices instead. It is definitely a keeper but next time either I double the sauce or I cut down half the amount of pasta. Thank you Star Pooley for sharing with us this fabulous recipe.

Basic pasta and tomato sauce. If you are attempting this recipe be aware that you will need to add more seasonings to help the dish acquire more taste. Appreciate the base of the recipe but more is needed to accomplish tasty I think.

It was awesome!  Sliced italian sausage, and seared it on both sides.  Added some slice mushrooms and diced sweet peppers and let that cook a bit.  Added 2 cups of my home canned tomatoes (which I pured in a blender) and let simmer for 1/2 hour.  Added a jar of Classico Tomato Vodka sauce and just heated until alittle bubblely.  5 minutes before serving added 3/4 cups of fresh parsley coarsely chopped. Severed over noodles and sprinkled with feta chesse.

Great recipe.  Our whole family loved it.  The only modification I made was that I added about a cup of frozen peas to the sauce just before I added the vodka and cream.  We'll definitely make this one again.

I think it's just four stars as written, but FIVE stars by doubling the cream.  Also, when I ran out of vodka, I used dry vermouth and it also tasted fine.

My guests and myself thought it was delicious. I made a few tweaks by adding more vodka sauce and putting in some diced tomatoes and onions in addition. Gave the sauce a heartier feel. I think the only think I would do differently next time is either make the sausage finer so it isn't larger chunks, or possibly go with a pancetta or bacon as the meat flavor in it. Overall, wonderful easy recipe and will definitely be making again!

This recipe was absolutely amazing. The only thing I changed was I used 1/2 the amount of EVOO to cook the sausage in. Next time I will probably use only a tablespoon of it. 1/4 a cup is way too much oil and I don't really like the flavor in the food. But I followed the rest of the recipe to a T and it was seriously amazing. There was just so much depth of flavor. My whole family (including my 2 and 3 yr olds) went back for seconds. This is definitely a new family favorite. Thanks for sharing!

We love this! We had a dish in Sicily in a very similar sauce but with a seafood mix (prawns, mussels, squid rings and fish) instead of sausage. I do it with seafood and add oregano and basil to it as well as a couple sliced onions for hubby's taste. Try it...you will be glad you did.

Excellent dish.  Of course I made a few modifications.  Since I was cooking for six, I went with 10 medium organic chicken sausage links.  I also added green peppers, 6 to 7 cloves of garlic, omitted the parsley and added three to four pinches of basil and oregano.  I also added six pinches of freshly grated romano, parmegiana, and asiago cheese.    Double up the vodka sauce if you plan on adding more sausage like I did.  Dont worry the sauce will thick as it simmers.  It turned out amazing.  In fact this is my new favorite pasta dish.  Its so tasty and comforting.

I LOVE this recipe and have made it several times.  I have substituted the vodka with a dry white or red wine. I usually double the crushed red pepper as well for some extra heat. Its fast, easy and always a hit with whoever I am serving.

This recipe is delicious and so simple. My boyfriend has told me it's his favorite thing that I've made. I use hot Italian sausage and a touch more cream. Great for a stress-free weeknight meal!

My husband LOVED this dish even though I managed to make lots of mistakes while making the dish (I forgot the sausage, used diced tomatoes with garlic and olive oil instead of crushed tomatoes, and half-and-half instead of cream).

Fast and easy to prepare, great for weeknights, and turns out great when you're distracted and not following the recipe

This recipe was AMAZING!!! My husband is going to be away for Valentine’s day so we had our dinner date last night. In keeping with the situation I tried to find something "Pink". This was such a big hit, spicy without being hot, creamy without being heavy and just plain DELICIOUS. Definitely a keeper, I will be making this one again and again!

Another big hit at the firehouse. Excellent tasting recipe. I did add pancetta (6 slices) and increased vodka to 1/4 cup and increased cream to 3/4 cup.  The recipe said it would serve 8 but only serves 6 (and just barely).

I made this with chicken instead of sausage, and used normal red pepper because it was all I had. It was seriously fast and very very easy, and soooooo yummy. My boyfriend really likes spicy food, and he loved it.

Another great recipe from this site!  Absolutely loved this vodka tomato cream sauce!  When I got this recipe I did not have any Italian sausage so I chose to make this without it and it turned out great!  I did use less olive oil; doubled the vodka; and added an onion, Italien seasoning, and spinach to the sauce for our preference but otherwise made it as is.  It turned out to be a great meatless alternative served with a Caesar salad and hot rolls! I can't wait to make this with the Italian sausage next time!  Thanks for sharing your recipe...we now have a new pasta sauce to enjoy!

OMG...This pasta dish tastes like something from a restaurant.  My boyfriend is usually the cook so when I made this I was surprised when he said "I'm impressed!"  Definitely a Keeper.

This was very good base for expansion! I Added 5oz of Alfredo sauce, used mild sausage and added extra fresh parsley which I stirred in with the tomatoes I also 3x as much red pepper flakes and an extra clove of garlic with a little onion powder which made for an awesome spicy vodka sauce! I will absolutely make this again

I liked this recipe for a change. It is very spicy. I thought it was lacking something..maybe next time I will add some zucchini or peppers. I also thought it would benefit greatly with a little sweetier taste.

This has been a family favorite for years!!!  I never follow a recipe to the letter, but stick pretty close on this one (I always add more garlic than what a recipe calls for).  Everyone from my husband down to my 6 year old loves this.

I just made it and it was VERY good! Only things I did differently were 1) using rigatoni, 2) cutting the links into medallions and 3) add a bit more vod than recommended about halfway through step 3. I'd recommend flipping steps 1 and 2 on this recipe because the pasta will get done way sooner than the sauce. Definitely a dish I now feel comfortable making for friends.

This recipe was delicious and very easy to make.  I did use spicy italian turkey sausage because my family does not eat pork, and it was wonderful.  I also after tasting the sauce at the end, doubled the amount of cream.  It was very tasty with less cream, but i think doubling it pushed it from great to amazing.  This recipe also seemed like it would be easy to alter to create a healthier version.

My entire family loved this and is begging me to make it again as soon as possible.

I thought this was good, not great.  It's good enough to try again.  I made it with chicken instead of sausage.  I think next time I'll try with some pancetta as others recommended.

Made it exactly as is - loved it.  thank you!  Note that it may seem that the tomatoes add too much liquid - but it goes pretty fast.  I used it with homemade spinach rigatoni - yum.

this is one recipe that should NOT be changed.  Its INCREDIBLE just the way it is.   The first time you make it - just follow the directions/ingredients word for word.  I've been making this for years- I use hot sausage and add more red pepper flakes cause we love it hot. Trust me, it's my families favorite meal. My boys would eat this every night of the week.  THANK YOU for the recipe!  I'm truly grateful!

I found this recipe quite a while ago and my whole family loves it. I've even had it requested multiple times when our extended family comes to visit. The only change I make is to use chicken sausage rather then the regular pork sausage due to some diet restrictions in our house. It's a great recipe and will continue to be made on a relatively consistent basis in my house. Thanks for the recipe!!

This meal was fantastic the night that I made it. However, it was a little dry and not very good the next day. I made it pretty much exactly like the recipe, but put a little more vodka and cream so the tomato didn't overpower the flavor.

Hands down, one of the best recipes I've ever made from this site. Gets amazing reviews. I've made it with pancetta and also italian sausage. Both are great. Sausage might be a bit heartier for colder months. I took suggestions and added more vodka, and cream... dialed down the salt. I don't bother w/parsley or cheese either. Also, the leftovers are amazingggggg.

This was delicious.  As someone suggested I upped the vodka to 1/4 cup and upped the whipping cream to just over 1/2 cup.  Served on fettucini was perfect!

This was terrific!! I wanted a recipe to use up my tomatoes before they went bad. I crushed them myself and used this recipe.  I didn't use the sausage (we didn't have any on hand) and added some creole spices since we were low on the pepper flakes and I know my husband likes to use it on other dishes...it was delicious! He's already asked when I plan to make it again! It was so easy that I'm pretty sure this will fall into our rotation--maybe I'll use it for entertaining soon!  Worth a try! Enjoy!

I thought this was really yummy. Some changes I made: left out the pepper flakes and just used a dash of cayenne instead; substituted 1/2 & 1/2 for the heavy cream; and before adding the pasta into the sauce, I added 1 lb. of shrimp to cook for a few minutes, instead of putting it over sausage. Delish!

As someone who was raised on bottled pasta sauce, I have to say - I am not going back!  This sauce was incredible.  When I first tried a spoonful of it, I was hooked.  My only issue with it is that it's very soupy and not very saucy.  Next time I will add cornstarch to thicken it up.  Definitely will make it again.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was excellent. I didn't modify it, unless you count adding half a can of tomato sauce (leftover from another recipe earlier this week) or using 3 links of sausage instead of 2. My fiance has vivid memories of his Sicilian grandmother's cooking, and he thought that this was true competition. His only complaint was that it wasn't enough meat for him (he is a true meat-eater!), but as he went back for seconds, he requested that I add this to my rotation. Success! I made enough to freeze the leftovers, so we've got another yummy dinner to look forward to.

This is really really good.  I used fat free half n half and it worked just fine, although I'm sure cream would make it more decadent.  I also used angel hair for pasta and it was great.

YUM! I added way more sausage and instead of a large can of diced tomatoes, threw a small can in the blender with a can of tomato paste and tomatoes from our garden. I also used an entire bunch of parsley which gave the dish some real color. Topped with fresh grated Argentinian parmesan - perfecto.

Penne a la vodka is our favorite dish. This is the best version I have tried to make. I did not use any sausage but instead added sliced chicken breast and jumbo shrimp. As reccommended I at least doubled the amount of vodka and also added another Tbsp or so of cream. I topped it with fresh parmesan cheese. Next time we will add prosciutto

Very good. I used spicy sausage and a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes. The spicier the better for me. I will make this again.

This was very good!  I made a few changes: I drained the grease from the sausage and I added a touch more cream, to reduce the spicyness of it.  Other then that, it was great!

This is one of my go to recipes.  Don't sub or change anything.  I like spicy so I use more red pepper flakes.  That's it!  Keep these ingredients on hand.  Quick to fix for pop in guests!

Big hit in my family.  Even my daughter's boyfriend, who says he doesn't like sausage, filled up on it.  I made the recipe exactly, except I doubled the sauce.  It didn't seem like enough for a lb. of pasta.  However, doubling it was a little too much.  Maybe 1-1/2 times the sauce would be just right.

I cooked this with my friend who doesn't eat beef or pork. So, we used shrimp instead of sausage. Other than that, we followed the recipe completely. It was so good! Just the right amount of spiciness. This sauce would also be good alone if you don't have any meat/seafood to add to it.

I just made this last night for my sweatheart for valentines day because it was one of our first dishes together in a restauraunt when we started dating and he loved it! It was such a romantic dish because of all the pretty colors. It was flavorful, easy, and delicious. I will definitely add this recipe to my book and I cant wait to try it again. Thanks for the recipe!

This was amazing.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and used 3/4 cup of heavy cream and 1/4 cup vodka.  I added a little shredded Parmesan cheese to the pasta while tossing.  I also garnished each dish with a little shaved Parmesan before serving.  It was the best dish I've ever made from the all recipes site.

I have to admit that I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I didn't have the ingredients so I made do with what I had.  I used 5 hot italian sausages without the casings and browned them in the pan and then drained. Since it was hot sausage and not sweet I decided not to add any of the red pepper flakes, next time I think I'll add just a pinch to give it a little ump. I didn't use the 1/4 cup of olive oil either; instead I sprinkled a little in the bottom of the pan and sauted 1/2 of an onion 1 stalk of celery and the garlic I then added 1/4 cup of vodka and deglazed the pan.  (This would be when I'd add the pinch of red pepper flakes).  I used half and half cream (10%) instead of the heavy cream because that is what I had on hand (didn't miss it).  Everyone loved it and wants me to make it again.

Really good recipe! The only thing that I do different is saute' bell peppers, onions and garlic in place of the italian sausage; I also use whole wheat pasta instead of that enriched stuff. Oh, and I add some dried basil to the sauce- very tasty!

I have made this just as the recipe is and it turned out great but this time I changed it up and it was just fantastic. I heated oil and added plenty of garlic and a splash of white wine and cooked in it med sized shrimp until pink. Then I set the shrimp aside. I added a can of diced tomatoes, parsley, red pepper, basil and salt, letting it simmer for 15 min like the recipe says. When I added the vodka at that point, I added fat free skim milk and a spoonful of light sour cream that I had beat together. I mixed the shrimp back in and mixed in the pasta. Yummy!

I've made this several times now and I took the advice of another reviewer and upped the vodka to 1/4 c and the cream to 3/4 c and it turns out great everytime!  I also up the garlic amount just because me and my boyfriend love garlic!

OH. MY. GOODNESS!!!! I think this was the most yummiest thing I've ever made. I used diced tomatoes, the kind with added basil, garlic and onion. I also used half and half, but next time I'll use cream. I also used the hot italian sausage, and that made it very spicy. I'll use sweet next time. Also, I have to say that I kinda liked the sauce before I added the half and half. Will for sure be making this again!!

I made this twice; once with crushed tomatoes, once with diced tomatoes. I think  it was better with diced tomatoes. I didn't like the texture with crushed tomatoes. Overall, a good recipe!

This dish was delicious and easy to make!  I substituted cavatappi pasta for the penne and used white wine instead of vodka, but otherwise, I followed the directions exactly and it turned out delicious!  My 3 year old twin daughters loved it too and they are quite picky!

It was good, but I've made better from other Vodka sauce recipes.  Also, the amount of sauce this makes is sufficient for half the amounf of pasta called for.

This was great!  I used 1/2 pkg of mild sausage and didn't use any olive oil. WAY more than 4 servings though. Can't wait for some leftovers at lunch tomorrow!  This ones a keeper!  Thank you for posting!

This is fantastic!!! My family loves it! My husbands favorite dish! I have to make this often! Sometimes I double the recipe to be able to freeze leftover sauce for later. I use Gianelli italian sausage. The links are about 4 to 5 inches long! Great stuff! I have made this with the cream and without and both ways are yummy! Thanks for a great recipe!

great recipe.  I used chicken breasts cooked in sun dried tomato oil instead of the sausage.  I also doubled the red pepper flakes.  It was also great as leftovers!

OMG amazing!  No vodka sauce can be made correctly without a little pancetta so I cooked about 7 slices before adding 2 small links of hot italian sausage.  I followed the rest of the recipe as is except I added a little extra cream and vodka as I like more sauce in my pasta.  I also added a few sprinkles of parm cheese while cooking in the last leg.  Came out amazing! A+ recipe thanks!

I thought this recipe was pretty good.  I liked the concept, but found it to be a little bland.  We even added sauteed spinach and mushrooms, added extra spice and freshly grated parmesan cheese to garnish along with parsley.  It was definitely a good dish, but I might have to find some other way to kick it up.

Yum, I made this for the second time tonight and my date loved it!  I did tweak it as follows: added a little chopped onion to the garlic and sausage,  substituted raw pork breakfast sausage since I do not like Italian sausage, and  I didn't have a can of crushed tomatoes so I used a jar of spaghetti sauce.  Also used half and half in place of the heavy cream.  And I probably used at least 2 to 3 tablespoons of the red pepper flakes -- it's supposed to be spicy!

Hubby actually said 2 1/2 stars and sister said 3. The only thing I did different was omit the parsley. I thought he wouldn't eat it at all if I did that. I don't eat meat but I tried a little of the pasta and it was good but not anything special.

This was the best Italian receipe I have seen in years.  I used to live in Italy and I really miss authentic Italian food.  This receipe brought me back to my years in Italy.  It was quick and very, very easy.  My kids could not believe we were eating so early. Usually cooking takes about an 1 1/2 after work.  This receipe took just under an hour.  Thanks

Excellent.  I made it without the sausage and used fat-free half and half and it came out amazing!  We are trying to watch our calories so this is a great treat - rich and creamy but very little fat!

Based on the ingredients, I thought this would be a very tasty dish. However, it turned out slightly bland. If I were to make it again, I would use spicy Italian sausage, not sweet, and cut it into chunks instead of crumbling it before browning. I would also add some more salt and red pepper flakes.

Great tasting recipe.  Our family likes a bit more sauce so I doubled the pepper flakes, tomatoes, salt, vodka, cream, parsley, and sausage.  It was a bit hit!

Gourmet all the way!  Like other reviewers, I upped the amount of vodka to 1/3 cup and the amount of heavy cream to 3/4 cup.  Use the good vodka (I used Ultimat).  I put everything together right up through to the vodka and cream and let it simmer on low in my crockpot for a few hours to decrease the acidity from the tomatoes.  I added sauteed crimini mushrooms and a little bit of finely minced onion.  Once I added the vodka and cream, I let that simmer for another 20-25 minutes.  Right before it was done, I added freshly grated Asiago cheese.  I also upped the amount of red pepper flakes considerably.  VERY delicious and it received rave reviews from the boyfriend!  Many thanks!

I used fat free half and half instead of heavy cream. Next time I would omit the salt, a little on the salty side for me. Great dish - a keeper!!!

Very good recipe. I used mild Italian Sausage as that's what I had on hand. Instead of removing casings, I used 5 or 6 sausages and cut them into bite sized chunks then browned them thoroughly. Finished recipe as directed and enjoyed every bite - so did the kids. We'll be having this again, and again.

I had been looking for this sauce for a really long time. I had a sauce just like this at a restaurant several years ago and I just sat there at the restaurant savoring every bite. This is the closest I have found to it. It is so good and flavorful. Only thing I added was some sweet Italian sausage, and some peas. My family loved this.

My bf is the cook in our relationship -- my attempts at solo cooking for him have always fallen a little flat.  This was the first dish I have made that really hit the mark.  It earned a rousing "That's my girl!"  I loved it too and it was very easy to make.      

Made a couple of modifications because of our taste preferences: used spicy Italian sausage and more of it, added basil, doubled the crushed red pepper flakes, tossed in some big chunks of fresh garlic in addition to the minced, and used frozen tortellini in place of the penne.

This was awesome!  I cut the recipe in half for the 2 of us and it turned out great!  I'd never had a vodka tomato cream sauce before and I'm totally sold.  I'm also pretty health-conscious and used the following changes: only a tiny drizzle of oil, Italian-style chicken sausage, half and half thickened with about 1 tsp. of cornstarch (next time I'll use fat free half and half), tomato sauce instead of crushed tomatoes and a little more than double the vodka.  And at least twice as much red pepper.  It was fantastic and we can't wait to make it again!  I think it would be great with half tomato sauce and half tomatoes.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Really good tomato cream sauce. I used tomato sauce instead of crushed tomatoes b/c I'm not a big fan of chunky sauce.  It was excellent--family all ate big bowl fulls for dinner and then the hubby sneaked downstairs at midnight to polish off the leftovers!

Great flavor and spice. I only made two small changes: I used one hot sausage link and one sweet, and used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream. Next time I will use the heavy , though, as the sauce seemed a little thin. 
All in all, a fabulous dish.

This recipe was delicious!!! Instead of sausage I sauteed scallops and shrimp in olive oil, garlic and onion powder and threw those in the sauce as it simmered. My husband loved it! Word of advice: add the pasta to the sauce instead of the sauce to the pasta that way you don't run short on sauce. Thanks!!

This recipe is fantastic!  I made only  one change.  I used a full package of Jenny-O turkey breakfast links instead of the sweet sausage.  I can't really find the words to describe just how yummy this pasta turned out.  It was simple and quick to make.  Will definitely make this again and again and again...

Definitely one of the best recipes I've ever made!  It comes together very easily and pretty quickly too.  I usually use spicy Italian sausage and reduce the red pepper just a bit...Delicious and unusual, I make it almost every other week.  Thanks for the recipe!

I absolutely love this recipe! I had Pasta Rustica at Macaroni Grill and really wanted to try to make it at home... this comes *real* close! Add some shredded/chunked up leftover chicken and it's almost dead on.

While fixing this I loved the quick way it when together for a mid-week meal. Though my husband said at first taste that it wasn't his favorite. Then after his 4 helping said he may have misunderstood himself and I should add this to our favorites. Love it.

Made this for dinner tonight and just loved it. We subbed ground beef for the sausages. We added more vodka than it called for (wow!, I don't recommend)and black pepper. Topped with tri blend of grated cheeses. Served over rigatoni as I was out of penne. Delicious! Thanks for the post!

This recipe is definately a keeper.  It's creamy but not to thick and has a little kick.  I loved the idea of the sweet sausage.  I used turkey sausage and it was great.  Everyone enjoyed it!

Delicious!  Everyone in my extended family just loves- easy to make for a large crowd.  I do a few things different.  I have done a few things different.  1. Use sundried tomato sausages.  2. Use a non-dairy subsitute instead of cream which doesn't make it thick but the texture still is exceptional. 3. Simmer chunks of chicken in white wine then add to the pasta before serving- specially for large crowds it is sure to fill everyone up. 4. Do not add garlic b/c not everyone likes

This really didn't impress me at all.  I followed the recipe to exactley and the end wasn't very good.  The only thing I liked was the spicyness because I added some extra red pepper.

Oh so good.  I was running late the other evening after a long day and whipped this together in less than a 1/2 hour.  I omitted the sausage and it was absolutely wonderful.  I might add the sausage next time, but this was terrific without it too.

Best Vodka Cream Sauce Recipie I've found!

Replaced Heavy Cream with Light Cream, doubled the red pepper flakes, used hot sausage instead of sweet, and replaced the parsley with basil. 

Makes a very pretty, gourmet looking meal. Very easy to make!

We did not really enjoy this recipe at our house.  I followed the recipe exactly, except for adding a few extra red pepper flakes because we like spicy food.  We found the sauce stuck to the noodles instead of being smooth like we expected. Just wasn't our taste.  I will keep searching for a good tomato cream sauce!

I loved this recipe.  I made this for my family and they raved.  The sausage had just the right flavor.  I would recommend using a good vodka.  I used dried parsley and it was fine.

I increased vodka to 1/2 cup, like others suggested.
For the sausage I bought Italian sausage brats (Johnsonville).  This was twice as much meat as called for in the recipe.  I'm glad I used this much.
I thought this was too much pasta for this sauce.  I would only use 3/4 lb of pasta next time (or increase the amount of sauce)
Also- this could easily feed 6-8 people (not 4 as suggested)
Good overall, EASY to make, but not overly extraordinary.

Wow, this recipe was amazing and so simple. I added about a teaspoon of fresh ground pepper, a teaspoon of garlic powder, 1/2 tablespoon extra of vodka, 1/2 teaspoon extra of red pepper flakes, 1/4 c extra of whipping cream and sprinkled with fresh grated parmesan cheese. Next time I am going to try this with chicken and cheese tortelini.

I expected a lot more from this recipe. I use to work at an italian restaurant and have been looking for a vodka sauce that rivals theirs...this was not it. I mean, it was alright, but I'm a big pasta eater and this just didn't impress me. Perhaps it was because I added more vodka like others suggested. It was good, but not great...I will keep looking.

This was very easy to prepare, and tasted great! However, I did use fresh tomatoes, and just blended it up with garlic and oregano to make the sauce. I also added some paprika and basil. I didn't have penne on hand, so I used linguine instead. I left out the vodka. Wonderful!

We loved this!  I did change it up just a little though.  I used 3 HOT sausages instead of 2 sweet, 1/4 of a cup of vodka instead of 3T(nest time I will use 1/3 of a cup as others have suggested) and when I added the vodka and cream I added 1tsp of basil and 1tsp of oregano.  We topped it with a parmesean ramano cheese blend and served it with garlic bread, a baby green salad would go great with it too...Rachel

Delicious even with whole wheat penne.  I used 1/4 cup vodka instead of 2 tablespoons.  I also added bacon to cook with the sausage but next time I won't.  Bacon is not needed and just adds wierd crunchy things where you don't think there should be.  This recipe is perfect consistency.  Doesn't oil up when reheated like most restaurant rose sauces do.

I thought this was very good and unlike many cream sauces, it wasn't bland.  The changes I made were: used spaghetti noodles (instead of penne), only about 1 Tbs. of olive oil(instead of 4), a can of whole tomatoes (instead of crushed), 1/4tsp. salt (instead of 3/4 tsp), 1/3 cup vodka (instead of 2Tbs), and spicy Italian sausage (instead of mild).  I still put in the 1/2 tsp. of red pepper flakes so it was really spicy but we like it that way.  I will definitely make this again.

Excellent recipe!  My boyfriend said it was "very, very good" (a double "very" from him is rare :-) It's perfect for a change of pace from traditional marinara sauce.  The only changes I made were to use one can of tomato sauce and one can of chopped tomatoes instead of the crushed tomatoes.  I also added more vodka, 1/3 c., as others did.  I didn't have any sausage, so I used grilled chicken that had been marinated in a sun-dried tomato/Italian marinade (from the butcher shop).  The flavor was great and the spiciness was just right.  I will definitely make this again--as soon as the mega-leftovers are gone from the freezer!

I have tried this recipe a couple of times now once with chicken and and once with shrimp. Both were fantastic. I always add a little extra vodka and a little extra red pepper because we like things spicy. I use plain yogurt instead of cream and add red, yellow, and orange bell pepper strips to give it a little more color. It is one of our favorites.

I wish there were more than just 5 stars for this recipe!!  I have made this many times and each time it is consistently delicious. Friends repeatedly ask for this recipe and request that I make it for dinner parties or showers in lieu of the standard baked ziti.  It's a hit every time!!  I find myself not ordering this dish in restaurants anymore b/c they never match up to the flavor of this recipe!

Unbelivable!!!! I've made it many times already.  I'm Italian and I must say it's right up there with Nonna's cooking.  Try substituting the sausages with prociutto or pancetta (very good also).
Quick, Easy, and Delicious what more could you ask for.
A must try for all!!! A big 5 stars!

Sorry, but I really didn't like this. The orangish color freaked me out and the pasta was so heavy. Even my boyfriend who usually eats anything I make - no matter how badly it turns out sometimes - barely managed to finish his plate and admitted later it wasn't very good. It was easy to make, but wasn't worth the amount of time I spent on it.

I substituted the sausage with an equivalent amount of pre-cooked duck, added parmesan cheese and marinated olives. It turned out great and I'll definitely make it again.

This pasta turned out absolutely delicious.  I added some spicy red onions and more parsley than called for... turned out to be one of the best pasta dishes i've ever had. I cooked it for a romantic dinner with my boyfriend and he had 3 helpings!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

Very tasty sauce, though if you like it spicy, add more pepper flakes.  We used spicy sausage and added about a teaspoon of the red pepper flakes. Don't be tempted to serve a large plate of pasta, as the sauce is very heavy.  Adding sliced red peppers (sauted with a bit of garlic) tasted great.  We also boiled the sausage before hand (to make sure it was cooked, but not dry) and we sliced it up (rather than removing the covering).  Thanks for the recipe!

very good!  Easy and quick...used plain, low fat yogurt instead of whipping cream to reduce fat, still tasted awesome!

I have tried many variations of this recipe. I prefer chicken over sausage. I also add 1/2 a small onion, diced, to give the sauce a bit more stock. I also saute the onions and garlic separately from the meat, to highten the flavors. I have also found that using fresh ingredients over dried makes all the difference in the world. Overall, this is one of my most favorite dishes to prepare.... definately not a plain dish.

Very good.  After reading the other reviews I used 1/2 cup vodka and 3/4 cup of cream.  I actually used half and half, but I think cream would have been better.  I also threw in some grated cheese while it was cooking.  My husband loved it.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks!

Great dish! I also added yellow & red bell peppers, used 1/2 cup of vodka, 3/4 cup heavy cream and used sweet italian turkey sausage and it was amazing! Oh, I also used the crushed tomatoes with the added italian seasonings which gave it a nice flavor.

This was ok. I have had better vodka sauce at an Italian restaurant. I found this was a little too rich and chunky and the Italian sausage didn't add a very good flavour. I will continue on my hunt for a good a la vodka sauce.

This was excellent. I used a Spanish Chirizo sausage sliced instead of the italian and added cayenne pepper in place of the red pepper flakes. The result was a pasta that was just spicy enough and full of flavour. I did add some tomato paste as I prefer a thicker pasta sauce.
A five star meal!

Delicious and easy to make. I used loose italian sausage instead of links and in place of the penne I served the sauce over cheese and spinach stuffed rigatoni. Will be making it again for Christmas Eve.

Excellent. Easy & quick to make. We left out the red pepper flakes because we do not like spicy dishes and it still had lots of flavor. Even our 5yr.old liked it. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a great recipe. I used fat free half and half instead of heavy whipping cream and spicy italian elk (my fiance is a hunter) and it was very good! I will use whipping cream next time because it wasn't saucy enough. However, the spicy flavor really kicks in and replaces that need for flavor from fat. Very delicious and I liked the addition of vodka -- very unique.

Excellent. Fast easy and tastes great! I added about 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese to give it some
extra flavor. Next time I will try freshly grated and maybe mix some romano in too.

Delicious recipe. I used hot italian sausage rather than sweet and added crushed tempin's rather than red pepper flakes.  Makes for a much spicier recipe. The sauce needs to be simmered down more than recommended in order to make a thicker sauce.

This was sooooo good and quick and easy!  Everyone loved this and couldn't tell that there was vodka in it.  I did not add any salt and cut down on the oil and red pepper flakes.  I served this over the Quick Gnocchi recipe from this site and everyone loved it.  Thanks!

This sauce is as rich and decedent as sauces with twice the cooking time. This may actually be the best sauce I have made in under 1 hour. The only change I made was substituting heavy cream with coconut milk, since my wife is lactose intolerant. The result was still amazing. I put it over homemade gnocchi and it was a perfect complement to the creamy flavor. Next I think I am going to try it with some homemade pasta.

I can't tell you how good this pasta was. OH MY.
I used fettuccine noodles and threw in some extra spices! I didn't have any red pepper flakes so I used cayenne instead (not 1:1! added it until I liked the spicy level) Also, I used turkey sausage! DELICIOUS.

Very good, very easy to make. Not too spicy, so add more spice if you want a stronger kick.

It’s good, but the sauce wasn’t very saucy by time the noodles were added. Definitely had some spice, but I wish there was a little more chunk to the sauce

Basically turns out as spicy crushed tomatoes. It's still tasty and we finished it all, but this is not the vodka sauce I was looking for.

I LOVED the sweet and savory taste of this recipe. I used watermelon infused vodka and that did not hurt the dish, but I would add more garlic next time. But, ultimatly AMAZING!

It was a last minute decision to make this as we had heavy cream left over from Easter.  We only had North American style side bacon on hand (not back bacon or what is also called Canadian bacon-but not by Canadians). Used 93g which is 1/4 package (packages are no longer 1lb and this is about 2 1/2-3 strips), cut into 1/2 inch pieces and fried it until it was fairly well done-almost crispy.  Used all of the fat that was rendered to fry the garlic.  Did NOT add olive oil.  Also used San Marzano canned tomatoes for their superior flavour.  It turned out absolutely wonderful.

This dish was delicious,. There was no leftovers and my granddaughter wanted to lick the pot.
I will be making this one again. The only thing I forgot to put in the pot was the sausages,but it was very good.

I loved this recipe!! I did not add red pepper flakes (I don’t like spice) or vodka since I didn’t have any but besides that, I did everything else according to recipe and overall I loved it! And so did my boyfriend who is the pickiest eater!

Here’s what I did to modify this recipe from 4 to 5 stars: I cut the olive oil in half, and then drained it after the meat was browned. I didn’t need that extra fat in my sauce. I used 3 sweet Italian sausage links instead of 2, and then I doubled the cream. My family LOVED this one after those changes!

This recipe was just okay.  I think maybe using half the recommended pasta would make it saucier.  Not enough sauce for all that pasta.

I've made this repeatedly, my family loves it.  I save it for special occasions, especially after hiking and skiing.  Now that I practically have it memorized, I am not sure I get all the proportions right every time and it still works.  Sometimes more cream/sausage/garlic...doesn't really matter.  The only change I made after a few times is putting the vodka in while the tomatoes are simmering.  The longer the tomatoes simmer, the better, I like to give it a half hour even though it says 15 minutes.

We loved it.  I didn't add enough red pepper flakes to make it spicy, but it was  terrific nonetheless!  I usually don't add heavy cream to any pasta dishes (using 1/2 & 1/2 instead) to save some fat calories, but this one I did.  Will make again!

Sauce was very tasty.  We sopped it up with some garlic bread. I did add a small can of tomato sauce and only used about 1/2 the pasta.

I doubled the sausage and kept out the vodka when I brought it to my work's holiday pitch-in.  I made about double the recipe and kept it warm in the crock-pot and it was a HUGE hit.  All of it was eaten, even though it was the last dish for people to be able to get when walking down the line.

We've made this recipe in my home a number of times just as written and have always received wonderful responses.  It is extremely easy to make and can appease everyone.  If you want to make it a little spicier, make sure you get hot italian sausage  and add some cayenne to the mix.  I would also recommend adding about a tsp of onion powder and tsp of oregano or basil when you let the sauce simmer, if you'd like.

I made this recipe according to the instructions, and it turned out very nice and was really good.  It's a mild tasting creamy tomato sauce, with a nice punch of garlic flavour to it.  If you want it to be a little more saucy and not as tomatoey, I'd do half a can of tomatoes and the other half using tomato sauce, then add in the vodka and cream.

We did not make any changes. My daughter liked it. My husband thought it was too spicy. My son thought it had a strange flavor he couldn’t put his finger on.  Too many mixed reviews from my family to make it again.  It was very simple and quick to make!

This was so flavorful and easy to make.  We had it on fresh ziti and enjoyed leftovers for another dinner and lunch.  Followed the recipe fairly closely, but used less olive oil and half and half instead of the heavy cream.  It would be easy to modify according to individual tastes.

Delicious! Added pancetta and portobello mushrooms to the italian sausage. Added 1 Tablespoon brown sugar to reduce tomatoes acidity. In the end, before fresh parsley, added dried basil. Turned out delicious, served with parmesan!

Accidentally added the recipe to my shopping list twice, making 12 servings instead of 6. That was the best mistake I’ve ever made because now I’ll be able to eat this masterpiece for the coming week. Wow!

This recipe was absolutely amazing!! I made this for my wife because she loves vodka sauce and this did not disappoint. She said it was among the best she’s had. With that said, I didn’t use the red pepper flakes because she’s not a fan of anything remotely spicy. I also took the advice of others and used a little more vodka and cream. We will def be making this again!

I really like this recipe and have used the idea many times. Since I live in a country that has limited options in terms of sausages, I use kielbasa and it works really well.

Delicious, and super easy to make! Substituted sweet italian sausage with spicy italian sausage, vodka with rose (I was already drinking some), and used basil instead of parley.  My  bf and I loved it - and we are huge italian foodies.

Excellent pasta sauce! Easy and quick to make especially when you don't have a lot of time to cook. I would have added just a touch more spice but I love spicy food.

Made it for a dinner party and it was a huge success.  Everyone raved about it and had multiple servings.  Based on another reviewer's comments, I tried to get pancetta but the store was out.  In its place I diced up 3 strips of bacon prior to adding the sausage and it turned out great.  I'll make it the same way next time.

I followed the recipe as is, except I omitted the fresh parsley as I didn't have any. I will definitely make this again. It was great for a winter night's dinner but I would also make this as a BBQ side dish. If making this for company, I would add the parsley for presentation.

As a huge fan of pasta and various sauces, I was looking for a good vodka sauce recipe (I avoid the canned/bottled sauces like the plague). Unfortunately, this is not what I was looking for. This sauce is not a vodka sauce, it is simply a spicy tomato sauce. If you're looking for a recipe for a good, easy to make tomato sauce, then this recipe is excellent! However as a vodka sauce, this recipe is incredibly mediocre and will leave you disappointed. 

I plan to make this recipe again with a few changes, I would use at least 1/2 cup of vodka (up to 1 cup) with 1/2 cup of chicken stock, use half the amount of garlic and salt, add a teaspoon of chili flakes (Depending on how spicy you like it) and throw in a few leaves of fresh basil.

It was very good. I used bacon instead of Italian sausage, hoping it would give the pasta a smoky flavor, like the pasta from the restaurant Il Fornaio, but it didn't work unfortunately. I think next time, I'll also add some aged cheddar.

Also, maybe it was just because I didn't use the Italian sausage, but depending on the brand of canned tomato, the sauce might be overbearingly sour, in which case I added a little sugar.

I wasn't sure what to expect when I made this as it was my first Vodka sauce. I left out the sausage since my wife is a vegetarian.  I simmered the garlic and onion in a bit of olive oil and then added the tomatoes. Followed the rest of the recipe and added Parmesan cheese at the end. Totally delicious and a huge hit. Will definitely make it again.

I couldn't believe how easy and delicious this was! I live abroad in Asia, at times it's difficult to find ingredients I need.. so I used whole milk instead of whipping cream, and dried parsley instead of fresh.. still so delicious!

Love love love this dish! I left out the red pepper flakes because I found it a bit spicy the first time.  I also left the sausage cut into slices.

I tried this recipe because of it's great ratings, but was not very pleased with the outcome.   Didn't care that it had chunks of tomatoes rather then a creamy sauce.  It wasn't bad, not much flavor, probably won't make it again.

I did everything the same for this recipe besides I did not do the red flakes because I do not like spicy things, and I added spinach in as well. This was fantastic! The sauce was super easy to make and rich. I will definitely make it again! Thank you!

We would add a bit more crushed red pepper and make a little more sauce! But definitely will make again. Wonderful!

A good start to a great dish. I am learning to cook basically by trying every recipe on here that sounds yummy!!! My rookie tips are don't start the pasta until everything else is almost done. Then halve the amount of recommended red peppers. And I added a whole bunch of cooked spinach and and sun dried tomatoes. It was fantastic!!!!

I used a smaller pasta, fusilli and it was so much better than the regular penne.
I had this dish in Florida recently and wanted to try it at home...glad I did. Family loved it
Served with a tomato, cucumber and red onion salad and Red Lobster biscuits.

Excellent! The whole family loved it. I didn't have any parsley and used regular sausage seasoned with a good dash of Italian seasoning, but that to me didn't affect the flavor negatively.

Super delicious. I switched out the beef sausages for chicken sausages and they were great. Also added some brown sugar and ginger, with a little extra peppers and it was a perfect spicy sweet sauce.

So easy and delicious. I made a couple small changes: 1) substituted diced pancetta for the sausage, 2) reduced the olive oil to a couple of tbsps, 3) added one onion, which I sauteed with the garlic, 4) upped the vodka to 1/4 cup. Followed everything else and it turned out great.

This is my absolute favorite go-to pasta recipe! I don’t change a thing except to use mild Italian sausage. It has just the right amount of heat and tastes like you’ve been simmering it for hours!

I  followed the recipe using chicken sausage.  Since my family can't have dairy, I left out the cream and the vodka.  I also added sun dried tomatoes, just because I have them and wanted to use them.  This was delicious, and I will make again.

Needed more salt and less red pepper. Also very thin compared to a jarred sauce. Maybe use some tomato sauce next time and drained diced tomatoes. A very basic recipe that gets the job done, but isn't mind blowing

This recipe is phenomenal The first time I made it, i did not add the sausage and I thought it was good. But when i added the sausage it made it 10 times better! I bought 1lb of johnsonville ground sweet Italian sausage, so I used half (8oz). I also added about a 1/4 of vodka instead of 2 tbsp. I would also recommend using Barilla Collezione Rigatoni, the noodles taste like they are homemade. Will definitely make again!

Excellent! Had to improvise, though. I didn't have vodka in the house, so used white wine instead. It turned out really good. Thanks, Allrecipes for the great recipes??

This pasta is soooo good!  Really easy to make and doesn't take too long. I had a bunch of boozed up people over for Holloween and randomly decided to make this when everyone said they were hungry. Everyone couldn't get enough!  The pot was pretty much licked clean haha.

As an Italian, I was surprised I liked this dish. It strays from the traditional penne a la vodka my (northern Italian) great grandmother made. Now, this is super easy dish I make regularly. There is absolutely no need for the 1/4 cup of olive oil- the fat rendered from the Italian sausage is plenty for the dish. I use a pinch of the crushed peppers so my kids will eat it and put the shaker at the table for those who want more heat. Traditionally, the sausage wouldn't be there, but I like it. My great grandmother would ocassionally use prosciutto when she made hers added at the end. Without the oil, this dish is a four and a half star dish.

I did not make any changes to this recipe. It was OK. Nothing to write home about. I definitely agree with some of the other reviews about it tasting better the next day. To be honest, it tasted like a spicy tomato soup that was reduced down to thicken with pasta. I won't make it again.

Pretty yummy! Some parts I doubled because I like a lot of sauce. I pretty much winged-it on the vodka. A splash or 3 more really complemented the tomatoes. I subbed the sausage for chorizo flavored seitan crumbles (girlfriend, Alli is pescatarian) and doubled the garlic because She loves it and I love it and it's garlic what's not to love? It turned out really well. I made a pound and a half of pasta. Friends came over, and I knew I'd want leftovers.

This was great!! I bought the spicy Italian sausage from the Harris Teeter counter. The sausage, pepper flakes and garlic give it a very bold flavor.
I have had this sauce at a restaurant but it was much milder. Very good but milder.
Very simple to make.

So good and easy to make! I don't know why it calls for links. Save yourself a step and buy ground Italian sausage. I usually don't like leftovers, but I woke looking forward to these.

Pretty good, although I found the amount of sauce was just enough to use with a pound of rotini ( that is all I had in the pantry).  I did add about a tablespoon of Tomato Paste to help enrich the flavor. I will make again!

This was a great recipe, I've made it three times now. Each run I've taken liberties with substitution of ingredients, approximating measurements, adding this and that, here and there. This recipe gives me confidence in making pasta sauce from scratch. #nevergobacktojar

I made this almost exactly as written.  The only thing different is I halved the crushed red pepper due to preference.  I think our family just didn't like the addition of the sausage in the sauce.  Will keep looking for a different vodka sauce recipe.

We love this recipe! It is easy to make and very flavorful.  We like to use a half cup of wine instead of vodka.  Definitely a winner.

Instead of a sweet marinara sauce, I used a 28 oz. can of Contadina crushed tomatoes, 4 cloves minced garlic, italian seasoning to taste and dried rosemary.  Also used 1/4 lb of small chopped panchetta.  Excellent!  Fed 6 hearty plates, no leftovers.  Served with warm sourdough bread and salad.

Love this recipe and make it often. It's SOOOO easy and delicious. I don't change much- I usually add more sausage than it requires (just because I throw in the whole package) and I usually pour a couple of "laps" of vodka and cream, just to strengthen the flavor and because I eyeball measurements. But this recipe is awesome. I made it as is at first w/ no complaints.

I'm never buying store bought sauce again!!!  I had everything in my pantry except the sausage, and it was soooo good!  I really liked the kick the crushed red pepper and garlic gave. It's valentines today, I think I'm going to buy some lobster to soak up the sauce. ;)

Instead of doing vodka which I thought I had some but I guess I drink it all I used Sherry and I also substituted the meat for shrimp it was very good lights and I used angel hair pasta instead of a heavier pasta I liked it much better than the flower stuff that that taste

We made this tonight and absolutely loved it! We added sliced mushrooms and a diced jalapeño in with the garlic. Then simmered in white wine instead of vodka since we had that on hand. Topped off with cheese, delicious. Will make again!

Super easy, quick and most important, delicious, with a nice bite to it. Made almost exactly to the recipe, but used 1/4 cup of vodka, instead of two tablespoons and 3 sausage links, instead of 2.

Exceptional. Although after making it I made two changes. First, I use linguine. Second, I actually prefer leaving the vodka out. I know, how can you make penne vodka sauce with neither penne nor vodka? Deliciously, I say.

Really Goo:-D!  Decrease oil and salt.  Increase vodka to 1/4 c.  and cream to 3/4 c.  Dont be afraid of the red pepper as I couldnt even taste it.  May add more next time.  And try adding peas and mushrooms.  And very important, liquid wll be thin at first.  Take off the heat, cover with lid and let set for 10-15 minutes.  Top with grated parmesan.

I did change it up a bit, as I can never cook exactly according to a recipe (roll of mild sausage, onions, garlic and sweet red pepper sauted), but the main ingredients were the same. It is awesome!  I used fresh cream from our milk cow and wow was that a bonus, it didn't taste like much until I added the cream and vodka.

A super flavorful and what an easy sauce to make too!  You would a thought I spent hours on that sauce.  I used a light cream to save a bit on the calories and fat.  As you can read it was still DELICIOUS!

Quick and Easy variation of Vodka Sauce. I used chopped onion, celery, carrots and fresh parsley as the base. Then added the crushed tomatoes, basil and the other ingredients. Add a splash of red wine, and just a little sugar if necessary. The 2 Tbl. of vodka and 1/2 cup of heavy cream measurements are spot on. I also used an extra amount of  sweet Italian sausage.

I made this recipe doubling the ingredients. I made the following adjustments after reading several reviews. I added one sautéed onion and increased the vodka to a total of 1/2 cup.  I substituted the cream for half and half and increased that to a total of 2 cups. 

I omitted the parsley, but added a bag of fresh spinach at the end. Next time I will add additional spinach. I did not added the pepper flakes because I added spicy mango chicken sausage which provided that little bit of  kick that is superb with this recipe. 

I have been cooking a new recipe every night from allrecipes.com and this recipe has created the biggest positive response from my family!   Superb, superb!

This was a delicious, very satisfying, dinner dish which had a nice sweet taste with a hint of spice. Parmigianno Reggianio is a must for the best results! Next time I will add a little more sausage.

Brown the pancetta at first. 6-8 slices. Chop it in the ninja and mix it with sausage. Three sausage links. Flavor the tomatoes with garlic salt and basil. Extra splash of cream besides the 1/2 cup. Throw sugar in at the end until it tastes less salty.

As one reviewer suggested I did use the pancetta and then add the sausage to it. Also I used tomatoes with garlic and and add red onion to the sauce. Very easy and I have already made this two times and my fiancée loves it. Appreciate the ingredient suggestion changes.

I liked this recipe, which I made as written (except that I used turkey sausage because I don't eat pork). I found the flavor of the sausage much more prominent than I was expecting. It was good; it just wasn't quite what I was looking for. Perhaps cooking the sausage separately and adding it to the sauce later would change the flavor profile.

Ok this was SO good. My husband would not stop talking about it he said it's the best thing I ever made. I followed the recipe to a T, except I added a little more fresh parsley on top before I served it and some shredded Parmesan cheese. I'm so full but I can't stop eating more.

I love this recipe! I have made it for many people and it's always gotten rave reviews. My boyfriend even eats seconds of this every time, which is not something he usually does! The only tweak I made was using spicy sausage that was already uncased since I enjoy spicy food.

changes. 1/2 pound penne. 2 TBLS oil. Italian sausage or my choice-chicken. Just a pinch of red pepper.  Sprinkle with a blend of mozz. and parm. I forgot the ridiculous amount of parsley and its a good thing. Not needed. Awesome starter recipe!

Most vodka sauce recipes add the vodka much earlier in the cooking process and reduce and cook off the alcohol then. When making this recipe I did add the vodka with the tomatoes but let it simmer for an hour or so. Added the creme just before serving. Delish. I have also frozen some sauce in small containers, defrosted in the micro, heated on the stove - still delish!

This recipe was very good. I unfortunately could not add vodka to it as I can not drink it. In lieu of vodka, I added white wine and it tasted good. It is a pretty quick recipe. I do not think there is anything to modify to make this recipe better it is good as is!

Absolutely no changes needed. Before you go trying other people's suggestions, just make this exactly as written. It's fantastic, you could get this at a restaurant and not be disappointed. If I had to make it again ... I wouldn't change a thing!

However, it works great with chicken; a girlfriend didn't like sausage and I used a couple of chicken breasts sliced with some Italian seasoning and black pepper instead. Fabulous.

I wasn't sure about this recipe, so I made it just for myself, but my boyfriend loved it even as leftovers! It makes a large batch and heats up nicely, nice enough for a good home made dinner and hearty enough to take for work. I made according to the recipe, ommiting the red pepper flakes and using ground sausage instead of cutting links. It was delicious and easy on my budget! I will definitely make this again! Thanks :)

This was the simplest recipe! My modifications: I don't think you need to cook the sausage with the olive oil as it already contains a lot of fat. Once I browned it, I drained and then added a few tbsp of olive oil to sauce. Didn't add the crushed red pepper so kids could eat it and just offered on the side when serving. Also didn't have vodka so omitted but would be interested in adding next time.

Really good. Has just enough heat in it to give you a tingle, but doesn't over power the flavor. Added 3 fresh romas, and used vegan sausage instead of the regular sausage and the trade totally works. Also added an extra tbs. of vodka due to the increase in volume from the tomatoes.

This was the best sauce I've made, granted I haven't made many but my husband and I really liked it. I am the lazier - the - simpler- the - recipe -the - better kinda cool in our house and even I found it easy to make.  It will now be a favorite for us.

Terribly bland for a recipe with "Spicy" in the title.   The only good thing I can say is that it was done in a jif.

With a couple of changes, from reviewers and myself, this could be a rich fantastic dish. Next time, I would halve the oil, or omit it all together. Was a bit too greasy. I omitted the pepper (I don't like spicy) and salt. I used full-salt tomato sauce and doubled the vodka and cream. Lastly, 1/2 link for 2!? Luckily, I at least tripled the sausage, equaling one link per person. I also sprinkled some parmesan on top. Even without some of these changes, was a very good dish.

The main problem with it was the crushed tomatoes. Maybe it was the brand I bought but when I opened the can it was a thick paste. So the sauce ended up covering up all the other flavours. Couldn't taste the sausage, pepper flakes, or even garlic as the sauce was so heavy. It was literally like eating pasta in tomato paste. Just awful.

Pretty good!  My son really liked this but I was a little skeptical until I tasted it that next day bc it tastes even better the 2nd day!  Made as directed with the exception of adding chopped onion, used 1/4 cup vodka per the reviews, and substituted half and half for the heavy cream (was 1/3 the price.)  Regarding the vodka, I was concerned about being sure to cook out the alcohol so I boiled that a full 2 minutes.  Not much direction there (? ) Funny how some people thought this recipe called for bell pepper!  I would def twice the meat next time. Thanks for the recipe, had a good time trying it!

We liked this recipe very much, it was easy and full of flavor.  I only had hot Italian sausage and either the sausage made it a little too hot or the amount of red pepper flakes was a little too much for our taste.  Next time I'll try it with the sweet sausage as the recipe called for.  One more thing, I added a little more vodka to the sauce because we like the rich flavor that vodka lends to the sauce.

This was delicious! only thing different was I used hot Italian sausages, as that's all we had. Didn't use fresh parsley as I forgot to buy it, but will make sure to next time. This was a very easy to make, flavorful dish, that tastes like it took a lot of time and effort! Served it with freshly grated parm reggiano cheese..Fabulous!

This recipe was really good. The only changes that I made was to add 1/2 cup of vodka instead of 2 tablespoons and I used chicken Italian sausage instead of pork sausage. It was really good and I will make it again.

I really like this pasta and my whole family does too. We make it often since we usually have all ingredients on hand and it's quick and easy to make. I usually just coin sausage instead of breaking it up, I use tomato sauce instead of crushed tomatoes and I halve the pasta. It always turns out perfect!

It was great although I did not really think that the sauce was creamy enough.  Next time I may add a bit of butter to the mixture to bring out the creaminess and a little more vodka for flavor.

I substituted half and half because that's what I had on hand. Added more sausage than it called for, which was perfect. Hubby actually wanted MORE sausage than even I added. Very delicious, all leftovers gone and will definitely be making this again!

I made this the first time exactly as written.  It was 5 stars for sure.  I've also made a reduced fat version... the good news is that is was just as good.  Make with turkey italian sausage (hot), no olive oil, and fat free half and half.  Still really good although the sauce was too thin because of heavy cream substitute. I think if you substitute cream cheese (low fat) for the heavy cream you could get a really nice lower fat version without losing the creaminess.

This was really good! I've never made a tomato cream sauce before and I never will again without the vodka. I modified the recipe a little for experiment's sake. I replaced the olive oil and sausage with coconut oil and kielbasa. I sautéed 1/2 onion and 1 can mushrooms in with the garlic and added parsley flakes with the crushed tomatoes. The sauce has perfect consistency and the crushed red pepper adds a little zing.

It turned out really well, although I might use a red chili pepper vodka next time. Also, one modification I did make, based on some other reviews, is that in addition to the crushed tomatoes, I also added a jar of pasta sauce. Thinking fresh basil could also be a nice addition, but all in all, well received by my husband, and I liked it too.

Make a few adjustments, and this dish gets better! I did this recipe a bit differently than instructed. The first time I used cream, but it just didn't thicken correctly and I wasn't as big a fan of how it shaped the dish--it made is very liquidy and took the flavor out of the meat and vegetables. So the second time I did not use the vodka or the cream, and it tasted very good! The canned tomatoes adds a natural sauce to it, so adding cream isn't necessary. I also added cut up green beans, peas, and mushrooms to give it more flavor and more of a nutritional value. I also substituted the Italian sausage for poultry Italian sausage (note: it taste just as good with tofu, for my vegetarian friends!). Lastly, as I'm sure everyone knows, you can use whatever pasta you want! Enjoy!

The sauce itself was pretty good, but I added sweet italian sausage, which I think was a mistake. If I were to make this again, I would either leave the meat out or try some bits of bacon instead.

Used Italian chicken sausage and turned out great. Made enough to freeze for a no cooking night.

Made it tonight using some suggestions from other reviewers. I started with panchetta before cooking up the sausage. Also increased the heavy whipping cream to 3/4 cup and vodka to 1/4'cup, increased red pepper to 1 tbsp, added frozen spinach and topped with fresh shaved parmesan cheese. My husband and I loved it. Definitely a make again.

I am sure this recipe would be great as it is but I made just a few changes to accomodate what I had on hand. I used a half pound of 97/3% lean ground round and a half pound of ground sweet Italian turkey sausage,canned tomatoes with Italian seasonings, a generous helping of bottled Italian seasonings, and a half cup of fat free half and half instead of the whipping cream. In addition, I had some packages of the red pepper flakes from the local pizzaria and I used 3 of those. I will definitely make this again.

This went over well with everyone at my house (me, my husband, and our almost-2-year-old). It's not the most memorable pasta dish I have ever had, but it's a solid, good meal.

I made this without the sausage because my boyfriend and I are vegetarian. I increased the salt to one teaspoon because I omitted the sausage, and served it with cheese ravioli (instead of penne) to mimic the pasta with vodka sauce at Brio. I also added a few tablespoons of fresh basil. It was delicious and my boyfriend wants me to make it again. I've never made a vodka sauce before and this was very easy! I don't know if this made a difference, but I used San Marzano crushed tomatoes. YUM!
EDIT: Forgot to mention that I also added an additional four cloves of ROASTED sliced garlic right at the end (with the parsley and basil) to mimic Brio.

Used veggie sausage since we are meat-free.  My husband is not a big pasta fan but he gobbled this up.  I did add an onion with the garlic.  Also used half and half and increased the vodka to 1/4 cup.  Nice and spicy!

Great recipe. In the future, I am going to double the amount of sausage, the sausage gets lost in the sauce. This time I increased the vodka to a 1/4 cup, doubled the amount of whipping cream and then I added some sugar to make the sauce sweeter. Even my picky three year old loved it.

This was fabulous!! I did add 2 diced shallots and 1/2 red bell pepper to the sausage while it was browning. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it was a hit with both my husband and 17 year old son. Definitely a repeat! Can't wait to try the leftovers.

Very tasty and easy to make.  Makes a lot!  We followed the recipe to a tea - except we didn't use vodka.  We didn't have it and it was  a big expense.  We subbed water for it and still thought it was great!

Had gone to Costco and had bought some Vodka, so I thought I would give this a try. I had heard of Vodka sauce but never made it. I add more Vodka and Beef broth and cream along with Thyme and Garlic and it was great!  My husband came in and said he would NOT LIKE this but when he tried it he loved it. Keeper and easy. Thanks

This recipe looked good in the pan but was not. It seemed to be very bitter. I don't know if adding some sugar would have helped but it just had a wierd taste and I followed it to the letter. Unfortunately, I had to dump the rest of the pasta out because we didn't like it. Will not make again.

This turned out great! The deli didn't have sweet sausage so I used spicy and didn't edit any of the other ingredients. It turned out super spicy with a kick! The bf and I liked it a lot. Will definitely try again with the recommendations to up the vodka and cream content. Overall very good!

Loved this recipe!   I omitted the sausage (vegetarians in the family!) and it was still wonderful!  I substituted half and half for the cream, and didn't notice the difference.  Next time I might add sautéed mushrooms to add the texture lost with the sausage.  This recipe will become a staple for me!

this was a great recipe for a beginner like myself. I used closer to 7 cloves of garlic (just because I love it) and a wine over the vodka. Also tripled the red pepper flakes. the sauce tastes similar to olive garden's shrimp mezzaluna-- definitely a keeper!

I made this dish for me and my husband. It was easy to make. I made a few changes which included adding 4 oz. of cream cheese, half pint of half and half, and an added splash of vodka. When I make this again, I think it needs some onion and lots more garlic. Even tho I added more vodka, we could not taste it, so if you don't have any I think it would be fine to omit it and still have a great dish.  This dish was really creamy and hearty when I made it, but the next day when we took it to work it was even better. So, make plenty for leftovers. I would make this dish again but,it's not restaurant quality like some folks say, but it is pretty good.

A great recipe!  I always add a diced red pepper and a diced half onion with the garlic, and ignite and reduce the vodka before adding the tomato to the pan.

Absolutely delicious! My family loved it and it made me very happy. I did change one thing though, I didn't have Vodka so I used Sherry. I've already made it twice. Oh and I added spinach this time and it was delish! :D

Outstanding recipe! Following another review I added 3oz Pancetta diced browned it lightly, added the sausage and browned the two.

Made this for our bowling league Christmas party.  I went completely.  I had to add some ingredients because I tripled the recipe and added the sauce too early to the pasta and it thicken up.  By adding V-8, more vodka and cream with franks to give it a kick I got to the right consistancy of sauce.  Great recipe.

Great dish! The only thing that I did differently was use hot Italian sausage (3) and use 2 cloves of garlic instead of 4. 

Will definitely make again.

Excellent recipe. The only thing I did differently was thicken up the sauce with some flour and milk just priorto sving. My wife absolutely loves this recipe. A real winner!

This was a great recipe. Easy to prepare and delicious. The only changes I made were to cut way back on the oil (1-2 tbsp was more than enough) and omitting the salt. Otherwise, I stuck to the recipe. This is definitely a new favorite. Thanks!

It was great! The spicy vodka sauce was just the right amount of spice, creaminess and tart (from the tomatoes). My housemates and boyfriend loved it!

This is incredible! I did change this a little. I made the pasta first and was worried about it sticking together so I poured some olive oil on it and mixed it up. I fried portobello mushroom first, then put it on the side. I followed the rest of the instructions to make this. (For those concerned about the heavy cream/half and half turning, it doesn't). I used half and half instead of heavy cream, which I doubled because it still looked very red. I doubled the vodka too. I added the portobellos at the end and then put it on the pasta. My family and I love it! Delicious!

My only complaint is that I would put even MORE garlic in it, but it is fabulous, otherwise as-is. I doubled it and will be enjoying it for several more meals. Quick & just lovely!

I was looking for something to do with the hot Italian sausage links I had cooked, a can of crushed tomato and some julienne red, orange and yellow mini peppers sauteed in olive oil. This was a great recipe, easy and so delicious!! (changes made to accommodate what I had on hand). Sliced Hot sausage instead of red pepper flakes and not out of casing..garlic powder added to tomatoes instead of fresh sauteed garlic. Dried parsley. Sour cream instead of heavy cream. Additionally, a couple pinches of sugar and white wine instead of vodka. Exellent!

It was good, but needed something else, so I added some parmesan at the end. Also took the advice of others and used 1/4 cup vodka and only about 1 tbsp of olive oil. Also used half pound of sausage and it still didn't overwhelm the dish, and I couldn't use teh entire amount of cooked penne because it didn't make enough sauce.

We loved this! I doubled the amount of sausage because we like our sauce to be hearty, but it was super easy and delicious. Served with some fresh grated parm cheese and delicious bread. Will make again!

I followed the review that omitted the oil and fried up 6 slices of pancetta instead also increased the vodka to 1/4 cup & the cream to 3/4 cup - it was really good!!! Next time I'm making double the sauce though since the pasta really soaks it up by the next day...Thanks for this recipe, I will definitely be making this again! :)

So good for being so simple! Just the right amount of spice. I think it could use one more sausage and I added a couple more garlic cloves. I didn't think it made enough sauce for a pound of pasta so I dished up individual portions instead of mixing all together.

This was a very easy meal and a big hit at my house.  Everyone loved it and it was easy to make.  I accidently used plain whipping cream rather than heavy whipping cream and the sauce was a little runny.  I just used a spoon to eat it so as not to waste any of the sauce.  You would never know there was vodka in there if no one told you.

So YUMMY!!!!!   I didn't have vodka so I substituted white wine.  I also used half of the red pepper flakes and double the sausage (I used chicken sausage).  I just eyed the olive oil but I think I used less than the 1/4 cup called for in the recipe.  My family LOVED it!  I will definitely make this again and again.

This was really good and tasty! my only suggestion is, after cooking the sausages, remove the the grease before adding your sauce. 
Instead of that I made everything as is and it turned out great.

Good sauce with one minor exception.  I've never understood adding vodka to this sauce.  It adds calories without any added flavor.  White wine would be a better, more worthwhile addition.  Even without wine, it would be good.  Just don't bother with the vodka.

Excellent and easy. I had a partial can of tomato paste and I added that and 1/4 cup of citrus vodka, and 1 c of the heavy cream.   Just as good/even better than many restaurant pasta dishes.

This recipe is really nice. Way better than the bottled stuff at the store. Added a few italian seasonings into the tomatoes. Really easy week night dinner.

Great recipe!!  Easy and fast.  The only thing I do different is add onions right when the sausage is almost done.

Followed the recipe but added steamed asparagus to the sauce when adding pasta.  This first attempt was very tasty, the asparagus added some nice texture and a nice flavor.  I would prefer a little more sauce, so next time will incorporate suggestions made to increase the cream and vodka.  Also plan on starting with the suggested pancetta, as it is a generally a staple in Italian sauces.  Look forward to it.

This recipe is fabulous as written.  However I have made personal variations because we like spicy foods.  I used spicy Italian Turkey sausage (mine come in packages of 4 or 5 links) - cooked it in a nonstick pan therefore eliminating the oil there and instead used a little evoo in the pasta itself.  Also used extra vodka and pepper flakes and no parsley.  Leftovers are even better the next day!

Made exactly as recipe states.  Good, but definitely not enough sauce for 1 lb of pasta.  I sauced about 3/4# and it was still fairly dry.  Will definitely double sauce or half pasta next time.

This was excellent and very simple to make.  Wanted to use up a small carton of whipped cream I had on hand. Other than using sundried tomato basil chicken sausage I didn't change much about this recipe at all.  Added in some fresh herbs (basil, oregano, thyme, Italian parsley) that we had leftover from a previous meal.  I thought it rivaled anything I've had before at Noodles, etc.  Would definitely make it again.

We generally are always looking to try new recipes, and we have very few that we make over and over again.  This is one of them.  I would say this is our favorite Friday night recipe that we go to a lot when we want to make something but don't want to spend too much time on it.  We use spicy Italian sausage instead of sweet Italian.

Wow! This was fantastic! The sauce has a very distinct "zing" to it. Very easy to make, and very inexpensive. I am going to attempt to can this sauce in the fridge for even easier meals.

I loved this recipe so much I made it like every week and we got a little burnt out on it.  I make fried shrimp and throw that in, which doesn't disturb the flavor of the dish like sausage does.  Delish.

Excellent recipe! Easy to make and extremely delish! I added Asian brand Chili Oil, as we like a kick, and substituted Shrimp instead of sausage. It made a lot of sauce - which was perfect for dipping hot buttered rolls. Sent this recipe on to friends as it was so easy and tasty! Will be sure to add to list of make agains!

This was one of the best pasta dishes I have ever made!  We kept the sausage seperate as we were serving vegetarians as well and just placed it on top of the sauce.  Everyone loved it and I can not wait to make it again!

Very tasty, but not extremely flavorful.  I will add more spices next time.  I did not use the sausage and that might have taken away from the flavor, but we chose to avoid the grease.  Also followed one of the other reviewers in using half-and-half with a tbl spoon of corn starch.  Will definitely be making this again!

I love this and have now made it multiple times.  The last time I used gnocchi rather than penne and had too much sauce, so I double the pasta.  I could take or leave the italian sausage, but that is a personal preference, not a reflection of the recipe.

score!  I was looking for a way to use up the last of the garden tomatoes.  This was a hit with my very picky husband.

I've made this and its SO WONDERFUL. The only thing is that I left out the whipping cream and added some other seasonings. When my mom tried it, she said the first bite, she thought she was at the olive garden. :-)

This recipe was great. I tried to make a healthier version using half and half instead of cream,  turkey sausage and whole wheat thin spaghetti.

We just tried this recipe tonight, I was so impressed, I love this dish in the restaurants and this tastes amazingly just like it! I added some diced olives and a bit of oregano for extra flavor. My husband did all but lick the plate that is a winner in my house! Thank you so much for my new homemade favorite!

Very delicious!  This was simple to make and didn't take long at all.  I used rigatoni instead of penne and added a little more vodka than the recipe called for.  I will definitely make this again!

Had slight trouble with the sauce the first time--make sure your pot is on LOW heat--mine burnt on the first attempt...After I fixed that glitch, the sauce was delicious, slightly spicy, and perfect over chicken. My boyfriend is begging me to make it again.

Definitely a great meal! I added chicken and used ground Italian spicy sausage and it was amazing. We like it spicy in our house so this was a terrific and very filling meal.

Best thing I've ever made.  I used this recipes as a base.  I actually had leftover ham to use.  So, I just eliminated the oil and put the ham in to simmer with the other ingredients.  I also used egg noodles (works better with a thick sauce ) and folded in a couple handfuls of babyspinach at the end (just tossed until wilted)  Excellent

So good. Definitely comfort food. I overdid it on the spice  by using hot Italian sausage and red pepper. So next time I think I'll use the hot sausage and no red pepper.

Delicious! My husband and I made this last Friday night. We substituted white wine for the vodka, since neither of us are big vodka fans. We also took out the sausage and added spinach, mushrooms, and shrimp. Definitely better than restaurant quality.

The adults loved it but the kids didn't. Therefore, I can't give it a 5 star. I am not sure if it was the vodka or the red pepper they didn't like. My kids LOVE sausage so I was completely beside myself when they said they didn't like it. My husband and neighbor gave it a 5. Maybe its more of an "adult" recipe. Thanks! It was delicious to the adults!

Was a major hit. The only difference was that I didn't use the sausage (not my family's favorite)... I served it with grilled chicken, which was wonderful.

Always a good choice to make this dish!  It's satisfying and comforting and super easy.  My fiance told me I can make this as much as I want, and he's picky.  I always add about a tablespoon of sugar in with the crushed tomatoes.

A good basic vodka sauce base.  I thought it was missing a depth of flavor which I will continue to work on.  Recipe is a good jumping off point from which personal preferences can be added.

This has been a go-to dish for my husband and I since I tried it three years ago! We followed some of the suggestions and like to add red peppers, onions and even some fresh spinach and use fat-free half and half to make it a bit healthier!  Great recipe!

This was awesome.  I added a little bit extra red pepper since we like spicy.  Also followed the 1/4 cup of vodka, 3/4 cup of cream that another reviewer posted.    Other than that, just followed the posted recipe.  Could probably go for a bit less oil next time, but still 5 stars for sure.

I really liked this recipe.  To cut down a bit on calories we used sweet turkey sausage and half and half instead of heavy cream and couldn't tell the difference.  I also used dried parsley as I didn't have fresh on hand.  I used canned chopped tomatoes instead of crushed.  My kids loved it!  Next time I may add another smaller can of tomatoes to make more sauce because it is SO good!  I will definitely make this again!

If I could give this recipe more than five stars I truly would.  It is restaurant quality, in fact it is just as good as the Vodka tomato sauce I adore at Maggiano’s restaurants in Chicago and Naperville.  I did make a few changes, not because the recipe required it, but basically to allow for my own pantry ingredients.  I used chopped diced tomatoes, not crushed and used Gnocchi as my pasta of choice.  I also used a griddle to cook the sausage so managed to cut out the ¼ cup of olive oil, once cooked I added the sausage, garlic, tomatoes, red pepper flakes to a dry skilled and followed the rest of the recipe as written.  This really was one tasty meal.  Thank you for sharing!!!

My daughter said a five and hubby said 4 so it actually scored a 4.5.  It's very good but not my favorite on the site so made it a 4.  My daughter doesn't eat sausage so made it with ground italian style turkey.  Maybe with the italian sausage it would of been a 5.

Amazing!! So much bang for the buck with both cost for ingredients and time spent in the kitchen. I have tried to make similar dishes with premade vodka sauce and it just doesn't compare. This truly tastes better than something I would order at a restaurant. Will definitely make again.

This is sooo delicious!  I was too busy running around the house to try this one night so I chopped everything up and had my boyfriend put it all together---that's how easy this was. HE did it :) I will be making this again this Sunday for about 12-14 people.  So easy, so quick and delish. Will become a regular dish in my house!

Delicious, and so easy! I only spent about $7 on the ingredients (already had oil, red pepper, vodka, parsley from the garden, and Parmesan cheese), so it's also really inexpensive! A+

Amazing!! My husband, toddler, and myself loved this. Made a half recipe for us 3. Wanted to make a veggie version, so omitted the sausage. Added 1 cup chopped fresh mushrooms at the point it has to simmer for 15 min. and added 1.5 cup chopped fresh spinach at the end right before adding pasta, stirred until wilted. Really great. Toddler gobbled it up and had seconds!

I wish I could give this recipe 25 stars!!  Double the sausage, use rigatoni, I didn't have any vodka, so I didn't use any and I prefer basil to parsley so I used that instead.  Otherwise, I followed the directions and it has incredible flavor! I will make this again and again! Thanks for the recipe.

I've made this for so many years and people and they all love it and ask for the recipe! When I make it I normally buy the italian seasoned crushed tomatoes in a can and its best (in my opinion) to use sweet italian sausage (chicken sausage is even better!). Be careful with the red pepper flakes because that is what makes it mild, hot or extreme! This is a keeper!

I made this tonight for my husband and family and it was a hit! My 6 year old said it was delicious. My husband doesn't like tomato cream sauces, but he went back for thirds with this recipe! I substituted sweet turkey sausage and it came out great. I plan on making it for an upcoming party this weekend.

This is a good compromise dish for us, in that I love a cream sauce and the rest of the family likes a red sauce.  It's not something we have often, but it get's solid good marks when we do have.

This recipe was great! I loved the addition of the sausage. We really like spicy, so I added some extra crushed red pepper, which was definitely not necessary. Follow the instructions when it comes to that.

I am typically very fussy about my sauces and rarely find one I really love, but this one was wonderful! It tasted delicious and was very easy to make. The whole family loved it...we will definitely be making this again! Our only variations were light cream instead of heavy about double the peppers. It wasn't particulary spicy otherwise. Overall an excellent dish and one I will definitely be making again!

Tastyyy!! I used to purchase store bought vodka sauce and just add sausage to it, but the other day I caved and made it this way. Very good, I couldn't stop tasting the sauce! The only thing I changed was I used hot italian sausage, as I like mine very spicy. It came together beautifully, and quickly too. A simple dish that I will be making very often :) Thanks for sharing!

This sauce was really good. I made exactly as stated and topped with some Italian Cheese and fresh parsley before serving. Served with "Sesame Green Beans."

This sauce was great! I made the Quick Gnocchi from this site and needed some sauce. I made this with turkey sausage and chopped spinach and once it was done, added a couple small palms of Parmesan cheese. Very good. I will make this sauce again.

Excellent sauce! I made mine vegetarian and it was delicious! Sauteed the garlic and red pepper flakes until the garlic was golden, added tomato paste as I don't like chunky pasta sauce, and added a little over 1/4 cup vodka.  Otherwise I followed directions.  The tomato paste definitely did not have enough liquid in it and the sauce was too thick, so I ended up adding an entire pint of heavy cream and nearly an entire pint of half and half.  Tossed it with home made gnocchi and it had a delicious sweet taste to it.  Makes a large batch so I froze half of it and have been using about 2 tablespoons of the sauce per serving of pasta. You don't need much of it at all!!  Will definitely use crushed tomatoes next time instead of tomato paste.

This was excellent.  Next time I'll add an extra sausage link to the recipe as well as some spinach and maybe a bit more cream.

I really liked this recipe.  After making it once though I made some minor changes.  Used more sausage and used hot sausage rather than sweet.  I doubled the crushed red pepper.  I added spinach.  Delicious!

Very good...I add onions in with the garlic, and use 3 or 4 turkey sausage links. Also, one can of tomatoes and one can of tomato sauce makes this a little creamier. And I use lowfat milk instead of heavy cream (need a little more than in the recipe)

I like to add green peppers, a whole lot more garlic, fennel seeds, a touch of sugar, and sometimes some ground beef. This recipe works as a vegetarian recipe too - substitute Boca Italian Sausages and Boca crumbles for the meat and it's still great. Tastes awesome cold too.

This is my favorite entree and it is super quick and easy to make!  If you like creamy pink sauce and sausage this is the place to go, i enhanced with more garlic and pepper but just to taste.  Worked great!  Served with Arugula/feta/strawberry salad :)

This was excellent! I barbecued the sausages because I'm a vegetarian and didn't want it in the sauce, but the sauce was delicious! I can't wait for leftovers!

I thought this recipe was excellent but I added a couple things to improve the flavor. I chopped up one whole onion and used 6 cloves of garlic instead of 4 and sauteed them in the olive oil. I used 3 regular Italian sausages with the casings removed and 1/3 lb. of proscuitto with the onion and garlic. I used the one can of crushed tomatoes but didn't feel there was near enough sauce so I used almost another whole can as well. I used half and half with cornstarch to thicken instead of the whipping cream to cut calories and upped the vodka to just over 1/4 of a cup. We like things spicy so I used 2 T. of the crushed red pepper and added half a bag of fresh spinach and about a cup of fresh parmesan in the last couple minutes. I served it with whole wheat penne pasta and it was fantastic. I will definitely make this recipe again.

It's a little different from our familiar sauce and tasted good.  I doubled the amount of sausage but I think I can even add more next time.

Wow - this was REALLY good!  I made a couple changes to try to lighten it up a bit.  Instead of 1/2 c heavy whipping cream, I used 1/2 c half n half that was mixed with 1 teaspoon of cornstarch.  Also, I added chicken sausage.  Since there are just 2 of us, I didn't use the 1 pound of pasta the recipe calls for, but still used the same amount of everything else.  Next time, I may stir in fresh basil instead of parsley.  Oh and I definitely added more than 4 cloves of garlic - can't get enough garlic!

Oh my gosh! This was awesome! Easy & delicious you can't beat that combo. I did an ingredient search and this recipe fit what I had on hand. I was out of vodka and used a little wine instead. I only had half & half instead of heavy cream. I also used 3 cans of 14oz diced tomatoes. I used homemade Italian Style sausage (by lee fogle from this site) Don't think it could be any better. I am curious to try it with vodka. Maybe next time, because there will be a next time!

We liked it.  The sauce is better than the store bought jars of vodka sauce, which I find bitter.  This is a nice change from regular sauce which we eat alot.

This was very good.  I cut down on the red pepper to probably less than 1/4 tsp. I also increased the vodka to 1/4 cup and the whipping cream to 1 cup per other reviewers.  I used a package of sweet italian sausage links.  I cut out the salt altogether and added approximately a tablespoon or two of sugar to cut down on the acidity of the tomatoes.  Added about 1/4 cup of grated parmesan to the sauce as well.  Will make again!

This pasta got rave reviews from my Italian parents who grew up on pasta. I had hot italian sausage and added more hot peppers to this dish.  It was fantastic.

I actually give this a 4.5 stars as i liked it as a 5 star, but my wife only gave it 4 stars. We used chorizo sausage and also added sauteed shrimp. the sauce itself was very flavorful and creamy. I rarely use crushed tomatoes, but they werfe wonderful as a base.  As many others have said you do really need to up the vodka amount if you want to taste it throughout teh sauce. We used 4 T, double the amount the recipe calls for, and we really could not taste it that much. Others have said that their is too much parsley, but my wife and I can't get enough of fresh herbs, so we loved the amount. Only other real modification was that we used angel hair pasta as that was what we had at the house. e will definatley make this again and maybe incorporate some mozzarella or provel into the sauce as it simmers. Thanks for the recipe.

I gave it a five because it tasted great, it is really easy to make and takes a relatively short time to make. Also, it requires little clean up and I will have enough leftovers for my boyfriend and me for the next couple meals.   I added about a hand full of chopped onion as well as another half a table spoon of vodka. It was a little spicy for me, but I'm a wuss when it comes to that, so I'm probably going to reduce the crushed red peppers by half a tablespoon. Additionally, instead of sausage I used Tofurky Italian sausage which really held well to the meat texture, I was quite surprise since this was a spare of the moment buy from this brand. I also didn't have parsley which didn't really seem to matter much. I then topped it off with some cheese Italian blend cheese, which helped tone down the spiciness as well as gave it a nice texture, and I will definitely add more next time. This is a great student meal that makes a lot for fairly cheap. Well sans the vodka part.

This was ok.  I was tempted to use spicy italian sausage, but decided to stay true to the recipe and used the sweet. I wish I'd used spicy, I think it would've been much better.

One of the best recipes I've ever made! I made these changes: 12 oz penne pasta, EVOO - enough to coat bottom of pan, 6 cloves garlic,  1 small onion, chopped, 2 (14.5 oz) cans diced Italian diced tomatoes, 1/4 cup vodka, 3/4 cup heavy cream, simply the best ever so good!

Delicious, fast and easy! As good as any I've had in a restaurant. I took the suggestions of other reviewers and used 3/4 c. heavy cream and 1/4 c. vodka. I also used spicy sausage and increased the garlic. That gave it just enough heat for me, but might not be enough for people who like their food extra spicy. Definitely use less olive oil, I used 2T and that might have even been a little too much.

I followed the recipe's instructions exactly (except for using mild Italian sausage instead of sweet), and it turned out wonderfully! My husband (the picky one) absolutely LOVED it and had seconds. He's super-excited to have it again today for lunch.    Things I might change next time: I question if the 1/4 c. of EVOO is really necessary - I think half of that or even less would do the trick.  I also would have added an extra link of sausage (2 just didn't make the sauce "meaty" enough for my tastes).  TIP: Make sure you use a large skillet with sides (or a low-wide saucepan) - I used a regular skillet with sloping sides and by the time I added the cream & vodka, the sauce was ready to spill over the sides it was so full!

I grew up with an Italian best friend, and I constantly begged her mother to make Penne alla vodka for me... this sauce is much different from the way she makes it, but just as good!  I love the addition of the sausage.. I used hot Italian to add a little kick.  It was delicious!!   It was just my fiance and I, so I made the whole amount at dinner time, had it for lunch the next two days, and still had more to freeze.  I'm addicted!

This is the best vodka sauce I have ever had (and I love vodka sauce)! Better than any restaurant. I will never order this out anymore, because I know I can make better at home. The red pepper adds the perfect amount of heat. I always use around 6-8 cloves garlic- but I like garlic. The 3/4 tsp salt doesn't overpower the taste, but it is unnecessary. 1/4 tsp is a good amount. If you like your sauce meaty, another link of sausage wouldn't hurt. I always finish this too fast, and would double the recipe next time for freezing.

I added extra red pepper and garlic as we really like spicy.  I did simmer the sauce for 30 min prior to adding the wine and cream.  I only had vanilla vodka so I substituted white vine and I didn't have fresh parsley so I used cilantro as someone else had suggested.  It was a very flavorful dish, I will definitely make it again.  We agree that the sausage was a nice addition, but not necessary.  Since there are just 2 of us, and I don't like leftovers, I froze 1/2 the sauce prior to adding the wine and cream and cooked just 1/2 a pound of farfalle.

This was very good; really warmed us from the inside out on a frigid day. I felt the sauce was missing something and added about a half cup of grated parmesan cheese to round out the flavors.

This recipe blew my mind away! It was spicy and creamy, with just the right amount of vodka kick to it to make it irresistible! I have made a few changes to the amounts though. Just to clarify - I am in no way trying to criticise the recipe whatsoever and these are just little personal adjustments to a wonderful dish, if they've helped you I'm glad! 

I'm from the UK so if you have Tesco's - you'll know exactly what I'm talking about! This is the best version I've made so far:

I didn't know where to get the sweet Italian pork sausages so I substituted with 1 pack of Tesco's Finest 6 British Pork Sausages with Bramley Apples (454g). Plonked all 6 (without casing of course) in it.

I added a bit more garlic to the recipe: about 6 cloves instead of 4. I chopped it all up, sauteed some in the oil before adding the sausage, then added the rest of the garlic after the sausage was nice and browned - like the recipe states.

If you're not using any sweet sausages, try adding about a teaspoon of honey before you add the can of tomatoes and then a little sugar before the cream and vodka to give the dish a more complex flavour, if the honey's not enough.

I did substitute the can of tomatoes with regular Tesco brand (not Tesco Value - important to know since the Value cans are very watery and have little flavour) crushed tomatoes with either herbs (that will be basil etc.), garlic or onion - take your pick.

Then I added a tad less cream than the recipe called for but I don't really th

Definitely a good departure for standard marinara sauce! I used only 2 cloves of garlic (they were HUGE), subbed turkey sausages, halved the red pepper, decreased the vodka and half & half, added some parmesan and a few slices of pancetta. NOTE: If you add parmesan & pancetta, back off on the salt. Otherwise, it was great!

You can't really miss with heavy cream and Italian meats. I did modify some things-- I used thinly sliced breseola (Italian cured beef) instead of the sausage. I think this cuts down on the fat a little bit and gives the sauce a nice smoked flavor. Also, instead of adding the vodka to the sauce, I add it to the meat once it starts to brown. This helps lift up the bits of browned meat off the pan (I think this is called deglazing) and also allows most of the alcohol to evaporate so you don't get as much of that alcohol taste.
I also tried adding diced eggplant (about 2 cups) right after browning the meat. Very tasty.

This was fabulous!!  I added extra vodka (1/4 cup) and simmered longer than the recipe directed.  Really easy and entire family enjoyed it.  Also, didn't use Penne Pasta, I had whole wheat rotini in my pantry and that is what I used. Yummy stuff!!  We'll have this again.

I don't eat meat so I took that out of this recipe but did everything else it said except I used rotini twists instead of penne (I like them!).  Great recipe, my boyfriend loved it and told me it tasted like his mother's food (highest compliment).  I don't like spicy foods but this was still good.  My boyfriend loves spicy food and he liked it too.

This was very good. There are some things that I didn't like about it, though. I had cut way back on the amount of pasta and it was still too much. I wouldn't cook this again for myself and the kids, it doesn't reheat real well. If I'm having company, though...!

This recipe was awesome!! but I made some small changes. i'm picky with sausage, so I used lean turkey kielbasa instead of italian sausage. I also doubled the vodka amount. I cooked for me and my boyfriend and he loved it to. I will be cooking this again.

this was my kinda of dinner, qucik easy, on the table with in 40 mins, kids loved it. the only thing i did diffrent was i got the wrong tomatoes at the store, so i used a can of dieced tomatoes, and added some fresh in all so. the sauce was a little thin because of this, but it was delicious despite that. i will definatly be making this again.

Delicious recipe. I used vegetarian italian sausage - I believe it was Field Roast vegan sausage. That was the only change. 
Yummy.

great and simple recipe. to add some more taste, i used spicy sausages instead of sweet. i also added more sausages and more vodka than the recipe called for, just enough salt to taste, and a scattering of dried spices (basil, italian seasoning).

This recipe was very tasty and easy to make. It was a little spicy, so I'll probably cut back just a little on the red pepper next time.

Loved it! a nice change from the usual tomato sauce my fiance and I make. I made this with whole wheat penne, and upped the vodka amount to about a 1/3 cup, and upped the heavy whipping cream amount also (based on other reviews) I used the regular sweet italian sausage, and with the amount of red pepper I thought the spiciness was perfect! (my man always adds extra hot sauce anyways..) great recipe!

This is an absolute hit. I've made it for family, dinner parties and my boyfriend's brother averages three helpings when he comes over and it's on the menu. I add more red pepper since we like spicy. Also, don't skip the fresh parsley, it really adds to it. A

This was great! I wasn't sure I was going to like a vodka sauce without pancetta, but I didn't miss it at all. I ended up upping the vodka to a 1/2 cup and the cream to about 3/4 a cup. The sauce was great without the alteration though, it was just personal preference.

Quick, easy and tasty..that's the cooking triple threat! Whole wheat pasta always and rotini works as well as penne. Used whole milk instead of cream and turkey sausage. It was a hit with my family.

This is a great recipe!  To make it a bit lighter, I used Italian vegetarian sausage and whole milk in place of the cream.  It still came out restaurant quality.  I accidentally used diced tomatoes instead of crushed and that combined with the milk made the sauce a bit runny.  It was so delicious we didn't mind though!  One last tip, make sure the pasta is a little underdone, once you add it to the sauce it cooks up perfectly.

I have been using allrecipes for years now and have never wrote a review. This is one of my favorite recipes on this site. It is so easy and it usually impresses those I cookl for. The only change I make is to use hot italian sausage- it just gives it that extra kick. Also I usually sprinkle the top with fresh parmesan- so good!!

Great, creamy sauce.  There is a local restaurant where I live that makes a dish like this, and this tastes almost just like it!  Need to double the sausage to make sure there is enough to go around with all the pasta and sauce.

I will never pay for this dish in a restaurant again! I can't beleive how incredibly easy this dish is to make, I can't speak highly enough of it. I made it to the letter except for the following: I used a 1/4 cup of vodka as per a preious reviewer and used italian flat leaf parsley instead of the curly variety.

This was really good, but I did make a few changes.  I didn't use any olive oil, IMO it really doesn't need it.  I used fresh basil in place of the parsley, added some chopped fresh mushrooms, and used about 1/4 cup vodka which I added at the same time as the tomatoes.  I also used 3/4 lb. sausage. I let it simmer for about 40 minutes, and then added a little more cream than called for.  I topped it with shredded asiago, and while this isn't my favorite tomato cream sauce, it was a good meal and enjoyed especially by my DH.  Thanks!

Man I LOVE this recipe! This is definitely one of my favorites on the website. Like others suggested, I used half the oil. I don't like sausages so I omitted them completely. I will definitely make it again!

A really good and simple, light pasta dish.  No vodka in house, so just used a splash of white wine-still tasty!

We just love this recipe!!! I made it last night for dinner and my boyfriend just loved it! A few changes for the next time though: 

1/8 cup of oil instead of the full 1/4 cup. It  was too oily and we had to soak some up off the top.

3 sausage links instead of 2. 

Tomato sauce instead of crushed tomatoes.

3 tablespoons of Vodaka and omit the parsley. 1 large can of mushrooms.

My boyfriend liked it so much that he is going to make it for the firehouse when he goes to work tomorrow night!!! This is a new favorite and we will make it again and again.

Really good!  I did make the following changes though: first cooked 6 slices of diced bacon then added in spicy chorizo (no oil) and used 3 TBS of vodka, 1 tsp of italian seasoning and didn't bother w/ the basil  Will definately make this again.

This is my favorite recipe!  So easy to make.  I do use hot italian sausage and put more red pepper in it though.  We like it spicy.  I highly recommend this recipe.

As my son would say, this is just "ok".  Nothing different than any other Tomato Cream Sauce I have tried.  My only change would be to cut down on the Olive Oil, you could see it collecting on the top of the sauce when it was done cooking.

Delicious!  I loved it, my husband had the leftovers the next day and he liked it as well.  Just enough spiciness.  I added a little Italian seasoning and at the end I threw in some shredded Mozzerella.  Very yummy!

I've made this recipe numerous times. My family loves pasta but this is one of their favorite. We use ground italian sausage, tomatoes out of the garden when available and cut back on the oil using just enough to keep the sausage from sticking to the pan when browning.

A good alternative to the usual pasta/red sauce/ meat combo.  I will make it again.  However, I will use half the recommended evoo,  no salt, and a little less red pepper flakes  because it was to spicy for the kids. I will also use turkey sausage and maybe a lighter cream because this recipe is a fatty and of course delicious!

This was a very good meal, however we felt it was more of a "creamy tomato sauce w/ a hint of vodka", rather than the "creamy pink vodka sauce w/ a hint of tomato" that we were looking to duplicate.  I'd make this again...we all enjoyed it...my 8 yr. old son had seconds.  We were just disappointed that it wasn't what we were hoping for.

WOW - best vodka cream sauce EVER! We doubled the recipe for the sauce and used steamed shrimp instead of sausage, and fettucine instead of penne. Also used 1/4 of the red pepper called for so that the kids could eat it. This dish was fabulous and I will never buy this sauce in a jar again!

This recipe was great! Flavorful and easy to make. To make it a little leaner, I used about half the olive oil and Jennie-O turkey sausage. Next time I'd probably use a little more cream to thicken it up, and about half the noodles.

This is terrific!  I make it without the sausage and red pepper flakes (too spicy for my little one) and it is a fantastic side dish.  I also use whole wheat pasta and this is delicious.  You can eat it as a complete dinner with veggies or a salad. This is a staple in our house!  Everyone loves it.

I love this dish.  I make it about twice a month and it's still not often enough for my husband.  I use a 14.5oz can of diced tomatoes instead of the crushed and 1c whipping cream - we like a creamy sauce.  My brother-in-law requests this dish about every time they come over for dinner.  Big hit!

One of our favorites - I usually cut the sausage into bite-sized pieces.  Since I'm not a spicy foods person, I use very little red pepper.

Used Hungarian sausage , one large can of chopped tomatoes and a small can of puree with cream and vodka, made a great sauce will make this one again. You must cook slowly after adding vodka to get best flavour.

We loved this - very close to what we used to order at a neighborhood Italian restaurant.  I used ziti (cause that's what I had) and grilled turkey It. sausage, cut into chunks, I didn't have crushed tomatoes, but diced along with tomato sauce worked beautifully.  Thanks so much, I look forward to doing this again, and following the recipe exactly!

Ok, so I have made this 3 times in the past 2 weeks, LOVE IT.  Last time I made a lasagna out of it, which was AMAZING! Try it, but you really have to SEAL the foil topping when its in the oven bc the alchoal boils out and creates a smokey smelly mess.

Good sauce..I left out the sausage(didn't have any) and added some chopped up sweet onion with the garlic and extra red pepper flakes and less parsley(1/4 cup seems to me to be way to much).  It had a nice kick to it. My husband loved that.  I also doubled everything to have extra sauce and one night had it over spaghetti and the next over cheese tortellini.  Both were delicious.  I wouldn't suggest this if you don't enjoy that extra kick in your dish though-cause this def has that!

We really liked this and used evaporated milk instead of whipping cream for a lower fat content. Probably would have been an easy 5 with the whipping cream but we wanted it to be a little 'heart friendly'. We also used a little less oil because the sausage has plnety of cooking fat. And one more substitution, basil for parsley. Great recipe. Thanks!

This was really easy to make and was good.  I made it with meatballs instead, but any kind of meat would work.

This dish was fabulous! I altered it a bit to make it lower in fat. I didn't use any oil and I used condensed sknim milk instead of cream. It was still great!

It was amazing! My mother who dislikes pretty much any pasta that I make actually loved this receipe and said it was the best pasta she has ever tasted! I added more spicy sausage like was suggested and also added more cream and vodka. The leftovers reheated very nicely.

This is amazing!  I love vodka sauce, but normally my husband doesn't really care for it.  I made this recipe and he told me it was one of the best meals I'd ever made!  He loved it, and so did I.  Great sauce.  Thanks!

This was fabulous!!!  I realized that I had no vodka, so I used 2T. of dry white wine.  I let it simmer a little bit to cook off the winey smell, and it was great!  Even my husband LOVED it, and he won't eat anything "creamy"!

I used the concept of this recipe to create my own delicious dinner.  I didn't have any meat on hand so I did without.  I used crushed tomatoes with itialian seasoning which I thought added a lot.  Also...when the sauce was just about done I cut up some pieces of Brie and let it melt throughout the sauce which made a fabulous texture and taste.  Served it with some focaccia bread.  Great meal.

Recipe turned out excellent...however, I used the full pound of pasta (should have read the reviewers suggestions first!) and it soaked up nearly all of the sauce.  I "veganized" the recipe using soy-based creamer and "Tofurky" sausages, and it still tasted great!  I will definately make this again, just with a little less pasta.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I loved the flavor of this recipe! I was a little disapointed that the sauce was very thin, but it did thicken as it stood. I added a little more vodka, used a little less cream and omitted the pepper flakes because I used hot italian turkey sausage, and diced tomatoes with jalapeno that i stuck in the blender for a second or two. I will definately make this again!

I made this recipe with a few twists, and it turned out great!  It is now added to our "favorite recipes" book.  

I used pancetta instead of sausage, used a bit more cream and vodka than called for, added some fresh ground black pepper, and just used dried parsley.

Great recipe.  I added about 1/4 tsp more pepper and it gave it a little more spice.  Next time I would add a little more garlic and I would skip the whipping cream to make it a bit healthier and stronger tomatoe flavor.

If this was better for me, I'd make it all the time! Followed another reviewer's suggestion of using a thinner cream, which worked out well, and I started mine by browning bacon with the sausage... Great flavour, and plenty of sauce for everyone!

I did this without sauasage and with 2 T dry parsley and it came out great.  It was too spicy for my taste the first night but the second night it had mellowed a little.  My husband liked spicy just fine, too.

It was a nice change from regular tomato sauce.  I used hot Italian sausage since we like things spicy and added extra sausage link.  I also used only 1 tablespoon of olive oil and replaced half and half for the cream.  Overall, it was good.

To die for is all I can say.  My family of 5 loved this dish and that's not an easy feat!  I made double the recipe as we all love extra sauce and it was just the right amount for dinner and some for lunch the next day.  I didn't change a thing except adding parmesan cheese on top.  I am going to make this a lot!

This is the best vodka pasta I've had!  The spicy sausage is what really adds the extra flavor.  I recommend adding an entire pound for a heartier pasta.

This dish is to die for.  I never make pasta with any other sauce after trying this recipe.  My boyfriend loves it too and it is the best simple and "ta da" recipe for dinner parties.  Serve it with french bread or garlic toast for dipping in the wonderful sauce.

This was so good!  I could only find hot italian sausage, so I cut the amount of red pepper flakes in half.  I can't wait to make it again.

This is a great recipe with great flavor; although, I decided to substitute basil for parsley.  In addition, the sausage makes this recipe very rich. I would make it again.

I followed this recipe except I doubled the amount of sausage and used dried parsley because that's what I had.  I used only about a tablespoon of olive oil and I drained the sausage after browning.  It was easy to prepare and it tasted GREAT...I would definitely make this again.

This was soooo good!!! Just what I was looking for! I did add a can of tomato sauce to make it go a little further since I was feeding six people. You don't need to increase the sausage as another reviewer suggested - it's just there to add flavor. I served this over 4 cheese ravioli and it was a big hit!

This was awesome!  A little salty though. I would cut back on the salt. I used two cans of diced tomatoes with roasted garlic and a can of tomato sauce instead of the crushed tomatoes. Next time I'll make this with shrimp!! Thanks!

My boyfriend is a fantastic cook and he begs me to make this meal. 1/2 the oil is needed (oil is also added from the sausage) and we add onions when we add the garlic. My favorite recipe!

This was good but it wasn't something that knocked my socks off. I was expecting something better considering the reviews. Rick Naylor's recipe on this site using pancetta is far better. It still was a good meal but took longer to prepare than I thought it should. Husband liked it because he likes anything with Italian sausage and spice. I would rate it closer to a 3.5 or 3. We upped the sausage and vodka a bit. Also, I put in some butter at the end to see if that would perk it up some. Doubt I will make again.

This is the best Penne Ala Vodka!  I made it for Christmas Dinner (12 servings)along with many other dishes.  The Penne was the biggest hit.  DELICIOUS!!!  I just might make more today.

I omitted the sausage since I didn't have any on hand.  Apparently that's a crucial item in this recipe, as I prepared the rest of the recipe exactly and it tasted awful.

My family loved this recipe.  It is so easy to make too.  I used 4 tbs of low fat creme fraiche in place of the heavy whipping cream ( I didn't have any on hand).  It still had a good creamy texture and the taste was wonderful.

My family loved this!  My husband had 3 helpings.  I substituted regular sausage for spicy and it was great.  I am normally not a pasta person but wanted to try something different for dinner and I am really glad I did.  I will be making this again soon.  Thanks!

Just the right spice!  My friends and I get together about once a week for dinner - this is what I made when it was my turn.  All I can say is that I made enough for eight people; 5 came to dinner and I had nothing left.  Fantastic Dish!!!

This recipe was absolutely fantastic!!!!! This is the second time in two weeks that I have fixed this recipe.  My husband, who is always leary of trying new dishes, was astounded by how good this dish was.  Not too spicy, just the perfect amount of zing!!  The parsley garnishes nicely also.  When I served my husband this dish, he said it looked like something from the Olive Garden. Wonderful!  Thank you sooo much.

This is awesome. I used tomato sauce instead of the crushed tomatoes and left out the red pepper flakes and used spicy sausage instead. I also added yellow and green peppers for some extra flavor. I would make this again!

This was a great sauce. It is easy to make and everyone in my family loved it. My husband who usually complains about my obsession with pasta said that I could make it again and my oldeest daughter who won't have anything on her pasta besides butter tried it and loved it.

We really liked this sauce a lot,  but I found it to be a bit heavy with the whipping cream -- I'd suggest using a lighter cream for this recipe just to thin it out a little. 
Followed JDOWNING's suggestion of starting the recipe with pancetta and omitting the oil and salt, but instead of pancetta (which I couldn't get at my local store), I used regular bacon... Excellent! Just make sure you drain the bacon and sausage really well before you add any other ingredients. 
As for the individual who suggested that doubling the recipe would be better for 4 servings -- Whoa, buddy! I doubled it thinking I wouldn't have enough for myself and the five people I had for dinner, and I ended up serving only half of what I made. I'd say the original recipe serves 4-6 just fine...

This was easy and tasted great. My husband said it was just "good" but I thought it was great. It was a nice change from regular tomato sauce. I did add cornstarch to thicken it up a tad bit. Definitely something I will cook again.

Yum!  I made it without the sausage because I don't eat meat.  It was almost identical to a popular local restaurant's version of the sauce!  I would cut back on the red pepper a little - and that's saying something for me because I like spicy!

This was excellent.  But not spicy like the name suggests.  Definitely use spicy sausage if you expect spicy.  I used sweet and will use spicy next time.  I added a little bit of sugar and spices like others suggested.  I will make this often using a little more vodka too.  Thank you for this recipe.

This is a great recipe--delicious and so easy!  I did find that it did not come out very spicy, though...next time I will add more red pepper or use hot sausage.  Even so, we all loved it!  Thanks for sharing, Starr!

This recipe was outstanding just as is. I made no adjustments and my husband and daughter each gave it a "10." It was easy to prepare and delicious to taste. What more could one want from a recipe?

It might have just been because I let my ex boyfriend make it instead of doing it myself, but I found the sauce to be incredibly thick.  Before adding the vodka and the cream, the tomato paste is supposed to boil, but it never did.  It just sort of spit at whoever opened the lid and burned on the bottom...  It was strange.  Maybe it just didn't like my ex. ;)  The end result was good, but thick.  I'll try it again myself and see if I can tweak it a little

This is one of my new favorite dishes.  I am not a big fan of sausage. It gave it a nice flavor.  It only took me 20 min. to make which was nice.  My boyfriend ate all the leftovers, so that means he liked it.  I didn't even make any changes to the recipe the second time I made it.  It is very yummy. Thanks so much.

I used this sauce with the recipe for Quick Gnocchi and it was just delicious. I was really impressed with the depth of the sauce--it was just like from a restaurant!

This was SOOOOO Tasty!  It was even better than our favorite local Italian restaurant.  I liked the spiciness of the sausage and the sauce was incredible.  I also made the herb bread recipe from this site, which went together very well.

Yummy!  At the last minute I realized I didn't have the red pepper flakes so I added some chili powder and tabasco to the cooking sausage!  It kicked it up a notch and it was AWESOME!  I recieved rave reviews!  Definitely a keeper!

Excellent recipe, my husband keeps asking me to make it again! I used spicy Italian sausage instead which gives it more kick.

This was an absolutely divine dish.  So robust and filling.   I omitted the sausage but next time will add to balance the spiciness.  My husband LOVED this dish. It's better than any other restaurant vodka sauce I've tried.

My husband and I loved this, even our 11 year old did.  What an easy and inexpensive recipe with restaurant flavor.
