Thick, rich and hearty stew!  I put spinach instead of the arugula, and omitted the salt.  Great taste!  Makes great leftovers!

Very filling and flaverful. 
I made this last minute and the store did not have rutabaga, so I added more potatoes.  Also used spinach for same reason.  I used stock not water to add some flavor, but needed to add more liquid than called for.  Vegetables got a bit too soft for my taste so next time I will add them with lentils not barley.  Definately a winner in my book.

My husband and I love lentils and we've been trying to eat an over-abundance of arugula from our garden.  This was the perfect combination. I didn't have barley so I used short grain brown rice, substituted chicken broth, left out the salt, and as another reviewer suggested, added 3 bay leaves, some basil and marjoram. Next time I'll add more arugula and black pepper.  We loved the stew consistency. Served it with a dollop of sour cream.

It was good but needed more flavour. I added some italian seasonning. This is an healthy meal with lots of vegetables so I will probably do it again with more spices and broth instead of water.

Pretty bland, it was hearty and filling, but just didn't have anything special to it.

Very delicious!  I changed a couple of things.  First, I added bacon with the onion.  I added 2 more cups of water and 2 large chicken boullion cubes. I omitted the barley and the rutabaga and added a ham bone.  I also added 3 bay leaves, a tablespoon of basil. and lemon juice from a half of a lemon.  No need for salt.  This version is less thick.  Thank you for the recipe.  FANTASTIC

I did follow a few tips from the other comments. I used broth instead of water, and I did add some meat as well. Very satisfying dish.

Excellent dish!  A great low calorie dinner.  Super easy to make. Because the store didn't have rutabaga, I used parsnips. I used red lentils, which all but disappeared acting as a thickening agent while adding a nutty flavor.  Will definitely make this again.

I made it in the crock pot. I added a bit of salt, pepper, herbs to the recipe. I didn't have rutabaga, added an extra potato and celery. I also substituted spinach for the arugala. I liked it, but my husband isn't a big stew person so I won't make it often.

Loved this dish. The only thing I changed was that I added basil, marjoram, salt, and pepper, an extra cup of water, and I threw in 2 veggie cubes. Delicious and filling!
