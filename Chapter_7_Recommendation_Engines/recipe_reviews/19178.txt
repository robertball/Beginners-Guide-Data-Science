I used the calculator to make this recipe for 12.  I followed the directions given to the letter.  I feel the directions are incomplete.  Once I removed my mixture from heat I still had the consistency of water.  It wouldn't stick to anything!  So I waited for the mixture to cool some in hopes it would thicken; and nothing.  I wish I could contact the person who posted this recipe since the spoon tasted good just could not get it to stick on my apples.

This was a wonderful recipe.  I had no problems with it setting up.  It is a candy so it does involve a lot of standing and stirring before the syrup is ready to use.  I think I timed it at an hour which is accurate to what the recipe suggests.  I think the reviewer below may not have cooked the candy long enough.  I loved the taste.  The extra we poured out on a cookie sheet and broke apart. Thank you for sharing!
