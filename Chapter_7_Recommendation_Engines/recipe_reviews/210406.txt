I made this cookie as directed and it is yummy, however I had a hard time making it into a round log.  It was very runny before it went into the freezer, I think next time I will put the entire batter into the fridge for a few minutes before rolling it onto Saran Wrap.  I stored them in an airtight container with a slice of bread and they were just as yummy if not better the next day.

These are REALLY chocolatey!  I left out the walnuts, but other than that I followed the recipe.  When I mixed the chocolate chips into the dough, it thickened up quickly and I didn't think it was difficult at all to roll into logs.  It was hard to cut into slices later because of the chocolate chips, but they didn't have to be nice-looking slices, so that wasn't much of an issue.  I froze a few of my logs and made some cookies a week later, and they were just as good.

These were pretty good- not the best I've ever had though.  Dough was pretty easy to make, I melted the chips using the microwave.  Hardest part was rolling it into a log. If I were to make this again I would probably just roll them into balls. I reduced the sugar to a little more than 3/4 cup and left out the walnuts.

These are fabulous.  A bit fussier than your average chocolate chip cookie but totally worth it.  When they say the dough will be quite soft, that's a bit of an understatement, but it does firm up in the fridge.  I made the dough on Saturday and baked a dozen then, and kept the rest of the dough in the fridge a few days and it was just as good baked later.  I ended up with about 3 dozen large cookies full of amazing chocolate goodness.

Delicious and very chocolatey. They were terrific even after freezing the log of dough for 3 weeks--just a tad bit drier than original. DO NOT overcook or they get dry and crumbly (still delicious, though!)

Best cookies I have every made. Excellent. Only complaint was that they don't keep long, still tasted good after several days but I ended up with a huge bag full of cookie crumbs because they all fell apart!

This is one of our favorites.  They are a cross between, fudge, brownies, & a super chocolaty cookie.  My advice is to not let the dough set up for longer than about 40 minutes.  If it becomes too hard, for some reason, it makes the cookies drier & kind of crumbly.  We've tried them with pecans also, but the walnuts are a must.  Hope you love them as much as we do.  :-)

If you are looking for a very chocolatety cookie this is the one for you! I didn't end up rolling it into a log but I just stuck the dough into the frig for about 35 minutes before rolling into balls. Then I cooked for 12 minutes. I put the dough back in the frig each time to keep it cold. In addition to the choc chips I added heath bits. Very good!

WOW! These were delicious!!!! I used 1.5 4oz bars of 60% Ghirardelli Bittersweet chocolate bars, 1 small 85% Moser Roth Edel Bitter Kakao chocolate bar, 1/4-1/2 c of 60% Ghirardelli Bittersweet chocolate chips for the dough. I used 1.5 c of Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate chips to mix in. I also used 3/4 tsp baking powder. I left the dough in the fridge for 2 hrs before cutting up. The EASIEST part was rolling it into a log. I just poured half onto a sheet of plastic wrap and just rolled it up by connecting the ends together and twisting it up. That was the easiest part of all.  I will make this recipe again!!!! It's not too sweet, nor too bitter. Just right plus very very chocolaty!!

I'm not a fan. The 'dough' was more like cake batter. The cookies themselves were like eating a great big ball of melted chocolate. Just too much.

Good but super rich! You seriously need milk with these. Anway, the preperation of rolling it to a log then slicing was messy. I would refridgerate for a while then scoop it out and probably pat it down a bit. I don't know. We'll see if I ever make this again.

For double boiler I used my metal kitchenaid mixing bowl - over a smaller pot of boiling water. Removed from heat before thoroughly melted and cooled slightly before adding eggs and other ingredients (to temper and not cook the eggs). I refrigerated overnight. Used rubber gloves to mold into little balls (they will be sticky and messy)and cooked for 14 min so they were more formed.  Roll all at once and place the next batch for the oven on a plate and refrigerate. The omission of salt, vanilla and minimal amount of flour did not affect the taste.
