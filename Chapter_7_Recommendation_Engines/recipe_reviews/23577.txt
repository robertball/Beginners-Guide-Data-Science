Pretty good. I think the brewed coffee should be rather strong for best flavour. Also, the custard never got *very* thick but it set fine. I think this makes 10 smallish servings or 8 moderate ones.

When I decided to make this today, I was a little scared that it wouldn't turn out. However, it was relatively easy to make, and turned out absolutely fantastic! It set up perfectly and tasted very, very good. I did overwhip my egg whites, but that didn't even seem to make a difference. The texture on this is wonderful, almost mousse-like. Please do not be scared of this recipe; it is wonderful!

This is a really good recipe.  I tried it with other liquids besides coffee and it worked out great.

This is very good. Do not judge that thickness of the coffee at first just do as the recipe states and it will thicken up.

This had really, really good flavor but the recipe is kinda ambiguous. No way will this serve 10 people! I got 2 parfait glasses full & that's it. I couldn't get the coffee mixture to thicken up over the double boiler after about 30 minutes so I topped a burner w/ my diffuser & cooked it on that. It still didn't thicken up much & worried me but after adding the whipped cream & refrigerating it, it did set up. I tried umnolding onto a plate but it didn't hold it's shape very well so I spooned it into parfait glasses, topped it w/ some whipped cream & drizzled some coffee liquer over it. Not sure why it's said the gelatin separates, there were no layers to mine (maybe I didn't fold in the whipped cream well enough) but it was tasty nevertheless.

I was very dissappointed how this recipe turned out. Maybe I did something wrong as it turned out lumpy. The flavour was good though and I used a few sachets of Equal (artificial sweetner) instead of sugar but make sure you put it in as the coffee mixture becomes custard. Also the yeild does not make 10 servings more like 4.

Mine didn't turn out even close to what the picture looks like. It was really eggy and lumpy. I followed all of the directions and used the exact amount of ingredients specified.

First off, i would more call it a moose or something, not a souffle. Next time i will brewing the coffee stronger and doing 1 cup coffee, 1 cup milk, i think that will improve the consistency a bit. It had nice flavor served with chocolate sauce and a few raspberries. I ended up adding an extra egg yolk to the custard mixture but that may not be needed with the milk/coffee ration altered.
