I love this recipe. One of my favorite dishes is cold sesame noodles. This recipe might be made with peanut butter, but it's the best home version I've found.  Because I've been living abroad for the past several years, I've had to learn to recreate such culinary memories at home - and this particular dish was the hardest to get just right. I've spent the last two months making this sauce at least three or four times a week, using recipes from all over the internet - including those of celebrity chefs (and if you're interested, Tyler Florence's recipe for sesame noodles  is also really worth trying). But for ease of preparation and great taste, this recipe is just my favorite. If you want to play around with it, you can try adding sesame oil or a little vinegar to cut the sweetness - but I think it's best as it is. Scallions cut on the bias, julienned cucumbers, julienned carrots, chopped peanuts, or toasted sesame seeds all make fantastic additions. This is also a perfect sauce for cracked pepper grilled chicken. This sauce is savory, sweet, spicy, smooth, sticky, kid friendly, fast, cheap, and delicious. Try it!

Excellent, quick recipe!!  Added some chicken, carrots, bean sprouts, and green beans, and it reminded me of the Thai Chicken from The Cheesecake Factory.  A recommendation for a slight change to this recipe:  by cutting out the peanut butter and peanuts, and replacing them with apricot or pineapple jam and lime juice, you get a very Islands-flavor recipe as well.

This is a keeper- tastes just like the Thai noodles that you get in Asia. Watch the garlic though, as some may find it a litte overpowering. I've made it several times and use chunky peanut butter, that way I don't have to use crushed peanuts, and it's even quicker!

I was so happy to find this recipe! Its nearly identical to one which was served in a restraunt where I used to work. The dish was called Thai Chicken. To recreate it I addded shredded chicken breast, julianned carrots and purple cabbage. Really tasty either way!

Was worried the peanut butter sauce was too runny when I first dumped it over the noodles, but after it sat for a few minutes it turned into what I was expecting. Thanks! Went well with the baked sesame chicken on this site.

Great taste!  The Udon noodles were a bit thick. I would use Soba noodles next time.

This one is great just the way it is!  I like a lot of heat, so I have also made it with red pepper flakes, chile oil, and tabasco.  It makes a good one dish meal with two cubed chicken breasts, one red pepper and one or two zuchini added.  Thanks for a real keeper!

Excellent. I would definitely use less ginger, perhaps 1/2 tbl? Also, I didn't have chili paste so I substituted 1 tsp of red pepper.

this was a great, easy to prepare recipe. made it after a long day of work. i will def. make again. nothing gourmet, but a nice thai inspired dish. I added julienned carrots to the sauce while cooking and cooked 3 large chicken breasts, diced, in a skillet with the green onion and a bit of the garlic and ginger as well as some extra chicken broth (takes only a few minutes). I then shredded the chicken into the noodles and added the sauce. Even my dad liked it and he never says much. I also suggest serving it with some fresh lime wedges to squeeze over the noodles just before eating. And I prefer udon noodles. the recipe is comparable to some thai inspired noodles I've had at restaurants. My only complaint is the name of the recipe, which I don't think does justice to the taste or presentation. Not much better, but I would call it thai peanut noodles or something that sounds a bit more appetizing.

I've made this twice, the first time using powdered ginger and garlic, and the taste was average. The second time I used fresh ginger and garlic and it was really good. Used chicken cube with a bit of water both times. Also used ramen noodles both times. Will definitely make again.

I have made peanut butter noodles before but could never get the consistency of the sauce right.  This recipe did it!  It tastes like something from the Cheesecake Factory.  I added julienned celery.  Next time I will also add carrots and chicken and only half of the soy sauce.  The peanut butter sauce was a bit salty for me.

Great recipe, easy and really tasty! I added finely shredded carrots and a can of coconut milk, which combines perfectly with the peanut butter. It was a hit!

GREAT recipe.  Just add the PB to taste, I ended up using half of the amount called for. Also, I doubled the recipe b/c I used all the udon noodles not just the amount called for. I served this with BBQ thai style chicken and made them into kabobs.  It was fantastic. I served 6 hungry people with this and it was loved by ALL.  It is easy too.

I've done this using udon noodles, spaghetti noodles, whole wheat and even angel hair pasta.  Either one is delicious. I add a few drops of sesame oil and a few drops of Oriental Fire Oil and it's just as good the next day. Well balanced ingredients and makes for an awesome lunch anytime!

Wow!!  I have NEVER been a fan of peanutty noodles!  Hated them.  But the man likes this kind of stuff, so I decided to make it for him.  I have been converted!  I doubled the sauce and used red pepper flakes instead of chili paste.  Did not use the onions as he does not like them.  Used chunky peanut butter so I did not have to add the chopped peanuts at the end.  The directions say to cook the noodles as directed on the package.  Well...my package had no english directions, so I proceeded carefully and found that udon noodles cook in about 5 minutes.  To make this a meal, I added about 1 pound of shrimp to the sauce once it was heated through.

This was just ok. The flavours were nice but the peanut butter overpowered the dish a little. Next time I would use less peanut butter and add a little more chili, garlic and a squeeze of lemon juice.

This was such an excellent recipe!  Like the others I changed it up a bit to suit my taste.  I roughly tripled the sauce for double the noodles, leaving some sauce on the side for those that wanted extra.  I used 2 c. veg broth, 1 c. coconut milk, 1-1/2 TBSP pepper flakes, natural PB (bought unsalted and needed to add some sea salt later), juice of 1 lime.  I also included a 12 oz bag of stir fry veggies (will use more next time) and a lb of shrimp that was sauteed in garlic, ginger, olive and sesame oil.  Really delicious recipe that you can tailor to absolutely anything.  P.S.  #1 of noodles was NOT enough to feed 6!

I made this for lunch so didn't feel the need to add meat or veggies. I used linguini, dried ginger instead of fresh, added an extra clove of garlic as well as a tsp. of sugar & I did add crushed red pepper (about a tbp). It was a little thick so I thinned it out some w/ more chicken broth; which also helped tone down the peanutty flavor (was a little strong...next time I will decrease the peanut butter by at least a 1/2 tbp.). I garnished it w/ chopped garlic chives since I was out of green onion & then the choppped peanuts (I'd go easy on those, you only need it for visual appeal).

Really tasty. Although I felt like it needed some salt in the peanute butter sauce. Maybe it was just me, but a tad bit of salt would brighten this dish. I will make again and add just a dash of salt.

I'd like to add my 5 star recommendation to the bunch (as if this recipe needs another glowing review!) I served these noodles with the Asian Tuna Patties from this site. What a wonderful meal! I will be making these noodles again and again. **Add the optional chile paste if you can handle spicy--it really adds to the dish.

This is a wonderful alternative to our standard "buttered noodles" accompaniment to meals.  The biggest kid in our family (my husband) absolutely loved it!

These noodles were tasty. 
I didn't add the hot chili element as we prefer non spicy food most of the time, & added a bunch of chopped cilantro, chopped cucumber, bagged matchstick carrots along with the green onions once the noodle & sauce mixture had cooled. Cooked grilled chicken & a splash of coconut milk is what we will add 
/try next time!
I will also double the sauce next time, we like more sauce & found them to be dry after chilling in the fridge for several hours prior to dinner. I didn't have udon noodles so used whole grain thin spaghetti & that worked great.
Thank you for the yummy side dish!

This is one of my favorite recipes of all time!  I make this almost every week since it 's quick and easy and I almost always have all the ingredients on hand.  I use Chinese wheat noodles from the Asian grocery store.  I also use chunky peanut butter instead of crushing peanuts.  I have also added bean sprouts and carrots.  Delicious!

I used ground ginger instead of fresh (just put some in -- didn't measure), hot chili garlic sauce instead of chili paste and thin spaghetti instead of udon noodles (I might use angel hair next time).  It's delicious!  I tossed in a chopped up chicken breast and some julienned baby carrots and stuck the whole thing in the refrigerator for tomorrow's lunch.  I can tell that I'll definitely make this again.

This was a really good dish and my whole family liked it.  I only put about a teaspoon of ginger and I thought it overpowered the peanut butter taste so I would recommend using less.  I also added more honey because I love sweet and salty combinations.

Easy, quick, and delicious! Surprisingly spicy!! I have no idea how with only two tablespoons of chili paste, but I am not complaining. I love spicy food and this definitely was a wonderful surprise. This dish is so full of flavor. Who would have known!  I will definitely be making this again.

Enjoyed very much. The chili paste is listed as optional, but I think it would have been too sweet without it. I also started with half the recommended amount (of chili paste), then had to double the rest of the recipe as it was HOT to my taste. I've also added ~1/4 tea. of sesame oil at times. This lists as a kid friendly recipe...perhaps WITHOUT the chili paste. Final note: I've doubled this with a bit of flour to thicken for a great sauce for vegetables (kid friendly with cautious use of the chili!). It does okay without soy for those allergic (step up the sesame oil and add a sprinkle of sesame seeds if you wish.) Thanks for the recipe!

I can see why this has so many great reviews. The sauce is the perfect balance of sweet and salty with the peanut butter, soy sauce and honey flavors. The only change I made was substituting the chopped peanuts at the end with some cooked cubed chicken, since I didn't have any peanuts on hand.

This one is definitely a winner.  I made this last night for my parents and they loved it.  I quadrupled the recipe and  split it in half and made one mild and the other hot.  Just a couple of minor changes I did though.  (1) Maybe because I made a larger quantity but I noticed that the ratio of peanut butter was off.  I doubled it, i.e. added 6 tablespoons.  It made it nice and creamy and very peanuty. (2) I added more honey because I used all natural roasted peanut butter, without any sugar.  I think the type of peanut butter is important, and the cheap jiffy stuff wouldn't be too good. (3) added a touch of sesame oil and grated ginger.  (4) I added soba (buckwheat) noodles instead. Plain Italian pasta wouldn't be good good either.  The soba has a nice nutty flavour which compliments the peanuts really well.  This sauce is so easy and flawless, THANKS A LOT!!!

Wow! So tasty. I tasted the sauce as it was cooking, and thought that it needed something. I added rice wine vinegar (same amount as soy sauce), and it was AMAZING! The vinegar cuts the sweetness and adds a savory depth of flavor to the sauce.

I noticed other reviewers added cornstarch to thicken the sauce. That's not necessary. If you simmer it for a while, it thickens very nicely.

I did not have enough udon noodles on hand, so I used bean thread noodles instead (soak in hot tap water until separated, then cook a few minutes with the sauce). Also added cilantro and some ground pork that I cooked with garlic, ginger, salt, & pepper.

Awesome!!!!!!  YOU MUST TRY THIS!!! The only thing I recommend is adding a little cornstarch and water mixture at the end of cooking  to thickenen this sauce up as it is very liquidy without it.

I crave this recipe pretty often!  When I have to I use powdered garlic and ginger.  I also use ramen noodles.  Don't be shy on the peanut butter, it really makes the dish.

I couldn't believe how good this was!  My husband had a fantastic Thai peanut butter noodle dish at one of our fave restaurants and couldn't stop raving about it, so I decided to try to recreate it.  As I can't have peanuts, I used almond butter in place of the peanut butter, and my husband said he couldn't even tell the difference!  Other than the almond butter, I kept the sauce EXACTLY the same.  To make the dish itself more like the restaurant version, I first stir-fried 1 lb. sliced chicken breast with some snow peas, water chesnuts, julienned carrots and red bell pepper, and even with all that thrown in, there was still plenty of sauce to coat everything completely.  When I make it again, the only change I will make is to omit the additional nuts.  I added toasted almonds in place of the peanuts, and they didn't stand out enough to make the extra calories worth it.  By the way, with the veggies and the chicken, this made 4 verrrrrry large portions, and with far fewer calories than you would expect from a nut-butter-based dish (500).  AWESOME RECIPE--Thank you so much!!

So good! I added more peanut butter, about 2 Tbsp extra. Also if you like to add some veggies, drop in broccoli florets to boiling pasta for the last 3-4 minutes of cooking time and drain the whole ting together. Snap peas work nicley too.

Very good!  I make this exactly as written, but I sometimes add some marinated baked tofu and/or edamame for protein (and because they're delicious).  Just throw the (frozen, shelled) edamame in with the noodles for the last 5 minutes of cooking time.  The toddler loves this and so do the grownups.  I've used fettuccine instead of udon and it works well.

Really good and really easy - I like that combo! Took it to a 4th party and it was a hit. One gentleman had spent some time in the far east and said it tasted very much like the street noodles that he used to get from carts.  I couldn't find udon noodles so used fettucini- 16 oz of it (double). But I tripled the sauce ingredients, using 2 parts chick broth and 1 part coconut milk (per another reviewers suggestion).I set aside about 1/2 cup of the sauce since several reviewers mentioned that the noodles started out really liquidy and wound up soaking up the extra sauce. That's what happened - so the reserved sauce will go on the little bit of leftovers tomorrow for lunch. Oh, and I also added a whole cucumber (scraped,de-seeded, and chopped)and two fine diced carrots. The crunch was good. Yum-o!

Did change a bit, doubled broth, 2T. p. butter,1 tsp chilli paste, rest same. Plenty spicy kick for our Midwest palate. Both kids went nuts, hubby lukewarm (what's new)I could eat this everyday. Better hot or warm then cold. Don't store together in fridge. Save sauce for later, mine soaked up all the sauce then was too dry.

If you don't have Udon noodles, spaghetti is a fine substitute.  Throw in leftover roasted chicken for a heartier meal.  I've tried several peanut noodle recipes over the years and this is one of the better ones.

very tasty sauce - I used cashew butter (peanut allergy in our house)and added chicken, and it was great.  I've noticed just about any noodles will work...tonight I used angel hair pasta, but spaghetti or asian noodles (udon or soba) also turn out great.

I couldn't believe how quick and easy this recipe was! I'm vegetarian and it was quite easy to adapt - I just used water and a packet of oriental Ramen seasoning instead of the chicken broth (I'm sure you could use about any flavor ramen seasoning in case you don't happen to have chicken broth around the house and still want to make this great recipe)

This was delicious and really easy. As per some other reviewers/reipes, I juliened some red peppers, carrots, snap peas and cut up some broccoli. I added the carrots and brocoli to the noodles as they cooked to soften them up a bit, then mixed everything together as directed. Simple, fast and tasty, you can't go wrong with  this one. One of my kids wasn't crazy about the texture of the udon noodles, so I may use linguini next time, because the sauce was just great.

Really great recipe.  If you're making it for kids, use half the amount of ginger it calls for.  A little bit too spicy for 5 years old and under.  Try adding small pieces of chicken to it for a main dish.

It's good, but the reviews are right about too much ginger. Next time I'm going to use about 1/3 of the recommendation. But the flavour is still good, so there will be a next time.

This was great. I added a ton of veggies on hand - snap peas, cauliflower, carrots, peppers, onion, celery - and the sauce was delicious on top. Didn't have enough peanuts so just chopped up some mixed nuts. Will definitely use this recipe again.

I used a smaller amount of sugar instead of the honey and a little less ginger, but didn't make any other significant changes. It turned out good, but not particularly memorable.

I never reviewed this but I did make this at one time.  I am not a soy lover and the soy was very overpowering!  Even my daughter who was quite younger didn't like it.  I would try it again only to cut back on the soy to a teaspoon.

I had recently been to the International Marketplace here in town so I actually had udon noodles.  I used Better Than Peanut butter to cut down the fat and added some edamame.  The noodles were wonderful and saved the meal.  I tried a recipe for Asian cabbage rolls from a cookbook that was just awful and if it hadn't been for the peanut noodles, we would have had cereal for dinner.  Thank you Amy, this was great!

Something about this was just "off"... I think perhaps the peanut flavor was too intense. Maybe a different brand (I used JIF) would be better.

really creamy and really delicious!
i used natural peanut butter (the one with the oil on top) and found that the overall recipe wasn't sweet enough so i had to up the honey about 2x. also, i used rice noodles instead of udon (wheat allergy), and added a touch of coconut milk and toasted sesame oil, julienned carrots, bean sprouts, and shrimp on top of everything else the recipe called for. also, i like it extra spicy so i added about 2x the amount of sriracha. when i was cooking the sauce before adding it to the noodles it looked a bit too runny, but do not worry--the sauce will thicken up over time once you add it to the noodles.

Told my boyfriend we were having Chicken and noodles for dinner, boy was he surprised he isn't a big ginger fan but he loved this recipe, I also only used 1/2 of the chili paste, next time I will use both teaspoons. All the spices and peanut butter worked nicely together. Next time I will put my chicken in with the noodles also we had broccoli on the side think I will thought that in as well excellent sauce.

Wow, this noodle tasted better than I thought!  The only thing I had to change was honey because I just used it up, so I substituted it with a tablespoon sugar for sweetness and 1/2 tablespoon maple syrup for flavor.  Also my udon pack was 12 oz, so I only used 6 oz.  I had extra sauce but I poured all of it over udon.  It wasn't too salty or anything but I think 8oz of udon will be perfect, less soupy, but I didn't mind it though.  I like my food spicy so 2 teaspoons hot sauce was great but it might be too spicy for some.  The sauce was done before the noodle was coocked.  Very easy and fast and pretty filling dish.  I'd like to add some bean sprouts next time.  This will be a perfect dish for Asian theme party.  Thank you for sharing.

First time I made this, I did NOT enjoy it. Hubby had two plate fulls, but I feel unless you REALLY enjoy ginger that the suggested amount is just overpowering. It was also my first time using fresh ginger in any meal, so maybe my palate was just sensitive to it. I think with half a tablespoon of ginger, though, it would be a great dish.

YUM! This recipe was GREAT! I didn't make any changes to the sauce. I left out the optional chili paste. I'm sure the recipe would be good with it too, though. I did add grilled chicken to bulk it up and make it more filling. This is a great as-is recipe. I didn't need to change a thing! Pretty quick and easy, too! Thanks for sharing!

It was bland.  I would actually like to give it 3 stars. However, I did not add the optional chile paste, which I think would have helped.  I'll try it again with chile paste, and I think it would be better with some lime squeezed on it before serving.

Loved the taste but it was too runny for us.  Next time I'll prob only use a 1/4 cup of chicken broth to make it thicker and taste more peanut-y

One of my favorite noodle recipes!  I usually add a heaping amount of sauteed Asian mixed veggies and double the sauce, plus I usually just use spaghetti for the noodles since Udon noodles are not available in my area.  I also substitute sweet chili sauce for the hot chili paste and forget the chopped green onions since I don't usually have any on hand.

This was excellent! I only had 1 Tbs ginger, but it was perfect. More may have been too overpowering. I made the sauce before deciding it needed 1/2 cup coconut milk--perfect! I also cooked cubed chicken in the sauce then added baby corn, broccoli, and sweet red peppers.  I subbed bean sprouts for the green onions. Lastly, I served to kids so I left out the chili paste but poured 2 tsp pepper flakes in a ramekin then added a little peanut sauce to them to soften them up. Hubby and I then added this to our individual bowls for some heat. This would taste great with fresh cilantro too.

Made half of this with one pack of udon, it was more than enough sauce. I didn't add the ginger since I didn't have any. It was a bit too salty, next time I would put less soy sauce in. It was excellent though.

Freaking DELICIOUS. One million stars. Heck, two million. One of the best things in the recipe is that all the ingredients give a different flavor (sweet, spicy, garlicky) and so it's very easily made to your tastes... An extra bit of honey, a bit more ginger- all the ingredients have such distinct flavor. I use veggie  broth and chunky peanut butter and red pepper flakes in place of the chilli oil (which I can't find) but   those are my only changes. To the reviewers who thought this was too much Ginger, I wonder if you used fresh? If you use dried ground Ginger you definitely need less. Then again, I love Ginger and can't imagine there being too much. Thank you SO much for the recipe it's a true keeper.

I was worried that the sauce seemed liquidy but, oh well, dumped it in with the noodles...and the starch from the noodles quickly thickened it up - the noodles soaked up the juice and the noodles got more and more creamy and yummy after a few minutes.  I used Japanese Futonaga Udon noodles and natural peanut butter, water instead of broth, omitted the chile paste, used powdered garlic and ginger.  These are fantastic, even though I made minor substitutions.  Thank you so much for sharing the recipe!

I had to scale this up, but the sauce ended up with way too much liquid that I had to evaporate off. And finally the noodles stung of ginger!

We love this !!! DH was so hesitant to try it because he thought it was just weird but he is hooked now! I almost always have a batch of this in the fridge for those teens that drift through our house and are looking for  something quick to eat!  I use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth to keep it a vegetarian dish and add 3/4 C broth instead of 1/2 C because we like the sauce a bit thinner.

This made a great quick dinner with ingredients on hand.  I didn't have fresh ginger, so used ginger powder, used regular fettucini noodles, and to turn it into a whole meal, added chopped green & red pepper, shredded carrot, and shredded leftover roast chicken.  I also added a little sesame oil drizzled over the bowl at the end because we all like that.

Yummy!!!  A new favorite--I've made it twice in three days.  A great, easy recipe that is ready faster than the noodles!  I like to add extra peanut butter and I use chili powder instead of paste because that's what I have.  Highly recommended!

MAKE THIS DISH!!!  This recipe is absolutely fabulous and you are guaranteed to get rave reviews from guests!!!  I served it as a side dish but it was such a hit that next time I will make enough for entree portions, and perhaps experiment with adding protein to make it a complete meal.  I have two recommendations. First, be sure to add the optional chili paste. I used Thai Kitchen's Roasted Red Chili Paste, which I found in the Asian section of my local grocery store. Second, I used Peanut Better's Thai Ginger and Red Pepper peanut butter, which I found in the peanut butter section of my local grocery store.  It contains a wonderful mix of spices, and I'm guessing that it was a nice addition to the recipe.

This was really good - the best recipe I've made off this site so far!  I used thin spaghetti for the noodles and didn't have any chili paste so used crushed red pepper instead.  And to make this a one-dish meal I added a shredded carrot and some chopped brocolli to the noodle water at the last minute of cooking and some chicken to the sauce before combining it with the noodles.  We will be having this often!

This was great!  It tasted just like the Thai pasta from a popular restaurant I love.  I followed the recipe exactly and loved the end result.  Will definitely make again.

EXCELLENT! I was concerned when I read some of the reviews, but my concerns were unfounded. I did a double batch of sauce; I used maybe 1/4-½ tsp ground ginger instead of the ginger root, I omitted the hot chile paste, and I used about ½ tsp garlic powder instead of the cloves. I used angel hair pasta instead of the Udon, and I omitted the green onions (current e coli scare!) and the peanuts as I was out. One piece of advice: While making the sauce, I thought it tasted too strongly of soy sauce. So I added peanut butter and more of the other ingredients to balance it out... That was a mistake, because it NEEDED more soy sauce when it was mixed into the noodles and served. If it tastes a little too soy-saucy, it might be perfect. If it tastes WAY too soy-saucy, it might be a little much. :) Oh, and I also added a fried-up frozen bag of stir fry veggies. This is good cold and reheats decently. Thanks for sharing, Amy! My daughter loves these noodles!

I love your recipe, Amy... and I eat it just the way the recipe states. But in order to get my hubby to enjoy it with me, I have to change it up a bit. He likes me to prepare it with fettucine, no honey, crushed red pepper flakes, add a Tbsp. of lime juice, snow pea pods, sliced honey roasted turkey from the deli counter and I've even added pineapple chunks to the mixture once or twice. >yum

When I served this to my husband, he said that it smelled and tasted like a dish from "Wagamama's," a noodle bar in London.  To me, there could be no higher praise.  This dish was simple, fast, and delicious, and it comes with highest recommendations.

The recipe itself only gets 3 stars from me, however, I plan on making it again and doctoring it up. I'll definitely add less peanut butter. I also added shredded chicken, carrots and lime juice. I suggest trying this recipe but editing it to your own taste.

Very tasty!! I'll be making this again.  I added alittle more peanut butter then the recipe called for. And, the only thing I am going to do differently next time is use CHUNCKY peanut butter.

I tried this recipe because it doesn't use oil like so many do. Although I enjoyed the taste, I thought it needed a little bite and added 1 TBL rice wine vinegar. It was good hot and cold and even better the next day. I may try cashew or almond butter next time to make it a little more exotic.

I was wondering through the Thai recipes and 
found this, while it was printing up I started
putting the ingredients together. In five minutes
I was done and back to computer. The sauce is
fabulous and I will cook up the noodles for 
dinner.

I really enjoyed this. I followed the recipe except I used spaghetti noodles because I couldn't find udon noodles. This was sooo easy and it tasted great! I just need to remember to go easy on the ginger next time because I find the flavor too strong.

This was great!!!! Used Thai Rice noodles (medium width) and tons of veggies (broccoli, bean sprouts, snow peas, and cabbage)
Sprinkled some seasame oil on it right before serving (it burns very easy so don't add it till the very end)
The peanut sauce gets really thick as it sets, so I added a little bit of water and it was great.

Made this for my son tonight, it is his favorite dish!  I love this recipe and add cooked chicken for a little more substance.  I cook the chicken in a frying pan with a little of the sauce poured over while cooking.  Excellent recipe.

This recipe is easy and delicious. I don't have much to eat around the house, so I tried to find a recipe that had common ingredients that I might have on hand. Instead of Udon noodles I just used spaghetti, powdered ginger instead of fresh (since it was not fresh, I used a little less than the recipe called for), and I added a bit of cilantro. A couple of dashes of Sriracha for heat and a couple of dashes of sesame oil really made the dish pop. It came out great!

I imagined the combination of ingredients making a better dish than what turned out. The peanut sauce gummed-up on the noodles 10 or so minutes after combining. The peanut sauce makes or breaks this recipe, and I’ve had better over the years. I like Amy’s concept but it’s back to the drawing boards in search of a peanut sauce more suited to my taste.

Okay, I RARELY submit reviews of any kind, but these noodles are SERIOUSLY out of this world! I was on the fence about trying the recipe, since I've tried several Asian-inspired recipes using peanut butter and have been disappointed each time.  This recipe gets it right on the money.  

I served the noodles to my husband and kiddos, ages 5 and 2, and everyone went wild over them. NOTE:  I used organic peanut butter, which I think made a HUGE difference in the taste of the sauce.  Natural peanut butter would give the same flavor/consistency as organic.  I think anything like Jiff would overpower the flavor of the sauce with a heavier peanut butter/sugary flavor.  I also held off on the chili paste and chose to use Sriracha Chili Sauce on my husband's and my plates after making the noodles.  

I set up everone's plate so they could add their own toppings. In addition to the peanuts and green onions I chose to include some edamame, shredded carrot, seasoned diced chicken, and a lime wedge.  The kiddos loved being able to "make their own" noodles, and I love that it was all healthy choices and delicious at the same time. 

If I could give this recipe 10 stars, I would...can't wait to make it again!

I'm addicted to this recipe -- it's so easy and tasted great. I'm vegetarian and use vegetable broth. Occasionally I'll add sliced celery, cabbage, or any vegetables on hand. I generally make this with spaghetti noodles, though I have used packaged ramen noodles, boiled and drained.

This was a really good blend of flavors - I think a squeeze of lime and some cilantro would really put this over the top.  I used leftover whole wheat linguini, so I was able to whip this up for a quick satisfying dinner in a snap!  Didn't have peanuts so I sprinkled on a few toasted sesame seeds instead.  Delicious!

These are really good, everyone in my family loved the noodles, I used a little more chili paste than asked but we like the kick, and especially with the pasta, is what I used.  They are filling and I doubled the pasta, using two small packages. I had enough for the next day for everyone's packed lunch for 4 people.     Nice and Easy for me.

The ginger and chile paste are a must.  Very good!   Put over my let over spaghetti.  Works best as a side.  I have made other recipes before and the sauce was too thin or the sauce never blended correctly.  No let down here.

Years ago I made "some" peanut butter noodle recipe for my daughter and she has been begging me to make it again, but I couldn't because I had lost the original recipe. After many false tries, this was my latest chance at hitting her "like" button & this was it, beyond it, better than IT. I don't need to look for that "other" recipe now, because this one is the best. Delicious, easier than pie, and well worth the wait.

I have been searching for a good asian noodle recipe for years and have finally found it! I didn't have hot chile paste so I subbed about a 1/4 tsp. hot sauce, used spaghetti instead of udon noodles, doubled the amount of green onions and omitted peanuts but added shredded carrots.  I also added about 2 Tbsps of sugar, I guess I like mine a little sweeter.  Serve this to friends who are usually small eaters and they both had a second helping!

This recipe has changed my life!  I love peanut sauce dishes when going out for thai with my bf.  Now that I have this recipe, I don't need to spend all the money going out anymore!  I do agree that the ginger needs to be cut back.  I also cut back the garlic.  It's important to play with the recipe until you figure out what's perfect for your tastes!

My four year old LOVES this recipe! So do we! The first time we made it we thought it was a little bit too "gingery", so we do cut back on that - to about 1 T.

This was ok.  Nothing special.  If I make it again, I will reduce the amount of ginger, use a thinner noodle, refridgerate overnight, and serve cold.  The sauce was too thick for udon noodles.

This was very yummy and kid-friendly. I also mixed in a bag of broccoli slaw to add some crunch and more nutrition. I'll definitely make it again!

Very good.

I use a little less ginger and slightly more peanut butter to thicken up the sauce. I have made this a few times with chicken and its wonderful, my girlfriend loves it!

This is a really good base recipe.  I doubled the sauce and used half the sauce to cook ground pork in, which I later added to the noodles. I didnt use peanuts, I just used crunchy peanut butter. I served it with spring rolls,my two year old loved itl.

I made this for my boyfriend and we both loved it. I would definitely recommend finding the udon noodles and NOT using spaghetti; the flavor just isn't the same. Also, the recommended amount of ginger may be a bit strong for some people (like me), but pleasing to others (my boyfriend loved the extra kick). Adjust it according to your personal tastes. I also added strips of chicken cooked in sesame oil and flavored with garlic salt, plus some julien carrots. They really made this dish a full meal, perfect for a college student working on a budget.

My husband and I LOVE this recipe and I make it all the time. I add chicken and use fettucine noodles instead of the udon. I also cut the soy sauce to 1 tablespoon and add a bit more chicken broth, pb and honey to accomodate our taste. Excellent!

I've made this twice as written and did not really care for it.  I think maybe too much ginger and I feel like it's missing something - just not sure what.  I won't be making again. sorry.

Wow, this was excellent!  Some reviewers recommended doubling the sauce, but I was using a larger package of pasta and adding chicken, so I tripled it.  I did cut back on the ginger (not a huge fan) and the honey (I thought it would be too sweet).  Perfect!  I'll be making this again and again.

Nice pasta dish,  but you absolutely MUST double the sauce mix.  Once the noodles sit in the fridge they will become very dry, so before you serve you will need to add more sauce, a lot more.  I did not double, when I took them out to serve they were super dry and barely edible, so I quickly made another batch of sauce and poured the whole thing over the top - much better.

I had something like this at a restaurant when I was back home in Minnesota visiting... I was craving it so I looked online and found this recipe. I thought 'what the heck, I'll try it'...it was SO amazingly good. Instead of chile paste I used chili powder and some cayenne pepper. I added chicken and sauteed red peppers.  I recommend this recipe to anyone! So delicious!

This was tasty!  I sautéed some chicken breast and veggies while the noodles cooked, removed them, and then made the sauce to add to everything at the end in order to turn this into an entrée.  Delicious, well rounded, and filling!  This also involved minimal cleanup and came together pretty quickly.

WOW, WHAT A RECIPE! My family loved this dish. Such an easy recipe with tons of flavor.  If you want it sweeter - add more honey, thicker - add more peanut butter, hotter - add more chile paste. So family pleasing that even my infant couldn't resist. This is a ten star recipe.

I did have to change this a little but it was great. I used beef broth (no chicken), left out the scallions and peanuts and used hot sauce in place of the chile paste. My bf does not like chunks of garlic so I took one clove, smashed it and threw it in the sauce so the flavor could infuse. I took it out before adding the pasta.  Very good.

I did not care for this recipe!  There is WAY WAY WAY too much ginger!  You MUST cut in in half or maybe more for this to even be edible.  I LOVE noodles, and couldn't believe that I could not eat this.  I made it exactly as written. Sorry to give a bad review!

This is great! I've made it twice: the first time I used ground ginger, linguini no chili paste, no green onions, no peanuts (but chunky peanut butter), and it was great, but needed a kick. The second time, I used fresh ginger (much better), chili paste (found in the ethnic section - named "Thai Chili Garlic Paste") it definitely added some kick), and thin spaghetti (I think the linguini was better). I doubled the sauce, and added some chicken the I had cooked with cracked pepper. It was amazing, and I will continue making this.

YUM!  Quick, easy, uses stuff we tend to have on hand, and guest-worthy!  Changes we made:  Used a big chunk of ginger to flavor the sauce (rather than chopping it -- I don't care for chewing on ginger, but the flavor and fragrance are GREAT in this dish).  We also added a little shredded cabbage, sugar snap peas, and cubed baked teriyaki tofu at the very end, for a complete protein dinner.  Wonderful.  Will make often!  Thanks!

DELICIOUS!!! I seasoned some diced chicken breasts with ginger powder and cracked pepper and sauteed it, then added it along with julienned carrots and sprinkled cilantro on top with the green onions and chopped peanuts. I personally thought it was plenty spicy with the chili pepper paste, but my husband likes his food REALLY spicy added some red pepper flakes. I also just used spaghetti. Can't wait to make this easy dish again!

My husband has a peanut allergy so I used tahini (sesame paste) instead of the p.b..  I dont' know how many people with a peanut allergy will be looking at a recipe with this title but it was delish!  I don't normally have Udon noodles on hand and cooked this last minute but I just used the pasta I had on hand which turned out to be rotini.  Random I know but if it was yummy with that, I bet you pretty much could use any pasta and have it turn out well.  Oh and I just used some normal onion b/c it was what I had on hand.  I LOVED THIS DISH!

I used sunflower butter as we have a nut free home, and it is excellent.  I never have ginger on hand when I make this, so I guess I can do without it as it is 5 stars the way I make it.  3 cloves of garlic is a bit much for me, I do 1.  Get low sodium soy sauce, once I used golden boy brand, and whoa!!! that was salty!  Sriracha chili sauce is good in here if u like it pretty hot.  For a tamer dish with a medium bite, I use hot chili oil.  Delicious, cheap, fast, this dish has it all!!

This recipe was pretty good. I made it as described. The one thing I wish is that I had chopped my ginger a bit finer. The chunks were too big and when I got a bite of the ginger it was a bit much. I think if I make this again I'll wither do a better job of chopping it or put it in a small food processor to get it extremely fine.

LOVE IT!  I made it a meal by doubling the sauce and adding chicken, sauteed broccoli, onion, and carrot then added fresh bean sprouts and cilantro on top.  This is a must try!

This recipe was decent, but no one seemed to LOVE it. My son wouldn't eat it at all. I can see why people like it, but for me it was heavy and missing something. I don't plan on making this again. I'm going to heat it up and attempt to enjoy it again tomorrow. Maybe I'll up the rating. I didn't particularly care for it cold, but didn't dislike it either. It felt like a lot of work for the end result.

I gave this 4 stars only because I think it's an excellent base recipe. You can add a lot to it, and get a fabulous meal. I used spagetti noodles, and used coconut milk as others suggested. I also added 1/2 c. chopped mushrooms and 3/4 c. shredded carrots into the sauce. I cut back on the chili (i used thai red curry paste) to 1/2 tsp. to give it just a little kick (I have a 3yrold, and she didn't mind the spice level).  I topped with fresh sliced and seeded cucumber, cilantro and peanuts. I grilled a couple of chicken breasts (marinated in soy, ginger, teriyaki) and sliced into medallions over the noodles.

Oh my gosh, this was so great!!  I doubled the sauce and used a pound of spaghetti, the Barilla plus kind.  Did not have chili paste so threw in red pepper flakes.  We loved it and ate every bite!  I think next time I will put chicken and veggies in.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I really liked this a lot.  I've tried other peanut sauces in the past, but this one was by far my favorite.  This was the first time I've had udon noodles, and I didn't really care for them.  I'll use linguini next time.  My sauce was thin at first but I boiled it for a minute and it thickened up very nicely.  If you don't love your food really spicy you'll want to watch how much chili paste you add.  I LOVE spicy food and it was pretty spicy for me.  I will definitely be making this again with different additions like vegetables and tofu.  Thanks so much!

So good!!!  We just finished this for dinner about two minutes ago, and my husband wanted me to review this right away because it was so amazing.  It absolutely beat out any Thai dish I have ever made.  I did not have any chili paste, so I used some red pepper flakes, and it was very good.  Super recipe! THANK YOU!!!!!!!

This was delicious! I absolutely loved this recipe. I subsituted the fresh ginger for powdered ginger. I also used tri-color rotini, it was the only pasta I had. I doubled the sauce and added an extra heaping tablespoon of (chunky) peanut butter. This is good only if your crazy about peanut sauce. I also mixed in some chicken cutlet pieces that I sauteed with olive oil, green onions, garlic, soy sauce and chicken broth. It came out great!

This was a hit with the whole family. And it makes great leftovers, hot or cold. I am going to bring this as a side dish to an Easter luncheon, where I am sure it will go over big. Best of all, by substituting vegetable broth for the chicken, and using egg-free noodles, I can make this for my vegetarian and vegan friends.

Delicious!  I was so sad that there weren't any leftovers...everyone gobbled it up including my 6 and 3 year olds!  Took the advice of another reviewer and added sesame oil and chicken...also added shredded carrots. YUMMY!

This was very easy, tasted great and cheap too.

I added shredded chicken and sugar snap peas to mine and substituted Barilla PLUS spaghetti.  I also made it with low sodium soy sauce and low sodium chicken broth and it needed to be seasoned up with some extra soy once I tossed it with the pasta.

I doubled the sauce amount and had leftovers for lunch!!

I made a terrible mistake with this recipe.  The only honey I had was cinnamon flavored for hot tea.  I used it, and the flavor came out a little strangely.  The taste seemed better after it was in the fridge for a day. It was a good recipe, and I may make it again.  It is a very strongly flavored dish, very sweet.

My family loved this recipe! I did decide to make it on short notice and made due with that I had. I ended up using rice noodles and it was awsome. My daughter loved it and she is 4. I did go easy on the chili sauce.

What a wonderful recipe!  My husband and I really enjoyed this.  I did make a few variations.  I used 4 oz of thin spaghetti and 2/3 of the sauce ingredients.  I did substitute fresh ginger for a little less than a teaspoon of ground ginger.  Did not have peanuts or green onions but added in shredded chicken breast and spinach leaves instead.  It made a wonderful meal!  My husband did comment it did not have enough of a peanut taste, the spiciness was great as was the ginger flavor.  For me, it was perfect.  The blend of flavors was amazing.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

This was good- I would love to give it 5 stars, but every time I make it, it turns out a little different. For example: if you just heat it through, you get smooth, thin sauce, but if you let it heat up a bit more, it thickens up quite a bit. Delicious anyway, and I like to use vegetarian broth as well as a little less soy sauce- 2 tbl instead of 3. Garlic chile paste is pretty good too as a subsitute for the regular chile paste and some of the garlic. I also add a bit more peanut butter- I like sweet, hot and thick sauces personally.

This was a fantastic dish. I made some of the suggested changes. The first being to use chunky peanut butter and to use a little more of it. I fried up some chicken breasts with a bit of garlic. I steamed some brocolli and threw it in when the chicken was cooked. I poured the sauce over all and added some shredded carrots. After letting the flavours blend for a while I spooned the whole mixture over noodles. I don't really like spicy, so my boyfriend added red pepper flakes to his dish.  

We could hardly get enough of it. It was GREAT!!

This is an excellent recipe!!!!  I added a little extra peanut butter and a teaspoon or so of sesame oil.  I tossed the spaghetti noodles into the sauce a few minutes before the meal was ready so it could start to soak in a little.  I served it with the "Yakatori" recipe from this site.  I soaked chicken.  Next time I will try adding carrots as well.  Thanks so much!!!!

This was a big winner with the whole family!  My son liked it and my husband thought they were great.  I, too, enjoyed the taste, which WAS different and a nice change from the usual...actually, it will probably be added to the menu of "usuals" for us!  Thanks Amy!  Oh, and I added chopped uncooked broccoli and really liked that.  I'm sure there's lots of variations possible for this great basic sauce.

Great recipe.  To give it a more adult taste finely slice a bunch of green onions.  Stir fry strips of chicken, then add add most of the green onions (save some for garnish), and add a cup of bean sprouts.  Continue with the recipes using only one teaspoon of honey.  Increasing the chilli paste adds a great zing to the dish.

Excellent!  One of the easiest recipes I have ever made.  I added chicken to mine--just sauteed chickn strips in a little olive oil and then added to peanut sauce.  I must say that the sauce was a bit rich, but I believe that to be my fault, as I did not measure carefully at all.  I'm a "throw in the pot" type of cook, and I was in a super rush when I made this.  Still turned out great!

Not only does this recipe make a YUMMY noodle dish, the sauce is great for making Thai pizza! I usually use about 1/2 the broth when making the sauce for pizza.  Top with cheese, fresh tomatoes, fresh basil and whatever else you like on pizza.... delicious!

My family loves this recipe. Second time I made it with thin spaghetti because that was what I had in the pantry. Also tried adding 1 tsp sesame oil as others had recommended. It added flavor and helped to unstick the noodles. My children don't like really spicy so only used 1 tsp hot chile paste when mixing the ingredients and then husband and I added another teaspoon to our plates. Thanks for posting.

These noodles were fantastic! I followed the recipe as listed and it turned out perfectly. The consistency of the peanut butter sauce looked too thin but after adding the noodles it was perfect. I added some cooked chicken I had on hand to make this a hardier meal. My teenage girls said they would eat it again if I made it.

As a college student who's usually short on both time and money, I've been forced to make some sacrifices to prepare this recipe. Even with ground ginger instead of fresh, jarred minced garlic instead of fresh cloves, Tabasco instead of chile paste, powdered peanut butter, and no peanuts or green onions, this peanut butter sauce is still incredible. I've eaten it on spaghetti, linguini, and rice, and I imagine you could eat it on just about any grain and it would be fantastic. Throw in some chicken and/or vegetables and it's even better, although I don't get the chance to do that as often. I can only imagine how it tastes with all the original ingredients. Hopefully I'll get to make it as it was intended sooner rather than later.

TL;DR: Delicious even when you throw a bunch of cheap substitutions at it. One of my staple recipes from now on. 

(Should also be noted that I made an Allrecipes account specifically to write this review. That's how good it is.)

Proceed with caution. While I'm not a huge fan of Udon noodles (too thick for me) the sauce on this was to. die. for. I just wanted to drink it. I made it just as it is but could see using this a number of ways. While the sauce is pretty thin at first, give it ~5-10 minutes and you'll be happier. Delish!

Very quick and easy! My family loved it! Didn't have chili paste, so I minced the garlic, added chili powder and a little oil, let it cook a few minutes in the pan and then added the rest of the ingredients.

Delicious! I usually lightly saute carrots and a red pepper and then add the the sauce ingredients to them. And if I have any cooked chicken, I throw that in as well. I always double this recipe because my kids LOVE it!

This was a great recipe, quick and easy to make. I did use the optional hot chili paste, and it was a perfect combination of sweet and spicy. Also I have tried it with a couple different types of noodles and chow mein noodles were by far our favorite!

Great basic recipe! I like a lot of sauce, so I quadrupled the sauce portion of the recipe and it was perfect. I used Thai rice noodles and they're so sticky the extra sauce came in handy. Also added the "adult" components some other reviewers suggested and the dish was excellent!

I did not care for this recipe. I have never given anything this bad of a review.  It was everything from the texture of the sauce to the overwhelming ginger flavor… and this was after I cut back on the amount of ginger because I was fearful it would be too strong. Followed directions exactly, looked just like the photo, but the only flavors were peanut butter and ginger.  Really disappointed because I love making Asian inspired dishes and was hoping this would be a keeper.

Made it without the spiciness and using ginger powder from my spice cabinet and I thought it turned out good. Also did not have green onion, but the kids would probably have objected to that, too! Liked it, will make again.

Wow, are these good! Made this morning. I used ramen noodles and I couldn't find on the pkgs. I should have at least doubled the sauce! I'll make more sauce for the rest of the noodles. Subbed sweet chile sauce for the hot chile paste. Didn't have peanuts to add on top. Also added shredded carrots for some color. I'll definitely make this again, probably using angel hair pasta.

I really enjoyed this.  Since I didn't have any udon on hand, I used spaghetti.  Also, I added shrimp to the sauce and served it with asparagus.  Very yummy and not unhealthy!

I've made this several times--we love it!  The only change I make is adding some crushed red pepper (which I already have on hand) instead of the hot chili paste. I think the little bit of heat makes the flavor perfect. And I just use regular thin spaghetti (which I also already have on hand) rather than the Udon noodles.  Thanks so much for sharing this simple and delicious recipe!

We had this with fried tofu pieces and my kids and I loved it!  It's a much more complex flavor than just peanut butter, like some other recipes. 
Use a vegetable broth and you've got a winner vegan dinner.

Fantastic!  This reminds me of the Indonesian Peanut Saute dish at Noodles'n Company. After tasting, I added a little more chili paste because I like it a little spicier, but otherwise followed the recipe to a 'T'.  I did add some vegetables to make it more of a balanced meal... some steamed broccoli, and julienned carrot and red bell pepper.

I just made this for dinner and followed the recipe exactly as written. It was very flavorful and tasted like it came from a fancy restaurant.  A bit strong for my taste to just eat it by itself. When it was about half gone, I decided I needed something else to eat with it to shake up the flavor. I put it in Iceberg lettuce and made lettuce wraps... It was SO good! I will definitely be keeping this recipe on hand to make in the future.

Good but I was expecting them to be sweeter than they were.  I added about another Tbs. of honey to get them to my preference.  I served some grilled chicken over this.  Thanks.

This is really good! And a very flexible recipe. I used vegan "chicken" bullion instead of chicken broth, and soy nut butter instead of peanut butter and it still turned out amazing! The sauce is a good base to which you can add anything like sprouts, lime, red peppers, tofu, shredded carrots, etc. Super quick to make using ingredients most people have on hand. Will definitely make this again.

Absolutely delicious.  Very easy, followed exactly, but left out the chile paste.  Had great flavor.  I could not find Udon noodles so I had to use spaghetti noodles but still fabulous!!!

My husband and I enjoyed this dish. Next time I think I will add some fresh lime at the end. Surprisingly my kids would not eat it. They just don't know what they are missing. It was fairly quick and easy to prepare. I did add sliced chicken while the peanut butter mixture was cooking.

Woah!  These are seriously delicious!  Didn't (and wouldn't) change a thing!!!  Note- I did leave out the optional hot chili paste, because we're not big fans of big spice.

WOW! This was fantastic! I was not expecting it to be *so* good! I will definitely be making this again. I would have gave it a 5 star rating but the garlic taste was a bit overwhelming (and I only used two cloves instead of the three called for), next time I will leave the garlic out. Other then that, it was awesome!

Wow, if I could give this 0 stars I would.  This was literally a peanut butter sandwich with noodles instead of bread.  The first few bites were alright, but after that it was down the drain.  I didn't have chile paste, so I had to add a TON of hot sauce and red pepper flakes to try and tone down the peanut butter...still didn't work.  I will not be making this again.

This recipe was really good, that coming from someone who doesn't normally like meatless dishes. But I wanted to give a savory peanut butter meal a try. I used homemade broth, low sodium soy sauce, a little bit more peanut butter since I used chunky, added cayenne and used WW linguini. I also took about a half tsp of cornstarch and a half TB of water, mixed them together, added it to the sauce, and simmered a little before adding to the pasta as I do not like thin sauces. Worked perfectly with these alterations. Only if you like it spicy like me though, otherwise skip the cayenne. I think it would be a perfect match for some orange chicken! Enjoy!

My kids loved these, definitely a keeper.  Followed the recipe to a T.  ETA:  Made this a second time and turned it into a dinner with grilled chicken and sauteed snow peas mixed in.  Phenomenal!!  Instead of adding peanuts at the end, I just use chunky peanut butter in the sauce.

Great recipe.  I added Siracha sauce to increase the spiciness. Used chicken instead of tofu. Marinated chicken in garlic powder, hoisin and siracha sauce. Big hit with the family. Next time, might use a little less peanut butter and more green onions & chili paste and add other veggies. Great basic recipe to tweak to your own!

This was the first time I made anything like this and I really enjoyed it.  so simple to make.  I thought for sure my 2 & 3 yr old would love this but they didn't for some reason.  I'll feed it to them in a couple of months to give it another go.  I put the onions, added cilantro and lime juice only to my own dish.  oh man, that was so good.  i added some shredded carrots and little half and half to each of our bowls because that liquid actually dried up a bit.  I used crunchy pb and added a 1/4c peanuts and i think next time i'll add even more peanuts!  Also, I used angel hair pasta.  I thought this was delicious.  This seems to be a great I-don't-have-the-energy-to-make-anything-and-i-only-have-a-1/2 hour sort of dish!

Made for a quick lunch to use up left over spaghetti noodles from dinner last night.  I always have a large root of ginger in the freezer in a freezer bag....so always have fresh ginger on hand...easier to grate frozen ginger root.  Very good....added seseame oil and 1T Hoisen sauce and 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper. Did not have any peanuts or green onions...next time will make it with these to put it over the top.  Very RICH dish.

Very delicious!  I added a little bit of sesame oil to the sauce and grilled some chicken to put in this.  Next time i'd add more chile paste because I love spicy!  This recipe is wonderful because it's very easy to adjust to your tastes.....add veggies or meat more or less spicy.  Yum, going to go eat my leftovers now!

I love this recipe! I have tried many peanut noodle recipes and this is the one I keep coming back to. It is easy and delicious. Sometimes I add chicken or shrimp to bulk it up a bit, but it is wonderful as is. I often sub whole wheat spaghetti noodles for the udon.

Pardon my manners for not writing sooner. This dish was terrific! Simple and very flexible. We used some kind of whole grain noodles and my mom and I both thought it was wonderful, thank you for sharing this spicy little recipe. I'm making it again this weekend, and I plan to dig out that little gadget that makes very thin strands of veggies so I can add carrots and maybe some cucumber on top.

This was a great basic recipe to start with and the sauce is very good.  We added cooked chicken and some veggies to this and it was fabulous.  My picky 3 year old had seconds. Great recipe, we will make this again!  Thanks!

Made this last night with leftover spaghetti noodles and defrosted, cooked shrimp.  Added some leftover vegetables (carrots, cauliflower and broccoli was what I had on hand)  Some red pepper flakes.  It was really good.  I think some sesame oil would improve it a bit more. Husband loved it, couldn't tell I had used peanut butter.  :)

Great recipe! I gave it four stars because I didn't have green onions or peanuts and I augmented the recipe a bit. I used Sriracha instead of chili paste (1 tsp to start; season with more if you like it hot). I also put it in the fridge after it cooled to room temperature. I garnished it with shredded carrot and cucumber (seeded then chopped).

oh wow! I wanted to make this for the longest time and finally did so for dinner today. Delicious! Very quick! Very easy! I doubled all of the sauce ingredients, and used 8 oz of spaghetti. I separately sauteed red, and green pepper cut into thin strips, shredded carrot, half an onion chopped, and a tsp of sesame seeds, all in some sesame oil, added to the sauce before I mixed in the pasta.topped with cilantro and YUMMO!

I knew when I made this part of the week's menu that husband wouldn't like it (ginger, Asian, spicy, onion). But I've been jonesing for peanut butter noodles, so I made it anyway.  Nyah!  Left out the chile paste, so it wouldn't be spicy and reduced the amount of ginger and garlic.  Also didn't use any green onion, which seemed blasphemous, but I can't justify buying a whole bunch of green onions to use one and have the rest get slimy.  Anyway, the look on husband's face when I set the plate in front of me was enough; I didn't even have to ask. But I liked it a lot.  After picking at it for awhile, husband asked forlornly, "when are you going to make something I like?"  Just can't win...

this turned out so great!! i used chunky peanut butter as someone suggested and it was great because the peanuts were already chopped.  i added sri racha instead of chili paste and it was delicious. maybe could have used a 1/2 teaspoon of salt, but that depends on the peanut butter and soy sauce you're using.  i also added snap peas, seitan for protein, and a chopped red pepper for color and it was perfect! will definitely be making this again!

Sometimes I change this by adding fish sauce and chopped cilantro on top. I really like this recipe and everyone that is about to try it turns their nose up until they have had them and then they can't stop talking about them! Good with chicken satay without the peanut sauce.

Very peanut-buttery! I really enjoyed the flavor of this dish, but will probably cut back on both the peanut butter and ginger next time. My boyfriend said the ginger was too much for him (and I used slightly less than what the recipe called for).

I did not enjoy this at all. initially it tasted ok. But I grew sick of it quickly. Too much peanut butter. I like peanut sauce, but this was more like eating peanut butter covered noodles. I followed the recipe to the T. I will not cook this again. Thanks, but no thanks.

This was so awesome- my son and I love it and it is SO easy and fast! I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great-the consistency and taste were perfect-it far exceeded my expectations and the Udon noodles were perfect with it. The chili paste made it just spicy enough (but I like spice, so I recommend if you just want a little spice, maybe only use 1 tablespoon). I coupled the noodles w/ a vegetable mix of zuchinni, mushrooms, bamboo shoots, snow peas, and broccoli. These noodles taste great hot or cold and make a great next day lunch. It is also easy b/c you can really serve w/ any kinds of veggies or meat to switch the meal up. Thank you SO much for the great recipe- it will definitely be one used frequently in my kitchen.

I was leary about making this and didn't expect much. I had leftover Chinese noodles and needed a recipe to get rid of them. I made this and it was awesome. I used Super chuck peanut butter so the consistency was nice with that little added crunch. I will make this one again!

This was GREAT!  It's so quick and so easy, I was really impressed with how quickly it all went together.  The sauce was forgiving and simple.  I didn't have Udon noodles to I actually used Angel Hair pasta and it still tasted wonderful.  This will become a staple when I want something different and quick for sure.

This is delicious. We made it with Pad Thai noodles bc we couldn't find Udon. I added some shelled edamame to the water while the noodles were cooking so that we included our vegetable with the meal. It was great!

Any noodles will do.  Added chili powder instead of chili paste and some cumin.   Fantastic!  A big hit with the whole family!

LOVED this!!  Used as a side dish.  I used thin spaghetti noodles, only about 1/2 T of ginger since I don't really like it, 2 tsp of Sriracha (wow, was it hot!  But so good!!!), and skipped the green onions because I hate them.  Oh, I skipped the peanuts too because I forgot them.  I only used about 4 oz of noodles because this was a side.  I'm glad I did, because I like a lot of sauce.  I think it could get a bit too dry with too many noodles.  I'll probably try this again and add some chicken to make it a main dish.  Great recipe!

Amazing, I made the following alterations to the recipe.  I used spaghetti noodles, and when they were almost cooked I threw in frozen peas.  I added julienned carrots and about 2 sliced green onions to the chicken when it was almost complete along with 1/2 tsp. sesame oil.  Added more fresh sliced green onions to the completed meal prior to serving with the chopped peanuts.

This recipe was exactly what I was hoping for!  Our family used to go to a Chinese restaurant years ago and had something very similar to this called, 'Dan Dan Noodle'.  I was hoping to find something just like it and this was very close.  I sauteed chicken and added that to it for my family and left the meat out for me because I am a vegetarian and we all loved it.  I didn't have any Udon noodles and just used spaghetti and I also couldn't find any chili paste, but it was still very awesome!

This was pretty good! I don't think I really care for the ginger so I think I will leave it out next time. I will also add a little more peanut butter.

Very good. Will definitely make again. I used a 7.25 oz.package of freshly cooked Udon noodles. I just had to boil the noodles to get them heated through. I also added tofu and mushrooms---yum! I also used vegetable broth, not chicken and did not use chili paste. Came out great.

I was craving this all day, and was happy with the results, after some quick fixes...  Not sure why my sauce came out so thick, but I thinned it down a bit to get a better consistency.  Also added chicken, shredded carrots, and a mixture of crunchy and creamy peanut butter, plus a little bit of sesame oil to blend the Asian tastes...

I made this for a potluck lunch, and it was very well received. I thought it was delicious, and it was very easy to make. I had chopped everything in advance, and quickly cooked it just before we were to eat. Based on other reviews, I doubled the sauce. I didn't have any chili paste, so I used 1 tsp chili garlic sauce for double the sauce. I couldn't find any Udon noodles at our local store, so I made it with rice noodles. I also added julienned red pepper and shrimp to the sauce. I served it with cilantro and bean sprouts in addition to the green onions and peanuts. The left overs were also delicious. I will most definitely make this again and again.

These noodles were so good but I'll leave out the ginger next time.  The ginger was a little over powering but my biggest problem with this recipe was that it was just too good! I gained 2 lbs.

OH MY GOD! I'm not the only one! I used to make something like this in university. I would buy the "Mr Noodles" packages because they were cheap and always make it in any other way possible. WELL, i happened to have peanut butter on hand, and Pad Thai is my favorite take out food, so why not? This is pretty much a more sophisticated version of my makeshift meal. It tasted WAY better. Honey is a great idea, as with the ginger. I will post an alternative in the customize, just a little different. :)

I came across this recipe through the Asian Tuna Patties recipe, those who made those suggested these noddles. I just came back from vacation and cleaned out the fridge so I had very limited ingrediants.  I used chicken noodle soup broth becuase I had no stock. I used 1 garlic clove and cut all other ingrediants in half due to the fact I was cooking only for myself. I omitted the green onion and peanuts due to not having any. I used a little cornstarch to thicken the mixture. I used spaghetti noodles instead of Udon but can't wait to use Udon or Soba.  I added 1 cup of frozen stir fry vegetables and served with the Asian Tuna Patties from this website as well. I will def make this again...and the right way--but it was fine the way I made it.

Loved this recipe.   I put the sauce on Trader Joe's Thai rice noodles and slivered chicken breast, carrots, cucumbers and scallions.   My peanut butter was the natural (unsugared) variety and it worked great.  I also discovered that I can take my ginger knob straight from the freezer and grate it (Frozen) with my microplane grater.   Easy, and delicious.  Thanks!

I really liked this and my husband liked it as well. The kids - not so much! I am going to try again with real ginger and the Udon noodles.  I can see where you can tweek this with chicken or shrimp or added veggies if you wanted.  Great receipe and a great change of pace.

Love. The only thing I add is some sauteed onion (about 2 Tbsp.) and a tiny tad of sesame oil. This is delicious with Soba noodles. So easy to make (about 5 min.) Kid friendly, adult friendly, you can't go wrong. Sometimes I add some toasted sesame seeds too.  I plan to play around with it and try making it with soy butter for a play group where peanuts are not allowed. I'll update when I try that.
Addition: I added sesame tahini along with the peanut butter tonight and it was to die for!!

My daycare kids LOVED this recipe! I'm always looking for things that I can make quickly with ingredients on hand and this was perfect! I used natural, chunky peanut butter, an extra garlic clove and Korean roasted red pepper paste (I used a scant Tbsp of this so it wasn't too hot for their little mouths). I also added a touch of sesame oil and toasted some sesame seeds, crushed them and mixed half into the sauce.. I simmered the sauce and it had a nice, creamy consistancy. I added julienned carrots and broccoli pieces sauteed in a bit of sesame oil and topped it all off with the rest of the toasted and crushed sesame seeds. I'm glad I used fresh ginger, I think that really helped meld and mold the flavors together--I also was pretty heavy handed with it, what can I say? I love ginger!  Will DEFINITELY be making again!!!

Good basic recipe that can be revved up to match your individual taste.  Perfect potluck dish.  I used coconut milk instead of broth and chili garlic paste instead of chili flakes.  Made a double batch and topped it with bean sprouts, julienned cukes, cilantro, green onion and chopped peanuts.  Napa cabbage or bok choy slivered on top would add some crunch too.  Thanks!

Yum! I mixed this with the veggies from "Thai Noodle Salad" recipe (green peppers, snowpeas, carrots, sprouts) and also added chicken. It's delicious! I also added another tablespoon of hot chili paste in the end and squeezed lime over it for a brighter, spicier taste.

I liked it but everyone thought it was okay.  I added more peanut butter than it asked for maybe that's why.  I added some onions, snap peas, tofu, and chicken breast to make it a filling dinner entree.

Amazing! Definitely cut down on the soy sauce, and make sure to add enough pasta, or else this becomes very salty. With the right proportions, it's terrific.

I love Thai food and my husband doesn't.  I decided to try this recipe anyway just to see if he "might" at least not hate it.  Afterwards he told me he LOVED it.  I added chicken, but stuck to the recipe.  Delish.

This was amazing! I followed the directions exactly, except used regular onions instead of green. We will definitely make this again, often. Next time, we'll try tofu in it.

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars as is but I made some additions to suit my taste.  I added chicken (marinated in my own recipe), thinly sliced cucumber, and carrot sliced into ribbons with a veg peeler.  I also used rice noodles instead of udon noodles. You can find them at most grocery stores, they're the same type of noodles you see in Pad Thai.  Yummy!

This was awesome!  I doubled the sauce recipe and used rice noodles.  I added shrimp and a bag of frozen stir fry vegetables.  If you like Thai food you will love this recipe!

This recipe has saved my live a dozen times!  It's what I make when the cupboards are bare and all I have is a box of spaghetti, peanut butter and some basic staples.  I love it, my son loves it and it costs pennies to make.  What could be nicer?

Used this recipe as the building block to a staple dish in my house. For each 16oz box of cooked thin spaghetti (this is the preferred noodle for us) I dissolve one chicken bullion in 1 cup boiling water. Add 1/2 cup peanut butter, 1 TB fresh minced garlic, 2 TB reduced sodium soy sauce, 2 TB honey, 1/2 TB powdered ginger, 1 TB chili paste, 1 TB lime juice. Heat to boiling, stirring often, adding a pinch of cornstarch to thicken slightly. Toss with drained pasta, top with chopped peanuts, cilantro, and green onions. Delicious and inexpensive when those Thai cravings kick in!

Wow, this was great!!!  I followed the directions exactly except what I thought was "chili paste" in my fridge was actually "Red Hunan Chili Sauce."  I used 2 tsps of the Chili Sauce and it was GREAT!  The perfect amount of Thai spiciness ... next time, however, I'll add the sauce AFTER taking a bit out for my 9 yr old daughter as it was too spicy for her.  I used Udon noodles which were great.  All in all a DELICIOUS dish and one that we'll make again and again.

Delicious and very satisfying! It's so simple to make. The flavors go so well together. I can taste each flavor on its own along with the texture of the sauce.   I used whole wheat spaghetti instead of udon, also used about 2 tbs of crunchy peanut butter so I didn't have to add the peanuts at the end, and added grilled chicken. I will make this again and again.

These were just ok.  I liked the flavor a lot but the sauce got all congealed and sticky once I poured it on the noodles.  This made all the noodles stick together and it was hard to serve.  Next time I would add more soy sauce or broth to thin it out a little more.

This is very similar to a Chinese noodle recipe that you can order at Taiwanese restaurants.  I doubled the sauce and only used 2 tablespoons of honey rather than 3.  I added about 2 teaspoons of chili garlic sauce, but if you don't like spicy skip this (the rooster one you can buy in international section or an Asian grocery store) and a tablespoon of sesame oil.  For the noodles, I cooked Japanese raw udon noodles boiled 3 times.  The sauce takes about 15-20 minutes to cook to the correct creamy consistency on medium heat because it's not supposed to be soupy.  I cook chicken separately and add to the noodles.  Garnish additionally to the chopped peanuts and green onion shredded cucumbers, shredded carrots, and chopped cilantro.

Really easy and tasty recipe.  I used egg noodles because that's what I had in the pantry, and added carrots, broccoli, and extra firm tofu.
  
I was very happy with the amount of garlic in the dish, but could see how people who aren't so into garlic might be offended.  

Husband said he would recommend the dish to a friend.

This was so intriguing. A lot of flavor going on here. I used ginger paste, brown sugar, hot chile oil and some cayenne for the chile paste, regular spaghetti noodles, chives and didn't have peanuts. Mine turned out pretty spicy but I loved it that way. Next time I will have the chile paste on hand and the honey too. I will eat these again, they were good.

Tasty!! Added cooked chicken to sauce before simmer, then added pasta, jullienned carrots, and a bit of sesame oil along with the other ingredients. Will try adding bean sprouts next time.  My sauce was a little thick probably due to simmering for a tad too long, but I remedied that by adding about 1/4 cup of water (sauce gets pretty thick as it sits).  I like spicy so I added a generous tablespoon of korean red chili paste and about a teaspoon of red chili flakes as well. Great quick dinner and sacked lunch for the next day.

I  thought this was good, but not great.  The sauce was quite good, but too runny.  The only differences I made was to use fettuccini noodles instead of the udon, replaced the chili paste with red pepper flakes, and I didnt garnish with more peanuts.  I will make this again, but next time I will add some cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it up a bit.

Delicious, very filling. Been making this for years! Especially a staple when I’m pregnant and starving! Fresh ginger and fresh garlic makes a huge difference in taste and health benefits are far more-it’s worth it! I usually skip the piece of peanuts. I also put in a dose of Sriracha as well.

FANTABULOUS!!!! I'm only rating a 4 because as great as this recipe, and its results, is/are, it still does need a little something to make it absolutely perfect!  Trial and error--which I will certainly enjoy with this one, will surely yield the exact results I'm looking for.  I used rice spaghetti noodles split into two for shorter strands, chunky peanut butter instead of smooth and nuts at the end, added sesame oil, and had lots of fresh cilantro and onion available as garnishes. Next time I'll probably add lots more sesame oil and perhaps red pepper flakes. I've had peanut-butter-type noodles in several restaurants in NYC, San Francisco, Florida, and Alabama, and the results of this recipe are actually better than most of the restaurant results.  This was really great, and I can't wait to make it again next time I have a yearning for hot sesame noodles!

This recipe is a good starting point, but I was surprised that I didn't like it better without having to modify it.  It's way too salty - next time, I'll cut the soy sauce at least in half and maybe even increase the peanut butter so it's not so liquidy.

This was very good. My veggie daughter Loved it. I coudn't find chili paste so substituted some red pepper flakes and it was great. Also used veg broth instead of chicken so she would eat it. It was very spicy to me but she would have taken it hotter.

So good and so easy!! I make this all the time, but add a bag of frozen stir-fry vegetables and garnish with lime juice, fresh bean sprouts, and cilantro.  Sometimes I also add sauteed tofu (combining this recipe with the Tofu Peanut Stir Fry recipe).

Gave this 5 stars because its a great basic recipe that is easy to "customize" to personal taste. I like a little less honey and a little more soy sauce/peanut butter. The fresh ginger is a very nice touch. I do use red pepper flakes for the heat, because its what I always have on hand. UPDATE: Adding chicken makes a great complete pasta salad, served cold or hot.

OMGoodness, this was fantastic and so crazy easy to make. My husband walked in, saw it and goes "wow, that looks like something I would order in a restaurant". The peanut butter mixture was fantastic. I actually used organic peanut butter and I served it with Rachel Ray's Cucumber Sesame Salad (recipe on her website).

Love it! So easy.  Had to cut the peanut butter in half for my husband. I add chicken, half a bag of broccoli slaw, and a few green onions for a beautiful and yummy main course.

Awesome noodles! Instead of buying peanuts to garnish, I just used chunky peanut butter in the sauce and it turned out great. I did add some coconut milk for extra tastiness, and didn't use fresh ginger. I think that next time, I'll make the extra effort to use fresh ginger, but it's tasty either way! Yum!

VERY GOOD!  I didn't have chicken broth, and i added just a small amount of white onion and green onion.  It's one of the best sauces I've ever had.

VERY VERY GOOD!  One of my favorites and just as good as peanut noodles I've had in a Thai restaurant.  I do like to use ramen noodles (cooked without the seasoning packet) and I add 1 tsp of lime juice and 1 tsp of rice vinegar to the sauce...  Can't count how many times I've made this, but today I tried it with cubed, fried tofu.  I fried the tofu in butter and then simmered with the sauce for a few minutes and garnished with green onion.  It was very good too...

This was yum yum! I used bow tie noodle because those were the only noodles I had, and I added a chopped carrot and bean sprouts to the sauce. I also put most of the green onions in the sauce. I added extra peanut butter and honey.

I made it with JIF and then with all natural peanut butter, and the natural kind makes it soooo much better.

I used crushed red pepper flakes, toooo instead of chili paste. It was really spicey, but I like that (but my sisters don't!)

I just finished making these and they are fantastic.  A definate keeper.  I used Thai Chili Garlic paste (by Dynasty) and found it to be way to hot though.  I had to add a little brown sugar to mellow it out.  Still fantastic though, next time I will just cut back on the chili paste a little.

Delicious recipe, these noodles can become a stuck-together mess when they cool, however. Maybe a drizzle of sesame oil?

This was tasty. I did make a few adjustments due to need and preference -- I didn't have any peanuts so I left them out. I added some extra chicken broth to thin the sauce a little and added some lime juice for more Thai flavor. I also added some broccoli, peas and water chestnuts (previously frozen mix) and sliced some red pepper and matchstick carrots and tossed them all with the hot pasta. I added some cilantro to the green onions as garnish. I didn't have any udon noodles so I used thin spaghetti. It would probably be good with some chicken or shrimp tossed in as well. I may still look for other peanut noodle recipes to find something a little closer to the flavor I got with all my additions, but this one is very good.

I substituted almond butter for peanut and added chili flakes instead of chili paste.  Great taste and quick!  Will try the add-ins recommended by others.

It was okay I guess. In my family, we use sesame sauce instead of peanut butter (in Asia, that's what the original recipe calls for). I suggest using low-sodium soy sauce and kikkoman brand because regular soy sauce is already high in sodium and other brands contain alcohol. I think you needed a little more sugar and less peanut butter, a bit of soy sauce paste instead of the chile paste (it makes a yummy difference), and a bit of red wine vinegar. By the way, I didn't happen to add chicken broth or even cook the sauce. The sauce is fine the way it is without need of cooking it and just tossing it with the pasta (I eat it as is without veggies or meat). If you were to simply toss the noodles (and a large bowl too) with just the sauce, I'd recommend cutting those measurements in half. Just a little note if you don't feel like really cooking.

Had leftover grilled chicken & 8 oz. of plain cooked fettuccine noodles. Made this sauce and put it all together WOW!! Marinated some cukes in an Asian dressing for a side dish and that was a simple summer meal. DH & me loved it!! Thanks - very delicious!!!

This was soo good! I only gave it four stars as I modified it quite a bit. I used:

1/2 cup chicken broth, 1 tbsp minced ginger, 3 tbsps soy sauce, 2 tbsps peanut butter (make sure you use NATURAL, PEANUTS ONLY PB- makes all the difference between jiffy slathered noodles or a peanut sauce!) 1 1/2 tbsps honey, 2 tsps ground cumin, 1- 1 1/2 tsps ground corriander, 4 cloves minced garlic, and fettucine noodles instead of udon.

My 19 month old son LOVES this and I will definitely make it again!

this was delicious. i decreased the honey by a little and added the peanut butter little by little as per my taste. i ended up using 1 1/2 tbp. I used red pepper flakes and paprika. I also added tons of scallion and let it cook a bit. Also added tofu bc some said this dish wasn't hearty enough. I thought it was very filling. I think Udon noodles are heartier than regular spaghetti noodles. Great recipe.

Excellent!  I used chunky peanut butter, which was all I had, so I didn't add the chopped peanuts.  I also didn't have fresh ginger so I used ground.  It turned out fantastic.  Maybe next time I will try adding different veggies for variety.  Great dish!

Everyone in our household loves this recipe.  We did think it was too sweet the firt time so we don't use the honey anymore and to give it a Thai kick add 1 T of fish sauce in place of 1 of the T of soy sauce.

This is great. I add chicken, broccoli, shredded carrot and bean sprouts. I added some more honey and used dark soy sauce. I loved the chili paste in this! I might use some coconut milk in this next time I make it.

I love this recipe! I made a double recipe with some chicken, broccoli, and a can of chinese vegetables to make it a meal. I would enjoy these plain without all that though. It will be a great side dish too! I did add more peanut butter to this-2T more; also 1/2c. more broth; also more garlic(my taste)probably doubled it; no fresh ginger...used what I had. I left out the chili paste this time, but would love totry it with that in it sometime. Will make this recipe many times I'm sure...will be a great one for me to take for lunch at work.....thanks Amy!

Excellent flavor.  The Udon noodles really do make the difference (I found them at my local Health Food Store).  Really really good.

This was a very good recipe.  I didn't have chili paste, so I used chili poweder and I went pretty light on it because I wasn't sure how the spiciness would go over with my son.  The whole family love this dish though and next time I'll add a bit more spice.  I also added some cubed tofu and mushrooms to make it more of a main dish.  Also excellant cold the next day.

This was very good.  I made it with angel hair pasta because that is all I had in the house.  I just tasted Udon noodles and ext time i will definitly use those instead.  The chopped peanuts and scallions really add to this recipe.

We loved this...I agree that the recipe needs Asian or Thai added to the title so that folks don't misinterpret this for a typical peanut butter treat recipe...if you like to give your taste buds a break from the usual, give this simple recipe a try....

We loved this recipe.  It was really out of the ordinary.  Even my seven year old liked it.  We added chicken as suggested to make a main meal.  It needs a vegatable to add some color.

Terrific recipe!  Use a bit less ginger maybe or it turns out very spicy.  Udon noodles are hard to find dried, but use any thick noodle.

This was an amazing recipe. I didn't put ginger root ,chili paste or green onions.
I used egg noodles instead of udon noodles.  I followed the recipe and then kept on adding some of the ingredients until I was satisfied with the taste. I would definitely try this again and would recommend it.

This recipe was incredibly easy to make and tasted delicious!! I substituted cayenne pepper for the hot chili paste as that's all I had. I added cilantro to my second helping which gave it an extra oomph.

This was very delicious and easy to make. We did take some of the suggestions from the reviewers and added red bell pepper, a touch of sesame oil, and cilantro. We also decided to toss in some edamame. My 2 year old daughter even enjoyed this! We will definitely make this again.

This was excellent.  I used half a box of fettuccine noodles and added a splash of sesame oil.  I didn't have the chile paste but added a heaping tablespoon of red pepper for heat.  Restaurant quality.  We loved it.

Decent, quick, easy, and fairly tasty. Had to tweak slightly by adding a little more of this and that to suit family preferences, but overall, it will be made again, especially when I need a quick dinner.

I have been making this recipe for years now..... I usually use spaghetti and sriacha for the chili paste.  Ground ginger works too if it's all u have.  I get rave reviews.  Add meat to it and vegis for a full meal. Awesome hot or cold, gets better and the sauce thickens as it cools down. I find I like to double the sauce especially if adding meat/ vegis.  My son has a nut allergy so sunflower seed butter works perfectly.  Use chunky sunbutter if u can find it.

Another five star review.  Excellent. I made the sauce as is, left out the green onions, and added red pepper, corn, and dome frozen veg.  I stir fried some chicken in sesame oil and olive oil and threw some chopped cilantro and some lemon on top before serving.  Dynamite!

Served this to adults who were pleasantly surprised.  I halved the soy suace, used pad thai noodles and completely forgot to put the chopped peanuts on top.  I did however add 1-2 pinches of chipotle pepper.  I'd try it again and serve with soy-ginger fish.

This were good for a quickie meal. Overall it was a bit bland. Probably would have been a bit more filling if some shredded chicken or something was added to it. As it was, we were hungry fifteen minutes later.

Easy and very good! Reminded me of pad Thai, so if I had lime and bean sprouts I would have added them.  I did add chicken and shredded carrots.  I used spaghetti because it's what I had.

Great recipe! Easy to make and a nice balance of sweet and spicy. I followed the recipe (including chili paste). Next time I will reduce the ginger (too much for my liking) and maybe add cilantro.

This was really good, and easy to make, using ingredients I already had. (bonus!) Even my toddler liked it, minus the hot sauce. The only thing I added that I thought improved it was to put some cilantro and lime juice on it, for that kick of freshness. Great recipe, though!

kids liked it but not really a great reaction from them. Evan says he would have preferred it with thinner noodles. we didn't use any hot sauce, perhaps it would have been a bit better with it added.

Wow!  This was amazing.  I made the sauce exactly as written except for reserving the garlic and using Sriracha as my chili garlic paste.  I sauteed chicken in some olive and sesame oil with the garlic.  When the chicken was almost done I added some zucchini, lemon squash and basil from the garden, as well as mushrooms, onion and red bell pepper.  Cooked that quickly and then poured the sauce over the top.  It was a bit thin so I added a little cornstarch.  Served over whole wheat thin spaghetti because we were out of Udon noodles, and sprinkled sesame seeds over everything.  It was, quite simply, wonderful.  Thank you for sharing.

Delicious!!  I eliminated the spicy component and served Sriracha sauce on the side, for those that like the heat.  This was exactly what I was hoping for!  Perfect peanut butter noods recipe, and I added chicken breast to make it a one-dish meal.  Thanks!

I've made this a couple times. The first time, I followed the recipe exactly and my fault - this wasn't as good as I was hoping because I didn't know that if you didn't peel the ginger.. it would be too bitter and wouldn't cook right. I've made this since and with peeled ginger, it is a great meal requiring very little labor. I've also made this with plenty of substitutes when our food supply has dwindled towards the end of the week. Including using syrup (not maple flavored) instead of honey, powdered ginger and chunky peanut butter. I would still recommend sticking to the original recipe if possible but when desperate, the subs will do just fine. 10 stars from the husband, I think this is just okay.

Great recipe that you can make with many things on hand. I like to add carrots, broccoli, and chicken or tofu for a full meal. Also I never have chili paste so I just add a few dashes of cayenne pepper which does the trick! Very good!

Like this recipe better than the other peanut one =- honey makes difference. I used Srirachi sauce instead of chilli paste/ or oil -- Plan to make it with my teriaki shrimp. I used whole wheat spaghetti instead of buying a whole new pasta for my pantry.

We liked this pretty well.  I did not add peanuts and I used a bit of crushed red pepper in place of the paste.  I put the sauce over regular whole wheat noodles and stir fry veggies for the kids.  Hubs and I had the sauce over chicken and stir fry veggies. I liked it because the kids got their veggies and noodles and the adults enjoyed a healthy alternative.

My very picky family really enjoyed this. I opted to leave out the hot sauce and just served it as a topping  since everyone here has a different spice tolerance. If I would change anything I would probably add a little less ginger. Great as is though!

I started by stir-frying cubed chicken breast, then added the sauce ingredients, and finally the noodles. I've reduced the amount of chicken broth, increased the amount of soy sauce, and added lemon juice and just a hint of rice wine vinegar. Gives it an almost teriyaki flavour!

Awesome dish!  My family doesn't like spicy, especially my 7 year old son, so I used Sweet Chile Sauce instead of Hot Chile Paste.  I recommended it to all of my friends on Facebook!

Wonderful quick recipe.  I would recommend using fresh ginger root and garlic along with some Thai chile paste.  I also added some frozen stir fry veggies to make it a nice side dish.  Magnificent !!! Thanks so much.

I really love the flavors of this dish. I didn't have fresh ginger, so I added a little powder and I used angel hair pasta since I had no Asian noodles. My husband told me not to be hurt if he didn't like this, as he never likes Asian noodles that much- then he ate three servings :) I would not leave out the chile paste, the heat is nice. My only complaint is that the noodles cooled off and got sticky very quickly, but that may have to do with the fact that I used a different kind of noodle.

Fantastic!  Super easy and quick.  I used brown rice pasta (spaghetti) and peanut butter which was ground fresh and the sauce was thick enough to coat the pasta well.  The only change - besides the type of noodle - was that I did not add in hot chile paste.  I think it was yummy even without it : )

This is a great, easy and tasty meal. I added some veggies as suggested: cabbage, sprouts, and mushrooms. I'll definitely make it part of my regular menu.

Omitted the ginger and chili paste, since I don't care for either. Was very good, but I used thin spaghetti noodles and it got a little "clumpy" after awhile. Next time I will use different noodles. Kids loved it!

This is quick, easy, and most importantly, delicious.  I made this on a whim, so I had to make a few changes based on what I had on hand, but it still turned out perfectly.  I had to use dry ginger instead of fresh and a little dried onion instead of the green onion.  This is the perfect combination of sweet, savory and spicy.  I will make it again for sure.

I loved this!  I ate this on top of a bed of red cabbage, carrots, and cilantro.  It was very good, and I think about 350 calories per large serving.

WOW!!! When I first read this recipe I was kinda grossed out -- Warm peanut butter just sounds sick....But I decided to give it a try because someone made a comment about it tasting like pad tai.  Now I did not have fresh ginger so I used the ground stuff which worked just fine... I also added chicken.  It is DELICIOUS!!!  I will be making it again and again and I even emailed 2 of my foodie friends right away about this recipe because it was so good.  YUMMY!!!!

This is a great on its own, but it's really easy to customize.  I have added bean sprouts, shredded cooked chicken, and cucumber at various times.  It's also good cold the next day as a lunch box item.

Great dish! Made it with the "Oven-Baked Sesame Chicken" from this site as another had suggested. It was "fantastic" according to my wife 11 year old son and 7 year old daughter. Everyone ate until they were stuffed. I did as others suggested- double the CHUNKY peanut butter & lemon juice & triple the garlic. I couldn't find Udon noodles so I used linguine, came out great. Sauce seemed way to thin, until I dumped in the noodles and stirred it around, thickened up very nicely. Everyone said " you have to make this again, soon!"

Maybe I ended up cooking this too long, but it's a little too 'peanutbutter-y' and actually did not taste as restaurant quality as a lot of posters have noted.  I did double the recipe and used 8 oz of whole wheat thin spaghetti noodles because that's what I had on hand.  Added diced leftover chicken breast but think this would be better just being a noodle dish.  Next time I think I'll double the recipe but only put in enough peanutbutter for one recipe and see how that fares.

Yumm!  Loved these!  I did have to substitute red curry paste for the hot chile paste, and finely minced white onion for the green onion, but I don't think it made a difference.  They were delicious, definitely making this again!

This was good! I did add chicken and asian vegetables to make a meal out of it so I doubled the sauce- which was nice and thick. Next time I might use about half of the honey as the peanut butter makes it pretty sweet already. Will make again!

This is addictive! I practically lived off of it this summer. My husband isn't quite as crazy about it, but is happy to eat it. The first time, I stuck to the recipe except for the udon and broth. We had half a box of beef Top Ramen sitting around, so I used those noodles and added about half the seasoning packet directly to the pan. Come to think of it, I haven't used broth in it at all; just skipped it after the ramen was gone. I've also made it with bean thread noodles, egg noodles, and even sliced zucchini into "noodles" one night when we were out of pasta. The chili paste is a must for us! I usually add a few red anaheim peppers and a couple mild jalapenos (both for the flavor, rather than the heat), whatever other veggies I have on hand, fresh cilantro or basil, and, when I have time to mess with it, cubed an' fried tofu. This is the closest thing I've found to the amazing tofu with peanut sauce I had in NY five years ago, and have been trying to recreate since then! Thanks!

OMG... this was as GOOD as anyyy Thai dish I've ever made.  Off the charts...more like an 8!!  There were a couple SMALL changes I made.    I triple the sauce, added about 1 cu. shredded rotisserie chicken (so my hubby wouldn't die because it was a meatless dinner..lol), added about 1 T. of fresh Cilantro to the simmering sauce. As I sliced up the green onions, I added 1 more T. of fresh Cilantro (mixed in with the green onions).     My husband was in "heaven"...lol  He was seriously funny... he kept rolling his eyes, shaking his head  during the meal ......LOL  I'd say it MET his approval (as well as MINE)    Fast and OFF THE CHARTS FOLKS!  5 star restaurant flavor and sooo easy to make!

Yum! Yum! Yum! I have made peanut butter noodles many times, but usually the sauce ends up getting to thick.  This sauce was wonderful!  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using slightly less ginger.  Fabulous!

My family LOVED this!  It was soooo good!!  I used regular whole wheat organic spaghetti noodles.  I also added some chunked up chicken breast meat.  We were out of fresh ginger so I had to use the jar kind but it was just as good.  Really delicious!  My husband said he could have ate the entire bowl!

I had very mixed thoughts about this one. I liked it in the beginning and then after a few bites I couldn't down it anymore.  It was too creamy-peanuty for me. Although, I think this would be a great dip for chicken and would fall under chicken satay style.

Excellent! I have made this twice. I added chicken and other veggies (pepeprs, broccoli, carrots, etc.)to make this a main dish. I cooked the chicken/veggies in some of the sauce and then added the rest when I added the noodles.  I found udon noodles at Whole Foods for a very reasonable price--it is worth it to find the correct noodles, the first time I just used whole wheat spaghetti and it was not nearly as good!

This was really tasty. I had whole wheat spaghetti on hand, so I used than instead of udon, but I'm sure udon noodles are better with this sauce. I added 2 extra tablespoons of honey and stirred in a splash of sesame oil just before tossing the noodles with the sauce. This was an easy and quick recipe. Thanks!

This is a very good and easy recipe. I doubled the chicken broth and peanut butter for the sauce and left the rest of the ingredients the same. I also added sliced chicken breast and steamed broccoli. This is something I will be making often, thanks for the great recipe!

I had to improvise with Rotini noodles and used about ten ounces and I added some shredded carrot for color.. other than that I stuck to the recipe and loved it!

I did as others suggested and topped with cilantro at the end.  I also added chicken for a larger meal.  The sauce was super easy to make.  For the ginger, I used my micro planer to grate it.

Wow!  This was SOOOO good and SOOOO easy!  I used ground ginger (since it was on hand), reduced fat peanut butter, and whole wheat spaghetti noodles and added cubed chicken and fresh mint and cilantro at the end.  I'll definitely be making this again!  Thanks Amy!!

We make these all the time for a quick meal that almost everyone in our family loves! We sub water for the broth, use powdered ginger, and add cayenne or red pepper flakes instead of the chili paste. So easy! (And for the moms out there, we just make extra noodles and keep them plain for butter and seasonings for the picky kids! :)

I tried this recipe because it called for fresh ginger which is readily available where I live.  WOW!  These are so good--I actually had them 3 times in 1 week!  The flavors blend so nicely together.  If you're hesitating at the idea of peanut butter with noodles, don't.  It's just a fantastic combination and I'll be adding this one to my permanent files.

This was so good, I didn't want to stop eating it!  I made the following changes based on what I had: used crushed red pepper, ground ginger, no green onions & used spaghetti.  I really wanted to add vegetables, since this was our main dish, but didn't like the thought of sauteed veggies.  So I finely-chopped some fresh red pepper & carrots and mixed them in at the end.  It added a lot of great color & texture.  I loved the crunch of the carrots.  I highly recommend adding raw chopped veggies.  I also added a bunch of chopped cilantro, it was delicious!

Loved this. I used about half the peanut butter recommended and threw in some corn starch to make up for less peanut butter. Also added about 1 tsp of cilantro. So good!!!

EASY, TASTY, and HEALTHY! I made a few changes. I used a pound of whole grain spaghettti instead of the Udon noodles, so I doubled the rest of the ingredients. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken, used much more garlic then it called for, used a pinch of cayenne since I didn't have chili paste, omitted the green onions, and added steamed broccoli and browned tofu. My boyfriend added leftover shredded chicken breast to his. This is a great weeknight dinner!

This is my ultimate comfort food.  recipe is perfect as is :)  update:  if you are allergic to peanut butter, try this with sunbutter (made with sunflower seeds).  It's completely peanut free and works great with this recipe!!

Very yummy! I made the sauce as directed. I sliced chicken breasts about one quarter inch thick and about one inch square. Tossed it in some corn starch and sauteed it lightly over low heat in peanut oil with some minced ginger root and minced garlic. This barely browned the chicken but didn't dry it out. Then I added the sauce and warmed it. This really made a very nice dish. Thanks for the recipe!

Really enjoyed this first time around when I added chicken. I would recommend adding bean sprouts though and it was much more authentic I felt. Second time around I followed the recipe and didn't add chicken or bean sprouts and my husband was disappointed. Other than that, really great! Thanks!

Made it as is and it was delicious.  Actually, I lied.  I had to use hot sauce because I didn't have chile paste, but it worked just as well.  Adding cilantro to garnish is a must.

Use less ginger!  I would say 1/2 to 3/4 Tablespoon of jarred ginger is plenty.  I also doubled the peanut butter and added tofu, carrots & cabbage.  Yum!

WOW!! VERY very good!! I could not find Udon noodles so I used wide lomain noodles and it was just perfect! The green onion was a very nice addition to this. I served this with the pork dumplings and oriental sauce from this site. Could not of been a better meal!! EDIT: I HAVE MADE THIS MANY TIMES AS MY FAMILY LOVES THIS RECIPE!  THIS TIME I WENT TO AN ASIAN MARKET AND BOUGHT FRESH UDON NOODLES AND IT WAS SOOOO VERY GOOD! FOR NOW ON I WILL MAKE SURE TO MAKE WITH UDON NOODLES AS IT GIVES IT SUCH SPECTACULAR TEXTURE AND FLAVOR.  THE SAUCE REALLY STICKS TO THESE NOODLES BETTER THAN ANY ITALIAN PASTA.THE MEASUREMENT FOR FRESH NOODLES IS VERY DIFFERENT THEN THE MEASUREMENT OF DRY NOODLES. I USED 4 7OZ PACKAGES OF FRESH UNDON AND DOUBLE THE SAUCE AND IT WAS PERFECT...EVEN REHEATED

Good but not great.  I added more peanut butter (another tablespoon or more) and a tablespoon of lime juice, but I think it needs more of both.  Will keep looking for the perfect recipe!

Good concept, but the sauce was bland for my taste. I ended up adding about a tablespoon more peanut butter and some vinegar and oyster sauce. After the additions, the noodles were wonderful! I loved the combination of the ginger and garlic together. This recipe reminded me of the dan dan noodles I ate in Beijing several years ago.

This was delicious and so easy!  I tried to make it a little less fattening by using low fat peanut butter.  Also, I used Shirataki noodles (find them with the refrigerated soy products) because an 8oz. package only has 40 calories! Everything else as is but next time I will make it more spicy by adding more chili paste.

This is exactly what I was looking for! I had noodles with peanut sauce at a nice Asian restaurant the night before and had to have more. I added cilantro along with the scallions and it was perfect. I will be making this one over and over!

For those with nut allergies or are cooking for someone who does, I used Sunflower Seed Butter (from Trader Joes)instead of Peanut Butter. No one could tell and it was quickly gobbled up.  If you like extra sauce or plan on adding protein (chicken, shrimp) to the sauce, I suggest tripling the recipe.  I doubled it, added shredded chicken and barely had enough sauce to cover the noodles.  I served this over capellini. Very good and so easy!

Yum!  These noodles turned out great.  I added about 2 Tbps cilantro and 1/3 cup shredded carrots.  I did not add the peanuts because I used chunky peanut butter (2 Tbsp instead of 3).  The hot chili paste really made the dish great.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe.  It will be a regular in our house.

Everyone loved this.  I didn't have the chili paste when I made it and it was still yummy.  I am making it again today with the hot chili (but all I could find was the oil, not the paste.) Hopefully it will turn out okay.

I made this recipe as written ( with the exception of doubling it) for my hubby and and some friends last weekend.  I paired it with Coconut Soup and spring rolls. Everyone raved about it and one of my guests even ate the extra sauce in the bottom of the EMPTY serving bowl with a spoon.  I will make this again!  Thanks

I used fresh noodles from an Asian market. I also used all natural peanut butter, this was very tasty, the sauce dried up very fast, so I had to add a splash of broth. Will make again.

I absolutely love this recipe and I've made it a bunch of times now.  The last time I made it I added some chicken to make it more of a meal and it was a great addition.  I omit the green onions for personal taste, and I use grated ginger, not fresh, as it is just what I usually have on hand.  I found that for me it is hard to find udon noodles in my grocery store, and I have made this with spaghetti every time and it still tastes delicious.  I think next time I might add toasted sesame seeds... I think this would really go great with many additions.

I would give this recipe more stars if I could.  I have been making peanut butter noodles for years and this recipe is the best that I have found.  We lived in NYC for a couple of years and loved the cold sesame noodles at a particular restaurant in Manhattan.  Finally I have found a recipe that comes close.  I add thinly sliced cucumbers and carrots on top for garnish.  This can be a main dish or I have served it with grilled salmon, chicken and even stir fry tofu.  Excellent.

This recipe was delicious and very easy to prepare, even for a beginner cook like myself.  In order to make it a bit more substantial, I doubled the sauce recipe, and cooked separately in a small amount of olive oil 2 cubed chicken breasts and a very generous amount of broccoli florets and thinly sliced carrots.  I mixed everything together, and it was great.  I will definitely make this again.

A great combination of ingredients- I topped mine with chopped raw sugar snap peas instead of onions.  I used ground ginger (1 TBSP) which created a little too much ginger flavor for my taste- will reduce the ginger next time.

Okay, but not the best I've had. I added chinese spice, hoisoin sauce, and cilantro to the sauce and then a pinch of cayenne pepper and lime zest once done. We eat lots of meat in my family, so I added pork strips to this.

This recipe is absolutly a keeper! It's probably my favorite recipe from the entire website (and I've made lots of good dishes from this site). I couldn't find chili paste so I used red curry paste and it turned out great- I will use this again next time. I also used soba noodles and added lots of steamed broccoli, carrots and red pepper. The only change I will make next time is to make MUCH MUCH more so that I can have leftovers for days! It is very good as a cold lunch!

This recipe is excellent as is.  It tastes great at room temperature or even cold the next day.  I get rave reviews every single time I make this dish.  The only thing I add is freshly chopped cilantro.

Delicious!  We all ate it up, even my 2 year old.  I did make some substitutions: capellini instead of udon, red pepper flakes instead of chili paste, tripled amount of peanut butter.   I loved this dish and will make it again!

This was GREAT!!  Quick, Simple, and Delicious!  I added shrimp, carrots, zucchini, and bean sprouts to make a very scrumptious meal.  Presents very well too, quite pretty with the colors from the veggies.  Even my 8 year old daughter devoured it.

There wasn't  much of a taste to this recipe. Perhaps I will need to add more peanut butter the next time to make the taste more pronounced. This was one of the most disappointing recipes I've ever made and I am surprised that it came out so bad even with the many good reviews.

Great, only change I made were to add chunks of leftover pork tenderloin and sauteed onion, which was great.  I omitted the spicyness for my husband (who loved this too) and added it to my own plate, which makes it much tastier in my opinion.  Made extra and it tasted great the next day for lunch!

I am seriouslly addicted to these! I don't always have chicken stock on hand and it's been just fine using water.  I do add sesame oil, so perhaps this helps the flavour.  I use brown rice spaghetti and it turns out well. The ginger is strong, and could easily be cut back a bit.  I also use Asian chili sauce instead of the paste.  I mostly eat them cold, since I'm not sure how well they'd reheat.  I haven't bothered with the onion/peanut garnish, but probably should make the effort as some reviewers suggested... A definate staple!

What an incredible dish!!! I made asian tuna patties to go with the noodles, but honestly the noodles would have been just as good alone!  I used powdered ginger as I did not have any fresh - only used 1 teaspoon and it seemed to be enough.  I also took advice from other reviewers and used chunky peanut butter.  Added crushed red pepper for more fire.  The green onion garnish is a must!

We loved this (comming from 2 peanut butter fanatics)! I added 2 chopped chicken breasts and 1 cup broccoli and 1 cup green beans. Could add peanut oil if need to make more out of the sauce. My husband and I don't like pasta too much so we cut the pasta in half.

Excellent recipe.  I didn't have enough peanut butter, nor did I measure everything and it still turned out wonderful!

Loved this dish! Made a few changes due to lack of grocery-shopping motivation. I substituted a honey ginger green tea for the chicken broth and used only one garlic clove. I skipped the green onions and peanuts but found the noodles delicious! An easy peanut noodle to prepare and well worth it!

I've just made this for the first time and I loved it!  It was so easy, it took about 10 minutes start to finish, and it tasted gorgeous.  I am going to cook it for my vegan sister by subbing out vegetable broth for chicken broth, and I used crunchy peanut butter for texture.  Will definitely be cooking it again!

I have made this several times now, and it is the perfect recipe for adding whatever veggie is on hand and in season.  I've used carrots, broccoli slaw, cabbage, zucchini, and eggplant...all were excellent!

I gave this recipe five stars because this is the ultimate dish!  It tastes just like take-out!  However, I added a bunch of veggies such as onions, broccoli, peas and shredded carrots. I also added chicken-- all of these ingredients made it taste like paad thai.  So good!  But add the veggies and chicken!!! And don't forget the chili sauce for the extra kick. (You also don't have to use fresh ginger, just buy pre-minced ginger.)

Excellent flavors, and so adaptable. SAVE TIME by blending hot pasta water into the sauce ingredients instead of cooking on the stovetop. I used less garlic, and less ginger, grated to taste. I only had fettuccine, so I used that. I also liked a later addition of sesame oil, as well as a few splashes of rice vinegar. Cilantro was so yummy too!  The sauce seemed way too thin, but thickened perfectly upon standing. Mr. Smiley says to make this a weekly standard. ~Cucumbers and red pepper strips, along with steamed broccoli, made a nice accompaniment.

Excellent! My family (even the picky eater) really enjoyed this. The changes I made to make this dish more kid-friendly were: I used whole wheat spaghetti, didn't use the chili paste & used 1/2tbsp of ginger instead of the full amount. Also, right before adding the sauce I added 1tbsp of equal parts cornstarch and water to thicken up the sauce. It thickened instantly and to me seemed perfect. This way the sauce perfectly coated all the ingredients I added to the pot. With that said, to make this a meal I added 2 chicken breasts, baked & sliced. I also added 12oz of medium sliced carrot sticks (about 4 large carrots I believe) to the water when I was cooking the spaghetti. I topped the dish off with green onions as directed. Oh my goodness... what a fantastic meal. This will now become a staple in our monthly meal plan!

Amazing. I highly suggest using the chili paste. I used egg noodles too and it was a good alternative to the udon noodles which I couldn't find in the market, must go by another name as well.

This dish was easy to make, but it was a little sweet for my taste. I wound up adding a little more chili sauce and a bit of garlic paste for an extra kick.

Next time I think I will reduce the peanut butter, cut out the honey, and add in some sauteed garlic instead of paste.

I used red curry paste instead of the red chili, and if you decide to do the same, be careful! Red curry paste is a lot hotter than red chili and it was wicked hot! (That's not a bad thing, I love spicy food!) I also added lime wedges, and the juice gave it more of a Thai vibe. Tasty! Update: I just made an awesome variation on this! I made just the peanut sauce and added it to a bag of frozen veggies and served it over rice. Delicious!

I found as I got ready to make this recipe, that I had less of the ingredients than I'd anticipated.  However, I substituted with what I had and it still came out pretty good.  It is definitely a great method to use and change to your liking.  I think next time I will try it as written.  Definitely a keeper.

A family favorite!  I use soba noodles (or rice), a couple drops of sesame oil, sauteed chicken, and add cilantro just before serving.  Julienned carrots really add the color it needs also.

Used the hints others provided: added sesame oil, thinly sliced carotts, red and green pepper, cilantro and used hot pepper flakes (1/4 tsp). I made it with whole wheat Fettuccine. Absolutely delicious!! Pefect for a meatless meal. Next time, will throw in some more veggies, like snow peas, asparagus tips.

As a sloppy measurer, I think I added too much peanut butter, but it was still yummy.  I used regular spaghetti in place of the pasta specified, which turned out nicely.  This is even better as leftovers, though - toss them into a skillet with a little sesame oil and some extra soy sauce, heat and stir for a couple of minutes, and you have a great lunch!

I don't know what I did wrong but this sauce did not have the thai flavors I was expecting.  It just tasted like peanut butter.  And although I normally love peanut butter on most anything, I did not like this recipe at all.  I ended up ordering a pizza instead.

This was an easy and delicious recipe! My husband put it off because he thought he would not like it but when I finally made it he ate multiple servings and requested it again! Followed the directions except using veggie broth instead of chicken. Next time I will add something more to it like some bean sprouts or other veggies.

I have made this recipe several times and it's one of my favorites. However, 8 ounces of udon noodles is only enough for one person if serving as a main dish, as I do. However, the sauce makes enough for at least 16 oz.

So good and versatile. Have added chicken and/or vegies. A great meal with either or none.

My husband and I love this recipe.  I like a bit more sweet so I use teriyaki instead of the soy sauce.  I also add a handful of matchstick carrots to the sauce mixture before cooking.  And a sprinkling of bean sprouts, along with the chopped peanuts, is a great way to top it off.

To steal someone else's words...You'll make this over and over again!  It is as good as you'd get in a restauraunt.  I did cut my recipe down to 2 tbsp of soy, as it just tasted a bit too salty and added 1 tsp of sugar.

Outstanding recipe with a few modifications.  I used lo mein noodles instead of udon noodles.  Also, I tenderized one chicken breast, marinated it in a teensy bit of lime juice, cilantro, kosher salt and sesame oil for 30 minutes.  Browned in sesame oil on both sides, then added 1/2 cup of chicken broth and cooked on medium until done.  Removed from heat and cut into very thin strips (almost shredded.)

To the peanut sauce I added 1/2 cup LIGHT coconut milk.  I did not have chili sauce so I used red pepper flakes to taste. Tossed with the noodles and then tossed in the chicken.  Served with cilantro, green onions and lime wedges.  My husband absolutely LOVED this dish!

I really did not like this recipe. :( I did not have any chili paste or flakes since I don't like spicy food and unfortunately I was out of chicken broth and had do use beef broth (which could have been the reason this wasn't good?) but I thought that it was bland. I love thai chicken pastas and thought this would be similar but was disapointed. I see that everyone else has loved this so maybe I will try it again with the chili paste, and chicken broth, and I will probably add chicken and veggies. However, it was extremely fast and easy.

I found this a little too sweet, but overall the flavour was quite unique and enjoyable. I would have used more noodles as I found the sauce to noodle ratio wasn't right. I added sesame seeds on top. I also would have used less ginger and maybe a little less soya sauce, too. But it wasn't bad! Thanks for the recipe.

We loved it!!  I doubled the sauce (except for chili paste, kept that the same), used whole-wheat spaghetti, ground ginger (didn't have fresh) and added broccoli, carrots, and water chestnuts.  Next time will added some chicken.  It was so quick and easy....great weeknight meal.  Thanks!

This is a really good recipe,and I make it fairly often, but I make a few changes. First, I don't use chili paste, I use a few dashes of ground cayenne pepper. I also don't use Udon noodles, I just use whatwver kind of noodles I have a home. 

Then I saute some veggies on the side, usually mushrooms, onions, carrots, broccoli and cook a chicken breast and cut it up. I Double the amount of sauce the recipe makes and I add the meat & veggies to the noodle & sauce mixture. It is excellent.

This recipe is very good but it is very rich, so I tend to add more noodles than called for in the recipe to lighten it up. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and the taste is delicious. I also want to add that this also tastes great cold!

Fantastic! I love all things peanut butter.  I didnt change anything, except for adding bean sprouts - and the crunch they added made a huge difference for a contrasting texture.

I just made this for lunch and my kids and I loved it. 
I made just two changes. I used egg noodles because that's what I had. I also added a little corn starch because the sauce didn't thicken quickly enough. I'll try giving it a little more time next time around.
I love the versatility of this recipe. Next time I plan to add chicken and broccoli to the recipe.

Awesome and so darn yummy. The only thing that I changed was I doubled the recipe and used regular spaghetti noodles instead of Udon. Served with Asian Tuna Patties from this site.

This recipe perfectly pairs with Asian Tuna Patties, also found on allrecipes. I didn't have any Udon noodles or hot chile paste on hand.  The chili paste would have added an awesome kick, no doubt.  I used spaghetti, which was fine. As a side dish, this is five stars. I don't think I'd want to serve it as a main course; there just isn't enough sauce to make this a main course and of course no meat.  I doubled the recipe and though there's enough sauce to cover the noodles adequately, it was slightly dry.  Next time, I might consider adding a tad more chicken broth if there doesn't appear to be enough sauce to cover the noodles. This is easy to prepare and delicious.

This is a great starter recipe!  It is also great for whatever you have on hand - no need to follow it to the letter.  I didn't have scallions (although I will use them next time) so I sauteed some onion and that worked fine.  I added some rice wine vinegar and broccoli and used ginger paste instead of fresh since I didn't have any. Next time I will also add cucumbers which are great in peanut butter dressings!

so So SO good! How does all that flavor fit in a low-fat, healthy recipe?! I made the sauce in the microwave instead of getting another pan dirty, and I used low-sodium soy sauce and red pepper flakes instead of chile paste since that's what I had on hand. Also added some broccoli, and it was just as good as my favorite Thai restaurant, and probably healthier! The only tiny change I might make next time is to add a small amount of cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it slightly.

Very very fast and easy to make. Everyone I've made it for loves it. I don't use chicken broth, because it's not readily available, and I don't have the time to make my own. The last time I made this I added some chicken I had cooked up with onion and soy sauce.

LOVE THIS! I make this with angel hair pasta and I don't add the chile paste only because I have a toddler here, but it's still amazing! I like it so much more as left overs because the sauce thickens up and is even tastier that way. I may even start making it a day earlier so it is always like that. I have also made this with and without ginger and it's great either way. I have also added veggies before. (Broccoli is perfect with this, carrots - not so much). I also usually just use crunchy peanut butter, just because it's easier that way.

With 3 small children I wasn't about to go gallavanting all over town trying to locate Udon noodles, so I used thin spaghetti instead.  It worked just fine.  The kids loved it & the peanut butter gave them a protein boost.  My husband thought it tasted like Pad Thai take-out but less greasy.

I made this tonight as a side, with the grilled peanut chicken on this site, and I really enjoyed this dish!  I added about three tablespoons of coconut milk as previously suggested, and I also shredded one large carrot into the drained pasta, as well as added some fresh bean sprouts.  I think that this is a versatile dish, and many other things can be added, to each person's taste.

Very simple recipe--quick, easy-to-follow, and forgiving. I used red pepper/chili combo paste instead of just chili paste, omitted the peanuts, and added cilantro with the green onions as garnish. 

Taking my cues from a param dish I order from a local Thai restaurant, I also added red peppers, carrots, and brocoli, which I stir fried in a combination of sesame and olive oils. Then, added chicken to the stir fry (marinated in a bit of soy sauce). Mixed it all together for a delicious, filling dish.

Excellent dish! I didn't have chili paste so I used red pepper flakes.  I also added some edamame, shredded carrot, and cubed chicken.  I loved it.  Next time though I think I'll use something other than udon noodles which were kind of bulky and hard to manage.  I will definitely make this again.  Oh and this recipe takes no time at all to throw together.

Loved it!  So simple and cheap, but so good.  I didn't have any peanuts but I had crunchy peanut butter so that worked out perfectly.  Also, I used vermicelli noodles instead of spaghetti and added cubes of extra firm tofu.  When my family asked what was for dinner-I vaguely said "Asian Noodles" because I didn't want them to immediately turn their noses up at the thought of peanut butter paired with pasta.  After serving it to them they think peanut butter noodles should be a regular menu item at this household.

Great!!! The only thing I change was to add a tablespoon of chili paste in stead of 2 teaspoons. May try adding coconut milk as suggested by other reviewer. Green beans and carrots make good sides to this dish.

Really yummy.  I didn't have all the ingredients on hand but i will make sure that i do the next time i make this dish.  It can only improve the flavor. Didn't have so I left out the honey, no green onion so I used yellow.  Used whatever pasta i had in the house. Didn't have so left out the peanuts.  It was still really tasty and I can't wait to make it again with all the ingredients listed.  Served with Asian tuna patties from this site.
thanks Amy for passing this along.  Quick, easy and tasty dish!

Very smooth taste - just the right amount of peanut butter.  My son & I also added crushed red pepper to it and it was fantabulous!  Will definitely make again!  Thanks!

My whole family loves this recipe.  I use whole wheat spaghetti in place of the Udon noodles.  My daughter is a vegetarian, so I use water in place of the chicken broth and leave out the chili paste as it has anchovies in it.   I use a few sprinkles of crushed red pepper in its place.  The meat eaters in the family enjoy this served with Asian Tuna Patties.  Makes a great, quick dinner.

This recipe was soooo good that we had it at home for two consecutive days!  could not get enough of the yummy taste.  I added the chili paste and served with left over lobster with garlic butter (we do not eat like this every day!)  The combination was great!I did follow the advise of another reviewer and topped with a bit of cilantro as well, which gave the dish a perfect "Thai" flavor.  Thank you for the recipe - I have added it to my list of favorites! (My husband was surprised at the use of honey in the sauce, but he said that the end flavor was fantastic!):-)

I thought this recipe was very good. I threw it together at the last minute with things I had at home so I used powdered ginger and no onions. I added some chicken as well. I think it would have had more flavor it I'd had fresh ginger. It was still delicious though!

Excellent. It turned out just as I was hoping it would. I used linguine, left out the chopped peanuts, and topped it with Asian Tuna Patties. The noodles tasted like they came from a restaurant. Quick, easy and cheap.

I really like this dish and so did my DH but I changed things slightly.  I cut the recipe for the sauce in half, but used about 6 oz of spaghetti.  I added more garlic than called for and about double the amount of green onion.  I also added about 1 tsp of sesame oil to my serving (DH doesn't like sesame) and the end result was great.  The only other thing to mention is that we served this dish cold...it's really good that way.

This gets a mixed review.  Hubby did not like it that much...had a hard time finishing his serving (which is really unusual).  On the other hand my son (20 months) and I LOVED it.  He kept eating it up and I went back for seconds.  Good thing daddy didn't like it because my son got to eat some leftovers the next day.  Thanks for the post.

I whole wheat spagetti noodles.  I didn't have honey so i used splenda.  I didn't have chili paste so I used a tsp of chili powder.  I didn't have fresh ginger so I used ground ginger in a smaller amount. It came out delicious!  My spouse and 6 year old daughter loved it.

I really liked this, but it needed some changes.  I cut back on the ginger (1 tsp) as well as the peanut butter (2 tbs), added more chile paste and honey, and added some sesame oil and fish sauce to add a bit more flavor.  Thank you!

I didn't follow this recipe to a "T" (I never measure and always improvise), but anyhow, I thought this was a good basic recipe for peanut sauce.  I made extra sauce to keep in the fridge so I can use it for satay or veggie dishes.  Thanks Amy for sharing!

This was interesting...

Tip for others using this recipe: pay very close attention to the sauce. Peanut butter thickens with cooking... the sauce was too thick. I won't cook it as long next time.

Noodles did not "toss" well, and stuck together (as I believe someone else mentioned)

Perhaps some peanut oil in the sauce would make the recipe a little less sticky?

I will probably make this again; but I would add more spice - it was not quite hot enough for me. 

I would also reccomend reducing PB slightly. I prefer a less powerful peanut taste.

I suggest adding vegetables and some chicken (or tofu) to this dish (as many have suggested). On it's own, it's not very filling. I didn't feel quite satisfied after eating this.

Definitely needs veges added such as capsicum (green pepper), bean sprouts, carrots, celery etc - maybe could add shredded chicken too.  I only used half the amount of sauce called for - it would be totally overpowering with all of the sauce! A squirt of lime juice before serving is essential!! 
Good base recipe.

Both my husband and I really enjoyed this meal--so much better than the asian 'kits' you buy at the store. I sort of doubled the sauce (doubled the  stock, added an extra T of soy, honey and Peanut Butter) and I found it to be perfect; plenty of sauce but not too thick.  I also added grilled chicken and veggies to make it heartier.  I look forward to making it again.

This was FANTASTIC! When I told my husband what I was making, he made a face. But he LOVED it! I didn't have any chili paste, but we love spicy foods, so I used some hot pepper sauce, sweet chili sauce, and some hot chili oil instead. Amazingly enough, the leftovers were even better for lunch the next day! Delicious!!
ADD-ON:
This is still one of my favorite dishes from here... Absolutely delicious!! Made it for my folks when they were out visiting and they loved it! (Both are very good cooks, but not keen on trying out new recipes.)

I really liked this recipe, but next time, I would make some small changes to suit my personal taste. I would add one less tbsp of peanut butter and replace it with one more tbsp of honey -  I thought it needed a little more sweetness to it. Also, I used Vermicelli, just becuase that was what I had on hand - turned out great.

I would make this again - my vegetarian friends would really like this.  I might even add some fake chicken for them - just to bring in a different texture.

I had to edit my review to add that these noodles are even better the next day - cold!

I make this dish ofetn.  It's so easy, but tastes exotic.  I add different ingredients to it depending on what I have in the house - bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, baby corn, chicken...I also skip the honey.

I used ground spices and splenda instead of honey and added more veggies.  It was terrific, especially good cold.  I added shrimp to the leftovers to give it a protein boost and it tasted great!

Oh dear. I could see how a person could really go wrong with this recipe.  First of all, double the recipe, you will need the extra sauce.  Also, I used 1/4 of the amount of chili paste and the heat turned out perfect.  I made this with a stirfry of broccoli, onion, and carrots.  With those chages, it was delicious.

Pretty good as a starting point. Like others, I used powdered ginger instead of fresh, I used about 1/2 tsp of tabasco instead of chili paste, and I used crunchy PB and omitted the chopped peanuts. I added 1/3 lb blanched sliced green beans and a handful of fresh spinach near the end and let the spinach wilt. That made it taste almost exactly like my favorite thai restaurant peanut sauce. I had to add more water because I added stuff to it, but I think what would really make this recipe outstanding is the addition of coconut milk. I'll definitely try that next time! I served it with white rice and broiled chicken breast (seasoned with garlic salt and lemon pepper, about 8 mins on each side). YUM!

almost a 5 star...excellent as is thought and i'll make this again.. Served it with coconut crispy chicken on top found on this site, although any breaded chicken would work for a east meets west combo.

Yummy!  I've tried a couple other peanut noodle recipes and the taste and texture of this sauce is my favorite.  I used spaghetti, ground ginger, and a few drops of tabasco instead of chili paste.  Added broccoli and topped with strips of fried egg.

This recipe has become one of our standard weekly recipes.  I kick up the red pepper sauce a bit, but otherwise, this recipe is awesome!  It is great with chicken or shrimp added as well, though it is equally good without.  I like to serve it with edamame on the side.

I had some extra ginger root that I didn't know what to do with and I had everything else necessary for this recipe in my pantry, so I figured I would try it out.  I'm glad I did.  It's excellent.  Just enough spice and sweetness...and very easy to throw together.  A great quick meal.

These were pretty good.  I followed the recipe except I used rice sticks (like those in Pad Thai) for a more authentic thai flavour.  I will try these again to see if they are better with other noodles.  Points for a super easy recipe though that uses ingredients that most people will have handy and can whip together very quickly.

Not as good as expected. Peanut butter sauce remained too thick, even though I kept adding more water to compensate. Noodles, when "tossed" clumped together and were hard to stir up. Sauce wasn't spicy enough for me, either. There are better peanut sauces out there. *** I am changing my rating to 3 stars the next day (from 2), as it was better cold, having sat for a day, and with some added cayenne pepper ***

Excellent recipe.  I added 6 oz of cooked chicken and it turned out great.  Plus the added protein will make it a bit more filling and longer lasting.

fabulous! i love peanut sauces, but i was tired of the thick, heavy texture. this one was much lighter, and easier to digest. i added tofu and some stir fry veggies to make a quick, easy meal...

This is a great unique tasting pasta.  I've served it on a number of occasions to many different people.  Everyone always agrees that it's great.
My only suggestion is to put the ingredient in a blend, it makes it much creamier.

My husband and 19 year old son absolutely love this dish.  I used chunky peanut butter instead of adding the chopped peanuts.  I'm SOOOOO glad I added the hot chile paste.  For us, it wasn't "optional" and really gave this dish more depth to the flavors.  I have used both the udon and spaghetti noodles with equally good results.  I usually double the recipe and add about a cup of sliced green onions to the entire dish instead of just using as a garnish.

I love finding a recipe like this- a surprise hit!  I will use this again.  Ground ginger, garlic powder, chili powder, spaghetti noodles and crunchy peanut butter work wonderfully as substitutions.  Add chopped cooked chicken to the sauce along with the green onions and this is a restaurant meal!  I loved the lightly sweet peanutty taste.  My husband, turned off by the idea of peanut butter loved it as well.  Thank you!

I used chili powder instead of the paste. Crunchy peanut butter works if you want to skip buying the chopped peanutes separately. Ground ginger is a good substitute. I like to add zucchini, red pepper and/or chicken +a touch more peanut butter, and it is absolutely delicious!

Excellent! I opted to skip the chili paste and increase both the [chunky] peanut butter and honey by almost 50% for a more *kid-friendly* version. I also used whole wheat noodles for a heartier texture. I find this to be the better of the peanut noodle recipes on this site. Enjoy!

Although I used WAY too much fresh ginger (it was terribly over-powering), this really is a delicious recipe. I will definitely make it again but use much less ginger!

The only thing I didn't like about this recipe is that I didn't try it sooner!  FABULOUS!!!  I read the reviews and used ground ginger and a little extra peanut butter.  I also used soba noodles instead of udon.  I added a splash of sesame oil and garnished with sesame seeds.  A definate keeper!  It tasted like it came from a restaurant!

Great recipe!  I followed this recipe pretty much to the letter, but used chunky peanut butter and omitted the chopped peanuts.  Next time I'll skip the green onion garnish -- it didn't really add much.  After adding the sauce to the noodles, let it sit for a few minutes before serving so the noodles can soak up some sauce and the sauce can thicken a bit. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and squeezed fresh lime juice over each serving.  That really gave it the extra oomph -- an excellent finishing touch!  I'll definitely be adding this one to my regular rotation.  Thanks for this terrific, quick meal!

Thanks for a winner, Amy!! This was awesome!!  My husband oohed and ahhed and said that we have to have this again next week.  Now, I couldn't find chili paste in any of our stores so I just used chili powder.  I'm sure it would have been spicier with the chili paste and my husband would have liked it spicier.  Also, I didn't have peanuts to put on top but it didn't matter.  It was great.  No need to change a thing on this one!!

If there was less than one star I would have used it. I cooked this for my family - thinking that the recipe sounded tasty - and tasty it was...TOO BLOODY TASTY! It burnt my mouth out. Definitely cut down on the chilli. Dinner that night was a disaster.

I did a lot of modifying on this one.  I added pork, brocolli, carrots, and mushrooms, all of which I recommend.  I used Red Pepper and chili powder instead of chili paste.  I used spaghetti noodles instead of Udon (but not necessarily "recommended" if you ask me).  In my case, there wasn't enough sauce, and I would prefer it to be thicker.  It tasted "good" but it was missing something... I think it wasn't quite sweet enough or something.  I will have to play with it; will definitely make it again but with some modifications.

This got rave reviews in our house!  I used the Udon noodles as the recipe called for and really liked them.  Great sauce!  My only reccomendation is to double the recipe for four people, especially if it's all you're serving.  8 ounces of the Udon noodles doesn't make enough for four.  I was glad I had bought extra just in case.  Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe. We too added chicken to make it a main meal dish. A nice change of pace.

Ok, this as a base recipe was ahhhhhhmazing! I effectively doubled the recipe Cos I like a lot of sauce. I also used brown sugar instead of honey since I didn’t have any and used chicken sausages as my meat....I also cut 2 small onions through the sauce... yummo! Definitely going on my make-again and often easy meal plan

I made this last night.  Delicious.  Used thin spaghetti, ground ginger and top with toasted sesame seeds since didn't have peanuts, fresh ginger or udon noodles.  Still tasted great and my son loved it!!  Thanks for the recipe, I can see many ways to change it up, like adding garlic shrimp and veggies next time.

This was simple and delicious. I added sauteed tofu to this and it was a hearty meal. I'll definitely make it again.

Flavor was great and I will make it again. However I will have to play around with liquid ingredients to  increase the amount sauce coverage, as it was a bit dry.

When I made this dish I put a little too much peanut butter but other than that was really good I would definitely make it again I use the thin pad Thai rice noodles

This wasn't terrible, but it wasn't my favorite. The peanut butter was very overpowering. If you really like peanut butter, you may like this more than I did.

I poured the sauce over  edamame fettucine noodles.  A healthy dish for a meatless dinner.

Well, this is surprisingly good! I used spaghetti, since that’s what I had in the house. I added just a touch of rice wine vinegar, and was very generous with the chili paste. Definitely a keeper, leftovers will be good cold for lunch at work.

This was alright, I probably spoiled it by accidentally letting the sauce boil. I have a different recipe for Asian noodles that we like more so I won't be making it again.

A little bit sweet for me, but my family loved it. I would try adding some bean sprouts or something crunchy to add some more texture to the dish.

This recipe was FREAKING INCREDIBLE!! Loved it!! I didn’t have udon noodles but instead used whole wheat spaghetti- it was so delicious!! The entire family loved it, which is rare! I used smuckers natural peanut butter which gave this a great flavor. Highly recommend!

I made this for dinner for my husband and almost 3 year old. It was a big hit! Next time I think I will double the peanut butter sauce recipe because it was a little dry but overall we loved it.

This recipe was so quick and easy to make, plus, it tasted better and was easier to make than my usual peanut butter pasta recipe.  For the hot chile paste, I used Sambal Oelek. The only change I made was that I used angel hair pasta, as that is what I had on hand.  This recipe will replace my other one!

Absolutely delicious and super easy to make.  I didn't have any chili paste so I added some of my favorite hot sauce to give it some heat.  Would be great with added bean sprouts and water chestnuts.

I added chicken and cooked it in chicken broth, garlic, and ginger (like another user suggested) and the chicken alone was so good, highly recommend. I lessened the ginger and added a bit more chili garlic as my roommates love it hot.

I thought this was pretty good, but hubby called it "weird". My grocery store only had a 12.8 oz. package of udon noodles, so I doubled the sauce and added some chopped broccoli to the water while the noodles were cooking, and the balance seemed right to me. Not too saucy, but also not dry.

Super delicious! I made it with vegetable broth and added an extra spoonful of peanut butter.

I loves these noodles! I make it healthier by adding shredded cabbage and carrots. Also I love cilantro, so I add that in, and use Gardein fake chicken strips!  I agree with using chunky peanut butter, adding toasted sesame seeds, and some white vinegar.   So yummy on a hot day!

This was a great starting point, I would recommend adding in some veggies and a type of meat, it really brought the whole thing together.

Love this recipe and have made it many times.  The key is fresh minced ginger.  I add julienne cut carrots, red pepper and cucumbers (seeds removed) to mine and a tablespoon of sesame oil.   Even better overnight when the flavors have had a chance to sit on the noodles.

This was pretty good! I used 1 tsp cayenne in place of the chili paste and crunchy PB (left out the peanut garnish). Added 1 lb seasoned chicken and 1/2 a bag of frozen stir fried veggies.

This is great with alterations. I used 12.5 ounce package of noodles. I doubled the sauce.  I used around 9 tbsp peanut butter, added two tsp sweet chili sauce and a squirt of hot chili sauce. I also added carrots and cabbage. I made the katsu chicken recipe from this site and served it with the dish and dipped it in the peanut sauce. It was delicious.

We really loved this! Found out we didn't have ginger root last minute & had to use Top Roman packages because our store didn't have Udon noodles otherwise, but it turned out great!! We will make again for sure & likely even without the ginger.

I followed this recipe to a T and served it as a side dish for friends who are vegan.  Hot, spicy and delicious!  Will definitely be making this again.  P.S.  I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.

This was only "OK". Then again, I substituted soba noodles for the udon, and there was amaranth mixed in with the buckwheat. As a result, the flavor of the noodles completely overwhelmed the peanut sauce. Maybe if I tried doubling the amount of sauce, that would fix the problem.
EDIT: Doubled the sauce and added some more honey, and that seemed to improve the taste. Still not great, though.

Tasted fresh!
1 lb of chicken is enough for the recipe, added extra pb. Note to self, if you want to make enough to eat and pack as a lunch for a day or two, double everything.

Fantastic!! My husband and I practically inhaled this. A fantastic balance of hot (I used siracha instead of the chili paste), sweet, and salty. Adore the udon noodles. Super easy and delicious!

A very easy way to make peanut noodles, I was concerned the sauce would not be thick enough but it seemed to coat the noodles well and have good flavor.

This was really good and really simple! I loved the balance of the ginger, garlic and chili sauce. The heat was awesome with the smoothness of the peanut butter. I sauted some chicken sliced thin and marinated in soy sauce and vinegar and some carrots for a more complete dish. I'd like to try it with lime and cilantro.

Yummy, easy dish.  made it as is for a vegetarian dinner.  chopped up some cucumbers to put on top for crunch.  even though I love ginger I would still reduce the amount.  Not only is it a lot of ginger, but it is very lightly cooked so it packs a lot of punch.  too gingery for some of my family.

Excellent recipe!  It replaced one from an older version of the BH&G cookbook that no longer appears to be published these days.  We added sugar snap peas to the pasta when there were a few minutes left on the clock.

Love this recipe! I used linguini because it was 1/4 of the price of Udon—still delicious! I also added some chicken to make it a one dish meal. Next time I think I'll add some chopped carrots or snap peas to change it up.

This turned into a great base for a meal in a bowl. I added chicken, red bell pepper, and zucchini. I also used 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes instead of the chili paste. For two people, stir fry up the bell pepper, chopped green onions, and half a zucchini, set aside. Then stir fry 8-10 oz chicken cut into strips. Add cooked noodles, sauce and veggies into pan and mix together. Top with 1/4 c peanuts and green onion. Delicious!

Great recipe. Better than store peanut sauces, which are more like Satay marinades. And this is so easy to make! Loved the vibrant ginger. You must use fresh ginger and garlic to have it not come out drab. I put chunks of ginger and garlic, the chix broth and chili paste in a blender. Cooked the chix, then froz pkg jap veggies & slivered carrots, because I love veggies, and ommitted the honey cuz the hubby doesn't like "sweet". after chix& veg cooked, added things from the blender, then opened a spot on the pan with my spatula for the spoonful of peanut butter & soy, which I chopped then stired with my spatula into the juices until the peanut butter had dissolved, then brought the veggies from the sides into the mix and incorporated throughout. In case anyone was having a hard time mixing in the peanut butter. Delish flavor.

My husband and I both really enjoyed this recipe although I made some changes. I omitted the ginger root, hot chile pasta, garlic (used garlic powder instead), onion, and peanuts simply because I didn't have these ingredients on hand. It still came out delicious! Can't wait to eat the leftovers :-)

Love the taste, and it's extremely easy to make. The only problem I came across was the portion. For some reason, it was only enough to serve 2 bowls of udon, so I ended up making a second batch.

I made this last night for dinner and we loved it! I doubled all of the ingredients for the sauce except for the ginger root. I chopped up a chicken breast that I cooked in the oven, next time I will definitely add bean sprouts and carrots, maybe even some shrimp. This tasted just like the cheesecake factory, except way healthier (no butter). This sauce would definitely go great on white rice too. This is absolutely a keeper, thank you so much!

Excellent recipe.  I did not have chili paste so I added hot sesame oil instead.  I cooked sliced red peppers with the sauce.  
I made blackened chicken and steamed broccoli.  I also used jasmine rice instead of noodles and crunchy peanut butter.

We love this recipe. It's fast and easy and hits all the right notes. The only thing I change is sometimes a teaspoon more chile paste (husbands likes it SPICY) also we use whatever noodles we have on hand- udon, soba, angel hair, or rice sticks all do the trick. I find that ginger is easier to mince when frozen, so store it in there,

This was a quick and easy-to-make dinner that was very filling.  It even tastes good when reheated!  I was looking for a gateway Asian noodle dish, and making this gives me confidence to try other recipes.

I would make this again, but with less ginger root (I substituted ground ginger, which may have been part of the problem).  While it's low-calorie, there's a lot of sodium which I suppose is part of the bargain when cooking with Udon noodles!

I followed the recipe exactly, except I added julienned carrots and chicken.
The sauce is way to thick, and the taste is not bad the first bite, but then it gets really sickening. 
I wanted to like this, but sadly didn't.

I make it as it says but I use 3 packages of ramen noodles (or I think you could use angel hair pasta as well). I sauté some matchstick sized carrots, zucchini and mushrooms until crisp-tender and mix everything up at the end. I've topped it w/ fresh cut cucumber as well. You really could add anything veggie you like. I also use 1 teaspoon of saracha for the chili paste

We used toasted sesame seeds rather than peanuts to garnish, dried chives (in sauce, he goofed), hot pepper paste from an Asian market. Sauce was runny if not heated enough or when not using pepper paste. (Which gives it a darker color as you can see in other peoples photos).

Decades ago I clipped a Peanut Butter Sauce recipe from a newspaper that I simply loved.  I lost it, however, during a series of moves.  This recipe is as good as I have found since that one.  I'll add a bit of ground cumin next time as well as a dash of sesame oil, since I remember both of those ingredients from my lost recipe.  A keeper!!

Very good sauce!  I don't add chili and I agree it needs cilantro on top!  I sauté lots of matchstick veggies as well and add meat or tofu and eggs.  Mmmmm delish!  Great for Lent too!

I really liked this recipe - so easy, and doesn't need a ton of hard-to-find ingredients like some Thai recipes. The peanut butter flavor was a little overwhelming, so I think I'll half the peanut butter next time. The chili garlic paste is 'optional' but I think it's a must! I didn't have green onions, so I made it without, but I think that is a must too, because I felt like it needed something fresh to cut the really rich flavor. I used rice noodles and tofu which are both really good for soaking up the deliciousness. Yum!

Nice sauce! Creamy and garlicy with a hint of sweetness. I didn't have chili paste, so I added a few flakes of red pepper to give it some spice. I think this is a keeper! Might try adding chicken next time too.

Well my roommate and I kind of used this as a guide, we didn't have chicken broth so we just used chicken which we cooked in the peanut butter sauce, we also added some extra veggies as well. Without the chicken broth the sauce was very dark and thick, but still very very good.

The guys in my family love this dish.  Quick and easy to prepare, we have it at least once a month.  I would add broccoli, snow peas or another vegetable to make it more nutritious, but the guys like it the way it is.  We do add chicken!

Super simple recipe! I love how quickly it was done! And my son (age 6) comes in and says "eww... gross. I dont want that". But, of course, I made him taste it. You should have seem his face change! Then he proceeded to ask for a bowl full!

This was delicious! We added less peanuts and more green onions according to what we liked. We also cooked some chicken in it; we then added the ingredients for the sauce. We tried linguini the first time but the second time we made it we used rice noodles which made it taste even better.  This can get a little dry though so I would not cook the sauce for so long.

Delicious!  I did add some strips of pork loin and cabbage.  I doubled the sauce and added a bit of cornstarch to thicken it up.  I also coated the noodles with a little sesame oil to avoid sticking.  Thank you for a new family favorite.

I was hesitant in making this since I'm not sure of how honey and hot chile paste would have tasted together.  I couldn't have been more happy with the results.  Tasted very different from how my parents made peanut butter noodles, but very satisfying nevertheless.  I made way too much sauce for my noodles so it ended up being too flavourful.  I will definately repeat this recipe adding in carrots, cucumbers, bean sprouts, and tofu.

So good!!! I used chunky honey peanut butter to scale down on the ingredients and it turned out phenomenally. It's even better the following days and good cold! mmm

My favorite recipe on this site-it's quick and easy. I recommend adding chicken or tofu and sauteed julienned carrots and green bell pepper to make a well rounded meal in itself. Extra chile paste gives it an extra kick!

I've tried another peanut noodle recipe on this website, and it simply doesn't compare to this one. This recipe is so simple and tasty! In future, I'd like to up the amount of peanut sauce for the spaghetti, since this was only just enough to cover the noodles. Terrific!

This was very good. I changed a few things and added a few things but nothing to big. I added one tsp on chillie paste instead of two and it still had a lot of kick. While making the peanut sauce It looked like it was going to be very soupy and not enjoyable but I was VERY wrong. It thickened up all by it's self. Mixed my udon noodles with the sauce then topped it off with some black sesame seeds some green onions and a little but of sesame oil. The overall taste was a explosion to my pallet, lovely hints of garlic and ginger then the peanut butter comes out. Very glad I tried this!

I LOVE this recipe!!  Because I don't like sweet I omit the honey and I don't measure anything, but kind of guess on the measurements... but it turns out fantastic every time!  Oh and I use hot chili oil because I can't find paste here, but it's pretty much the same thing.  I make this at least once a week!!  Highly recommend!

LOVE it! I made one tiny change - instead of 2 tsp hot chili paste I used 1 tsp "rooster sauce" and 1 tsp sweet chili paste. Oh, and I didn't bother with the green onion and peanut garnish because my 6 yr old doesn't like that. Phenomenal!!

Made it with whole grain spaghetti noodles, chunky peanut butter, saved the hot sauce for the side and just one clove of garlic, pressed. My 5 year old had seconds, I'm impressed and will make this again!!

I loved this recipe with a few modifications.  I only used five ingredients for the sauce: only 1 tbsp. soy sauce, cashew butter instead of peanut butter, chicken broth, garlic, and onions (No honey, you do not need it if you don't kill the sweetness of the cashew butter with too much soy sauce.).  I served it with steamed broccoli, which was the perfect accompaniment.  My boyfriend raved about these and asked me to make them again.

Followed the recipe almost exactly as written (used some other Asian noodle that was thinner), and it was awesome.  I can't believe I made something that tasted so good.  Served the noodles with some chicken...next time I'll double the sauce so there is some for the chicken as well.  I ate the noodles as is, but my hot-sauce loving fiance said they were spectacular with sriracha as a finishing touch.

Awesome recipe, thanks Amy!  My teenage son, who doesn't like ginger, loved this dish.  Notes:  The udon noodles at my local store came in 10 oz, wrapped in 3 bundles, vs 8 oz as in recipe, so I increased the sauce items proportionately. Served it with asian slaw and grilled teriyaki chicken breasts for supper. This recipe has a totally great flavor without changing a thing, but since my family likes spicy hot foods, I will add even more chile next time (oh, YES, I will definitely be making this again!).  After trying it as written with udon noodles, I would also like to try it with whole grain pasta noodles to make it a little healthier, but it's so-o-o-o-o good, I'm not even feeling all that guilty right now...please don't ask me tomorrow! ; )

I gave it four stars because it is a good base recipe, but I had to tweek it.  It needed much more sweetness.  I used corn syrup because I didn't have honey (can be used 1 to 1 in a recipe), but up it to 4 Tablespoons.  The only other difference is I used Frank's hot sauce for the chile paste and 1/4 tsp of ground ginger instead of the fresh.  The only real change I made to the recipe was the additional sweetness and it was FANTASTIC!  I served mine cold with some grilled chicken breast.  Once again FANTASTIC!

Yummy! Used a natural crunchy peanut butter and left out the chopped peanuts. Definitely use the full amount of hot chile paste. Goes great with Asian Tuna Patties from this site.

This is super tasty! As I made it, it would have been 4 stars, but I asked my husband what it needed to be 5 stars and he said "chopped peanuts and thicker sauce." I told him that the recipe calls for chopped peanuts, but I omitted them because we didn't have them and the sauce thickened in the fridge. He proceeded to laugh at me. I will be having the rest of this for lunch tomorrow with some steamed zucchini, carrots and celery. Its really tasty! Do not omit the chili! I substituted some mongolian fire oil, because we always seem to have that on hand. I am a spice wuss, but the flavor really becomes fuller when just a little bit of heat is added. It brings out so much more! I will make this many more times!

DELICIOUS! Made this just as written except for subbing lo mein noodles for the udon. My son absolutely loved this, but I knew he would because he loves peanut butter and pasta. This is best served right away, as it gets really thick and clumpy if it sits.. This was perfect in every way and I will be using this recipe often! Thanks for sharing. :)

Quick and easy for a midweek dinner. I added a chopped birds eye chilli, sliced mange tout, a drizzle of sesame oil, and topped with seared peppered beef steak. I used crunchy peanut butter as some reviewers had suggested, and this worked out absolutely fine. Overall, could be a little dry for some tastes (my boyfriend likes everything saucy!), which could be remedied by adding more stock while cooking. Will make again!

Made these noodle with whole wheat spaghetti and served with Cucumber Sunomo salad from this site for a quick and tasty, meatless meal.  I used natural peanut butter, soy I may use a bit more honey next time.  Also, its a bit salty with all the soy sauce so I will use just water to replace the chicken broth.  Otherwise, Excellent!  This will be in our regular rotation for dinner!

This is pretty good. I added jalapenos and cayenne in addition to crushed red pepper and chili paste. because I like it spicy. I will make this again, but I want to play with the ratio of noodles to sauce- I ended up with too many noodles, not enough sauce probably through my own error.

My whole family loves these noodles.  We add diced cooked chicken, shredded purple cabbage and shredded carrots.  Awesome as-is or with add-ins.

This was great! I doubled the sauce and added broccoli, red pepper, and carrots to serve it as a main dish. Next time I might add some pan-fried tofu or grilled chicken. I didn't have any chili paste but I used  about a tablespoon of red pepper flakes and a teaspoon of chili powder and it had the perfect spice level. This was really great, I'm adding it to my regular rotation! Thank you!

Very good. It tasted as good as Thai food from a restaurant. I used rice vermicelli instead of Udon noodles and tossed sliced cooked chicken and green beans and carrots with the noodles. It was a great meal. The mix of spice and sweetness were perfect. My husband (who doesn't particularly like spicy or sweet things) gobbled it up.

I feel like this was so close, but not quite the thing. I didn't use real chicken broth, maybe that was the problem, and I used powdered, not fresh ginger. Still, a splash of vinegar improved this, but I don't think I'll make this one again.

Yum!  This was really good and so easy!  My 8 yr. old loved these noodles.  Make sure to use a noodle that can take the time in the fridge without getting mushy.  Be sure to cook noodles al dente.

My husband RAVED over this (kids, too!).  It is the new family favorite!  I didn't have soy sauce on hand, so used 2 TBP of teriyaki sauce instead.  I added cooked chicken, broccoli, cucumbers, carrots, and linguine pasta.  Used one less garlic clove.  Mixed in green onions and cilantro (a must).   Flavors are just incredible!

I made with whole wheat pasta since I could not find Udon noodles here. It was still very good. I added chicken, red bell pepper, and radishes. I will be making this again.

Excellent, easy recipe!  I substituted 2 tsp Sriracha (another common chile sauce) for the chile paste added a little sesame oil and served with bean sprouts to make an easy version of pad thai!

This is the recipe I have been looking for.  It works as given.  And has the added potential to  be customized  as the occasion warrents (kids eating, less spicey) add vegetables for crunch.  Or use as a "go-with" with a protein.  I was also delighted to find Soba noodles cook so quickly. It's a perfect recipe for me to introduce the grandchildren to cooking.  Five stars and a bunch of balloons!

I used rice noodles rather than udon and they worked just great.  I also took the advice of someone else and substituted sesame oil for chili oil.  I did add a little hot sauce as well.  This dish was simple, quick and delicious.  We had cucumbers in sweet chili sauce on the side and it was perfect...

I love this recipe!!  I triple the sauce and freeze the extra so that that i can have a v. quick meal when needed.  Everytime i make this i add different veggies and sometimes chicken/tofu too.  While this recipes is very flexiable, i always also add cilantro as a garnish to make this recipes even better!

These are soooooo good!  I didnt have chopped peanuts so I used 4 tablespoons of chunky peanut butter instead.  I also left out the chile paste.  I will definitely make this again.  I think it would go great with chicken.

This is incredible! You could even use this as a stir fry sauce. I HIGHLY recommend adding water chestnuts, carrots, and snap peas if you like them. The nuts on the top is not needed in my opinion and if you choose to add chicken it is great but also not needed. This is a high protein dish because of the p-butter. Also, if you want to make this fresh get the all natural p-butter without hydrogenated oils- then it's diet friendly. In fact, I ate it after a workout.  To anyone who doesnt like this recipe...you must not like what is listed to put in it because its everything you could want if you like the ingredients.  I used left over angelhair pasta that didnt get used from speg. night. Easy and quick. If you like spicy adding the sauce is a must. However the sauce is great without it. My boyfriend put sriacha on the side and would add it in. He is a big spicy fan but really liked the sauce as is but decided he loved it spicy too. EXCELLENT dish.

Loved this dish....not only really good, but, so easy to throw together.  A very nice subtle p'nut butter flavor, not over powering at all.  I used crunchy p'nut butter thinking I wouldn't have to add the additional nuts---but, next time I'll add the nuts called for, the only thing I felt was missing.  I only used about half the chili paste too & was happy with the heat.  Update:  Liked it much better using creamy p'nut butter & then topping with ground p'nuts.  Also used the noodles from Trader Joes called:  Rice Sticks traditional Thai Style Pasta--worked perfect with sauce.

I made this using ground ginger, spaghetti noodles and dark syrup in place of the honey. The sauce was nice and thick, however, the taste of ginger was over powering. Next time I will omit the ginger and see if I like it better. Kids wouldn't even touch it.

Fantastic blend of asian-inspired spices and herbs. My husband and I tossed in chicken to simmer with the sauce. I added a little more broth to help with the bulk. Thanks for a great recipe and I'm sure to use it again!

I put half the chili sauce in and it was still very spicy for the family.  I also disliked the texture of the udon noodles (mushy). However my wife LOVED the texture.

My family really likes this dish.  I add chicken and veggies to it and make it a meal.  There is enough sauce to coat noodles, chicken and veggies.  We have different spice tolerances so I ease off on the chili paste and the people who like it spicier can spice it up on their own.  Great!!!

Creamy and delicious! Didn't use the hot chile paste, green onions and peanuts. I added 1/4 tsp of chili flakes and for vegetables, I sauteed red peppers, blanched snow peas, topped with sliced chicken and garnished with green onion and sesame seeds. My boyfriend requested that we have this meal once a week!

I made this last night, and my husband really enjoyed it. Next time I'll lower the hot chile paste (I used Sriracha) to 1 1/2 tsps as 2 tsps was too much for me! I think I will also add some toasted sesame seeds or toasted sesame oil as well, as I really missed that flavor in this dish. It felt like it belonged there, maybe I've eaten too many servings of sesame noodles to *not* expect it. I garnished with green onions and minced crystallized ginger instead of peanuts. Thanks for the recipe, I'll make this again :)

Love this! It is sooo easy to make. We add chicken and cashew nuts to make it a meal. I also use less chile paste (about 3/4 tsp) and add a little brown sugar. I also replaced the chicken broth with coconut milk. This is one of those recipes that is fantastic exactly as written but versatile enough to be tweaked to individual preferences.

Very, very good. Added julienned carrots, cucumber, red bell pepper and some leftover chicken I had on hand. I only had spaghetti noodles so used those. Finished with a squeeze of fresh lime. The kids, ages 2 and 4, gobbled it up. Agree with a previous poster that the recipe name doesn't do it justice - maybe 'Thai-Style Peanut Noodles,' instead?

Wow!  Really, really tasty!  I made the recipe as stated except with whole wheat spaghetti instead of odon noodles and omitting the chili paste, thinking it might be too spicy for my toddler.  (My husband added some Tabasco sauce to it and said it was even better.)  I turned this into a main dish by sauteing some chicken in sesame oil and garlic until the chicken was no longer pink and then adding some julienne carrots, thinly sliced red pepper, snap peas and bean sprouts.  As another reviewer noted, the sauce looks really runny before you pour it over the noodles, but it some how comes together beautifully.  All three of us enjoyed it, but my three year old was ecstatic about it!  Served with a modified version of the Mandarin Salad from this site.

I am having alot of fun trying new things on this site but this one was just not for us. I ate my portion (reluctantly finished) but my kids hated it. Not a single one of them ate more than one bite. That includes my teenager who can eat just about anything. My husband didn't even try it. Sorry, thumbs down for us.

This is a wonderful and easy recipe. I do make it our main course. I first sautee the chicken in a little olive oil and sesame oil then add all of the sauce ingredients and let it simmer. I also use linguine noodles since my local grocer does not carry Udon noodles. Thanks for a great recipe :)

This was so easy to make and SO good.  I added chicken and carrots to the sauce and noodles during the toss.  Great additions however, it would have been just as good without.  Delicious sauce!

I love this recipe! I made this for my family of four and all gave it a 10! I would say though that it is a little to spicy! I like spicy but for younger kids, way to hot. Very, very, very, good though!

This was really good. Even my 3 year old liked it. I made a couple of additions to it: I put in red chili flakes instead of hot chili paste, chicken and red peppers. I also left out the peanuts at the end. I'm not a huge fan of peanut butter but this wasn't overpowering.

This was a great change of pace to the normal weekday meals. Used udon noodles, low sodium soy sauce as per usual, powdered ginger, and chunky peanut butter as that is what was available. After pouring on the noodles I did find that it needed a bit more honey to suit our tastes but that was minor and easily fixed at the table

I really enjoyed this recipe.  The first time I made it I followed it to the T .. I thought it was 3.5 stars as is .. I have since tweaked the recipe (don't hate me..it's bound to happen)  adding 6 chili peppers and chili flakes..can you tell I like it hot? I know this would be disgusting for  most, but for the people who like it HOT, try it this way. I also added julienned carrots. YUMMY :)

This is quite a good basic recipe. However, the second time I made it, instead of the stock and soy sauce, I put in 1/4 cup of sukiyaki sauce (from Japan Mart!) It was delicious, much better than the first time I made it! You can also replace the chili paste with chili flakes if needs be. I didn't mince the ginger root - I just peeled it, then chopped it into chunks - it is important to put the ginger in the pan first, then the onions and garlic, before you add the other ingredients. I also just used chunky peanut butter instead or adding more peanuts.

This was really good.  It needs some shaved cabbage and carrots on top, but otherwise this was really perfect.  I also added some chili oil because I like spicy.  I guess I'm not much for measuring, so I just eyeballed everything (equal parts soy sauce and peanut butter, half as much ginger and honey, etc.).  It turned out perfectly.  I will totaly make this again.  It's really versatile and can be made so many different ways.

This is good but I'm not a huge fan of peanut butter.  I made half the recipe and could only eat one serving before I was done.   Also, go easy on the chile paste if you decide to use it. the 2 teaspoons listed is quite hot.

I through this together for a lunch yesterday.  Oh my yum!  I was looking for healthy, so I used spaghetti squash in place of noodles and it was still tasty!  If I make it in the future, I will most likely use glass noodles or another thin rice noodle.  I used full sodium soy sauce and it was a bit salty, so I will reduce it by two teaspoons in the future.  I also added a splash of white wine vinegar and sesame oil.  Yum!

I am shocked at how good this is!  It was so simple and I feel like I'm running a Thai restaurant.  I added some sauteed shrimp and lots of raw veggies to garnish (scallions, cilantro, shredded carrots, and cucumbers).  I also doubled the sauce but only used the original amount of fresh ginger.  Chunky peanut butter worked great and I used some wheat, pad thai rice noodles that I had on hand.  This one is a keeper for sure!

I make this dish all the time and it is always a hit.  I've made it with soba noodles and with whole wheat spaghetti noodles, enjoy it both ways.  I always double (or triple) the sauce and add tofu (which I brown in a little olive oil first) and broccoli (sometimes I brown it with the tofu or just put it in with the noodles and steam it some) to it.  I work on the tofu and broccoli after I get the sauce together and the noodles cooking ~ making it a fast and fairly easy meal.  I usually leave out the green onions and chile paste due to preference.  Thank you for the recipe, I love it!

This recipe is delicious! I've made it a few times with some changes to accomodate ingredients I had on hand: spaghetti instead of Udon, powdered ginger instead of ginger root (not as much), and chili powder with a small bit of vinegar to try to recreate the chili paste (anything hot will probably work).  Additionally, to beef up the recipe a bit, I added stir-fried tofu and vegetables (brocolli, green pepper, mushroom, and bean sprouts). I also omitted the green onion and peanut garnish.  All in all, this is a delicious recipe, and I'll definitely be making this many more times to come. Thanks for sharing!

I would suggest making a tad bit more sauce so the flavor really stands out, or use less noodles other than that it was AWESOME!!!!! I also thought adding chicken complimented the dish as well.

Easy, tasty, different! I used vegetable broth (since I'm a vegetarian) and couldn't find udon noodle :( so I used fetucinni. Yum!! Will make again and again. Served with edamame.

I served this at a Hawaiian-themed party for my Mom's 60th birthday. It was good...the noodles definitely absorb a LOT of the sauce. They are very dry. Next time I will up the sauce, add way more chopped green onion and a few chopped veggies, like red bell pepper, peas and/or carrots. Good base to start with.

Absolutely delicious! It would probably be great as a main dish with some chicken.

I added a bit of extra chili paste, threw twice the amount of green onions in instead of a garnish, and didn't add the peanuts. I cooked the noodles a bit (less than 5 mins) in the sauce and they soaked it right up.  FANTASTIC!! Salty, sweet, spicy these noodles have it all!! Thx for the recipe =))

My family really enjoyed this, even my almost two year old. I think it is worth adding the fresh ginger, I used dry and I will add sesame oil next time. I used linguini noodles but will try udon next time also.

This is one of my favorite recipes! I also added some cut up chicken and fresh lime which gave it more of a "Pad Thai" taste.

Excellent!  So easy to make and very tasty.  I doubled the recipe, and added one package of frozen veggies (peas, carrots, corn, and green beans) plus one package of enoki mushrooms that I had on hand.  I didn't have any fresh ginger, but the ground ginger was just fine.  I will try it with fresh ginger next time, as I'm sure that will be better.  I used Sriracha as the chili paste and I used crunchy PB, so I didn't add any peanuts at the end for garnish.  I will definitely make this again - a great go-to dish for nights that you don't have much time or a lot of ingredients to cook with!

I think this recipe is great.  It's even better if you add more things to it.  Whenever I make this recipe, I like to add a little more to it like chicken, straw mushrooms and bamboo shoots.  I also add more honey than called for because I like it a little sweeter.  One tip in case anyone does add mushrooms and other veggies, you should cook those things separately because they release a lot of "juices" and you don't want your noodles swimming in a broth.  I stir fry, drain, and then add the noodles with the sauce.  It turns out much better and not overcooked.  Overall, this is a great recipe.  I tend to double everything so that I make enough for left overs for a couple days.

LOVE this! It was great in original form, but I was out of a couple of things listed. In place of the chili paste, which I didn't have, I used 4 tbs, sugar, 4 tbs. lemon juice, a dash of black pepper, dash of chili powder, and a couple of extra cloves of garlic. I subbed dried shallots for the onions, since I was out of those too. Delicious!

This is one of my husband's favorites!  I used spaghetti noodles, added some grilled, asian-marinated chicken to the top, along with some cilantro as a garnish!  You can't go wrong with this recipe - delicious!

LOVED it! I've tried other similar recipes before and didn't like them at all but the salty & sweet were nicely balanced in this. I added some chopped leftover chicken and steamed veggies and it was AWESOME!!

It was definitely tasty but a little to peanuty. Next time I would reduce the peanut butter and add in some sesame oil and shiraka. I would also use different thinner noodles next time.

I thought this was terrific and plenty salty even though I substituted water for the broth and cut down the soy sauce to 1 T.  Served it over thin spaghetti.  This tastes like it came from a restaurant.  It is a new favorite.

Found this recipe a few months ago and we've had it almost every week since then.  It is everything I could want in a recipe--easy to make, adapts well to substitutions and add-ons, and the whole family loves it.  We usually add carrots, broccoli and chicken to make it a meal, and use anything from udon to whole wheat penne noodles. I haven't yet found a way to screw this recipe up.  Thank you so much for sharing this.

I made this for my kids because they love peanut butter on everything. I used regular spaghetti because I didn't have Udon noodles, and since this was for the kids I omitted the hot chili paste and the green onions. On my picture it looks a little bland but it tasted delicious.

The first time I made this recipe, I only had 1 tbs of peanut butter left...but I went with it and it was pretty good.   The second time I made it, I went with the full 3 tbs of peanut butter was was completely overloaded by the gooey-ness and sweetness. If I make it again (which I think I will), I plan to revert back to my original attempt.   I did add chili paste...oh sooooo gooood!

This is a truly amazing recipe!! I only made a few small changes: 1) I used red pepper flakes instead of hot chili paste 2)I added cilantro, shrimp, and broccoli. This had a WONDERFUL taste - better than some dishes I've had at restaurants. It was a hit with the boyfriend, too. Will make this repeatedly.

This recipe is really great. I'm not sure how anyone could say it's bland. The first time I made it it turned out a bit too spicy. I used tapatillo sauce instead of red chili paste (because I don't have that on hand), and added a small pinch of red pepper flakes. When I don't have green onion on hand, I mince up about 1/2 cup of yellow onion and sweat it in a bit of sesame oil with the ginger before adding the other ingredients. This time I also didn't have any honey, but I used about 1/4 cup of molasses leftover from another recipe, and added about 1/2 cup of water (used to help extract the molasses from the jar). I like to add some frozen peas to the finished pasta to add a little color. It's so versatile I could add just about any vegetable, cooked meat, or tofu for any occasion.

This is the best recipe for those weeknights where you didn't plan dinner and are sick of the usual... all the ingrediends are always in your fridge or freezer (where I keep my fresh ginger) and you can add whatever fresh or frozen veggies to it as well.  I use this recipe often!

A bit bland, and I even added some extra ingredients like shredded carrots, cilantro, etc. Still looking for that perfect asian noodle recipe.....

I made the sauce and had with with ramen noodles (w/o the seasoning packet).  I would not do this again.  Using ramen noodles was a mistake, they were mush and did not hold up to the sauce...it was a big (albeit yummy) mush pile. The sauce was great.....I plan to make it again with the noodles specified in the recipe.  Rating just the sauce...Yum....  will make again.

Very good flavor.  I used linguine and also substituted the fresh ginger with ground ginger instead.  I will definitely add this to my dinner rotation.  The only adjustment I'll make next time is to double the sauce, because it barely coated all of the noodles.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I used spaghetti noodles because that was all I had, and it was still delicious (although I'm sure rice noodles would be the best).  I used organic peanut butter (you know, with ingredients of just "peanuts" and "salt"), which I think added to it. I also substituted veggie broth for the chicken broth, as I am a vegetarian. I will have to try it with some veggies, pineapple chunks, and coconut milk next time... Overall, I was very impressed!  Thanks!

I'm a college student, so cooking is always difficult, but this recipe was great. For one serving, I made half a package of Ramen noodles w/o the flavor packet, drained all but 1/2 cup of the water, and added Asian salad dressing, powdered ginger, and peanut butter to taste. Fast, and I don't have to eat the leftovers for a week!

Definitely easy to prepare and fast to assemble.  The taste was bland for my palate, as well as for my husband's.  I added a bit of sweet chili sauce on mine and it was more edible.

This was good.  I added grilled chicken to it and turned it into a meal.  It wasn't very spicy so next time I will probably add more red chili paste.  Will definitely make again!

This is a very good peanut sauce, but in my opinion the hot chili paste is essential, I thought it made the dish.

Excellent dish!!!  Used fettucini noodles instead of udon, used 1 fresh red chili (with seeds) minced instead of paste, added juice from 1 lime, and doubled the quantity of PB. Topped with  raw grated carrot and bean sprouts.  Will try with diced marinated tofu next time.

So good - loads of ginger flavor!!!  I almost ate the whole bowl, but I'm glad I didn't, because they were even better the next day!  Next time I'll try adding chicken and some veggies.

Delicious! I used whole wheat spaghetti instead of udon noodles and red chili sauce instead of the paste because it was what I had. The peanuts and chopped green onions were the perfect toppings to this dish. Next time I might cut down on the peanut butter because it was a little thick. Overall, a great recipe that I will definitely try again!

Wow I cannot believe how good this recipe is! I used spaghetti noodles as it was all I had, but I don't think I'll bother trying other noodles the next time, because this was perfect! I cut the chile paste in half, and it was still pretty spicy.  Thanks for such a quick and delicious recipe!!

This was so much better than I was expecting.  I cooked ground chicken first and then added the ingredients into the chicken.  I doubled the sauce due to using the chicken.  It was fantastic!

I think this is my husband's new favorite thing to eat. I don't like ginger or peanut butter, and I still thought it was pretty tasty! I threw in a little bit of brown sugar since I didn't have enough honey, I think it was an ok substitution.

This is amazing.  The best part is that both adults and children love it.  I tell the adults it is "Thai" noodles and tell the kids it is "peanut butter noodles".  I didn't have chili paste so used a pinch of dried chili pepper seeds.  I also used spaghetti and spaghettini noodles....tonight I am making it with multicolored spiral noodles and adding some chicken to it.

I made this recipe for a Girls Night dinner and it was fantastic! I followed the directions pretty much exactly, but using crunh peanut butter in place of the extra peanuts. I cooked up some cubed chicken breasts with green beans and carrots and tossed that with the noodles in the sauce. Fabulous! I'd definately make this again and again and again....

Very, very good and very easy. You might want to make a little bit more of the sauce -- there wasn't quite enough to coat all the noodles (I used lbs. of rice noodles).

This was great!  It tastes a lot like what I get at one of my favorite local restaurants.  I used Asian noodles - (the flat ones that look like fettucini).  The sauce IS a little sticky like someone else mentioned, where the noodles stuck together a little.  But aside from that this was awesome and I'll definitely make it again.  I served it with a pork satay I got out of a magainze and that was excellent.

Soooo good! I used fettucini noodles and added a bit more peanut butter. I also added fresh cilantro and shredded cabbage and carrots. It was awesome...(I halved the recipe just to try it out first and ate the whole thing!) My husband tried it and really liked it too, but had already ordered a pizza. More for me!

Pretty good recipe, and totally easy. I used egg noodles because that was what I had and they worked out fine. I think I added a little too much peanut butter so I think I will reduce or just watch my portions better next time! Added frozen stir fry veggies too.

This came out SO GOOD! I had to make a few alterations based on what I had on hand. I doubled the peanut butter as suggested, omitted the chili paste, and used angel hair pasta since that's what I had. I used chunky peanut butter and didn't sprinkle peanuts on top at the end. I also didn't have any green onions, but I will use them next time. It came out GREAT and I will add this recipe to my common meals.

This sounded wonderful and had a nice taste but I think the sauce was way too thin.  I made a double batch of sauce and added rotisserie chicken, thinly sliced red pepper, carrots and steamed broccoli.  Easy, healthy and low fat.  I tried another from a different website that was creamy, smooth and wonderful.  Maybe try again with less broth.

Love it!  Reminds me of a nice Thai dish.  I used spaghetti as my noodle and ginger in a jar since I wanted to make this spur of the moment and didn't have time to grocery shop!

I thought it was pretty good.  A little too much peanut butter taste.  I didn't have ginger, so maybe it needed it.  I used 3 heaping teaspoons of chili garlic sauce, water instead of broth (I didn't have any broth on hand), and I didn't have any green onions, which probably could've helped too.  I'll try again with all the ingredients!

This is a must try dish.  I was a bit surprised it tasted so good.  Call it Asian Influenced Comfort Food.  From start to finish it took under 15 minutes to prepare.  I used vegetable broth since I didn't have chicken stock on hand.  The chopped peanuts on top are vital.  They add much needed texture to the dish.  You could add your favorite protein to make this a one dish meal.

These noodles had a great flavor although next time I would try adding a few other ingredients to make it more interesting.  Perhaps some chicken and other vegetables would make this recipe a five...it is really close.  Enjoy!

This was a very simple and quick recipe. I substituted water in place of the chicken stock to make it vegetarian. My only complaint was that it was a little sweet. In the pan it tasted fine, but after time it seemed to get sweeter. Next time I'll add more soy sauce.

Very good recipe! Wonderful as is, or with 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper to make it a little spicy. I like it chilled with veggies cut into match sticks (broccoli and carrots are good) that have been lightly steamed and then top it with sesame seeds.

YUMMY!  My boyfriend said it was "killer", meaning he REALLY liked it, which is awesome because he is pretty much a meat and potatoes kinda guy and that gets pretty boring sometimes.  This is really good if you are in a hurry but want something really "good", not some packaged .  I used whole  wheat spaghetti, broccoli florets and sliced carrots.  Next time I will add chicken and some sweet red pepper.  It was a little bit too salty for me as well, so I would try low sodium broth instead.

This was a hard one to rate.  I did as some of the others said & I enjoyed it.  My husband & two children & my daughters girlfriend would not eat it.  My kids eat EVERYTHING, I have taught them well so it is never an issue but they chose to have peanut butter & jelly sandwiches for dinner instead of this.  I will not make it again.

My kids (ages 15 and 13) rate this an "11 and a half"!  They even take it cold for lunches!  We added some chicken chunks sauteed with sweet hot mustard in order to get a little more protein.  Very yummy!

Yum!  I made only a few changes based on what I had on hand.  I sauted green beans, red peppers and chicken in sesame oil.  Then I mixed in the rest of the sauce ingredients.  I didn't have garlic, ginger or green onions today, so I used dry spices instead.  Very, very good.  And it's child-friendly but very grown-up tasting.

Easy and tasty.  Browned the chicken in the pan then added the chicken broth and other ingredients.  Also added some green beans (got to have a vegetable hidden in there if you are serving kids).  They loved it-no whining or complaining at the dinner table.

Yum!  Make vegan by replacing honey with agave nectar.  I added chick peas, sunflower seeds, and some flax (for extra post-workout protein and a nutritional boost).  Tasted great on regular pasta.  The meat-eating boy loved it, and didn't miss a thing!  Curry paste or chili powder can provide the kick if you don't have chili paste.

I doubled the recipe. While the noodles and sauce were cooking I sauteed up some thinly sliced strips of pork chops, along with some cabbage, snap peas and carrots.  When it all came together it was delicious.  Fresh ginger is fantastic!  When we played "guess the ingredients" at supper no one got them right.  I subbed red pepper flakes for the chile paste(just a few shakes) Simply delicious.  :)

This was fast, tasty, and inexpensive to make. I didn't even use fresh garlic or ginger (used powder/ground instead) and it still tasted great. I used chunky peanut butter and didn't add the nuts or green onions on top.

I make this dish all of the time now, though I do make a few adjustments. I'm not a big fan of udon noodles, so I use straight cut rice noodles in their place. I have also used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, mostly because I didn't have any chicken broth on hand, though this would be a handy substitution for vegetarians. I also throw in some sliced mushrooms with the simmering sauce, which adds good flavor and texture. Overall, I love this dish and I think adding mushrooms really makes it five stars.

This was pretty good.  I do think it would of been better with a smaller noodle - a spaghetti or a soba noodle.  I did not have hot chile paste so added red pepper flakes.  Not bad but not sure I'll make this again.

This is so addicting.  This is the second time in one week that I have been asked to make this recipe.  I added some thinly sliced red peppers to the noodles.  Absolutely Amazing.  Great flavor of Salty, Sweet, and Spicy.

Amazing recipe! I wanted something with peanut butter with the hope that my 6 year old might stray from his peanut butter and honey sandwiches. It worked! This was sooo yummy that the adults AND the kids couldn't get enough. I'll be making this over and over again.

This is a wonderful, easy, super fast way to change things up a bit.  It's pretty filling, but does not make very much at all, so to turn it into an entree for 2, I just added some sauteed chicken cut into small pieces and nearly doubled the amount of noodles.  There is plenty of sauce to cover everything.  I am a very slow cooker when making something for the first time, and this took me only about 45 minutes from start to finish.  Great weekday meal!

This recipe was delightful. I would suggest however using a garlic press for the ginger. My kids loved it until they bit into a piece of ginger. Otherwise fantastic!!

This was fantastic! It tastes a lot like Thai restaurant quality (and my husband loved it, too). I didn't have fresh ginger so I used 2 tsp dried ginger, put in crushed red chili peppers for the hot chile paste, and omitted the crushed peanuts. It had just the right amount of spiciness. I let it simmer a bit too long so it wasn't very liquidy. The next time I won't simmer it quite as long, but it still tasted delicious! I served it along with chicken satay from this website and neither lasted long at all. Thanks for the post - I'll be making this many times in the future!

My husband really liked this. He added red pepper paste to his, but I left it off mine. I thought the taste was good, but I wasn't as thrilled as he was.

I made this sauce exactly per the recipe. It was okay. Needed a little something, but not sure what exactly. I did add stir-fried chicken and bean sprouts to make this a complete meal in an of itself. We'll make it again.

Very good. I cook for someone on a no/low sodium diet therefore nearly omitted the soy sauce. I used low sodium chicken broth and water to make up for the missing liquid. Was still very tasty.

good overall taste, but something was just a little off.  Maybe it was with the fresh ginger root-should probably be grated and not diced and it needed a little lime juice. It was a little gooey, but that could be the pnut butter I use(smart balance).  I would try it again though.

Awesome!  I love it.  Its like Pad Thai only easy!  I used 2 teaspoons of chili paste and it was perfect!  I may add lime and bean sprouts next time.  I might mix in the green onions and chopped peanuts to make sure they don't all fall to the bottom.  But the recipe is excellent as is.  LOVE IT!

Very tasty. I could not find Udon noodles, but if I had, I'm sure it would have been even better. I used regular spaghetti noodles. I served it with a simple cucumber salad.

It was edible, but disappointingly heavy/overflavored. It seemed like the soy sauce might have been too much or it needed more of a rice vinegar taste to balance it out. We added lime juice and that helped.

Very good!! Does remind me of Cheesecake factory Thai Chicken.  I used 4 tbsp peanut butter and added thawed, deveined, no tail shrimp.  I cooked two packages of Ramen noodles (without the spice packet). Then topped it with bean sprouts, onions, and peanuts.  Will definitely make again!  Pretty fast recipe.

This was very fast and good. I used spaghetti noodles and chunky peanut butter. I also used crushed red pepper flakes in place of hot chile paste, about 1/2 tsp of dried ginger, and a little less garlic. I would have liked the green onions and chopped peanuts but they were not available at the moment. I sauteed some large shrimp in butter and tossed them on top. Yum!

This is awesome! I made it tonight and although I made so many mistakes (read on) it was fabulous! Even my 2 year old polished off two toddler servings! 

I seasoned chicken strips in soy sauce and sesame oil, cut them up, then poached it in chicken broth. Then I removed the meat and set it aside.

I used the broth to make the peanut sauce. We have a great ginger and garlic chilli sauce that we can get here in Singapore so I added that and it gave a real nice flavor to the sauce (but we do like our food spicy as possible). If you want a similar effect, I believe US folks can get a Vietnamese Siracha Chilli sauce from most Asian markets/grocery stores... 

But I ended up making the sauce too runny because I used too much chicken broth... and the sauce ended up too salty because the chilli sauce is salty and I also threw in some fish sauce which my husband loves... so I had to save it somehow... So I ended up watering it with water, then thickened it with cornstarch and let the sauce simmer a bit and it actually worked out alright!

O yes, last note: I used a silky egg noodle (sometimes called Shanghai noodle) which has a little bite but is also super silky and complements the robust sauce nicely.

OK...  ~ I wanted to love it because I'm a big fan of Thai/Spicy foods!... I added some slivered carrots, sesame seeds and cilantro along with the peanuts and green onions.  For the spice, I added 1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper... I would have liked more peanut taste, but because I used dried ginger it was too overpowering (my fault)!.. I should have decreased the amount!  I also used regular spaghetti instead of Soba noodles as suggested in the caption under the photo; it soaked up all the sauce and was a dry and had a pasty texture.    If I make again, I would double the sauce; I don't think I'll make it again.  Looked pretty though!

Absolutely awesome!!!  Can't imagine why anyone would rate this less than a 5.  We added grilled chicken, cilantro and vidalia onions instead of green onions (we were out).  Used a bit less chili paste too.  My 4 and 2 year old daughters LOVED it - two very tough customers!

Very good recipe. I decorated the dish with lime wedges (a squeeze of lime taste great) and garnished with fresh chopped cilantro. It was pretty dry the next day so I might play around with adding a bit of peanut oil to the recipe next time. Thanks!

This is a keeper. I couldn't find udon noodles or even soba noodles so I use whole wheat spaghetti. The garlic was a little over powering (and I am a garlic lover) but it could have just been that the garlic I used was really strong. Overall it's a great recipe. I served it with grilled pork chops that I merinated in asian spices. My 8 year son ate three servings!

I LOVED this recipe!  I went off the other comments and used chunky peanut butter and I also cut the chili paste in half and used Sriracha instead.  It was SOOO good, still a little spicy for me.  The green beans really added to it.

This was pretty good.  I didn't change the recipe except that I used chunky peanut butter instead of smooth.  Since the recipe calls for adding peanuts at the end, I didn't change it at all really.  
I think I may have cooked the soba noodles too much.  I didn't like their texture very much, but the sauce turned out pretty well.
I'd venture another try at this recipe, maybe using different noodles or cooking the soba slightly less.

These were great.  Not really like any traditional dish I ever had, but so easy to make and the kids like it (without the chili paste which I put in my own).  I may have used a little less ginger next time, the fresh stuff was strong.

this is wonderful, my daughter literally begs me weekly to make this....it helped to get my family to branch out a little bit from the normal and now they really enjoy more "exotic" recipes-thank you! Update: Still a house favorite...a terrific pair for this is another of my daughters favorites mahogany chicken wings from this site as well.  We use chicken things or drumsticks instead but it is great with this recipe because you can use the chicken and make a quick broth and the marinade I just cook and add in the chicken broth and peanut butter and voila! its a "double" coupon kind of meal!

I found this a little bit thick and "gluggy" when hot, but I put the leftovers in the fridge and in the morning I added a couple of handfuls of baby spinach, some cooled fried tofu and several good squeezes of lemon juice......  mmmmmmmmm, the result was the most delicious salad lunch!  Thanks, will make again as a salad.

So without any fresh ginger (I used ground) peanuts, or udon noodles on hand it still turned out perfect.  I used linguine noodles since a lot of other recipes I saw used them.  The only issue with this is you have to eat them right after you make them since they soak up all the moisture and get sticky after a bit.  But the taste is great!!!  My husband actually asked me to make them again, I think I'll add chicken next time.

SO good and sooo easy to make I just made it now, because I bought some udon the other day and wanted to get rid of it. (and I am addicted to anything including peanut butter...)

I didn't use honey, because I am vegan (used sugar instead...)

Will definitely use this recipe again =).

This was very good and easy to make.  I did make some changes.  I used egg noodles since the kind it called for looked gross.  I did not use chili paste and instead of fresh ginger and garlic I just used poweder.  I was good.  I will double the sauce recipe next time and I will add veggies and chicken to it as well.

I made a few substitutions to the original recipe.  We have a peanut allergy in the family, so I used Sunbutter (sunflower seed peanut butter alternative) and omitted the additional peanuts.  I used crystallized ginger, minced, and a dash of cayenne pepper instead of the hot chile paste (to keep it kid-friendly.)  I didn't have any green onions, but that flavor combination would have been great.  As it was, I used green peas and warmed them in the sauce before tossing with the noodles.  My sauce separated as the Sunbutter melted, but after whisking a minute or two it came back together.  This was a very tasty dish.  I'd give it a 4.5 stars the way I prepared it.

Great flavor and easy.  The sauce was quite runny and there was a lot of extra sauce.  Next time I'll double the noodles but not the sauce.

this recipe was wonderful. Along with the noodles, i fried some chicken in a flour and coconut mixture. The crispy coconut batter on the chicken was great covered in this sauce. I also added cream of coconut into the sauce. thanks for the great recipe

YUM! I used spaghetti noodles and powdered ginger because it was what I had on hand--but I'm sure udon would make it even more delicious! I had no green onions and I added extra garlic, simply because I love it. This is an AMAZING dish and I can't wait to make it again!

This recipe is excellent. I doubled it for a family of five and used 1/2 jarred chicken base, 1/2 my homemade chicken broth, ginger spice, and spaghetti noodles. I did not add the garlic or green onions, but I am sure it would be great with them.

Quick, easy, and satisfying.  I have had trouble finding a good peanut sauce to liven up my stir-fries, and this one did nicely.  I stir-fried some frozen veggies (sugar snap peas, red bell pepper, carrots, and mushrooms) in a saute pan, and then added the pasta and sauce to that pan when they were ready.  My husband and I went back for seconds and thirds!

so simple and fantastic.  I used a ton of veggies and whole wheat pasta, low sodium soy, reduced fat peanut butter and water instead of broth to reduce fat and sodium.    it was delicious, I can't wait to make it again.

It was tasty but I think 3 teaspoons of peanut butter was WAY too much!  It was so peanut buttery it was almost stomach turning.

I think it would be perfect with about 1 teaspoon of butter.  I also used Cayenne Pepper instead of the hot sauce and that was very good.

I doubled the pasta and tripled the sauce (because I was making it a day ahead and didn't want it to dry out).  I also added red peppers and instead of green onions, sauteed some regular yellow onion.  My honey was buckwheat honey - with its own distinctive taste - but it did not detract from the flavor at all, if anything, it complemented the ginger.  I also added a teaspoon of toasted sesame oil to the finished sauce, and voila!  Delicious.  However, the next day, the noodles tasted a bit oily from the peanut butter (i am guessing i used more than specified in the recipe as pb is very difficult to measure so i eyeballed it).  Next time I will try and use the exact proportions of pb to broth.

I had never tried Udon noodles and I wasn't crazy about them.  If you don't like mushy noodles, then these aren't for you.  The sauce tasted good and it was easy, just the texture of the noodles turned me off.  Maybe I'll try this with Top Ramen noodles, that would be good.

Oh wow!  Just fabulous!  I used whole wheat spaghetti and 1 tsp of red pepper instead of the chili paste.  Also used 1 tsp of ground ginger because I didn't have any fresh.  It was plenty spicy for my family.  I added broccoli, mushrooms, and chicken for a fantastic meal!  I did thicken the sauce with about 1 tsp of cornstarch.  Perfection!

I may be biased, since I love Asian flavors... but these noodles were really incredible. I followed this recipe exactly and was very pleased with the result!

My family enjoyed this recipe, although I thought it was a bit salty. I substituted reg. pasta for the udon noodles and 1/8 tsp. red pepper flakes for the chili paste. I added match stick red, orange & green peppers for color and a sliced onion that I sauted.  Served it w/ a marinated sesame ginger turkey tenderloin and the flavors were a nice match.  This recipe would also be great with chicken added.  Will make again.

I made this once and my family loved it, so I am making it again tonight!  I love this recipe because it is quick and easy.  The only trouble that I had was that my sauce became too thick and it was a tad on the salty side, so I added more honey to sweeten it up and some water to thin it out, and it was perfect!  I also added tofu and veggies (carrots and broccoli).  I will follow others' sugegstions tonight by adding some coconut milk.

I made this twice--once with spaghetti and once with udon noodles; we preferred the spaghetti, we just liked the texture better.  The sauce was a little bit thinner than I would like---maybe I'll up the peanut butter next time, either way, it was pretty good.

This is yummy!!  I make this when my husband isn't watching, because he wouldn't appreciate the dish is he saw peanut butter going into it. OMG! It's delish! I serve with salmon fillets that are individually wrapped, and drissle some of this sauce over the top before baking. There's lots of sauce and I prefer the noodles not soupy. Then I place the fillet right on top of the noodles. QUICK, nutritious and YUMMY dinner!  Great job posting this one!

I used veg broth & spaghetti because I couldn't find Udon noodles. We don't have Asian markets where I live in Colorado. I made as directed & added carrots & red pepper & didn't add the peanuts on top. I added pork from 'Indonesian Pork Satay' from this site, please see my review, the pork went very well with this. There was enough sauce for the extra veggies & meat I added which was great. Adding veggies & meat made this a little complicated so I don't know how often I will make it, the noodles alone are a snap. Thanks Amy.

This recipe was great! Really easy and fun ingredients. My roomate and i decided it would be our faux pad thai when i'm feeling lazy. Great and versatile, can add just about any veggie, i'll be trying bean sprouts and carrots next time.

i liked this recipe just because it was so different.  the taste was good, but i still prefer the traditional red sauce for noodles.  i didnt add crushed peanuts, and if i were to make it again i would use chunky peanut butter or crushed peanuts to give it some texture and make it even more interesting.  thanks for sharing.

Did anyone else notice that this tastes almost exactly like Oriental Flavor Ramen Noodles?  I really did expect more from this recipe, but my husband said he actually preferred the taste/texture of the ramen noodles.  Sorry; probably won't make again.

What a delicious recipe!  After eating at a noodle shop in Athens, GA over the weekend, I was looking to create a similar dish on my own.  What a find this recipe was!  I didn't have garlic cloves so used powdered.  Didn't have peanuts so used chopped cashews.  I used the optional hot chili paste (2 t)  Be careful with this if you don't like "heat"!!)  I added cooked, chunked chicken.  Next time, I'll add veggies - maybe peas or broccoli.  A real hit with the family!

Very good. I stir fried some turkey strips and then mixed them in with the sauce and noodles. I think what made this recipe work so well  was using equal amounts of dark and light soy sauce. This is a definite keeper!

I didn't particularly like this but my spouse liked it alot.  I found it bland but I may have cooked too many noodles for the amount of sauce I had.  Next time (because DH likes it!) I will double the sauce and maybe use a bit more PB to make it thicker.  As others, I used red pepper instead of chile paste.

I used Jif extra crunchy peanut butter, which made the noodles turn out slightly...  glutenous, which definitely lowered the appeal.  I think the recipe has potential though and want to try it again with some organic peanut butter from Whole Foods.

Very good!  I added 3T coconut milk to the sauce plus red bell pepper and cilantro to the noodles.  I also used Chinese glass noodles. It tasted like something I'd get from our favorite Thai restaurant.

This was so simple and satisfying! I followed the recipe except I added a sliced raw carrot to the noddles (I used spaghetti) a few minutes before draining them. I garnished the dish with the green onions, a sliced hard cooked egg, a few drops of sesame oil and a splash of rice vinegar. I'm looking forward to the leftovers as I made a double batch. I will make this again but will try whole wheat noodles instead.

Great taste - easy to make. Added chicken chunks as it would be lacking something without protein in it. If you like peanuts - you'll love this dish! Did it again minus chicken - still a GREAT, tasty dish!

Very good.  Made this for dinner last night and wasn't quick enough to beat my husband to the leftovers for lunch today (bummer).  Tasty!  I used a whole package of Barilla Plus spagetti and so I doubled the sauce.  It was just right.  For us, one generous teaspoon of chili paste was just about right (for the doubled recipe).  I added some cut up grilled chicken and some thinly sliced raw veggies (red pepper, zucchini) to make it a one dish meal.  I will certainly make this again.

I left out some ingredients just b/c I didn't have them on hand.  I left out the peanuts and the chili paste.  Maybe that is why I did not care for this recipe.  Too peanut butter tasting.

Personally, I thought this dish has waaaaaay to much PB in it - I would cut it down by at least a tablespoon if I made it again.  It was just too rich.  Also, tasted better the second day when I ate them cold.  Thanks for the recipe, Amy.

This recipe was amazing. Just add a little more garlic, honey, and peanut butter to your own preference of thickness for the sauce, and it's wonderful!

Excellent! I added a little bit of shredded carrot on top, otherwise kept everything the same. My husband loved it, my two EXTREMELY picky kids rated it "a little bit messy" and " a little too spicy" but both wanted me to make it again.

i used spaghetti noodles, and added cayenne pepper. also i used ground ginger instead of fresh. after reading others reviews (while making this dish!) i went to taste it and see if it needed more honey or broth, or if it was too "peanuty". i thought it was heavenly. i'll throw in chicken or tofu next time (i served it to my son with chicken strips and ate it plain myself -- i'm a veggie but none of my boys are). yummy yummy, thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! My boyfriend and I agree that this is even BETTER than the Thai Chicken at Cheesecake Factory. We didn't have chile paste, so we added some black pepper and some hot pepper. We added carrots too, which really added to both taste and texture. And it was so easy to make! Thanks Amy!

Very good.  I added some broccoli and julliened carrots when the noodles were almost done cooking.  I wish I had added even more as they were a delicious addition and made this a complete meal for me.  Great leftover cold for lunch!

This recipe is really good.  I make it all of the time.  I do not use the chili paste because it would be too spicy.  I also don't add the chopped peanuts or the green onions.  It is espcially good with asian marianted chicken and grilled veggies!

Tasted like I dipped the pasta into a jar of PB. Very overpowering, very heavy. Next time I'll just use a classic Thai peanut sauce recipe instead of this.

I thought this was a great recipie.  I must admit I cheated.  I used noodles I already had in the cubbord and  added mixed veggies.  I used garlic powder, ground ginger and I used cayenne pepper instead of hot chile paste.  It only took 15 min to make.  I tossed the sauce and veggies with the noodles.  Let it set for 5 minutes.  Yum.  Not runny at all.  Thanks for the recipie. Husband loved it. Will make it again.

This recipe was okay, but we had to cook something else for the kids.  I used the suggested amount of chile paste and that was a big mistake.  I don't know what others are using, but mine comes from a local oriental market and it's really spicy! My husband warned me but i didn't listen.  It was tolerable for us and we ate it, but if i try it again for the kids I'll cut the chile paste down to a quarter of the amoutn in the recipe.

These were good, though I was the only one at the table that ate them.  My husband thought they were terrible, though his palate is pertty unadventurous.  The kids didn't care for it either.  I think that with a bit of fiddling this could be improved.  It just tasted too much like noodles with Jiffy on them.  But it is a good place to start if you can't get good take out.

These are great and uber-easy to make...only thing I would suggest is simmering the peanut sauce a bit to thicken it, it was a bit runny. But! Runny, yummy sauce is still yummy!

This is a really good recipe. Since I have little ones, I left out the hot chile paste. It was great. I also used spaghetti noodles and everyone liked it! Thanks!!

This recipe is a KEEPER!  It was especially delicious with a grilled Ahi dinner.  Everyone wanted MORE.  I've had several requests to fix this again!

It's just peanut butter and noodles, but the ginger and honey make it impressive.  I served this for a co-worker and she said it was great, but would have added more spice to it.  I thought it was fine, though!

My husband and I both really liked this. It's fast, easy and adaptable to whatever vegetables are on hand. We sautee the vegetables, add the sauce ingredients and proceed as directed. Yummy stuff! Next time I'll double it.

Very very good!!  My entire family (kids included) loved it!  I had to improvise a little bit, due to being out of some things and wanting to make this recipe last minute, but it still turned out very well.  I'll definitely make it again!

I made this with Thai rice noodles and added beansprouts, egg, chives and chicken to the dish.  Next time I will use ginger already minced, and less of it.

I enjoyed this.  Used crunchy peanut butter and omitted the peanuts, whole wheat noodles and let it sit for a bit after the noodles were mixed in with the sauce.  Nice taste.

GREAT recipe!!!  Used spaghetti, ground ginger, ground chili powder, chunky peanut butter, and a little ground red pepper.  Came out wonderful!  Even my picky kids enjoyed it.  Will definately make again!

Better than the sesame noodles recipe I got from Food Network.  I also added chunked chicken breast sauted with soy sauce.

With a few additions, this made a great main dish.  We followed the recipe exactly, except for substituting 1 tsp ground ginger for the fresh.  Then we sauteed some chicken breast pieces, and some fresh broccoli, carrots and celery to add in.  The amount of heat was just perfect (I think chili paste always goes well with peanut butter), and this is a great way to use up leftover meat and vegetables at the end of the week!

Very tasty! The sauce was more soup-like than I had thought it would be, which actually worked well. 3 out of 4 of my Chinese dining companions thought it had a good flavor, as well (the 4th doesn't like peanut butter, and suggested sesame paste would have been better).

My husband and I love this one! I used 1/2 TBSP ground ginger instead of fresh, added sauted chicken, mushrooms and tofu. With all the added things, we ate it as a main dish. Very Yummy!!

Not bad.  The sauce seemed too thick to me.  I might try again someday making half the amount and adding some butter as well.  My daughter couldn't stand this.

I love these noodles - I make them with plain spaghetti, omit the ginger and chili paste (can't stand either), and add a splash of cider vinegar.  They go great with 'asian tuna patties', also off this site and some steamed broccoli.

Delicious!!  I made this recipe for my husband and I and made my 11 and 9 year old something else thinking they wouldn't care for the taste or spiceyness.  It turned out they had to try our meal and ended up eating the rest AND requested it tonight for dinner!!

Loved this!  I might try adding a tiny bit of lime juice to the sauce next time to brighten it up a little.  Grilled/sauteed chicken would've been great, too.  Wonderful flavor---much better than Chinese take-out!

This recipe was easy and good.  I left out the ginger (had none) and substituted red pepper flakes for the chili paste.  Very tasty!  This would be good on Ramen noodles too.  I will make this again :)

This recipe was a bomb with my kids and my husband.  My two year old isn't what I would call a finiky eater, but she refused to eat this!  Just isn't the right flavor combo for my family of pasta lovers.

Very quick, easy, and tasty!  Even my BF enjoyed it and I thought for sure he would be grossed out by it!  The only change I would make next time is to reduce the amount of peanut butter.  I cut the recipe in half for just the two of us and the 1 1/2 T of pb was still a little too much.  I'll take it down to 1 T next time but just for personal preference.
