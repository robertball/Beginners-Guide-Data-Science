Perfect recipe for all those plums you don't know what to do with.  I added two eggs because mine were small and sprinkled my plums with cinnamon and vanilla before adding the batter.  After putting the batter on top I sprinkled just a little brown sugar on the top. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I wanted to in corporate oats into the crust so I halfed the flour and added quick cooking oats in replacement. I also used brown sugar instead of white sugar an omitted the egg. It made for a more visually appealing dessert and was absolutely delish!

Needed something extra so I added allspice and vanilla with a dash of cinnamon...I also mixed all the dry ingredients with the egg and butter. Poured it in a pie pan! Then added some various berries on top! It is a really good summer treat!

I didn't have plums so I used 2 cups of frozen blueberries. Added a dash of cinnamon and it was perfect! I did end up baking it longer but ohhh, yummy! I can't wait to make it with plums :)

My Santa Rosa plums were too tart for this. It needed  a lot more sugar. I used half whole wheat and half regular flour. I added cinnamon and vanilla. I didn't add all of the butter, and actually substituted the I Can't Believe It's Not Butter cooking stick. I like a crisp with an oatmeal topping better.

Came out perfectly the first time; a very simple and VERY yummy recipe. I found I needed about 55 minutes to brown the crust. 

I'm already getting requests to make another!

Used 8 plums and cut sugar by 1/4 cup.  Added a few shakes of cinnamon and some vanilla.  Think for my taste next time I would add 1/4 t. almond extract as well.

Quite good, rather like the dessert often called "French apple pie", just fruit with a light cake-like top.  Like others had suggested, I added vanilla, and allspice, and finally, sprinkled the topping with brown sugar.  It took about 45 minutes to bake; top had a very thin crunchy layer but airy cake under it.  My plums were small, and tart;  I used15 of them, due to their smaller size. The finished product was a good blend of a tart fruit bottom and sweet cakey top. Definitely plan to serve this with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, or even a mild pouring custard; you'll find it far more delightful that way!  It kept well for two days, but then put it, covered, in the fridge, and it went downhill within 10 hours: got a bit mushy and too moist.   Will make it again when I have too many plums, nectarines, or peaches, and will add more allspice to the fruit before putting on the topping layer.

This was a very tasty and easy recipe! I used our Satsuma plums which can be a little tart, so next time I will add more sugar and maybe some vanilla.

I used egg substitute and did not use butter. I did add cinnamon and vanilla and sprayed the top with Smart Balance spray. I also cut the sugar in half because our fruit was sweet. I used fresh picked peaches and plums. I will make again but I think I will bake for 30 instead of 40 minutes. It was quick, easy, delicious and crunchy. Thanks!

The flavor was great, tart and sweet.  I should have had some nice vanilla ice cream on top.

I made this last night and my husband and I both really liked it.  I combined suggestions from others and will mention them here.  I will say that the plums I had were straight from the tree in western Colorado, and were tart as well as small.  I agree with those who said it doesn't matter how many plums you use but since I reduced the sugar by a third, it is indeed important to have some vanilla gelato or ice cream to put on top.  It is delicious this way, for those who don't need really sweet desserts.  Other changes: Reduced overall sugar by 1/3, and 2/3 of the remainder was brown sugar. Substituted quick oats for 1/2 of the flour.  Added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. vanilla.  I agree with someone who said this could be warmed for breakfast.  Absolutely.

Soooooo the other day I was feeling awful and I asked my husband to go to town and get me some ginger ale and Tums.  Sweet guy....he looked at me kind of funny but later he returned with the requested soda and three of the biggest honking plums I've ever seen in my life.  Close to grapefruit size.  I like plums in moderation but I dislike wasting food; hence, the hunt for a recipe that could use these monsters.  I know there are a boat load of different varieties, so for this recipe I would have appreciated some guidance on how many cups of actual plum.  I read all the reviews to give me an idea of what I needed to do in terms of altering the sugar to accommodate the taste of my fruit.  For my version I threw in one small apple and a pint of frozen blueberries.   I also used 2/3 of the butter in the recipe.  The end product was extraordinarily rich and I could taste the salt in the topping.  I'd make it again, though, with even less butter and maybe half the salt.  Oh, and definitely serve with whipped cream.

I joined Weight Watches so I needed to take some of the calories out of this.  I also read other reviews which gave me some ideas.  I added some cherries because my plums were yellow not red and small.  I did 1/2 C oats & 1/2 C flour.  I didn't use all the sugar or butter and used 2 eggs.  It was awesome.  My husband loves things sweet so he would have been happier with more sugar.  I would make this again!

I added cinnamon and all spice. It's hard to judge the sugar. Either A. follow the recipe exactly and serve with ice cream or add sugar til the raw plums taste sweet which will probably be more if you have fresh plums from the tree like I did.

Overall good. We had small plums, and after counting out 12, I knew that for sure they weren't going to be enough, so I just sort of winged it. I do wish the recipe called for X-cups or something.

Pitting/chopping was very time consuming, and messy. But otherwise the recipe was very simple and easy. The crust part turned out really good.

Per some other reviewers' suggestions, I added some vanilla and cinnamon to the plums (knowing my audience). Our plums were a bit tart, so I think next time I'll add some extra sugar to them. Will definitely make again.

It was excellent, except 1 tsp. salt is FAR too much. I would only put 1/2 tsp or even 1/4.

I had plums in my fridge that weren't getting eaten fast enough and needed to do something with them. I saw this recipe and made it. I only substituted butter for olive oil per the substition measures and of course added cinnamon and allspice in the fruit and cinnamon on the top. It lasted only a day! My family loved it!!

AmAziNG! I added a bit of cinnamon, more egg, and tried to guesstimate on the sugar since they were fresh slightly tart plums. This is a new favorite of mine! The flavor was great and the topping delicious!

I made mine with purple Pluots, and my husband said it was the best dessert I have ever made for him!  I cut the sugar by 1/3 cup and it was delicious.  Great with ice cream and great with milk for breakfast.

I should not give a review of this recipe as I changed most of the recipe. Thank you for giving me a basis. 
I did not have enough plums and followed some of the other reviewers and left the egg out. I added 3/4 tsp. cinnamon, dash of freshly grated nutmeg, dash of salt and 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice and 1/4 tsp. of almond extract  with the 1/4 cup white sugar and mixed this in with 3 large plums, 2 large peaches and 1 large nectarine. I have a crisp recipe I have used forever-  1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, dash of salt 1/2 tsp baking soda. Mix this well and add 1/4 cup melted butter and sprinkle over top fruit.

It’s delicious if you follow the recipe. Don’t  “ improve” or change and please don’t say it was not great. Just follow  original and review. I’m picky but I loved it. And with butter because I can’t stand artificial products. Butter gives a taste and makes a top crispy.  No photo ,the crisp is gone!

I used this recipe for peach cobbler 

changes:
2tsp nutmeg, 2tsp cinammon, 2 eggs, 2 c flour 2c natural unrefined sugar, 2tsp vanilla 

+ melted butter into batter instead of pouring ovwr mixture (helps to keep it from sticking to pan (no need to prep pan beforehand)


The extra flour was to help with texture. I was able to roll out the dougj into the shape of the pan.

I had about 4lbs of plums and 6 peaches. I cut them all up and made a huge pan, quadrupled the recipe. I added brown sugar and cinnamon. The crumble is awesome, I could have eaten half the bowl raw. I took it to our local hangout and everyone said it was phenomenal.

The tart plum with the sweet crumble makes a delicious combination.  I  took Rotorwife's advice and sprinkled my plums with cinnamon and vanilla. I also added cinnamon to the crumble mixture. A wonderful recipe that the whole family enjoys.

Delicious!!! Excellent recipe for all those extra prune plums at this time of year. At least double the recipe and serve one now and have the other on hand in the freezer. I did add cinnamon to the plums and I also sprinkled the top with almond slices before baking. Quick, easy and delicious!

Quick, easy and very good!  My only change was using 1/4 cup of organic coconut sugar instead of white sugar directly on the fresh plums and a second egg.

This was so easy and delicious! I didn't have enough plums so I added some raspberries.  Also added a sprinkle of cinnamon and a dash of vanilla to the fruit mixture, and sprinkled brown sugar over the topping before baking.  Perfect with a couple scoops of vanilla bean ice cream.

I added some freshly grated orange rind and a little bit of grand marnier and served with ice cream. It was quite sweet and I might cut down on the sugar next time. Delicious!

I made this in the winter with winter plums.  I reduced the sugar and added some pie spice to the plums and a little cinnamon to the topping and it made a delicious christmas plum crisp.  This recipe couldn't be easier and it is really buttery, so it was a real win in my house.

Tastes like candy! Made this on a whim after seeing some fresh plums at a farmer's market.  Family happened to be visiting and we all loved it! Excellent on the first try. The only difference I did was use two eggs instead of one because I read someone else did. And sprinkle brown sugar on top. Delicious.

Wonderful!  I did as someone suggested and added cinnamon, vanilla extract (mixed in with the sugar into the plums) and brown sugar (& added a little bit of extra sugar so it wouldn't be too tart).  Was beautiful and tasted great.  I highly recommend serving it with whipped topping on top of each warm piece.  My husband LOVED it!

I’ve made this plum crisp several times, as my neighbor has an abundance of plums and shares them with me! I didn’t use as much sugar as the  lemon yellow plums are very sweet. The topping is delicious!

I followed the recipe without changing anything. The biscuit topping is too salty for my taste and I could have added a little more sugar to the filling. I will make again sometime and make the adjustments.

Prefer a more traditional crumb topping.  Plums (at least my very juicy ones) need to be combined with some thickening agent.  Ended up with a plum soup covered with crust.

My plums were really ripe. This was just like eating plum soup. The topping was good. I added an extra egg to it because it was extremely dry with one. I probably won't make this again. I guess don't make this recipe if your plums are ripe.

Turned out good! Delicious. I used 36 small (ping-pong to golf ball sized) plums. As others suggested, I sprinkled cinnamon and vanilla on the fruit. The best addition is I added chopped walnuts to the top as the last step. That made the topping nice and crunchy. I couldn’t taste the cinnamon, not sure about the vanilla as I ate with vanilla ice cream. Next time I’ll add cinnamon into the crust/topping. People are calling it batter, but it’s crumbly. Good recipe.

I am not a plum person just saying that up front. This plum recipe was so good I had seconds. Hot and right out of the oven with vanilla ice cream really amazing. Definitely making it again when we get some plums.

I made it with plums, blueberries, and a small apple I had that was not getting eaten.  I added a splash of vanilla to the wet ingredients and some pumpkin pie spice to the dry.   Used half flour, half oats and  mixed the butter in with the dry before spreading it on top.  Then I sprinkled the top with cinnamon and brown sugar as per others' suggestions.  Turned out sweeter than I expected without modifying the sugar.  Had it for dessert and breakfast the next morning!  yum!

I have made this twice now with the Italian Plums from the tree in my backyard in WA state. After reading other reviews, I let my chopped plums sit in a mix of vanilla an cinnamon before using them in the recipe. It came out delicious both times that I have made it now and this recipe will probably become a tradition for my family every autumn when our plums are ripe and ready to pick.

I doubled the recipe.  I used about 16 black plums. They were quite sweet, so I skipped adding sugar to the plums.  I added about a teaspoon of allspice to the flour and sugar and two teaspoons of vanilla to the eggs of my double batch.  I did not double the butter, instead used only the original 1/2 cup.  We all loved it and will gladly make again.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

It’s not bad. It’s true about what another reviewer said, that you need more sugar/sweetener if you’re using particularly tart plums. I added some oatmeal to the topping, which didn’t make it really crispy, but it was still nice. The texture was kind of like a cobbler biscuit topping but a little firmer. If I could give this recipe 3 1/2 stars, I would. I’d make it again, but it wouldn’t be my first choice of recipe.

I made it exactly like the recipe stated.
I used various plums including Italian and some red flesh and white flesh varieties, basically what I had laying around and starting to get near the end of their tastiness.
It was very easy to make and turned out quite good.

This turned out to be sooooo good! I did have to use 2 eggs for my crisp and I added some cinnamon and vanilla as well before putting the crisp on top. This is such a nice balance of tang and sweetness! I love it!

I added a little cinnamon and vanilla to the fruit blend.  I didn't have any plums so I used fresh fruit: peaches (2), nectarines (2),  small apricots (3) and then some frozen berries to equal recipe fruit amount.

I have made this recipe, which is more like a cobbler. That gives it the 3 stars. With tweaks, it is 5. This is not a crisp. I make a classic crisp using flour, brown sugar, butter, salt and a little cinnamon. I also add king arthur pie enhancer to the fruit with some plum jam. It lends to a more substantial texture.

I followed recipe as instructed with no substitutions.  The recipe turned out quite well.  I had to increase the baking time an additional 15 minutes in order for the center of the crisp to be thoroughly cooked.  I didn't want the cooked plums to be too dark so I peeled them.  I used 12 plums since my plums were large.  The crisp was good.  Pairing it with ice cream or whipped cream is definitely a must to offset the tartness of the  crisp.

Very good.  When I first made it, I forgot to sprinkle the fourth cup of sugar over the plums before adding the topping.  It was still delicious with the contrast between tart and sweet.  I copied this recipe to keep.  The recipe didn't say whether or not to peel the plums.  I did--it was easy to pull the skins off with just my fingers.  That may have to do with the variety of plum I used.  The plum tree was here when we moved in, so I don't know what kind of is.

Very tangy dessert, I used small plums and did not take the skin off which made it very sour, but with ice cream it’s great!

It was good. It wouldn't have been better had I followed directions. I mixed the butter in the batter and didn't realize my mistake until it was to late . My bad. But with my own plum tree, I will try it again and do it correctly

I made it with frozen fresh boysenberries.  Doubled the recipe, using common sense to keep to the 1/2 c. melted butter.  Dashed the berries with vanilla.  Baked 45 minutes to brown.  I bake a lot.  Husband eats my baking a lot.  Husband loves.  Will use this recipe with many fruits from here on out.

I had a bunch of plums that would've gone in the trash if I hadn't found this recipe. Made this as written and it was fantastic. It was a huge hit!

I added 1/8 cup lemon juice to the batter, and a dash of cloves.  Also  cut the butter by half and used 1/2 the sugar as brown. Very easy and delicious! Tangy flavor.

Great cobbler recipe- everyone loved it!   The only change I made was to half the butter used, bc we don't like a lot of butter.

Great easy delicious recipe. I used half the amount of sugar in recipe and added half cup frozen blueberries, it was perfect for my taste buds (dont like too sweet treats). I also added two eggs because I felt the batter was too dry. Also added some cinnamon and vanilla extract to the plum/blueberry mixture. It Was delicious and I will definitely make this again with peaches and any other fruits I have in abundance!  (Might add walnuts next time)

I have made it with the plums as listed, as well as with apples and peaches (separately).  Always very delicious, but I find it to be a bit soupy on the bottom.  I am still figuring out how to adjust for this, but regardless, the taste is divine!

This is the first time I've ever made a plum crisp and this recipe is great. I had some peaches to use up as well as a lot of small plums so I just mixed them and followed the recipe and it turned out wonderful. I love this type of topping too. Thanks so much for sharing.

Perfect! I used 1 cup self rising flour for the flour, baking  powder and salt. Otherwise I followed it to the letter. We loved it. My husband thought it was going to be too tart, but it is great. I will make this again.

I'll definitely make this again. The batter looked really strange and I was worried it wouldn't turn out, but it baked perfectly and tastes great! I cut the amount of butter in half (1/4 cup) and it's still very buttery. I might cut the sugar down next time, too. It's really sweet if you start out with sweet plums.

This was my first time eating/making a recipe with plums in it, so I wasn't sure how I'd like it. I loved it! This recipe was very easy to make and was sooo good. It was sweet and tangy and the topping is delicious. I will definitely make it again!

I loved the taste but did change a couple things. I didn't put the 1/4 cup sugar over the plums as the plums I used were sweet enough. As well, I found the 1/2 cup butter to be a bit much; 1/3 butter drizzled over the entire top was enough. It was delicious and it will definitely be a go-to dessert recipe for me. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I made the recipe as directed except I cut down the sugar just a bittle because I only had 8 very ripe plums....it was very good! 12 probably would have been better but the crust turned out crispy and the plums moist and tasty.
