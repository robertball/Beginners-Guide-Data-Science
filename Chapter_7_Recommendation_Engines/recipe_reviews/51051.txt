We used this recipe camping, and it was great after a long hike!  Instead of biscuts, we used sourdough rolls and cut out the centers to make bread bowls.  Yum!

Very good. I made it at home in an iron skillet and placed drop biscuits on top and then finished off in the oven to ensure browning. Will definitely make again!

Tried this recipe twice.  First time I made the mistake of using a shallow skillet that I use to brown all my meat.  I ran into problems when I put on the biscuits.  They pushed the lid up and made them not cook as well.  Second time I used a deep frying pan and the recipe was much better for it.  It allowed the biscuit to cook better.  They came out somewhere between a fully cooked biscuit and a dumpling.  I used a 1/2 cup of BBQ sauce and sprinkled the top with shredded cheddar cheese.  This is a really popular recipe now in my house.  Absolutley wonderful!!!

I made it once and it's now in high demand our annual family camping trip! I cooked it up at home and froze it in freezer baggies so it would keep in the cooler and then just heated it up on the camp site.  I too made the biscuits separately so they wouldn't turn out like dumplings.

My family has been making a recipe almost identical to this one for years.  The only difference is we used a biscuit and baking mix (such as bisquick)for the topping and when the biscuit mixture was browned, we would melt cheddar cheese over the top.  I think I'll give it a try with the canned biscuits.  Either way, it's a 5 star for me!

good, easy, and fast.  As per other reviews, i mixed everything and simmered for a few minutes stovetop, then popped in the oven in a 13x9 pan after topping with biscuits (my biscuit can was actually 15 oz, the "Grands" kind, hence the larger cassorole dish).  Baked about 15 min at 375 then just shut off the oven and let it set for a while...also added s&P, a dash of hot sauce, steak sauce, ketchup and a little br sugar.  nothing special or exciting, but didn't claim to be...this is a great "I worked lated and I'm POOPED" dinner:) excellent!

This was amazing!! I used kc materpiece original bbq sauce and added more than the recipe called for to, which made it more saucy and "gravy like" instead of just ground beef and bean mixture. I baked my biscuits according to package directions so they would get brown and to make sure they were cooked through. My fiance LOVED this dish!! He made sure I saved the recipe and has already asked me to make it next week!! It was super simple!! One thing I also added was salt pepper and garlic powder to my onion and beef mix when it was browning up, just adding a little more flavor but like I said this was amazing and easy, I loved it and will definitely be making again!!

If you use lean hamburger or venison (even leaner), and turkey bacon, it makes this meal much less fatty for those of you that are so worried about it. I cook lean/healthy meals all the time, am very health concious, but if I see something that appeals to me, I adjust the ingredients to make it not so unhealthy.  For those you who leave negative ratings because you havn't tried it, and rag on something because it's not healthy...DON'T EAT IT.  It's that simple.  Anyone knows if you throw a half pound of bacon into a recipe, it's probably bad for you.  DUH.

This recipe is really good. I added more BBQ sauce to make it more flavorful. I also would recomend cooking the biscuits seperately to make them brown. I live in AK. and the biscuits just don't brown in the skillet. If you like a more dumpling like recipe then the skillet would be okay. All in all this is one of the best recipes that we as a family have had. Thanks, for sharing it with us Nickie.

This reciped turned out very well. I made some big changes to suit various dietary preferences (used Morning Star "ground beef" and left the bacon and biscuits out, which I was concerned about doing) but it was very tasty. It reminded me of a sloppy joe with a mesquite twist. It was even better the next day. Cooked as it was without the biscuits, we just ate it plain with a fork, but it would be great on buns. Thanks!

Being a girl I thought this was going to be too much man food for me....I was wrong!  I took a reviewers suggestion and served over sweet cornbread.  I used honey flavored baked beans.  I cooked the bacon in the oven while cooking the ground beef. The taste of the meat mixture was so perfect.  This would be perfect on a cold winter's day too.

Was first introduced to this recipe in a 'freezer meal' book and have never looked back. Its one we keep in family size portion in our freezer. Bake in the oven and then top with either refrigerator biscuits or biscuit mix biscuits. To 'wow' your children, cook in a round casserole dish and cut the tube biscuits in half and arrange like a wagon wheel before browning the biscuits in the oven. Then it truly looks like a 'cowboy casserole'

Very tasty! I too, am health conscious, and yes, this is not a health food by any means. To me, this is one of those once-in-a-while-fun-foods that you eat just because it tastes good. Nobody's saying you should eat like this every night, but a little "good for the soul food" once in a while is a must in my family.

It was really good.  I added bell peppers and celery, so there would be some veggies.  I may add corn with it as well next time.  I put it over corn bread instead of biscuits though.

I have made this meal with a different approach..I put the bean/burger mixture into a casserole dish and top that with the biscuits and a small square of cheese on each buscuit, then bake until the biscuits are lightly brown!

I substituted cornbread for the biscuits.  I poured the batter over the top of the mixture and then popped it into the oven at 350 for 45 minutes.  So good.  My husband LOVED it, and my daughter - who won't eat ANYTHING - loved it too!  If she will eat it, it definitely rates 5 stars from me.

Excellent! I have made almost exactly the same recipe for years except that I use hot dogs cut into small pieces.  I never thought to use hamburger.  Now I have two great "scout camp" type recipes.  Thanks.

I did burn the bottom of mine because I was too focused on the look of the biscuits. I thought they would still look like normal and I cooked it too long waiting for them to get 'done.' They look more like a steamed dumpling, almost raw but they aren't, they are cooked through. We just used the top and middle layer of the casserole and it was great. Follow the directions and don't worry about the biscuits getting done - they will! Great for the 7 year old too!

We love this at my house. I've also made this using leftover sloppy joe meat or leftover taco meat. Another thing we do is add a can of whole kernel corn. It's equally tasty over biscuits/ biscuits baked on top, or just dig in with a fork.

Hearty & delicious! I took other reviewers advice and baked in the oven til the biscuits were brown, about 20 minutes. Topped with grated cheddar and sour cream, it turned out great! I also added some chipotle seasoning for a kick. Can't wait to go camping so we can try this recipe outdoors!

This was actually pretty good.  Almost everyone went back for seconds.  Next time I would use bigger biscuits than what was called for.  I baked my biscuits in the oven in lieu of in the skillet and we added shredded cheddar cheese which I feel was essential.  Also, I cooked my bacon in the oven while the hamburger was browning to save on time.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

we used Bisquick and put in the oven to finish them off.  The meal was good but don't think it was a do-over for us.  The biscuits made it dry.

This was ok as written. My oven broke and I needed a recipe to cook on the stovetop. This put a check in the block, that was about it.  I made it as stated, just added some grated cheese on top.

My husband and I both liked this recipe.  I didn't cook the biscuits with the meal, but made cornbread instead which worked perfectly!  Easy to make.  Reheated the leftovers several nights later and was still tasty.

We couldn't find 7.5 oz. refridgerated biscuits, so,ended up getting 12 oz. biscuits instead.  The meat mixture tasted great,but the biscuits didn't seem to get done as fast. you may want to buy 2 rolls of bicuits if you buy the 12 oz. ones.

I was looking for something different to do with ground beef other than meatloaf and pasta, and this was it. I cooked the bacon in a large frying skillet, adding brown sugar to both sides, then drained of grease on paper towels and diced up into small pieces and set aside. I drained the bacon grease and browned the ground beef in the same pan. I seasoned the beef with garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, paprika, worcestershire, soy sauce, a dash of ranch salad dressing, a dash of Frank's  Red Hot sauce, and a dash of Kickin' Cajun jalapeno hot sauce. I used one can of Ranch Style beans, because that's all I had, and I mixed them up in a small bowl with about 1/2 cup Jack Daniels Hickory Brown Sugar bbq sauce, 1/3 cup ketchup, 2 tbsp honey, 2 tbsp brown sugar, 1 tsp liquid smoke, garlic powder, onion powder and chili powder. I poured the beans over the browned ground beef, covered the skillet and simmered on low for about 30 minutes (mostly because I was waiting for my husband to get home from work). When he got home, I tossed in the brown sugar "candied" bacon because I didn't want it to get soggy. Served over corn bread instead of biscuits. My husband liked it a lot, and so did I. Delicious, simple, and a break from the same old same ground beef! =)

This was great and so quick and easy. A few changes I made according to our taste...since we don't eat baked beans because of the sugar, I used 1 can of pork and beans and 1 can of chili beans.  I also added sliced sweet peppers and crushed garlic cloves with the onion.  Then I placed the biscuits on top and finished in the oven according to biscuit directions.  I think next time I may try adding chopped or sliced jalapenos or green chilies.

I've been making a much more complicated version of this recipe for 15 years and it is always a huge success. My recipe calls for pork sausage instead of ground beef. Very hearty

My husband loved this dish. I added garlic, extra barbecue sauce, about 1/2 cup, and cooked it all in a skillet before transferring to a baking dish and topped it with the biscuits and some cheddar cheese. I baked it at 350 for 15 minutes to get the biscuits nice and brown. Will definitely be making this recipe again!

I won't be making this again.  My husband and I both think it tasted just like hamburger in baked beans like a couple of other reviewers. The biscuits did not get completely done with extra cooking time allowed.

This was super-yummy!  I made it ahead of time and reheated it over the camp stove.  I also took one reviewer's suggestion and served it in sourdough bread bowls which was not only delicious, but less messy too.  Thanks!

This is fantastic! We've pre-made it, froze it and then took it camping; or made it from scratch right at the campsite. I've even made it in the slow cooker by making homemade baked beans and adding the other ingredients along with in in the slow cooker. All versions are well-loved and frequently requested by my family of 6 -- especially by the kids!

My family liked this!  I didn't have the biscuits on hand, but instead served it with rosemary focassia bread and green beans.  I made it mid-afternoon then put it in a slowcooker on "warm" so it would be ready for us at dinner time.  We will do again!

This was big hit with my family, and it's a nice comfort food meal!  I took the advice of others and baked my biscuits separately, and then spooned the beans and meat over top.  I did add in a packet of brown gravy mix and some water to make it more of a gravy.

This recipe was absolutely delicious - hubby & sons loved it!  I did add some garlic & about a tablespoon or so of brown sugar - really put it over the top...I also made the biscuits in the oven so they would brown...you really want to try this.

This is a family favorite at our house!  The only change I made was after putting the biscuits over the top of the beef mixture, I put the skillet in the oven to bake until the biscuits were browned and done.  I also like to sprinkle a little shredded cheddar cheese over top of the biscuits towards the end of the baking time.  Not a fancy meal, by any means, but a quick meal that makes everyone happy!

Very easy and very tasty. My family raved about it. I don't have a dutch oven so I just used a regular pot. Worked out just fine. The biscuits I just cooked in my conventional oven. Easy and simple for me. I will for sure make this one again!

This was fast, easy, and my husband loved it. I used pre cooked bacon,  Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce, 1 can of pork and beans, and onion powder instead of fresh onion. I baked my biscuits in the oven. This made a great meal with pantry staples.

I baked the biscuits separate, but may go ahead and cook them on top next time.  I also added about 4 oz sharp cheddar to the "stew" which thickened it up even more.  ETA:  I tried the biscuits in the skillet and liked it.  However, I had to cook it longer than 10 min.  I had the Grands, so maybe smaller ones would cook quicker.

I just made this tonight, and it's a keeper with my modifications (I tasted it before mods and it was very bland).  First I fried the bacon and added the bacon grease also, I also added brown sugar, ketshup and mustard (to taste on all).  This is not at all healthy but it is wonderful!  I put it in a baking dish topped with refrigerated biscuits and baked it for 20 minutes. I really think the BBQ sauce was wonderful, but you MUST use Sweet Baby Rays, it's the best!  Delious and filling!

Yep, it was an excellent casserole! My kids loved it, didnt change it except for the rolls. We dont have pre-made rolls here, but we do have croissants. Covered the top with that dough in a lasagna dish and it tasted amazing! Kudos for you for this ez recipe, a true kid pleaser!

Surprisingly this was a pretty good recipe that got 5 stars form my family. I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was and it is a frequent request in our house now!

I really wanted to like this recipe. It sounded like a great week night, fix it fast recipe.  However, to my family, it just tasted like beefed up baked beans.  It was good and I would definitely serve it as a side dish at a picnic or potluck, but didn't hit the spot for us for a dinner item.

This was a very good campfire cooking recipe.  For step 1, I used the stove top; then for step 2, I cooked it over a campfire in my dutch oven (using coals).  The only change I made is that I cooked it about 25 min after adding the biscuits.  The biscuits were cooked perfectly (coals under and on top of dutch oven).

It turned out great, except the biscuits were not fully cooked after 15 minutes.  Next time I will bake the biscuits in the oven.

It turned out alright, but the recipe is overly vague about the biscuits, and for some reason it comes up as a baking dish even though it's seemingly prepared entirely on the stove top.

It wasn't a bad dish, but it felt like it could have been a little more savory. Maybe a little more BBQ sauce? Or a sprinkling of red pepper flakes or something?

Just a few changes: one large & one regular can of baked beans, added a can of garbanzos, 12 oz of bacon, 2 small cans of biscuits.

Preheat oven to 375F. Cut bacon before cooking, fry with chopped onions, add ground beef, cook til done. Add beans & a splash of bbq sauce, then pour into big Pyrex bowl, arrange biscuits on top, bake 20-25 minutes, until biscuits are done. (25 minutes was almost too long)

my husband loves it!  nacon--I usedd baked neadext time I will not use Grands biscuits as they didn't cook through for me in 10 minutes (closer to 20 and then some of casserole stuck to the bottom) but instead of using bacon I used Bus's baked beans that has bacon in it. And I cut some mild cheddar into little  pieces and stuck them into each biscuit. this is an easy and satisfying casserole and not heavy.Be sure I will be making this again.

Ok but I'm not crazy about bbq flavors. I don't eat pork, so I used vegetarian beans instead. Very filling and quick to make. I'm glad I tried this recipe.

This is very close to an old family favorite that came out of a newspaper during the depresssion.
Make it a casserole by layering the bean/meat mixture, then a layer of sliced fresh apple, a sprinkle of brwn sugar, repeat twice more.
biscuits on top. 
The title was "Meal in One" I grew up on this and mom use to add Kings syrup to sweeten it. Quite a treat.

This recipe was very easy to do and simple to make. However, the one thing that didn't do it for us, was putting the biscuits on top of the dish and cooking the raw dough covered on the stovetop. Just didn't do right and the underside was really wet and doughy. So I took them off and tossed them. Baked another batch of biscuits in the oven and then placed the cooked biscuits on a plate and poured the mixture over like the recipe stated. And it was better.

Delicious, hearty meal! My husband loves it. I like to experiment and switch out the baked beans for Bush's Grillin Beans. There are many differently flavors and they all taste delicious!

This was very good! I did follow some of the other reviews though. I added salt, pepper,  garlic, basil, oregano, and chili powder to the ground beef. I also used 2/3 cup of bbq sauce for extra flavor. I served it over corn bread that I made separately. My kids didn't like it but they aren't a fan of beans or corn bread. My husband and I thought it was yummy! It would also be good served over mashed potatoes or rice. I may try that in the future to see if the kids will like it better.

This was good. If you like baked beans and bbq sauce, then you can't go wrong. I made the biscuits in the oven, split them and then poured the mixture over them. (I'm not a dumpling, gooey biscuit person!)

Delicious!! I used other's suggestions and used 1 lb of bacon, 1.3 lbs ground chuck, doubled the Sweet Baby Rays BBQ Sauce, omitted the biscuits and served over sweet cornbread and finally topped with shredded cheddar.  I did use a medium onion and seasoned the beef with black pepper, salt and garlic powder for added flavor.  GREAT recipe- we'll definitely make again!

Excellent recipe. I did have to cook it a lot longer than stated to get the biscuits cooked all the way through (did it on the stove top, like in the recipe).  I used canned maple beans and it was a bit too sweet, so next time, I will try BBQ beans.

DELISH! I make this all the time. At least once a week! I prefer to use flavored baked beans, i.e. Smokehouse Tradition or Bourbon & Brown Sugar, to name a few. I tend to leave the biscuits on a little longer so they become more like biscuits instead of dumplings. Great either way!

Tried this with half chili beans and half baked beans. Way to sweet. Had to add spices to take some of the sweet out. Next time I'll just use chili beans.

I did not use an onion since I did not have any, but I baked up some cornbread mix I had. 
I made the bacon, then made some chili w/o beans (I dont like beans) and then put a bunch of cheese over it. 
I mixed it all together, and put it on a plate next to my cornbread and took bites of each and it was great!!

I was looking for a quick and easy recipe for camping and this was a hit. I made it at home then reheated over the fire in an aluminum pan (no cleanup!) and baked my biscuits separately. Once warm I served over biscuits we toasted over the fire. Fabulous! We had a side of sweet corn grilled in the husk and it was a perfect cowboy dinner. I may even make this at home on occasion.

This should have been called Circus Cowboy Casserole. It's definitely a kid's recipe. Camping fare through and through, it couldn't get any worse if it fell into the fire. I'd rather skip this and curl up in my sleeping bag with a belly full of smore's.

I added some minced garlic, jalpeno, and smoked paprika. I also baked the biscuits ahead of time. Was a real hit with the family. I have made up a double batch for the freezer in individual servings. They seem to have disappeared.

Completely satisfied with this dish. It tastes the way I imagine cowboy grub would taste. I reduced the amount of BBQ sauce a bit because I felt the Pork n Beans plus the bacon would add enough taste(and salt).

Made this last night for dinner, turned out great very fast and easy.  Did my bisuits separately in the oven, served it over the biscuits.  Total hit, even invited my parents and they loved it too.  Will add to our dinner menu.

I made this dish last night for my 11 year old son. It was very simple,  great for large groups of people, I corrected some of the flavor with the "better than bouillion", ccok the bisquits separate in the oven...BUT... the combination  of flavors between the cooked meat and the bisquit was trully amazing, for me the whole thing about this plate is the flavors combine of those two.

This was a great recipe.  My son and I loved it!!  Per some recommendations and a craving, we did make cornbread instead of biskets.  Also, I left out the onion because I don't care for them.  We did add brown sugar, mustard, and hot sauce along with the BBQ sauce to help add more of a sweet kick and thickness.  Thank you for sharing we will be having this again!!!

This was a very good casserole. It was very taste. The barbecue sauce gave it a kind of sweet taste and made it all that much better. We added a little brown sugar and that mad a little sweeter.

Made this last night... it was very good.  I used Bushes Grilling Beans, I think Bourbon and Brown Sugar... wow.. very yummy.  I made up some Bisquick bisquits and baked them while this was simmering on the stove.  Hubby said it was a keeper.

My family LOVED this! It's so easy to make...it will definitely be an easy recipe while camping. I used ground turkey instead of beef, and took the bacon down to 6 slices. This took each serving (8 total) to 410 cals. and 15 g. fat.

This was very good and incredibly filling. The biscuits soak up a lot of liquid so I think that if I made this again I would add more liquid so that the leftovers wouldn't be so dry. The only change I made was to tear the biscuits into smaller pieces and to finish it in the oven.

This is definitely delicious and a keeper.  My man LOVES this recipe and asks for it by name often.  I use only one can of beans, for us, two was too many!  I used one can of  brown sugar baked beans, and brown sugar and maple BBQ and it was GREAT!  Also I prefer to cook biscuits or cornbread seperate from the dish and just spoon the casserole over it.  It's so easy and so good.

I actually have not even made this recipe yet, but it is the same ingredients that was in a casserole my mom used to make when I was little!  She unfortunately had lost the recipe and when I saw this I knew it was it.  I cannot wait to try it!

I made this on a camping trip last weekend.  Everyone in our group of 10 LOVED it!  They all (even the sister & mother- in-law)  ranted and raved about it!  We made it in our cast iron dutch oven in the fire.  Great Flavor.  I subbed Cheddar black pepper rolls that we made into bread bowls instead of the biscuits.  Very handy & Fast!  I doubled the batch  and used honey bacon.  Next time I will use a thicker saltier bacon & spicier BBQ sauce to enhance the flavor.  Definate keeper!

Fabulous recipe.  Extremely unhealthy, but balance it out with a healthy meal the next day and you will be okay!  It was awesome.  I baked the biscuits separately as suggested and only used one can of pork beans because that is all I had and it turned out great!

This was awesome!  I don't have a dutch oven so I followed the recommendation of another reviewer and transferred the bean mixture to a 9"x13" dish, put the biscuits on top, baked at 375C for 10 mins, turned the oven off and left it in there for another ten minutes.  So easy!!  Definitely pasting this one into the recipe book!!

I thought this was yummy and a great addition to my ground beef repertoire.  I added some extra seasoning/bbq sauce to perk up the baked beans and substituted turkey bacon and homemade cheddar biscuits for the canned.  I am excited to take this recipe camping when summer rolls around.

This recipe was delicious! My family makes a casserole similar to this (actually we call is "bean garbage" haha) that started from when were camping and threw everything we had left into a pot. Adding sausage and hot dogs to the mix is excellent!

this recipe is easy and quite tasty.  I put everything into an 8x8 baking dish and instead of using biscuits I poured prepared corn bread mix over the top and baked according to the directions on the corn bread package(400 degrees for 20 min.) Tastes somewhat like a chili but i love the sweetness of the bbq sauce.

Oh, man! I used Hunt's Original Baked Beans, a generic BBQ sauce, and Grands bisquits in a cast iron skillet. All I can say is YUMMY! Even had it with eggs the following morning. Soooo good. Thanx Nickie.             ...ELFHELP...
     oops! Mindburp. It was Bush's Original BBQ beans. The best!

Wow this recipe brings back memories. I don't really eat this kind of food anymore, but it reminded me of when I was a kid and we went to the rodeo cook offs when the trail riders came in.  They would make foods like this for everyone to try. I had mixed reviews from my guys that I cook for.  I think its because we don't eat foods like this.  One loved it and the other not too much but loved the biscuits from the top. I took one reviewers suggestion and made the meat part on the stove and transferred it to a 9X13 dish, put grands biscuits on top, using cooking directions on buscuit can. It came out great. Thanks for the memories.

This is quite similar to a recipe I got from my Mom's cookbooks....Western Style Beef and Beans.It's basically just double this recipe only without the barbecue sauce.The sauce in this was a nice touch.Instead of using refrigerator biscuit dough I made my own biscuits by hand.For such a simple recipe I was quite surprised on how well it turned out to be.I'll be making this again.

Very tasty and easy to make. I did bake the biscuits separately in the oven and then spooned the meat/bean casserole over them at the table. My DH, two teenage boys, and 2 yr. old dtr. all enjoyed it.

On a wet, blustery evening like this one, this dish really hit the spot, even without biscuits which we forgot.  It is everything we wanted in a "quick-after-soccer-practice" meal.  It'll be a regular week night meal for us.

This was very good. I added a little more bacon and I baked the biscuits separately. The leftovers were great in a flour tortilla.

We loved this! My husband couldn't eat enough. The only thing I did differently was microwave the bacon (its faster). Otherwise I wouldn't change a thing and it couldn't be easier!! NOTE: to change up the flavor a little bit, try using different varieties of beans. Example- I used one can or extra maple and one can of spicy. It added another flavor to the mix!

I too would recommend baking after adding the biscuits, so that they brown, or baking them separately. This is a variation on "Old Settler's Beans", which has been a favorite dish at our table and at family reunions and such for at least 3 generations.

Biscuits too gummy on bottom. Had to remove them & flip over to bake a little longer. But still very yummy! Will try cornbread next time.

I made this in a Crock pot! (took four hours.) Only cooked the bacon till crispy then added to pot. Also, made this without the rolls and only added a couple tablespoons of BBQ sauce. (cutting  down on bread/sugar)  and it was wonderful! EASY!!!! Tasted better than I thought it would! I made the menfolk rice and they went crazy for it.

When I made this, In a cast iron skillet, I added 1T mustard and sautéed (with the bacon) unions. Then topped the mixture with cornbread and baked it in the oven.

To cut down on fat and calories, I omitted the bacon, used beans w/out pork and drained the bean sauce in the can. I also used ground turkey and cooked and drained the meat before adding the onion.  Served over cornbread. Even with these changes, still had a ton of flavor.

Made this for supper tonight for the hubbs and myself. Wow! Lots of food and very tasty! Made the Beef and Beans portion pretty much as per directions. The only difference was that I used the precooked bacon because it was all that I had on hand. I also made homemade biscuits because I didn't have the tube variety and cooked them in the oven while preparing the Beef and Bean portion. I split the biscuits and spooned the Beef and Beans over the top. YUM!!  We'll be having leftovers for a day, maybe two!!

The only thing I changed was to brown the biscuits slightly under the broiler just to add a little color. My cowboy husband and I really enjoyed it. It's hearty and is definitely a cold weather dish.

This was excellent.  I made it twice but didn't have the biscuits.  The first time, I ate it "plain," and it was good, but the second time, I added a pound of elbow macaroni, and it was much better.

I loved this because it was easy and I actually had all the ingredients on hand.  I followed the recipe as is, except I didn't use biscuits and used extra beans; I had one extra small can on hand that I threw in.  My husband made corn bread waffles.  Man was that a good combination!

I didn't deviate to much from the recipe other than to add a 1/2 cup of BBQ sauce and 3 tbl of Chinese garlic chile paste for a little kick. Easy, quick and delicious. I'll be making this again!

My husband I enjoyed this recipe. I only used one can of beans, I used pre cooked bacon bits because I do not like cooking bacon, and I add cut up cooked potatoes. I added this recipe to my favorites.

I followed the recipe except for using biscuits.  Instead, I served over rice because that's what I had on hand.  Delicious!  I will make again using rice.

This was not to bad considering I really am not a big bean eater. The boys in my house said it was pretty good and having it once in awhile would be okay.
I do believe those who love baked beans will enjoy this.

We loved it. It would be great camping meal. I would add more bacon (I'll use a full pound next time). Flattened the biscuits before I added them.  I found that a low simmer took too long to cook the biscuits. I had to turn the heat up after 10 minutes to a low boil (for about 7 minutes). Note that they will NOT turn brown but they did cook  completely.  Might top it with some shredded cheese (?) next time. You could definitely put your own spin on tweaking it to your taste.

Easy and so delicious.  My husband dug in before I could take the photo.  I added peppers, corn and put the biscuit on top and baked it in the oven.

A new family favorite!  Didn't have baked beans, so I substituted canned black beans and a used little more BBQ sauce. Since I generally use a cast iron skillet, next time I'll cook a little less on the stove top, then top the pan with the biscuits, and pop the skillet in the oven until the biscuits are done.  Pre baked rolls could also be another option.

I've made this recipe twice now. The first time I made it just as it reads and it was very good. The second time I made it I changed some things to our liking. I made the biscuits in the oven. I did not use onion and I cooked the hamburger and bacon together. The recipe is delicious either way! If you use sweet baby rays bbq sauce it's just the right amount of sweetness to it! Very good and will make a again!

Very yummy hardy dish. I did as others suggested and cooked in my deep iron skillet. I also opted to top with cornbread and finish in the oven. Everyone loved it.

My husband loves the canned beans with hot dogs, so I used this recipe as a basis for a more homemade meal-worthy version.  I used cut up turkey dogs in place of the ground beef, browning in a skillet with the onions.  After the dogs had a nice crisp on the edges, I added the beans and BBQ sauce, then I actually baked it with the biscuits on top.  He loved the finished product, and informed me I was going to be making more of it for dish-to-pass events at his workplace.  I guess that's a vote of confidence if he wants to share it!

This was VERY GOOD! Couple changes - I used Morningstar crumbles (we dont eat meat) and used a can of black beans and a can of kidney beans instead of pork and beans (to avoid it being too sweet...and to make it meatless). Just a note - to get the biscuits to cook through, you need to REALLY simmer this....I had it on low heat with a low simmer and it didnt cook through until I turned it up and did a decent simmer.

I made this tonight and this was a sure winner with my Husband! This is budget friendly and easy to prepare on a weeknight. I prepared this exactly as is, but I did pop my Dutch oven in the oven for about 7 minutes to brown the biscuits. My Husband has requested that I make this for him the next time he goes fishing! Sure winner!

This was a quick and easy lunch for me and the kids today. I used Johnsonville® Italian Ground Sausage in place of the ground beef. It was just a tad salty for me, so I added a splash of vinegar to help offset that. Otherwise, a very flavorful, filling lunch.

Very good.  My son loved it.  I took the advice of others and added more barbeque sauce and it came out very well.  I also used turkey bacon to make it a little more healthier.  I will probably use turkey ground meat next time as well and see how that works.

It took longer than 10 minutes to cook the biscuits and the rest of the casserole burned on the bottom and it didn't taste to great even without the burnt bottom.

We've made this several times now and it is definitely a fan favorite.  When I get it all mixed up, I transfer to a casserole dish and put the biscuits on top, then stick it in the over for 10-15 min.  Don't know how I'd feel about a "dumpling" type topping.  I'm gonna have to try it with the baking mix biscuits tho, cos that actually sounds pretty good with cheese on top.

This is a recipe I've been looking for for ages. Used to make it all the time when camping but it got lost as the years went on. Wonderful to see it again. I think it makes a quick lunch and is something everyone can enjoy when the kids drop in unexpectedly. I like this best pit in a casserole with biscuits on top and baked at 350 for about 20-30 minutes. Biscuits are browned and crispy. I sprinkle a handful of shredded cheese over the biscuits usually. MMMMMM

I also have made this recipe for years!  I add green pepper in addition to the onion.  I also add a little Dijon mustard, catsup and horseradish to the barbeque sauce and mix in with beans/ground beef.  I haven't used bacon in the past, but will try that the next time I make this!

Very quick and easy. Just what I was looking for as a hearty meal for my husband. He loved it and even took the leftovers for lunch!!! Next time I might try baking the biscuits while cooking the beans just to save even more time.

Hearty meal.   I baked the biscuits on top of the casserole, which cooked the tops to a nice golden brown, but left the bottoms doughy.  Next time I'll cook the biscuits seperately and pour the casserole over the top to serve.

This recipe was super easy and very good! I saw from other reviews that the biscuits were more dumpling like when cooked on top so I cooked them separate in the oven.

This was GREAT! I cooked the biscuits separately and added a touch of cayenne and a small jar of green chilies to the meat mixture to give it a slight kick. I also used 1/2 sweet bbq sauce and 1/2 mustard bbq sauce - delish! My husband LOVED it! Will definitely do this one again!

This one's a keeper!  I make this for my hubby who's a massage therapist and comes home SUPER hungry!  It has all the ingredients he likes, especially the BBQ sauce. I play around with it and sometimes substitute chopped weenies instead of the beef.  Very filling,easy and delicious!

Really really good.  I didn't know what to expect but it was just right...not too much bbq flavor.  I should have baked it in a cake pan in the oven to begin with since I had trouble getting the bisquits to brown on top of the stove.  I put it in over for about 15 minutes and got them to brown on top.  I loved it and very picky husband liked it too.

this was great!  reminded me of a chili/sloppy joe mix.  we made the biscuits in the oven, then put the meat mixture on top.  besides the onion, we added a chopped green pepper and chopped jalapeno.  

i also made a vegetarian batch cutting the recipe in half.  i used a half pack of soy hot dogs, chopped and fried in a little butter to replace the ground beef.  added the same veggies, but instead of bacon, sprinkled a little bacos (soy product) in a few minutes before serving.  they softened up and gave it the bacon flavor without adding any meat.  he's 18 and loved it!! 

this is a great recipe, thanks!!

Instead of my husband saying " it's alright" he actually said "this is good, I like it".. I used 1/2 cup of Jack Daniels spicy barbecue sauce and slipped some sliced cheese squares between the layers of the biscuits it was awesome.  Will cook again for sure!!

Turned out okay...just didn't have that "cowboy kick" I was looking for. Kind of on the bland side, maybe some jalapenos next time may give it a boost. Way too many beans and not enough bacon for my taste. Oh. I'll make it again. But I will make some adjustments to it, like adding spices to the hamburger and more barbecue sauce. I like to make and rate an item just as it is written. That's only fair to the recipe's author/inventor.

I'm pleased how well DH and 4 year old triplets liked this.  After it was all put together, I wasn't so sure.  The biscuits weren't cooked after a 10 min simmer, so I baked for ~9 min at 350.  Looked much prettier, too.  Definitely make again.

Excellent!   I did have trouble with the mixture burning to the bottom of the pan at the very end while the bicuits were cooking (so I couldn't stir).  Maybe need to adjust temp more towards very end next time.  Even with a burnt bottom this dish was a big hit for my family - thanks for sharing it!

What a hit! It was so easy and quick! I used pre-cooked turkey bacon, ground turkey, added some texmex chipotle seasoning to the meat, used Bush's bacon maple brown sugar baked beans and baked the biscuits separately as i was worried they would end up soggy . . . worked great! Served the biscuits on the bottom and then topped with the bean mixture and cheese! YUM! One of my boyfriend's new favorites and mine too! Might try cornbread or mixing corn in with the bean mixture next time though and double the bbq sauce!

I can't remember when I've had worse results with a recipe from this site. Biscuit dough requires much more time and liquid to be successful. The recipe needs at least 1 full cup of broth, tomato sauce, or other liquid. I didn't have any biscuits (I don't use them), so I made a batch of dumpling dough with Bisquick.  Directions for dumplings require 10 mins. uncovered, then 10 mins. covered. The result was ghastly! I'm going to eliminate this site from my listing. I have had very few successful results from it.

I made this recipe last night. It was easy and pretty tasty. We don't usually eat ground beef and regular bacon. Next time I will make this recipe with turkey bacon, ground turkey, and whole wheat biscuits to cut down on the fat and calories.  I also did add a bit of brown sugar to mine. Instead of pork and beans, I will use some vegetarian baked beans.  But overall easy and quick to make!!

So good! This is a perfect easy meal for wintertime. This recipe reminds me a lot of barbeque cups I make with canned biscuits - happy I decided to try something new! I only made a few minor adjustments.. seasoned the beef with onion & garlic powders, didn't use bacon because I didn't have any (still good!), and added shredded cheese to the top after the ten minutes and replaced the lid to let it melt. And unlike some of the others, I didn't have any problems letting the biscuits cook on the stovetop. Mine cooked perfectly - not gooey at all! Awesome comfort food!

I tried making this in a campfire dutch oven, and it just didn't come together for us.  Obviously, the type of BBQ sauce you use is going to influence flavor a lot, but I don't think I'll try it again.

I kinda combined this recipe with "Pam's BBQ Flat Jacks". The results "outstanding". Basically I just added the 1/2 teaspoon of hot pepper & and the 1 cup of shredded cheese as was called for n said recipe. Finished it as was directed n that recipe, in the oven.

Good, I found it a bit bland so I added 2 tablespoons of warchester and a bit of chilli powder to give it some spice. My 4 year old gobbled it up. We had it on buns like sloppy joes

My husband loves this recipe. I leave out the kidney beans and I put the cheese on top of mixture then add bisquits. Taste great.

Was OK, husband said "it's good, don't add it to the rotation though".  I thought it took forever for the biscuits to cook, at least double the time stated, and they were still doughy.  If I ever make again I will just bake the biscuits.

Loved it! Added jalapeno and cayenne pepper to make it kick, but it really would have been delicous without it. ALSO, I used two cans of 7 oz biscuits because the one can didn't cover the whole skillet. I forgot they expand, duh. So just use the one can . I ended up having to scrap the biscuit off and cook it in the oven because of this. Won't make that mistake again! Thanks for the camping tip too, it is a perfect camping recipe.

A good basic recipe... my kids found it a bit too sweet (might've been the bbq sauce). My only complaint is how dry and thick it got. I will definitely try it again with different sauce.

This is a keeper in our lineup!  We had very little leftovers, which we took care of the next day.  The day after that my son wanted me to make it again!  I did, however, bake the biscuits seperately the second time, and we liked it better that way.

This was really good and really easy.  Salt and pepper the hamburger as it is cooking is a must.  I only used one can of beans and that was enough.  I also did not have biscuts so I served over bread. Very good thanks for a quick easy and tasty

I think this has potential to be a 5 star meal with a couple of small changes.  Next time I am going to make my own biscuits instead of using refrigerated ones.  I also might add more beans and a little bit of water to help it not be quite so thick.  Overall, it was delicious though.

Tried this out for dinner last night.  It was good but I don't think it really qualifies as a main dish.  This recipe is more like kicked up baked beans.  Might make this as a side dish next time I grill out.  I will also leave out the bacon.  If I wasn't the one that added it to the pan I would have never known it was even in there.  I will skip the added fat & calories next time by just leaving it out.  Didn't change too much other than add worchester sauce, green/red peppers and topped off with some grated cheddar.  It was ok but main dish worthy in my opinion.

This is definitely a camping meal, it's good, but heavy. If I make it at home again, I'll bake the biscuits separately in the oven. Using the dutch oven on top of the stove took longer and in the process caused the bottom of the beef mixture to scorch. But it tasted good, everybody ate it and it was easy. I'll keep it for a quick winter meal, or for when we go camping.

I made this and it was delicious. Thank you. One question here in Australia we do not serve Biscuits with meat meals.But we have biscuits with coffee and tea.. I guess that is what you call Cookies. Can anyone send me a recipe for these "Biscuits" in this recipe please? Thanks so much,  SamanthaAust

I always hate rating lower than 4 stars but this recipe was just not that good at home. I am sure it is awesome around the campfire. It is really bland and somehow did not really rise above sloppy joe. Decent and probably really popular with kids.

Diced up the bacon before frying to make perfect little pieces. Followed the rest of the recipe exactly using "Sweet Baby Ray's" BBQ sauce---the only sauce ANYONE should use. Except I did pour the mixture into a casserole and topped with the biscuits baking according to packaged directions. True cowboy dinner...will def. use this one again!

Easy and tasty! I used pinto beans instead of baked beans b/c that's what I had on hand. I added 1 can diced tomatoes and more bbq sauce for flavor. I baked the biscuits separately and poured the mix over them to serve.

We thought this dish was pretty bland.  I cooked the biscuits separately, but followed the recipe exactly apart from that.  In the end, it tasted like hamburger mixed with beans...probably won't make again.

It was just ok to me.  I definately could not serve the biscuits for leftovers because they were too soggy.  It would be better with some green pepper and corn added to it and less bbq sauce.  My husband liked it and said he would eat the leftovers for lunch but never did, so I think he wasn't too crazy about it either.  Bummer..

What a great recipe! If there was a 4.5, I would give it that rating. As other reviewers suggested, I baked the biscuits seperately, and then piled the casserole on top of two to three biscuits. I'll definitely be making this one again!

I'm not BIG on Barbecue Sauce but I am always trying to find new recipes for ground beef, but this recipe was quite tasty!  Different...but GOOD!  My husband, our roommate, and a good friend helped themselves to seconds. I will make this for our next potluck!

A very quick and easy recipe for when you don't have much time in the kitchen. I added a little more bbq sauce because I love the stuff, plus a little Mister Mustard hot yellow mustard for a touch of heat. I also followed others' advice to cook the biscuits before spooning the meat on top. Great tip - they weren't soggy at all. If I were to make this again, I would probably just use regular baked beans. Thanks for posting, Nickie!

I am impartial to pork and beans, however, my husband wants me to make him beans more often.  When I saw this recipe, I decided I had my chance.  I couldn't believe how much he liked it.  You'd have thought I'd made a gourmet meal.  Quite simple, and I threw it all in the slow cooker to cook all day.  I ended up adding about an extra 1/4 c of BBQ sauce, because it wasn't saucy enough.  My husband has already added this to his list of top dishes.  Well done.

Good, Easy dinner to make. Not to fancy but very Yummy.
