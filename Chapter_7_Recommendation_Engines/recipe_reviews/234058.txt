Love this recipe! So easy to make. And you can change it up a little by adding chopped nuts. Delicious!

You can NOT have these cookie bars without the caramel drizzle. It's a must as I was told by everyone. Really easy recipe. Everyone enjoyed these. My one child that can't have apples liked the fact I left some bars apple free but sprinkled the spices on top and then drizzled the caramel on it. And the recipe is correct, when they disappeared, kids were like "where'd the go?!" because they wanted more. Super recipe.
