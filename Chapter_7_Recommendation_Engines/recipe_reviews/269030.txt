It was decent.  It lacked quite a lot of flavor and seemed a little watery to us.  I would try again and make some changes.

I coated all of the vegetables with Lipton Dry Onion Soup Mix and a bit of olive oil. This is by far the best roast I have ever eaten. Don't tell me Mom!

Great flavors in this recipe. I would use this recipe again, but slightly increase the cooking time for both the roast and the carrots to soften them a bit more.

Excellent as written! I had never used the meat/stew function that I am aware of and it worked like a champ!
