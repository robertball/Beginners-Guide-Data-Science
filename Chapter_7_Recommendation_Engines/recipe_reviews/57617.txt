This is one of my favorite breads from this site! Very tasty! It makes excellent croutons, also. Have made many, many times. Posted pic---didn't use bread machine, made by hand.

I made this bread yesterday and it turned out very well.  I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of baking the bread in my oven.  I went ahead and let it bake in the bread machine and it turned out great.  

I'm unsure what the last reviewer meant because the amount of yeast is listed clearly in the recipe.

When Maggie McGuire said "this recipe turns out a perfectly textured flavorful bread every time" she wasn't lying. This bread was great surved warm and tasted good the day after too.

I made this entirely in my bread machine and was very disappointed. It didn't rise very high at all, the crust was too crunchy and the bread was too chewy. It hurt our jaws to eat it. On the positive side, it was much better the next day after being toasted. It seems that most of the previous reviewers finished their's off in the oven which is what I will try next time. Also, I substituted dill seed for the dill weed which I loved.

This bread came out just right after using my bread machine on the dough cycle and then making into two small loaves and baking in the oven.  The flavor wasn't what I was hoping for though.  I remember always getting a wonderful loaf of dilly bread when I was younger and this wasn't even close.  The flavor is pretty faint even with all of the cheese and such. I bake a lot of breads and this one's flavor just wasn't up to par.  This is a nice loaf to eat with soup but I don't think I'll make it again.

GREAT bread. I followed the recipe exactly, using a combination of Assiago and Parm cheese along w/ the cheddar. I took the dough out after the second rise as maggie suggested and baked in the oven. My loaf only took 30 minutes instead of 35-40 - so glad I checked it! The crust is chewy/crunchy brown and the inside is dense and perfect. The dill and cheese flavors are very subtle - just a great, hearty bread.

I used this a base recipe and changed a few things. I used 3 cups whole wheat flour instead of the 2 different flours. I doubled the dill and added 2 tablespoons of sun-dried tomatoes. It was so yummmy!!!

I made this bread with my Kitchen Aid. I proofed the yeast in the mixer bowl with the warm water, milk and sugar for ten minutes, then added in all the dry. (I did cut back on the dill. A whole tbsp. seemed a bit excessive to me.) When it came together, I kneaded it with my dough hook for five minutes. This rose nicely, baked up beautifully. Flavor-wise, I just didn't care for it and neither did my family. The texture was really crumbly. I'd like to try this again and see if maybe I missed a step or just fubared it up. Reading the other reviews NOW, I see that I'm not alone. I'm really bummed.

Pretty good. Although I could hardly taste the dill, it was pleasantly cheesy. A little bit on the dense side, but good nonetheless. Thanks!

The bread was just okay for us.  I did not think there was a lot of flavor considering all that was in it.  Not sure if I would make again.  It did look really nice.  Thanks

I'm not a bread maching girl, so I made this the good ole fashioned way. It was alright, but nothing special. The flavor was OK, and the texture was good, but it just didn't have the Wow factor. Sorry :(

I don't have bread machine, proofed yeast, warmed milk, mixed all together, kneaded, let rise 1 hour, put in  pan rise 1 hour, bake 30  minutes at 350.  I make it with Asiago cheese and some parmesan.  We love Asiago cheese. Family requests it.
