This stuff is GREAT!  My children loved it...even cold leftovers from the fridge were a hit with them.  I used turkey smoked breakfast sausage and it was incredible...any kind of apples tasted good too.  This is SO EASY and man what a flavor...the sweet of the apples with the salt of the meat...wow!!!  It was really good.  It really is a wonderful breakfast or brunch dish.

Delicious and very easy to make.  I used regular flour and smoked sausage and it is still very good.  Great dish for Sunday mornings!

I really enjoyed this recipes, although I changed it significantly, according to what I had in the house. First I sprinkled cinnamon over the apples and sausage. I didn't have enough brown sugar so I topped it off with white and a spoonful of molasses. And I used regular milk. I had to cook it longer than suggested - closer to 40m. But my boyfriend and I loved it.

We LOVED this!!  It will be a regular "after church on Sunday" lunch - it is quick and filling with a healthy kick.  Do yourself a favor and melt some butter in your baking dish as your oven is preheating... then add your apples and sausage while still hot.  Other than that, I think this is the first recipe I haven't been able to imagine addor subtracting ANYTHING!!!

This recipe was really hard to swallow...literally.  It was dificult to get past the mixture of ingredients, but tasted good.  I think the combination made it hard to not think about what you were eating and enjoy it.

The batter for this recipe has a very good flavor, my kids loved it, and I loved the ease of the recipe and that it is a one dish meal. The downfall would be that the three main items-apple, sausage, and batter don't really blend well.  They don't add flavor to each other and actually the flavor of the apples and sausage seem to get lost. I didn't have buttermilk, but used the substitution, and I sprinkled cinnamon/sugar on top of the batter.  It smelled heavenly.

This one was not a big hit with the family.  I kinda liked it.  I think it may have been too much off of our regular menu.  I had too many leftovers.

It was a little too sweet for my tastes, although the kids liked it.  I won't be making it again.

What a great and simple recipe! I substituted 5 vegetarian Boca smoked sausages for the real sausage and it turned out just great! I did have to bake mine for a little longer than 25 minutes to get it done in the middle.

We loved this!  I doubled it and made it in a 9X13 pan.  It has to cook a bit longer but it was worth it.  My husband took the whole thing to work and only a little came back, which I was glad because  I enjoyed heating it up the next day and so did my 2 year old!  It is heavy and sweet.. which I liked.

Interesting recipe.  I made this for a brunch buffet and had
alot leftover.  This is good but very heavy.  A little goes a long way.

I love this recipe!!! I make it every year when we come home from apple picking. The only thing I do different is I layer the apples and batter. The first time I made it I didn't like how the bread was so thick on top. This does create a longer cook time though.

This was delicious. Next time I would add a little cinnamon and more apples. I would make this in lieu of pancakes for a real snappy breakfast. Great recipe.

My family LOVED this. I made it exactly as written. The only problem I had was with the apples and the cooking time. The apples were making this so wet on the bottom that it took nearly an hour to cook. I will make it again but I will probably dice the apples and stir them in to distribute the juices more evenly, or perhaps sautee them.

This was a great recipe for a change in breakfast! I used frozen turkey sausage links (found in the frozen/breakfast case)chopped and gala apples.  I think next time I'll use granny smith apples and try adding cinnamon and the Boca sausage like the other reviews mentioned. All in all it was very good! p.s. my toddler even liked it!

Easy and good! I used uncooked turkey sausages and cooked them first. The recipe didn't say. Scrambled some eggs to go with it. We love having breakfast for dinner. The kids gobbled it up. My husband even took the left overs for lunch today!

This was good...but if I was going to make it again I'd add more "stuff" - definitely more apples & sausage, maybe some cut up potatoes or pieces of onion.  I really liked it for breakfast more than I liked it for dinner.

This recipe was great and easy.  The only thing I changed was I used regular milk instead of buttermilk.  My 3 and 5 year olds refused to eat it, but I loved it and so did my husband.  This also is one of those things you could make ahead and heat up on a busy morning.

I rally liked this. The batter tasted a bit odd, but the finished product is very good and different. I used a spicy Cajun chicken sausage as I like the contrast of apples with some heat

The recipe was very tasty but the directions are not enough for a novice cook (of which I am not).
What size is a "medium" baking dish? I used a 9" round deep dish baking dish that worked well. And what are smoked turkey sausage links? We don't seem to have them in our part of the world, so I didn't know if they were cooked or not. I par-cooked some Johnsonville maple syrup flavored breakfast sausage links and chopped them up, that was very tasty.
But all in all a fun change from the usual.

Good taste.  A little dry.
