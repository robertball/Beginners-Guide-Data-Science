This turned out really great! I needed a recipe that did not include sugar or orange juice and this was perfect. No need for salt. Mine turned out a little extra runny so next time I will probably opt for a 1/4 cup rather than a 1/3 cup of water.

Sauce was very thin. Had to add cornstarch.

Delicious! The sauce thickened as it cooled. I served it over German Puff pancakes. It was a big hit.

I had a bunch of blueberries that I needed to use, and I wanted a sauce to serve over grilled peaches with vanilla ice cream.  I used 2 cups of blueberries, 1 tbsp. honey, about 2 tbsp. lemon juice and 3 tbsp.  I skipped the salt.  While cooking it, I thought it needed a little more sweet, so I added about a tbsp. of sugar.  It tasted yummy as is, but once I turned off the heat, I threw in about a 1/2 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips!  It sat on the stove while we had dinner, and I reheated for dessert.  I made the "MMM...MMM Better Brownies" also from this site to serve with the peaches and ice cream.   It was a HUGE hit!

Fantastic. The only thing I changed was decreasing the water to 1/4 cup as others suggested. I will definitely use this recipe again.

This worked out perfectly; not too sweet, not too tart. I used it right away (still warm) on pancakes and put the rest in the fridge. It thickened a bit after a day or two, so I used it on toast. Thank you for the recipe.

I've made this, and I continue to make it twice a month.
