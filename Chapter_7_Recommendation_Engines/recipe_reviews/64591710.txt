This is a fantastic barbecue sauce.  I made it for country style pork ribs.  I love guava, but was going to pass on making a barbecue sauce because I used to have a friends who made her own barbecue sauce and it took all day to make.   As I read the recipe I saw that it really only cooks 20 minutes or so.  Yay!
