This was an awful dip...Thank goodness I did a trial run...when I took it out of the oven there were pools of oil on the top and sides...too many fatty ingredients? there were unmixed lumps of cream cheese in various cooked pockets although I had stirred thoroughly...the cream cheese should have been beaten with the other ingredients with heavy duty mix master after softened?  the capers were overwhelming in taste...they should have been finely diced? the garlic was overwhelming...maybe 1 tablespoon vs. 2? You should only use fresh crab meat...the canned taste was unmistakable (I thought that with all the yummy sounding ingredients the canned taste would cook out)

The first time I made it, I [accidentally] left our the Buttermilk. The second time I made it I wished that I had forgotten the Buttermilk; it was much better without it. Next time I make it I will add more crab meat and more artichoke hearts, for a thicker, heartier dip.

Great!!!Very creamy dip with a wonderful blend of flavors.  I added extra Old Bay seasoning (I am from Maryland, we use this spice like salt and pepper!) Someone complained of the artichokes  overpowering the dip- I thought it was terrific since my family and I love artichokes (my kids favorite vegetable).  If you're after more of the crab flavor, scale down the artichokes, don't use them, or use more crabmeat. I have always noticed that artichokes in dips are the most dominant flavor. Like other reviews stated, this recipe can be adapted to many tastes, i.e. using shrimp, lobster, etc.  I actually didn't have cheddar or montery jack cheeses, and substituted asiago cheese and it was great.  Looking forward to making it again with the correct cheeses.

I can say based on my taste test and the tasting by 15 other folks - THIS CRAB DIP (as I prepared it) IS AWSOME!!!} However, I am an accomplished cook so I can get a good feel for a recipe just by reading it. I don't think that 1/2 tsp of dried dill is overpowering for this recipe.

While I love capers, a lot of people do not, so I used non-parielles which are smaller. I would certainly increase the amount of crab, using either all lump or a mix of lump and back-fin depending on the size of my wallet. I think a bit of sherry or white wine would be an acceptable addition. Or some lemon juice.

Do NOT let the long list of ingredients intimidate you - it is WELL worth it.  God this recipe is so so good.  I did one of those 'well I should make sure it tastes ok before I serve it' and kept eating it before it was baked!!!!  I used 2 cans lump crab meat (in the tuna section of the grocery store) and 1/3 can white crab meat from the same section, and was amazed at how good this came out.  The sourdough 'dish' is brilliant.  Served this with wheat thins also, but may put some salt in next time, and serve it with Carr's Table Water crackers.  God I could eat this entire thing alone.

I found this recipe a couple of years ago on allrecipes.com and it has become a favorite of our family! I always make it at holidays & when company comes over. Everyone always loves it. I know alot of people are unsure about putting capers in it, either because they think they wouldn't taste good in it or because they don't know what capers are. I assure you that the capers is a MUST for this recipe. Capers by themselves aren't appetizing, but when added to this recipe, gives it just the right flavor! Trust me!

Fantastic dip!!  I've been looking for a great crab dip for years, and this is absolutely *IT*!  The ingredients can get a bit spendy - there's lots of good stuff in there.  But very much worth it.  

I served it out of a 2 quart crock with sourdough bread and restaurant-style tortilla chips.  It also reheats well in the microwave.

YUMMY!

3 words - OH MY GOSH! I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could - it was SO amazing I didn't want to share! I made a second batch and had some left over (hid it from my hubby) and it was good even cold! Unlike other reviewers, I enjoyed the taste of the capers. If you've never tried them before, add just a few - it gives this recipe a nice flavor. Thank you for sharing Joelle!

This is the best crab dip I've ever made.  I cater for small events and every person I've served it to loves it.  I never have leftovers.  Its even better with shrimp and scallops!

This was really tasty! I made it for my family get-together on Christmas Eve, and everyone loved it! Instead of serving it in a bread bowl, I put out some lime tortilla chips to dip into it. Thanks for the great recipe!

I've made this numerous times and it's a hit every time.  I make it in the crock pot and stir periodically to make sure all the ingredients are mixed in thoroughly.  I do use the imitation crab meat because it's cheaper and I don't put in the capers..just because I don't like them..otherwise I follow the recipe to a "T".  It does get to be an expensive appetiser, but it's so worth it!  I usually use a foccatia bread cut into thin slices and sprayed with butter cooking spray and garlic salt then baked in the oven until crispy...tastes amazing with the crab dip!

Everyone LOVED this. I ommitted capers and used light sour cream and cream cheese. I added water chestnuts and a littel chopped onion.

Yum!!

I used Fontina instead of chedder, not quite a 1/2 c of capers since they are already pretty strong, and 1/2 c of artichoke hearts since other reviewers said that their flavour was overwhelming.  Don't forget to rinse the artichoke hearts since they are in oil (at least mine are) & chop them up.  Remember to buy an extra loaf of bread because one round loaf is not enough...I used french bread which was perfect to cut into slices.

This is, by far, the best hot crab dip around.  I am a chef at a Maryland Seafood Restaurant and I have incorporated this recipe into my menu.  I have customers asking for the recipe and now I can send them here.  What a wonderful array of flavors and texture.  PERFECT!! And, easy to make.  Joelle should come work for me!

received great reviews when served. it works with substitutions  if all not on hand.  My cream cheese was not good  so used brie which  was at hand.  also no jack  cheese and used havarti. all was well, only made half recipe.  The lady whom complained  of floating oil  may have  used artichokes marinated in oil rather than purchasing them in a can.  Should drain well as they add much moisture. One guest  wanted to pass on dinner and just eat this.

This needed to be changed to make it less greasy. I only used half the cheeses and I'll probably use low-fat sour cream instead of full fat. I love capers but this made the dip incredibly salty. I'll use less capers next time. Overall this was a good start.

Overall this is a really great dip...I added lemon juice and more dill and garlic than the recipe called for.  It still could have used a bit more to be honest.  I also added Old Bay both into the mix and then a top.  I omitted the artichoke hearts and capers as I didn't want them to over power the crab per others suggestion.  I used Chicken Of The Sea jumbo lump crab not in a can, but in a plastic tub.  It was really good - not quite the same as fresh SM Seafood but not fishy at all and very fresh.  Overall it's a good recipe but could have used a little more flavor.  I kind of wonder had I not omitted the capers and artichoke would I have felt the same...next time I'm thinking of adding them back, but maybe just not quite what the recipe called for...Thanks Joelleflynn!

Oh. My. Goodness. This is the best crab dip ever.  I made it last fall and it was a huge hit. Today I made it and pumped up the volume on the spices. 1 full teaspoon dill and 1/2 teaspoon Old Bay went into the mix, another 1/2 teaspoon Old Bay sprinkled on top. Also added a few dashes of cayenne. (And I never add buttermilk, I like my dip a little thick)   I bake in a casserole dish and dip with crusty artisan breads.   PS I have the strangest (pregnancy induced) aversion to garlic ---so I halved the minced garlic for this recipe and it still turned out amazing.

I read all the great reviews so I had to try this recipe for myself. It was a huge hit! I made a double batch and used half the amount of capers, which was perfect. I had some leftover and we ate it cold on crackers the next day. We also took some of the leftovers and heated it with a can of diced tomatos with garlic, onion, and basil with a dash of olive oil to make a creamy sauce and served it over penne pasta. It was delicious! You can't go wrong with this recipe!

between the artichoke hearts, the capers, 3 different cheeses etc, unfortunately the flavor of the crab was completely overpowered.  Plus, this recipe was easily twice as big as I wanted/needed.

This recipe has way too many ingredients in it.  It tastes more like an artichoke dip than anything.  My guests were shocked when I told them it was actually a crab dip.

i love this recipe!!! i did cut way back on the cappers, i think i only used 1-2 tbls. i only used 1 tablespoon of garlic and 1 small can of artichokes. i wanted the crab to stand out. next time i will cut back a bit on the sour cream and buttermilk. the dip was a little loose when hot but tightened up when it got cooler. this dip is rich and feeds a big group, so its nice a nice party dish.

I made this with imitation crab and it was still delicious. Received rave reviews when I brought it to a get-together. I also did not have the capers or the special seasoning, so I left those ingredients out and didn't miss them a bit. Great recipe! Thanks. This is one of those dishes I crave from restaurants, so it's so nice to know I can make it at home.

Very good, the only bad part was that everyone kept asking if it was crab or artichoke dip.  The worst part was that I used a really good can of jumbo lump crab, so next time I think I would just cut back on the artichoke.  The recipe made a huge amount which was great. I just wanted it to taste more like crab.

This dip is aptly named! It is truly the best crab dip I've ever had or made.  While it may not be preferred by people who prefer a more simple dip, the artichokes and capers make this absolutely delicious!

Absolutely fantastic! I have been ordered to make this for every family gathering, and I am happy to oblige. I leave out the capers.
  I divide and bake the recipe in 4-5 shallow, oval scampi(?) dishes, then freeze a couple for later use. To freeze, after cooling, wrap dishes first in plastic wrap, then in foil. I serve with little toasts or toasted french bread slices.
  This dip is also awesome served cold and unbaked with chips!

This was a big hit at our New Year's Party. The dish was easy to fix and I did it the day before the party and just wrapped the loaf in aluminum foil and put it in the frige until the next day.

being from maryland, i thought this was pretty bad.  i love capers and i love artichoke, so i was excited, though a little hesitant, to use both in this dip.  following the recipe to exact specs, all i could taste were the chokes & capers, and Old Bay, which was the only saving grace.  i would say, leave out artichokes and capers, and concentrate on the crab in the crab dip.

Excellent crab dip! I make it with low fat cheeses, sour cream and cream cheese and it's still delish! I add more Old Bay because my family loves it.  I don't always have artichoke hearts or buttermilk on hand and it doesn't change the taste of the recipe at all.  I always toast sliced french bread to serve with it.  Thanks Joeelleflynn!

Not too shabby. I took the advice of some others and nixed the canned crab for fake, but the dip ended up tasting a little sweet with it. Next time I will stick with canned or real. Also, I think the dip needs just a little bit of a kick- so next time I will also try adding a little more old bay and cayenne pepper.

This was an excellent dip.  I made it as an appetizer to take to a bbq.  Everyone asked for the recipe and we will definitely be making it again.  
I read the reviews and agree to ensure you keep the capers, they do add that special taste.

great dip for any occation! i also went the reduced calorie route, using lowfat cream cheese, sour cream, and mayo. i couldn't find any old bay seasoning so i just left it and it was still great. i also left out the capers because i don't like them.

This recipe turned out great---I modified a little to reduce calories.  I only used one can of crab (I halved the recipe--it makes a ton!), I used low fat cream cheese, sour cream, and mayo.  I only used a couple hand fulls of shredded colby and monterray jack cheese.  Overall--great dip---I used Ritz crackers for dipping--great combo!!

New home staple recipe as revised.  I was trying to replicate a recipe from my favorite restaurant and did.  Served twice so far with people each time saying dip was best they have had.

I omitted capers and dill and added curry, like my restaurant dish.  I like mine thicker so left out buttermilk.

This is the best dip EVER!!!!!  I didn't put in the capers due to other people's suggestions, and this dip is to die for.  My family has requested this for our Christmas Eve Party, and they now call it "My Famous Crab Dip" thanks to your recipe.  It really reminds me of Red Lobster's Dip, but even better.  Thank YOu@

This crab dip is awesome!  So delicious & so easy to make!  I do, however, have a suggestion.  The bread bowl is great but the bread used for dipping is not hard enough to pick up the dip.  You may want to toast the bread pieces or use bread sticks instead.

My favorite allrecipes recipe so far. I've made this 4 times, and it's always a big hit. Just about any kind of cheese works great. I always 1/2 the artichoke and skip the capers. I also add a little Lawry's Red Pepper Seasoning Salt to the top along with the parmesan and Old Bay. I serve it with crackers or grilled bread brushed with olive oil and garlic. Good stuff! Add a little regular milk and use the leftovers on pasta :)

I've made this a few times with both canned and fresh crab meat; it's always a hit! Cook it in a larger pan than 8x8 though, otherwise it's too full and doesn't heat in the middle.

Everyone loved it! Took others' suggestions and made it without the buttermilk, 2/3 cup of capers, double the Old Bay. Was addictive hot or cold. Went well with tortilla chips and/or crackers as I didn't go the bread bowl route.

I was eager to try this recipe after reading the ingredient list. I just so happened to have some shrimp and crab legs leftover from last night's seafood boil. So no canned crab for us. This was so yummy and flavorful. I decided to not use the capers and only used 1/2 cup of artichokes. I did add onion powder and chopped spinach. Awesome with tortillas chips.Definitely making this again!

Good recipe however all of the cheeses made the dip taste a little bitter. I would suggest using 3/4 or 1/2 amount of white cheddar cheese, I omitted the capers and add would suggest to add a second container of lump crab meat. I also ate the dip with tortillas. Thanks for this recipe.

Not one complaint. Sinfully delicious. Everyone loves it at parties. I leave out capers and artichokes. Might try low fat with everything next time.

I had to make something to take to a party, but didn't have time to go to the store to buy add'l ingredients.  I halved the recipe, since I only had one package of cream cheese, and used diced water chestnuts instead of artichoke hearts.  It was still plenty and VERY popular!  Everyone raved about it and several asked for the recipe. I'll definitely make it again.

This was not a big hit at the party.  It was somewhat bland and expensive with fresh crab and I don't think I'd make it again.

this is a really yummy dip.  i've made it several times for family functions and even the crab haters eat it.  i do chop up the capers since they can be overpowering.  makes quite a bit and i always have sevral people surrounding the dish dipping into it.  tasty and easy.  thanks for the recipe.

Really great dip! I think the bad reviews are from people who just don't know what they are doing. My changes...
I did not put in the capers since I did not have any. I used high quality cheeses which I am sure helps. I used canned crabmeat nothing fancy but I think it would be even better with a higher quality lump crab meat. Took this to my family of very picky eaters and they really loved it.  
Thanks!!

Very good recipe. I come back to this year after year. I looked at my original copy and it was printed in 2003. Use only real crab meat. Canned doesn't do this recipe justice. I don't do the bread bowl - just serve with a variety of crackers and baguette slices. I add a bit more Old Bay (I'm in Maryland - I have to!), only about 1/4 cup of the capers. Also add a bit of crushed red pepper. Recipe is a bit expensive but worth the cost for special events/parties. (I only give 5 stars for truly exceptional recipes - I'd give this 4 1/2 if I could).

Made this for a Thanksgiving crowd of 20 family members and it was wonderful. Creamy, with an excellent blended flavor of artichokes, crab, and cheeses. Served it with a fresh vegetable tray and toasted, bread rounds...everyone loved it! Next time, I'll add more Old Bay seasoning to the mixture (I just put on top with Parmesean cheese as recipe noted).  I think this would also be excellent as a baked potato topper.

I had family down and we made alot of things but this was the best. I used real crabmeat and put the hot dip in a hollowed out round Hawiian bread and everyone could not stop eating it. I served it with cut up hawiian bread. It was taken out the next day and then served cold  and they were eating the entire round bread it was in until there was nothing left!

This dip is great!  I made it without the capers and I add a little extra old bay and it's amazing.  I took it to a party and it was completely gone by the end of the night even the bread bowl was eaten, now I have to bring it to any party that I go to.

This was very delicious and everyone enjoyed it.  I would have liked a bit more kick to it, I thought it was slightly bland, but then I didn't use the capers, so that may have helped.  I would make this again.

This was delicious! I used artificial crab and just pulsed it in the food processor for a few moments and it worked just great. This makes a lot.

Made for Thanksgiving and thought it was great. Omitted the capers as we don't care for that taste. I made the night before and cooked it on Thanksgiving, totally forgetting to add the parmasean cheese and Old Bay Seasoning, and it was fine. Also used imitation crab and couldn't tell the difference. I like the suggestion of another reviewer about using Asiago cheese. I think that might give it a nice "kick." It makes a ton. If you make ahead of time, bake it another 10 minutes to compensate for everything being so cold. I also used only half of the garlic and you could still taste it quie a bit. A keeper for sure.

This dip was ok but I had to add 2 additional cups of shrimp to make it substantial enough for our tastes.  The amount of crab called for in the recipe got lost in all that cheese, mayo and buttermilk.  I also would cut way back on or omit the capers next time.  Didn't care for the salty, tangy bite in there.  Also would add some Asiago cheese next time.  I think that would bring it to being close to our favorite restaurant crab dip.

I have made this dip at least 3 or 4 times and all my family, friends and coworkers loved it. I pretty much followed the recipe to a "T" but sprinkled on more Old Bay and a little ground red pepper on top before baking. Also, I just served it in a casserole dish with crackers and bread chunks on the side for dipping.  I am going to make it again for another family event but I think this time I may add a little horseradish to pep it up even further.  Thanks Joelle! You really do know your crabs! Yum!

This was incredible.  My party could not stop raving about it.  A suggestion is to add a teaspoon or more of Old Bay while mixing and then add the teaspoon or more again to the top at the end.  Also, it makes quite a serving so you might want to consider cutting down the ingredient amounts.  I had 10 people and it could have served 25 as an appetizer.

Great flavors, but I found that the other ingredients overpowered the crab.  I made it again with a full pound of crab (a little over 2 cups) and half the other ingredients (except for the topping ingredients)and liked it better.  I also found on both occasions that it was runny.  I squeezed the liquid out of the artichoke hearts and capers, but that didn't help.  The only thing I can think of is that I baked it longer (accidentally) than I was supposed to.  Any ideas?

This recipe was wonderful.  Made it for a party and it was the only thing that was all gone.  I used fresh King Crab and left the capers out.  Next time I'll try using low fat ingredients.

I got mixed reviews on this one. Some thought there was too much cream cheese and others couldn't get enough of it and asked for the recipe. It was a little too creamy for me too, If I made it again, I'd probably leave out the cream cheese or the buttermilk (cause I never have it). Also, I'd serve it with bagel chips. The sourdough didn't help the creamy factor.

It wasn't the best, but I would make it again. Next time I will use less Mayo. That was all I could taste at first until the flavors melded. Also, I cooked it in one dish and had to increase cooking time to double what the recipe called for.

One of the best dip recipes I have ever used.  I used this recipe at a party that I catered and got rave reviews and a request for it to be made again.  The only thing I changed is the capers...I did not use them.  You CAN NOT screw this recipe up.  I used imitation crab meat from the seafood department and it was hard to tell the difference or maybe it tasted so good that no one minded.  I don't recommend crab meat out of a can for this recipe.  It will need to be stirred and set for a few minutes before you put it in the bread bowl.  It is definitely a rich recipe but YUMMY!

A real crowd pleaser!  The first time I made it I only tweaked it a little, and it turned out a little blend, but people still liked it.  The second time, I used real crab meat AND twice as much as the recipe called for.  I also held back on the artichoke, used nearly twice the amount of dill & Old Bay, and added a touch of cayenne to give it a kick.  Because I had to change it up, I would have given this a 4.5.

It was very easy to make as well as tasty.  Although I substituted a flavored sour cream, such as onions and chives in place of basic sour cream.

I made this dip for the first time two years ago for Thanksgiving.  Now, the family looks forward to it every year.  I usually double the recipe and it is devoured before the turkey comes out of the oven!  Great dip!!

Big hit at our "gourmet club".  I did not use the sourdough bread (pita crackers on the side instead), skipped the capers and used spicy artichoke hearts.

This was a very tasty & popular appetizer.  I used 2 cans of lump crabmeat & 2 cans of backfin crabmeat.  Next time.  I would probably do entirely all lump meat.  I served the dip in a bread bowl with crisp crackers.  I did struggle with the dip being a little too runny & I had difficulty with it browning nicely on the top.  I resorted to broiling it for the last 5 minutes.  Overall, this is a definite do-again.  Thank you.

this really is the best crab dip!  due to supplies on-hand, i had to alter the recipe a bit...namely, had to forgo the capers, monterey jack cheese, dill and Parmesan Cheese.  Also didn't have any mayo so instead used half a cup of miracle whip.  despite all these changes it was still absolutely delicious!

HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT - No one liked it - overpowered by capers! My daughter uses the Garlic Crab Artichoke Dip recipe - use garlic and herb lipton soup instead of garlic & mushroom.  It is delicious, much easier to make and WILL get eaten unlike this recipe!

While it wasn't that bad I didn't feel that it tasted like much.  Too much cheese.  If I were to make it again I would lay off the chesse and add something to make it more flavorful.  Definitly not what I was expecting from all the great reviews.

This is some yummy crab dip. I didn't have any capers or artichokes on hand but it still came out delicious. I did add some fresh grated onions, used garlic powder and added a splash of white wine. I also baked some pita bread and served with the dip. Definitely a keeper recipe.

HOLY COW!  This dip is fantastic.  It's kind of time consuming and spendy to make, but sooooo worth it.  I've tasted a lot of different  dips, but none compare to this one.  I made it for a Home Interiors party and everyone wanted the recipe, and nobody could stop eating it.  Makes a lot, too!

I made this for my work Christmas party and had a ton of leftovers.  I thought it was great - I guess my coworkers tastes are less refined than my own.(:  My husband wasn't crazy about it either - said it tasted like blue cheese.  It must be the capers.

Yum-Yum. This recipe was wonderful. I left out the artichokes and capers. We mixed the old bay seasoning in instead of adding it to the top. It turned out wonderful. Made it for the 4th of July and everyone loved it.

I recently made this dip for a family outing. It went over very well, especially with the female family members. I served it with sourdough bread, which I sliced and brushed each side of the bread wit olive oil and grilled on my outside gas grill.Icut each slice of bread into small wedges.

This recipe rocks.  I've been looking for a great artichoke crab dip for a long time.  This ones a keeper.  I cut mayo and buttermilk in half and forgot the sour cream but it came out great anyway.  It just must not have been as creamy as the original but loved it anyhow.  I didn't serve in a bread bowl just a small cast iron skillet with crustinis and crakers.  yum yum

WOWZER!  I kicked this up a notch by substituting Emeril's Essence for the Old Bay and Pepper Jack for the White Cheddar.  I also gave it a couple of shakes of crushed red pepper, only one can of the artichoke hearts and cut back to half of the buttermilk.  Only the crumbs from the breadbowl remained!  Delicious!

Makes far too much dip, and I was not thrilled with the results.   It isn't bad, but nothing I'd recommend or make again.  I used fresh Dungeness crab, which is very expensive, and was wonderful by itself, but it was a waste putting it into a dip.

Made it to the recipe and it was wonderful. I used King crab and may have put in a little more than the recipe called for but you can't go wrong with more crab.

This dish is very creamy.   I'm not a huge fan of capers, and only added 2 T to add that level of flavor.  The cheddar cheese isn't necessary, and I'd probably reduce the amount of mayo in the future.  I would add more parmesan cheese and Old Bay if I remake again.  A couple dashes of sherry and cayenne pepper might taste good too.  I used real snow crab leg meat.

I made the mistake of using Trader Joe's canned crab meat because I heard it was good (I am near Dallas).  ONLY use fresh crab for this recipe.  I omitted the buttermilk but next time will use.  I used 1 can of artichokes because of negative reviews; however that amount was lost in the rest of the ingredients - next time will use 2 cans.  The non-pareils were an excellent touch.  The recipe calls for an 8" x 8" square pan.  This is a mistake.  I needed a 4 quart bowl to bake this in.

I'd make this again... was a little hesitant for all the strong flavor but with the right adjustments this was well received.  I cut back the garlic to one clove and the capers wayyyy back to one two tbsp or so, they're not my favorite flavor but wanted to give the taste a try.  I will admit the capers compliment the artichoke flavor nicely.  I think the big difference was using gruyere in place of the cheddar, its a less oily cheese with more bite.  People gave it high stars and with my kitchenaid mixer it was very easy.  Was excellent with tortilla chips.  The recipe makes a lot of dip.

So terrible that I made an account just to leave this review. I'm a displaced Northeasterner, and I decided to give this recipe a try for a potluck.

I am a chef by trade and have made crab and artichoke dip many times; I was looking for something a bit different and opted for this recipe on account of the capers and buttermilk.

After $50 of ingredients and the better part of an hour, I decided to toss the filling and at least save the sourdough.

I followed this recipe to the letter, and my advice to others is this: there are plenty of other great crab dip recipes out there - steer clear of this one.

Crab dip is one of my all time go to dips. I LOVE THIS RECIPE. I did change out imitation crab meat for the real thing otherwise, I pretty much followed the rest of the recipe.GJC

Used 3 cans bumble bee pink crabmeat. Couldn't taste crab and hub said it tasted like asparagus! Not sure what went wrong since so many people gave excellent review. Maybe you need fresh crabmeat but I wouldn't want to risk making this again with the fresh stuff at $20/lb!

I did make this for a holiday party last night.  It was too bland.  I followed the recipe exactly and it did bubble up and get a nice crispy top.  The flavor was just too subtle for me and most of my friends who tried it. If I remade it I'd add more garlic, pepper, etc.. seasonings to it.  Probably won't make it again though.

I found the dip too salty, overpowering the crab. It is creamy. But just blah.

Absolutely fantastic.  Another hit from Allrecipes.com.  I strongly recommend adding more crab meat.  I used both imitation, premium/fresh and canned crab meat for extra meat (this will help you cut costs vs buying premium/fresh crab meat).

This dip was amazing. I followed the recipe except I left out the capers & added onion powder & old bay seasoning. Served with bagel chips instead of bread. Will definitely make again!

I generally follow recipes to the "T," at least the first time I make them, and that's what I did with this crab dip recipe. Served it with toasted Naan bread, cut into wedges. Based on the many ingredients, it was expensive to make, but the taste was incredible and every bit as delicious as any I've had in a restaurant. Made it for a group of 8 people, we ate ... and ate ... and ate it, and still had some left over, so next time I would half the recipe and it would still be a generous amount as an appetizer for 6 to 8 people. (BTW, I drained the artichoke hearts as the recipe indicated, and had no problem with oil).

This was a great dip, no problems whatsoever!
I did adjust some ingredients to fit my taste and my families,but usually do this with most that I try.
Thanks,for sharing.

I had high hopes for this recipe.  The ingredients cost a fortune - I bought the best jack and cheddar cheese I could find.  I made it exactly as written and nobody could eat it.  It was just awful.

I'm glad I didn't read the reviews before I made the dip. It is outstanding. I followed the recipe, however I didn't measure, I used the eyeball technique and it worked well. One thing to remember; drain the capers and artichokes before mixing in. I could see why it would be oily if not. Also, I made it at 4:30pm to serve at 6:00pm. Having time to settle helps. Overall, easy and low-maintenance....my kind of recipe. Enjoy!

I made this for a party and it was fabulous. I took the advise of others and did not use capers and only one half of a can of artichoke hearts, chopped very well. I bought two containers of lump crab meat in the refrigerated section and it was very expensive. Next time I will buy the back fin because of all the other ingredients it would not have mattered. I probably tripled the old bay and dill. I also used my potato masher to get the lumps out of the cream cheese. It made a lot. I took it to a party of 22 and brought half of it home, however it warmed up nicely in the microwave. I would make this again for a large party. Oh and I heated it up in a pottery pie dish and use baguette bread for dipping.

I made this New Years eve. I added all lump crab, all the cheeses, mayonnaise and sour cream. I cut the capers back to 1 Tbsp. Chopped. I only used approximately 8 oz. Artichoke hearts chopped. I cut back on garlic to 1 Tbsp., 1/2 tsp. pepper, 1 tsp. dried dill, 1 tsp. Old bay. I did make an addition of 1 tsp. dried mustard, 1 tsp. worsetershire sauce. And 1 Tbsp. Dry sherry. I looked at all the reviews before diving in, and with the tweaking all of my guests raved about this!

I tweaked this recipe a bit. I'm not a big fan of capers so I left them out & artichokes tend to overpower so I added more crab instead. I also left out the buttermilk & substituted 2% milk (3/4 of a cup was more than enough). Being a Marylander myself...I added a tablespoon of old bay to the mixture as well as on top. Baked 20 minutes & served sliced French bread for a little bulk with the dip.

Very good recipe with a few modifications:  * I cut the recipe in half (because it was just a lot of dip) * Even after cutting it in half, I still only used about a half pound of fresh crab meat (1lb was just way too much!) *I omitted the capers just because the recipe tasted great with out them - however if you were to add them I would drastically cut them - by half or more.  * I also halved the amount of artichokes (again by at least half). *I also omitted the buttermilk - it was great with out it * I also cut the mayo in half. * Lastly I added a teaspoon of crushed red pepper and doubled the old bay seasoning.  Tossed it all in a crock pot and VOILA - it was great!

I feel bad for giving this recipe such a poor rating but it was just not for me.  I really feel bad for wasting the lump crab meat my father hand picked and froze for me.  Here's the thing. I love crab.  I love the way it tastes and when I eat something with crab, I want crab to be the primary taste in the dish. The garlic, capers, and saltiness just totally took away from crab.  I actually felt very dehydrated after eating it..  This dip just wasn't for us.

I made the dip with suggestions from the other reviews but I personally think the 1/2 cup of Capers should be cut down to 1/4 cup capers !! I took the dip to my sista's house for a BBQ and EVERYONE loved the dip..It's great with Wheat thins and also I only use 1 jar of Artichoke hearts !!

I got mixed reviews on this one.  I followed the recipe as written and took it to a party.  Some LOVED it and some thought it was OK.  There was about a 1/4 of the batch leftover and I felt bad about throwing it out, but it's seafood and I never save seafood after it has been sitting out.

Gave this a try and was a bit disappointed.  Way too many flavor combinations.  Only used half the amount of capers and it was still a bit overpowering.

This recipe is just awesome.  I made it for a Superbowl party and it was a big hit.  I allowed the dish to get cold and received rave reviews after it had cooled down as well.  The capers seem to give this dish the extra pizzazz, so don't leave them out when preparing.

This dip was o.k..  It may have something to do with the fact I can't get decent crabmeat in Switzerland.  The dip came out with the flavor and texture of a tuna dip.

As per the suggestions, I reduced the amount of capers and artichokes.  I upped the amount of Old Bay Seasoning, cheddar and parmesian cheeses.  Leaving it to chill in the refrigerator 24 hours prior to popping it into the oven seems to "mature" the flavors.

It didn't all go at the party but I'll try it again.

WOW!!  My husband and I had a great crab and artichoke dip at a restaurant the other night, and we wanted to find a recipe to try and make it ourselves.  Based on the reviews of this recipe, I decided to go for it.  It turned out GREAT!!!  I didn't change a thing, except I halved the recipe which was still way too much for just 2 people.  I also substituted locatelli cheese for the Parmesan, b/c I like the taste a lot better.  Wonderful!!  5 stars!!! Will definitely make again.  Can't wait for football season to start and bring this to parties!!

This crab dip is so delicious, but very expensive to make. I made it with fresh crab meat which cost me a fortune (I was surprised that canned artichoke hearts and capers are pricey, too), and served it in the pan with crackers, rather than a bread bowl. Everyone said it was delicious. The next time I'll try making it with canned crabmeat, instead of fresh.

This is a great recipe if you are cooking something light for your entree.  It's a little on the heavy/fattening side.

This is a pretty good dip.  I added some hot sauce and a little Worcestershire to mine.   I also substituted fresh dill instead of dried.
