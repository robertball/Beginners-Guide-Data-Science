My suggestions:

1. Fully caramelize the onions 
2. Mix ground beef with seasoning, such as pinch of salt, steak seasoning, garlic powder, parsley
3. Cook ground beef with onions
4. Mix together with the mashed potatoes and season to taste.  
5. No need to dredge in flour first, just dip in egg then panko.  
6. Don't make the croquettes too large or too thin or they will not hold together.

Finally, I baked these on a cooling rack, sprayed with butter to crisp them up.  400 until browned, about 20 mins.

my grandmother inlaw makes these and they are extremely good. A few tips for some of the people who didn't think it held up well. Before breading the croquettes chill them for an hour and also instead of flour use japanese panko breadcrumbs. It's a much nicer texture and contrast than flour. All in all it was great recipe, we ate it with a Japanese plum dipping sauce made with umeboshi plums.

Yum! Nice and soft and lighter than meatballs. I'd probably add a bit more soy sauce or something else for a little more kick next time. Ginger? Red pepper flakes or chili sauce? I'll try!  Thanks for this recipe!

This is a good basic recipe for croquettes.  I grew up eating these as my Japanese mom taught us to use chopsticks before a fork!  The only thing I would suggest is to not use flour just drege in egg batter then panko.  (plain bread crumbs aren't the same.  Panko is a must.) Soy sauce is really not necessary.  Green onions and a little pepper to your taste are great.  I like to eat these with a little yellow mustard, but the rest of my family uses tonkatsu or the kids use ketchup.  Yummy!!!

I loved these.  We did use a lot less onion than in the recipe, only about a half of a large onion, but I'm not very fond of a strong onion taste.  They didn't taste very Japanese to me, but they were a lot tastier than boring old meatballs and mashed potatoes!  I'd definitely make again.

I make these without soy sauce, but add white pepper and salt to the potato mixture.  I, for one, love these with the tonkatsu sauce and fresh cabbage.  I used to ask for these for my birthday dinner as a child!  I personally never thought I would find this recipe on Allrecipes but I guess that's why it's called "Allrecipes"!

This is a way better recipe than the one I made before. These actually turned out, my other ones tasted just like potato pancakes, no flavor at all!

My husband and I thought these were a little bland and my daughter did not like them at all.  They didn't really hold together that well either.

I didn't think of it as a recipe my family would enjoy, nor that I would make it again. However, when I told my family this over dinner, they balked.  They thought it was terrific! I had used some leftover mashed potatoes.  My husband had made some a few weeks before, getting creative and adding curry powder, and I thought they tasted weird but saved them in the freezer.  Didn't work for American flavors but with this dish, I would recommend adding some to your potatoes!   I also added garlic and ginger to the ground beef, extra soy, and left out the flour step.  The panko was a delicious crust.  Guess we'll be adding this to our rotation!

Very yummy! For my mix, I chopped 4 potatoes for my mixture, then separated it in 2 bowls.  In one bowl- I mixed diced beef and onions, and in the other bowl, corn with a little more pepper. (The corn croquettes were always my favorite while living in Japan.)  Then made the patties and such like the recipe instructs.  They were both delicious.  My boyfriend actually liked the corn one best.  Both were topped with Tonkatsu sauce.  I found the trickiest part was making a good sized patty, and getting them to not fall apart while doing the egg- and Panko'ing.  I'll make these again!  Thanks for the recipe!

I was looking for a croquette recipe, like the ones I could get at a Japanese izakaya. These turned out pretty well. I felt like there was a little too much ground beef and onion though, so I cut it down. I also added garlic salt, pepper and cooked the beef and onions together like another reviewer suggested. I had no trouble forming the patties, and I also did not use flour as I like a lighter crust. They stayed together well.

My grandmother used to make this for me when I was a little girl & I have been searching for this recipe for ages!  It was very good!  I did not dredge the patties in flour before dipping them in egg.  Turned out fabulous!

Delicious! add a lil' corn (kids esp love) and give a pinch of sugar w/soy to ground beef - a splash of mirin or white wine will also enhance the flavor - these make a great grab n go or after school hearty snack - we enjoy once a month.

I wasn’t sure what the ratio of potatoes and meat should be. Should it be 1/2 and 1/2??  I had a hard time keeping the patty together during the dipping process. I did add extra seasoning but not enough for my family. It was a lot a trouble to make. I’m not sure if I will make again.

Two very urgent recommendations: First, After dredging in flour, but before the egg and panko treatment, let them rest  uncovered in your refrigerator for as long as you can. (at least a half an hour). this will help them stay breaded and in one piece in the fryer (the outside will cook before the inside gets hot enough to release steam, so the whole thing doesn't blow apart in the fryer.

Second, Less potato, More meat. Id suggest a full pound of meat, and maybe 2 taters instead of 3. that's more my own personal preference.

Very delicious!  I added garlic powder, more soy sauce, ginger, seamen oil.  Just used eggs and panto, no flour.  Works great when patties are cold. Will definitely make again.  Even made some gluten free.

First time try and they were good.  However, next time I will use worchester sauce in place of the soy sauce.  Will season potatoes and beef with salt, pepper, pepper flakes perhaps.  I will also try cooling the mixture before making the croquettes as someone suggested.  I found them a little loose and difficult to form into patties.  Will definitely try again.

Add extra soy sauce and sugar, reduce by 1 potato. Don't need to do the flour step. I baked: 375 degrees for 30 minutes
