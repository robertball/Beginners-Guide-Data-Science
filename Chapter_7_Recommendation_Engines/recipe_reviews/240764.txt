This was excellent!  Anyone squeamish about wild game will soon forget their apprehension after tasting this pie.  About the only thing I might change next time is that, since I had a lot of filling left over, I might try to make two regular depth pies instead of one deep dish pie.

This was great! We eat Pheasant at least once a week and this is the first recipe where it actually tastes as good as chicken! My husband liked this so much that he asked me to make it two days in a row!

I brined the pheasant for two days prior. I used my glass pie pan and there was way more filling than I needed. The flavor is amazing. I cut the carrots and celery into small bits. This is a great recipe

Great flavor and sauce is perfect consistency.   I didn't have celery seed so I used celery salt in place of celery seed and salt.  I also used fresh sage since I had it.  Next time we may add potatoes to add more too it.

This is the best pot pie I've ever made...hands down.  If I had more time I would have made my own crust, but I brushed the top crust with a glaze from one beaten whole egg for a pretty finish.  I have never had Pheasant before, but this pie was a wonderful introduction.  So incredibly savory.  I got rave reviews from all who ate it.  Thanks for the great recipe!

We loved this recipe! It came out the perfect consistency and tasted delicious! I had to make some substitutions because of what I had. Instead of chicken broth, I used 2 c. of water and 6 chicken bouillon cubes. I also used 1.5 tsp of celery salt instead of celery seed and frozen peas instead of canned. These are minor changes and it came out excellent! Thanks for this!
