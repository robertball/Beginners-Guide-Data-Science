For the milk issue: Often in scone recipes the milk measurement is less of an exact measurement and more of a "you can use up to" 3/4 cup milk. You add milk until the dry ingredients just pull together.

Needs some revision--either less milk or more flour!  They are rather dry. I made these with crisp peaches, and the peach flavor seemed "lost".  As I've made these with honey and whole wheat flour instead of sugar and white flour, I've really liked these!  I've been using fresh dewberries to replace the blueberries.  I now know that this is a great recipe!

I absolutely LOVE these scones.  I must admit I cheated by giving the recipe to my mother and asked her to make it.  She has made it several times for me and it is still my favorite breakfast food.  Not too sweet and warmed up with a pat of butter makes it perfect with a cup of coffee!

These were good, I did make a couple changes. I used whole wheat pastry flour and I added a little bit of brown sugar. Also left out the pecans, and after the milk wash I sprinkled a little white sugar on top. I was kind of surprised but my boyfriend enjoyed them :)

These scones are very hearty.  I also found that there was too much milk.  I would cut back to 1/4 cup if using blueberries, as they add some additional moisture.  Not too sweet.  Good and hearty.

It was good, but not quite what I was looking for in a scone.  My family, on the other hand, inhaled them!  Thanks Sarah!

I took others advice and added milk just until the dough combined; it was less than 3/4 cup. I didn't have fresh or frozen berries so soaked some dry ones in warm water for 30 minutes. I was completely happy with the resulting scones. They were much more moist than I expected scones to be. My husband thought they were great. I wouldn't mind them with slightly less sugar but my husband disagreed - sweetness is entirely a matter of taste!

These scones will not be dry if you substitute buttermilk for regular milk.  Also, when it comes to adding liquid to scones you have to add it more gradually..............all flour is not the same.  In other words use caution.     Very very few recipes are perfect.   For example, I live in Canada and if I use an recipe from the U.S. I have to use less flour.......

The only thing I really found missing from this recipe was the salt!   Add 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon...it makes all the difference flavor wise.   I find that I end up using 1/2 cup milk, tossing the rest.  Also, I use dried blueberries (reconstituted a bit by soaking in warm water...they don't bleed into the dough like fresh berries!).    Anyway, I was really surprised that such healthy scone could really taste "scone like".   My husband used to always buy regular white flour blueberry scones  where he works, but now he actually prefers these...and this is not a man who gives up white flour and sugar easily.   So, if you're trying to switch to healthier foods, this is a good transition recipe!

Tasty and healthy and a little different. I needed to add more flour before it could be rolled out. To add more berry yumm my daughter and i tweaked things a bit. We made a blob of dough with a crater and then added some preserves to the center and put more dough on top. She said is tasted better than Starbucks.

I've been looking for an oatmeal scone recipe for quite some time and I've now found it.  Minor adjustments that I did included only using steel cut oats for a nuttier, crunchy flavour plus wholewheat flour and about 1/2 cup of milk until the dough came together.  I also made eight separate scones and poked four holes into each.  I then put fresh raspberries into these holes and dusted the scones with icing sugar once they cooled.  Fabulous, reminds me of a scone that I used to get from a lovely cafe in Calgary.  Next time I'll try with blueberries.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I decreased the milk to about 1/2 cup, and probably could have used a little less. I also added a little cinnamon and sugar to the top. This recipe is delicious, and I would definitely make it again!

These tasted really really good.  However, I had a hard time kneading the blueberries into the dough.  I used the 3/4 cup of heavy cream instead of milk, and I didn't think it was too much liquid as some reviewers indicated.  

I topped them with maple cream and it was just perfect, the crunchy edges with the oats made them especially delicious.

These were my first scones.  I thought these were awesome!  I used quick oats because that's what I had, subbed brown sugar for white, used walnuts, added a little cinnamon and salt and used about less milk (1/2 Cup) per reviewers suggestions. I had them warm with a cup of coffee and yum!

I followed the less milk, more flour bit this time and the dough looks easier to mold! The first time I tried adding a pack of instant oatmeal for flavoring. The subtle maple flavor was amazing! Now I'm adding apple cinnamon, and it smells great!

These were okay.  The dough was much stickier like a cookie dough so they ended up looking like cookies.  They also seemed really dry to me.  The flavor was good, but the presentation was misleading and made me wanting oatmeal cookies.

I made one small change so my rating is probaby unfair but I will remake and rerate it. I used orange juice instead of milk and only used about half a cup. It was still way too liquidy so I will start with less next time and add as needed. Just tasted like baked oatmeal which is not a bad thing.

The recipe is incorrect in using three-quarter cup of milk. It created a soggy mess. I had to increase the flour, using three-quarter cup extra of all purpose flour and about 2 tablespoons of whole wheat. That wasn't really enough either. I had to cover it with flour to pat it down just so it wouldn't be super sticky. Because I had to have so much extra flour the flavor was very mild. But I think if you just start very slowly with some milk, perhaps adding first a quarter cup of milk and then a tablespoon at a time until you get it to the correct consistency, it's full flavor will probably blossom.

I really liked this recipe although my changes probably altered the taste.  As anyone who loves to bake, and try new things,  you improvise if you don't have something  I only had un-bleached white flour, dark brown sugar and no milk, so I used orange juice.  Everything else was the  same.  It definitely gives it a zing, but it's really good.  Next time I will definitely add vanilla, nutmeg and cinnamon.  I'll also cut the milk (orange juice) back to 1/4 cup.

Not quite like a scone I've ever had but it was pretty good warm with a little melted butter on top! I did reduce the milk to a little over 1/2 a cup based on the reviews I saw.

These scones are very easy and taste great!  I make them for my Grandmother all the time and she loves them! These scones have more milk than most and end up not as dry.  I personally like that but as most don't I would suggest adding 1/4 - 1/2 cup of milk instead.

I found it bland unfortunately. I substituted honey for white sugar following other recommendations. I too found it needed more flour.

I followed recipe but soon found out that the milk measurement should be reduced, so I added more flour to form a thick sticky dough. I used butter on my hands to form shape. Changes: I added orange zest to dough and increased sugar from 1/3 to 1/2 cup. I also made a glaze from juiced orange and powered sugar and drizzled cooled scones.

Made a few changes by adding 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg, substituted brown sugar for the white sugar and used sliced almonds instead of pecans. If I'm in the mood for a little more sweet, I drizzle a lemon glaze on top.

This is a great recipe.  I have made it with both blueberries and blackberries and they have turned out great. I used buttermilk since I had it on hand and used just enough to moisten the dough.  I did mine as drop biscuits using an ice cream scoop and flattening them.  My kids loved them.

These were great, could be a little sweeter on their own but with jam were perfect.

Made recipe exactly as written up to cutting into 8 wedges. Because it was so "gummy" I put on lightly greased baking sheet in one large circle sprinkled with turbinado sugar, baked for 25 minutes, cut into wedges and moved apart on baking sheet and baked for another five minutes.  They are quite good and will make them again either with less milk or the same way.  I read the reviews after the fact when wondering what I had omitted or what had gone wrong.

They seemed to spread out too much. They were too much like a large cookie.

I liked these but did find them too dry.  I also added more blueberries.

I also found this recipe required too much milk and needed something more, so  I modified this recipe by reduced milk to 1/4 cup. I added 1/4 c. sour cream to the milk and wisked the two together. I still needed to add between 2-3 T. flour to the batter at the end to shape the dough into a ball and cut into 8ths. I omitted the nuts and it was very good.

There isn't much to the scones. I'm left wanting more flavor. I'd suggest cinnamon &/or brown sugar. The texture was fine for an oatmeal recipe, but I did not end up using all the milk like others. I think I'll try these again with more tweaks.

The first time I made these they weren't doughy enough but I put them in the over anyways to see what would come out. They came out like over sized cookies and my husband ended up absolutely LOVING them! He said they reminded him of strawberry rhubarb pie. I tweaked it a little bit - I added 1/3 brown sugar and used frozen strawberries instead of blueberries - they worked perfectly fine. My husband begs me to make this all the time now!

This is the recipe I run for when my blueberry bushes are ready for picking!!  Made a few small modifications: Added a tsp of cinnimon and tbsp of vanilla, Sometimes I cut down the butter and replace with applesauce, and I have never had pecans in the house when I make these but sometimes I add blackberries.  DELICIOUS!!  I spoon them out onto a cookie sheet for bite sizes individual scones and they are wonderful!!

I found that if I used less milk as the other reviews stated, it worked out fine. I also folded in the blueberries being careful not to smash the fruit and my scones didn't have the blue hue as other comments stated. Scones are not the sweetest so I also added some preserves on the inside, and created an icing out of powdered sugar and milk to drizzle on the top after baking. YUM!

These are delicious.  I made no significant revisions except to add just a few more fresh blueberries than a cup and flax seed meal, which I add to most of my baked goods.  My husband raved about them, and he is not usually a fan of scones.
