My plank was a 7x12 and then maybe 1/3 inch thick.  I soaked the cedar plank for about 6 hours in a mix of water and white wine (2 cups water, and then about a cup of white wine) in a glass baking dish.  To keep it down I put a glass on top.  I had 3 portions of salmon fillets (1.8 lbs total) and it took about 35 minutes on the grill.  It's a gas grill so I kept the temperature at around 300 the first 25 minutes and then raised it to 350.  Next time I'll cook it at 350 (I was afraid of the plank but didn't need to be).  When I took it out, the fish was at 140 degrees.  The salmon turned out very moist and flavorful.  Thank you Kraft (and Allrecipes) for helping me with my first time cooking on a plank.

This was delicious and so easy, especially since I had everything on hand except the cedar planks.   The salmon had lots of flavor but it was not overwelming.  This is defintitely better than the boring lemon pepper salmon I make all the time.

This is my very favorite way to cook salmon.  I bought a whole bundle of cedar shingles from Home Depot just to grill salmon.  I use Ken's sun-dried tomato vinaigrette or a balsalmic vinaigrette and chop up sun-dried tomatoes in oil.  Excellent and VERY easy to make, which is a big bonus.

This was ok, but needed help. I love sundried tomatoes, but im not sure if i love this combination.  Our store didnt have the sundried tomato vinagerette, so i used olive oil vinagerette instead, and just mixed in a little of the sundried tomato juice. Anyway, i had to season the salmon very well first with salt and pepper, because just like my meats no salt=no good.  So I did that and the rest as follows but it just wasnt wowing me.  I just wasnt feeling this combination that well, i dont know. we still ate it and were satisfied, but it just didnt do it for me.  I spent $11 on a 1 1/2 pound salmon and would have prefered to do it how i usually do.  I dont think i'll be making again.

Excellent taste and incredibly easy.  We enjoy adding some extra sun-dried tomatoes to the recipe.

My method is after soaking the plank and getting the grill up to desired heat, place plank on grill without fish.
Leave grill uncovered and wait for plank to begin to smoke. Lay fish on plank and close the lid on the grill and close all the vents on the grill lid(if that applies)... Then cook according to this recipe.
