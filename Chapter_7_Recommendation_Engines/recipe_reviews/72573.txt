It was so good to find a recipe that used only three ingredients that were all practically necessities in your pantry. This recipe was unbelievably easy and tasted great! However,if you are going to make this recipe, customise it to serve eight because to serve four it turns out reall small.

I LOVE sponge cake but I've never made one before until now.  this one was so easy and so good! I did add some vanilla, though, like others suggested. I will definitely make again.

This recipe turns out great if you do it right. 
First beat the eggs until they are fluffy, then add slowly the sugar and continue beating until the batter is spungy and fluffy. Sift flour over top of batter and fold it under with one of the beaters. Since I had no self-rising flour, I used regular flour and 1/2 tsp baking powder - sift the b.p. over the flour and mix it under, then sift the flour over the batter.
Put batter in an UNGREASED baking pan or just lightly spray the pan, peferably a spring form. I lined the bottom with wax paper then very lightly sprayed the rim with baking spray (just a tad so the batter wouldn't stick). Bake on middle rack for about 15-17 min. It comes out great. 
Let cake cool in the pan for about 10 min then invert it on a cake rack take off the wax paper and put it right side up on a plate.

This recipe is so good because most people have the ingredients at home already so theres no need to go out and by new things. It's so simple and quick to make. And I've made it and it tastes great!

This sponge cake is pretty tasty.  I added a little strawberry topping to it, which I made by mashing strawberries and some sugar for sweetness together to create a kind of chunky paste which spooned on top of the sponge cake.  While it is egg-y, it's still delicious. Make sure you whip the eggs enough.

This is a recipe i have played with for a while now. I find it very easy to do. But with a few variations i found it to be just right. First i seperate the eggs and beat the whites and sugar. then gradualy add the yokes. this creates more air in the cake. then i found adding a touch of SR flour in place of the Corn flour you really get more lift to compensate the cake flopping after baking.

Looking to recreate the birthdays of my childhood in England, my mum (RIP) used to make this same sponge cake with 3oz sugar/3oz SR flour and 3 eggs.  It was light and fluffy.  She would sandwich with jam, sliced bananas and whipped cream, then make a glace icing of confections suger and lemon on top.       She made it seem so easy, so not sure what I did wrong; perhaps I over beat the eggs, or should have used cake flour, or over folded it or cooked for too long, but mine turned dry and tough!        Unfortunately I did not realize how bad mine was until we had to cut into my cake with a hacksaw  my son's 2nd birthday party, it was alittle bit embarrasing!          I will try again until I perfect this.

I would add some butter if you want a proper sponge cake!

This was so easy!  I used this as a substitute for ladyfingers in a Tiramisu recipe and it was perfect.  This is not a very sweet cake and is best suited for a recipe that has more complex flavors (i.e. Boston Creme Pie, Strawberry Shortcake etc).

This should get 10 stars for simplicity!  My husband had bought some beautiful strawberries and after dinner we thought of strawberry shortcake.  Of course I had nothing for the cake (his favorite is sponge cake) so I popped onto AR and found this quick, simple recipe.  In no time flat we had a great smelling and looking cake, great strawberries and homemade whipped cream for the topping.  Like a few others said it did have a bit of an eggy taste, but not over-powering.  Next time I might try 2 eggs instead of 3 and add a bit of water.  This was very tasty.

THis is a really simple cake that is perfect for fancy icings or just plain powedered sugar dusting on top.  It is very eggy tasting, my family and I love that taste, but we also put vanilla ext in -just 1/2 tsp cuts the egginess and it is equally good like that. You have to love REAL tasting food to like this recipe. If you like "cake mix tasting "cakes, skip this one.

This was a good easy recipe to make, I added 2 Tablespoons of cocoa to make it a chocolate sponge.  I made two chocolate sponges and sandwiched them with cream as a birthday cake.

This is the perfect sponge cake. Add a dash of vanilla and a dash of milk and it's perfect. No eggy taste at all! I made a topping of (1 Cup) Berries, (2/3 C) sugar, a splash of water and (1/2 tsp) corn starch cooked over high heat and reduced to a thick sauce. Topp with whip cream...it's absolute heaven on earth!

Before making any recipe, I read the reviews first, I found that with a little extra flour, one less egg, some vanilla extract, and some coco powder, I got a perfectly acceptable after-college cake that I can snack on with my buddies ^^ it's a little on the heavy side, but that's good when you haven't eaten all day! Thanks for the recipe!!!

my husband is british and i've been trying to make that perfect sponge cake that he is so fond of. i have finally found the best recipe! i made this yesterday for a game night with my parents and my mom liked it so much she has asked me to make it for an upcoming family bbq and for the recipe! i made the following adjustments:
changed the temperature to 350 degrees; 
changed the bake time to 15 minutes; 
added about a tsp of almond extract

I used this recipe for the simple ingredients. It is a nice cake, but it was so hard and thick that I actually poured sweet milk over it to soften it up...otherwise the basic taste was nice

Great recipe though its kinda eggy.

First use four egg whites instead of egg 3 eggs, the yolk is the most eggy part, the fat content is also cut. Add like a teaspoon of vanilla extract as well.

After that whip the egg white slightly this will give a lighter  cake. When its baked immediately smear some good quality jam or add some fruit saauce this will moisen the cake so its not too dry and hides the eggyness too! haha. cream cheese and jam goes really well too.

I made this last night as a midnight snack for my sister and I and we loved it. I don't know if you other two people didn't make it right but mine was delicious. Next time though i'd add a little milk or something to make the cake a little more moist.

This recipe needs more than 3 ingredients in order to 'mask' the egginess. Vanilla helps, as does a caramelised apple base (like an upside down cake). On its own it's too plain and eggy.

It's good, but does make me think it could use more than 3 ingredients. It's great as a base to a bigger dessert/pudding, especially something quite sweet since it's not too sweet.

This recipe is indeed quite quick to whip together, but I found it to be a little too "eggy" in taste. Maybe I'll try adding a little vanilla extract to the batter next time.
