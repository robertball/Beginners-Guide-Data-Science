Great recipe! I had my doubts as I was putting it all together but it came out great. Only change I had made was to use fresh tomotaoes from the garden.

I must have done something wrong. I baked my bread for 1 hour 15 minutes. It was still gooey. It didn't have much flavor either. This may have been my fault though I forgot to put the garlic in. All I could really taste was the tomatoes. It was also a lot of work for quick bread. I probably will not make this again.

I just made this its a really good bread. I was looking for something to use up some tomatoes so I cooked mine down with some jalapeno peppers. It did seem like it needed more flavor. But all in all a good idea. Next time I will just add some hot sauce and extra garlic!!

I made these tonight as muffins instead of a loaf. The only other changes I made were to include 1 c. whole wheat flour Italian style stewed tomatoes a little less oil and no olives. Overall they weren't very flavorful which surprised me because I thought there were plenty of aromatics and other elements involved to make a good finished product. We just didn't care for them. They were very heavy in texture.

I left out the olives and increased the amount of milk since my tomatoes yielded less juice than what was called for. Turned out really good and went well with my Spicy Potato Soup II (also from this site). Thanks much!
