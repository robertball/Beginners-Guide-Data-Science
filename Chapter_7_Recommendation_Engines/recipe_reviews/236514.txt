I'm wondering where I went wrong!  This didn't work for us.  I followed the recipe---even setting aside the yolks (which could have helped in retrospect).  The flavors didn't come together for me, and so I'm glad that I made only a partial batch.  I hope someone else will make this to prove me wrong!

This is outstanding just as it is.  I made half exactly as recipe and then thought about the egg yolks..so I added them but in chunks and it was great also.   I will certainly make again
