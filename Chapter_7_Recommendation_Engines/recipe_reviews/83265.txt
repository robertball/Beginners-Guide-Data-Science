This is a delicious martini.  I would skip the dash of grenadine though as it is already a very sweet drink.  Also, the pineapple juice and melon liqueur alone make a nicer color.  For a different twist, substitute the regular vodka for coconut rum. So tasty and tropical!

This was very refreshing and had a nice "tropical" taste to it.  The grenadine gives it more of a tropical color as well.  Maybe add a pineapple spear garnish?

This martini is incredible.  I ended up putting three maraschino cherries  for the after drink treat (as if it needs to offer more!)

I almost didn't try this because I don't like martini's but when I read the ingredients I thought I'd give it a try.  It was pretty good but I love the Melonade recipe on this sight a lot more.

This drink was pretty darn good, but it's not really a martini.  More filler than liquor=mixed drink

I brought this to a martini party and it was a big hit, probably the most popular of the martini's. Had to give several people the recipe.
