If I could, I would give this recipe 6 stars.  It is wonderful.  Did not have fresh ginger, so used ground ginger.  Marinated about 6 hours and the T-Bone steaks were fork tender and great tasting - not sweet at all, as one might expect.  Just delicious grilled over medium heat charcoal to desired doneness.  Next I will try it with chicken and pork tenderloin - my family can't wait.  Thanks Doreen!

We LOVED IT! I have been making variations of this recipe for shish kabobs for about 10 years but never had an exact recipe until now, so it always tasted different. But this time my husband and I thought this recipe was the best one I had ever made. It called for vegetable oil, but I didn't have vegetable oil, we use olive oil for diet reasons, so used it and combined it with what safflower oil I had (canola would be equally good). Also didn't have fresh ginger but had ground ginger and put about the same amount of it as it called for the fresh. I marinated a cheap sirloin that I cut up in chunks for 2 hours or less. Other than that I followed the recipe to the "T". I can just imagine what it would have tasted like using fresh ginger. But had the ground ginger so opted for it. I also used the same recipe for the veggies (marinated them) that I skewered with the meat. They tasted wonderful too. Thank You Doreen! Will definitely use this recipe from now on! Will probably even try it on chicken!

We really enjoyed this marinade...even my picky husband said he'd like for me to keep this on file.  I used this on pork sirloin chops and let them marinate for 1-1/2 days.  I used about a tsp of granulated garlic since I didn't feel like chopping the real thing. I didn't have any honey, so I used brown sugar and my hubby informed me that he added some saki in there at some point.  My 16 month old had 2 helpings!!  I look forward to using this again. Thanks Doreen.

I too changed a few things, brown sugar instead of honey, balsamic vinegar, chopped onions and garlic cloves, half veg. oil, half olive oil.  Omitted Sherry altogether.  Marinated a large 7lb-8lb eye of round roast overnight and flipped it over in the morning.  Let it stand on counter til room temp. so it would cook evenly. Braised it all over on top of the stove, then Cooked at 375 degree oven at 20 mins. per pound. Put some Oil and water and Onions quartered in roaster and let it cook.  
I did not think I was going to like the roast because of the "smell" not sure if it was the soya sauce or ginger or both but it was awfully strong.  Anyway, cooked it like I said, and to my AMAZEMENT it was Moist and juicy, and probably one of the BEST roasts I've ever cooked.  For a cheap cut of meat, It very well could have been a Rump or Sirloin tip!!!!!
This was my first time marinating a Roast of Beef and would definately recommend it!!

This marinade is excellent!  We enjoyed it on our steak a lot.  

I wanted to share that this is also an INCREDIBLE marinade for ribs!  We were in heaven and will never have ribs any other way again.  I marinaded them in Doreens recipe for 5 hrs (next time, over night!) and then braised them in the marinade in the oven for 2hrs on 300 degrees, basting with the marinade every 30 minutes, before grilling with the BBQ sauce (honey BBQ goes fabulous with this marinade).

Thanks so much Doreen!

This marinade rocks!  I used it with steak and chicken, and both turned out awesome!  The first time I made it, I let the meat marinate overnight with great results.  The last time I made this I let the meat marinate for 48 hours, and the steak was incredible.  I would recommend cutting down on the amount of oil unless you have a really tough piece of meat!

This marinade is AWESOME!  I get rave reviews every time I marinate my steak in it.  It makes "just average" meat into "totally delectable" meat.  Wonderful.  Many thanks for this one!

My husband and I loved this recipe, but agreed we think it would be better on chicken.  It tastes very similar to Hawaiian style teriyaki.  I am going to make this again but use for chicken in the future.

Sometimes the combination of fresh ginger and soy sauce turns a dish completely "asian," but that wasn't the case here.  The NY Strip marinated for about 5 hours, and the flavor was outstanding.  Wouldn't change a thing; just follow the recipe (don't over marinate the meat), and you won't be disappointed.

Needed a quick last minute recipe, and I bumped into this one! It was great! We only marinaded it for 4hrs and it gave it a great taste. Next time overnight!

I did not have sherry or fresh ginger, so I asked for advice from my friends on my cooking forum. Based on their recommendations, here are my substitutions: I used merlot (all I had besides zinfandel) but added 2 t of brown sugar; I used teriyaki instead of soy sauce, because teriyaki is sweeter--again trying to counteract the sourness of the merlot; I used 1 t of ground ginger, but as my friends said, it lacked the punch of fresh. The result was still an outstanding marinade, creating very flavorful and tender rib eyes and T-bones. I will purchase the correct ingredients for next time and try this on other cuts of beef as well. Excellent recipe, Doreen.

An excellent marinade!  Our T-bone steaks were very tender and had a wonderful flavor. My husband must have said "mmm" a hundred times during dinner last night.  Thanks Doreen!

This was excellent. With tender steaks, I will eliminate the oil next time, in order to avoid grill flair-up.  But with a cheaper piece of meat, the oil would be needed to tenderize the meat.  Also used ground ginger rather than fresh and turned out ok.

Any recipe listing sherry as the first ingredient is a good one in my book, and this did not disappoint!  Loved this marinade.  I did use bottled Italian dressing in place of the oil, otherwise made as directed.  My new go-to marinade, thanks for sharing this with us.

My fiance loved this -- he would give it 5 stars! I tried to make it a little less sweet -- the honey made it sweeter than I expected (next time I'll use a little less). Didn't have sherry so used rice wine vinegar; added dash of worcestershire sauce, 2 extra garlic cloves, and a few dashes of Tabasco. The rib eye that marinated for 10 hours was delicious!

This was ok, nothing to write home about. There are several other marinades on this site that we like much better. We used this on strip steaks. We won't be making this again.

This was delicious. I defrosted two huge bone-in ribeyes in their Ziploc bag and just threw the marinade ingredients in the bag. No mess and cleanup. Used jarred fresh ground ginger (available in the produce section) and upped the honey a little bit. We only marinated for three hours and the steaks were fantastic. Very good recipe.

This is such a delicious marinade! I used it on a cheap cut of beef and it gave it such flavor. (I really think I should've marinated it longer, though ... but that was probably because of the cut of meat.) We are mushroom lovers, so I reserved about 1/4 cup of the marinade and used it to marinate 8 oz. of sliced fresh mushrooms. I sauteed them up and served them on the steak. Yummmmmmmmmm!

Awesome marinade! I grilled the marinated top sirloin on slow heat and the meat came out tenderized, flaky and with wonderful flavor. My guests all loved it. Thanks Doreen!

Very good. I rarely eat let alone make any kind of red meat, but my husband likes it so I gave this recipe a try. The steak (cooked on a gas grill) had a nice flavor and was very moist. I will definitely be using this recipe again.

I didn't have Sherry so I used port instead.  As well when once i completed marinading my steak I boiled the marinade on the stove and used it as a sauce.  My kids loved it that way.  The boiling kills any bacteria and is good for those who want a stronger flavor.

This marinade was good but it's basically a teriyaki recipe.  I made the mistake of using it on 4 beautiful home grown ribsteaks that my friend raised.  I would suggest to use a recipe like this on a cheaper steak like chuck or top round.

EXCELLENT!!! Five stars all the way. I have used this on a variety of items including chicken and pork, you can't go wrong and the guests loved it! The flavor is unbelievable. I always let it sit overnight, the longer the better.
Thank you for sharing this great recipe!

Wonderful marinade for London Broil!!  I marinaded the meat overnight, then broiled it to perfection.  Made wonderful steak sandwiches, with the extra marinade (simmered on the stove) as dipping sauce.  Yum!  Definately a keeper, if you like garlic & ginger!

I didn't care for the ginger taste, but that is just a taste preference.  Great base without the ginger to build on to suit your own taste buds.  I added some hot sauce and a little Mesquite liquid smoke.  I also added unseasoned meat tenderizer.  Use this base if you don't care for ginger and suit yourself with seasonings.  If you don't have honey, brown sugar works well also.  For all you ginger lovers out there, don't change a thing!

Can we say heavenly? Oh yum! Definently much better than store bought marinades. We ended up marinading ours overnight and all day and the steak was sooooo tender and full of flavor. We will definently be using this one again! Next time I might make some extra marinade to use as "steak sauce".

I had to change a couple things on this because I did not have it, instead of sherry I used rice vinager, and I left out the garlic. I marinated for almost 24 hours, and the flavor was awesome. I also boiled down the left over marinade and drizzled a bit over the top of the flank steaks that I used. I am actually going to use the rest of the sauce as a salad dressing! My husband said like 5 times how much he liked it. Thank you for the recipe, I will use it again.

This is a great recipe.  It gives such a rich taste to steak.  I made the recipe as stated, scaled down for a single serve.  I marindaded for a good 24 hours.  There was enough marinade at the end to make a glaze, this was perfect over steamed brocoli and baked potatoes. I used fillet beef today, but will definitely try it again with my favourite scotch fillet.

I used this marinade on two very thin and very expensive cuts of meat.  Marinated for two hours only do time constraints and cooked it on the George Foreman machine -- to get (most of)the oil out again.  Came out fine.  Does need to marinated longer but after cooking I put a tiny-bit of Egyptian mint sauce on top of the meat  (considering a little goes a long way!).  Very tasty.

Excellent flavor. I was only marinating one steak and just eyeballed equal parts. I’ll use a less than equal amount of soy sauce compared to other ingredients next time. While good, was on the verge of too salty.

Good flavor, easy and quick to put together.  Almost always have all ingredients on hand so that is a plus too.  I ended up marinating T-bones 24 hrs instead of 4 and they were really good!

Absolutely delicious.  I used this marinade for a London broil cut and marinaded it for 4 hours before grilling it.  The meat was very juicy and tender and the taste of the marinade permeated it without being overpowering. I added extra garlic since we love garlic.  I was out of cooking sherry so I substituted Cabernet but it was still very good.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I used this on Buffalo T-Bone Steaks.  They were tender and good - Didn't have sherry so I used red wine and added a little brown sugar.  Will use it again on all of my buffalo steaks.

I thought this recipe had potential, and my hubby certainly liked it. It was sort of missing something. Maybe it needed longer in the marinade, although I gave it 6 hours. Thanks anyway!

It was easy, flavorful, and different.  I used merlot instead of sherry, I added 2 t of brown sugar and marinaded it for at least 4-5 hours.  I also added more garlic to it.  I took the recommendation of another review and simmered the sauce and poured it over.  It was icing on the cake.  I would definitely use this one again for sure!  Thank you !!!

This is now the only way that my family will eat sirloin.  I usually only have merlot on hand, so I use that then add a bit more brown sugar and throw in a few red pepper flakes.  Awesome.

My family absolutely loves this marinade. My 10 year old daughter frequently requests steaks marinaded using this recipe.  I usually double the recipe though and it completely covers 4 steaks in a 9 x 13 dish.

This is a great and easy marinade. Anytime we bbq steaks, my husband always asks for "Doreen's Steak Marinade". My kids love it too.

I thought this was excellent (I dont give out 5 stars too easily!). I followed the recipe exactly, marinaded for 4 hours, and the steaks were delicious. I made it again and followed the recommendations of some on here and marinaded for 24 hours, but I felt the steaks had gone too sweet by that stage. I've since experimented with whiskey instead of sherry - it was fina also.

Oustanding marinade.  I only had time to marinade my steaks for an hour but the meat turned out amazingly delicious.
