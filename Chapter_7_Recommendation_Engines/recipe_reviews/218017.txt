I did not care for this cobbler recipe. I could not stir the 4C flour etc.  Not happy as I just lost 1/2# of butter along with all the other ingredients. Don't know if it was my mistake or the recipe it self.

The filling was wonderful! I found the dough/crust to be very thick and almost biscuit like. Next time I will use the filling recipe and find a thin, flaky crust recipe to use.

Very nice light biscuit cobbler, however, this was TOO much dough.  Half of the recipe would be ample.  I made the cobbler using peaches; also very good.

Made it according to the recipe followed the instructions to the tee, everyone loved it. Whike. the BlackBerries were thawing I caught the juice in a bowl, when I serve the cobbler I put A scoop of vanilla ice cream on top and then drizzled it with the juice from the berries, I had added a little sugar to it to make it a tad sweeter.
