This is one of those "keeper" recipes I've made over and over many times. I found l/4 c. flour added after you fry the onions and beef and continue to fry for about 3 min. (stirring constantly) will remove the raw flour taste in the finished product. Also, I heat the milk and add it a little at a time for desired consistentcy. The hot milk helps eliminate the "lumps" in the gravy. We like this over mashed potatoes.I also add some fresh garlic chopped to the onions.....pretty good.

I have trouble getting my college brothers to eat anything these days...they couldn't get enough of this recipe! I didn't have onions, except green ones, so used those; and added corn and golden mushroom soup to the meat mixture.

After reading other reviews, I changed it a bit by adding two beef bullion cubes, garlic salt, and Creole seasoning to the sauce, and about six small sliced boiled potatoes to the hamburger mixture.  Came out pretty good!

This is a quick easy meal when you are busy.  For those of you who found it to be bland try using cream of celery or cream of mushroom soup diluted with a little milk.  My family likes it with one of the cream soups.  Omit the onion if you wish.  It's something like the army s.o.s.

This recipe is one of my husband's favorites since we've been married, so I thought I should get around to saying so.  You can help boost the flavor a lot by adding Worchesteshire sauce and seasoned salt to the beef/onions while browning, and then adding more seasoned salt to taste once the gravy thickens.
Last time we added chopped green pepper to the beef/onion mix and it added some freshness - you can also use unfrozen peas instead of canned for fresher taste.    The gravy does take a while to thicken, but it's worth the wait - just keep stirring over med heat.  Thanks for posting this - it's an easy meal that makes great leftovers!

I'm sorry, but I didn't care much for this dish.  It didn't have very much flavor and I could really taste the flour used in it.

This is an excellent "comfort food" meal! It's quick and easy for a meal on the run..:) I recommend having it with homemade biscuits! Yum. I didn't have peas, so I used broccoli instead. Still delicious! Great job Granny!

For those of you who have found the receipe bland.... you need to make sure you are seasoning your beef as it cooks. I know the recipe doesn't say to but you should. You must cook your flour well. If you do not cook the flour in the butter long enough before you add the milk. You will taste the flour and the dish will be bland.

This recipe as is isn't bad for a quick meal when your pantry is bare. But to make it really delicious, make it the Army way, known as Army SOS: skip the peas and serve it on toast for breakfast, with a fried egg(optional) on top. Use Half and Half instead of regular milk and use beef boullion to taste instead of salt. Also add garlic and pepper to taste and don't drain the fat, as this will add flavor to the sauce. This meal, adapted from a Fort Knox mess hall recipe years ago is a tradition in our household each Christmas and Thanksgiving morning.

This recipe is nice when you just want to throw some things together on a semi busy week night.  However, I thought it was bland so I suggest adding various spices to it to increase the flavor.

I skipped the onions and peas cause I had neither- I added onion powder, garlic salt, a lot of salt and pepper and some crushed red pepper and served with corn. Ate over biscuits- perfect for winter comfort food. My whole family ate it up.

After browning the meat, I drained it and sauteed one small sweet onion and about eight ounces of fresh mushrooms in the butter before adding the flour. I did need a little more butter because mushrooms do tend to suck up liquids. For a creamier sauce, I used half whole milk/half evaporated milk. I omitted the peas only because noone in this house likes them. I served this over toast. Everyone liked it, especially me. Pure comfort food.

It was good but I changed a bunch of things that I think made it a lot better. First I used left over roast beef that I cross cut so it made short fibers. I also added 1 tsp each of salt, pepper and tarragon and used frozen mixed vegetables instead of just peas. I cut back the milk to 3 cups and used 3 T corn starch instead of all that flour to thicken it. The tarragon really adds a nice touch.

My family makes this under the recipe title "Ground Meat and Peas" and serves it over mashed potatoes or bread. Only we use far less milk and do not drain the peas.  This will increase the flavor quite a bit.  Also when it says add salt and pepper to taste, it should really read, add a 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp pepper, or more to taste.  You really need the pepper in this dish.  We love it!

Edible--but debatable.
No flavor, sauce was way too thick.  I suppose better than NOT having a meal--but I won't make again.

This was o.k.  It is a lot like a hamburger helper, which I do buy, but try not to since it has so much salt and preservatives.  So, on the upside this dish doesn't have all that "junk". but it is bland.  I did try adding some seasoning salt and Worcestershire too.  But, over all, it's easy and quick and does taste o.k.

This really brought back my childhood, my Dad made this when he was in the Navy, and for us as kids.  I added mushrooms and served it over sour cream and chive mashed potatoes!  Comfort food at it's best!!!

I'm not sure I've ever had this dish. It was just okay. As made, the sauce never thickened for me; but the reheated leftovers after refrigeration were much better in that respect. I also thought it wasn't nearly beefy enough; and the flavor was pretty bland. However, when served over toast it did cover all 4 food groups; that's why I was reminded of this being a school-cafeteria-style dish: pretty nutritious, but not all that flavorful.

Love this recipe - I did some alterations, about half the milk and flour, added some cayenne pepper to spice it up a bit. Then I spooned over egg noodles. I think next time, I will add some sour cream to the recipe and see how that works!

Taste good easy to make and can have it for left overs because it makes a lot. I ate mine over mashed potatoes for dinner and over bread for lunch the next day. Hubby loved it too.

My husband and I both liked this dish but we had it over buiscuts and skipped the peas.

Very easy to make and delicious. I used half milk and half half & half to make it even creamier. I also added shredded cheese. Yummy!

It was pretty easy, but I am not too keen on the peas and substituted it for sliced potatoes instead.

I used a can of cream of mushroom soup, 1/2 cup milk, and 1/4 cup sour cream. You gotta use frozen peas because they are much fresher than canned peas preserved in liquid . It was great  over toast and reminded me of when my mother used to use chipped beef (dried beef) to make similar dish.

The flour to fat ratio is wrong for a white sauce.  It should be 1:1... in other words, with the 1/4 cup of butter use 1/4 cup of flour.  I think you will find that the other cooks have made mention of this in their reviews.  1/4 cut of butter and 1/2 cup of flour and you are making a greasy floury paste.  Otherwise, this is a great recipe.  Can be cut back for smaller families by half but no smaller.  I'm not a huge pea fan either, so you can substitute what you like.  You can substitute about 1/4 of the milk with a beef broth of some sort, it doesn't matter how you get it, from cubes or out of the can.  Great on toasted bread or biscuits when it is cold outside.  Very warming.

This is the recipe my grandmother and mother used.   The peas were added when having it for dinner, and left out for breakfast or lunch.  We served over toast,  egg noodles or potatoes of any kind.  It was delicious back then and is still fantastic.  Thank you for bringing it back!  This is great with dried beef too!

I made a few small adjustments, like using corn starch instead of flour, and adding a little bit more milk.  it came out "creamier" with the corn starch and instead of being a soup like consistency is more like a chowder.  cut up potatoes would be GREAT inbit, but will do that on the next batch I make!!!

Made it last night; AMAZING!!   I grew up on creamed peas & toast and this brought me right back to those times with a kick.  Loved the addition of the beef!   I seasoned my beef before hand with onion, garlic, salt & pepper.   I also didn't have canned peas so I used frozen and enjoyed that burst of flavor.  Served with mashed potatoes and had enough leftovers for lunch today on toast.  This is a keeper and looking forward to making again!
