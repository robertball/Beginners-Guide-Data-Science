These turned out good.  To make things easier, I used some pesto I had in the Fridge.  Here's the modified recipe I came up with:  1 1/2 T. Prepared pesto 1/8 c. grated Parmesan 1/2 t. salt 1/4 t. garlic powder  Easy and yummy!

like Rachel, I used pesto I had already made and had in the refrigerator. I only added 1/2 tsp. salt. They made a great savory snack and I think they would also be AWESOME chopped and sprinkled on salad. My daughter is making them for my sister for an extra birthday gift.

These were delicious and a huge hit at my family's July 4th get together! A great way to use summertime basil from the garden. I will definitely make again.

Next time I will cut back on the Parmesan cheese, and add more basil. Good flavor, the cheese just took over.
