I, too, combined the feta with spinach prior to cooking, and it was great! I baked it in the oven, and topped it with the extra "stuffing".  Really delicious!

This was GREAT! I added artichokes and capers. I sauteed some garlic, wilted the spinach into the garlic, then added the articokes and capers and let it cook for about 3 minutes and then I stuffed it and the feta into the fish, and topped the fish with the rest of the mixture. I broiled it for about 10-15 minutes. It was absolutely amazing. Thanks for the great idea!

Like everyone else, I mixed the spinach and the feta together before stuffing.  I had a lot of stuffing left over so instead of grilling, I placed the steaks in a fish pan, topped with remaining stuffing, poured the remaining oil-lemon mixture of steaks, and baked on 350 for 15-20 minutes.  If I had some pine nuts on hand, I would have added them too.  Very easy prep and clean up,  Not the most amazing dish as far as flavor but will make again.

I'm new to the world of fish, and this was an amazingly easy and delicious meal.  My husband, who is the chef in our house was amazed by the meal!   Definitely a keeper!   I, too, mixed in the feta and made extra stuffing for the top.   -Highly recommend!   -Oh, I made it alongside the Asparagus, Feta and Couscous Salad recipe I found on this site... great pairing!

I just had this for dinner.  Having never made swordfish before, I opted not to stuff it and topped it with the spinach mixture instead.  Also, I added sun-dried tomatoes to the spinace/feta mixture, and it was sooooooo good.  Next time, I will stuff it.  I think the feta would add more flavor to the fish if it was stuffed inside.

Great recipe idea! I added chopped onion salt pepper and one egg so it was like a spinach spanikopita insert. We ended up broiling in oven and came out delicious!!! I will make again. Served with rice pilaf

EXCELLENT!  I made this as written and it turned out perfectly!  I did not stuff the swordfish, but made the stuffing and put it on top of the grilled fish.  I served it up with a variety of grilled vegetables with a Greek -style dressing.  So Good!  I will be making this again and again!

I was so glad to come across this recipe. I was looking for something new and different and this was it! The only thing I may try next time is to mix the feta cheese in with the spinach before stuffing the fish, but it was deliciouis the way it was. My kids (ages 8, 4, and 2) ate it like it was the best thing they ever had! Definatly a keeper!

This dish is delicious!!! We broiled the swordfish in our oven and it is easy to make.  The stuffing is tasty.  I recommend that you make a little extra and add the spinach mixture on top also.

This is fast and great tasting. My swordfish was too thin to stuff (about an inch) so I just made a bed out of the sutffing. Also instead of using a crumbled Feta, I used a creamy goat cheese (Laura Chenel Creamy Chevre) which has just the right amount of bite for the fish.

This was delicious!  I used a toaster oven at 300 F on broil for about 12 minutes.  I also sprinkled salt on the spinach and both sides of the swordfish.

From a Non "fish" person, we all loved it.  I did what everybody recommended and put the Feta with the veggies.  I didn't have spinach in my garden.I used Fresh chard from my garden and then even added some sundried tomatoes to the sauce along with chopped mushrooms, all cooked together.  With the leftover, I served it in a dish to put on top of fish.  I am in shock that the whole family LOVED it!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good and very easy.  Like the other reviewers, I recommend adding the feta to the spinach mix, and I also added some chopped kalamata olives.  And like the other reviewers, make extra spinach mixture and serve on top!

Great recipe, and very easy to vary depending on the ingredients you have on hand. For the stuffing, I used spinach, garlic and shredded gruyere cheese. Delicious.

This was excellent! It was my first attempt at preparing swordfish and the recipe was nearly fool proof. My only change is that I had to broil the fish (on low for 7 minutes on each side).  The reviews that suggested mixing the feta and spinach together before stuffing the fish and using the leftovers as a topping were spot on. Also the recipe also lends its self to personal additions like kalamata olives and/or artichoke. Yum!

I marinated the fish for a few hours in a zip lock bag with fresh lime juice,  garlic, & pepper. I combined a little of the marinade with olive oil to sauté the spinach with. I stuffed the fish with cooked spinach & feta cheese before baking in the oven. Placed the extra stuffing on top afterwards.  Wonderful!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe just didn't work for me. The spinach and feta are great flavors to the swordfish, but the stuffing part didn't work. I baked it and it didn't seem to bake evenly. I ate the bottom part with the stuffing, and that was tasty, so if I do this recipe again, I'll do the swordfish separate and finish off with the spinach-feta topping in the last few minutes of cooking.

Fantastic recipe, very easy to prepare.  I mixed the spinach and feta before stuffing into the steak.  I also prepared extra stuffing which I piled on top of the swordfish after it was done cooking.  Very delicious.

I used a kale, feta, carrot salad for the stuffing and baked at 350. The video recipe didn’t indicate how long to bake. I think I baked it 5 minutes too long. 15 minutes might be perfect.

This was quick and easy, but not much flavor.  I marinated it for a couple of hours and even added some spices, but i was not impressed.   The stuffing was delicious, but won't make it with swordfish again.

I also mixed the feta with the spinach and used the remaining spinach on top of the fish for serving.  Although I think this is a five star recipe, my husband said he thought the swordfish taste was overpowered by the spinach/feta taste, lowering it to four stars for him.

I grilled the swordfish on the BBQ. I put the spinach and feta mixture under the swordfish. It came out great.

I used swordfish bought frozen and in my freezer for about a year, made recipe as written and had a wonderful juicy and flavorful piece of fish! Next time I will add some pepper and maybe some diced tomatoes.Otherwise very delicious.

We made this recipe with swordfish AND tuna.  We, as many, mixed the spinach etc together prior to stuffing both of the fish.  We also added artichokes, capers, and used feta cheese with cranberries.  It was delicious!!  We would totally make this dish again but may add almond slivers to the dish to give it some "crunch".  Instead of grilling, we baked the fish.

I'm sorry I couldn't give this a higher rating like others did but I was not a big fan. I love most any fish but this didn't really have much flavor. Now I will say I baked the steaks after getting the idea from another reviewer. Middle of a Pittsburgh winter didn't allow me to fire up the grill. But I don't think that's what was missing. Wish I could give a suggestion but I haven't been able to put my finger on what was missing. Maybe a light sauce to drizzle over could have brought the flavor I was looking for. Easy enough of a recipe to attempt again and try to figure out the missing link.

I love this recipe!!  Sometimes I will add tomatoes and/or capers, depends i'm what I happen to have at the time.  I also sauté all the ingredients  first before I stuff the fish and I add salt and pepper to the lemon juice and olive oil before I brush the fish with it.  I have made this many times and will continue to do so!
