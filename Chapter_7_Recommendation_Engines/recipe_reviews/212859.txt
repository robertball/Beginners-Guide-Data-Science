I loved the idea of these - I love making paper snowflakes and thought they'd make awesome cookies for a gift basket.  They're a bit too delicate for gifting and no kidding do they take a long time.  The taste by itself is like a fried wonton wrapper but sprinkled with the powdered sugar and drizzled with honey they're crunchy and sweet. The dough was good to work with and folded/unfolded easily when cool and dusted w/flour. I won't make this again unless I make it a family event with lots of hands to help.  You'll probably have better luck with a good heavy rolling pin and practice with deep frying to golden perfection.

To speed this process along, I suggest using the  medal snowflake cookie cutout from William's-Sonoma :0)
