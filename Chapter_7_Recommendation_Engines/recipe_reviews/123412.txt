My son was doing "bears" at school (he's 3) and I sent the recipe with his teacher because she said she and the kids were going to make bear paws and I thought they would like this a little better.  They had a blast and my kid knew what to do so he was especially excited to be the helper.  It was so much fun we are going to make it again tomorrow when my 3 year old neice comes over for breakfast.  Thanks for the post...so much fun.

Keep in mind these are premade biscuits, and what a fun and easy way to make a toddler happy!  My 2 year old loved these.  I put them together and made sure they were secure, flipped them over, and brushed with butter instead of egg, then coated with the sugar mix.  I also used raisins instead of chips because i didn't have the mini ones and it was just as cute.

My 3 yr old son loved this! not only the eating it, but he loved making it too. We changed it slightly to make it a little more kid friendly. We ommitted the egg wash. instead we devided the buiscuit into circles rolled it into th cinn. sugar mix that I put into a bowl and then shaped each circle into the parts of the bear. It turned out wonderfully. We ran out of chocolate chips in the second batch we did so we used rasins instead, and that was a bigger hit than the chocolate chips. We had five left out of the two batches when our extended family left that day, and by morning my husband had ate three of the remaining. So it's really great for the big kids too!

I made these for my boys for breakfast this morning and they loved them. I didnt use canned biscuits though, I used the "kentucky biscuits" from here. Very cute!

These are adorable! I am always looking for recipes to try when my neice and nephew stay over and found these. They are so quick and easy to make to. I used a pair of sharp scissors and the pieces cut so easyily. One small can of biscuits, which is less than dollar, makes 3 with an extra biscuit left over as the recipe suggests. Instead of spraying the baking sheet I just lined it with parchment. When done, I realized I did not have the mini chocolate chips I thought I had. So, I cut raisins into a similar size and stuck those on while the biscuits were still warm. I might try to bake them directly on the dough next time, since they will not melt like chocolate chips. I look forward to making these again with my neice and nephew. Thank you!

Great idea!  I am always looking for a quick breakfast that my 3 and 6 yr. old will eat without arguing.  They both gobbled these up.  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to sprinkle all of the cinn./sugar mixture, but I did use it all and they turned out perfect

My grandsons loved these.  Ours looked more like Koala Bears.  I also put more sugar and cinnamon on them (at their request)  They are easy to make with very little time involved.  They had fun putting them together.  A great kid recipe!

Update: I have made these several times now, to the point where if my boys see me making a can of biscuits, I can't get away with regular biscuits. It has to be in the shape of teddy bears! Thanks for the great idea! Original review: This is such a cute idea! I am looking for fun, kid friendly recipes to make with my boys over Spring Break. Will update! (I am sure they will LOVE them!)

I didn't actually taste these, but the girls (7-9 years old)at my daughter's sleepover all loved them.  They had so much fun forming the bears (and other designs) and raved that it was the most fun they'd ever had at a sleepover.  Thanks for the cute idea.  It was a huge hit!

These were wonderful!  I used much more cinnamon (1 tsp.).  Next time, I will *heavily* add the cinnamon-sugar mixture to the biscuits, as that's what makes them sweet (plus, it bakes down on them).  I baked them on parchment paper, and they turned out beautifully.  Thanks for the recipe!
