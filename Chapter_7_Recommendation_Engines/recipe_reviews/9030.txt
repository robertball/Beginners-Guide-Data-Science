We have made this recipe so many times - it is simply delicious. I always bake it (375 - 35 min) and I use Kellog's Corn Flake crumb mixture (NOT the cereal - next to the bread crumbs in grocery store)instead of bread crumbs and the semi-sweet texture is marvelous and never soggy. Fresh dill and parsley are an absolute must - don't substitute! Very good with asparagus/hollandaise sauce as an accompaniment.

Wow - the stuffing is amazing...but it took me a few times to perfect this recipe.  

My trick was to flatten the chicken before cooking and be careful not too overcook or burn on the stove.  I pan-fried the chicken for approx. 5 min on each side over medium/high heat.  Next, I baked it in the oven on 350 for approx. 15-20 minutes until the chicken was done.   

I can't tell you how wonderful it is once it's done right.  But, it's not easy...you need to be patient.

pounded the chicken flat between plastic wrap, put dollop of filling in center and rolled up the chicken and secured with toothpick. brushed outside with olive oil and baked 350 for 1/2 hr. turned out great and topped with dill sprig for a nice presentation.

Great recipe.  Here's how I changed it to cut some fat and some cost.  I scaled the recipe for 6 servings and used a 6 oz. can of fancy white crabmeat which was less than $4 a can.  It worked really well.  I used neufactchel cream cheese which is lower fat but very good.  My boneless breasts were very big and meaty so I cut them in half and then sliced into them as directed for the pocket.  I used garlic and herb breadcrumbs instead of fresh. After I breaded them, I placed them into a large pan sprayed with cooking spray, drizzled a bit of olive oil over the top and baked for about 40 minutes at 375.  The result was very good.  Baking them reduces the fat and mess for easier clean up.

I made this recipe last night and it was a huge hit!  For the filling, I just coarsly chopped an onion, took a handful of fresh parsley and dill and the cream cheese and put it into my little mini-blender, which worked out really well because everything dissipated nicely. I also baked this, I didn't pan fry it. I put it in a 350 degree oven for a half hour and they turned out wonderful. I fully recommend this recipe! :)

Didn't change a thing with this recipe and it was wonderful just as written. I say, if it ain't broke, don't fix it! :) Loved just the simple flavors of the fresh herbs, which enhance rather than compete with the flavor of the crab.

This was good - and I baked it instead of Frying it. I baked it at 375 for about 40 minutes - couldn't have been better!

I loved this recipe!  I kept the chicken semi-frozen when I cut the chicken to form pockets.  The chicken then thawed and I stuffed the cream cheese & crab mixture (which I did double.)  I also browned the chicken for 5 minutes or so.  I then baked it on 350 until the juices ran clear.  This tasted fantastic!

I made this recipe for my parents' 50th anniversary party.  The recipe was good - a little too fishy for me (and I love crab), but everyone else raved about it.  I made the crab stuffing the night before - used chive cream cheese, flattened the chicken breast and sliced each breast so there was a pocket. I soaked the chicken in buttermilk the night before to help retain moistness.  The next day I dipped chicken in flour, egg and then panko bread crumbs (which hold up better).  I then browned each chicken breast in butter until a light golden brown, placed on paper towel until cool.  I then stuffed each chicken breast with the crab mixture, placed in a baking dish and in the oven at 350 for 35 mins.  I would recommend leaving in a little longer to ensure that the chicken is done.  It does need some kind of sauce on top - just not sure what....definitely not anything rich. I tried to make the blender hollandaise sauce from this site - but it came out horrible - i don't like serving anything with raw eggs in it.  If i make this chicken recipe again I will lighten up on the amount stuffing I used (I think I overstuffed and the fishy taste took over) and find a sauce that is not too heavy.  Overall the recipe was good - just needs some tweaking.  This could easily be made completely the night before or days before - just freeze and then thaw and reheat!  I'm all for making things ahead of time and then freezing.....especially when you are having a big party and

This was a good dish. Like other reviews I read, this dish needs a sauce. Im not a big fan of hollandaise sauce so I didnt want that. Also I added grated parmesan to my bread crumbs. Instead of frying it, I put it in the oven for 40 minutes @ 375 degrees. It came out perfect. I will definitely make this again.

This was very good, made it for my husbands Grandma - she raved! I did change a few things: I subbed in red pepper flavored cream cheese for the plain, I added a small amount of chopped mushroom to the filling, subbed small shrimp for the crab, and doubled up on the garlic. I made my filling in the morning so that it had a good 5 hours to blend before I stuffed the chicken. I also did not bread my chicken I wrapped it with a thick cut piece of bacon and browned off the chicken in a frying pan with lemon pepper sprinkled on, and then finished it on a cookie sheet on the BBQ at 350. My only complaint is that I found that the filling was a bit dry, I wanted it a bit more moist so next time I am going to add some ricotta to the filling.

I tried the oven method that was recommended and was disappointed.  This recipe was boring and bland.  Not for someone who cooks and experiments a lot.

4.5 - Good way to use up extra crabmeat. I did go a little heavy with the seasonings as it seemed to need it to suit our tastes. I used pretty large chicken breasts and baked them for about 45 min. at 375*. The recipe is very good as is but we also liked it with a little hollandaise sauce over the top. Served with parmesan risotto and steamed broccoli.

This was awesome!!! I did make a few changes tho... instead of putting minced onion in the filling, I crushed up the fried onions in the can and coated my chicken with that. I used canned crab meat and I also baked in the oven covered on 350 for about 35 mins. I also doubled the filling recipe just because I had such huge chicken breasts. Will be making this again and again!!! Thanks for the recipe :)

Sadly, these did not get eaten. There was little flavor to the stuffing and I think the whole deal needed some sort of sauce.

I added minced garlic and various other spices to the stuffing mixture.  I think the easiest way to stuff chicken breasts is: butterfly it, place stuffing one one side, wrap other side around stuffing, pull up edges and toothipick in place. I then did a light shake in bread crumbs. I baked the chicken in a pam-coated 9-inch baking pan, with a little bit of olive oil drizzled over, for about 30 minutes at 375 degrees.  I also used the recipe 'Cheese Sauce Over Cauliflower' that I put on top of aspargus and broccoli. [the leftover cheese sauce I used the next night in mashed potatoes-yummy!]  My boyfriend gobbled up, and I must admit I did too.  It is absolutely delicious, and I will definately make it again. Yummy*

I made this last night, and my husband immediately gave it a "6 out of 5".  I used onion and chive flavored cream cheese and added crumbled bacon to the stuffing mix... Then browned the chicken in the skillet on both sides as the recipe stated (only for a few minutes per side), then stuck them in the oven at 375 for 30 minutes!  PERFECTION!!! Also, had extra stuffing so I spread it on top of the breasts before baking them, then topped them off with a drizzle of hollandaise sauce and asparagus on the side.  This is going in the "favorites" recipe box!!!!!

The family loves crab, so this recipe caught my eye. I'm glad it did. It was delicious! I doubled the amount of crab in the mixture, added panko crumbs to it, to give it some body, then rolled the breasts in more panko. I browned them in the fry pan, but finished by baking them in the oven. This kept the crispy outside and the stuffing like texture on the inside.

Wasn't really impressed with this. Taste to fishy and I love seafood. I know it wasn't my crab because i used fresh and Had some left over that I used in eggs with old bay and it taste perfect. I'll stick with stuffing my chicken with Swiss and ham. Thanks anyway.

Simple and uncomplicated, yet producing an outcome with fantastic flavor. The only thing I would add is to be sure and gently pound the chicken breasts to an even thickness, if necessary, for even cooking.

Okay...so I had to use what was on-hand cuz we are moving soon and I am trying to clean out the perishables. I didn't have regular cream cheese, I had the Garden Veggie flavor...and I didn't have the fresh spices, so I used dried...and no dill, so I left it out. My hubby had packed the flour, so I used Bisquick...and my son is allergic to eggs, so I used an applesauce/milk mixture. I also used the recommendation of baking so as not to burn it on the stove top.

And even though I basically created a new recipe...THIS WAS AWESOME!!! We ate so much we hurt! This is our new favorite chicken recipe...and SOOOOO easy...which is hard to believe when you taste it! Truly delicious!!!

Super tasty!  I ended up taking out the wrong pack of chicken that only had 2 breasts, but after flattening them and rolling them with the filling there ws enough for 4 servings.  The filling is wonderful.  My only complaint is that I wanted more filling in my chicken!  Next time I will double the filling and keep the chicken the same.

This was a over the top 5 star rating. I did double the crab mixture and the used garlic & herb breadcrumbs, which you can buy in the grocery store. I also used garlic and chive cream cheese. I also found it helpful to brown the sides of the chicken in the skillet and then bake it for approximately 20 mins. or until the liquid runs clear from the chicken.

Very good! I baked mine at 375 for 45 min. So i didn't use flour and instead of fresh bread crumbs used store bought italian seasoned bread crumbs. Very moist and good flavor my four year old even loved it.

This recipe (plus minced garlic in cream cheese/crab part) has been in my family for years!  It's an absolute favorite.  I don't brown the chicken on the stove top though, I bread it using panko crumbs then bake (covered) for 45 minutes.  Delicious - will make you never want to order (and pay the steep price) for crab stuffed chicken in restaurants!  PS - do yourself a favor and don't use imitation crab meat - the REAL stuff is only $5 for 8 oz, and soooo worth it!!!!!!

I liked this recipe the flavor was good.  I'm not sure about chicken and crab as my favorite flavour combination but that's just personal taste!

A big hit with kids and DH.  Used canned crab and it was good.  Get thick breasts to split open or pound thins ones out and roll up instead.  Keeps well as leftovers.  Use any extra filling as warm crab dip with chips.  Yum.

Pleasantly surprised by this recipe! I was a bit worried while it was cooking because I used extra large breasts, and had to cook them awhile in the oven (45 min at 375) to make sure they were cooked all the way through, but they turned out excellent.  I had to make a few substitutions because I lacked some ingredients--I used crushed Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs, and used rosemary instead of dill.  I also doubled the entire recipe because 4 chicken breasts don't last very long in our family!!  Very pleased, will make this again soon.

Great recipe, but I browned each side of the chicken and then baked it in a dish with a rice/cream of mushroom/milk combo!  Makes for a really easy meal!

I thought this recipe was great! So did my family. I used imitation crab instead but you couldn't even taste the difference. I will definitely be making this again.

WINNER!!!!  Don't skimp on the crab, imitation isn't the same. Everyone said to make extra stuffing next time. Add some salt. Definitely (sp) going on the menu!!!

Delicious!  My whole family loved.  I agree with another reviewer that using fresh dill & fresh parsley makes a huge difference.  I browned the chicken and then I baked at 350 for a half hour.  Very juicy.  Thanks Holly

This was excellent!  The chicken got brown before it was cooked through so I put it in the oven in a iron skillet with the lid on for about 25 minutes.  It was very moist and juicy.  I used the imitation crab meat.

This recipe was great. I baked the chicken in the oven like other users had and it turned out gourmet. My boyfriend just raved about it. Next time I'll try and find a sauce to go with it because it's good but could use something so it's not so dry. It really did taste fabulous and worth it!

I've never had success with breading ANYTHING, but this recipe turned out exactly as it was supposed to.  Plus...it was DELICIOUS!  The only area I had trouble with was making pockets in the chicken breasts.  I ended up trimming them flat, puttin the filling on top, and folding them over instead.  This worked just as well.

This recipe was delish! I tweaked it a little bit by using onion and chives cream cheese,  lots of minced garlic, dried parsley, and black pepper since I didn't have lemon pepper. I butterflied the chicken since I used tenderloins which are smaller than breasts. I found it easier to stuff them. I created a sauce that I tend to use for another recipe which was cream of chicken soup, 1/4 c of water, 1/4 c of milk and 1/8 tsp of ginger. I made buttered thin spaghetti with peas for my side. I will definitely be making again!!

I would not make this again the stuffing wasn't that good probably just me but i wasn't impressed with the taste. The Crab was overwhelming and that's all you could taste other then that it was a pretty messy process. The chicken cooked okay but it probably would have been better if it was baked.

Made this for Christmas Eve. It was excellent.
I mixed panko with garlic and herb breadcrumbs. Browned in frying pan and then finished in the oven.  Everyone loved it.  I would definitely make it again! Crab is not cheap but worth the price. Bravo!

I could not believe only 3oz of cream cheese......too fishy for me, so I used 8 oz and kept everything elese the same for the filling = filling was perfect.  had left over and ate with crackers. I used ritz crackers and baked 375 40 min (with small tabs of butter on top of chicken - to brown).   Was overall good / different, will probably make again?  The crab dip is a keeper with the 8 0z cream cheese

Had them over the weekend with stuffed mushrooms and everyone loved them.  They turned out perfect.  Maybe 1 Tbsp of oil.  But they were great!

I just made this tonight and it was awesome!!!! I love how the flavors went together so well, it was so scrumptious! I did bake it rather than fry it simply because I'm not big on frying things, but it turned out so good! I will definitely be making this again! Thanks!

I always love to find new ways to cook chicken breast so I was very anxious to try this recipe! I did use canned immitation crab rather then fresh, just to make the meal more affordable. I thought it still added great flavor and texture to the recipe. Also instead of bread crumbs, I used crushed up cornflakes - It made it crispier! I can't wait to make this simple and yummy recipe again!

An okay recipe.  I found that the chicken only needed to be browned in a skillet and finished up in the over; 350 for about 15-18 minutes.

This is a great recipe to jump off from.  I don't bread the chicken because it's flavorful enough and it doesn't need it.  The stuffing is great and it's always an easy gourmet tasting meal for my East Coast boyfriend.  Any vegie side is perfect next to it.  With such a rich filling, the sides should be more crisp and green.

SOOOO GOOOODD!! I expected this recipe to have a strong seafood taste or to much cream cheese...But it was AWESOME. Crab was enough to taste and the cream cheese made the chicken juice and have a sweet taste. Nothing I expected...It was sooo very good for something new!!

This was quite good. Next time, I would add some seasoning to either the breadcrumbs or chicken. The stuffing was great. I didn't use anywhere near the 3 cups of bread crumbs it called for. We really enjoyed it and I would make this for company anytime and feel confident it would be a success.

This was very good. I substituted crushed rosemary & olive oil crackers for the bread crumbs (only because I didn't have any bread crumbs!) and used canned crab meat.  Yummy! and easy. It was a winner and very "gourmet". I'm headed to visit my daugher and son-in-law this weekend and going to prepare for them...I'm going to impress them!

I would give one, but gave two because it is kinda my fault!  I am in the middle of making this dish - and haven't tried it yet -so I will come back and edit, but I am so upset!  I sauteed the breasts for 10 minutes on both sides like the directions said.....not even CLOSE to done and the crust is getting burnt!!!!
And I pounded my breasts thin!!!  But I just read other reviews and see that I should have pan-fried for a few and then baked.....so after I already cut one up, I put them all in the oven -where they are now. grrrrrr and all of my sides are ready! and the crust is burnt a little!! I'll come back and edit after dinner.

OK, I'm back. I changed it to 3 stars because it was still pretty tasty.  The chicken was a little dry and tasteless in parts and the "burnt" crust was annoying.  I won't throw the recipe away. I will try it again and follow the other reviews before I judge for good!

i love this! i am actually eating it right now. despite what others have said, i thought this was as simple as it gets. i usually flatten and roll the chicken breasts, but i was short on time today and did it the way the recipe calls.  i cant wait for my boyfriend to come home tonight and try it. this recie i will definatly share with friends. its simple, yet elegant, perfect for company and oh so yummy. i did though add baby bella's and baked it in butter. ha ha i cant say it enough how great this is.

5 stars for sure. First I marinated my chicken(5 breasts) in buttermilk for a few hours as I do with all my chicken(1cup milk 1 TBS vinegar or lemon juice if no buttermilk) for that extra moistness.  The fresh crumbs..I used 5 pieces day old bread, with 6-8 ritz crackers, fresh parsley and basil and blended it all up.  Soo yummy.  I did add grated lemon rind and paprika to the filling and talk about good..MMMMMM.  I did brown the chicken till just brown and then baked 350 for 25-30 minutes.  I topped with Blender Hollandaise Sauce from this site.  Restaurant quality for sure.  The filling alone is to die for!  Thanks!!!

Pretty tasty, but I do agree with the others that state this needs a bit more seasoning. I used a good canned crab from Trader Joe's and a fat free cream cheese for the filling. I also baked this. I do think next time I might brine the chicken breasts a bit before filling and baking. The filling is very tasty and would be fun to play around with different combinations/additions,, sun dried tomatoes, spinach, garlic, mushrooms.. etc

This was delicious! We sprinkled a little lemon pepper and dill on the chicken and broiled it. The chicken itself came out a little dry, but otherwise very tastey. (: A lot of fun to make, as well. We didn't have enough crabmeat, though. We used live crabs, boiled them and shelled them. Also, we didn't have fresh dill so we used one teaspoon of dry dill from the spice rack. Came out delicious. Next time we are going to try different spices in the filling.

Today I have some chicken breasts and thought of this recipe which I've made before.(I forgot to review it!) It's a great recipe, my family enjoyed it, and as I said, I thought of it when I had some chicken breasts on hand(but no crabmeat... off to the store)!

Great Recipe, prep time was a little long for those of us on a tight schedule. I tweaked the crabmeat filling a bit, with basil, sherry peppers and creole seasoning and substituted Maryland Backfin crab. I also went with the recommendations of other people to bake it instead of the saute method. My husband loved it!! This one is a keeper for the file! Has anyone made this ahead of time? Does it freeze/cook well? Thanks.

I did everything according to the recipe, except I fry mines and then put it in the oven for 15mins to 20mins and poured some cream of broccoli over the chicken and let it smoother for about ten mins.

We LOVED this! The filling was awesome! I did season the breading w/garlic salt & pepper(& used dry bread crumbs vs fresh). Next time I may just bake it in the oven because I could not get my chicken to cook thru in the skillet without burning the breading(had to put it in the oven for about 10 min to cook thru). Thank you!

Fairly easy for this novice cook.   I would HIGHLY recommend using toothpicks to hold the pockets closed before attempting to bread. I followed the recipe exactly, but baked it at 350 for 40 minutes. Chicken tastes a little bland, but I am not sure on how to spice it up a bit.

Excellent!  I had to change the cooking procedure because after I had already started frying, my guest was running almost an hour late, so I quickly browned, and into the oven at 275 for about a little over an half hour.  The stuffing was WONDERFUL, even though I had to substitute surimi (imitation crab).  I don't think I'll change it because when I have real crab in my house it's going directly to my mouth with nothing touching it but butter.  :)

I made this for the first time ever! My daughter who is not a chicken eater LOVED it as well as the rest of the fam. Will do again and again!! Just the way it says, although I added a pinch or two of old bay seasoning.

This was much easier to make than I thought it would be.  I pounded the chicken before slicing the pockets and baked it instead of frying.  I topped it with hollandaise sauce and served it with asparagus.  I omitted the onions because my dining guest was not fond of them. The only change I might make is using panko bread crumbs instead of the regular stuff.

Turned out GREAT!  I used king crab meat and Tofutti Herb & Chive instead of cream cheese (milk allergy).  I about doubled the crab and "cream cheese" than the recipe says to make more filling, which was a little too much to fit into the chicken but gave extra for serving/eating.  I will definitely be making this again.

I tried this baked in the oven so it was a little dry. Stuffing was a little thick, could have used some liquidity like a little milk or cheese. I used imitation crab meat and it was pretty yummy adding a mild seafood flavor without overpowering. Added the hollendaise sauce and it was great! Will definately make this again, but definately in the skillet!

Excellent!  Way to much stuffing so I had an over flow but I cooked white rice and the over flow went onto the rice.  Big hit with my family except my fussy eater who at this time is very hard to please.

I thought this was all right/bleh. I think I'd like a different filling better, not the crab-dill mushy stuff. I don't plan on making it again - the leftovers just sat in my fridge and finally got tossed.

I also pounded the breasts flat.  Perhaps too much, so be careful.  I skipped rolling it in flour and simply dipped the stuffed breast in egg and then an Italian bread crumb mix from the store.  I too browned each side in a skillet for 5 minutes per side and baked about 12 minutes.  Yummy.

Yummm....forget the chicken!  This crabmeat stuffing is wonderful.  Next time, I'll try using it with white fish instead of chicken.  I also baked it instead of frying.  A bed of cooked spinach greens and lemen juice would top it off perfectally.

This chicken was delicious! Very rich, so I made it with plain white rice livened up with parsley, and just barely cooked fresh sugar snap peas. Made for a wonderful and diversely textured evening supper.

Delicious and pretty easy. I used canned chunk crab meat instead of fresh dungeness . I also used two tsp. garlic and 1/4 tsp. lemmon pepper. Turned out great!

This is one of my families favorites.  Even my 7yr old likes it.  I used fat free cream cheese once and it gave it a strange taste.  I will stick with regular c. cheese from now on.

This was good,  But I had difficulty stuffing the chicken,  So I flattened the chicken breast, and rolled the stuffing in the middle.  After frying, I put in oven with chedder cheese on top, and melted it.  This added some more flavor.

My husband loved this recipe.  I made a special dinner for him and he thought it was fabulous.  I did have a little trouble with the blackened breading, but I have a gas stove, so the heat was likely too high.  I don't think I made the pockets big enough either-but all the same, my husband really enjoyed it! (i don't eat crab myself, so I can't say)

Everybody ate it, but I thought the chicken turned out very dry.  The crab meat gave it a good different taste.  Next time I may cook in oven instead of on top of stove.

Great main dish, I made a few modifications:
1. Added smoked guyrere, havarti, and mozzarella  cheeses
2. removed cream cheese
3. removed dill
4. used lump crab meat
5. added spinach
6. used olive oil instead of butter, even though I am a butter fiend...
Result were very tasty, the cheese mixes were delightful and went well with the crab and chicken.  I would make this again!

I made the following changes to the filling: I used 8 oz. of  Greek Cream Cheese and Yogurt, 1/2 c. of Plain Yogurt, 1 finely chopped Jal. (next time I will use one more), 1 t. Lemon Pepper, 1 t. or so of Old Bay, and more garlic.  The breading I made the following changes:  combined Panko bread crumbs, Old Bay, Garlic,  Parm. and Oil.   Coated the Chicken in that, put in oven for approx. 40 min.  This was amazing.  I had extra filling and we used it as a dip for crackers.  I did make a cheese sauce, it was good either way.

Made this for the family tonight, will not make again.  Made recipe as indicated and added shredded parmesian cheese to breading and it was very bland.  Also it didn't make enough filling for the chicken breasts that I had (which were pretty big). I'm from Maryland so I should have known to use Old Bay and Horseradish in the filling instead of dill and lemon pepper.

I love this recipe, next time I will leave out the dill weed and try to find another alternative to frying. The bread crumbs burnt up quick and i would use smaller chicken breast.  Big chicken breasts take away from the filling and take longer to cook.

Absolutely delicious! The only thing I have to say is that the pan frying was not enough. The chicken was still raw in the middle even after 25 minutes of flipping to all the sides.. I had to finish it up in the oven, which is what I will be doing next time.

Used some modifications from other comments, including seasoning the chicken.  I also did not saute my chicken at all, just baked - convection 350 degrees for about 30 mins.  Very tasty recipe!

This was pretty good.  I made the recipe as written w/ the exception of browning them in the pan, then transfering to a baking sheet and finishing them off in a 350 oven for 25 min.   Be sure to season the breasts and/or flour w/ salt & pepper.

Excellent even without the dill. I added poultry seasoning into the crabmeat mixture too. Oh, and I was out of regular bread, so I crumbled hot dog buns...made an interesting crust.

I've loved every stuffed chicken breast recipe I've tried off this site so far.  This was really good, but I could have used more of the crabmeat filling, maybe my chicken breasts were too big.  Very easy to make and so yummy.

This did not turn out well for me at all. The chicken never cooked through, the outer portion turned black in the skillet and the inner portion was completely uncooked. I will be baking them next time & I think I will need to pound them thinner and try again. It would have had a good flavor if it had cooked!

Very, very delicious!!  Not oily from sauteing.  Very impressed.  A definite guest pleaser!  Reheats well in a toaster oven.  DELICIOUS!!
