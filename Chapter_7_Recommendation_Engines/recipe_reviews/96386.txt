I really liked this recipe.  I would have never thought of using turkey cutlets for a "Piccata", but it was both healthy and delicious.  Consider adding capers as well, that would be tasty.  Good with asparagus or garlic sauteed spinach as a side.

This is very good, I use it on any turkey or chicken... haven't tried it on pork yet.
