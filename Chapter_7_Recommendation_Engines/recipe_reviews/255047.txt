Excellent!  I've never cooked with tarragon or cardamom before.  The cardamom is sweet which compliments the sweet potato.  I used 1 medium zucchini instead of eggplant and regular flour.  The kids questioned the texture of the 'cheese' but both kids liked the dish.  Will be making again.

I was a little skeptical of the nut flour-based roux, but it worked! I thought this was really, really tasty. Would definitely make again.

This was delicious.. my only change was the flour types. I did not have either so I used quinoa and rice flour. not paleo, I know. The spiralizing on the sweet potato was a bit of a pain so I might just try chopping this up next time..
