Excellent combination of flavors! Due to availability, I subbed crab for lobster, watercress for mizuna, and oyster mushrooms for enoki. I used wakame and arame for sea veggies; hijiki and dulse would work well also. The mint was a nice touch, and the coulis whipped up nice and creamy--and so flavorful for such simple ingredients! These were surprisingly easy to put together, but I found 30 sec for soaking the rice paper was way too long; about 10 worked for me. You could also toss everything together in a salad if you don't want to use the wraps. Delicious!

This is an excellent recipe.  I used shrimp instead of lobster, lobster mushrooms and I couldn't find "sea vegetables" so I omitted them altogether.  The coulis is out of this world!  I'm going to use this recipe again as soon as possible.

I actually had to add mor mango because the sauce had too strong of an olive oil flavor. I used champagne mangos so I used 3. My store had no enoki mushrooms so I used baby Shitaki that I sautéed in some butter, seasoned salt and lime juice. I also used shrimp for mine but langoustine lobsters for my son and husband. I sautéed them in the same mixture as my mushrooms. They loved it and so I!!

So far, I have found only dried sea vegetables, so I omitted them. Other than that, I prepared the rolls exactly as written using grilled lobster tails. I served them with a side of deli-made seaweed (fresh sea veggies are around here somewhere!) and sushi tuna salad. When I find a sea veggie source, we'll make them again. They are delicious.
