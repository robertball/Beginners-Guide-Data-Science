Wonderful!  Very easy to make, too.  Because the recipe calls for cooked shrimp, I think next time I will add them at the very end -- by the time the sauce thickened, the shrimp were overcooked.  I added 1/2 tsp. salt, and although pepper wasn't called for, I added 1/4 tsp. pepper - would keep those additions the same next time.  I also used fat-free half-and-half + 1 1/2 Tbl. cornstarch to thicken.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this last night, but changed a few things, added saute mushrooms, which I added 6 chopped cloves of garlic, fresh parsley, before adding it to the sauce, also used 1 cup grated cheese and half and half. Added shrimp last just before sauce thickened. It was so good hubby asked me to make it again soon!  A keeper!

This was very good and quick!  I doubled the parmesan cheese and added chopped broccoli. If your sauce takes too long to thicken, remove from heat.  It thickened in 2 minutes off the heat. This is a keeper!

Luckily, I listened to another reviewer's advice; 1lb of noodles is way too much!  I used only half of the package for the amount of sauce made.  Also, I made sure to remove the shrimp before making the sauce to avoid it being overcooked.  It was delish!

I made this for my mom's birhtday and everyone loved it, all 15 guests!!! I took the advise of others and doubled the ingredients for the sauce and added the shrimp at the end so it wouldn't be overcooked. I'll definetely keep making this instead of buying canned alfredo sauce!

This is wonderful as written.  It does take a little while to thicken.  I am constantly amazed at people who rate a dish when they have completely changed the ingredients and measurements.  It changes the whole recipe.  Submit your own version instead of rating one that is so totally altered!

Excellent recipe! Of all the search results that came up for this dish, I chose this one because it had the best nutritional data. It was VERY easy and quick to prepare but most of all, had GREAT (resturant quality)flavor. I will definitely add it to my list of personal favorites.

This recipe is so simple and produces a great meal. I didn't add cornstarch or flower; instead I simply reduced the sauce until the consistency was right. It too an additional 20 minutes, but it was worth it!

I read the other reviews that said it needed the sauce doubled so here's what I did *made it tonight- YUM*
1) Started the water for the pasta.
2) 1 full bulb of garlic diced fine into 1 small saucepan with about 1 tablespoon of butter. Let that saute on medium until the butter melts and added about 1 teaspoon of lemon juice. Then I took 1lb of cooked shrimp(thawed) and put it in a bowl. I poured the garlic butter mixture over top and mixed. Let it sit room temp until needed later.
3)In the original saucepan that I made the garlic butter mixture in, I added 8 oz of half and half and slowly poured in 6 oz san giorgio parmesan romano cheese stirring constantly on medium heat. By this time, the pasta was ready to be added. After about 5 minutes, taste the sauce. You can add a bit of milk if it's too cheesy tasting. At this time, I turned the heat off and it started to thicken instantly, I kept stirring until it was perfectly smooth.
4) Then in another larger pan, I added a 8oz pack of bella mushrooms, about 1/2 tablespoon of butter, a packet of steamed broccoli, and the shrimp with the garlic butter mixture. I left that on low/med heat and stirred until everything warmed up. Then I covered it and turned it to low.
By cooking it all in that order listed, everything was done at the same time. 
5) Then I tossed the shrimp/veggie mix with the pasta, then poured about 1/2 the sauce over everything. I ended up with extra plain sauce but I'm going to use it for lunch tomorrow- PERFECT!

Suace really never thickened after quite a few minutes.  Taste was great.  Consistency of sauce was a little too runny.

Super easy recipe! I didn't have half and half so I had to use regular milk. Which led to other problems. Since I didn't use half and half the sauce didn't thicken. Since the sauce didn't thicken, I had to add cornstarch. Since I had to add cornstarch, it had a funny taste. Since it had a funny taste, nobody really liked it. Since nobody like it, I had to eat the whole pan (ugh). since I had to eat the whole pan, I am now sick. Anyway, overall this is a brilliant recipe. Conclusion: don't make the same mistake I did: follow the recipe exactly.

I just saw the recipe in my email and came to check it out., Sounds lovely Mamatiff!  I have to add that the previous person to rate mentioned reserving some of the pasta water....ALWAYS do this with any pasta and sauce dish! You will be very pleased not having your sauce pool in the bottom of the pot or plate. It will amaze you, it is a trick I learned a long time ago and always pass on especially to newbie chefs!  Bon Appetit

I believe that the peeled and deveined shrimp called for in this recipe should be uncooked not cooked.  By the time the sauce thickens previously cooked shrimp would be very overdone and rubbery.  Lately I have become a huge fan of the flavor and texture of roasted shrimp so I rubbed my large (21 to 30 count) shrimp with a little olive oil, kosher salt, and pepper and roasted them in a 400 degree oven for about 5 to 6 minutes, until pink, firm, and cooked through.  After the sauce had thickened I added the shrimp to the pan along with blanched fresh broccoli and heated it through.  I had to sub ½ pound whole wheat angel hair for the fettuccine and thought that the sauce to pasta ratio was perfect.  I will keep this recipe on tap for last minute dinner guests; it was quite good and very quick!

Great as is!  I made this on a whim and definitely did not have any leftovers.  The amount of tweaking is limited only to your imagination.  I would personally add some pepper flakes to add a little heat.

Am I the only lazy bum who used a jar of prepared alfredo sauce?  (I didn't read all 276 reviews.)  It was very good.  I also used only half a pound of fettucine, while keeping the other proportions the same.  Thank you for the recipe.  :-)

The flavour was good but it took too long to thicken. I like to double the cheese to help thicken the sauce quicker. I also recommend cooking the shrimp & garlic in butter first and then removing the shrimp and setting it aside (it gets tough if cooked for a long time in the sauce). Proceed adding the half & half and the cheese (or more) to thicken the sauce faster. When thickened, add remaining ingredients along with the shrimp and the shrimp won't be so tough and overcooked.

I've made this recipe for years.  It's the BEST.  But. . . I always double the sauce.  I use fat-free half-n-half.

This recipe was really good. The ONLY thing I have to complain about is that there wasn't enough sauce. The sauce thickened up nicely but when I poured it onto my noodles, they got really sticky and were super dry...all the sauce was gone. So next time I will definitely double the sauce ingredients. Thanks!

Great recipe, I doubled the sauce, used 1 pound of pasta, added shrimp last. I also added 1 8oz pkg of cream cheese to help thicken the sauce, didnt have to cook it so long that way and it made the sauce really creamy. Everyone loved it.

Great Recipe..My tweaks?  I added 1 inch chicken cubes, and sauteed in garlic and onion paste with a tad bit of white cooking wine...I removed the chicken and shrimp from the fan and used the remaining juices to make the sauce!! In another non stick pan I sauteed mushrooms and broccoli and combined all ingredients into the sauce and let it simmer for about 5-10 mins.. WOWWWW!!

If you take out the shrimp this is pretty much the recipe that I used to make in grad-school whenever I had guests. It was easy to make in my dorm room; all I needed was a blender and a hot plate.

I thought that this was a really great recipe!!!!  Although I did make a few changes... i used olive oil to saute the shrimp and garlic along with the  onions and green/red peppers I added.. I actually used 5 cloves of garlic and didnt use salt and pepper..I used creole seasoning to taste instead.  After the sauce thinckened I added some green onions and sprinkled some shredded chedder cheese..

Half-and-half is a homogenized dairy product which is 1/2 whole milk and 1/2 cream.  It is usually used as a lower fat substitute for heavy cream in recipes that do not require whipping the cream, as in a dessert.  I guess you save some fat calories over the full fat cream and the taste is nice and rich.  We Americans also use it as a coffee creamer.

I made this recipe and followed the directions exactly! It turned out great, but it wasn't as creamy as I would have liked it to be! Once I mixed the shrimp & alfredo sauce with the fettucine, the sauce went straight to the bottom of the pot.  Also, it wasn't enough sauce for the fettucine and shrimp mixture and it tasted dry!  Nontheless, it tasted better the next day!  LOL  I will try this recipe again, but I will not mix the two together.  I will pour the shrimp and alfredo sauce on top of the fettucine, and mix it on my plate.  Thanks for the GREAT recipe!

Awesome. I learned a neat trick courtesy of the food network. Shrimp can be associated with two things. C (cooked) and O (overcooked). When the shrimp begins to curl into an O then it is overcooked. This is a rule I should have followed because starting the shrimp when I started the noodles caused my shrimp to be a little rubbery. Do yourself a favor: if you're going to start the shrimp at the same time as the noodles, then be sure to have some corn starch and cool water handy (i mixed a teaspoon of corn starch with about two tablespoons of cold water and then added it to the mixture.)

Wow what a yummy sauce and it was so easy. The only thing i would recommend is to saute the shrimp for a minute then take it out leaving the butter and garlic in your pan and continue making your sauce adding the shrimp back in when it's thickened. Thanks for the awesome recipe :)

My favorite dish, can't get enough.  I did add pepper, and didn't have the half-and-half so just added a little heavy cream.  Worked out awesome.

I would use uncooked shimp.  Leaving the cooked shrimp in the pan for the amount of time it takes to thicken the sauce makes them rubbery.  Even then I would make the sauce after the shrimp has cooked and removed from the pan and then added back when the sauce is finished.

Yum!  This was delicious and so easy!  Made a slight substitution based on what I had - 1/2 C half-&-half, 1/4 C chicken broth, 1/4 C white wine.   1/2 lb fettuccini was plenty for this recipe.  Reminded me of a favorite dish from Shell's seafood restaurant.

This was a good recipe. Olive Garden's alfredo is my favorite and this was far from it, but it was yummy. My sauce thickened well and this is why. First of all I used real shredded cheese. It was a blend of parm.,romamo, mozz.,provolone(publix brand). Don't use the parm. cheese in the can that you put over spagetti or it won't thicken.  Second I used half heavy cream and half half-and-half(as someone else suggested). And last, do add the shrimp butter and garlic at the end so the shrimp do not cook the whole time the sauce does. Most importantly, be patient. It takes a good 20 minutes of stirring for sauce to thicken, and will continue to do so  after it starts to cool. Good luck!

I tried to make a healthier version -if there is such a thing:) -  by replacing the butter with olive oil, using non-fat half & half, and slightly less cheese. It was still very good & I really enjoyed the dish

I made this dish with scallops and shrimp. I used fresh chopped cilantro instead of parsley. Cilantro is more appropriate for seafood dishes, but parsley is good too. I did not take any pictures of this dish because everyone ate is so quickly. The family all said that they loved it. I will make this one again.

For starters, everyone is right: There isn't enough sauce for one pound. I made half a pound of pasta and there was just barely enough. Secondly, I can't understand why people were saying they couldn't get the sauce to thicken. Mine did easily, I just constantly whisked the sauce. Definitely do not add your shrimp right away, saute the shrimp in butter and garlic separately and then add when the sauce is ready. Nice dish!

Double the liquid. Even add a 1/2 c. of shrimp stock that you made from the shrimp shells. Add parmesan to your own liking. Cook the shrimp in the 6, or more, cloves of garlic and 2 tbs., or more, of butter and some red pepper flakes. Remove before they are cooked through. When the sauce is thick enough for you add some; sauted mushrooms, maybe some frozen peas or some par boiled sliced carrots and of coarse the shrimp. I added the pasta to the sauce and believe me that 1 lb. of pasta will suck up the sauce.

delicous -- I used  frozen shrimp and bay scallops that  I had in my freezer.  I used non fat cream, lots of fresh grated parmansan and some of my pasta water. I added  a few fresh mushrooms, red pepper flakes and a pinch of oregano---  this is a perfect easy recipe and  thanks for sharing--- never used cornstarch to thicken a recipe like this and never use canned parmansan - use fresh!! This sauce will thicken on it own if done right-- I will make again!

Great recipe, but I had to spruce it up a little for my liking. I used oregano instead of parsley and sered my pan with wine before adding the butter. I used a seafood melody of scallops and different shrimps. I also added onions and mushrooms and it was divine!

Yummy!  This is the best I have ever made. I sauteed 3 Tbsp. butter, garlic, diced onion, pepper, and shrimp. Then, I removed shrimp (so it didn't overcook), then made the sauce. I also added 1/3 C. cream cheese as a thickener. (Tip: Bread crumbs works well too). Then served over wheat angel hair pasta. It was sooooo good!!

Umm...Can't say I will make this again. The sauce was not creamy at all and had almost no flavor. I'm very disappointed. The only redeeming quality of the dish was the shrimp, which I cooked up myself, so I can't really give the recipe credit.

It was OK but real Fettucine Alfredo does not have any cream in it, there are 2 main ingredients which are Plugra butter and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, the recipe if from L’ Originale Alfredo di Roma Ristorante I have always had fettucine with cream until i tasted it from Alfredos where it originated from it is not creamy at all it clumps together when you mix it and when you taste it the flavor bursts in your mouth

Only change I would make next time would be to make the sauce separately, by melting 1 extra tablespoon of butter/margarine in a separate medium sauce pot along with 1 tablespoon of flour, whisk until combined and butter is melted, then proceed with most of the cream,keep(save some to thin later if needed), then add cheese salt and pepper to taste.  Use a whisk during the entire sauce process and it will be less grainy. And, as for having too much pasta, you can always make less pasta, more sauce, or serve the extra pasta with butter/garlic/parsley for a picky young one! Thanks for a delicious (and easy, even with 3 pots) meal!

Wow, for a basic alfredo, this was great.  To start, I didn't have shrimp.  I used some extra garlic, (5-6 cloves).  I was also low on half-and-half, so I used 3/4 cup instead of a whole cup.  I still used the same amount of cheese, added salt and fresh ground pepper to taste and dried parsley.  I had no problem thickening, actually it got a little too thick because I continued cooking on very low heat while making the pasta.  In hindsight, as the recipe states, start pasta first.  But a really tasty, quick-and-easy alfredo.

Can't believe alfredo sauce is this easy! I won't be buying it in a jar again. Tasted great and was super easy. I used 1 cup each of parmesan and half and half and a tbsp of butter and cornstarch. No need to make a roux or anything, with some heat, stirring, and a quarter of an hour gone, it was soon being scarfed down by husband. Thanks!

This recipe was okay, although I waited a long time my sauce never thickened: so while it had nice flavor it was runny.  I've made this recipe before using jarred Ragu Alfredo and it looks and tastes better.  The flavor was good but the consistancy was off.  Being as the shrimp in this recipe are cooked, be careful not to saute them for too long or they will get rubbery.

Excellent recipe. However a true Italian mama told me to add tomato paste to any alfredo I make. Boy was she right. The addition  is always enjoyed by all.

This is an awesome recipe!  We have made it about 5 times and it is one of our favorites.  We have changed it though and now it is truly phenomenal.  Like others have mentioned, we double the sauce ingredients.  We also saute using more butter, 3 tablespoons instead of 1.  We use uncooked shrimp and saute them (not cooked shrimp as the recipe calls for).   We use collosal size shrimp, the 21 to 25 count, 1.5 pound bag, available at Sams.  These are a great size for shrimp alfredo.  We use 8 cloves of garlic, instead of 4.  We also use angel hair pasta instead of the fettuccini.  And finally, at the end of the cooking, we add ½ cup of chardonnay white wine.  As mentioned, this is an awesome recipe.  We have simply kicked it up a notch with our changes.  Enjoy.

This dish was excellent!!  I only made a few changes.  I used raw shrimp instead of cooked shrimp.  I seasoned the shrimp a bit then sauted them with the butter and garlic until just barely pink so they were not over cooked.  I also added 3 more tablespoons of Parmesan cheese.  Otherwise I followed it to the letter. Very easy and quite tasty.

This is simple yet best shrimp fettucine alfredo ever.I did as other reviewers said in double the sauce.Since i didn't have half n half i used 1 cup heavy cream
3/4 cup 2%milk and a 4oz cream cheese.And i was whisking it frequently i add my parmesean cheese and fresh parsley since it wasn't thickening i add about 3 tsp of cornstarch.I cooked my garlic in olive oil for a minutes add my shrimp cook that for about 3 minutes total ,took it off the heat.When my sauce thicken i added my shrimp and a little more parmesean chees this was phenomal.Jar can of alfredo sauce no more i will be making it this way for now on Thanks

I found this to be more of a starter recipe.  added chopped red pepper, parley, oregano and basil.  also used cream instead of half and half for a slighlty thicker and creamier sauce.  delicious.

This is one of the most successful homemade alfredo recipes I have ever made.  My only suggestion would be separately sauteeing uncooked shrimp in a nice wine/butter/garlic sauce so the shrimp taste as rich as the rest of the dish.

Yummmmm!!!! Delicious flavor and I loved the idea of adding some broccoli. I cut down on the calories by using fat free half and half also. Next time I'll add some mushrooms like another reviewer suggested. Great recipe - this a keeper and surprisingly full of flavor, but not heavy on the gut like the traditional alfredo sauce.

Absolutely delicious and super easy!!!  Hints from other reviewers were a great help.  A lot of my hints below are from other reviewers that were a great help.  My 22 year old son, came in and said he wouldn't be eating supper with us.  He took one taste and said that he decided to stay and ate a huge plate.  He and my son were grabbing at whatever was left. I know this recipe says it feeds 6, but 3 of us polished it off.  Will absolutely be making this again !

The changes I made and would make again next time are .......... 
1.  Instead of 1 pound pasta, I chose one of the 300 gram packages from Catelli Healthy Harvest. This amount of pasta was perfect
2.  Instead of 1 cup half and half I used between 1/2 and 3/4 cup of homogenized milk and the balance with half and half.  I'll keep cutting the fat bit by bit each time I make this (example: part 2% and part homogenized)
3.  After saute of shrimp, I removed from the pan and then made the sauce.  I put back the shrimp near the end. 
4.  Instead of 6 tablespoons, I used approx 1/2 cup.  I used low fat parmesan.  Fresh parmesan is of course the best but I chose this option only because I'm trying to watch my fat intake
5. I used dried parsley flakes and it was good
6. I added a little bit of ground black pepper
7.  I didn't have the patience to wait until this thickened, so I added about 1-2 tablespoons of cornstarch to help.

Easy and good. Followed directions except doubled sauce & shrimp. Also, used cavendar's greek seasoning instead of salt and added separately sautéed mushrooms and little pasta water to the sauce at the end.

Yum!  I added a splash of pasta water to thin the sauce out a little, and added chopped sun dried tomato, which made it all look nice and pink.  Topped it all off with sliced chives.  Thank you for sharing!

This is a keeper recipe.  it's simple and very tasty.  The parmesan trick didn't work well for me, and I ended up with clumps of cheese in the sauce.  I sprinkled about 1 T of flour just to thicken it, but really, but the thinner sauce worked out very nicely.  I will tuck this one away and make it a familiy regular recipe.

Easy to make, sauce came out fine in consistency if you let it sit so I recommend making sauce before putting putting noodles in the boiling water and while the noodles cook the sauce is cooling.  Good overall recipe with lots of room to tweak it to your personal likes. Enjoy

Was really good and easy!  The only advise I would have is to be careful not to add TOO much parmesean, it will be really thick. Great also will lemon squeezed into it!

This is close to the recipe I use. I use a pint of heavy whipping cream, 8 oz fresh parmesan and enough half and half to thin it as desired. I've given everyone at work the recipe and they love it.

With the shrimp, add a can of artichocke hearts, quartered, and 3 crimini (small portabella) mushrooms, washed & sliced. I always make extra because my wife loves this and will have it several days in a row for dinner. Note, tho, that I often make this with jarred alfredo sauce like Classico, etc.

I've used this site many, many times to search for a good recipe, but never thought to become a member or to comment on one until now.  Oh....My....Goodness....Mamatiff you & your sister have out done yourselves, many compliments to the chefs.  I have searched and searched for a great Alfredo sauce and I have definitely found it.... I have thrown away ALL my other recipes.  The only change I made to the recipe is I added 3 TBSP of Romano cheese.  The compliments I received from this dish were… it tasted better then Olive Garden, I can handle that.
Thanks again…Kathy

My entire family adores this recipe and my oldest son was shocked when he saw how simple it was to make. He now makes it for some of his friends at school and they can't get enough of it. 

I do recommend doubling the sauce though. The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly and I felt that the sauce didn't go far enough to cover all the noodles. If I use only 1/2 pound of noodles then the recipe is perfect as written.

BRAVO!

This was so  easy and so good.   I use 6 cloves  garlic, low fat condensed milk with  1 tsp of corn starch,,  instead of half and half, 8 T of Parmesan cheese, 1/2 tsp pepper and used dry  parsley.  I cooked the shrimp while it was frozen and included the liquid in my sauce.

This is a wonderful dish..  I wanted to use fresh fettucine and could not find it.  So I bought 16oz  of fresh small 3 cheese ravioli.  Used butter to saute 8oz of sliced mushrooms with some garlic powder.   Added 1 quart of 1/2 and 1/2.   Let the mushrooms and half and half simmer. Cooked ravoli according to directions.  Added 12oz of Parmesan cheese plus 2 slices of swischeese to half and half.  Added 1pound raw shrimp simmered until just pink. Added ravioli and simmered for a few minutes more.  Sprinkled some wondra flour over top  just to give it a little more thickness.   Oh my goodness this was over the top good. The combination of the 3 cheese ravioli and  mushroom added that extra flavor.

This recipe was very very good.  I made some slight variations - added half and half and chicken brother.  Added salt and pepper.  Also added some feta cheese and parmesan at the end (I like feta).  It was great!!

This recipe was good. But didn't thicken. I did cook shrimp in butter and garlic separate from the 1/2 & 1/2 and parm. The parm. didn't melt like it should in the beginning But did have to raise the temp to a slight boil to get it to melt. I didn't use the suggested noodle with this recipe, was trying a new noodle called "Miracle Noodle" made from Gluomannan. Instead of using flour to thinken it, used Konjac Glucomannan Powder, used just like Cornstarch. The sauce was doubled and I only used 1 tsp of the powder to thicken, and it did it just beautifully. Hubby and I rated it a 4 because the flavor was good, but not out there knock your socks off, but a very good recipe. And simple. I'd make it again with additional garlic and more parsley.

I made this two nights ago.  It was so simple and good! I've never made alfredo before so I was very happy that the pasta had such great flavor. As others reported, the sauce is a bit runny when cooked as directed, that's why I rated this recipe three stars,  but when taken off the heat it thickens a little. I will try the cornstarch next time as others have suggested. I had it for lunch today and it tasted even better! The consistency of the sauce was perfect. Maybe sitting it in the fridge overnight gave it time to set a little?  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was great; it's fast, easy and delicious!  Definitely double the sauce ingredients though, or cut the pasta in half, or there won't be enough sauce.  I stirred in thawed from frozen broccoli florets and the shrimp right at the end to only heat through, and Viola!  It was beautiful and tasty!

Great suggestions in the reviews.  I doubled the sauce, kept everything seperate, sauted the shrimp in butter and garlic after the noodles and sauce were done, thickened the sauce with cornstarch and added  white wine to thin a bit.

This was delicious. It tastes just like the shrimp alfredo from Red Lobster...yum!! The sauce didn't thicken so I used cornstarch to speed it up. I also doubled the sauce a bit.  I found it wasn't enough for 1lb. of pasta. I will most definitely make this recipe again!!

Remember to keep the sauce simmering on low. The time does not seem right when you do this. If you don't, the cheese will all clump together. Very runny, was served in bowls.

very good, but no where near enough sauce. I had to make a 2nd batch of sauce. Next time I will triple the sauce. And make it a bit differently... melt 3T butter with 1/4 cup minced garlic and add shrimp. Cook 1 minute, remove shrimp, add 3 T flour. SLOWLY whisk in 3 cups half & half, waiting for it to bubble and thicken before each new addition. Sauce thickens MUCH faster this way! Add 1 cup cheese and 3T parsley. Then pour over shrimp & noodles. I also added 3/4 a head of fresh broccoli florets that I first steamed in microwave. Next time I'll add the whole head.

Tasted good, but the half-and-half curdled. Started with raw shrimp and I still think they were overcooked by the end. Next time, will keep them separate from the alfredo sauce. Served with linguine (instead of fettucine), French bread and a salad.

Flavor was good, but I agree with others....the sauce was just too thin despite my efforts to correct it. It did thicken after being removed from heat, of course, but it still wasn't to my liking. Once the leftovers were in the fridge, the sauce was about as thick as I'd like it to be, but then you have to reheat it obviously. Four stars for flavor, but I won't be making this particular recipe again probably. It'd be really good if the sauce wasn't so thin.

This was definitely a crowd pleaser.. definitely best to saute the shrimp then put them aside until sauce is complete.. Was just as good the next day.

Excellent, simple, and fabulous to the taste buds! My only suggestion is to not use 4 cloves of garlic--too over-powering. I used one fresh medium sized clove and it was the perfect balance. One more thing--there is a new grated cheese on the market made by Kraft. It's a blend of Parmesan, Romano, and Asiago--superb  combination.

This was a very good recipe and simple/fast to make.  I made a few changes after reading some of the other reviews.  I made about 1/2 cup more sauce, and added the shrimp after the sauce was done.  I did not have parsley so I used fresh frozen dill instead.  When the pasta was almost finished cooking I added some fresh green beans to the water, drained then mixed in the sauce and shrimp.  Very tasty.  Will make again when I need a quick dinner.

great recipe however I love pink sauces.  I added one peeled and seeded large Italian tomatoe, changed the half and half to1/2 c of milk and 1/2c philly cream cheese.  Isauted the tomate til it was broken down and than I added raw shrimp.  Finished as written;  thanks for a great idea to a great pink sauce.   I set red pepper flakes out to be added as  desired; if not for my other I would have added with the shrimp.

Next time I'll set the shrimp aside while I make the sauce, as the shrimps get a little too tough when they spend that much time in the pan.  I also added milk to increase the volume of sauce.  But the family loved it.

I had my husband rate this recipe.  I used two bags of 14 oz. shrimp, 12 oz. fettucine noodles, 1 1/2 TBS. cornstarch, and added a 4 oz. can of drained mushrooms after cooking sauce.  I doubled the Parmesan cheese and used Italian seasoning and dried parsley.  I followed the recipe in cooking the shrimp and garlic in the butter.  I served it with seasoned green beans, but think next time, will have stirred fried Italian veggies or salad with it.  Hubby says this is a "keeper."

Absolutely amazing! For everyone who says it was too runny, you just need to cook it a little longer at about 5-6 on your element dial, stir constantly and don't let boil. Alson, remember it will thicken after only a couple mintues when removed from heat! I added a little under a can of crab meat and it was restaurant quality! Very easy and so much more flavor than I expected! Thank you for sharing :)

This was scrumptious!  We added some broccoli, cooked in microwave for 1 1/2 min.  We used Fettuccini and Linguinnie noodles,  Used two cups of half and half, and extra parmessan cheese.  We usually cook for left overs and to share with our parents.  We had enough left over for the parents and none for us.  Constant stirring over low heat is a must.   YUM!

My roommate and I made this for dinner tonight, and it was outstanding. I commented to her that it was as good as (if not better than) Olive Garden! The sauce was creamy and cheesy and just lightly garlicky, not too overpowering. I modified it a little bit and used whatever noodles were on hand, adding a dash of pepper and a handful of fresh spinach for color. I added the spinach at the very end and just stirred them in long enough to wilt a little (not too long). DELICIOUS! I'm so glad there are leftovers in the fridge to look forward to tomorrow!

Delicious!  Sauteed sliced chicken breast in some butter with the garlic, then threw in uncooked shrimp when the chicken was almost done.  Added 2 Tbsp whte wine and simmered a couple minutes before adding 1% milk,in place of the half-and-half, and the cheese.  Thickened the sauce with a little cornstarch dissolved in cold milk.  Everyone loved it.

This was just okay, I did no like the texture at all.  It wasn't smooth like Alfredo.  Don't know where I went wrong I made sure to use fresh parmesan cheese too.

Absolutely loved this!  We added more cheese, and it got a little too "grainy", but the flavor was still amazing.  Will follow the recipe next time!

Good, but not enough sauce for the pasta.  I would double the recipe for a whole pkg of pasta.  I added fresh italian seasoning, black pepper to taste, and Tony Chachere's to kick it up a little.  I will definitely make this again, but will double the sauce.

I made this for dinner and my 9 year old daughter who is a Shrimp Pasta Alfredo-holic loved it and begged for more 2 days straight.  I used heavy cream instead of half and half (becuase that is what I mistakenly purchased), but it still turned out marvelous.

This was delicious.  However, it didn't thicken for me.  I would definitely try this again and I did use fresh uncooked shrimp.

I ate myself silly.....this recipe is SOOOOO good!  I doubled the sauce ingredients- per other reviewers- and made 3/4lb of pasta.  I didn't want my shrimps to be overcooked so, I sauteed the garlic in butter and poured 2C of 1/2 and 1/2 into the pan (used fat free) and then added in about a whole cup of parmesan cheese, added some s&p, then added my shrimp into the sauce and dumped in some frozen peas (I didn't use parsely b/c I had none, but the dear one wanted something green!) and they were very good.  This was SOOOOO good, and SOOOOOOO easy.  Less than 1/2 hour start to finish.  Thanks so much for sharing this awesome recipe!

This is a great recipe, but my wife an I cannot stomach heavy creams, so we substituted the half-and-half with 1 1/2 c chicken broth, 1/3 c cream cheese and 1 tbsp of corn starch.  You will get the same consistency and similarly great flavor.  I also used raw shrimp and added a handful of chopped cilantro.

The whole family enjoyed this.  We did not have enough sauce for our liking so next time I will increase the half-and-half and the Parmesan cheese.  Delicious!

This was a great recipe!  My 6 year old son said this is the best meal I have ever made!  It was cute.  But I doubled the sauce.  Don't wait for it to thicken while it cooks, it'll be thin but when you pour it on the noodles it thickens.  Will definetly make it again.  I used dried parsley and it was fine also.

I tried this recipe on Thanksgiving day and my daughter loved it so much!It does take a long while to thicken but I followed other reviewers advice to take off heat. I also added more parmesan cheese than what was called for cause I love cheese!I didn't really measure how much,i just went with instinct=)

My family definitely like this.  I doubled the sauce because it would have made the dish dry.  I like my pasta to be creamy. Overall, I would say that this is the very close to the alfredo sauce served at my local Italian restaurant.

LOVE this recipe.  Used full cream instead of half and half by accident and WOW it was amazing!  But for the health-conscious that's not the best idea.  Excellent recipe!!

This was amazing! I did use part half and half, and part heavy cream to make it thicker faster.  In addition, I added ground nutmeg to the sauce, just sprinkled it over the top, but enough that you can see it when its stirred in.  I also used a bit more cheese than stated.  The sauce was enough for the amount of pasta I made, but for the amount listed in the recipe I would double the sauce.  Otherwise this was great!

For someone who's just learning to make Fettucine Alfredo, I found this recipe very easy to make and yummy! I followed another reviewer's advice and used fat free half and half with corn starch. For some reason, I didn't have enough sauce for the 1 lb pasta so I ended up making another batch of sauce (using the same amount of butter, half and half, cornstarch, and parmesan)and mixed it in with the already prepared pasta. My boyfriend and I enjoyed it very much the second time around!!!

Fabulously quick and easy recipe.  I used raw shrimp which I think avoids the chance of overcooking.
I also added chopped broccoli to the pasta while it cooked for the last couple of minutes - to give a little extra color but also to add a vegetable for an all-in-one dinner.
Great dish - can be used for any occasion.
Thanks for the post.

This is a keeper! I use 1/2 cup of half and half and 1/2 cup white cooking wine. It does take a while to thicken, so I added a little Wondra or flour.

This is a good recipe, but you will get a much better flavor and sauce consistency if you use heavy cream instead of butter. My family is Italian and our family recipe- handed down straight from Italy two generations ago- calls for heavy cream, which takes some time to thicken, but is essential for an authentic alfredo sauce.

the sauce took too long to thicken, by the time it did, most of it had evaporated. I had to add cream cheese and more half & half, which turned out great. The sauce thickened in 5 minutes. To anyone that has the same problem, I suggest you add cream cheese to the sauce to thicken it.

This recipe ROCKS!! I put chicken with it instead of shrimp, and it came out awesome. However, I cheated by looking at some of the other suggestions, and doubled the sauce, used whipping cream, and also some cornstarch to thicken it up. All-in-all, it was awesome, will make again and again!!

This was very tasty. I did remove the shrimp after the initial cooking so it wouldn't get tough. I added it to the sauce at the end which I also increased. Good  thing I did or it would have been dry.

I think that this recipe is a fabulous base...we used it with imitation crab meat and added shrimp. I added fresh basil from our garden and used thick whipping cream in place of the half and half. (What I had on hand.) My kids and husband DEVOURED it served over penne and have begged me to make it again. Definitely easy and right up my alley in the time-consumption department. A keeper for sure.

This was so easy and very tasty!  I used fat free half and half and had to thicken it with cornstarch.  Also seasoned with garlic salt and pepper.  You have to double the sauce.  Adding this to my recipe file.  Thank you Mamatiff!

I have made this many times and every time it was very good!! I love this recipe as is. When I am in a rush to get dinner done I do not add things.  When I have more time I will add broccoli and use fresh garlic and not the one in the jar.  Also, instead of using Parmesan cheese I use parmigiano-reggiano cheese.

I usually always just use Alfredo sauce from a jar. So I thought I would try to make homemade this time. This recipe was wonderful!!! I don't think I will ever buy Alfredo sauce again. It was easy to make and tasted good. Also after reading other reviews I doubled the sauce and put the shrimp in the sauce at the end. Turned out great!!

Tried this dish for dinner the other night and it was a big hit.  Only real change I made to this recipe was to use spinach in place of the parsley.  Will be making this dish again.

This was quite yummy and everyone loved it at my house.  I would say that I did make a few slight changes...I sauted a seafood mixture (10oz) of shrimp, calamari, and scallops in the butter and minced garlic for about 5 minutes and set it over on the side so it wouldn't overcook in the pasta mixture.  Then I warmed the half and half over low heat and I added about 1/2 cup more of it to what the recipe initially called for.  I added salt and pepper to the half and half and I did up the amount of cheese the recipe called for (8 tablespoons of Parm/Regg and 8 tablespoons Parm/Romano)...I cut up fresh parsley (about 2 tablespoons worth) and tossed it in with about half a box worth of cooked angel hair pasta.  Oh yeah, and I added a couple of pinches of cayenne pepper for a slight touch of heat.  Thanks for the recipe!  Super yummy :)

Delicious!  I used raw shrimp and just gave them a couple extra minutes on each side in the butter and garlic prior to adding the half and half.  My sauce was sort of thin, but it worked well once it cooled on my plate.  I think it would have been too thick had I added cornstarch.   This did not make a lot of sauce.  It was just right for me, my husband and our toddler...although I know that next time I make it, my husband will ask me to make double the sauce! Thanks for a great recipe1

YUMMY!  My very picky husband devoured this dish.  I didn't have any half and half so I used 2% milk instead, added an extra 2 Tbs of parmesan and about 1 Tbs of cornstarch.  Perfect consistency and wonderful flavor.  Added some carmelized onions to the plate and threw in some steamed broccoli.  Perfection!

This was awesome. I didn't have half and half so I use 2% with an extra tbsp of butter and added corn starch to thicken. I always say you should follow the recipe once to try it the way that it was intended, but didn't have all the ingredients. One of the best surprises in the last year. AWESOME

This was good and very easy and quick.  I used whipping cream because I wanted to use it up in something.  Followed exactly otherwise.  Everyone liked it.  Had just enough sauce for 4 people, no way I would have been able to feed six.

This is a great recipe and takes no time to make.  However, you will slightly to moderately overcook the shrimp (depending on how you cook this) if you follow the directions exactly.  Some people are more sensitive to overcooked shrimp than others so this might not matter to you.  If it does, simply cook the shrimp separately.  Furthermore, I love thinly sliced red and orange bell pepper in my alfredo sauce so I added that along with a little more garlic, as well.  Those of you that like a little more sauce may want to double the amount of half-and-half, garlic, butter, and onion.  Whisk in a little cornstarch if you prefer it a little thicker.  If you cooked the shrimp separately, whisking in the cornstarch will be less of a hassle.  Enjoy!

This was super easy and super delish!!!  I had no issues getting the sauce to thicken.  I think the key to getting it thick is adding the parm one tablespoon at a time.  I doubled the sauce for one pound of noodles and used one pound of chicken as well.  I cut the chicken in to bite size pieces. Cooked them in the pan with one table spoon of butter until done, but not browned.  Then followed the recipe to a tee.  It came out perfect. I am not a fan of jarred alfredo and now that I have this recipe I will be eating alfredo much more often.

Good flavor but sauce was a problem.  Would double sauce next time.  Following reviews I simmered 20 minutes, removed from heat, still did not thicken properly had to add Wondra flour to thicken.

Its a keeper. My family loved it, even my 1 and 6 yr. old. I read the reviews before I made it and the only thing different I did was only cooked half the noodles the recipe called for. It doesn't make a whole lot so you may want to double the recipe if serving a large family. I will double next time just so we could have leftovers.

This is a great recipe. It's quick and easy! I used raw shrimp instead of cooked shrimp to prevent over cooking. Also, the sauce is very hard to thicken so I used the advice of another review and used corn starch to thicken the sauce. as well as adding pepper to taste. If you like spicy, add a pinch of cajun seasoning to the shrimp.

I did not like this.  This was close but?  I use one stick butter-3/4 jar parmesan romano alot of cream or half and half and any fresh herbs I choose.  Put the cream and butter and cheese in a big bowl and micro. it for 5-8 minutes. Stir frequently. Add cooked pasta and shrimp or chicken.  Very thick very fattening and really just a tweak to this basic recipe. No offence but I like a thick sauce.

Very good right out of the pot.  Later, not so good--too much cheese- totally my fault.

This was just ok for me...for some reason I could not get the sauce to thicken, even after removing it from the heat. It also was not enough sauce for me as the noodles sucked all the sauce right up! We enjoyed it ok, just felt like something was missing and not enough sauce!

Great taste. I had trouble getting the sauce to thicken. Finally gave up the stirring and added a tablespoon of flour to help it along. Since I used a cup and 1/2 of half and half - I also added about 4 more tablespoons of Parmesan cheese. Good dish overall, but wish it had been a little thicker sauce.

Sauce came out watery. Perhaps using a bechamel sauce instead will be better. I will try it.

This was a great recipe! My only problem was that there was not enough sauce for an entire pound of fettuccine; I had way too much pasta left over! I'd used half a pound of pasta (or less if you really like sauce) for an individual plate; for a family plate, I'd recommend doubling the ingredients. I also put 8 tbsp of Parmesan instead of 6 and added a dash of onion powder and a dash of Asiago. This recipe is the first time I've ever chopped my own parsley and I'm so satisfied that I'll be doing that from now on!

Sooo good. At the suggestion of others we used half the noodles and waited to add the shrimp.  We thought the sauce was going to be too thin but once we tossed the pasta in it was perfect.

Excellent! What an easy recipe. I took the advice of other reviews and halved the pasta and doubled the sauce recipe which helped. I also thought the sauce was a little thick so I had to add milk to thin it out, but it tasted great!

Loved this!  Followed recipe exactly, and it came out great.  I loved that it wasn't swimming in sauce -- just enough to cling to the pasta.  And honestly, it didn't seem THAT bad for me.  Will definitely make it again... hmm... maybe tomorrow...

Really good as directed, but definitely add the cooked shrimp towards the end or they overcook and become chewy.  Also, don't make the pasta until the end too or once the sauce is added to it, the cheese will cool too fast and won't stay in a smooth sauce form.  FYI, the sauce takes a good 45-50 minutes to thicken so don't expect this as a "quick" recipe.  Worth the wait though!

This was great and easy! I used 2% milk instead of half&half, to make it healthier. After it boiled 2 mins, I added a tsp of cornstarch with a 1/4c water to thicken. Worked perfectly. Also used dried parsley flakes instead of fresh. Very nice flavour.

This recipe was great.  My family really enjoyed it.  I used raw shimp sauteed in butter and garlic until fully cooked.  It only took a few more minutes.  I increased the amount of half and half and parmesan for a creamier sauce.

This alfredo was very good.  I used Chicken because I didn't have shrimp.  I also used a suggestion to add 1/3 c. cream cheese and it was perfect!!  Will use them many time over.

This was a great alfrado sauce. Better then any other I've tried and so easy. I had to make a little more sauce because it wasn' t enough to coat the alfrado the way I like, but that was an easy fix.  I do also agree with previous posters who suggested to add the shrimp at the end.  Also I added about 3/4 cup halved grape tomatos at the end, just before the shrimp for color and I just like the contrasting flavors.

Oh, my gosh this recipe is the bomb.  This was my first time making alfredo sauce and I love it. Sauce came out great, you just have to be patient and let it thicken its worth the wait ( I used raw shrimp, cooked first and set aside)

Very good!! A little unhealthy for my taste but you have to cheat sometimes. I sauteed garkic and seasonings first and used 3/4 half and half and 1/4 heavy cream in case. (Nervous about it being runny) Took a little while to thicken but was soooo easy!!! Def. a keeper!

I LOVED THIS RECIPE. I ALSO SUBSTITUTED HALF & HALF FOR HEAVY CREAM. I ALSO USED 1/2 TSP SALT & 1/4 TSP PEPPER. MY WHOLE FAMILY LOVED IT. THE ONLY PROB I RAN INTO WAS THE SHRIMP GOT OVER COOKED, SO ADD THE SHRIMP LAST. I AM ADDING THIS RECIPE TO A BOOK I AM MAKING MY 10 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER.

My sauce came out too thick.  I think it was because I might have added too much half and half and the previous posts made me think the sauce would come out too watery so I think I screwed it up by added too much flour and half and half.  However, I think 1LB of pasta is way too much for the amount of sauce.  Half of that would have worked out perfect for it.

This turned out excellent. You do have to doctor up the sauce a little if you like it thicker. I added the heavy cream and a small amount of half and half at the end to thicken it - I also added a 1/3 cup of flour which really helped. This was an excellent recipe - my boyfriend went crazy and said it was better than the olive gardens sauce.

I made this last night and it was great.  It tasted very much like I would expect at a resturaunt.  The only thing I did wrong was making the sauce too thick.  I was so scared from all the reviews it would be too soupy that I over did it (and added too much cheese) and it had a chunky texture.  However, it did not affect the taste at all, just the appearance.  It tasted wonderful!  I did have to make two batches of sauce as it was not enough for a pound of pasta.  I couldn't believe I pulled it off, that I actually made alfredo from scratch.  Very easy to do!  Also, the garlic and shrimp sautee was delicious by itself.  My son ate one from the plate while I made the sauce (I took them out beofre I started the sauce as they were "ready to eat" shrimp) and he said "aww yeah, babe."  Great recipe!

Super easy and delicious. I made it with angel hair pasta. I also took the advice of other reviewers and waited a little while to put the shrimp in, it doesn't need to be sauted with the garlic. I also added a little more parsley then the recipe calls for. I would highly recommend this recipe for an easy and yummy dinner!

I decided to add some canned spinach I had on hand to the alfredo sauce to give it a little kick and it gave it a really great flavor.  Also, I did not have any fresh parsley so I substituted w/dry.  I will definately make this again but next time I will wait until the last 3-5 minutes of cook time before adding the pre-cooked shrimp so that the sauce reaches its desired thickness first and the shrimp do not get too overdone.

This recipe was very easy and delicious. Tasted just as good as anything I've had in any restaurant! I added musrooms and doubled the parmesan cheese.

This is a great recipe!  I made mine with chicken browned off in the garlic
butter.  I wish I had used a better grade of cheese as I think it would have made a huge difference in flavor.
I added fresh ground pepper and reduced the salt a bit.  I also added
extra cheese and did thicken the sauce
a bit with cornstarch. Once I put the
dish together however I wished I had
not thickened my sauce.  I too made extra sauce.  I made enough for two
pounds of fettuccine.  This recipe was
well liked.  I will use it again.  Thankyou Tiffany for a great versatile recipe.

I made this recipe for 8 as I have hungrey teenage boys. I recommend 10 or more garlic cloves , and use heavy cream , at the end reserve a bit of cream to shake with say 2 tablespoons cornstarch and add to thicken. Ive made quite a few alfredo recipes on here, Kids and hubby say this one is THE best with my changes. Next time I'll try addin sauteed mushrooms, and maybe chicken. Good luck cooks :)

My Friend cooked this for her son's rehearsal dinner.  OH MY, was it great.... The sauce was a little thin at first, but after I cooked it at home for my family I used cream and it did thicken some.  Also, she used shredded parmesean, and it was a little grainy.  I used the Powder kind that you shake on Spaghetti and there was a big difference.  Favorite family dish, We love it... Substitute grilled chicken, throw in some broccoli, or cook it like Tiffany did, ITs GREAT!!!

This is a decent foundation however there were some changes I made:  I doubled the ingredients for the sauce as its way too little sauce for the amount of ingredients.  In fact, I think next time I would triple the sauce ingredients.  I used whipping cream instead of half and half, added additional seasonings because it was pretty bland (pepper, onion powder, also make sure you add enough salt).  I also added a little more cheese.  We also enjoy broccoli with our alfredo which I steamed and added at the end with grilled shrimp.  I did not add shrimp in the beginning as I did not want them to overcook.  Also to thicken the sauce I added about a 1/2 tablespoon of flour...would've used cornstarch but I didn't have any on hand.

Very good basic recipe! I did add a little cornstarch to the half and half before adding it to the shrimp. I didn't want to wait for the sauce to thicken by cooking it down.  Other than that I served it over zoodles.  Super good!

tried this today and it came out great, as per my PICKY husband,  5 stars.  I also sauted some mushrooms, mini peppers and threw in cuz he's on weight watchers and I wanted to make sure he had enough.  (I did scale this down to 2 servings about 6 shrimp but made all the sauce). thank you for the post.

Quick, easy, and delicious! Didn't have half and half but had evaporated milk and that worked nicely. I put uncooked shrimp in a bowl and seasoned with salt and fresh garlic. I threw them in,  juice and all at the end. It only takes a couple of minutes for the shrimp to cook and the juice from the seasoned shrimp gave the sauce nice dimension. We have this once or twice a month now with different pastas and veggies thrown in.

Delish! While I did find it necessary to make a couple of minor changes, this was nearly perfect without them!!! As others have noted, instead of using a whole pound of pasta you really only need half a box. Heeding to this advice, I made the full amount of sauce but cut the amount of pasta in half. I also added a tiny bit more half-half to my sauce (maybe 1/2 - 1 T) and used 1 1/2 T butter because my 12 oz. worth of medium sized shrimp didn't seem to be well coated with the 1 T called for. I cooked my shrimp separately and then added them to my pasta and sauce right before serving. I can't imagine how overcooked my shrimp would have been if I cooked them in the sauce. On that note, my sauce thickened up rather quickly (in less than five minutes), so don't fret over it. If you're looking for an easy and tasty weeknight meal, this is it. I will be making this often for sure. Thanks for sharing, MAMATIFF! :-)

Very good, but we definitely needed to double the sauce and we only had a 12oz box of pasta.  It thickened up nicely without adding anything.  I wonder if those who had issues used powdered parmesan instead of grated perhaps.  I also used raw shrimp which I cooked through then removed from the pan.  I would think that the way this is written would make for some tough shrimp.

Just a tip to add more flavor to your sauce.. when you peel your shrimp, before you add any ingredients to your cream.. boil the peelings in the cream or half and half for a good 15 mins or longer.. then strain the peelings out and continue on with the recipe .. you may need to touch off the cream as that some may evaporate while you are boiling the shrimp peels ...this gives your sauce an amazing flavor..also I splurge just a bit and buy the parmigiano reggiano for my parmesan it may cost a bit more but.. you will use less and the flavor is so good .. I personally add as much parmigiano reggiano as I like to my tasting and sometimes if I cant get the sauce thick enough I will use a bit of corn starch to help thicken it..  another tip .. do not add your shrimp to your sauce if you have used your peelings to flavor the sauce.. a lot of times the shrimp will over cook.. Instead… sauté them with some butter (real butter)and garlic and then when they are almost done *aldente*  take them off the fire  squeeze a bit  lemon on them .. when you plate your pasta add the fettuccine sauce then top it with the sautéed shrimp and sprinkle some pepper flakes and some fresh grated parmigiano reggiano over it.. serve with a nice simple salad with an Italian dressing homemade if possible and fresh garlic toasted bread.you want to crank the flavor up even more in your sauce.. while you are cooking the sauce you can add a touch of Powered Knorr Chicken flavor(not cubes) to your sauce..

I made this tonight and I should have doubled the recipe for one pound of pasta.  My turned out dry. I cooked the shrimp shells for a little broth and used the broth to stretch the sauce.  I also cooked the shrimp with the butter and garlic and then removed them when they were cooked to add them back when the sauce was thicker.  It was ok and I think I will try another recipe.

Very good, added broccoli for some nutrition.  Would maybe up the half and half to 1.5 cups next time for more sauce with a pound of pasta.

This was a great-tasting alfredo dish! Definitely either double the sauce ingredients, or half the pasta which is what I did since there's only two of us. Even with this change, I still feel like I did not have enough sauce, so I added more half-and-half and it was fine. I did NOT have a problem with the sauce being too thin. I'm not sure why; after reading the reviews I was so sure I would. I don't even know what I did differently. I did use mostly thawed shrimp so there was a lot of water in the pan with the butter and garlic. I drained that all out (keeping the garlic of course!). My boyfriend said it tasted just like restaurant-quality alfredo, and he knew it was low(er) fat. I used high-fiber penne from Trader Joe's and added chopped broccoli (which BF loved because the broccoli pieces were chock full of alfredo!). Definitely a keeper.

This is a keeper. I prefer to use raw shrimp instead of cooked/frozen and this time was no exception. I also added mushrooms and doubled the cheese. Next time, I will either double the sauce or cook less pasta. Thanks for the recipe.

This was pretty good.  I doubled the sauce because I had a little more shrimp and I also added some crabmeat that I had on hand.  Also, added a little sherry and a very small dash of cayenne pepper. Threw in some cooked broccoli.  The only reason I didn't give a 5 star was because the texture of the sauce was a little gritty, I think it may have been from the parmesan cheese.  Maybe because I used the store brand of the stuff in the green can?  I will try this again and buy the good parmesan cheese that I will grate myself.

i loved this recipe. i followed the other recommendations and added the shrimp closer to the end so it wasnt overcooked. i also doubled the ingredients for the sauce. the 1lb of noodles would have been too much. i definitely reccomend this dish

This recipe is flawed, but it is flavorful. Here are the following recommendations: 1) Use raw shrimp, saute in the butter and garlic, then REMOVE to make the Alfredo sauce and add at the end, or as a short cut, but less flavorful, use cooked shrimp and add at the end. 2) Double the sauce ingredients and only use 12 oz of noodles. 3) I used 1/4 cup of freshly chopped flat leaf parsley, which is about 1/3 of a bunch for the double batch. I also did not use 4 cloves of garlic. I used Roasted Elephant garlic as a spread on my French baguette, so I cut back on the garlic. With these changes, it is a 4 star dish.

I usually don't write reviews, mostly because I don't have an account.  But I made one just for this recipe.  This was the WORST dish I have ever attempted to make in my entire life.  The sauce NEVER thickened.  I tried everything that other reviews suggested and NOTHING worked.  I tried adding extra cheese, removing it from the heat, covering it, and nothing made it thicken. I finally threw everything away and got McDonalds for dinner. Thanks for ruining my dinner.

The Only change I made to this recipe was that I cooked the shrimp in the sauce as it was finishing. Great foundation, the 2nd time I used a Tbl of Old Bay, and the 3rd time made a roux with 1 Tbl of Cake flower.

All 3 times it came out better and better :)

Honestly, this is the best shrimp dish I have ever made. I added veggies and sautéed them in with the garlic, and only added the shrimp at the very end so my vegetarian daughter could scoop hers out first.  I didn't have 1/2 n 1/2, so I used a mixture of whipping cream, canned milk, and water.  So delicious!!!  Even my 4 yr old loved it!

So being short on some time & needed it to thicken up a little quick I added some corn starch, and ended up regretting it pretty soon after...left a funky texture (kind of pasty/gritty?) but added a little bit more of everything else and it helped some. All in all though very good recipe, and will make again (when I have a little more time for it to sit).

I was looking for an easy Alfredo recipe for my two young children. This was super easy to make and absolutely delicious. I involved my 8 year year old in the cooking process, she slowly added the Parmesan cheese while i stirred the sauce. I used heavy whipping cream and skim milk because that's all i had. It was super creamy and yum. Thank you for a great recipe.

This never thickened up for me! I had to make more alfrado separate to add in to the mixture. You definately have to add flour to the melted butter before you add the half and half if you ever want it to thicken. If you do this the flavor is good but nothing special by any means, very basic recipe.

The original recipe given is nothing short of fantastic. To make it your own, just add the items that you love that you may have had in a restaurant. When enjoying this recipe I would suggest not thinking about your weight. This should be a day of treating yourself. This way, I would say go all out. I tried it with crab claw seafood, scallops, and shrimp. Green onions aka scallions, sliced mushrooms from a can, and heavy cream is great. Again, don't think about diet on the day you have this. It is a treat. Someone suggested cilantra instead of parsley. They were spot on. Cilantra is better with pasta. When you cut fresh cilantra it has a orange scent. Very pleasant. My non pasta/non seafood eating family loved it. I will make this for myself, home, and job again and again. If your sauce doesn't thicken as fast as you would like try the corn starch or more cheese. You won't be disappointed. Thanks MAMATIFF!!!!!!

Great easy recipe! I wasn't sure if it would be a match for my regular fettucine, but it was faster and tasted great! I did add a little cayenne for a kick! I also used fresh shrimp and added a minute or so to the saute with the butter and garlic

Great Meal.  My husband is very very "picky".  He told me the dish was "very good".  I used store brand parmesan and cut back on the garlic a little. My husband is not a big garlic fan.  Otherwise I give this meal 5 stars.  I also added cooked broccoli for texture.

Very simple and yummy. Nice change from the traditional buttery sauce. Romano parmesan cheese is great in place of the the regular parmesan.

I loved this,  it was very quick and easy! Next time though I will double the sauce. I made 8 servings and with the noodles it was not as creamy as I would have liked it! I liked it and I will definately make this a part of my menu. Oh the kids loved it to!! Thanks for the recipe!!

Yummy! I took the suggestions to double the sauce and they were right. Added some chopped scallions for extra color and flavor. Needed more salt than I added, but otherwise an easy, juicy, and delicious meal.

It is easy and delicious!  I used 4 huge garlic cloves and 1/2 cup parmesan which is 6T, but I only used about 3/4 lb./box of pasta. Must serve immediately as it starts to separate. It's one of my son's favorite meals to order out and he loved it!  I had every ingredient except parsley on hand, which is always a plus for a recipe!

This is easy and delicious. Just what you need on a weeknight when there is homework to be done with the kids. I had my 13 year old son make it, and he was right proud of himself! Recipe needed no adjustments, except I added more half and half as it bubbled away.

It was edible.  Not really my thing.  I don't like the way the half & half tastes outside of my coffee.

Very flavorful, but the sauce is difficult to make. After cooking it, it got too thick, so I added more half-and-half, but it still ended up being too thick.

YUMMY!!! I just made this and its delish! I had about 1/2c left of tortellini cheese in my freezer and added that in as well. Also, I didn't have any half & half and so I added 1/4c whole milk and 1/4c water..and it came out just as delish! Thanks!

This recipe is great, although the milk/cheese combination does not get as thick as I'd like, but using whole milk or a filler can help with that.  Additionally, I added olive oil to the saute garlic and shrimp.... Great, short order recipe!

What a fantastic and quick dinner. I make a lite version to by using no-fat sour cream instead of half and half. Mmmmmmmm!

Its was good, but once the sauce thickens...it really thickens. I even added liquid from the pasta to loosen it up.  It was definitely tastey though!

After reading everyone's review, I decided to double the sauce recipe, so glad I did. The flavor was excellent, the only problem I had was it didn't thicken as well as I would have liked and was a bit "grainy", but I think it was the quality of cheese I used.  My picky son even liked it!! Will def. make again for a quick yummy meal.

I tried this for a bunch of friends the other night (and doubled the recipe), and I had mostly good reviews.  While I liked it pretty well, I felt like something was missing, and am wondering if I should've included more Parmesan cheese than the recipe called for.  It was quick and easy, though, and I think I'll try to perfect it.

The flavor and sauce was great. I did add pepper and some Italian seasoning to the sauce. Only issue I had with the recipe was too little sauce. I would recommend doubling the sauce recipe, otherwise great dish.

Absolutely divine!  Use uncooked shrimp, or as others have said, they will get rubbery.  
To get a burst of color, we added spinach near the end and wilted it.

Overall, okay recipe. I doubled the sauce like others said and it was just enough.I added scallops and shrimp at the very end. The meal tasted very bland, not much taste to it. The sauce was a little runny. Next time maybe more garlic.

This was amazing. Just like the real stuff if not better. Easy ingredients and easy to make. It does take a little to thicken but when you put it on it thickens more. It was amazing. Thank you for such a quick and easy recipe.

This was so simple to make. Everyone in my family loved it! After cooking the shrimp in the butter and garlic, I removed them before adding the half and half and cheese so that the shrimp wouldn't be overdone.

This recipe couldn't be easier, quicker or better.  I will double the sauce for next time -- I'd rather have too much than too little.  I added peas for contrast, and will add mushrooms and maybe julienned carrots next time.  Be patient with the sauce -- it's worth waiting for it to thicken.  And although I used cooked shrimp as the recipe called for, I think raw shrimp would work just as well.  LOVE THIS and can't wait to make again.

The flavor of this sauce is wonderful! I used it for both shrimp and chicken alfredo. Both were super yummy. Both times I tripled the sauce. With the shrimp, after reading other reviews, I waited till the sauce was done and nice and hot then added the cooked shrimp, covered it and removed from heat. Letting the sauce warm up the shrimp while I cooked the pasta. The shrimp was perfectly done that way. The sauce didn't thicken as much as I would have liked. I bet it would have if I'd have grated my own parm. But overall a huge hit with my family!

Pretty good recipe.  Nice flavor, but I think that I will add more garlic next time.  Also, I used bow tie pasta with this dish.  I feel that it could have been more creamy so I will make more changes such as adding more half and half next time.  Good recipe.

VERY simple and absolutely delicious! I added finely chopped onions and mushrooms as well as cooked chicken and a splash of hot sauce for some kick! It was great! Definitely will make again, and it will be an easy recipe to memorize and make on the fly!

Just made this for supper and it was delicious.I did however put a few additions because I was afraid of it being bland.I added a shallot, half an orange pepper and a few mushrooms. I also added a dash of white dry wine before pour in the cream. Everyone loved it, I will defiently be making this again.

Simply delicious and fool proof (if you are diligent with the stirring!). Here are my modifications MUST DOUBLE dairy portion to have enough, can also decrease noodles. I am partial to lots of sauce with my pasta so I kept the pasta and sauce separate until ready to eat then combined per plate.  Used one cup half and half, and one cup skim milk (my attempt to make it healthier). Added about 9 tbs of Parmesan cheese. Also added nutmeg, basil, oregano, chili powder, garlic powder, dried parsely, and black pepper. Must stir on low for a long time for it to thicken. I added about 3 tbs breadcrumbs to help the thickening process. Kept it to 1 tb butter. Let me tell you it was stupendous and I've never made Fettucine Alfredo before. I think adding the spices I listed below makes it way more flavorful, but possibly less authentic. It probably took me 30 minutes of stirring for it to thicken, probably took longer because of the skim milk involved. Breadcrumbs really helped (I didn't have constarch).

Great, simple recipe. To thicken the sauce, remove it from the heat and give it a few minutes.

I served this for my daughter's birthday dinner, and everyone loved it.  Some said it was the best Fettucine Alfredo they'd ever had.  I used chicken instead of shrimp and used real cream instead of half and half.  Great recipe.

I found it to be pretty bland and not enough cheesey flavor. The pasta took up all the sauce which made it dry overall. Maybe I did something wrong since it got such good reviews or else I am spoiled from having really good Italian restaurants around me.

We absolutely loved it. We used whole wheat noodles to add nutritonal value to our noodles. We also added flour to the sauce to thicken it up a little and of course we added a little sherry to the sauce. We will definitely be making it again.

Tastes pretty good, but I would recommend using more half and half and cheese.  I didn't think the recipe produced enough sauce; I just barely managed to coat all of the 1 lb. of fettucine. I added in steamed broccoli, too.  Yum.

It was amazing! I made it for my boyfriend, his brother and his girlfriend and they all loved it. I cooked the shrimp first in garlic removed it from heat so it wouldn't over cook while making the sauce. I did use more Parmesan because it wasn't thickening like I wanted, but once it started to cool it did thicken (a little too much lol, so I added milk). I will make this again indefinitely.  Recipes are guidelines, experiment!

This was easy and yummy! I used fat free half and half, added broccoli (from someone's recommendation - really provided that needed veggie and crunch), and whole wheat rotini pasta to make it "healthy". I like that it did not use a lot of butter either. It was good (although I was a little heavy handed with the pepper, no the recipes' fault). I will make again.

Excellent! I used 1/2 lb. fettucine pasta. Plus I removed the shrimp after sauteing it, I also used whipped cream and it thickened wonderfully. Added bonus was that it was done in the amount of time it takes to cook the pasta.

AMAZING!  I made a few changes, for my group I had to triple the ingredients.  For the liquid I used 2 C 1/2 & 1/2 and 1 C white wine.  Removed the shrimp & let all ingredients simmer until it thickened (about 30 minutes)  Rave reviews will definitely be making again!

Excellent. Half the pasta amount, use cream instead of the 1/2 and 1/2 to ensure thickening and add about 1/4 tsp of white pepper. I also threw in some sauteed mushrooms. DO NOT saute the shrimp. Add it to the sauce during the last 5 minutes or so of simmering.

This was fantastic, I'll never buy jarred alfredo sauce again!  I added a little chicken broth and a squeeze of lemon juice to give it a little zip.  My whole family gobbled it up.  This is a definite keeper!

I really want to give this recipe a five, but can not do it.  The recipe calls for 1 pound of noddles and that is WAY too much.  I read reviews but I wanted to score the recipe directly as it reads.  Let me say that the sauce was DELICIOUS AND EASY!  I did not have problems with it theckening.  Once I put the noddles in it BAM!  It worked.  Reduce the noddles and GREAT!

I had every intention of using shrimp, only to go to the freezer to find frozen chicken tenders. So I used that instead and added chopped sundried tomato. I used fat-free 1/2 and 1/2 and it never really thickened for me. There is not enough sauce for the amount of pasta, my noodles soaked up the sauce in no time and then it was really sticky. I had to add some olive oil to get it to toss.

Excellent recipe!  It turned out delicious!  Restaurant quality.  Next time I think I will add mushrooms and pine nuts, but the dish certainly doesn't need them.  I would advise making the dish as-is first, then add other ingredients next time you make it.  Just carry peppermints with you after eating this!  The garlic is a killer for breath.

i used this recipe tonight, but i changed quite a few things.  i cut down the amount of shrimp by half and added half a pound of sweet Italian sausage.  i let them saute in the butter and the garlic with some mushrooms and right before adding the sauce, some precooked broccoli. i also added a half cup more cheese, to thicken the sauce that much more.  right at the end, before the sauce got really thick, i added the shrimp, and then mixed it with rotele, as i wanted it all to cling to the pasta, and be a bit less of a saucy meal.  my kids and i loved it, and they are arguing over when we can eat the leftovers!

Wonderful.  I did double the sauce.  Used 1/2 stick of butter to saute garlic (and added mushrooms and scallions).  After adding the half/half and cheese, I cooked the sauce for about 25 minutes medium heat, stirring frequently.  Perfect consistency.  Definite keeper.  Thanks for the recipe

This was awesome!  I took the advise of other viewers and added the shrimp at the end of cooking and they came out great.  This make a lot so we had it for leftovers.  Sauce took a while to thicken a little bit so I finally tossed it all together and the flavor was wonderful!

Five stars for a solid combo of flavor, ease of prep, and minimal ingredients.  This recipe hits the mark when a quick and simple meal is needed, and which doesn't require a special trip to the market.  I prepared this as follows: 1 Tbsp butter melted, slowly stirred in 1 C half-and-half, one clove of minced garlic, added 3 Tbsp grated parmesean and 3 Tbsp grated romano.  Allowed to reduce.  Meanwhile, cut up 10-12 stalks of asparagus on the bias and pan fried in a little olive oil.  Added a little vermouth and some sea salt at the end.  Combined asparagus and pre-cooked cold shrimp with reduced sauce until the shrimp was warm, then mixed into fetuccini.  Depending on my audience, I'll add some red pepper flakes at the end.

I've been checking the internet for years, looking for a good Alfredo sauce to make for my wife.  This has been the best.  I did make some changes, though.  I didn't use quite so much garlicand I used full cream instead of half and half (not available in Spain).  As with all pasta dishes, the pasta is what makes or breaks it.  I used fresh taglietelle because anything larger would have overpowered the sauce.  And of course, I add mushrooms because mushrooms go great with just about all pasta :)  Have made several times now and will definately make again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great flavor.  I added about 2 tablespoons of flour after I had stirred the mixture over heat for 20 minutes and it was still too thin.  Awesome recipe.  Awesome flavor, just needs a little flour to help it thicken up a bit.

This was my first time ever cooking with seafood. Recipe was very yummy.  I added more half and half though so we could have more sauce, but it was delicious! Thanks for the recipe!!

This was very excellent.  I didn't realize that alfredo sauce could be so simple to make.  The shrimp does get slightly overdone, so next time I will saute the shrimp first, then set them aside while I make the alfredo sauce.  Will keep this on hand to serve to company I need to impress!

This was a very good and easy recipe.  I carmelized some onions and mushrooms and added them to it also.  I also doubled the sauce mixture and shrimp.  Everyone loved it.

Very good.  I had no problem with my sauce thickening. I wonder if the problem people had has to do with the type of Parmesan cheese.  I don't use the stuff in the green cylinder. Instead I grated fresh Parmesan.  Because I grated it coarsely (much easier) I used about 3/4 cup instead of the 1/2 cup (6 tablespoons) called for. Also, for the four of us I used 1/2 pound of pasta and 2 pounds of shrimp (my husband asked for the extra shrimp!).  It was lovely, but definetly not swimming in sauce.  If you like alot of sauce, follow the advice of others and double.

My husband said to save this recipe.  I added the shrimp at the end of the cooking time and used fat-free half and half.  Next time I might add some sauteed mushrooms but it was great as it was.

Great creamy alfredo. I would highly suggest to add the shrimp near the end of cooking the sauce as the shrimp was very overcooked by the time the sauce thickened.

Excellent!  I do not usually like creamy pasta sauces because it is so heavy, but I made this for my husband because he loves alfredo so much.  I added about half cup of white wine, and tripled the parsely, just because I love parsely in sauces.  It was fantastic! A big hit in our house.  Thanks for the recipe!

My family loved this and so did I!  It was quick and easy.  I made it as suggested with heavy cream and it came out perfect.  I cut cubes of boneless chicken breast and sauteed in olive oil and garlic til done, then drained the oil from the chicken and added the chicken to the sauce.  I also steamed some broccoli and cut some into the sauce too.  My family usually orders this type of meal from Chili's restaurant and they said it was even better!   Can't wait to try it again.

This was a great recipe, but too much fat.. I exchange the butter for vegan margerine and exhange the half and half with fat free half and half.  I did use cornstartch to thicken the sauce and it was great.  I am a heart patient and love cream sauces.. exchange the butter fat and half half made it so I could eat it!!  Great recipe thanks!!

This was delicious. I actually made it one time--don't know why it says two. It was so scrumptious and filling. I've made two minor tweaks to it--since I ran out of butter, I've used olive oil. And instead of fresh parsley, I've used dried flakes. It tasted real good. I would love to make it again sometime.

I used a little too much chicken (instead of shrimp) and it was pretty much flavorless. I even added some cream cheese to try to help, it did nothing for it.

Easy, simple, fast...and so tasty and creamy. I like the idea of adding a shrimp stock to the Alfredo (must try next time). I followed a lot of your suggestions on here and doubled the garlic content, the half-and-half, and parmesan. I also added about a T or so of corn starch as well as a bit of pasta water to aid the thickening process (saves on time!). All in all, I think the flavors (cream, cheese, garlic, butter, shrimp) all married well together and made the dish flavorful, authentic, and creamy. By the way, the pasta itself also helps the sauce thicken...just mix it all up well and use the double ingredients or so for the sauce and you'll be quite pleased with the results! On a side note, I find you'll need more than 10 min for the pasta to cook Al dente; I cooked mine for 12 min and could have even used a minute or two more.

This was really good and yes I will make it again. I did not use half -and- half. I used condensed milk instead and it worked out really well.

Easy and delicious. Used raw shrimp and cooked it in the butter/garlic mixture. Came out perfect.

I did not make any changes. I usually make recipes as they are written the first time I make them and then decide what changes I may make the next time.  I really like this recipe. It is simple and easy to make.  The family loved it.

tasted delicious, used dried parsley instead of fresh and seemed to add the same amount of flavor. I'm not sure if I fully cooked the sauce since it was slightly liquid-y when I served it but it was still delicious!

The flavor of the sauce earns this recipe 3 stars but as written this is again an example of using the wrong shrimp and way over cooking them to the point it degrades an excellent dish. The amount of sauce is also insufficient for a pound of fettuccine. I tried a second time using 16/20 raw peeled shrimp, cooked them with the garlic and butter while my wife prepared the sauce. We doubled the sauce amount and timed it so everything was ready at the same time. Turned out much better and we will make again in the amended version.

The only major change I made was a squeeze of lemon. I made it again with rotisserie chicken instead of shrimp and added a dash of Slap Ya Mama Cajun seasoning and fresh spinach. Both times I served over spaghetti squash topped with mozzarella.

Not enough sauce. Didn’t have flavor until I added garlic salt and butter to the sauce. Even then the most flavor came from the shrimp I made with butter and garlic. I don’t recommend this recipe.

Made it according to the recipe.  Excellent.  I wonder if some people that had difficulty with it thickening used "boxed" parmesan cheese rather than fresh grated parmesan cheese.

Came out great and works well as a base recipe or as is. I added capers and artichoke hearts. I also added the pasta to the pan with the sauce while the sauce was still thin. Tossed it around a bit and then took it off the heat.  Thickened up pretty fast after that.

I used more garlic and straight heavy cream, so end product was very think and rich, but really delicious, just not something the cholesterol wants on a regular basis.  Fast and simple.

Not bad, of course I added a little Cajun spice to this recipe. The biggest Change I’ll make next time is I’ll add my shrimp after making the sauce and just before adding the noodles so they’ll stay more tender.

I added sautéed mushrooms and 1 tablespoon flour to the melted butter  since I then used 2% milk instead of half and half.  It was delicious and didn't take too long to thicken.

This is a quick and simple recipe for alfredo. I did make some modifications (I added mushrooms (inspired by the picture)) and I cooked the shrimp ahead of time and added at the end just to warm up - this prevented overcooking of the shrimp.

I found the recipe a little on the bland side.  Perhaps, if I make it a gain, I'll add a pinch of red pepper flakes

It was a huge hit especially with my picky teen! Only thing I did differently was I made everything separate. I used 6oz of parmesan cheese. The sauce thickened (off heat) as I cooked the shrimp. Next time I will double the recipe for leftovers!

Normally my husband prefers a tomato based sauce for pasta, but he really liked this. I doubled the sauce and added fresh sliced mushrooms and a splash of white wine. The whole family loved it!

This was great!  My only change was that I used some sliced mushrooms and a small amount of chopped sweet onions to go with the shrimp and garlic.  At the very last I added ground parmajuan and Romano cheese.

Easy and delicious! I made exactly as written except I used 1 CUP of cheese because the sauce wasnt thickening, and other recipes for alfredo sauce seem to use much more cheese than this calls for. (I used 1 tsp dried parsley and 1/2 tsp salt) A lot of reviews say double the sauce, but I thought the proportions seemed fine. My whole family liked this, and it disappeared quickly!

I followed the recipe precisely other than my following a suggestion from another reviewer.  I put the shrimp into the sauce at the very end after the sauce thickened. This made sure the shrimp were not overcooked.  I also suggest that you taste the Parmesan sauce first before adding salt. I found that I did not need it because the parmesan cheese naturally added enough salt  for my taste. This dish is easy and quick to make.  My husband and I loved this dish!

This is so easy, fast, and incredibly good.  I am a pescatarian and believe I could become addicted to this dish.  Delicious!!!
I did not mind the thinner consistency, but agree with others that when you take it off the heat and let it sit it does thicken.

This is a wonderful recipe.  The only changes I made (and it really wasn’t a change) was I increased the amount of sauce per pasta.  In reading the reviews tips were given to do that and it works great!  
Also we sautéed our shrimp while making the sauce and put them in the sauce just before serving so they w ould not over cook.  (Another tip in reviews).  Thank you for the great reviews they are very helpful.  This dish was a HUGE SUCCESS!!!

Yummy recipe.  I added chopped steamed spinach to get some veggies - and some color.  The recipe is so good and so easy, I'll make it often.  Instead of garlic, I had some garlic flavored olive oil that I used.

My family loved this recipe.  I sauteed 2 lbs of raw shrimp with butter, salt, pepper and 4 cloves of garlic.  When shrimp was cooked,  I removed it and set aside. I doubled the half-n-half in the butter garlic pan and used double amount fresh grated parmesan cheese. When sauce thickened I added double fresh parsley with salt and added steamed broccoli and mushrooms. I used thin spaghetti instead of fettuccini noodles. Will definitely make this again.

I did make some changes.  I removed the shrimp from the pan after they were browned.  Shrimp gets tough if cooked too long. I made the sauce in the pan and added some pasta water to the sauce as it was too thick.  Then added the shrimp back into the pan to heat again.  It was good!

Great recipe!  To put it over the top add 3/4 lb. cooked hot Italian sausage (or mild if you prefer) at the end.  Stir in to combine.  Also, I really prefer my shrimp to NOT have the tails left on......they are awkward to deal with at the table.

This is a great recipe, one of many from my spinner.  Follow this one exact and it will not let you down.  Do as I do, 1) try the recipe as written, 2) make again with adjustments if needed a second time..  works virtually every time.

This was great! At the advice of others, I sautéed the shrimp and removed it before making the sauce so it wouldn't be overcooked. I added it back to the sauce shortly before finishing.  It was otherwise yummy as-is.

I'm not a big fan of cream sauces, although my wife really loves them.  I've made this before from another recipe, but I couldn't quite remember how it was done.  This recipe is simply enough to do almost every night.  It doesn't take much effort, very simple to make, and tastes good.  It's important though to have good shrimp and make sure not to overcook.  Personally, I also think it's important to make sure the pasta is of good quality, such as the types imported from Italy, and cooked al dente, Otherwise, you'll have something that tastes just like Michellina's frozen entrees.  Also note that the original does not take any cream, as cream tends to overpower any real flavours from the seasonings and parmigiano cheese.  I prefer without the cream, but my wife loved this dish and I quite liked it myself.  Always a favourite.

THIS RECIPE WAS DELICIOUS. I DOUBLED THE RECIPE TO MAKE A LB. OF PASTA. AS SUGGESTED BY OTHER REVIEWERS, I ADDEDTHE SHRIMP AT THE END IN ORDER TO AVOID THE SHRIMP OVERCOOKING. TURNED OUT DELISH. SAUCE THICKENS WHEN REMOVED FROM HEAT. QUIK AND EASY.

First attempt at alfredo sauce from scratch and it was amazing. It did take nearly 20 mins to thicken but was worth the wait. I'm now spoiled and will never buy that pre-made stuff in the stores again. We also had the benefit of fresh parmesan cheese which likely makes a ton of difference as well. Thanks for the recipe!

Shrimp overcooked--way too much fettuccine pasta; half pound would be sufficient. But flavor was just average.

My husband is a picky eater and told me he would eat this recipe three times a week if I made it.    It was easy so maybe I will.  LOL!!!

I made this exactly as stated except I only used 1/2 box of fettuccine as it was just my husband and myself.  Some stated it took quite a while for the sauce to thicken but it thickened up very quickly for me.  I think I may put in 2 cups of half and half and a little more parmesan the next time so that I would have more sauce.  But it was absolutely delicious!

This is one of the greatest recipes I've gotten off of Allrecipes yet.  My wife and I fully agree that this will be one of our meals to make regularly!
 I made a little more of the sauce....maybe 1.25X  It turned out GREAT!

I've done this recipe a few times however I use Whipping cream to  reduce instead of half and half (because it's not rich enough) then I add a tablespoon of Japanese Saki and half stick butter.

I made this tonight and it was very good.  I was disappointed because it did not thicken, even after over half hour of stirring it didn't thicken. I even took it off the heat as another reviewer suggested....still watery.  I ended up making a corn starch and 1/2 and 1/2 mixture to stir into the alfredo and it thickened up within a few minutes.  I will make this again but add the shrimp last because they did get overlooked waiting for it to thicken.

Adjusted the recipe to serve 4 instead of 6.  I reduced the amount of pasta and added 4 oz fresh mushrooms and 2 cups of fresh broccoli florets.  The result was a completely dry and bland dinner that I ended up throwing out.

I love ?? this recipe and made it for Christmas ! I used it a few years ago and wanted something different for Christmas.  I'm a  garlicholic, so my double recipe had a 1/4 cup of chopped garlic+??, the garlic was not overbearing. I used fresh shrimp, sautéed for a little over a minute. The flavor is incorporated when the half and  half is added. Fresh  parsley and grated cheese is a must. I have also substituted fresh chicken for shrimp. My ham wasn't  cut until the next day! If you make it they'll love ?? it!

I don't usually review recipes when they have so many already, but felt a need to with this one.  THIS RECIPE WAS EASY AND GREAT!!  I always read the best and the worst reviews before trying a new recipe.  I made this recipe exactly as written, but used uncooked shrimp and added 1 cup of sliced button mushrooms, we like mushrooms. I cooked the shrimp and garlic for about 5 minutes since they were raw and then added the 1/2/ and 1/2.    I used the 1/2 and 1/2, not heavy cream like some suggested.  I sprinkled the grated parmesan chess over the sauce a Tablespoon at a time, as directed, and it was absorbed by the sauce and was not “a gooey mess”.  The sauce thickened up in about 10 minutes after adding the 1/2 and 1/2.  There was no need to add anything to "help" the sauce thicken.  I followed the instructions to stir occasionally and not to let the sauce boil, which could cause the  1/2 and 1/2 to separate.   The sauce does thicken a little as it cools.  I added salt sparingly as we don't like heavily salted food, and added a 1/4 teaspoon white pepper, too, because we do like a little spice.  If you like garlic, add more if you don’t, then cut it in 1/2.  I always season according to our taste, but this was right with the white pepper, for us.   This was a great dish and I thank MamaTiff for sharing it.  I will definitely used this recipe again and try it with chicken too!!

To avoid overcooking the raw shrimp I used, I only briefly sauteed them in garlic and butter before setting them aside. The shrimp were less than half done. I also used light cream instead of half and half for a creamier sauce, and a five cheese Italian blend. For a half pound to 3/4 lb pasta, I recommend increasing the cream to two cups, and increasing the cheese gradually until the sauce is the proper consistency. You do need to stay and stir the sauce constantly over very low heat.   You don't need to add more parsley. Readd the shrimp at the end and stir them lightly until coated and hot. The shrimp will then be perfectly cooked and flavored. My guests and son loved it!  Very easy to make!

Followed the recipe for the most part but did double the sauce recipe and only cooked 1/2 lb of fettuccine noodles.  Was quite delicious and will definitely make it again.

The cheese clumped up and the milk never thickened and I let it cook for awhile.  I had clumps of cheese stuck to the shrimp.  Next time I'll stick with the added step of making a white sauce first and then adding it to the shrimp and garlic.

Tried this with homemade Fettuccine pasta.  Super good!  Did the raw shrimp and garlic separately and added them at the end.  Did not have Parmesan but used a five cheese Italian shredded blend.  Will definitely make this again.

I pretty much followed the recipe except I took other reviewers advice and put the shrimp in near the end.   That worked well.   I used dry parsley from our spice rack and I'm not sure how much that added to the flavor or took away.  Someone else also mentioned that once you take it off the heat is when it thickens. That is true. In fact, my sauce was super thick after sitting off the heat.  At firsr I was beginning to wonder if it would thicken up. But I removed it from the heat,  added the shrimp then added the cooked noodles. Mixed it up and then let it sit for about 5 -10 min. It thickened up perfectly. I found the 1 lb box of fettuccine noodles was the perfect amount for the amount of sauce .  If you like your pasta to be more on the saucy  side, maybe boil a little less than a pound of noodles.  The noodles tend to soak up a lot of sauce as it sits.  The flavor is wonderful.  It's a basic alfredo sauce and so easy to make.   Definitely add pepper and sprinkle with a small handful of parmesan before serving.

I enjoyed this dish. I followed some of the reviewers suggestions and added fresh mushrooms. I did not have parsley, so I used cilantro. I also increased the  half and half, and simmered it about 20 minutes to thicken before I added shrimp and scallops. That way they did not get overdone. I think this sauce would be good over other pasta as well.

Very easy to make and delicious. After reading some of the other reviews I took the advice of others and added some corn starch to help thicken the sauce. I also added the shrimp to the sauce at the end along with some pepper. Definitely will make this recipe again. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was amazing! I followed other people's suggestions and set aside the shrimp after cooking so as to not overcook it. I also sautéed mushrooms and garlic in butter for it as well which was a great addition. Definitely add 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, and 1 1/2 tbsp cornstarch as suggested too. The cornstarch thickened it easily, and didn't affect the taste. I will be definitely serving this for special occasions; very restaurant quality!

I used heavy cream. It was what I had on hand.  I also used half of the box of fettucini noodles, after I sauteed the shrimp and garlic I removed from pan. Kept the pan hot and followed the recipe.  Had no problems with the Alfredo thickening. I added shrimp to Alfredo right before serving.

I made it last night for dinner and it was delicious. I did make a few changes. First I sauteed the shrimp and garlic with 1 tablespoon of butter, then I removed it and set it aside and I cooked the rest of the ingredients in the same pan. I also used whipping cream instead of the half and half along with another tablespoon of butter and sprinkled a pinch of kosher salt and pepper to the sauce. I kind of felt that with the half and half the sauce would be a bit a bit to runny. After the sauce was done, I then added the shrimp and fettuccine. I didn't have parsley, but it still came out very good.

I also removed the shrimps after cooking them made the sauce and added the shrimps and parsley at the last minute with lemon wedges. it was a success. Serve with white wine and also with shrimp cocktail and pan sear scallops with lemon. Great dinner every one were impress.

Delicious and Hubby says it's a 'keeper'.  
I didn't have any cream so I used regular milk added  1/3 cup cream cheese (to make it creamy) and some crushed crackers (to help thicken the sauce), as well as sliced mushrooms. 
Will make again.

My sauce never came together. Instead I had stringy cheese and a hot, very garlicky cream. I also added some nutmeg.  I think there's too much garlic -- not quite overpowering,  but you darn well better like the flavor of garlic if you're going to prepare this.

My family loved it! 1st time making it and I used cooked shrimp. I made 2 portions of the sauce so that it would be more creamy, Also I used 1 teaspoon of minced garlic in a jar in place of each garlic clove... just as good. & i used parsley in a jar instead of fresh.. it was great!

Perfecto! 

No need to alter the recipe to thicken the gravy. Once it is cooked to the point you've finished adding the cheese, let it simmer for a minute at most and even if it doesn't look thickened enough, it will be once mixed with the pasta.  

I actually did use heavy whipping cream and not half and half. 

I just poured the shrimp and gravy over the pasta and mixed it up and it was thick enough.

A little white vino and some Italian bread toasted with some olive oil and garlic spread is an added treat.

My mother cook  but since I move by myself with my son. I have to do all the cooking, I just tried this honestly this was amazing. The only thing, I didn't do is the half and half. I used the glass sauce of Alfredo which I believe is the best for me. In I also chopped up  chicken breast and add into the salute shrimp which was fabulous. I love this recipe.

Was a bit bland as written, but a couple dashes of Tony's made a big difference. Because I used uncooked shrimp, I sauteed those first in butter/garlic till pink. Sprinkled liberally with Tony's before I cooked. Removed from pan, started pasta water. Meanwhile, in same shrimp pan, added 1.5 cups of low-fat half n half, a T of water/cornstarch, more Tony's, and shredded Parmesan along the way. Added a splash of white wine, too. After it reduced, I added the fettuccine and then the shrimp. Green onions and/or shallots would've been a nice addition, too. Thanks for the recipe!!

Absolutely delicious! Made this as a date night dinner for my boyfriend and he couldn't get enough! Quick and easy to make. The sauce on its own definitely won't feed 6 people, more like 2-3. But other than that, amazing. Will definitely use this for every Alfredo recipe in the future. No more buying Alfredo from the store.

Since I had uncooked shrimp, it went in right after the butter, garlic and the addition of shallots.  Only had fat-free half & half and that was fine too.  First time making Alfredo for my teen son who's enjoyed it in restaurants recently and it was a winner. Easy too.

This was really good. Made as a valentine dinner for two, so I had to adjust the serving size which resulted in not having enough sauce. So I had to double my sauce recipe. My husband and I really enjoyed this meal and I will be making it again.

Followed the advise of cooking shrimp first and putting it aside until the sauce is done. That worked well. For those who thought the original sauce recipe had problems with thickness ... I had the opposite challenge. Great flavor and I'll do it again with a bit more half and half. This recipe is a keeper per my very picky husband.

The sauce never thickened which made shrimp shrivel up. Timing was was off. The flavor was good.

It was good. My boyfriend liked it. I think next time I'll sautee the shrimp before adding it to the cream mixture. I used heavy whipping cream instead of half&half. I also used 2 cups of heavy cream instead of 1. It turned out good I think. Thank you for the recipe.

I thought it was way too, too bland  - a real nothing taste.  It definitely needs more sauce for that amount of pasta, however, the sauce thickned in a few minutes. All in all it was a real disappointment.

So I made this and I came out okay not the best did I do something wrong? I got confused when it said it takes a while for the sauce to thicken. What is a while I waited and stirred and it never go it thick! Any advice FYI I just started learning to cook.

My (very picky) family devoured this. I added a teaspoon of cornstarch to the butter prior to adding the half and half to help thicken the sauce. It got a little too thick, but I simply added a little more half and half. It was very good and I will make it again. I like that it uses half and half rather than heavy whipping cream so I save on calories.

I thought it was a great recipe, double the sauce though. and the main thing is serve it warm because once it gets cold the sauce gets real thick and doesn't taste the same at all.

Never made it before but I took the chance and served it for company. They loved it.  I changed it up a bit and added mushrooms and broccoli. Will make this again, and I also will try making it with chicken.

Had nice clean taste. Sauce was not heavy. Added shrimp at end just to heat through. Served fettuccini and shrimp/sauce separately. Definitely a keeper recipe!

Awesome! So easy yet so good! I too read the rating and took others advice; added the shrimp once removing the sauce from the heat and allowing it to thicken.  I tripled the recipe so I did use a whole box of pasta and it was not too saucy. I added crab meat and broccoli, would have added mushrooms but they are not favorites with the other household members. Believe me.....I have tough critics and they loved it! A definite keeper!

This pasta turns out very dry. I like the flavor, but it needs more cream (which means more of other things). I like the low amount of butter though. Also, I would not cook shrimp in sauce next time, only adding it at the very end. The shrimp became overlooked. Maybe just cook them in garlic?

This was delicious! I am a mom of four kids 2-13 and they all loved it. I was in a pinch for dinner and saw this. I had all the ingredients except the half & half so I used milk instead. It came out great. I can't wait to try as written if it was this great with just the milk =)

Success! I didn't grow up eating "white" sauces, but I needed something to highlight leftover shrimp and dungeness crab that wouldn't overpower those flavors. I followed the directions exactly w/ the exceptions of adding the uncooked shrimp in the beginning and adding sliced fresh mushrooms just because I had them and thought they'd be nice. I added the mushrooms and peeled precooked shrimp after the sauce had thickened (I had no problem w/ thickening) and parsley and salt had been added (not much salt needed, I thought). I let those heat through on very low heat while pasta cooked. I added a little cream to thin and at the last minute before adding cooked pasta, I added the crab and very gently turned it to keep it from breaking apart. Added the pasta, again turned very gently and... Success! This was VERY good. Thank you, MamaTiff!

I had some fresh spinach in the fridge, so I added it to my shrimp after it had cooked a spell. I made the white sauce separately and then added it to the shrimp. All six kids at my table and my brother really liked it. Why go to Olive Garden and spend a fortune on shrimp fettuccine alfedo, when you can cook it at home for the whole family for about the same price as 1 meal! Thanks!

Very delicious, but I did modify recipe. I doubled the shrimp, sprinkled old bay over the shrimp (to my preference) and added 1 large head of steamed broccoli florets sprinkling Mrs. Dash seasoning over the broccoli to prevent to much salt and added a little pepper. I sauted the shrimp and garlic briefly then added the  steamed broccoli. I removed the shrimp and broccoli from the pan so as not to overcook. As advised by other reviewers I added 1 Tb of cornstarch to fat-free half-n-half then added about 8 Tb of parmesan cheese. After thickening I then mixed all together. Fantastic!

Good easy dish, I added broccoli to it as well.  I didnt add cornstrack or flour to thicken, as when you mix the sauce and noodles together, the noodles absorbed the sauce.

Excellent recipe! I did make a few changes another reviewer made by using fat free half & half with 1 1/2 tbsp corn starch, as well as 1/4 tsp pepper. I also waited to add the shrimp until the end to avoid overcooking it. Overall, it was absolutely delicious!

Easy to make and very flavorable. The only changes I made was instead of Half and half I used heavy whipping cream,which made the sauce thicker. I also added sun dried tomatoes for a twist.

Prepared this dish for the very first time for just my husband and I, and it was DELICIOUS!!!!! We added Lawrys Seasoned Salt and some Cajun Seasoning to the Shrimp while they were sauteing. I didn't have any half & half, only heaving whipping cream, so we did 1/2 C heavy cream and 1/2 cup milk. The one and only thing I will do differently next time is to DOUBLE the sauce for the amount of noodles it calls for! Eesy dinner for that busy schedule an an excellent recipe for that pasta lover!!

Yummy.  I tried this recipe for a New Year's Eve family dinner and I got great reviews.  I took the advice of others, added the shrimp at the end, and carrots.

I thought this was pretty easy and quick to make. The only problem I had with it is I love my pasta covered in sauce but this recipe didn't make enough for my taste. I would double the sauce for the amount of pasta.

Great tasting recipe! I would definitely cook the shrimp separately, though, not only to avoid overcooking it but so that you can more effectively stir the sauce.

Great flavors.  Our sauce didn't thicken on or off the heat, but it did taste nice.  Family didn't care for the thinner version this turned into for us, though I thought it was nice for dipping bread into.....  Makes me wonder about the alfredo sauces in restaurants????

This is a really yummy! I added some extra garlic because you can never have too much garlic. Also, add some corn starch to thicken it. Next time I might just use heavy cream instead of half and half so that it will be easier to thicken. Super quick and easy, the whole family loved it!

I would give this 3 1/2 stars if I could. The recipe worked fine and it thickens nicely when removed from the heat. It just doesn't have the delicious richness of traditional Alfredo. Next time I will splurge and use cream instead.

Very easy. I sauted raw shrimp and mushrooms in the butter and garlic, and then followed recipe, and it turned out wonderful. My family went back for thirds. Going to use this as an easy weekday meal.

this recipe was awesome! i used half the noodles and linguini (because that was all that was available in whole wheat). but i put the shrimp in from the start, which was frozen and the smaller shrimp and started the temp off w med temp and as the sauce started ti thicken (which only took like 5 min. since i was consistently stirring) i kept lowering the heat. the thickness was perfect and nothing was overcooked. i also threw some broccoli in while i was cooking the pasta. it was perfect!

I would give this more stars if possible.  Turned out wonderful.  Was easy and delicious.  Will make again and again.  I added fresh mushrooms and used raw shrimp, so just cooked shrimp and mushrooms with the garlic then continued on with the rest of the recipe.  I used two pounds of shrimp and just doubled the rest of the ingredients except the pasta.  Was just right.  Plenty of sauce for that amount of noodles.  Sauce thickened up fast.

Pretty decent. I strongly suggest to use fresh Parmesan over the cheap sprinkle or the cheap walmart cheese, simply because it will melt better.

This is a lot healthier than the sauce that I make, as this one uses less butter. It is the perfect consistency. The fresh garlic adds to this sauce something that mine was missing. I left out the shrimp and added steamed broccoli. Served with salmon. Thanks so much.  I will have to share this with my niece who absolutely love the sauce that I make.

We really liked this dish. I did not have enough parmesan cheese so I added 1/2 cup feta. WOW was it good! I halved the pasta amount so I would have enough sauce. It was a little runny but that is better than too thick and heavy. The sauce made a good dipper for our bread. I will make this again and I'll keep the feta too.

Great recipe!  I added mushrooms and asparagus.  I accidentally let the cream boil, but all that did was make it thicken quicker.  If you like your pasta saucy, you will definitely need to double the sauce.

This is great. My wife and I just love this. I add a little onion and garlic at the beginning, and hold off on cooking the shrimp till the end, just before adding the pasta.

Amazingly delicious!  We used spaghettini instead of fettucine because it's what we had on hand.  Wish we had made more!  We doubled the sauce, and the whole thing still only lasted 5 person meals.

This is a great.  To get the sauce to thicken I heat the sauce to just steaming and then I put it into a blender.  (If you have a hand blender and do it in a sauce pan I bet you can use that too.) Then I return it to the pan to finish the cooking. Also, I don't like the linguini as much as other types of pasta.  I usually use Penne.

very good recipe, however there was never enough of the Alfredo we had to almost triple the recipe for the sauce.  We also have used it with both chicken and shrimp.

After eating this my husband told me never to buy the store brand alfredo sauce again!! The only thing I changed was to add 1tsp of Italian herbs before adding the shrimp back in. Also adding a Tble of Lemon juice to the shrimp really gives it a kick.

Very good recipe but the proportions are a bit off.  Use less pasta or more sauce for proper consistency.  I used three-quarters of a pound of fettucini and increased cheese by a bit--this worked well.  I also added some hot red pepper flakes and a dash of cooking sherry for extra taste.  Very good recipe but I need to give it 3 stars as the proportions are off--with my adaptations it is a definite 5!  Tasted great.

Tasted good, but I had trouble with the consistency. Next time, I'll get the consistency right before I put the shrimp (and broccoli) in to prevent overcooking.

We thought this was pretty good.  I did have a problem with the sauce separating--but that could be because I didn't add the parm cheese 1 TB at a time(?).  I halved the pasta and still didn't seem to have enough sauce.  Oh, and I added some pre-cooked broccoli, and I removed the shrimp after I sauted it in the garlic butter so it wouldn't over-cook.

First, the pasta:shrimp ratio is off. Yes, you are supposed to have more pasta than shrimp but not that much more. Second, do not cook the sauce until it thickens because you will end up with very little sauce. The sauce will thicken upon standing. Third, these are not the right ingredients for the sauce. I will try another recipe.

About as easy as it gets...I doubled the sauce ingredients because of my family's preference for sauce dishes and used about a cup and a half of Parmesan. Since I was using pre-cooked shrimp, they were not added until nearly the end. A good base sauce, it certainly lends itself for experimenting with different types and amounts of seafood, cheeses and/or vegetables.

I eyeballed the parmesan (added extra) and added 1% percent milk along with the half and half.  I also added mushrooms and onions to the garlic.  I put the shrimp in last so it wouldn't dry out.  Yum!  Next time I think i'll use angel hair instead of fettuccine.

I was looking for a recipe to use up my shrimp and penne pasta and tried this recipe.  I didn't have half and half so I substituted half milk and half sour cream.  I loved it.  The recipe is very versatile.  It's a great basic recipe to make changes for what you have on hand.

Great recipe! Changes for me were trying to "knock it up" nutritionally.  I used whole grain and a spinach fettucine pasta.  Used half the amount of butter, replacing the other half with "SMART BUTTER" (trying to cut down calories and fat a little bit).  And of course, used the fat free half & half for the heavy cream.  TURNED OUT GREAT!!!!!!!!!  Husband was thrilled to be able to almost "legally" eat fettucine alfredo!

This was pretty good for a simple alfredo. I will probably make this again sometime; however, this is not something I would make often. My family thought is was pretty good  also, but not great.

due to other reviews mention an insufficient amount of alfredo, I kept the pasta to one pound, but doubled all other ingredients needed to prepare the alfredo. I also added one package of sliced imitation crab meat and one pound of diced mushrooms.  The family went wild over it, & begs for it often!!

I followed the recipe to a T, Like others my sauce did not thicken up and i was out of romano and had just enough parm for the recipe..will try again and use both romano and parm and that should eliminate the thinness of the sauce.

The flavor of this dish was great!  My boyfriend loves a good fettucine alfredo, and he said this was good and had a second helping!  

I took the advice of another reviewer and added the shrimp after the sauce had thickened.  The shrimp remained firm and did not become mushy.  I also added 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper for seasoning as the same reviewer suggested...it was perfect!  

I had no problem with the sauce thickening, but I probably added more Parmesan cheese than the recipe called for.  I also used freshly grated Parmesan cheese rather than the bottled Parmesan cheese.  I would say to double the amount of sauce for 1 lb. of pasta if you like your pasta pretty well coated in the sauce.

This was a quick and easy recipe so 5 stars for that and another 5 stars from the family.  Everyone had seconds and leftovers did not last long.  A true winner.

Excellent quick dish to make!  My daughter loved it.  As others have suggested, I added 1 teaspoon of flour to thicken the sauce.

I added cream instead of half & half and extra garlic.  It took a long time to thicken, but the result was terrific.  Thanks for a lovely meal!

Really good...but the sauce never got thick, even after I added cornstarch and more shredded parm than was called for.  However, once I mixed it in with the pasta, it was fine.  I also added mushrooms.  Husband thought it was a great birthday supper!

The sauce did take awhile to thicken, even after adding cornstarch and it left a funny after taste.  I will not rush to make this again.

This recipe was good and I will make it again.  However, with their only being two of us, I only cooked 1/2 pound of fettucine and felt there was not enough sauce on the fettucine.  Next time I will double the ingredients for the sauce.

This is very tasty, but.........the sauce does not thicken fast enough.  I cheated and thickened up the sauce myself as the shrimp was getting overcooked.  So be careful.  Great recipe, very "restaurant quality" (if your sauce isn't runny).

This was pretty good.  I would have cut down on the garlic though, but that's just personal taste.  It took a long time to prepare, and I did the shrimp seperate from the sauce and threw it in when the sauce was pretty much done.

Whenever a recipe calls for sauce, I always double or even triple it; especially if pasta is involved because it soaks the sauce up so quickly. I used fat free half and half and eliminated the salt as there's plenty of it in the parm. Absolutely wonderful Tiffany!

I changed this recipe a little bit, but it came out great! I wanted to make about two servings, so I cut the recipe in half. The changes that I made were: I used heavy cream instead of half and half, I used 3tbsp of Romano and 3tbsp of Parmesan cheeses (even though I halved the recipe, I still used all 6 tbsps of cheese!), and I only used 1 clove of minced garlic. I added some fresh ground black pepper as well. The end result was delicious and I had no problems with sauce consistancy at all. The only minor complaint I might have is that I felt the recipe didn't yield quite enough sauce. Next time I will probably make a little more. The Romano definitely adds something to the sauce, and I would recommend using fresh fettucine (cooks faster too!) for that added touch.

Easy to make, but kind of bland and I couldn't get the sauce to thicken.  I will try using cream next time, like the others suggested.

use heavy cream instead, put in a 1/2 cup frozen peas, the cheese can be served on the side. I set the shrimp aside while the sauce cooked then add the shrimp at the end , this keeps shrimp from being chewy
